P. 68. He is as distinct a being, etc. Cf. Pope (Nichol Smith’s
“Eighteenth Century Essays,” p. 48): “Every single character in
Shakespeare is as much an individual as those in life itself; it is[Pg 365]
impossible to find any two alike; and such as from their relation or
affinity appear most to be twins, will upon comparison be found remarkably
distinct.” Beattie also had commented on “that wonderfully penetrating and
plastic faculty, which is capable of representing every species of
character, not as our ordinary poets do, by a high shoulder, a wry mouth,
or gigantic stature, but by hitting off, with a delicate hand, the
distinguishing feature, and that in such a manner as makes it easily known
from all others whatsoever, however similar to a superficial eye.” (Quoted
in Drake’s “Memorials of Shakespeare,” 1828, p. 255.) Richard Cumberland
had developed a parallel between Macbeth and Richard III in the Observer,
Nos. 55-58, but it is to the suggestion of Thomas Whateley that Hazlitt is
chiefly indebted. Both Richard III and Macbeth, says Whateley, “are
soldiers, both usurpers; both attain the throne by the same means, by
treason and murder; and both lose it too in the same manner, in battle
against the person claiming it as lawful heir. Perfidy, violence, and
tyranny are common to both; and these only, their obvious qualities, would
have been attributed indiscriminately to both by an ordinary dramatic
writer. But Shakespeare, in conformity to the truth of history as far as
it led him, and by improving upon the fables which have been blended with
it, has ascribed opposite principles and motives to the same designs and
actions, and various effects to the operation of the same events upon
different tempers. Richard and Macbeth, as represented by him, agree in
nothing but their fortunes.” (See the Variorum edition of “Richard III,”
p. 549.) Hazlitt makes similar discriminations between the characters of
Iago and Richard III, between Henry VI and Richard II, and between Ariel
and Puck.

P. 78. There is no attempt to force an interest. Professor Saintsbury
(“History of Criticism,” III, 258) calls this utterance an apex of
Shakespearian criticism. Hazlitt makes a similar comment in the character
of “Troilus and Cressida”: “He has no prejudice for or against his
characters: he saw both sides of a question; at once an actor and a
spectator in the scene.” Dr. Johnson had observed this attitude in
Shakespeare, but he had seen in it a violation of the demands of poetic
justice: “he carries his persons indifferently through right and wrong,
and at the close dismisses them without further care, and leaves their
examples to operate by chance. This fault the barbarity of his age cannot
extenuate; for it is always a writer’s duty to make the world better, and
justice is a virtue independent on time or place.” (Nichol Smith’s
“Eighteenth Century Essays on Shakespeare,” p. 123.)

Academy of Compliments, or the Whole Duty of Courtship, being the
nearest or most exact way of wooing a Maid or Widow, by the way of
Dialogue or Complimental Expressions (1655, 1669).
The neglect of punctilious exactness, etc. The entire passage follows
pretty closely the interpretation of Lamb: “Among the distinguishing
features of that wonderful character, one of the most interesting (yet
painful) is that soreness of mind which makes him treat the intrusions of
Polonius with harshness, and that asperity which he puts on in his
interviews with Ophelia. These tokens of an unhinged mind (if they be not
mixed in the latter case with a profound artifice of love, to alienate
Ophelia by affected discourtesies, so to prepare her mind for the breaking
off of that loving intercourse, which can no longer find a place amidst
business so serious as that which he has to do) are parts of his
character, which to reconcile with our admiration of Hamlet, the most
patient consideration of his situation is no more than necessary; they are
what we forgive afterwards, and explain by the whole of his character,
but at the time they are harsh and unpleasant.... [His behavior toward
Ophelia] is not alienation, it is a distraction purely, and so it always
makes itself to be felt by that object: it is not anger, but grief
assuming the appearance of anger,—love awkwardly counterfeiting hate, as
sweet countenances when they try to frown.” “On the Tragedies of
Shakespeare.” (Works, ed. Lucas, I, 103-104)
He may be said to be amenable, etc. Cf. Coleridge (Works, IV, 145): “His
thoughts, and the images of his fancy, are far more vivid than his actual
perceptions, and his very perceptions, instantly passing through the
medium of his contemplations, acquire, as they pass, a form and a colour
not naturally their own. Hence we see a great, an almost enormous,
intellectual activity, and a proportionate aversion to real action,
consequent upon it, with all its symptoms and accompanying qualities.”

and noted as the leader of the stately school in tragedy.[Pg 368] Hazlitt often
contrasted his manner with that of Kean: “We wish we had never seen Mr.
Kean. He has destroyed the Kemble religion; and it is the religion in
which we were brought up.” Works, VIII, 345.

Kean, Edmund (1787-1833), the great English tragic actor whom Hazlitt
was instrumental in discovering for the London public. Shylock and Othello
were his most successful roles. For accounts of his various performances,
see “A View of the English Stage” (Works, VIII). Most of the points in
this essay are reproduced from the notice of Kean’s Hamlet (VIII,
185-189).
 
This extract is the opening paragraph of the sketch.
P. 84. a great critic, A. W. Schlegel. The passage alluded to by Hazlitt
appears in Coleridge’s Works (IV, 60-61) in what is little more than a
free translation: “Read ‘Romeo and Juliet’;—all is youth and
spring;—youth with its follies, its virtues, its precipitancies;—spring
with its odors, its flowers, and its transiency; it is one and the same
feeling that commences, goes through, and ends the play. The old men, the
Capulets and the Montagues, are not common old men; they have an
eagerness, a heartiness, a vehemence, the effect of spring; with Romeo,
his change of passion, his sudden marriage, and his rash death, are all
the effects of youth;—whilst in Juliet love has all that is tender and
melancholy in the nightingale, all that is voluptuous in the rose, with
whatever is sweet in the freshness of the spring; but it ends with a long
deep sigh like the last breeze of the Italian evening.”

a celebrated person, Sir Humphry Davy; see p. 342. Cf.[Pg 369] Coleridge
(Works, IV, 66): “Shakespeare was not only a great poet, but a great
philosopher.”
P. 87. Poetry and the stage. Cf. Lamb, “On the Tragedies of Shakespeare”
(ed. Lucas, I, 110): “Spirits and fairies cannot be represented, they
cannot even be painted,—they can only be believed. But the elaborate and
anxious provision of scenery, which the luxury of the age demands, in
these cases works a quite contrary effect to what is intended. That which
in comedy, or plays of familiar life, adds so much to the life of the
imitation, in plays which appeal to the higher faculties, positively
destroys the illusion which it is introduced to aid.”
 
Hazlitt’s interpretation of Falstaff is worth comparing with that of
Maurice Morgann in “An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John
Falstaff,” although Hazlitt does not allude to Morgann’s essay and is
supposed to have had no knowledge of it. “To me then it appears that the
leading quality in Falstaff’s character, and that from which all the rest
take their colour, is a high degree of wit and humour, accompanied with
great natural vigour and alacrity of mind.... He seems, by nature, to have
had a mind free of malice or any evil principle; but he never took the
trouble of acquiring any good one. He found himself esteemed and beloved
with all his faults; nay for his faults, which were all connected with
humour, and for the most part grew out of it. As he had, possibly, no
vices but such as he thought might be openly confessed, so he appeared
more dissolute thro’ ostentation. To the character of wit and humour, to
which all his other qualities seem to have conformed themselves, he
appears to have added a very necessary support, that of the profession
of a Soldier.... Laughter and approbation attend his greatest excesses;
and being governed visibly by no settled bad principle or ill design, fun
and humour account for and cover all. By degrees, however, and thro’
indulgence, he acquires bad habits, becomes an humourist, grows enormously
corpulent, and falls into the infirmities of age; yet never quits, all the
time, one single levity or vice of youth, or loses any of that
cheerfulness of mind which had enabled him to pass thro’ this course with
ease to himself and delight to others; and thus, at last, mixing youth and
age, enterprize and corpulency,[Pg 370] wit and folly, poverty and expence, title
and buffoonery, innocence as to purpose, and wickedness as to practice;
neither incurring hatred by bad principle, or contempt by cowardice, yet
involved in circumstances productive of imputation in both; a butt and a
wit, a humourist and a man of humour, a touchstone and a laughing stock, a
jester and a jest, has Sir John Falstaff, taken at that period of life
in which we see him, become the most perfect comic character that perhaps
ever was exhibited.” (Nichol Smith’s “Eighteenth Century Essays on
Shakespeare,” 226-7.)

affections, retain nothing but their humanity.”

It has been indeed objected to Milton. Cf. Coleridge (Works, ed. Shedd,

Coleridge’s “Table Talk,” August 7, 1832: “It is very remarkable that in
no part of his writings does Milton take any notice of the great painters
of Italy, nor, indeed, of painting as an art; while every other page
breathes his love and taste for music.... Adam[Pg 372] bending over the sleeping
Eve, in Paradise Lost, and Dalilah approaching Samson, in the Agonistes,
are the only two proper pictures I remember in Milton.”

are here referred to. Cf. “Political Essays,” III, 158-159.
P. 115. Longinus preferred the Iliad. “Whereas in the Iliad, which was
written when his genius was in its prime, the whole structure of the poem
is founded on action and struggle, in the Odyssey he generally prefers
the narrative style, which is proper to old age. Hence Homer in his
Odyssey may be compared to the setting sun; he is still as great as
ever, but he has lost his fervent[Pg 373] heat. The strain is now pitched in a
lower key than in the ‘Tale of Troy Divine’: we begin to miss that high
and equable sublimity which never flags or sinks, that continuous current
of moving incidents, those rapid transitions, that force of eloquence,
that opulence of imagery which is ever true to Nature. Like the sea when
it retires upon itself and leaves its shores waste and bare, henceforth
the tide of sublimity begins to ebb, and draws us away into the dim region
of myth and legend. In saying this I am not forgetting the fine
storm-pieces in the Odyssey, the story of the Cyclops, and other
striking passages. It is Homer grown old I am discussing, but still it is
Homer.” On the Sublime, IX, trans. Havell.

This selection begins with the second paragraph of the fourth lecture on
the “English Poets.”
P. 118. The question whether Pope was a poet. Hazlitt had written a
paper in answer to this question in the Edinburgh Magazine for February,
1818 (Works, XII, 430-432), from which the following paragraphs down to
“Such at least is the best account” are copied. The question had been
previously answered by Dr. Johnson with the same common sense as by
Hazlitt: “It is surely superfluous to answer the question that has once
been asked, Whether Pope was a poet? otherwise than by asking in return,
If Pope be not a poet, where is poetry to be found? To circumscribe poetry
by a definition will only shew the narrowness of the definer, though a
definition which shall exclude Pope will not easily be made.” (“Life of
Pope,” ed. B. Hill, III, 251). In their edition of Pope (II, 140), Elwin
and Courthope express the opinion that the doubt which both Johnson and
Hazlitt felt called upon to refute “was never[Pg 374] maintained by a single
person of reputation.” Yet there is something very close to such a doubt
implied in the utterances of Coleridge: “If we consider great
exquisiteness of language and sweetness of metre alone, it is impossible
to deny to Pope the character of a delightful writer; but whether he was a
poet, must depend upon our definition of the word.... This, I must say,
that poetry, as distinguished from other modes of composition, does not
rest in metre, and that it is not poetry, if it make no appeal to our
passions or our imagination.” (Works, ed. Shedd, IV, 56.) Pope’s verse was
made the occasion of a long-winded controversy as to the relative value of
the natural and artificial in poetry, lasting from 1819 to 1825, with
William Bowles and Lord Byron as the principal combatants. Hazlitt
contributed an article to the London Magazine for June, 1821, “Pope, Lord
Byron and Mr. Bowles” (Works, XII, 486-508), in which he pointed out the
fallacies in Byron’s position and censured the clerical priggishness of
Bowles in treating of Pope’s life. The chief points in the discussion are
best summed up in Prothero’s edition of Byron’s “Letters and Journals,”
Vol. V, Appendix III.

Arbuthnot, John (1667-1735), physician and man of letters, whom
Thackeray introduced in attendance at the death-bed of Francis Esmond. “He
had a very notable share in the immortal History of John Bull, and the
inimitable and praiseworthy Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus.... Arbuthnot’s
style is distinguished from that of his contemporaries, even by a greater
degree of terseness and conciseness. He leaves out every superfluous word;
is sparing of connecting particles, and introductory phrases; uses always
the simplest forms of construction; and is more a master of the idiomatic
peculiarities and internal resources of the language than almost any other
writer.” “English Poets,” Lecture VI.

From the sixth lecture on the “Comic Writers.” Most of the matter had

D’Arblay’s “Wanderer.” (See Works, X, 25-44.) In “A Farewell to
Essay-Writing” (Works, XII, 327) Hazlitt harks back to his days with
Charles and Mary Lamb: “I will not compare our hashed mutton with
Amelia’s; but it put us in mind of it, and led to a discussion, sharply
seasoned and well sustained, till midnight, the result of which appeared
some years after in the Edinburgh Review.”

They are thoroughly English. In the review of Walpole’s Letters (Works,
X, 168), Hazlitt says: “There is nothing of a tea inspiration in any of
his [Fielding’s] novels. They are assuredly the finest thing of the kind
in the language; and we are Englishmen enough to consider them the best in
any language. They are indubitably the most English of all the works of Englishmen.”
Hogarth, William (1697-1764), painter and engraver of moral and
satirical subjects. His two most famous series of paintings are “The
Rake’s Progress” and “Marriage à la Mode.” Lamb in his “Essay on the
Genius and Character of Hogarth” observes: “Other pictures we look
at,—his prints we read.” Hazlitt, sharing this view, includes an account
of Hogarth in the seventh lecture of the “Comic Writers,” which opens as
follows: “If the quantity of amusement, or of matter for more serious
reflection which their works have afforded, is that by which we are to
judge of precedence among the intellectual benefactors of mankind, there
are, perhaps, few persons who can put in a stronger claim to our gratitude
than Hogarth. It is not hazarding too much to assert, that he was one of
the greatest comic geniuses that ever lived.”

Grandison does or says all through the book from liking to any person or
object but himself, and with a view to answer to a certain standard of
perfection for which he pragmatically sets up. He is always thinking of
himself, and trying to show that he is the wisest, happiest, and most
virtuous person in the whole world. He is (or would be thought) a code of
Christian ethics; a compilation and abstract of all gentlemanly
accomplishments. There is nothing, I conceive, that excites so little
sympathy as this inordinate egotism; or so much disgust as this
everlasting self-complacency. Yet this self-admiration, brought forward on
every occasion as the incentive to every action and reflected from all
around him, is the burden and pivot of the story.”

P. 178. All the great changes. Cf. Morley’s “Life of Burke,” ch. 8: “All
really profound speculation about society comes in time to touch the heart
of every other object of speculation, not by directly contributing new
truths or directly corroborating old ones, but by setting men to consider
the consequences to life of different opinions on these abstract subjects,
and their relations to the great[Pg 384] paramount interests of society, however
those interests may happen at the time to be conceived. Burke’s book marks
a turning-point in literary history, because it was the signal for that
reaction over the whole field of thought, into which the Revolution drove
many of the finest minds of the next generation, by showing the supposed
consequences of pure individualistic rationalism.”

He was one of the severest writers we have. The description of Burke’s
style which follows should be compared with that given on pp. 344-5 and
with the splendid passage in the “Plain Speaker” essay “On the Prose Style
of Poets,” beginning: “It has always appeared to me that the most perfect
prose-style, the most powerful, the most dazzling, the most daring, that
which went the nearest to the verge of poetry, and yet never fell over,
was Burke’s. It has the solidity, and sparkling effect of the diamond; all
other fine writing is like French paste or Bristol-stones in the
comparison. Burke’s style is airy, flighty, adventurous, but it never
loses sight of the subject; nay, is always in contact with, and derives
its increased or varying impulse from it. It may be said to pass yawning
gulfs ‘on the unsteadfast footing of a spear:’ still it has an actual
resting-place and tangible support under it—it is not suspended on
nothing. It differs from poetry, as I conceive, like the chamois from the
eagle: it climbs to an almost equal height, touches upon a cloud,
overlooks a precipice, is picturesque, sublime—but all the while, instead
of soaring through the air, it stands upon a rocky cliff, clambers up by
abrupt and intricate ways, and browzes on the roughest bark, or crops the tender flower.”

P. 188. Fox, Charles James (1749-1806), the famous Whig statesman who
was frequently the opponent of Burke and of the younger Pitt.
P. 189. Dr. Johnson observed, in his “Life of Pope” (ed. Birkbeck Hill,
III, 230): “In their similes the greatest writers have sometimes failed;
the ship-race, compared with the chariot-race, is neither illustrated nor
aggrandised; land and water make all the difference: when Apollo running
after Daphne is likened to a greyhound chasing a hare, there is nothing
gained; the ideas of pursuit and flight are too plain to be made plainer,
and a god and the daughter of a god are not represented much to their
advantage by a hare and a dog.”
a person. Conjecturally Joseph Fawcett. In the essay “On Criticism”
(“Table Talk”) Hazlitt says: “The person of the most refined and least
contracted taste I ever knew was the late Joseph Fawcett, the friend of my
youth. He was almost the first literary acquaintance I ever made, and I
think the most candid and unsophisticated. He had a masterly perception of
all styles and of every kind and degree of excellence, sublime or
beautiful, from Milton’s Paradise Lost to Shenstone’s Pastoral Ballad,
from Butler’s Analogy down to Humphrey Clinker.”

So prayed, more gaining than he asked, the Bard—

P. 198. The Excursion. Hazlitt wrote a review of this poem for the
Examiner which not only aroused Wordsworth’s resentment but led to one of
his disagreements with Lamb. The review appears in the “Round Table.”

king, who, on being reproved by his confessor for faithlessness to his
wife, punished the offender by causing him to be fed on nothing but his
favorite dish, which was partridge. See Notes and Queries, Series IV, Vol.
III, p. 336.
In his person. In 1803, while on a visit to the Lake Country, Hazlitt
had painted a portrait of Wordsworth. “He has painted Wordsworth,” writes
Southey, “but so dismally, though[Pg 387] Wordsworth’s face is his idea of
physiognomical perfection, that one of his friends, on seeing it,
exclaimed, ‘At the gallows—deeply affected by his deserved fate—yet
determined to die like a man;’ and if you saw the picture, you would
admire the criticism.” “Life and Correspondence,” II, 238.

a tragedy. “The Borderers” was written in 1795-96 but not published till
1842. The quotation which follows is from Act iii, 1, 405, and should read:

“Action is transitory—a step, a blow,
The motion of a muscle—this way or that—
’Tis done, and in the after-vacancy
We wonder at ourselves like men betrayed;
Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark,
And shares the nature of infinity.”
Wordsworth quoted these lines after the dedication to “The White Doe of
Rylstone” and later added a note: “This and the five lines that follow
were either read or recited by me more than thirty years since, to the
late Mr. Hazlitt, who quoted some expressions in them (imperfectly
remembered) in a work of his published several years ago.”
P. 201. Let observation. Cf. De Quincey’s “Rhetoric” (Works, ed. Masson,
X, 128): “We recollect a little biographic sketch of Dr. Johnson,
published immediately after his death, in which, among other instances of
desperate tautology, the author quotes the well-known lines from the
Doctor’s imitation of Juvenal—‘Let observation,’ etc., and contends with
some reason that this is saying in effect,—‘Let observation with
extensive observation observe mankind extensively.’” Coleridge somewhere
makes the same remark.

Walton’s Angler. In the fifth lecture of the “English Poets”[Pg 388] Hazlitt
writes: “Perhaps the best pastoral in the language is that prose-poem,
Walton’s Complete Angler. That well-known work has a beauty and romantic
interest equal to its simplicity, and arising out of it. In the
description of a fishing-tackle, you perceive the piety and humanity of
the author’s mind. It is to be doubted whether Sannazarius’s Piscatory
Eclogues are equal to the scenes described by Walton on the banks of the
river Lea. He gives the feeling of the open air: we walk with him along
the dusty roadside, or repose on the banks of a river under a shady tree;
and in watching for the finny prey, imbibe what he beautifully calls ‘the
patience and simplicity of poor honest fishermen.’ We accompany them to
their inn at night, and partake of their simple, but delicious fare; while
Maud, the pretty milkmaid, at her mother’s desire, sings the classical
ditties of the poet Marlow; ‘Come live with me, and be my love.’”
Paley, William (1743-1805), a noted theologian. Cf. “On the Clerical
Character” in “Political Essays” (Works, III, 276): “This same shuffling
divine is the same Dr. Paley, who afterwards employed the whole of his
life, and his moderate second-hand abilities, in tampering with religion,
morality, and politics,—in trimming between his convenience and his
conscience,—in crawling between heaven and earth, and trying to cajole
both. His celebrated and popular work on Moral Philosophy, is celebrated
and popular for no other reason, than that it is a somewhat ingenious and
amusing apology for existing abuses of any description, by which any thing
is to be got. It is a very elaborate and consolatory elucidation of the
text, that men should not quarrel with their bread and butter. It is not
an attempt to show what is right, but to palliate and find out plausible
excuses for what is wrong. It is a work without the least value, except as
a convenient commonplace book or vade mecum, for tyro politicians and
young divines, to smooth their progress in the Church or the State. This
work is a text-book in the University: its morality is the acknowledged
morality of the House of Commons.” See also Coleridge’s opinion of Paley on p. 288.
Bewick, Thomas (1753-1828), a well-known wood-engraver.
Waterloo, Antoine (1609?-1676?), a French engraver, painter, and etcher.
Rembrandt, Harmans van Rijn (1606-1669.), Dutch painter, whose mastery
of light and shade was the object of Hazlitt’s special admiration.

See the lecture “On the Living[Pg 389]

conchology; he hates Voltaire; he hates Sir Isaac Newton; he hates wisdom;
he hates wit; he hates metaphysics, which he says are unintelligible, and
yet he would be thought to understand them; he hates prose; he hates all
poetry but his own; he hates the dialogues in Shakespeare; he hates music,
dancing, and painting; he hates Rubens, he hates Rembrandt; he hates
Raphael, he hates Titian; he hates Vandyke; he hates the antique; he hates

goes sounding. “Hazlitt seems to have had a hazy recollection of two
passages in Chaucer’s Prologue. In his essay on ‘My First Acquaintance
with Poets,’ he says, ‘the scholar in Chaucer is described as going
“sounding on his way,”’ and in his Lectures on the English Poets he
says, ‘the merchant, as described in Chaucer, went on his way “sounding
always the increase of his winning.”’ The scholar is not described as
‘sounding on his way,’ but Chaucer says of him, ‘Souninge in moral vertu
was his speche,’ while the merchant, though ‘souninge alway th’ encrees of
his winning,’ is not described as going on his way. Wordsworth has a line
(‘Excursion,’ Book III), ‘Went sounding on a dim and perilous way,’ but it
seems clear that Hazlitt thought he was quoting Chaucer.” Waller-Glover, IV, 412.

an infinite number of independent substances or monads related to each
other in such a way (by the pre-established harmony) as to form one
universe. Cf. Coleridge’s “Destiny of Nations,” 38 ff.:

“Others boldlier think
That as one body seems the aggregate
Of atoms numberless, each organized;
So by a strange and dim similitude
Infinite myriads of self-conscious minds
Are an all-conscious spirit, which informs
With absolute ubiquity of thought
(His own eternal self-affirming act!)
All his involved Monads, that yet seem
With various province and apt agency
Each to pursue its own self-centering end.”

Proclus (410-485) and Plotinus (204-270), philosophers of the
Neo-Platonic school. In “Biographia Literaria” (chap. 9) Coleridge refers
to his “early study of Plato and of Plotinus, with the commentaries and
the ‘Theologia Platonica’ of the illustrious Florentine; of Proclus, and Gemistius Pletho.”
Duns Scotus (1265 or 1275-1308) and Thomas Aquinas (1227-1274), two great theologians of the Catholic Church.
Jacob Behmen or Böhme (1575-1624), a German religious mystic who exerted
considerable influence on English religious thought in the eighteenth
century. In the “Biographia Literaria” (chap. 9) Coleridge writes: “A meek
and shy quietist, his intellectual powers were never stimulated into
feverous energy by crowds of proselytes, or by the ambition of
proselyting. Jacob Behmen was an enthusiast in the strictest sense, as not
merely distinguished, but as contradistinguished from a fanatic.... The
writings of these Mystics acted in no slight degree to prevent my mind
from being imprisoned within the outline of any single dogmatic system.”

the glad prose of Jeremy Taylor. Cf. “Literature of the Age of
Elizabeth,” Lecture VII: “In his writings, the frail stalk of human life
reclines on the bosom of eternity. His Holy Living and Dying is a divine
pastoral. He writes to the faithful followers of Christ, as the shepherd
pipes to his flock. He introduces touching and heartfelt appeals to
familiar life; condescends to men of low estate; and his pious page
blushes with modesty and beauty. His style is prismatic. It unfolds the
colours of the rainbow; it floats like the bubble through the air; it is
like innumerable dew-drops that glitter on the face of morning, and
tremble as they glitter. He does not dig his way underground, but slides
upon ice, borne on the winged car of fancy. The dancing light he throws
upon objects is like an Aurora Borealis, playing betwixt heaven[Pg 393] and
earth.... In a word, his writings are more like fine poetry than any other
prose whatever; they are a choral song in praise of virtue, and a hymn to
the Spirit of the Universe.”
Bowles, William Lisle (1762-1850), published “Fourteen Sonnets” in 1789,
and a second edition containing twenty-one in the same year. In the first
chapter of the “Biographia Literaria,” Coleridge credits the sonnets of
Bowles with saving him from a premature absorption in metaphysics and
theology and with introducing him to the excellences of the new school of
poetry. In his enthusiasm he went about making proselytes for Bowles and
“as my school finances did not permit me to purchase copies, I made,
within less than a year and a half, more than forty transcriptions, as the
best presents I could offer to those, who had in any way won my regard.
And with almost equal delight did I receive the three or four following
publications of the same author.” Coleridge also addressed a “Sonnet to Bowles,” opening

“My heart hath thanked thee, Bowles! for those soft strains,
That on the still air floating tremblingly,
Wak’d in me Fancy, Love, and Sympathy!”
P. 212. John Bull. Croker’s John Bull was a scurrilous newspaper edited
by Theodore Hook, the first number of which appeared December 17, 1820.
Mr. Croker, John Wilson (1780-1857), politician and man of letters, one
of Hazlitt’s pet aversions, and the same who comes in for such a severe
chastisement in Macaulay’s review of his edition of Boswell’s “Johnson.”
Junius, the mysterious author of a famous series of political letters
which appeared in the London Public Advertiser from January 21, 1769, to
January 21, 1772, collected as the “Letters of Junius” in 1772. The name
of Sir Philip Francis is the one most persistently associated with the composition of these letters.
Godwin, William (1756-1836), leader of the philosophical radicals in
England and a believer in the perfectibility of man, wrote “An Enquiry
concerning Political Justice” (1793), “Caleb Williams” (1794), and other
novels and miscellaneous works. Godwin was the husband of Mary
Wolstonecraft, and the father-in-law of Shelley. Hazlitt wrote a sketch of
him in the “Spirit of the Age” and reviewed his last novel, “Cloudesley,”
in the Edinburgh Review. Coleridge has a Sonnet to William Godwin:

“Nor will I not thy holy guidance bless,
And hymn thee, Godwin! with an ardent lay;
[Pg 394]For that thy voice, in Passion’s stormy day
When wild I roam’d the bleak Heath of Distress,
Bade the bright form of Justice meet my way—
And told me that her name was Happiness.”

wandered into Germany. Coleridge’s visit to Germany and his introduction
to the leading German philosophers dates back to 1798-99.
Kantean philosophy. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was the leader of modern
philosophy. “The writings of the illustrious sage of Königsberg, the
founder of the Critical Philosophy, more than any other work, at once
invigorated and disciplined my understanding. The originality, the depth,
and the compression of the thoughts; the novelty and subtlety, yet
solidity and importance of the distinctions; the adamantine chain of the
logic; and I will venture to add—(paradox as it will appear to those who
have taken their notion of Immanuel Kant from Reviewers and
Frenchmen)—the clearness and evidence, of the Critique of Pure Reason;
and Critique of the Judgment; of the Metaphysical Elements of Natural
Philosophy; and of his Religion within the bounds of Pure Reason, took
possession of me as with a giant’s hand. After fifteen years’ familiarity
with them, I still read these and all his other productions with
undiminished delight and increasing admiration.” “Biographia Literaria,” chap. IX.
Fichte, J. Gottlieb (1762-1814). “Fichte’s Wissenschaftslehre, or Lore
of Ultimate Science, was to add the key-stone of the arch” of Kant’s system. Ibid.
Schelling, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph (1775-1829). “In Schelling’s
Natur-Philosophie, and the System des Transcendentalen Idealismus, I
first found a genial coincidence with much that I had toiled out for
myself, and a powerful assistance in what I had yet[Pg 395] to do.... Many of the
most striking resemblances, indeed all the main and fundamental ideas,
were born and matured in my mind before I had ever seen a single page of
the German Philosopher; and I might indeed affirm with truth, before the
most important works of Schelling had been written, or at least made
public. Nor is this coincidence at all to be wondered at. We had studied
in the same school; been disciplined by the same preparatory philosophy,
namely, the writings of Kant; we had both equal obligations to the polar
logic and dynamic philosophy of Giordano Bruno; and Schelling has lately,
and, as of recent acquisition, avowed that same affectionate reverence for
the labors of Behmen, and other mystics, which I had formed at a much earlier period.” Ibid.

authorship of this review has been disputed but should on internal
evidence, despite its failure in appreciation, be ascribed to Hazlitt. See Works, XI, 580-582.

The sketch in the Spirit of the Age concludes with a contrast between Coleridge and William Godwin.
 
This selection forms the conclusion of a sketch of Southey in the “Spirit
of the Age.” It illustrates, even more strikingly than the “Character of
Burke,” Hazlitt’s power of dissociating his judgments from his prejudices,
inasmuch as there had been exchanges of rancorous personalities between
the two men.

Poets,” Hazlitt elaborates his theory that poets turned out inferior
prose. “I have but an indifferent opinion of the prose-style of poets: not
that it is not sometimes good, nay, excellent; but it is never the better,
and generally the worse from the habit of writing verse.”

and lives of Wesley, Cowper, and Nelson. He translated from the Spanish
the romances of “Amadis of Gaul,” “Palmerin of England,” and “The Cid.”
P. 219. Pindaric or Shandean, i.e., whimsical. Pindaric should of course
be understood as a reference to Peter Pindar, the name under which John
Wolcot (1738-1819) wrote his coarse and whimsical satires. Hazlitt
mentions him at the end of his lectures “On the Comic Writers”: “The bard
in whom the nation and the king delighted, is old and blind, but still
merry and wise:—remembering how he has made the world laugh in his time,
and not[Pg 397] repenting of the mirth he has given; with an involuntary smile
lighted up at the mad pranks of his Muse, and the lucky hits of his pen.”
Shandean is derived from Sterne’s novel, “Tristram Shandy.”

his political inconsistency. This is the subject of Hazlitt’s attacks on
Southey. See “Political Essays” (Works, III, 109-120, 192-232).
 
The last essay in the “Spirit of the Age” is entitled “Elia and Geoffrey
Crayon.” An edition published at Paris by Galignani in 1825 omits the
account of Washington Irving, and this text, as it is in all respects
unexceptionable, has been here adopted for the sake of coherence. In a
letter to Bernard Barton, February 10, 1825, Lamb refers to Hazlitt’s
sketch: “He has laid too many colours on my likeness, but I have had so
much injustice done me in my own name, that I make a rule of accepting as
much over-measure to ‘Elia’ as Gentlemen think proper to bestow.”

Mr. Lamb rather affects. Hazlitt had Lamb in his eye when he described
the Occult School in the essay “On Criticism” (“Table Talk”): “There is
another race of critics who might be designated as the Occult
School—verè adepti. They discern no beauties but what are concealed from
superficial eyes, and overlook all that are obvious to the vulgar part of
mankind. Their art is the transmutation of styles. By happy alchemy of
mind they convert dross into gold—and gold into tinsel. They see farther
into a millstone than most others. If an author is utterly unreadable,
they can read him for ever: his intricacies are their delight, his
mysteries are their study. They prefer Sir Thomas Brown to the Rambler by
Dr. Johnson, and Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy to all the writers of the
Georgian Age. They judge of works of genius as misers do of hid
treasure—it is of no value unless they have it all to themselves. They
will no more share a book than a mistress with a friend. If[Pg 398] they
suspected their favourite volumes of delighting any eyes but their own,
they would immediately discard them from the list. Theirs are
superannuated beauties that every one else has left off intriguing with,
bed-ridden hags, a ‘stud of night-mares.’ This is not envy or affectation,
but a natural proneness to singularity, a love of what is odd and out of
the way. They must come at their pleasures with difficulty, and support
admiration by an uneasy sense of ridicule and opposition. They despise
those qualities in a work which are cheap and obvious. They like a
monopoly of taste, and are shocked at the prostitution of intellect
implied in popular productions. In like manner, they would chuse a friend
or recommend a mistress for gross defects; and tolerate the sweetness of
an actress’s voice only for the ugliness of her face. Pure pleasures are
in their judgment cloying and insipid—
‘An ounce of sour is worth a pound of sweet!’
Nothing goes down with them but what is caviare to the multitude. They
are eaters of olives and readers of black-letter. Yet they smack of
genius, and would be worth any money, were it only for the rarity of the thing!”

a certain writer. Hazlitt himself. It is known to everybody that the
friendship of Lamb for Hazlitt suffered certain strains, and various
attempts have been made to guess at the provocations. Mutual
recriminations in regard to literary borrowings have been thought to be
responsible for more than one breach. So Mr. Bertram Dobell, in his
“Sidelights on Lamb,” 212-14, imagines that the mystery is solved in a
letter of Hazlitt’s to the editor of the London Magazine (April 12, 1820)
charging Lamb with appropriating his ideas: “Do you keep the Past and
Future? You see Lamb argues the same view of the subject. That ‘young
master’ will anticipate all my discoveries if I don’t mind.” The
similarity of idea between Hazlitt’s “Past and Future” and Lamb’s “New
Year’s Eve,” and the appearance in Lamb’s essay of the phrase “young
masters” makes it clear enough what Hazlitt is referring to, but that
either man should have taken the matter very seriously is hard to believe.
It is easier to look upon Hazlitt’s expression as banter of the same kind
that Lamb allowed himself[Pg 399] in connection with the essay on “Guy Faux”
alluded to in the present sketch. This subject had been proposed by Lamb,
as we are informed in “Of Persons One Would Wish to Have Seen,” and had
been written up by Hazlitt in the Examiner in 1821 (Works, XI, 317-334).
Two years later Lamb contributed a paper on the same subject to the London
Magazine, founded partly on an essay in the Reflector (1811), entitled “On
the Probable Effects of the Gunpowder Treason.” The essay in the London
Magazine (Lamb’s Works, ed. Lucas, I, 236 ff.) opens with a facetious
thrust at Hazlitt: “A very ingenious and subtle writer, whom there is good
reason for suspecting to be an ex-Jesuit, not unknown at Douay some
five-and-twenty years since (he will not obtrude himself at M—th again in
a hurry), about a twelvemonth back, set himself to prove the character of
the Powder Plot conspirators to have been that of heroic self-devotedness
and true Christian martyrdom. Under the mask of Protestant candour, he
actually gained admission for his treatise into a London weekly paper, not
particularly distinguished for its zeal towards either religion. But,
admitting Catholic principles, his arguments are shrewd and
incontrovertible. [Then follows a quotation from Hazlitt setting forth the
Catholic standpoint.] It is impossible, upon Catholic principles, not to
admit the force of this reasoning; we can only not help smiling (with the
writer) at the simplicity of the gulled editor, swallowing the dregs of
Loyola for the very quintessence of sublimated reason in England at the
commencement of the nineteenth century. We will just, as a contrast, show
what we Protestants (who are a party concerned) thought upon the same
subject, at a period rather nearer to the heroic project in question.”
This is the kind of resentment we would expect Lamb to show at the
appropriation of his ideas. That there were not wanting grounds for real
grievance against Hazlitt may be gathered from a letter to Wordsworth,
September 23, 1816 (Lamb’s Works, ed. Lucas, VI, 491): “There was a cut at
me a few months back by the same hand.... It was a pretty compendium of
observation, which the author has collected in my disparagement, from some
hundred of social evenings which we had spent together,—however in spite
of all, there is something tough in my attachment to H—— which these
violent strainings cannot quite dislocate or sever asunder. I get no
conversation in London that is absolutely worth attending to but his.” To
one of his quarrels with Lamb Hazlitt owes the finest compliment he ever
received, and happily it marks the termination[Pg 400] of all differences between
them. It occurs in the well-known “Letter of Elia to Robert Southey” which
Lamb published in the London Magazine when Southey reproached him with his
friendship for Hazlitt (Works, I, 233): “I stood well with him for fifteen
years (the proudest of my life), and have ever spoke my full mind of him
to some, to whom his panegyric must naturally be least tasteful. I never
in thought swerved from him, I never betrayed him, I never slackened in my
admiration for him, I was the same to him (neither better nor worse)
though he could not see it, as in the days when he thought fit to trust
me. At this instant, he may be preparing for me some compliment, above my
deserts, as he has sprinkled many such among his admirable books, for
which I rest his debtor; or, for any thing I know, or can guess to the
contrary, he may be about to read a lecture on my weaknesses. He is
welcome to them (as he was to my humble hearth), if they can divert a
spleen, or ventilate a fit of sullenness. I wish he would not quarrel with
the world at the rate he does; but the reconciliation must be effected by
himself, and I despair of living to see that day. But, protesting against
much that he has written, and some things he chooses to do; judging him by
his conversation which I enjoyed so long, and relished so deeply; or by
his books, in those places where no clouding passion intervenes—I should
belie my own conscience, if I said less, than that I think W. H. to be, in
his natural and healthy state, one of the wisest and finest spirits
breathing. So far from being ashamed of that intimacy, which was betwixt
us, it is my boast that I was able for so many years to have preserved it
entire; and I think I shall go to my grave without finding, or expecting
to find, such another companion.”
Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy was published in 1621. Its quaint prose
was often imitated by Lamb and had a direct effect on his style.
Sir Thomas Browne (1605-1682), physician and essayist, author of

Parnell, Thomas (1679-1717). In the sixth lecture on the “English Poets”
Hazlitt says: “Parnell, though a good-natured,[Pg 401] easy man, and a friend to
poets and the Muses, was himself little more than an occasional versifier.”
Gay, John (1685-1732), is best known by his “Beggar’s Opera” (1728) and
“Fables” (1727 and 1738). Hazlitt writes of Gay in the sixth lecture on
the “English Poets” and has a paper on “The Beggar’s Opera” in the “Round
Table.”
His taste in French and German. Cf. “On Old English Writers and
Speakers” in the “Plain Speaker”: “Mr. Lamb has lately taken it into his
head to read St. Evremont, and works of that stamp. I neither praise nor
blame him for it. He observed, that St. Evremont was a writer half-way
between Montaigne and Voltaire, with a spice of the wit of the one and the
sense of the other. I said I was always of the opinion that there had been
a great many clever people in the world, both in France and England, but I
had been sometimes rebuked for it. Lamb took this as a slight reproach;
for he had been a little exclusive and national in his tastes.”

This selection forms the latter half of the sketch of Scott in the “Spirit
of the Age.” The following dialogue between Northcote and Hazlitt,
“Conversations of Northcote,” XVI, represents Hazlitt’s feelings for
Scott: “N. ‘You don’t know him, do you? He’d be a pattern to you. Oh! he
has a very fine manner. You would learn to rub off some of your
asperities. But you admire him, I believe.’ H. ‘Yes; on this side of
idolatry and Toryism.’ N. ‘That is your prejudice.’ H. ‘Nay, it rather
shows my liberality, if I am a devoted enthusiast notwithstanding. There
are two things I admire[Pg 402] in Sir Walter, his capacity and his simplicity;
which indeed I am apt to think are much the same.’”

P. 242. Lord Byron does not exhibit a new view of nature. In the paper
on “Pope, Lord Byron and Mr. Bowles,” Hazlitt’s tone is more generous:
“His Lordship likes the poetry, the imaginative part of art, and so do
we.... He likes the sombre part of it, the thoughtful, the decayed, the
ideal, the spectral shadow of human greatness, the departed spirit of
human power. He sympathizes[Pg 404] not with art as a display of ingenuity, as
the triumph of vanity or luxury, as it is connected with the idiot,
superficial, petty self-complacency of the individual and the moment
(these are to him not ‘luscious as locusts, but bitter as coloquintida’);
but he sympathizes with the triumphs of Time and Fate over the proudest
works of man—with the crumbling monuments of human glory—with the dim
vestiges and countless generations of men—with that which claims alliance
with the grave, or kindred with the elements of nature.” Works, XI, 496.

great obligation, the flattering proposal of Lord Byron to prefix my name

more Rarenesse and more vnexpected and alternatiue Variations: So as it
appeareth that Poesie serueth and conferreth to Magnanimitie, Moralitie,
and to delectation. And therefore it was euer thought to haue some

To be discarded thence! The first edition at this point adds: “This is
like that fine stroke of pathos in ‘Paradise Lost,’ where Milton makes
Adam say to Eve,
‘Should God create another Eve, and I
Another rib afford, yet loss of thee
Would never from my heart!’”
Impassioned poetry is an emanation of the moral and intellectual part of
our nature. Cf. “On People of Sense” in “Plain Speaker”: “Poetry acts by
sympathy with nature, that is, with the natural impulses, customs, and
imaginations of men, and is, on that account, always popular, delightful,
and at the same time instructive. It is nature moralizing and idealizing
for us; inasmuch as, by shewing us things as they are, it implicitly
teaches us what they ought to be; and the grosser feelings, by passing
through the strainers of this imaginary, wide-extended experience, acquire
an involuntary tendency to higher objects. Shakspeare was, in this sense,
not only one of the greatest poets, but one of the greatest moralists that
we have. Those who read him are the happier, better, and wiser for it.”
Moore, Edward (1712-1757), author of “The Gamester” (1753).
P. 259. As Mr. Burke observes, in “A Philosophical Enquiry into the
Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful,” Part I, Section 15:
“Choose a day on which to represent the most sublime and affecting tragedy
we have; appoint the most favourite actors; spare no cost upon the scenes
and decorations; unite the greatest efforts of poetry, painting, and
music; and when you have collected your audience, just at the moment when
their minds are erect with expectation, let it be reported that a state
criminal of high rank is on the point of being executed in the adjoining
square; in a moment the emptiness of the theatre would demonstrate the
comparative weakness of the imitative arts, and proclaim the triumph of the real sympathy.”

“Wordsworth’s Excursion” in the “Round Table” with the change of poetic

(‘Letters,’ ed. Tovey I, 7-8). The lines are apparently a translation by
Gray of Virgil, ‘Æneid,’ VI, 282-84.” Waller-Glover, XII, 504.

Macbeth ... for the sake of the music. Some copies of the first edition
misprint Macheath, the name of the leading character in Gay’s “Beggar’s
Opera.” In writing “On Commonplace Critics,” in the “Round Table,” Hazlitt
represents the commonplace critic as questioning whether any one of
Shakespeare’s plays, “if brought out now for the first time, would
succeed. He thinks that ‘Macbeth’ would be the most likely, from the music
which has been introduced into it.” The reference is to the music written
for D’Avenant’s version of the play, produced in 1672. According to
Waller-Glover (I, 436), “this music, traditionally assigned to Matthew
Locke, is now attributed to Purcell”; but Furness, in the Variorum edition
of “Macbeth,” accepts the conclusion of Chappell in Grove’s “Dictionary of
Music,” “that Purcell could not have been the composer of a work which
appeared when he was in his fourteenth year,” especially as “the only
reason that can be assigned why modern musicians should have doubted
Locke’s authorship is that a manuscript of it exists in the handwriting of Henry Purcell.”

except poets. Cf. “On the Prose Style of Poets” in the “Plain Speaker”:
“What is a little extraordinary, there is a want of rhythmus and cadence
in what they write without the help of metrical rules. Like persons who
have been accustomed to sing to music, they are at a loss in the absence
of the habitual accompaniment and guide to their judgment. Their style
halts, totters, is loose, disjointed, and without expressive pauses or
rapid movements. The measured cadence and regular sing-song of rhyme or
blank verse have destroyed, as it were, their natural ear for the mere
characteristic harmony which ought to subsist between the sound and the
sense. I should almost guess the Author of Waverley to be a writer of
ambling verses from the desultory vacillation and want of firmness in the
march of his style. There is neither momentum nor elasticity in it; I
mean as to the score, or effect upon the ear. He has improved since in
his other works: to be sure, he has had practice enough. Poets either get
into this incoherent, undetermined, shuffling style, made up of
‘unpleasing flats and sharps,’ of unaccountable starts and pauses, of
doubtful odds and ends, flirted about like straws in a gust of wind; or,
to avoid it and steady themselves, mount into a sustained and measured
prose (like the translation of Ossian’s Poems, or some parts of
Shaftesbury’s Characteristics) which is more odious still, and as bad as
being at sea in a calm.” Hazlitt’s views on this question are peculiar,
though his examples are well chosen. The more common opinion is that
voiced by Coleridge in his remarks “On Style”: “It is, indeed, worthy of
remark that all our great poets have been good prose writers, as Chaucer,
Spenser, Milton; and this probably arose from their just sense of metre.
For a true poet will never confound verse and prose; whereas it is almost
characteristic of indifferent prose writers that they should be constantly
slipping into scraps of metre.” Works, IV, 342.
P. 268. Addison’s Campaign (1705), written in honor of Marlborough’s
victory at Blenheim, was described as “that gazette in rhyme” by Joseph
Warton (1722-1800) in his “Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope,” I, 29.
Chaucer. Cf. A. W. Pollard’s “Chaucer,” p. 35: “To Boccaccio’s ‘Teseide’
and ‘Filostrato,’ he was indebted for something more than the groundwork
of two of his most important poems; and he was also acquainted with three
of his works in Latin prose. If, as is somewhat hardily maintained, he
also knew the Decamerone,[Pg 409] and took from it, in however improved a
fashion, the idea of his Canterbury Pilgrimage and the plots of any or all
of the four tales (besides that of Grisilde) to which resemblances have
been traced in his own work, his obligations to Boccaccio become immense.
Yet he never mentions his name, and it has been contended that he was
himself unaware of the authorship of the poems and treatises to which he was so greatly indebted.”

Ossian. James Macpherson (1736-1796) published between 1760 and 1765
what he alleged to be a translation of the ancient Gaelic hero-bard, Oisin
or Ossian. The poems fed the romantic appetite of the generation and were
translated into practically every European language. In Germany especially
the influence of “Ossian” wrought powerfully through the enthusiasm it
aroused in the young Goethe and in Schiller. In England, the poems,
immediately upon their appearance, gave rise to a long controversy as to
their authenticity, Dr. Johnson being among the first to attack the
belief[Pg 410] in their antiquity. The truth seems to be that, though there
really is a legendary hero answering to Ossian, no such poems as
Macpherson attributed to him were ever transmitted. The whole work is to
all intents the original creation of Macpherson himself. The supposed
Gaelic originals, which were published by the Highland Society of London
in 1807, have been proved by philologists to be spurious, to be nothing in
fact but translations into bad Gaelic from Macpherson’s good English. This
conclusion is further supported by the mass of borrowings from the Bible
and the classics which have been found in “Ossian.” See J. C. Smart:

“In the library of the family where we were brought up, stood the Fratres
Poloni; and we can never forget or describe the feeling with which not
only their appearance, but the names of the authors on the outside
inspired us. Pripscovius, we remember, was one of the easiest to
pronounce. The gravity of the contents seemed in proportion to the weight
of the volumes; the importance of the subjects increased with our
ignorance of them.”

the French Revolution and its English Admirers against the Accusations of
the Right Hon. Edmund Burke.” Hazlitt writes of Mackintosh in the “Spirit
of the Age” as “one of the ablest and most accomplished men of the age,
both as a writer, a speaker, and a converser,” and comparing him with
Coleridge, he remarks, “They have nearly an equal range of reading and of
topics of conversation; but in the mind of the one we see nothing but
fixtures, in the other every thing is fluid.”

Conversation of Authors”: “Coleridge withholds his tribute of[Pg 412] applause
from every person, in whom any mortal but himself can descry the least
glimpse of understanding. He would be thought to look farther into a
millstone than any body else. He would have others see with his eyes, and
take their opinions from him on trust, in spite of their senses. The more
obscure and defective the indications of merit, the greater his sagacity
and candour in being the first to point them out. He looks upon what he
nicknames a man of genius, but as the breath of his nostrils, and the
clay in the potter’s hands. If any such inert, unconscious mass, under the
fostering care of the modern Prometheus, is kindled into life,—begins to
see, speak, and move, so as to attract the notice of other people,—our
jealous patroniser of latent worth in that case throws aside, scorns, and
hates his own handy-work; and deserts his intellectual offspring from the
moment they can go alone and shift for themselves.”

P. 288. I sat down to the task, etc. Cf. “On Application to Study”
(“Plain Speaker”): “If what I write at present is worth nothing, at least
it costs me nothing. But it cost me a great deal twenty years ago. I have
added little to my stock since then, and taken little from it. I ‘unfold
the book and volume of the brain,’ and transcribe the characters I see
there as mechanically as any one might copy the letters in a sampler. I do
not say they came there mechanically—I transfer them to the paper mechanically.” See also p. 345.

called by its opponents, ‘The Bridge Street Gang,’ founded in 1821 ‘to
support the laws for suppressing seditious publications, and for defending
the country from the fatal influence of disloyalty and sedition.’ The
Association was an ill-conducted party organisation and created so much
opposition by its imprudent prosecutions that it very soon disappeared.

P. 290. at Tewkesbury. In the essay “On Going a Journey,” Hazlitt refers
to this episode as occurring at Bridgewater: “I remember sitting up half
the night to read Paul and Virginia, which I picked up at an inn in
Bridgewater, after being drenched[Pg 413] in the rain all day; and at the same
place I got through two volumes of Madame D’Arblay’s Camilla.”

Monk Lewis. Matthew Gregory Lewis (1775-1818) wrote among other things a
sensational novel, “The Monk” (1795), which gained him his nickname. “The

popularity in the eighteenth century.
P. 298. since the days of Henry II. As Henry II lived in the twelfth
century, and as neither Coleridge nor Wordsworth ever refer to the
language of Henry II as their standard, the statement in the text may
probably be considered as a blunder of Hazlitt’s.
He spoke with contempt of Gray and with intolerance of Pope. Cf.
“Biographia Literaria,” ch. 2: “I felt almost as if I had been newly
couched, when, by Mr. Wordsworth’s conversation, I had[Pg 414] been induced to
re-examine with impartial strictness Gray’s celebrated Elegy. I had long
before detected the defects in The Bard; but the Elegy I had considered as
proof against all fair attacks; and to this day I can not read either
without delight, and a portion of enthusiasm. At all events whatever
pleasure I may have lost by the clearer perception of the faults in
certain passages, has been more than repaid to me by the additional
delight with which I read the remainder.” In his “Table Talk,” October 23,
1833, Coleridge says again: “I think there is something very majestic in
Gray’s Installation Ode; but as to the Bard and the rest of his lyrics, I
must say I think them frigid and artificial.” Of Pope and his followers he
writes (“Biographia Literaria,” ch. 1): “I was not blind to the merits of
this school, yet, as from inexperience of the world, and consequent want
of sympathy with the general subjects of these poems, they gave me little
pleasure, I doubtless undervalued the kind, and with the presumption of
youth withheld from its masters the legitimate name of poets. I saw that
the excellence of this kind consisted in just and acute observations on
men and manners in an artificial state of society, as its matter and
substance, and in the logic of wit, conveyed in smooth and strong
epigrammatic couplets, as its form; that even when the subject was
addressed to the fancy, or the intellect, as in the Rape of the Lock, or
the Essay on Man; nay, when it was a consecutive narration, as in that
astonishing product of matchless talent and ingenuity, Pope’s Translation
of the Iliad; still a point was looked for at the end of each second line,
and the whole was, as it were, a sorites, or, if I may exchange a
logical for a grammatical metaphor, a conjunction disjunctive, of
epigrams. Meantime, the matter and diction seemed to me characterized not
so much by poetic thoughts, as by thoughts translated into the language of poetry.”
he thought little of Junius as a writer. Cf. Coleridge’s “Table Talk,”
July 3, 1833: “The style of Junius is a sort of metre, the law of which is
a balance of thesis and antithesis. When he gets out of his aphorismic
metre into a sentence of five or six lines long, nothing can exceed the slovenliness of the English.”
dislike for Dr. Johnson. Cf. “Table Talk,” July 4, 1833: “Dr. Johnson’s
fame now rests principally upon Boswell. It is impossible not to be amused
with such a book. But his bow-wow manner must have had a good deal to do
with the effect produced.... As to Burke’s testimony to Johnson’s powers,
you must remember that Burke was a great courtier; and after all, Burke
said and[Pg 415] wrote more than once that he thought Johnson greater in talking
than in writing, and greater in Boswell than in real life.”
opinion of Burke. Cf. “Table Talk,” April 8, 1833: “Burke was indeed a
great man. No one ever read history so philosophically as he seems to have
done.... He would have been more influential if he had less surpassed his
contemporaries, as Fox and Pitt, men of much inferior minds, in all respects.”
He liked Richardson, but not Fielding. On this subject Coleridge
evidently changed his mind. Cf. “Table Talk,” July 5, 1834: “What a master
of composition Fielding was! Upon my word, I think the Œdipus Tyrannus,
the Alchemist, and Tom Jones the three most perfect plots ever planned.
And how charming, how wholesome, Fielding always is! To take him up after
Richardson is like emerging from a sickroom heated by stoves into an open lawn on a breezy day in May.”

This is the title of Essays III and IV of the “Plain Speaker.” Our
selection begins with the last paragraph of the first, which forms a
fitting introduction to the account of one of Lamb’s celebrated Wednesday
evenings. Lamb tells us that his sister was accustomed to read this essay
with unmixed delight.

of vocal and instrumental music, at which the greatest performers of the
day, even Handel, were to be heard.
And, in our flowing cups. Cf. “Henry V,” iv, 3, 51:

Be in their flowing cups freely remember’d.”

Hazlitt’s account of Raphael’s cartoons in “The Pictures at Hampton Court” (Works, IX, 43).
Donne, John (1573-1631), poet and divine. Hazlitt in the “Lectures on
the English Poets” confesses that he knows nothing of him save “some
beautiful verses to his wife, dissuading her from accompanying him on his
travels abroad (see p. 318), and some quaint riddles in verse, which the
Sphinx could not unravel.” V, 83.
P. 304. Ned P——. Edward Phillips. Lamb speaks of him as “that poor
card-playing Phillips, that has felt himself for so many years the outcast of Fortune.” (Works, ed. Lucas, VII, 972.)
Captain ——. Rear-Admiral James Burney (1750-1821), brother of Fanny
Burney the novelist, author of a “Chronological History of the Voyages and
Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean” in five volumes
(1803-1817). “The captain was himself a character, a fine, noble
creature—gentle, with a rough exterior, as became the associate of
Captain Cook in his voyages round the world, and the literary historian of
all these acts of circumnavigation.” Crabb-Robinson’s Diary, 1810.
Jem White. James White (1775-1820), of whom Lamb has left us a sketch in
the essay “On the Praise of Chimney-Sweepers”: “He carried away half the
fun of the world when he died.” He wrote, it is supposed with some
cooperation from Lamb, the “Original Letters, etc., of Sir John Falstaff
and his Friends” (1796), which were described by Lamb as “without
exception the best imitations I ever saw.” (Works, ed. Lucas, VI, 2.) A
review of this book by Lamb, consisting chiefly of specimens, appeared in
the Examiner in 1819 (Works, ed. Lucas, I, 191 ff).

in Lamb’s review of Falstaff’s Letters just mentioned (p. 194).
A——. William Aryton (1777-1858), a musical critic and director of the
King’s Theatre in the Haymarket. In the letter of Elia to Robert Southey
(Lamb’s Works, I, 230) he is spoken of as “the last and steadiest left me
of that little knot of whist-players, that used to assemble weekly, for so many years, at the Queen’s Gate.”
Mrs. R——-. Mrs. Reynolds, who had been Lamb’s schoolmistress.
M. B. Martin Charles Burney, son of Admiral Burney. “Martin Burney is as
odd as ever.... He came down here, and insisted on reading Virgil’s
‘Æneid’ all through with me (which[Pg 417] he did,) because a Counsel must know
Latin. Another time he read out all the Gospel of St. John, because
Biblical quotations are very emphatic in a Court of Justice. A third time,
he would carve a fowl, which he did very ill-favoredly, because ‘we did
not know how indispensable it was for a Barrister to do all those sort of
things well. Those little things were of more consequence than we
supposed.’ So he goes on, harassing about the way to prosperity, and
losing it. With a long head, but somewhat wrong one—harum-scarum. Why
does not his guardian angel look to him? He deserves one—: may be, he has
tired him out.” Lamb’s Works, VII, 855.

Those days are over! The event here referred to may be Waterloo. Mr.
Lucas thinks that Hazlitt’s share in Lamb’s gatherings “ceased after an
unfortunate discussion of Fanny Burney’s Wanderer, which Hazlitt condemned
in terms that her brother, the Admiral, could not forgive.” (Lamb’s Works,
I, 482.) It is likely that Mr. Lucas has been led astray by the statement
in Crabb-Robinson’s Diary to the effect that Hazlitt used to attend
Captain Burney’s whist-parties “till he affronted the Captain by severe
criticisms on the works of his sister,” presumably by his article in the
Edinburgh Review in 1814. Hazlitt commemorates Lamb’s evenings in the
“Pleasure of Hating” (“Plain Speaker”): “What is become of ‘that set of
whist players,’ celebrated by Elia in his notable Epistle to Robert
Southey, Esq. ... ‘that for so many years called Admiral Burney friend?’
They are scattered, like last year’s snow. Some of them are dead—or gone
to live at a distance—or pass one another in the street like strangers;
or if they stop to speak, do it as coolly and try to cut one another as
soon as possible. Some of us have grown rich—others poor. Some have got
places under Government—others a niche in the Quarterly Review. Some of
us have dearly earned a name in the world; whilst others remain in their
original privacy. We despise the one, and envy and are glad to mortify the other.”
Like angels’ visits. Cf. Blair’s “The Grave,” 582: “Like those of
angels, short and far between.” Hazlitt was fond of pointing out this
source for Campbell’s famous line “Like angels’ visits few and far
between,” and of insisting that the alteration spoiled the[Pg 418] sense. Thereby
he is said to have incurred Campbell’s bitter hostility.

Mr. Northcote, James (1746-1831), the painter of whose talk Hazlitt has
left an entertaining record in the “Conversations of James Northcote”
(1830), a book which inspired Crabb-Robinson to say, “I do not believe
that Boswell gives so much good talk in an equal quantity of his life of
Johnson.”
P. 308. Sir Joshua’s. Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), the famous English painter.
P. 309. Horne Tooke (1736-1812), politician and author of a celebrated
philological volume, “The Diversions of Purley” (1786, 1805). His portrait
is included in the “Spirit of the Age”: “He was without a rival (almost)
in private conversation, an expert public speaker, a keen politician, a
first-rate grammarian, and the finest gentleman (to say the least) of his
own party. He had no imagination (or he would not have scorned it!)—no
delicacy of taste, no rooted prejudices or strong attachments: his
intellect was like a bow of polished steel, from which he shot
sharp-pointed poisoned arrows at his friends in private, at his enemies in public.”

hack-writer and a friend of Lamb. He figures prominently in two of the
Essays of Elia, “Oxford in the Vacation” and “Amicus Redivivus,” and in
many of Lamb’s letters. “To G. D. a poem is a poem. His own as good as any
bodie’s, and god bless him, any bodie’s as good as his own, for I do not
think he has the most distant guess of the possibility of one poem being
better than another. The Gods by denying him the very faculty itself of
discrimination have effectually cut off every seed of envy in his bosom.”

Kit Marlowe (1564-1593), the most brilliant writer of tragedy before
Shakespeare. He wrote “Tamburlaine the Great,” “The Tragical History of
Dr. Faustus,” “The Jew of Malta,” and “Edward the Second.” In the “Age of
Elizabeth” Hazlitt says of him, “There is a lust of power in his writings,
a hunger and thirst after unrighteousness, a glow of the imagination,
unhallowed by any thing but its own energies.”
Webster, John, wrote during the first quarter of the seventeenth
century. His chief plays are “The White Devil” and the “Duchess of Malfy.”
Dekker, Thomas (c. 1570-1641). “The Shoemaker’s Holiday,” “The Honest
Whore,” and “Old Fortunatus” are his best plays. In the third lecture of
the “Age of Elizabeth” Hazlitt thus compares Webster and Dekker: “Webster
would, I think, be a greater dramatic genius than Deckar, if he had the
same originality; and perhaps is so, even without it. His White Devil and
Duchess of Malfy, upon the whole perhaps, come the nearest to Shakspeare
of anything we have upon record; the only drawback to them, the only shade
of imputation that can be thrown upon them, ‘by which they lose some
colour,’ is, that they are too like Shakspeare, and often direct
imitations of him, both in general conception and individual
expression.... Deckar has, I think, more truth of character, more
instinctive depth of sentiment, more of the unconscious simplicity of
nature; but he does not, out of his own stores, clothe his subject with
the same richness of imagination, or the same glowing colours of language.
Deckar excels in giving expression to certain habitual, deeply-rooted
feelings, which remain pretty much the same in all circumstances, the
simple uncompounded elements of nature and passion:—Webster gives more
scope to their various combinations and changeable aspects, brings them
into dramatic play by contrast and comparison, flings them into a state of
fusion by a kindled fancy, makes them describe a wider arc of oscillation
from the impulse of unbridled passion, and carries both terror and pity to
a more painful and sometimes unwarrantable excess. Deckar is content with
the historic picture of suffering; Webster goes on to suggest horrible[Pg 422]
imaginings. The pathos of the one tells home and for itself; the other
adorns his sentiments with some image of tender or awful beauty. In a
word, Deckar is more like Chaucer or Boccaccio; as Webster’s mind appears
to have been cast more in the mould of Shakespeare’s, as well naturally as from studious emulation.”
Heywood, Thomas (d. c. 1650), a prolific dramatist who excelled in the
homely vein. His best-known play is “The Woman Killed with Kindness.”
Beaumont, Francis (1584-1616), and Fletcher, John (1579-1625),
composed their dramas in collaboration. In the “Age of Elizabeth” Hazlitt
calls them lyric and descriptive poets of the first order, but as regards
drama “the first writers who in some measure departed from the genuine
tragic style of the age of Shakspeare. They thought less of their subject,
and more of themselves, than some others. They had a great and
unquestioned command over the stores both of fancy and passion; but they
availed themselves too often of commonplace extravagances and theatrical
trick.... The example of preceding or contemporary writers had given them
facility; the frequency of dramatic exhibition had advanced the popular
taste; and this facility of production, and the necessity for appealing to
popular applause, tended to vitiate their own taste, and to make them
willing to pamper that of the public for novelty and extraordinary effect.
There wants something of the sincerity and modesty of the older writers.
They do not wait nature’s time, or work out her materials patiently and
faithfully, but try to anticipate her, and so far defeat themselves. They
would have a catastrophe in every scene; so that you have none at last:
they would raise admiration to its height in every line; so that the
impression of the whole is comparatively loose and desultory. They pitch
the characters at first in too high a key, and exhaust themselves by the
eagerness and impatience of their efforts. We find all the prodigality of
youth, the confidence inspired by success, an enthusiasm bordering on
extravagance, richness running riot, beauty dissolving in its own
sweetness. They are like heirs just come to their estates, like lovers in
the honeymoon. In the economy of nature’s gifts, they ‘misuse the
bounteous Pan, and thank the Gods amiss.’ Their productions shoot up in
haste, but bear the marks of precocity and premature decay. Or they are
two goodly trees, the stateliest of the forest, crowned with blossoms, and
with the verdure springing at their feet; but they do not strike[Pg 423] their
roots far enough into the ground, and the fruit can hardly ripen for the flowers!”
Jonson, Ben (1573-1637), was the originator of the “comedy of humors.”
Hazlitt, in discussing him at length in the second lecture on the “Comic
Writers,” confesses a disrelish for his style. “He was a great man in
himself, but one cannot readily sympathise with him. His works, as the
characteristic productions of an individual mind, or as records of the
manners of a particular age, cannot be valued too highly; but they have
little charm for the mere general reader. Schlegel observes, that whereas
Shakspeare gives the springs of human nature, which are always the same,
or sufficiently so to be interesting and intelligible; Jonson chiefly
gives the humours of men, as connected with certain arbitrary and
conventional modes of dress, action, and expression, which are
intelligible only while they last, and not very interesting at any time.
Shakspeare’s characters are men; Ben Jonson’s are more like machines,
governed by mere routine, or by the convenience of the poet, whose
property they are.... His portraits are caricatures by dint of their very
likeness, being extravagant tautologies of themselves; as his plots are
improbable by an excess of consistency; for he goes thoroughstitch with
whatever he takes in hand, makes one contrivance answer all purposes, and
every obstacle give way to a predetermined theory.... Old Ben was of a
scholastic turn and had dealt a little in the occult sciences and
controversial divinity. He was a man of strong crabbed sense, retentive
memory, acute observation, great fidelity of description and keeping in
character, a power of working out an idea so as to make it painfully true
and oppressive, and with great honesty and manliness of feeling, as well
as directness of understanding: but with all this, he wanted, to my
thinking, that genial spirit of enjoyment and finer fancy, which
constitute the essence of poetry and wit.... There was nothing
spontaneous, no impulse or ease about his genius: it was all forced,
up-hill work, making a toil of pleasure. And hence his overweening
admiration of his own works, from the effort they had cost him, and the
apprehension that they were not proportionably admired by others, who knew
nothing of the pangs and throes of his Muse in child-bearing.” Works,
VIII, 39-41. Of Ben Jonson’s tragedies Hazlitt held a higher opinion than
of his comedies. “The richer the soil in which he labours, the less dross
and rubbish we have.... His tenaciousness of what is grand and lofty, is
more praiseworthy than his delight in what is low and[Pg 424] disagreeable. His
pedantry accords better with didactic pomp than with illiterate and vulgar
gabble; his learning engrafted on romantic tradition or classical history,
looks like genius.... His tragedy of the Fall of Sejanus, in particular,
is an admirable piece of ancient mosaic.... The depth of knowledge and
gravity of expression sustain one another throughout: the poet has worked
out the historian’s outline, so that the vices and passions, the ambition
and servility of public men, in the heated and poisonous atmosphere of a
luxurious and despotic court, were never described in fuller or more
glowing colours.” Works, V, 262-3.

credit by his account of their conversation,” says Hazlitt in the
“Lectures on the Age of Elizabeth.” Works, V, 299.
Eugene Aram was hanged in 1759 for a murder he had committed several years earlier.
Admirable Crichton. James Crichton (1560?-1582), a Scotchman of noble
birth who, in a brief life, gained the reputation of universal genius and
concerning whose powers many legends arose.
P. 327. H——. Hunt, according to “Literary Remains.”
Hobbes, Thomas (1588-1679), the English philosopher. His chief work is
“Leviathan, or the Matter, Form, and Power of a Commonwealth,
Ecclesiastical and Civil” (1651). Hazlitt vindicated the superiority of
Hobbes as a thinker at a time when his fame was overshadowed by other
reputations. He calls him the founder of the modern material philosophy
and maintains that “the true reason of the fate which this author’s
writings met with was that his views of things were too original and
comprehensive to be immediately understood, without passing through the
hands of several successive generations of commentators and interpreters.
Ignorance of another’s meaning is a sufficient cause of fear, and fear
produces hatred.” Works, XI, 25-48.
Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758). In writing “On the Tendency of Sects” in
the “Round Table,” Hazlitt had alluded to Edwards as an Englishman and had
spoken of his work on the Will as “written with as much power of logic,
and more in the true spirit of philosophy, than any other metaphysical
work in the language.”
[Pg 425]P. 327, n. Lord Bacon, Francis (1561-1626), statesman, scientist, and
man of letters. His chief works are the “Essays” (1597), the “Advancement
of Learning” (1604), “Novum Organum” (1620), “History of Henry VII” (1622).
P. 328. Dugald Stewart (1753-1828), Scotch philosopher.
Duchess of Bolton. Lavinia Fenton (1708-1760), the original Polly in
Gay’s “Beggar’s Opera,” married the Duke of Bolton in 1751.
P. 329. Raphael, Sanzio (1483-1520), the greatest of all the Italian painters.
Lucretia Borgia with calm golden locks. This sounds like a striking
anticipation of Landor’s fine line, “Calm hair meandering in pellucid
gold” in his poem “On Lucretia Borgia’s Hair.” Or had Hazlitt seen the
poem before it was published?
Michael Angelo (1475-1564), poet, painter, architect, and sculptor, the most famous of the great Italian artists.
Correggio (1494-1534), Giorgione (1477-1510), Guido (1575-1642),
Cimabue (1240-1302), Vandyke (1599-1641). The other painters are mentioned elsewhere in this volume.
whose names on earth. In his review of Sismondi’s “Literature of the
South” (Works, X, 62) Hazlitt cites among the proofs of Dante’s poetic
power “his description of the poets and great men of antiquity, whom he
represents ‘serene and smiling,’ though in the shades of death, ‘because
on earth their names in fame’s eternal records shine for aye.’” As these
lines have not been located in Dante, they have been ascribed to the lying
memory of Lamb, from whose lips Hazlitt learned them.
P. 330. Mrs. Hutchinson, Lucy (b. 1620), whose life of her Puritan
husband, Colonel Hutchinson, had appeared in 1806, presumably shortly
before the conversation recorded in this essay.
one in the room. Mary Lamb, the sister of the essayist.
Ninon de Lenclos (1615-1705), for a long time the leader of fashion in Paris and the patroness of poets.
Voltaire (1694-1778), the sceptical philosopher of the Enlightenment;
Rabelais (1490-1553), the greatest French humorist, author of “Gargantua
and Pantagruel”; Molière (1622-1673), the master of French comedy;
Racine (1639-1699), the master of French classic tragedy; La Fontaine
(1621-1695), author of the “Fables”; La Rochefoucauld (1613-1680),
celebrated for his book of cynical “Maxims” which Hazlitt imitated in his
“Characteristics”; St. Evremont (1610-1703), a critic.

Oh, ever right. “Coriolanus,” ii, 1, 208.
H——. This speech is attributed to Lamb in “Literary Remains,” but
wrongly so according to Waller and Glover “because, in the first place,
the speech seems more characteristic of Hunt than of Lamb, and, secondly,
because the volume of the New Monthly in which the essay appeared contains
a list of errata in which two corrections (one of them relating to
initials) are made in the essay and yet this ‘H——’ is left uncorrected.”
 
This essay was first published in the London Magazine for February, 1821, and republished in the “Plain Speaker.”
P. 333. I hate to read new books. It would take too long to recall all
the passages in which Hazlitt voices his sentimental attachment to the
writers with whom he first became acquainted. “The greatest pleasure in
life,” he says in one essay, “is that of reading when we are young,” and
at the conclusion of his lectures on the “Age of Elizabeth” he remarks:
“Were I to live much longer than I have any chance of doing, the books
which I read when I was young, I can never forget.” Patmore’s statement
concerning Hazlitt’s later reading may be exaggerated, but it is
interesting in this connection: “I do not believe Hazlitt ever read the
half of any work that he reviewed—not even the Scotch novels, of which he
read more than of any other modern productions, and has written better
perhaps, than any other of their critics. I am certain that of many works
that he has reviewed, and of many writers whose general pretensions he has
estimated better than anybody else has done, he never read one tithe.” “My
Friends and Acquaintances,” III, 122.
Tales of my Landlord. Scott’s.
Lady Morgan (1783?-1859), a writer of Irish stories, of which the
best-known is “The Wild Irish Girl” (1806). She is also the author of
certain miscellaneous productions, among which is a “Life of Salvator
Rosa” reviewed by Hazlitt for the Edinburgh Review, July, 1824. Works, X, 276-310.

novels in which romance, sentiment, and terror are combined in cunning
proportions. Her chief novels are “The Romance of the Forest” (1791), “The
Mysteries of Udolpho” (1794) and “The Italian” (1797). Hazlitt writes of
her in the lecture “On the English Novelists.”

the great French sentimentalist, Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), who
was the most powerful personal force in the revolutionary movement of the
eighteenth century and whose writings have left a deep impression on the
political and educational systems of the nineteenth. His other important
works are “The Social Contract” and “Émile” (1762) and the “Confessions”
(1782). Hazlitt has a “Character of Rousseau” in the “Round Table” (see p. xliv, n.).

Published under the Name of Barry Cornwall.”
P. 341. Keats. Hazlitt shared the popular conception of Keats as an
effeminate poet. He concludes the essay “On Effeminacy of Character” in
“Table Talk” with a reference to Keats: “I cannot help thinking that the
fault of Mr. Keats’s poems was a deficiency in masculine energy of style.
He had beauty, tenderness, delicacy, in an uncommon degree, but there was
a want of strength and substance. His Endymion is a very delightful
description of the illusions of a youthful imagination, given up to airy
dreams—we have flowers, clouds, rainbows, moonlight, all sweet sounds and
smells, and Oreads and Dryads flitting by—but there is nothing tangible
in it, nothing marked or palpable—we have none of the hardy spirit or
rigid forms of antiquity. He painted his own thoughts and character; and
did not transport himself into the fabulous and heroic ages. There is a
want of action, of character, and so far, of imagination, but there is
exquisite fancy. All is soft and fleshy, without bone or muscle. We see in
him the youth, without the manhood of poetry. His genius breathed ‘vernal
delight and joy.’—‘Like Maia’s son he stood and shook his plumes,’ with
fragrance filled. His mind was redolent of spring. He had not the
fierceness of summer, nor the richness of autumn, and winter he seemed not
to have known, till he felt the icy hand of death!” Again in the
introduction to the “Select British Poets” (Works, V, 378), he says that
Keats “gave the greatest promise of genius of any poet of his day. He
displayed extreme[Pg 429] tenderness, beauty, originality, and delicacy of fancy;
all he wanted was manly strength and fortitude to reject the temptations
of singularity in sentiment and expression. Some of his shorter and later
pieces are, however, as free from faults as they are full of beauties.”

An Essay on Marriage. “No such essay by Wordsworth is at present known
to exist. It would seem either that ‘Marriage’ is a misprint for some
other word, or that Hazlitt was mistaken in the subject of the essay
referred to by Coleridge. Hazlitt is probably recalling a conversation
with Coleridge in Shropshire at the beginning of 1798 (cf. ‘My First
Acquaintance with Poets’), at which time A Letter to the Bishop of
Llandaff (1793) was the only notable prose work which Wordsworth had published.” Waller-Glover.

[Pg iii]
The present selection of Hazlitt’s critical essays has been planned to
serve two important purposes. In the first place it provides the materials
for an estimate of the character and scope of Hazlitt’s contributions to
criticism and so acquaints students with one of the greatest of English
critics. And in the second place, what is perhaps more important, such a
selection, embodying a series of appreciations of the great English
writers, should prove helpful in the college teaching of literature. There
is no great critic who by his readableness and comprehensiveness is as
well qualified as Hazlitt to aid in bringing home to students the power
and the beauty of the essential things in literature. There is, in him a
splendid stimulating energy which has not yet been sufficiently utilized.
The contents have been selected and arranged to present a chronological
and almost continuous account of English literature from its beginning in
the age of Elizabeth down to Hazlitt’s own day, the period of the romantic
revival. To the more strictly critical essays there have been added a few
which reveal Hazlitt’s intimate intercourse with books and also with their
writers, whether he knew them in the flesh or only through the printed
page. Such vivid revelations of personal contact contribute much to
further the chief aim of this volume, which is to introduce the reader to
a direct and spontaneous view of literature.
The editor’s introduction, in trying to fix formally Hazlitt’s position as
a critic, of necessity takes account of his personality, which cannot be
dissociated from his critical[Pg iv] practice. The notes, in addition to
identifying quotations and explaining allusions, indicate the nature of
Hazlitt’s obligations to earlier and contemporary critics. They contain a
body of detailed information, which may be used, if so desired, for
disciplinary purposes. The text here employed is that of the last form
published in Hazlitt’s own lifetime, namely, that of the second edition in
the case of the Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays, the lectures on the
poets and on the age of Elizabeth, and the Spirit of the Age, and the
first edition of the Comic Writers, the Plain Speaker, and the Political
Essays. A slight departure from this procedure in the case of the essay on
“Elia” is explained in the notes. “My First Acquaintance with Poets,” and
“Of Persons One Would Wish to Have Seen” are taken from the periodicals in
which they first appeared, as they were not republished in book-form till
after Hazlitt’s death. Hazlitt’s own spellings and punctuation are
retained.
To all who have contributed to the study and appreciation of Hazlitt, the
present editor desires to make general acknowledgement—to Alexander
Ireland, Mr. W. C. Hazlitt, Mr. Birrell, and Mr. Saintsbury. Mention
should also be made of Mr. Nichol Smith’s little volume of Hazlitt’s
Essays on Poetry (Blackwood’s), and of the excellent treatment of Hazlitt
in Professor Oliver Elton’s Survey of English Literature from 1780 to
1830, which came to hand after this edition had been completed. A debt of
special gratitude is owing to Mr. Glover and Mr. Waller for their splendid
edition of Hazlitt’s Collected Works (in twelve volumes with an index,
Dent 1902-1906). All of Hazlitt’s quotations have been identified with the
help of this edition. References to Hazlitt’s own writings, when cited by
volume and page, apply to the edition of Glover and Waller.
Finally I wish to express my sincere thanks to Professor G. P. Krapp for
his friendly cooperation in the planning[Pg v] and carrying out of this volume,
and to him and to my colleague, Professor S. P. Sherman, for helpful
criticism of the introduction.

Hazlitt characterized the age he lived in as “critical, didactic,
paradoxical, romantic.”[1] It was the age of the Edinburgh Review, of the
Utilitarians, of Godwin and Shelley, of Wordsworth and Byron—in a word of
the French Revolution and all that it brought in its train. Poetry in this
age was impregnated with politics; ideas for social reform sprang from the
ground of personal sentiment. Hazlitt was born early enough to partake of
the ardent hopes which the last decade of the eighteenth century held out,
but his spirit came to ripeness in years of reaction in which the battle
for reform seemed a lost hope. While the changing events were bringing
about corresponding changes in the ideals of such early votaries to
liberty as Coleridge and Wordsworth, Hazlitt continued to cling to his
enthusiastic faith, but at the same time the spectacle of a world which
turned away from its brightest dreams made of him a sharp critic of human
nature, and his sense of personal disappointment turned into a bitterness
hardly to be distinguished from cynicism. In a passionate longing for a
better order of things, in the merciless denunciation of the cant and
bigotry which was enlisted in the cause of the existing order, he
resembled Byron. The rare union in his nature of the analytic and the
emotional[Pg xii] gave to his writings the very qualities which he enumerated as
characteristic of the age, and his consistent sincerity made his voice
distinct above many others of his generation.
Hazlitt’s earlier years reveal a restless conflict of the sensitive and
the intellectual. His father, a friend of Priestley’s, was a Unitarian
preacher, who, in his vain search for liberty of conscience, had spent
three years in America with his family. Under him the boy was accustomed
to the reading of sermons and political tracts, and on this dry
nourishment he seemed to thrive till he was sent to the Hackney
Theological College to begin his preparation for the ministry. His
dissatisfaction there was not such as could be put into words—perhaps a
hunger for keener sensations and an appetite for freer inquiry than was
open to a theological student even of a dissenting church. After a year at
Hackney he withdrew to his father’s home, where he found nothing more
definite to do than to “solve some knotty point, or dip in some abstruse
author, or look at the sky, or wander by the pebbled sea-side.”[2] This
was probably the period of his most extensive reading. He absorbed the
English novelists and essayists; he saturated himself with the sentiment
of Rousseau; he studied Bacon and Hobbes and Berkeley and Hume; he became
fascinated, in Burke, by the union of a wide intellect with a brilliant
fancy and consummate rhetorical skill.[3] Though he called himself at this
time dumb and inarticulate, and the idea of ever making literature his
profession had not suggested itself to him, he was eager to talk about the
things he read, and in Joseph Fawcett, a retired minister, he found an
agreeable companion. “A heartier friend or honester critic I never coped[Pg xiii]
withal.”[4] “The writings of Sterne, Fielding, Cervantes, Richardson,
Rousseau, Godwin, Goethe, etc. were the usual subjects of our discourse,
and the pleasure I had had, in reading these authors, was more than
doubled.”[5] How acutely sensitive he was to all impressions at this time
is indicated by the effect upon him of the meeting with Coleridge and
Wordsworth of which he has left a record in one of his most eloquent
essays, “My First Acquaintance with Poets.” But his active energies were
concentrated on the solution of a metaphysical problem which was destined
to possess his brain for many years: in his youthful enthusiasm he was
grappling with a theory concerning the natural disinterestedness of the
human mind, apparently adhering to the bias which he had received from his
early training.
But being come of age and finding it necessary to turn his mind to
something more marketable than abstract speculation, he determined, though
apparently without any natural inclination toward the art, to become a
painter. He apprenticed himself to his brother John Hazlitt, who had
gained some reputation in London for his miniatures. During the peace of
Amiens in 1802, he travelled to the Louvre to study and copy the
masterpieces which Napoleon had brought over from Italy as trophies of
war. Here, as he “marched delighted through a quarter of a mile of the
proudest efforts of the mind of man, a whole creation of genius, a
universe of art,”[6] he imbibed a love of perfection which may have been
fatal to his hopes of a career. At any rate it was soon after, while he
was following the profession of itinerant painter through England, that he
wrote to his father of “much dissatisfaction and much sorrow,” [Pg xiv]of “that
repeated disappointment and that long dejection which have served to
overcast and to throw into deep obscurity some of the best years of my
life.”[7]
When Hazlitt abandoned painting, he fell back upon his analytic gift as a
means of earning a living. Not counting his first published work, the
Essay on the Principles of Human Action, which was purely a labor of love
and fell still-born from the press, the tasks to which he now devoted his
time were chiefly of the kind ordinarily rated as job work. He prepared an
abridgement of Abraham Tucker’s Light of Nature, compiled the Eloquence of
the British Senate, wrote a reply to Malthus’s Essay on Population, and
even composed an elementary English Grammar. It would be a mistake to
suppose that these labors were performed according to a system of
mechanical routine. Hazlitt impressed something of his personality on
whatever he touched. His violent attack on the inhuman tendencies of
Malthus’s doctrines is pervaded by a glow of humanitarian indignation. For
the Eloquence of the British Senate he wrote a sketch of Burke, which for
fervor of appreciation and judicious analysis ranks with his best things
of this class. Even the Grammar bears evidence of his enthusiasm for an
idea. Whenever he has occasion to express his feelings on a subject of
popular interest, his manner begins to grow animated and his language to
gain in force and suppleness.
But Hazlitt continued firmly in the faith that it was his destiny to be a
metaphysician. In 1812 he undertook to deliver a course of lectures on
philosophy at the Russell Institution with the ambitious purpose of
founding a system [Pg xv]of philosophy “more conformable to reason and
experience” than that of the modern material school which resolved “all
thought into sensation, all morality into the love of pleasure, and all
action into mechanical impulse.”[8] Though he did not succeed in founding
a system, he probably interested his audience by a stimulating review of
the main tendencies of English thought from Bacon and Hobbes to Priestley
and Godwin.
At the conclusion of his last lecture, Hazlitt told the story of a Brahmin
who, on being transformed into a monkey, “had no other delight than that
of eating cocoanuts and studying metaphysics.” “I too,” he added, “should
be very well contented to pass my life like this monkey, did I but know
how to provide myself with a substitute for cocoanuts.” But it must have
become apparent to Hazlitt and his friends that he possessed a talent more
profitable than that of abstract speculation. The vigor and vitality of
the prose in these lectures, compared with the heavy, inert style of his
first metaphysical writing, the freedom of illustration and poetic
allusion, suggested the possibility of success in more popular forms of
literature. He tried to work for the newspapers as theatrical and
parliamentary reporter, but his temper and his habits were not adaptable
to the requirements of daily journalism, and editors did not long remain
complacent toward him. He did however, in the course of a few years,
succeed in gaining admission to the pages of the Edinburgh Review and in
establishing an enviable reputation as a writer, of critical and
miscellaneous essays. Even in that anonymous generation he could not long
contribute to any periodical without attracting attention. Readers were
aroused by his bold paradox and by the tonic quality of his style. Editors
appealed to him for “dashing articles,” for something [Pg xvi]“brilliant or
striking” on any subject. Authors looked forward to a favorable notice
from Hazlitt, and Keats even declared that it would be a compensation for
being damned if Hazlitt were to do the damning.
In his essays the features of Hazlitt’s personality may be plainly
recognized, and these reveal a triple ancestry. He claims descent from
Montaigne by virtue of his original observation of humanity with its
entire accumulation of custom and prejudice; he is akin to Rousseau in a
high-strung susceptibility to emotions, sentiments, and ideas; and he is
tinged with a cynicism to which there is no closer parallel than in the
maxims of La Rochefoucauld. The union of the philosopher, the enthusiast,
and the man of the world is fairly unusual in literature, but in Hazlitt’s
case the union was not productive of any sharp contradictions. His common
sense served as a ballast to his buoyant emotions; the natural strength of
his feelings loosened the bonds which attached him to his favorite
theories; his cynicism, by sharpening his perception of the frailty of
human nature, prevented his philanthropic dreams from imposing themselves
on him for reality.
The analytical gift manifested itself in Hazlitt precociously in the study
of human nature. He characterized some of his schoolmates disdainfully as
“fit only for fighting like stupid dogs and cats,” and at the age of
twelve, while on a visit, he communicated to his father a caustic sketch
of some English ladies who “require an Horace or a Shakespeare to describe
them,” and whose “ceremonial unsociality” made him wish he were back in
America. His metaphysical studies determined the direction which his
observation of life should take. He became a remarkable anatomist of the
constitution of human nature in the abstract, viewing the motives of men’s
actions from a speculative plane. He excels in sharp etchings which bring
the[Pg xvii] outline of a character into bold prominence. He is happy in defining
isolated traits and in throwing a new light on much used words.
“Cleverness,” he writes, “is a certain knack or aptitude at doing
certain things, which depend more on a particular adroitness and off-hand
readiness than on force or perseverance, such as making puns, making
epigrams, making extempore verses, mimicking the company, mimicking a
style, etc.... Accomplishments are certain external graces, which are to
be learnt from others, and which are easily displayed to the admiration of
the beholder, viz. dancing, riding, fencing, music, and so on.... Talent
is the capacity of doing anything that depends on application and
industry, such as writing a criticism, making a speech, studying the
law.”[9] These innocent looking definitions are probably not without an
ironic sting. It requires no great stretch of the imagination, for
example, to catch in Hazlitt’s eye a sly wink at Lamb or a disdainful
glance toward Leigh Hunt as he gives the reader his idea of cleverness or
accomplishment.
Hazlitt’s definitions often startle and give a vigorous buffet to our
preconceptions. He is likely to open an essay on “Good-Nature” by
declaring that a good-natured man is “one who does not like to be put out
of his way.... Good-nature is humanity that costs nothing;”[10] and he may
describe a respectable man as “a person whom there is no reason for
respecting, or none that we choose to name.”[11] Against the imputation of
paradox, which such expressions expose him to, he has written his own
defence, applying his usual analytical acuteness to distinguish between
originality and singularity.[12] The
contradiction of [Pg xviii]a common prejudice,
which always passes for paradox, is often such only in appearance. It is
true that an ingenious person may take advantage of the elusive nature of
language to play tricks with the ordinary understanding, but it is equally
true that words of themselves have a way of imposing on the uninquiring
mind and passing themselves off at an inflated value. No process is more
familiar than that by which words in the course of a long life lose all
their original power, and yet they will sometimes continue to exercise a
disproportionate authority. Then comes the original mind, which, looking
straight at the thing instead of accepting the specious title, discovers
the incongruity between the pretence and the reality, and in the first
shock of the disclosure annoyingly overturns our settled ideas. This is
the spirit in which Carlyle seeks to strip off the clothes in which
humanity has irrecognizably disguised itself, and it is the spirit in
which Robert Louis Stevenson tries to free his old-world conscience from
the old-world forms. To take a more recent parallel, it is the manner,
somewhat exaggerated, in which Mr. G. K. Chesterton examines the upstart
heresies of our own agitated day. There would be nothing fanciful in
suggesting that all these men owed a direct debt to Hazlitt—Stevenson on
many occasions acknowledged it.[13] Hazlitt
was as honest and [Pg xix]sincere as
any of them. Though the opening of an essay may appear perverse, he is
sure to enforce his point before proceeding very far. He accumulates
familiar instances in such abundance as to render obvious what at first
seemed paradoxical. He writes “On the Ignorance of the Learned” and makes
it perfectly clear that no person knows less of the actual life of the
world than he whose experience is confined to books. On the other hand he
has a whole-hearted appreciation of pedantry: “The power of attaching an
interest to the most trifling or painful pursuits, in which our whole
attention and faculties are engaged, is one of the greatest happinesses of
our nature.... He who is not in some measure a pedant, though he may be a
wise, cannot be a very happy man.”[14] These two examples illustrate
Hazlitt’s manner of presenting both views of a subject by concentrating
his attention on each separately and examining it without regard to the
other. On one occasion he anatomizes the faults of the dissenters, and on
another he extols their virtues, “I have inveighed all my [Pg xx]life against
the insolence of the Tories, and for this I have the authority both of
Whigs and Reformers; but then I have occasionally spoken against the
imbecility of the Whigs, and the extravagance of the Reformers, and thus
have brought all three on my back, though two out of the three regularly
agree with all I say of the third party.”[15] The strange thing is not
that he should have incurred the wrath of all parties, but that he should
show surprise at the result.
Very often Hazlitt’s reflections are the generalization of his personal
experience. The essay “On the Disadvantages of Intellectual Superiority”
is but a record of the trials to which he was exposed by his morbid
sensitiveness and want of social tact, and amid much excellent advice “On
the Conduct of Life,” there are passages which merely reflect his own
marital misfortunes. It is not so much that he is a dupe of his emotions,
but in his view of life he attaches a higher importance to feeling than to
reason, and so provides a philosophic basis for his strongest prejudices.
“Custom, passion, imagination,” he declares, “insinuate themselves into
and influence almost every judgment we pass or sentiment we indulge, and
are a necessary help (as well as hindrance) to the human understanding; to
attempt to refer every question to abstract truth and precise definition,
without allowing for the frailty of prejudice, which is the unavoidable
consequence of the frailty and imperfection of reason, would be to unravel
the whole web and texture of human understanding and society.”[16]
It is this infusion of passion and sentiment, the addition of the warm
breath of his personal experience, that gives the motion of life to his
analytic essays, and a deep and solemn humanity to his abstract
speculations. Hazlitt felt [Pg xxi]life with an intensity which reminds us of a
more spacious age. “What a huge heap, a ‘huge, dumb heap,’ of wishes,
thoughts, feelings, anxious cares, soothing hopes, loves, joys,
friendships, it is composed of! How many ideas and trains of sentiment,
long and deep and intense, often pass through the mind in only one day’s
thinking or reading, for instance! How many such days are there in a year,
how many years in a long life, still occupied with something interesting,
still recalling some old impression, still recurring to some difficult
question and making progress in it, every step accompanied with a sense of
power, and every moment conscious of the ‘high endeavour and the glad
success!’”[17] What an exultant sense of power over the resources of life!
What an earnest delight in the tasting of every pleasure which the senses
and the intelligence afford! His enjoyments comprehended the widest range
of sensations and activities. He loved nature, he loved books, he loved
pictures, he loved the theatre, he loved music and dancing. He loved good
talk and good fellowship; he loved an idea and anyone who was susceptible
to an idea. He also loved a spirited game of rackets, and though he hated
brutality, he has left us a very vivid and sympathetic account of a
prize-fight. Above all he loved the words truth and justice and humanity.
With such sensibilities, it is no wonder that his last words should have
been “I have had a happy life.”
As the phrase is ordinarily understood, Hazlitt’s dying expression might
seem unaccountable. Outwardly few authors have been more miserable. Like
the great French sentimentalist with whom we have compared him, a
suspicious distrust of all who came near him converted his social
existence into a restless fever. He had the gift of interpreting every
contradiction to one of his favorite[Pg xxii] principles as a personal injury to
himself, and in the tense state of party feeling then prevailing, the
opportunities for taking offence were not limited. Hazlitt was one of the
chief marks singled out for abuse by the critics of Government. To
constant self-tormentings from within and persecution from without, there
was added the misfortune of an unhappy marriage and of a still more
unhappy love affair which lowered him in his own eyes as well as in the
eyes of the world. From the point of view of the practical man, Hazlitt’s
life would be declared a failure.
The result of Hazlitt’s hard experiences with the realities of life was to
confirm him in a devoted attachment to the past. All his high enthusiasms,
his sanguine dreams, his purest feelings continued to live for him in the
past, and it was only by recurring to their memory in the dim distance
that he could find assurance to sustain his faith. In the past all his
experiences were refined, subtilized, transfigured. A sunny afternoon on
Salisbury Plain, a walk with Charles and Mary Lamb under a Claude Lorraine
sky, a visit to the Montpelier Gardens where in his childhood he drank tea
with his father—occurrences as common as these were enveloped in a haze
of glory. And rarer events, such as a visit to the pictures at Burleigh
House, or to the galleries in the Louvre, tender visions of feminine grace
and sweetness, were touched in the recollection with a depth and pathos
which subdued even the most joyous impressions to a refined melancholy. In
no other English writer is this rich sentiment of the past so eloquent,
and no one was better qualified to describe its sources. “Time takes out
the sting of pain; our sorrows after a certain period have been so often
steeped in a medium of thought and passion, that they ‘unmould their
essence’; and all that remains of our original impressions is what we
would wish them to have been.... Seen in the distance, in the long[Pg xxiii]
perspective of waning years, the meanest incidents, enlarged and enriched
by countless recollections, become interesting; the most painful, broken
and softened by time, soothe.”[18] The “Farewell to Essay Writing” is
perfumed with the odor of grateful memories from which the writer draws
his “best consolation for the future.” He almost erects his feeling for
the past into a religion. “Happy are they,” he exclaims, “who live in the
dream of their own existence, and see all things in the light of their own
minds; who walk by faith and hope; to whom the guiding star of their youth
still shines from afar, and into whom the spirit of the world has not
entered!... The world has no hold on them. They are in it, not of it; and
a dream and a glory is ever around them!”[19]
But this impassioned sentiment for the past was only a refuge such as
Byron might seek among the glories of by-gone ages or amid the solitary
Alpine peaks, where it was possible to regain the strength spent in
grappling with the forces of the actual world and return newly nerved to
the battle. For fighting was Hazlitt’s more proper element. He could hate
with the same intensity that he loved, and his hatred was aroused most by
those whom he regarded as responsible for the overturning of his political
hopes. Politics had played the most important part in his early education.
In his father’s house he had absorbed the spirit of protest, accustomed
himself to arguing for the repeal of the Test Act, and to declaiming
against religious and political persecution. At the age of twelve he had
written an indignant letter to the Shrewsbury Chronicle against the mob of
incendiaries which had destroyed the house of Priestley, and as a student
at Hackney he showed sufficient self-reliance to develop an original
“Essay on Laws.” The [Pg xxiv]defence of the popular cause was with him not an
academic exercise, but a religious principle. “Since a little child, I
knelt and lifted up my hands in prayer for it.”[20] The emotional warmth
of his creed was heightened by the reading of Rousseau, and in Napoleon it
found a living hero on whom it could expend itself.
An uncompromising attachment to certain fundamental principles of
democracy and an unceasing devotion to Napoleon constitute the chief
elements of Hazlitt’s political character. He sets forth his idea of
representative government exactly in the manner of Rousseau when he
proclaims that “in matters of feeling and common sense, of which each
individual is the best judge, the majority are in the right.... It is an
absurdity to suppose that there can be any better criterion of national
grievances, or the proper remedies for them, than the aggregate amount of
the actual, dear-bought experience, the honest feelings, and heart-felt
wishes of a whole people, informed and directed by the greatest power of
understanding in the community, unbiassed by any sinister motive.”[21]
Hazlitt was not a republican, and he disapproved of the Utopian rhapsodies
of Shelley, woven as they seemed of mere moonshine, without applicability
to the evils that demanded immediate reform. But he did insist that there
was a power in the people to change its government and its governors, and
hence grew his idolatry of Napoleon, who, through all vicissitudes,
remained the “Child and Champion of the Revolution,” the hero who had
shown Europe how its established despots could be overthrown.
The news of Waterloo plunged Hazlitt into deep distress, as if it had been
the shock of a personal calamity. According to Haydon, “he walked about
unwashed, unshaven, [Pg xxv]hardly sober by day, always intoxicated by night,
literally for weeks.” But his disappointment only strengthened his
attachment to his principles. These remained enshrined with the brightest
dreams of his youth, and in proportion as the vision faded and men were
beginning to scoff at it as a shadow, Hazlitt bent his energies to fix its
outline and prove its reality. “I am attached to my conclusions,” he says,
“in consequence of the pain, the anxiety, and the waste of time they have
cost me.”[22] His doctrines contained nothing that was subversive of
social order, and their ultimate triumph lends the color of heroism to a
consistency which people have often interpreted as proof of a limited
horizon. It is at least certain that he did not put his conscience out to
market, and that his reward came in the form of the vilest calumny ever
visited upon a man of letters.
These were the most infamous years of the Quarterly Review and Blackwood’s
Magazine, both of which had been founded as avowed champions of reaction.
Their purpose was to discredit all writers whose politics or the politics
of whose friends differed from the Government. Everybody knows of the fate
which Keats and Shelley[Pg xxvi] suffered at their hands, chiefly because they
were friends of Leigh Hunt, who was the editor of a Liberal newspaper
which had displeased George IV. Even the unoffending Lamb did not escape
their brutality, perhaps because he was guilty of admitting Hazlitt to his
house. The weapons were misrepresentation and unconfined abuse, wielded
with an utter disregard of where the blows might fall, in the spirit of a
gang of young ruffians who knew that they were protected in their
wantonness by a higher authority. In the chastened sadness of his later
years Lockhart, who was one of the offenders, confessed that he had no
personal grudge against any of Blackwood’s victims, in fact that he knew
nothing about any of them, but that at the request of John Wilson, his
fellow-editor, he had composed “some squibberies ... with as little malice
as if the assigned subject had been the court of Pekin.” The sincere
regret he expressed for the pain which his “jokes” had inflicted ought
perhaps to be counted in extenuation of his errors. It may be true, as his
generous biographer suggests, that “his politics and his feud with many of
these men was an affair of ignorance and accidental associations in
Edinburgh,” that under different circumstances “he might have been found
inditing sonnets to Leigh Hunt, and supping with Lamb, Haydon, and
Hazlitt.”[23] But meanwhile irreparable mischief had been done to many
reputations, and the life of one man had been sacrificed to his
sportiveness.[24]
The signal for the attack on Hazlitt was given by the Quarterly in
connection with a review of The Round Table, Hazlitt’s first book. The
contents of this volume were [Pg xxvii]characterized as “vulgar descriptions, silly
paradox, flat truisms, misty sophistry, broken English, ill humour and
rancorous abuse.”[25] A little later, when the Characters of Shakespeare’s
Plays seemed to be finding such favor with the public that one edition was
quickly exhausted, the Quarterly extinguished its sale by “proving that
Mr. Hazlitt’s knowledge of Shakespeare and the English language is on a
par with the purity of his morals and the depth of his understanding.”[26]
The cry was soon taken up by the Blackwood’s people in a series on the
Cockney School of Prose. Lockhart invented the expression “pimpled
Hazlitt.” It so happened that Hazlitt’s complexion was unusually clear,
but the epithet clung to him with a cruel tenacity. When an ill-natured
reviewer could find nothing else to say, he had recourse to “pimpled
essays” or “pimpled criticism.”[27] The climax of abuse was reached in an
article entitled “Hazlitt Cross-Questioned,” which a sense of decency
makes it impossible to reproduce, and which resulted in the payment of
damages to the victim. Even the publisher Blackwood speaks of it, with
what sincerity it is not safe to say, as disgusting in tone, and Murray,
who was the London agent for the Magazine, refused to have any further
dealings with it. But the harm was done. Hazlitt could not walk out
without feeling that every passer-by had read the atrocious article and
saw the brand of the social outcast on his features.
In an atmosphere like this, it is scarcely to be wondered at if Hazlitt’s
temper, never of the amiable sort, should [Pg xxviii]have become embittered, nor is
it strange that he should sometimes, through ignorance, have committed the
fault of which his enemies had been guilty in wantonness. Not content with
retaliating the full measure of malice upon the heads of his immediate
assailants, he turned the stream of his abuse upon Sir Walter Scott, whom
he singled out deliberately as the towering head of a supposed literary
conspiracy. He is credited with remarking; “To pay these fellows in their
own coin, the way would be to begin with Walter Scott, and have at his
clump foot.”[28] Very mean-spirited this sounds to us, who are acquainted
with the nobility of Scott’s character and who know with what magnanimous
wisdom he kept himself above the petty altercations of the day. But for
Hazlitt, Sir Walter was the father-in-law and friendly patron of John
Lockhart, he was the person who had thrown the weight of his powerful
influence to make John Wilson Professor of Moral Philosophy at the
University of Edinburgh! He did not carry his prejudice against the Author of Waverley.
In some instances Hazlitt was consciously the aggressor, but his attacks
were never wanton. He denounced Wordsworth and Coleridge and Southey
because they were renegades from the cause which lay nearest to his heart.
Their apostasy was an unforgivable offence in his eyes, and his wrath was
proportioned to the admiration which he otherwise entertained for them. It
is true that he treated their motives hastily and unjustly, but none of
his opponents set him the example of charity. In the earlier years of
their acquaintance Coleridge had spoken of Hazlitt as a “thinking,
observant, original man.” one who “says things that are his own in a way
of his own,”[29] whereas
after their [Pg xxix]estrangement he discovered that
Hazlitt was completely lacking in originality. Wordsworth, being offended
at Hazlitt’s review of the “Excursion,” peevishly raked up an old scandal
and wrote to Haydon that he was “not a proper person to be admitted into
respectable society.”[30] Perhaps Hazlitt was not as “respectable” as his
poet-friends, but he had a better sense of fair play. At any rate, in a
complete balancing of the accounts, Hazlitt’s frequent displays of
ill-temper are offset by the insidious, often unscrupulous baitings which
he suffered from his opponents.
Naturally his bitterness was extended to his reflections on mankind in
general. He felt as if the human race had wilfully deceived his sanguine
expectations, and he poured out his grievances against its refractoriness,
taking revenge for his public and his private wrongs, in a passage in
which high idealism is joined with personal spite, in which he has
revealed himself in all his strength and weakness, and involved his
enemies in a common ruin with himself. It concludes the essay “On the
Pleasure of Hating”:
“Instead of patriots and friends of freedom, I see nothing but the tyrant
and the slave, the people linked with kings to rivet on the chains of
despotism and superstition. I see folly join with knavery, and together
make up public spirit and public opinions. I see the insolent Tory, the
blind Reformer, the coward Whig! If mankind had wished for what is right,
they might have had it long ago. The theory is plain enough; but they are
prone to mischief, ‘to every good work reprobate.’ I have seen all that
had been done by the mighty yearnings of the spirit and intellect of men,
‘of whom the world was not worthy,’ and that promised a proud opening to
truth and good through the vista of future years, undone by one man, with
just glimmering of [Pg xxx]understanding enough to feel that he was a king, but
not to comprehend how he could be king of a free people! I have seen this
triumph celebrated by poets, the friends of my youth and the friends of
man, but who were carried away by the infuriate tide that, setting in from
a throne, bore down every distinction of right reason before it; and I
have seen all those who did not join in applauding this insult and outrage
on humanity proscribed, hunted down (they and their friends made a
bye-word of), so that it has become an understood thing that no one can
live by his talents or knowledge who is not ready to prostitute those
talents and that knowledge to betray his species, and prey upon his
fellow-man.... In private life do we not see hypocrisy, servility,
selfishness, folly, and impudence succeed, while modesty shrinks from the
encounter, and merit is trodden under foot? How often is ‘the rose plucked
from the forehead of a virtuous love to plant a blister there!’ What
chance is there of the success of real passion? What certainty of its
continuance? Seeing all this as I do, and unravelling the web of human
life into its various threads of meanness, spite, cowardice, want of
feeling, and want of understanding, of indifference towards others and
ignorance of ourselves—seeing custom prevail over all excellence, itself
giving way to infamy—mistaken as I have been in my public and private
hopes, calculating others from myself, and calculating wrong; always
disappointed where I placed most reliance; the dupe of friendship, and the
fool of love; have I not reason to hate and to despise myself? Indeed I
do; and chiefly for not having hated and despised the world
enough.”[31]—This is not exactly downright cynicism; it is more like
disappointment, beating its head frantically against the wall of
circumstance. Yet through his bitterest utterances there is felt the warm
sentiment[Pg xxxi] that, “let people rail at virtue, at genius and friendship as
long as they will—the very names of these disputed qualities are better
than anything else that could be substituted for them, and embalm even the
most angry abuse of them.”[32]
It is no wonder that Hazlitt has never been a popular favorite. With a
stronger attachment to principles than to persons, lavishing upon ideas or
the fanciful creations of art a passionate affection which he grudgingly
withheld from human beings, stubbornly tenacious of a set of political
dogmas to which he was ready to sacrifice his dearest friends, morbidly
sensitive to the faintest suggestion of a personal slight, and prompter
than the serpent to vent against the aggressor the bitterness of his
poison, he plays the role of Ishmael among the men of letters in his day.
The violence of his retorts when he felt himself injured and his capacity
for giving offence even when he was not directly provoked, begot a
resentment in his adversaries which blinded them to an appreciation of his
genuine worth. At best they might have assented, after his death, to the
sublime pity with which Carlyle, from his spiritual altitudes, moralized
upon his struggles. “How many a poor Hazlitt must wander on God’s verdant
earth, like the Unblest on burning deserts; passionately dig wells, and
draw up only the dry quicksand; believe that he is seeking Truth, yet only
wrestle among endless Sophisms, doing desperate battle as with
spectre-hosts; and die and make no sign!”[33] We must appeal to the issue
to determine whether Hazlitt’s battle was altogether against
spectre-hosts, and whether in his quest for truth and beauty he has drawn
up nothing but quicksand. But at least Carlyle’s expression recognizes
[Pg xxxii]the earnestness of his purpose and the bravery with which he maintained
the conflict.
Hazlitt gave himself freely and without reserve to his reader. By his side
Leigh Hunt appears affected, De Quincey theatrical, Lamb—let us say
discreet. Affectation and discretion were equally alien to Hazlitt’s
nature, as they concerned either his personal conduct or his literary
exercises. In regard to every impression, every prejudice, every stray
thought that struggled into consciousness, his practice was, to use his
own favorite quotation,
“To pour out all as plain
As downright Shippen or as old Montaigne.”
He has drifted far from the tradition of Addison and Steele with which his
contemporaries sought to associate him. There was nothing in him of the
courtier-like grace employed in the good-humored reproof of unimportant
vices, of the indulgent, condescending admonition to the “gentle reader,”
particularly of the fair sex. In Hazlitt’s hands the essay was an
instrument for the expression of serious thought and virile passion. He
lacked indeed the temperamental balance of Lamb. His insight into human
nature was intellectual rather than sympathetic. Though as a philosopher
he understood that the web of life is of a mingled yarn, he has given us
none of those rare glimpses of laughter ending in tears or of tears
subsiding in a tender smile which are the sources of Lamb’s depth and his
charm. The same thing is true of his humor. He relished heartily its
appearance in others and had a most wholesome laugh; but in himself there
is no real merriment, only an ironic realization of the contrasts of life.
When he writes, the smile which sometimes seeks to overpower the grim
fixity of his features, is frozen before it can emerge to the surface. He
lacks all the ingratiating arts which make a[Pg xxxiii] writer beloved. But if one
enjoys a keen student of the intricacies of character, a bold and candid
critic of human imperfections, a stimulating companion full of original
ideas and deep feelings, he will find in Hazlitt an inexhaustible source
of instruction and delight. Hazlitt has long appealed to men of vigorous
character and acute intellect, men like Landor, Froude, Walter Bagehot,
Robert Louis Stevenson, and Ernest Henley, who have either proclaimed his
praise or flattered him with imitation. By the friend who knew him longest
and was better qualified than any other to speak of him, he has been
pronounced as “in his natural and healthy state, one of the wisest and
finest spirits breathing.”[34]
The discovery in the seventeenth century of the Greek treatise “On the
Sublime,” attributed to Longinus, with its inspired appreciation of the
great passages in Greek literature so different from the analytic manner
of Aristotle, gave a decided impulse to English criticism. It was at the
same time that English prose, under the influence of French models, was
developing a more familiar tone than it had hitherto been acquainted with.
The union of the enthusiasm of Longinus with this moderated French prose
resulted in the graceful prefaces of Dryden, which remained unmatched for
more than a century. The Longinian fire, breathed upon too by the genius
of Shakespeare, preserved the eighteenth century from congealing into the
utter formalism of pseudo-Aristotelian authority. Though they did not
produce an even warmth over the whole surface, the flames are observed
darting through the crust even where the crust seems thickest. It is
significant that Dr. [Pg xxxiv]Johnson should exclaim with admiration at the
criticism of Dryden, not because Dryden judged according to rules but
because his was the criticism of a poet. And he singles out as the best
example of such criticism the well-known appreciation of Shakespeare, the
very passage which Hazlitt later quoted as “the best character of
Shakespeare that has ever been written.”[35] The high-priest of classicism
wavered frequently in his allegiance to some of the sacred fetishes of his
cult, and had enough grace, once at least, to speak with scorn of the
“cant of those who judged by principles rather than by perception.”[36]
But to judge by perception is a comparatively rare accomplishment, and so
most critics continued to employ the foot-rule as if they were measuring
flat surfaces, while occasionally going so far as to recognize the
existence of certain mountain-peaks as “irregular beauties.” In a more or
less conscious distinction from the criticism of external rules there
developed also during the eighteenth century what its representatives were
pleased to call metaphysical criticism, to which we should now probably
apply the term psychological. This consisted in explaining poetic effects
by reference to strictly mental processes in a tone of calm analysis
eminently suited to the rationalistic temper of the age. It methodically
traced the sources of grandeur or of pathos or of humor, and then
illustrated its generalization by the practice of the poets. It could
thereby pride itself on going back of the rules to the fundamental laws of
human nature. Kames’s Elements of Criticism, written in 1761, became a
work of standard reference, though it did not impose on the great critics.
In commending it Dr. Johnson was careful to remark, “I do not mean that he
has taught us anything; but he has told us old things [Pg xxxv]in
a new way.”[37]
But in general Kames was considered a safer guide than the enthusiastic
Longinus, who throughout the century was looked upon with distrust.
“Instead of shewing for what reason a sentiment or image is sublime, and
discovering the secret power by which they affect a reader with pleasure,
he is ever intent on producing something sublime himself, and strokes of
his own eloquence.” So runs the complaint of Joseph Warton.[38] The
distrust was not without ground. The danger that the method of Longinus in
the hands of ungifted writers would become a cloak for critical ignorance
and degenerate into empty bluster was already apparent.[39] Only rarely
was there a reader who could distinguish between the false and the true
application of the method. Gibbon did it in a passage which impressed
itself upon the younger critics of Hazlitt’s generation. “I was acquainted
only with two ways of criticising a beautiful passage: the one, to shew,
by an exact anatomy of it, the distinct beauties of it, and whence they
sprung; the other, an idle exclamation, or a general encomium, which
leaves nothing behind it. Longinus has shewn me that there is a third. He
tells me his own feelings upon reading it; and tells them with such
energy, that he communicates them.”[40] That vital element, the
commentator’s power of communicating his own feelings, constituting as it
does the difference between phrase-making and valuable criticism, did not
become prominent in English literature before the nineteenth century.
The official criticism of the early nineteenth century as represented by
the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews,[Pg xxxvi] derives its descent directly from
the eighteenth. Whatever the Government might have thought of the politics
of the Edinburgh, its literary outlook remained unexceptionably orthodox.
Jeffrey’s “Essay on Beauty” is a direct copy of Alison’s “Essay on Taste.”
Much as Dr. Johnson in the preceding age, Jeffrey prided himself on the
moral tendency of his criticism—a morality which consisted in censuring
the life of Burns and in exalting the virtuous insipidities of Maria
Edgeworth’s tales as it might have been done by any faithful minister of
the gospel. To be sure he cannot be said to have held tenaciously to the
old set of canons. Though he stanchly withstood the new-fangled poetic
practices of Wordsworth and of Southey, he bowed before the great
popularity of Scott and Byron, even at the cost of some of his favorite
maxims. In his writings the solvents of the older criticism are best seen
at work. Jeffrey both by instinct and training was a lawyer, and his
position at the head of the most respected periodical formed a natural
temptation to a dictatorial manner. He was a judge who tried to uphold the
literary constitution but wavered in the face of a strong popular
opposition. When the support of precedent failed him, he remained without
any firm conviction of his own. While his poetic taste was quite adequate
to the appreciation of a Samuel Rogers or a Barry Cornwall, it was
incomparably futile in the perception of a Wordsworth or a Shelley. In a
passage composed at the end of his long editorial career in 1829, he
unconsciously announced his own extinction as a critic:
“Since the beginning of our critical career, we have seen a vast deal of
beautiful poetry pass into oblivion, in spite of our feeble efforts to
recall or retain it in remembrance. The tuneful quartos of Southey are
already little better than lumber:—and the rich melodies of Keats and[Pg xxxvii]
Shelley,—and the fantastical emphasis of Wordsworth,—and the plebeian
pathos of Crabbe, are melting fast from the field of our vision. The
novels of Scott have put out his poetry. Even the splendid strains of
Moore are fading into distance and dimness, except where they have been
married to immortal music; and the blazing star of Byron himself is
receding from its place of pride. We need say nothing of Milman, and
Croly, and Atherstone, and Hood, and a legion of others, who, with no
ordinary gifts of taste and fancy, have not so properly survived their
fame, as been excluded by some hard fatality, from what seemed their just
inheritance. The two who have the longest withstood this rapid withering
of the laurel, and with the least marks of decay on their branches, are
Rogers and Campbell; neither of them, it may be remarked, voluminous
writers, and both distinguished rather for the fine taste and consummate
elegance of their writings, than for that fiery passion, and disdainful
vehemence, which seemed for a time to be so much more in favour with the
public.”[41]
But the authority of Jeffrey did not long remain unchallenged. His
unfortunate “This will never do” became a by-word among the younger
writers who were gradually awaking to the realization of a new spirit in
criticism. The protest against the methods of the dictatorial quarterlies
found expression in the two brilliant monthly periodicals, Blackwood’s and
the London Magazine, founded respectively in 1817 and 1820. In these no
opportunity was neglected to thrust at the inflated pretensions of the
established reviews, and, though the animus of rivalry might be suspected
of playing its part, the blows usually struck home. There is an air of
absolute finality about Lockhart’s “Remarks on the Periodical Criticism of
[Pg xxxviii]England,” and his characterization of Jeffrey in this article is a bold
anticipation of the judgment of posterity.[42] The editor of the London
Magazine[43] writes with equal assurance, “We must protest against
considering the present taste as the standard of excellence, or the
criticisms on poetry in the Edinburgh Review as the voice even of the
present taste.” The test of critical eligibility in this age is an
appreciation of Wordsworth and a proper understanding of Coleridge his
prophet, and it is by virtue of what inspiration they drew from these
oracles that John Lockhart and John Scott became better qualified than
Jeffrey or Gifford to form the literary opinions of the public.
Coleridge more than any other person was responsible for bringing about a
change in the attitude of literature toward criticism. As Hazlitt puts it
with his inimitable vividness, he “threw a great stone into the standing
pool of criticism, which splashed some persons with the mud, but which
gave a motion to the surface and a reverberation to the neighbouring
echoes, which has not since subsided.”[44] Whether his ideas were borrowed
from the Germans or evolved in his own brain, their importance for English
literature remains the same. Coleridge’s service lay in asserting and
reasserting such fundamental principles as that a critical standard is
something quite distinct from a set of external rules; that the
traditional opposition between genius and laws was based on a
misconception as to the function of the critic; that all great genius
necessarily worked in accordance with certain laws which it was the
function of the critic to determine by a study of each particular work of
art; that art, being vital and organic, assumed different shapes at
different epochs of human[Pg xxxix] culture; that only the spirit of poetry
remained constant, while its form was molded anew by each age in
accordance with the demands of its own life; that it was no more
reasonable to judge Shakespeare’s plays by the practice of Sophocles than
to judge sculpture by the rules of painting. “O! few have there been among
critics, who have followed with the eye of their imagination the
imperishable yet ever wandering spirit of poetry through its various
metempsychoses; or who have rejoiced with the light of clear perception at
beholding with each new birth, with each rare avatar, the human race
frame to itself a new body, by assimilating materials of nourishment out
of its new circumstances, and work for itself new organs of power
appropriate to the new sphere of its motion and activity.”[45] This rare
grasp of general principles was combined in Coleridge with poetic vision
and a declamatory eloquence which enabled him to seize on the more ardent
and open-minded men of letters and to determine their critical viewpoint.
William Hazlitt was among the earliest to fall under Coleridge’s spell.
Just how much he owed to Coleridge beyond the initial impulse it is
impossible to prove, because so much of the latter’s criticism was
expressed during improvised monologues at the informal meetings of
friends, or in lectures of which only fragmentary notes remain. At any
rate, while Coleridge’s chief distinction lay in the enunciation of
general principles, Hazlitt’s practice, in so far as it took account of
these general principles at all, assumed their existence, and displayed
its strength in concrete judgments of individual literary works. His
criticism may be said to imply at every step the existence of Coleridge’s,
or to rise like an elegant superstructure on the solid foundation which
the other had laid. Hazlitt[Pg xl] communicated to the general public that love
and appreciation of great literature which Coleridge inspired only in the
few elect. The latter, even more distinctly than a poet for poets, was a
critic for critics,[46] and three generations have not succeeded in
absorbing all his doctrines. But Hazlitt, with a delicate sensitiveness to
the impressions of genius, with a boundless zest of poetic enjoyment, with
a firm common sense to control his taste, and with a gift of original
expression unequalled in his day, arrested the attention of the ordinary
reader and made effective the principles which Coleridge with some
vagueness had projected. To analyze in cold blood such living criticism as
Hazlitt’s may expose one to unflattering imputations, but the attempt may
serve to bring to light what is so often overlooked, that Hazlitt’s
criticism is no random, irresponsible discharge of his sensibilities, but
has an implicit basis of sound theory.
In his History of Criticism, Mr. Saintsbury takes as his motto for the
section on the early nineteenth century a sentence from Sainte-Beuve to
the effect that nearly the whole art of the critic consists in knowing how
to read a book with judgment and without ceasing to relish it.[47] We are
almost ready to believe that the French critic, in the significant choice
of the words judgment and relish, is consciously summarizing the method of
Hazlitt, the more so as he elsewhere explicitly confesses a sympathy with
the English critic.[48] Hazlitt has indeed himself characterized his art
in some such terms. In one of his lectures he modestly describes his
undertaking “merely to read over a set of authors with the audience, as I
would do with [Pg xli]a friend, to point out a favorite passage, to explain an
objection; or if a remark or a theory occurs, to state it in illustration
of the subject, but neither to tire him nor puzzle myself with pedantical
rules and pragmatical formulas of criticism that can do no good to
anybody.”[49] This sounds dangerously like dilettantism. It suggests the
method of what in our day is called impressionism, one of the most
delightful forms of literary entertainment when practiced by a master of
literature. The impressionist’s aim is to record whatever impinges on his
brain, and though with a writer of fine discernment it is sure to be
productive of exquisite results, as criticism it is undermined by the
impressionist’s assumption that every appreciation is made valid by the
very fact of its existence. But this was scarcely Hazlitt’s idea of
criticism. Against universal suffrage in matters literary he would have
been among the first to protest. We might almost imagine we were listening
to some orthodox theorist of the eighteenth century when we hear him
declaring that the object of taste “must be that, not which does, but
which would please universally, supposing all men to have paid an equal
attention to any subject and to have an equal relish for it, which can
only be guessed at by the imperfect and yet more than casual agreement
among those who have done so from choice and feeling.”[50] Though not the
surest kind of clue, this indicates at least that Hazlitt’s rejection of
“pedantical rules and pragmatical formulas” was not equivalent to a
declaration of anarchy.
For Hazlitt the assertion of individual taste meant emancipation from
arbitrary codes and an opportunity to embrace a compass as wide as the
range of literary excellence. Realizing that every reader, even the
professed critic, is [Pg xlii]hemmed in by certain prejudices arising from his
temperament, his education, his environment, he was unwilling to pledge
his trust to any school or fashion of criticism. The favorite oppositions
of his generation—Shakespeare and Pope, Fielding and Richardson, English
poetry and French—had no meaning for him. He was glad to enjoy each in
its kind. “The language of taste and moderation is, I prefer this,
because it is best to me; the language of dogmatism and intolerance is,
Because I prefer it, it is best in itself, and I will allow no one else
to be of a different opinion.”[51] This passage, in connection with the
one last quoted, may be considered as fixing the limits within which
Hazlitt gave scope to personal preference. The sum of his literary
judgments reveals a taste for a greater variety of the works of genius
than is displayed by any contemporary, and the absence of “a catholic and
many-sided sympathy”[52] is one of the last imputations that should have
been brought against him. His criticism has limitations, but not such as
are due to a narrowness of literary perception.
Even Hazlitt’s shortcomings may frequently be turned to his glory as a
critic. The most remarkable thing about his violent political prejudices
is the success with which he dissociated his literary estimates from them.
Such a serious limitation in a critic as deficiency of reading in his case
only raises our astonishment at the sureness of instinct which enabled him
to pronounce unerringly on the scantest information. Never was there a
critic of nearly equal pretensions who had as little of the scholar’s
equipment. If, as he tells us, he applied himself too closely to his
studies at a certain period in his youth,[53] he atoned for it by his
[Pg xliii]neglect of books in later
life.[54] A desultory education had left him
without that intimacy with the classics which belonged of right to every
cultivated Englishman. His allusions to the Greek and Latin writers are in
the most general terms, but with a note of reverence which did not enter
into his speech concerning even Shakespeare. “I would have you learn Latin
(he is writing to his son) because there is an atmosphere round this sort
of classical ground, to which that of actual life is gross and
vulgar.”[55] His knowledge of Italian was no more thorough, though here he
was more nearly on a level with his contemporaries. For Boccaccio indeed
he showed an intense affection, and he could write intelligently, if not
deeply, concerning Dante and Ariosto and Tasso.[56] With French he
naturally had a wider acquaintance, but still nothing beyond the reach of
the very general reader. The notable point is that he refrains from
passing judgment on the entire body of French poetry because it is unlike
English poetry. He is not infected with the wilful provincialism of Lamb
nor with the spirit of John Bullishness which seriously proclaims in its
rivals “equally a want of books and men.”[57] “We may be sure of this,”
says Hazlitt, “that when we see nothing but grossness and barbarism, or
insipidity and verbiage in a writer that is the God of a nation’s
idolatry, it is we and not they who want true taste and feeling.”[58]
Having this wholesome counsel ever before him, he can be more generously
appreciative of the genius of Molière, more justly discerning in his
analysis of the spirit of [Pg xliv]Rousseau,[59]
and more free of the puritanical
clatter against Voltaire than any of his fellow-critics. With German
literature his familiarity was bounded on the one hand by Schiller’s
“Robbers,” on the other by the first part of “Faust,” the entire gap
between these being filled by the popular versions of Kotzebue’s plays and
Mme. de Staël’s book on Germany. Yet he dared to write a character of the
German people which is almost worth quoting.[60]
In English his range of reading was correspondingly narrow. Such a piece
of waywardness as his enthusiasm for John Buncle,[61] derived no doubt
from Lamb, is unique. Broadly speaking, he prefers to accept the
established canon and approaches new discoveries with a deep distrust. He
is very little concerned with writers of the second order, and in his
Lecture on the Living Poets he shocked his audience unspeakably, when he
came to the name of Hannah More, by merely remarking, “She has written a
great deal which I have never read.” He looked upon most living writers
through the eyes of the somewhat jaded reviewer, who, though susceptible
to a romantic thrill from one or the other, is usually on his guard
against spurious blandishments and reluctant to admit the claims of new
pretenders. Even in poets of the first rank he slurred over a great deal;
but what he loved he dwelt on with a kind of rapt inspiration until it
became his second nature, its spirit and its language fused intimately
with his own. [Pg xlv]This revolutionist in politics was a jealous aristocrat in
the domains of art, and this admission does not impair our earlier
assertion of his openness to a greater variety of impressions than any of
his contemporaries in criticism.
Hazlitt’s professed indifference to system is probably due as much to lack
of deep reading as to romantic impatience of restraint. When he declared
that it was beyond his powers “to condense and combine all the facts
relating to a subject”[62] or that “he had
no head for arrangement,”[63]
it was only because he did not happen to be a master of the facts which
required combination or arrangement. For he did have an unusual gift for
penetrating to the core of a subject and tearing out the heart of its
mystery; in fact, his power of concrete literary generalization was in his
age unmatched. To reveal the distinctive virtue of a literary form, to
characterize the sources of weakness or of strength in a new or a by-gone
fashion of poetry, to analyze accurately the forces impelling a whole
mighty age—these things, requiring a deep and steady concentration of
mind, are among his most solid achievements. In a paragraph he distils for
us the essence of what is picturesque and worth dwelling on in the comedy
of the Restoration. In a page he triumphantly establishes the
boundary-line between the poetry of art and nature—Pope and
Shakespeare—which to the present day remains as a clear guide, while at
the same time Campbell and Byron and Bowles are filling the periodicals
with protracted and often irrelevant arguments on one side or the other
which only the critically curious now venture to look into. In the space
of a single lecture he takes a sweeping view of all the great movements
which gave vitality and grandeur to the Elizabethan spirit and found a
voice in its literature, so that in spite of his little [Pg xlvi]learning he seems
to have left nothing for his followers but to fill in his outline. The
same keenness of discernment he applied casually in dissecting the genius
of his own time. He associated the absence of drama with the French
Revolution, its tendency to deal in abstractions and to regard everything
in relation to man and not men—a tendency irreconcilable with dramatic
literature, which is essentially individual and concrete.[64] To be sure
the eighteenth century before the Revolution was as void of drama as
Hazlitt’s generation, but what is true of the period which produced
Political Justice and the Edinburgh Review would hold equally of the time
which produced the “Essay on Man” and the deistic controversy. He
sometimes harshly exposes the weaker side of contemporary lyricism as a
“mere effusion of natural sensibility,” and he regrets the absence of
“imaginary splendor and human passion” as of a glory departed.[65] But
with all this he had the true historical sense. It breaks out most
unmistakably when he says, “If literature in our day has taken this
decided turn into a critical channel, is it not a presumptive proof that
it ought to do so?”[66] Of the actual application of historical principles,
which were just beginning to be realized in the study of literature, we
find only a few faint traces in Hazlitt. Some remarks on the influence of
climate and of religious and political institutions occur in his
contributions to the Edinburgh, but occasionally their perfunctory manner
suggests the editorial pen of Jeffrey. Doubtless Hazlitt’s discriminating
judgment would have enabled him to excel in this field, had he been
equipped with the necessary learning.
It may also be a serious limitation of Hazlitt’s that he [Pg xlvii]neglects
questions of structure and design. Doubtless he was reacting against the
jargon of the older criticism with its lifeless and monotonous repetitions
about invention and fable and unity, giving nothing but the “superficial
plan and elevation, as if a poem were a piece of formal architecture.”[67]
In avoiding the study of the design of “Paradise Lost” or of the “Faerie
Queene” he may have brought his criticism nearer to the popular taste; but
he deliberately shut himself off from a vision of some of the higher
reaches of poetic art, perhaps betraying thereby that lack of
“imagination” with which he has sometimes been charged.[68] His
interpretation of an author is therefore occasionally in danger of
becoming an appreciation of isolated characters, or scenes, or passages,
as if he were actually reading him over with his audience. But this is a
limitation which Hazlitt shares with all the finer critics of his day.
After all these shortcomings have been acknowledged, the permanence of
Hazlitt’s achievement appears only the more remarkable. It is clear that
the gods made him critical. The two essential qualities of judgment and
taste he seems to have possessed from the very beginning. It is impossible
to trace in him any development of taste; his growth is but the succession
of his literary experiences. One looks in vain for any of those errors of
youth such as are met even in a Coleridge enamored of Bowles. What
extravagance of tone Hazlitt displayed in his early criticism he carried
with him to his last day. If any change is to be noted, it is in the
growing keenness of his appreciation. The early maturity of his judicial
powers is attested by the political and metaphysical tendency of his
youthful [Pg xlviii]studies. His birth as a full-fledged critic awaited only the
stirring of the springs of his eloquence, as is evident from the
excellence of what is practically his first literary essay, the “Character
of Burke.”
No critic has approached books with so intense a passion as Hazlitt. That
sentimental fondness for the volumes themselves, especially when enriched
by the fragrance of antiquity, which gives so delicious a savor to the
bookishness of Lamb, was in him conspicuously absent. For him books were
only a more vivid aspect of life itself. “Tom Jones,” he tells us, was the
novel that first broke the spell of his daily tasks and made of the world
“a dance through life, a perpetual gala-day.”[69] Keats could not have
romped through the “Faerie Queene” with more spirit than did Hazlitt
through the length and breadth of eighteenth century romance, and the
young poet’s awe before the majesty of Homer was hardly greater than that
of the future critic when a Milton or a Wordsworth swam into his ken. This
hot and eager interest, deprived of its outlet in the form of direct
emulation, sought a vent in communicating itself to others and in making
converts to its faith. So intimately did Hazlitt feel the spell of a work
of genius, that its life-blood was transfused into his own almost against
his will. “I wish,” he exclaims, “I had never read the Emilius ... I had
better have formed myself on the model of Sir Fopling Flutter.”[70] He
entered into the poet’s creation with a sympathy amounting almost to
poetic vision, and the ever-present sense of the reality of the artist’s
world led him to interpret literature primarily in relation to life. The
poetry of character and passion is what he regards of most essential
interest.[71] This point of view unintentionally converts his familiar
essays on life into a literary[Pg xlix] discourse, and gives to his formal
criticism the tone of a study of life at its sources, raising it at once
to the same level with creative literature. Though he nowhere employs the
now familiar formula of “literature and life,” the lecture “On Poetry in
General” is largely an exposition of this outlook.
Life in its entire compass is regarded as the rough material of
literature, but it does not become literature until the artist’s
imagination, as with a divine ray, has penetrated the mass and inspired it
with an ideal existence. Among the numerous attempts of his contemporaries
to define the creative faculty of the poet, this comparatively simple one
of Hazlitt’s is worth noting. “This intuitive perception of the hidden
analogies of things, or, as it may be called, this instinct of
imagination, is perhaps what stamps the character of genius on the
productions of art more than any other circumstance: for it works
unconsciously, like nature, and receives its impressions from a kind of
inspiration.”[72] It is this power that he has in mind when he says
“Poetry is infusing the same spirit in a number of things, or bathing them
all as it were, in the same overflowing sense of delight.”[73] It shows
Hazlitt to have fully apprehended the guiding principle of the new ideal
of criticism which, looking upon the work of art as an act of original
creation and not of mechanical composition, based its judgment on a direct
sympathy with the artist’s mind instead of resorting to a general rule. In
the light of this principle he is enabled to avoid the pitfalls of a
moralistic interpretation of literature and to decide the question as to
the relative importance of substance and treatment with a certainty which
seems to preclude the possibility of any other answer.
[Pg l]It is not the dignity of the theme which constitutes the great work of
art, for in that case a prose summary of the “Divine Comedy” would be as
exalted as the original, and it would be necessary merely to know the
subject of a poem in order to pass judgment upon it. A low or a trivial
subject may be raised by the imagination of the artist who recognizes in
it the elements of beauty or power. No definition of poetry can be worth
anything which would exclude “The Rape of the Lock”; and Murillo’s
painting of “The Two Beggar Boys” is as much worth having “as almost any
picture in the world.”[74] “Yet it is not true that execution is
everything, and the class or subject nothing. The highest subjects,
equally well-executed (which, however, rarely happens), are the best.”[75]
Though each is perfect in its kind, there can be no difficulty in deciding
the question of greatness between “King Lear” and “The Comedy of Errors.”
“The greatest strength of genius is shewn in describing the strongest
passions: for the power of imagination, in works of invention, must be in
proportion to the force of the natural impressions, which are the subject
of them.”[76] One also finds a test of relative values in the measure of
fulness with which the work of art reflects the complex elements of life.
If we estimate a tragedy of Shakespeare above one of Lillo or Moore, it is
because “impassioned poetry is an emanation of the moral and intellectual
part of our nature, as well as of the sensitive—of the desire to know,
the will to act, and the power to feel; and ought to appeal to these
different parts of the constitution, in order to be perfect.”[77]
In treating of the specific distinction of poetry Hazlitt [Pg li]does not escape
the usual difficulties. Taking his point of departure from Milton’s
“thoughts that voluntary move harmonious numbers,” he defines poetry in a
passage that satisfactorily anticipates the familiar one of Carlyle, as
“the music of language answering to the music of the mind.... Wherever any
object takes such a hold of the mind as to make us dwell upon it, and
brood over it, melting the heart in tenderness, or kindling it to a
sentiment of enthusiasm;—wherever a movement of imagination or passion is
impressed on the mind, by which it seeks to prolong or repeat the emotion,
to bring all other objects into accord with it, and to give the same
movement of harmony, sustained and continuous, or gradually varied
according to the occasion, to the sounds that express it—this is poetry.
The musical in sound is the sustained and continuous; the musical in
thought is the sustained and continuous also. There is a near connection
between music and deep-rooted passion.”[78] In this mystical direction a
definition could go no further, but like nearly all writers and speakers
Hazlitt is inclined to use the word poetry in a variety of more or less
connected meanings,[79] ordinarily legitimate enough, but somewhat
embarrassing when it is a question of definition. “That which lifts the
spirit above the earth, which draws the soul out of itself with
indescribable longings, is,” he says, “poetry in kind, and generally fit
to become so in name, by ‘being married to immortal verse.’”[80] If it is
true that Pilgrim’s Progress and Robinson Crusoe possess the “essence and
the power of poetry” [Pg lii]and require only the addition of verse to become
absolutely so,[81] then the musical expression is only a factitious
ornament, to be added or removed at the caprice of the writer. But Hazlitt
is careful to declare that verse does not make the whole difference
between poetry and prose, leaving the whole question as vaguely suspended
as ever.[82]
Bare theorizing, according to his own confession, was no favorite pursuit
with Hazlitt. He enjoyed himself much more in the analysis of an
individual author or his work. His aversion to literary cant, his love of
“saying things that are his own in a way of his own,” were here most in
evidence. What he says of Milton might appropriately be applied to
himself, that he formed the most intense conception of things and then
embodied them by a single stroke of his pen. In a phrase or in a sentence
he stamped the character of an author indelibly, and, enemy to commonplace
though he was, became a cause of commonplace in others. No matter how much
might already have been written on a subject (and Hazlitt did not make a
practice of celebrating neglected obscurity) his own view stood out fresh
and clear, and yet his judgments were never eccentric. He wrestled with a
writer’s thoughts, absorbed his most passionate feelings, and mirrored
back his most exquisite perceptions with “all the color, the light and the
shade.” His fertility is more amazing than his intensity, for no critic of
nearly equal rank has enriched English literature with so many valuable
and enduring judgments on so great a variety of subjects. Dr. Johnson is
by common consent the spokesman of the eighteenth century, or of its
dominant class; Coleridge and [Pg liii]Lamb are entitled to the glory of revealing
the literature between Spenser and Milton to English readers, and the
former rendered the additional service of acting as the interpreter of
Wordsworth. But to give an idea of Hazlitt’s scope would require a summary
of opinions embracing poetry from Chaucer and Spenser to Wordsworth and
Byron, prose sacred and profane from Bacon and Jeremy Taylor to Burke and
Edward Irving, the drama in its two flourishing periods, the familiar
essay from Steele and Addison to Lamb and Leigh Hunt, the novel from Defoe
to Sir Walter Scott. This does not begin to suggest Hazlitt’s versatility.
His own modest though somewhat over-alliterative words are that he has “at
least glanced over a number of subjects—painting, poetry, prose, plays,
politics, parliamentary speakers, metaphysical lore, books, men, and
things.”[83]
The importance of Hazlitt’s Shakespearian criticism is no longer open to
question. Though Coleridge alluded to them slightingly as out-and-out
imitations of Lamb,[84] Hazlitt’s dicta on the greatest English genius are
equal in depth to Lamb’s and far more numerous; and while in profoundness
and subtlety they fall short of the remarks of Coleridge himself, they
surpass them in intensity and carrying power. To both of these men Hazlitt
owed a great deal in his appreciation of Shakespeare, and perhaps even
more to August Wilhelm Schlegel, whose Lectures on Dramatic Literature he
reviewed in 1815.[85] His allusions to Schlegel border on enthusiasm and
he makes it a proud claim that he has done “more than any one except
Schlegel to vindicate the Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays [Pg liv]from the
stigma of French criticism.”[86] But however great his obligation, there
was some point in the compliment of the German critic when he declared
that Hazlitt had gone beyond him (l’avoit dépassé) in his Shakespearian
opinions.[87] A few years later Heine maintained that the only significant
commentator of Shakespeare produced by England was William Hazlitt.[88]
Coleridge’s notes, it is to be remembered, were not at that time generally accessible.
Hazlitt’s attitude toward Shakespeare was wholesomely on this side of
idolatry. He did not make it an article of faith to admire everything that
Shakespeare had written, and refused his praise to the poems and most of
the sonnets. Even Schlegel and Coleridge could not persuade him to see
beauties in what appeared to be blemishes, but in a general estimate of
Shakespeare’s all-embracing genius he conceived his faults to be “of just
as much consequence as his bad spelling.”[89] He saw in him a genius who
comprehended all humanity, who represented it poetically in all its shades
and varieties. He examined all the fine distinctions of character, he
studied Shakespeare’s manner of combining and contrasting them so as to
produce a unity of tone above even the art of the classic unities. From
the irresponsible comedy of Falstaff to the deepest tragic notes of Lear,
the whole gamut of human emotions encounters responsive chords in the
critic’s mind—the young love of Romeo and Juliet or the voluptuous
abandonment of Antony and Cleopatra, the intellect of Iago irresistibly
impelled to malignant activity or Hamlet entangled in the coils of a fatal
introspection. To the sheer poetry of [Pg lv]Shakespeare he is also acutely
sensitive, to the soft moonlit atmosphere of the “Midsummernight’s Dream,”
to the tender gloom of “Cymbeline,” to the “philosophic poetry” of “As You
Like It.” Some of his interpretations of isolated passages are hardly to
be surpassed. He comments minutely and exquisitely on what he considers to
be a touchstone of poetic feeling,
“Daffodils
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty.”[90]
And with what complete insight he translates a speech of Antony’s:
“This precarious state and the approaching dissolution of his greatness
are strikingly displayed in the dialogue of Antony with Eros:
‘Antony. Eros, thou yet behold’st me?

Eros. Ay, noble lord.

Antony. Sometime we see a cloud that’s dragonish;
A vapour sometime, like a bear or lion,
A towered citadel, a pendant rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
With trees upon’t, that nod unto the world
And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs,
They are black vesper’s pageants.

Eros. Ay, my lord.

Antony. That which is now a horse, even with a thought
The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct
As water is in water.

Eros. It does, my lord.

Antony. My good knave, Eros, now thy captain is
Even such a body,’ etc.
 
“This is, without doubt, one of the finest pieces of poetry in Shakspeare.
The splendour of the imagery, the semblance of reality, the lofty range of
picturesque objects [Pg lvi]hanging over the world, their evanescent nature, the
total uncertainty of what is left behind, are just like the mouldering
schemes of human greatness. It is finer than Cleopatra’s passionate
lamentation over his fallen grandeur, because it is more dim, unstable,
unsubstantial.”[91]
If an understanding of Shakespeare in Hazlitt’s day may be taken as a
measure of a critic’s depth of insight, his attitude toward Shakespeare’s
fellow-dramatists will just as surely reveal his powers of discrimination.
Lamb was often carried away by a pioneer’s fervor and misled persons like
Lowell, who, returning to Ford late in life, found “that the greater part
of what [he] once took on trust as precious was really paste and
pinchbeck,” and that as far as the celebrated closing scene in “The Broken
Heart” was concerned, Charles Lamb’s comment on it was “worth more than
all Ford ever wrote.”[92] Hazlitt’s dispassionate sanity in this instance
forms an instructive contrast: “Except the last scene of the Broken Heart
(which I think extravagant—others may think it sublime, and be right)
they [Ford’s plays] are merely exercises of style and effusion of
wire-drawn sentiment.”[93] The same strength of judgment rendered Hazlitt
proof against the excessive sentimentality in Beaumont and Fletcher and
gave a distinct value to his opinions even when they seemed to be wrong,
which was not often. But in writing of Marlowe, of Dekker and of Webster,
he spreads out all his sail to make a joyous run among the beauties in his
course.
And it is so with the rest of his criticism—throughout the same
susceptibility to all that is true, or lofty, or refined, vigilantly
controlled by a firm common sense, the [Pg lvii]same stamp of originality
unmistakably impressed on all. “I like old opinions with new reasons,” he
once said to Northcote, “not new opinions without any.”[94] But he did not
hesitate to express a new opinion where the old one appeared to be unjust.
His heretical preference of Steele over Addison has found more than one
convert in later days. On Spenser or Pope, on Fielding or Richardson, he
is equally happy and unimprovable. In the opinion of Mr. Saintsbury,
Hazlitt’s general lecture on Elizabethan literature, his treatment of the
dramatists of the Restoration, of Pope, of the English Novelists, and of
Cobbett have never been excelled; and who is better qualified than Mr.
Saintsbury by width of reading to express such an opinion?[95]
Of Hazlitt’s treatment of his own contemporaries an additional word needs
to be said. No charge has been repeated more often than that of the
inconsistency, perversity, and utter unreliableness of his judgments on
the writers of his day. To distinguish between the claims of living poets,
particularly in an age of new ideas and changing forms, is a task which
might test the powers of the most discerning critics, and in which
perfection is hardly to be attained. Yet one may ask whether in the entire
extent of Hazlitt’s writing a great living genius has been turned into a
mockery or a figurehead been set up for the admiration of posterity. Of
his personal and political antipathies enough has been said, but against
literary orthodoxy his only great sin is a harsh review of
“Christabel.”[96] If in general we look at the age through Hazlitt’s eyes,
we shall see its literature dominated by the figures [Pg lviii]of Wordsworth and
Scott, the one regarded as the restorer of life to poetry, the other as
the creator or transcriber of a whole world of romance and humanity.
Coleridge stands out prominently as the widest intellect of his age.
Byron’s poetry bulks very large, though it is not estimated as
superlatively as in the criticism of our own day. It is a pity that
Hazlitt never wrote formally of Keats, for his casual allusions indicate a
deep enjoyment of the “rich beauties and the dim obscurities” of the “Eve
of St. Agnes”[97] and an appreciation of the perfection of the great
odes.[98] If he failed to give Shelley his full dues, he did not overlook
his exquisite lyrical inspiration. He spoke of Shelley as a man of genius,
but “‘all air,’ disdaining the bars and ties of mortal mould;” he praised
him for “single thoughts of great depth and force, single images of rare
beauty, detached passages of extreme tenderness,” and he rose to
enthusiasm in commending his translations, especially the scenes from
Faust.[99] He has been accused of writing a Spirit of the Age which
omitted to give an account of Shelley and Keats, but in the title of the
book consists his excuse. As it was not his idea to anticipate the
decision of posterity but only to sketch the personalities who were in
control of the public attention, he passed over the finer poets who were
still neglected, and wrote instead about Campbell and Moore and Crabbe. It
is sufficient praise for the critic that those of whom he has undertaken
to treat stand irreversibly judged in his pages. He is generous toward
Campbell and Moore, who were both personally hostile to him; he is
scrupulously honest toward Bentham, with whose system he had no sympathy.
The concluding pages of his sketch of Southey, in view of that [Pg lix]poet’s
rancor against him, are almost defiant in their magnanimity. His adverse
judgments, moreover, are as permanent as his favorable ones. He pronounced
the verdict against the naked realism of Crabbe’s poetry, which persons
like Jeffrey thought superior to Wordsworth’s, and he pricked the bubble
of Edward Irving’s popularity while it was at its pitch of highest glory.
If he was often bitter toward men whom he at other times eulogized, it was
in the heat and hurry of journalistic publication in a period when blows
were freely dealt and freely taken. If he sometimes censured even
Wordsworth and Scott and grew impatient with Byron and Coleridge, it must
be remembered that these men of genius had imperfections, and that the
imperfections of men of genius are of far greater concern to their
contemporaries than to posterity. Time dispels the mists and allows the
gross matter to settle to the bottom. We now have Wordsworth in the
selections of Matthew Arnold, we read the Waverley Novels with Lockhart’s
Life of Scott before us, and we render praise to Coleridge for what he has
accomplished since his death. With none of these advantages, Hazlitt’s
performance seems remarkable enough. No contemporary with the exception of
Leigh Hunt displayed as wide a sympathy with the writers of that time, and
Hazlitt so far surpasses Hunt in discrimination and strength, that he
deserves to be called, strange as it may sound, the best contemporary
judge of the literature of his age.
It has already been suggested that much of Hazlitt’s appeal as a critic
rests on the force of his popular eloquence, so that a brief consideration
of his prose is not in this connection out of place. “We may all be fine
fellows,” said Stevenson, “but none of us can write like Hazlitt.” To
write a style that is easy yet incisive, lively and at the same time
substantial, buoyant without being frothy,[Pg lx] glittering but with no tinsel
frippery, a style combining the virtues of homeliness and picturesqueness,
has been given to few mortals. Writing in a generation in which the
standards of prose were conspicuously unsettled, when the most ambitious
writers were seeking an escape from the frozen patterns of the eighteenth
century in a restoration of the elaborate artifices of the seventeenth,
when quaintness and ornateness were the evidence of a distinguished style,
Hazlitt succeeded in preserving the note of familiarity without fading
into colorlessness or in any degree effacing his individuality. He cannot
be counted among the masters of finished prose, he is as a matter of fact
often very negligent,[100] but he developed the best model of an
undiluted, sturdy, popular style that is to be found in the English
language.
Perhaps an adherence to the eighteenth century tradition of plainness is
the most prominent characteristic of Hazlitt’s prose. But his plainness is
not precisely of the blunt type associated with Swift and Arbuthnot. It is
modified by the Gallic tone of easy familiarity, by the ideal deemed
appropriate for dignified converse among educated people of the world. His
periods are of the simplest construction and they are not methodically
combined in the artificial patterns beloved of the eighteenth century
followers of the plain style. Not that he altogether neglects the devices
of parallelism and antithesis when he wishes to give epigrammatic point to
his remarks, but he more generally develops his ideas in a series of
easily flowing sentences which are as near as writing can be to “the tone
of lively and sensible [Pg lxi]conversation.” It is impossible to match in the
English essay such talk as Hazlitt reproduces in his accounts of the
evenings at Lamb’s room or of his meeting with Coleridge, in which high
themes and spirited eloquence find spontaneous and unaffected expression
through the same medium as might be employed in a deliberate definition of
the nature of poetry. The various sets of lectures are pitched in the same
conversational key and are found adequate to conveying a notion of the
grandeur of Milton as well as of the familiarity of Lamb.
Those who have praised Hazlitt’s simplicity have often given the
impression that his prose is a single-stringed instrument, and have failed
to suggest the range comprised between the simple hammer-strokes of the
essay on Cobbett and the magnificent diapason in which he unrolls the
panorama of Coleridge’s mind. In both passages there is the same
sentence-norm. In the first, the periods, not bound by any connecting
words, strike distinctly, sharply, with staccato abruptness. The movement
is that of a clean-limbed wrestler struggling with confident energy to pin
down a difficult opponent:
“His principle is repulsion, his nature contradiction: he is made up of
mere antipathies; an Ishmaelite indeed, without a fellow. He is always
playing at hunt-the-slipper in politics. He turns round upon whoever is
next to him. The way to wean him from any opinion, and make him conceive
an intolerable hatred against it, would be to place somebody near him who
was perpetually dinning it in his ears. When he is in England, he does
nothing but abuse the Boroughmongers, and laugh at the whole system: when
he is in America, he grows impatient of freedom and a republic. If he had
staid there a little longer, he would have become a loyal and a loving
subject of his Majesty King George IV. He lampooned the French Revolution[Pg lxii]
when it was hailed as the dawn of liberty by millions: by the time it was
brought into almost universal ill-odour by some means or other (partly no
doubt by himself) he had turned, with one or two or three others, staunch
Bonapartist. He is always of the militant, not of the triumphant party: so
far he bears a gallant show of magnanimity; but his gallantry is hardly of
the right stamp: it wants principle. For though he is not servile or
mercenary, he is the victim of self-will. He must pull down and pull in
pieces: it is not in his disposition to do otherwise. It is a pity; for
with his great talents he might do great things, if he would go right
forward to any useful object, make thorough-stitch work of any question,
or join hand and heart with any principle. He changes his opinions as he
does his friends, and much on the same account. He has no comfort in fixed
principles: as soon as anything is settled in his own mind, he quarrels
with it. He has no satisfaction but in the chase after truth, runs a
question down, worries and kills it, then quits it like vermin, and starts
some new game, to lead him a new dance, and give him a fresh breathing
through bog and brake, with the rabble yelping at his heels and the
leaders perpetually at fault.”[101]
In the other passage the clauses and phrases follow in their natural
order, but they are united by the simplest kind of connective device in an
undistinguishable stream over which the reader is driven with a steady
swell and fall, sometimes made breathlessly rapid by the succession of its
uniformly measured word-groups, but delicately modulated here and there to
provide restful pauses in the long onward career:
“Next, he was engaged with Hartley’s tribes of mind, ‘etherial braid,
thought-woven,’—and he busied himself for a year or two with vibrations
and vibratiuncles and the [Pg lxiii]great law of association that binds all things
in its mystic chain, and the doctrine of Necessity (the mild teacher of
Charity) and the Millennium, anticipative of a life to come—and he
plunged deep into the controversy on Matter and Spirit, and, as an escape
from Dr. Priestley’s Materialism, where he felt himself imprisoned by the
logician’s spell, like Ariel in the cloven pine-tree, he became suddenly
enamoured of Bishop Berkeley’s fairy-world, and used in all companies to
build the universe, like a brave poetical fiction, of fine words—and he
was deep-read in Malebranche, and in Cudworth’s Intellectual System (a
huge pile of learning, unwieldly, enormous) and in Lord Brook’s
hieroglyphic theories, and in Bishop Butler’s Sermons, and in the Duchess
of Newcastle’s fantastic folios, and in Clarke and South and Tillotson,
and all the fine thinkers and masculine reasoners of that age—and
Leibnitz’s Pre-established Harmony reared its arch above his head, like
the rainbow in the cloud, covenanting with the hopes of man—and then he
fell plump, ten thousand fathoms down (but his wings saved him harmless)
into the hortus siccus of Dissent” etc.[102]
The same style which glistens and sparkles in describing the fancy of Pope
rises to an inspired chant with a clearly defined cadence at the
recollection of the past glory of Coleridge:
“He was the first poet I ever knew. His genius at that time had angelic
wings, and fed on manna. He talked on for ever; and you wished him to talk
on for ever. His thoughts did not seem to come with labour and effort; but
as if borne on the gusts of genius, and as if the wings of his imagination
lifted him from off his feet. His voice rolled on the ear like the pealing
organ, and its sound alone was the music of thought. His mind was clothed
with wings; and raised on them, he lifted philosophy to [Pg lxiv]heaven. In his
descriptions, you then saw the progress of human happiness and liberty in
bright and never-ending succession, like the steps of Jacob’s ladder, with
airy shapes ascending and descending, and with the voice of God at the top
of the ladder. And shall I, who heard him then, listen to him now? Not I!
That spell is broke; that time is gone for ever; that voice is heard no
more: but still the recollection comes rushing by with thoughts of
long-past years, and rings in my ears with never-dying sound.”[103]
It would take much space to illustrate all the notes to which Hazlitt’s
voice responds—the pithy epigram of the Characteristics, the
Chesterfieldian grace in his advice “On the Conduct of Life,” the
palpitating movement with which he gives expression to his keen enjoyment
of his sensual or intellectual existence, and the subdued solemnity of his
reveries which sometimes remind us that he was writing in an age which had
rediscovered Sir Thomas Browne. The following sentence proves how
accurately he could catch the rhythm of the seventeenth century. “That we
should wear out by slow stages, and dwindle at last into nothing, is not
wonderful, when even in our prime our strongest impressions leave little
trace but for the moment, and we are the creatures of petty
circumstance.”[104] Other passages in the same essay echo this manner only
less strikingly:
[Pg lxv]“Life is indeed a strange gift, and its privileges are most mysterious. No
wonder when it is first granted to us, that our gratitude, our admiration,
and our delight, should prevent us from reflecting on our own nothingness,
or from thinking it will ever be recalled. Our first and strongest
impressions are borrowed from the mighty scene that is opened to us, and
we unconsciously transfer its durability as well as its splendour to
ourselves. So newly found we cannot think of parting with it yet, or at
least put off that consideration sine die. Like a rustic at a fair, we
are full of amazement and rapture, and have no thought of going home, or
that it will soon be night. We know our existence only by ourselves, and
confound our knowledge with the objects of it. We and nature are therefore
one. Otherwise the illusion, the ‘feast of reason and the flow of soul,’
to which we are invited, is a mockery and a cruel insult. We do not go
from a play till the last act is ended, and the lights are about to be
extinguished. But the fairy face of nature still shines on: shall we be
called away before the curtain falls, or ere we have scarce had a glimpse
of what is going on? Like children, our step-mother nature holds us up to
see the raree-show of the universe, and then, as if we were a burden to
her to support, lets us fall down again. Yet what brave sublunary things
does not this pageant present, like a ball or fête of the
universe!”[105]
In Hazlitt’s vocabulary there is nothing striking unless it be the
scrupulousness with which he avoids the danger of commonplaceness and of
pedantry. It is easy to forget that the transparent obviousness of his
style was attained only after many years of groping. We may well believe
[Pg lxvi]that “there is a research in the choice of a plain, as well as of an
ornamental or learned style; and, in fact, a great deal more.”[106] Though
he did not go in pursuit of the word to the extent of some later refiners
of style, he had a clear realization that the appropriate word was what
chiefly gave vitality to writing.[107] For this reason he constantly
denounced Johnsonese with its polysyllabic Latin words which reduced
language to abstract generalization. His own vocabulary is concrete and
vivid, and of a purity which makes one wonder how even the Quarterly
Review could have ventured to apply to him the epithet “slang-whanger.”
In spite of all that may be said in honor of the unadorned style of
composition, writers have ever found that even in prose ideas are most
forcibly conveyed by means of imagery. Hazlitt, it should be remembered,
was an ardent admirer of the picturesque qualities in the prose of Burke,
the most brilliant of the eighteenth century. In recalling his first
reading of Burke, he tells how he despaired of emulating his felicities.
But whether by dint of meditating over Burke or by the native vigor of his
fancy, Hazlitt learned to write as boldly and as brilliantly as the great
orator. As a rule his rhetorical passages are not deliberately contrived,
in the manner for example of [Pg lxvii]his esteemed contemporary De Quincey. His
tropes and images rise directly out of his subject or his feelings.
Instead of dissecting the qualities of a character or a work of art, he
translates its tone and its spirit as closely as language will permit.
That is why his criticism, like Lamb’s or that of the master of this form,
Longinus, is itself first-rate literature, recreating the impression of a
masterpiece and sometimes even going beyond it.
Of his picturesque quality examples enough may be found in the present
volume, yet one cannot forbear to add a few illustrations at this point.
There is his irresistible comparison of Cobbett in his political
inconsistency to “a young and lusty bridegroom, that divorces a favorite
speculation every morning, and marries a new one every night. He is not
wedded to his notions, not he. He has not one Mrs. Cobbett among all his
opinions.”[108] There is a good deal more than mere wit in the analogy
between Godwin’s mechanical laboriousness and “an eight-day clock that
must be wound up long before it can strike.”[109] And there is real
grandeur in his description of Fame: “Fame is the sound which the stream
of high thoughts, carried down to future ages, makes as it flows—deep,
distant, murmuring evermore like the waters of the mighty ocean. He who
has ears truly touched to this music, is in a manner deaf to the voice of
popularity.”[110] In representing the brilliant hues of Restoration
comedy, he allows an even freer play to his fancy:
“In turning over the pages of the best comedies, we are almost transported
to another world, and escape from this dull age to one that was all life,
and whim, and mirth, and humour. The curtain rises, and a gayer scene
presents [Pg lxviii]itself, as on the canvas of Watteau. We are admitted behind the
scenes like spectators at court, on a levee or birthday; but it is the
court, the gala-day of wit and pleasure, of gallantry and Charles II.!
What an air breathes from the name! what a rustling of silks and waving of
plumes! what a sparkling of diamond ear-rings and shoe-buckles! What
bright eyes, (Ah, those were Waller’s Sacharissa’s as she passed!) what
killing looks and graceful motions! How the faces of the whole ring are
dressed in smiles! how the repartee goes round! how wit and folly,
elegance and awkward imitation of it, set one another off! Happy,
thoughtless age, when kings and nobles led purely ornamental lives; when
the utmost stretch of a morning’s study went no farther than the choice of
a sword-knot, or the adjustment of a side-curl; when the soul spoke out in
all the pleasing eloquence of dress; and beaux and belles, enamoured of
themselves in one another’s follies, fluttered like gilded butterflies, in
giddy mazes, through the walks of St. James’s Park!”[111]
Sometimes, it is true, he allows his spirits to run away with his
judgment, although in such instances the manner is so obviously
exaggerated as to suggest deliberate mimicry. His account of the tawdry
sentimentality of Moore’s poetry sounds like pure travesty:
“His verse is like a shower of beauty; a dance of images; a stream of
music; or like the spray of the water-fall, tinged by the morning-beam
with rosy light. The characteristic distinction of our author’s style is
this continuous and incessant flow of voluptuous thoughts and shining
allusions. He ought to write with a crystal pen on silver paper. His
subject is set off by a dazzling veil of poetic diction, like a wreath of
flowers gemmed with innumerous [Pg lxix]dew-drops, that weep, tremble, and glitter
in liquid softness and pearly light, while the song of birds ravishes the
ear, and languid odours breathe around, and Aurora opens Heaven’s smiling
portals, Peris and nymphs peep through the golden glades, and an Angel’s
wing glances over the glossy scene.”[112]
One feature of Hazlitt’s style concerning which much has been said both in
praise and in blame is his inveterate use of quotations. His pages,
particularly when he is in a contemplative mood, are sown with snatches
from the great poets, and the effect generally is of the happiest. A line
of Shakespeare’s or of Wordsworth’s, blending with a vein of high feeling
or deep reflection, transfigures the entire passage as if by magic.
Sometimes the phrase is merely woven into the general texture of the prose
without in any way raising its tone, and on occasion some fine poetic
expression is vulgarized by being thrown into very common company. It is
vandalism to muster a sonnet of Shakespeare’s into such a service and it
in no way enhances the expressiveness of the passage to say, “A flashy
pamphlet has been run to a five-and-thirtieth edition, and thus ensured
the writer a ‘deathless date’ among political charlatans.”[113] The fact
is that quotations were a part of Hazlitt’s vocabulary, which he used with
the same freedom as common locutions and with less scrupulous regard for
the associations which were gathered about them. He negligently misquoted
or wantonly adapted to his purpose, but the reader is willing to pardon
the moments of irritation for the numerous delightful thrills which he has
provoked by some happy poetic memory “stealing and giving odor” to a
sentiment in itself dignified or elevated.
Hazlitt’s influence as a critic may be inferred from a [Pg lxx]summary of his
opinions. It was not so much through the infusion of a new spirit in
literature that he acted on other minds. Though his criticism owes much of
its value to the freshness and boldness of his approach, this
temperamental virtue was not something which could be imitated by a less
gifted writer. Sainte-Beuve indeed seems to recognize Hazlitt as the
exponent of the impetuous and inspired vein in criticism—“the kind of
inspiration which accompanies and follows those frequent articles
dashingly improvised and launched under full steam. One puts himself
completely into it: its value is exaggerated for the time being, its
importance is measured by its fury, and if this leads to better results,
there is no great harm after all.”[114] But though he professed these to
be his own feelings as a critic, they were in him so modified by the
traditional French moderation and suavity of tone, as well as by a greater
precision of method, as to make the resemblance to Hazlitt inconspicuous.
It is hard to determine to what extent Hazlitt’s individualism is
responsible for the lawless impressionism of some later critics,[115] but
it is not to be imputed to him as a sin if, in the course of a century,
one of his virtues has become exaggerated into a fault. He has but
suffered human destiny.
[Pg lxxi]Hazlitt’s influence has been wide in guiding the taste of readers and in
creating or giving currency to a body of opinions on literature which has
found acceptance among critics. If the tributes of Schlegel and Heine to
Hazlitt’s Shakespearian criticism were insufficient, we have the word of
his own countrymen for it that numberless readers were initiated into a
proper understanding of Shakespeare by means of his writings.[116] In our
own days Mr. Howells has told us that Hazlitt “helped him to clarify and
formulate his opinions of Shakespeare as no one else has yet done.”[117]
Critics no less than readers owe him a large debt. Hazlitt had not been
writing many years before his fellow-laborers in literature began to
recognize and pay homage to his superior insight. His opinions were quoted
as having the weight of authority by those who were friendly to him, the
writers in the London Magazine or in the Edinburgh Review; they were
appropriated without acknowledgement by the hostile contributors to
Blackwood’s. Many writers deferred to him as respectfully as he himself
deferred to Coleridge and Lamb, even though Byron’s respectable friends
adjured the noble poet not to dignify Hazlitt in open controversy except
by mentioning him as “a certain lecturer.” Leigh Hunt was frequently
indebted to him, but generally paid the tribute due. Macaulay sometimes
assimilated a passage of Hazlitt’s to the needs of his own earlier essays.
In the essay on Milton his balancing of Charles’s political vices against
his domestic virtues is strikingly reminiscent of a similar treatment of
Southey by the older critic. Personal dislike of Hazlitt, persisting after
his death, for a long time prevented a proper respect being paid to his
memory without much diminishing the weight of his influence. The attitude
[Pg lxxii]toward him is summed up by a writer whose treatment in general does not
err on the side of enthusiasm. Hazlitt, he tells us, is “a writer with
whose reputation fashion has hitherto had very little to do—who is even
now more read than praised, more imitated than extolled, and whose various
productions still interest many who care and know very little about the
author.”[118] But this very utterance was on the occasion of the turning
of the tide. It was in a review of Hazlitt’s Literary Remains which had
been introduced by appreciative essays from the pens of Bulwer-Lytton and
Thomas Noon Talfourd, the former not a little patronizing, but Talfourd’s
excellent in its discrimination of the strength and weakness of Hazlitt. A
few years later came the implied compliment of Horne’s New Spirit of the
Age, which would hardly be worth mentioning were it not that Thackeray in
reviewing it took occasion to pay an exquisite tribute to Hazlitt.[119]
From this time forth he was not wanting in stout champions, though most
people still maintained a cautious reserve in their judgments of him. So
sound and penetrating a critic as Walter Bagehot became an earnest
convert, and in Bagehot’s writings Mr. Birrell has pointed out more than
one resemblance to Hazlitt. James Russell Lowell has not been profuse in
his expressions of admiration, but he has probably followed Hazlitt’s
track more closely than any other important critic. Many of his essays
seem to have been composed with a volume of Hazlitt on the desk before
him. There is the essay on Pope with its general correspondence of points
and occasional startling parallel of phrase. Hazlitt at the end of his
lecture on Pope and Dryden remarks that poetry had “declined by successive
gradations from the poetry of imagination in the age of Elizabeth to the
poetry of [Pg lxxiii]fancy in the time of Charles I,” and Lowell repeats this with
some amplification. In the same connection he characterizes Shakespeare,
Chaucer, Spenser, and Milton in the sharp epigrammatic manner reminding
one of Hazlitt. In the concluding pages of the essay on Spenser we are
also kept in a reminiscent mood, till Lowell tells us that “to read him is
like dreaming awake,” and at once there flashes upon us Hazlitt’s
expression that “Spenser is the poet of our waking dreams.” It is through
missionary work like this, not altogether conscious and therefore all the
more genuine, that his opinions have been diffused through the length and
breadth of English and been incorporated into the common stock. “Gracious
rills from the Hazlitt watershed have flowed in all directions,
fertilizing a dry and thirsty land”—is the happily turned phrase of Mr.
Birrell. If in our own day there are still persons who, looking upon
criticism as a severe science, occasionally sneer at him as a “facile
eulogist,”[120] those who regard it rather as a gift have seen in him “the
greatest critic that England has yet produced.”[121] Wherever the golden
mean between these two extremes of opinion may lie, there is no doubt that
for introducing readers to an appreciation of the great things in English
literature, Hazlitt still remains without an equal.
 
 
[Pg 1]Notes
The age of Elizabeth was distinguished, beyond, perhaps, any other in our
history, by a number of great men, famous in different ways, and whose
names have come down to us with unblemished honours; statesmen, warriors,
divines, scholars, poets, and philosophers, Raleigh, Drake, Coke, Hooker,
and higher and more sounding still, and still more frequent in our mouths,
Shakspeare, Spenser, Sidney, Bacon, Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, men
whom fame has eternised in her long and lasting scroll, and who, by their
words and acts, were benefactors of their country, and ornaments of human
nature. Their attainments of different kinds bore the same general stamp,
and it was sterling: what they did, had the mark of their age and country
upon it. Perhaps the genius of Great Britain (if I may so speak without
offence or flattery), never shone out fuller or brighter, or looked more
like itself, than at this period. Our writers and great men had something
in them that savoured of the soil from which they grew: they were not
French, they were not Dutch, or German, or Greek, or Latin; they were
truly English. They did not look out of themselves to see what they should
be; they sought for truth and nature, and found it in themselves. There
was no tinsel, and but little art; they were not the spoiled children of
affectation and refinement, but a bold, vigorous, independent race of
thinkers, with prodigious strength and energy, with none but natural
grace, and heartfelt[Pg 2]Notes
unobtrusive delicacy. They were not at all
sophisticated. The mind of their country was great in them, and it
prevailed. With their learning and unexampled acquirement, they did not
forget that they were men: with all their endeavours after excellence,
they did not lay aside the strong original bent and character of their
minds. What they performed was chiefly nature’s handy-work; and time has
claimed it for his own.—To these, however, might be added others not less
learned, nor with a scarce less happy vein, but less fortunate in the
event, who, though as renowned in their day, have sunk into “mere
oblivion,” and of whom the only record (but that the noblest) is to be
found in their works. Their works and their names, “poor, poor dumb
names,” are all that remains of such men as Webster, Deckar, Marston,
Marlow, Chapman, Heywood, Middleton, and Rowley! “How lov’d, how honour’d
once, avails them not:” though they were the friends and fellow-labourers
of Shakspeare, sharing his fame and fortunes with him, the rivals of
Jonson, and the masters of Beaumont and Fletcher’s well-sung woes! They
went out one by one unnoticed, like evening lights; or were swallowed up
in the headlong torrent of puritanic zeal which succeeded, and swept away
everything in its unsparing course, throwing up the wrecks of taste and
genius at random, and at long fitful intervals, amidst the painted
gew-gaws and foreign frippery of the reign of Charles II. and from which
we are only now recovering the scattered fragments and broken images to
erect a temple to true Fame! How long, before it will be completed?
If I can do anything to rescue some of these writers from hopeless
obscurity, and to do them right, without prejudice to well-deserved
reputation, I shall have succeeded in what I chiefly propose. I shall not
attempt, indeed, to adjust the spelling, or restore the pointing, as if
the[Pg 3]Notes
genius of poetry lay hid in errors of the press, but leaving these
weightier matters of criticism to those who are more able and willing to
bear the burden, try to bring out their real beauties to the eager sight,
“draw the curtain of Time, and shew the picture of Genius,” restraining my
own admiration within reasonable bounds!...
We affect to wonder at Shakspeare, and one or two more of that period, as
solitary instances upon record; whereas it is our own dearth of
information that makes the waste; for there is no time more populous of
intellect, or more prolific of intellectual wealth, than the one we are
speaking of. Shakspeare did not look upon himself in this light, as a sort
of monster of poetical genius, or on his contemporaries as “less than
smallest dwarfs,” when he speaks with true, not false modesty, of himself
and them, and of his wayward thoughts, “desiring this man’s art, and that
man’s scope.” We fancy that there were no such men, that could either add
to or take anything away from him, but such there were. He indeed
overlooks and commands the admiration of posterity, but he does it from
the tableland of the age in which he lived. He towered above his
fellows, “in shape and gesture proudly eminent;” but he was one of a race
of giants, the tallest, the strongest, the most graceful, and beautiful of
them; but it was a common and a noble brood. He was not something sacred
and aloof from the vulgar herd of men, but shook hands with nature and the
circumstances of the time, and is distinguished from his immediate
contemporaries, not in kind, but in degree and greater variety of
excellence. He did not form a class or species by himself, but belonged to
a class or species. His age was necessary to him; nor could he have been
wrenched from his place in the edifice of which he was so conspicuous a
part, without equal injury to himself and it. Mr. Wordsworth says of
Milton, that “his soul[Pg 4]Notes
was like a star, and dwelt apart.” This cannot be
said with any propriety of Shakspeare, who certainly moved in a
constellation of bright luminaries, and “drew after him a third part of
the heavens.” If we allow, for argument’s sake (or for truth’s, which is
better), that he was in himself equal to all his competitors put together;
yet there was more dramatic excellence in that age than in the whole of
the period that has elapsed since. If his contemporaries, with their
united strength, would hardly make one Shakspeare, certain it is that all
his successors would not make half a one. With the exception of a single
writer, Otway, and of a single play of his (Venice Preserved), there is
nobody in tragedy and dramatic poetry (I do not here speak of comedy) to
be compared to the great men of the age of Shakspeare, and immediately
after. They are a mighty phalanx of kindred spirits closing him round,
moving in the same orbit, and impelled by the same causes in their
whirling and eccentric career. They had the same faults and the same
excellences; the same strength and depth and richness, the same truth of
character, passion, imagination, thought and language, thrown, heaped,
massed together without careful polishing or exact method, but poured out
in unconcerned profusion from the lap of nature and genius in boundless
and unrivalled magnificence. The sweetness of Deckar, the thought of
Marston, the gravity of Chapman, the grace of Fletcher and his young-eyed
wit, Jonson’s learned sock, the flowing vein of Middleton, Heywood’s ease,
the pathos of Webster, and Marlow’s deep designs, add a double lustre to
the sweetness, thought, gravity, grace, wit, artless nature, copiousness,
ease, pathos, and sublime conceptions of Shakspeare’s Muse. They are
indeed the scale by which we can best ascend to the true knowledge and
love of him. Our admiration of them does not lessen our relish for him;
but, on the contrary, increases[Pg 5] and confirms it.—For such an
extraordinary combination and development of fancy and genius many causes
may be assigned; and we may seek for the chief of them in religion, in
politics, in the circumstances of the time, the recent diffusion of
letters, in local situation, and in the character of the men who adorned
that period, and availed themselves so nobly of the advantages placed
within their reach.
I shall here attempt to give a general sketch of these causes, and of the
manner in which they operated to mould and stamp the poetry of the country
at the period of which I have to treat; independently of incidental and
fortuitous causes, for which there is no accounting, but which, after all,
have often the greatest share in determining the most important results.
The first cause I shall mention, as contributing to this general effect,
was the Reformation, which had just then taken place. This event gave a
mighty impulse and increased activity to thought and inquiry, and agitated
the inert mass of accumulated prejudices throughout Europe. The effect of
the concussion was general; but the shock was greatest in this country. It
toppled down the full-grown, intolerable abuses of centuries at a blow;
heaved the ground from under the feet of bigotted faith and slavish
obedience; and the roar and dashing of opinions, loosened from their
accustomed hold, might be heard like the noise of an angry sea, and has
never yet subsided. Germany first broke the spell of misbegotten fear, and
gave the watch-word; but England joined the shout, and echoed it back with
her island voice, from her thousand cliffs and craggy shores, in a longer
and a louder strain. With that cry, the genius of Great Britain rose, and
threw down the gauntlet to the nations. There was a mighty fermentation:
the waters were out; public opinion was in a state of projection.[Pg 6]Notes Liberty
was held out to all to think and speak the truth. Men’s brains were busy;
their spirits stirring; their hearts full; and their hands not idle. Their
eyes were opened to expect the greatest things, and their ears burned with
curiosity and zeal to know the truth, that the truth might make them free.
The death-blow which had been struck at scarlet vice and bloated
hypocrisy, loosened their tongues, and made the talismans and love-tokens
of Popish superstition, with which she had beguiled her followers and
committed abominations with the people, fall harmless from their necks.
The translation of the Bible was the chief engine in the great work. It
threw open, by a secret spring, the rich treasures of religion and
morality, which had been there locked up as in a shrine. It revealed the
visions of the prophets, and conveyed the lessons of inspired teachers
(such they were thought) to the meanest of the people. It gave them a
common interest in the common cause. Their hearts burnt within them as
they read. It gave a mind to the people, by giving them common subjects of
thought and feeling. It cemented their union of character and sentiment:
it created endless diversity and collision of opinion. They found objects
to employ their faculties, and a motive in the magnitude of the
consequences attached to them, to exert the utmost eagerness in the
pursuit of truth, and the most daring intrepidity in maintaining it.
Religious controversy sharpens the understanding by the subtlety and
remoteness of the topics it discusses, and braces the will by their
infinite importance. We perceive in the history of this period a nervous
masculine intellect. No levity, no feebleness, no indifference; or if
there were, it is a relaxation from the intense activity which gives a
tone to its general character. But there is a gravity approaching to
piety; a seriousness of impression, a conscientious[Pg 7] severity of argument,
an habitual fervour and enthusiasm in their mode of handling almost every
subject. The debates of the schoolmen were sharp and subtle enough; but
they wanted interest and grandeur, and were besides confined to a few:
they did not affect the general mass of the community. But the Bible was
thrown open to all ranks and conditions “to run and read,” with its
wonderful table of contents from Genesis to the Revelations. Every village
in England would present the scene so well described in Burns’s Cotter’s
Saturday Night. I cannot think that all this variety and weight of
knowledge could be thrown in all at once upon the mind of a people, and
not make some impression upon it, the traces of which might be discerned
in the manners and literature of the age. For to leave more disputable
points, and take only the historical parts of the Old Testament, or the
moral sentiments of the New, there is nothing like them in the power of
exciting awe and admiration, or of rivetting sympathy. We see what Milton
has made of the account of the Creation, from the manner in which he has
treated it, imbued and impregnated with the spirit of the time of which we
speak. Or what is there equal (in that romantic interest and patriarchal
simplicity which goes to the heart of a country, and rouses it, as it
were, from its lair in wastes and wildernesses) equal to the story of
Joseph and his Brethren, of Rachael and Laban, of Jacob’s Dream, of Ruth
and Boaz, the descriptions in the Book of Job, the deliverance of the Jews
out of Egypt, or the account of their captivity and return from Babylon?
There is in all these parts of the Scripture, and numberless more of the
same kind, to pass over the Orphic hymns of David, the prophetic
denunciations of Isaiah, or the gorgeous visions of Ezekiel, an
originality, a vastness of conception, a depth and tenderness of feeling,
and a touching simplicity in the mode of narration, which he who does[Pg 8]Notes not
feel, need be made of no “penetrable stuff.” There is something in the
character of Christ too (leaving religious faith quite out of the
question) of more sweetness and majesty, and more likely to work a change
in the mind of man, by the contemplation of its idea alone, than any to be
found in history, whether actual or feigned. This character is that of a
sublime humanity, such as was never seen on earth before, nor since. This
shone manifestly both in his words and actions. We see it in his washing
the Disciples’ feet the night before his death, that unspeakable instance
of humility and love, above all art, all meanness, and all pride, and in
the leave he took of them on that occasion, “My peace I give unto you,
that peace which the world cannot give, give I unto you;” and in his last
commandment, that “they should love one another.” Who can read the account
of his behaviour on the cross, when turning to his mother he said, “Woman,
behold thy son,” and to the Disciple John, “Behold thy mother,” and “from
that hour that Disciple took her to his own home.” without having his
heart smote within him! We see it in his treatment of the woman taken in
adultery, and in his excuse for the woman who poured precious ointment on
his garment as an offering of devotion and love, which is here all in all.
His religion was the religion of the heart. We see it in his discourse
with the Disciples as they walked together towards Emmaus, when their
hearts burned within them; in his sermon from the Mount, in his parable of
the good Samaritan, and in that of the Prodigal Son—in every act and word
of his life, a grace, a mildness, a dignity and love, a patience and
wisdom worthy of the Son of God. His whole life and being were imbued,
steeped in this word, charity; it was the spring, the well-head from
which every thought and feeling gushed into act; and it was this that
breathed a mild glory from his face in that[Pg 9]Notes last agony upon the cross,
“when the meek Saviour bowed his head and died,” praying for his enemies.
He was the first true teacher of morality; for he alone conceived the idea
of a pure humanity. He redeemed man from the worship of that idol, self,
and instructed him by precept and example to love his neighbour as
himself, to forgive our enemies, to do good to those that curse us and
despitefully use us. He taught the love of good for the sake of good,
without regard to personal or sinister views, and made the affections of
the heart the sole seat of morality, instead of the pride of the
understanding or the sternness of the will. In answering the question,
“who is our neighbour?” as one who stands in need of our assistance, and
whose wounds we can bind up, he has done more to humanize the thoughts and
tame the unruly passions, than all who have tried to reform and benefit
mankind. The very idea of abstract benevolence, of the desire to do good
because another wants our services, and of regarding the human race as one
family, the offspring of one common parent, is hardly to be found in any
other code or system. It was “to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the
Greeks foolishness.” The Greeks and Romans never thought of considering
others, but as they were Greeks or Romans, as they were bound to them by
certain positive ties, or, on the other hand, as separated from them by
fiercer antipathies. Their virtues were the virtues of political machines,
their vices were the vices of demons, ready to inflict or to endure pain
with obdurate and remorseless inflexibility of purpose. But in the
Christian religion, “we perceive a softness coming over the heart of a
nation, and the iron scales that fence and harden it, melt and drop off.”
It becomes malleable, capable of pity, of forgiveness, of relaxing in its
claims, and remitting its power. We strike it, and it does not hurt us: it
is not steel or marble, but flesh and blood,[Pg 10]Notes clay tempered with tears,
and “soft as sinews of the newborn babe.” The gospel was first preached to
the poor, for it consulted their wants and interests, not its own pride
and arrogance. It first promulgated the equality of mankind in the
community of duties and benefits. It denounced the iniquities of the chief
Priests and Pharisees, and declared itself at variance with principalities
and powers, for it sympathizes not with the oppressor, but the oppressed.
It first abolished slavery, for it did not consider the power of the will
to inflict injury, as clothing it with a right to do so. Its law is good,
not power. It at the same time tended to wean the mind from the grossness
of sense, and a particle of its divine flame was lent to brighten and
purify the lamp of love!
There have been persons who, being sceptics as to the divine mission of
Christ, have taken an unaccountable prejudice to his doctrines, and have
been disposed to deny the merit of his character; but this was not the
feeling of the great men in the age of Elizabeth (whatever might be their
belief) one of whom says of him, with a boldness equal to its piety:
“The best of men
That e’er wore earth about him was a sufferer;
A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit;
The first true gentleman that ever breathed.”
 
This was old honest Deckar, and the lines ought to embalm his memory to
every one who has a sense either of religion, or philosophy, or humanity,
or true genius. Nor can I help thinking, that we may discern the traces of
the influence exerted by religious faith in the spirit of the poetry of
the age of Elizabeth, in the means of exciting terror and pity, in the
delineation of the passions of grief, remorse, love, sympathy, the sense
of shame, in the fond[Pg 11]Notes
desires, the longings after immortality, in the
heaven of hope, and the abyss of despair it lays open to us.[122]
The literature of this age then, I would say, was strongly influenced
(among other causes), first by the spirit of Christianity, and secondly by
the spirit of Protestantism.
The effects of the Reformation on politics and philosophy may be seen in
the writings and history of the next and of the following ages. They are
still at work, and will continue to be so. The effects on the poetry of
the time were chiefly confined to the moulding of the character, and
giving a powerful impulse to the intellect of the country. The immediate
use or application that was made of religion to subjects of imagination
and fiction was not (from an obvious ground of separation) so direct or
frequent, as that which was made of the classical and romantic literature.
For much about the same time, the rich and fascinating stores of the Greek
and Roman mythology, and those of the romantic poetry of Spain and Italy,
were eagerly explored by the curious, and thrown open in translations to
the admiring gaze of the vulgar. This last circumstance could hardly have
afforded so much advantage to the poets of that day, who were themselves,
in fact, the translators, as it shews the general curiosity and increasing
interest in such subjects, as a prevailing feature of the times. There
were translations of Tasso by Fairfax, and of Ariosto by Harrington, of
Homer and Hesiod by Chapman, and of Virgil long before, and Ovid soon
after; there was Sir Thomas North’s translation of Plutarch, of which
Shakspeare has made such admirable use in his Coriolanus and Julius Cæsar;
and Ben Jonson’s tragedies of Catiline and Sejanus may themselves be
considered as almost literal[Pg 12]Notes translations into verse, of Tacitus,
Sallust, and Cicero’s Orations in his consulship. Boccacio, the divine
Boccacio, Petrarch, Dante, the satirist Aretine, Machiavel, Castiglione,
and others, were familiar to our writers, and they make occasional mention
of some few French authors, as Ronsard and Du Bartas; for the French
literature had not at this stage arrived at its Augustan period, and it
was the imitation of their literature a century afterwards, when it had
arrived at its greatest height (itself copied from the Greek and Latin),
that enfeebled and impoverished our own. But of the time that we are
considering, it might be said, without much extravagance, that every
breath that blew, that every wave that rolled to our shores, brought with
it some accession to our knowledge, which was engrafted on the national
genius. In fact, all the disposeable materials that had been accumulating
for a long period of time, either in our own, or in foreign countries,
were now brought together, and required nothing more than to be wrought
up, polished, or arranged in striking forms, for ornament and use. To this
every inducement prompted, the novelty of the acquisition of knowledge in
many cases, the emulation of foreign wits, and of immortal works, the want
and the expectation of such works among ourselves, the opportunity and
encouragement afforded for their production by leisure and affluence; and,
above all, the insatiable desire of the mind to beget its own image, and
to construct out of itself, and for the delight and admiration of the
world and posterity, that excellence of which the idea exists hitherto
only in its own breast, and the impression of which it would make as
universal as the eye of heaven, the benefit as common as the air we
breathe. The first impulse of genius is to create what never existed
before: the contemplation of that, which is so created, is sufficient to
satisfy the demands of taste; and it is the habitual study and imitation[Pg 13]Notes
of the original models that takes away the power, and even wish to do the
like. Taste limps after genius, and from copying the artificial models, we
lose sight of the living principle of nature. It is the effort we make,
and the impulse we acquire, in overcoming the first obstacles, that
projects us forward; it is the necessity for exertion that makes us
conscious of our strength; but this necessity and this impulse once
removed, the tide of fancy and enthusiasm, which is at first a running
stream, soon settles and crusts into the standing pool of dulness,
criticism, and virtù.
What also gave an unusual impetus to the mind of man at this period, was
the discovery of the New World, and the reading of voyages and travels.
Green islands and golden sands seemed to arise, as by enchantment, out of
the bosom of the watery waste, and invite the cupidity, or wing the
imagination of the dreaming speculator. Fairy land was realized in new and
unknown worlds. “Fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales, thrice
happy isles,” were found floating “like those Hesperian gardens famed of
old,” beyond Atlantic seas, as dropt from the zenith. The people, the
soil, the clime, every thing gave unlimited scope to the curiosity of the
traveller and reader. Other manners might be said to enlarge the bounds of
knowledge, and new mines of wealth were tumbled at our feet. It is from a
voyage to the Straits of Magellan that Shakspeare has taken the hint of
Prospero’s Enchanted Island, and of the savage Caliban with his god
Setebos.[123] Spenser seems to have had the same feeling in his mind in
the production of his Faery Queen, and vindicates his poetic fiction on
this very ground of analogy.
“Right well I wote, most mighty sovereign,
[Pg 14]NotesThat all this famous antique history
Of some the abundance of an idle brain
Will judged be, and painted forgery,
Rather than matter of just memory:
Since none that breatheth living air, doth know
Where is that happy land of faery
Which I so much do vaunt, but no where show,
But vouch antiquities, which nobody can know.

But let that man with better sense avise,
That of the world least part to us is read:
And daily how through hardy enterprize
Many great regions are discovered,
Which to late age were never mentioned.
Who ever heard of th’ Indian Peru?
Or who in venturous vessel measured
The Amazons’ huge river, now found true?
Or fruitfullest Virginia who did ever view?

Yet all these were when no man did them know,
Yet have from wisest ages hidden been:
And later times things more unknown shall show.
Why then should witless man so much misween
That nothing is but that which he hath seen?
What if within the moon’s fair shining sphere,
What if in every other star unseen,
Of other worlds he happily should hear,
He wonder would much more; yet such to some appear.”
 
Fancy’s air-drawn pictures after history’s waking dream shewed like clouds
over mountains; and from the romance of real life to the idlest fiction,
the transition seemed easy.—Shakspeare, as well as others of his time,
availed himself of the old Chronicles, and of the traditions or fabulous
inventions contained in them in such ample measure, and which had not yet
been appropriated to the purposes of poetry or the drama. The stage was a
new thing; and those who had to supply its demands laid their hands upon
whatever came within their reach: they were not particular as to the
means, so that they gained the end. Lear is founded upon an old ballad;
Othello on an Italian novel; Hamlet on a Danish, and Macbeth on a Scotch
tradition:[Pg 15]Notes one of which is to be found in Saxo-Grammaticus, and the last
in Hollingshed. The Ghost-scenes and the Witches in each, are
authenticated in the old Gothic history. There was also this connecting
link between the poetry of this age and the supernatural traditions of a
former one, that the belief in them was still extant, and in full force
and visible operation among the vulgar (to say no more) in the time of our
authors. The appalling and wild chimeras of superstition and ignorance,
“those bodiless creations that ecstacy is very cunning in,” were inwoven
with existing manners and opinions, and all their effects on the passions
of terror or pity might be gathered from common and actual
observation—might be discerned in the workings of the face, the
expressions of the tongue, the writhings of a troubled conscience. “Your
face, my Thane; is as a book where men may read strange matters.” Midnight
and secret murders too, from the imperfect state of the police, were more
common; and the ferocious and brutal manners that would stamp the brow of
the hardened ruffian or hired assassin, more incorrigible and undisguised.
The portraits of Tyrrel and Forrest were, no doubt, done from the life. We
find that the ravages of the plague, the destructive rage of fire, the
poisoned chalice, lean famine, the serpent’s mortal sting, and the fury of
wild beasts, were the common topics of their poetry, as they were common
occurrences in more remote periods of history. They were the strong
ingredients thrown into the cauldron of tragedy, to make it “thick and
slab.” Man’s life was (as it appears to me) more full of traps and
pit-falls; of hair-breadth accidents by flood and field; more way-laid by
sudden and startling evils; it trod on the brink of hope and fear;
stumbled upon fate unawares; while the imagination, close behind it,
caught at and clung to the shape of danger, or “snatched a wild and
fearful joy” from its escape. The accidents of nature were[Pg 16]Notes less provided
against; the excesses of the passions and of lawless power were less
regulated, and produced more strange and desperate catastrophes. The tales
of Boccacio are founded on the great pestilence of Florence, Fletcher the
poet died of the plague, and Marlow was stabbed in a tavern quarrel. The
strict authority of parents, the inequality of ranks, or the hereditary
feuds between different families, made more unhappy loves or matches.
“The course of true love never did run even.”
 
Again, the heroic and martial spirit which breathes in our elder writers,
was yet in considerable activity in the reign of Elizabeth. “The age of
chivalry was not then quite gone, nor the glory of Europe extinguished for
ever.” Jousts and tournaments were still common with the nobility in
England and in foreign countries: Sir Philip Sidney was particularly
distinguished for his proficiency in these exercises (and indeed fell a
martyr to his ambition as a soldier)—and the gentle Surrey was still more
famous, on the same account, just before him. It is true, the general use
of fire-arms gradually superseded the necessity of skill in the sword, or
bravery in the person: and as a symptom of the rapid degeneracy in this
respect, we find Sir John Suckling soon after boasting of himself as one—
“Who prized black eyes, and a lucky hit
At bowls, above all the trophies of wit.”
It was comparatively an age of peace,
“Like strength reposing on his own right arm;”
but the sound of civil combat might still be heard in the distance, the
spear glittered to the eye of memory, or the clashing of armour struck on
the imagination of the ardent and the young. They were borderers on the
savage state, on the[Pg 17]Notes times of war and bigotry, though in the lap of arts,
of luxury, and knowledge. They stood on the shore and saw the billows
rolling after the storm: “they heard the tumult, and were still.” The
manners and out-of-door amusements were more tinctured with a spirit of
adventure and romance. The war with wild beasts, &c. was more strenuously
kept up in country sports. I do not think we could get from sedentary
poets, who had never mingled in the vicissitudes, the dangers, or
excitements of the chase, such descriptions of hunting and other athletic
games, as are to be found in Shakspeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream or
Fletcher’s Noble Kinsmen.
With respect to the good cheer and hospitable living of those times, I
cannot agree with an ingenious and agreeable writer of the present day,
that it was general or frequent. The very stress laid upon certain
holidays and festivals, shews that they did not keep up the same
Saturnalian licence and open house all the year round. They reserved
themselves for great occasions, and made the best amends they could, for a
year of abstinence and toil by a week of merriment and convivial
indulgence. Persons in middle life at this day, who can afford a good
dinner every day, do not look forward to it as any particular subject of
exultation: the poor peasant, who can only contrive to treat himself to a
joint of meat on a Sunday, considers it as an event in the week. So, in
the old Cambridge comedy of the Return from Parnassus, we find this
indignant description of the progress of luxury in those days, put into
the mouth of one of the speakers.

“Why is’t not strange to see a ragged clerke,
Some stammell weaver, or some butcher’s sonne,
That scrubb’d a late within a sleeveless gowne,
When the commencement, like a morrice dance,
Hath put a bell or two about his legges,
[Pg 18]NotesCreated him a sweet cleane gentleman:
How then he ’gins to follow fashions.
He whose thin sire dwelt in a smokye roofe,
Must make tobacco, and must wear a locke.
His thirsty dad drinkes in a wooden bowle,
But his sweet self is served in si’ver plate.
His hungry sire will scrape you twenty legges
For one good Christmas meal on new year’s day,
But his mawe must be capon cramm’d each day.”
Act III. Scene 2.
 
This does not look as if in those days “it snowed of meat and drink,” as a
matter of course throughout the year!—The distinctions of dress, the
badges of different professions, the very signs of the shops, which we
have set aside for written inscriptions over the doors, were, as Mr. Lamb
observes, a sort of visible language to the imagination, and hints for
thought. Like the costume of different foreign nations, they had an
immediate striking and picturesque effect, giving scope to the fancy. The
surface of society was embossed with hieroglyphics, and poetry existed “in
art and compliment extern.” The poetry of former times might be directly
taken from real life, as our poetry is taken from the poetry of former
times. Finally, the face of nature, which was the same glorious object
then that it is now, was open to them; and coming first, they gathered her
fairest flowers to live for ever in their verse:—the movements of the
human heart were not hid from them, for they had the same passions as we,
only less disguised, and less subject to control. Deckar has given an
admirable description of a mad-house in one of his plays. But it might be
perhaps objected, that it was only a literal account taken from Bedlam at
that time; and it might be answered, that the old poets took the same
method of describing the passions and fancies of men whom they met at
large, which forms the point of communion between us: for the title of the
old play, “A Mad World, my Masters,” is hardly yet[Pg 19]Notes obsolete; and we are
pretty much the same Bedlam still, perhaps a little better managed, like
the real one, and with more care and humanity shewn to the patients!
Lastly, to conclude this account; what gave a unity and common direction
to all these causes, was the natural genius of the country, which was
strong in these writers in proportion to their strength. We are a nation
of islanders, and we cannot help it; nor mend ourselves if we would. We
are something in ourselves, nothing when we try to ape others. Music and
painting are not our forte: for what we have done in that way has been
little, and that borrowed from others with great difficulty. But we may
boast of our poets and philosophers. That’s something. We have had strong
heads and sound hearts among us. Thrown on one side of the world, and left
to bustle for ourselves, we have fought out many a battle for truth and
freedom. That is our natural style; and it were to be wished we had in no
instance departed from it. Our situation has given us a certain cast of
thought and character; and our liberty has enabled us to make the most of
