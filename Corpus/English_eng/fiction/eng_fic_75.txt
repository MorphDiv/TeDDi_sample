Etiquette as observed in European courts is not known at the
White House.
The President's Secretary issues invitations by direction of the
President to the distinguished guests.
The Usher in charge of the cloak-room hands to the gentleman on
arrival an envelope containing a diagram of the table (as cut
shows), whereon the name and seat of the respective guest and the
lady he is to escort to dinner are marked.
A card corresponding with his name is placed on the napkin
belonging to the cover of the seat he will occupy.
The President's seat is in the middle of the table. The most
distinguished guests sit on his right and left. If their wives are
present they will occupy these seats, and the gentlemen will be
seated next to the President's wife whose seat is directly opposite
the President.
Official dinners all over the world are always served after the
French fashion, and are divided into three distinct parts. Two of
them are served from the kitchen, and the third from the
pantry.
The first part of the dinner served French style includes from
oysters on the shell to the sherbets.
The second service continues to the sweet dishes.
The third includes ice, cakes, fruits, cheeses, which are all
understood as desserts, and are dressed in the pantry.
All principal dishes which are artistically decorated are shown
to the President first, then are carried around the table before
being carved by the Steward in the pantry.
Fancy folding of the napkins is considered out of fashion; plain
square folded, so as to show monogram in the middle, is much
preferred.
The following diagram will illustrate the arrangement of the
glasses on the table. (See diagram.)
Flower decorations on the table are to be in flat designs, so as
not to obscure the view of the guests.
Corsage boquets for ladies consist of not more than eight large
roses tied together by silk ribbon, with the name of the lady
stamped on in gold letters.
Gentlemen's bouttonieres consist only of one rosebud.
Boquets for ladies are to be placed on the right side; for
gentlemen, on the napkin next to card bearing his name.
Printed menus are never used on any official occasion.
The private dinners menus are either printed or written on a
plain card and placed on each cover.
Liquors, cordials, cigars are served on a separate table after
the ladies have retired to the parlor.
Dishes for invalids should be served in the daintiest and most
attractive way; never send more than a supply for one meal; the
same dish too frequently set before an invalid often causes a
distaste, when perhaps a change would tempt the appetite.
When preparing dishes where milk is used, the condition of the
patient should be considered. Long cooking hardens the albumen and
makes the milk very constipating; then, if the patient should be
already constipated, care should be taken not to heat the milk
above the boiling point.
The seasoning of food for the sick should be varied according to
the condition of the patient; one recovering from illness can
partake of a little piece of roast mutton, chicken, rabbit, game,
fish, simply dressed, and simple puddings are all light food and
easily digested. A mutton chop, nicely cut, trimmed and broiled, is
a dish that is often inviting to an invalid. As a rule, an invalid
will be more likely to enjoy any preparation sent to him if it is
served in small delicate pieces. As there are so many small, dainty
dishes that can be made for this purpose, it seems useless to try
to give more than a small variety of them. Pudding can be made of
prepared barley, or tapioca, well soaked before boiling, with an
egg added, and a change can be made of light puddings by mixing up
some stewed fruit with the puddings before baking; a bread pudding
from stale bread crumbs, and a tiny cup-custard, boiled in a small
basin or cup; also various drinks, such as milk punch, wine, whey,
apple-toddy, and various other nourishing drinks.
BEEFSTEAK AND MUTTON CHOPS.
Select the tenderest cuts and broil over a clear, hot fire. Let
the steak be rare, the chops well done. Salt and pepper, lay
between two [Pg 511]hot plates three minutes and serve to your
patient. If he is very weak do not let him swallow anything except
the juice, when he has chewed the meat well. The essence of rare
beef, roasted or broiled, thus expressed, is considered by some
physicians to be more strengthening than beef tea prepared in the
usual manner.
BEEF TEA.
One pound of lean beef, cut into small pieces. Put into a
glass canning jar, without a drop of water, cover tightly and set
in a pot of cold water. Heat gradually to a boil and continue this
steadily for three or four hours, until the meat is like white rags
and the juice all drawn out. Season with salt to taste and, when
cold, skim.
VEAL OR MUTTON BROTH.
Take a scrag-end of mutton (two pounds), put it in a saucepan
with two quarts of cold water and an ounce of pearl barley or rice.
When it is coming to a boil, skim it well, then add half a
teaspoonful of salt; let it boil until half reduced, then strain it
and take off all the fat and it is ready for use. This is excellent
for an invalid. If vegetables are liked in this broth, take one
turnip, one carrot and one onion, cut them in shreds and boil them
in the broth half an hour. In that case, the barley may be served
with the vegetables in broth.
CHICKEN BROTH.
Make the same as mutton or beef broth. Boil the chicken slowly,
putting on just enough water to cover it well, watching it closely
that it does not boil down too much. When the chicken is tender,
season with salt and a very little pepper. The yolk of an egg
beaten light and added, is very nourishing.
OATMEAL GRUEL.
Put four tablespoonfuls of the best grits (oatmeal coarsely
ground) into a pint of boiling water. Let it boil gently, and stir
it often, till it becomes as thick as you wish it. Then strain it,
and add to it while warm, butter, wine, nutmeg, or whatever is
thought proper to flavor it. Salt to taste.
If you make a gruel of fine oatmeal, sift it, mix it first to a
thick batter with a little cold water, and then put it into the
saucepan of [Pg 512]boiling water. Stir it all the time it is
boiling, lifting the spoon gently up and down, and letting the
gruel fall slowly back again into the pan.
CORN MEAL GRUEL.
Two tablespoonfuls of fine Indian meal, mixed smooth with cold
water, and a saltspoonful of salt; add one quart of boiling water
and cook twenty minutes. Stir it frequently, and if it becomes too
thick use boiling water to thin it. If the stomach is not too weak,
a tablespoonful of cream may be used to cool it. Some like it
sweetened and others like it plain. For very sick persons, let it
settle, pour off the top, and give without other seasoning. For
convalescents, toast a piece of bread as nicely as possible, and
put it in the gruel with a tablespoonful of nice sweet cream and a
little ginger and sugar. This should be used only when a laxative
is allowed.
EGG GRUEL.
Beat the yolk of an egg with one tablespoonful of sugar; pour
one teacupful of boiling water on it, add the white of an egg,
beaten to a froth, with any seasoning or spice desired. Take
warm.
MILK PORRIDGE.
The same as arrowroot, excepting it should be all milk, and
thickened with a scant tablespoonful of sifted flour; let it boil
five minutes, stirring it constantly, add a little cold milk, give
it one boil up, and it is ready for use.
ARROWROOT MILK PORRIDGE.
One large cupful of fresh milk, new if you can get it, one
cupful of boiling water, one teaspoonful of arrowroot, wet to a
paste with sold water, two teaspoonfuls of white sugar, a pinch of
salt. Put the sugar into the milk, the salt into the boiling water,
which should be poured into a farina kettle. Add the wet arrowroot
and boil, stirring constantly until it is clear; put in the milk
and cook ten minutes, stirring often. Give while warm, adding hot
milk should it be thicker than gruel.
ARROWROOT BLANC MANGE.
One large cupful of boiling milk, one even tablespoonful of
arrowroot rubbed to a paste with cold water, two teaspoonfuls of
white [Pg 513]sugar, a pinch of salt, flavor with rose-water.
Proceed as in the foregoing recipes, boiling and stirring eight
minutes. Turn into a wet mold, and, when firm, serve with cream and
powdered sugar.
TAPIOCA JELLY.
Soak a cupful of tapioca in a quart of cold water after washing
it thoroughly two or three times; after soaking three or four
hours, simmer it in a stewpan until it becomes quite clear,
stirring often; add the juice of a lemon, and a little of the
grated peel, also a pinch of salt. Sweeten to taste. Wine can be
substituted for lemon, if liked.
SLIPPERY-ELM BARK TEA.
Break the bark into bits, pour boiling water over it, cover and
let it infuse until cold. Sweeten, ice, and take for summer
disorders, or add lemon juice and drink for a bad cold.
FLAX-SEED TEA.
Upon an ounce of unbruised flax-seed and a little pulverized
liquorice-root pour a pint of boiling (soft or rain) water, and
place the vessel containing these ingredients near, but not on, the
fire for four hours. Strain through a linen cloth. Make it fresh
every day. An excellent drink in fever accompanied by a cough.
FLAX-SEED LEMONADE.
To a large tablespoonful of flax-seed, allow a tumbler and a
half of cold water. Boil them together till the liquid becomes very
sticky. Then strain it hot over a quarter of a pound of pulverized
sugar, and an ounce of pulverized gum arabic. Stir it till quite
dissolved, and squeeze into it the juice of a lemon.
This mixture has frequently been found an efficacious remedy for
a cold, taking a wine-glass of it as often as the cough is
troublesome.
TAMARIND WATER.
Put tamarinds into a pitcher or tumbler till it is one-third
full, then fill up with cold water, cover it, and let it infuse for
a quarter of an hour or more.
Currant jelly or cranberry juice mixed with water makes a
pleasant drink for an invalid.
SAGO JELLY.
Made the same as tapioca. If seasoning is not advisable the sago
may be boiled in milk, instead of water, and eaten plain.
Rice jelly made the same, using only half as much rice as
sago.
ARROWROOT WINE JELLY.
One cupful of boiling water, one scant tablespoonful of
arrowroot, mixed with a little cold water, one tablespoonful of
sugar, a pinch of salt, one tablespoonful of brandy, or three
tablespoonfuls of wine. Excellent for a sick person without
fever.
HOMINY.
Put to soak one pint of hominy in two and one-half pints of
boiling water over night, in a tin vessel with a tight cover; in
the morning add one-half pint of sweet milk and a little salt.
Place on a brisk fire, in a kettle of boiling water, the tin vessel
containing the hominy; let boil one-half hour.
Cracked wheat, oatmeal, mush, are all good food for the
sick.
CHICKEN JELLY.
Cook a chicken in enough water to little more than cover it; let
it stew gently until the meat drops from the bones, and the broth
is reduced to about a pint; season it to taste, with a little salt
and pepper. Strain and press, first through a colander, then
through a coarse cloth. Set it over the fire again and cook a few
minutes longer. Turn it into an earthen vegetable dish to harden;
set it on the ice in the refrigerator. Eat cold in slices. Nice
made into sandwiches, with thin slices of bread, lightly
spread with butter.
BOILED RICE.
Boil half a cupful of rice in just enough water to cover it,
with half a teaspoonful of salt; when the water has boiled nearly
out and the rice begins to look soft and dry, turn over it a cupful
of milk and let it simmer until the rice is done and nearly dry;
take from the fire and beat in a well-beaten egg. Eat it warm with
cream and sugar. Flavor to taste.
CUP PUDDING.
Take one tablespoonful of flour, one egg, mix with cold milk and
a pinch of salt to a batter. Boil fifteen minutes in a buttered
cup. Eat with sauce, fruit or plain sugar.
TAPIOCA CUP PUDDING.
This is very light and delicate for invalids. An even
tablespoonful of tapioca, soaked for two hours in nearly a cup of
new milk; stir into this the yolk of a fresh egg; a little sugar, a
grain of salt, and bake it in a cup for fifteen minutes. A little
jelly may be eaten with it.
BAKED APPLES.
Get nice fruit, a little tart and juicy, but not sour; clean
them nicely, and bake in a moderate oven—regulated so as to
have them done in about an hour; when the skin cracks and the pulp
breaks through in every direction they are done and ready to take
out. Serve with white sugar sprinkled over them.
SOFT TOAST.
Toast well, but not too brown, two thin slices of stale bread;
put them on a warm plate, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, and pour
upon them some boiling water; quickly cover with another dish of
the same size, and drain off the water. Put a very small bit of
butter on the toast and serve at once while hot.
IRISH MOSS BLANC MANGE.
A small handful of moss (to be purchased at any drug store),
wash it very carefully, and put it in one quart of milk on the
fire. Let the milk simmer for about twenty minutes, or until the
moss begins to dissolve. Then remove from the fire and strain
through a fine sieve. Add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and half a
teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring. Put away to harden in cups or
molds, and serve with sugar and cream.
A delicate dish for an invalid.
EGG TOAST.
Brown a slice of bread nicely over the coals, dip it in hot
water slightly salted, butter it, and lay on the top an egg that
has been [Pg 516]broken into boiling water, and cooked until the
white has hardened; season the egg with a bit of butter and a crumb
of salt.
The best way to cook eggs for an invalid is to drop them, or
else pour boiling water over the egg in the shell and let it stand
for a few minutes on the back of the stove.
OYSTER TOAST.
Make a nice slice of dry toast, butter it and lay it on a hot
dish. Put six oysters, half a teacupful of their own liquor, and
half a cupful of milk, into a tin cup or basin, and boil one
minute. Season with a little butter, pepper and salt, then pour
over the toast and serve.
MULLED JELLY.
Take one tablespoonful of currant or grape jelly, beat with it
the white of one egg and a teaspoonful of sugar; pour on it a
teacupful of boiling water, and break in a slice of dry toast or
two crackers.
CUP CUSTARD.
Break into a coffeecup an egg, put in two teaspoonfuls of sugar,
beat it up thoroughly, a pinch of salt and a pinch of grated
nutmeg; fill up the cup with good sweet milk, turn it into another
cup, well buttered, and set it in a pan of boiling water, reaching
nearly to the top of the cup. Set in the oven, and when the custard
is set, it is done. Eat cold.
CLAM BROTH.
Select twelve small, hard-shell clams, drain them and chop them
fine; add half a pint of clam juice or hot water, a pinch of
cayenne, and a walnut of butter; simmer thirty minutes, add a gill
of boiled milk, strain, and serve. This is an excellent broth for
weak stomachs.
MILK OR CREAM CODFISH.
This dish will often relish when a person is recovering from
sickness, when nothing else would. Pick up a large tablespoonful of
salt codfish very fine, freshen it considerably by placing it over
the fire in a basin, covering it with cold water as it comes to a
boil; turn off the water and freshen again if very salt, then turn
off the water until dry, and pour over half a cupful of milk or
thin cream, add a [Pg 517]bit of butter, a sprinkle of pepper,
and a thickening made of one teaspoonful of flour or cornstarch,
wet up with a little milk; when this boils up, turn over a slice of
dipped toast.
CRACKER PANADA.
Break in pieces three or four hard crackers that are baked quite
brown, and let them boil fifteen minutes in one quart of water;
then remove from the fire, let them stand three or four minutes,
strain off the liquor through a fine wire sieve, and season it with
sugar.
This is a nourishing beverage for infants that are teething, and
with the addition of a little wine and nutmeg, is often prescribed
for invalids recovering from a fever.
BREAD PANADA.
Put three gills of water and one tablespoonful of white sugar on
the fire, and just before it boils add two tablespoonfuls of the
crumbs of stale white bread, stir it well, and let it boil three or
four minutes, then add one glass of white wine, a grated lemon and
a little nutmeg; let it boil up once, then remove it from the fire,
and keep it closely covered until it is wanted for use.
SLIPPERY-ELM TEA.
Put a teaspoonful of powdered slippery-elm into a tumbler, pour
cold water upon it, and season with lemon and sugar.
TOAST WATER, OR CRUST COFFEE.
Take stale pieces of crusts of bread, the end pieces of the
loaf, toast them a nice, dark brown, care to be taken that they do
not burn in the least, as that affects the flavor. Put the browned
crusts into a large milk pitcher, and pour enough boiling water
over to cover them; cover the pitcher closely, and let steep until
cold. Strain, and sweeten to taste; put a piece of ice in each
glass.
This is also good, drank warm with cream and sugar, similar to
coffee.
PLAIN MILK TOAST.
Cut a thin slice from a loaf of stale bread, toast it very
quickly, sprinkle a little salt over it, and pour upon it three
tablespoonfuls of boiling milk or cream. Crackers split and toasted
in this manner, are often very grateful to an invalid.
LINSEED TEA.
Put one tablespoonful of linseed into a stewpan with half a pint
of cold water; place the stewpan over a moderate fire, and when the
water is quite warm, pour it off, and add to the linseed half a
pint of fresh cold water, then let the whole boil three or four
minutes; season it with lemon and sugar.
POWDERS FOR CHILDREN.
A very excellent carminative powder for flatulent infants may be
kept in the house, and employed with advantage whenever the child
is in pain or griped, dropping five grains of oil of anise-seed and
two of peppermint on half an ounce of lump sugar, and rubbing it in
a mortar, with a drachm of magnesia, into a fine powder. A small
quantity of this may be given in a little water at any time, and
always with benefit.
FOR CHILDREN TEETHING.
Tie a quarter of a pound of wheat flour in a thick cloth and
boil it in one quart of water for three hours; then remove the
cloth and expose the flour to the air or heat until it is hard and
dry; grate from it, when wanted, one tablespoonful, which put into
half a pint of new milk, and stir over the fire until it comes to a
boil, when add a pinch of salt and a tablespoonful of cold water
and serve. This gruel is excellent for children afflicted with
summer complaint.
Or brown a tablespoonful of flour in the oven or on top of the
stove on a baking tin; feed a few pinches at a time to a child and
it will often check a diarrhoea. The tincture of "kino"—of
which from ten to thirty drops, mixed with a little sugar and water
in a spoon, and given every two or three hours, is very efficacious
and harmless—can be procured at almost any druggist's.
Tablespoon doses of pure cider vinegar and a pinch of salt, has
cured when all else failed.
BLACKBERRY CORDIAL.
This recipe may be found under the head of COFFEE, TEA,
BEVERAGES. It will be found an excellent medicine for children
teething, and summer diseases.
ACID DRINKS.
1. Peel thirty large Malaga grapes, and pour half a pint of
boiling water upon them; cover them closely and let them steep
until the water is cold.
2. Pour half a pint of boiling water upon one tablespoonful of
currant jelly, and stir until the jelly is dissolved.
3. Cranberries and barberries may be used in the same way to
make very refreshing acid drinks for persons recovering from
fevers.
DRAUGHTS FOR THE FEET.
Take a large leaf from the horse-radish plant, and cut out the
hard fibres that run through the leaf; place it on a hot shovel for
a moment to soften it, fold it, and fasten it closely in the hollow
of the foot by a cloth bandage.
Burdock leaves, cabbage leaves, and mullein leaves, are used in
the same manner, to alleviate pain and promote perspiration.
Garlics are also made for draughts by pounding them, placing
them on a hot tin plate for a moment to sweat them, and binding
them closely to the hollow of the foot by a cloth bandage.
Draughts of onions, for infants, are made by roasting onions in
hot ashes, and, when they are quite soft, peeling off the outside,
mashing them, and applying them on a cloth as usual.
POULTICES.
A Bread and Milk Poultice.—Put a tablespoonful of
the crumbs of stale bread into a gill of milk, and give the whole
one boil up. Or, take stale bread crumbs, pour over them boiling
water and boil till soft, stirring well; take from the fire and
gradually stir in a little glycerine or sweet oil, so as to render
the poultice pliable when applied.
A Hop Poultice.—Boil one handful of dried hops in
half a pint of water, until the half pint is reduced to a gill,
then stir into it enough Indian meal to thicken it.
A Mustard Poultice.—Into one gill of boiling water
stir one tablespoonful of Indian meal; spread the paste thus made
upon a cloth and spread over the paste one teaspoonful of mustard
flour. If you wish a mild poultice, use a teaspoonful of mustard as
it is prepared for the table, instead of the mustard flour.
Equal parts of ground mustard and flour made into a paste with
warm water, and spread between two pieces of muslin, form the
indispensable mustard plaster.
A Ginger Poultice.—This is made like a mustard
poultice, using ground ginger instead of mustard. A little vinegar
is sometimes added to each of these poultices.
A Stramonium Poultice.—Stir one tablespoonful of
Indian meal into a gill of boiling water and add one tablespoonful
of bruised stramonium seeds.
Wormwood and Arnica are sometimes applied in poultices.
Steep the herbs in half a pint of cold water and when all their
virtue is extracted stir in a little bran or rye meal to thicken
the liquid; the herbs must not be removed from the liquid.
This is a useful application for sprains and bruises.
Linseed Poultice.—Take four ounces of powdered
linseed and gradually sprinkle it into a half pint of hot
water.
A REMEDY FOR BOILS.
An excellent remedy for boils is water of a temperature
agreeable to the feelings of the patient. Apply wet linen to the
part affected and frequently renew or moisten it. It is said to be
the most effectual remedy known. Take inwardly some good blood
purifier.
CURE FOR RINGWORMS.
Yellow dock, root or leaves, steeped in vinegar, will cure the
worst case of ringworm.
HOW COLDS ARE CAUGHT.
A great many cannot see why it is they do not take a cold when
exposed to cold winds and rain. The fact is, and ought to be more
generally understood, that nearly every cold is contracted indoors,
and is not directly due to the cold outside, but to the heat
inside. A man will go to bed at night feeling as well as usual and
get up in the morning with a royal cold. He goes peeking around in
search of cracks and keyholes and tiny drafts. Weather-strips are
procured, and the house made as tight as a fruit can. In a few days
more the whole family have colds.
Let a man go home, tired or exhausted, eat a full supper of
starchy and vegetable food, occupy his mind intently for a while,
go to bed in a warm, close room, and if he doesn't have a cold in
the morning it will be a wonder. A drink of whisky or a glass or
two of beer before supper will facilitate matters very much.
People swallow more colds down their throats than they inhale or
receive from contact with the air, no matter how cold or chilly it
may be. Plain, light suppers are good to go to bed on, and are far
more conducive to refreshing sleep than a glass of beer or a dose
of chloral. In the estimation of a great many this statement is
rank heresy, but in the light of science, common sense and
experience it is gospel truth.
Pure air is strictly essential to maintain perfect health. If a
person is accustomed to sleeping with the windows open there is but
little danger of taking cold winter or summer. Persons that shut up
the windows to keep out the "night air" make a mistake, for at
night the only air we breathe is "night air," and we need good air
while asleep as much or even more than at any other time of day.
Ventilation can be accomplished by simply opening the window an
inch at the bottom and also at the top, thus letting the pure air
in, the bad air going [Pg 522]outward at the top. Close, foul air
poisons the blood, brings on disease which often results in death;
this poisoning of the blood is only prevented by pure air, which
enters the lungs, becomes charged with waste particles, then
thrown out, and which are poisoning if taken back again. It is
estimated that a grown person corrupts one gallon of pure air
every minute, or twenty-five barrels full in a single night, in
breathing alone.
Clothes that have been worn through the day should be changed
for fresh or dry ones to sleep in. Three pints of moisture, filled
with the waste of the body, are given off every twenty-four hours,
and this is mostly absorbed by the clothing. Sunlight and exposure
to the air purifies the clothing of the poisons which nature is
trying to dispose of, and which would otherwise be brought again
into contact with the body.
Colds are often taken by extreme cold and heat, and a sudden
exposure to cold by passing from a heated room to the cold outside
air. Old and weak persons, especially, should avoid such extreme
change. In passing from warm crowded rooms to the cold air, the
mouth should be kept closed, and all the breathing done through the
nostrils only, that the cold air may be warmed before it reaches
the lungs, or else the sudden change will drive the blood from the
surface of the internal organs, often producing congestions.
Dr. B. I. Kendall writes that "the temperature of the
body should be evenly and properly maintained to secure perfect
health; and to accomplish this purpose requires great care and
caution at times. The human body is, so to speak, the most delicate
and intricate piece of machinery that could possibly be conceived
of, and to keep this in perfect order requires constant care. It is
a fixed law of nature that every violation thereof shall be
punished; and so we find that he who neglects to care for his body
by protecting it from sudden changes of weather, or draughts of
cold air upon unprotected parts of the body, suffers the penalty by
sickness, which may vary according to the exposure and the habits
of the person, which affect the result materially; for what would
be an easy day's work for a man who is accustomed to hard labor,
would be sufficient to excite the circulation to such an extent in
a person unaccustomed to work, that only slight exposure might
cause the death of the latter when over-heated in this way; while
the same exercise and exposure to the man accustomed to hard labor
might not [Pg 523]affect him. So, we say, be careful of your
bodies, for it is a duty you owe to yourselves, your friends, and
particularly to Him who created you. When your body is over-heated
and you are perspiring, be very careful about sitting down to 'cool
off,' as the custom of some is, by removing a part of the clothing
and sitting in a cool place, and perhaps where there is a draught
of air passing over your body. The proper way to 'cool off' when
over-heated is to put on more clothing, especially if you are in a
cool place; but never remove a part of the clothing you have
already on. If possible get near a fire where there is no wind
blowing, and dry off gradually, instead of cooling off
suddenly, which is always dangerous."
Many colds are taken from the feet being damp or wet. To keep
these extremities warm and dry is a great preventative against the
almost endless list of disorders which come from a "slight cold."
Many imagine if their feet are not thoroughly wet, there will be no
harm arising from mere dampness, not knowing that the least
dampness is absorbed into the sole, and is attracted nearer the
foot itself by its heat, and thus perspiration is dangerously
checked.
WATER.
All beings need drink as much as they need food, and it is just
as necessary to health as pure air; therefore the water should be
boiled or filtered before being drank. Rain-water filtered is
probably the best attainable. Boiling the water destroys the
vegetable and animal matter, and leaves the mineral matter
deposited on the bottom of the vessel containing it; therefore it
leaves it clear from poisonous substances.
REGULATION IN DIET.
The food we eat is a very important item, and one which it would
be difficult to arrange any rule for which would apply to all
persons under different circumstances. In health, it is safer to
eat by instinct rather than to follow any definite rules. While
there are many who have a scanty living, with a small variety of
food, there is a large number who have an abundance and a large
variety. The former class, in many cases, live miserable lives,
either to hoard up for miserly purposes the money which might make
them happy, or in some cases through poverty; while the latter
class, as a rule, have better health and have much more enjoyment
in this life, unless it be some [Pg
524]who are gluttonous,
and make themselves miserable by abusing the blessings they should
enjoy. Avoid extremes in living too free or scanty; have a good
nourishing diet and a sufficient quantity, and it should always be
properly cooked; for if the cooking is poorly done, it affects not
only the nutritious qualities, but is not so easily digested, thus
making food, which is originally the best kind, of very little
value to us, and with very poor cooking it is sometimes a positive
injury.
It is very important that the food be taken with regularity at
the accustomed time. Be careful not to take too much drink during
any meal, but, if thirsty, drink water before meal time so that you
will not care for it until some time after eating, as it is a bad
plan to drink much either during or for a little time after the
meal is taken. It is a very bad plan to hurry in eating, because by
so doing the food is not properly masticated; it is better to be a
long time in eating and chew the food well.
HOW TO USE HOT WATER.
One of the simplest and most effectual means of relieving pain
is by the use of hot water, externally and internally, the
temperature varying according to the feelings of the patient. For
bruises, sprains, and similar accidental hurts, it should be
applied immediately, as hot as can be borne, by means of a cloth
dipped in the water and laid on the wounded part, or by immersion,
if convenient, and the treatment kept up until relief is obtained.
If applied at once, the use of hot water will generally prevent,
nearly, if not entirely, the bruised flesh from turning black. For
pains resulting from indigestion, and known as wind colic, etc., a
cupful of hot water, taken in sips, will often relieve at once.
When that is insufficient, a flannel folded in several thicknesses,
large enough to fully cover the painful place should be wrung out
of hot water and laid over the seat of the pain. It should be as
hot as the skin can bear without injury, and be renewed every ten
minutes or oftener, if it feels cool, until the pain is gone. The
remedy is simple, efficient, harmless, and within the reach of
every one; and should be more generally used than it is. If used
along with common sense, it might save many a doctor's bill, and
many a course of drug treatment as well.
GROWING PAINS CURED.
Following in our mother's footsteps, we have been routed night
after night from our warm quarters, in the dead of winter, to
kindle fires and fill frosty kettles from water-pails thickly
crusted with ice, that we might get the writhing pedal extremities
of our little heir into a tub of water as quickly as possible. But
lately we have learned that all this work and exposure is needless.
We simply wring a towel from salted water—a bowl of it
standing in our sleeping room, ready for such an
emergency—wrap the limb in it from the ankle to knee, without
taking the child from his bed, and then swathe with dry flannels,
thick and warm, tucking the blankets about him a little closer, and
relief is sure.
HOW TO KEEP WELL.
Don't sleep in a draught.
Don't go to bed with cold feet.
Don't stand over hot-air registers.
Don't eat what you do not need, just to save it.
Don't try to get cool too quickly after exercising.
Don't sleep in a room without ventilation of some kind.
Don't stuff a cold lest you should be next obliged to starve a
fever.
Don't sit in a damp or chilly room without a fire.
Don't try to get along without flannel underclothing in
winter.
DIPHTHERIA.
A gargle of sulphur and water has been used with much success in
cases of diphtheria. Let the patient swallow a little of the
mixture. Or, when you discover that your throat is a little sore,
bind a strip of flannel around the throat, wet in camphor, and
gargle salt and vinegar occasionally.
COLDS AND HOARSENESS.
Borax has proved a most effective remedy in certain forms of
colds. In sudden hoarseness or loss of voice in public speakers or
singers, from colds, relief for an hour or so may be obtained by
slowly dissolving, and partially swallowing, a lump of borax the
size of a garden pea, or about three or four grains held in the
mouth for ten or fifteen minutes before speaking or singing. This
produces a [Pg 526]profuse secretion of saliva or "watering" of the
mouth and throat, just as wetting brings back the missing notes to
a flute when it is too dry.
A flannel dipped in boiling water and sprinkled with turpentine,
laid on chest as quickly as possible, will relieve the most severe
cold or hoarseness.
Another simple, pleasant remedy is furnished by beating up the
white of one egg, adding to it the juice of one lemon, and
sweetening with white sugar to taste. Take a teaspoonful from time
to time. It has been known to effectually cure the ailment.
Or bake a lemon or sour orange twenty minutes in a moderate
oven. When done, open at one end and take out the inside. Sweeten
with sugar or molasses. This is an excellent remedy for
hoarseness.
An old time and good way to relieve a cold is to go to bed and
stay there, drinking nothing, not even water, for
twenty-four hours, and eating as little as possible. Or go to bed,
put your feet in hot mustard and water, put a bran or oatmeal
poultice on the chest, take ten grains of Dover's powder, and an
hour afterwards a pint of hot gruel; in the morning, rub the body
all over with a coarse towel, and take a dose of aperient
medicine.
Violet, pennyroyal or boneset tea, is excellent to promote
perspiration in case of sudden chill. Care should be taken next day
not to get chilled by exposure to fresh out-door air.
MOLASSES POSSET.
This old-fashioned remedy for a cold is as effectual now as it
was in old times. Put into a saucepan a pint of the best West India
molasses, a teaspoonful of powdered white ginger and a quarter of a
pound of fresh butter. Set it over the fire and simmer it slowly
for half an hour, stirring it frequently. Do not let it come to a
boil. Then stir in the juice of two lemons, or two tablespoonfuls
of vinegar; cover the pan and let it stand by the fire five minutes
longer. This is good for a cold. Some of it may be taken warm at
once, and the remainder kept at hand for occasional use.
It is the preparation absurdly called by the common people
stewed quaker.
Half a pint of strained honey mixed cold with the juice of a
lemon and a tablespoonful of sweet oil, is another remedy for a
cold; a teaspoonful or two to be taken whenever the cough is
troublesome.
COUGH SYRUP.
Syrup of squills four ounces, syrup of tolu four ounces,
tincture of bloodroot one and one-half ounces, camphorated tincture
of opium four ounces. Mix. Dose for an adult, one teaspoonful
repeated every two to four hours, or as often as necessary.
LEANNESS.
Is caused generally by lack of power in the digestive organs to
digest and assimilate the fat-producing elements of food. First
restore digestion, take plenty of sleep, drink all the water the
stomach will bear in the morning on rising, take moderate exercise
in the open air, eat oatmeal, cracked wheat, graham mush, baked
sweet apples, roasted and broiled beef, cultivate jolly people, and
bathe daily.
FOR TOOTHACHE.
The worst toothache, or neuralgia, coming from the teeth may be
speedily and delightfully ended by the application of a bit of
clean cotton saturated in a solution of ammonia to the defective
tooth. Sometimes the late sufferer is prompted to momentary
laughter by the application, but the pain will disappear.
Alum reduced to a powder, a teaspoonful of the powder and an
equal quantity of fine salt well mixed, applied to the gums by
dipping your moistened finger in the mixed powder; put some also in
the tooth, and keep rubbing the gums with it; it scarcely ever
fails to cure.
TO CURE A STING OF A BEE OR WASP.
Bind on common baking soda, dampened with water. Or mix common
earth with water to about the consistency of mud.
TO CURE EARACHE.
Take a bit of cotton batting, put on it a pinch of black pepper,
gather it up and tie it, dip it in sweet oil, and insert it in the
ear; put a flannel bandage over the head to keep it warm; it often
gives immediate relief.
Tobacco smoke, puffed into the ear, has often been
effectual.
Another remedy: Take equal parts of tincture of opium and
glycerine. Mix, and from a warm teaspoon drop two or three drops
into [Pg 528]the ear, stop the ear tight with cotton, and repeat
every hour or two. If matter should form in the ear, make a suds
with castile soap and warm water, about 100° F., or a little
more than milk warm, and have some person inject it into the ear
while you hold that side of your head the lowest. If it does not
heal in due time, inject a little carbolic acid and water in the
proportion of one drachm of the acid to one pint of warm water each
time after using the suds.
CROUP.
Croup, it is said, can be cured in one minute, and the remedy is
simply alum and sugar. Take a knife or grater and shave off in
small particles about a teaspoonful of alum; then mix it with twice
its amount of sugar, to make it palatable, and administer it as
quickly as possible. Almost instantaneous relief will follow.
Turpentine is said to be an excellent remedy for croup. Saturate a
piece of flannel and apply it to the chest and throat, and take
inwardly three or four drops on a lump of sugar.
Another remedy.—Give a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha
wine every few minutes, until free vomiting is excited.
Another recipe said to be most reliable: Take two ounces of the
wine of ipecac, hive syrup four ounces, tincture of bloodroot two
ounces. Mix it well.
Dose for a child one year old, five to ten drops; two years,
eight to twelve drops; three years, twelve to fifteen drops; four
years, fifteen to twenty drops; five years, twenty to twenty-five
drops, and older children in proportion to age. Repeat as often as
shall be necessary to procure relief. If it is thought best to
produce vomiting, repeat the dose every ten or fifteen minutes for
a few doses.
BURNS AND SCALDS.
A piece of cotton wadding, spread with butter or sweet oil, and
bound on the burn instantly, will draw out the pain without leaving
a scar; also a handful of flour, bound on instantly, will prevent
blistering. The object is to entirely exclude the air from the part
affected. Some use common baking-soda, dry or wet, often giving
instant relief, withdrawing the heat and pain. Another valuable
remedy is to beat the yellow of an egg into linseed oil, and apply
it with a feather on the injured part frequently. It will afford
ready relief and heals with [Pg
529]great rapidity.
Some recommend the white part of the egg, which is very cooling and
soothing, and soon allays the smarting pain. It is the exposure of
the part coming in contact with the air that gives the extreme
discomfort experienced from ordinary afflictions of this kind, and
anything which excludes air and prevents inflammation is the thing
to be at once applied.
TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD.
For a slight cut there is nothing better to control the
hemorrhage than common unglazed brown wrapping paper, such as is
used by marketmen and grocers; a piece to be bound over the wound.
A handful of flour bound on the cut. Cobwebs and brown sugar,
pressed on like lint. When the blood ceases to flow, apply arnica
or laudanum.
When an artery is cut the red blood spurts out at each
pulsation. Press the thumb firmly over the artery near the wound,
and on the side toward the heart. Press hard enough to stop the
bleeding, and wait till a physician comes. The wounded person is
often able to do this himself, if he has the requisite
knowledge.
GRAVEL.
Into a pint of water put two ounces of bicarbonate of soda. Take
two tablespoonfuls in the early forenoon, and the same toward
night; also drink freely of water through the day. Inflammation of
the kidneys has been successfully treated with large doses of
lime-water.
Persons troubled with kidney difficulty should abstain from
sugar and the things that are converted into sugar in digestion,
such as starchy food and sweet vegetables.
SORE THROAT.
Everybody has a cure for this trouble, but simple remedies
appear to be most effectual. Salt and water is used by many as a
gargle, but a little alum and honey dissolved in sage tea is
better. An application of cloths wrung out of hot water and applied
to the neck, changing as often as they begin to cool, has the most
potency for removing inflammation of anything we ever tried. It
should be kept up for a number of hours; during the evening is
usually the most convenient time for applying this remedy.
Cut slices of salt pork or fat bacon, simmer a few minutes in
hot vinegar, and apply to throat as hot as possible. When this is
taken off as the throat is relieved, put around a bandage of soft
flannel. A gargle of equal parts of borax and alum, dissolved in
water, is also excellent. To be used frequently.
Camphorated oil is an excellent lotion for sore throat, sore
chest, aching limbs, etc. For a gargle for sore throat, put a pinch
of chlorate of potash in a glass of water. Gargle the throat with
it twice a day, or oftener, if necessary.
WHOOPING COUGH.
Two level tablespoonfuls of powdered alum, two-thirds of a
cupful of brown sugar, dissolved in two quarts of water; bottle and
put in a dark closet where it is cool.
For a child one year old, a teaspoonful three times a day on an
empty stomach. For a child two years old, two teaspoonfuls for a
dose. For a child five years old, a tablespoonful. The state of the
bowels must be attended to, and the doses repeated accordingly. No
other medicine to be taken, except an emetic, at first, if
desirable. Except in the case of an infant, a milk diet is to be
avoided.
DIARRHOEA.
Take tincture of Jamaica ginger one ounce, tincture of rhubarb
one ounce, tincture of opium half ounce, tincture of cardamom one
and one-half ounces, tincture of kino one ounce. Mix. Dose for an
adult, half to one teaspoonful, repeated every two to four hours;
and for children one year old, five drops; two years old, five to
ten drops; three years old, ten to twelve drops, and older children
in proportion to age.
FOR CONSTIPATION.
One or two figs eaten fasting is sufficient for some, and they
are especially good in the case of children, as there is no trouble
in getting them to take them. A spoonful of wheaten bran in a glass
of water is a simple remedy, and quite effective, taken half an
hour before breakfast; fruit eaten raw; partake largely of laxative
food; exercise in the open air; drink freely of cold water during
the day, etc. It is impossible to give many of the numerous
treatments in so short a space, suffice it to say that the general
character of our diet and[Pg
531] experience is such
as to assure us that at least one-quarter of the food that we
swallow is intended by nature to be evacuated from the system; and
if it is not, it is again absorbed into the system, poisoning the
blood and producing much suffering and permanent disease. The
evacuation of the bowels daily, and above all,
regularity, is therefore all important to aid this form of
disorder.
RELIEF FROM ASTHMA.
Sufferers from asthma should get a muskrat skin and wear it over
their lungs with the fur side next to the body. It will bring
certain relief.
Or soak blotting paper in saltpetre water, then dry, burning at
night in the patient's bedroom.
Another excellent recipe: Take powdered liquorice root, powdered
elecampane root, powdered anise-seed, each one drachm, powdered
ipecac ten grains, powdered lobelia ten grains; add sufficient
amount of tar to form into pills of ordinary size. Take three or
four pills on going to bed. An excellent remedy for asthma or
shortness of breath.
RECIPES FOR FELONS.
Take common rock salt, as used for salting down pork or beef,
dry in an oven, then pound it fine and mix with spirits of
turpentine in equal parts; put it in a rag and wrap it around the
parts affected; as it gets dry put on more, and in twenty-four
hours you are cured. The felon will be dead.
Or purchase the herb of stramonium at the druggist's; steep it
and bind it on the felon; as soon as cold, put on new, warm herbs.
It will soon kill it, in a few hours at least.
Or saturate a bit or grated wild turnip, the size of a bean,
with spirits of turpentine, and apply it to the affected part. It
relieves the pain at once; in twelve hours there will be a hole to
the bone, and the felon destroyed; then apply healing salve, and
the finger is well.
Another Way to Cure a Felon: Fill a tumbler with equal
parts of fine salt and ice; mix well. Sink the finger in the
centre, allow it to remain until it is nearly frozen and numb; then
withdraw it, and when sensation is restored, renew the operation
four or five times, when it will be found the disease is destroyed.
This must be done before pus is formed.
A simple remedy for felons, relieving pain at once, no
poulticing, no cutting, no "holes to the bone," no necessity for
healing salve, but simple oil of cedar applied a few times at the
commencement of the felon, and the work is done.
REMEDY FOR LOCKJAW.
If any person is threatened or taken with lockjaw from injuries
of the arms, legs or feet, do not wait for a doctor, but put the
part injured in the following preparation: Put hot wood-ashes into
water as warm as can be borne; if the injured part cannot be put
into water, then wet thick folded cloths in the water and apply
them to the part as soon as possible, at the same time bathe the
backbone from the neck down with some laxative stimulant—say
cayenne pepper and water, or mustard and water (good vinegar is
better than water); it should be as hot as the patient can bare it.
Don't hesitate; go to work and do it, and don't stop until the jaws
will come open. No person need die of lockjaw if these directions
are followed.
Cure for Lockjaw, Said to be Positive.—Let anyone
who has an attack of lockjaw take a small quantity of spirits of
turpentine, warm it, and pour it in the wound—no matter where
the wound is or what its nature is—and relief will follow in
less than one minute. Turpentine is also a sovereign remedy for
croup. Saturate a piece of flannel with it, and place the flannel
on the throat and chest—- and in very severe cases, three to
five drops on a lump of sugar may be taken internally.
BLEEDING AT THE NOSE.
Roll up a piece of paper and press it under the upper lip. In
obstinate cases, blow a little gum arabic up the nostril through a
quill, which will immediately stop the discharge; powdered alum,
dissolved in water, is also good. Pressure by the finger over the
small artery near the ala (wing) of the nose on the side where the
blood is flowing, is said to arrest the hemorrhage immediately.
Sometimes by wringing a cloth out of very hot water and laying it
on the back of the neck, gives relief. Napkins wrung out of cold
water must be laid across the forehead and nose, the hands dipped
in cold water, and a bottle of hot water applied to the feet.
TO TAKE CINDERS FROM THE EYE.
In most cases a simple and effective cure may be found in one or
two grains of flax-seed, which can be placed in the eye without
pain or injury. As they dissolve, a glutinous substance is formed,
which envelops any foreign body that may be under the lid, and the
whole is easily washed out. A dozen of these seeds should
constitute a part of every traveler's outfit.
Another remedy for removing objects from the eye: Take a
horse-hair and double it, leaving a loop. If the object can be
seen, lay the loop over it, close the eye, and the mote will come
out as the hair is withdrawn. If the irritating object cannot be
seen, raise the lid of the eye as high as possible and place the
loop as far as you can, close the eye and roll the ball around a
few times, draw out the hair, and the substance which caused the
pain will be sure to come with it. This method is practiced by
axemakers and other workers in steel.
EYE-WASHES.
The best eye-wash for granulated lids and inflammation of the
eyes is composed of camphor, borax and morphine, in the following
proportions: To a large wine-glass of camphor water—not
spirits—add two grains of morphine and six grains of borax.
Pour a few drops into the palm of the hand, and hold the eye in it,
opening the lid as much as possible. Do this three or four times in
twenty-four hours, and you will receive great relief from pain and
smarting soreness. This recipe was received from a celebrated
oculist, and has never failed to relieve the most inflamed
eyes.
Another remedy said to be reliable: A lump of alum as large as a
cranberry boiled in a teacupful of sweet milk, and the curd used as
a poultice, is excellent for inflammation of the eyes.
Another wash: A cent's worth of pure, refined white copperas
dissolved in a pint of water, is also a good lotion; but label it
poison, as it should never go near the mouth. Bathe the eyes
with the mixture, either with the hands or a small piece of linen
cloth, allowing some of the liquid to get under the lids.
Here is another from an eminent oculist: Take half an ounce of
rock salt and one ounce of dry sulphate of zinc; simmer in a clean,
covered porcelain vessel with three pints of water until all are
dissolved; strain through thick muslin; add one ounce of
rose-water; [Pg 534]bottle and cork it tight. To use it, mix one
teaspoonful of rain-water with one of the eye-water, and bathe the
eyes frequently. If it smarts too much, add more water.
SUNSTROKE.
Wrap a wet cloth bandage over the head; wet another cloth,
folded small, square, cover it thickly with salt, and bind it on
the back of the neck; apply dry salt behind the ears. Put mustard
plasters to the calves of the legs and soles of the feet. This is
an effectual remedy.
TO REMOVE WARTS.
Wash with water saturated with common washing-soda, and let it
dry without wiping; repeat frequently until they disappear. Or pass
a pin through the wart and hold one end of it over the flame of a
candle or lamp until the wart fires by the heat, and it will
disappear.
Another treatment of warts is to pare the hard and dry skin from
their tops, and then touch them with the smallest drop of strong
acetic acid, taking care that the acid does not run off the wart
upon the neighboring skin; for if it does it will occasion
inflammation and much pain. If this is continued once or twice
daily, with regularity, paring the surface of the wart occasionally
when it gets hard and dry, the wart will soon be effectually
cured.
SWAIM'S VERMIFUGE.
Worm seed, two ounces; valerian, rhubarb, pink root, white
agaric, senna, of each one ounce and a half. Boil in sufficient
water to yield three quarts of decoction. Now add to it ten drops
of the oil of tansy and forty-five drops of the oil of cloves,
dissolved in a quart of rectified spirit. Dose: one tablespoonful
at night.
FAINTING. (Syncope.)
Immediately place the person fainting in a lying position, with
head lower than body. In this way consciousness returns
immediately, while in the erect position it often ends in
death.
FOR SEVERE SPRAINS.
The white of an egg, a tablespoonful of vinegar and a
tablespoonful of spirits of turpentine. Mix in a bottle, shake
thoroughly, and bathe the sprain as soon as possible after the
accident. This was published in Life Secrets, but it is
republished by request on account of its great value. It should be
remembered by everyone.
An invaluable remedy for a sprain or bruise is wormwood boiled
in vinegar and applied hot, with enough cloths wrapped around it to
keep the sprain moist.
CAMPHORATED OIL.
Best oil of Lucca, gum camphor. Pound some gum camphor and fill
a wide-necked pint bottle one-third full; fill up with olive oil
and set away until the camphor is absorbed. Excellent lotion for
sore chest, sore throat, aching limbs, etc.
LINIMENT FOR CHILBLAINS.
Spirits of turpentine, three drachms; camphorated oil, nine
drachms.
Mix for a liniment. For an adult four drachms of the former and
eight of the latter may be used. If the child be young, or if the
skin be tender, the camphorated oil may be used without the
turpentine.
"THE SUN'S" CHOLERA MIXTURE.
More than forty years ago, when it was found that prevention for
the Asiatic cholera was easier than cure, the learned doctors of
both hemispheres drew up a prescription, which was published (for
working people) in The New York Sun, and took the name of
"The Sun Cholera Mixture." It is found to be the best remedy for
looseness of the bowels ever yet devised. It is to be commended for
several reasons. It is not to be mixed with liquor, and therefore
will not be used as an alcoholic beverage. Its ingredients are well
known among all the common people, and it will have no prejudice to
combat; each of the materials is in equal proportions to the
others, and it may therefore be compounded without professional
skill; and as the dose is so very small, it may be carried in a
tiny phial in the waistcoat pocket, and be always at hand. It
is:—
Take equal parts of tincture of cayenne, tincture of opium,
tincture of rhubarb, essence of peppermint and spirits of camphor.
Mix well. Dose fifteen to thirty drops in a wine-glass of water,
according to age and violence of the attack. Repeat every fifteen
or twenty minutes until relief is obtained. No one who takes it in
time will ever have the cholera. Even when no cholera is
anticipated, it is a valuable remedy for ordinary summer
complaints, and should always be kept in readiness.
COMP. CATHARTIC ELIXIR.
The only pleasant and reliable cathartic in liquid form that can
be prescribed.
Each fluid ounce contains: sulp. magnesia one drachm, senna two
drachms, scammony six grains, liquorice one drachm, ginger three
grains, coriander, five grains, with flavoring ingredients.
Dose.—Child five years old, one or two
teaspoonfuls; adult, one or two tablespoonfuls.
This preparation is being used extensively throughout the
country. It was originated with the design of furnishing a liquid
cathartic remedy that could be prescribed in a palatable form. It
will be taken by children with a relish.
GRANDMOTHER'S COUGH SYRUP.
Take half a pound of dry hoarhound herbs, one pod of red pepper,
four tablespoonfuls of ginger, boil all in three quarts of water,
then strain, and add one teaspoonful of good, fresh tar and a pound
of sugar. Boil slowly and stir often, until it is reduced to one
quart of syrup. When cool, bottle for use. Take one or two
teaspoonfuls four or six times a day.
GRANDMOTHER'S UNIVERSAL LINIMENT.
One pint of alcohol and as much camphor gum as can be dissolved
in it, half an ounce of the oil of cedar, one-half ounce of the oil
of sassafras, aqua ammonia half an ounce, and the same amount of
the tincture of morphine. Shake well together and apply by the
fire; the liniment must not be heated, or come in contact with the
fire, but the rubbing to be done by the warmth of the fire.
These recipes of Grandmother's are all old, tried medicines, and
are more effectual than most of those that are advertised, as they
have been thoroughly tried, and proved reliable.
GRANDMOTHER'S FAMILY SPRING BITTERS.
Mandrake root one ounce, dandelion root one ounce, burdock root
one ounce, yellow dock root one ounce, prickly ash berries two
ounces, marsh mallow one ounce, turkey rhubarb half an ounce,
gentian one ounce, English camomile flowers one ounce, red clover
tops two ounces.
Wash the herbs and roots; put them into an earthen vessel, pour
over two quarts of water that has been boiled and cooled; let it
stand over night and soak; in the morning set it on the back of the
stove, and steep it five hours; it must not boil, but be nearly
ready to boil. Strain it through a cloth, and add half a pint of
good gin. Keep it in a cool place. Half a wine-glass taken as a
dose twice a day.
This is better than all the patent blood medicines that are in
the market—a superior blood purifier, and will cure almost
any malignant sore, by taking according to direction, and washing
the sore with a strong tea of red raspberry leaves steeped, first
washing the sore with castile soap, then drying with a soft cloth,
and washing it with the strong tea of red raspberry leaves.
GRANDMOTHER'S EYE-WASH.
Take three fresh eggs and break them into one quart of clear,
cold rain-water; stir until thoroughly mixed; bring to a boil on a
slow fire, stirring often; then add half an ounce of sulphate of
zinc (white vitrol); continue the boiling for two minutes, then set
it off the fire. Take the curd that settles at the bottom of this
and apply to the eye at night with a bandage. It will speedily draw
out all fever and soreness. Strain the liquid through a cloth and
use for bathing the eyes occasionally. This is the best eye-water
ever made for man or beast. I have used it for twenty years without
knowing it to fail.
HUNTER'S PILLS.
These pills can be manufactured at home and are truly
reliable, having been sold and used for more than fifty years
in Europe. The ingredients may be procured at almost any
druggist's. The articles should be all in the powder. Saffron one
grain, rue one grain, Scot [Pg
538]aloes two grains,
savin one grain, cayenne pepper one grain. Mix all into a very
thick mass by adding sufficient syrup. Rub some fine starch on the
surface of a platter or large dinner-plate, then with your
forefinger and thumb nip off a small piece of the mass the size of
a pill and roll it in pill form, first dipping your fingers in the
starch. Place them as fast as made on the platter, set where they
will dry slowly. Put them into a dry bottle or paper box. Dose, one
every night and morning as long as occasion requires.
This recipe is worth ten times the price of this book to
any female requiring the need of these regulating pills.
HINTS IN REGARD TO HEALTH.
It is plainly seen by an inquiring mind that, aside from the
selection and preparation of food, there are many little things
constantly arising in the experience of everyday life which, in
their combined effect, are powerful agents in the formation (or
prevention) of perfect health. A careful observance of these little
occurences, an inquiry into the philosophy attending them, lies
within the province, and indeed should be considered among the
highest duties, of every housekeeper.
That one should be cautious about entering a sick room in a
state of perspiration, as the moment you become cool your pores
absorb. Do not approach contagious diseases with an empty stomach,
nor sit between the sick and the fire, because the heat attracts
the vapor.
That the flavor of cod-liver oil may be changed to the
delightful one of fresh oyster, if the patient will drink a large
glass of water poured from a vessel in which nails have been
allowed to rust.
That a bag of hot sand relieves neuralgia.
That warm borax water will remove dandruff.
That salt should be eaten with nuts to aid digestion.
That it rests you, in sewing, to change your position
frequently.
That a little soda water will relieve sick headache caused by
indigestion.
That a cupful of strong coffee will remove the odor of onions
from the breath.
That well-ventilated bedrooms will prevent morning headaches and
lassitude.
A cupful of hot water drank before meals will relieve nausea and
dyspepsia.
That a fever patient can be made cool and comfortable by
frequent sponging off with soda water.
That consumptive night-sweats may be arrested by sponging the
body nightly in salt water.
That one in a faint should be laid flat on his back, then loosen
his clothes and let him alone.
The best time to bathe is just before going to bed, as any
danger of taking cold is thus avoided; and the complexion is
improved by keeping warm for several hours after leaving the
bath.
To beat the whites of eggs quickly add a pinch of salt. Salt
cools, and cold eggs froth rapidly.
Hot, dry flannels, applied as hot as possible, for
neuralgia.
Sprains and bruises call for an application of the tincture of
arnica.
If an artery is severed, tie a small cord or handkerchief above
it.
For bilious colic, soda and ginger in hot water. It may be taken
freely.
Tickling in the throat is best relieved by a gargling of salt
and water.
Pains in the side are most promptly relieved by the application
of mustard.
For cold in the head nothing is better than powdered borax,
sniffed up the nostrils.
A drink of hot, strong lemonade before going to bed will often
break up a cold and cure a sore throat.
Nervous spasms are usually relieved by a little salt taken into
the mouth and allowed to dissolve.
Whooping cough paroxysms are relieved by breathing the fumes of
turpentine and carbolic acid.
Broken limbs should be placed in natural positions, and the
patient kept quiet until the surgeon arrives.
Hemorrhages of the lungs or stomach are promptly checked by
small doses of salt. The patient should be kept as quiet as
possible.
Sleeplessness, caused by too much blood in the head may be
overcome by applying a cloth wet with cold water to the back of the
neck.
Wind colic is promptly relieved by peppermint essence taken in a
little warm water. For small children it may be sweetened.
Paregoric is also good.
For stomach cramps, ginger ale or a teaspoonful of the tincture
of ginger in a half glass of water in which a half teaspoonful of
soda has been dissolved.
Sickness of the stomach is most promptly relieved by drinking a
teacupful of hot soda and water. If it brings the offending matter
up, all the better.
A teaspoonful of ground mustard in a cupful of warm water is a
prompt and reliable emetic, and should be resorted to in cases of
poisoning or cramps in the stomach from over-eating.
Avoid purgatives or strong physic, as they not only do no good,
but are positively hurtful. Pills may relieve for the time, but
they seldom cure.
Powdered resin is the best thing to stop bleeding from cuts.
After the powder is sprinkled on, wrap the wound with soft cotton
cloth. As soon as the wound begins to feel feverish, keep the cloth
wet with cold water.
Eggs are considered one of the best remedies for dysentery.
Beaten up slightly, with or without sugar, and swallowed, they tend
by their emollient qualities to lessen the inflammation of the
stomach and intestines, and by forming a transient coating on those
organs, enable Nature to resume her healthful sway over the
diseased body. Two, or at most, three eggs per day, would be all
that is required in ordinary cases; and, since the egg is not
merely medicine, but food as well, the lighter the diet otherwise,
and the quieter the patient is kept, the more certain and rapid is
the recovery.
Hot water is better than cold for bruises. It relieves pain
quickly, and by preventing congestion often keeps off the ugly
black and blue mark. "Children cry for it," when they experience
the relief it affords their bumps and bruises.
For a sprained ankle, the whites of eggs and powdered alum made
into a plaster is almost a specific.
MEDICINAL FOOD.
Spinach has a direct effect upon complaints of the kidneys; the
common dandelion, used as greens, is excellent for the same
trouble; [Pg 541]asparagus purifies the blood; celery acts
admirably upon the nervous system, and is a cure for rheumatism and
neuralgia; tomatoes act upon the liver; beets and turnips are
excellent appetizers; lettuce and cucumbers are cooling in their
effects upon the system; beans are a very nutritious and
strengthening vegetable; while onions, garlic, leeks, chives and
shallots, all of which are similar, possess medicinal virtues of a
marked character, stimulating the circulatory system, and the
consequent increase of the saliva and the gastric juice promoting
digestion. Red onions are an excellent diuretic, and the white ones
are recommended raw as a remedy for insomnia. They are tonic,
nutritious. A soup made from onions is regarded by the French as an
excellent restorative in debility of the digestive organs. We might
go through the entire list and find each vegetable possessing its
especial mission of cure, and it will be plain to every housekeeper
that a vegetable diet should be partly adopted, and will prove of
great advantage to the health of the family.
The time given is the general average; the time will vary
slightly with the quality of the article.
USES OF AMMONIA.
All housekeepers should keep a bottle of liquid ammonia, as it
is the most powerful and useful agent for cleaning silks, stuffs
and hats, in fact cleans everything it touches. A few drops of
ammonia in water will take off grease from dishes, pans, etc., and
does not injure the hands as much as the use of soda and strong
chemical soaps. A spoonful in a quart of warm water for cleaning
paint makes it look like new, and so with everything that needs
cleaning.
Spots on towels and hosiery will disappear with little trouble
if a little ammonia is put into enough water to soak the articles,
and they are left in it an hour or two before washing; and if a
cupful is put into the water in which clothes are soaked the night
before washing, the ease with which the articles can be washed, and
their great whiteness and clearness when dried, will be very
gratifying. Remembering the small sum paid for three quarts of
ammonia of common strength, one can easily see that no bleaching
preparation can be more cheaply obtained.
No articles in kitchen use are so likely to be neglected and
abused as the dish-cloth and dish-towels; and in washing these,
ammonia, if properly used, is a greater comfort than anywhere else.
Put a teaspoonful into the water in which these cloths are, or
should be, washed everyday; rub soap on the towels. Put them in the
water; let them stand half an hour or so; then rub them out
thoroughly, rinse faithfully, and dry outdoors in clear air and
sun, and dish-cloths and towels need never look gray and
dingy—a perpetual discomfort to all housekeepers.
A dark carpet often looks dusty soon after it has been swept,
and you know it does not need sweeping again; so wet a cloth or a
sponge, [Pg 544]wring it almost dry, and wipe off the dust. A few
drops of ammonia in the water will brighten the colors.
For cleaning hair-brushes it is excellent; put a tablespoonful
into the water, having it only tepid, and dip up and down until
clean; then dry with the brushes down and they will be like new
ones.
When employed in washing anything that is not especially soiled,
use the waste water afterward for the house plants that are taken
down from their usual position and immersed in the tub of water.
Ammonia is a fertilizer, and helps to keep healthy the plants it
nourishes. In every way, in fact, ammonia is the housekeeper's
friend.
Ammonia is not only useful for cleaning, but as a household
medicine. Half a teaspoonful taken in half a tumbler of water is
far better for faintness than alcoholic stimulants. In the
Temperance Hospital in London, it is used with the best results. It
was used freely by Lieutenant Greely's Arctic party for keeping up
circulation. It is a relief in nervousness, headache and heart
disturbances.
TO DESTROY INSECTS AND VERMIN.
Dissolve two pounds of alum in three or four quarts of water.
Let it remain over night till all the alum is dissolved. Then with
a brush, apply boiling hot to every joint or crevice in the closet
or shelves where croton bugs, ants, cockroaches, etc., intrude;
also to the joints and crevices of bedsteads, as bed bugs dislike
it as much as croton bugs, roaches, or ants. Brush all the cracks
in the floor and mop-boards. Keep it boiling hot while using.
To keep woolens and furs from moths, be sure that none are in
the articles when they are put away; then take a piece of strong
brown paper, with not a hole through which even a pin can enter.
Put the article in it with several lumps of gum camphor between the
folds; place this in a close box or trunk. Cover every joint with
paper. A piece of cotton cloth, if thick and firm, will answer.
Wherever a knitting-needle can pass, the parent moth can enter.
Place pieces of camphor, cedar-wood, Russia leather,
tobacco-leaves, whole cloves, or anything strongly aromatic, in the
drawers or boxes where furs and other things to be preserved from
moths are kept and they will never be harmed. Mice never get into
drawers or trunks where gum camphor is placed.
Another Recipe.—Mix half a pint of alcohol, the
same quantity of turpentine and two ounces of camphor. Keep in a
stone bottle and shake well before using. The clothes or furs are
to be wrapped in linen, and crumbled-up pieces of blotting-paper
dipped in the liquid to be placed in the box with them, so that it
smells strong. This requires renewing but once a year.
Another authority says that a positive, sure recipe is this: Mix
equal quantities of pulverized borax, camphor gum and saltpetre
together, making a powder. Sprinkle it dry under the edges of
carpets, in drawers, trunks, etc., etc. It will also keep out all
kinds of insects, if plentifully used. If the housekeeper will
begin at the top of her house with a powder bellows and a large
quantity of this fresh powder, and puff it thoroughly into every
crack and crevice, whether or not there are croton bugs in them, to
the very bottom of her house, special attention being paid to old
furniture, closets, and wherever croton water is introduced, she
will be freed from these torments. The operation may require a
repetition, but the end is success.
MOTHS IN CARPETS.
If you fear that they are at work at the edge of the carpet, it
will sometimes suffice to lay a wet towel, and press a hot
flat-iron over it; but the best way is to take the carpet up, and
clean it, and give a good deal of attention to the floor. Look in
the cracks, and if you discover signs of moths, wash the floor with
benzine, and scatter red pepper on it before putting the carpet
lining down.
Heavy carpets sometimes do not require taking up every year,
unless in constant use. Take out the tacks from these, fold the
carpets back, wash the floor in strong suds with a tablespoonful of
borax dissolved in it. Dash with insect powder, or lay with tobacco
leaves along the edge, and re-tack. Or use turpentine, the enemy of
buffalo moths, carpet worms and other insects that injure and
destroy carpets. Mix the turpentine with pure water in the
proportion of three tablespoonfuls to three quarts of water, and
then after the carpet has been well swept, go over each breadth
carefully with a sponge dipped in the solution and wrung nearly
dry. Change the water as often as it becomes dirty. The carpet will
be nicely cleaned as well as disinfected. All moths can be kept
away and the eggs destroyed by this means. Spots may be renovated
by the use of ox-gall or ammonia and water.
A good way to brighten a carpet is to put half a tumbler of
spirits of turpentine in a basin of water, and dip your broom in it
and sweep over the carpet once or twice and it will restore the
color and brighten it up until you would think it new. Another good
way to clean old carpets is to rub them over with meal; just dampen
it a very little and rub the carpet with it and when perfectly dry,
sweep over with meal. After a carpet is thoroughly swept, rub it
with a cloth dipped in water and ammonia; it will brighten the
colors and make it look like new.
TO TAKE OUT MACHINE GREASE.
Cold water, a tablespoonful of ammonia and soap, will take out
machine grease where other means would not answer on account of
colors running, etc.
TO WASH FLANNELS.
The first thing to consider in washing flannels so that they
retain their size, is that the articles be washed and
rinsed in water of the same temperature, that is,
about as warm as the hands can bear, and not allowed to cool
between. The water should be a strong suds. Bub through two soapy
waters; wring them out, and put into plenty of clear, clean, warm
water to rinse. Then into another of the same temperature, blued a
little. Wring, shake them well and hang up. Do not take out of this
warm water and hang out in a freezing air, as that certainly tends
to shrink them. It is better to dry them in the house, unless the
sun shines. They should dry quickly. Colored flannels should
never be washed in the same water after white clothes, or they will
be covered, when dry, with lint; better be washed in a water for
themselves. In washing worsteds, such as merino dress goods, pursue
the same course, only do not wring them hard; shake, hang them up
and let drain. While a little damp, bring in and press smoothly on
the wrong side with as hot an iron as can be used without scorching
the goods.
Flannels that have become yellow from being badly washed, may be
nicely whitened by soaking them two or three hours in a lather made
of one-quarter of a pound of soft soap, two tablespoonfuls of
powdered borax and two tablespoonfuls of carbonate of ammonia,
dissolved in five or six gallons of water.
TO STARCH, FOLD AND IRON SHIRTS.
To three tablespoonfuls of dry, fine starch allow a quart of
water. First wet the starch smooth in a little cold water in a tin
pan, put into it a little pinch of salt and a piece of enamel, or
shirt polish the size of a bean, or a piece of clean tallow, or a
piece of butter the size of a cranberry; pour over this a quart of
boiling water, stirring rapidly, placing it over the fire.
Cook until clear, then remove it from the fire and set the pan in
another of warm water to keep the starch warm.
Turn the shirt wrong side out and dip the bosom in the hot
starch as warm as the hands can bear the heat; rub the starch
evenly through the linen, saturating it thoroughly; wring hard to
make dry as possible. Starch the collar and wristbands the same
way, then hang them out to dry. Three hours before ironing them,
wet the bosom and cuffs in cold water, wring out, shake and fold,
roll up tightly, wrap in a towel and let remain two or three
hours.
The back of the shirt should be ironed first by doubling it
lengthwise through the centre, the wristbands may be ironed next,
and both sides of the sleeves, then the collar band; now place a
bosom board under the bosom and with a fresh clean napkin dampened
a little, rub the bosom from the top toward the bottom, arranging
and smoothing each plait neatly; then with a smooth, moderately-hot
flat-iron, begin ironing from the top downward, pressing hard until
the bosom becomes smooth, dry and glossy. Remove the bosom board
and iron the front, fold both sides of the shirt towards the centre
of the back, fold together below the bosom and hang on the bars to
air.
CLEANING OIL-CLOTHS.
A dingy oil-cloth may be brightened by washing it with clear
water with a little borax dissolved in it; wipe it with a flannel
cloth that you have dipped into milk and then wring as dry as
possible.
TO CLEAN BLACK LACE. No. 1.
A teaspoonful of gum arabic dissolved in one teacupful of
boiling water; when cool, add half a teaspoonful of black ink; dip
the lace and spread smoothly between the folds of a newspaper and
press dry with book or the like. Lace shawls can be dressed over in
this way, by pinning a sheet to the carpet and stretching the shawl
upon that; or black lace can be cleaned the same as ribbon and
silk. Take an old [Pg 548]kid glove (black preferable), no
matter how old, and boil it in a pint of water for a short time;
then let it cool until the leather can be taken in the hand without
burning; use the glove to sponge off the ribbon; if the ribbon is
very dirty, dip it into water and draw through the fingers a few
times before sponging. After cleaning, lay a piece of paper over
the ribbon and iron; paper is better than cloth. The ribbon will
look like new.
TO CLEAN BLACK LACE. No. 2.
Black laces of all kinds may be cleaned by alcohol. Throw them
boldly into the liquid; churn them up and down till they foam; if
very dusty, use the second dose of alcohol; squeeze them out,
"spat" them, pull out the edges, lay them between brown paper,
smooth and straight; leave under a heavy weight till dry; do not
iron.
TO WASH WHITE LACE. No. 1.
First, the soiled laces should be carefully removed from the
garment and folded a number of times, keeping the edges evenly
together, then basted with a coarse thread without a knot in the
end. Now put them in a basin of luke-warm suds. After soaking a
half hour, rub them carefully between the hands, renewing the suds
several times; then, after soaping them well, place them in
cold water and let them come to a scald. Take them from this
and rinse them thoroughly in luke-warm water, blued a very little,
then dip them into a very thin, clear starch, allowing a
teaspoonful of starch to a pint of water, so thin that it will be
scarcely preceptible. Now roll them in a clean, fresh towel without
taking out the bastings; let them lie for an hour or more, iron
over several thicknesses of flannel, taking out the bastings of one
piece at a time, and ironing on the wrong side, with a
moderately-hot iron; the laces should be nearly dry, and the edges
and points pulled gently with the fingers into shape, before
ironing.
TO WASH WHITE THREAD LACE. No. 2.
To wash white lace, cover a bottle with linen, stitched smoothly
to fit the shape. Wind the lace about it, basting both edges to the
linen. Wash on the bottle, soaping and rinsing well, then boil in
soft water. Dry in the sun. Clip the basting threads and do not
iron. If carefully done it will look like new lace.
TO CLEAN SILKS OR RIBBONS.
Half a pint of gin, half a pound of honey, half a pound of soft
soap, one-eighth of a pint of water.
Mix the above ingredients together; then lay each breadth of
silk upon a clean kitchen table or dresser, and scrub it well on
the soiled side with the mixture. Have ready three vessels of cold
water; take each piece of silk at two corners, and dip it up and
down in each vessel, but do not wring it; and take care that each
breadth has one vessel of quite clean water for the last dip. Hang
it up dripping for a minute or two, then dab in a cloth, and iron
it quickly with a very hot iron.
Where the lace or silk is very much soiled, it is best to pass
them through a warm liquor of bullock's gall and water; rinse in
cold water; then take a small piece of glue, pour boiling water on
it, and pass the veil through it, clap it, and frame to dry.
Instead of framing, it may be fastened with drawing-pins closely
fixed upon a very clean paste, or drawing-board.
TO CLEAN BLACK DRESS SILKS.
One of the things "not generally known," at least in this
country, is the Parisian method of cleaning black silk; the
modus operandi is very simple, and the result infinitely
superior to that achieved in any other manner. The silk must be
thoroughly brushed and wiped with a cloth, then laid flat on a
board or table, and well sponged with hot coffee, thoroughly freed
from sediment by being strained through muslin. The silk is sponged
on the side intended to show; it is allowed to become partially
dry, and then ironed on the wrong side. The coffee removes every
particle of grease, and restores the brilliancy of silk, without
imparting to it either the shiny appearance or crackly and papery
stiffness obtained by beer, or, indeed, any other liquid. The silk
really appears thickened by the process, and this good effect is
permanent. Our readers who will experimentalize on an apron or
cravat, will never again try any other method.
TO WASH FEATHERS.
Wash in warm soap-suds and rinse in water a very little blued;
if the feather is white, then let the wind dry it. When the curl
has come out by washing the feather or getting it damp, place a hot
flat-iron so that you can hold the feather just above it while
curling. Take [Pg 550]a bone or silver knife, and draw the
fibres of the feather between the thumb and the dull edge of the
knife, taking not more than three fibres at a time, beginning at
the point of the feather and curling one-half the other way. The
hot iron makes the curl more durable. After a little practice one
can make them look as well as new feathers. Or they can be curled
by holding them over the stove or range, not near enough to burn;
withdraw and shake out; then hold them over again until they curl.
When swansdown becomes soiled, it can be washed and look as good as
new. Tack strips on a piece of muslin and wash in warm water with
white soap, then rinse and hang in the wind to dry. Rip from the
muslin and rub carefully between the fingers to soften the
leather.
INCOMBUSTIBLE DRESSES.
By putting an ounce of alum or sal ammoniac in the last
water in which muslins or cottons are rinsed, or a similar quantity
in the starch in which they are stiffened, they will be rendered
almost uninflammable; or, at least, will with difficulty take the
fire, and if they do, will burn without flame. It is astonishing
that this simple precaution is so rarely adopted. Remember this and
save the lives of your children.
HOW TO FRESHEN UP FURS.
Furs when taken out in the fall are often found to have a
mussed, crushed-out appearance. They can be made to look like new,
by following these simple directions: Wet the fur with a
hair-brush, brushing up the wrong way of the fur. Leave it to dry
in the air for about half an hour, and then give it a good beating
on the right side with a rattan. After beating it, comb it with a
coarse comb, combing up the right way of the fur.
NOVEL DRESS MENDING.
A novel way of mending a woolen or silk dress in which a round
hole has been torn, and where only a patch could remedy matters, is
the following: The frayed portions around the tear should be
carefully smoothed, and a piece of the material, moistened with
very thin muscilage, placed under the hole. A heavy weight should
be put upon it until it is dry, when it is only possible to
discover the mended place by careful observation.
TO RENEW OLD CRAPE.
Place a little water in a tea-kettle, and let it boil until
there is plenty of steam from the spout; then, holding the crape in
both hands, pass it to and fro several times through the steam, and
it will be clean and look nearly equal to new.
TO RAISE THE PILE ON VELVET.
To raise the pile on velvet, put on a table two pieces of wood;
place between them, bottom side up, three very hot flat-irons, and
over them lay a wet cloth; hold the velvet over the cloth, with the
wrong side down; when thoroughly steamed, brush the pile with a
light wisp, and the velvet will look as good as new.
TO CLEAN KID GLOVES.
Make a thick mucilage by boiling a handful of flax-seed; add a
little dissolved toilet soap; then, when the mixture cools, put the
gloves on the hands and rub them with a piece of white flannel wet
with the mixture. Do not wet the gloves through. Or take a fine,
clean, soft cloth, dip it into a little sweet milk, then rub it on
a cake of soap, and rub the gloves with it; they will, look like
new.
Another good way to clean any color of kid gloves is to pour a
little benzine into a basin and wash the gloves in it, rubbing and
squeezing them until clean. If much soiled, they must be washed
through clean benzine, and rinsed in a fresh supply. Hang up in the
air to dry.
STARCH POLISH.
Take one ounce of spermaceti and one ounce of white wax; melt
and run it into a thin cake on a plate. A piece the size of a
quarter dollar added to a quart of prepared starch gives a
beautiful lustre to the clothes and prevents the iron from
sticking.
FOR CLEANING JEWELRY.
For cleaning jewelry there is nothing better than ammonia and
water. If very dull or dirty, rub a little soap on a soft brush and
brush them in this wash, rinse in cold water, dry first in an old
handkerchief and then rub with buck or chamois skin. Their
freshness and brilliancy when thus cleaned cannot be surpassed by
any compound used by jewelers.
TO CLEAN SILVER PLATE.
Wash well in strong, warm soap-suds, rinse and wipe dry with a
dry soft cloth; then mix as much hartshorn powder as will be
required into a thick paste, with cold water; spread this over the
silver, with a soft cloth, and leave it for a little time to dry.
When perfectly dry brush it off with a clean soft cloth, or brush
and polish it with a piece of chamois skin. Hartshorn is one of the
best possible ingredients for plate powder for daily use. It leaves
on the silver a deep, dark polish, and at the same time does not
injure it. Whiting, dampened with liquid ammonia, is excellent
also.
TO REMOVE STAINS FROM MARBLE.
Mix together one-half pound of soda, one-half pound of soft soap
and one pound of whiting. Boil them until they become as thick as
paste, and let it cool. Before it is quite cold, spread it over the
surface of the marble and leave it at least a whole day. Use soft
water to wash it off, and rub it well with soft cloths. For a black
marble, nothing it better than spirits of turpentine.
Another paste answers the same purpose: Take two parts of soda,
one of pumice stone and one of finely-powdered chalk. Sift these
through a fine sieve and mix them into a paste with water. Rub this
well all over the marble and the stains will be removed; then wash
it with soap and water and a beautiful bright polish will be
produced.
TO WHITEN WALLS.
To whiten walls, scrape off all the old whitewash, and wash the
walls with a solution of two ounces of white vitriol to four
gallons of water. Soak a quarter of a pound of white glue in water
for twelve hours; strain and place in a tin pail in a kettle of
boiling water. When melted, stir in the glue eight pounds of
whiting and water enough to make it as thick as common whitewash.
Apply evenly with a good brush. If the walls are very yellow, blue
the water slightly by squeezing in it a flannel blue-bag.
Before kalsomining a wall all cracks should be plastered over.
Use plaster of Paris. Kalsomine may be colored easily by mixing
with it yellow ochre, Spanish brown, indigo; squeeze through a bag
into the water, etc.
PAPER-HANGERS' PASTE.
To make paper-hangers' paste, beat up four pounds of good, white
wheat flour (well sifted previously) in sufficient cold water to
form a stiff batter. Beat it well in order to take out all lumps,
and then add enough cold water to make the mixture of the
consistency of pudding batter. To this add about two ounces of
well-pounded alum. Pour gently and quickly over the batter boiling
water, stirring rapidly at the same time, and when it is seen to
lose the white color of the flour, it is cooked and ready. Do not
use it, however, while hot, but allow it to cool. Pour about a pint
of cold water over the top to prevent a skin from forming. Before
using, the paste should be thinned by the addition of cold
water.
TO WASH COLORED GARMENTS.
Delicately colored socks and stockings are apt to fade in
washing. If they are soaked for a night in a pail of tepid water
containing a half pint of turpentine, then wrung out and dried, the
colors will "set," and they can afterwards be washed without
fading.
For calicoes that fade, put a teaspoonful of sugar of lead into
a pailful of water and soak the garment fifteen minutes before
washing.
THE MARKING SYSTEM.
Mark all your own personal wardrobe which has to be washed. If
this were invariably done, a great deal of property would be saved
and a great deal of trouble would be spared. For the sake of saving
trouble to others, if for no other reason, all of one's
handkerchiefs, collars and underclothing should be plainly and
permanently marked. A bottle of indelible ink is cheap, a clean pen
still cheaper, and a bright, sunny day or a hot flat-iron will
complete the business. Always keep on hand a stick of linen tape,
written over its whole length with your name, or the names of your
family, ready to be cut off and sewed on to stockings and such
other articles as do not afford a good surface on which to
mark.
Then there are the paper patterns, of which every mother has a
store. On the outside of each, as it is tied up, the name of the
pattern should be plainly written. There are the rolls of pieces,
which may contain a good deal not apparent from the outside. All
these hidden mysteries should be indicated. The winter things,
which are [Pg 554]wrapped up and put away for summer, and the
summer things, which are wrapped up and put away for the winter,
should all be in labeled packages, and every packing trunk should
have on its lid a complete list of its contents.
TO REMOVE STAINS AND SPOTS.
Children's clothes, table linens, towels, etc., should be
thoroughly examined before wetting, as soap-suds, washing-fluids,
etc., will fix almost any stain past removal. Many stains will pass
away by being simply washed in pure, soft water; or alcohol will
remove, before the article has been in soap-suds, many stains; iron
mold, mildew, or almost any similar spot, can be taken out by
dipping in diluted citric acid; then cover with salt and lay in the
bright sun till the stain disappears. If of long standing, it may
be necessary to repeat the wetting and the sunlight. Be careful to
rinse in several waters as soon as the stain is no longer visible.
Ink, fruit, wine, and mildew stains must first be washed in clear,
cold water, removing as much of the spots as can be, then mix one
teaspoonful of oxalic acid and a half pint of rain-water. Dip the
stain in this and wipe off in clear water. Wash at once, if a
fabric that will bear washing. A tablespoonful of white currant
juice, if any can be had, is even better than lemon. This
preparation may be used on the most delicate articles without
injury. Shake it up before using it. Mark it "poison," and put it
where it will not be meddled with.
OIL STAINS IN SILKS AND OTHER FABRICS.
Benzine is most effectual, not only for silk, but for any other
material whatever. It can be procured from any druggist. By simply
covering both sides of greased silk with magnesia, and allowing it
to remain for a few hours, the oil is absorbed by the powder.
Should the first application be insufficient, it may be repeated,
and even rubbed in with the hand. Should the silk be Tussah or
Indian silk, it will wash.
To remove an acid stain on violet silk: Brush the discoloration
with tincture of iodine, then saturate the spot well with a
solution of hyposulphite of soda, and dry gradually. This restores
the original color perfectly.
Muriatic acid is successfully used for removing ink stains and
iron mold on a number of colors which it does not attack.
Sulphurous acid is only employed for whitening undyed goods,
straw hats, etc., and for removing the stains of certain fruits on
silks and woolens. Sulphurous gas is also used for this purpose,
but the liquid gas is safer.
Oxalic acid is used for removing ink and rust stains, and
remnants of mud stains, which do not yield to other deterrents. It
may also be used for destroying the stains of fruits and astringent
juices, and old stains of urine. However, its use is limited to
white goods, as it attacks fugitive colors and even light shades of
those reputed to be fast. The best method of applying it is to
dissolve it in cold or luke-warm water, to let it remain a moment
upon the spot, and then rub it with the fingers. Wash out in clear,
warm water immediately.
Citric acid serves to revive and brighten certain colors,
especially greens and yellows. It restores scarlets which have been
turned to a crimson by the action of alkalies. Acetic acid or
tartaric acid may be used instead.
Where it is feared that soap may change the color of an article,
as, for instance, scarlet hosiery or lilac print, if the garment be
not badly soiled, it may be cleansed by washing without soap in
water in which pared potatoes have been boiled. This method will
also prevent color from running in washing prints.
To prevent blue from running into a white ground, dissolve a
teaspoonful of copperas in a pailful of soft water, add a piece of
lime the size of an acorn, and soak the garments in this water two
hours before washing. To keep colors from running in washing black
prints, put a teaspoon of black pepper in the first water.
Salt or beef's gall in the water helps to set black. A
tablespoonful of spirits of turpentine to a gallon of water sets
most blues, and alum is very efficacious in setting green. Black or
very dark calicoes should be stiffened with gum arabic—five
cents' worth is enough for a dress. If, however, starch is used,
the garment should be turned wrong side out.
A simple way to remove grass stains is to spread butter on them,
and lay the article in hot sunshine, or wash in alcohol. Fruit
stains upon cloth or the hands may be removed by rubbing with the
juice of ripe tomatoes. If applied immediately, powdered starch
will also take fruit stains out of table linen. Left on the spot
for a few hours, it absorbs every trace of the stain.
For mildew stains or iron rust, mix together soft soap, laundry
starch, half as much salt, and the juice of a lemon. Apply to the
spots and spread the garment on the grass. Or wet the linen, rub
into it white soap, then finely powdered chalk; lay upon the grass
and keep damp. Old mildew stains may be removed by rubbing yellow
soap on both sides and afterwards laying on, very thick, starch
which has been dampened. Rub in well and expose to light and air.
There are several effectual methods of removing grease from cloths.
First, wet with a linen cloth dipped in chloroform. Second, mix
four tablespoonfuls of alcohol with one tablespoonful of salt;
shake together until the salt is dissolved and apply with a sponge.
Third, wet with weak ammonia water; then lay a thin white blotting
or tissue paper over it and iron lightly with an iron not too hot.
Fourth, apply a mixture of equal parts of alcohol, gin and
ammonia.
Candle grease yields to a warm iron. Place a piece of blotting
or other absorbing paper under the absorbing fabric; put a piece of
the paper also on the spot, apply the warm iron to the paper and as
soon as a spot of grease appears, move the paper and press again
until the spot disappears. Lard will remove wagon grease. Rub the
spot with the lard as if washing it, and when it is well out, wash
in the ordinary way with soap and water until thoroughly
cleansed.
To make linen beautifully white, prepare the water for washing
by putting into every ten gallons a large handful of powdered borax
or boil with the clothes one teaspoonful of spirits of
turpentine.
Fruit stains may be taken out by boiling water. Place the
material over a basin or other vessel and pour the boiling water
from the kettle over the stains.
Pure water, cold or hot, mixed with acids, serves for rinsing
goods in order to remove foreign and neutral bodies which cover the
color. Steam softens fatty matters and thus facilitates their
removal by reagents.
Sulphuric acid may be used in certain cases, particularly for
brightening and raising greens, reds, yellows, etc., but it must be
diluted with at least one hundred times its weight of water and
more in cases of delicate shades.
CEMENT FOR CHINA AND GLASS.
To half a pint of milk put an equal quantity of vinegar in order
to curdle it; then separate the curd from the whey and mix the whey
[Pg 557]with the whites of four or five eggs, beating the
whole well together. When it is well-mixed, add a little
quick-lime, through a sieve, until it has acquired the consistency
of a thick paste. With this cement broken vessels and cracks of all
kinds may be mended. It dries quickly and resists the action of
fire and water.
Another: Into a thick solution of gum arabic, stir plaster of
Paris until the mixture assumes the consistency of cream; apply
with a brush to the broken edges of china and join together. In
three days the article cannot be broken in the same place. The
whiteness of the cement adds to its value.
CLEANING SINKS.
To purify greasy sinks and pipes, pour down a pailful of boiling
water in which three or four pounds of washing soda have been
dissolved. A disinfectant is prepared in the same way, using
copperas. Copperas is a poison and should not be left about.
Leaks in Waste Pipes:—Shut yourself into a room
from which the pipe starts. Put two or three ounces of oil of
peppermint into a pail of boiling hot water and pour down the pipe.
Another person who has not yet inhaled the strong odor should
follow the course of the pipe through the house. The peppermint
will be pretty sure to discover a break that even an expert plumber
might overlook.
MANAGEMENT OF STOVES.
If the fire in a stove has plenty of fresh coals on top not yet
burned through it will need only a little shaking to start it up;
but if the fire looks dying and the coals look white, don't shake
it. When it has drawn till it is red again, if there is much ash
and little fire, put coals on very carefully. A mere handful of
fire can be coaxed back into life by adding another handful or so
of new coals on the red spot, and giving plenty of draught, but
don't shake a dying fire, or you lose it. This management is often
necessary after a warm spell, when the stove has been kept dormant
for days, though I hope you will not be so unfortunate as to have a
fire to coax up on a cold winter morning. They should be arranged
over night, so that all that is required is to open the draughts in
order to have a cherry glow in a few minutes.
TO REMOVE INK FROM CARPETS.
When freshly spilled, ink can be removed from carpets by wetting
in milk. Take cotton batting and soak up all the ink that it will
receive, being careful not to let it spread. Then take fresh
cotton, wet in milk, and sop it up carefully. Repeat this
operation, changing cotton and milk each time. After most of the
ink has been taken up in this way, with fresh cotton and clean, rub
the spot. Continue till all disappears; then wash the spot in clean
warm water and a little soap; rinse in clear water and rub till
nearly dry. If the ink is dried in, we know of no way that will not
take the color from the carpet as well as the ink, unless the ink
is on a white spot. In that case, salts of lemon, or soft soap,
starch and lemon juice, will remove the ink as easily as if on
cotton.
TO TAKE RUST OUT OF STEEL.
If possible, place the article in a bowl containing kerosene
oil, or wrap the steel up in a soft cloth well saturated with
kerosene; let it remain twenty-four hours or longer, then scour the
rusty spots with brick dust; if badly rusted, use salt wet with hot
vinegar; after scouring rinse every particle of brick dust or salt
off with boiling hot water; dry thoroughly with flannel cloths and
place near the fire to make sure, then polish off with a clean
flannel cloth and a little sweet oil.
TO MAKE A PASTE OR MUCILAGE TO FASTEN LABLES.
Soften good glue in water, then boil it with strong vinegar and
thicken the liquid, during boiling, with fine wheat flour, so that
a paste results; or starch paste with which a little Venice
turpentine has been incorporated while it was warm.
A recipe for a transparent cement which possesses great tenacity
and has not the slightest yellow tinge: Mix in a well-stoppered
bottle ten drachms of chloroform with ten and one-half of
non-vulcanized caoutchouc (rubber) cut in small pieces. Solution is
readily effected and when it is completed add two and one-half
drachms of mastic. Let the whole macerate from eight to ten days
without the application of any heat and shake the contents of the
bottle at intervals. A perfectly white and very adhesive cement is
the result.
POSTAGE STAMP MUCILAGE.
Take of gum dextrine two parts, acetic acid one part, water five
parts. Dissolve in a water bath and add alcohol one part.
Gum of great strength, which will also keep for a long time, is
prepared by dissolving equal parts of gum arabic and gum tragacanth
in vinegar. A little vinegar added to ordinary gum water will make
it keep much better.
FAMILY GLUE.
Crack the glue and put it in a bottle, add common whisky; shake
up, cork tight, and in three or four days it can be used. It
requires no heating, will keep for almost any length of time, and
is at all times, ready to use, except in the coldest of weather,
when it will require warming. It must be kept tight, so that the
whisky will not evaporate. The usual corks or stoppers should not
be used. It will become clogged. A tin stopper covering the bottle,
but fitting as closely as possible, must be used.
GLUE.
Glue to resist heat and moisture is made as
follows: Mix a handful of quick-lime in four ounces of linseed oil,
boil to a good thickness, then spread it on tin plates in the
shade, and it will become very hard, but may be easily dissolved
over the fire as glue.
A glue which will resist the action of water is made by boiling
one pound of common glue in two quarts of skimmed milk.
FURNITURE CREAM.
Shred finely two ounces of beeswax and half an ounce of white
wax into half a pint of turpentine; set in a warm place until
dissolved, then pour over the mixture the following, boiled
together until melted: Half a pint of water, an ounce of castile
soap and a piece or resin the size of a small nutmeg. Mix
thoroughly and keep in a wide-necked stone bottle for use. This
cleans well and leaves a good polish, and may be made at a fourth
of the price it is sold at.
CEMENT CRACKS IN FLOOR.
Cracks in floors may be neatly but permanently filled by
thoroughly soaking newspapers in paste made of half a pound of
flour, [Pg 560]three quarts of water and half a pound of alum mixed
and boiled. The mixture will be about as thick as putty, and may be
forced into the crevice with a case knife. It will harden like
papier-mache.
A POLISH FOR LADIES' KID SHOES.
A fine liquid polish for ladies' kid shoes, satchels, etc., that
is easy of application, recommended as containing no ingredients in
any manner injurious to leather, is found by digesting in a closed
vessel at gentle heat, and straining, a solution made as follows:
Lampblack one drachm, oil turpentine four drachms, alcohol
(trymethyl) twelve ounces, shellac one and one-half ounces, white
turpentine five drachms, saudarac two drachms.
PASTE FOR SCRAP BOOKS, ETC.
Paste that Will Keep.—Dissolve a teaspoonful of
alum in a quart of water. When cold, stir in flour, to give it the
consistency of thick cream, being particular to beat up all the
lumps. Stir in as much powdered resin as will lie on a dime, and
throw in half a dozen cloves to give it a pleasant odor. Have on
the fire a teacupful of boiling water; pour the flour mixture into
it, stirring well all the time. In a few minutes it will be of the
consistency of molasses. Pour it into an earthen or china vessel,
let it cool, and stir in a small teaspoonful each of oil of cloves
and of sassafras; lay a cover on, and put in a cool place. When
needed for use, take out a portion and soften it with warm water.
This is a fine paste to use to stiffen embroidery.
TO REMOVE INDELIBLE INK.
Most indelible inks contain nitrate of silver, the stain of
which may be removed by first soaking in a solution of common salt,
and afterward washing with ammonia. Or use solution of ten grains
of cyanide of potassium and five grains of iodine to one ounce of
water, or a solution of eight parts each bichloride of mercury and
chloride of ammonium in one hundred and twenty-five parts of
water.
A CEMENT FOR ACIDS.
A cement which is proof against boiling acids may be made by a
composition of India rubber, tallow, lime and red lead. The India
rubber must first be melted by a gentle heat, and then six to eight
[Pg 561]per cent by weight of tallow is added to the mixture
while it is kept well stirred; next day slaked lime is applied,
until the fluid mass assumes a consistency similar to that of soft
paste; lastly, twenty per cent of red lead is added in order to
make it harden and dry.
TO KEEP CIDER.
Allow three-fourths of a pound of sugar to the gallon, the
whites of six eggs, well beaten, a handful of common salt. Leave it
open until fermentation ceases, then bung up. This process a dealer
of cider has used for years, and always successfully.
Another Recipe.—To keep cider sweet allow it to
work until it has reached the state most desirable to the taste,
and then add one and a half tumblers of grated horse-radish to each
barrel, and shake up well. This arrests further fermentation. After
remaining a few weeks, rack off and bung up closely in clean
casks.
A gentleman of Denver writes he has a sure preservative: Put
eight gallons of cider at a time into a clean barrel; take one
ounce of powdered charcoal and one ounce of powdered sulphur; mix
and put it into some iron vessel that will go down through the
bung-hole of the barrel. Now put a piece of red-hot iron into the
charcoal and sulphur, and while it is burning, lower it through the
bung-hole to within one foot of the cider, and suspend it there by
a piece of wire. Bring it up and in twelve hours you can cure
another batch. Put the cider in a tight barrel and keep in a cool
cellar and it will keep for years.
A Holland Recipe.—To one quart of new milk, fresh
from the cow (not strained), add one half pound of ground black
mustard seed and six eggs. Beat the whole well together and pour
into a barrel of cider. It will keep cider sweet for one year or
more.
TO BLEACH COTTON CLOTH.
Take one large spoonful of sal soda and one pound of chloride
lime for thirty yards; dissolve in clean, soft water; rinse the
cloth thoroughly in cold, soft water so that it may not rot. This
amount of cloth may be bleached in fourteen or fifteen minutes.
A POLISH FOR LEATHER.
Put a half-pound of shellac broken up in small pieces into a
quart bottle or jug, cover it with alcohol, cork it tight, and put
it on the shelf [Pg 562]in a warm place; shake it well several
times a day, then add a piece of camphor as large as a hen's egg;
shake it well, and in a few hours shake it again and add one ounce
of lampblack. If the alcohol is good, it will all be dissolved in
two days; then shake and use. If the materials were of the proper
kind, the polish correctly prepared, it will dry in about five
minutes, giving a gloss equal to patent leather. Using aniline dyes
instead of the lampblack, you can have it any desired color, and it
can be used on wood or hard paper.
TO SOFTEN WATER.
Add half a pound of the best quick-lime dissolved in water to
every hundred gallons. Smaller proportions may be more conveniently
managed, and if allowed to stand a short time the lime will have
united with the carbonate of lime, and been deposited at the bottom
of the receptacle. Another way is to put a gallon of lye into a
barrelful of water, or two or three shovelfuls of wood-ashes, let
stand over night; it will be clear and soft.
WASHING FLUID.
One gallon of water and four pounds of ordinary washing soda,
and a quarter of a pound of soda. Heat the water to boiling hot,
put in the soda, boil about five minutes, then pour it over two
pounds of unslaked lime, let it bubble and foam until it settles,
turn it off and bottle it for use. This is the article that is used
in the Chinese laundries for whitening their linen, and is called
"Javelle water;" a tablespoonful put into a suds of three gallons,
and a little, say a quarter of a cupful, in the boiler when boiling
the clothes, makes them very white and clear. Must be well rinsed
afterwards. This preparation will remove tea stains and almost all
ordinary stains of fruit, grass, etc. This fluid brightens the
colors of colored clothes, does not rot them, but should not be
left long in any water; the boiling, sudsing, rinsing and
bluing, should be done in quick succession, until the clothes are
ready to hang on the line.
HARD SOAP. (Washing.)
Six pounds of washing soda and three of unslaked lime. Pour on
four gallons of boiling water, let it stand until perfectly clear,
then drain off, and put in six pounds of clean fat. Boil it until
it begins [Pg 563]to harden, about two hours, stirring most of the
time. While boiling, thin it with two gallons of cold water, which
you have previously poured on the alkaline mixture, after draining
off the four gallons. This must be settled clear before it is drawn
off. Add it when there is danger of boiling over. Try the thickness
by cooling a little on a plate. Put in a handful of salt just
before taking from the fire. Wet a tub to prevent sticking; turn in
the soap and let it stand until solid. Cut into bars, put on a
board and let it dry. This makes about forty pounds of soap. It can
be flavored just as you turn it out.
SOAP FOR WASHING WITHOUT RUBBING.
A soap to clean clothes without rubbing: Take two pounds of sal
soda, two pounds of common bar soap and ten quarts of water. Cut
the soap in thin slices and boil together two hours; strain and it
will be fit for use. Put the clothes in soak the night before you
wash, and to every pailful of water in which you boil them add a
pound of soap. They will need no rubbing, but merely rinsing.
TO MAKE SOFT SOAP WITHOUT COOKING.
Pour two pailfuls of boiling water upon twenty pounds of potash
and let it stand two hours. Have ready thirty pounds of clean
grease, upon which pour one pailful of the lye, adding another pail
of water to the potash; let it stand three or four hours, stir it
well; then pour a gallon of the lye upon the grease, stir it well;
and in half an hour another gallon of the lye, stir it thoroughly;
in half an hour repeat the process, and thus proceed until you have
poured off all the lye; then add two pails of boiling hot water to
the remainder of the potash, and let it stand ten hours; then stir
the mixture, and if it has become stiff and the grease has
disappeared from the surface, take out a little and see whether the
weak lye will thicken it; if it does, add the lye; if it does not,
try water, and if that thickens it, let it stand another day,
stirring it well five or six times during the day; if the lye does
not separate from the grease you may fill up with water.
OLD-STYLE FAMILY SOFT SOAP.
To set the leach, bore several holes in the bottom of a
barrel, or use one without a bottom; prepare a board larger than
the barrel, [Pg 564]then set the barrel on it, and cut a groove
around just outside the barrel, making one groove from this to the
edge of the board, to carry off the lye as it runs off, with a
groove around it, running into one in the centre of the board.
Place all two feet from the ground and tip it so that the lye may
run easily from the board into the vessel below prepared to receive
it. Put half bricks or stones around the edge of the inside of the
barrel; place on them one end of some sticks about two inches wide,
inclining to the centre; on those place some straw to the depth of
two inches, over it scatter two pounds of slaked lime. Put in
ashes, about half of a bushel at a time, pack it well, by pounding
it down, and continue doing so until the barrel is full, leaving a
funnel-shaped hollow in the centre large enough to hold several
quarts of water. Use rain-water boiling hot. Let the water
disappear before adding more. If the ashes are packed very
tightly it may require two or three days before the lye will
begin to run, but it will be the stronger for it, and much
better.
To Make Boiled Soft Soap.—Put in a kettle the
grease consisting of all kinds of fat that has accumulated in the
kitchen, such as scraps and bones from the soup-kettle, rinds from
meat, etc.; fill the kettle half full; if there is too much grease
it can be skimmed off after the soap is cold, for another kettle of
soap. This is the only true test when enough grease is used, as the
lye will consume all that is needed and no more. Make a fire under
one side of it. The kettle should be in an out-house or out of
doors. Let it heat very hot so as to fry; stir occasionally to
prevent burning. Now put in the lye a gallon at a time, watching it
closely until it boils, as it sometimes runs over at the beginning.
Add lye until the kettle is full enough, but not too full to
boil well. Soap should boil from the side and not the
middle, as this would be more likely to cause it to boil over. To
test the soap, to one spoonful of soap add one of rain-water; if it
stirs up very thick, the soap is good and will keep; if it becomes
thinner, it is not good. This is the result of one of three causes,
either it is too weak, or there is a deposit of dirt or it is too
strong. Continue to boil for a few hours, when it should flow from
the stick with which it is stirred like thick molasses; but if
after boiling it remains thin, let it stand over night, removing it
from the fire, then drain it off very [Pg
565]carefully into
another vessel, being very particular to prevent any sediment from
passing. Wash the kettle, return the soap and boil again, if dirt
was the cause; it will now be thick and good; otherwise if it was
too strong, rain-water added will make it right, adding the
water gradually until right and just thick enough.
An Agreeable Disinfectant:—Sprinkle fresh ground
coffee on a shovel of hot coals, or burn sugar on hot coals.
Vinegar boiled with myrrh, sprinkled on the floor and furniture of
a sick room, is an excellent deodorizer.
To Prevent Mold:—A small quantity of carbolic acid
added to paste, mucilage and ink, will prevent mold. An ounce of
the acid to a gallon of whitewash will keep cellars and dairies
from the disagreeable odor which often taints milk and meat kept in
such places.
To Make Tracing-Paper:—Dissolve a ball of white
beeswax, one inch in diameter, in half a pint of turpentine.
Saturate the paper in this bath and let it dry two or three days
before using.
To Preserve Brooms:—Dip them for a minute or two in
a kettle of boiling suds once a week and they will last much
longer, making them tough and pliable. A carpet wears much longer
swept with a broom cared for in this manner.
To Clean Brass-Ware, etc.:—Mix one ounce of oxalic
acid, six ounces of rotten stone, all in powder, one ounce of sweet
oil, and sufficient water to make a paste. Apply a small portion,
and rub dry with a flannel or leather. The liquid dip most
generally used consists of nitric and sulphuric acids; but this is
more corrosive.
Polish or Enamel for Shirt Bosoms is made by melting
together one ounce of white wax, and two ounces of spermaceti; heat
gently and turn into a very shallow pan; when cold cut or break in
pieces. When making boiled starch the usual way, enough for a dozen
bosoms, add to it a piece of the polish the size of a hazel
nut.
An Erasive Fluid for the Removal of Spots on Furniture,
and all kinds of fabrics, without injuring the color, is made of
four ounces of aqua ammonia, one ounce of glycerine, one ounce of
castile soap and [Pg 567]one of spirits of wine. Dissolve the
soap in two quarts of soft water, add the other ingredients. Apply
with a soft sponge and rub out. Very good for deaning silks.
To Remove the Odor of Onion from fish-kettle and
saucepans in which they have been cooked, put wood-ashes or sal
soda, potash or lye; fill with water and let it stand on the stove
until it boils; then wash in hot suds, and rinse well.
To Clean Marble Busts:—First free them from all
dust, then wash them with very weak hydrochloric acid. Soap injures
the color of marble.
To Remove old Putty from Window Frames, pass a red hot
poker slowly over it and it will come off easily.
Hanging Pictures:—The most safe material and also
the best, is copper wire, of the size proportioned to the weight of
the picture. When hung the wire is scarcely visible, and its
strength is far superior to cord.
To Keep Milk Sweet:—Put into a panful a spoonful of
grated horse-radish, it will keep it sweet for days.
To Take Rust from Steel Implements or Knives:—Rub
them well with kerosene oil, leaving them covered with it a day or
so; then rub them hard and well with finely powdered unslaked
lime.
Poison Water:—Water boiled in galvanized iron
becomes poisonous, and cold water passed through zinc-lined iron
pipes should never be used for cooking or drinking. Hot water for
cooking should never be taken from hot water pipes; keep a supply
heated in kettles.
Scouring Soap for Cotton and Silk Goods:—Mix one
pound of common soap, half a pound of beef-gall and one ounce and a
half of Venetian turpentine.
A Paint for Wood or Stone that Resists all
Moisture:—Melt twelve ounces of resin; mix with it,
thoroughly, six gallons of fish oil and one pound of melted
sulphur. Rub up some ochre or any other coloring substance with a
little linseed oil, enough to give it the right, color and
thickness. Apply several coats of the hot composition with a brush.
The first coat should be very thin.
To Ventilate a Room:—Place a pitcher of cold water
on a table in your room and it will absorb all the gases with which
the room is filled from the [Pg
568]respiration of
those eating or sleeping in the apartment. Very few realize how
important such purification is for the health of the family, or,
indeed, understand or realize that there can be any impurity in the
rooms; yet in a few hours a pitcher or pail of cold water—the
colder the more effective—will make the air of a room pure,
but the water will be entirely unfit for use.
To Fill Cracks in Plaster:—Use vinegar instead of
water to mix your plaster of Paris. The resultant mass will be like
putty, and will not "set" for twenty or thirty minutes; whereas, if
you use water the plaster will become hard almost immediately,
before you have time to use it. Push it into the cracks and smooth
it off nicely with a table knife.
To Take Spots from Wash Goods:—Rub them with the
yolk of egg before washing.
To Take White Spots from Varnished Furniture:—Hold
a hot stove lid or plate over them and they will soon
disappear.
To Prevent Oil from Becoming Rancid:—Drop a few
drops of ether into the bottle containing it.
Troublesome Ants:—A heavy chalk mark laid a
finger's distance from your sugar box and all around (there must be
no space not covered) will surely prevent ants from troubling.
To Make Tough Meat Tender:—Lay it a few minutes in
a strong vinegar water.
To Remove Discoloration from Bruises:—Apply a cloth
wrung out in very hot water, and renew frequently until the pain
ceases. Or apply raw beefsteak.
A Good Polish for Removing Stains, Spots and Mildew from
Furniture is made as follows: Take half a pint of ninety-eight
per cent, alcohol, a quarter of an ounce each of pulverized resin
and gum shellac, add half a pint of linseed oil; shake well and
apply with a brush or sponge.
To Remove Finger-Marks:—Sweet oil will remove
finger-marks from varnished furniture, and kerosene from oiled
furniture.
To Remove Paint from Black Silk:—Patient rubbing
with chloroform will remove paint from black silk or any other
goods, and will not hurt the most delicate color or fabric.
To Freshen Gilt Frames:—Gilt frames may be revived
by carefully dusting them, and then washing with one ounce of soda
beaten up with the whites of three eggs. Scraped patches might be
touched tip with any gold paint. Castile soap and water, with
proper care, may be used to clean oil paintings; other methods
should not be employed without some skill.
To Destroy Moths in Furniture:—All the baking and
steaming are useless, as, although the moths may be killed, their
eggs are sure to hatch, and the upholstery to be well riddled. The
naphtha-bath process is effectual. A sofa, chair or lounge may be
immersed in the large vats used for the purpose, and all insect
life will be absolutely destroyed. No egg ever hatches after
passing through the naphtha-bath; all oil, dirt or grease
disappears, and not the slightest damage is done to the most costly
article. Sponging with naphtha will not answer. It is the immersion
for two hours or more in the specially prepared vats which is
effectual.
Slicing Pineapples:—The knife used for peeling a
pineapple should not be used for slicing it, as the rind contains
an acid that is apt to cause a swollen mouth and sore lips. The
Cubans use salt as an antidote for the ill effects of the peel.
To Clean Iron Sinks:—Rub them well with a cloth wet
with kerosene oil.
To Erase Discoloration on Stone China:—Dishes and
cups that are used for baking custards, puddings, etc., that
require scouring, may be easily cleaned by rubbing with a damp
cloth dipped in whiting or "Sapolio," then washed as usual.
To Remove Ink, Wine or Fruit Stains:—Saturate well
in tomato juice; it is also an excellent thing to remove stains
from the hands.
To Set Colors in Washable Goods:—Soak them previous
to washing in a water in which is allowed a tablespoonful of
ox-gall to a gallon of water.
To Take out Paint:—Equal parts of ammonia and
turpentine will take paint out of clothing, no matter how dry or
hard it may be. Saturate the spot two or three times, then wash out
in soap-suds. Ten cents' worth of oxalic acid dissolved in a pint
of hot water will remove paint spots from the windows. Pour a
little into a cup, and apply to [Pg
570]the spots with a
swab, but be sure not to allow the acid to touch the hands. Brasses
may be quickly cleaned with it. Great care must be exercised in
labeling the bottle, and putting it out of the reach of children,
as it is a deadly poison.
To Remove Tar from Cloth:—Saturate the spot and rub
it well with turpentine, and every trace of tar will be
removed.
To Destroy Ants:—Ants that frequent houses or
gardens may be destroyed by taking flour of brimstone half a pound,
and potash four ounces; set them in an iron or earthen pan over the
fire until dissolved and united; afterwards beat them to a powder,
and infuse a little of this powder in water, and wherever you
sprinkle it the ants will fly the place.
Simple Disinfectant:—The following is a refreshing
disinfectant for a sick room, or any room that has an unpleasant
aroma prevading it: Put some fresh ground coffee in a saucer, and
in the centre place a small piece of camphor gum, which light with
a match. As the gum burns, allow sufficient coffee to consume with
it. The perfume is very pleasant and healthful, being far superior
to pastiles, and very much cheaper.
Cure for Hiccough:—Sit erect and inflate the lungs
fully. Then, retaining the breath, bend forward slowly until the
chest meets the knees. After slowly arising again to the erect
position, slowly exhale the breath. Repeat this process a second
time, and the nerves will be found to have received an access of
energy that will enable them to perform their natural
functions.
To Keep out Mosquitoes and Bats:—If a bottle of the
oil of pennyroyal is left uncorked in a room at night, not a
mosquito, nor any other blood-sucker, will be found there in the
morning. Mix potash with powdered meal, and throw it into the
rat-holes of a cellar, and the rats will depart. If a rat or a
mouse get into your pantry, stuff into its hole a rag saturated
with a solution of cayenne pepper, and no rat or mouse will touch
the rag for the purpose of opening communication with a depot of
supplies.
Salt will Curdle New Milk; hence, in preparing porridge,
gravies, etc., the salt should not be added until the dish is
prepared.
To Prevent Rust on Flat-Irons:—Beeswax and salt
will make your rusty flat-irons as smooth and clean as glass. Tie a
lump of wax in [Pg 571]a rag and keep it for that purpose.
When the irons are hot, rub them first with the wax rag, then scour
with a paper or cloth sprinkled with salt.
To Prevent Rust on Knives:—Steel knives which are
not in general use may be kept from rusting if they are dipped in a
strong solution of soda: one part water to four of soda; then wipe
dry, roll in flannel and keep in a dry place.
Flowers May be Kept Very Fresh over Night if they are
excluded from the air. To do this, wet them thoroughly, put in a
damp box, and cover with wet raw cotton or wet newspaper, then
place in a cool spot.
To Sweeten Milk:—Milk which is slightly turned or
changed may be sweetened and rendered fit for use again by stirring
in a little soda.
To Scour Knives Easily:—Mix a small quantity of
baking soda with your brick-dust and see if your knives do not
polish better.
To Soften Boots and Shoes:—Kerosene will soften
boots and shoes which have been hardened by water, and render them
as pliable as new. Kerosine will make tin kettles as bright as new.
Saturate a woolen rag and rub with it. It will also remove stains
from clean varnished furniture.
Faded Goods:—Plush goods and all articles dyed with
aniline colors, which have faded from exposure to the light, will
look as bright as new after sponging with chloroform.
Choking:—A piece of food lodged in the throat may
sometimes be pushed down with the finger, or removed with a
hair-pin quickly straightened and hooked at the end, or by two or
three vigorous blows on the back between the shoulders.
To Prevent Mold on the Top of Glasses of Jelly, lay a
lump of paraffine on the top of the hot jelly, letting it melt and
spread over it. No brandy paper and no other covering is necessary.
If preferred the paraffine can be melted and poured over after the
jelly is cold.
To Preserve Ribbons and Silks:—Ribbons and silks
should be put away for preservation in brown paper; the chloride of
lime in white paper discolors them. A white satin dress should be
pinned up in blue paper with brown paper outside sewn together at
the edges.
To Preserve Bouquets:—Put a little saltpetre in the
water you use for your bouquets and the flowers will live for a
fortnight.
To Destroy Cockroaches:—Hellebore sprinkled on the
floor at night. They eat it and are poisoned.
To Remove Iron Rust:—Lemon juice and salt will
remove ordinary iron rust. If the hands are stained there is
nothing that will remove the stains as well as lemon. Cut a lemon
in halves and apply the cut surface as if it were soap.
To Keep Bar Soap:—Cut it into pieces and put it
into a dry place; it is more economical to use after it has become
hard, as it does not waste so readily.
To Brighten Carpets:—Carpets after the dust has
been beaten out may be brightened by scattering upon them corn meal
mixed with salt and then sweeping it off. Mix salt and meal in
equal proportions. Carpets should be thoroughly beaten on the wrong
side first and then on the right side, after which spots may be
removed by the use of ox-gall or ammonia and water.
Silver Tea and Coffeepot:—When putting away those
not in use every day lay a little stick across the top under the
cover. This will allow fresh air to get in and prevent the
mustiness of the contents, familiar to hotel and boarding-house
sufferers.
To Prevent Creaking of Bedsteads:—If a bedstead
creaks at each movement of the sleeper, remove the slats, and wrap
the ends of each in old newspapers.
To Clean Unvarnished Black Walnut:—Milk, sour or
sweet, well rubbed in with an old soft flannel, will make black
walnut look new.
To Prevent Cracking of Bottles and Fruit Jars:—If a
bottle or fruit-jar that has been more than once used is placed on
a towel thoroughly soaked in hot water, there is little danger of
its being cracked by the introduction of a hot liquid.
To Prevent Lamp-wicks from Smoking:—Soak them in
vinegar and then dry them thoroughly.
Rub the nickel stove-trimmings and the plated handles and hinges
of doors with kerosene and whiting, and polish with a dry
cloth.
Death to Bugs:—Varnish is death to the most
persistent bug. It is cheap—ten cents' worth will do for one
bedstead—is easily used, is safe, and improves the looks of
the furniture to which it is applied. The application, must,
however, be thorough, the slats, sides, and every crack and corner
receiving attention.
That salt should be eaten with nuts to aid digestion.
That milk which stands too long makes bitter butter.
To Clean Drain Pipes:—Drain pipes, and all places
that are sour or impure, may be cleaned with lime-water or carbolic
acid.
If oil-cloth be occasionally rubbed with a mixture of beeswax
and turpentine, it will last longer.
To Remove Mildew from Cloth:—Put a teaspoonful of
chloride of lime into a quart of water, strain it twice, then dip
the mildewed places in this weak solution; lay in the sun; if the
mildew has not disappeared when dry, repeat the operation. Also
soaking the article in sour milk and salt; then lay in the sun;
repeat until all the mildew is out.
To Take Ink out of Linen:—Dip the ink spot in pure
melted tallow, then wash out the tallow and the ink will come out
with it. This is said to be unfailing. Milk will remove ink from
linen or colored muslins, when acids would be ruinous, by soaking
the goods until the spot is very faint and then rubbing and rinsing
in cold water.
Ink spots on floors can be extracted by scouring with sand wet
in oil of vitriol and water. When ink is removed, rinse with strong
pearl-ash water.
To Toughen Lamp Chimneys and Glass-ware:—Immerse
the article in a pot filled with cold water, to which some common
salt has been added. Boil the water well, then cool slowly. Glass
treated in this way will resist any sudden change of
temperature.
To Remove Paint from Window-glass:—Rub it well with
hot sharp vinegar.
To Clean Stove-pipe:—A piece of zinc put on the
live coals in the stove will clean out the stove-pipe.
Packing Bottles:—India-rubber bands slipped over
them will prevent breakage.
To Clean Ivory Ornaments:—When ivory ornaments
become yellow or dusky, wash them well in soap and water with a
small brush, to clean the carvings, and then place them, while wet,
in the sunshine. Wet them with soapy water for two or three days,
several times a day, still keeping them in the sunshine, then wash
them again, and they will be perfectly white.
Stained Brass:—Whiting wet with aqua ammonia, will
cleanse brass from stains, and is excellent for polishing faucets
and door-knobs of brass or silver. "Sapolio" is still better.
Hartshorn applied to the stings of poisonous insects will
allay the pain and stop the swelling; or apply oil of sassafras,
which is better. Bee stings should be treated in this way.
For Cleaning Glass Bottles:—Crush egg-shells into
small bits, or a few carpet tacks, or a small quantity of gunshot,
put into the bottle; then fill one-half full of strong soap-suds;
shake thoroughly, then rinse in clear water. Will look like
new.
Cutting off Glass Bottles for Clips and Jars:—A
simple, practical way is to take a red-hot poker with a pointed
end; make a mark with a file to begin the cut; then apply the hot
iron and a crack will start, which will follow the iron wherever it
is carried. This is, on the whole, simple, and better than the use
of strings wet with turpentine, etc.
Cistern Water may be Purified by charcoal put in a bag
and hung in the water.
Salt will Remove the Stain from Silver caused by eggs,
when applied dry with a soft cloth.
Opened Fruit, Fish or Vegetables:—Never allow
opened fruit, fish or vegetables to stand in the tin can. Never
stir anything in tin, or, if it is done, use a wooden spoon. In
lifting pies or cakes from bright tin pans, use great caution that
the knife does not scrape off flecks of bright metal.
Never use water which has stood in a lead pipe over night.
Not less than a wooden bucketful should be allowed to
run.
Never use water from a stone reservoir for cooking purposes.
Never allow fresh meat to remain in paper; it absorbs the
juices.
Never keep vinegar or yeast in stone crocks or jugs; their acid
attacks the glazing, which is said to be poisonous. Glass for
either is better.
Squeaking Doors ought to have the hinges oiled by putting
on a drop from the sewing machine oil-can.
Plate Glass and Mirrors:—A soft cloth wet in
alcohol, is excellent to wipe off plate glass and mirrors, and
prevents their becoming frosty in winter.
A red-hot iron will soften old putty so that it can be easily
removed.
To Test Nutmegs:—Prick them with a pin; if good,
the oil will instantly spread around the puncture.
A Good Way to Clean Mica in a stove that has become
blackened with smoke, is to take it out, and thoroughly wash it
with vinegar. If the black does not come off at once, let it soak a
little.
To Banish Rats from the Premises, use pounded glass mixed
with dry corn meal, placed within their reach. Sprinkling cayenne
pepper in their holes will also banish them. Chloride of lime is an
infallible remedy, spread around where they come, and thrown into
their holes; it should be renewed once in two weeks. Tar is also a
good remedy.
To Prevent the Odor of Boiling Ham or
Cabbage:—Throw red pepper pods or a few bits of charcoal
into the pan they are cooking in.
To Brighten Gilt Frames:—Take sufficient flour of
sulphur to give a golden tinge to about one and one-half pints of
water, and in this boil four or five bruised onions, or garlic,
which will answer the same purpose. Strain off the liquid, and with
it, when cold, wash with a soft brush any gilding which requires
restoring, and when dry, it will come out as bright as new
work.
All cooking utensils, including iron-ware, should be washed
outside and inside in hot, soapy water; rinsed in clean, hot water,
wiped dry with a dry towel; a soapy or greasy dish-cloth should
never be used for the purpose.
A cake of sapolio should be kept in every kitchen, to be used
freely on all dishes that require scouring and cleansing. All tins
that have become discolored can be made as bright and clean as new
by the use of sapolio; also shines dishes; and, in fact, almost all
articles that require any scouring. Purchased at all groceries. One
of the most useful articles ever used in the kitchen.
COLOGNE WATER. (Superior.)
Oil of lavender two drachms, oil of rosemary one drachm and a
half, orange, lemon and bergamot, one drachm each of the oil; also
two drachms of the essence of musk, attar of rose ten drops, and a
pint of proof spirit. Shake all together thoroughly three times a
day for a week.
JOCKEY CLUB BOUQUET.
Mix one pint extract of rose, one pint extract of tuberose, half
a pint of extract of cassia, four ounces extract of jasmine, and
three ounces tincture of civet. Filter the mixture.
ROSE-WATER.
Preferable to the distilled for a perfume, or for culinary
purposes. Attar of rose, twelve drops; rub it up with half an ounce
of white sugar and two drachms carbonate magnesia; then add
gradually one quart of water and two ounces of proof spirit, and
filter through paper.
BAY RUM.
French proof spirit one gallon, extract bay six ounces. Mix and
color with caramel; needs no filtering.
LAVENDER WATER.
Oil of lavender two ounces, orris root half an ounce, spirits of
wine one pint. Mix and keep two or three weeks. It may then be
strained through two thicknesses of blotting-paper and is ready for
use.
CREAM OF LILIES.
Best white castor oil; pour in a little strong solution of sal
tartar in water, and shake it until it looks thick and white.
Perfume with lavender.
CREAM OF ROSES.
Olive oil one pound, attar of roses fifty drops, oil of rosemary
twenty-five drops; mix, and color it with alkanet root.
COLD CREAM.
Melt one ounce oil of almonds, half ounce spermaceti, one drachm
white wax, and then add two ounces of rose-water, and stir it
constantly until cold.
LIP-SALVE.
Melt one ounce white wax, one ounce sweet oil, one drachm
spermaceti, and throw in a piece of alkanet root to color it, and
when cooling, perfume it with oil rose, and then pour it into small
white jars or boxes.
FOR DANDRUFF.
Take glycerine four ounces, tincture of cantharides five ounces,
bay rum four ounces, water two ounces. Mix, and apply once a day
and rub well down the scalp.
HAIR INVIGORATOR.
Bay rum two pints, alcohol one pint, castor oil one ounce, carb.
ammonia half an ounce, tincture of cantharides one ounce. Mix them
well. This compound will promote the growth of the hair and prevent
it from falling out.
MACASSAR OIL FOR THE HAIR.
Renowned for the past fifty years, is as follows: Take a quarter
of an ounce of the chippings of alkanet root, tie this in a bit of
coarse muslin and put it in a bottle containing eight ounces of
sweet oil; cover it to keep out the dust; let it stand several
days; add to this sixty drops of tincture of cantharides, ten drops
of oil of rose, neroli and lemon each sixty drops; let it stand one
week and you will have one of the most powerful stimulants for the
growth of the hair ever known.
Another:—To a pint of strong sage tea, a pint of
bay rum and a quarter of an ounce of the tincture of cantharides,
add an ounce of castor oil and a teaspoonful of rose, or other
perfume. Shake well before applying to the hair, as the oil will
not mix.
PHALON'S INSTANTANEOUS HAIR DYE.
To one ounce of crystallized nitrate of silver, dissolved in one
ounce of concentrated aqua ammonia, add one ounce of gum arabic and
six ounces of soft water. Keep in the dark. Remember to remove all
grease from the hair before applying the dye.
There is danger in some of the patent hair dyes, and hence the
Scientific American offers what is known as the walnut hair
dye. The simplest form is the expressed juice of the bark or shell
of green walnuts. To preserve the juice a little alcohol is
commonly added to it with a few bruised cloves, and the whole
digested together, with occasional agitation, for a week or
fortnight, when the clear portion is decanted, and, if necessary,
filtered. Sometimes a little common salt is added with the same
intention. It should be kept in a cool place. The most convenient
way of application is by means of a sponge.
DYE FOR WHITE OR LIGHT EYEBROWS.
Boil an ounce of walnut bark in a pint of water for an hour. Add
a lump of alum the size of a filbert, and when cold, apply with a
camel's-hair brush.
HAIR WASH.
One penny's worth of borax, half a pint of olive oil, one pint
of boiling water.
Pour the boiling water over the borax and oil; let it cool; then
put the mixture into a bottle. Shake it before using, and apply it
with a flannel. Camphor and borax, dissolved in boiling water and
left to cool, make a very good wash for the hair; as also does
rosemary water mixed with a little borax. After using any of these
washes, when the hair becomes thoroughly dry, a little pomatum or
oil should be rubbed in to make it smooth and glossy—that is,
if one prefers oil on the hair.
OXMARROW-POMADE FOR THE HAIR.
One marrow bone, half a pint of oil, ten cents' worth of
citronella. Take the marrow out of the bone, place it in warm
water, let it get almost to boiling point, then let it cool and
pour the water away; repeat [Pg
580]this three times
until the marrow is thoroughly "fined." Beat the marrow to a cream
with a silver fork, stir the oil in, drop by drop, beating all the
time; when quite cold add the citronella, pour into jars and cover
down.
TO INCREASE THE HAIR IN THE BROWS.
Clip them and anoint with a, little sweet oil. Should the hair
fall out, having been full, use one of the hair invigorators.
BANDOLINE.
To one quart of rose-water add an ounce and a half of gum
tragacanth; let it stand forty-eight hours, frequently straining
it, then strain through a coarse linen cloth; let it stand two
days, and again strain; add to it a drachm of oil of roses. Used by
ladies dressing their hair, to make it lie in any position.
COMPLEXION WASH.
Put in a vial one drachm of benzoin gum in powder, one drachm
nutmeg oil, six drops of orange-blossom tea, or apple blossoms put
in half pint of rain-water and boiled down to one teaspoonful and
strained, one pint of sherry wine. Bathe the face morning and
night; will remove all flesh-worms and freckles, and give a
beautiful complexion. Or, put one ounce of powdered gum of benzoin
in a pint of whisky; to use, put in water in wash-bowl till it is
milky, allowing it to dry without wiping. This is perfectly
harmless.
Cream cures sun-burn on some complexions, lemon juice is best on
others, and cold water suits still others best.
BURNET'S CELEBRATED POWDER FOR THE FACE.
Five cents' worth of bay rum, five cents' worth of magnesia
snowflake, five cents' worth of bergamot, five cents' worth of oil
of lemon; mix in a pint bottle and fill up with rain-water. Shake
well, and apply with a soft sponge or cloth.
TOILET OR FACE POWDER.
Take a quarter of a pound of wheat starch pounded fine; sift it
through a fine sieve, or a piece of lace; add to it eight drops of
oil of [Pg 581]rose, oil of lemon thirty drops, oil of bergamot
fifteen drops. Rub thoroughly together.
The French throw this powder into alcohol, shaking it, letting
it settle, then pouring off the alcohol and drying the powder. In
that case, the perfume is added lastly.
TO REMOVE FRECKLES.
The following lotion is highly recommended: One ounce of lemon
juice, a quarter of a drachm of powdered borax, and half a drachm
of sugar; mix in a bottle, and allow them to stand a few days, when
the liquor should be rubbed occasionally on the hands and face.
Another application is: Friar's balsam one part, rose-water twenty
parts.
Powdered nitre moistened with water and applied to the face
night and morning, is said to remove freckles without injury to the
skin.
Also, a tablespoonful of freshly grated horse-radish, stirred
into a cupful of sour milk; let it stand for twelve hours, then
strain and apply often. This bleaches the complexion also, and
takes off tan.
TO REMOVE MOTH PATCHES.
Into a pint of rum put a tablespoonful of flour of sulphur.
Apply this to the patches once a day, and they will disappear in
two or three weeks.
CURE FOR PIMPLES.
One teaspoonful of carbolic acid and one pint of rose-water
mixed is an excellent remedy for pimples. Bathe the skin thoroughly
and often, but do not let the wash get into the eyes.
This wash is soothing to mosquito bites, and irritations of the
skin of every nature.
It is advisable, in order to clear the complexion permanently,
to cleanse the blood; then the wash would be of advantage.
To obtain a good complexion, a person's diet should receive the
first attention. Greasy food, highly spiced soups, hot bread and
butter, meats or game, rich gravies, alcoholic liquors,
coffee—all are injurious to the complexion. Strong tea used
daily will after a time give the skin the color and appearance of
leather. Coffee affects the nerves more, but the skin less, and a
healthy nervous system is necessary to beauty. Eating between
meals, late suppers, over-eating at [Pg
582]meals, eating
sweetmeats, candies, etc., all these tend to disorder the blood,
producing pimples and blotches.
Washing of the face or skin is another consideration for a good
complexion; it should be thoroughly washed in plenty of luke-warm
water with some mild soap—then rinsed in clear water
well; dry with a thick soft towel. If suds is left or wiped
off the skin, the action of the air and sun will tan the surface,
and permanently deface the complexion; therefore one should be sure
to thoroughly rinse off all soap from the skin to avoid the
tanning, which will leave a brown or yellow tinge impossible to
efface.
PEARL SMELLING SALTS.
Powdered carbonate of ammonia one ounce, strong solution of
ammonia half a fluid ounce, oil of rosemary ten drops, oil of
bergamot ten drops. Mix, and while moist put in wide-mouthed bottle
which is to be well closed.
PEARL TOOTH POWDER.
Prepared chalk half a pound, powdered myrrh two ounces; camphor
two drachms, orris root, powdered, two ounces; moisten the camphor
with alcohol and mix well together.
REMOVING TARTAR FROM THE TEETH.
This preparation is used by dentists. Pure muriatic acid one
ounce, water one ounce, honey two ounces, mix thoroughly. Take a
tooth-brush, and wet it freely with this preparation, and briskly
rub the black teeth, and in a moment's time they will be perfectly
white; then immediately wash out the mouth well with water, that
the acid may not act on the enamel of the teeth. This should be
done only occasionally.
BAD BREATH.
Bad breath from catarrh, foul stomach, or bad teeth, may be
temporarily relieved by diluting a little bromo chloralum with
eight or ten parts of water, and using it as a gargle, and
swallowing a few drops before going out. A pint of bromo chloralum
costs fifty cents, but a small vial will last a long time.
SHAVING COMPOUND.
Half a pound of plain, white soap, dissolved in a small quantity
of alcohol, as little as can be used; add a tablespoonful of
pulverized borax. Shave the soap and put it in a small tin basin or
cup; place it on the fire in a dish of boiling water; when melted,
add the alcohol, and remove from the fire; stir in oil of bergamot
sufficient to perfume it.
BARBER'S SHAMPOO MIXTURE.
Dissolve half an ounce of carbonate of ammonia and one ounce of
borax in one quart of water; then add two ounces of glycerine in
three quarts of New England rum, and one quart of bay rum. Moisten
the hair with this liquid; shampoo with the hands until a light
lather is formed; then wash off with plenty of clean water.
RAZOR-STROP PASTE.
Wet the strop with a little sweet oil, and apply a little flour
of emery evenly over the surface.
CAMPHOR ICE.
Melt together over a water bath white wax and spermaceti each
one ounce, camphor two ounces, sweet almond oil, one pound, then
triturate until the mixture has become homogeneous, and allow one
pound of rose-water to flow in slowly during the operation.
Excellent for chapped lips or hands.
ODORIFEROUS OR SWEET-SCENTING BAGS.
Lavender flowers one ounce, pulverized orris, two drachms,
bruised rosemary leaves half ounce, musk five grains, attar of rose
five drops. Mix well, sew up in small flat muslin bags, and cover
them with fancy silk or satin.
These are very nice to keep in your bureau drawers or trunk, as
the perfume penetrates through the contents of the trunk or
drawers. An acceptable present to a single gentleman.
HOW TO KEEP BRUSHES CLEAN.
The best way in which to clean hair-brushes is with spirits of
ammonia, as its effect is immediate. No rubbing is required, and
cold [Pg 584]water can be used just as successfully as warm. Take
a tablespoonful of ammonia to a quart of water, dip the hair part
of the brush without wetting the ivory, and in a moment the grease
is removed; then rinse in cold water, shake well, and dry in the
air, but not in the sun. Soda and soap soften the bristles and
invariably turn the ivory yellow.
TOILET ITEMS.
Mutton tallow is considered excellent to soften the hands. It
may be rubbed on at any time when the hands are perfectly dry, but
the best time is when retiring, and an old pair of soft, large
gloves thoroughly covered on the inside with the tallow and
glycerine in equal parts, melted together, can be worn during the
night with the most satisfactory results.
Four parts of glycerine and five parts of yolks of eggs
thoroughly mixed, and applied after washing the hands, is also
considered excellent.
For chapped hands or face: One ounce of glycerine, one ounce of
alcohol mixed, then add eight ounces of rose-water.
Another good rule is to rub well in dry oatmeal after every
washing, and be particular regarding the quality of soap. Cheap
soap and hard water are the unknown enemies of many people, and the
cause of rough skin and chapped hands. Castile soap and rain-water
will sometimes cure without any other assistance.
Camphor ice is also excellent, and can be applied with but
little inconvenience. Borax dissolved and added to the toilet water
is also good.
For chapped lips, beeswax dissolved in a small quantity of sweet
oil, by heating carefully. Apply the salve two or three times a
day, and avoid wetting the lips as much as possible.
To soften the hands: One can have the hands in soap-suds with
soft soap without injury to the skin if the hands are dipped in
vinegar or lemon juice immediately after. The acids destroy the
corrosive effects of the alkali, and make the hands soft and white.
Indian meal and vinegar or lemon juice used on hands where
roughened by cold or labor will heal and soften them. Rub the hands
in this, then wash off thoroughly and rub in glycerine. Those who
suffer from chapped hands will find this comforting.
To remove stains, rub a slice of raw potato upon the stains; or
wash the hands in lemon juice or steeped laurel-leaves.
To give a fine color to the nails, the hands and fingers must be
well lathered and washed with fine soap; then the nails must be
rubbed with equal parts of cinnebar and emery, followed by oil of
bitter almonds. To take white spots from the nails, melt equal
parts of pitch and turpentine in a small cup; add to it vinegar and
powdered sulphur. Rub this on the nails and the spots will soon
disappear.
TOILET SOAP.
One pound of washing soda, one pound of lard or clear tallow,
half a pound of unslaked lime, one tablespoonful of salt, three
quarts of water. Put the soda and lime in a large dish, and pour
over the water, boiling hot; stir until dissolved; let it stand
until clear, then pour off the clear liquid, add the grease and
salt; boil four hours, then pour into pans to cool. If it should be
inclined to curdle or separate, indicating the lime to be too
strong, pour in a little more water, and boil again. Perfume as you
please, and pour into molds or a shallow dish, and, when cold, cut
into bars to dry.
ANTIDOTES FOR POISONS.
The following list gives some of the more common poisons and the
remedies most likely to be on hand in case of need:—

salt, a tablespoonful of each, in a coffeecup of warm water;
then follow with sweet oil, butter made warm, or milk. Also may use
the white of an egg in half a cupful of milk or lime water. Chalk
and water is good, and the preparation of iron, ten drops in water
every half hour: hydrated magnesia.
Alcohol:—First cleanse out the stomach by an
emetic, then dash cold water on the head, and give ammonia (spirits
of hartshorn).

ARTICLES REQUIRED FOR THE KITCHEN.
The following list will show what articles are necessary for the
kitchen, and will be quite an aid to young housekeepers when about
commencing to furnish the utensils needed in the kitchen
department, and may prove useful to many.
An ingenious housewife will manage to do with less conveniences,
but these articles, if they can be purchased in the commencement of
housekeeping, will save time and labor, making the preparation of
food more easy—and it is always economy in the end to get the
best material in all wares, as, for instance, the double plate tin
will last for years, whereas the poor kind has to be replaced in a
short time; the low-priced earthenware is soon broken up, whereas
the strong stoneware, costing but a trifle more, lasts almost a
lifetime.
In relation to the economy and management of the kitchen, I
might suggest that the most essential thing is cleanliness in
cooking, and also cleanliness with your person as well as in the
keeping of the kitchen.
The hands of the cook should be always thoroughly cleansed
before touching or handling anything pertaining to the cooking.
Next there should never be anything wasted or thrown away that can
be turned to account, either for your own family or some family in
poor circumstances. Bread that has become hard can be used for
toasting, or for stuffing and pudding. In warm weather any gravies
or soups that are left from the preceding day should be boiled up
and poured into clean pans. This is particularly necessary where
vegetables have been added to the preparation, as it then so soon
turns sour. In cooler weather, every other day will be often enough
to warm up these things. In cooking, clear as you go; that is to
say, do not allow a host of basins, plates, spoons, and other
utensils, to accumulate on the dressers and tables whilst you are
engaged in preparing the dinner. By a little management and
forethought, much confusion may be saved in this way. It is as easy
to put a thing in its place when it is done with, as it is to keep
continually moving it to find room for fresh requisites. For
instance, after making a pudding, the flour-tub, paste-board, and
rolling-pin, should be put away, and any basins, spoons, etc.,
should be neatly packed up near the sink, to be washed when the
proper time arrives. Neatness, order and method should be always
observed.
Never let your stock of spices, salt, seasoning, herbs, etc.,
dwindle down so low that some day, in the midst of preparing a
large dinner, you find yourself minus a very important ingredient,
thereby causing much confusion and annoyance.
After you have washed your saucepans, fish-kettle, etc., stand
them before the fire for a few minutes to get thoroughly dry
inside, [Pg 591]before putting them away. They should then be kept
in a dry place, in order that they may escape the deteriorating
influence of rust, and thereby be quickly destroyed. Never leave
saucepans dirty from one day's use to be cleaned the next; it is
slovenly and untidy.
Do not be afraid of hot water in washing up dishes and dirty
cooking utensils. As these are essentially greasy, luke-warm water
cannot possibly have the effect of cleansing them effectually. Do
not be chary also of changing and renewing the water occasionally.
You will thus save yourself much time and labor in the long
run.
Keep a cake of sapolio always on hand in the
kitchen—always convenient for rubbing off stains from
earthenware, tin, glass, in fact, almost everything but silver; it
is a cheap and valuable article, and can be purchased at nearly
every grocery in the United States.
GENERAL REMARKS.
Everything should be clean. The goods should be scoured in soap
and the soap rinsed out. They are often steeped in soap lye over
night. Dip them into water just before putting them into
preparations, to prevent spotting. Soft water should be used,
sufficient to cover the goods well; this is always understood
where quantity is not mentioned. When goods are dyed, air them;
then rinse well, and hang up to dry. Do not wring silk or merino
dresses when scouring or dyeing them. If cotton goods are to be
dyed a light color, they should first be bleached.
SILKS.
Black:—Make a weak lye as for black or woolens;
work goods in bichromate of potash a little below boiling heat,
then dip in the log-wood in the same way; if colored in blue
vitriol dye, use about the same heat.
Orange:—For one pound goods, annotto one pound,
soda one pound; repeat as desired.
Green—Very Handsome:—For one pound goods,
yellow oak bark eight ounces; boil one-half hour; turn off the
liquor from bark and add alum six ounces; let it stand until cold;
while making this, color [Pg
592]goods in blue
dye-tub a light blue, dry and wash, dip in alum and bark dye. If it
does not take well, warm the dye a little.
Purple:—For one pound goods. First obtain a light
blue, by dipping in home-made dye-tub; then dry; dip in alum four
ounces, with water to cover, when little warm. If color is not full
enough add chemic.
Yellow:—For one pound goods, alum three ounces,
sugar of lead three-fourths ounce; immerse goods in solution over
night; take out, drain, and make a new lye with fustic one pound;
dip until the required color is obtained.
Crimson:—For one pound goods, alum three ounces;
dip at hand heat one hour; take out and drain while making new dye
by boiling ten minutes, cochineal three ounces, bruised nutgalls
two ounces and cream of tartar one-fourth ounce, in one pail of
water; when little cool, begin to dip, raising heat to boil; dip
one hour; wash and dry.
Sky Blue on Silk or Cotton—Very
Beautiful:—Give goods as much color from a solution of
blue vitriol two ounces, to water one gallon, as it will take up in
dipping fifteen minutes; then run it through lime water. This will
make a beautiful and durable sky blue.
Brown on Silk or Cotton—Very Beautiful:—After
obtaining a blue color as above, run goods through a solution of
prussiate of potash one ounce, to water one gallon.
Light Blue:—For cold water one gallon, dissolve
alum one-half tablespoonful, in hot water one teacupful, and add to
it; then add chemic, one teaspoonful at a time to obtain the
desired color—the more chemic the darker the color.
WOOLEN GOODS.
Chrome Black—Best in Use:—For five pounds of
goods, blue vitriol six ounces; boil a few minutes, then dip the
goods three-fourths of an hour, airing often; take out the goods,
make a dye with three pounds of log-wood, boil one-half hour; dip
three-fourths of an hour, air goods, and dip three-fourths of an
hour more. Wash in strong suds. This will not fade by exposure to
sun.
Wine Color:—For five pounds of goods, camwood two
pounds; boil fifteen minutes and dip the goods one-half hour; boil
again and dip one-half hour then darken with blue vitriol one and
one-half ounces; if not dark enough, add copperas one-half
ounce.
Scarlet—Very Fine:—For one pound of goods,
cream of tartar one-half ounce, cochineal, well pulverized, one
half ounce, muriate of tin two and one-half ounces; boil up the dye
and enter the goods; work them briskly for ten or fifteen minutes,
then boil one and one-half hours, stirring goods slowly while
boiling. Wash in clear water and dry in the shade.
Pink:—For three pounds of goods, alum three ounces;
boil and dip the goods one hour, then add to the dye, cream of
tartar four ounces, cochineal, well pulverized, one ounce; boil
well and dip the goods while boiling until the color suits.
Blue—Quick Process:—For two pounds of goods,
alum five ounces, cream of tartar three ounces; boil goods in this
one hour, then put them into warm water which has more or less
extract of indigo in it, according to the depth of color desired,
and boil again until it suits, adding more of the blue if
needed.
Madder Red:—To each pound of goods, alum five
ounces, red or cream of tartar one ounce. Put in the goods and
bring the kettle to a boil for one-half hour; then air them and
boil one-half hour longer; empty the kettle and fill with clean
water; put in bran one peck; make it milk-warm, and let it stand
until the bran rises; then skim off the bran and put in one-half
pound madder; put in the goods and heat slowly until it boils and
is done. Wash in strong suds.
Green:—For each pound of goods, fustic one pound,
with alum three and one-half ounces; steep until strength is out,
and soak the goods therein until a good yellow is obtained, then
remove the chips, and add extract of indigo or chemic, one
tablespoonful at a time, until color suits.
Snuff Brown, Dark:—For five pounds of goods,
camwood one pound; boil it fifteen minutes; then dip the goods
three-fourths of an hour; take them out and add to the dye two and
one-half pounds fustic; boil ten minutes, and dip the goods
three-fourths of an hour; then add blue vitriol one ounce, copperas
four ounces; dip again one-half hour. If not dark enough add more
copperas.
Another Method—Any Shade:—Boil the goods in a
mordant of alum two parts, copperas three parts; then rinse them
through a bath of madder. The tint depends on the relative
proportions of the copperas and alum; the more copperas, the darker
the dye; joint weight of both should not be more than one-eighth of
weight of goods. Mixtures of reds and yellows with blues and
blacks, or simple dyes, will make any shade.
Orange:—For five pounds of goods, muriate of tin
six tablespoonfuls, argol four ounces; boil and dip one hour and
add again to the dye one teacupful of madder; dip again one-half
hour. Cochineal, about two ounces, in place of madder, makes a much
brighter color.
Purple:—For each pound of goods, two ounces of
cudbear; rinse the goods well in soap-suds, then dissolve cudbear
in hot suds—not quite boiling, and soak the goods until of
required color. The color is brightened by rinsing in alum
water.
Yellow—Rich:—Work five pounds of goods
one-half hour in a boiling bath with three ounces bichromate of
potassa and two ounces alum; lift and expose till well cooled and
drained; then work one-half hour in another bath with five pounds
of fustic. Wash out and dry.
Crimson:—Work for one hour in a bath with one pound
cochineal paste, six ounces of dry cochineal, one pound of tartar,
one pint of protochloride of tin. Wash out and dry.
Salmon:—For each pound of goods, one-fourth pound
of annotto, one-fourth pound of soap; rinse the goods well in warm
water, put them into mixture and boil one-half hour. Shade will be
according to the amount of annotto.
Dove and Slate Colors of All Shades:—Boil in an
iron vessel a teacupful of black tea with a teaspoonful of copperas
and sufficient water. Dilute till you get the shade wanted.
COTTON GOODS.
Black:—For five pounds of goods, boil them in a
decoction of three pounds of sumach one-half hour and steep twelve
hours; dip in lime-water one-half hour; take out and let them drip
one hour, run them through the lime-water again fifteen minutes.
Make a new dye with two and one-half pounds log-wood (boiled one
hour) and dip [Pg 595]again three hours; add bichromate
potash two ounces, to the log-wood dye and dip one hour. Wash in
clear, cold water and dry in the shade. Only process for permanent
black.
Sky Blue:—For three pounds of goods, blue vitriol
four ounces; boil a few minutes, then dip the goods three hours;
then pass them through a strong lime-water. A beautiful
brown can be obtained by next putting the goods through a solution
of prussiate of potash.
Green:—Dip the goods in home-made blue; dye until
blue enough is obtained to make the green as dark as required; take
out, dry and rinse a little. Make a dye with fustic three pounds,
of log-wood three ounces, to each pound of goods, by boiling dye
one hour; when cooled so as to bear the hand put in the goods, move
briskly a few minutes, and let lie one hour; take out and
thoroughly drain; dissolve and add to the dye for each pound of
cotton, blue vitriol one-half ounce, and dip another hour. Wring
out and let dry in the shade. By adding or diminishing the log-wood
and fustic any shade may be had.
Yellow:—For five pounds of goods, seven ounces of
sugar of lead; dip the goods two hours; make a new dye with
bichromate of potash four ounces; dip until the color suits; wring
out and dry. If not yellow enough, repeat.
Orange:—For five pounds of goods, sugar of lead
four ounces; boil a few minutes; when a little cool, put in the
goods; dip for two hours; wring out; make a new dye with bichromate
potash eight ounces, madder two ounces; dip until it suits; if
color is too red, take a small sample and dip into lime-water and
choose between them.
Red:—Muriate of tin two-thirds of a teacupful; add
water to cover the goods; raise to boiling heat; put in the goods
one hour, stir often; take out, empty the kettle, put in clean
water with nic-wood one pound; steep one-half hour at hand heat;
then put in the goods and increase the heat one hour—not
boiling. Air the goods and dip them one hour as before. Wash
without soap.
Delicacy of manner at table stamps both man and woman, for one
can, at a glance, discern whether a person has been trained to eat
well—i.e. to hold the knife and fork properly, to eat
without the slightest [Pg 596]sound of the lips, to drink quietly,
to use the napkin rightly, to make no noise with any of the
implements of the table, and last, but not least, to eat slowly and
masticate the food thoroughly. All these points should be most
carefully taught to children, and then they will always feel at
their ease at the grandest tables in the land. There is no position
where the innate refinement of a person is more fully exhibited
than at the table, and nowhere that those who have not been trained
in table etiquette feel more keenly their deficiencies. The knife
should never be used to carry food to the mouth, but only to cut it
up into small mouthfuls; then place it upon the plate at one side,
and take the fork in the right hand, and eat all the food with it.
When both have been used finally, they should be laid diagonally
across the plate, with both handles toward the right hand; this is
understood by well-trained waiters to be the signal for removing
them, together with the plate.
Be careful to keep the mouth shut closely while masticating the
food. It is the opening of the lips which causes the smacking which
seems very disgusting. Chew your food well, but do it silently, and
be careful to take small mouthfuls. The knife can be used to cut
the meat finely, as large pieces of meat are not healthful, and
appear very indelicate. At many tables, two, three or more knives
and forks are placed on the table, the knives at the right hand of
the plate, the forks at the left,—a knife and a fork for each
course, so that there need be no replacing of them after the
breakfast and dinner is served. The smaller ones, which are for
game, dessert, or for hot cakes at breakfast, can be tucked under
the edges of the plate, and the large ones, for the meat and
vegetables, are placed outside of them. Be very careful not to
clatter your knives and forks upon your plates, but use them
without noise. When passing the plate for a second helping, lay
them together at one side of the plate, with handles to the right.
When you are helped to anything, do not wait until the rest
of the company are provided, as it is not considered good breeding.
Soup is always served for the first course, and it should be eaten
with dessert spoons, and taken from the sides, not the tips, of
them, without any sound of the lips, and not sucked into the mouth
audibly from the ends of the spoon. Bread should not be broken into
soup or gravy. Never ask to be helped to soup a second time. The
hostess may ask you to take a second plate, but you will politely
decline. [Pg 597]Fish chowder, which is served in soup plates, is
said to be an exception which proves this rule, and when eating of
that it is correct to take a second plateful if desired.
Another generally neglected obligation is that of spreading
butter on one's bread as it lies in one's plate, or but slightly
lifted at one end of the plate; it is very frequently buttered in
the air, bitten in gouges, and still held in the face and eyes of
the table with the marks of the teeth on it; This is certainly not
altogether pleasant, and it is better to cut it, a bit at a time,
after buttering it, and put piece by piece in the mouth with one's
finger and thumb. Never help yourself to butter, or any other food
with your own knife or fork. It is not considered good taste to mix
food on the same plate. Salt must be left on the side of the plate
and never on the tablecloth.
Let us mention a few things concerning the eating of which there
is sometimes doubt. A cream-cake and anything of similar nature
should be eaten with knife and fork, never bitten.
Asparagus—which should be always served on bread or toast so
as to absorb superfluous moisture—may be taken from the
finger and thumb; if it is fit to be set before you the whole of it
may be eaten. Pastry should be broken and eaten with a fork, never
cut with a knife. Raw oysters should be eaten with a fork, also
fish. Peas and beans, as we all know, require the fork only;
however food that cannot be held with a fork should be eaten with a
spoon. Potatoes, if mashed, should be mashed with the fork. Green
corn should be eaten from the cob; but it must be held with a
single hand.
Celery, cresses, olives, radishes, and relishes of that kind
are, of course, to be eaten with the fingers; the salt should be
laid upon one's plate, not upon the cloth. Fish is to be eaten with
the fork, without the assistance of the knife; a bit of bread in
the left hand sometimes helps one to master a refractory morsel.
Fresh fruit should be eaten with a silver-bladed knife, especially
pears, apples, etc.
Berries, of course, are to be eaten with a spoon. In England
they are served with their hulls on, and three or four are
considered an ample quantity. But then in England they are many
times the size of ours; there they take the big berry by the stem,
dip into powdered sugar, and eat it as we do the turnip radish. It
is not proper to drink with a spoon in the cup; nor should one,
by-the-way, ever quite drain a cup or glass.
Don't, when you drink, elevate your glass as if you were going
to stand it inverted on your nose. Bring the glass perpendicularly
to the lips, and then lift it to a slight angle. Do this
easily.
Drink sparingly while eating. It is far better for the digestion
not to drink tea or coffee until the meal is finished. Drink
gently, and do not pour it down your throat like water turned out
of a pitcher.
When seating yourself at the table, unfold your napkin and lay
it across your lap in such a manner that it will not slide off upon
the floor; a gentleman should place it across his right knee. Do
not tuck it into your neck like a child's bib. For an old person,
however, it is well to attach the napkin to a napkin hook and slip
it into the vest or dress buttonholes, to protect their garments,
or sew a broad tape at two places on the napkin, and pass it over
the head. When the soup is eaten, wipe the mouth carefully with the
napkin, and use it to wipe the hands after meals. Finger bowls are
not a general institution, and yet they seem to be quite as needful
as the napkin, for the fingers are also liable to become a little
soiled in eating. They can be had quite cheaply, and should be
half-filled with water, and placed upon the side table or butler's
tray, with the dessert, bread and cheese, etc. They are passed to
each person half filled with water, placed on a parti-colored
napkin with a dessert plate underneath, when the dessert is placed
upon the table. A leaf or two of sweet verbena, an orange flower,
or a small slice of lemon, is usually put into each bowl to rub
upon the fingers. The slice of lemon is most commonly used. The
finger tips are slightly dipped into the bowl, the lemon juice is
squeezed upon them, and then they are dried softly upon the napkin.
At dinner parties and luncheons they are indispensable.
Spoons are sometimes used with firm puddings, but forks are the
better style. A spoon should never be turned over in the mouth.
Ladies have frequently an affected way of holding the knife
half-way down its length, as if it were too big for their little
hands; but this is as awkward a way as it is weak; the knife should
be grasped freely by the handle only, the forefinger being the only
one to touch the blade, and that only along the back of the blade
at its root, and no further down.
At the conclusion of a course, where they have been used, knife
and fork should be laid side by side across the middle of the
plate—never [Pg 599]crossed; the old custom of crossing
them was in obedience to an ancient religious formula. The servant
should offer everything at the left of the guest, that the guest
may be at liberty to use the right hand. If one has been given a
napkin ring, it is necessary to fold one's napkin and use the ring;
otherwise the napkin should be left unfolded. One's teeth are not
to be picked at table; but if it is impossible to hinder it, it
should be done behind the napkin. One may pick a bone at the table,
but, as with corn, only one hand is allowed to touch it; yet one
can easily get enough from it with knife and fork, which is
certainly the more elegant way of doing; and to take her teeth to
it gives a lady the look of caring a little too much for the
pleasures of the table; one is, however, on no account to suck
one's finger after it.
Whenever there is any doubt as to the best way to do a thing, it
is wise to follow that which is the most rational, and that will
almost invariably be found to be proper etiquette. To be at ease is
a great step towards enjoying your own dinner, and making yourself
agreeable to the company. There is reason for everything in polite
usage; thus the reason why one does not blow a thing to cool it, is
not only that it is an inelegant and vulgar action intrinsically,
but because it may be offensive to others—cannot help being
so, indeed; and it, moreover implies, haste, which, whether from
greediness or a desire to get away, is equally objectionable.
Everything else may be as easily traced to its origin in the fit
and becoming.
If, to conclude, one seats one's self properly at table and
takes reason into account, one will do tolerably well. One must not
pull one's chair too closely to the table, for the natural result
of that is the inability to use one's knife and fork without
inconveniencing one's neighbor; the elbows are to be held well in
and close to one's side, which cannot be done if the chair is too
near the board. One must not lie or lean along the table, nor rest
one's arms upon it. Nor is one to touch any of the dishes; if a
member of the family, one can exercise all the duties of
hospitality through servants, and wherever there are servants,
neither family nor guests are to pass or help from any dish.
Finally, when rising from your chair leave it where it stands.
THE LAYING OF THE TABLE AND THE TREATMENT OF GUESTS.
In giving "dinners," the apparently trifling details are of
great importance when taken as a whole.
We gather around our board agreeable persons, and they pay us
and our dinner the courtesy of dressing for the occasion, and this
reunion should be a time of profit as well as pleasure. There are
certain established laws by which "dinner giving" is regulated in
polite society; and it may not be amiss to give a few observances
in relation to them. One of the first is that an invited guest
should arrive at the house of his host at least a quarter of an
hour before the time appointed for dinner. In laying the table for
dinner all the linen should be a spotless white throughout,
and underneath the linen tablecloth should be spread one of thick
cotton-flannel or baize, which gives the linen a heavier and finer
appearance, also deadening the sound of moving dishes. Large and
neatly folded napkins (ironed without starch), with pieces of bread
three or four inches long, placed between the folds, but not to
completely conceal it, are laid on each plate. An ornamental
centre-piece, or a vase filled with a few rare flowers, is put on
the centre of the table, in place of the large table-castor, which
has gone into disuse, and is rarely seen now on well-appointed
tables. A few choice flowers make a charming variety in the
appearance of even the most simply laid table, and a pleasing
variety at table is quite as essential to the enjoyment of the
repast as is a good choice of dishes, for the eye in fact should be
gratified as much as the palate.
All dishes should be arranged in harmony with the decorations of
the flowers, such as covers, relishes, confectionery, and small
sweets. Garnishing of dishes has also a great deal to do with the
appearance of a dinner-table, each dish garnished sufficiently to
be in good taste without looking absurd.
Beside each plate should be laid as many knives, forks and
spoons as will be required for the several courses, unless the
hostess prefers to have them brought on with each change. A glass
of water, and when wine is served glasses for it, and individual
salt-cellars may be placed at every plate. Water-bottles are now
much in vogue with [Pg 601]corresponding tumblers to cover them;
these, accompanied with dishes of broken ice, may be arranged in
suitable places. When butter is served a special knife is used, and
that, with all other required service, may be left to the judgment
and taste of the hostess, in the proper placing of the various aids
to her guests' comfort.
The dessert plates should be set ready, each with a doily and a
finger-glass partly filled with water, in which is dropped a slice
of lemon; these with extra knives, forks and spoons, should be on
the side-board ready to be placed beside the guest between the
courses when required.
If preferred, the "dinner" may all be served from the
side-table, thus relieving the host from the task of carving. A
plate is set before each guest, and the dish carved is presented by
the waiter on the left-hand side of each guest. At the end of each
course the plates give way for those of the next. If not served
from the side-table, the dishes are brought in ready carved, and
placed before the host and hostess, then served and placed upon the
waiter's salver, to be laid by that attendant before the guest.
Soup and fish being the first course, plates of soup are usually
placed on the table before the dinner is announced; or if the
hostess wishes the soup served at the table, the soup-tureen,
containing hot soup, and the warm soup-plates are
placed before the seat of the hostess. Soup and fish being disposed
of, then come the joints or roasts, entrees (made dishes),
poultry, etc., also relishes.
After dishes have been passed that are required no more, such as
vegetables, hot sauces, etc., the dishes containing them may be set
upon the side-board, ready to be taken away.
Jellies and sauces, when not to be eaten as a dessert, should be
helped on the dinner-plate, not on a small side dish as was the
former usage.
If a dish be on the table, some parts of which are preferred to
others, according to the taste of the individuals, all should have
the opportunity of choice. The host will simply ask each one if he
has any preference for a particular part; if he replies in the
negative, you are not to repeat the question, nor insist that he
must have a preference.
Do not attempt to eulogize your dishes, or apologize that you
cannot recommend them—this is extreme bad taste; as also is
the vaunting of the excellence of your wines, etc., etc.
Do not insist upon your guests partaking of particular dishes.
Do not ask persons more than once, and never force a supply upon
their plates. It is ill-bred, though common, to press any one to
eat; and, moreover, it is a great annoyance to many.
In winter, plates should always be warmed, but not made hot. Two
kinds of animal food, or two kinds of dessert, should not be eaten
off of one plate, and there should never be more than two
kinds of vegetables with one course. Asparagus, green corn,
cauliflower and raw tomatoes comprise one course in place of a
salad. All meats should be cut across the grain in very thin
slices. Fish, at dinner, should be baked or boiled, never fried or
broiled. Baked ham may be used in every course after fish, sliced
thin and handed after the regular course is disposed of.
The hostess should retain her plate, knife and fork, until her
guests have finished.
The crumb-brush is not used until the preparation for bringing
in the dessert; then all the glasses are removed, except the
flowers, the water-tumblers, and the glass of wine which the guest
wishes to retain with his dessert. The dessert plate containing the
finger-bowl, also a dessert knife and fork, should then be set
before each guest, who at once removes the finger-bowl and its
doily, and the knife and fork to the table, leaving the plate ready
to be used for any dessert chosen.
Finely sifted sugar should always be placed upon the table to be
used with puddings, pies, fruit, etc., and if cream is required,
let it stand by the dish it is to be served with.
To lay a dessert for a small entertainment and a few guests
outside of the family, it may consist simply of two dishes of fresh
fruit in season, two of dried fruits and two each of cakes and
nuts.
Coffee and tea are served lastly, poured into tiny cups
and served clear, passed around on a tray to each guest, then the
sugar and cream passed that each person may be allowed to season
his black coffee or café noir to suit himself.
A family dinner, even with a few friends, can be made
quite attractive and satisfactory without much display or expense;
consisting first of good soup, then fish garnished with suitable
additions, followed by a roast; then vegetables and some made
dishes, a salad, crackers, cheese and olives, then dessert. This
sensible meal, well cooked and neatly served, is pleasing to almost
any one, and is within the means of any housekeeper in ordinary
circumstances.

THE WHOLE COMPRISING
A COMPREHENSIVE CYCLOPEDIA OF
INFORMATION FOR THE HOME
AND
Steward of the White house
1887
TO THE WIVES OF OUR PRESIDENTS,
THOSE NOBLE WOMEN WHO HAVE GRACED THE WHITE HOUSE, AND WHOSE NAMES
AND MEMORIES ARE DEAR TO ALL AMERICANS, THIS VOLUME IS
AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.[Pg
2]
In presenting to the public the "WHITE HOUSE COOK BOOK," the
publishers believe they can justly claim that it more fully
represents the progress and present perfection of the culinary art
than any previous work. In point of authorship, it stands
preëminent. Hugo Ziemann was at one time caterer for that
Prince Napoleon who was killed while fighting the Zulus in Africa.
He was afterwards steward of the famous Hotel Splendide in Paris.
Later he conducted the celebrated Brunswick Café in New
York, and still later he gave to the Hotel Richelieu, in Chicago, a
cuisine which won the applause of even the gourmets of foreign
lands. It was here that he laid the famous "spread" to which the
chiefs of the warring factions of the Republican Convention sat
down in June, 1888, and from which they arose with asperities
softened, differences harmonized and victory organized.
Mrs. F.L. Gillette is no less proficient and capable, having
made a life-long and thorough study of cookery and housekeeping,
especially as adapted to the practical wants of average American
homes.
The book has been prepared with great care. Every recipe has
been tried and tested, and can be relied upon as one
of the best of its kind. It is comprehensive, filling
completely, it is believed, the requirements of housekeepers of all
classes. It embodies several original and commendable features,
among which may be mentioned the menus for the holidays and
for one week in each month in the year, thus covering all varieties
of seasonable foods; the convenient classification and arrangement
of topics; the simplified method of explanation in preparing an
article, in the order of manipulation, thereby enabling the most
inexperienced to clearly comprehend it.
The subject of carving has been given a prominent place, not
only because of its special importance in a work of this kind, but
particu[Pg 4]larly because it contains entirely new and original
designs, and is so far a departure from the usual mode of treating
the subject.
Interesting information is given concerning the White
House; how its hospitality is conducted, the menus served on
special occasions, views of the interior, portraits of all the
ladies of the White House, etc.
Convenience has been studied in the make-up of the book. The
type is large and plain; it is sewed by patent flexible process, so
that when opened it will not close of itself, and it is bound in
enameled cloth, adapted for use in the kitchen.
THE PUBLISHERS.
Carving is one important acquisition in the routine of daily
living, and all should try to attain a knowledge or ability to do
it well, and withal gracefully.
When carving use a chair slightly higher than the ordinary size,
as it gives a better purchase on the meat, and appears more
graceful than when standing, as is often quite necessary when
carving a turkey, or a very large joint. More depends on skill than
strength. The platter should be placed opposite, and sufficiently
near to give perfect command of the article to be carved, the knife
of medium size, sharp with a keen edge. Commence by cutting the
slices thin, laying them carefully to one side of the platter, then
afterwards placing the desired amount on each guest's plate, to be
served in turn by the servant.
In carving fish, care should be taken to help it in perfect
flakes; for if these are broken the beauty of the fish is lost. The
carver should acquaint himself with the choicest parts and morsels;
and to give each guest an equal share of those tidbits
should be his maxim. Steel knives and forks should on no account be
used in helping fish, as these are liable to impart a very
disagreeable flavor. A fish-trowel of silver or plated silver is
the proper article to use.
Gravies should be sent to the table very hot, and in
helping one to gravy or melted butter, place it on a vacant side of
the plate, not pour it over their meat, fish or fowl, that
they may use only as much as they like.
When serving fowls, or meats, accompanied with stuffing, the
guests should be asked if they would have a portion, as it is not
every one to whom the flavor of stuffing is agreeable; in filling
their plates, avoid heaping one thing upon another, as it makes a
bad appearance.
A word about the care of carving knives: a fine steel knife
should not come in contact with intense heat, because it destroys
its temper, and therefore impairs its cutting qualities. Table
carving knives should not be used in the kitchen, either around the
stove, or for cutting bread, meats, vegetables, etc.; a fine
whetstone should be kept for sharpening, and the knife cleaned
carefully to avoid dulling its edge, all of which is quite
essential to successful carving.

according to the several joints of beef, when cut up.
First Class.—Includes the sirloin with the kidney
suet (1), the rump steak piece (2), the fore-rib (11).
Second Class.—The buttock or round (4), the thick
flank (7), the middle ribs (11).

about eight weeks old, are nearly of the following
weights:—Loin and chump, 18 lbs.; fillet, 12½ lbs.;
hind-knuckle, 5½ lbs.; shoulder, 11 lbs.; neck, 11 lbs.;
breast, 9 lbs., and fore-knuckle, 5 lbs.; making a total of 144
lbs. weight.
MUTTON.
No. 1. Leg, used for roasts and for boiling.
No. 2. Shoulder, used for baked dishes and roasts.
No. 3. Loin, best end used for roasts, chops.
No. 4. Loin, chump-end used for roasts and chops.
No. 5. Rack, or rib chops, used for French chops, rib chops,
either for frying or broiling; also used for choice stews.
No. 6. Breast, used for roast, baked dishes, stews, chops.
No. 7. Neck or scrag-end, used for cutlets, stews and
meat-pies.
NOTE.—A saddle of muton or double loin is two loins cut
off before the carcass is split open down the back. French chops
are a small rib chop, the end of the bone trimmed off and the meat
and fat cut away from the thin end, leaving the round piece of meat
attached to the larger end, which leaves the small rib-bone bare.
Very tender and sweet.
Mutton is prime when cut from a carcass which has been
fed out of doors, and allowed to run upon the hillside; they are
best when about three years old. The fat will then be abundant,
white and hard, the flesh juicy and firm, and of a clear red
color.
For mutton roasts, choose the shoulder, the saddle, or the loin
or haunch. The leg should be boiled. Almost any part will do for
broth.
Lamb born in the middle of the winter, reared under shelter, and
fed in a great measure upon milk, then killed in the spring, is
considered a great delicacy, though lamb is good at a year old.
Like all young animals, lamb ought to be thoroughly cooked, or it
is most unwholesome.
PORK.
No. 1. Leg, used for smoked hams, roasts and corned pork.
No. 2. Hind-loin, used for roasts, chops and baked dishes.
No. 3. Fore-loin or ribs, used for roasts, baked dishes or
chops.
No. 4. Spare-rib, used for roasts, chops, stews.
No. 5. Shoulder, used for smoked shoulder, roasts and corned
pork.
No. 6. Brisket and flank, used for pickling in salt and smoked
bacon.
The cheek is used for pickling in salt, also the shank or shin.
The feet are usually used for souse and jelly.
For family use the leg is the most economical, that is when
fresh, and the loin the richest. The best pork is from carcasses
weighing from fifty to about one hundred and twenty-five pounds.
Pork is a white and close meat, and it is almost impossible to
over-roast or cook it too much; when underdone it is exceedingly
unwholesome.
VENISON.
No. 1. Shoulder, used for roasting; it may be boned and stuffed,
then afterwards baked or roasted.
No. 2. Fore-loin, used for roasts and steaks.
No. 3. Haunch or loin, used for roasts, steaks, stews. The ribs
cut close may be used for soups. Good for pickling and making into
smoked venison.
No. 4. Breast, used for baking dishes, stewing.
No. 5. Scrag or neck, used for soups.
The choice of venison should be judged by the fat, which, when
the venison is young, should be thick, clear and close, and the
meat a very dark red. The flesh of a female deer about four years
old, is the sweetest and best of venison.
Buck venison, which is in season from June to the end of
September, is finer than doe venison, which is in season from
October to December. Neither should be dressed at any other time of
year, and no meat requires so much care as venison in killing,
preserving and dressing.
SIRLOIN OF BEEF.
This choice roasting-piece should be cut with one good firm
stroke from end to end of the joint, at the upper part, in thin,
long, even slices in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, cutting
across the grain, serving each guest with some of the fat with the
lean; this may be done by cutting a small, thin slice from
underneath the bone from 5 to 6, through the tenderloin.
Another way of carving this piece, and which will be of great
assistance in doing it well, is to insert the knife just above the
bone at the bottom, and run sharply along, dividing the meat from
the bone at the bottom and end, thus leaving it perfectly flat;
then carve in long, thin slices the usual way. When the bone has
been removed and the sirloin rolled before it is cooked, it is laid
upon the platter on one end, and an even, thin slice is carved
across the grain of the upper surface.
Roast ribs should be carved in thin, even slices from the thick
end towards the thin in the same manner as the sirloin; this can be
more easily and cleanly done if the carving knife is first run
along between the meat and the end and rib-bones, thus leaving it
free from bone to be cut into slices.
Tongue.—To carve this it should be cut crosswise,
the middle being the best; cut in very thin slices, thereby
improving its delicacy, making it more tempting; as is the case of
all well-carved meats. The root of the tongue is usually left on
the platter.
BREAST OF VEAL.
This piece is quite similar to a fore-quarter of lamb after the
shoulder has been taken off. A breast of veal consists of two
parts, the rib-bones and the gristly brisket. These parts may be
separated by sharply passing the carving knife in the direction of
the line from 1 to 2; and when they are entirely divided, the
rib-bones should be carved in the direction of the line from 5 to
6, and the brisket can be helped by cutting slices from 3 to 4.
The carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference
for the brisket or ribs; and if there be a sweetbread served with
the dish, as is frequently with this roast of veal, each person
should receive a piece.
Though veal and lamb contain less nutrition than beef and
mutton, in proportion to their weight, they are often preferred to
these latter meats on account of their delicacy of texture and
flavor. A whole breast of veal weighs from nine to twelve
pounds.
A FILLET OF VEAL.
A fillet of veal is one of the prime roasts of veal; it is taken
from the leg above the knuckle; a piece weighing from ten to twelve
pounds is a good size and requires about four hours for roasting.
Before roasting, it is dressed with a force meat or stuffing placed
in the cavity from where the bone was taken out and the flap
tightly secured together with skewers; many bind it together with
tape.
To carve it, cut in even thin slices off from the whole of the
upper part or top, in the same manner as from a rolled roast of
beef, as in the direction of the figs. 1 and 2; this gives the
person served some of the dressing with each slice of meat.
Veal is very unwholesome unless it is cooked thoroughly, and
when roasted should be of a rich brown color. Bacon, fried pork,
sausage-balls, with greens, are among the accompaniments of roasted
veal, also a cut lemon.
NECK OF VEAL.
The best end of a neck of veal makes a very good roasting-piece;
it, however, is composed of bone and ribs that make it quite
difficult to carve, unless it is done properly. To attempt to carve
each chop and serve it, you would not only place too large a
piece upon the plate of the person you intend to serve, but you
would waste much time, and should the vertebræ have not been
removed by the butcher, you would be compelled to exercise such a
degree of strength that would make one's appearance very
ungraceful, and possibly, too, throwing gravy over your neighbor
sitting next to you. The correct way to carve this roast is to cut
diagonally from fig. 1 to 2, and help in slices of moderate
thickness; then it may be cut from 3 to 4, in order to separate the
small bones; divide and serve them, having first inquired if they
are desired.
This joint is usually sent to the table accompanied by bacon,
ham, tongue, or pickled pork, on a separate dish and with a cut
lemon on a plate. There are also a number of sauces that are
suitable with this roast.
LEG OF MUTTON.
The best mutton, and that from which most nourishment is
obtained is that of sheep from three to six years old, and which
have been fed on dry, sweet pastures; then mutton is in its
prime, the flesh being firm, juicy, dark colored and full of
the richest gravy. When mutton is two years old, the meat is
flabby, pale and savorless.
In carving a roasted leg, the best slices are found by cutting
quite down to the bone, in the direction from 1 to 2, and slices
may be taken from either side.
Some very good cuts are taken from the broad end from 5 to 6,
and the fat on this ridge is very much liked by many. The
cramp-bone is a delicacy, and is obtained by cutting down to the
bone at 4, and running the knife under it in a semicircular
direction to 3. The nearer the knuckle the drier the meat, but the
under side contains the most finely grained meat, from which slices
may be cut lengthwise. When sent to the table a frill of paper
around the knuckle will improve its appearance.
FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.
The first cut to be made in carving a fore-quarter of lamb is to
separate the shoulder from the breast and ribs; this is done by
passing a sharp carving knife lightly around the dotted line as
shown by the figs. 3, 4 and 5, so as to cut through the skin, and
then, by raising with a little force the shoulder, into which the
fork should be firmly fixed, it will easily separate with just a
little more cutting with the knife; care should be taken not to cut
away too much of the meat from the breast when dividing the
shoulder from it, as that would mar its appearance. The shoulder
may be placed upon a separate dish for convenience. The next
process is to divide the ribs from the brisket by cutting through
the meat in the line from 1 to 2; then the ribs may be carved in
the direction of the line 6 to 7, and the brisket from 8 to 9. The
carver should always ascertain whether the guest prefers ribs,
brisket, or a piece of the shoulder.
HAM.
The carver in cutting a ham must be guided according as he
desires to practice economy, or have at once fine slices out of the
prime part. Under the first supposition, he will commence at the
knuckle end, and cut off thin slices toward the thick and upper
part of the ham.
To reach the choicer portion of the ham, the knife, which must
be very sharp and thin, should be carried quite down to the bone
through the thick fat in the direction of the line from 1 to 2. The
slices should be even and thin, cutting both lean and fat together,
always cutting down to the bone. Some cut a circular hole in the
middle of a ham gradually enlarging it outwardly. Then again many
carve a ham by first cutting from 1 to 2, then across the other way
from 3 to 4. Remove the skin after the ham is cooked and send to
the table with dots of dry pepper or dry mustard on the top, a tuft
of fringed paper twisted about the knuckle, and plenty of fresh
parsley around the dish. This will always insure an inviting
appearance.
Roast Pig.—The modern way of serving a pig is not
to send it to the table whole, but have it carved partially by the
cook; first, by dividing the shoulder from the body; then the leg
in the same manner; also separating the ribs into convenient
portions. The head may be divided and placed on the same platter.
To be served as hot as possible.
A Spare Rib of Pork is carved by cutting slices from the fleshy
part, after which the bones should be disjointed and separated.
A leg of pork may be carved in the same manner as a ham.
HAUNCH OF VENISON
A haunch of venison is the prime joint, and is carved
very similar to almost any roasted or boiled leg; it should be
first cut crosswise down to the bone following the line from 1 to
2; then turn the platter with the knuckle farthest from you, put in
the point of the knife, and cut down as far as you can, in the
directions shown by the dotted lines from 3 to 4; then there can be
taken out as many slices as is required on the right and left of
this. Slices of venison should be cut thin, and gravy given with
them, but as there is a special sauce made with red wine and
currant jelly to accompany this meat, do not serve gravy before
asking the guest if he pleases to have any.
The fat of this meat is like mutton, apt to cool soon, and
become hard and disagreeable to the palate; it should, therefore,
be served always on warm plates, and the platter kept over a
hot-water dish, or spirit lamp. Many cooks dish it up with a white
paper frill pinned around the knuckle bone.
A haunch of mutton is carved the same as a haunch of
venison.
TURKEY.
A turkey having been relieved from strings and skewers used in
trussing should be placed on the table with the head or neck at the
carver's right hand. An expert carver places the fork in the
turkey, and does not remove it until the whole is divided. First
insert the fork firmly in the lower part of the breast, just
forward of fig. 2, then sever the legs and wings on both sides, if
the whole is to be carved, cutting neatly through the joint next to
the body, letting these parts lie on the platter. Next, cut
downward from the breast from 2 to 3, as many even slices of the
white meat as may be desired, placing the pieces neatly on one side
of the platter. Now unjoint the legs and wings at the middle joint,
which can be done very skillfully by a little practice. Make an
opening into the cavity of the turkey for dipping out the inside
dressing, by cutting a piece from the rear part 1, 1, called the
apron. Consult the tastes of the guests as to which part is
preferred; if no choice is expressed, serve a portion of both light
and dark meat. One of the most delicate parts of the turkey are two
little muscles, lying in small dish-like cavities on each side of
the back, a little behind the leg attachments; the next most
delicate meat fills the cavities in the neck bone, and next to
this, that on the second joints. The lower part of the leg (or
drumstick, as it is called) being hard, tough and stringy, is
rarely ever helped to any one, but allowed to remain on the
dish.
ROAST GOOSE.
To carve a goose, first begin by separating the leg from the
body, by putting the fork into the small end of the limb, pressing
it closely to the body, then passing the knife under at 2, and
turning the leg back as you cut through the joint. To take off the
wing, insert the fork in the small end of the pinion, and press it
close to the body; put the knife in at fig. 1, and divide the
joint. When the legs and wings are off, the breast may be carved in
long, even slices, as represented in the lines from 1 to 2. The
back and lower side bones, as well as the two lower side bones by
the wing, may be cut off; but the best pieces of the goose are the
breast and thighs, after being separated from the drumsticks. Serve
a little of the dressing from the inside, by making a circular
slice in the apron at fig. 3. A goose should never be over a year
old; a tough goose is very difficult to carve, and certainly most
difficult to eat.
FOWLS.
First insert the knife between the leg and the body, and cut to
the bone; then turn the leg back with the fork, and if the fowl is
tender the joint will give away easily. The wing is broken off the
same way, only dividing the joint with the knife, in the direction
from 1 to 2. The four quarters having been removed in this way,
take off the merry-thought and the neck-bones; these last are to be
removed by putting the knife in at figs. 3 and 4, pressing it hard,
when they will break off from the part that sticks to the breast.
To separate the breast from the body of the fowl, cut through the
tender ribs close to the breast, quite down to the tail. Now turn
the fowl over, back upwards; put the knife into the bone midway
between the neck and the rump, and on raising the lower end it will
separate readily. Turn now the rump from you, and take off very
neatly the two side bones, and the fowl is carved. In separating
the thigh from the drumstick, the knife must be inserted exactly at
the joint, for if not accurately hit, some difficulty will be
experienced to get them apart; this is easily acquired by practice.
There is no difference in carving roast and [Pg 24]boiled
fowls if full grown; but in very young fowls the breast is usually
served whole; the wings and breast are considered the best parts,
but in young ones the legs are the most juicy. In the case of a
capon or large fowl, slices may be cut off at the breast, the same
as carving a pheasant.
ROAST DUCK.
A young duckling may be carved in the same manner as a fowl, the
legs and wings being taken off first on either side. When the duck
is full size, carve it like a goose; first cutting it in slices
from the breast, beginning close to the wing and proceeding upward
towards the breast bone, as is represented by the lines 1 to 2. An
opening may be made by cutting out a circular slice, as shown by
the dotted lines at number 3.
Some are fond of the feet, and when dressing the duck, these
should be neatly skinned and never removed. Wild duck is highly
esteemed by epicures; it is trussed like a tame duck, and carved in
the same manner, the breast being the choicest part.
PARTRIDGES.
Partridges are generally cleaned and trussed the same way as a
pheasant, but the custom of cooking them with the heads on is going
into disuse somewhat. The usual way of carving them is similar to a
pigeon, dividing it into two equal parts. Another method is to cut
it into three pieces, by severing a wing and leg on either side
from the body, by following the lines 1 to 2, thus making two
servings of those parts, leaving the breast for a third plate. The
third method is to thrust back the body from the legs, and cut
through the middle of the breast, thus making four portions that
may be served. Grouse and prairie-chicken are carved from the
breast when they are large, and quartered or halved when of medium
size.
PHEASANT.
Place your fork firmly in the centre of the breast of this large
game bird and cut deep slices to the bone at figs. 1 and 2; then
take off the leg in the line from 3 and 4, and the wing 3 and 5,
severing both sides the same. In taking off the wings, be careful
not to cut too near the neck; if you do you will hit upon the
neck-bone, from which the wing must be separated. Pass the knife
through the line 6, and under the merry-thought towards the neck,
which will detach it. Cut the other parts as in a fowl. The breast,
wings and merry-thought of a pheasant are the most highly prized,
although the legs are considered very finely flavored. Pheasants
are frequently roasted with the head left on; in that case, when
dressing them, bring the head round under the wing, and fix it on
the point of a skewer.
PIGEONS.
A very good way of carving these birds is to insert the knife at
fig. 1, and cut both ways to 2 and 3, when each portion may be
divided into two pieces, then served. Pigeons, if not too large,
may be cut in halves, either across or down the middle, cutting
them into two equal parts; if young and small they may be served
entirely whole.
Tame pigeons should be cooked as soon as possible after they are
killed, as they very quickly lose their flavor. Wild pigeons, on
the contrary, should hang a day or two in a cool place before they
are dressed. Oranges cut into halves are used as a garnish for
dishes of small birds, such as pigeons, quail, woodcock, squabs,
snipe, etc. These small birds are either served whole or split down
the back, making two servings.
MACKEREL.
The mackerel is one of the most beautiful of fish, being known
by its silvery whiteness. It sometimes attains to the length of
twenty inches, but usually, when fully grown, is about fourteen or
sixteen inches long, and about two pounds in weight. To carve a
baked mackerel, first remove the head and tail by cutting downward
at 1 and 2; then split them down the back, so as to serve each
person a part of each side piece. The roe should be divided in
small pieces and served with each piece of fish. Other whole fish
may be carved in the same manner. The fish is laid upon a little
sauce or folded napkin, on a hot dish, and garnished with
parsley.
BOILED SALMON.
This fish is seldom sent to the table whole, being too
large for any ordinary sized family; the middle cut is considered
the choicest to boil. To carve it, first run the knife down and
along the upper side of the fish from 1 to 2, then again on the
lower side from 3 to 4. Serve the thick part, cutting it lengthwise
in slices in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, and the thin
part breadthwise, or in the direction from 5 to 6. A slice of the
thick with one of the thin, where lies the fat, should be served to
each guest. Care should be taken when carving not to break the
flakes of the fish, as that impairs its appearance. The flesh of
the salmon is rich and delicious in flavor. Salmon is in season
from the first of February to the end of August.
Consommé, or Stock, forms the basis of all meat soups,
and also of all principal sauces. It is, therefore, essential to
the success of these culinary operations to know the most complete
and economical method of extracting from a certain quantity of meat
the best possible stock or broth. Fresh, uncooked beef makes the
best stock, with the addition of cracked bones, as the glutinous
matter contained in them renders it important that they should be
boiled with the meat, which adds to the strength and thickness of
the soup. They are composed of an earthy substance—to which
they owe their solidity—of gelatine, and a fatty fluid,
something like marrow. Two ounces of them contain as much
gelatine as one pound of meat; but, in them, this is so
encased in the earthy substance, that boiling water can dissolve
only the surface of the whole bones, but by breaking them they can
be dissolved more. When there is an abundance of it, it causes the
stock, when cold, to become a jelly. The flesh of old animals
contains more flavor than the flesh of young ones. Brown meats
contain more flavor than white.
Mutton is too strong in flavor for good stock, while veal,
although quite glutinous, furnishes very little nutriment.
Some cooks use meat that has once been cooked; this renders
little nourishment and destroys the flavor. It might answer for
ready soup, but for stock to keep it is not as good, unless it
should be roasted meats. Those contain higher fragrant properties;
so by putting the remains of roast meats in the stock-pot you
obtain a better flavor.
The shin bone is generally used, but the neck or
"sticking-piece," as the butchers call it, contains more of the
substance that you want to extract, makes a stronger and more
nutritious soup, than any other part of the animal. Meats for soup
should always be put on to cook in cold water, in a covered
pot, and allowed to simmer slowly for several [Pg 28]hours,
in order that the essence of the meat may be drawn out thoroughly,
and should be carefully skimmed to prevent it from becoming turbid,
never allowed to boil fast at any time, and if more water is
needed, use boiling water from the tea-kettle; cold or lukewarm
water spoils the flavor. Never salt it before the meat is tender
(as that hardens and toughens the meat), especially if the meat is
to be eaten. Take off every particle of scum as it rises, and
before the vegetables are put in.
Allow a little less than a quart of water to a pound of meat and
bone, and a teaspoonful of salt. When done, strain through a
colander. If for clear soups, strain again through a hair sieve, or
fold a clean towel in a colander set over an earthen bowl, or any
dish large enough to hold the stock. As stated before, stock is not
as good when made entirely from cooked meats, but in a family where
it requires a large joint roasted every day, the bones, and bits
and underdone pieces of beef, or the bony structure of turkey or
chicken that has been left from carving, bones of roasted poultry,
these all assist in imparting a rich dark color to soup, and would
be sufficient, if stewed as above, to furnish a family, without
buying fresh meat for the purpose; still, with the addition of a
little fresh meat it would be more nutritious. In cold weather you
can gather them up for several days and put them to cook in cold
water, and when done, strain, and put aside until needed.
Soup will be as good the second day as the first if heated to
the boiling point. It should never be left in the pot, but should
be turned into a dish or shallow pan, and set aside to get cold.
Never cover it up, as that will cause it to turn sour very
quickly.
Before heating a second time, remove all the fat from the top.
If this be melted in, the flavor of the soup will certainly be
spoiled.
Thickened soups require nearly double the seasoning used for
thin soups or broth.
Coloring is used in some brown soups, the chief of which is
brown burnt sugar, which is known as caramel by French cooks.
Pounded spinach leaves give a fine green color to soup. Parsley,
or the green leaves of celery put in soup, will serve instead of
spinach.
Pound a large handful of spinach in a mortar, then tie it in a
cloth, and wring out all the juice; put this in the soup you wish
to color green five minutes before taking it up.
Mock turtle, and sometimes veal and lamb soups, should be this
color.
Okras gives a green color to soup.
To color soup red, skin six red tomatoes, squeeze out the seeds,
and put them into the soup with the other vegetables—or take
the juice only, as directed for spinach.
For white soups, which are of veal, lamb or chicken, none but
white vegetables are used; rice, pearl barley, vermicelli, or
macaroni, for thickening.
Grated carrot gives a fine amber color to soup; it must be put
in as soon as the soup is free from scum.
Hotel and private-house stock is quite different.
Hotels use meat in such large quantities that there is always
more or less trimmings and bones of meat to add to fresh meats;
that makes very strong stock, which they use in most all soups and
gravies and other made dishes.
The meat from which soup has been made is good to serve cold
thus: Take out all the bones, season with pepper and salt, and
catsup, if liked, then chop it small, tie it in a cloth, and lay it
between two plates, with a weight on the upper one; slice it thin
for luncheon or supper; or make sandwiches of it; or make a hash
for breakfast; or make it into balls, with the addition of a little
wheat flour and an egg, and serve them fried in fat, or boil in the
soup.
An agreeable flavor is sometimes imparted to soup by sticking
some cloves into the meat used for making stock; a few slices of
onions fried very brown in butter are nice; also flour browned by
simply putting it into a saucepan over the fire and stirring it
constantly until it is a dark brown.
Clear soups must be perfectly transparent, and thickened soups
about the consistency of cream. When soups and gravies are kept
from day to day in hot weather, they should be warmed up every day,
and put into fresh-scalded pans or tureens, and placed in a cool
cellar. In temperate weather, every other day may be
sufficient.
HERBS AND VEGETABLES USED IN SOUPS.
Of vegetables the principal ones are carrots, tomatoes,
asparagus, green peas, okra, macaroni, green corn, beans, rice,
vermicelli, Scotch barley, pearl barley, wheat flour, mushroom, or
mushroom catsup, [Pg 30]parsnips, beetroot, turnips, leeks,
garlic, shallots and onions; sliced onions fried with butter and
flour until they are browned, then rubbed through a sieve, are
excellent to heighten the color and flavor of brown sauces and
soups. The herbs usually used in soups are parsley, common thyme,
summer savory, knotted marjoram, and other seasonings, such as
bay-leaves, tarragon, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, mace,
black and white pepper, red pepper, lemon peel and juice, orange
peel and juice. The latter imparts a finer flavor and the acid much
milder. These materials, with wine, and the various catsups,
combined in various proportions, are, with other ingredients, made
into almost an endless variety of excellent soups and gravies.
Soups that are intended for the principal part of a meal certainly
ought not to be flavored like sauces, which are only intended to
give relish to some particular dish.
STOCK.
Six pounds of shin of beef, or six pounds of knuckle of veal;
any bones, trimmings of poultry, or fresh meat; one-quarter pound
of lean bacon or ham, two ounces of butter, two large onions, each
stuck with cloves; one turnip, three carrots, one head of celery,
two ounces of salt, one-half teaspoonful of whole pepper, one large
blade of mace, one bunch of savory herbs except sage, four quarts
and one-half-pint of cold water.
Cut up the meat and bacon, or ham, into pieces of about three
inches square; break the bones into small pieces, rub the butter on
the bottom of the stewpan; put in one-half a pint of water, the
broken bones, then meat and all other ingredients. Cover the
stewpan, and place it on a sharp fire, occasionally stirring its
contents. When the bottom of the pan becomes covered with a pale,
jelly-like substance, add the four quarts of cold water, and simmer
very gently for five or six hours. As we have said before, do not
let it boil quickly. When nearly cooked, throw in a tablespoonful
of salt to assist the scum to rise. Remove every particle of scum
whilst it is doing, and strain it through a fine hair sieve; when
cool remove all grease. This stock will keep for many days in cold
weather.
Stock is the basis of many of the soups afterwards mentioned,
and this will be found quite strong enough for ordinary purposes.
Keep it in small jars, in a cool place. It makes a good gravy for
hash meats; one tablespoonful of it is sufficient to impart a fine
flavor to a dish of macaroni and various other dishes. Good soups
of various kinds are made from it at short notice; slice off a
portion of the jelly, add water, and whatever vegetables and
thickening preferred. It is best to partly cook the vegetables
before adding to the stock, as much boiling injures the flavoring
of the soup. Season and boil a few moments and serve hot.
WHITE STOCK.
White stock is used in the preparation of white soups, and is
made by boiling six pounds of a knuckle of veal, cut up in small
pieces, poultry trimmings, and four slices of lean ham. Proceed
according to directions given in STOCK, on opposite page.
TO CLARIFY STOCK.
Place the stock in a clean saucepan, set it over a brisk fire.
When boiling, add the white of one egg to each quart of stock,
proceeding as follows: beat the whites of the eggs up well in a
little water; then add a little hot stock; beat to a froth and pour
gradually into the pot; then beat the whole hard and long; allow it
to boil up once, and immediately remove and strain through a thin
flannel cloth.
BEEF SOUP.
Select a small shin of beef of moderate size, crack the bone in
small pieces, wash and place it in a kettle to boil, with five or
six quarts of cold water. Let it boil about two hours, or
until it begins to get tender, then season it with a tablespoonful
of salt, and a teaspoonful of pepper; boil it one hour longer, then
add to it one carrot, two turnips, two tablespoonfuls of rice or
pearl barley, one head of celery, and a teaspoonful of summer
savory powdered fine; the vegetables to be minced up in small
pieces like dice. After these ingredients have boiled a quarter of
an hour, put in two potatoes cut up in small pieces, let it boil
half an hour longer; take the meat from the soup, and if intended
to be served with it, take out the bones and lay it closely and
neatly on a dish, and garnish with sprigs of parsley.
Serve made mustard and catsup with it. It is very nice pressed
and eaten cold with mustard and vinegar, or catsup. Four hours are
required for making this soup. Should any remain over the first
day, [Pg 32]it may be heated, with the addition of a little
boiling water, and served again. Some fancy a glass of brown sherry
added just before being served. Serve very hot.
VEAL SOUP. (Excellent.)
Put a knuckle of veal into three quarts of cold water, with a
small quantity of salt, and one small tablespoonful of uncooked
rice. Boil slowly, hardly above simmering, four hours, when the
liquor should be reduced to half the usual quantity; remove from
the fire. Into the tureen put the yolk of one egg, and stir well
into it a teacupful of cream, or, in hot weather, new milk; add a
piece of butter the size of a hickory nut; on this strain the soup,
boiling hot, stirring all the time. Just at the last, beat it well
for a minute.
SCOTCH MUTTON BROTH.
Six pounds neck of mutton, three quarts water, five carrots,
five turnips, two onions, four tablespoonfuls barley, a little
salt. Soak mutton in water for an hour, cut off scrag, and put it
in stewpan with three quarts of water. As soon as it boils, skim
well, and then simmer for one and one-half hours. Cut best end of
mutton into cutlets, dividing it with two bones in each; take off
nearly all fat before you put it into broth; skim the moment the
meat boils, and every ten minutes afterwards; add carrots, turnips
and onions, all cut into two or three pieces, then put them into
soup soon enough to be thoroughly done; stir in barley; add salt to
taste; let all stew together for three and one-half hours; about
one-half hour before sending it to table, put in little chopped
parsley and serve.
Cut the meat off the scrag into small pieces, and send it to
table in the tureen with the soup. The other half of the mutton
should be served on a separate dish, with whole turnips boiled and
laid round it. Many persons are fond of mutton that has been boiled
in soup.
You may thicken the soup with rice or barley that has first been
soaked in cold water, or with green peas, or with young corn, cut
down from the cob, or with tomatoes, scalded, peeled and cut into
pieces.
GAME SOUP.
Two grouse or partridges, or, if you have neither, use a pair of
rabbits; half a [Pg 33]pound of lean ham; two medium-sized
onions; one pound of lean beef; fried bread; butter for frying;
pepper, salt and two stalks of white celery cut into inch lengths;
three quarts of water.
Joint your game neatly; cut the ham and onions into small
pieces, fry all in butter to a light brown. Put into a soup-pot
with the beef, cut into strips, add a little pepper. Pour on the
water; heat slowly, and stew gently two hours. Take out the pieces
of bird, and cover in a bowl; cook the soup an hour longer; strain;
cool; drop in the celery and simmer ten minutes. Pour upon fried
bread in the tureen.
Venison soup made the same, with the addition of a tablespoonful
of brown flour wet into a paste with cold water, adding a
tablespoonful of catsup, Worcestershire, or other pungent sauce,
and a glass of Madeira or brown sherry.
CONSOMMÉ SOUP.
Take good strong stock (see pages 27 and 30), remove all fat
from the surface, and for each quart of the stock allow the white
and shell of one egg and a tablespoonful of water, well whipped
together. Pour this mixture into a saucepan containing the stock;
place it over the fire and heat the contents gradually, stirring
often to prevent the egg from sticking to the bottom of the
saucepan. Allow it to boil gently until the stock looks perfectly
clear under the egg, which will rise and float upon the surface in
the form of a thick white scum. Now remove it and pour it into a
folded towel laid in a colander set over an earthen bowl, allowing
it to run through without moving or squeezing it. Season with more
salt if needed, and quickly serve very hot. This should be a clear
amber color.
JULIENNE SOUP.
Cut carrots and turnips into quarter-inch pieces the shape of
dice; also celery into thin slices. Cover them with boiling water;
add a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful pepper, and cook
until soft. In another saucepan have two quarts of boiling stock
(see pages 27 and 30), to which add the cooked vegetables, the
water and more seasoning if necessary. Serve hot.
In the spring and summer season use asparagus, peas and string
beans—all cut into small uniform thickness.
CREAM OF SPINACH.
Pick, wash and boil enough spinach to measure a pint, when
cooked, chopped and pounded into a soft paste. Put it into a
stewpan with four ounces of fresh butter, a little grated nutmeg, a
teaspoonful of salt. Cook and stir it about ten minutes. Add to
this two quarts of strong stock (see pages 27 and 30); let boil up,
then rub it through a strainer. Set it over the fire again, and,
when on the point of boiling, mix with it a tablespoonful of
butter, and a teaspoonful of granulated sugar.
CHICKEN CREAM SOUP.
An old chicken for soup is much the best. Cut it up into
quarters, put it into a soup kettle with half a pound of corned
ham, and an onion; add four quarts of cold water. Bring slowly to a
gentle boil, and keep this up until the liquid has diminished
one-third, and the meat drops from the bones; then add half a cup
of rice. Season with salt, pepper and a bunch of chopped
parsley.
Cook slowly until the rice is tender, then the meat should be
taken out. Now stir in two cups of rich milk thickened with a
little flour. The chicken could be fried in a spoonful of butter
and a gravy made, reserving some of the white part of the meat,
chopping it and adding it to the soup.
PLAIN ECONOMICAL SOUP.
Take a cold roast-beef bone, pieces of beefsteak, the rack of a
cold turkey or chicken. Put them into a pot with three or four
quarts of water, two carrots, three turnips, one onion, a few
cloves, pepper and salt. Boil the whole gently four hours; then
strain it through a colander, mashing the vegetables so that they
will all pass through. Skim off the fat, and return the soup to the
pot. Mix one tablespoonful of flour with two of water, stir it into
the soup and boil the whole ten minutes. Serve this soup with
sippits of toast.
Sippits are bits of dry toast cut into a triangular form.
A seasonable dish about the holidays.
OX-TAIL SOUP.
Two ox-tails, two slices of ham, one ounce of butter, two
carrots, two turnips, three onions, one leek, one head of celery,
one bunch of savory herbs, pepper, a tablespoonful of salt, two
tablespoonfuls of catsup, one-half glass of port wine, three quarts
of water.
Cut up the tails, separating them at the joints; wash them, and
put them in a stewpan with the butter. Cut the vegetables in slices
and add them with the herbs. Put in one-half pint of water, and
stir it over a quick fire till the juices are drawn. Fill up the
stewpan with water, and, when boiling, add the salt. Skim well, and
simmer very gently for four hours, or until the tails are tender.
Take them out, skim and strain the soup, thicken with flour, and
flavor with the catsup and port wine. Put back the tails, simmer
for five minutes and serve.
Another way to make an appetizing ox-tail soup. You should begin
to make it the day before you wish to eat the soup. Take two tails,
wash clean, and put in a kettle with nearly a gallon of cold water;
add a small handful of salt; when the meat is well cooked, take out
the bones. Let this stand in a cool room, covered, and next day,
about an hour and a half before dinner, skim off the crust or cake
of fat which has risen to the top. Add a little onion, carrot, or
any vegetables you choose, chopping them fine first; summer savory
may also be added.
CORN SOUP.
Cut the corn from the cob, and boil the cobs in water for at
least an hour, then add the grains, and boil until they are
thoroughly done; put one dozen ears of corn to a gallon of water,
which will be reduced to three quarts by the time the soup is done;
then pour on a pint of new milk, two well-beaten eggs, salt and
pepper to your taste; continue the boiling a while longer, and stir
in, to season and thicken it a little, a tablespoonful of good
butter rubbed up with two tablespoonfuls of flour. Corn soup may
also be made nicely with water in which a pair of grown fowls have
been boiled or parboiled, instead of having plain water for the
foundation.
SPLIT PEA SOUP. No. 1.
Wash well a pint of split peas and cover them well with cold
water, adding a third of a teaspoonful of soda; let them remain in
it over night to swell. In the morning put them in a kettle with a
close fitting cover. Pour over them three quarts of cold water,
adding half a pound of lean ham or bacon cut into slices or pieces;
also a teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper, and some celery
chopped fine. When the soup begins to boil, skim the froth from the
surface. Cook slowly from three to four hours, stirring
occasionally till the peas are [Pg
36]all dissolved, adding
a little more boiling water to keep up the quantity as it boils
away. Strain through a colander, and leave out the meat. It should
be quite quick. Serve with small squares of toasted bread, cut up
and added. If not rich enough, add a small piece of butter.
CREAM OF ASPARAGUS.
For making two quarts of soup, use two bundles of fresh
asparagus. Cut the tops from one of the bunches and cook them
twenty minutes in salted water, enough to cover them. Cook the
remainder of the asparagus about twenty minutes in a quart of stock
or water. Cut an onion into thin slices and fry in three
tablespoonfuls of butter ten minutes, being careful not to scorch
it; then add the asparagus that has been boiled in the stock; cook
this five minutes, stirring constantly; then add three
tablespoonfuls of dissolved flour, cook five minutes longer. Turn
this mixture into the boiling stock and boil twenty minutes. Rub
through a sieve; add the milk and cream and the asparagus heads. If
water is used in place of stock, use all cream.
GREEN PEA SOUP.
Wash a small quarter of lamb in cold water, and put it into a
soup-pot with six quarts of cold water; add to it two
tablespoonfuls of salt, and set it over a moderate fire—let
it boil gently for two hours, then skim it clear; add a quart of
shelled peas, and a teaspoonful of pepper; cover it, and let it
boil for half an hour; then having scraped the skins from a quart
of small young potatoes, add them to the soup; cover the pot and
let it boil for half an hour longer; work quarter of a pound of
butter and a dessertspoonful of flour together, and add them to the
soup ten or twelve minutes before taking it off the fire.
Serve the meat on a dish with parsley sauce over it, and the
soup in a tureen.
DRIED BEAN SOUP.
Put two quarts of dried white beans to soak the night before you
make the soup, which should be put on as early in the day as
possible.
Take two pounds of the lean of fresh beef—the coarse
pieces will do. Cut them up and put them into your soup-pot with
the bones belonging to them (which should be broken in pieces), and
a pound of lean bacon, cut very small. If you have the remains of a
piece of beef [Pg 37]that has been roasted the day before, and so much
underdone that the juices remain in it, you may put it into the pot
and its bones along with it. Season the meat with pepper only, and
pour on it six quarts of water. As soon as it boils, take off the
scum, and put in the beans (having first drained them) and a head
of celery cut small, or a tablespoonful of pounded celery seed.
Boil it slowly till the meat is done to shreds, and the beans all
dissolved. Then strain it through a colander into the tureen, and
put into it small squares of toasted bread with the crust cut
off.
TURTLE SOUP FROM BEANS.
Soak over night one quart of black beans; next day boil them in
the proper quantity of water, say a gallon, then dip the beans out
of the pot and strain them through a colander. Then return the
flour of the beans, thus pressed, into the pot in which they were
boiled. Tie up in a thin cloth some thyme, a teaspoonful of summer
savory and parsley, and let it boil in the mixture. Add a
tablespoonful of cold butter, salt and pepper. Have ready four
hard-boiled yolks of eggs quartered, and a few force meat balls;
add this to the soup with a sliced lemon, and half a glass of wine
just before serving the soup.
This approaches so near in flavor to the real turtle soup that
few are able to distinguish the difference.
PHILADELPHIA PEPPER POT.
Put two pounds of tripe and four calves' feet into the soup-pot
and cover them with cold water; add a red pepper, and boil closely
until the calves' feet are boiled very tender; take out the meat,
skim the liquid, stir it, cut the tripe into small pieces, and put
it back into the liquid; if there is not enough liquid, add boiling
water; add half a teaspoonful of sweet marjoram, sweet basil, and
thyme, two sliced onions, sliced potatoes, salt. When the
vegetables have boiled until almost tender, add a piece of butter
rolled in flour, drop in some egg balls, and boil fifteen minutes
more. Take up and serve hot.
SQUIRREL SOUP.
Wash and quarter three or four good sized squirrels; put them
on, with a small tablespoonful of salt, directly after breakfast,
in a gallon of cold water. Cover the pot close, and set it on the
back part [Pg 38]of the stove to simmer gently, not boil. Add
vegetables just the same as you do in case of other meat soups in
the summer season, but especially good will you find corn, Irish
potatoes, tomatoes and Lima beans. Strain the soup through a coarse
colander when the meat has boiled to shreds, so as to get rid of
the squirrels' troublesome little bones. Then return to the pot,
and after boiling a while longer, thicken with a piece of butter
rubbed in flour. Celery and parsley leaves chopped up are also
considered an improvement by many. Toast two slices of bread, cut
them into dice one-half inch square, fry them in butter, put them
into the bottom of your tureen, and then pour the soup boiling hot
upon them. Very good.
TOMATO SOUP. No. 1.
Place in a kettle four pounds of beef. Pour over it one gallon
of cold water. Let the meat and water boil slowly for three hours,
or until the liquid is reduced to about one-half. Remove the meat
and put into the broth a quart of tomatoes, and one chopped onion;
salt and pepper to taste. A teaspoonful of flour should be
dissolved and stirred in, then allowed to boil half an hour longer.
Strain and serve hot. Canned tomatoes in place of fresh ones may be
used.
TOMATO SOUP. No. 2.
Place over the fire a quart of peeled tomatoes, stew them soft
with a pinch of soda. Strain it so that no seeds remain, set it
over the fire again, and add a quart of hot boiled milk; season
with salt and pepper, a piece of butter the size of an egg, add
three tablespoonfuls of rolled cracker, and serve hot. Canned
tomatoes may be used in place of fresh ones.
TOMATO SOUP. No. 3.
Peel two quarts of tomatoes, boil them in a saucepan with an
onion, and other soup vegetables; strain and add a level
tablespoonful of flour dissolved in a third of a cup of melted
butter; add pepper and salt. Serve very hot over little squares of
bread fried brown and crisp in butter.
An excellent addition to a cold meat lunch.
MULLAGATAWNY SOUP. (As made in India.)
Cut four onions, one carrot, two turnips, and one head of celery
into three quarts of liquor, in which one or two fowls have been
[Pg 39]boiled; keep it over a brisk fire till it boils, then
place it on a corner of the fire, and let it simmer twenty minutes;
add one tablespoonful of currie powder, and one tablespoonful of
flour; mix the whole well together, and let it boil three minutes;
pass it through a colander; serve with pieces of roast chicken in
it; add boiled rice in a separate dish. It must be of good yellow
color, and not too thick. If you find it too thick, add a little
boiling water and a teaspoonful of sugar. Half veal and half
chicken answers as well.
A dish of rice, to be served separately with this soup, must be
thus prepared: put three pints of water in a saucepan and one
tablespoonful of salt; let this boil. Wash well, in three waters,
half a pound of rice; strain it, and put it into the boiling water
in saucepan. After it has come to the boil—which it will do
in about two minutes—let it boil twenty minutes; strain it
through a colander, and pour over it two quarts of cold water. This
will separate the grains of rice. Put it back in the saucepan, and
place it near the fire until hot enough to send to the table. This
is also the proper way to boil rice for curries. If these
directions are strictly carried out every grain of the rice will
separate, and be thoroughly cooked.
MOCK TURTLE SOUP, OF CALF'S HEAD.
Scald a well-cleansed calf's head, remove the brain, tie it up
in a cloth, and boil an hour, or until the meat will easily slip
from the bone; take out, save the broth; cut it in small square
pieces, and throw them into cold water; when cool, put it in a
stewpan, and cover with some of the broth; let it boil until quite
tender, and set aside.
In another stewpan melt some butter, and in it put a quarter of
a pound of lean ham, cut small, with fine herbs to taste; also
parsley and one onion; add about a pint of the broth; let it simmer
for two hours, and then dredge in a small quantity of flour; now
add the remainder of the broth, and a quarter bottle of Madeira or
sherry; let all stew quietly for ten minutes and rub it through a
medium sieve; add the calf's head, season with a very little
cayenne pepper, a little salt, the juice of one lemon, and, if
desired, a quarter teaspoonful pounded mace and a dessert-spoon
sugar.
Having previously prepared force meat balls, add them to the
soup, and five minutes after serve hot.
GREEN TURTLE SOUP.
One turtle, two onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, juice of one
lemon, five quarts of water, a glass of Madeira.
After removing the entrails, cut up the coarser parts of the
turtle meat and bones. Add four quarts of water, and stew four
hours with the herbs, onions, pepper and salt. Stew very slowly, do
not let it cease boiling during this time. At the end of four hours
strain the soup, and add the finer parts of the turtle and the
green fat, which has been simmered one hour in two quarts of water.
Thicken with brown flour; return to the soup-pot, and simmer gently
for an hour longer. If there are eggs in the turtle, boil them in a
separate vessel for four hours, and throw into the soup before
taking up. If not, put in force meat balls; then the juice of the
lemon, and the wine; beat up at once and pour out.
Some cooks add the finer meat before straining, boiling all
together five hours; then strain, thicken and put in the green fat,
cut into lumps an inch long. This makes a handsomer soup than if
the meat is left in.
Green turtle can now be purchased preserved in air-tight
cans.
Force Meat Balls for the Above.—Six tablespoonfuls
of turtle meat chopped very fine. Rub to a paste, with the yolk of
two hard-boiled eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, and, if
convenient, a little oyster liquor. Season with cayenne, mace, half
a teaspoonful of white sugar and a pinch of salt. Bind all with a
well-beaten egg; shape into small balls; dip in egg, then powdered
cracker; fry in butter, and drop into the soup when it is
served.
MACARONI SOUP.
To a rich beef or other soup, in which there is no seasoning
other than pepper or salt, take half a pound of small pipe
macaroni, boil it in clear water until it is tender, then drain it
and cut it in pieces of an inch length; boil it for fifteen minutes
in the soup and serve.
TURKEY SOUP.
Take the turkey bones and boil three-quarters of an hour in
water enough to cover them; add a little summer savory and celery
chopped fine. Just before serving, thicken with a little flour
(browned), and [Pg 41]season with pepper, salt and a small
piece of butter. This is a cheap but good soup, using the remains
of cold turkey which might otherwise be thrown away.
GUMBO OR OKRA SOUP.
Fry out the fat of a slice of bacon or fat ham, drain it off,
and in it fry the slices of a large onion brown; scald, peel and
cut up two quarts fresh tomatoes, when in season (use canned
tomatoes otherwise), and cut thin one quart okra; put them,
together with a little chopped parsley, in a stew-kettle with about
three quarts of hot broth of any kind; cook slowly for three hours,
season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
In chicken broth the same quantity of okra pods, used for
thickening instead of tomatoes, forms a chicken gumbo soup.
TAPIOCA CREAM SOUP.
One quart of white stock; one pint of cream or milk; one onion;
two stalks celery; one-third of a cupful of tapioca; two cupfuls of
cold water; one tablespoonful of butter; a small piece of mace;
salt, pepper. Wash the tapioca and soak over night in cold water.
Cook it and the stock together very gently for one hour. Cut the
onion and celery into small pieces, and put on to cook for twenty
minutes with the milk and mace. Strain on the tapioca and stock.
Season with salt and pepper, add butter and serve.
ONION SOUP.
One quart of milk, six large onions, yolks of four eggs, three
tablespoonfuls of butter, a large one of flour, one cup full of
cream, salt, pepper. Put the butter in a frying pan. Cut the onions
into thin slices and drop in the butter. Stir until they begin to
cook; then cover tight and set back where they will simmer, but not
burn, for half an hour. Now put the milk on to boil, and then add
the dry flour to the onions and stir constantly for three minutes
over the fire; then turn the mixture into the milk and cook fifteen
minutes. Rub the [Pg 42]soup through a strainer, return to the
fire, season with salt and pepper. Beat the yolks of the eggs well,
add the cream to them and stir into the soup. Cook three minutes,
stirring constantly. If you have no cream, use milk, in which case
add a tablespoonful of butter at the same time. Pour over fried
croutons in a soup tureen.
This is a refreshing dish when one is fatigued.
WINTER VEGETABLE SOUP.
Scrape and slice three turnips and three carrots and peel three
onions, and fry all with a little butter until a light yellow; add
a bunch of celery and three or four leeks cut in pieces; stir and
fry all the ingredients for six minutes; when fried, add one clove
of garlic, two stalks of parsley, two cloves, salt, pepper and a
little grated nutmeg; cover with three quarts of water and simmer
for three hours, taking off the scum carefully. Strain and use.
Croutons, vermicelli, Italian pastes, or rice may be added.
VERMICELLI SOUP.
Swell quarter of a pound of vermicelli in a quart of warm water,
then add it to a good beef, veal, lamb, or chicken soup or broth,
with quarter of a pound of sweet butter; let the soup boil for
fifteen minutes after it is added.
SWISS WHITE SOUP.
A sufficient quantity of broth for six people; boil it; beat up
three eggs well, two spoonfuls of flour, one cup milk; pour these
gradually through a sieve into the boiling soup; salt and
pepper.
SPRING VEGETABLE SOUP.
Half pint green peas, two shredded lettuces, one onion, a small
bunch of parsley, two ounces butter, the yolks of three eggs, one
pint of water, one and a half quarts of soup stock. Put in a
stewpan the lettuce, onion, parsley and butter, with one pint of
water, and let them simmer till tender. Season with salt and
pepper. When done, strain off the vegetables, and put two-thirds of
the liquor with the stock. Beat up the yolks of the eggs with the
other third, toss it over the fire, and at the moment of serving
add this with the vegetables to the strained-off soup.
CELERY SOUP.
Celery soup may be made with white stock. Cut down the
white of half a dozen heads of celery into little pieces and boil
it in four pints of white stock, with a quarter of a pound of lean
ham and two ounces of butter. Simmer gently for a full hour, then
strain through a sieve, return the liquor to the pan, and stir in a
few spoonfuls of cream with great care. Serve with toasted bread,
and if liked, thicken with a little flour. Season to taste.
IRISH POTATO SOUP.
Peel and boil eight medium-sized potatoes with a large onion
sliced, some herbs, salt and pepper; press all through a colander;
then thin it with rich milk and add a lump of butter, more
seasoning, if necessary; let it heat well and serve hot.
PEA SOUP.
Put a quart of dried peas into five quarts of water; boil for
four hours; then add three or four large onions, two heads of
celery, a carrot, two turnips, all cut up rather fine. Season with
pepper and salt. Boil two hours longer, and if the soup becomes too
thick add more water. Strain through a colander and stir in a
tablespoonful of cold butter. Serve hot, with small pieces of
toasted bread placed in the bottom of the tureen.
NOODLES FOR SOUP.
Beat up one egg light, add a pinch of salt, and flour enough to
make a very stiff dough; roll out very thin, like thin pie
crust, dredge with flour to keep from sticking. Let it remain on
the bread board to dry for an hour or more; then roll it up into a
tight scroll, like a sheet of music. Begin at the end and slice it
into slips as thin as straws. After all are cut, mix them lightly
together, and to prevent them sticking, keep them floured a little
until you are ready to drop them into your soup which should be
done shortly before dinner, for if boiled too long they will
go to pieces.
FORCE MEAT BALLS FOR SOUP.
One cupful of cooked veal or fowl meat, minced; mix with this a
handful of fine bread crumbs, the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs
[Pg 44]rubbed smooth together with a tablespoon of milk;
season with pepper and salt; add a half teaspoon of flour, and bind
all together with two beaten eggs; the hands to be well floured,
and the mixture to be made into little balls the size of a nutmeg;
drop into the soup about twenty minutes before serving.
EGG BALLS FOR SOUP.
Take the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs and half a tablespoonful
of wheat flour, rub them smooth with the yolks of two raw eggs and
a teaspoonful of salt; mix all well together; make it in balls, and
drop them into the boiling soup a few minutes before taking it
up.
Used in green turtle soup.
EGG DUMPLINGS FOR SOUP.
To half a pint of milk put two well-beaten eggs, and as much
wheat flour as will make a smooth, rather thick batter free
from lumps; drop this batter, a tablespoonful at a time, into
boiling soup.
Another Mode.—One cupful of sour cream and one
cupful of sour milk, three eggs, well beaten, whites and yolks
separately; one teaspoonful of salt, one level teaspoonful of soda,
dissolved in a spoonful of water, and enough flour added to make a
very stiff batter. To be dropped by spoonfuls into the broth
and boiled twenty minutes, or until no raw dough shows on the
outside.
SUET DUMPLINGS FOR SOUP.
Three cups of sifted flour in which three teaspoonfuls of baking
powder have been sifted; one cup of finely chopped suet, well
rubbed into the flour, with a teaspoonful of salt. Wet all with
sweet milk to make a dough as stiff as biscuit. Make into small
balls as large as peaches, well floured. Drop into the soup
three-quarters of an hour before being served. This requires steady
boiling, being closely covered, and the cover not to be removed
until taken up to serve. A very good form of pot-pie.
SOYER'S RECIPE FOR FORCE MEATS.
Take 1½ lbs. of lean veal from the fillet, and cut it in
long thin slices; scrape with a knife till nothing but the fibre
remains; put it in a mortar, pound it ten minutes or until in a
purée; pass it through [Pg
45]a wire sieve (use the
remainder in stock), then take 1 lb. of good fresh beef suet, which
skin, shred and chop very fine; put it in a mortar and pound it,
then add 6 oz. of panada (that is, bread soaked in milk, and boiled
till nearly dry) with the suet; pound them well together, and add
the veal, season with 1 teaspoonful of salt, ¼ teaspoonful
of pepper, ½ that of nutmeg; work all well together; then
add four eggs by degrees, continually pounding the contents of the
mortar. When well mixed, take a small piece in a spoon, and poach
it in some boiling water, and if it is delicate, firm, and of a
good flavor, it is ready for use.
CROUTONS FOR SOUP.
In a frying pan have the depth of an inch of boiling fat; also
have prepared slices of stale bread cut up into little half-inch
squares; drop into the frying pan enough of these bits of bread to
cover the surface of the fat. When browned, remove with a skimmer
and drain; add to the hot soup and serve.
Some prefer them prepared in this manner:
Take very thin slices of bread, butter them well; cut them up
into little squares three-fourths of an inch thick, place them in a
baking pan, buttered side up, and brown in a quick oven.
FISH STOCK.
Place a saucepan over the fire with a good-sized piece of sweet
butter and a sliced onion; put into that some sliced tomatoes, then
add as many different kinds of fish as you can get—oysters,
clams, smelts, pawns, crabs, shrimps and all kinds of pan-fish;
cook all together until the onions are well browned; then add a
bunch of sweet herbs, salt and pepper, and sufficient water to make
the required amount of stock. After this has cooked for half an
hour pound it with a wooden pestle, then strain and cook again
until it jellies.
FISH SOUP.
Select a large, fine fish, clean it thoroughly, put it over the
fire with a sufficient quantity of water, allowing for each pound
of fish one quart of water; add an onion cut fine and a bunch of
sweet herbs. When the fish is cooked, and is quite tasteless,
strain all through a colander, return to the fire, add some butter,
salt and pepper to taste. [Pg
46]A small tablespoonful
of Worcestershire sauce may be added if liked. Serve with small
squares of fried bread and thin slices of lemon.
LOBSTER SOUP, OR BISQUE.
Have ready a good broth made of three pounds of veal boiled
slowly in as much water as will cover it, till the meat is reduced
to shreds. It must then be well strained.
Having boiled one fine middle-sized lobster, extract all the
meat from the body and claws. Bruise part of the coral in a mortar,
and also an equal quantity of the meat. Mix them well together. Add
mace, cayenne, salt and pepper, and make them up into force meat
balls, binding the mixture with the yolk of an egg slightly
beaten.
Take three quarts of the veal broth and put it into the meat of
the lobster cut into mouthfuls. Boil it together about twenty
minutes. Then thicken it with the remaining coral (which you must
first rub through a sieve), and add the force meat balls and a
little butter rolled in flour. Simmer it gently for ten minutes,
but do not let it come to a boil, as that will injure the color.
Serve with small dice of bread fried brown in butter.
OYSTER SOUP, No. 1.
Two quarts of oysters, one quart of milk, two tablespoonfuls of
butter, one teacupful of hot water; pepper, salt.
Strain all the liquor from the oysters; add the water, and heat.
When near the boil, add the seasoning, then the oysters. Cook about
five minutes from the time they begin to simmer, until they
"ruffle." Stir in the butter, cook one minute, and pour into the
tureen. Stir in the boiling milk and send to table. Some prefer all
water in place of milk.
OYSTER SOUP. No. 2.
Scald one gallon of oysters in their own liquor. Add one quart
of rich milk to the liquor, and when it comes to a boil, skim out
the oysters and set aside. Add the yolks of four eggs, two good
tablespoonfuls of butter, and one of flour, all mixed well
together, but in this order—first, the milk, then, after
beating the eggs, add a little of the hot liquor to them gradually,
and stir them rapidly into the soup. Lastly, add the butter and
whatever seasoning you fancy besides plain pepper and salt, which
must both be put in to taste with caution.
Celery salt most persons like extremely; others would prefer a
little marjoram or thyme; others again mace and a bit of onion. Use
your own discretion in this regard.
CLAM SOUP. (French Style.)
Mince two dozen hard shell clams very fine. Fry half a minced
onion in an ounce of butter; add to it a pint of hot water, a pinch
of mace, four cloves, one allspice and six whole pepper corns. Boil
fifteen minutes and strain into a saucepan; add the chopped clams
and a pint of clam-juice or hot water; simmer slowly two hours;
strain and rub the pulp through a sieve into the liquid. Return it
to the saucepan and keep it lukewarm. Boil three half-pints of milk
in a saucepan (previously wet with cold water, which prevents
burning) and whisk it into the soup. Dissolve a teaspoonful of
flour in cold milk, add it to the soup, taste for seasoning; heat
it gently to near the boiling point; pour into a tureen previously
heated with hot water, and serve with or without pieces of fried
bread—called croutons in kitchen French.
CLAM SOUP.
Twenty-five clams chopped fine. Put over the fire the liquor
that was drained from them, and a cup of water; add the chopped
clams and boil half an hour; then season to taste with pepper and
salt and a piece of butter as large as an egg; boil up again and
add one quart of milk boiling hot, stir in a tablespoon of flour
made to a cream with a little cold milk, or two crackers rolled
fine. Some like a little mace and lemon juice in the seasoning.
The usual custom among professional cooks is to entirely immerse
the article to be cooked in boiling fat, but from inconvenience
most households use the half-frying method of frying in a small
amount of fat in a frying pan. For the first method a shallow iron
frying kettle, large at the top and small at the bottom, is best to
use. The fat should half fill the kettle, or an amount sufficient
to float whatever is to be fried; the heat of the fat should get to
such a degree that, when a piece of bread or a teaspoonful of the
batter is dropped in it, it will become brown almost instantly, but
should not be so hot as to burn the fat. Some cooks say that the
fat should be smoking, but my experience is, that is a mistake, as
that soon ruins the fat. As soon as it begins to smoke it should be
removed a little to one side, and still be kept at the boiling
point. If fritters, crullers, croquettes, etc., are dropped into
fat that is too hot, it crusts over the outside before the inside
has fully risen, making a heavy, hard article, and also ruining the
fat, giving it a burnt flavor.
Many French cooks prefer beef fat or suet to lard for frying
purposes, considering it more wholesome and digestible, does not
impart as much flavor, or adhere or soak into the article cooked as
pork fat.
In families of any size, where there is much cooking required,
there are enough drippings and fat remnants from roasts of beef,
skimmings from the soup kettle, with the addition of occasionally a
pound of suet from the market, to amply supply the need. All such
remnants and skimmings should be clarified about twice a week, by
boiling them all together in water. When the fat is all melted, it
should be strained with the water and set aside to cool. After the
fat on the top has hardened, lift the cake from the water on which
it lies, scrape off all the dark particles from the bottom, then
melt over [Pg 49]again the fat; while hot strain into a small clean
stone jar or bright tin pail, and then it is ready for use. Always
after frying anything, the fat should stand until it settles and
has cooled somewhat; then turn off carefully so as to leave it
clear from the sediment that settles at the bottom.
Refined cotton-seed oil is now being adopted by most
professional cooks in hotels, restaurants and many private
households for culinary purposes, and will doubtless in future
supersede animal fats, especially for frying, it being quite as
delicate a medium as frying with olive oil. It is now sold by
leading grocers, put up in packages of two and four quarts.
The second mode of frying, using a frying pan with a small
quantity of fat or grease, to be done properly, should, in the
first place, have the frying pan hot over the fire, and the fat in
it actually boiling before the article to be cooked is
placed in it, the intense heat quickly searing up the pores of the
article and forming a brown crust on the lower side, then turning
over and browning the other the same way.
Still, there is another mode of frying; the process is somewhat
similar to broiling, the hot frying pan or spider replacing the hot
fire. To do this correctly, a thick bottomed frying pan should be
used. Place it over the fire, and when it is so hot that it will
siss, oil over the bottom of the pan with a piece of suet, that is
if the meat is all lean; if not, it is not necessary to grease the
bottom of the pan. Lay in the meat quite flat, and brown it
quickly, first on one side, then on the other; when sufficiently
cooked, dish on a hot platter and season the same as broiled
meats.
FISH.
In selecting fish, choose those only in which the eye is full
and prominent, the flesh thick and firm, the scales bright and fins
stiff. They should be thoroughly cleaned before cooking.
The usual modes of cooking fish are boiled, baked, broiled,
fried and occasionally stewed. Steaming fish is much superior to
boiling, but the ordinary conveniences in private houses do not
admit of the possibility of enjoying this delicate way of cooking
it. Large fish are generally boiled, medium-sized ones baked or
boiled, the smaller [Pg 50]kinds fried or broiled. Very large fish,
such as cod, halibut, etc., are cut in steaks or slices for frying
or broiling. The heads of some fish, as the cod, halibut, etc., are
considered tidbits by many. Small fish, or pan-fish, as they are
usually called, are served without the heads, with the exception of
brook-trout and smelts; these are usually cooked whole, with the
heads on. Bake fish slowly, basting often with butter and water.
Salmon is considered the most nutritious of all fish. When boiling
fish, by adding a little vinegar and salt to the water, it seasons
and prevents the nutriment from being drawn out; the vinegar acting
on the water hardens the water.
Fill the fish with a nicely prepared stuffing of rolled cracker
or stale bread crumbs, seasoned with butter, pepper, salt, sage and
any other aromatic herbs fancied; sew up; wrap in a well-floured
cloth, tied closely with twine, and boil or steam. The garnishes
for boiled fish are: for turbot, fried smelts; for other boiled
fish, parsley, sliced beets, lemon or sliced boiled egg. Do not use
the knives, spoons, etc., that are used in cooking fish, for other
food, as they will be apt to impart a fishy flavor.
Fish to be boiled should be put into cold water and set
on the fire to cook very gently, or the outside will break before
the inner part is done. Unless the fish are small, they should
never be put into warm water; nor should water, either hot or cold,
be poured on to the fish, as it is liable to break the skin;
if it should be necessary to add a little water while the fish is
cooking, it ought to be poured in gently at the side of the
vessel.
Fish to be broiled should lie, after they are dressed, for two
or three hours, with their inside well sprinkled with salt and
pepper.
Salt fish should be soaked in water before boiling, according to
the time it has been in salt. When it is hard and dry, it will
require thirty-six hours soaking before it is dressed, and the
water must be changed three or four times. When fish is not very
salt, twenty-four hours, or even one night, will suffice.
When frying fish the fire must be hot enough to bring the fat to
such a degree of heat as to sear the surface and make it impervious
to the fat, and at the same time seal up the rich juices. As soon
as the fish is browned by this sudden application of heat, the pan
may be moved to a cooler place on the stove, that the process may
be finished more slowly.
Fat in which fish has been fried is just as good to use again
for the same purpose, but it should be kept by itself and not put
to any other use.
TO FRY FISH.
Most of the smaller fish (generally termed pan-fish) are usually
fried. Clean well, cut off the head, and, if quite large, cut out
the backbone, and slice the body crosswise into five or six pieces;
season with salt and pepper. Dip in Indian meal or wheat flour, or
in beaten egg, and roll in bread or fine cracker crumbs—trout
and perch should not be dipped in meal; put into a thick bottomed
iron frying pan, the flesh side down, with hot lard or drippings;
fry slowly, turning when lightly browned. The following method may
be deemed preferable: Dredge the pieces with flour; brush them over
with beaten egg; roll in bread crumbs, and fry in hot lard or
drippings sufficient to cover, the same as frying crullers. If the
fat is very hot, the fish will fry without absorbing it, and it
will be palatably cooked. When browned on one side, turn it over in
the fat and brown the other, draining when done. This is a
particularly good way to fry slices of large fish. Serve with
tomato sauce; garnish with slices of lemon.
PAN-FISH.
Place them in a thick bottomed frying pan with heads all one
way. Fill the spaces with smaller fish. When they are fried quite
brown and ready to turn, put a dinner plate over them, drain off
the fat; then invert the pan, and they will be left unbroken on the
plate. Put the lard back into the pan, and when hot slip
back the fish. When the other side is brown, drain, turn on a plate
as before, and slip them on a warm platter, to be sent to the
table. Leaving the heads on and the fish a crispy-brown, in perfect
shape, improves the appearance if not the flavor. Garnish with
slices of lemon.
BAKED PICKEREL.
Carefully clean and wipe the fish, and lay in a dripping pan
with enough hot water to prevent scorching. A perforated sheet of
tin, fitting loosely, or several muffin rings may be used to keep
it off the bottom. Lay it in a circle on its belly, head and tail
touching, and tied, or as directed in note on fish; bake slowly,
basting often with butter and water. When done, have ready a cup of
sweet cream or rich [Pg 52]milk to which a few spoons of hot water
has been added; stir in two large spoons of melted butter and a
little chopped parsley; heat all by setting the cup in boiling
water; add the gravy from the dripping-pan, and let it boil up
once; place the fish in a hot dish and pour over it the sauce. Or
an egg sauce may be made with drawn butter; stir in the yolk of an
egg quickly, and then a teaspoon of chopped parsley. It can be
stuffed or not, just as you please.
BOILED SALMON.
The middle slice of salmon is the best. Sew up neatly in a
mosquito-net bag, and boil a quarter of an hour to the pound in hot
salted water. When done, unwrap with care, and lay upon a hot dish,
taking care not to break it. Have ready a large cupful of drawn
butter, very rich, in which has been stirred a tablespoonful of
minced parsley and the juice of a lemon. Pour half upon the salmon
and serve the rest in a boat. Garnish with parsley and sliced
eggs.
BROILED SALMON.
Cut slices from an inch to an inch and an half thick, dry them
in a cloth, season with salt and pepper, dredge them in sifted
flour, and broil on a gridiron rubbed with suet.
Another Mode.—Cut the slices one inch thick, and
