THE FIRST MAN-CARRYING AEROPLANE CAPABLE OF
SUSTAINED FREE FLIGHT—LANGLEY’S SUCCESS AS A
PIONEER IN AVIATION.
By A. F. Zahm, Ph. D.
[With 8 plates.]
It is doubtful whether any person of the present generation will
be able to appraise correctly the contributions thus far made to the
development of the practical flying machine. The aeroplane as it
stands to-day is the creation not of any one man, but rather of three
generations of men. It was the invention of the nineteenth century;
it will be the fruition, if not the perfection, of the twentieth century.
During the long decades succeeding the time of Sir George Cayley,
builder of aerial gliders and sagacious exponent of the laws of flight,
continuous progress has been made in every department of theoretical
and practical aviation—progress in accumulating the data of
aeromechanics, in discovering the principles of this science, in improving
the instruments of aerotechnic research, in devising the organs
and perfecting the structural details of the present-day dynamic
flying machine. From time to time numerous aerial craftsmen have
flourished in the world’s eye, only to pass presently into comparative
obscurity, while others too neglected or too poorly appreciated in their
own day subsequently have risen to high estimation and permanent
honor in the minds of men.
Something of this latter fortune was fated to the late Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution. For a decade and a half Dr. Langley had
toiled unremittingly to build up the basic science of mechanical flight,
and finally to apply it to practical use. He had made numerous model
aeroplanes propelled by various agencies—by India rubber, by steam,
by gasoline—all operative and inherently stable. Then with great
confidence he had constructed for the War Department a man flier
which was the duplicate, on a fourfold scale, of his successful gasoline
model. But on that luckless day in December, 1903, when he
expected to inaugurate the era of substantial aviation, an untoward
accident to his launching gear badly crippled his carefully and adequately
designed machine. The aeroplane was repaired, but not
again tested until the spring of 1914—seven years after Langley’s
death.
Such an accident, occurring now, would be regarded as a passing
mishap; but at that time it seemed to most people to demonstrate
the futility of all aviation experiments. The press overwhelmed the
inventor with ridicule; the great scientist himself referred to the accident
as having frustrated the best work of his life. Although he felt
confident of the final success of his experiments, further financial
support was not granted and he was forced to suspend operations.
Scarcely could he anticipate that a decade later, in a far away little
hamlet, workmen who had never known him would with keenest
enthusiasm rehabilitate that same tandem monoplane, and launch it
again and again in successful flight, and that afterwards in the National
Capital it should be assigned the place of honor among the
pioneer vehicles of the air.
When in March, 1914, Mr. Glenn H. Curtiss was invited to send a
flying boat to Washington to participate in celebrating “Langley
Day,”[1] he replied, “I would like to put the Langley aeroplane itself
in the air.” Learning of this remark Secretary Walcott, of the
Smithsonian Institution, soon authorized Mr. Curtiss to recanvas
the original Langley aeroplane and launch it either under its own
propulsive power or with a more recent engine and propeller. Early
in April, therefore, the machine was taken from the Langley Laboratory
and shipped in a box car to the Curtiss Aviation Field, beside
Lake Keuka, Hammondsport, N. Y. In the following month it was
ready for its first trial since the unfortunate accident of 1903.
[1] May 6, the anniversary of the famous flight of Langley’s steam model aeroplane in 1896, is known in
Washington as “Langley Day,” and has been celebrated with aerial maneuvers over land and water.
The main objects of these renewed trials were, first, to show whether
the original Langley machine was capable of sustained free flight
with a pilot, and, secondly, to determine more fully the advantages of
the tandem type of aeroplane. The work seemed a proper part of
the general program of experiments planned for the recently reopened
Langley Aerodynamical Laboratory. It was, indeed, for just such
experimentation that the aeroplane had been given to the Smithsonian
Institution by the War Department, at whose expense it had
been developed and brought to completion prior to 1903. After some
successful flights at Hammondsport the famous craft could, at the
discretion of the Smithsonian Institution, either be preserved for exhibition
or used for further scientific study. To achieve the two
main objects above mentioned, the aeroplane would first be flown as
nearly as possible in its original condition, then with such modifications
as might seem desirable for technical or other reasons.
Various ways of launching were considered. In 1903 the Langley
aeroplane was launched from the top of a houseboat. A car supporting
it and drawn by lengthy spiral springs ran swiftly along a track,
then suddenly dropped away, leaving the craft afloat in midair with
its propellers whirring and its pilot supplementing, with manual control,
if need be, the automatic stability of the machine. This method
of launching, as shown by subsequent experimentalists, is a practical
one and was favorably entertained by Mr. Curtiss. He also thought
of starting from the ground with wheels, from the ice with skates,
from the water with floats. Having at hand neither a first rate
smooth field nor a sheet of ice, he chose to start from the water.

In the accompanying illustrations, plates 1 and 2 show the appearance
of the Langley flying machine after Mr. Curtiss had provided it
with hydroaeroplane floats and their connecting truss work. The
steel main frame, the wings, the rudders, the engine and propellers
all were substantially as they had been in 1903. The pilot had the
same seat under the main frame, and the same general system of
control as in 1903. He could raise or lower the craft by moving the
big rear rudder up and down; he could steer right and left by turning
the vertical rudder. He had no ailerons nor wing-warping mechanism,
but for lateral balance depended upon the dihedral angle of the
wings and upon suitable movements of his weight or of the vertical
rudder. And here it may be noted that Langley had placed the vertical
steering rudder under and to the rear of the center of gravity.
So placed, it served as a fairly good aileron by exerting a turning
movement about the longitudinal axis of the machine.
After the adjustments for actual flight had been made in the Curtiss
factory, according to the minute descriptions contained in the
Langley Memoir on Mechanical Flight, the aeroplane was taken to
the shore of Lake Keuka, beside the Curtiss hangars, and assembled
for launching. On a clear morning (May 28), and in a mild breeze,
the craft was lifted onto the water by a dozen men and set going, with
Mr. Curtiss at the steering wheel, ensconced in the little boat-shaped
car under the forward part of the frame. Many eager witnesses and
camera men were at hand, on shore and in boats. The four-winged
craft, pointed somewhat across the wind, went skimming over the
wavelets, then automatically headed into the wind, rose in level
poise, soared gracefully for 150 feet, and landed softly on the water
near the shore. Mr. Curtiss asserted that he could have flown farther,
but, being unused to the machine, imagined the left wings had
more resistance than the right. The truth is that the aeroplane was
perfectly balanced in wing resistance, but turned on the water like a
weather vane owing to the lateral pressure on its big rear rudder.
Hence in future experiments this rudder was made turnable about a
vertical axis, as well as about the horizontal axis used by Langley.
Henceforth the little vertical rudder under the frame was kept fixed
and inactive.
After a few more flights with the Langley aeroplane, kept as nearly
as possible in its original condition, its engine and twin propellers
were replaced by a Curtiss 80-horse motor and direct-connected
tractor propeller mounted on the steel frame, well forward, as shown
in the photographs. It was hoped in this way to spare the original
engine and propeller bearings, which were none too strong for the
unusual burden added by the floats. In 1903 the total weight of
pilot and machine had been 830 pounds; with the floats lately added
it was 1,170 pounds; with the Curtiss motor and all ready for flight
it was 1,520 pounds. But notwithstanding these surplus additions
of 40 per cent and 85 per cent above the original weight of the craft,
the delicate wing spars and ribs were not broken, nor was any part
of the machine excessively overstrained.
Owing to the pressure of other work at the factory, the aeroplane
equipped with the Curtiss motor was not ready for further flights till
September. In the absence of Mr. Curtiss, who had gone to California
in August, a pupil of his aviation school, Mr. Elwood Doherty,
volunteered to act as pilot.
During some trials for adjusting the aeroplane controls and the
center of gravity, Mr. Doherty, on the afternoon of September 17,
planed easily over the water, rose on level wing, and flew about 450
feet, at an elevation of 2 or 3 yards, as shown by the accompanying
photographs of that date. Presently two other like flights were
made. Mr. Doherty found that with the forewings at 10° incidence,
the rear ones at 12°, and the pilot’s seat on the main frame about
midway between the wings, the flier responded nicely to the movements
of the pilot wheel. A slight turn of the wheel steered the
craft easily to right or left, a slight pull or push raised or lowered it.
The big double tail, or rudder, which responded to these movements,
was the only steering or control surface used. The breaking of the
8-foot tractor screw terminated these trials for the day. The waves
indicate the strength of the wind during the flights.
On September 19, using a 9-foot screw, Mr. Doherty began to make
longer flights. A pleasant off-shore breeze rippled the water, but
without raising whitecaps. A dozen workmen, lifting the great tandem
monoplane from the shore, with the pilot in his seat, waded into
the lake and set it gently on the water. A crowd of witnesses near
at hand, and many scattered about the shores, and on the lofty vine-clad
hills, stood watching expectantly. When some of the official
observers and photographers, in a motor boat, were well out in the
lake, a man in high-top boots, standing in the water, started the propeller,
and stepped quickly out of the way. Then with its great
yellow wings beautifully arched and distended, the imposing craft
ran swiftly out from the shore, gleaming brilliantly in the afternoon
sun. At first the floats and lower edges of the rudders broke the
water to a white surge, then as the speed increased they rose more
and more from the surface. Presently the rear floats and the rudders
cleared the water, the front floats still skipping on their heels, white
with foam. The whole craft was now in soaring poise. It quickly
approached the photographers, bearing on its back the alert pilot,
who seemed to be scrutinizing every part of it and well satisfied to let
it race. Then it rose majestically and sailed on even wing 1,000 feet;
sank softly, skimmed the water, and soared another 1,000 feet;
grazed the water again, rose and sailed 3,000 feet; turned on the
water and came back in the same manner; and, as it passed the photographers,
soared again nearly half a mile. The flights were repeated
a few minutes later, then, owing to squally weather, were
discontinued for 11 days.

On October 1, 1914, the aeroplane was launched at 11 a. m. in an
off-shore breeze strong enough to raise whitecaps. Hovering within
30 feet of the water, and without material loss of speed, it made in
quick succession flights of the following duration, as observed by
four of us in a motor boat and timed by myself: 20 seconds, 20 seconds,
65 seconds, 20 seconds, 40 seconds, 45 seconds. As the speed
through air averaged about 50 feet per second, the through air
lengths of these flights were, respectively, 1,000 feet, 1,000 feet, 3,250
feet, 1,000 feet, 2,000 feet, 2,250 feet. As the aeroplane was now
well out from shore among the heavy billows and white caps, Mr.
Doherty landed it upon the water and turned it half about for the
homeward flight. Thereupon the propeller tips struck the waves
and were broken off, one casting a splinter through the center of the
left wing. The pilot stopped the engine, rested in his seat, and was
towed home by our motor boat. The flights were witnessed and
have been attested by many competent observers.
As to the performance of the aeroplane during these trials, the
pilot, Mr. E. Doherty, reports, and we observed, that the inherent
lateral stability was excellent, the fore-and-aft control was satisfactory,
and the movement of the craft both on the water and in the air
was steady and suitable for practical flying in such weather. Apparently
the machine could have flown much higher, and thus avoided
touching the water during the lulls in the breeze; but higher flying
did not seem advisable with the frail trussing of wings designed to
carry 830 pounds instead of the 1,520 pounds actual weight.
At the present writing the Langley aeroplane is in perfect condition
and ready for any further tests that may be deemed useful. But
it has already fulfilled the purpose for which it was designed. It
has demonstrated that, with its original structure and power, it is
capable of flying with a pilot and several hundred pounds of useful
load. It is the first aeroplane in the history of the world of which
this can be truthfully said.
If the experiments be continued under more painstaking technical
direction, longer flights can easily be accomplished. Mr. Manly, who
designed the Langley engine and screws and who directed the construction
and tests of the large aeroplane up to December 8, 1903,
reports that he obtained from the propulsion plant a static thrust
of 450 pounds, and that he once ran the engine under full load for 10
hours consecutively. This thrust is nearly 100 pounds more than
that commonly obtained at Hammondsport with the same plant,
and 20 pounds more than the static thrust obtained with the Curtiss
motor on the day when it flew the aeroplane with 1,520 pounds
aggregate weight. Hence, by restoring the engine and propellers to
their original normal working condition they should be able to drive
the aeroplane in successful flight with an aggregate weight of nearly
1,600 pounds, even when hampered with the floats and their sustaining
truss work. With a thrust of 450 pounds, the Langley aeroplane,
without floats, restored to its original condition and provided
with stronger bearings, should be able to carry a man and sufficient
supplies for a voyage lasting practically the whole day.
Dr. Langley’s aerotechnic work may be briefly summarized as
follows:
1. His aerodynamic experiments, some published and some as yet
unpublished, were complete enough to form a basis for practical
pioneer aviation.
2. He built and launched, in 1896, the first steam model aeroplane
capable of prolonged free flight, and possessing good inherent stability.
3. He built the first internal-combustion motor suitable for a practical
man-carrying aeroplane.
4. He developed and successfully launched the first gasoline model
aeroplane capable of sustained free flight.
5. He developed and built the first man-carrying aeroplane capable
of sustained free flight.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
