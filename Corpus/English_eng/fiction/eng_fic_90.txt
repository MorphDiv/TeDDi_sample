"Painter and son of nature," wrote Voltaire, at that
time the arbitrator and the dispenser of fame in cultured
Europe, to Carlo Goldoni, then a rising dramatist, "I
would entitle your comedies, 'Italy liberated from the
Goths.'" The sage of Ferney's quick critical faculty
had once again hit its sure mark, for it is Goldoni's
supreme merit, and one of his chief titles to fame
and glory, that he released the Italian theatre from the
bondage of the artificial and pantomime performances
that until then had passed for plays, and that, together
with Molière, he laid the foundations of the drama as
it is understood in our days. Indeed, Voltaire, in his
admiration for the Venetian playwright, also called him
"the Italian Molière," a comparison that is more accurate
than such comparisons between authors of different
countries are apt to be, though, like all such judgments,
somewhat rough and ready. It is interesting in this
respect to confront the two most popular dramas of the
two dramatists, Molière's "Le Misanthrope" and Goldoni's
"Il Burbero Benefico." Goldoni, while superior in
imagination, in spontaneity, deals more with the superficial
aspects of humanity. Molière, on the contrary,
probes deep into the human soul, and has greater
elegance of form. In return, Goldoni is more genial
and kindly in his judgments, and, while lacking none of
Molière's keenness of observation, is devoid of his bitter
satire. Both have the same movement and life, the
same intuitive perception of what will please the public,
the same sense of dramatic proportion. Goldoni was,
however, less happy than Molière as regards the times
in which his lines were cast. The French dramatist, like
Shakespeare, was born at an age in which his fatherland
was traversing a glorious epoch of national story. The
Italian lived instead in the darkest period of that
political degradation which was the lot of the fairest of
European countries, until quite recently, when she
emancipated herself, threw off the chains of foreign
bondage, and proclaimed herself mistress of her own
lands and fortunes. And manners and customs were no
less in decadence in private as well as in public,—a sad
epoch, truly, though to outsiders it looked light-hearted
and merry enough. Goldoni's lot was cast in the final
decades of the decrepitude of Venice, the last of the
Italian proud Republics, which survived only to the end
of the eighteenth century, indeed dissolved just four
years after her great dramatist's demise. His long life
comprised almost the whole of that century, from the
wars of the Spanish Succession, which open the history
of that era, to the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle and the
French Revolution.
Historical events had, however, merely an outward
and accidental influence on this great artist-nature,
entirely absorbed in his work, and indifferent, even unconscious,
to all that surged around him in this respect.
To be assured that this is so, we need merely peruse
Goldoni's own Memoirs, composed by him in his old
age, and which, according to Gibbon's verdict, are even
more amusing to read than his very comedies.
"The immortal Goldoni," as his countrymen love
to call him, was born in Venice in 1707. His family
were of Modenese origin. The grandfather, who held a
lucrative and honourable post in the Venetian Chamber
of Commerce, married as his first wife a lady from his
native town, who died, leaving him a son. He then
espoused a widow with two daughters, the elder of
whom, in due course, he gave in marriage to this son.
The couple became the parents of the playwright.
This grandfather had a considerable influence over
Goldoni's youth, and also modified his later life. A
good-natured, not ill-intentioned man, he was nevertheless
hopelessly extravagant, and inordinately addicted
to material pleasures,—at that time, it must ever in
justice be remembered, the only outlet possible to male
energies and ambitions. For a pleasure-lover, the
Venice of that day was an earthly paradise, and the
result in this case was that the elder Goldoni put no
restraint upon himself whatever. It so happened that
he had the entire control not only of his wife's comfortable
fortune, but of that of her two daughters.
With this he hired a large villa, six leagues from Venice,
where he lived in so free and open-handed a manner as
to rouse the jealousy of the neighbouring proprietors.
A fanatic for the stage and all that pertained to it, he
caused comedies and operas to be performed under his
roof; the best singers and actors were hired to minister
to his amusement; reckless expenditure and joyous
living were the watchwords of the house. It was in
this atmosphere that the child Carlo was reared, no
wonder it affected his character. It may be said that
he imbibed a love for the play with his first breath.
Unfortunately, ere he was a man, the pleasure-loving
and open-handed grandfather caught cold and died, to
be followed soon after by his wife. At a blow all was
changed for the Goldoni family. Carlo's father, having
lacked proper training, was unable to maintain himself
in his father's position, which was offered him; the
property had to be sold, and when all debts were paid
there remained only the mother's dowry for the maintenance
of the whole family. However, there was
clearly good stuff in Goldoni's father. Already a man
of some years, he resolved nevertheless to study medicine
in order to earn an honest livelihood, and, wonderful to
tell, he became a very popular and successful physician,
practising first at Perugia. It was there that, only
eight years old, Carlino, as he was then called, wrote a
comedy, which so vastly pleased his father that in
consequence he resolved to give him the best education
within his reach. To this end he placed him in the
local Jesuit school. At first the boy, shy and repressed,
cut a bad figure, but by the end of the first term he
came out at the head of his class, to the immense
delight of his father. To reward him for this success,
his parents instigated for his benefit what we should
now call private theatricals. As women were forbidden
to appear on the stage within the Papal States, to which
Perugia then belonged, Carlino took the part of the
prima donna, and was further called upon to write a
prologue, which, according to the taste of the day,
was absurdly affected and hyperbolical. Goldoni gives
in his Memoirs the opening sentence of this literary
effort, and it may serve as a measure of the extent to
which he became a reformer of Italian style:—
"Most benignant Heaven, behold us, like butterflies,
spreading in the rays of your most splendid sun, the
wings of our feeble inventions, which bear our flight
towards a light so fair."
To compare this bombast with the crystal clearness
and simplicity of the language of Goldoni's comedies, is
to gain a fair estimate of what he had to overcome and
what he achieved.
A while after, the family removed to Chioggia, the
climate of Perugia not being suited to Goldoni's mother.
He himself was sent to Rimini to study philosophy in
the Dominican school, a study which in those days was
considered indispensable for the medical career to which
he was destined. But philosophy as taught at Rimini
did not attract our hero, and instead of poring over the
long passages dictated to him by his professor, he read
Plautus, Terence, Aristophanes, and the fragments of
Menander. Nor did the philosophic debates amuse him
half as much as a company of actors with whom he contrived
to knock up an acquaintance. Hearing that
these people, to his immense regret, were leaving
Rimini, and that of all places in the world they were
proceeding to Chioggia, it occurred to the youthful
scamp that nothing could be more easy and delightful
than to go with them in the big barge they had hired
for their transit. The rogue knew full well that his
mother at least would forgive him his escapade in the
pleasure of having him back again. So he went, and
there was an end of his philosophy. As he foresaw, his
mother pardoned him, and his father happened to be
absent on business. From Pavia, where he was staying
with a relative, at that time governor of the city, Dr.
Goldoni wrote that his Marchese had promised to be
kind to his eldest son. "So," went on the letter,
"if Carlo behaves well, he will provide for him."
This sentence filled Carlo the disobedient with
alarm. Nevertheless, when his father returned, he
forgave him almost as readily as his mother had
done. They were not strict disciplinarians, these
Goldoni, but easy-going folk, who liked to live and
let live.
The father now resolved to keep his son at home at
Chioggia, that he might begin to study medicine under
his guidance. Very desultory study it was, both father
and son thinking more of the theatre and of actors
than of the pharmacopœia. So medicine, too, had to be
abandoned. Goldoni's mother then bethought her of
the law, and Carlo was sent to Venice to study under
the care of an uncle. At Venice he found no less than
seven theatres in full swing, and all of them he frequented
in turn, enjoying especially the operas of
Metastasio, which were the latest novelty,—that author
who may be said to have done for Italian opera what
Goldoni did for Italian comedy, though unfortunately
the music to which his graceful verses have been set has
not, like them, proved immortal. After some months
of alternate gaiety and study of jurisprudence, Carlo
was moved to Pavia to complete his studies, a vacancy
having been found for him there in the Papal College.
Various preliminaries were needful to obtain admission,
among them the tonsure. During the delay caused by
these formalities, Carlo devoted himself to the study of
dramatic literature in the library of one of the professors.
Here he found, beside his old friends, the
classical dramatists, the English, Spanish, and French
playwrights. But the Italian, where were they? he
asked himself, and at once the resolve awoke in him
that he would do his very utmost towards reviving the
drama of his native land and tongue. What he would
do should be to imitate the style and precision of the
great authors of antiquity, but to give to his plays more
movement, happier terminations, and characters better
formulated. "We owe," he says, "respect to the great
writers who have smoothed the way for us in science
and in art, but every age has its dominant genius and
every climate its national taste. The Greek and Roman
writers knew human nature and copied it closely, but
without illusion and without skill. To this is owing
that want of moderation and decency which has led to
the proscription of the drama by the Church."
At Pavia, Goldoni spent his time over everything else
but study, nor was his sojourn there long, for a satire
composed and published, taken together with other
pranks, led to his expulsion from the College. His
parents as usual forgave him, and he was allowed to
accompany his father on one of his business journeys,
during the course of which Goldoni tells that he obtained
much knowledge of men and things. At Modena, it
happened that the pair fell in with some very devout
people, and saw the "admonition" of an abbé of their
acquaintance, who was punished in public after a severe
and impressive fashion. Carlo, who was at the time
suffering from a juvenile attack of disgust with the world,
felt this spectacle arouse in him the desire to become a
Capuchin monk. His wise father did not contradict him,
and took him to Venice, ostensibly to present him to the
Director of the Capuchins. But he plunged him also
into a round of gaieties, dinners, suppers, theatres; and
Carlo discovered that, to avoid the perils of this world,
it was not needful to renounce it altogether. He had
now arrived at man's estate, it was requisite he should
have an occupation. Through the kindness of friends
he obtained a position in the service of the government,
not lucrative but yet remunerative, which he contrived
to make useful to his dramatic training, the one idea
to which he ever remained faithful. This position,
Chancellor to the Podestà, required almost continual
change of place, and although Goldoni himself liked it
very well, his mother disapproved of it highly, calling
it a gipsy's post.
In 1731, Goldoni lost his father, an irreparable sorrow
to him. He now found himself, at twenty-four, the head
of his family. His mother consequently insisted he
should give up his wanderings and assume the lawyer's
toga. He therefore went to Padua to finish his studies,
and this time he studied really, passing a brilliant
examination, though the whole night previously he had
spent at the gaming-table, whence the University beadle
had to fetch him to come before his examiners.
Behold him now a full-fledged lawyer, but with few
clients and causes to defend. His fruitless leisure was
employed in scribbling almanacs in terza rima, in which
he sought to insert such prophecies as were likely to
fulfil themselves. In hopes of further bettering his
fortunes, he also wrote a tragedy called "Amalasunta."
He had hoped this would bring him in one hundred
zecchini. Unfortunately, however, he had at the same
time let himself in for a love affair, from which there
was no other exit but that which his father had taught
him to adopt in similar cases, namely, flight from the
scene of action. So, putting the MSS. of "Amalasunta"
under his arm, he bolted from his native town. This
was to be the beginning of his artistic career. Milan
was his destination, where he arrived in the full swing
of the Carnival. Here he was brought in contact with
Count Prata, Director of the Opera. At a reception at
the house of the prima ballerina, Goldoni undertook to
read his "Amalasunta." The leading actor took exception
to it from the outset, and by the time the reading
was ended none of the audience were left in the room
except Count Prata. The play ended, the Count told
the author that his opera was composed with due regard
to the rules of Aristotle and Horace, but was not framed
according to the rules laid down for Italian opera in
their day.
"In France," he continued, "you can try to please
the public, but here in Italy, it is the actors and
actresses whom you must consult, as well as the
composer of the music and the stage decorators. Everything
must be done according to a certain form, which I will
explain to you. Each of the three principal personages
of the opera must sing five airs, two in the first act,
two in the second, and one in the third. The second
actress and the second soprano can only have three, and
the lower rank of artists must be contented with one, or
at most two. The author must submit his words to the
musician, and must take care that two pathetic airs do
not follow each other. The same rule must be observed
with regard to the airs of bravura, of action, of secondary
action, as also with regard to the minuet and rondeau.
And above all things remember that on no account must
moving or showy airs be given to the performers of the
second rank. These poor people must take what they
can get, and make no attempt to shine."
The Count would have said more, but the author had
heard enough. He thanked his kind critic, took leave
of his hostess, went back to the inn, ordered a fire, and
reduced "Amalasunta" to ashes. This performance
completed, not without natural regret, he ordered a
good supper, which he consumed with relish, after
which he went to bed and slept tranquilly all night.
On the morrow, dining with the Venetian Ambassador,
he recounted to him his adventures. The Ambassador,
compassionating his destitute condition, and finding
pleasure in his company, found a post for him in his
household as a sort of chamberlain. This position, by
no means arduous, left Goldoni plenty of time for
himself. He now made the acquaintance of a quack
doctor, a certain Buonafede, who went by the name of
the Anonimo, and was a very prince of charlatans.
This man, among other devices to attract customers,
carried about with him a company of actors, who, after
assisting him in distributing the objects which he sold
and collecting the money for them, gave a representation
in his small theatre erected in the public square.
It so happened that the company of comedians which
had been engaged for that Easter season at Milan,
unexpectedly failed to keep their engagement, so that
the Milanese were left without players. The Anonimo
proposed his company, Goldoni through the Venetian
Minister helped him to attain his end, and wrote for
the first performance an intermezzo, "The Venetian
Gondolier," which was set to music by the composer
attached to the company, and had, as Goldoni himself
says, all the success so slight an effort deserved. This
little play was the first of his works performed and
afterwards published.
At this time in Italy, the so-called Commedie dell' arte
or a soggetto held the boards; extremely artificial, stilted
forms of dramatic composition, which, it is true, testified
to the quick and ready wit of the Italians, but also to
a puerile taste, far removed from artistic finish. These
plays were all performed by actors in masks, after the
manner of the classical drama, and in the greater
number of cases the players were supplied merely with
the plot and the situations of the play, the dialogue
having to be supplied by the invention of the actors
themselves; the outline was often of the roughest
nature, much after the manner of modern drawing-room
charades, but there were certain stock characters, such
as an old man who is the butt of the tricks and deceptions
of the others, an extravagant son, scampish
servants, and corrupt or saucy chambermaids. These
characters and their established costumes were derived
from different cities of Italy, and were traditional from
the earliest appearance of the Commedie dell' arte. Thus,
the father, Pantaloon, a Venetian merchant, the doctor,
a lawyer or professor from learned Bologna, and
Brighella and Harlequin, Bergamasque servants as
stupid as the corrupt or saucy maid-servants and
lovers from Rome and Tuscany were sharp. Lance
and Speed in "Two Gentlemen of Verona" are
good specimens of these characters. The merchant
and the doctor, called in Italian "the two old men,"
always wore a mantle. Pantaloon, or Pantaleone,
is a corruption of the cry, Plantare il Leone, (Plant
the Lion), to the sound of which, and under shadow
of their banner, the Lion of their patron St. Mark,
the Venetians had conquered their territories and
wealth. Pantaloon was the impersonation, however,
not of fighting but of trading Venice, and wore the
merchant costume still in use, with but slight modification,
in Goldoni's day. The dress of the doctor was
that of the lawyers of the great university, and the
strange mask which was worn by this character imitated
a wine-mark which disfigured the countenance of a
certain well-known legal luminary, according to a
tradition extant among the players in Goldoni's time.
Finally, "Brighella and Arlecchino," called in Italy
Zanni,1 were taken from Bergamo as the extremes of
sharpness or stupidity, the supposed two characteristics
of the inhabitants of that city. Brighella represented
a meddlesome, waggish, and artful servant, who wore
a sort of livery with a dark mask, copied after the
tanned skin of the men of that sub-Alpine region.
Some actors in this part were called Finocchio, Scappino
(Molière's Scapin), but it was always the same character,
and always a Bergamasque. Arlecchino, or Harlequin,
too, had often different names, but he never changed
his birthplace, was always the same fool, and wore the
same dress, a coat of different-coloured patches, cobbled
together anyhow (hence the patchwork dress of the
modern pantomime). The hare's tail which adorned
his hat formed in Goldoni's time part of the ordinary
costume of the Bergamasque peasants. Pantaloon's
disguise was completed by a beard of ridiculous cut,
and he always wore slippers. It is in allusion to this
that Shakespeare calls the sixth age of man, "the lean
and slippered pantaloon."
When Goldoni began to write, the drama had fallen
into a sadly burlesque condition. Shortly after the
first performance of his "Venetian Gondolier," a play
called "Belisario" was represented, in which the
blinded hero was led on to the stage by Harlequin,
and beaten with a stick to show him the way. This
indignity of presentation awoke in Goldoni a desire to
write a play on the same theme. Asking the principal
actor in this farce, what he thought of it, the man
replied, "It is a joke, a making fun of the public, but
this sort of thing will go on till the stage is reformed."
And he encouraged Goldoni to put his purpose into
action. He did indeed begin a play on this theme,
but wars and sieges hindered its performance; for the
War of the Polish Succession broke out, that war called
the war of Don Carlos, regarding which Carlyle is so
sarcastic in his Life of Frederick the Great; and Milan
was occupied by the King of Sardinia, to the great
astonishment of Goldoni, who, although he lived in the
house of an ambassador, and should have been well
informed of current events, knew no more about them
than an infant. He now accompanied his chief to
Crema, Modena, and Parma, in which latter city, he,
the man of peace par excellence, assisted at the great
battle of June 1734. The impressions then gained, he
afterwards utilised in his comedy, "L'Amante Militare."
Indeed, skilful workman that he was, he always
turned to account whatever befell him, whatever he
saw or heard, and his wandering and adventurous life
furnished him many opportunities for studying men
and manners.
It would lead us too far to follow Goldoni through
all the incidents of his varied history. It must suffice
to indicate the salient points. In 1736, having freed
himself from service to the Ambassador, and having
again now consorted with actors, now exercised his
legal profession, he married the woman who proved his
good angel, Nicoletta Conio, who accompanied him all
his life, modest, affectionate, indulgent, long-suffering,
light-hearted even in the midst of adverse fortune,
enamoured of him and of his fame, his truest friend,
comforter, inspirer, and stay: in a word, an ideal woman,
whose character has been exquisitely sketched by the
modern Italian playwright, Paolo Ferrari, in his
graceful comedy, "Goldoni e le sue sedici Commedie."
Shortly after this marriage, and in large part thanks to
his wife's encouragement and faith in him, Goldoni
issued finally from out the tortuous labyrinth of
conventional tragedies, intermezzi cantabili, and serious
and comic operas in which hitherto his talents had been
imprisoned, and found his true road, that of character
comedy. His first attempt at a reforming novelty
was the abolition of the mask, to which he had a
just objection, considering it, with perfect reasonableness,
as fatal to the development of the drama of
character.
But he was not to go on his road unhindered. War,
so frequent in those days of petty States, once more
crossed his plans, and this conjoined to his native love
for roaming, inherited from his restless father, caused
him to sojourn in many cities, and encounter many
adventures gay and grave, all recounted by him with
unfailing good temper in his Memoirs, in which he
never says an unkind word, even of his worst enemies;
for Goldoni's was an essentially amicable character.
He writes of himself:—
"My mental nature is perfectly analogous to my
physical; I fear neither cold nor heat, neither do I let
myself be carried away by anger, nor be intoxicated by
success…. My great aim in writing my Comedies
has been not to spoil nature, and the sole scope of my
Memoirs is to tell the truth…. I was born pacific,
and have always kept my equanimity."
These words sum up the man and the author. In
Goldoni the perfect equilibrium of the faculties of
the man correspond to the perfectly just and accurate
sense of truth and naturalness which is revealed in
the writer.
After five years spent in Pisa, practising, and not
unsuccessfully, as a lawyer, and hoping he had sown his
theatrical wild oats, and had now settled down as a
quiet burgher, Goldoni was roused from this day-dream
(which after all did not reflect his deepest sentiments,
but only an acquired worldly wisdom) by an offer from
Medebac, the leader of a group of comedians, to join his
fortune to theirs as dramatic author to the company.
After some hesitation, his old love for the stage gained
the upper hand, and Goldoni assented, binding himself
to Medebac for a certain number of years. From that
time forward he remained true to his real passion, the
theatre.
The company proceeded to Venice, at that time in
the last days of its glory, but dying gaily, merrily.
The Venice of those days, an author of the time said,
was as immersed in pleasure as in water. And above
all did its inhabitants love the play. To this city,
among this people, Goldoni returned, one of its own
children, endowed with its nature, apt to understand
its wishes and inclinations. And here, among his
compatriots, he resolved not to follow the bad theatrical
taste in vogue in favour of spectacular plays and
scurrilous Commedie dell' arte, but to take up for Italy
the task accomplished by Molière for France, and to
re-conduct comedy into the right road, from which it
had wandered so far.
"I had no rivals to combat," he writes, "I had only
prejudices to surmount."
The first play written for unmasked actors proved
unsuccessful. Goldoni was not daunted. He wrote a
second. It was applauded to the echo, and he saw
himself well launched upon his career as a reformer.
The great obstacle to his entire success lay in the
difficulty of finding actors, as the masked parts could
be taken by greatly inferior players; and also by the
circumstance, already pointed out to him by his critic
of "Amalasunta," that an Italian playwright had to
think more of pleasing his actors than his public.
What Goldoni had to endure from this gens irritabilis,
from their rancour, vapours, caprices, stolid and open
opposition to his reform, is told with much good nature
and sense of fun in his Memoirs. It can have been far
from easy to endure, and no doubt often exasperated
the author, though in his old age he can speak of it so
calmly and dispassionately. But Goldoni, even as a
young man, was wise, and proceeded slowly, first making
himself and his name known and popular on the old
lines, and only risking his new ideas under favourable
conditions. Thus he respected the antique unities of time
and action, which, after all, save in the hands of great
genius, are most conducive to dramatic success, and he
only infringed the unity of place to a certain extent,
always confining the action of the comedies within the
walls of the same town. He says, with a sagacity not
common in his profession, that he should not have met
with so much opposition, had it not been for the indiscreet
zeal of his admirers, who exalted his merits to
so excessive a degree, that wise and cultivated people
were roused to contradict such fanaticism. As to the
ill feeling roused by the ridicule freely showered by
Goldoni upon the corrupt customs of his time, he takes
no heed of it, save to redouble his efforts in the same
direction. Like Molière, he had the courage to put
upon the boards the defects and absurdities of his
own age, not merely those of a bygone time. And his
satire, though keen, is never bitter. His laugh is an
honest one. As Thackeray says of Fielding, "it clears
the air." His dramatic censure is considered to have
been instrumental in putting down the State-protected
gambling which was the plague-spot of Venice in those
days, and further in giving the first death-blows to
that debased survival from the time of chivalry, the
Cavaliere Servente, or Cicisbeo.
Goldoni's diligence was as great and untiring as his
invention was fertile. Thus once, provoked by an
unjust fiasco, he publicly promised that he would write
and produce sixteen new comedies in the course of the
next year, and he kept his pledge, though at the time
of making it he had not one of these plays even
planned. And among this sixteen are some of his
Masterpieces, such as "Pamela" and the "Bottega del
Caffé." The theme of Pamela was not exactly his
choice. He had been teased to compose a play after
the novel of Richardson, then all the fashion in Italy.
At first he believed it an impossible task, owing to the
great difference in the social rules of the two countries.
In England a noble may marry whom he likes; his wife
becomes his equal, his children in no wise suffer. Not
so in the Venice of that time. The oligarchical rule
was so severe, that a patrician marrying a woman of
the lower class forfeited his right to participate in the
government, and deprived his offspring of the patriciate.
"Comedy, which is or should be," says Goldoni, "the
school of society, should never expose the weakness of
humanity save to correct it, wherefore it is not right
to recompense virtue at the expense of posterity."
However, the necessity of finding themes, conjoined to
this insistence on the part of his friends, induced
Goldoni to try his hand with Pamela. He changed
the dénouement, however, in compliance with Venetian
social prejudices, making Pamela turn out to be the
daughter of a Scotch peer under attainder, whose
pardon Bonfil obtains.
It must not be supposed, however, that Goldoni,
although he had now reached the apex of success and
fame, was to find his course one of plain sailing.
Enmities, rivalries, assailed him on all sides; and
these, in the Italy of that date, took a peculiarly
venomous character, men's ambitions and energies
having no such legitimate outlets as are furnished
to-day by politics and interests in the general welfare.
Everything was petty, everything was personal.
Goldoni's chief rival, and consequently enemy, was
Carlo Gozzi, the writer of fantastic dramas, and stilted,
hyperbolical dramatic fables, entirely forgotten now,
which found a certain favour among the public of that
day, one having indeed survived in European literature
in the shape of Schiller's "Turandot." A fierce skirmish
of libellous fly-sheets and derisive comedies was
carried on by the respective combatants and partisans,
filling now one theatre, now another, according as the
taste of the public was swayed or tickled.
Annoyances with the actors, graspingness on the part
of Medebac, made Goldoni abandon his company and
pass over to that conducted by Vendramin, an old
Venetian noble,—for in those days men of birth
thought it no dishonour to conduct a theatre. He
was then forty-six years of age, and had written more
than ninety theatrical works. For his new patron and
theatre he laboured with various interruptions, caused
by political events and by his own restless temperament,
until 1761, in which space of time he produced some
sixty more comedies, besides three comic operas and
plays written for a private theatre. And all this labour
in less than ten years, and among them some of his
best works, such as the trilogy of the Villeggiatura, Il
Curioso Accidente, I Rusteghi, Le Barufe Chiozote, and
many others, removed from changes of fashion, schools,
methods, to which no public has ever been or can be
indifferent, eternally fresh and sunny, filled with the
spirit of perpetual youth. Notwithstanding, however,
the excellence of Goldoni's dramas, the current literary
rivalries made themselves felt, and there was a moment
when Gozzi's Fables left Goldoni's theatre empty.
It then happened that at this juncture there came to
him an offer from Paris to go thither as playwright to
the Italian Comedy Company, established there under
royal patronage. Was it fatigue, a desire for new
laurels, a love of change, the hope of larger gains, that
induced him to accept the offer? Perhaps a little of
all these. In any case, he assented, binding himself for
two years. He was never again to leave France. Paris
fascinated him, though he regretted his lovely Venice,
and a certain nostalgia peeps forth from his letters now
and again. Still his social and pecuniary position was
good in the French capital, he was honoured and
esteemed, his nephew and adopted son had found
lucrative employment there, and, added to all this,
even Goldoni was growing old. His eyesight began to
fail; he was often indisposed, and no longer inclined
to move about and pitch his tent in various cities. A
post as Italian teacher at the court brought him
much in contact with the royal family. It strikes
the readers of the Memoirs with some amazement to
see how Goldoni could live in that society, could hear
the talk of intellectual Paris, and not be aware upon
the brink of how frightful a precipice all French society
then hovered. He actually held the king to be adored
by his subjects, and these subjects as happy as it was
possible for a people to be, well ruled, kindly governed.
The narrative of his life ends at the age of eighty, six
years before his death, two before the outbreak of the
Revolution. We have not, therefore, his impression of
the storm when it broke. We only know, alas! that
this light-hearted, gay old child—for a child he remained
to the end—died in misery, involved in the general ruin
and wreck that overwhelmed all France within that
brief space of time. It was, in fact, his nephew who
stood between him and starvation; for with the king's
deposition had vanished the pension allowed to the
aged Italian dramatist. A day after his death a decree
of the National Convention restored it to him for the
term of his days. The proposed gift came too late, but
it honours those who voted it and him who pleaded for
it, no less a person than Joseph-Marie Chénier, the
poet. When the orator learned that the benevolence
he invoked could no longer help its object, he again
pleaded for the octogenarian, or rather that the pension
should be passed on to the faithful wife in whose arms
Goldoni had passed away. "She is old," said Chénier,
"she is seventy-six, and he has left her no heritage save
his illustrious name, his virtues, and his poverty." It
is pleasant to learn that this request was conceded to
by the Convention. The French, to their honour be it
said, are ever ready to pay tribute to genius.
So sad, so dark, so gloomy, was the end of that gay,
bright spirit, Italy's greatest and most prolific comic
author. To sum up his merits in a few words is no
easy task. It is doubtful whether we should rank him
among the geniuses of the world. On the plea of intelligence
he certainly cannot claim this rank; his
intellectual perceptions might even be called mediocre,
as his Memoirs amply prove, but he had a gift, a certain
knack of catching the exterior qualities of character
and reproducing them in a skilful and amusing mode
upon the boards. His art is not of the closet kind.
What he put down he had seen, not elaborated from
out his brain, and his own genial temperament gave
it all an amiable impress. The turning-point of his
comedies is always the characters of his personages.
His plays are founded on that rather than on the
artifice of a plot, which, as compared to the former,
was held by him as of secondary importance. He distinguished
between the comedy of plot and the comedy
of character, and imposed the latter on the former,
which he held the easier of the two. His mode was
in direct contrast to that of the Spanish dramatists,
then held in great vogue, who were masters at spinning
plots, but whose characters were usually mere conventional
types. In Goldoni, action results in most
part as a consequence of the individuality of the personages
depicted, and his intrigue is directed and led
with the purpose that this may develop itself, more
especially in the protagonist. Herein consists his great
claim to being a theatrical reformer. What is to-day a
commonplace was then a novelty. We moderns study
character almost to exaggeration. In earlier drama it
was ignored, and complicated plot absorbed its place.
It was on this that Goldoni prided himself, and justly.
It was he who first invented the Commedia del Carattere.
Yet another of Goldoni's merits was his rare skill
in handling many personages at the same time, without
sacrificing their individuality or hindering the clear
and rapid progress of the scene. This gift is specially
manifest in "The Fan."
Roughly speaking, we may perhaps divide Goldoni's
plays into three classes: Those that deal with Italian
personages, and which are written in pure Italian,
among which may be comprised those written in
Martellian verse; those, including the largest number,
which are written partly in Italian and partly in
dialect; and finally, those written entirely in Venetian
dialect, which are the fewest, eleven in all. From this
it will be seen how unjust is the criticism of those who
would look on Goldoni as merely a writer of comedies
in a local dialect. It is this admixture of dialect, however,—and
a racy, good-humoured, and amiable dialect
it is, that Venetian,—which renders Goldoni's works so
difficult, indeed impossible, to translate, especially into
English, where dialects such as the Italian, which form
quite distinct languages, are unknown. Happily, for
we are thus saved much confusion of tongues, and we
hence know no such schism between written and spoken
language such as exists in Italy. Even in translation,
however, much as Goldoni's plays suffer, their life and
movement, their excellent dramatic action, and their
marvellous play of character, are not lost. To understand,
however, how eminently they are fitted for the
boards, it is needful to see them acted. Those who
have witnessed either Ristori, or her younger and more
modern rival, Eleonora Duse, in "Pamela" or "La
Locandiera," will not easily forget the dramatic treat.
Goethe in his Italian journey, while at Venice relates
how he witnessed a performance of "Le Barufe
Chiozote," and how immensely he was struck with the
stage knowledge possessed by Goldoni, and with his
marvellous truth to the life that surged around him.
"This author," writes Goethe, "merits great praise,
who out of nothing at all has constructed an agreeable
pastime." It has been objected by foreign critics that
Goldoni's dialogue is sometimes a little dull and tame.
Charles Lever, for example, could never be brought to
find Goldoni amusing. It is, however, more than probable
that a very accurate acquaintance with Italian is
required to appreciate to the full the manner in which
the plays are written, the way in which each person's
conversation is made to fit his or her character. "La
Donna di Garbo" (the title may be rendered as "A
Woman of Tact") is a case in point. This young person
seizes on the peculiar hobby or weakness of the
people around her, and plays on it in her talk. Desirous,
for weighty reasons, of becoming the wife of the
young son of a great family, this "woman of tact" gets
herself hired as a chambermaid in the household, and
so pleases every member of it that all are in the end
glad to assist her in gaining her cause. The extreme
simplicity of Goldoni's plots is truly astonishing. None
but a true adept in human nature and stage artifice
could hold audiences, as he does, spell-bound with
interest over such everyday occurrences as he selects.
His comedies recall one of Louis Chardon's articles in
Balzac's "Grand Homme de Province à Paris," beginning,
"On entre, on sort, on se promène." People go and
come, talk and laugh, get up and sit down, and the
story grows meanwhile so intensely interesting, that for
the moment there seems nothing else in the world
worthy of attention. And the secret of this? It lies
in one word: Sympathy. Goldoni himself felt with
his personages, and therefore his hearers must do the
same.
Goldoni in his Memoirs gives no account of the
production of "The Fan." It was written and first
brought out in Paris, and soon became universally
popular, especially in Venice. "The Curious Mishap"
was founded on an episode of real life which happened
in Holland, and was communicated to Goldoni as a
good subject for a play. The dénouement is the same
as in the real story, the details only are slightly altered.
The intrigue is amusing, plausible, and happily conceived.
The scene in which Monsieur Philibert endeavours
to overcome the scruples of De la Cotterie
and gives him his purse, is inimitable. Indeed, it is
worthy of Molière; for if it has not his drollery and
peculiar turn of expression, neither has it his exaggeration.
There is no farce, nothing beyond what the
situation of the parties renders natural. "The Beneficent
Bear" was first written in French, and brought
out at the time of the fêtes in honour of the marriage
of Marie Antoinette and the Dauphin, afterwards Louis
XVI. Played first in the city, and then before the
court at Fontainebleau, it was immensely successful in
both cases. For this play the writer received one
hundred and fifty louis d'or. The published edition
also brought him much money.
It was certainly a rare honour for a foreigner to have
a play represented with such success in the fastidious
French capital and in the language of Molière. He
followed it with "L'Avaro Fastoso" ("The Ostentatious
Miser"), also written in French. The fate of this drama
was less happy, owing, however, to a mere accident, for
which Goldoni was in no wise responsible. Nevertheless,
he would not allow it to be represented a second
time. He seems to have been discontented with it as
a dramatic work, though it has qualities which bring it
nearer to the modern French comédie de société than
perhaps any other play he has left behind him. "It
was born under an evil constellation," writes Goldoni,
"and every one knows how fatal a sentence that is,
especially in theatrical affairs." "The Father of the
Family" is, according to Goldoni's own opinion, one of
his best comedies; but, as he considers himself obliged
to abide by the decision of the public, he can, he says,
only place it in the second rank. It is intended to
show the superiority of a domestic training for girls
over a conventual one. "The aunt, to whom one of
the daughters is consigned, figures allegorically as the
convent," says the author, "that word being forbidden
to be pronounced on the Italian stage." "Action and
reaction are equal," says the axiom; and much, if not
all, of the present irreverent attitude of Italians towards
religious matters must be attributed to the excessive
rigour, petty and despicable detail, of the regulations
in vogue under their former priestly and priest-ridden
rulers in these respects.
Goldoni, during his residence in Paris, had an amusing
colloquy with Diderot, who was furious at an
accusation made that he had plagiarised from Goldoni
in his own play, "Le Père de Famille,"—an absurd idea,
as there is no resemblance, save in name, between the
two. It was from the Larmoyant plays of Diderot and
his school, which reflected the false sentimental tone of
the day both in France and Germany, that Goldoni had
liberated his countrymen, quite as much as from the
pseudo-classical plays to which their own land had
given birth. Diderot did not perceive this, and in his
fury wrote a slashing criticism of all the Italian's plays,
stigmatising them as "Farces in three Acts." Goldoni,
who, with all his sweetness of temper, was perfectly
fearless, simply called on Diderot, and asked him what
cause for spite he had against him and his works.
Diderot replied that some of his compositions had done
him much harm. Duni, an Italian musician, who had
introduced them to each other, at this point interposed,
saying that they should follow the advice of Tasso,—
which may be freely rendered as "Let bygones be
bygones." Diderot, who understood Italian well, accepted
the suggestion, and the two parted friends. It
is an anecdote creditable to all parties, and not least
to the two Italians.
It is a pity that Goldoni's Memoirs, from which the
above sketch of his life is derived, were written in
French instead of Italian, and with regard to a French
rather than an Italian public. Had he written in his
own language and for his own people, he might have
produced a work worthy to rank beside the wondrous
tale of Cellini, though of course of a very opposite
character. As it is, the narrative is little known,
though it has been translated into Italian and issued
in cheap form.
Such, briefly, the Italian dramatist, whose best works
in substance are the continuation of the ancient plays
of Menander and Terence, imitated by the Italians in
the sixteenth century, but allowed to degenerate, and
then again renovated and carried to perfection by
Molière in France and by himself in Italy.

Scene of action, a little village near Milan.
 
 
[An open space bounded at the back by a house bearing
the inscription Osteria (Inn). Houses to right and
left; on the left a gentleman's mansion with a low
projecting terrace. The foremost house has the
word Café upon a swinging shield; before its
main door and windows stand small tables and
chairs. It has also a back door which adjoins a
little pharmacy. At the end of the right-hand
side of houses, a small general store. The inn has
a restaurant on the ground-floor, and on the left a
small shoemaker's workshop. Right and left, between
the inn and the side houses, runs the street.]
[Evarist and the Baron sit towards the front at a little
table drinking coffee. Limonato serves them.
Crispino is cobbling in his booth, near to him
Coronato sitting beside his door, writing in a note-book.
The Boots cleans the restaurant windows.
In the middle of the stage sits the Count reading
a book. He is dressed in a white summer costume,
while the Baron and Evarist are in shooting dress,
with their guns beside them. Geltrude and
Candida on the terrace, knitting. To the right
Tognino is sweeping the square, Nina is spinning
before her house door, beside her stands Moracchio
holding two hunting dogs by a cord. Every now
and again Timoteo puts his head out of the
pharmacy; in the background Susanna, sewing
before her shop. A pause after the rise of the
curtain. All absorbed in their occupations. Crispino
hammers energetically upon a shoe at which
he is working. Timoteo is pounding loudly in a
mortar, therefore invisible.]
 
 
Scene I.
Susanna alone, comes out of her house and arranges
her wares.
Evarist from the street, his gun, on his shoulder, and
Moracchio with a gun in his hand and bag with game,
and the dogs tied by a cord. The above.
Coronato and Scavezzo return. Scavezzo goes straight
to the inn. Coronato remains aside to listen. The
above.
 
 

  Scene I.
Crispino comes out of his shop, with bread, cheese, and
a bottle of wine, seats himself on the bench, and
breakfasts. Tognino comes out of Geltrude's villa
with a broom, and crosses to the pharmacy. Coronato
and Scavezzo come out of the inn; the latter
carries a barrel on his shoulders; the former passes
Crispino, looks at him and laughs. Then both go
off. Crispino looks after him and clenches his fist.
Tognino, issuing from the pharmacy, sweeps the
square. Timoteo with glasses and bottles hurries
across to the villa. Crispino has emptied his wine-bottle,
and goes into the inn. Susanna comes out
of her shop, seats herself to do some needlework.
Tognino off into the villa. Crispino comes back,
his bottle refilled. He draws the fan from his
pocket, looks at it smiling, and seats himself again.
Nina also seats herself outside her door to spin.
Crispino hides the fan under his leather apron, and
goes on eating. Coronato comes back, passes Crispino,
and smiles. Crispino smiles also. Coronato,
arrived at his own door, turns round once more
to look at Crispino and smile, then enters. Crispino
laughs too, takes up the fan, looks at it with
pleasure, and then hides it again.
