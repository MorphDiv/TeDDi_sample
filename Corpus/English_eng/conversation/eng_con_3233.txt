did it work ? 0_1651
well I knew how to say radius but I had to say it wasn't xxx . 1651_5156
all right, because if it if they've worked, you need to cut them out and give them back to Jessica . 5156_8661
we're going to do them after . 8661_9658
all righty o@l, okay . 9658_10373
so we're doing one . 10373_11788
this just make a radius of five centimeters . 11788_16525
okay . 16525_16918
I'm not ready . 16918_24015
I think mine's right . 24015_24703
you'll find out won't you ? 24703_26548
yep . 26548_27226
can you can you can you &~bi I drew a line . 27226_29421
yes . 29421_29916
and I sort of bisected +... 29916_33123
so did you decide that that was important or the length of the line was important ? 33123_40196
the length of the line oh, no the angles . 40196_42901
angles so that's all you so try that . 42901_45201
all right ? 45201_45835
interval a@l b@l is vertical and measures five centimeters . 45835_55546
a@l b@l . 55546_57451
yeah, interval a@l b@l is vertical and measures five centimeters . 57451_61505
I think you can see they're pretty right, can't you ? 61505_69961
interval a@l c@l is horizontal, and it measures three centimeters . 69961_75746
so did it work ? 75746_109321
uhh, no because xxx . 109321_115610
interesting but are they congruent ? 115610_117566
cut them out and have a look . 117566_119901
if they fit on top . 119901_121065
they're the same but +... 121065_121813
it's the same but +/. 121813_122351
yeah, that's right so so cut them out . 122351_124775
she didn't have to did she ? 124775_127808
she's got nice paper . 127808_129039
oh sorry . 129039_129958
you could've swapped . 129958_131110
do you want a different color ? 131110_132870
I'm kidding no . 132870_133906
so that's right . 133906_135140
they're they're congruent . 135140_138165
so you cut them out and give them is it yours Natalie ? 138165_141468
that's mine that's mine . 141468_142635
all right so you um you can cut them out and give them to Louise and she can paste them on hers . 142635_148075
all right, yeah . 148075_150995
is um is this congruent ? 150995_153673
because I wasn't here on Tuesday . 153673_154395
pardon ? 154395_154810
yeah what's a &~con congruent triangles are triangles that have the sa(me) exactly the same sides, three sides are equal and three angles are equal . 154810_162673
I don't cut this out do I ? 162673_163401
no, you you cut the other two out and put them . 163401_166711
but you can cut these out . 166711_170128
all right ? 170128_170823
she can cut Natalie can cut hers out . 170823_172126
oh, can I cut this out ? 172126_173136
oh all right . 173136_173510
this is mine . 173510_175991
that's mine . 175991_178335
so have you done one yet ? 178335_190028
yeah we've done two . 190028_191240
all right . 191240_191900
xxx . 191900_193293
okay . 193293_193916
hang on . 193916_194685
I've figured it out Miss . 194685_205965
&=laughs . 205965_207820
I think anyways . 207820_210373
I I'm doing the the measurements . 210373_211635
righty o@l . 211635_212205
you don't have to do the measurements . 212205_213885
you can make combinations . 213885_216108
oh, I don't get this . 216108_220211
let's get the triangle and measure everything . 220211_223300
yeah and and do the instructions on how to make it . 223300_225531
okay well what's the xxx gonna be because xxx . 225531_229260
that's fine . 229260_231563
yeah, all right ? 231563_233601
so have you done two ? 233601_255891
one xxx . 255891_257928
eight point seven centimeters . 257928_259690
I don't think that was necessary . 259690_267111
mine's like five centimeters long . 267111_271671
mine's eight point seven . 271671_274193
jessica . 274193_274918
mine's eight point five . 274918_276406
do you are you using yeah, a compass to draw the +/. 276406_279145
we would have to measure the xxx . 279145_280808
ah, right . 280808_281141
xxx . 281141_282878
it was sixty degrees . 282878_283561
that's all right . 283561_284143
and it was six centimeters long . 284143_285605
and then +... 285605_286376
six . 286376_287736
draw a line from the top down to the xxx . 287736_291510
draw a line at forty degrees that is five point one centimeters long . 291510_317468
Miss what should we do now ? 317468_318705
pardon ? 318705_319353
what should we do now ? 319353_320340
have you done all of them have you ? 320340_321641
yep . 321641_321871
yeah . 321871_322408
well, did you end up working out how many instructions you actually needed for each one ? 322408_327066
yep, I needed four . 327066_329768
you needed four, what were they ? 329768_331320
um, interval a@l b@l is vertical and measures five centimeters . 331320_335391
interval a@l c@l is horizontal xxx . 335391_340353
so if it's saying horizontal it's saying it's at an angle aren't you ? 340353_343353
yeah . 343353_346680
so we're saying one's vertical and one's horizontal . 346680_348546
yeah and you um +... 348546_349503
then you're defining the angle between them aren't you ? 349503_350840
mm, I'm saying it's a right angle . 350840_352925
yes . 352925_354215
because interval interval a@l b@l c@l is a right angle . 354215_359215
right, so did they need all those instructions to finish your triangle ? 359215_362518
yes . 362518_363110
yes . 363110_364180
draw an arc from angle, uh, angle c@l joining to the b@l c@l which is the hypotenuse and draw a dot in any xxx . 364180_370660
all right, so you started with a line that was vertical . 370660_372933
yep . 372933_373365
and then a line that was horizontal of a certain length . 373365_375571
yep . 375571_375941
and then you joined them . 375941_377796
yes . 377796_378890
so what did you +/. 378890_380441
and it was a right angle . 380441_381206
yes, and the right angle so you had two sides and a right angle and then joined them . 381206_385820
yeah, and then +... 385820_386211
the arc on the arc on angle c@l and then join the interval +... 386211_386788
and then joined them . 386788_390246
did you what was the arc on angle c@l ? 390246_391796
show me . 391796_392796
right, did you actually have to have so did you tell them what length that was ? 392796_399325
no . 399325_400090
I just said join it . 400090_401133
no, you didn't have to . 401133_401820
which is the hypotenuse . 401820_402435
join it, yes . 402435_403373
yes, so you only needed two sides and the right angle . 403373_405020
yep . 405020_405413
mm okay . 405413_406936
what did you need ? 406936_407936
three . 407936_408620
and what was it ? 408620_410036
okay, I took my set square and drew a straight line nine centimeters for the base . 410036_414078
um, number two, I then made ninety degrees set square +... 414078_417735
pardon ? 417735_418123
it's, well how long was the base, did you say ? 418123_420470
um, nine centimeters . 420470_421908
right . 421908_422325
yes . 422325_423156
and so you drew a right angle as well ? 423156_425683
yeah . 425683_426148
yes . 426148_427013
um, number two, I then made ninety degrees set square along the line, the end on the corner, and drew a straight line up six point two centimeters . 427013_436335
yes . 436335_436786
number three I then joined the both ends up with the right angle triangle +... 436786_443198
so you had the same thing, you had a right angle and two sides . 443198_445245
yeah . 445245_445771
and the degrees were ninety degrees so +... 445771_447428
right . 447428_447970
did you have anything different ? 447970_448818
nope . 448818_449370
you had the same thing . 449370_450410
almost . 450410_451321
you all did right angles . 451321_453190
yep . 453190_455551
so no imagination . 455551_457886
nope . 457886_458568
&=laughs all right . 458568_461575
so that's one of the think and see if you can think of the same triangle if you could've given different instructions to have done the same triangle . 461575_471605
yep . 471605_473951
see if you can all end up with different ideas . 473951_480781
okay . 480781_481470
so how did you end up ? 481470_489086
good . 489086_489710
good . 489710_490253
we all won . 490253_490831
we have to check them . 490831_491441
I won . 491441_492130
no we all won . 492130_493540
yeah, were were they all different ? 493540_495660
no, they're all the same . 495660_496725
they're all the same . 496725_497910
so what was the same ? 497910_498480
what did you end up having to write ? 498480_500215
construct a right angle +... 500215_500855
what did you end up having to draw ? 500855_503588
oh . 503588_504398
triangles . 504398_505061
yeah . 505061_505806
congruent triangles, they're all congruent . 505806_508080
yes, but what were the instructions ? 508080_510116
um, I couldn't um +... 510116_512531
draw an eight centimeter line . 512531_514885
yes . 514885_515291
um, make a radius of five centimeters . 515291_518549
mm hm . 518549_519331
yeah . 519331_521150
she did not say that . 521150_522260
yeah, that's all right . 522260_522893
um, place the point of the compass at the right end of the line and draw a circle . 522893_526788
yes . 526788_527308
of what size ? 527308_528813
pardon ? 528813_529771
yeah . 529771_530491
um, with a five centimeter radius . 530491_532066
yeah . 532066_532523
um, uh and make a +... 532523_534346
where am I ? 534346_537058
oh, make a seven centimeter radius and draw a circle from the left end of the line . 537058_541270
yes . 541270_541788
and join where the point +... 541788_543876
so what did you end up doing ? 543876_545426
the edited version . 545426_545988
was it all the sides, all the angles, a combination ? 545988_549220
pardon ? 549220_551143
what did you end up with ? 551143_552261
all the same sides and angles . 552261_554293
all the sides, yeah . 554293_555213
yep you end up with all the same angles but what did you tell them to draw, sides or angles ? 555213_558196
um, sides . 558196_559236
all sides . 559236_559748
yeah . 559748_560245
did you draw all sides ? 560245_561565
um, I said an angle of sixty degrees and then but and then two lines . 561565_567461
