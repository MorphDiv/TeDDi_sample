well the story is about a man sitting in a club in the commercial
so they could go to to have dinner at a restaurant where they had
but the restaurant was gone .
so a police officer came up and asked him +...
he assured the police that wasn't nothing wrong .
he was just waiting for an old friend .
so the police told him he hoped he'd see his old friend and went on
so the man sat there for a while .
and then another gentleman came up .
so the man came up .
he say +"/.
+" is that you Bob ?
he said +"/.
+" yeah .
but then it wasn't him .
(be)cause he saw that when he lit the cigarette .
he said was he doing good .
how the West treated him .
he said it was alright .
then the man told him he was under arrest .
but the police officer in plain clothes told him he was under arrest .
because he was wanted somewhere .
actually Bob who was really supposed to come see him saw when he lit
and when the light flashed on his face .
he knew that it was a man wanted by the Chicago want+ads .
wanted by the Chicago police .
he couldn't do it himself .
