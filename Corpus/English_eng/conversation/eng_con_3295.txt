no, yoshi+kun . 5000_5990
let's begin .
masa+kun, please . 10140_11120
stand up . 11120_16010
straight . 16010_17950
bow . 17950_19080
please teach us well . 19080_20050
please pay attention . 20050_25080
today, we ask ms . 25080_33000
yasui to help us .
where is the white chalk ?
do you remember we did a survey the last time ? 33000_61010
watch on the board .
will any material generate heat when an electric current flows through it ? 61010_64970
quiet . 64970_65990
quiet . 65990_66990
quiet, aren't they ? 66990_67880
very quiet . 67880_74020
I've only experienced such quietness two three times .
then everyone please read today's theme .
one, two .
will any material generate heat when an electric current flows through it ? 74020_79160
that's what I asked you the last time, right ? 79160_81110
refill lead of a mechanical pencil, things like that, your answers were clearly divided unexpectedly with these three items . 81110_113930
I would like to confirm it again . 113930_117040
enamel wire, miso soup, refill lead of a mechanical pencil . 117040_122970
I will demonstrate an experiment now .
will they generate heat ? 122970_127010
raise your hand for the item which you think will generate heat .
okay ?
how many times can I raise my hand ? 127010_128090
if you think all three will, then you can raise your hand three times . 128090_132990
enamel wire . 132990_138140
this .
enamel wire .
you must have made electromagnets in elementary school . 138140_145080
it's the conducting wire which you wound at that time .
then miso soup . 145080_146940
today, I will use one with red bean paste .
miso soup with read bean paste .
can we eat it ? 146940_147990
yes . 147990_151150
if there are leftovers, I will give it to masa .
and some refill lead of a mechanical pencil . 151150_154910
then I will ask you . 154910_161140
okay ?
then who thinks that the enamel wire will generate heat ?
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three . 161140_172000
okay .
twenty+three .
miso soup . 172000_173950
miso soup with read bean paste .
yes . 173950_175150
only with read bean paste ? 175150_176910
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven . 176910_180960
okay .
that has a lot of sodium . 180960_182890
then the lead of a mechanical pencil . 182890_184170
this is serious . 184170_185960
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten eleven twelve . 185960_190970
okay .
then . 190970_196950
can anyone tell that it is certain from your own experience ?
anyone ?
what ? 196950_197980
from your own experience, since you have done it before . 197980_202050
can anyone tell for sure ?
haven't you done it before ? 202050_203100
oh, the lead of a mechanical pencil . 203100_206110
yes, matsui+kun . 206110_210170
yes .
please stand up and speak .
look at the camera . 210170_211920
oh, no . 211920_212950
what ? 212950_214160
what ?
stand and speak . 218060_219110
uh ? 219110_220160
stand up and speak . 220160_221010
it conducts electric current . 221010_222140
the teacher of shop class said so . 222140_223150
said so . 223150_224010
said so . 224010_227930
that's fine .
you can sit down .
then lead of a mechanical pencil . 227930_231940
these twelve people may be right .
anything else ?
do you have experience ?
no . 231940_232920
no ? 232920_236980
then should we experiment in order ?
then first we'll do it with an enamel wire .
since it is hard to see my operation, ms . 236980_257920
yasui will project it on that tv .
but come to the front as usual .
please .
can people in the front squat down ? 257920_262060
if you cannot see it, you can watch the monitor . 262060_269980
murai+kun, you are the assistant . 269980_275050
please hold this .
so everyone can see the thermometer . 275050_279890
can you see what the temperature is now ?
it won't reach all the way . 279890_280090
oh, it won't reach ? 280090_282010
what is the temperature ? 283950_285010
eight . 285010_286040
eight degrees, right ? 286040_290930
right now it's eight degrees .
then now I will make an electric current flow through this .
here, at the tip of the thermometer, I have wound the enamel wire . 290930_301120
if it generates heat, the thermometer will indicate it .
ouch, ouch . 301120_306130
ouch .
watch this . 306130_310980
oh, it is disconnected .
wait . 310980_314970
okay .
watch .
it is increasing, right ?
it is . 314970_315960
what is the temperature now ? 315960_317000
thirty+two . 317000_318130
seventeen . 318130_320080
it was only eight degrees before, but it's already seventeen degrees . 320080_322970
it's already about twenty . 322970_323980
it's still rising . 323980_325020
yes .
it's almost twenty .
it's rising more and more . 325020_326940
I am getting an electric shock . 326940_327950
I am not getting it at all . 327950_330080
see ?
it's already twenty five . 330080_335950
should I show it to you ?
look at the monitor .
where is it ? 335950_337120
teacher, where is it ? 337120_340150
can you see that it has increased ? 340150_343060
wow . 343060_344980
it's increasing more and more . 344980_345130
did it increase ? 345130_346900
it's increasing . 346900_347010
this means that ? 347010_348990
it's increasing . 348990_349170
it's increasing . 349170_350990
it's increasing, right ? 350990_351140
why don't you do it putting this down ? 351140_353960
it's already thirty degrees . 353960_355080
next, next . 355080_356090
it increased so much . 356090_357100
it increased so much . 357100_359060
it was eight degrees, so how many degrees did it increase ?
twenty+two . 359060_360990
twenty+two . 360990_362950
very well .
that means that an enamel wire is fine . 362950_370030
it generates heat .
then next let's do it with miso soup .
miso soup .
do we do all of this ? 370030_372040
miso soup is here, here . 372040_375990
I don't like it somehow . 375990_376980
I don't like it . 376980_377950
this is a present far you, matsui+kun . 377950_379110
far you ? 379110_380960
far you ? 380960_383150
she spoke incorrect English . 383150_384990
her English is incorrect . 384990_386020
you spoke incorrect English . 386020_387050
it's okay . 387050_388950
she is a science teacher . 388950_389950
she spoke incorrect English . 389950_394100
then we use this aluminum foil as an electric pole and put this in the beaker . 394100_400960
you can leave it here . 400960_403050
teacher, aren't you going to give me the one which is in the bag ? 403050_406060
this one, right ? 406060_412990
I will give it to you, matsui, so don't worry .
okay ?
I put another electric pole here . 412990_415940
there is something in the miso soup . 418900_420010
oh, that's true . 420010_421900
seaweed is in there . 421900_424980
don't worry about my cooking . 424980_431110
right now . 431110_438880
it's five degrees .
five degrees .
five degrees .
now I will connect this to the power source . 438880_448080
can you see ? 448080_449930
can you see the inside of the miso soup is moving as soon as the switch was turned on ? 449930_457880
the temperature is rising . 457880_459990
the temperature is rising .
it's rising, right ? 459990_461920
it's rising, it's rising . 461920_461980
can you see ? 461980_462010
i was right . 462010_464080
I was right .
I was right .
I was right .
I will put it in the front . 464080_467980
can you see ? 467980_470930
imai+kun, is it on ?
huh ? 470930_471960
is it on ? 471960_474020
something is brewing . 474020_475930
is steam generating ? 475930_481970
it's also bubbling .
what is the temperature now ?
what is the temperature now ?
twenty . 481970_483880
now twenty degrees . 483880_486060
it was five but it went up fifteen degrees .
bubbles are oozing . 486060_488110
are bubbles oozing ? 488110_490130
try to touch it . 490130_492880
it's warm .
hot . 492880_494050
not hot .
it's warm .
it's warm, right ? 494050_498120
touch it .
it's warm . 498120_501120
it doesn't taste good . 501120_502880
what is the temperature now ? 502880_506900
teacher, that's no good . 506900_507890
forty degrees . 507890_508990
it's rapidly increasing . 508990_509900
it's stinks . 509900_510990
is this about right to drink ? 510990_513030
fifty degrees . 513030_514110
fifty degrees ? 514110_519990
then, masa+kun, it's perfect to drink now .
this means ? 519990_522020
oh . 522020_523070
miso soup is also ? 523070_524010
it's burnt . 524010_526150
okay . 527080_533170
then, next, at last, shall we do it with the lead of a mechanical pencil ?
this got very hot . 533170_535900
it will break .
it will break ? 535900_538000
stop it .
then next is the lead of a mechanical pencil . 538000_542880
then first, since I had some steel wool, I brought it . 542880_559030
this one I think everyone can see well .
I will do it with the steel wool as well .
after I set it here . 559030_566890
that's fine . 566890_568930
the connection is not good .
oh, it's burning . 568930_569890
hot, hot, hot ! 569890_573160
it's burnt out ! 573160_575100
it's burnt out !
hot, hot ! 575100_577000
it's burnt out !
did you see that it burnt ? 577000_580050
what is that, teacher ? 580050_581020
this is steel wool . 581020_587010
right now, it's about two volts .
zoom up more . 587010_590170
max . 590170_591940
maximum . 591940_593110
it's already burning . 593110_600970
steel burns .
that means that it generated heat .
then, at last, the mechanical pencil . 600970_603930
in short, you just brought something which generate heat, right ? 603930_604930
of course . 604930_606120
I knew it . 606120_607170
there is something which generates heat here . 607170_616970
then I will do it with the mechanical pencil . 616970_636890
oh ! 636890_638120
acid rain !
it started smoking . 638120_648100
it started smoking, so wait for a while .
people in the front, be careful . 648100_653020
it may jump .
I'm fine because I'm wearing glasses . 653020_656980
then I will increase the voltage . 656980_662990
right now I am increasing the voltage .
something is changing a little . 662990_665000
oh, it became red ! 665000_666040
it became red !
not a little bit . 666040_668150
a lot .
if you touch it, you will burn yourself . 668150_670970
you won't burn yourself . 670970_672120
this means that the lead of mechanical pencils also ? 672120_674160
conducts heat . 674160_675980
yes, it generates heat, right ? 675980_677930
it conducts heat . 677930_679040
rather, it means that it conducts electric current, and generates heat . 679040_683900
it's bent . 683900_686900
it got thinner . 686900_687900
when it conducts heat ? 687900_688990
can you use the lead ? 688990_690990
it already got so thin . 690990_693020
then go back to your seat . 693020_709980
almost anything will generate heat when current flows through it . 709980_718890
that is what I showed you with electric discharge when we studied electric current and electrons . 718890_726900
the flow of an electric current means the electrons are flowing .
because the electron flow bumps atoms of the material, when they bump with atoms, it generates heat . 726900_737080
so today, the amount of heat generated, we will measure through an experiment the amount of heat that is generated . 737080_744950
what is this heat related to ? 744950_754960
as I just showed you, first, we increased the voltage, right ?
so, it is probably related to the voltage . 754960_764090
and if you increase the voltage, logically, what flows a lot ?
current . 764090_765020
current flows, right ? 765020_766120
so today, we will investigate through an experiment how heat increases in relation to the value derived from voltage times current . 766120_780140
then look at the ohp . 780140_783950
ms . 783950_790020
yasui is giving you some worksheets like this now .
today, you will confirm through an experiment that heat generated by electric current is related to the value of voltage times current . 790020_799020
I will explain to you how to do it . 799020_811110
I think now you got the worksheet, but first set up the equipment like this figure .
it doesn't show in this figure, but I think it will be good if you prepared a stand like this . 811110_816950
then I will explain to you how to set up . 816950_824120
are you okay ? 824120_836060
could you keep looking at this ?
watch the ohp .
first, set up the thermometer .
and hang the thermometer about in the middle of the water .
and in order to measure the voltage and the current, take a voltmeter and a ammeter . 836060_841950
the power source to use today is this power source . 841950_853910
the container to put it in is this polystyrol container, so it will melt if it touches heat, right ?
so the electric heating wire that generates heat, today we use this but when you put it in, make sure it doesn't touch the bottom or the side . 853910_865000
it may melt . 865000_874930
so you hang a thermometer, but someone should be responsible and hold this heating wire with their hand .
it won't hurt you .
and the water will get warmer by the convection current, stir once in a while and measure the temperature . 874930_882170
ammeter is in series circuit, voltmeter is in a parallel circuit, the tip is sticking out, so connect the clips here . 882170_892880
two each .
and, please measure the temperature of the water before you start . 892880_897940
when you did the survey the last time, I found that you forgot how to calculate heat energy . 897940_902030
but when you calculate heat energy, the amount of heat that was generated by this electric heating wire is the same as the value which the water receives . 902030_911930
so in order to calculate heat energy, the mass of water in this container multiplied by the increase in temperature . 911930_922920
in order for everyone to have the same amount of water, I have measured one hundred grams and put in there today . 922920_929060
okay ?
I have prepared one hundred grams of water here which has been measured, so please take it from here . 929060_939020
the thermometer is also in there .
and uh . 939020_945900
each group read the value of the current with specified voltage .
and the number of increased temperature will be measured after five minutes . 945900_957020
since we have a limited time, I have a stopwatch and everyone will start at the same time .
so please tell me when your group finishes setting up the equipment and are ready . 957020_963880
when everyone is ready, we will measure five minutes .
now, since every group will measure with a specified voltage, can you please write the voltage here ? 963880_975120
here .
first these three rows, no, these three groups . 975120_985880
these three groups, please do it with three volts and six volts .
so here, write three volts and six volts .
then, this row, write three volts and six volts in here . 985880_987050
what ? 987050_988130
this row, write three volts and six volts . 988130_991120
then these two groups in the middle, write four volts and eight volts . 991120_1002150
and people over there, please do it with five volts and seven volts .
do we adjust to seven volts ? 1002150_1003880
yes . 1003880_1008930
please adjust seven volts with the voltmeter precisely .
five volts and ? 1008930_1010020
five volts and seven volts . 1010020_1016910
then, I will explain to you again . 1016910_1020900
face this way .
for example, these groups have three volts and six volts here, right ? 1020900_1025020
during the experiment, this group will give three volts of voltage at the same time as everyone and measure five minutes . 1025020_1031150
read the ammeter, and see how many amperes it is . 1031150_1040890
and after five minutes, write how much temperature increase there was .
and this part was to compare the values of voltage times current, so these three volts+and if this is zero point two amperes, for example, three times zero point two and this becomes one point five volt+amperes . 1040890_1053970
and as for heat energy, you calculate mass of the water times temperature increase . 1053970_1060140
okay ?
when you are done, you will have an ohp sheet which ms . 1060140_1068090
yasui will give to you .
ohp sheets look like this .
this graph is to record the relationship between the value of voltage times current and the number for increased temperature of the water . 1068090_1075920
and as for this one, please record the relation between the value of voltage times current and the amount of heat generated . 1075920_1081080
and when you record, just mark dots like this one . 1081080_1090890
this group will have values for three volts and six volts, right ?
this group will have values for four volts and eight volts, right ? 1090890_1096020
this group will have values for five volts and seven volts, right ?
will appear nicely as dots . 1107980_1116110
so we should be able to infer the relationship between them .
okay ?
I spoke fast, but did you understand the procedure ?
we will come over when you are not sure . 1116110_1124930
what you have to prepare is the electric heating wire, here .
voltmeter and ammeter .
take the power source from there as usual . 1124930_1135030
and each group take two cups, okay ?
we measure twice, okay ?
for three volts and six volts .
so prepare those although we use one of them first . 1135030_1141010
do you have any questions ?
no . 1141010_1142010
you don't ? 1142010_1149060
then each group, get ready .
stands are over there . 1149060_1166120
sorry, sorry . 1166120_1169130
I have to put the thermometer for the miso+soup as well . 1169130_1181060
you need two cups . 1181060_1183930
one for five volts and another for seven volts .
oh . 1183930_1184970
you must change . 1184970_1187050
you told me I have to do well . 1187050_1189910
I told you to do well during the experiment . 1189910_1194120
isn't' this xxx ? 1194120_1199010
don't touch it .
teacher, the thermometer too ? 1199010_1200170
the thermometer too . 1200170_1202160
do I need xxx ? 1202160_1204110
should I take this ? 1204110_1205970
don't drop it . 1205970_1208130
xxx . 1208130_1214030
wasn't there enough ? 1214030_1218950
how many were there ? 1218950_1219890
there must have been eight . 1219890_1225880
should I do it with this group ? 1225880_1236020
ohp needs to be marked clearly so please write with this .
then first set up .
when you are done setting up, everyone starts together . 1236020_1243090
isn't it better to hang it in this side ? 1243090_1254140
it is unstable .
hang it so that it will be in the water . 1254140_1260150
teacher, this ? 1260150_1261090
about five minutes . 1261090_1262150
the spring+like thing . 1262150_1263160
oh, electric heating wire ? 1263160_1265930
huh ? 1265930_1275020
there should be eight .
sorry, did anyone take two heating wires ?
there should have been eight of these .
oh, you took too many, okay, okay . 1275020_1277970
here they are . 1277970_1288910
put the thermometer in the cup and set it up . 1288910_1291070
no, from the side . 1292090_1293920
yes, yes . 1293920_1305910
you measure the temperature of the water first .
this is unstable, so from this side .
since we want to measure the temperature of the water first, please hurry up and set up the water . 1305910_1315110
after hanging it, support it with your hand . 1315110_1323010
kawai+san . 1323010_1326090
here, it's your turn, masago .
you have to hold this one like this . 1326090_1328040
yes . 1328040_1334110
that's why you should hang the thermometer .
masago+kun, you turn that so that you can hang the string . 1334110_1337110
oh . 1337110_1350970
why don't you put it here ? 1350970_1377960
and set it in a series circuit . 1377960_1383970
which one is positive ?
this one, right ? 1383970_1389970
yes, yes .
this one is negative, right ? 1389970_1393100
and this one is positive .
this one, this one . 1393100_1400150
this one may fall off . 1400150_1401080
that's fine . 1401080_1403070
yes . 1403070_1406900
then please wait if you finished setting up .
if you are behind in setting up, I will help you . 1406900_1410080
oh ! 1410080_1412140
should I help you ? 1412140_1414070
are you finished setting up ?
is this okay ? 1414070_1417120
oh . 1417120_1428890
milli ampere is hard to see, so leave it as a bigger ampere .
this one, you can leave as fifteen volts, since we didn't predict how much current will flow yet .
are you done ? 1428890_1431940
set the ammeter in a series circuit . 1431940_1437010
plus five amperes, right ? 1437010_1452120
and this one ?
this one is positive, so connect the negative here .
and put this one here .
are you done ? 1452120_1461140
why don't you do it from the side ? 1461140_1472140
like this .
this clip is dirty so it may be better to change it .
this is a clean one . 1472140_1474960
here you are . 1474960_1481950
please someone hold it .
here you are .
then record the original water temperature when you are done setting up . 1481950_1485940
record the original water temperature . 1485940_1492000
are you done setting up ? 1492000_1498120
hurry up and set up, since everyone is waiting for you .
how many volts should we have first ? 1498120_1505070
five amperes . 1505070_1506150
you have to connect one to the ammeter . 1506150_1520950
is this positive ?
then put this to the positive .
and this ? 1520950_1526130
should we put this to here then ? 1526130_1529920
mei, the ammeter is not connected . 1529920_1535010
this one goes to positive . 1535010_1547040
this one .
this one is positive, mei .
here .
and .
bring this to here .
bring the five+ampere terminal to here .
one more, one more .
are you done ? 1550170_1554900
yamase+kun's group, are you done ?
okay ?
then we will start five minutes from now . 1554900_1566940
set the first voltage with the voltmeter .
then we will start . 1566940_1569000
first we do it with four volts . 1569000_1570050
first, set it to your voltage . 1570050_1572980
if you do it with three volts and six volts, start with three volts first . 1572980_1577880
if you do it with four volts and eight volts, start with four volts .
if you do it with five volts and seven volts, start with five volts . 1577880_1581010
you adjust with the voltmeter, you know ? 1581010_1582110
it's this one, right ? 1582110_1583170
yes . 1583170_1598960
read with the voltmeter .
not that one .
read it with the voltmeter .
anyone that doesn't understand ?
ms . 1598960_1603900
yasui, are we ready ?
ms . 1603900_1608960
yasui, are we ready ?
ready ? 1608960_1616160
then we will do it for five minutes .
okay ?
yes . 1616160_1623970
are we ready ?
ready ?
then ready, go !
then, put in the water . 1623970_1627130
wait, wait . 1627130_1629990
we cannot wait . 1629990_1631130
stir sometimes . 1631130_1640050
stir sometimes, please .
read the voltmeter now . 1640050_1644040
it was hot . 1644040_1646060
you are doing it with four volts, right ? 1646060_1648080
does it say four volts ?
yes . 1648080_1649040
yes ? 1649040_1650050
huh ? 1650050_1651080
you have to adjust it to four volts . 1651080_1652130
huh ? 1652130_1653950
we adjusted it before, didn't we ?
did something move ? 1653950_1656050
huh ? 1656050_1657030
the current is not flowing . 1657030_1658140
is there some part which is disconnected ? 1658140_1660110
really ? 1660110_1663980
let's turn it off once . 1663980_1665910
was it okay before ? 1665910_1667040
yes, it was . 1667040_1669160
did it short circuit ? 1669160_1681900
are the positive and the negative okay ? 1681900_1684120
this is positive, so this is positive . 1684120_1692040
this one is negative .
this is correct .
then should we do it again ?
it's not increasing . 1693070_1694000
it's not increasing, is it ? 1694000_1695080
why ? 1695080_1703930
why is it not increasing ? 1703930_1710900
a little bit . 1710900_1712990
can I disconnect it once ? 1712990_1720890
I will xxx .
your group was supposed to do it with four volts and eight volts, right ? 1720890_1727930
then you can start next with eight volts .
this one, right ? 1736050_1739090
it goes from positive and here, right ?
and put the positive of the voltmeter here . 1739090_1747970
teacher, it is not good if this and this are touching, is it ? 1747970_1750050
yes, it's better if it's not touching . 1750050_1752030
they are touching . 1752030_1753170
then let's try now . 1753170_1756160
it's not going up yet ? 1756160_1757020
it's not going up . 1757020_1758010
why is that ? 1758010_1759950
the voltmeter is working . 1759950_1773150
how about the ammeter ?
the ammeter is not working either .
nothing is wrong with the power source . 1773150_1779890
did it touch the heating wire by mistake ? 1779890_1790160
it went up . 1790160_1791140
it went up ? 1791140_1803030
then the connection was wrong, since you pulled these so they were not connected well .
xxx then, it's too bad, but you do it with eight volts .
I was worried . 1803030_1804010
next one, right ? 1804010_1805010
yes, you can do the next one . 1805010_1808920
you can get the data from the neighboring group . 1808920_1813010
did it work ? 1813010_1814950
voltmeter was working till just now . 1814950_1817040
we have problems . 1817040_1818110
mr . 1818110_1824040
cameraman, we have problems .
did you connect correctly ? 1824040_1829080
oh, it went up . 1829080_1831060
it went up fine . 1831060_1833960
it went up ? 1833960_1836110
oh it went back ?
move this one too . 1836110_1837900
it's too much . 1837900_1838880
how many volts are you suppose to have ? 1838880_1839050
five volts . 1839050_1840110
not yet, not yet . 1840110_1842000
little less, little less . 1842000_1843890
stop .
did it work ? 1843890_1844900
yes, it did work . 1844900_1845930
then you start with the next seven volts also . 1845930_1848980
huh ? 1848980_1849970
since these five minutes have already started . 1849970_1852900
okay ?
teacher, was something wrong with that part ? 1852900_1853970
this part was bent, so I think the connection inside was not good . 1853970_1854010
oh, I see . 1854010_1858140
don't bend here . 1858140_1861090
we didn't do it . 1861090_1862100
really ? 1862100_1863130
why me ? 1863130_1864900
yes, yes . 1864900_1867950
then, next you can measure the seven volts well, right ? 1867950_1878080
then get the data from your neighboring group .
stir it sometimes . 1878080_1884140
thirty seconds more . 1884140_1888890
thirty seconds more . 1888890_1893910
that's fine . 1893910_1898990
it's three volts, right ?
then zero point six amperes, right ?
calculate here now . 1898990_1905160
it's three volts times zero point six amperes, so how much ?
you can calculate in your head . 1905160_1908110
one point eight . 1908110_1909010
yes, one point eight . 1909010_1916100
volt+amperes .
then . 1916100_1920160
write volt+amperes .
now, measure the temperature . 1922050_1926930
how many degrees did it increase from the original temperature ?
can you take turns ? 1926930_1932130
you guys . 1932130_1934960
you xxx .
thirty+seven . 1934960_1936110
thirty+seven ? 1936110_1937040
thirty+seven . 1937040_1941060
then please write how many degrees it has increased . 1941060_1946010
then we will do the next one . 1946010_1950150
change the cup .
thirty degrees celsius . 1950150_1955060
then what about this one ?
change the cup . 1955060_1958080
we will do it for the next five minutes .
is thirty the number that increased ? 1958080_1959170
it increased from seven to thirty seven, right ? 1959170_1964070
then your group is doing it with six volts, right ? 1964070_1972100
six volts next, right ?
while the thermometer settles down, you can calculate heat energy . 1972100_1979980
in order to make the thermometer settle down, calculate heat energy .
I forgot how to calculate heat energy . 1979980_1983060
turn off the power source . 1983060_1989030
next you will increase the voltage, so I think it is better to increase the ampere too . 1989030_1996020
wait until the water temperature is settled . 1996020_1998160
water mass was one hundred grams . 1998160_1999990
one hundred grams ? 1999990_2000170
yes . 2000170_2002080
wait a minute . 2003980_2005970
it wasn't thirty seven .
it was forty seven .
your group only had a little increase ? 2005970_2007080
yes . 2007080_2008090
well, that's fine . 2008090_2011170
that is your result .
how many amperes was the current ?
three . 2011170_2012890
huh ? 2012890_2013880
how many amperes was the current at that time ? 2013880_2016940
it increased around here first . 2016940_2023980
was it around here ?
one hundred, around here ?
how many ? 2023980_2025890
uh . 2025890_2029890
zero point five .
was it zero point five ? 2029890_2036940
then write here zero point five amperes .
then, this was voltage times current, so three times zero point five . 2036940_2043160
three times zero point five . 2043160_2053890
zero point five is half . 2053890_2057990
so what is half of three volts ?
one point five . 2057990_2058090
one point five, right ? 2058090_2063060
one point five .
read this, “volt+ampere” . 2063060_2066980
do I write it like this ? 2066980_2068990
and write a dot here since this is multiplication . 2068990_2071970
then what about the amount of heat generated ? 2071970_2079130
it increased two degrees right ?
how many calories ? 2079130_2083020
one hundred times two equals ?
two hundred . 2083020_2083960
yes, two hundred calories . 2083960_2091980
do it like that .
how do you read current ampere ? 2091980_2093890
you have to read it as volt+ampere . 2093890_2095890
three times . 2096880_2099120
your current was twelve point five amperes ?
yes . 2099120_2100940
is this fifteen ? 2100940_2102910
that's voltmeter . 2102910_2104910
how about the ammeter ?
huh ? 2104910_2106010
isn't this ampere ?
this was twelve point five amperes ? 2106010_2108140
it was three . 2108140_2109970
huh ? 2109970_2110010
huh ? 2110010_2111140
this was, right ? 2111140_2114980
you wrote twelve point five .
was the current really twelve point five ?
no, it was three . 2114980_2116030
three . 2116030_2117020
it was wrong, right ? 2117020_2118010
no, it wasn't . 2118010_2119000
ouch . 2120160_2121140
ouch . 2121140_2123120
how much ?
ouch . 2123120_2124160
it can only measure up to five amperes, so it cannot be possible to measure twelve point five amperes . 2124160_2127130
what we measured was three and six . 2127130_2129050
that's voltage . 2129050_2135050
I'm asking about the electric current .
was the current flow twelve point five amperes ?
huh ? 2135050_2136930
the ammeter . 2136930_2138910
did twelve point five amperes flow ?
she is asking how much current flowed . 2138910_2143030
we adjusted this before, didn't we ? 2143030_2144940
only three amperes flowed . 2144940_2146880
no, no . 2146880_2150930
what I am saying is that you adjusted the voltmeter to three volts, right ?
we didn't . 2150930_2151940
what ? 2151940_2153060
what did you adjust to three volts then ? 2155060_2163080
this is a ammeter .
this is the voltmeter . 2163080_2166050
huh ? 2166050_2172100
but nobody noticed . 2172100_2173160
nobody noticed ? 2173160_2176020
teacher xxx, didn't she ? 2176020_2178910
no, I said adjust it with this one . 2178910_2181970
did she say that ? 2181970_2182940
this data . 2182940_2187030
I thought the temperature went up too much .
saki+chan . 2187030_2188890
since you cannot use this data, start with six volts . 2188890_2190920
yes . 2190920_2192080
oh, no . 2192080_2193910
we, we were holding this all the time . 2193910_2198130
we were holding it .
this is a ammeter . 2198130_2200170
do we have to adjust with this one ? 2200170_2201910
unless it is voltmeter, you cannot measure voltage . 2201910_2203990
well then, we will start the next experiment . 2206940_2211010
then please read the thermometer . 2211010_2216020
then we will start . 2216020_2230070
okay ?
measure voltage with voltmeter .
you cannot measure it with a ammeter .
we will start .
we will start . 2230070_2232120
ready .
teacher, teacher, wait a second . 2232120_2234090
should I wait a little bit ? 2234090_2235900
four more minutes . 2235900_2241920
this is wet . 2241920_2242910
what are you doing ? 2242910_2243010
what are you doing ? 2243010_2244000
hold it with your hand, don't be lazy . 2245080_2251120
you are making everyone wait .
hurry, hurry . 2251120_2252080
put it down, put it down .
ready ? 2252080_2255880
the group over there . 2255880_2258910
did you read the thermometer ?
of course . 2258910_2259950
yoshikawa+kun, did you read the thermometer ? 2259950_2261940
we are reading it right now . 2261940_2263890
can I raise this to here ? 2263890_2265120
that's fine . 2265120_2271090
don't worry about it .
oh, no . 2271090_2273920
I will start . 2273920_2275930
ready ?
go .
seriously ? 2275930_2276930
ready, go . 2276930_2277940
voltage should be six, right ? 2277940_2279000
six, six, six . 2279000_2284940
this should be eight voltage this time, right ? 2284940_2286900
yes . 2286900_2287010
yes . 2287010_2288130
bubble is oozing . 2288130_2289170
that's fine . 2289170_2291120
is it okay ? 2291120_2292090
stir it once in a while . 2292090_2301890
don't make a mistake this time . 2301890_2305170
oh .
oh .
this one is one point five, right ? 2305170_2307130
only five amperes, right ? 2307130_2308990
yes .
five amperes ? 2308990_2309920
five amperes ? 2309920_2310990
oh . 2310990_2311900
this means it is one point five volts . 2311900_2313070
why did you mix up a voltmeter and a ammeter again ? 2313070_2318950
we did it so many times .
oh well .
because the color is blue and green . 2318950_2320000
then multiply this current and this voltage . 2320000_2323900
yes . 2325980_2327110
nine . 2329060_2330080
nine, right ? 2332070_2335010
this time do it well, okay ? 2336940_2339990
don't worry, since that group made mistakes, your group's two degrees increase is just about right . 2339990_2344050
sometimes people make mistakes . 2347010_2349080
but I think this is unusual . 2349080_2359970
then while you are waiting for five minutes, put dots for the previous data in the graph on an ohp sheet . 2359970_2371030
should I tell you how to use this ? 2371030_2376890
in the beginning it was one point eight, right ? 2376890_2386110
one point eight, this is two .
when it is one point eight, the temperature increase was two .
so, here ?
next, if it generated two hundred calories, when it is one point eight, it is two hundred, so it goes here, right ? 2386110_2394150
you just put a dot here with a small circle .
the next one is the same way . 2394150_2397890
just put a dot .
okay ?
just dots ? 2397890_2398080
yes, just putting dots is fine . 2398080_2400140
then watch it carefully so that you won't make a mistake next time . 2400140_2404000
the next data is with nine, right ?
since you will have only one dot, this is voltage multiplied by current, you will see how many degrees it increased after five minutes . 2404000_2412080
at that time, draw a point here . 2412080_2422160
when you calculate heat energy, in the same way, nine, here, right ?
what is the amount of heat generated when it is nine ?
put a dot .
how do we calculate heat energy ? 2422160_2423940
the amount of heat energy is mass of water multiplied by temperature increase . 2423940_2426120
teacher, when I calculated it with the previous data, it became three thousand . 2426120_2429090
three thousand . 2429090_2430170
is the mass of water one hundred ? 2430170_2431970
yes, today it was one hundred grams . 2431970_2434170
but your group applied a fairly high voltage because in order to ten ? 2436900_2446950
three, three amperes .
teacher . 2446950_2447950
yes . 2447950_2449040
oh, this one, right ? 2449040_2455970
it became one point five, right ?
this one goes two, four, six; so one point five is around here, right ?
and then the number of increased temperature is two, right ? 2455970_2462050
around here .
so put a dot around here .
next is the same way . 2462050_2466910
when it is one point five volt+ampere, it is two hundred calories, right ?
since this side is for heat energy, so when it is one point five, circle at two hundred calories . 2466910_2477890
okay ?
how is it ? 2477890_2488150
you have only one datum .
then, first multiply current and voltage, first .
eight times one point three .
how much is it, hirai+kun . 2488150_2490100
ten point four . 2490100_2491880
ten point four . 2491880_2493010
he said ten point four .
ten point four . 2493010_2496110
then, you draw the number of the temperature increase after five minutes, right ? 2496110_2503020
the mass of the water is one hundred, right ? 2506970_2514010
and multiply the number of the temperature increase and get the amount of heat .
okay ?
and when you write it in here, it is ten point four . 2514010_2521120
this is ten and twelve, right ?
find where ten point four is .
and put the dot in here at the temperature increase . 2521120_2525150
imai+kun has suspicious eyes . 2525150_2527130
in the same way, put a dot to indicate the amount of heat energy when it is ten point five . 2527130_2541140
did you understand ?
there is only one datum, so do it precisely .
were you explained how to draw the graph ? 2541140_2546030
okay ?
this is big . 2546030_2548150
that's fine . 2548150_2551970
big is fine .
twenty more seconds . 2551970_2554150
get ready to read the thermometer . 2554150_2556890
this is sixteen . 2559920_2560950
did you put dots ? 2560950_2564990
where ? 2564990_2567030
oh, I cannot see it .
draw it clearly .
teacher . 2567030_2567120
yes . 2567120_2569980
this one ? 2569980_2574890
you got six point five, right ?
it's six point five, so is it about here ?
then read the next temperature . 2576880_2577010
it's over . 2577010_2580060
it increased four degrees, right ? 2580060_2587000
so it's four, yes, yes .
we are done . 2587000_2589070
how many degrees have increased ? 2589070_2590900
you know, right ? 2590900_2591900
that's why it's one point six . 2591900_2593070
it's fourteen, I heard . 2593070_2596950
fourteen . 2596950_2600140
thirteen .
did it increase eleven degrees ? 2600140_2603140
this one is the number of increase, so you have to write four for this . 2603140_2605950
oh, I see . 2605950_2610150
yes, yes . 2610150_2614960
and this .
you draw a circle, but this is for calorie .
oh, calorie . 2614960_2623060
then, when you draw on the sheet, bring it to me . 2623060_2629080
it's ten point five . 2629080_2632020
is it around here ?
make sure to turn off the power source . 2632020_2639910
when you are done with the sheet, bring it to me . 2639910_2643980
draw it with this pen . 2643980_2646980
where ? 2646980_2649080
here ?
draw it bigger . 2649080_2660010
then next . 2660010_2663010
next is ?
the size is different . 2663010_2666120
when you finished the sheet, bring it to me . 2666120_2669940
should I make it thicker ? 2669940_2682020
like fat people .
it is clearer in this way .
these are so reserved .
then I will take this .
thank you .
when you are done, please bring it to me . 2682020_2693000
are you done ? 2693000_2696090
oh this was yours .
bring the sheet quickly please . 2696090_2701050
the group who turned in the sheet, please look at the ohp . 2701050_2712940
is this okay just like this ? 2712940_2713900
that's fine . 2713900_2733130
we will stick them .
did everyone turn it in ? 2733130_2735050
six point five and four hundred degrees . 2735050_2741960
the group who turned it in, please watch this . 2741960_2744880
around here . 2744880_2746050
thank you for bringing it to me . 2746050_2747890
then . 2747890_2753960
eleven point two and eight degrees .
eleven point two is eight degrees .
eleven point two . 2753960_2755900
then eight degrees . 2755900_2758910
one more group ? 2758910_2767040
kaji+kun, please take it . 2767040_2773060
thank you . 2773060_2781040
then, let's take a look . 2781040_2786130
I stuck all of them together . 2786130_2797910
then the result of your measurement became like this .
so should I draw a line ?
may I borrow your ruler ? 2797910_2802930
thanks . 2802930_2804080
this . 2804080_2815880
when the voltage and the current are both zero, there is neither temperature nor heat energy .
here .
origin, okay ?
then I will draw a line so that it is close to all the dots . 2815880_2828070
oh ! 2828070_2830030
amazing !
they are exactly on the line !
yes, some are exactly on the line . 2830030_2831120
see ? 2831120_2832960
what can we say from this ? 2836020_2838950
this is amazing . 2838950_2843920
voltage times current equals . 2843920_2860940
what kind of relationship is there in relation to temperature increase and heat energy ?
proportion . 2860940_2861950
proportion . 2861950_2862170
proportion . 2862170_2866890
what is it ? 2866890_2868070
one more time ?
proportion . 2868070_2869020
it has a proportional relationship, right ? 2869020_2876170
okay ? 2876170_2878930
we found that heat energy is proportional to the product of voltage and current . 2878930_2885020
then using this result, please try to solve this question . 2885020_2890990
okay ? 2890990_2898100
heat energy is proportional to the product of voltage and current .
then, this question . 2898100_2903050
this one is a parallel circuit combining a big resistance and a small resistance . 2903050_2918880
this one is a series circuit combining a big resistance and a small resistance .
then in this parallel circuit, which one produces more heat ? 2918880_2930050
this one or this one ?
in a series circuit, which one produces more heat ?
this one or this one ?
think hard . 2930050_2938160
heat energy is proportional to the product of voltage and current .
I will ask each group, so make a prediction for this first . 2938160_2958040
first with the parallel circuit . 2958040_2961010
what should we do ? 2961010_2962920
I don't know either . 2962920_2964000
you have to listen carefully . 2964000_2966170
yes . 2967900_2968960
yes . 2970110_2971900
which one produces more heat ? 2971900_2972140
yes . 2972140_2973970
then, I will call your name next, yamase+kun . 2973970_2976920
the small one, isn't it ? 2976920_2986060
then stop . 2986060_2990130
class will be over soon, so I will ask you now .
this one . 2990130_2993070
is there any group who has thought about this ?
which one is larger ?
yes . 2993070_2994150
then, yoshikawa+kun's group . 2994150_2998170
you answered . 2998170_3002920
yoshikawa+kun .
which one produces more heat ? 3002920_3005000
the one which has smaller resistance . 3005000_3006970
yes, yes . 3006970_3008060
same answer .
then matsui+kun . 3009110_3010140
one with the smaller resistance . 3010140_3011910
one with the smaller resistance . 3011910_3016020
how about the other group ?
then yoshikawa+kun, why does this one produce more heat ? 3016020_3023880
huh ? 3023880_3037170
then matsui+kun .
why does this one produce more heat ?
huh ?
oh, this gesture indicates that the girls thought this out .
then i'll ask the girls .
then kimo+san .
because the smaller the resistance is, the more current flows . 3037170_3040980
the more current flows, right ? 3040980_3044070
okay ? 3044070_3058130
in a parallel circuit, voltage is .
the same everywhere .
if that is the case, the more current flows, the greater the heat that is generated, right ?
so this one produces more heat . 3058130_3073030
then how about the series circuit ?
we don't have time, so I will ask you .
who thinks this one produces more heat ?
then who thinks this one produces more heat ? 3073030_3077900
some people are undecided . 3077900_3083880
then I will ask you in the next class, but I will give you a hint .
in a parallel circuit, the voltage was the same, but what was the same in a series circuit ? 3083880_3093120
current . 3093120_3094150
yes . 3094150_3100880
the current is the same .
think about this question, this hint in your mind .
what does this mean ? 3100880_3105890
then we will finish .
matsui+kun .
stand up . 3105890_3113970
then clean up after we greet . 3113970_3121040
straight . 3121040_3125140
yoshi+kun, you have to clean up, too . 3125140_3129020
bow . 3129020_3130100
thank you very much . 3130100_3131010
thank you very much . 3131010_3147010
yamase+kun, yamase+kun, come here . 3147010_3158020
oh, wait a minute . 3158020_3158029
stay seated for a little bit .
there will be a survey, so please sit
