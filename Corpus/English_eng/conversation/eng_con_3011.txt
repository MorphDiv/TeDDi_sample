thank you very much . 0_6748
okay, let's do it . 6748_9811
I'm waiting for xxx . 9811_11555
okay, well we can you can put down the answers and see how . 11555_14898
gosh dohdidadoohah . 14898_22075
kay guys, so, let's start with function one . 22075_26648
Function uno . 26648_29706
For the, um, how many'd be in step ten what'd you get ? 29706_34666
I got nineteen . 34666_36155
&=frown I got twenty two . 36155_36578
let's see: . 36578_38923
&=look:D I got twenty one . 38923_41770
Nineteen, twenty, one, twenty two shoot . 41770_44766
what are you guys talking about ? 44766_46225
function one . 46225_47503
oh that ? 47503_48513
I got twenty one on that . 48513_49943
okay, it's one two and we add two more . 49943_52206
then you have two more . 52206_53903
you keep adding two each time . 53903_55870
so then one two we have one two . 55870_58793
&=looks:D's_paper . 58793_59266
ten eleven . 59266_60418
one two . 60418_62770
&=looks:G . 62770_64961
twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen . 64961_66018
wait, what ? 66018_68808
no . 68808_69346
three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven, and then, that'd
six it would be: thirteen, seven it would be: fifteen . 74123_79320
&=looks:D . 79320_79516
you know if you kept your last night homework 79516_81430
&=looking:at_J . 82605_83133
Eight would be seventeen . 83133_87718
Nine would be nineteen . 87718_89686
Yeah, and ten'll be twenty one . 89686_91911
&=nodding . 91911_92101
&=Bends_back_down_over_her_homework . 92101_92278
&=looks_down_at_her_homework 92278_92543
Yeah . 92990_93448
I must have been off by one . 93448_95606
Yeah, I think I counted it . 95606_96615
I I did three plus n minus one, times two . 96615_99706
&=looking:homework well, if you would have just 99706_102481
Wait, multiply the step number by then add one . 103446_106708
and the next one, eleven plus eleven . 106708_107851
&=looking:homework &=writing . 107851_109341
&=looking:homework that wouldn't work though, because you start 109341_111065
And then you go one two, one two, one two . 111663_113985
Wait . 113985_114263
Take the step number, multiply by two, and add one . 114263_116853
&=look:G &=pointing it worked with xxx xxx 116853_117090
&=looking:homework . 117350_117586
&=writing . 117586_118003
take the what ? 118003_118666
Step number . 118666_119555
Multiply it by two and add one . 119555_121145
multiply . 121145_122506
&=leans_across_the_desk_and_points_to_Gs_homework . 122506_123325
So three times two is six .
one, two, three, four, five, six 123325_125973
Seven . 126518_126983
And it works for each one . 126983_128238
&=looking_down_at_her_homework . 128238_128516
&=looks:G . 128516_128951
It does ? 128951_129436
Yeah . 129436_129916
&=looks:G . 129916_130389
&=writing so it would be step number ten, times . 130389_134750
Two is twenty . 134750_135988
twenty . 135988_136950
&=looks:G . 136950_137708
And then plus one is twenty one . 137708_138453
Oh, ok . 138453_140050
You can tell it's right by do number five, times two is one two 140050_142361
n times two, plus one . 142848_144233
I didn't see that coming . 144233_146008
&=bends_back_over_her_homework . 146008_146875
Oh waiwait . 146875_147265
Yeah . 147265_148361
Oh, I'm stupid ! 148361_149423
Function one . 149423_149936
I had that right here ! 149936_150568
So the answer's Twenty one ? 150568_153273
Yeah, twenty one . 153273_154233
Were we supposed to put functions ? 154233_156058
&=bends_back_over_her_homework . 156058_157273
For where ?
For this one ?
For the graph ? 158736_159530
&=Looks:D . 159530_159786
Yeah . 159786_160146
okay, for the graph, all you do is like 160146_161730
&=Looking_down_at_her_homework . 163358_163580
Yeah, yeah, yeah . 163580_163973
I know I know I know . 163973_164486
And then you just write what the thing is +... 164486_166088
&=looking_back_down_at_her_homework . 166088_166613
I got twenty one, and then what was seventeen . 166613_168220
Thirty four ? 168220_168973
Thirty five, right ? 168973_170666
&=looking_at_her_homework_and_pointing_to_it_as_she_talks . 170666_171011
Yeah, (be)cause n times two plus one . 171011_172513
Yeah, thirty five . 172513_174296
&=Looks:D . 174296_174575
&=sits_up &=stops_writing . 174575_175246
&=looks_up_quickly_then_looks_back_down . 175246_175990
Two n, plus one . 175990_176575
Ok, now function two ? 176575_179935
I got forty one . 179935_181478
Same here . 181478_182975
It goes up by four each time ? 182975_184706
And my function was five plus plus n minus one, times four .
&=starts_writing_on_her_homework_again . 193766_194025
Wait . 194025_194800
I got four n plus one . 194800_196945
&=looks:D four n@l plus one ? 196945_199155
Yeah . 199155_199563
(be)cause of ten, you do ten times four . 199563_202173
It's the same thing, isn't it ? 202173_202996
Wait . 202996_203803
What'd you say again ? 203803_204316
Four, um I did n@l minus one times four +... 204316_207946
Yeah . 207946_208258
same thing . 208258_208668
plus five . 208668_209226
Plus five ? 209226_210433
Five from the beginning . 210433_213693
Because there's five in the beginning and then it goes up by four .
Yeah, I guess that should work . 216973_218613
Just like, I guess mine's sort of like more simplified or 218613_222596
Uhhhh function three . 223030_227746
I got thirty two for ten . 227746_230635
yeah . 230635_231923
I got thirty six . 231923_232731
I did the pattern is the step number, multiply it by three, plus 232731_239923
Multiply three, then add two . 240346_241971
Because you have five, go one, two, three, four +... 241971_246066
Wait, times three . 246066_246986
Wait, it goes five ? 246986_247586
And then you get one, two, three ? 247586_248593
And then five, 248593_249403
So, I thought it was five 251875_252816
&=glancing_at_G's_paper &=writing . 255506_256410
Well, ok . 256410_257498
Can I see something her first ? 257498_258736
Here's one multiply it by three one, two, three . 258736_262033
and then add two and that's five . 262033_263946
And then two times three is one, 263946_265983
And then three is times three one, two, three, four, five, six
So, like that works for each one each time, if you notice . 274391_278793
Yeah, this the other thing works too, cuz five plus, see cuz 278793_283571
uhhuh . 288203_288746
And you still have the five . 288746_289563
Uhhuh . 289563_290073
&=looking_back_down_at_her_homework 290073_290376
And that works . 297866_298913
You get eight ? 298838_299896
yeah, ok, yours 299896_302480
So it works . 303278_303776
I must have done bad calculations on ten, though . 303776_307073
I did five plus so it's ten minus . 307073_311413
one is nine . 311413_312255
nine times three is +... 312255_314655
Twenty seven . 314655_315568
plus five is +... 315568_317135
Thirty two . 317135_317735
It is ? 317735_319096
Yeah . 319096_319440
That's where I went wrong then . 319440_320781
I got thirty six instead of +... 320781_322276
&=glancing_up_at_G's_paper . 322276_322621
So, is it thirty two ? 322621_323030
Yeah . 323030_323718
These took me forever . 323718_326360
But then also like you know how it 326360_328806
Leila she said like do you only do Homework One 329103_333173
Wait . 337350_339380
Are we were we supposed to do the 339380_341046
Yeah . 342045_342453
You did them, right ? 342453_343780
Yeah I just did it wrong . 343780_345740
