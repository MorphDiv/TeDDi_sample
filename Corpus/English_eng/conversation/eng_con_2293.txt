drama and like voice majors will sing anywhere they are cuz . 5201_9538
that's like them getting their practice in . 9538_10774
which I think is kind of bothersome . 10774_13086
I don't think that makes them that great though necessarily . 13086_16325
I think a lot of them learn theory . 16325_18554
but I think there's still a lot of variation in their skills . 18554_20516
I'm not saying, like I'm not . 20516_22912
it's not just me though, but when I'm singing . 22912_24686
where I'm just kind of mumbling . 24686_26931
Oh, I see, I see . 26931_27908
That's just kind of weird . 27908_30342
You walk by a person like that . 30342_31995
You have no idea, hahaha . 31995_34307
I see . 34307_34967
Because the earphones are up . 34967_36082
Is a dead giveaway though, I'm talking about people without

I think it's like in . 42379_45083
Okay .
Broadways . 47378_48234

Haha, except life's not a musical . 52735_56502

I have never seen it on broadway . 93669_95163
Which is kind of sad . 95163_96533

Two guards . 131331_132064

This is Yoonie not getting enough caffein . 138451_140630

But anyway, so . 144459_147463

it's a play . 149838_150176
A play, or whatever . 150176_151343

right . 153136_155172
It's um . 155172_156904
Isn't it british dry humor though ? 156904_159126
um, a bit . 159126_162365
there's a lot of logic and rhetoric . 162365_165154
oh, ok . 165154_166726
It's like play on words . 166726_168283
Yeah, and . 168283_169745
the logical fallacies . 169745_172255

hamlet and these two guards . 179012_180647
are sent off to do something . 180647_182295
and then . 182295_183729
sent off to watch over hamlet because . 183729_186655
You know, hamlet's father was . 186655_188497

hamlet to his death . 199971_201278

Hamlet finds the letter . 232235_232997
and changes it around . 234755_235485
so it says “hi, would you kill these two guards” . 235485_239706

well, when they . 254155_256462
when their scene comes on . 256462_261782
they're just sitting around . 261782_262579
and . 262579_263759

um the something of being earnest . 290684_300151
the importance . 300151_302002
the importance of being earnest, thank you . 302002_303684
that was funny, because . 303684_304944
it was play on words . 304944_305723
it's pretty funny . 305723_308027
I read that play for . 308027_309474
english class in high school . 309474_312015

Umm . 317592_318524
I can appreciate it . 318524_320769
I don't know if I'd necessarily go . 320769_321966
out and seek it . 321966_323243
but I can appreciate it . 323243_325484
have you ever seen a movie . 325484_327244
called his girl friday . 327244_328351
No . 328351_331027
It's black and white . 331027_332196
it's . 332196_333571
back when they . 333596_334438
started the style of . 334438_335512
um conversations . 335512_338408
that were very very fast . 338408_340899
and there's bantering between . 340899_342318
the two main characters . 342318_344235
and everybody else in it . 344235_346442
it's a really good movie . 346442_347704
it's actually on the top . 347704_350287
movies on IMDB . 350287_353510
okay . 353510_356407
I dunno, I don't . 356407_357323

His Girl Friday ? 360859_363534
They made . 363534_364347
a remake . 364347_365122
Don't watch the remake . 365122_365730
okay . 365730_368080
I think the remake actually has . 368105_369840
Christopher Reeves . 369840_370930
hmm . 370930_373606
yeah . 373606_377998
So, this is a horrible question . 377998_379305
for me to be asking . 379305_380754
it reflects how much of current affairs . 380754_381767
I don't know . 381767_382857
but is christopher reeves still alive ? 382857_385986
No . 385986_386809
Ok, that's what I thought . 386809_392944
He was in bed . 392944_394439
um, and . 394439_396027
developed something else . 396027_398955
and wasn't able to . 398955_401166
I forget . 401166_406695
But I don't really consider that . 406695_407801
current events . 407801_411522
I mean . 411522_412378
it's not . 412378_417095
it's not world affairs . 417095_418810
haha, that's true . 418810_420224
well . 420224_421033
I guess so . 421033_422062
um . 422062_422574
it's funny though, when I think of superman . 422574_424816
I don't think of christopher reeves . 424816_425519
anymore, oh are you okay, oh my god, don't choke . 425519_428801
but I think of Dean Cain . 428801_429766
xxx . 429766_430266
oh god . 430266_431495
as the new superman . 431495_432880

Yeah, I used to . 434359_437491
Do you watch, Do you watch smallville . 435356_437429
No . 437429_438194
No, oh, okay, I don't watch it either . 438194_440107
I watch a little bit, I mean if it's on . 440107_441164
I'll watch it . 441164_442008
for fun, but it's . 442008_443208
ehhh, whatever, I . 443208_444860
I'm always like . 444860_445806
you watch everything . 445806_446540
xxx . 446540_447315
yeah I do . 447315_448110
It's funny . 448110_449170
cuz I really don't watch tv . 449170_449936
but then again . 449936_450711
I pretty much know . 450711_452424
everything . 452424_453875
you don't watch things religiously, but if it's on . 453875_454778
xxx . 454778_456225
and if I have nothing to do . 456225_457770
I may watch it . 457770_458501
if I find it entertaining, if I have nothing better to do . 458501_459842
xxx . 459842_460727
I may . 460727_461880
xxx . 461880_462876
There's always something better to do . 462876_464371
Cook ! 464371_466037
xxx . 466037_466677
okay, I guess I could do that . 466677_467878
xxx . 467878_469072
some day we'll go to the strip district . 469072_469851
and get . 469851_470633
Not here . 470633_471595
I do more of that when I'm home . 471595_473092
oh at home, oh, okay . 473092_474211
Home, where my friends are at college . 474211_476158
or working . 476158_476624
when I'm home for break, usually . 476624_478772
our breaks don't match up too . 478772_480297
and then like . 480297_480875
you know . 480875_481685
whenever I'm at home, if, it's hard for me to explain . 481685_485855
I guess being an only child kind of goes . 485855_487103
into it . 487103_487693
I'm just like, I don't like . 487693_489034
being around people . 489034_489904
too much, like I can . 489904_490651
do it, I like . 490651_491553
it I like it . 491553_492551
but not always . 492551_494123
every . 494123_494764
time . 494764_495510
thing . 495510_496398
so like I like . 496398_497190
maybe I should just rephrase . 497190_498343
to be like, actually . 498343_499294
I just like it when . 499294_500400
I can just sit there and . 500400_501659
have nothing to worry about, nothing pressing to do . 501659_503137
xxx . 503137_504153
and I don't want to do anything else . 504153_505692
but watch tv . 505692_506595
and then, I will enjoy . 506595_508061
my . 508061_508277
episode of smallville . 508277_510220
or you know . 510220_511296
superman, or whatever . 511296_512668
xxx . 512668_513505
that's an interesting revelation . 513505_514937
for a ca . 514937_516603
that you don't like to be around people . 516603_518363
I don't mean it that I don't like to be around . 518363_520670
people, cuz I am . 520670_521476
a people person, you know how I am around people . 521476_523863
I'm totally outgoing . 523863_524733
but every so often, I like . 524733_526834
to be a couch potato . 526834_528516
and just be . 528516_530025
worthless . 530025_531380
for about an hour . 531380_532361
that's what I like to do, exactly . 532361_532983
so, you know . 532983_535365
like last night there's absolutely nothing . 535365_536334
