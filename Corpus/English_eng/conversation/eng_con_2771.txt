<mister> Justice , during these peaceful years that you
what are your memories of the Korean War and about the school
well , it's a long time ago , of course now .
the Korean War bothered us because a lot of young people from the
I've mentioned Sandy Keith's service over there and his return .
these were disheartening days .
it just seemed that the world was full of misery and fighting and
do you remember the Steel Seizure case in <nineteen fifty-two>
yes , I do , indeed , and the tumult that resulted from it .
it was an audacious move on the part of the president .
well , it was interesting because Chief Justice Rehnquist , who at
do you remember thinking at the time that that was presidential
did you have a strong feeling about the case ?
I didn't have a strong feeling about the case .
there was feeling , of course , in the community pro and con as to
I think my own feeling was one of sympathy for Mister
he was a practical guy , not always popular , but I think probably
how about the school desegregation battle and Thurgood Marshall .
do you remember much about that ?
not a great deal .
I suppose in part because it wasn't a problem in Rochester .
we had very few African-Americans living there .
when it came along , all of a sudden the community was aware that
there was no African-American on the clinic staff .
then of course , there was always the problem of what if one was an

I think in a way he was happier then than in the years following
I think he liked the fray , liked the battle .
but that's just my opinion .
did you hit it off with him quickly or did it take a while for the
well , I never did know about his attitude toward me .
he was always kind and nearly always we sat next to each other in
we joked a lot .
I heard a lot of Thurgood Marshall jokes that nobody else heard ,
I had a lot of respect for him .
at the beginning of your time on the Court , you and he often voted
do you remember a feeling of closeness or a time when there was a
no , not particularly , not particularly .
maybe I changed more than he did .
although I'd deny that too .
during the period that you were in Rochester , did you see your
not as much as I should have , of course .
she was living in the suburbs of <Saint> Paul actually ,
I spoke to her every week by telephone , on Mondays .
of course , I had a sister living at that time , who was in the
I would try to get up , make a special trip to the cities to visit
was she happy with your decision to live in Rochester ?
well , I think she was disappointed we were that far away ,
how much did you see Judge Sanborn during these years ?
not a great deal , but I always kept in touch with him mainly
and I liked to be aware of what was going on with him and the
his wife died , and I knew he was lonely .
so there were times , not as frequently as I went up to see my
we'd always go to the Minnesota Club there , and I think be was
one thing people want to know is how exactly did you develop your
you work very long hours , you're extremely meticulous , you take
where did that come from do you think ?
did your mother or Judge Sanborn play a role in developing that in
well , they were both hard workers , no question about that .
I could easily say , especially on the court , I worked long hours
but I think it all goes back , maybe and I haven't really
hours were precious , time was precious .
when I was driving the coaching launch , which was my best job ,
so to keep going I worked late , always until midnight .
now I couldn't do it , I get too sleepy , but in those days I
I suppose that's where it developed .
and your sense of self-discipline and healthiness , did that come
exercising and keeping to the same schedule .
well , maybe a little bit but it was accompanied by the fact that I
and during the weekends , Dottie and I would try to get in some
but I think that exercise kept me going .
I don't believe I'd be here if I hadn't indulged in it one way or
when did it first enter your conscience that you might become a
people , especially young law students , often ask , how do you get
I don't think there's any set formula for that .
because every federal judge I've known , when I've discussed his
chief Judge Arnold of the Eighth Circuit flatly says he got to be a
well , maybe so .
I suppose one has to be at the right place at the right time .
eventually there comes a point where one has to let it be known
if they get to like you , why , then when the time comes you're a
as far as I was concerned I never thought there was any possibility
do you think there is any one person who is the moving force ?
I think John Sanborn was .
now I'm speaking of my appointment to the Court of Appeals , when I
he called me up to <Saint> Paul one day and , as I recall ,
there was something pending that I wanted to work on that night ,
well , this sort of startled me deeply because I never associated
and we talked a little bit about it , about his own feeling as
he should have been down here and not <I> +/.
do you know if he was ever seriously considered for a Supreme Court
+, I think his name crept up here and there , yes , in the earlier
but the next thing I knew after that dinner conversation was that
I hear this from him and his secretary that he went in to see the
I suppose he saw a couple of others .
Arthur Vandenburg ?
no , his name eludes me , I know it just as well as anything .
but I think he was just very blunt about it and said here , I'm
I'd never heard of such a thing , but he had enough stature that
of course , I wasn't the only name that was pitched around , there
there was a <Saint> Paul lawyer and others out in the field
I'm sure had I been with the Dorsey office I wouldn't have made it
was that unusual for someone to go directly to the Eighth Circuit
no , not any more unusual than it is now .
there are a lot of circuit judges around that haven't had district
I think maybe one is a better appellate judge if he's had some
it didn't bother me too much .
I liked the scholarship of the law and went into it accordingly .
were there any other people who played a role in firming up your
at that time I don't think of many , no .
there were a lot of them later in <nineteen seventy> who
+" I was responsible for your nomination .
there must have been twenty who were responsible .
and when did it become final ?
was there a long period of indecision before you found out that you
no .
the time element eludes me a little bit , but it certainly wasn't
the nomination came along and then there were instructions about
can you tell us about that hearing ?
the hearing came up right at the time of the anticipated visit by
that was the time when he took his shoe off and banged it on the
the Senate indicated a desire to adjourn and not be in session when
so my hearing was held on the last day , as I recall .
there were two or three of us who were up for the confirmation
a senator from North Dakota , Senator Langer , was chairman of the
I've forgotten who the third one was .
Tom Dodd of Connecticut ?
yes .
I had been told by someone who said that if Senator Langer was
+" <mister> so and so , state the rule in Shelley's case .
well , I thought this was a strange observation but , I was naive
that was the only question ?
from him .
he said , +"/.
+" I have no more questions , Senator Dodd , do you have some
so it went down that way .
they whipped us through fairly fast and the one following me was
he was up for nomination to the District Court at that time but ran
there was opposition , and they didn't confirm him , that panel
what role did Hubert Humphrey and Eugene McCarthy play in this ?
at what point did they come into the picture ?
they , of course , appeared before the panel .
it must have been very difficult for them because they really
here I was being appointed by Eisenhower and they were both
Hubert , in his typical way , got up and gave a laudatory , fairly
I owed him a lot , he was very , very nice .
I think it goes back to the time that , when Hubert first ran for
not so much maybe that I was so pro-Humphrey as I was anti his
but he was aware of it ; he never forgot it .
and of course , Senator McCarthy came along .
it must have been a very difficult period for Senator McCarthy to
Hubert was so much out in the open , so vocal and talkative and the
I remember walking down , I think after that hearing , with Senator
+" you know , sometimes Hubert forgets that I'm a United States
but they were both very nice .
Eugene McCarthy was as I say , it was hard , I'm sure , for
it was only nine years later that Hubert Humphrey ran for president
do you remember how you felt during that period about seeing the
I don't remember how I felt .
I don't mean to dodge your question .
I really don't .
how did your family feel about your becoming a judge ?
I don't know , really .
I was rather pleased .
I thought maybe that I could do it successfully and I , of course ,
it meant again a reduction in salary .
Dottie said , +"/.
+" you used to tell me that your father always preached to you
+" and now you've made two changes , once out of Dorsey's to Mayos
+" I think you better stop changing around because the girls are
their education was ahead of us .
but again she accepted it , and we went along .
was there any pressure for you to move back to Minneapolis ?
I was concerned about it because we liked Rochester and the girls
but to my amazement when a representative , I suppose it was
I thought those were wasted words on him and he said maybe we can
at that time Olmsted County , which was where Rochester-was , had
lo and behold he worked out a deal between the federal government
I think I was the only federal judge that was housed in a state
eventually I had to move out of there , and they worked out another
but that enabled us to stay in Rochester and bring our family up
did you feel all that wistful about leaving Mayos or did you have a
yes , Mayas , I have such a high regard for them .
that's what I went to Rochester for and now I was deserting them .
but I felt it was the right thing to do , and we did it .
what do you remember about the Eighth Circuit when you went on ?
who were some of the personalities and how did you feel about them
let me just go down the list , Harvey Johnsen I guess was the chief
was he a contemporary of Judge Sanborn's I guess ?
he was and the two of them were very good friends .
Harvey Johnsen was out of Nebraska and a Democrat .
a steel-trap mind .
john Sanborn said +"/.
+" harry , you're going to like Judge Johnsen , you will just love
actually I was deeply disappointed because I found Judge Johnsen
example : My first session in <Saint> Louis he said , +"/.
+" judge , I'd like to have breakfast with you tomorrow morning .
+" I'll meet you down here in the dining room everybody stayed
I got down at three minutes after seven .
he was sitting in a table by a window and I walked in and he said ,
+" you're late .
+" no smile on his face .
you're late .
+" well , from then on we were at cross-purposes for a while .
+" but we got along very well .
+" but Harvey Johnsen , I don't think he had any humor in him at
+" why the closeness between Sanborn and Johnsen developed I'll
+" but he was there , I suppose the next one who +/.
<a_k> Gardner .
+, <a_k> Gardner was out of Huron , out of South Dakota ,
in fact he prevented , because he stayed on , he prevented John
but <A_K> stayed on , he liked it and he was a good judge
except as he got older he got a little blind , as one does , and at
I noticed all of his friends at that point didn't go pheasant
of course that's the ritual out there in Dakota and a good part of
come October everybody goes pheasant hunting and duck season comes
Joseph Woodrough ?
one more thing , if I may , about Gardner , maybe I shouldn't say
burger thereupon decided that age ninety was much too old to sit as
he steps down and he doesn't get appointed , I think , after age
that was all due to <A_K> Gardner .
is this when Chief Justice Burger was at the Civil Division of the
yes .
whom did you name , Joe Woodrough ?
Joe Woodrough , of Omaha .
of course , from here on in , these are all Democratic appointments
Joe was a wizened little fellow , a Texan with a Texan drawl , but
I always kind of liked him , because he wasn't an outstanding judge
he did two things that worried the rest of us .
he wore white socks all the time and insisted on everybody else
he said it should be a symbol of the Eighth Circuit .
well , we resisted that .
but the other thing that did concern us was , he'd get up at four
and he always went across the Edes Bridge , over the Mississippi
east <Saint> Louis was a tough town ; it was then , it
how old was he then ?
he must have been in his sixties .
he was not young .
we thought that if anybody over there in that crowd discovered he
but he laughed at the rest of us , and then he walked back and
we worried about him because he was just a little fellow , he could
who came next , Van ?
Charles Vogel .
Charlie Vogel of course came out of Fargo , very lovable guy .
got to be a good friend of mine .
I liked Charlie .
he and I hit it off I suppose because we both came from the north
Charlie Was somewhat active in Democratic politics in North Dakota
of course you don't have to be too active because you'd be known
nearly all the people are in the east end along the Red River and
but he was a good lawyer and head of a fine firm .
martin Van Oosterhout .
martin Van Oosterhout was the “big judge” , we called him , he was
good judicial reaction .
he was not a particularly good writer in the sense of a smooth
I grew very fond of him .
he was a good friend to all the rest of us .
when the load of bricks landed on me in <nineteen seventy>
the word came in ; it was passed in to me on a little a piece of
I had all I could do to get out of there .
judge Van said , +"/.
+" harry , I think you ought to go home .
he said , +"/.
+" I'll take over , I'll get Roy Harper downstairs to sit in your
but this was his normal reaction of tender regard for his fellows
you didn't see any jealousy on the part of the other judges .
+, I never felt it .
there might have been but they didn't let me feel it .
judge Matthes , Marion Matthes .
Marion <C> Matthes was from <Saint> Louis .
he really came from the boothill country of Missouri , where the
a fine judge , a nice person .
I liked Judge Matthes .
had a little bit of an unhappy life , particularly the last years ,
he was immediately senior to me as I remember .
now , of these judges , how many of there had been judges when you
gardner must have been .
I don't think any of the others were .
did you find it intimidating to be the “new kid on the block” with
sure , sure .
but John Sanborn helped me get over that hump .
as I remember , the chief judge of the Eighth Circuit was Kimbrough
he was the son of a Missouri senator .
good judge , I think , good average judge .
he must have viewed me with suspicion a little bit , but we got
were there any rivalries or internal court tensions or was it a
on the Eighth Circuit ?
on the Eighth Circuit .
I never felt any rivalries , well with one exception which I won't
and one reason was that we all lived in the field .
we didn't all live in <Saint> Louis .
I thought that when I was first appointed I might have to move down
the Seventh Circuit , nearly everybody lives in Chicago and the
but , we lived in the field , and I think one result of that was
we did everything by correspondence or by telephone .
it generally , I think , was a happy court .
did you take your meals together ?
yes .
always had lunch together .
that was a time we usually sat in two or three panels and so
we always were in a little bit of concern one panel might
as I say , we all stayed at the Mayfair Hotel , which was a nice
it was run by a woman named Julia King , whom we all admired and
we didn't have breakfast together except if somebody went down ,
I think it was at eight o'clock we would assemble in the lobby ,
we'd go out the door together .
turn left for a half block , left , then right , finally get down
and they always lined up in order of seniority .
I noticed this , I was keeping my eyes open as to how to act .
the chief judge was up there and the senior was next to him and
I'll never forget one of those early days we were going down the
everybody stopped .
I knew we had to cross the street to the right , and I made the
+" why don't we go on the green light across the street ?
everybody turned around and glared at me , as though one never
we go down on this side of the street and keep your mouth shut .
don't give us these foolish ideas .
I learned a lot that very first march .
everything was done the way it always had been done .
judge Sanborn continued to sit , I guess , for some time after he
yes , he did indeed .
as a matter of fact , my first sitting was with him .
now whether he was responsible for that , had asked Harvey Johnsen
but anyway , I had the privilege of sitting with him .
Harvey Johnsen did me the courtesy also , of that first session ,
your first set of opinions , were they without dissent ?
do you remember ?
yes , I think so .
I well remember the first dissent that came along .
I was hurt that anybody would dissent .
do you remember what kind of case it was ?
no , I don't .
I could find it easily enough .
how often would they go to an en banc ?
very seldom , really .
the Eighth Circuit didn't indulge in en banc cases .
we had a few all right .
pope against the United States was en banc .
I've forgotten , maybe the Tinker case , yes , I'm sure the Tinker
tinker <v@l> Des Moines ?
yes .
where school children were wearing black armbands in protest of the
that went en banc .
but by and large , the senior judge didn't like them very well .
they took a lot of time , of course , and you had to bring
was there a lot of informal consultation about cases , over meals ?
over meals , yes , yes indeed .
especially at noon .
we nearly always ate at one of the hotels in <Saint> Louis
as I say , our panel would discuss our cases with the other panels
you ended up writing two hundred and seventeen opinions on the
that's a hard one .
probably the death penalty cases Feguer and Maxwell against Bishop
some of those along the line there .
in one of them whew I expressed my antipathy for the death penalty
feguer , as I recall , was the last federal execution for a long
now this ease involved someone who killed a surgeon .
do you remember that hitting home , because of where you had just
no , not particularly .
but as I recall , it was up , didn't he run across the Mississippi
what's striking about that is the extent to which you discussed the
did you have a sense at the time of how momentous the death penalty
no .
no , I can't assume that .
that sense of the future , at that point .
how about the case Maxwell <v@l> Bishop where you actually
well , that put me on record as far as my personal attitude toward
I wanted to make it but I certainly didn't want to involve them in
I'd forgotten , it was Judge Vogel and someone else .
judge Matthes .
judge Matthes .
I'm glad I made the statement at the time , because it came to the
I remember there was an interview and some reporter asked me about
and Chief Justice Burger called me by telephone , he said , +"/.
+" why are you expressing an opinion on issues likely to come
I said , I'm already in the printed record on the death penalty so
he hadn't realized that I had that paragraph in Maxwell against
I didn't talk about other issues , but I wasn't afraid to talk
you've talked about when you came to the Supreme Court , and
but it sounds like you actually became comfortable with expressing
well , I guess I did on the Eighth Circuit , nobody told me not to
I'll never forget have I said this before in this thing ?
I'd circulated some case , one of my early ones , and he called and
+" I'd like to came down to your chambers and talk about this case
I said , +"/.
+" you stay where you are , I'll come up to yours .
after all , Hugo was in his eighties .
+" you stay where you are , I'll come down !
and sure enough he came down .
I could hear him shuffling down the hall .
he came in if this were a piece of paper , he was holding my
+" I like it , I like it very much because you go for the jugular .
+" always go for the jugular .
+" but , what I don't like about it is that you talk about how
+" never agonize in an opinion .
+" make it sound clear as crystal and we'll get along better .
well , I took his advise and took the expression I had in that
but I broke that advice in Roe against Wade .
paragraphs two and three , I think , I set forth that it was an
I'm glad I did .
what about the Pope case ?
you've mentioned that as part of a trilogy of death cases .
that case I guess went to an en banc .
I don't remember too much about Pope .
here was the all-American college student , fine record ,
it created a lot of problems for us ; at least they were fairly new
I've never known what had happened to young Pope .
we heard it , I think I wrote the initial opinion for the panel and
I guess I wrote it for the en banc court .
beyond that , the details of the case rather slip my memory ,
well , looking back in the light of Callins , in your last term of
yes .
but let me make this statement .
of course I had as a precedent the position taken by Justices
they've taken .
the position , and still , Justice Brennan still does when he makes
I can't subscribe to that because the Constitution itself and
my antipathy for it was in its application , which is different
I think initially I felt if a state , and there are now two-thirds
I couldn't say it was unconstitutional as violative of the Eighth
but after these twenty years , as I tried to point out in the
it's on that basis that I base my dissent .
now , you may not agree with it .
I disagree with Justice Brennan , but we reach the same conclusion
I'm struck when you read Maxwell <v@l> Bishop .
the defendant there raises a very similar claim to that , later
and what's interesting is that in Maxwell you acknowledge his claim
but then years later , you are ready to take that step .
do you think it's because of some pattern that you witnessed over
yes , indeed , I thought the facts demonstrated it .
both in those who were subjected to the death penalty .
certainly , there is racial distinction , racial discrimination ,
I readily reached the conclusion , which others did not , that in
would you like to say something about Jackson <v@l> Bishop ,
that's another opinion of yours that became famous .
I always liked the result in that case .
this was where Arkansas , in its list of possible punishments ,
convicted , more or less in charge of a group of convicts , out in
and they also had the teeterboards , I remember , which was , well
arkansas permitted the sentence to say that somebody should be on
then they had a refinement of it where they had a magneto of some
of course it gave him great pain at the time .
we held that those were unconstitutional punishments .
I've always been rather proud of that result .
do you think it was a radical result for the Eighth Circuit ?
it was at that time .
I had a feeling because some of my colleagues wondered about it .
we didn't have any violent argument about it .
I think it was a unanimous decision but , it was a little unusual
my , how times have changed .
when you were later confirmed for the Supreme Court , you testified
do you remember when you began to have that feeling , that that was
I'd forgotten that I testified to that effect .
it doesn't surprise me if it's there , Well , I've always felt ,
it isn't just legal theory , which a lot of , I think , legal
but , individual persons are affected by every decision the Supreme
they may not be aware of it right now , but that's why I think the
sometimes we forget about the litigants , who they are and how
I chose the phrase , “little people” .
I suppose , maybe that's improper , but I don't regret it .
I think our time is up .
we'll turn to the rest of the Eighth Circuit years in the next
so I better do my homework
