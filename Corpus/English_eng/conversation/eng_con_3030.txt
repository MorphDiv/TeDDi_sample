you_know what kind of core squares give this effect ? 0_2604
or you_know how how does &-uh this kind of flip affect a core
so we we did some of that . 12229_14031
+< well ‡ Firstname seemed to get at that a little bit . 13531_16312
yeah ‡ she did . 16312_18234
+< she talked about the +//. 16734_18126
+" these are the same diagonally &=ges:diagonal and &-uh +... 18126_21690
+< she's coming a long way &-uh because if you remember those talks
+" I just don't think so . 25417_26610
+" I just don't think a square has_to have sides that are the same .
&-um so she's really &-um getting very comfortable with
and &-um she's hanging with the group really well . 35581_37841
you_know ‡ I thought we would start out talking about flips and
actually talk about using mine as a symbol and maybe someone else's
to get them thinking about how are they gonna record just what it is
because some of them were talking to themselves as they use their
and some of them were just experimenting . 59460_61906
they just flipped and turned and you_know layed it out xxx +"/. 61906_64340
+" yeah ‡ that's different from the ones I've made so far . 64340_66316
and I like the way it looks . 66316_67568
and they glued it down . 67568_69727
but you_know if I just sat in front of them and said +"/. 69727_72015
+" tell me how you made this . 72015_73077
they'd say things like +"/. 73077_73947
+" well ‡ I took four core squares . 73947_75202
+" and I put them together to get a design I liked . 75202_77723
and we wanna go beyond that . 77723_79221
now ‡ can you tell someone exactly how to reproduce that ? 79221_83422
if you gave them your paper core squares and you told them the moves
so ‡ not just saying +"/. 89357_90756
+" I started with four core squares . 90756_91950
+" and I pushed them together . 91950_92853
or I arranged them . 92853_94052
or even to say +"/. 94052_96654
+" I flipped and turned them . 96654_96776
a_lot_of them would say that . 96776_97994
+" I flipped and turned my core squares until I got a design I liked
but what exactly did you do ? 100807_103074
now (i)s the time to think about that . 103074_105136
and that's usually very very challenging for them . 105136_107913
so I didn't know they would have so many good ideas about flips and
or that they would discuss fractions again in terms of turns . 112304_116341
+< mhm . 115304_115759
&-uh and I definitely didn't know we'd spend so much time talking
but see <that's just> that's something for them that is not
and I didn't know xxx how to handle that here . 123629_125879
+< uhhuh uhhuh they really xxx . 123629_125879
because kids who try &+d to describe that here are almost setting
I_mean we watched how challenging that is . 129822_132006
and it's not on the software . 132006_133950
and &-um it's not that I don't want them talking about it or don't
but I purposely tried to show them how hard it is to describe that
maybe they will choose to find another way . 145352_148496
what else could I do to it besides that that would be easier to
or if they get frustrated trying to describe a set of diagonal flips
+" but I know there must be another way to do this . 160148_162066
and they'll look and say +"/. 162066_162754
+" oh ‡ you_know a sideways flip might get me the same result . 162754_165207
or a sideways flip with a three quarter turn or whatever it is . 165207_169646
&-um I think they're they've really bought into that idea . 169646_173936
you_know they were like +"/. 173936_174441
+" oh ‡ but there's more ways . 174441_175309
+" there's more ways . 175309_175836
+" there's more ways . 175836_176297
we could have spent you_know twenty minutes talking about each one
so +... 182873_183572
yeah ‡ I can see they wanted to do more with that &=laughs that
+< I don't know „ yeah . 185048_186142
+< yeah ‡ Professor_Xxx needs to see that stuff about diagonal flips
I don't know what that is but +... 189251_190556
+< it's &-uh +... 189751_190556
and they're willingness to say +"/. 190556_191649
+" hey ‡ maybe nobody thought of that before . 191649_193693
+< uhhuh uhhuh . 192649_194320
and <they're not> they're not scared to say that . 193693_196464
what why did you bring bring that up about the software not
what what what &-uh what do you think it &-uh means for xxx ? 199675_205391
+< (be)cause I don't know exactly why it doesn't either . 202675_205391
or <I_mean I> well I do . 205391_207300
+< uhhuh . 206391_206995
it's really hard to it's very hard to talk to someone else about
but they have such good ideas about it . 212537_214732
and it seems to make so much sense to them . 214732_217380
they understand it . 217380_218253
that's a kind of flipping they understand very well . 218253_221070
+< uhhuh . 220099_220699
they were able to follow that whole thing that Nathan did describing
they were with him every minute most of them . 225057_227355
&-um so ‡ I don't know . 227355_230289
I just want to give them a chance to keep talking about this and
I don't know . 241991_243109
but when they talk to each_other +/. 243109_244681
all of that time talking about diagonal turns was necessary
and when they start working in teams to create quilts if someone
you_know if I say to you and you're my partner +"/. 253079_254617
+" do a diagonal flip on it . 254617_256154
you need to know what I mean . 256154_258078
or you need to be able to look at me and say +"/. 258078_260007
+" I don't understand those diagonal flips . 260007_262144
+" let's turn it or let's do a different kind of flip or let's do
so I don't want them to think they can't talk about those . 265350_268486
but <I'm kind_of> &-um I don't know how to handle it when they
(be)cause no other group has done this before . 276289_278657
+< right . 278089_278657
now ‡ they've kind_of talked about that a little bit . 278657_280892
but they've never continued talking about it after we got some
so ‡ I don't know . 290650_292960
I_mean it I'm afraid that it's +//. 292960_294800
+< in_fact we see xxx this more and more . 292960_295381
+< right . 294800_295146
I'm afraid though that I'm setting some of them up for failure <if
so I was trying to make that point . 304390_306167
they're harder to thinking about . 306167_307447
+" yes ‡ they make sense . 307447_308429
+" and we're trying hard to understand you . 308429_309790
+" but they're especially hard to talk to someone else about . 309790_313824
because (..) I I don't know . 313824_317185
I_mean <I think that> I think that's gonna get some of them
I'm like +"/. 323466_323807
+" well ‡ how do you put that into words ? 323807_325764
and that's gonna be even harder than trying to distinguish between
uhhuh . 331626_331993
so ‡ we'll see . 331993_332790
that's that's something to watch and to track . 332790_334843
so ‡ how do you think they'll do now with this &-um this task of
I I notice you're very explicit about you_know taking core
+< I can't say +"/. 351096_351640
+" what do I need to do to this one to get down here ? 351640_354124
+< right . 353224_354124
this one would just be an up down flip . 354124_355691
so ‡ I was trying to say +"/. 355691_356599
+" now ‡ this is my core square and how it began . 356599_358519
+" what did I do to the core square to get it in this position . 358519_363230
you_know that's what they have_to be thinking about . 363230_365191
but I don't think they were bothering to think about that . 365191_367485
they didn't need to think about that . 367485_368742
+< when they first xxx . 367985_369156
+< but they were designing . 368742_369681
<they were> they were designing . 369681_371777
+< just wanted to get a design . 369681_371777
they weren't distinguishing between where my core square started . 371777_375399
they knew it was their core square . 375399_376601
they knew all of them were the same . 376601_378363
they had checked and rechecked . 378363_379839
they didn't have_to think about that anymore . 379839_381708
they knew they hadn't gotten someone else's core square . 381708_383533
they had two by two design so they're okay . 383533_384960
+" any way I turn this or flip this this is store my core square so
+" I just need to put them together and get what I like . 389677_391831
&-um we didn't get to do as many models as I thought we would do
I thought that a_lot_of this morning would be work time for some of
&-um on this actual task . 399618_401794
but they were having discussions too valuable to cut short . 401794_405899
&-um but all of their activities this week and last week how easily
&-um how well they understand each_other when they describe flips
their journal entries that were like pulling teeth at first . 416862_420266
noone had anything to say . 420266_421493
but that's it . 421493_421992
they know a_lot . 421992_423216
they didn't know how to put what they knew into words . 423216_425474
and some did a better job . 425474_426509
but most of them if you notice by the end had written almost a full
+< right . 430080_430780
so ‡ they actually did . 430780_431878
and then during their discussion after they had done some thinking
so ‡ I think it's gonna be the easiest year so far . 437098_440363
the only thing that's sending a red flag up is how am I gonna deal
not just come up and model it for us (be)cause that they handle
and even the +"/. 453123_453792
+" well ‡ you do this but +... 453792_455372
writing that down with a second grader's you_know spelling skills
I think that's gonna be frustrating . 463271_464649
and I think I'm gonna have_to get to some of those kids and say +"/.
+" well ‡ should we see if there's another way to do it without a
(be)cause you could show this to someone . 469831_471295
but if you want to write something down that you're sure your tester
you_know maybe turning right one half &=laughs would be simpler
you understand this . 485366_487160
and you've shown me that . 487160_488244
and you could still show other people that . 488244_490137
but for and you_know the booklet isn't just for people who know all
our booklet is to share with people who haven't done any of this
our families and kids in other second grades and stuff . 498413_501155
so ‡ maybe we would totally lose them and confuse them . 501155_504920
but turning right one half would be easier for us to model or
so ‡ we'll try that approach and see what happens . 511436_513964
alright good . 513964_515219
