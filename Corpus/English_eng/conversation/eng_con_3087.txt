they don't have to be the same core guard that you said . 9740_11920
no they don't . 12350_13250
and then <what what> what does . 13860_15300
what makes a quilt . 15540_16180
family . 16200_16350
a quilt family is a whole bunch of four square . 17630_20900
whole bunch of square squares . 21170_22740
so they have to be the same four square . 22760_24020
no <in a way> in a way . 24740_27080
they don't have to be the same but can do something . 28120_30460
they have to be the same but range different . 30630_33210
yeah . 33970_34100
that's awesome . 34120_34530
they has to be the same by the range . 35310_36980
I think they have to &-um the course course have to be &-um the
what do you think about Brian's &-uh idea though that they're
can you read (th)em differently . 50200_50920
or <do they all> do they all they . 51140_53120
could they could be they could &-um like how this one is . 53560_58990
it . 59620_59700
could it could be &-um this one . 59840_63790
or it could be this one . 64739_66150
and it could go or it could like that . 68140_75500
same . 78030_78150
uhhuh . 78840_79020
how do you . 79820_80220
how do you . 80300_80710
how could you find . 80980_81940
how do you go about finding the core square <in a> in a quilt .
what would you look for . 87860_88510
&-um I'd look for the Core square . 89500_93280
you look for the core square . 95580_96700
yeah . 96950_97100
what would you figure out which one . 97510_98880
I could say that . 100400_101020
this is a core square paper . 101390_103150
I could say that this is one . 103450_104580
and I could say that this is one . 105010_106400
this is one . 107230_107820
how would I know which one it is . 107860_108850
I I bet it would be this one . 110540_115140
how did you know 'cause &-um because I think it might go like that
because &-um sometimes it does that . 124130_128100
it <is that> is that the way you've done it <on your> on
that you've made you start with a course . 134960_136980
quit . 137000_137260
mhm . 137400_137580
oops . 137600_137980
okay . 139630_139870
I need this . 140670_141590
alright . 142620_142870
I'm lower . 143060_143350
they need to get this done . 143470_144510
so . 144740_144840
yeah it's gonna try not to take up too much . 144960_148400
good . 149100_149230
alright . 149680_149890
well thanks for your time . 150040_151060
welcome . 151550_151970
thanks for explaining that to me . 152040_153350
you we didn't have any time . 153400_154620
yeah . 155330_155430
I know you don't have much time huh . 155520_157180
thinking about aren't sure . 159120_160740
beginning course square again . 160760_162060
here's your beginning course square . 162310_163460
don't sneeze anything . 163530_164450
are you going to sneeze . 167870_168630
I thought I was . 169480_170140
okay . 170430_170670
if you think you're going to sneeze that . 171040_172590
not on me . 173210_173550
okay . 174110_174350
look at just your beginning course score . 174760_176460
okay . 177030_177170
and the move you're gonna make . 177740_178560
it is a quarter turn . 178920_180110
to the right . 180380_180910
so let's do that . 181580_182510
and now look at the position . 183420_184560
it's in on the top . 184750_186970
what's next_to a solid orange . 187620_189740
square . 189910_190220
that's what you were talking . 191940_193010
about . 193120_193310
because we're gonna finish the top of the coursework . 196230_198070
so what will go right here <in this> in this part of your two
what will be happening . 204470_205310
there . 205510_205670
okay . 207790_208060
will it look exactly like it does . 209230_210820
here . 210840_210910
will I just do it like that . 211070_212300
no it'll it'll change . 213310_214490
right . 214970_215230
so you're gonna need what shapes for to fill this part of the
what shapes and what colors will you . 220390_222110
have . 222160_224410
what shapes will you have to cut to put in . 228590_230590
here on of the to drive the job . 230640_244910
go . 249940_250040
ahead . 250200_250300
and turn it if you need to . 250320_251430
okay . 252760_252850
what shapes and colors will you need to go next . 255670_258380
to this square orange and red . 258630_263550
Orange and red point to the part of the finished course where that
so I'm sure I know point to the part of your finished core square
looking at . 275320_275710
now that's the whole core square . 277540_278900
I wanna know what's gonna go next_to this solid orange square in .
this position your two by two . 283080_284360
design 'cause you want this part of your two by two design to show
after a right turn at one quarter . 289810_292460
okay . 293170_293270
so what you were doing to help you is taking your paper . 293420_295580
this is your original four square . 295670_297260
and turning it to the right one quarter . 297820_299740
and looking at the four square . 300140_301420
what is next_to the orange square on the top . 302110_305470
what is next_to the orange square on top of your core square . 307580_310580
after you turn it to the right one quarter . 310650_312390
point . 315780_315940
to that part of the core square . 316050_317260
yep . 317780_317910
so what colors and shapes do you see there . 318180_320750
orange and red . 322120_323000
orange . 323050_323300
okay . 323480_323680
those are the colors you see . 323770_324800
so you're gonna need orange and red orange . 324920_326510
what shapes will we need . 326830_327920
two triangles . 329150_330010
okay . 330760_331000
so two triangles will fill this section next_to your solid orange
and one triangle will be red orange . 336360_339090
I .
can see . 339770_340030
okay . 347940_348030
how will that be arranged . 349110_350270
next_to &-um or in this segment . 350560_353110
here . 353130_353390
where's that piece . 353410_354360
you just kept going to go . 354430_355590
is it . 366510_366780
why do you think . 368340_368820
so . 368990_369060
show me what you were thinking that helped you get that into
like like that . 373470_378100
why can't it go . 378820_379670
like this because that would be on the second course where you turn
okay . 396600_396690
so you know that this one that I moved into place here isn't in the
and tell me again how you know for sure that the way you arranged
is that how you . 408600_408840
had it . 409000_409260
I don't think so . 409440_410030
can you show me how you had it . 410470_411430
like . 412310_412460
that . 412670_412890
okay . 413320_413540
and how do you know for sure . 413580_414740
that's the right way . 414760_415580
well I turn to the right course with my eye . 416510_427350
good . 428190_428380
check . 428480_428560
so you turned your courser to the right one quarter with your eyes
great . 432490_432660
what's gonna go right here . 432860_433910
and what is that . 438270_438950
an orange try . 440130_441190
great . 441860_442060
okay . 442770_442870
alright . 442920_443270
I think you already have one of those cut . 443320_444680
oh well . 444920_445180
that one's cut . 445390_446020
but it's missing as corner . 446040_446940
let's use it . 447090_447630
there . 447720_447890
what is that . 448230_448700
one . 448920_449030
okay . 449080_449320
sure . 449720_449820
okay . 450110_450350
great . 450530_450830
why don't you read those . 451090_451770
down . 451840_452030
excuse me Julian and Sarah you need to work without talking . 452780_455810
I in that segment of your two by two design where you're trying to
after a right turn of . 461770_463910
&-um . 475310_475430
I could you point again . 475640_476360
'cause I wasn't sure which . 476820_477620
okay . 478430_478670
so the red rectangle and the orange rectangle are gonna be under
oops . 484930_485030
why do you say it . 486410_486910
looks . 486960_487080
there definitely is a part of your core square that's made up of an
yeah . 493830_494000
yeah . 494540_494700
and at first you said it was gonna go right here under your orange
right . 499170_499440
do you think it's going to why not because . 499620_502490
it's diagonally above it . 505720_507550
okay . 508610_508740
you were noticing that in your original course where the red
where will that red rectangle and orange rectangle go on the course
where will where you . 523809_525100
where will I see . 525290_525940
this arrangement of shapes . 525960_527150
a red rectangle right next_to an orange . 527540_529470
rec . 532700_532790
rectangle . 535030_535310
okay . 535790_535950
is that how you would describe this arrangement of shapes . 537380_539820
an orange rectangle right next_to a red rectangle . 539970_542220
okay . 542790_543030
so if that's in your original core square I'll find it somewhere in
can you show me where I'll find that . 548610_549980
where you'll be doing upside-down . 551160_555900
no . 557660_557830
right side up is fine . 557880_558870
right there . 560850_561260
why do you think that's the right place for it . 561620_563230
'cause if I put the right understanding that would be wrong . 565170_567420
