so, how does that support your perspective on the issue of school uniforms ? 385_4425
if you're on that side, why won't you just take off the other shirt that's not uniform ? 4765_16425
because you can wear whatever you want under it . 16965_19625
so then +... 19725_21545
that's done .
that's what I was going to say . 23985_25625
okay . 26125_26685
S_three ?
I disagree with him because +... 29405_31005
who ? 31405_31505
if you can wear whatever you want under your school uniform, he wears two layers, you'll be +... 31665_39865
what ? 39985_40145
if you wear two layers under your uniform . 40745_43645
you'll be hot and it's usually hot in the classroom . 44405_47625
you could choose what you want to wear under it, right ? 48105_49785
S_four ?
I disagree with S_one, and I agree with S_two, you could wear whatever you want, but it doesn't make sense to take off your shirt so you can wear the regular clothes you have under . 60445_71945
okay . 72305_74465
so I just want to make sure that we are grounding our argument in the research that we've been doing . 74965_79465
I agree that we all have our own personal opinions, especially since we all attend a school where uniform is required from Monday through Thursday . 80245_88905
but when we are having our conversations, we don't want it to be a back and forth about what someone personally wears . 89825_95825
if they are gathering evidence, it's because their perspective around this idea of school uniforms is still evolving . 96405_102205
they're still working it through . 102585_103865
does that make sense ? 104605_105505
yes . 105625_106165
S_five ?
I disagree with S_six and S_seven and agree with S_eight, S_nine and S_ten . 109845_114365
I do agree that we should wear uniform for field trips, just in case we get lost . 114445_128525
we can look through a crowd, identify who's wearing the same shirt as us, and we know where our group is . 128865_136205
but in the school halls we already know we're young and we're a Young Achiever and Young Achievers go to that school . 140425_146825
so in the school, I don't really think we need a shirt to prove it . 147705_154225
so what if you have other children that enter the building, how will you identify them ? 154725_159345
how will you know if a student that enters this building is actually a student that attends this school, if everyone is wearing regular clothing ? 160265_169305
so I'm just throwing that out there . 169745_171785
just throwing that out there . 172325_173245
S_eleven ?
I want to finish S_five's thought . 173685_176025
all right, you can try . 176505_177285
see what she's thinking around that . 177505_178845
because the question you asked her . 178885_180645
okay . 180745_181065
because you can identify someone by who looks familiar and who doesn't . 182595_189875
and +...
what if there's more people at the school ? 190995_191975
can I say something else ? 192755_199455
mmm-hmm .
what's the whole point of school uniforms, if it's not like they made a law about it ? 200875_209955
okay . 212475_212735
let's remember that this year was the first year we've got a whole new school that joined our building . 213015_221595
and so maybe before last year, you were able to identify all the kids by face because we used to be a much smaller school, but our school has continued to expand . 222815_234375
we've now pulled in a whole separate school into our building . 234635_239415
so how are you able to identify someone just by their face, without also knowing if you remembered seeing them maybe at a store, maybe you saw them at a theater . 240425_252445
how do you always remember that the face that you are looking at is the face of a Young Achiever ? 253045_257305
S_three ?
because S_six said if we don't know that person, we can just wear a bracelet or necklace or something that says Young Achievers on it, instead of just wearing uniforms and then they'll have it there . 259435_274315
xxx .
and if they lose it, they usually check in at the office . 275175_284315
so we'll actually know if they're a student . 284795_286555
S_twelve ?
mostly, you don't really have to make a necklace instead of wearing a school uniform, like making a necklace or anything because that will mostly take a long time . 293025_302025
just trying to make friends with them or trying to get to know each other better with them or trying to wear the school uniform to say that you're in the community and you just kind of know each other like that . 302605_314505
S_seven ?
I disagree with S_five, I mean not disagree but, they all say if you wear school uniforms in the school they'll know that that's you, but if you don't wear a school uniform, they might know you but if you go out the world and go on field trips and they don't know you, you might not know because you might see these people and if you're lost and you don't have no school uniforms and you try to tell them what school you are or they might say like, oh, are you really in the school ? 318365_348345
because they might not think that you are in their school . 384155_386695
S_seven, what you said reminded me of S_thirteen's argument around why we should wear school uniform . 388395_393415
and S_thirteen said that he remembers his basketball team and it convinces him to think that uniforms are important . 393735_400055
you all also pulled out the evidence, that uniforms show that we are a part of the same team or group . 400815_406675
uniforms show that you are a part of something bigger than yourself . 407415_411315
S_ten ?
the first thing I want to say is something from before, what S_one said . 420825_425605
I just want to say one thing from one, and then a second thing from a different thing . 426185_431485
the first thing that I want to say is, why do you keep accusing people of not wearing school uniform, just because they don't always wear a school uniform ? 431605_441285
plus you can wear, let's say if you said you can wear school uniforms under . 441525_446945
and the second thing I want to say is, I disagree with S_three because if you wear a necklace, that's just a waste of time just having to make a necklace when they already made a shirt . 448025_472085
if they already made a shirt for it, why do you need a necklace or a bracelet ? 472585_478145
xxx .
you can lose the bracelet or a necklace, but the shirt would be easier to find . 478705_495925
S_fourteen .
what do you think ? 504285_505065
I agree with S_ten and disagree with S_three, and I think S_eleven, I'm not sure . 505305_520685
but I disagree with S_three because I agree with saying you could wear layers under your shirt, but even though you get hot, you could still take off the layers, but still wear the uniform shirt . 520705_535485
and I agree with S_ten, because last time my sister, she didn't want to wear the uniform shirt and pants and then my mom forced her . 535505_558725
but that's your parents, but in the school, they really don't force you . 561785_566805
they just tell you wear uniform, like xxx, go find a shirt to wear a uniform . 566925_574005
and even though you went on a field trip and you got lost, yes, you would lose the necklace, even though sometimes it was on your neck and then it was always a distraction . 574065_592045
you would always take it off and then you would always play with it . 592725_597225
and then you would always play with the bracelet . 597425_598665
and then the next thing you know, you put it down somewhere and then you go and then you just leave it . 599005_604785
