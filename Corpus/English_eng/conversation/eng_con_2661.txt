oh I didn't bring my book .

&-um so I guess we can kind_of start anywhere really .
&-um either with the films although the films may might make more sense if we talk about them I guess at the end in relation to Haussmann or in relation to reading the films knowing what we know about city planning .
but &-um we can start anywhere .
should we start with the Benjamin ?
we can start anywhere .
that would be great .
(0.5) .
I'm kind_of interested about this book Paris Capital of the Nineteenth Century .
is the entire book just these tiny little essays just through the entire thing ?
or .
the book is called The Arcades Project the ⌊ whole book ⌋ .
⌈ okay ⌉ okay +/.
+, and it's written in +//.
this Paris Capital of the Nineteenth Century is just a fraction .
I think this was actually written up the the shape of this essay is basically the shape of the of The Arcades Project +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, but this was written up in a sense to justify that project .
because the &-um Arcades Project is about five hundred pages of what're called convolute +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, or folders +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, so you look under convolute and prostitution and then underneath it it has all these other sections .
+, mkay +/.
+, so this in in in essence is a kind of &-um boiled down version of all of the stuff in The Arcades Project .
&-um that he doesn't really as as are parts of The Flaneur parts of The Boheme which we didn't read which is also about Baudelaire (0.6) so I think I mentioned last time that the title is Haussmann or the Barricades and I &-um optimistically put Haussmann and the Boulevards &-uh which would be a better title for the Willms article I think .
than <for the> for the the Benjamin but so yeah let's start here this is a great place to start .
what're your thoughts on (0.5) Benjamin and Haussmannization ?
or his take I mean that might be I think that's the question I ask right ?
+, mhm mhm +/.
+, so I mean we might as well start with Benjamin's reading who is Haussmann +..?
lemme see (0.5) .
it's really not too &-um not to &~critic I mean not compared to the other one that we read .
&-um you know basically he just says that Haussmann built it built the boulevard to &-um protect civil to to avoid civil war .
mhm +/.
+, so &-um it really was pretty just of I felt the the style was pretty mild +/.
+, right .
+, I mean it was just kinda telling a little .
the what was pretty mild ?
the style .
the style .
yeah .
yeah it was fairly general .
and it sort of seemed like the Willms article was written in reaction to him ⌊ and ⌋ +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, he says you know historians have the tendency to say that it was that Haussmann did this just to &-um secure against the barricades in civil war but it's much more nuanced than that much more complicated and I mean I think he had this &~articl it seemed like he had this article in mind .
I think also that on page one sixty that &-um the sixth line from the top .
where that &{l=READING meanwhile he estranges the Parisians from their city they begin to be conscious of its human &~cha character .
mhm +/.
+, that's pretty tough .
I mean that's that's really I wouldn't want that said about me you know that I estranged the inhabitants of the city from it .
+, mhm +/.
+, or that I brought out the inhumanity +/.
+, uhuh +/.
+, of where humanity should be +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, the most .
mhm .
that's so fleeting you know like the just that little .
yeah yeah I do +/.
&=laughs ⌊ and then ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ agree ⌉ that most of it is &-um I mean most of it's +/.
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ you know ⌉ I mean he goes into laleque@s:fra he goes into other things so it's not even all about Haussmann but &-um but I &~j I don't know those two lines just really jumped out at me .
mhm .
mhm .
yeah reading that as &-um it kind of brought to mind what's happening today even &-uh with the &-uh national library and at &-um Bercy .
mhm +/.
+, which +//.
I mean it seems like every time they wanna get rid of &=laughs you know &-uh people that they you know build some enormous project &-um to get rid of (th)em send (th)em on out .
+, mhm +/.
+, that might be &~a a little bit unfair but I don't know .
mhm .
does &-uh but then what you guys are saying does hold up in the next paragraph the true purpose was to secure the city against civil war .
you know it's not like the power politics behind it all that we get in the +/.
yeah +/.
+, ⌊ mhm mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ Willms ⌉ so .
he also places all the blame or credit &-um on Haussmann .
I mean he barely brings up &-um Napoleon .
yeah mhm yeah .
&-um right which is I think one of the the real stark contrasts +/.
mhm +/.
+, with the two articles .
Willms starts with the emperor .
right ?
starts with Napoleon Trois and +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, yeah .
&-um and then sort_of says this was the plan and then Haussmann .
Haussmann sort_of carried it out but basically it was Napoleon that wanted to do this and he had already been making plans etcetera etcetera .
hm .
because of his fears .
uhuh +/.
+, of civil war having lived through +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, xxx in eighteen thirty and eighteen forty eight .
&~w that style I mean just to I &~wa I wanna respond to two things but the style of Benjamin I think you're right to pick up on that .
those fleeting references the fragments .
and as I said this is a kind of &-um microscopic version of the &~f the fragmentation in in the whole of The Arcades Projects .
so if you can imagine that in The Arcades Project every one of these sentences has a little folder that goes with it that's basically what +//.
it would be like he just took this the you know the either the topic sentence of the folder or the title of the folder and created <this string of> of &-um of &~s you know &~str paragraphs I guess .
why again the why the barricades ?
why Haussmann or the barricades ?
we talked earlier about some of the other Baudelaire or the Streets of Paris &-um Louis_Phillipe or the Interior Fourier or the Arcades like yeah whatever but why barricades ?
(0.10) I mean using that one word what does that what does that do to all of Benjamin's argument ?
(0.4) .
&=coughs excuse_me when he says that &-um Haussmann seeks to prevent barricades in two ways .
but by linking them together in the title that just reinforces any kind of connection and kind of highlights that you_know regardless of whether he you_know did mean to take down or prevent barricades that essentially that is what is created by this dehumanizing the city and forcing people out_of it .
right .
so in fact it's both .
it's both those &~dis possibilities .
but how does that also help that notion of the barricades how does that help them him move it to the conclusion ?
(0.6) either stylistically speaking or in terms of content +..?
I mean I think as you pointed out Dominica that all the blame or credit lies on Haussmann +/.
mhm +/.
+, of this new city .
+, mhm +/.
+, (0.12) .
well and it reduces the the boulevard to just the purpose of of preventing barricades too .
it doesn't explore any of the other benefits perhaps of having the boulevard or other disadvantages to them .
right .
so again it reduces &~ben the &~f the the sort_of in a sense import of of Benjamin's argument .
<is that> is that what you +//.
would you agree ?
mhm .
although I think that Benjamin himself doesn't necessarily see all the advantages and disadvantages .
mhm +/.
+, in this anyways he didn't write about the .
no and I mean he basically +//.
isn't he just saying there was a complete and total failure because of the commune and he's +/.
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ like ⌉ Haussmann Haussmann's project basically &-uh led to the commune and like the burning of everything &-uh total destruction as what does he say ?
&{l=READING a fitting conclusion to Haussmann's work .
&}l=READING .
mhm .
right .
right and so he can actually use that's even though this is all very sketchy he actually uses Haussmann to be able to push forward &~int up to just about the time that he's writing .
you know to surrealism .
in the twenties .
so up until about the the &~t he's writings this in the thirties so &-um yeah .
it points to the &~i the illusion first of all .
&-um of the the impossibility of barricades .
mhm +/.
+, and then to the the &~ulti the the failure .
but then what does that say about Benjamin's argument ?
(0.7) if the people actually were able to have civil war does that I mean he's trying to pit the barricades in a sense against Haussmann that that they're the failure of the boulevards is that the barricades could be built .
but then that in some ways sort_of negates part of &~o Benjamin's argument about &{l=READING the true purpose of Haussmann's work was to secure the city against civil war .
&}l=READING <does that> &~ma does that make sense ?
well it could be well I think it does but but it could also be like the purpose I mean the fact that it was the purpose doesn't doesn't necessarily mean <that it> that it was accomplished right ?
mhm .
and I don't think his I I think in fact he he mentions a little bit like how barricades were were &~possi in the sentence like .
yeah right in the next part .
so that the purpose in this sense is not necessarily consequence or result .
it's just the &~en &-um .
it's just his intention ?
his intention .
right +/.
+, I mean that's a good way to read that .
(0.10) .
&-um I sort_of got lost a little bit right toward the end .
mhm +/.
+, &-um especially in that sentence on the top of one sixty two where he says that &-um what's the guy +//.
&-um architecture photography literature commercial art &-um these are you know these are on the these are going to the point of &-uh &{l=READING these are on the point of going to the market as waiters &}l=READING okay ?
fine I get that .
&{l=READING but they hesitate on the brink .
&}l=READING and that's that's part <where I> where I suddenly got lost like &-um +...
where does he see where is he drawing the line then between not coming to the market and going onto the market and aren't they already on the market +..?
why are they hesitating ?
what is this brink ?
(0.7) .
that's a good question anyone wanna tackle that ?
I don't wanna tackle that but I want &=laughs:multiple but I wanna add something to it .
I was trying to think &-um when you were asking Carina were asking &=laughs:multiple about &-um you know what's his argument so I was thinking you know because I have this underlined too and I didn't know what to do with it .
so I'm trying to think of this as like a you know a liminal kind of they hesitate on the brink they're in the threshold they can go either way .
and to me that's really assumed Haussmann and the barricade .
that you know Haussmann can go either way .
he can you know have this intention of preventing barricades and he can but he ultimately ends up with the Paris fire .
you know and the barricades can ultimately can initially be seen as something that's kind_of positive but end up as something +/.
mhm +/.
+, not so much .
so maybe it's the same kind of characteristic marking all of this that you know and which would work really well with the idea of you know the fleeting the ephemeral all that +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, with that stuck in their mid motion ready to go either way .
so that didn't answer your question at all but ⌊ it ⌋ .
⌈ no but it makes ⌉ it I mean if it's form if that makes it formulate it better I think &-um (0.8) .
really I didn't know what to do with surrealism at the end of all this either .
yeah +/.
yeah +/.
+, it it was really kind_of poetic the way he sets it up and very nice .
&-um like they are residues of a dream world .
the the arcades the interiors exhibitions panoramas this dream world I guess it's like (0.6) the the dream for &-uh +...
I couldn't say a classless society I don't think I don't know that that's part of the dream .
&~cla yeah I would say (0.4) .
or the promise that modernity &-um +/.
yeah +/.
+, you know but what is that promise again ?
I mean that one of the promises of modernity is a classless society <in sort_of way> .
is it though ?
one of +//.
well one of them .
I mean +/.
+, ⌈ modernism ⌉ you know modernism makes that +/.
+, mm +/.
+, or modernity in the case of our <conversation it doesn't necessarily keep> +/.
+, right .
+, &-um but here he's talking also about capital then .
+, mhm +/.
+, so maybe I don't know .
what do you think ?
&=laughs (0.6) .
well I think of when he says dreams you know the promise of &-uh modernity I I think more of like a liberal &-uh democratic economy +/.
mhm +/.
+, capitalism at work .
and then I would tie that back in at the end when he says &{l=READING in the convulsions of the commodity economy .
&}l=READING so in trying to attain that that's when we recognize that the monuments everything all of our dreams were crushed with this rebellion .
(0.4) .
wait can you explain that again ?
&-um yeah so when he's talking about realization of dream elements you know &-um I think of that as like the promise of capitalism or liberal democracy for the bourgeoisie .
&-um but all that collapsed &-um at the end of the nineteenth century and &-um that I mean that's basically how I read the last sentence I guess in the convulsions of the commodity economy .
in trying to reach them that's that it it convulsed it it just exploded it didn't work .
that makes a_lot_o(f) sense .
and not only did they talk about &-uh commodity economy but he brings in you know the dialectical thinking as +/.
mhm +/.
+, related to the dream and then as history is related to a dream and surrealism and +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, all of it .
+, mm +/.
+, so all of the major don't wanna say &~na narrative but overriding you know philosophies are being connected to the dream that's connected to surrealism you know the fleetingness of modernity but somehow they're all not quite making it .
mhm .
I think there's a_lot_of things in there that aren't quite making it .
right ?
I mean there is the dream of the bourgeoisification .
mhm +/.
+, &~th the &-um the &~dr &~tha that doesn't happen .
the dream for &~cla &-um the class struggle that doesn't happen .
&-um .
mm .
so is Haussmann just being held up as the paradigmatic figure of the attempt that just doesn't ultimately work ?
is that why this is all attached to him and the barricades ?
I don't know .
<I mean> I think that .
dashed hopes .
&=laughs yeah it .
he represents sort_of a model of of the hope of of modernism .
modernity and and yeah I I think that's what he is ⌊ being held up as ⌋ .
⌈ just progress ⌉ and +/.
⌊ yeah exactly ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ technology ⌉ and economic development all of that .
the idea not necessarily the success +/.
mhm +/.
+, or the failure .
I think is what Benjamin is saying is important here .
sort of the giddy stage of modernity .
(0.12) I still don't understand that hesitate on the brink sentence though .
&=laughs:multiple .
&-um I have kind_of a an idea but it's a it's truly negated by post World War Two culture .
I mean in a sense if what the reading that Benjamin is giving in in &-um the mid nineteen thirties here early nineteen thirties is that that moment which can be seen either through its objects arcades panoramas or through its ideals &-um is already in ruins and he's writing at this +//.
at a moment when he's seeing the &~co the destruction of the last of the arcades in Paris .
some of which are +//.
but there's like five that are saved or something .
&-um and remember he sees the arcades the kind of crumbling of the arcades as a kind of etiology &-um e@l t@l no how do +//.
I don't know how the heck that's pronounced .
&=laughs:multiple oh yeah .
I'll just spell it .
&=laughs E T I O L O G Y .
I believe that is pronounced etiology .
&-um a kind of symptomology there we go .
&=laughs &-um of of of this sort_of bourgeois ideal .
right ?
you &~de with the &~arca the crumbling in a sense of the arcades and all of that .
now at the same time +...
&~th the &~inc incredibly violent and horrific repression of the commune also falls within I believe that crumbling .
(0.5) &-um so on the one hand the brink could be sort_of the mass market .
what we end up with in post World War Two economy .
the the the what's what's called modernization through technology rather than modernity .
&-um often called in France Americanization .
&-um where you have the mass production of commodity items .
not just you know small not just &-uh the the manufacturing of say you know &~ph &~ph photographs &-um and posters and things like that but you know sort_of the leisure zone comfort zone stuff like washers and dryers and washing machines and all that stuff which we'll talk about sort of midway through this course .
at the same time (0.14) what (0.5) the commercialization (0.6) commercialization in not fulfilling the promise I think that was the word you you all used .
&-um (0.7) is analogous to you know this &~destructi the the deterioration of the arcades .
I mean I was gonna argue that it was also the commune but I just realized that the they in &{l=READING they hesitate on the brink &}l=READING is in fact all these products .
mhm +/.
+, so I can't actually read the commune into that sentence .
(0.6) see at the very beginning of that paragraph &{l=READING Balzac was the first &}l=READING on the bottom of one sixty one &{l=READING Balzac was the first to speak of the ruins of the bourgeoisie &-um but only surrealism exposed them to view &}l=READING which is obviously the the Paris Peasant .
right ?
who pulls from this arcade which is about to be destroyed for the &-uh prolongation of the &~Hauss boulevard Haussmann ironically but that's also the sort_of dreamscape dream space &-um before the mass you know before the sort_of mass market department stores right ?
I mean not before but before they became you know before Carrefour Prix Unique and all of those type of department stores .
&~dis before discount department stores in the fifties basically eradicated small shops .
you know eradicated boutiques so (0.20) I mean I think my +//.
yeah go ahead .
I'm sorry .
this is kind_of a different topic but I just was trying to figure out where the beginning of this <all came> into it .
&-um one forty nine because as I was reading this &-um this morning I like gambling converts time into narcotic sentence just so directly does not go with the films from last night .
where time was the &~regulat the regulatory function and you know time was not a narcotic not in the same way and then when I was trying to figure out what that went with it was the stock exchange and so more about commodities and &-um commodity economy and how that kind of works its way into a dreamscape .
so through the through this connection of gambling from that &{l=READING playing the stock exchange this places the game of chance into the horns of the condemned <in feudal> society .
&}l=READING so maybe is this an example of what he's talking about at the end ?
is this the convulsions of commodity commodity economy ?
that the stock exchange brings in not only this commodity thing but also the the narcotic the misrepresentation of time ?
because I didn't know what to do with the gambling <there in> &~thi there in the start .
&-uh I'm very glad you brought that up because while I haven't really thought about it I just realized of_course that if Benjamin is writing in the early nineteen thirties this would be &~s at the moment just few years past the great crash and the height of various different kinds of economic sort_of early early &-um tremblings of economic crisis .
so &-um (0.4) right .
I mean I was actually reading this thing about gambling more with the flaneur@s:fra right ?
more about the time of the flaneur@s:fra this kind of leisure time rather than the time of the factory of the nineteen twenties and thirties so I was reading +/.
⌊ oh okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ that more as like ⌉ an eighteen forties eighteen thirties eighteen forties like pre Haussmann .
perhaps in the time of the factory that we saw last night <the time> the time does not belong to them to those people it's more like they belong to the time right ?
as opposed perhaps to the people <in the> in the garden in Metropolis +/.
mhm +/.
+, who who had time they they did have time xxx .
right .
so gambling could be more like for them for the people that have the time .
right where that's the only space in which that kind of notion of time can remain within a leisure class that is not even a bourgeois class it's almost like an &~aris an +/.
mhm +/.
+, aristocracy .
but I think that the notion of gambling really works well for both .
mhm +/.
+, &-uh and it especially within this discussion of Haussmann and &-um you know the whole rebuilding of Paris &-um because as far as like literature's concerned that's I can't think of any text like earlier than late nineteenth century that really tackled that to talk about you know the dangers of you know real estate speculation etcetera etcetera etcetera .
&-um for example Zola's La Curee I mean the entire book is about that .
about <how these> how these people just they were so wealthy but they had no money in the bank whatsoever and it was just so &-um precarious .
so I think that works very well .
right .
and that &-um with Haussmann's &-uh transformation of Paris he brings along with him &-um land value a land value system based on real estate speculation .
that the city had not known to that point .
that is areas that were considered unsanitary and unhealthy which would've just been torn down were now in fact being rebuilt in a kind of bourgeois model .
&-um you know the sort_of all those rows of Rue_De_Rivoli is a very good example in Paris where all of the facades are exactly the same .
you have the gallery underneath right ?
and the the front the work the architectural work is based on a kind of &-um &-uh &~m mass production of these like stone &~edif stone ornamentation for the edifice the facade so &-um yeah I mean I think that +//.
and and Willms actually quotes La Curee in in the article .
that obviously the gambling works well with that notion of real estate speculation .
&-um and the stock exchange displaces gaining or gambling that kind of speculation I'm thinking of Manon Lascaux .
I don't know if you're familiar with that novel from eighteen mid eighteen mid eighteen &=laughs:multiple hundreds .
seventeen something xxx &=laughs I don't remember .
seventeen I don't remember .
oh man yeah .
so &-um where gambling is equated with a descent into the underworld .
that that is the that's the and it's only for the very wealthy .
mhm +/.
+, and that Manon &~La Lascaux would get caught up in all of this gambling as a kind of outsider &-um you know she kind of goes with the gambler because she thinks he's kind_of a man of money &-um because the gambler in this sort_of &-um both connected to the very wealthy and the underworld .
and of_course she just ends up with debt .
&=laughs:multiple (be)cause she's not of the right class .
&-um but how does gambling the stock market I mean how does that get us back to both the hesitation and the brink ?
I mean is that the stock market crash ?
is that a kind of larger more general consequence of trying to create mass commodity economy when it's not actually ready for +//.
when culture society economy is not yet ready for it ?
I mean I don't know .
(0.5) .
maybe just the time necessary for them to catch on as commodities and .
right I mean some ways you'd think that Benjamin would be kind of celebrating the demise .
he doesn't seem to be .
he seems to be more interested in this dialectical movement &-um in a kind of Marxist interpretation of history .
so it's strange that one would (0.5) like like there there +...
I mean Aragon@s:fra is the one who initially says that the arcades are a residue of a dream world .
&-um a receptacle a fence is the other term that that Aragon@s:fra uses .
so I can't figure out if there's irony or sadness in Benjamin .
(0.10) .
the very &~f second sentence &-um the xxx between &{l=READING noble technical necessities by artistic aim &}l=READING seems to me a bit ironic .
&~jus &-uh the &~n the the word necessities .
Haussmann &~wha what Haussmann was doing he he hadta do .
he had no +//.
he hadta do it .
mhm +/.
+, and that seems a bit ironic .
ironic to me .
right .
(0.10) well I mean the very beginning starts with the apotheosis so that already we're at the we're at the height or the apex of the the sort_of bourgeois dominance .
secular and and clerical dominance of the bourgeoisie .
&-um (0.4) in <the streets> the streets which are in a sense Haussmann is in a sense compelled to construct in that way .
as technology necessitates that he do that .
&-um as you know health laws and the all these other sort_of laws put in place eminent domain was put in place at that point .
so all of these things leading to that I I agree .
so I mean I'm wondering +...
if we hit already the &~aput the &~apo apotheosis then &-um (0.4) how can we come back to a brink ?
(0.31) .
well perhaps the creation of the boulevard creates a space in which &-um a a commodity economy can flourish but before then the &~kin &~i the the commodities themselves are kind of on the brink .
but this new construction where the bottom floor is &-uh reserved for commercial use really creates a a rather large space where the commodity economy can succeed once and for all .
(0.5) .
right .
(0.22) maybe it was because +...
maybe I'm just gonna attach this tangentially to what you just said &-um Jamie .
and I'm looking on page one sixty one where &-um there's actually this discussion of the lack of a guiding theory of revolution .
&{l=READING if on the one hand the lack of a guiding theory of revolution was the undoing of the old workers' uprisings it was also on the other hand the condition for the immediate energy and enthusiasm with which the set about establishing a new society .
this enthusiasm which reached its climax in the commune &}l=READING so we have on the one hand this kind of anarchic uprising another sort_of climax or apex which is the commune ultimately &-uh with dashed hopes .
&~n I mean (0.5) I mean perhaps what &~Ben I mean I've never actually thought about these things so just bear with me .
you know perhaps <one of the> &-um one of the things that Benjamin is pointing to in fact is &-um this dialectical movement within history .
which is what he would be doing at the end there .
&{l=READING for this reason dialectical thinking is the organ of historical awakening .
each epoch not only dreams the next but also dreams strives toward the moment of waking .
it bears its end in itself and unfolds it &}l=READING so in fact you know as Hegel xxx the ruse .
so in fact maybe the point that he's making is that there's some kind of dialectical movement or cycle that brought the sort_of bourgeoisie that could've lead to some kind of dominance of the bourgeoisie over everything .
over you know the entire culture which I would argue happens after World War Two but that it doesn't happen at that moment .
he &~gi also gives +//.
throws in the example of the commune which goes to this point and then gets dashed .
right and so instead of this &-um (0.5) instead of like the celebration then of bourgeois dominance at this time or liberal democratic economy &-um while things were in place one would think things are in place in fact it hasta fail .
it hasta kind of &~s keep striving and changing .
does that make sense ?
I mean that's kind_of ultimately quite simplistic but &-um I mean if I read on with the Hegel &{l=READING it bears in its end it bears its end in itself and unfolds it .
&}l=READING so that it sort of wraps itself up to kind_of end it but also unfolds the &~pi possibility or potential for the next +/.
mhm +/.
+, moment of waking .
so this will to like totalization is a failure because this brink is in fact hesitation ?
it's not just that &~hesi you know they hesitate on the brink but the brink itself is hesitation ?
is that what what .
yeah or (0.4) that the products them +//.
that I mean he's sort_of he's saying all these products but of_course he means everything about modernity &-um that the brink itself is hesitation .
well that it there there is +...
&-uh maybe &=laughs .
like that dream world and +/.
right +/.
+, like hesitating is is the waking state ?
I don't +//.
I assume .
what it +//.
is that how he characterizes it ?
no wait a minute the realization of dream worlds dream elements <in the it's the> xxx I don't know this is allegoric .
+, mhm +/.
+, &=laughs:multiple &{l=READING they stand as ruins .
&}l=READING &=laughs &-um so these ruins this is like &-um now &~whe when he usually &~s says ruins that means like irredeemable &-uh fragments of like that don't end up being resolved in the end .
+, right +/.
+, is that +/.
+, right +/.
+, okay .
okay .
(0.9) boy we went a long &=laughs &=laughs:multiple .
yeah I mean I think that this is &-um yeah the close reading stumps the &~s I mean in a sense I guess we're supposed to be stumped by Benjamin .
in that very sort_of that way of writing that one could perhaps write an entire dissertation on what is the brink in modernity ?
you know .
xxx gonna take it +/.
+, &=laughs:multiple hesitation or space .
Jaime and I are gonna fight over that one .
&=laughs:multiple xxx dissertation it's mine .
&=laughs .
the brink is mine .
&=laughs I hesitate .
no .
&-um (0.4) yeah .
so Haussmann Benjamin's Haussmann then is the kind of &-uh +...
I mean what is he ?
he's not just the &-um the kind of perpetrator .
he's the artist in demolition .
&=laughs .
he's the artist in demolition exactly right .
so he's not just he's he's criminal and artist in demolition .
for Willms ⌊ who is Haussmann for Willms ⌋ ?
⌈ xxx ⌉ Doctor_Jekyll and Mister_Hyde that's what he is according to Willms .
right .
he was very popular with the workers was he not ?
because he was seen as someone who was creating jobs .
maybe not for people that were getting expelled from their homes but like &-um the masons etcetera etcetera .
oh yeah .
oh yeah and &-um .
and at the time did they realize how corrupt his his accounts were ?
was that made public or did that did they find out much later ?
that was &-um it would've probably +//.
I mean I'm not I don't know for sure +/.
mhm +/.
+, but the the second empire &=laughs:multiple &-um was &-um disgraced in disgrace and shambles I mean really &-um at the point at which the the &~Franco_Pru the yeah the Franco_Prussian War +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, was kind_of underway .
within the administration there was definitely knowledge of the corruption .
+, mhm +/.
+, and it isn't until after the commune +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, that that comes out .
so when Haussmann's memoirs are published I think in like eighteen ninety +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, he's &~ca he's really &~rehabil trying to rehabilitate +/.
+, oh okay .
+, his work .
well it's perfect for the third republic then for them to just trash Haussmann and +/.
mhm +/.
+, <the emperor> .
right &-um so at this time there were many people who were critical right the <there were> there were critics of Haussmann and the Paris plan because they believed that Haussmann was really doing exactly what Benjamin said he was doing which is basically protecting against civil war .
but because that was in a sense a part of the hidden agenda that was never made public .
so the the the critics were always &-um sort_of stopped in their tracks by Haussmann and Napoleon publishing these tracts about why they were doing this which never had anything to do with the &-um the civil war .
&-um (0.7) so it's really only in retrospect that you have the &-um this this &~kin you can have this kind of discussion by Willms that he's done a_lot_of archival digging and using the literature of that time to point to both the ecstasy and the critique of the plan +...
&-um (0.4) so +...
yeah Haussmann is a Doctor_Jekyll Mister_Hyde but also the part that Napoleon Three played +/.
mhm +/.
+, is very key to understanding how Haussmann +...
much more so than &-um Benjamin talks about I mean doesn't even seem to talk about him at all in fact (0.5) .
I thought it was interesting how he &-um talks about &-um Haussmann being the this is the the last paragraph the last part of the last paragraph it said &{l=READING Haussmann's transformation of Paris created the conditions for the great myth in which modernity is fulfilled .
the myth of the metropolis as it is has manifested itself in the Paris of the second empire .
&}l=READING like the way he sees &-um modernity as as something that was fulfilled right ?
so that makes me think that he he's like more interested in the aesthetic or architectonic or &-um urbanization &-um idea of modernity right ?
like for Paris .
yes .
⌊ so ⌋ .
⌈ not so ⌉ much <on the> on the social social struggle that that came with it .
mhm .
so how does +//.
I mean given what you just said how does Willms see Haussmann ultimately ?
as a benefactor .
right as a benefactor .
mhm +/.
+, as a kind of &-um predecessor to all urban planners even .
+, mhm +/.
+, right ?
he would fit into the &-um the planner with a vision and ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ right ⌉ the planner with right with vision .
(0.8) right .
(0.6) .
I thought it was interesting Willms also talks about &-um how this whole plan was much more my &-er much more than just a reaction to like eighteen thirty and eighteen forty eight but more that he just was obsessed with the idea of having like complete control over like the urban space right ?
mhm +/.
+, &-um not so much in reaction to a possible revolt but just preventing it just through modernization .
(0.23) .
xxx <urban landscape> .
&-um yeah complete control .
mhm +/.
+, I mean &~wha the this article in fact builds builds a kind of &-uh suspense of control .
builds a kind of whole narrative of control .
&-um besides having an immense personal creative contribution to the transformation of Paris .
&-um it's all in some ways about various different kinds of control .
on starting with his appointment as the Prefect +...
&-um he later became called Baron Haussmann .
I don't know if he was just sort of granted that title or whether he purchased it but I suspect he was his his memoirs are by the Baron Haussmann .
anyway so first he becomes &-um the Prefect and he starts &~organisi organizing around the the sort_of maps or plans of Napoleon Trois on and he actually literally starts with map making .
right ?
so we we've talked about I mean go back to what we talked about with the with &-um the Eiffel Tower Barthes and De_Certeau and the notion of the vista the panorama the panoptic view +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, of the city right ?
the overhead of the city .
and he made this map I mean he you know and then hired obviously people to help him make this map but I was fascinated by this detail that he worked over a year to complete the master plan .
and the master plan &-um was drawn to this scale one to five thousand or something like that .
&-um in order and it was produced on this movable easel I'm just quoting here from the text and that it could be very easily reproduced in a much smaller scale that could be taken out and used on the street level .
but they were still looking at the street on the street level with these overhead maps these overhead plans .
so &-um what I find fascinating is that and as &-um Dominica pointed out that that notion of control begins with the inception of this project .
right ?
and a visual some kind of visual control &-um .
and I guess this map making comes like from I don't know the fifteenth century perhaps ?
in like when empires are being formed it's like to have the control <and to> and to use it as a symbol also for for control .
mhm right .
and I heard a a really interesting lecture about various different cities and in Rome Pope Sixtus so in Pope Sixtus the fifth &=laughs and I think the late &{l=SIC teenth@u &}l=SIC late &=laughs fifteen hundreds or fifteenth century depending on my notes which I'm not gonna look up at the moment &-um he actually decided to use the &~ci the sort_of ancient city of Rome to reconstruct his contemporary city .
so what was like ruins and rural which had originally been part of &-um &~a the the city of Rome in antiquity &-um he had a map drawn of based on ruins and then reconstructed roads based on old roads and then started developing pockets .
this is back when the church controlled all of Rome .
&-um so it's I think that that's true that there was this notion that drawing from perspective but then also this overhead .
this &~im imagined sort_of bird's eye view that you would have of your city .
&-um and all about kind of setting control .
both in terms of networking of the networks of the streets the walls that were existing all of that are drawn in these maps .
so ⌊ agree ⌋ .
⌈ and what I think ⌉ is also really interesting is what he chooses not to control like the petits@s:fra banlieus@s:fra that that is talked about .
you know basically saying okay you're not worth my time .
I'll give you some churches and &=laughs:multiple you'll be happy with that .
mhm +/.
+, but you don't get sewers you don't get what you need because <you're not> you're not worth controlling you're you're on the outsides .
yeah .
outsides of what ?
that's key .
what &~i what're they +//.
(be)cause you're absolutely right .
tax wall isn't it ?
right .
outside the tax wall .
mhm +/.
+, &-um one of the Baudelaire poems that I don't think I reproduced for you is called the Wine of the Barrier .
and it's all about people sort_of lining up along the &~bar &~a along that wall at night to go outside to buy their wine .
&=laughs:multiple so they don't hafta pay the tax .
and to go outside and drink it .
buy their wine and drink it outside the wall so they don't hafta pay city tax on the wine .
does any part of that wall still exist ?
I don't remember any mention of it here .
the Porte D_Orleans all those Porte_De_Whatevers +/.
that's +/.
+, that's those original tax walls .
those gates of the tax walls .
+, hm +/.
+, and you hadta come through those you were +/.
+, ⌊ wow ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ taxed as ⌉ you came through those doorways .
I think the map &-um +...
yeah .
this map on &-um (0.6) I think that's the xxx wait let me just double check this maybe I'm hallucinating +...
&-um (0.7) I thought that this map &-um the major elements of the Parisian street system (0.4) +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, actually shows in some ways these these exterior boulevards show the various different kinds of you have the fortifications right around the outside .
and then you come into the the exterior boulevards which were new but basically were just inside the tax wall .
to this internal periphery which would have been equivalent to the old wall .
+, mm okay +...
+, &-um and of_course now you have the whole &-uh periphery highway that goes all the way around the outside .
connecting up &-um of this this more recent map right connecting up all of the neighborhoods .
(0.4) yes I I too find it fascinating that he (0.5) oh right &~beti between the tax wall and the fortifications right ?
so outside right ?
so that area I knew that was on my map right so outside that area and before the fortifications +...
what is now obviously &=laughs parts of fashionable Paris .
&=laughs:S5 &-um so he sees so Willms sees &-um Haussmann as a much more complicated figure .
also a kind of &-um urban planner with a vision .
&-um but someone who took control very seriously and didn't try to take control where &-um one either &-um new neighborhoods couldn't be constructed for whatever reason you know the Benjamin argument is so that civil unrest could not take place in those neighborhoods but the other reason would be to rehabilitate the sort_of Haussmannian take would be to rehabilitate those neighborhoods to make them sanitary .
&-um what other kinds of &-um +...
laws were put into place ?
that made it possible for him to gain this control &~s &-um and I'm thinking specifically financial (0.5) what is this &~lu what is it called here ?
the &-um +...
the one hundred and eighty million +/.
+, I just +//.
I love when they have laws that have these great names in them the a hundred and eighty million franc rule .
&=laughs where did that go ?
(0.5) okay .
here we go .
on page two sixty eight .
he starts talking about Willms starts talking about &-um the suspicion for the strategic objectives of this .
and Haussmann's first argument was always +//.
and this is in the middle of the page was that the sole purpose was for quote &{l=READING the large thoroughfares designed by his majesty &}l=READING which were to quote &{l=READING rehabilitate the old part of the city and open it up to traffic .
&}l=READING okay ?
so while it was not very convincing < it actually > he was &~al able to continue to build and construct and demolish based on that very simple notion of rehabilitation .
and opening up to traffic opening up to circulation &-um allowing for &-um increased obviously commodity circulation and things like that .
and &-um he had three basically three projects going .
right ?
the first project was with this was with &-um the state .
right ?
the state was gonna give him one third of the construction money sixty million francs to do a large portion of the construction .
the second part was &-uh projects that were gonna be financed by the city and the state .
so the &~reha part +//.
mostly rehabilitation .
&-um and then the third part was was just gonna be paid for by the city .
and that was this developing of the central stars which if you look on that map +//.
and we talk about control .
I mean you can see the development of the stars &-um both on that map that we looked at before with the exterior boulevards and the fortification you can see the stars but also on the on &-um the map the later the three pages away the David Pinkney which also shows the extent of the Boulevards and the stars .
I mean that in in a sense is a kind of panoptic view of street control .
right ?
that hierarchizes that space that articulates a space right ?
that should have more meaning more importance than other sort_of square corners .
or &~sq you know square intersections .
so it hierarchizes &-um it creates &-um arterial movement movement along the axis but it also in a sense creates more power more control for those areas .
&-um Etoile which is by &-um the Eiffel Tower and Nation +...
&-er I'm sorry Arc_De_Triomphe is at the Etoile .
&+et Trocadero is the Eiffel Tower so you can see how he's already imagining or thinking of other ways of controlling rather than just through finance .
alright ?
it's this visual control .
what are some of the other arguments that &-um Willms makes for Haussmann's project ?
I mean I talked a little bit about real estate speculation but how is that real estate speculation &-um ultimately very important for what we know now as Paris ?
I mean in a sense Willms sets us up to accept Haussmann (un)til now .
right ?
to the Paris that we have now .
(0.5) &-um I'm thinking mostly about the stuff on page like two seventy the bottom of two seventy one two seventy two .
(0.34) .
in a sense it's a process by which the expropriation of &-um the the houses that belong to lower classes is the that land is used to build &-um constructions that would attract the &-um the bourgeoisie .
that +/.
right .
+, that that that was in accordance with their appearance .
+, mhm +/.
+, so so it generated a a movement &=cough excuse_me of the people of the social classes within the the city .
mhm .
movement and if you have those big bourgeois buildings apartment buildings backing up to these very small pockets which are left of those working class neighborhoods you not only create movement but also a kind of proximity that had never existed before .
right ?
&-um a kind of proximity that in some ways Baudelaire becomes very distinctly aware of .
&-um at the same time and this is the kind of irony that I believe Mister_Willms &-uh misses is that in the development of this these buildings &-um which were designed primarily for sort_of bourgeois I'll quote &{l=READING bourgeois needs and expectations .
&}l=READING were that they themselves very much under Haussmann's controlling and and orderliness .
even though he wasn't the actual builder of those &-um apartments because every single apartment <if you> if you see here every single apartment is the same .
except for obviously some are a little bit larger but those parts that are larger are still like in these dark hallways in the backs of the buildings .
so everyone has like a front window on the street but from the outside the facades are completely uniform .
so there's a kind of uniformity within both the exterior and the interior .
so in a sense the the the extent to which Haussmann is responsible for &-um both regulating the working class disrupting those neighborhoods sending people out to the suburbs is also he's also responsible for a kind of &~regula &~w what is the word that <I'm us > like regularizing +/.
mhm +/.
+, &~regu not just regulation but a kind of regularizing of also the bourgeois lifestyle .
right ?
in these little buildings with the same I mean the difference between carved stone and glued on stone is what we're talking about .
these are all just sort of glued on decorative neoclassical mass produced pieces of &-uh architectural facade that get put on these buildings .
&-um ⌊ yeah ⌋ .
⌈ he also sort_of ⌉ attributes that conformity to &-um the fact that like Haussmann and &-um the emperor were basically just sort_of in bed with the same five real estate companies right ?
yes +/.
+, so if you only have five companies making all of &-uh the apartment buildings in Paris they're obviously gonna look pretty much the same .
mhm right +...
and the the the &-um the parts of the city that don't get changed that don't really get &-um they don't experience any upheaval either with the real estate market speculation or demolition are these neighborhoods in the sixteenth and seventeenth arrondissement which are the what Willms called the refuges of the rich .
so the pockets of the aristocracy never get touched .
and yet as as you point out Filipe there's &~als there's a potential though for movement of the very wealthy and upper bourgeois classes to these new apartment buildings .
right ?
on like the Champs Elysees and and various parts of &-um mostly the right bank .
&-um but really those pockets still stay stay the same .
and in fact have remained the same to this day .
another thing there is I don't know exactly how that works but but I thought it was interesting the way that all those &-um new apartments had like the the side that faced the the street was the living room and the dining room and so in a sense like the the everyday life is also uniformed in its relation of the public and private areas .
right +...
right yeah and I think that that would be another way in &~wh which in fact goes along with some of what we saw in that film The City last night .
with the planned cities and towns &-um that there's a regularization of the everyday life .
and I hadn't actually thought about it in terms of space but you're right .
that everyone ends up in some ways in those apartments with the same sort_of +...
both the same public and private space and recognition of it +...
which Willms doesn't &~s I mean I I tend to critique that kind of uniformity planned uniformity &-uh but Willms doesn't seem to do that .
because I think he sees Haussmann as you pointed out at the end as this sort_of great &-um transformer a great planner +...
so &-um let's I think +...
take a break .
and when we come back we'll &-um +...
do maybe some close readings of the Baudelaire with the Berman and knowing what you know about Haussmann and maybe tease out &-um a reading &-um of especially the I mean The Eyes of the Poor but I also tend to like The Rope for instance &-um myself .
&-uh or any other poems .
that sound good ?
and obviously if you have more to say about Haussmann I mean you're welcome .
and then we'll talk about some of the films .
okay .
so break .
I have to run over to Rackham to get some papers so just wait for me if I'm running a little late &=laughs (0.11) .

so you need a copy of the +/.
⌈ of the the Marshall Berman ⌉ +/.

okay let's xxx .
that history book that you brought into &-uh four hundred level class .
let me think .
I think I already know this mess .
it starts at &-uh .
okay .
xxx .
some some people .
yes .
some people I know have applied for it .
oh really ?
yeah .
from my department .
okay so I wanna return this to you .
this is so cool .
you like it ?
+, someday I'll have to spend much more time with it .
(be)cause it is amazing that notion of the skin .
mhm .
you know I been walking around all day tapping and I in fact have a tack in the bottom of my shoe .
&=laughs:multiple everyone thought I was trying to be Gene Kelly .
&=laughs xxx it's gonna stay there nope xxx .
mkay so here we go Baudelaire (0.9) Baudelaire in Films .
Marshall Berman Baudelaire in Films +...
okay let's see here .
(0.5) .
Willms xxx (0.17) .
I was trying to figure out why I knew the title of that book .
&=laughs:multiple it's like <I know> I know that from somewhere .
&=laughs:multiple .
xxx each article .
<where do I know that from> ?
yeah it's &-uh +...
it's a famous book .
okay .
so I mean I &~a guess I asked a really sort_of general question about Baudelaire and &-um Berman and Haussmann .
so +...
we can kind_of take this up from various different points but I thought that at least with +...
I guess The Pauper's Toy works also quite well in this discussion as does The Eyes of the Poor .
but maybe if we start with The Eyes of the Poor from Spleen just take the eyes of the poor and rip (th)em out_of the spleen .
&-um &=laughs:multiple we can sort_of maybe engage in this (0.4) discussion of both Berman Haussmann Baudelaire and Benjamin .
if we can .
kind_of a tall order .
(0.22) okay so you want to know why I hate you today ?
&=laughs (0.7) even if you haven't read I guess the Berman &-um and so you don't know whether you agree or disagree with his reading of The Eyes of the Poor maybe we can talk about the presence of the Haussmannized Paris in The Eyes of the Poor .
maybe that would be one way to start +...
well there's the vision of the &-um let's see what does it say ?
the &-um this third paragraph that first sentence there .
&-um when it's talking about &-uh ses@s:fra splendeurs@s:fra inachevees@s:fra &-uh and just the pile of the pile of rubble as sort_of a remnant of the Haussmannization of &-um of Paris paralleled then with &-um the the poor les@s:fra les@s:fra pauvres@s:fra xxx (0.6) .
so it's not and it's not just the sort_of unfinished splendor it's also right ?
the &~bre in that same beginning of that same paragraph +/.
mhm +/.
+, the brand new cafe +/.
+, mhm yeah ⌈ there's a juxtaposition ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ on the corner of the new ⌋ boulevard right .
between all of the wonders and the unfinishedness of it .
mhm .
and just the detail that he goes into of what's inside .
kinda the the the les@s:fra deesses@s:fra portant@s:fra sur@s:fra leurs@s:fra tetes@s:fra des@s:fra fruits@s:fra etcetera all that is just so &~b &~b &~b gaudy and you know there's so much +/.
campy +/.
+, that it's &~ki campy there you go .
+, that's what Berman says +/.
+, yes .
&=laughs:multiple yeah it's just &-um very overwhelming to see that you know in contrast with a pile of of rubble .
what're the other words besides gaudy ?
campy that would be of_course our reading of it .
mhm +/.
+, they didn't have campy back then yet .
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um what &~abou what about in the French ?
do you have goinfrerie@s:fra ?
do you have that in the French ?
+, mhm .
+, right .
how does it +//.
what does that translate as ?
gluttony .
gluttony .
right .
so gaudy gluttony what else ?
⌈ decadent ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and then I want you +//.
⌋ yeah ?
decadent .
decadent .
very busy too there's I don't know but when I read that I just everything &-um there's sort_of an underlying theme of movement .
mhm +/.
+, to me +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, it's just that the way that the statues you know had their arms out or whatever .
I think also &-um since I always harp on the classical &=laughs:SUf &-um that final line the all history and all mythology at the command of gluttony .
oh yeah +/.
+, &-um when I was reading Berman and on one forty eight he says &~a describing what are the primal modern scenes he says that &{l=READING those <are experienced in> joys from the concrete everyday of Bonaparte and Haussmann's Paris by carrying mythic resonance and depth <of the problem> into their place and +//.
beyond their place and time and transform them into archetypes of modern life .
&}l=READING &-um I was trying to think of I mean we encounter this idea of myth in everything we've read so far today .
you know and it seems to be central .
and this myth of modernity the myth of postmodernity the myth of premodernity all of it's a myth .
and so this here in the cafe I think is just you know bringing the myth into the everyday life .
and what &~i why is it that every time we encounter the everyday we have to go directly from that into a myth ?
and because that's how I see this functioning .
you know rather blatantly .
and this by having the nymphs and the goddesses and Ganymede &-um all inside a cafe which is supposedly the the primal scene of modernity Baudelaire here .
and also to the poor because they look in at least the family of the poor in the in this poem because they look in and think how beautiful you know if only we could enter .
but people like us can't enter this house .
so there's something about the exclusion from the myth of of modernity or or some kind_of a participation in it and <I don't know> +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, &~i I ran out_of steam there at the end .
but I do think that that's supposed to be what's highlighted .
mhm .
mhm .
also I think the idea of &-um being able to have privacy in a public space <is a> &~r is a result of the Haussmannization of of Paris these two lovers can sit at a table and and have their privacy but yet they're in a space that &-um you know that anyone can walk into +/.
mhm +/.
+, <and in the poem someone does> and that's basically what Berman says .
(0.9) .
&-um the description of the cafe also reflects a_lot_of what Baudelaire &-um seems fascinated by modernity with you know it sparkles &-um it's bright it's eblouissante@s:fra &~etince@s:fra etincele@s:fra he says &-um I'm sure it goes back to the first part of the reading we did for Berman where he talks about how Baudelaire is just fascinated by everything that's new and &-um glitters .
and among those new things are all these classic tropos@s:fra that are brought into the spaces part of the commercial exchange for now like part of the display you know the you know +...
the idea of being able to see at night too because of the gas lights +/.
mhm +/.
+, is important in this piece .
it helps highlight the material and the you know the the material world inside of the cafe .
(0.5) and all those people you know there's more the issue of safety as well .
&-um so that more people are just gonna be out now in the public space .
because they can see at night .
(0.8) .
so that those elements that we brought up earlier about movement and proximity &-um sort_of explode in this encounter .
mhm .
and explode <in a> in a particular way here because like the the way Willms <Willms what's his> &=laughs &-um presented it was like the the bourgeoisie was was hiding the the poverty right ?
mhm +/.
+, and this time it's like the poverty looking at the bourgeoisie from from the front from the front <from the> from the outside to the inside using those windows those (0.6) it's &=laughs it's like a moment when when what what is what was tried to keep from seeing starts seeing itself +/.
+, yeah mhm +/.
+, starts disturbing that privacy that you were talking about before .
(0.6) .
it also kind of reminded me of &-um I think it's Mary Louise Pratt who talks about the contact zone ?
is it her ?
hm ?
+, you know like the boulevard as a contact zone then &-uh whereas it isn't really &-um the colonizer the colonized that's that's making contact but &-um the bourgeoisie and then the working class .
&-um and that would sort_of work with what you were saying Susan in that it's not just you know black and white it's there's sort_of an exchange going on there you know where &-um are they being excluded from the myth or are they looking in and trying to be a part of it ?
or .
but yet there's no real interaction between them .
you know people looking in and the people looking out +/.
mhm +/.
+, their you know the father's eyes were saying he wasn't actually saying this is what this guy looking out this xxx <thing that he's> saying .
+, mhm +/.
+, and then &-um I mean there's no real +//.
you don't have any idea really what these people were thinking <as they> as they looked in .
they could've been thinking you know this is +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, &-um what happened when Paris was torn down they might have been condemning it <we don't> we don't have any idea if they wanna be <in the> xxx or or not .
yeah there was a part in the Berman article too that you know when they were when he describes the the the pauvres@s:fra and he says you know they wanna be part of they look in and they wanna be part of it .
but that may I didn't get that at all from reading the poem I didn't think that they necessarily wanted to be a part of that inside world .
&-um oh and I can't find it now .
but what about when &-um the eyes of the father say says &-um <que@s:fra c'est@s:fra beau@s:fra> que@s:fra c'est@s:fra beau@s:fra or c'est@s:fra une@s:fra maison@s:fra ou@s:fra peuvent@s:fra seuls@s:fra entrer@s:fra les@s:fra gens@s:fra qui@s:fra ne@s:fra sont@s:fra pas@s:fra come@s:fra nous@s:fra ?
⌈ xxx people ⌉ .
⌊ yeah but I still ⌋ I don't know I I didn't get that that &~lon sense longing necessarily +/.
mhm +/.
+, I just got this sort_of ⌈ I just saw (th)em as observers and +//.
yeah ⌉ .
⌊ a sense of exclusion like they just ⌋ they just realize that they're excluded +/.
mhm +/.
+, they don't particularly want +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, want to be part of it .
they're just sort of observing and giving their commentary on it but you know they &~d they don't try to go in they don't you know lament that they they can't they they just look .
mhm +/.
+, you know and and who wouldn't at that time period I mean that's a new scene you you've never seen something like that .
&-um so I don't know <I didn't really> I didn't really agree with Berman in that respect .
+, ⌈ <you think that> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that they ⌋ so desperately want .
so it's the xxx with the coffee house assignment .
because just as I was looking out at people you know &=laughs:SUf that glass was there and I would see them and for a split second we would see each_other and so I could say you know oh obviously they're thinking you know I want a cup of coffee or +//.
I have no idea what they're thinking .
you know and that's just kind_of what I view this as that what they +//.
what I imagine them thinking ultimately says more about me than about them .
and that's what ⌈ happens ⌉ +/.
+, here .
yeah .
&-um Berman might be reading that the way he does based on that just that little signal that the but but only people not like us when the &~k +/.
mhm +/.
+, when kid says that that &-um what is it called ?
disjunctive or whatever ?
+, mhm +/.
+, &-uh kind_of points to maybe the fact that the father did wanna go in and the kid is saying no but ⌈ you're ⌉ .
⌊ didn't ⌋ wanna go in ?
⌈ or he did wanna go ⌉ .
⌊ maybe did ⌋ .
yeah like to side +//.

⌈ yeah ⌉ .

⌊ we can't go ⌋ .
right .
but maybe the father's already past the point of of even even &~wa like going in there &=laughs but the it's just the kid who is saying who is who's internalizing it on his own .
so we don't know you know like +/.
⌈ oh that's true <I hadn't> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ he could just be saying ⌋ to himself +/.
+, mhm +/.

but the dad's already past that point .
he's past the point of wanting because he knows he's not gonna get ⌈ in there so why why bother ?

⌊ but at the same time I mean we have no idea it is the poet that's like looking ⌋ &=laughs at him saying +/.
mhm +/.

I mean it is the right ?

yeah +/.
+, without +/.
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ without ⌋ the use of +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, words .
and then I think that's highlighted through the jarring juxtaposition of the last paragraph where you know this woman that he's supposedly in love with he can't read her eyes and he's shocked when he finds out what she's thinking .
&=laughs:multiple and then says how difficult it is to understand one another .
and how uncommunicable thought is .
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you ⌋ know I think that should signal to us right away that we don't know what these people are thinking .
mhm .
yeah exactly .
yeah that's right .
(0.7) .
&-um I just had a &~sm minor question about the form of the +//.
of all these poems really .
&-um Berman has stated on one forty eight then that it is crucial to remember that the poems in Paris Spleen do not present themselves as verse +/.
mhm +/.
+, an established art form but as prose in the format of news .
and .
where is that ?
sorry .
&-uh one forty eight .
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-um ⌋ didn't Baudelaire hate the newspaper ?
&=laughs:multiple I mean wasn't that one of his ?
and so I wondered why he would write something like that .
+, yeah well &-uh because what he's doing is what Berman is doing is extending the notion of the feuilleton@s:fra .
+, okay .
+, which &~wa those little sort_of opinion pieces .
if you look +//.
I should have just typed ⌈ out some of ⌉ .
⌊ I should've read the thing so ⌋ &=laughs .
no that's okay .
but I should've hijacked &-um some of Margie's work (be)cause as I was saying before &~i Margie in in Wilder in comp lit has &-um &~photogra &-uh photocopies <of the> &~f of the like the front page of these newspapers from this time .
and there's always like the news and then a line on the front page and then this like opinion piece or observation piece very much like &~Bart Barthes was writing those mythology pieces from the fifties in in &-um Le Monde those are just sort of that same style &-um we don't really have a tradition in the +//.
in American papers we have the op-ed page .
but there's no real tradition of &-um I mean there's a tradition of the news oh is it the syndicated sort_of news discussant ?
I don't even know what to call them anymore .
do you know what I mean ?
you know like the &~K you know the Hamblin the all those I can't think of their names right now (be)cause I'm blanking .
entirely .
&=laughs on their names .
&-um what the hell are they called ?
&-um syndicated journalists ?
mhm .
that sounds good .
mhm .
yeah .
commentators ?
&=laughs can't remember what they're called but &=laughs:multiple those people .
that's what we have here .
but the feuilleton@s:fra .
so what what &-um what he's doing is making this it's not roughly equivalent to the op-ed piece I mean I think that's not quite right but &-um so he's he's actually taking just the the fact of these things running in the newspaper .
oh okay +/.
+, to say then that they're in the format of news .
yet he's kind_of +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, pushing the definition of feuilleton@s:fra .
okay .
columnists .
columnists .
syndicated columnists .
syndicated columnists .
xxx take me a minute but I got there .
&=laughs:S1 &=laughs okay &-um right .
so that's what he says there .
&-um but obviously it is true that by not writing in an established art form he can kind_of get away with a_lot more freedom in what he's in what he wants to talk about in his observations .
just as in general .
(0.4) so (0.4) how else is Haussmann's Paris present here ?
I think to get to the point about talking about the narrator realizing how uncommunicable thought is and yet he's just gone through and given us what he thinks reading the eyes (be)cause of_course he believes he can read eyes &-um and sort_of saying what the poor what he believes the poor <might be> might be thinking of saying .
but what about his relationship to this woman ?
I mean that's one of the interesting points that I think Berman tries to flesh out but I don't know if it's satisfactory .
(0.15) .
suggests something that &-um let me just double check (be)cause now I'm not sure .
I think it suggests that &-um that <he could> he could be could be her ?
mhm +/.
+, yeah ?
okay .
and &-um and I I don't know I I I would tend to agree with with this especially with because of that my thoughts my thought there in like in the in italics there and &-um and also because he's addressing her at the beginning telling her that he hates her but &-uh after this that happened days before but they are still together right ?
like he's still talking to her and it's that gives me the idea more that that that they're like two sides of the of a single &~con conscience .
so they are actually what he says at the beginning .
you know that we had promised ourselves that day that we would be two halves of the same soul .
⌈ right ⌉ ?
⌊ same ⌋ .
yeah that's it .
I think that's a possible reading .
that's why he hates her because he did actually see his own thoughts in her eyes .
mhm +...
mhm .
(0.6) .
right so there's .
and applied to the Haussmannization of Paris it would be like that conscience of Paris that has been &-um attacked by two fronts or that it is now composed of two juxtaposed sides .
(0.8) .
two juxtaposed sides that &-um are now proximate .
yeah +/.
+, are now near each_other .
mhm .
and dangerously near .
&=laughs .
mhm right .
though he does say that that there is no hostile undertone in in the way they they look at them .
mhm .
(0.32) does anyone else wanna tease anything else out_of that poem ?
(0.6) .
I just had a quick question .
on the bottom of page eighty three when it says cette@s:fra famille@s:fra d'yeux@s:fra is that supposed to be sort_of a word playish type thing on Dieu@s:fra as well ?
yes ?
&=laughs:multiple I don't know .
okay .
I'll toss a coin .
oh: .
I don't +//.
I just I Dieu@s:fra .
it could work I mean if he's elevating this family .
which paragraph ?
&-uh .
the very last line on page eighty three .
yeah .
well I xxx .
oh ⌈ oh okay ⌉ .
⌊ oh ⌋ .
⌈ that's why &-um ⌉ .
it starts with &-um les@s:fra chansonniers@s:fra .

⌈ and then the +//.
⌉ yeah and the last line .
oh <no no> no no no not even &-um the sentence is non@s:fra seulement@s:fra j'ai@s:fra attendri@s:fra .
&-um xxx .
famille@s:fra d'yeux@s:fra +/.
mhm mhm +/.
+, okay .
mhm .
so I I'm sorry I need to look at this for a second <I am curious> .
you said famille@s:fra d'yeux@s:fra ?
oh I see what you're saying Dieu@s:fra .
right .
took me a minute there .
&=laughs:S1 &-um .
coulda been clearer too .
no no I don't have the French in front of me I left my book at home .
&-um yeah famille@s:fra d'yeux@s:fra I don't know that's a good question .
(be)cause I saw this being a a poem very much between the narrator and les@s:fra yeux@s:fra des@s:fra pauvres@s:fra and not the narrator and this woman .
so she +//.
I just saw that as sort_of Baudelaire needed a situation &-um for the narrator to be in so he could see so he could have this experience .
and it just okay .
and that's why +//.
and it ended up working really well &-um but I didn't really see it as a central part of the text .
right with the woman .
right .
well I think when I initially read it I did but then because I &~w I actually in a sense agree with the reading of Berman that it's actually him struggling with himself and the side that he actually can't struggle with is the the feminine side this impermeable side .
mhm +/.
+, which is very interesting in terms of Baudelaire who's &-um you can read more about that in Leo Bersani .
about Baudelaire's problem with women or this femininity .
&-um that he perceived as &-uh utterly impenetrable impermeable .
so &-um +...
I think I mean for me personally I read this as someone who is both incredibly egotistical but also at a point where he's actually conflicted about what he sees in front of him .
he has a conscience .
&-um &~s so I mean at &~a at a certain point &-um at the bottom of the paragraph on page one fifty four in the Berman he says &-um it just is so (be)cause he's he just does the reading about the man who hates that part of himself .
&{l=READING maybe the deepest split is not between the narrator and his love but within the man himself .
if this is so it shows us how the contradictions that animate the modern city street resonate in the inner life of the man on the street .
&}l=READING so &-um on the one hand I agree that it's the relationship between him and these people he sees that brings out the conflict in him but &-um you know the woman there is used to be kind of this other half of him .
mhm +/.
+, which is you know very I mean I'll say very Baudelairian whatever that means .
+, mhm +/.
+, but .
⌊ are you ⌋ .
⌈ &-um oh ⌉ sorry .
are you &~s suggesting a a link between the narrator and the street ?
is that what I'm hearing ?
or am I just .
a link between the narrator and .
the street like the conflictedness of the narrator <is enlarged to the half finished half rubble> .
are &~y were you saying that or am I just hearing you differently ?
I'm saying that he is feeling conflict based on what he sees in the street .
oh okay .
+, or or you know in this this new +/.
+, mhm ⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ these ⌉ these issues of new proximity .
these new relations new new encounters that can happen in the city .
alright .
when Berman says that that in the &~re &~m &-uh in the barricades they could be at different on different sides I would yeah I would see that I would say that here at least it's presented that way because &-uh because the poor and the narrator are all talking through their eyes only right ?
whereas the the woman or that feminine side is who's shown with different kinds of eyes because her eyes are like almost perverse &=laughs in the way +/.
right +/.
+, he presents them .
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um she uses her mouth .
she's the one that actually uses her mouth to talk right ?
+, mhm +/.
+, it's like a differentiation there of the senses .
mhm .
(0.6) .
just going back to your &-um word play very quickly .
you know that would also work &=laughs:S4 if you see what comes after it .
because then he says that &-um he he felt ashamed like right in front of this famille@s:fra d'yeux@s:fra you know .
and he uses the word honteux@s:fra which is something you know that you could use in a religious context .
you know who do you feel ashamed in front of ?
God right ?
mm .
right .
(0.5) I mean I I think that this +...
I don't know if anyone's written on famille@s:fra d'yeux@s:fra but &-um what it reminds me of is Baudelaire's fascination with windows .
and being able to look through the window and read a scene .
&-um and instead of like a &~nar you know a narrator &-um in &~s in some of the other poems we read in Les_Fleurs_Du_Mal it's the narrator reading scenes through a window but there's never any other external interaction .
so I &~actu I mean so while I argued before that the the sort_of central figures of the poem are the man and these people actually to also have that encounter with the woman is central to both the issues that you brought up of the privacy <put in> put in public display .
but that the couples are +//.
the couple together are as another kind of family are the ones on display .
right ?
and that it's not the poor the old the decrepit that that Baudelaire's narrators often see when they look into a window .
mhm +/.
+, you know it's not the old woman it's not the widow it's not the prostitute it's actually &~he I mean you had said there's a kind of reversal here .
when you initially started talking about it and I think that that's right .
pointing to &-um Baudelaire's kind_of &~f fascination with the look .
and all of +//.
here much more complex than in some of his earlier some of his earlier work .
<in the> in the earlier works like his windows were more like that kind of I don't know what it's called like mirror window or something like +/.
mhm +/.
+, it's only you can only see one way +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, but in this one it's transparent on on both sides .
+, right .
+, it's &-uh it's a wall but at the same time it permits communication .
right +...
only our man doesn't really wanna communicate .
&=laughs:S6 (0.4) what about you you mentioned that notion of the barrier being on both sides of the barrier that works really well in relationship to the other poem The Toy +/.
mhm +/.
+, The Pauper's Toy +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, in terms of the barrier .
and &-um I said The Rope &-um which is my favorite which doesn't really deal with barrier but &-um so maybe we'll talk about The Pauper's Toy and then go back to &-um The Rope just to say a few things about it .
&-um .
actually could I +/.
yes +/.
+, can I get one last or ask one last question ?
⌊ &-um ⌋ .
⌈ please ⌉ continue I stopped that conversation I didn't mean to .
⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ oh no ⌉ it's okay I was just wondering .
isn't it kinda strange though that &-um this like meeting or like clash between like the classes occurs ?
because of when I think of Haussmannization I think of like the separation right ?
so that they've parcelled out the city and they separated the classes so that they don't hafta see each_other as much anymore .
&-um you know you think of the the big boulevard and the good cafes being on one part of town where they can enjoy themselves without having to go through this guilty process of looking at the masses .
yes ?
so is this sort_of like a transitional phase when it's happening but so they can sit in their cafes but you know they still have to go through sort_of like the annoying experience of feeling this guilt ?
or .
well if you remember part of Haussmann's project was to &-um decimate in his words rehabilitate the poor neighborhoods .
mhm +/.
+, and he built those boulevards but in building the boulevards the the real estate speculators came in and they put in those those bourgeois houses so for instance I'm gonna draw this on the board .
I mean this is not exact but &-um say you would have these like pockets of neighborhoods of working class neighborhoods .
you know like that .
and you know Haussmann just came and just basically blasted through like that .
+, mhm +/.
+, broke up the most insidious sort_of &-uh well what he saw was insidious were working class &-um neighborhoods of strife .
but then obviously like this pocket is still here so on so what they would do is they would line the boulevards with these bourgeois apartments which were the same .
so you actually have where you would have had the bourgeois in their own separate neighborhoods +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, you actually have this kind of proximity which never existed before .
+, mhm +/.
+, and so with the speculation the real estate speculation you end up with you know so all of this is basically out .
but you have pockets so you would actually end up with like cafes on these corners that actually are both part of the bourgeois neighborhood and the working class neighborhoods .
so you ended up with these really interesting strange little pockets but because one of Haussmann's I mean actually in &~hi &~d in his favor he did not reveal where he &~w where his plan was going next .
because he didn't want real estate speculation to take over .
I mean to his credit I guess one could say that he knew that with the the &~d demolition of those neighborhoods he would be providing the space in which these bourgeois apartments could be going up .
didn't he also not give out the whole plan right away (be)cause he didn't think it would be accepted (be)cause it was gonna cost so much and ⌊ be so huge and ⌋ .
⌈ well right ⌉ .
right I mean there's that too .
right +/.
+, I mean one could say he did it out_of wariness .
Willms says he does it because he realized that the the the problems of speculation +/.
+, mm +/.
+, &-um sorta like insider trading he would be he would be he would be vilified if if that sort of got out .
+, so those +//.
I'm sorry go ahead .
also wasn't like the &-uh stated objectives to open up the city +/.
mhm +/.
+, to all of its inhabitants ?
whatever probably <everyone ⌊ wouldn't> ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.

+, mhm +/.

⌊ mhm mhm ⌋ .
yeah .
mhm .
and in a sense they're &=cough excuse_me .
they're always there also because +/.
mhm +/.
+, because that those are the ruins <that he> that he sees that can also see &~ou outside this they are all reminiscent of the +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, of those poor neighborhoods .
ruins yeah of a different sort .
yeah .
right .
I mean they could be actually read as the the newest class of homelessness .
mhm +/.
+, newest class of homeless Parisians .
+, uhuh +/.
+, and I always imagine that when they're staring in the cafe they're thinking oh bread food .
&=laughs you know .
&-um and so that that notion that &-um they would be seeing beauty actually also points to that he reads <in their> in their eyes beauty points back to Haussmann's beautification plan .
+, mhm +/.
+, right ?
he was part of Haussmann's plan was about beautifying the city .
+, makeup +/.
+, using these new perspectives what ?
makeup &=laughs:multiple .
yeah makeup right .
right .
&-um exactly .
perhaps they could also be when they looked inside they could also be &=laughs &-um &=laughs I don't know if I'm stretching this too far &=laughs but they could also be thinking about like this was our home .
this used to be our home .
right ?
yeah right .
right .
and look at the gaudiness that has taken over +/.
mhm +/.
+, you know what used to be our living room .
&=laughs:multiple .
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ much better ⌋ as a shack .
&=laughs:multiple right .
right .
I mean we talked +//.
I mean I'm gonna sort_of get off the topic just for one second before we go to The Pauper story but &-um one of the clips from the film last night &-um I love that clip of like the happy living the filthy city living and I'll show you that clip again when we talk talk about it .
but &-um I was reminded when I was a kid in the &~nin early nineteen seventies houses were destroyed in our the village I lived in to put in a highway .
because through various federal programs and taxation programs little towns could group together and help finish highways .
so this highway that was constructed between the city of Rochester and the little town I lived in was paid for along the way by three little towns .
and they just like wrecked these beautiful old homes that &~p most people lived in .
and most of the people who lived in those homes were &-um the working class .
but they were old &~ho sort_of large old homes .
and many of them had like tons of kids or they were elderly .
and they basically just through eminent domain the the city or at that point the town maybe the state bought the houses from the people for about thirteen thousand dollars which was market value .
and the only homes that any of those people could afford were mobile homes in the next county .
right ?
so I mean that kind of displacement is is the kind of displacement that we're talking about here .
but for in Haussmann's time most the people are renters so they get nothing .
right their homes are just basically destroyed and they have to find housing elsewhere .
so even with the notion of eminent domain and fair market value there's no real compensation that can be that can be given .
well for Haussmann it would be the jobs that were created would be the minimal sort_of compensation you'd get .
right .
+, we'll kick you out but you can work where &~yo you can help build this thing that is gonna cover your old home &=laughs .
yeah yeah &=end_first_tape/_BEGIN_SECOND_TAPE .
so &=laughs ah The Pauper's Toy .
&=laughs:S1 I like to talk about this one &-um in fact actually maybe we'll talk about this and instead of talking about The Rope we'll go to clips from the film because this actually does that really interesting juxtaposition here of_course poetically and in the film visually but &-um I I &~re I think that it &~ki it'll work out .
I mean we can talk about sort of montage &-um in relationship to these prose poems and and the films .
so &-um the presence of Haussmann in this poem (0.7) .
well again the proximity .
just <we're already on that> .
mhm .
right the possibility for proximity because of those boulevards that now go out to this this this kind_of a neighborhood .
it's still part of the city but just outside right ?
&-um homes with gardens .
(0.25) how (a)bout the juxtaposition that we saw in The Eyes of the Poor ?
is there a &~si a similar juxtaposition occurring here ?
&=cough excuse_me (0.9) .
yeah I think so .
mhm +/.
+, yes because +/.
+, ⌈ in what ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ he talks about ⌋ talks about the symbolic bars separating two words two worlds .
right exactly .
okay ?
and what's behind one set of bars ?
a rich kid and his fancy toy .
right .
&-um right the kid and the toy sort_of similarly on display .
&-um and then on the other side of the grate this is that sort of dialectical movement that keeps that that Benjamin talks about that Berman talks about on the other side &{l=READING not in the garden but amidst thistles nettles &}l=READING &=laughs &-um you have you don't have the whiteness of a pretty castle you have the dirty puny grimy child .
(0.4) and so it's not just a distinction in the children but then it becomes a distinction of +//.
in the toys .
mhm +/.
+, right ?
so the immobility of the one toy &-um the shiny &~i the shininess the spiffiness <of the> of the doll like the kid in comparison to the toy in the box which of_course is a .
rat .
rat .
why the fascination though by the rich kid ?
(0.5) .
well maybe he's I mean depending on you know how he's been raised and what not maybe he's never come into contact with a rat so he doesn't &~ha think you know necessarily these negative connotations that people tend to have tend to associate with rats .
but also I mean it's alive .
it's something that's living .
and it moves .
and his toy doesn't move .
but this kid's toy moves .
right +/.
+, you know ?
so when they say he's greedily inspecting a rare and unknown object how how is his class set up against I mean he they're &~u obviously Baudelaire's using this toy but how is class ?
I mean what're the words that denote him and his class just in that little why greedy ?
(0.4) &~ho why is the rat rare and unknown ?
I mean &~w what are those terms what is the connotation of the &~ter those terms ?
it's exotic .
it's all about commodities .
and &-um like the ephemerality of the commodity because the thing that was bought with a_lot_of money is thrown by the wayside for this thing plucked out_of plucked out_of life extracted the toy from life itself &-um is that which gains attention .
and you have to consume it because you're not you know who knows when this kid's gonna see it again ?
(0.8) .
you wanna add something ?
no I'll wait .
&=laughs:multiple well okay if nobody else has anything to add &=laughs:multiple +/.
go ahead .
+, I'm just curious about this whole &~romiticent romanticization of childhood &-um where you know in the cafe these adults the father <and the> &-um and the two people inside the cafe they looked at each_other but what their gaze is directed to is the opulence .
you know the children &-uh I don't know if they're supposed to be &~eth &~un &~o supposed to seem more untouched by these forces at work so they look towards the rat instead of the shiny toy .
you know &-um and we see that in the films where children are the hope you know and and when we focus on the the New England village it's all about the kid running around with his dog &-um this is so romanticized and so +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, seen as the innocence and the two children latched to each_other fraternally +/.
+, oh yeah +/.
+, with teeth of equal whiteness &-um &=laughs:S4 I was &~jus I'm just curious about that and how you guys read it and what you think should be made of it .
because we also get the references to childhood from the earlier articles <I think it> was it Benjamin who wrote them ?
who wrote about modernity in childhood ?
or De_Certeau ?
De_Certeau well +/.
De_Certeau +/.
+, what both Benjamin and De_Certeau talk about experiencing modernity as a child .
+, right yeah +/.
+, as childlike experience .
the newness of it .
the excitement of it .
yeah so I was thinking that it hadta relate somehow to that but I'm not sure exactly how .
(0.13) .
yeah I don't know but but it's very interesting +/.
yeah +/.
+, especially because &-uh like the way that discourse of childhood as a future and modernity as a future come together right ?
+, mhm +/.
+, and they become like childhood (be)cause modernity is the future .
(0.13) .
because he definitely imposes class on these kids .
you know we have the one who is lovely and the other you know the other categories of ordinary and poor .
which I think is really funny because the &~o poor children aren't ordinary .
but &-um I mean so there's something being imposed on them .
mhm .
maybe at this point they're too young to understand you know capitalism and and value that's placed on an object .
they just see the object for what it is .
you know they don't +/.
right +/.
+, they don't put prices on things yet so they're just looking at the actual thing .
and to them what's you know cooler is the rat .
&=laughs:S2 .
mhm .
when he says he looks at it greedily +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ he's ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ already ⌋ like insinuating there's this even if it he can't +//.
he cannot price it he's he's got the attitude already .
oh well yeah yeah I mean you're gonna be raised by your parents and you're gonna kinda pick up on that but I think he's still too young to really be like you know fully cognizant of you know capitalist ideas and what not .
at least at this point they their their teeth are still equally white .
yeah +/.
+, ⌈ but yeah ⌉ .
⌊ actually just I think that's ⌋ probably one of the least satisfying endings for a &=laughs:multiple Baudelaire poem I've ever read .
but I usually &-uh expect some sort of poeesque@n$adj ending you know +/.
mhm +/.
+, and you get that with the rat and they he just sort of has this sort_of like &{l=SIC disingenius@u &}l=SIC sort_of I don't know .
yeah .
yeah and their teeth were equally white .
&=laughs:multiple &-uh .
right and the +//.
but the whiteness +/.
mhm +/.
+, goes back to the whiteness of the pretty castle .
+, mhm +/.
+, right ?
so the white I mean that's &~f for me the that romanticization of childhood but that the whiteness itself which has already come up refers specifically to a kind of castle struck by the sun appeared in the background almost dreamlike .
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um and while I don't really know exactly how far I wanna go with that &-um it seems to me that their whiteness is such a weird word to come up in any case that to come up in those two ways it's as if the kid with the rat somehow meets the ideal dream world .
&-um but still of that you know meeting it but in that very romanticized way as is the whiteness of that castle .
mhm .
&-uh .
yeah .
the the rat in the box &-um struck me as similar to the surrealist &-um film where they're looking at the hand on the ground .
where you know it's what's grotesque but once you look at it in a different way it becomes fascinating .
mhm +/.
+, you know and just the fact that they would have this rat in a box and not have it you know not be staring at it as it runs around kind_of links it &~to towards that you know commodity and and changing perspective on it .
mhm .
you move it from its natural environment and then it ⌈ gains a value ⌉ .
⌊ exactly .

and that's what I was thinking about +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ when you ⌋ were saying the dreamscape and linking it to surrealism and all that .
mhm (0.12) .
yeah it is a very problematic I mean it does sort_of romanticize them and yet in one of the other poems that &-um you may or may not have read I believe I +//.
I believe it's the one right before it .
&-um which I'm +//.
xxx spending time on The Cake it's actually number fifteen so it wouldn't have been right before it .
that actually the kids are like little &-um they're like vicious fighting devouring &-um machines that they attack the bread .
oh don't they have griffes@s:fra ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ yes they have ⌋ right griffes@s:fra what is that ?
claws right ?
like an animal .
savagely fighting over a piece of bread .
(0.6) .
it's interesting too in the footnote footnote number two .
&-um &{l=READING l'idee@s:fra que@s:fra le@s:fra joujou@s:fra est@s:fra la@s:fra premiere@s:fra initiation@s:fra de@s:fra l'enfant@s:fra a@s:fra l'art@s:fra .
&}l=READING so it's interesting that they choose the rat you know the the the toy is an initiation to art and yet they choose that which is not manufactured .
oh: +...
and what do we do with the first two lines first two sentences &{l=READING I want to present an idea of an innocent entertainment <because there are> so few diversions that are not wicked ?
&}l=READING I didn't know how to link it to the rest .
well his innocent entertainment at least as I read it is buying these cheap toys .
oh so it's his own it's not the kid's entertainment ?
no I think it's the narrator's entertainment +...
oh okay .
does that make sense ?
he goes and buys &{l=READING when some morning you go &}l=READING +/.
right +/.
+, &{l=READING out buy these little toys and give them to kids along the way and see their reactions .
&}l=READING (0.4) and then gives one example of an event where he actually didn't even have to give a toy away .
&=laughs:multiple (0.4) the English is quite amazing because in that paragraph where the rich kid is greedily inspecting it like a rare and unknown object which I read as a kind of in the acquisition mode like you just said .
remove the rat from its natural &~envirent environment it makes a commodity of it .
actually he &~sp perceives it as a thing he does not have .
and therefore wants it .
he's already in the &-um acquisitional mode of the bourgeois parents .
right ?
and then seeing it as a rare and unknown object as if it were in fact a piece of art .
right ?
he's already ⌈ commodified it ⌉ .
⌊ do you think though ⌋ that he's I don't I think that's a kid thing to do .
not not a kid of bourgeois parents necessarily just that I don't have it I want it mom .
⌈ that could be ⌉ .

+, right .
+, one .
but I don't know because it depends really on how old these these kids are too .
you know I I &~me I don't +//.
well at least I don't really have a clear idea (be)cause if to me it makes a difference if they're five or &~perf or if they're eight .
&=laughs you know there's a difference to me .
so I don't +/.
+, yeah .
+, (be)cause developmentally they change so much so rapidly that when they're that young that you don't know psychologically what stage they're at yet and .
mhm .
well it's still I mean I still think that there is a kind of romanticization of childhood .
but one that's kind_of problematic and I mean we saw it in the films last night absolutely .
it's like when there is despair one can always fall back on the children .
children are the future .
you know and in that sense I mean this this this poem does that but obviously the &~w earlier ones don't and then &~th something like The Rope &=laughs:S6 where actually the piece of rope that the kid hangs himself with is commodified because a kid killed himself on it .
right ?
so there's this &~lu there's a kind of I mean I wanna read more irony in this Pauper's Toy but <I can't> I can't dig it out at the moment .
I can't you know flesh it out .
(0.5) so unlike I think the romanticized call to childhood as a chime of as a time of innocence that we saw in the pastoral vision of &-um of the films last night .
both in &-um Metropolis right ?
the man's heart is softened by the emotional hinge by seeing you know this beautiful blonde woman with these children .
and then of_course in The City which takes as its point of departure giving healthy sanitary conditions to children who are the future .
and as I said of_course the French doesn't you know kids are not the same .
kids are not viewed in the same way the &~romant you know the the the emotional hinge is &~th is the romance between the couple .
mhm +/.
+, &-um but &~th <it does> it does problematize Baudelaire .
you see it in Zola .
we'll see it in we'll see it in Le_Ventre_De_Paris .
&-um in oh that you see it in other Zola novels in other Balzac Hugo &-uh obviously the lost innocence of childhood lost .
death of a child .
those kind_of like (0.6) I should read more on this .
I mean I I don't know if anyone +//.
I've never really dug through kind of thematics@n of childhood in Baudelaire and my fear of_course would be that it would be very literal and therefore not very interesting .
but there might be something out there that actually tries to sort_of &-um get at those problems .
(be)cause most of Baudelaire's writing in this has this very ironic tone to it .
so so the disappointment maybe is some &~s that we feel in reading this is just either throwing us off the path derailing us in some way <from his> &~ir from his his sort_of his &~ironi I mean he calls these kids like little scum right ?
&~th the pariah &-um you know if it could wipe &~awe +//.
now he's talking about this .
&{l=READING impartial I might discover this kid is not so horrible if it could wipe away this repulsive patina of privation just as a connoisseur's eye detects an ideal painting beneath the coach maker's varnish .
&}l=READING you know a kind of you know I mean I'm using my voice to express a kind of irony there but I don't know .
and so why why would he choose the teeth and the whiteness as that space where they come together where they are equal right ?
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I mean that's ⌋ a puzzling question .
&=laughs (0.6) .
the +//.
I I will tell you in secret the undergrads who read this poem made an argument about you know kids brushing their teeth .
&=laughs which I'm glad none of you tried to make that argument here today .
&=laughs:multiple (be)cause I had a hard time keeping a straight face when they were making that argument .
&=laughs:S2 ⌈ they both brushed their teeth ⌉ .
they both listened to their parents like they had fluorinate &~Fl Fluoride in their water and they brushed their teeth .
I'm like whose world are you like talking about ?
Colgate didn't exist in the eighteen fifties .
&=laughs anyway .
so but why the teeth ?
I mean Baudelaire's fascinated by body parts +/.
mhm +/.
+, and he writes entire poems about a piece of hair or like a lock of hair you know and the other one The Eyes of the Poor so why the teeth here ?
⌊ <well it could be> ⌋ .
⌈ could it just ⌉ be like a linking factor that links them in their youth ?
if you think that like you know depending on dental hygiene teeth get worse &=laughs:multiple as you get older and they start falling out whatever and when you're young maybe you both have white teeth .
they could just be a symbol for eating the ultimate consumption .
mhm mhm .
right .
in which case eyes could have worked just as well since seeing is the same kind of consumption .
but you know .
right .
yeah but it's not only the teeth but also the the whiteness that's ⌊ that's ⌋ +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, important there right ?
and it could be we could +//.
compare it a little to what &-um Jaime was talking about their innocence and we think about their what's that called ?
like the first teeth that fall out ?
baby teeth ?
thanks the baby teeth .
mhm +/.
+, so something that would they would lose eventually and .
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah .
oh: .
but also with that that &-um &=laughs:multiple .
yes ?
I think that this you know thinking that this is just a natural thing to do .
but if we look in the second paragraph he says you know he gives this whole list of what kids do when they're given something new .
they look at it they don't dare take it they doubt their good fortune .
and then they grab it and run .
which you know is very much a you know this is mine I have control over it I have ownership .
which is kind_of what's going on here so you know even if it is a kid thing to do and I think it is it also is tied up with this idea of of controlling and owning .
you know which they're not gonna lose .
which is only gonna become more prevalent .
of_course I don't know how teeth relate to that at all but &=laughs:multiple .
well we hafta think about hesitation on the brink the whiteness of the teeth &=laughs:multiple and &-um maybe think about I'm I'm very of_course interested in this sort_of hence the topic for today's class which is like four words all ending I believe in &~ization .
I don't believe I've ever sort_of constructed such a wordy title in my life .
&-um urbanization and regulation .
Haussmannization +//.
oh and boulevards .
&=laughs never mind three .
&-um so &-um I mean I think that what we discover at Haussmann's Paris is that there is a sense of urbanization without the planner yet like Haussmann in a sense is the preurban planner .
&-um he's the artist of demolition not yet so we don't really quite have at least in the imagination at that time the planner the urban planner .
&-um and what I'm very fascinated by of_course is that notion of regulation and the fear of that regulation becoming a metaphor for the mechanization of everyday life .
which is what we see in the films of the twenties and thirties .
and I just wanted to run &-um two clips by you .
that actually for me point to that analogy that Metropolis makes between the factory and the city .
that the French film only makes through a kind of I would argue a kind of visual &-uh reference to Metropolis it doesn't actually do it itself because we have the distinction of sort_of prison and the city military life and and the or prison and factory military life and the factory .
sort of the city in a sense is caught up in that but very external to those issues .
and &-um this is really just at the level of montage .
and &-um +...
and &-um I can only point to both a sort_of interest in &-um use &~tha using montage as some kind of aesthetic of fear &-um that these things right ?
in using the dissolve the lap dissolves the one becomes the other +/.
mhm +/.
+, seamlessly that I think is sort_of at the core of the fear that we find in &-um in these films which is very different from at least the way that we're reading the Baudelaire and the Haussmann these distinctions that are created .
whereas in the twenties and early thirties those distinctions are not as clear and I think that's where part of that fear comes in and I mean I would argue that this montage points to that dissolving of distinction .
&-um and a kind of heightened menace &=starts_video oops .
&=stops_video whoop <we have this we seem to> have not rewound this +...
so I'll just say a few more things .
&-um Metropolis you know I don't know if if those of you who know the film at all .
but there's even &-uh &-um a kind of mechanized woman robot woman at a certain point who &-um is made to be very much like this beautiful woman that we see &-um and so there's not only this fear of having a mechanized life &-um but that life can be reproducible .
so the level of fear and menace is is &-um exponentially stronger in Metropolis .
there she is there's the robot woman .
&=laughs oh damn damn damn .
stop stop stop .
I &~jus I think I hit fast forward instead of play .
xxx oh: +...
the agony of technology .
okay let's try that again .
(0.9) okay no .
we can fast forward through this .
this just tells about getting speed right when playing the Hammond organ &=starts_video Metropolis .
Rosa Rio on the Hammond organ playing the original score .
(0.6) I really hope we get through all this before okay .
(0.14) okay +...
so German Expressionism &-um (0.5) is often called upon as an aesthetic tradition when invoking this film +...
so we went right from the city through that lap dissolve to what looks like pistons and the functioning of a factory .
this is the dissolve again .
and there's other images of gears works +...
and I see something .
it looks like a train gear .
(0.9) .
it's always the parts of these machines too the close+ups never the whole ⌊ thing ⌋ +/.
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, right there .
+, you have no idea what they're making .
right the metonymy .
right ?
that part stands in for the the menace .
and then the ten hour day gets infused with this as well .
okay .
and what I wanna get to is the whistle .
because the whistle is the part that's like the whistle of the factory's &~al is embedded within the city .
(0.4) okay and then we have the title The Day Shift .
&=stops_video and we we've seen those men come marching in .
okay that in relationship to the French film so this is made in twenty six distributed in twenty seven and then the A Nous la Liberte which is Freedom for u@l-s is from thirty one so this is the French the fear of mechanized life is not attached to the city .
it's attached to &-um &=starts_video factory life .
the mechanization of everyday life through the factory .
and so here you have this very interesting dissolve of the record right the lineup of the men the record to the factory +...
&-um to the clock and that gear that the men all of these men turn this fantastical maybe that was some kind early form of clock punching clock but there seems to to be no regularity with which these men move that handle .
and once again the music .
(0.6) nineteen thirty one also is in some ways the beginning of the fear of fascism in Europe .
so that there's also an equation of fascism with factory life .
&-um and then this this choreography of movement &-um also the I mean this fear of being detected I would argue comes from some of this that was already been &-um made .
you know that fear <from the> from the mid twenties and instead of having the huge groups of men coming in you have the individual shift change while the line is still moving .
and you just fall into place put your part on the <track > so it's even there's no even stoppage which you have in Metropolis .
of the &~sh the change in shift .
right ?
and the police state .
&=stops_video so it's really interesting at least for me in terms of film that the police state the prison state the military state get equated by analogy to the sort_of &~mechanisi the factory and then the mechanization of everyday life .
that the fear no longer comes from the city itself which we saw earlier on .
so the dehumanizing actually is coming from work .
and you have that long &~s you have that sequence of the man sleeping and the guards telling him work why're why aren't you working ?
work sets us free .
and then you see the teacher saying that to the boys in the classroom they're writing and that immediately that lap dissolve goes to the men working in the factory .
and then back to the guy you know lounging in the prison yard .
so &-um now that use of montage and menace right ?
for me is very distinct from the one in The City .
right ?
which shows not fear but progress .
right ?
so what'll in that article about city plans and planners that I talked yesterday about those the four ways in which you know the &~pla the plan is revealed the planning is revealed &-um the final one of wizardry I would actually argue that the films are the ones that helped produce the planner as wizard .
and you can see that <in this> in this sequence so whereas earlier &=adjusting_video oops_a_daisy .
right the editing +/.
&-uh oh +/.
+, (0.10) whereas the editing showed fear .
the wizard .
right the wizard we need the wizard where's the wizard when we need him ?
&=laughs:S1 okay .
let's see +...
&=inserts_video &=laughs:multiple .
yes .
I gave it an extra little shove .
&=laughs:multiple &=starts_video but see here we go (0.6) so we have a kind of &-um +...
crescendo .
of healthiness in this new planning .
music entertainment advances in medicine the farmers' market brought to you .
right ?
the school is the center .
(0.5) romanticization of the children .
and using the children right ?
(0.33) is that a sombrero ?
&=laughs:multiple .
yeah I saw that .
oh ⌊ this this was great .
oh yeah ⌋ .
⌈ yeah gotta love the xxx ⌉ .
⌊ right ⌋ ?
so this is this argument I'm making about the montage .
it's +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.

of that fear of &~con conflation it's editing now to show &=laughs:multiple ⌈ right ⌉ ?
⌊ yeah ⌋ yeah .

the fear of the overlapping you can actually change this .

change these horrible things to .

right .
(0.9) not blight but vision courage right ?
that planner as visionary as wizard .
mhm +/.
+, (0.13) using childhood equated with disorder .
oh yeah .
(0.57) .
⌈ great ⌉ .
⌊ that's ⌋ kinda confused though I mean what are they talking about they're talking about these great big &-um metropolises and then the suburbs they're talking about rebuilding or making new cities .
you know I mean &~i I &~se it seemed like they were kind_of going from one to the other .
well that is I mean if you look at Haussmann as the great decentralizer that's why he's so importantly the predecessor to urban planning .
because urban planning at this point was building these garden cities or new cities .
mhm +/.
+, which we would call suburbs .
but they envision them as these perfectly insulated little cities .
well those are even still being built today like Disney World has one of those .
oh yeah .
yeah ?
+, &-uh what is it called ?
Happiness ?
Harmony ?
I don't even know .
&=laughs .
xxx .
⌈ who ⌉ .
⌊ it's ⌋ scary though .
who paid for this &~produc &-uh production ?
⌈ and ⌉ .
⌊ oh ⌋ this was paid for by &-uh the Carnegie ⌈ Corporation ⌉ .
⌊ oh ⌋ that's right .
is it to sort_of seduce the taxpayer into thinking that they should fund this ?
I mean and who's the we ?
you know they kept saying we we we we .
we should provide this for everyone .
and then it was the we of the working class .
we don't deserve to live like this .
<it's pretty> bizarre .
well it was made for the nineteen thirty nine World's Fair .
oh +/.
+, so the we would be all of the spectators I think the thirty nine World's Fair I think that was the one in Corona Queens .
+, mm +/.
+, probably +/.
+, right ?
if I'm not mistaken that's the one in in New York City .
so and that is on the very edge of New York City .
so basically the we is all the people who'll be coming to this .
we do not want blight we want choice .
+, mhm +/.
+, right ?
so that we is a voice of the progress +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, of the people .
well why would the &~Carn Carnegie Foundation or whoever why would they why would they want this ?
well I'm +//.
you know this is interesting I'm not sure but you know at the same time there was a British film also called The City also made in nineteen thirty nine about the new cities the the garden &~cit what are called in the in British vernacular you know garden cities .
these are called like the new city &-uh in in America .
I don't know if there's a if there's one like one was a consequence of the other .
that is the one for England was made therefore the one in America hadta made to prove that we too have this this pastoral vision of the new city .
or you know vice versa .
so I I'm gonna say it's two things .
one is there is &-um a kind of competition of &-um developing an ideal living space .
there's also a desire to &-um sort_of decongest the city .
but also that at a World's Fair you wanna show the world what your technology can produce .
your technology your know-how your American technology and know-how can produce perfect harmonious living spaces .
and the idea too of the happy worker is a better worker .
mhm +/.
+, and the +/.
+, yeah oh +/.
+, worker who has a happy family +/.
+, right +/.
+, is a better worker too .
right .
because you also have leisure time you're not stuck on these roads right ?
that whole sequence of the roads that ends with the car crashing .
&=laughs <cue it up but we don't have time> so &=laughs .
could they +/.
+, ⌊ could ⌋ they be investing in in those constructions ?
perhaps like speculating with the .
mhm .
the Carnegie Foundation ?
or .
yeah .
I don't know anything about it it's just a question .
oh that's a good question .
it was a philanthropic organization but obviously behind .
yeah Carnegie got his money from somewhere .
yeah .
steel .
⌈ steel yeah ⌉ .
⌊ steel ⌋ .
right ?
construction I suspect ultimately .
all his neighborhoods xxx you know .
right &=laughs:multiple ⌈ all those steel ⌉ .
⌊ that's what ⌋ that's what Pittsburgh apparently looked like in the xxx ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ but also like in a way ⌉ in a sense I remember that <in this> in this documentary they they made that transition from that disorganized vision of the city like through the airplane <and the> and the train ride to these to the cities .
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ and ⌉ and I guess like in a sense it could be linked <to that> to that whole like &-um commercializing of the &-um the train to to work everyday or something like this .
+, mhm +/.
+, like pushing people out and and making this railway system work kinda xxx .
actually that just happened where right by where my parents live there's a community that was built and it's a_lot_o(f) property but what they chose to do was they chose everyone chose to have their houses built on really teeny tiny lots and that all of the rest of it's open space that they all share .
mhm +/.
+, and they built a train station +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, to specifically go to Chicago so people can go to work so they don't hafta drive they don't hafta be in their cars but they the community has its own school it has its own post office it has it basically its own little community in in a town .
but it's separate .
so it's really yeah and it and that kind of goes along the same +/.
+, mhm great +/.
+, xxx .
well I think what's really interesting about that vision in fact you pointed to the one of the central issues of this course is about circulation transportation but that it's the airplane .
right ?
that &~pa again the panoptic vision .
mhm +/.
+, right that &~pan not just the panorama but the overhead shot the bird's eye view of what that space could potentially be .
so it's again about a particular kind of control here control for you know one could argue practically for health pragmatically for health reasons working closer to the to factories schools in walking proximity for the kids and all that .
but actually creating these &~isola isolated no one ever thought about the isolation then of that community right ?
from other nodes of &=laughs the world .
&-um but again because it's you you know the the plane is used here to make the link .
right ?
over space over time .
&-um to draw out the highway every town will have its own interchange .
right ?
that notion that interchange would bring some kind of communication .
but that in fact is you know topographically controlled .
right ?
so I mean there's a_lot_of questions that this kind of film brings up .
&-um but actually we &~a we saw all of the potential in that Haussmann .
all of what we see developing in the thirties &-uh in the late thirties &-um where we have to wait for the war for the housing boom the end of the war for the housing boom in the States <we see> we see in in this kind_of a film .
and that is described in that article .
I mean London basically uses its bombed out city to reconstruct a better city .
&-um so these I think these questions I'm gonna put this film on reserve &-um The City and all of A Nous la Liberte .
and you should feel free to watch them .
but I think I'll bring that film The City back when we &~tal next week we're gonna see Blade Runner so we're already pushing right the construction the control the &~regu the the sort_of urbanization and regulation to an extreme .
right ?
&-um Brazil would be another film that we could see .
that would show some of that same kind of regularization .
so &-um for next week I think let me just quick look at the syllabus .
kind_of shut off dialogue there (be)cause I had that whole theory about montage so if you think about that feel free to come back and talk about it .
but &-um next week &-um it's we're really gonna &~t move to +//.
the article from the Cinematic City is about Blade Runner .
Schivelbusch is about lighting the streets .
Baudelaire Les Fenetres also you can read more of the Baudelaire you'll see you can draw back connections but it's really gonna be about like LA and &-um these &~p the the postmodern city .
&-um all of the articles underneath which are either in cinema or the course pack deal with different ways that sort of culture has dealt with regulation .
right ?
photography in the commune .
posters and &-um degenerate art &-um the Manet one actually doesn't really kind_of fit but it's still very interesting &=laughs if you wanna read it .
and we're gonna also talk about the commune I believe next week .
right ?
as a kind of regulation of space .
which is interesting (be)cause it's seen both as failure of Haussmann but at the same time a city that allowed the commune to happen .
mhm .
alright ?
and your presentation is on that last article there xxx .
⌊ is that right ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ somewhat .
+, okay .
+, &-um yeah .
so we should read the Prysbylski ?
what do you think ?
I don't know I think it can't hurt I mean it's a very interesting article .
I'll email you guys .
I'm not sure how much I'll focus on that &-um I'll probably talk about maybe the commune bring that in and then talk about the other stuff just you know regulation of space in general .
&-um I might also talk about the situationists in the commune .
mhm +/.
+, so okay .
&-um would you mind at all just giving us a hint of what this &~dee street distinctions assignment will be ?
(be)cause I won't be here for spring break so if it's something that must be done in Ann Arbor then I need to do it like next week right after class or ⌊ something ⌋ .
⌈ okay sure ⌉ the street distinctions that is basically I want you to map however you envision mapping as opposed to essaying right ?
mapping the distinction between &-um &-uh +...
Liberty between State and &~Huro no Liberty between State and Main and Huron .
between State and Main .
can you say that again please ?
sure I want you to map the distinction between Liberty Street +/.
mhm +/.
+, between State Street and Main Street that so those &~f five blocks and so Liberty Street in relationship to Huron .
that's also along that those same five block area from State to Main .
so actually two parallel streets .
+, hm +/.
+, Washington is really a liminal space but I'm ignoring it .
&=laughs:S4 because it is a liminal space .
&=laughs &-um so that's what that assignment is .
so mapping and you can &~ma I mean you can imagine mapping in anyway you want to .
conceive of mapping in any way you want to .
so &-um I would love your essays of the experience .
I already have one in bag form .
(0.6) .
Carina when are your office hours ?
Tuesdays from one to three .
but if that doesn't work with +//.
for you you should contact me to see if there's a better time .
&-um I'm gonna be on campus sadly for myself a_lot next week .
okay .
+, but fortunately for people who wanna come talk to me .
and if you wanna come talk to me about papers just email me and then I I mean emailing me first and saying like I wanna come talk to you about papers sets me up to kind_of know like what you wanna xxx .
