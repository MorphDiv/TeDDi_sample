Jody and Bowdy ? 2615744_2616941
maybe it's Brinkley and Bowdy . 2616941_2618982
uhm so what I was thinking of where you go you make a left turn from the left lane and and you go straight or right from the right lane . 2618982_2625940
oh that's at u:hm u:hm . 2625940_2628913
it's on Bowdy . 2628913_2630482

my first thought but . 2652568_2653190
that's one lane . 2653190_2655912
the left lane is for going straight . 2655912_2657398
it's not no because it's a four way stop, isn't it ? 2657398_2660370
no (0.3) . 2660370_2664911

yeah you know cause she doesn't like making left turn in the left lane and going straight . 2677997_2681507
she thinks she should be able to go straight . 2681507_2683282
or make a left from the left lane . 2683282_2685815
and only right turn . 2685815_2687468
