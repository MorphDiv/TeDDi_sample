the two by two that Nathan made from his asymmetric four square . 340_4300
do you think that the design the way he made . 6500_8240
I'm going out one way that you could fold it . 8460_11020
but that's not symmetrical because &-um the kind of like the green
and the other one . 18220_19170
but it's going down . 19780_20790
and &-um so that couldn't take it . 21300_23220
&-um okay . 24410_25390
so was that imagining holding it right down the middle from top to
it was like . 29220_29700
yeah . 29880_30020
yeah . 30190_30350
okay . 30850_31030
like this and the other way you couldn't because again with the
and it would be touching &-um some of the &-um the &-um it would be
okay . 62310_62520
so you don't think that that one is symmetrical . 62620_64680
&-um I was doing a look at it d diagonally . 65459_69060
yep . 69140_69310
always check the diagonal . 69450_70630
then I think that I'm looking at a way but this is hard to tell . 75470_80510
yes it's &-um . 81780_83510
you see a way you could fold his so it would be symmetrical . 92190_94620
I know it's probably not L green . 95740_100170
I think it's probably not because &-um of the Ls again those would
okay . 111720_111890
those green l l sheets on the edge of your design . 112280_115000
I was trying to tell two I was looking at is the cross . 115340_119080
it's kind of like a cross the bottom one that goes like this on the
and the upper one that goes like this . 125270_127090
I was trying to see if I was trying to &-um see it . 127670_130800
those two would come up and each_other . 131240_133920
&-um and wouldn't go off and stuff . 134530_137000
that's what I was trying to look for . 137160_138730
okay . 139050_139290
so that two by two design that came from your core square that was
you're pretty sure it's not symmetrical . 144780_146200
could you have made a different two by two design with your core
I believe I need one . 157540_159330
I was &-um where two green were touched down . 159660_164000
four here . 165480_165840
uhhuh . 166150_166450
and then two green down here too . 167180_168690
and then it could go over like this . 168960_171410
okay . 173390_173520
please do for Nathan what you did for Nicole he has just one core
and he'll describe one more time for you what he thinks he could do
watch what he's showing you . 189360_190460
these have two greens over here and two greens down here . 190480_194780
and I &-um and then it I think it would make a symmetrical one by .
so he would put can I hold that up for a second . 199580_201490
he would arrange it so that c o e has two small green squares here
actually it's a green rectangle it's not two green squares . 206640_208510
he would get all of his green rectangles in the center of his
and then he thinks he could divide it right down the middle . 213340_215300
and it would beme I I think I even saw another way . 215460_219480
if you had it the same way you could hold it up like that . 220940_226300
I think . 226720_227020
do you think he's right that he would end up with a design that he
and then that would pulled up to to there . 236340_239500
and I think that also matched these things too . 239580_242110
because &-um there would probably be like &-um there'd be the
then it would probably be going like there down here . 249310_252660
then it pulled up to me up there . 253380_256190
and I thought it would probably make this . 256300_258709
so is it always true that you can start with a horse square that's
is that always true . 276310_277070
yes that because all of us &-um had a &-um not symmetrical one . 277940_284780
and we showed one . 285210_286210
yeah at_least one that could make it some at_least one way that
did we find that . 297730_298550
did anyone here have an asymmetric core square that we didn't make
did anybody have an asymmetric core square that we were not able to
no . 312860_312990
but we found more than one way . 314380_315630
yeah . 315910_316010
is that symmetrical or asymmetrical right . 319420_322240
and we were only we're only talking about asymmetrical ones for
I don't know . 327550_327870
can we say that . 327940_328580
can we say that you could always take an asymmetric four square and
I was just trying &-um before when you were seeing that I was kind
and I was thinking to see if it was symmetrical . 343020_346300
and it was . 346340_346950
okay . 347830_347940
so you imagined that four square because &-um that looks like a
yeah . 353000_353150
if it &-um if you fold it like this it would be match &-um if you
and like this it &-um those two ways would make it . 360460_363780
&-um it wouldn't be symmetrical those ways . 364370_366300
but if you fold it that angle &-um then it would be symmetrical . 366630_369900
do we still have one . 370940_371740
yes we do . 372100_372550
&-um Nathan's asking you to think about a core square and a
if you right here these two would be touching these ones . 377540_382710
and then these that's be touching each_other . 382950_386070
but like this it would not . 386340_388130
and like this it would not . 390300_392190
and and if it's this way you could do it and this way for
okay . 398970_399190
so Nathan says he was picturing &-um a core square based on the
and at first he thought . 402930_403750
oh it's not symmetrical because he imagined this . 403790_406200
and they wouldn't match . 406480_407150
oops . 407200_407320
sorry . 407590_407710
and he imagined this . 408050_408680
and they wouldn't match . 408990_409700
but diagonally he did find lines of symmetry . 410270_413830
so this wouldn't be one to do our test on for the problem . 414140_416710
we were thinking about today . 417210_418360
Curtis I &-um when you were doing that I just thought of a way that
you could use all the &-um triangles the the red triangles . 427990_433240
do you see what he's saying to test if this really was if the
if we had used two green triangles that form a square the polygrams
if we had used red triangles instead_of red squares you could have
okay . 454960_455230
so I don't know what did we find out . 456670_458010
do you think there's an asymmetric core square out there that can't
how many ways did we test today . 465110_466240
like twenty one maybe because &-um twenty like twenty one because
and I had <two ways> two ways . 482230_484540
&-um but I mean how many different foursquares did we test . 486530_490190
yes . 490250_490370
but you did find you found some ways with the same Corry you ha
