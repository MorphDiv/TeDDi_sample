similar to what we were doing been doing, but it's got a slightly different twist on it . 0_4136
where do you think they could have gotten the one hundred degrees if you're looking at that circle ? 4136_7715
a v@l c@l is the angle we're looking at . 7715_11906
we know arc a@l c@l and we know arc b@l d@l . 11906_22960
where could they have gotten that one hundred degrees ? 22960_27015
Michaela ? 27015_31703
there's two ways you can get it . 31703_33480
the first way is to add the measures of angle one and angle two together . 33480_37735
and the second way is to add the measure of the two arcs together and divide it by two . 37735_41760
okay . 41760_42390
so Michaela says there's two ways . 42390_43840
she thinks you can do one hundred and sixty plus forty and you get two hundred, divide it in half, and that gives you one hundred . 43840_52173
or she got eighty plus twenty equals one hundred . 52173_56118
okay ? 56118_58253
do we have anything to back up either one of those more than the other ? 58253_61271
or do you want to just do the next row and see what we come up with ? 61271_64781
yeah . 64781_66638
let's do the next row . 66638_67531
so the next one says if a@l c@l is one eighty degrees, b@l d@l is seventy degrees, what about angle one ? 67531_77860
or angle two ? 77860_80196
those are the inscribed angles . 80196_84451
if a@l c@l is one eighty, what does that angle one have to be ? 84451_95933
ninety . 95933_96821
ninety degrees . 96821_97345
okay ? 97345_97731
half . 97731_98213
how about b@l d@l ? 98213_101698
&~fa seventy degrees . 101698_105148
seventy degrees . 105148_106441
what do you think ? 106441_106931
inscribed angle . 106931_108370
thirty five . 108370_109491
thirty five . 109491_110041
so what does that leave us with for a@l v@l c@l ? 110041_114843
with Michaela's first method, it would be what did we come up with ? 114843_122193
ninety and thirty added together . 122193_124721
what would that give us ? 124721_125645
one twenty five . 125645_126923
one twenty five . 126923_128820
what about the other way ? 128820_129535
if we do one eighty plus seventy, what does that give us ? 129535_132741
two fifty . 132741_134331
two fifty . 134331_134796
divide that . 134796_136188
divide that in half, you get +... 136188_137230
one twenty five . 137230_138108
one twenty five . 138108_138573
they both work . 138573_140070
that's interesting . 140070_143003
what do you think ? 143003_148643
first angle is half the a@l c@l . 148643_160063
okay . 160063_162201
what Matt says +... 162201_163218
that for measure of angle one has to be half of the arc a@l c@l . 163218_169778
okay . 169778_170090
so you feel like we're talking about the general one again, he says, we're down to the last row with x@l . 170090_175016
measure of angle one has to be half of a@l c@l . 175016_178648
do we agree with that ? 178648_179866
that's inscribed angle . 179866_182080
how about measure of angle two has to be half of +... 182080_186960
b@l d@l . 186960_187640
b@l d@l . 187640_188480
x@l two . 188480_189121
so what do you think about measure of a@l v@l c@l ? 189121_193210
Katie ? 193210_194518
what if you added the two angles together at the top and that was whatever that is, if it's the triangle +... 194518_200898
you get that other measure, and then it's an eighty degree thing . 200898_206468
see if you subtract that from one eighty . 206468_208515
like +... 208515_209980
okay . 209980_210513
say that again . 210513_211106
all right . 211106_211555
that you add the two angles at the top and subtract that one from that one from one eighty because that makes a triangle . 211555_217505
okay . 217505_218201
and then it's on the one eighty degrees line cause that's where the line is +... 218201_221355
so you subtract that from one eighty and that give you what the other angle is . 221355_226191
okay . 226191_228886
you're talking about a@l v@l c@l or d@l v@l b@l ? 228886_231328
a@l v@l c@l . 231328_232696
the first one . 232696_233023
and it works for the other one, too . 233023_236915
okay . 236915_237613
is that a lot to do for a general rule ? 237613_241735
maybe, but it works . 241735_243675
it works ? 243675_244148
okay . 244148_244996
so now we have maybe three different ways to find it ? 244996_247628
but that actually that actually proves that what Michaela said works . 247628_252836
(be)ause xxx . 252836_253850
which one there ? 253850_254220
she did two . 254220_255441
both of them . 255441_256050
well both of them +... 256050_257173
it proves that both of them work . 257173_258245
<both of them got the same thing> . 258245_259464
<both of them got the same answer> as the other one that Katie just said, and that really proves it . 259464_264091
the one hundred and twenty five and the one hundred that we already went over ? 264091_267201
yeah . 267201_267475
okay . 267475_268688
because basically just adding angle one and angle two together is simplifying adding a@l c@l and b@l d@l b@l d@l together and divide it by two . 268688_277985
(be)cause if you do one eighty +... 277985_279183
okay . 279183_279760
you do one eighty minus one hundred and twenty five, you get fifty five . 279760_283098
well then, if you do one eighty minus fifty five you get one hundred twenty five again . 283098_286376
okay . 286376_287976
it's longer, but it proves it . 287976_290460
okay . 290460_290981
well, so let's look at the theorem that it wants us to fill in . 290981_294283
the measures of an angle formed by two secants or chords that intersect the interior of the circle is what ? 294283_301698
blank the blank of the measures . 301698_307115
xxx . 307115_311026
which one of those methods would fit into that ? 311026_312700
we have three different ways, which one would fit into there ? 312700_316785
half the sum of the two arcs . 316785_320740
okay . 320740_321251
so if you take the sum of the two arcs and you divide them in half, I think that's the one that fits best in there . 321251_326111
any of your methods were pretty good . 326111_327940
okay . 327940_330105
Michaela had the two that I was thinking of and then Katie had a third one that was really good . 330105_334225
the measures end up being half of whatever those two sums are . 334225_341585
because not all the examples are gonna be as specific as these are to follow through with your other with the third way to do it . 341585_354780
do you understand what I mean ? 354780_356158
you could probably do it yourself on every example, but that might be time consuming . 356158_360168
all right . 360168_362575
let's look at the very last one . 362575_363725
you guys are doing really good with these patterns . 363725_367198
b@l d@l measure of arc b@l d@l is two hundred degrees . 367198_373320
now we have the vertex of two secants outside the circle . 373320_377591
okay . 377591_379910
we had it on the circle . 379910_381431
we had it inside the circle . 381431_382173
now we're dealing with the outside of the circle . 382173_384070
a lot of you guys had this question last week when you were talking about that test . 384070_387878
you have measure of arc b@l d@l . 387878_391845
that's at two hundred degrees . 391845_392956
and then you have a@l c@l, the smaller one right before they intersect at forty degrees . 392956_396916
then you have the measure of angle one . 396916_398910
they give you one hundred . 398910_400653
where did they get that ? 400653_401396
xxx . 401396_404926
measure of angle one . 404926_405693
kind of following right along . 405693_407335
Melissa ? 407335_407683
xxx intercepted arc of for angle of b@l d@l <has to be half> . 407683_411901
<good> . 411901_412226
intercepted . 412226_412925
good . 412925_413556
so it has to be half . 413556_414026
good . 414026_414323
two . 414323_416070
measure of angle two . 416070_417715
they say twenty degrees . 417715_418763
what do you think ? 418763_419515
go ahead . 419515_423163
the same reason as for measured angle . 423163_425513
good . 425513_425771
you guys are following right along . 425771_426731
the same reason . 426731_427283
okay ? 427283_427835
the other one's forty . 427835_428515
this one's half . 428515_429168
it's gotta be twenty . 429168_430715
and they get a@l v@l c@l . 430715_432610
back to this measure angle a@l v@l c@l . 432610_435060
if it's outside the circle . 435060_436160
what do you think they how do you think they got that eighty degrees ? 436160_439523
Ben ? 439523_440561
you can do first you gotta do one eighty minus one and that gives you the measure of b@l c@l d@l +... 440561_451996
and then you do that plus adding the two, and then subtract that from one hundred eighty one, and then you have a@l v@l c@l . 451996_462495
okay . 462495_463175
so you were going with that whole large triangle +... 463175_465558
yeah . 465558_466551
sum . 466551_467713
so he said v@l c@l b@l, if you do that minus angle one, which was one hundred, that leaves you with what ? 467713_474551
that leaves you with eighty . 474551_479560
eighty . 479560_479823
okay ? 479823_480335
you have eighty you have measure of angle two, which is +... 480335_483760
<twenty> . 483760_484228
<twenty> . 484228_484451
so that gives you one hundred so that angle v@l a@l v@l c@l has to be +... 484451_489051
eighty . 489051_489491
eighty . 489491_490380
that works . 490380_491291
right ? 491291_492195
that works . 492195_493020
or you can do a@l c@l is the xxx outside, the angle is outside the circle . 493020_503883
which one a@l c@l what ? 503883_505115
the arc ? 505115_505603
a@l v@l c@l . 505603_506273
a@l v@l c@l . 506273_506650
angle a@l v@l c@l . 506650_507301
it's outside there, but it intercepts a@l c@l . 507301_510380
the arc a@l c@l +... 510380_512603
okay . 512603_513003
the arc's forty degrees, and since angle a@l v@l c@l is eighty, maybe it's forty times times two, xxx . 513003_521615
maybe it's forty times two ? 521615_522980
do you have something to back that up ? 522980_524201
no ? 524201_525928
it also intercepts arc b@l d@l . 525928_528163
okay . 528163_530795
but, if you do b@l d@l which equals two hundred plus a@l c@l xxx two forty . 530795_541033
mm hmm . 541033_541521
at no, wait . 541521_542481
do two hundred minus forty and then you get one sixty . 542481_546375
okay . 546375_547086
divide that by two and that equals eighty . 547086_549920
okay . 549920_550475
(be)ause we're trying to stick with this general pattern of it ending up being what's it end up being every time ? 550475_556968
if you've been following this pattern of the angle it turns out to be +... 556968_561545
half . 561545_563360
half you're scaring me it ends up being half . 563360_567466
