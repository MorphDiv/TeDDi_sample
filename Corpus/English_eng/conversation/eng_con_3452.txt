the boy is looking at his frog in the bottle .
and he loves his frog .

and then the frog tries to get out .
and then when they wake up &-um the frog isn't in there .
so the boy feels sad .
and then they look everywhere .
and the dog gets his head stuck in the bottle .
and they're picking up the boots .
and then they look out the window .

he's yelling to him .
and <there's> the dog falls out the window .
and then the glass breaks .
and then the boy is mad at him .

I wonder what the boy is saying to those frogs .
