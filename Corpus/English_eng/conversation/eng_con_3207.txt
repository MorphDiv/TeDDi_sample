We'll move on now to the next section of the test↘ 11_1904
task three↘ 2341_3163
uh so task three is a::nother role play↘ 4470_7947
In which you are the teacher↘ 8196_9348
and we are your students↘ 9491_10824
Your task i:s to teach us a common term or concept→ 11262_14899
from your field of study↘ 14877_16403
°yea°↘ 16739_17085
If you cannot think of a term we will provide 17274_19546
you with a list of terms from which you can choose↘ 19547_22032
You will have seven minutes to teach us your term or 23189_26155
concept↘ 26158_26585
mhm 26862_27262
As you explain this term or concept→ we may 27530_30234
interrupt you to ask questions↘ 30239_31903
And we may also ask questions after you have 32325_34746
finished↘ 34746_35167
sure↘ 35572_36009
Here are four issues to consider as you prepare↘ 36356_39556
Can you give a formal ⁎definition of this term⁎↗ 40479_43770
can you explain why this term is important in 45060_48495
your field of study↗ 48500_49449
how will you begin your explanation↗
and how can you be sure that your audience 53596_55671
understands what the term means↗ 55665_57644
and can you make the definition clearer or 58755_61096
simpler by using examples analogies or 61090_64738
the blackboard↗ 64738_65378
∬ok∬↘ 66333_66839
You will have one minute to prepare what you 67008_69302
want to say↘ 69302_70304
during this time→ you may use a scrap piece of 70304_72651
paper↘ or the blackboard to prepare↘ 72646_74987
Do you have a term or a concept in mind↗ 75937_77793
°yea°↘ 77793_78305
ok↘ (0.3) uh so you can have one minute now to 78299_81265
prepare↘ 81265_81793
°can I xxx can I use the blackboard°↗ 82084_83300
uh yea↘ mhm 83300_84270
um I have a question→ like I can write while 98911_101737
teaching right↗ 101740_102151
⌈mhm 102151_102321
mhm ⁎yea of course⁎↘ 102318_103944
you're ⌈ready 131302_132225
⌊Are you ready↗ 132221_132579
yea↘ 132579_133005
ok↘ sure↘ 133004_133783
hm go ahead↘ 134888_135640
So I would like ⁇actually⁇ like to uh teach you 135663_137978
guys about the autocycle xxx application in 137998_140228
⁇automatic⁇ engine↘ 140227_141198
so autocycle is a: thermodynamic cycle→ (0.4) 141444_144794
uh which actually is followed in a spark ignited 144792_148120
uh gasoline engine which I will explain what it 148116_150708
xxx is↘ 150713_151118
A spark ignited engines are the ones whose 151124_153316
conversion process that is actually triggered 153316_156078
by a spark plug which is like high uh intensity 156082_159127
voltage↘≈ 159122_159687
mhm 159692_160284
which uh is actually- which creates a spark due 160284_163639
to the potential difference between two 163629_165261
⁇droplets⁇↘ 165258_166021
mhm 166026_166426
uh which will be controlled by an engine 166422_168518
control unit↘≈ 168518_169356
+≈ mhm≈ 169355_169702
+≈ and uh so (0.3) first we talk about the xxx- 169712_172213
sorry↗ 172224_172576
so is that engine used in every car↗ 172592_175243
in like all the gasoline cars↘ 175659_177227
yea all the ⌈gasoline cars↗ 177226_178485
⌊yea
all the- all the gasoline engines are actually 178490_181077
triggered by a spark plug↘ 181072_182512
oh:≈ 182766_183134
+≈ yea because actually the uh ⌈temperature↗≈ 183132_185858
+≈ mhm≈ 185850_186069
+≈ that gasoline need I mean uh xxx that 186058_188837
gasoline needs to have for (0.4) starting the 188843_191067
compression is actually really high↘ 191061_192560
⌈mhm 192557_192882
⌊mhm
so the spark actually can induce the atmosphere 192876_195558
pressure↘ so that the uh gasoline start 195543_197548
⁇combustion⁇↘ 197543_198135
mhm 198135_198492
can be burning yea↘ 198481_199665
mhm 199665_200023
so uh before starting about xxx cycle I just 200020_202943
explain about four uh process→ in a 202945_205718
thermodynamic process usually↘ 205715_207022
so it's like iso:baric process↘ 207027_209448
so isobaric process is a process in which the 209674_212186
pressure remaines constant↘ 212178_213709
pressure inside the system which is under 214094_215529
consideration↘ 215529_216275
mhm 216270_216750
and isochoroc process→ 216755_218382
isochoric process is the one in which the 219944_222034
volume of the system remains constant↘ 222029_223832
and (0.6) isothermic process (2.8) in which uh 224282_230170
the temperature of the system will remain 230180_231961
constant unless the fourth one→ which is 231972_234132
adiabatic process in which there's no heat 234140_236679
added or removed from the system↘ 236673_238993
system under consideration↘ 239645_240850
so uh this is the b- basic four processes↘ so 241082_244309
that uh which will actually help me uh explain 244304_247168
autocycle in xxx↘ 247168_248442
mhm 248437_248826
so autocycle is the one like→ (2.0) this is the 248842_252613
volume↘ 252618_253258
this is the pressure of the system↘ 253720_255336
so uh (1.0) autocycle→ 255664_258394
this is volume one→ volume two→ 261723_263553
V one V two↘ 264439_265330
pressure increases this way↘ 265708_267207
volume increases this way↘ 267217_268396
⌈mhm 268409_269193
⌊mhm
and uh it's actually the first point of ⁇our⁇ 269188_271550
consideration↘ 271556_272308
so (0.5) this will be when the volume is maximum 272545_275351
volume in a cylinder you know in ⌈an engine↘ 275350_277392
mhm
in an engine there will be a cylinder which will 277398_279622
⌈be having a piston and it will be moving up and 279648_281498
⌊hm
down↘≈ 281493_281824
+≈ hm 281818_282149
so this is the (0.3) bottom ⁇most⁇ position↘ we 282149_284565
we call it bottom xxx center↗ 284563_285843
mhm 285835_286187
so this portion actually when you move up→ 286192_289243
when the piston moves up actually the volume 289241_291476
(0.8) releases and uh uh actually we see it 291479_295324
⁇while⁇ walls↘ like walls will be closed↘ 295340_297366
so the uh cylinder will be clo- I mean ◉sealed◉≈ 297568_300224
+≈ hm 300229_300570
so when the- actually when the piston moves up 300570_302912
the uh fuel and air mixture inside that will be 302928_306128
compressed↘ so the pressure between xxx≈ 306133_308405
+≈ mhm 308410_308644
this is actually an adi- adiabiatic (0.3) 308638_311022
compression↗ 311017_311732
It's an adiabatic compression→ (0.6) and uh this 311901_314583
xxx when spark (0.4) spark uh plug actually um 314594_318087
we mentioned about it↘ 318093_319191
spark plug will be (0.3) actually like (0.3) 319190_321478
triggered in this ⌈point then the compression 321489_323505
⌊hm
will actually in- increase↘ I mean (0.3) add heat 323510_326027
to the system↘ 326027_326843
so this is like uh isochoric constant 327055_329471
volume→ (0.3) constant volume↘≈ 329466_331034
+≈ ⌈mhm 331039_331242
⌊isochoric heat addition→ (0.6) isochoroc heat 331247_334234
addition↘ 334230_334865
and uh this is adiabatic expansion when the 335126_337873
engine moves down↘ 337868_338961
this is isochoric heat reduc- I mean ⁇reduction⁇↘ 341116_344406
344412_344652
this is where like→ this- uh- it's a constant 344649_346531
volume (0.4) process↘ 346521_348067
and uh yea↘ 349047_350151
this is how like→ uh this is basic cycle which is 350903_353730
xxx in a ⁇gasoline⁇ engine↘≈ 353730_355452
+≈ mhm 355452_355911
you have any doubt↗ 355911_356818
ok so→ (0.5) just to clarify↘ 357236_359652
yea sure↘ 359657_360335
so you're explaining a sort of process≈ 360329_362921
+≈ ⌈yea↘ 362927_363204
correct↗≈ 363204_363588
yea↘≈ 363588_363790
⁎where (0.4) it might start (0.4) at point two⁎ 363785_367289
⁎on volume and then move down⁎↘ 367286_368950
⁎and then heat is added⁎↘ ⁎and then (0.) the⁎ 369290_371498
⁎volume changes⁎↘ 371492_372516
yea↘≈ 372516_372943
+≈ ⁎right⁎↗ ⁎ok⁎↘ ⁎just °making sure°⁎↘ 372952_374654
∬ok cool∬↘ 374664_375800
so uh actually for better understanding I can 375793_378273
actually show how a piston→ I mean≈ 378279_380284
+≈ sure↘ 380278_380561
+≈ in engine's xxx we have a wall with the spark 380556_383750
plug↘ 383746_384087
and the piston here which is connected to 384402_386876
xxx and like grand shaft which is rotating↘≈ 386876_389474
mhm 389473_389692
so ⌈when this actually rotates→ this xxx 389700_392127
⌊mhm
move up and down↘ 392127_393375
so this uh (0.4) actually starting from this 393983_396831
point→ 396810_397210
mhm 397204_397428
when uh I mean this point↘ sorry↘ 397407_399914
this is the point one ⁇when⁇ it starts here↘ 400121_402361
so this is like the maximum volume↘ this is the 402594_404840
this the the volume under consideration↘ 404843_406310
mhm 406310_406550
I xxx by the piston↘ 406546_407687
the volume xxx by the piston↘ 407932_409196
so at this point→ (0.3) when uh it actually goes 409404_411836
up→ (0.6) then both of the walls should be 411841_414540
actually sealed↘ (0.3) so that it's airtight↘ 414540_417014
and uh when it goes up the piston moves 417303_419905
up↘ the air mixture will be compressed→≈ 419911_421836
+≈ mhm 421842_422471
and then here is a point where actually 422007_424679
the spark plug→ (0.3) this this is the point of 424686_426846
V one↘ this would be the V one↘ 426856_428280
this would be V two↘ 429059_430013
did we ⁇go⁇ anywhere xxx↗ 431461_432831
so: uh how often does this cycle happen↗ 432836_436042
yea so≈ 436025_436772
+≈ so 436772_437247
yea↗ 437247_437743
⁇go⁇ 437748_438180
so for example when a car engine is running is 438191_440180
this a constantly occuring cycle↗ or ∆does it∆ 440185_442105
only need to happen once↗ 442110_443252
+≈ no↘ it's a constantly occuring cycle↘ it's 443246_445193
like uh say usually we- you know RPM right↗ 445202_447335
like the ⌈revolution per minute↗ 447332_448746
mmh
that we can actually see in the cars→ 448973_450648
+≈ mhm 450648_450925
so if it is like two thousad RPM→ (0.4) if our 450930_453453
if our car is running on two thousand RPM→ 453458_455240
mhm 455240_455469
so this would be actually happening→ like 455474_457890
four thousand times↘ 457890_459111
o:k↘ 459120_459803
interesting↘ 460101_460645
so that's how it works↘ 460668_462455
ok↘ 462791_463079
so every cycle it needs to like (0.3) yea 463083_465664
so it actually really≈ 465669_466661
+≈ ⌈ok 466661_466885
⌊like all of this happens really fast↘ 466901_468640
mhm 468640_469190
within like the xxx actually↘ ◉this this is the◉ 469222_471408
the revolution↘ there it shows↘ 471402_472975
yea right↘≈ 472991_473652
+≈ so this is basically a four stroke engine so 473663_475551
that's why it is like multiplied by two→ 475545_477775
for a ⌈two stroke engine to be like exactly two 478003_479907
⌊right
two thousand times↘ 479903_480794
ok↘ 481114_481322
in a minute↘ 481332_481972
right right right 481972_482719
°yea° 483076_483465
um and the four terms≈ 483769_485444
+≈ yea↘≈ 485471_485716
+≈ you listed there↘ are they: types of 485724_487873
movements↗ 487884_488903
no these are not movements→ these are like 488621_490840
processes↘ 490859_491461
if I have a (0.4) if I have a syringe→ 491475_494131
you know ⌈syringe ⁇right⁇↗ 494147_495523
⌊mhm
so in a syringe uh so syringe has a piston→ 495519_498457
mhm≈ 498461_498813
+≈ and cylinder→ 498805_499840
so when I actually like um move it down→ 500160_503301
hm 503930_504090
the→ say if I have some uh whole here (0.3) 504088_507522
the pressure remains→ the pressure here and 507515_509424
pressure here will remain constant↘ 509424_510949
mhm 510960_511269
so when I actually push it down→ (0.3) the 511269_513317
volume is changing↘ 513317_514459
hm 514464_514672
but the pressure remains constant↘ that is the 514666_516085
isobaric process≈ 516090_516864
+≈ ah::≈ 516858_517189
+≈ so it's like ∆if if∆ it's always like a 517194_519429
reference to a system↘ 519423_520410
Like system can be→ usually a closed one↘ 520650_522837
or maybe physically it won't be closed but→ 522839_524668
(0.3) it can have imaginary boundaries↘ 524658_527452
and so with respect to that system in 527729_529825
⁇thermal dynamics⁇ you always say everything 529830_532134
with reference to that system↘ 532139_533526
uhuh 533526_533889
so in that (0.4) that system ∆the pressure is∆ 533902_536462
∆constant∆↘ isobaric↘ ∆in that system it's∆ 536460_538417
∆volume is constant∆↘ ∆is isochoric∆ ↘ 538412_539974
⌈mhm 539977_540377
⌊∆in that system if it's temperature is∆ 540394_541930

∆and adiabatic is when there is no heat∆ 543422_545091
∆addition∆ ↘
or heat ◉removal◉ from it↘ 545971_547438
hm 547736_548307
here it's not→ (0.4) th this is adiabatic but 548659_551326
this is not↘ because there is heat addition 551330_553298
to it↘ 553301_553802
mhm≈ 553824_554192
+≈ but that is ⁇already⁇ at a constant volume→ 554183_555879
