because Alex's initial idea to what makes a good quilt is he said
and then we kind of diverged we kind of went off on a tangent for a
besides pattern what else makes a quilt a good quilt ? 94905_100610
&=gasps . 100610_101960
or what does a quilter need to think about if they're trying to

okay so you don't like quilts that don't have designs ? 140585_142765

Katie and Sarah I don't want to have to stop again . 175578_180063
I want you listening to ideas and sharing with us not having a
three designs <that Katie gave us as> that Kelly gave us as
who can talk to me more about that word designs what does it mean
Amanda what do you think design means ? 199818_202168
um it means when you like have a have a like evening star . 202168_207608
okay Amanda says it means when you have something like evening
so evening star is one kind of design ? 211171_213441
what makes that a design ? 213441_215148
because it has like um two colors in it like it makes it more
okay it has two colors in it and it makes it more interesting for
so a design would use two colors ? 227120_229131
you could use any color you wanted to . 229131_231786

because I have a quilt for me on my bed that's only two colors and
and you're sure that quilt has designs . 266940_269891
mhmm okay so what created the designs what made the designs happen
okay so anytime I use two colors and make a quilt I've got designs .
you can use like any shapes any um kinds of color and any amount of
so I can use more than two colors and still get designs ? 291855_295026
mmhm . 295026_295900
so as long as I'm using more than one color whatever I make has
you can use one color and make a design . 300880_303766
you can use one color to make a quilt that has designs ? 303766_306673
