&-uh somewhere I think we should &-uh enter in one slide about the
that's about it . 7380_7870
but otherwise I think we're pretty good . 8980_10350
those slides are really good . 10400_11540
actually I was thinking it would probably be three slides . 13550_15530
but we talk about (th)em really fast . 15610_16740
'cause like one would be like . 18020_18660
&-um what factors do you use to make a match . 20170_23470
and then it'll be like your personality type and what like
mhm . 28900_29020
year and dating habits . 29450_30870
and then like another slide about how we determine your personality
and then another slide like how they're all weighted together . 36760_39260
and like . 39340_39500
and if we can have like a little diagram you know the one that like
and then that that branches out to like the two . 50860_52900
yeah . 53130_53330
that would probably be the slide about how you like how we make how
yeah . 59980_60080
we basically wanna make it look kind of complicated . 60740_62610
that'll like score at some points on . 64620_66270
Complic . 66960_67310
and so we can practice it tomorrow . 68290_69860
and then we can get feedback from Hyman &-um you know about how we
yeah . 75240_75440
for the and how we can for the . 75580_76820
presentation or whatever . 77040_77780
yeah . 78490_78620
what I thought . 85690_86680
presentation tomorrow right . 86700_88210
yeah . 89120_89240
well I mean like the faculty evaluation . 89260_91080
the final one . 92390_93070
when's that like May first week . 93490_95990
yeah . 96680_96750
they start the thirtieth of April . 98060_99550
what is it . 99920_100310
okay . 100400_100540
did you email him the password . 101880_103710
I just told him . 104040_104590
I told him our preferred times zero two three and four . 105150_107390
because I figured is that . 109250_110030
<on Sunday> on Sunday April twenty ninth when he does the
okay . 114870_114960
you mean security . 115910_116670
huh . 117620_117680
if we just . 120760_121130
&-um basically so you can't &-um look on top isn't that . 121150_125280
do you know what I'm saying . 125720_126190
you can change it around on the navigation . 126390_127720
you can change it . 128310_128750
I mean no I just wanna know what what . 128770_130270
well because I thought we were saying that because then they
et Cetera like . 135470_136100
that's when you use method equals to get . 137220_139110
no . 139970_140110
but also just regardless the frames like it high it masks the
find that out easily though . 144210_145120
yeah . 145470_145550
but I mean it makes it harder for like . 145760_147160
just like . 147210_147590
no . 147790_147870
you just right click again and then like view source . 147890_150150
okay . 150400_150670
it just comes out like that . 150880_151800
no . 152730_152790
you can just get a properties . 152810_153710
yeah . 153800_153880
it just shows it use . 154010_154860
just saying . 157210_157510
I'm just saying . 157870_158350
well . 158720_158810
then . 159010_159190
just then change the size . 159250_160910
just change it . 161280_161800
yeah . 161850_161960
you don't . 162330_162600
we don't want false information . 163470_164590
and most people don't go through the trouble of like you know going
if they wanted to though that's what he saying they wanted to . 169840_171760
it's really . 171840_172060
so then . 172230_172510
should we make our presentation the same way as before . 173210_175110
I think we did it . 176790_177400
fine . 177450_177590
last time . 177650_178110
honestly did it . 178690_179540
fine . 179560_179700
but it took up a_lot_of time not really because it took up a_lot_of
yeah . 185530_185620
but we need extra time . 185640_186540
we have to anticipate that as well because this is a bigger pool of
so they're they're gonna be asking a_lot_of questions too . 190410_192200
and Weinberg's pretty_much gonna stop us . 192900_194700
like every minute is that bastard . 194950_199310
it's gonna screw us over again . 199360_200390
yeah he . 200580_201030
oh my god . 201080_201670
that team the other team . 201720_202940
this could be bad . 204590_205070
what did he do . 205150_205710
he ripped him apart every single sentence . 206780_208790
should we talk . 209900_210240
he's not right . 210290_210710
should we talk about like these last three slides . 210920_212800
should we even mention that . 212820_213960
should we include . 216480_216880
