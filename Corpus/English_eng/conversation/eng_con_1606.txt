I see that the elephant is <a bounce> bouncing <three balls
and she is going to throw it into one of the hoops .
and then it felled into the water .
and then the zebra (i)s trying to swim and get it .
and then the elephant (i)s going to get the ball for him .
and then she (i)s smiling with her ball .
and that (i)s the end I think .
