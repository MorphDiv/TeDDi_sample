okay . 1094_1745
thank_you ladies for doing my experiment . 1745_3764
&-um what's what's gonna happen now is my experiment is how
&-um and so <the game> the name of the game is Mao . 12645_15915
and Mao is a game where you learn the rules by playing it in a trial
&-um usually the game is played with a full deck . 20600_22921
and there are a_lot more rules . 22921_24785
&-um I gave you a paired down version so we could go for a paired
&-um the rules were +... 29701_31311
partners in crime is when two of the same card are put down
that's xxx . 34441_35513
continuity is when &-uh a card increment of values is put down like
law of fours , you say +"/. 42653_43926
+" law of fours . 43926_44361
and it then gives the person whose turn it is after you four cards .
&-um law of fives is +... 48458_52088
actually wait . 52088_52497
can I hear what you think law of fives is &=points:par1 ? 52497_54032
&-um you have_to put down another card after you put down the five .
and what do you think law of fives is ? 57925_59288
what did you think ? 59288_59997
+< the the same thing . 59388_60671
mkay yes ‡ law of fives is where you put down the five you have_to
&-um Firstname can I hear what you thought have a nice day
&=laughs &-um so sometimes when they said +"/. 69470_73734
+< to the best of your ability . 70570_71903
+" put down the sevens . 73734_74552
you would say . 74552_74796
+" have a nice day . 74796_75706
and so I started doing that too . 75706_77296
+< &=laughs . 77096_77744
but <I wasn't> I didn't really know if that was correct . 77496_80678
and as I have literally no idea when else I should do it
+< &=laughs . 84947_85574
+< okay ‡ and what do you think have a nice day is ? 84947_86614
whenever you put down a seven you say +"/. 86614_88502
+" have a nice day . 88502_89401
and if the person before you put down a seven , you say +"/. 89401_92343
+" thank_you very much . 92343_93278
yes . 93278_93647
so ‡ seven is like seven days in a week . 93647_95709
so to have a nice day . 95709_96913
and then if you receive a seven , like <if it's your> if
+" thank_you very much . 100908_102637
&-uh what did you think crazy eights was , Firstname ? 102637_105781
I thought it was reverse the way we go &=ges:around . 105781_109950
but now I think it's like just the person before you goes . 109950_114211
&=ges and then it goes back to where you were . 114211_116592
and what did you think it was , Firstname ? 116592_118255
I thought it was always reversed in order . 118255_120410
&-um it's you skip the next person . 120410_122443
oh . 122443_123686
so ‡ in the game with like five or six you'd see that (be)cause only
because there's xxx . 127433_128830
+< yeah ‡ it was confusing when it was only three . 127633_129741
+< only a game of three . 128033_129756
yeah ‡ so the order was never reversed . 129756_131720
okay . 131720_132698
&-um what did you think bowling was ? 131920_137556
Firstname ? 137556_138525
&-um when the two cards +... 138525_140571
when so ‡ there's the card that's already there . 140571_142937
and if the card you're putting down makes those two cards add up to
yeah mkay . 147593_148603
so that's the game . 148603_149917
&-um what what rule did you get really fast , Firstname ? 149917_153854
what was the first rule you got ? 153854_155038
continuity . 155038_155969
and why do you think that was ? 155969_157174
because it that's pretty similar to games like
where you like try and <like it> like match cards that are like
like xxx one in numerical value . 166866_168968
and what rule was the hardest for you to get ? 168968_170768
&=laughs have a nice day . 170968_172783
+< &=laughs . 171268_172923
+< and why do you think that was ? 172683_174041
because it seemed completely arbitrary . 174041_176241
what it wasn't tied to any pattern that I could see in the
(o)kay . 179182_179644
&-um (be)cause I I just think I wasn't looking at like
I was looking for patterns . 184100_185482
okay . 185482_186341
&-um and what was the easiest rule for you to get ? 186341_188549
I_guess either continuity or partners in crime . 188549_191169
+< and why would you say so for you ? 190869_192628
(be)cause the names made sense . 192628_194265
okay ‡ and what was the hardest xxx ? 194265_196329
+< (be)cause like they defined it . 194865_196723
&-um spare because you introduced it in the last game . 196723_201727
mkay . 201727_202317
&-um and why do you think +/. 202517_203857
again because I introduced in the last game you didn't have time to
+< yeah . 205217_206117
okay ‡ &-um what did you +/? 206117_207871
why do you think law of fives was &+interes like kind_of hard to get
(be)cause you had_to be watching . 212523_214291
like I don't know &-um +... 214291_220394
+< hm . 214291_214782
I don't know . 220394_220696
<I_guess you> I I_guess with that rule you just had to pay
&=throat:clears . 224781_225230
about the other rules . 225230_226398
and why was the law of fives hard for you ? 226398_228142
I kept forgetting you need to also put down a card . 228142_230412
so I understood that it was similar to law of fours . 230712_232699
but it was like I'd forget to put down a card . 232699_235238
okay . 235238_236245
so yeah ‡ thank_you thank_you so much for doing this for me . 236245_239484
&-um +/. 239484_239993
+< can we play again &=laughs ? 239593_241520
no . 241520_242042
