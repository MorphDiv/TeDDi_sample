b@l to m@l . 0_951
okay . 951_2151
so when we have our base in here being raised to a power, each individual term is raised to that power . 2151_13278
so we get +... 13278_14446
a@l to the m@l, b@l to the m@l . 14446_22573
okay . 22573_24483
and remember when we have two variables next to each other, they're being multiplied . 24483_28355
okay . 28355_30621
so there's the third rule of exponents for multiplication that you need to know . 30621_37053
okay . 37053_37911
when we have the same base being raised to a power, we just add the powers . 37911_43118
when we have a base raised to a power, raised to a power, we multiply the exponents . 43118_50070
when we have two terms raised to a power within parentheses, we raise each term to that power . 50070_57701
okay . 57701_58245
so now, let's work on some division . 58245_61966
let's think about this . 61966_63725
we're going to expand this, so this is two, times two, times two, times two . 63725_69395
and two squared is two times two . 69395_72763
okay . 72763_73508
what is two over two equal to ? 73508_75740
one . 75740_76626
one . 76626_76996
one . 76996_77245
and what is two over two equal to ? 77245_80381
one . 80381_81065
one . 81065_81486
so what are we left with ? 81486_83246
two . 83246_84046
we're left with one square, which is what ? 84046_86150
four . 86150_86750
one squared . 86750_87008
one, right ? 87008_87863
one, yeah . 87863_88526
okay . 88526_89011
and two squared . 89011_92093
right ? 92093_92365
so +... 92365_94240
so +... 94240_95131
what do we do with the one ? 95131_96141
okay . 96141_96430
shh . 96430_96873
multiply it . 96873_99318
okay . 99318_99773
we take our two to the fourth power, we expand it out two times two, times two, times two . 99773_105986
our denominator is two squared, so it's two times two . 105986_110756
and we know that a number divided by itself is always one . 110756_114915
so this becomes one and this becomes one, and one times one is one . 114915_119306
right ? 119306_119771
and one times two is two . 119771_121535
so the ones there, we just don't have to write it . 121535_124956
so what are we left with ? 124956_126851
two times two, or two squared . 126851_129468
right ? 129468_129916
that's all you write ? 129916_130465
okay . 130465_131138
now, what is this saying ? 131138_134761
this is saying I have four over two how many times ? 134761_138986
three . 138986_139470
three times . 139470_142578
so how many fours do I have ? 142578_146403
three . 146403_147268
and how many twos do I have ? 147268_149018
three . 149018_150295
oh, that's pretty easy . 150295_151245
okay . 151245_151543
that's all we have to do ? 151543_152198
so do section four and come up with a rule for me . 152198_156815
section four, problems ten through twelve . 156815_158956
oh my gosh . 158956_160798
I feel so stupid xxx . 160798_161525
how does this one look ? 161525_163158
for section xxx ? 163158_164108
a@l to the sixth for a@l squared . 164108_167181
that's wrong . 167181_168516
isn't it a@l +... 168516_170231
how many a@l . 170231_170886
look it . 170886_171350
if these are ones . 171350_171911
right ? 171911_172270
mm hmm . 172270_172783
how many a@l do you have left ? 172783_174743
four . 174743_175320
and he wrote three . 175320_177525
oh . 177525_178086
I wrote three, too . 178086_179358
okay . 179358_179726
and look at these . 179726_180415
a@l to the fourth over a@l to the one . 180415_182798
a@l over a@l is one . 182798_184743
right ? 184743_185093
so how many a@l would be left ? 185093_186485
two . 186485_187368
three . 187368_187796
two . 187796_188790
three, cause right there . 188790_190006
two . 190006_190508
one, two, three . 190508_191476
yeah . 191476_192230
three ? 192230_193110
yeah, cause there's three . 193110_194983
help each other out . 194983_195966
see if you come up with a rule on that one . 195966_197965
a@l to the fourth power . 197965_199768
how do we do xxx, like that ? 199768_202016
yes, Tiffany ? 202016_207728
I don't understand how to do that one . 207728_210343
okay . 210343_210926
so how many a@l do I need to write out here ? 210926_212848
four six . 212848_214168
six . 214168_214623
so write out a@l six A's . 214623_216320
okay . 216320_217126
this is +... 217126_218641
Cynthia ? 218641_221126
uhhuh ? 221126_221705
did you get a@l to third ? 221705_222518
a@l to the fourth . 222518_223558
right ? 223558_224278
okay . 224278_224973
and what's it being divided by ? 224973_226325
a@l to the second . 226325_227895
okay . 227895_228431
so put your division line . 228431_231310
and then how many A's are you gonna write ? 231310_235413
two . 235413_236005
two . 236005_236470
okay . 236470_237030
now a@l over a@l becomes what ? 237030_240925
one . 240925_242228
one . 242228_242718
and a@l over a@l becomes what ? 242718_243943
one . 243943_244468
so +... 244468_245015
okay . 245015_246390
and how many a@l do you have left ? 246390_250341
four . 250341_251115
four . 251115_251693
okay . 251693_252190
so wouldn't it be a@l to the fourth ? 252190_255043
so it's two a@l squared ? 255043_255620
why is it two a@l ? 255620_256963
what's one times one ? 256963_257508
one . 257508_258404
one . 258404_258748
and what's one times a@l to the fourth ? 258748_260948
a@l to the fourth ? 260948_262523
a@l fourth . 262523_263011
a@l fourth . 263011_263515
so then it's just a@l to the fourth . 263515_266378
he was the smart one . 266378_267515
(be)cause isn't that your multiplication ? 267515_268601
one times one is one . 268601_269596
one times a@l is a@l . 269596_271253
and a@l times a@l is a@l squared . 271253_273778
and a@l times +... 273778_274778
oh, okay . 274778_275715
okay . 275715_276460
okay, I got it . 276460_278428
yes ? 278428_279186
would you add these together, the four and the four xxx ? 279186_284055
okay . 284055_284415
if you have a@l to the fourth up top, why do we have a@l to the fourth on the bottom ? 284415_288568
what's the denominator ? 288568_289813
oh, xxx . 289813_291640
how many a@l are supposed to be down there ? 291640_292848
okay . 292848_293280
okay . 293280_293686
is this right, Miss Scott ? 293686_294895
did you do a@l to the sixth and a@l to the xxx ? 294895_298110
okay . 298110_298373
is this a@l to the fourth ? 298373_298956
uhhuh . 298956_299451
what's left here ? 299451_300406
I still don't get how it's down by four . 300406_302613
okay . 302613_303933
what's this ? 303933_304436
a@l over a@l ? 304436_305060
one . 305060_305701
okay . 305701_306255
and what's this ? 306255_306885
one . 306885_307461
okay . 307461_308156
and what's this ? 308156_308941
four . 308941_309535
okay . 309535_310021
a@l to the fourth . 310021_310676
right ? 310676_311156
what's one times one ? 311156_311718
one . 311718_313195
and what's one times a@l to the fourth ? 313195_314995
a@l to the fourth . 314995_316835
oh, I got the rule now . 316835_320493
okay . 320493_321020
you get does that make sense to you ? 321020_322003
yeah . 322003_322335
Miss Scott, is this right ? 322335_323100
did you get a@l to the sixth on top and then a@l +... 323100_325196
squared on the bottom . 325196_325986
yep . 325986_326365
and then +... 326365_326948
yep . 326948_327893
does the answer equal a@l to the +... 327893_329460
and this one's a@l . 329460_330556
right ? 330556_331043
(be)ause +... 331043_331501
okay . 331501_332346
and see if you can find the rule now . 332346_333676
see if you can find the rule . 333676_335801
okay . 335801_336345
let's look at problem +... 336345_338483
you just add them . 338483_339170
you just add them . 339170_339705
problem number ten . 339705_341923
dominic, what did you get for the answer to problem number ten ? 341923_347413
a@l to the fourth . 347413_348416
a@l to the fourth . 348416_348721
okay . 348721_349250
Sam, on number eleven, what answer did you get ? 349250_350991
a@l to the third . 350991_352313
a@l cubed . 352313_353303
okay . 353303_353905
and on number twelve . 353905_356111
Chelsea, what did you get ? 356111_357835
a@l . 357835_358425
a@l . 358425_358888
okay . 358888_359825
do we have a rule ? 359825_360921
we have a rule ? 360921_362528
Lucia ? 362528_363111
a@l to the m@l minus n@l . 363111_366118
a@l to the m@l minus n@l . 366118_369088
so you're saying that when I have a base to an exponent and it's the same base, we take the exponents +... 369088_378305
we take the numerator and we subtract the denominator from it . 378305_383238
okay ? 383238_383896
yeah . 383896_384450
does that make sense ? 384450_385633
yeah . 385633_386201
okay . 386201_387248
very good . 387248_388303
so now you've got the fourth rule . 388303_390280
we've only got one more rule to learn . 390280_391943
okay . 391943_392913
now on this one, on this rule we need to take these and expand them out this way so that you can see the rule develop . 392913_402360
okay . 402360_403320
so go ahead and do thirteen through fifteen quickly . 403320_405273
oh . 405273_406321
yes ? 406321_409078
I need help . 409078_409840
how do you get it ? 409840_411440
oh yes, I do . 411440_412200
okay . 412200_412741
okay . 412741_414811
so first you expand it out, right ? 414811_416611
you get a@l times a@l, times a@l, over b@l times b@l, times b@l . 416611_421581
so wouldn't it equal a@l over b@l ? 421581_424623
I don't know . 424623_426010
well, how many A's do you have ? 426010_426685
three . 426685_427088
so how do you write that ? 427088_428061
oh, so it wouldn't be a@l cubed over b@l cubed ? 428061_431943
okay . 431943_432878
looks good to me . 432878_434343
try the next one and see if you see a pattern develop . 434343_436655
a@l times xxx . 436655_439301
that was really, really xxx . 439301_441178
b@l times b@l . 441178_444211
so now, what would that equal ? 444211_444868
zero, or would it just equal a@l ? 444868_446555
yeah . 446555_447116
yes . 447116_447491
Miss Scott, am I doing this right ? 447491_448348
Miss Scott, on number thirteen, would it be a@l over b@l or would it just be zero ? 448348_452683
(be)cause they all +... 452683_453531
okay . 453531_453925
well, what what is you have a@l divided by b@l, right ? 453925_456603
and what power is it being raised to ? 456603_459386
okay . 459386_459843
to three . 459843_460401
three . 460401_460978
so it's a@l over +... 460978_461941
third . 461941_462401
so, it'd be, right ? 462401_465330
okay . 465330_465980
but those both &~canc the thirds cancel out so it'd just be a@l over b@l ? 465980_470906
they do . 470906_471401
couldn't it be one ? 471401_472225
how do you know that ? 472225_473250
I don't know because they're they're both to the third power . 473250_476076
because +... 476076_476501
okay . 476501_476756
but what's to the third power ? 476756_478358
but you don't know . 478358_478918
a@l ? 478918_479515
a@l and b@l . 479515_480188
so it's still so they're different . 480188_481533
so it's just a@l over b@l . 481533_482516
okay . 482516_483061
are they like terms ? 483061_483803
nn hnh . 483803_484965
so can we combine unlike terms ? 484965_486740
nn hnh . 486740_487261
no . 487261_487756
so then they're in simplest form, then . 487756_489603
right ? 489603_490138
okay . 490138_490475
yeah . 490475_490660
okay . 490660_491203
so what was the last answer if they're in simplest form ? 491203_495100
it's a@l to the third, b@l to the third . 495100_498010
why +... 498010_498611
but Miss Scott, did you say +... 498611_501208
couldn't that still be a@l over b@l though ? 501208_501440
Miss Scott ? 501440_502988
yes, I'm listening, Lucia . 502988_504228
you said it was xxx like, this is all one . 504228_507150
didn't you, because +... 507150_508893
okay . 508893_509181
so so how many a@l do you have ? 509181_510958
three . 510958_511803
oh . 511803_512155
a@l cubed and b@l cubed . 512155_513580
right . 513580_513909
okay . 513909_514748
now, let's say I had a@l on the bottom to go to your point . 514748_520914
(be)cause you were saying the threes cancel out . 520914_522986
okay . 522986_523578
what if I had a@l cubed over a@l cubed ? 523578_525401
what would I have ? 525401_525998
then that would cancel out and it would be these here . 525998_528880
right ? 528880_529285
or no . 529285_529580
(be)cause they're both +... 529580_531956
what's a@l what what's what's a@l over a@l ? 531956_534693
oh . 534693_535275
oh . 535275_535868
it would still be +... 535868_536906
a@l over +... 536906_537483
what's a@l over a@l equal ? 537483_538876
one . 538876_539283
if I had three of those, what would I have ? 539283_541343
three . 541343_541683
one . 541683_542778
well what's one times one times one ? 542778_544256
a@l to the third . 544256_546328
one . 546328_546553
oh . 546553_546760
one . 546760_547073
one . 547073_547408
one, yeah . 547408_547816
one . 547816_548248
three . 548248_549096
okay . 549096_549751
so if if the denominator was the same variable as the numerator, yes, we could simplify it . 549751_555425
mh hmm . 555425_555890
but you can't simplify it because it's a different term . 555890_557831
right ? 557831_558128
mm hm . 558128_559278
okay . 559278_559655
quickly now, let's go . 559655_561263
number thirteen . 561263_563718
what is our answer, Robert ? 563718_567376
