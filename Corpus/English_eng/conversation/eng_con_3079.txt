yes . 4580_4690
that's one . 5620_6270
and where is the next one . 7340_8710
yes . 15140_15170
uhhuh . 15980_16100
and . 16379_16550
so how many . 19240_19620
three . 20650_20950
are they all the same . 21500_22460
no . 24580_24740
which one is different . 25050_25890
oh how is it different . 27860_28940
because it has that like the star . 29230_32400
these ones don't . 33500_34020
do you think that &-uh for the middle one that is different . 34770_37110
&-uh is it different because &-uh she did something different to
or is it different because she was using something else . 42680_45820
it's I think maybe a different four square . 48990_51800
uhhuh . 53360_53590
'cause &-um this course square . 56700_57660
there's only one one . 57680_59090
and here there's two . 59380_60550
uhhuh . 61530_61620
and on here there's only one right . 63500_64940
and here there's two . 65190_65910
so can you go around the course square that she might be using on
yeah . 71900_71980
on this middle one . 72080_72620
where's where's the course square . 73040_74620
here you think . 74790_75590
okay . 77750_77860
now how did she make her design . 78040_79260
then for the two by two . 79280_80580
&-uh for that two by two . 81620_82990
uhhuh . 83210_83270
well <for this> for this two by two . 83940_85740
how can you describe . 86020_86740
well she &-um . 88350_89290
she . 90140_90150
kept two . 91030_92040
she says . 93060_93250
she put one down like this . 94340_98900
and she put another one down like . 99680_101020
uhhuh . 101170_101310
that . 101950_102140
okay . 102390_102570
yeah I I see I guess I'm asking a little different question . 102840_105590
is it this here's the core square . 105700_107880
right . 108080_108190
yeah . 108390_108550
now with this square . 109300_110580
how does that relate to the core square . 111180_113100
what did she do . 113230_113900
she did the core . 114480_115390
square . 115440_115700
she did an up down flip . 116660_118670
are you sure . 119880_120340
are you sure she did that . 120700_122060
is that . 122670_122900
<let me> let me see . 123020_123940
I'm having trouble visualizing it . 123980_125310
can you kind of go through it to help me in my mind . 125690_128860
I don't know . 134960_135430
hmm . 143200_143620
what's another way . 143230_143620
she could have done it . 143730_144380
&-uh she could have . 145410_146270
there's usually several ways . 146990_147980
right . 148010_148280
that's possible . 149590_150230
they did the same thing . 150770_151460
&-um . 151500_151650
right one . 155290_156190
fourth . 156240_156620
could have turned right . 157610_158660
and where would that have gone . 158780_159820
show me . 160000_160220
I mean left . 160400_160730
oh left . 161150_161550
one fourth . 161660_161940
show me what that means in terms . 162470_163890
left . 164870_165110
left one fourth . 166090_167150
so that would move down to here . 167480_169140
okay . 171590_171830
left one fourth . 173450_174310
what did you think she did . 175870_176900
from here to here . 177310_178140
no . 178500_178670
from this core square to this core . 179630_181020
square . 181160_181380
or this . 182570_182840
well this core square . 183150_184220
that's something to that one . 184520_186050
she did a dal flip . 188060_190270
yeah . 197050_197190
she could . 197420_197560
mhm . 198780_199060
well it's hard for me to see . 199590_206280
so if you flip that over like that . 214080_216180
where would these white ones be . 217020_218340
right here . 221570_221870
it looks like the red one would be there . 223860_225700
isn't it . 226010_226340
if you flipped it over . 226710_227620
the d will flip I'd imagine isn't it . 228620_232820
I don't know too hard to imagine . 234550_236560
too hard to imagine . 237310_238030
would it help if you had a core score like that . 239010_241020
okay . 243170_243310
okay . 246550_246790
good . 247240_247350
this looks great . 247680_248190
you're doing a nice job on that too . 248750_249670
thanks . 251820_252160
Brittany . 252520_252710
yeah . 253430_253510
that's Brittany what are you going to do next . 253560_264680
I how did you decide on this . 269840_272270
this Core square . 272950_273660
&-uh . 274340_274350
is this your core square here . 274860_275950
yeah . 276350_276590
sorry . 277540_277670
uhhuh . 279340_279410
and I'm I'm like gonna turn this around . 280500_285540
I'm gonna make another one . 286540_287270
and I turn . 287420_287610
it turn . 288040_289410
so you're gonna use turns . 290320_291740
yeah . 292270_292410
turns to which direction . 292720_294140
I'll turn . 297310_297910
oh yeah . 298990_299200
well I'll just say I'll turn . 299590_301270
I'll make another one . 303900_304530
and I'll make it . 304800_305260
so like this point could be pointing this way . 305560_307990
I mean I'll turn this . 308750_310180
so what's . 311490_311870
it called though turn which way is that . 311920_314310
&-um . 314900_315060
turn sideways . 315710_316540
I'll go sideways . 317550_318190
turn what I got from this . 318580_319710
I'll . 323590_323640
do three three more sideways . 323880_326050
sideways turns to get it . 327960_329070
and then &-um let's see . 329460_331780
imagine . 332220_332470
so it goes this way and then again this way and again this way . 333330_338180
okay . 339230_339430
so how you going to know of that . 340220_343230
which level &-uh shape goes where . 343770_346190
well I imagine it if it turned . 348070_349870
uhhuh . 350630_350730
and I'm imagining it if it was turning . 351230_353380
and I cannot I I can tell that this square would be right here
would &-um . 358650_359230
be right here . 359700_360140
okay . 362540_362740
so you can keep track of all that . 362780_364310
yeah . 364870_364980
in your head . 366010_366350
what . 366750_366910
size of turn . 367040_367740
would that be what would be . 367760_370780
how how much would you turn . 371120_372380
one fourth . 373460_373910
mm . 374780_374790
mhm . 375280_375500
good . 378470_378590
he used a_lot_of different &-uh triangles and little squares . 378820_381590
that's an interesting pattern . 382300_383310
he made it up . 383600_384130
great . 392570_392840
thanks . 393140_393490
so what are you guys doing . 403730_404500
we're calling our color . 404890_405830
because . 407390_407570
we're done with all our work . 407900_408670
oh oh have you guys made the . 409390_411500
&-uh . 413260_413310
Christmas . 414400_414630
quilt . 414960_415130
uhhuh . 415420_415620
mine's mine's one of those up there . 416290_418140
oh I see . 418330_418820
well they're like . 418880_421670
hey . 422900_422980
Sarah . 424370_424700
can you bring &-uh your &-uh two by two design for to us . 424860_428280
and explain what you were doing . 428500_430510
this where it says . 431190_432230
Sarah above that one . 432280_433180
no . 433420_433590
but the one that you just made the . 433740_435110
new one . 435160_435360
did you make a new one today . 435620_436660
&-um yeah . 437010_437500
and it's on my desk . 438210_439110
okay . 439910_440040
yeah . 442630_442750
did you . 445980_446230
have you finished one too . 446280_447150
yep . 447260_447360
that's fine . 448260_448670
I like mine . 448880_449660
oh well lemme see . 450110_450820
can I see what what it is here . 451060_452500
I'll go get mine . 452670_453140
okay . 453640_453820
good man . 453840_454350
thanks . 454400_454710
&-um where's your core . 456000_458020
square . 458040_458300
oh . 458700_458750
my core square is is right &-um is right here and where the
this is the regular &-um thing . 467350_469980
I used . 470120_470460
no . 470830_470940
this is the regular one . 471000_472110
while it starts facing out . 472530_474270
I have yellow green . 475320_476110
this one's this is your core square here in this corner . 476400_479300
&-uh . 479780_479830
uhhuh . 480410_480500
and then what did you do to get to this one . 480600_482950
&-um sideways foot . 483170_484220
sideways flip . 485160_485660
okay . 486040_486130
and how_about from this core square to this one up here . 486340_490980
&-um diagonal &-um &-um up . 491660_494540
yeah . 494940_495060
diagonal foot . 495120_495900
diagonal foot . 496160_496870
oh how_about from this core square up to this one . 497140_499960
up down foot . 500980_501710
okay . 503270_503390
is there . 504580_504810
I to wear the crays . 505080_505760
trying to you see is there . 506540_507820
do you see any symmetry in this one . 507860_509510
yes . 511660_513090
we tree the colors around . 511700_512820
do you see any symmetry in this one . 514179_515630
&-um . 516140_516309
you said . 517059_517299
did you make it try and make it symmetrical . 517320_518909
&-um I'm . 519830_520179
trying to see . 520200_520510
it is symmetrical . 521460_522179
what . 522630_522900
which way is this symmetrical . 522919_524430
oh that way is it symmetrical . 525540_527700
any other way . 527720_528190
uhuh . 528790_528900
yeah it's . 529870_530350
that way . 533910_534230
okay . 534460_534630
glue down for good . 536760_537830
this one's just good . 538030_539310
that's good . 540260_540580
copy core copy cord . 543520_544380
copy .
copy core . 544710_545230
copy core . 545990_546420
okay . 546550_546820
and copy . 547160_547420
alright . 548370_548540
I'm trying to see if there's anything symmetrical . 548700_550790
there . 550840_551020
these are hard to imagine . 551170_551970
aren't is . 552160_552850
it symmetrical . 552960_553830
not that's not symmetrical . 554340_555540
mine is symmetrical . 556300_557340
oh . 557860_557890
yeah . 558260_558390
do you know what &-uh Amanda or Sarah what would Amanda have had t
