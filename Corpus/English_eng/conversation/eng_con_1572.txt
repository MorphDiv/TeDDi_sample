this part of the fire he says Jimmy says well I 'll put a label on
well that 's commonsense . 811553_813313
he said well that 's the trouble you could break the . 813323_815193
I would say that 's dangerous . 815313_816153

six inch . 883883_884513
put one of them metal things in . 884823_886633
and you put a grid on each side like a plastic grid you know . 886813_890463
oh yeah mm mm I know . 890623_891523
and there was only these er little screws more like a nail with a a

the griding that brick in . 948133_949623
mm mm . 949763_950243
but er that is the trouble half of these are not been put in
well it it could cause the many a could n't it . 957003_960603
and that 's I 'm sure I put over the years . 960613_962293
Mm . 962293_962443
where you 're sitting in and she used to nod away . 962443_965543

where you been I says where you been aye he says aye he says my
Well it 's sensible cos it 's certainly . 1027623_1029873
cos it was n't it was n't that cold you know in the room so I says
it seems fairly warm I still think it 's nice and warm . 1038233_1040993
Well you do n't get much draught cos the fr well the front door see
yeah mm mm . 1046333_1046993
you come in our front door there that was a passage when you get a
it 's what you call straight through to the very end of the mm mm .
you see . 1058313_1058533
mm mm . 1058713_1059123
door one door to another door . 1059233_1061213
that 's right . 1061213_1062023
you get a straight through draught from the front door through the
not do . 1067023_1067483
and then it goes through to the back now his although it looks . 1067483_1072473
similar . 1072473_1072533
the same as our house when you open the door here . 1072533_1077633
mm . 1077633_1077883
his front door the same you 've got er the stairs going up there .

but when you go into the passage his door he 's got the door into
oh yeah mm . 1105213_1106743
so he does n't get a straight through draught like me . 1107123_1111843
no you not do . 1111843_1114103
by having that wall at the bottom . 1114103_1116263
that 's right of course . 1116263_1116743
the draught always follows where there a you know two doors . 1116913_1122063
mm mm . 1122263_1123033
two windows open . 1123033_1124133
that 's true . 1124133_1125163
