there was a little boy and a dog with a frog .
and &-um the dog was looking .
okay that's great .
then the boy and dog went to sleep .
and the frog snuck out_of its jar .
and the next morning the dog and the boy woke up .
and it wasn't there .
then the dog looked in the bowl where it should have been .
but it wasn't there .
and the boy looked in his shoes .
but it wasn't there either .
then they looked outside out &-um his window and see if he was out
then the dog fell out the window with the jar on his head .
and then the boy hadta go get him .
then they went to go &-um looking for him .
they called for him and called for him .
but he didn't come .
then the &-um boy went looking in a hole .
but he wasn't there either .
and the dog looked .
let me see .
is that a bee hive ?
yes it looks like a bee hive .
<then he looked> &-um <looking> the dog went looking into
but it wasn't there either .
and then the boy &-um sniffed something ?
but <the dog> because it was a bee hive all the bees went
and the dog was trying to get away .
then the boy was looking in a tree where there was a hole .
and inside that hole was a owl .
and it hit the boy .
and the boy went tumbling down .
and still the bees were chasing the dog .
and then the boy went back to looking for it some more .
and then the boy saw some antlers and a rock .
and got up on the rock and called from there .
and <it> the antlers belonged to a deer .
and the deer lift the kid up and ran it off a cliff with the dog .
and they went tumbling down this cliff and into water .
and they &-um both landed into a lake .
and they were &-um landed close to the land .
and they swam to the land .
and they saw a log .
and they probably heard the frog sounds .
and they looked on the other side of the log .
and it was the frogs back there .
and then they were watching the frog and its son .
and then he took the frog back and then went back across the water
www .
it looks like the boy is calling and thinking +"/.
+" where is that frog ?
and the dog is looking for it .
you're right that is what's going on .
and also maybe we could say that the boy can't see the frog because
that would kind of be like a why sentence .
one night there was a boy and a frog and a dog .
and the dog was probably wondering what was in the jar .
and probably the boy said it was a frog .
great .
and then the boy and the dog went to sleep .
and the frog probably said maybe I could escape because they are
and then the next morning the dog and the boy waked .
and the frog was gone .
they were probably thinking where was the frog ?
was it like under the bed or someplace ?
that probably is what he was thinking .
and how did he feel when he didn't see the frog ?
he feeled I don't know .
well I guess it's hard to say .
then like the boy was probably thinking where was the frog .
and he was looking in his shoes .
and the dog looked in the &-um jar that he was in got his head
probably thought where was the frog .
probably did .
then the dog stuck his head out the window .
<the boy and> they didn't see him .
they were probably thinking that they were sad .
they probably were .
and it looks like he was saying something there .
I wonder what he is saying ?
where are you frog or something like that .
yeah .
then the dog fell out the window .
and the &-um boy was probably mad at it because they wanted to keep
the boy just goes to get it .
then they went off to look for the frog some more .
and then they went looks like into a forest .
and they were calling frog frog or something like that .
and it looks like the dog was sniffing to pick up the frog .
it does .
and then the boy looked into a hole .
and he didn't see anything .
and the dog saw a bee hive .
and he probably thought it might be in there .
and so he hit it .
and all the bees came out .
and then an animal came out and hit him on the nose .
is that why he has his hands on his nose ?
and the bees were still after the dog .
<and> the &-um animal that hit him on the nose was probably
mhm you think so ?
then the boy went into <the> a hole in a tree and thought
but he wasn't .
he was probably thinking where could it be ?
yeah and is he saying anything more ?
well I'm not sure .
then &-um <he the &-um one side is> where the hole was in the
and he went down on the ground .
but all the bees were still going after the dog .
so he wasn't looking .
then he went off cause his head was hurting from when he fell down
the owl hit him .
and then he got up on a rock and called and holded onto the antler
but he didn't probably realize what it was .
and then it was a deer .
and deer took off running at the dog I think off the cliff .
and they went down .
and they went down ?
I wonder how the boy feels when he's stuck on the deer's head ?
probably scared .
mhm .
and then they went tumbling down the cliff and land into a lake .
and then they fell .
and they swam to land .
and why does he have his hand up to his ear ?
he's probably listening if he heard any sound .
and he did .
and <she went> he went shh: to the dog .
so it wouldn't make any sound .
and then it looked over the log and saw that there were all frogs
and so they took the frog back <and &-um> from the other
mhm and how does he feel now ?
happy .
then he went swimming back from the log with the dog .
and I wonder what he's saying to the frogs over here .
bye maybe
