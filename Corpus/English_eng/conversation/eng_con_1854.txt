Yes heavy thick rubber skirt and that the engines do two things
Keeps dry . 1946893_1947093
keeps a cushion of air under the vessel so that really it hovers on
Oh . 1958613_1958763
but it skims across the surface of the water and it 's very quick
Mm . 1971203_1971343
Right er from Swanage to Ventnor is thirty two miles so how long

Colin 's dad 's got a boat . 1981693_1983443
Has he And how long would it take to go round the Isle of Wight
Er erm fifteen . 1998813_1999983
Fifteen hours right Right D two how long does it take to go from
Oh Ventnor where 's Ventnor Ah twenty two miles four . 2022583_2031913
Right . 2034113_2034293
four hours . 2035033_2036513
Right now you get the answer to D two by dividing the distance by
Mm . 2046043_2046483
thirty two 's the distance divided by the speed which is eight
I need a calculator Ooh . 2072303_2074883
How many hours does it take to go seven hundred and five miles at
Fifteen hours . 2086933_2088873
Right . 2088913_2089013
This is fun I like talking into This diagram shows the reach or an
Beirut to . 2114133_2114743
to Bombay at four thousand kilometres Its speed is about eight
Eight hundred and . 2121763_2123733
fifty . 2125123_2125503
fifty . 2125503_2125563
kilometres per hour to work out the time it takes we do four
To be as exact as that . 2140423_2141703
because the distance is . 2141703_2142793
because the d not exactly four thousand miles and the speed is not
The nearest whole number of hours is good enough The nearest whole
The nearest whole number to four point seven the wh nearest whole
Mm . 2177592_2177603
is n't it If that 's five or more then you pu increase that by one
Bombay to Perth eight . 2216733_2218993

Two thousand two hundred right . 2234153_2241283
Four hours . 2241673_2250083
Right . 2250993_2251233
London to . 2251933_2253023
London to Geneva . 2253133_2254573
Oh . 2254653_2255323
Geneva . 2255483_2255713
Geneva hundred and fifty One hour . 2257803_2267773
Right . 2270023_2270233
It only takes half an hour to go to Austria does n't it No it takes
No it takes an hour and a half . 2279563_2294983
Mm yeah It takes four hours to get to Lanzarote Six hours . 2301973_2306073
Good Right . 2306073_2306343
E . 2306343_2306783
Now this is quite important you 've got to think about this
Mm . 2341563_2341953
right Erm fifteen minutes nought point two five Forty five minutes
Four . 2369353_2369603
three is n't it Just over three . 2369612_2371683
Mm yeah . 2371963_2374493
Right So it says this scale shows both minutes and decimals and now
Ten point . 2391963_2394583
No nought point three's there look . 2394583_2396343
Mm . 2397213_2397333
now you want to read off the top of the scale for minutes . 2397333_2400563
Fifteen minutes . 2400643_2401553
That 's ten minutes . 2401563_2402753
Yeah . 2402953_2403193
that 's twenty minutes that 's fifteen minutes . 2403203_2407133
Mm . 2407133_2407343
what 's each of those little divisions . 2407353_2410553
One minute . 2410553_2411283
Right so point three . 2411733_2413293
Fifteen minut er fif eighteen minutes . 2414923_2417833
Eighteen minutes right B nought point seven five of an hour . 2418823_2428253
There forty five minutes . 2428253_2429243
Forty five minutes C nought point four three hours nought point
Oh . 2446483_2446663
four . 2446913_2447133
Nought point . 2447383_2448693
four three . 2451753_2453203
There . 2453212_2453223
That 's right well what 's that . 2453223_2458163
Twenty and six minutes . 2458953_2459663
Si twenty six minutes And nought point nought five of an hour . 2459663_2470093
There . 2471383_2471483
Mhm in minutes . 2471483_2474313
Three . 2474313_2474513
Three minutes Then E change these to decimals of an hour twenty
Nought point four . 2486363_2487293
Nought point four Fifty one minutes . 2487293_2495503
Nought point eight five . 2495503_2496793
Nought point five good Five minutes . 2496793_2505853
Nought point nought point nought eight . 2507323_2512513
Right And thirty five minutes . 2512993_2518943
Nought point five eight . 2519023_2529083
Right Right well we 'll just do this then you can have a go on the
Mm . 2549243_2549383
we can find the train 's average speed like this change forty two
Nought point seven . 2561923_2563863
Right From the scale above forty two minutes equals nought point
Mm . 2570693_2570953
that means the journey time is two point seven hours two hours
Mm . 2581783_2581853
divide the distance by the time hundred and forty three divided by
Fifty three . 2596323_2596583
So the average speed is about fifty three miles per hour . 2596583_2601823
Oh . 2601823_2602143
So do the first one here . 2602143_2604483
Okay . 2604483_2604853
D two London to Bristol a hundred and eighteen miles at one hour
Nought point f n nought point four five So one hour p one hour
One point four five . 2622613_2633853
Yeah Nought point one nought . 2633933_2640273
So that 's the average speed . 2640283_2647243
Yeah er . 2647553_2647853
What did you do wrong . 2647853_2650233
Divided it . 2651283_2652083
Yes but what did you divide by what . 2652083_2657553
Divided a hundred and eighteen by . 2657553_2659903
No you did n't . 2659903_2661273
Oh . 2661273_2661703
you divided one point . 2661703_2664333
Oh no . 2664333_2665023
four five by a hundred and eighteen . 2665103_2668303
Oh . 2668303_2668493
So what have you got to do . 2668493_2669923
Hundred and eighteen . 2670193_2671593
Right divided by . 2671593_2672603
by I 've forgotten what it was now . 2672612_2675293
One point four five . 2675293_2680283
Aha . 2680292_2680303
What 's that . 2680303_2682473
Eighty one . 2682683_2685073
Right miles per hour . 2685073_2687343
Yeah . 2687393_2687863
Now just for interest 's sake do what you did before divide . 2688383_2694433
Okay . 2694433_2694813
one point four five by one one eight equals now . 2694813_2701403
0 .
that 's the wrong way you 've done it the wrong way have n't you .
Mm . 2708803_2709213
So push that button . 2709813_2714773
Oh Oh It 's turned it the other way round . 2714773_2718143
It 's the reciprocal button . 2718143_2720303
Oh . 2720953_2721053
and a half one over two the reciprocal of a half if you turn it the
Yes . 2729873_2730043
so it 's two . 2730053_2732943
Mm . 2732943_2733403
A half is point five . 2733783_2738533
Mm . 2738533_2739243
the reciprocal is gon na be two . 2740093_2744433
Ooh . 2745213_2745323
Right A quarter
