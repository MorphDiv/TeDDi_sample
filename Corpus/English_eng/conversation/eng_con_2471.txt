to Italy ? 1150_3390
it is a call to Italy ? 1150_3390
uh@fp . 1150_3390
no, no, no, no . 2080_6830
here . 2080_6830
&=smack &=breath one of you will do the doctor, the other one is
okay . 3640_4640
and hes@fp +//. 3640_4640
oh . 4850_5250
she said go . 6010_8260
so you wanna +//. 6010_8260
okay . 7740_8400
can we proceed ? 7840_9740
&=breath okay, it is good . 7840_9740
okay . 8070_10050
gut . 8070_10050
you wanna talk to us about +//. 9080_10510
oh, go go go . 9230_10500
&=breath . 9230_10500
string . 10350_12210
discuss another one . 10350_12210
okay . 10350_12210
you're xxx +//. 10350_12210
okay . 11140_26740
so, last time, what we started to do, &=breath is uhm@fp wh@i
&=breath we blew it and blew it, blew it and blew it, and it
&=breath so, be careful with the balloon . 11140_26740
you broke the balloon ? 18880_20010
hm@fp wh@i what are you doing there, joker ? 26300_28730
lo@i +//. 26300_28730
&=laugh that is your new word, joker ? 28440_49100
okay . 28440_49100
&=breath so, last time we we uh@fp break &=smack some little
<we put the egg> we basically we tried to do a shell of
&=breath put it in that . 28440_49100
also pieces of that . 28440_49100
&=smack &=breath and close it . 28440_49100
hes@fp that was the plan . 28440_49100
&=laugh . 28800_29430
&=laugh . 30090_31150
uh+huh . 41540_42380
okay . 47940_48590
okay . 49020_49470
&=breath . 49020_49470
<let me> let me uh@fp +//. 49370_50400
uh@fp why don't we blow this up and this can be the bottom cushion
well, what I was gonna suggest is if we have a container like
&=breath we can attach this to the top here and it can be
yeah, but you're assuming that it is gonna fall this way . 65770_67690
well, you can also halve the balloon . 67890_70070
<I don't> yeah, I mean, I'm assuming it is gonna fall straight
I mean, &=breath <it might not> we could weight the bottom
if we have enough tape . 68390_79140
you you can make a hole there . 71190_73050
yeah . 74820_75280
we can use that also to hm@fp to weight it . 77270_79470
I guess so . 79610_82520
&=breath but look . 79610_82520
<but the other thing we could do is> okay, hold on . 79610_82520
so, <let us here> let us hear uh@fp or . 82160_85300
so, one idea was you can blow the balloon, we can attach the
hm@fp yes . 86770_87390
right . 91650_95650
oh, and that would keep it upright . 91650_95650
but the problem is then we wouldn't have this to hang it on . 91650_95650
up . 93360_94570
hm@fp yeah . 93360_94570
and in case we will gain <one meter> well, fifty
yeah . 95700_97170
we would have no uh@fp +//. 95700_97170
right . 99140_108050
&=breath okay . 99140_108050
&=breath so, hes@fp h@i here is another plan . 99140_108050
so, what if we were to inflate this to some volume that would be
on top ? 107610_108340
yeah . 108290_112050
&=breath and then basically that that would break the fall . 108290_112050
probably . 108290_112050
like a@i +//. 108290_112050
no, there was one thing . 111990_120040
<we tried something> the thing is that &=breath when it
okay . 120320_120950
well, <it is> <it is not gonna> it is hardboiled . 120770_126610
so, when it goes from here to here &=breath it is not gonna +//. 120770_126610
yeah . 125200_126030
it is +//. 125200_126030
<but I> I okay, so let us think about this . 126750_135670
so, i@i i@i if if we inflate this <to some> to
s@i +//. 126750_135670
you you think we can put the egg inside ? 134130_136280
no, I don't wanna put the egg inside . 136370_138910
but I wanna put it like this . 136370_138910
hes@fp . 136370_138910
oh, to do a cushion ? 137900_139110
yeah, from all sides . 139010_143300
what do you think ? 139010_143300
do you think this is flexible enough or it is gonna break ? 139010_143300
I would suggest hes@fp to use hes@fp the balloon as a kind of
because &=breath if you don't, it it will fall very &=breath
and okay . 144300_171240
<we can> we can try to use this as a shell . 144300_171240
but yes, &=breath but maybe yes . 144300_171240
<and to> maybe maybe this this way . 144300_171240
so this could be a a buffer . 144300_171240
a second buffer . 144300_171240
and <we c@i> we could hes@fp +//. 144300_171240
oh, on the top . 150880_152120
like +//. 150880_152120
like this ? 155790_156440
but then hes@fp then you have to +//. 161490_163150
well, <how much> how much buoyancy can this provide ? 161580_164260
yeah, I like this idea, actually . 169610_172600
<this is> this is okay . 169610_172600
yeah . 169610_172600
and you put the egg there ? 170670_171930
yes, and <the balloon> the balloon works as a kind of
&=breath and ma@i <maybe it> it it yes . 171810_186770
but &=breath <but if> <if you stabilize> yes . 171810_186770
uh@fp . 171810_186770
so <we have to> we have +//. 174140_175970
well, but then it will +//. 180780_181910
so, hes@fp &=breath we can make little uh@fp little stuff . 182620_186400
well, that is okay, though . 182700_183850
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . 185670_186680
oh, xxx be careful . 187010_188100
that way . 187950_188660
yeah, I like that . 188820_189750
so, <what do w@i> what do we have to do to do that ? 189580_191950
we have to like +//. 189580_191950
in fact, this doesn't have to be this tall . 191130_198900
<we could probably like> we could probably like break off this
yeah . 196900_198190
a cushion . 196900_198190
yes . 197720_198340
<or you> <you could uh@fp &=breath try to> okay .
we have no scissors . 198770_209920
no scissors . 198770_209920
but we can do it by hand so that it &=breath drops smooth . 198770_209920
right . 203710_204720
yeah, but we can do it by hand . 205150_207020
we can do it by hand . 205150_207020
well, we can make holes with this . 205200_207450
well, that is okay . 205380_207780
<we can> we can use these . 205380_207780
&=breath . 205380_207780
right . 208610_212750
&=breath okay, let us do that . 208610_212750
uh@fp ar@i is everyone agreed ? 208610_212750
do you guys like that, or ? 208610_212750
oh, yeah . 208690_210890
oh . 208690_210890
I think I like it . 212540_216130
so, <we need> we need to punch a hole in hm@fp &=breath +//. 212540_216130
but but I'm not really sure how hes@fp how good this
how much buoyancy that'll provide . 217860_219660
&=breath . 217860_219660
do we have any m@i +//. 221800_222880
so hm@fp +//. 222370_223510
well, at least it'll keep it upright . 223010_224440
do you want to attach it from here ? 224210_225990
because it is quite quite heavy . 224250_225930
sorry ? 226190_226640
do you want to attach the balloon from the bottom here ? 226550_228880
no, no, no, no . 228160_234440
we wanna attach it around the edge . 228160_234440
you see , if &=breath if we attach it to the
the higher we attach it the +//. 228160_234440
yeah, I would think so . 228270_229860
oh, you mean &=breath +//. 232610_233580
yes . 232640_233170
so, here and here . 234110_235540
hes@fp . 234110_235540
so, lots lots of this band and to to place it like
so, like this . 234980_236110
yeah, yeah . 235990_237250
yeah, like that . 235990_237250
do you want to +//. 237540_238680
so, here you go . 241040_242890
we can uh@fp +//. 241040_242890
so, you want to make two holes ? 242110_243550
no, would you hold on a sec@n ? 243530_251330
okay, let us decide how high we want to make the holes . 243530_251330
'cause we wanna make sure that it doesn't rip out, but we also
xxx wait, wait . 243770_247080
I'm gonna need to decide where th@i we're gonna do this . 243770_247080
yeah . 249940_250390
well, xxx we have to +//. 250920_252420
well, we can reinforce it with tape . 251320_253360
yeah, yeah . 252450_262270
let us reinforce . 252450_262270
okay, good . 252450_262270
&=breath so so, what did we say here ? 252450_262270
you guys wanna take out the lid so that we have some extra
oh . 263190_273950
hey, and and we can build a lattice inside the uh@fp thing
so, &=breath we'll build a lattice so the egg is not actually
yeah . 267520_268090
a what ? 267740_268370
oh, yeah . 272480_273020
what do you think about this ? 273730_275080
is this good ? 273730_275080
yes . 274800_275380
so so, how about I <I rip out> I rip out this and
&=breath s@i so, we take this out and we keep this fat part
&=breath <and then> <and then> and then we basically just
is that cool ? 275480_286610
that . 284260_284770
yes . 286520_287780
but +//. 286520_287780
okay . 286930_289380
can I have the paper+clip then ? 286930_289380
you guys are okay with this plan, right ? 290710_292080
yeah . 292000_293700
hm@fp I think we are really good . 292000_293700
I think they're doing the same thing . 300350_301600
no, I don't think they are . 301960_306750
that is impossible . 301960_306750
our ideas are just too good . 301960_306750
mister egg . 308700_310620
&=laugh . 308700_310620
capsule . 311320_312020
shit, I'm getting uh@fp Styrofoam in my coffee . 319420_322130
that is not a plan . 319420_322130
should I blow it up ? 327560_328590
no, don't do it yet . 329110_338210
don't do it yet . 329110_338210
don't do it yet . 329110_338210
<we need to have like> we need to have a strategy for how
maybe at the end . 329290_330300
not yet . 329640_331060
&=breath . 329640_331060
oh, you have the hm@fp +//. 331540_332770
okay . 337360_338240
&=breath . 337360_338240
well, attaching the string to the cup is fairly easy . 337580_341230
we +//. 337580_341230
yeah . 342400_343540
I think s@i yeah . 342400_343540
<leave some sort of s@i> leave some room for knots, right ? 343850_350540
&=breath so, you you may actually wanna do it not like that
&=breath y@i like this . 343850_350540
yeah, yeah . 346580_347560
&=breath . 346580_347560
actually, maybe we can use that as a uhm@fp +//. 348130_350260
like try to put uh@fp kl@i tie it over here, &=breath and
that would be a foot less of fall . 351730_357190
oh, yeah . 354730_355820
&=breath . 354730_355820
where is that uh@fp +//. 357500_358630
we can use this also <as a> uhm@fp to put inside . 357750_360540
sorry, I'm taking some time here, because &=breath because I
&=laugh . 363220_366200
that is okay . 364770_365440
no, no . 366850_370700
<make it> do it n@i nicely . 366850_370700
carefully . 366850_370700
yeah . 369480_370990
we do have forty five minutes . 369480_370990
oh, yeah . 371470_373360
that is right . 371470_373360
&=breath but ma@i +//. 371470_373360
oh . 372740_374030
we have forty five minutes ? 372740_374030
yeah, but maybe we <we could> we can get an extra prize
yeah . 377400_377830
I think our extra prize will be sitting around waiting for the
here, let us take a look at this now . 378400_386930
&=breath so, I'm gonna put it right under the rim here . 378400_386930
good . 381070_381570
yeah, that is a good plan . 387520_390660
and we'll reinforce <with the> with the tape like idiocy .
&=laugh . 393120_396570
you're cheating . 393380_394280
well, <I s@i> &=laugh <I ca@i> &=breath I can hear them
I wonder what it is . 395860_404730
&=laugh we can maybe use the the pin inside also to do hm@fp a
well, still working on his object model over there . 404230_407610
&=breath . 404230_407610
&=laugh you're mean . 407860_416270
&=breath object+models are useless, hes@fp I mean useful . 407860_416270
&=breath uhm@fp that wasn't a Freudian_slip, so . 407860_416270
&=laugh . 407860_416270
here . 410370_411830
give me this . 410370_411830
&=laugh . 410370_411830
so, <do you want us> do you want us to prepare some little
yeah, definitely . 418740_419730
okay . 419300_419980
so, what is your view here ? 421200_424730
hm@fp we take something like xxx +//. 421200_424730
n@i no, no, no . 423910_429130
not too much, be@i e@i 'cause you don't want the force to
&=breath you you want it to be something like this . 423910_429130
but +//. 427050_427470
is there a big difference whether the string is very long or
well, it is . 434130_435190
because y@i +//. 434130_435190
I don't think dropping to the side is a big deal . 440690_445940
I mean, <it is> <it is> i@i it is hardboiled . 440690_445940
&=breath . 440690_445940
I don't think so, either . 442680_443690
it is hardboiled, right ? 444810_446050
<yeah but if it has a> one &=breath oh, no . 446170_452100
actually, if we put a lot of tape on it she won't be able to see it
&=laugh . 446170_452100
so +//. 447610_448220
<no but we're gonna put it in> &=breath <we gonna> no,
&=breath and we're only gonna put stuff around the sides &=breath
&=breath so, if it falls, it s@i might crush this, i@i
yes . 450810_452710
&=laugh . 450810_452710
and <we should> <we should weight> we should pu@i hes@fp
actually, I should keep some tape . 466930_469850
okay . 468150_468650
so, I'm gonna tie this knot if that is okay . 472740_475030
&=breath . 472740_475030
I just hope the tape will be strong enough to +//. 476630_479050
make some little stuff . 483120_484260
maybe we can do lots of +//. 485240_487440
oh, we need to decorate the egg, also . 487290_488880
<so here is> &=breath and that is what we're gonna do
what do you think ? 499950_501220
square+knot ? 499950_501220
reef+knot . 502760_503860
yeah . 502760_503860
reef it . 502760_503860
oops . 510570_511230
okay . 531930_533500
how are we doing ? 531930_533500
how is everyone doing ? 531930_533500
okay . 531980_532620
useless ? 533430_534190
&=laugh . 535150_536010
not getting there . 535470_536510
bu@i don't you think we should put the egg first ? 535820_537830
why ? 538400_540400
<you can> you can tuck it in . 538400_540400
I don't know . 539150_541010
you think we have space ? 539150_541010
okay . 539150_541010

why ? 621620_622060
'cause we're thinking of wrapping it in six layers of of six

that is <a minimum> a minimum of ru@i

&=breath . 1012570_1014710
exactly . 1014110_1015460
tiny ones . 1014110_1015460

no, I was th@i thinking uh@fp &=smack &=breath <we can use it>
micro fractures . 1049150_1050280

see how I'm saying ? 1051910_1058090
like +//. 1051910_1058090

we can just tape tape around and tape like this . 1068220_1081740
