And he had, and on top of that he had this big curly hair .60175_64000
And, like, if you've got a big head already, don't get big hair on
Yeah .68913_69110
Makes it look even bigger . 69110_70667
It was really amazing . 70667_72860

Or, two, I was gonna clearly win, and the other person backed
That's a good way to fight .90570_94000

Um, anyway, for some reason he sympathized with my cause, right .148684_153515
And he was, like, eighteen and he rode a BMX bike and all this
And we didn't realize it because we were little, right ?160696_163555
