pick a playdough .
good job ! 0_1648
what are we gonna make with the playdough ? 1648_5046
well that's up to you .
what do you wanna make ? 5046_7593
I can make a rainbow . 7593_10040
a rainbow ?
well let me show you what I've got today . 10040_12771
do you have the colors to make a rainbow ? 12771_17617
I may . 17617_20065
these are the colors I have .
&+uhoh this one was kept open so it might not be +//.
uh@i I don't know if it's dried out . 20065_26791
I think it's okay . 26791_29522
<so I've got> these are the colors I've got . 29522_32868
0 . 32868_35599
these are all the tools ?
those are all the tools . 35599_40461
I can't open them . 40461_44824
do you want me to help ?
yeah . 44824_46621
okay .
may I please have some help .
sure . 46621_50617
it's hard to get out . 50617_53531
well see see what you can get out of those . 53531_56262
what other colors did you want ? 56262_58709
<i want> I want just about +... 58709_67184
um@i just about all of them .
just about all of them ?
okay .
well can I ask don't mix them up .
okay ?
why ? 67184_77109
well because then all the colors are mixed and <then they don't have> then you can't make rainbows if they're all mixed up .
I mean +/.
well we can't make rainbows if they're not mixed up . 77109_88431
well so: when I say don't mix them up I mean don't +//.
let me show you .
don't go like this and mix them up like that . 88431_98172
okay ?
if you're gonna make a rainbow then you make +//.
actually that's too much to make a rainbow I think . 98172_104398
we can both make rainbows . 104398_106679
so if you make a rainbow like this and you make one stripe like this ?
right ?
and then you make another stripe +//.
you know like a rainbow actually you can see the separate stripes right ? 106679_117419
and you put them side by side .
um@i is this enough playdough to use ? 117419_123363
can I see ?
I think that's good for a stripe . 123363_126461
yeah .
so we'll put the other one here . 126461_129291
can we both make rainbows ?
yeah . 129291_132022
okay .
that sounds like a great idea . 132022_136318
so can I ask you +/.
what ?
+, you have one sister <do you have> who else do you have ? 136318_142995
well I have one more brother . 142995_145391
and what's his name ?
his name is Matthew . 145391_147839
does he go to school ?
<he goes to> um@i he goes to um@i yyy school . 147839_156781
is this enough playdough ? 156781_158962
I think that's a good amount .
can I have that one ?
thank you . 158962_161060
so he does go to school every day ?
yeah .
and do you go to school ?
yeah . 161060_167521
I go to school in ncrc@f . 167521_171050
do you go every day ?
yeah . 171050_173680
in the afternoon ?
yeah .
okay . 173680_177178
do you have friends at your school ?
yes .
what are some of your friends' names ?
well I have Julia Nicole Ava &+um Toli's my sister .
and Sam Cooper . 177178_200005
wow you've got a lot of friends .
what do we need to push them together ? 200005_206165
well so what I'm gonna do +//.
I'll show you .
I don't think you really have to push them together (be)cause you just have to bend them . 206165_211827
right ?
in the shape of a rainbow ?
I was gonna add some more colors .
do you want more colors ? 211827_217754
yeah .
now what I would do is I would roll them a little bit more .
so that they bend easier . 217754_225663
you know what I mean ? 225663_228577
is this big enough ? 228577_232158
yeah roll it a little bit more . 232158_235188
otherwise it's really hard to bend I think . 235188_237802
0 . 237802_241016
is this good ? 241016_242430
yeah I think that's good . 242430_244646
this one needs to roll a little bit . 244646_247092
I would roll that one a little bit more .
now <do you want> you want more colors don't you ? 247092_251072
yeah .
okay .
and you haven't rolled the red one yet .
or the blue one .
no . 251072_255967
so you've got work to do still . 255967_257715
but this is gonna break . 257715_260496
roll it some more .
I think it'll be okay . 260496_263576
0 . 263576_266407
0 . 266407_269022
I don't know if I want pink in my rainbow .
do you want pink ? 269022_272551
yeah . 272551_274433
yes ?
is this enough ? 274433_276364
yeah I think that's good . 276364_278212
here's pink . 278212_280327
oh we definitely need purple . 280327_282775
don't you think ?
yeah . 282775_285106
is this enough ? 285106_286954
I think that might be a little too much . 286954_290068
that time .
how about this ? 290068_293531
that's good . 293531_297327
what is that out there ? 297327_301423
that bottle .
<it's for> it's for Matthew and daddy's experiment .
they have an experiment ? 301423_308799
what are they doing ?
they're doing something about weather . 308799_312345
about the weather ?
yeah . 312345_314626
wow .
that looks kind of neat . 314626_317540
is this big enough ? 317540_320820
I think so .
do I need to bend it like this ? 320820_326082
well try it .
does it work ? 326082_328662
yeah .
good . 328662_331160
0 . 331160_333675
0 . 333675_336206
what do you think of my rainbow ? 336206_337888
does it need more colors or is it enough ? 337888_341284
I'm gonna do +//.
oh I definitely need purple .
you definitely need purple . 341284_347412
and I think you should use pink in yours .
I think that would look nice . 347412_351225
I don't want pink in mine .
I don't think the red and the pink go together very well . 351225_356503
is this long enough ? 355058_360802
yeah . 360802_362451
that's good . 362451_364200
0 . 364200_366264
I noticed that the ones on the outside have to be a little bit longer .
so which way are you gonna bend ? 366264_370943
are you gonna bend it +/.
I bended it around .
see ? 370943_375023
okay .
yep .
so the pink one has to be a little bit longer . 375023_379319
why ?
well because see how my red one I had to make it a little bit longer .
the purple one gets all bent because actually it's too long I think . 379319_387711
I don't know . 387711_389574
yours is gonna work .
it's gonna be fine . 389574_391922
I'm not trying to worry you . 391922_395236
I'm sure it'll turn out great . 395236_396684
look at mine . 396684_401164
it's looking good . 401164_403611
not finished yet . 403611_406209
no ? 406209_407359
which ones do you want ? 407359_408040
what color ? 408040_408590
I want some orange in my rainbow . 408590_411255

0 . 412336_413119

that's perfect . 417748_421927
good . 421927_423110

well we +//.
well I can't pick it up .
the rainbow ?
no . 454795_463420
do you want me to try and help ? 463420_464951
or you know what ?
we can use a tool .

0 . 469714_474242

are you gonna show your mom ? 481535_487696
yeah .
okay . 487696_494290
well maybe my sister could make a rainbow .
she will .
you know what ?
she's gonna do exactly what you did actually . 494290_500750
she's gonna point to all the pictures and everything that you just did . 500750_505928
I'm pushing it a little more together . 505928_510007
okay . 510007_512455
0 . 512455_516052
you know what ?
I was thinking maybe you shouldn't tell your sister and then we'll see what she comes up with . 516052_521414
what she makes .
maybe she'll make a rainbow too but maybe she won't . 521414_526225

but I was thinking I would bring it in the living room so she could see it but +... 542277_550102
well it's up to you .
if you want to show her that sounds fine . 550102_556045
