&~www .
there's this girl called Helen .
and I really hate her because she's so annoying .
she always tells tales of me and <tells everyone> turns
she my best friend she took away from me .
and we fell out for over a month .
then me and my best friend turned against her .
so we're not friends with her no more .
she useta always come up to me and pretend that she was my friend
she useta come up to me and pull my hair .
but then well we just walked away me and my friend .
she always useta spread rumors about me and that .
