nothing you can do can change the fact that Asratu's core square is
but if you don't change his core square it's symmetrical . 10008_13240
and if you don't change my core square it's not symmetrical no
hmm . 19905_22788
still thinking about that huh that idea of center or going too
where's the center of this core square ? 30006_32571
right +. 32571_33303
right were the blue touches the green . 33303_35625
++ there . 35625_36515
0 . 36515_37345
okay, does anybody disagree with that ? 37345_39446
we're saying that the center of the core square is right there . 39446_42256
actually this side of the core square shows up shows up better .
right there . 45078_45978
is that the center of the core square ? 45978_47811
yes . 47811_48155
how does help how does looking at the center of this core
what happens when you look at the center ? 55540_57521
they divided the bedspread in the middle right ? 57521_67041
how do you divide a core square in the middle ? 67041_69418
how could you ? 69418_73910
maybe it's not something you've done before . 73910_79553
how could you divide a core square in the middle ? 79553_79941
any core square . 79941_84753
by measuring it . 84753_85858
by measuring it ? 85858_86828
uh I wanna . 86828_90176
how could you +... 90176_92576
they they found the middle of the &~k the bedspread and divided it
they divided it in half . 98518_99948
I want to divide my core square in half how can I do that ? 99948_103106
you could draw um a line to show it . 103106_105953
I could draw a line to show it ? 105953_108290
could you show me where that line would go ? 108290_110603
if you wanted to divide it ? 110603_112606
in the middle . 112606_113368
in half . 113368_114516
could . 114516_115845
(o)kay is um Amanda right that I could draw a line right there ? 115845_120860
there's actually already a line there isn't there ? 120860_122558
does that line go through the middle &~a does that design
yeah . 126660_127078
++ line divide the core square in half ? 127078_128763
yes . 128763_129125
yeah . 129125_129976
(o)kay um are there any other lines that divide the core square in
yes . 133440_134443
yeah this line . 134443_135581
right there . 135581_136381
0 . 136381_136906
(o)kay would there be any other lines that divide this core square
ah ! 140020_140435
Brittany ? 140435_141285
um . 141285_141685
right here . 141685_144043
wait I can't . 144043_145883
these two right here +/. 145883_147301
I want one line that divides it in half . 147301_148738
um . 148738_149986
just one I +/. 149986_150876
right here . 150876_152020
that would divide if I drew a line right there it would divide
no . 155546_155965
no . 155965_156331
hmm . 156331_157186
no . 157186_157681
&~i &~i it'd divide it'd divide that
it would divide this square in half yeah . 160498_162738
+^ Kelly I'm sorry I need to ask you to sit flat . 162738_164890
I'm anxious um that all the people behind you can see but it makes
go ahead with what you were going to say or show . 169310_171215
crisscross ? 171215_172276
crisscross . 172276_173371
watch you might not have been able to see what Kelly did with her
she went like this . 176220_177121
If drew a line from here to here . 177121_179498
would I be have divided the core square in half ? 179498_182096
yeah . 182096_182810
yes . 182810_183013
or if you <drew a line going from to here to here> . 183013_186838
dinagule . 186838_188380
okay is there another way I could do it ? 188380_189381
watch the ways we have so far . 189381_190830
(be)cause if you haven't been watching so far you should watch now .
+^ Sara your eyes aren't even up here . 193530_195211
they need to be . 195211_196515
hair out of the way . 196515_198111
eyes up here . 198111_198950
the &~wha line we have so far is here . 198950_200661
here . 200661_203498
here . 203498_205451
and here . 205451_207585
are there any other lines I could draw that would divide this core
do we see any other ways we could possibly <draw a line to divide
no . 218961_219296
okay . 219296_220076
do you ? 220076_220776
yeah . 220776_221411
well I +/. 221411_222328
do I see any others ? 222328_222680
no . 222680_224028
&=laugh . 224028_225425
not straight lines . 225425_227026
to divide it <exactly in half > . 227026_229708
<or diagonal > . 229708_230141
you could divide it +/. 230141_231475
hmm . 231475_232090
I could think of some but they wouldn't be straight lines . 232090_233591
<okay well > . 233591_234773
xxx . 234773_236740
think about that please . 236740_237806
I'm giving you a big hint to help you figure out what symmetrical
so if you've started to let your mind wander turn back to the
<ah okay I got xxx xxx > . 247491_248471
I know ! 248471_249055
you know what ? 249055_249686
<I know another line > . 249686_251638
well I think <I know um how one of them isn't symmetrical and the
ssh . 256736_257073
okay . 257073_257410
because um one +//. 257410_263345
one of +/. 263345_263591
stop ! 263591_264978
the ways that is symmetrical is that like there's more ways to
keep thinking about that and let me show them something . 273593_285341
Asratu's <is symmetrical> . 285341_286818
xxx . 286818_287540
Kevin's is not . 287540_288790
(o)kay ? 288790_289855
this is Kevin's . 289855_290840
it's not symmetrical . 290840_295751
still a great core square it just didn't turn out symmetrical . 295751_296235
this one . 296235_296988
a great core square it did turn out symmetrical . 296988_299751
what you need to do or think about those line we just found and
++ the lines that would divide a core square in half +. 306455_312558
++ imagine those lines on each of these core squares and tell me
yeah the same lines can be found on Kevin's . 319330_321613
I see another line . 321613_324085
show me Vanessa . 324085_325548
if you go like this . 325548_328421
we said it had to be a straight line . 328421_330778
oh . 330778_331621
oh yeah . 331621_333011
I see a line +//. 333011_333850
we need it to match exactly . 333850_334651
+^ so what is it what happens differently when you imagine
Kevin's looks like +/. 346526_348250
and I don't want you to just imagine where those lines are <another
it's not it's not by its not &~th this is something that it's
what ? 356915_357845
it's not that uh um Asartu's is that one Asratu's ? 357845_361658
this one's Asratu's . 361658_362406
<it's not that> Asratu's um symmetrical because it's in crayon
<because xxx> . 368645_369125
you're right . 369125_369510
whether you use crayon or marker has nothing to do with being
&~be +/. 372156_372755
please imagine folding these core squares . 372755_378555
please imagine folding these core squares . 378555_379521
remember Vanessa's idea ? 379521_380310
if you can fold something evenly you've found the middle . 380310_384905
um would you put that down for a second ? 384905_389105
imagine folding them along those lines we just traced and something
Jillian what are you thinking ? 396910_400506
um that I think that they're symmetrical because they look the
these aren't both symmetrical . 405573_407141
this one is not . 407141_408040
and this one is . 408040_409783
I mean (be)cause they um they're different . 409783_411836
what's different ? 411836_413916
it's a different &~th one of them is symmetrical and the other
right that's what I said . 418671_419950
so why ? 419950_420605
yeah &~an +/. 420605_421813
yeah . 421813_422248
because they look the same ? 422248_423738
what looks the same ? 423738_425440
something about <this one looks the same> ? 425440_427420
<the two core squares> . 427420_428138
these look the same ? 428138_428998
no . 428998_430031
because no but they both . 430031_432198
these two come slanting down like that . 432198_436191
(o)kay . 436191_437675
the what she just +/. 437675_439113
xxx where he has the triangles look exactly the same as on Kevin's .
okay can I show you that ? 445011_446191
what &~Brit um what Jillian has just been noticing she's been
they divided the upper left into two triangles like that +. 455825_462473
see how &~he now Kevin made one yellow and one blue +. 462473_464853
and Asratu made one red and one green +. 464853_468365
and then they divided this section of the core square the upper
they put a green one in exactly the same position +. 476681_479781
but then Kevin made his other triangle blue and Asratu chose a red
and at the bottom they also arranged four triangles in the same way
here Asratu used red and Kevin used blue +. 492588_496261
and then here Asratu used two blue and Kevin used a green and a
and here was green on Kevin's and red on there . 500750_504396
Jillian noticed that hmm they &~pi both used eight triangles . 504396_508581
they arranged eight triangles in exactly the same way . 508581_511996
how could it be that Asratu's is symmetrical and Kevin's is not . 511996_517741
but it is . 517741_518446
that is true . 518446_519211
Kevin's is not and Asratu's is . 519211_521615
hmm so it can't be the shapes they used . 521615_524425
can it be that +/. 524425_526910
and it can't be the way they arranged them xxx (be)cause they
can it be the color ? 530325_531910
but does it &~ha it has to have to do with color this time ? 531910_536315
no . 536315_537791
well they used the same shapes in the same position the only thing
<but they used> . 543291_545146
but they but they didn't use the same colors . 545146_546240
right so &~th so color must have something to do with why this
hmm . 550510_552290
oh because ! 552290_553056
because they have different colors in different arrangements . 553056_554411
right but this one turned out symmetrical and this one didn't . 554411_557323
why ? 557323_558713
because um . 558713_560625
xxx . 560625_564776
I need to ask you again to imagine folding these in half +/. 564776_567391
