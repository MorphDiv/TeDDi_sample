it's showing you um that um you don't have to use just two colors
okay . 161231_161765
how did the design of the finished quilt change as they added more
first there was just two colors, then there was many colors . 167996_171461
so how did that change the design ? 171461_173413
I know it had more colors but is that all ? 173413_175926
&=head:shake . 175926_177210
Brittany ? 177210_178060

was it the same design ? 192788_196005
no . 196005_197820
<how was it different> ? 197820_199636
<it was the> same design but it they just added different
was it the same design ? 202985_204636
+< um xxx no . 204636_205741
before they added the color strip ? 205741_206751
now did they change the core square ? 206751_208683
yeah . 208683_210473
no they didn't change the core square . 210473_213318
they just like flipped it . 213318_215046
I didn't see them flip anything in that segment of the video . 215046_219675
um . 219675_220825
what did they do ? 220825_221815
core strip . 221815_222635
no &~n in that different part &~y you're right flips it . 222635_225623
we're just talking about the part where on the screen they show you
and as Nathan explained it begins in just two colors and then
Amanda ? 239315_239853
<I don't> please don't be paying attention to them right now .
they add colors to the quilts . 242960_245526
one color at a time and then more and more colors . 245526_248380
so do they change the core square ? 248380_250515
no . 250515_252230
no . 252230_253730
if they don't change the core square how &~d how does the quilt look
yes they do xxx . 257528_258295
<how did> what did they change about the core square ? 258295_260790
the colors . 260790_261341
the colors . 261341_262308
did they change the shapes they used ? 262308_263876
no . 263876_265100
did they change the shapes are arranged ? 265100_267251
no . 267251_268318
so they just changed <color> . 268318_270471
<the color> . 270471_270873
okay +. 270873_271441
but every color stays there they just put more colors in . 271441_276115
every color stays there +... 276115_277286
no . 277286_278596
every color stays there but they put colors over it . 278596_281880
+< no well they xxx and they overlap some . 281880_283583
but each there's like at least one big xxx +/. 283583_287693
so does the quilt get bigger ? 287693_288338
if they keep adding all the colors and they keep adding more and
no . 292000_292058
no because they overlap the others . 292058_294808
okay . 294808_295456
so they don't add any new pieces to the quilt . 295456_298188
they just change the color of some of the pieces and they just kind
Alex . 309336_310373
um well the designs were getting more interesting as it went on . 310373_317255
as they continued to adding colors ? 317255_319620
so what does adding more colors to your core square do to your
make it prettier . 324285_326450
make it prettier . 326450_327265
that quilt certainly got prettier as they continued adding to it . 327265_332880
hmm okay who noticed something else in the video today ? 332880_335928
Kelly, what were you thinking about ? 335928_337258
um you know there's one quilt that looks like the one up there xxx .
why don't you go point to the one you recognized in the video . 343073_346691
this one . 346691_349553
okay . 349553_350673
yup they did use a core square just like that didn't they . 350673_354118
they did use a core square made with those same exact shapes and
good noticing . 361875_362560
(be)cause they used different colors than that . 362560_364100
that was with the blues and the purples . 364100_366810
remember that one it was blues and purples +/. 366810_368740
+< oh yeah . 368740_369308
+, and they showed with that one going together . 369308_371373
um who else noticed something in the video or have something they
we'll get to strip quilts . 378075_379338
Kevin . 379338_380131
there was one that was different from this one but it was like um
sort of . 397480_398343
yup I I think I know which one you're thinking of . 398343_400620
+< xxx . 400620_401021
next time we watch +//. 401021_402250
no not the blue and purple one he's thinking of a different one . 402250_406106
he's thinking of yellow and kind of a pattern a kind of a brownish
+, next time we watch the video let's watch and see how that one is
but he's right out of the ones up there that's the one that reminds
I think he's right but I don't think it's exactly like that one but
+< no that one has different colors +. 428641_429743
um +. 429743_430711
that one doesn't have any green . 430711_432076
right well do you think color is the only thing different about
xxx . 435775_438000
you think it's exactly like mine only different colors ? 438000_440308
well um . 440308_442205
I don't think so . 442205_443985
we'll watch next time that's something to watch for . 443985_446703
Nicole, what do you want to say about that video ? 446703_448436
every single pattern is different . 448436_450853
every single pattern they showed was different ? 450853_453616
um okay . 453616_457963
why do you think they showed us lots of different patterns ? 457963_460346
what do you think ? 460346_467278
take a guess . 467278_468393
why do you think they showed us lots of different patterns ? 468393_470658
different ways to make (th)em . 470658_473291
okay why would they want want us to see different ways to make
<how does that help you as a quilter> <how does it help>
make lots of different quilts . 490140_497083
and how does that help you knowing that lots of different patterns
is it important to know that ? 501350_505863
mmm yeah . 505863_510028
why ? 510028_510530
mmm so you can sell it and make xxx money . 510530_517393
was that video about selling quilts and making money ? 517393_520341
no . 520341_520875
no . 520875_521280
so why is it important that you know that there's lots of different
what do you think Jillian ? 530081_534675
um because &=cough they want to make uh different kinds of quilts
so all of what quilts won't be the same ? 542913_544858
<the quilts on the video> the quilts on the video ? 544858_547943
yeah . 547943_548191
why did they not want all the finished quilts to be the same ? 548191_551440
because they wanted to um +... 551198_558870
what if all the finished quilts that we saw in the video were the
it <wouldn't> wouldn't be an interesting movie . 561495_565860
it wouldn't be as interesting ? 565860_567796
why +... 567796_568033
