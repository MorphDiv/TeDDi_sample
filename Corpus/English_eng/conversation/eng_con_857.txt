&~www .
0 &-um tapping me on the shoulder nonstop .
just 0 tapping me until I turn around .
and then he pretends it wasn't him .
or 0 throwing things at me or turning my tv off when I'm
and 0 using my c_d player .
0 trying to shoot me with a pellet gun .
0 chase me around the house .
and just 0 talking back at me all the time to wind me up .
yeah .
