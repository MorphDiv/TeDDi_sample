so what is our most important line or image and why ? 55385_58585
it's too many +...
to me, what he's talking about is like, brushing away the haters, like oh no, like that's what I'm thinking . 59665_64825
man, it's like the pretty obvious one to me is he's talking about like people dying and everything, suicide and everything, brushing away flies from the dead bodies . 65265_73165
huh, yeah, I would never have thought about that . 73425_77725
so one association with flies is that we think about flies surrounding like a dead body . 77905_83225
what's that line about ? 83505_84505
let's go in on that particular line . 84785_86365
why show the image of somebody brushing away the flies from the baby ? 86685_93425
the baby probably died ? 94245_95385
let's get evidence . 97425_98845
if we're going to say this baby's not alive, where is our evidence to support that ? 98945_103365
I mean I get the flies, but we need a little more than that to make such a leap . 103485_106565
I don't think he's dead because it says “the little one sleeps” and then I guess she mentions the flies so you could visualize it more . 106805_116925
what else, what else does that kind of imply ? 117685_119025
that I'm sweeping away the flies ? 119225_122005
when it says that “I lift the gaze and look a long time”, like when you are first born, you don't know nothin(g), like you keep going into life, but you like experience more and more stuff . 122325_133925
and next thing you know, he says suddenly “brush away flies with my hands” . 134585_138565
like I don't know where death just upons him and all your life is, is gone . 138885_143345
alright, so let's back up then and clarify . 144425_146165
so who's the one brushing away the flies ? 146665_151245
like who's the one doing that action ? 151965_154285
a mother figure, the people that are trying to keep away from death . 154625_157545
okay, so I think that's a little more clear to me now . 159635_163255
what about for the rest of you, guys ? 163815_165135
so most likely, the person that's sweepin(g) the flies away is either a parent figure or someone who is looking out for the baby . 165135_173915
so let's look at other lines that stand out to us as most important . 174475_178315
the blab of pave, tires of charts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders . 178455_182875
I think that's basically saying that stepped in blood, it's tracks that's talking to the people . 183165_189785
that's why it's combined, no ? 190245_190985
I think that's what it is . 191525_193985
okay, where do we get the blood ? 194245_195525
well, “bloody floor of the bedroom” . 196405_199645
so you are taking it the lines before ? 199845_201085
yeah . 201305_201645
okay . 201905_202165
yeah, I think that's kind of important because it's saying that it's talking to people walking by . 202525_208825
it don't mean it's like really talking to them, it just mean like it giving it away . 209645_212765
okay, I'm just curious about what other people think about that line where it says “the blab of the pave, tires of carts” . 213865_220925
I thought it meant like some gooey stuff, that he had stepped in blood, but actually what he was saying was that when he was walking, I guess, chatter from, from the bystanders, they were like, that was chatter, I guess . 220985_235845
I don't like, I'm not sure . 236245_237885
I think it was sayin(g) like death, like he's seen death himself . 238905_244885
he's been through it all like how it feels to almost die and stuff like that . 245745_249925
and how it feels to get beat up . 250065_252025
to a bloody pulp and stuff . 252545_253585
every single thought that happens in the classroom . 254385_261105
but what I basically wanted them to do was really kind of look at language at you know, the kind of like minute-est level, you know, and really pay attention to you know, author's choice in terms of like why the author would say things, the way that they said them, why would I choose to arrange a line in a certain way, you know, what do the images kind of call out for you, so that, that's kind of what I wanted to give them time to work with . 262065_288525
“the blab of pave” is like people who, I guess, when it said the new-born, like when it said the little one sleeps, so new-born baby or “the blab of the pave” is not really knowing anything . 289305_299505
so you can make a connection right there that like a newborn baby, when you are first born, when you're first into the world, you're not sure . 300305_306185
so it's talking about to talk or chatter thoughtlessly . 306965_309725
you're not, people don't know what they actually talking about, they're just speaking . 310705_314925
what are we to make of the fact that in one line we have a baby that's sleeping in the cradle and in the next line we have a suicide that sprawled across the floor ? 315395_325955
struggle, he's going through a struggle . 327955_329075
that's how I see it . 329515_330335
trying to take care of his baby and going through their lifestyle . 330955_335235
so you're thinking of those situations are connected ? 336015_337995
yeah . 339115_342055
okay . 342595_342775
arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips . 344305_351405
I mind them or the show or resonance of them . 352165_357505
I come and depart . 357765_358685
I think he's saying he is arresting people who are doing wrong and at the same time he's trying to let other people show him of the richness, about the richness and the significance for the emotions of what other people have . 360405_379165
I think, I think there are still a little discomfort with ambiguity . 379865_382885
you know, in text, right . 383405_384545
we have to be, there has to be a directive, you know, we have to be being told to do something . 385545_390645
this author's just kind of exploring like the complexity of life, moreso making observations rather than like stating a thesis, you know ? 390985_400705
alright, what else ? 401065_401925
what do we have for juxtapositions ? 402125_404365
what else ? 404665_405185
wherever there is life, there is also death ? 405765_407565
so there is a new-born coming on through, but as the same way as that new-born has barely arrived, there is somebody who's just committed suicide or somebody whose life has just been taken . 409545_420705
I think that it is saying that just as fast as someone can get killed, someone could be born . 420925_425865
I was thinking when it says “the snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls”, is sort of a juxtaposition to arrests of criminals because when you read that line, you think of positive, you are spending time with your family and friends, having fun, throwing snowballs, saying jokes, and then there it goes to arrests of criminals, it turns from positive to the negative . 428765_452805
juxtaposition as far as criminals as far as when we first defined it was basically two opposites attracting, or like, colliding basically . 454465_462405
when xxx collided like the snowballs and the sleighs, and he collided that with the criminals and they were being arrested, like one moment you could be laughing and having fun, but then you go into the real world and then you listen to everything that actually happens and that occurs . 462865_480845
why would I choose to crash all these different things together like that ? 479265_483825
why would I show like people playing in the snow at the same time that I'm showing people that are being arrested, or criminals . 484045_491865
like why, why do that ? 492205_493845
what's the point ? 494125_494805
it's to get in our head that we all have choices . 494885_497165
each choice leads to a consequence . 497545_500025
well the authors tell you you each and every way like you could either, like on the onset, either freedom or jail . 500755_507675
you could be free out um living the life or you could be jail or possibly even dead . 508135_514335
right .
I think it's saying that anybody could die at any given time so just be careful with life and watch yourself . 516135_523495
hmm, but the thing that's great about teaching is that, you know, you always have the next day . 527005_530745
and like, once you have context, like I have an assessment in terms of what they do understand and they don't understand about, you know, juxtaposition in real time so now we can go back at it and like, enhance their understanding of that . 531065_544305
but you know, it's a challenge . 544785_545625
I think just seeing them grapple with important ideas or meaningful language, you know, is something that they need lots of exposure to . 546525_556065
I feel you man . 556665_557365
I like that . 557445_557725
