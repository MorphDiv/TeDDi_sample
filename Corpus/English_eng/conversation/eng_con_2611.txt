the way you're gonna argue in favor of it . 33465_34385
&=pause_while_s1_hands_back_papers .
<it'd be> it'd be fun to hear our voices . 222885_224265
&=laughs:multiple xxx maybe not who knows . 225365_228545
anyway so that's one thing &-uh &~w &-uh Dennis and and Laura have things that they were gonna get to we ran out_of time last time . 228545_236665
we have our reading on &-um photo journalism and doing ethics you've got reports on photos and &-um I'll give you a new assignment and we'll do a role playing game based on the handout for today . 237545_250005
and then on Monday we finish &-uh doing ethics and I will &-um at that time I'll talk about Tailwind so that for the next assignment a week from today you'll be +//. 250125_262825
you'll know what to look for . 263545_264365
because there's a_lot there's a_lot to look at <in the> in the Tailwind disaster at CNN . 265205_269645
okay so let's start out with <what we> what we &-uh ran out_of time on last time . 271105_275245
you wanna start ?
okay &-um this was an article in People that we talked about like I guess it was two weeks ago now about when we read about the little two year+old who was murdered by two ten year+old boys in England . 275565_286585
and &-um I'll pass it around . 287345_288925
I &~h highlighted some things with my pen that were the interesting parts like &-um +"/. 289085_293965
+" &{l=READING on January eighth of this year a London High Court judge ruled that Jamie's killers , both eighteen and &~el eligible to be released , now be given new identities and &~anom anonymity for life to protect them from reprisals and the ferocity of the &~Briti Britain's tabloids . 294205_306945
&}l=READING and &-um you_know &~i they've only been in jail for eight years but the justice described the two as genuinely extremely remorseful and say that no further detention would &~s would serve any purpose so it's kind_of interesting . 307545_319845
and then there's a long thing about you_know what other people think about it and what they've been doing in the past eight years , these two kids , and how they're gonna try and make their debut back into society . 320045_330205
so this week +//. 330425_330785
so it's &-um I_mean it's kind_of scary and it's interesting why to think why somebody would rule that they should be allowed to be given anonymity . 330985_339065
you_know (be)cause the issue is I guess that they were ten years old when they did this and they should be given a chance at another life . 339665_344705
and then the argument is that it was such a horrible crime that you_know why should you protect <these two> &~pe these two kids ? 345265_350365
and &-um this is anonymity in terms of their names right ? 350745_353105
right . 353285_353385
how about their images , their faces ? 353405_356225
&-um ⌈ they show a ⌉ +/. 357005_359245
+, ⌊ can can ⌋ newspapers take pictures and publish the photograph without the name ? 358005_361025
or is that not in the judge's ruling ? 361545_362865
&-um it didn't say +/. 363225_364525
mhm +/.
+, but I mean it shows a picture of them when they were ten and so I guess if you're like if they look I don't know about you but I look exactly the same as when I did when I was little &=laughs:multiple so it'd be ⌈ really easy to tell ⌉ . 365505_374525

but &-um ⌋ +/.

I mean I guess they don't even I don't even think the papers know what these boys look like now +/. 389535_393095

+, and so there's a chance that they look nothing &~al +/. 393435_394895
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ alike ⌉ and that they'll live the rest of their lives in anonymity or there's a chance that maybe people will figure it out . 395195_400215
and I don't +//. 400555_401195
it doesn't really say what the papers are allowed and not allowed to do it just says that . 401255_404535
(be)cause (be)cause wherever they're living , you_know let's say they're living in some town somewhere in England , once you publish the photograph anybody in the town that sees that person on the street is gonna know who they are . 404805_413345
⌊ right ⌋ +/. 413725_413805
+, ⌈ then ⌉ you might as well publish their name because it it then becomes public knowledge . 413825_417165
yeah I don't think that they've been &-um press has been granted access to them +/. 417505_422265
mhm +/.
+, so I don't know if people know ⌊ it ⌋ . 422425_423265
⌈ but I ⌉ just didn't know whether the judge specified image as_well_as name . 423265_426225
it doesn't say in here +/. 426245_427285
mhm +/.
+, unfortunately +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ but ⌉ and then also I didn't +//. 428445_430645
I couldn't find another picture so I chose this one . 430725_432865
so I'm just gonna say it right now but this is an interesting picture to publish because it's a picture of one of the boys leading the two year+old out_of the mall . 432965_438245
which is obviously kind_of scary because you see this what normally looking two kids walking hand in hand down a mall and you don't realize that one of these is &~a about to commit like a really bad murder +/. 438785_448805
+, mm +/.
+, and so it's really kind_of &-um a scary picture an interesting to &~pu to print so . 449245_453005
was that picture staged ? 453605_454885
⌊ no ⌋ .
⌈ this ⌉ ? 455665_455885
no this is from a mall security camera . 456025_457345

⌊ this is real ⌋ . 458205_458385
+, ⌈ a security camera ⌉ ? 458805_458925
okay . 458925_459185
yeah it &-um a mall camera caught one of his killers leading him away . 459705_462885
okay .
anybody happen to watch Nightline last night ? 463885_465645
they mentioned that photograph +/. 466045_467245
oh really ?
+, last night . 467725_468425
they did a story about privacy in England and hidden cameras . 468965_473705
in fact the police wanna have cameras posted all over the place . 474485_477805
yeah I'll pass these around ⌊ so that <you can look at it> ⌋ . 478125_479105
⌈ remember how at ⌉ the Superbowl people were surprised to hear that everyone who attended the Superbowl had their photograph taken by police ? 479105_484425
mhm .
&-uh so in England they wanna do that on a constant basis , have cameras everywhere . 485865_492385
and this piece last night on Nightline specifically mentioned that photograph as an example of police saying there's a value to having cameras <out there> . 493365_501485
right .
Big Brother . 502585_503045
yeah . 503525_503765
&=laughs:multiple good well thanks for that . 504985_507205
Dennis ? 507865_508165
now did everybody still have the handout from last time ? 508825_511565
nope .
do you have an extra copy ? 511845_512945
yeah &=laughs:S1 &=unintelligible_speech .
while we're doing this I have a question &-um photo essays do they far fall in the same topic as regular photo journalism ? 545975_552715
yeah . 553695_554075
they're similar to feature you know they're the photo equivalent of a feature print story . 555435_561515
feature text . 563015_563435
so they can be more atmospheric than a hard news photo . 563795_569195
okay Dennis ? 569495_571275
&-uh well the the the &~th the article that I found over the weekend was about the &-um &~associa or American Society of Newspaper Editors &-um with support of &~sopi Society of Professional Journalists trying to get &-uh copies of the autopsy photos of race car driver Dale Earnhardt's &-uh body <after he> after he was &-um killed in a stock car race at the Daytona Five Hundred . 574635_596615
&-um part of the background of the story is the other article that I passed out which talks about &-uh Teresa Earnhardt's reaction &-uh just a few days <after the> after the race where she said that she wanted the medical examiner's records to remain confidential . 597585_612205
of_course there's the aspect of in photo journalism of of of of public harm and of_course granting public access to &~aus autopsy photographs . 613225_621565
&-um it turns out that Florida has a pretty liberal law regarding &-uh autopsy photographs if they're not part of the active criminal investigation . 622705_630765
so therefore &-uh the newspaper editors &-uh collectively are going after these documents . 631245_637785
the reason is is they want to hire an independent investigator to determine if there was another reason why he died during his car crash , if there was a reason that was contrary to the official finding . 638445_650305
&-um I should also note as a side bar to these stories is that it became also published or it became known that Dale Earnhardt's car +//. 651185_661245
there was a question regarding the safety or the &-uh whether he was &~w actually wearing a an intact &~safet &-uh safety belt which would have restrained him . 661425_669005
now obviously if you're going two hundred miles an hour in a stock car race and you slam into the wall you_know the odds are &~k are heavily against you . 670025_675805
but anyway &=laughs:multiple the &-uh the NSC &-uh . 675905_679445
can I ask you a question ? 678945_679665
sure go ahead . 679765_680165
&-um &~wh what are the unanswered questions in his case ? 680205_684925
(be)cause I_mean &~sh surely the cause of death is pretty clear „ isn't it ? 685165_689965
&~wh what questions are there left to ask ? 690285_691985
well apparently the the newspaper editors +... 692745_696765
&~wh &~wh I guess two &~f as far as I can see . 697225_699225
one is the access of the pictures . 699425_700785
in_order_to determine an independent investigation since they were newspaper editors they felt that under Florida law they had a right to actually get a copy of them . 702045_708865
and evidently they &~f &-uh as I said before <as a> as a news organization they've gotten &~s support of SPJ and other newspaper +/. 710045_719625
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.

&~i .
is there any &~posi possible cause of death ? 741035_742695
I mean if you &~s you I saw it on TV . 742895_745015
so you see just crash . 745755_748075
I mean and he was one of the top race car drivers right ? 748435_751055

+, so .
I should +//. 780585_780885
lemme ask &~l I just remembered one more thing . 781045_782785
part of the other controversy quote_unquote is the fact that NASCAR is under some heat right now because this is the fourth race car driver to die in the last nine months +/. 783315_792355
oh +/.

+, ⌈ and perhaps ⌉ .
⌊ <that they're> lax ⌋ being lax in . 800595_806695
right and as as as a news story I think these these editors are and photo people are looking at this information as possible &-uh information that they'd like to impart to the public . 801695_812375
mhm .
one of the questions that they were that I know that independent sources want to find out is there's a different helmet that +/. 813175_821215
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you can wear ⌋ and Dale Earnhardt is like was vehemently like against that helmet he wore the open faced helmet and there's another helmet that has like the closed face helmet and apparently he died of head injuries +/. 820925_832285

+, so they were wondering if like he had worn the the closed face helmet if that would have possibly like helped him +/. 832785_837985
+, mhm +/.
+, and that's what &-uh independent sources wanted to check into after the autopsy was released . 838525_844265
yep .
well I don't think the newspapers should be granted access to the photos because &-um like basically we live in a morbid society so if one newspaper has them even if they don't publish (th)em it's gonna get out be on the net or something like that +/. 844915_856135
mhm +/.

+, to have your pictures of your +//. 860375_861415
like ⌈ if I was dead and I had a autopsy ⌉ . 861655_862735
⌊ but &~th they they said exclusively ⌋ though that's not their expressed intent for . 862735_864855

common sense would dictate that going around the track at two hundred forty miles per hour &=laughs:multiple is probably unsafe in itself . 908005_914085
and if four drivers have died in the last nine months I'm sure NASCAR will take some steps to correct that and it doesn't require the involvement of journalists . 914505_922365
are they more likely to take steps if the press puts some heat on them ? 922845_926045
mhm yeah .
the press has already put heat on (th)em . 926285_927565
they're putting heat on themselves . 927645_928725
I don't think it's necessary . 929245_930305

showing pictures of a dead body is not gonna put the heat on (th)em that's necessary to make the changes though . 938395_943275

let's say that a photograph would make it possible for police to catch a criminal . 1117265_1124005

you_know you could <make it> &=laughs:multiple make it as difficult as you want . 1140585_1142985
but the argument on the other side is the police say there's a very good chance we can catch the criminal because someone will will recognize the victim and they'll associate . 1143445_1151285
now it's a much tougher call „ isn't it ? 1151825_1153325

what do you do ? 1155825_1156165

&-um let's let's jump to our role playing game before we get to the reading . 1211545_1216605
&-um don't spend a_lot_of time reading these things but you just wanna get the sense as to which one is more newsworthy . 1217505_1225365
you've got two stories . 1225625_1226565
both these stories broke yesterday „ right ? 1227505_1229445
the New York Times and CBS got the results of their opinion polls showing that Bush enjoys a solid sixty percent popularity . 1230425_1240305
but about half the public's not so sure that he's really in charge . 1241825_1245025
&~s some very interesting statistics about his standing . 1246085_1249945
it has great political significance , has great implications for policy . 1250265_1253905
but the other story is that he apparently is breaking a &~p one of his campaign pledges to restrict &-uh carbon dioxide emissions which scientists say is a major cause of global warming . 1254945_1268505
&-uh you and and we'll have two teams and you'll +//. 1270625_1274105
the main thing you wanna do is say what's wrong with the other team's position „ okay ? 1274325_1277225
that's your main focus , why the other team is wrong . 1277905_1280105
I guess we could just divide it right here . 1280665_1282365
Kat you're on that side Janeiro you're on that side . 1282805_1285365
&-uh you want the poll . 1286085_1288505
the New York Times +//. 1289905_1290545
&~w wait a minute . 1290785_1291465

Bush says he's gonna break his campaign promise to restrict carbon dioxide . 1299985_1303725
one of these two is gonna lead the New York Times . 1304885_1307665
the print edition's gonna be in the upper right hand corner of this morning's paper . 1307885_1310805
no fair if you already saw the print edition . 1311785_1314645
and it'll also be the top story on the online edition when they start the day . 1316585_1321665
but of_course it'll change depending on what other news breaks . 1321845_1324005
okay ? 1324445_1324685
so <take a> just very quickly read through some of the basic facts in these two and then form your caucuses and prepare really powerful arguments against the other side , why they're wrong in terms of what the New York Times should be doing . 1325505_1341845
<what is the> &~f what is the duty of the New York Times to its readers to its profession of journalism and to the nation ? 1342025_1348805

and that was the next not the same day but the next edition of the newspaper . 2819125_2822625
so what's the point of all that ? 2823365_2826965
why why is that so important ? 2827105_2828685
it shows that the &~c you touch base with the community let them know that you're you're being accountable . 2829825_2835165
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so then they ⌋ can understand your position . 2835805_2836805
mhm .
and what &~ef what effect does that have on the reader ? 2838105_2841265
would you imagine ? 2842845_2844005
if you hadta speculate +//. 2844785_2845225
yes ?
well it makes (th)em be like not so outraged and &~th it makes them have more respect for you and think that you're not just publishing for shock value +/. 2845445_2850785
mhm +/.
+, but that you're actually have a legitimate reason . 2850945_2852525
mhm okay . 2852905_2853685
and that you're taking the readers' views into consideration showing some sensitivity giving them an opportunity to to react and &-uh welcoming their response . 2854105_2864365
mhm +/.
+, &-um okay . 2865545_2867825
so those are general principles now let's go into the specifics the case study number thirty they had a choice of two photographs didn't they ? 2868985_2876945
what what were the two photographs and why did they &~choo chose the one they chose ? 2877385_2881645
yeah ?
well the one was the photograph that they published was the &-uh picture of the body of one of the bodies +/. 2882005_2887445
mhm +/.
+, that was covered with a sheet and I mean it's it's graphic enough to where you can tell it is a body and there's blood around the head +/. 2887785_2893445
+, mhm +/.
+, but &-um the other shot that they were gonna use was just a pool of blood and &-uh a notebook and a sandal . 2894145_2900805
and even though there there was no body like like present in that I &~th they they chose the other one because it didn't seem as &-um I guess invasive or ⌈ as ⌉ . 2901545_2912185
⌊ but why ⌋ ? 2912185_2912505
what &~wha . 2912885_2913005
I think that showing I mean you don't see the face of the body in this picture . 2913325_2917785
and it's further away and showing . 2918225_2919485
but you didn't see the face in the other picture either . 2919505_2921085
right but ⌈ I think showing the sandal ⌉ . 2921325_2923985
⌊ so why is the other picture ⌋ why is the other picture more disturbing ? 2921945_2924685
all the blood probably . 2925165_2926525
yeah I think so . 2927725_2928225
the amount of blood . 2928465_2929085
yeah I I think like just the fact of like showing a notebook and and something like that just like remnants it's +/. 2929425_2937245
mhm +/.
+, really grotesque to me . 2937725_2939305
mhm .
Katie ? 2939365_2940285
&-um I think this is something about the thought that the picture of the notebook and the blood was would be like sensationalism . 2940665_2946525
I'm ⌈ trying to find that here ⌉ . 2947445_2948825
⌊ yeah mhm ⌋ yeah . 2948885_2949405
that's right . 2950025_2950565
this is a close one though isn't it ? 2951445_2953205
I mean it's +//. 2953325_2953685
there's a very fine line you know one one shot of the body another shot of blood and they're they're both pretty gruesome . 2953885_2959845
&-um how do you feel about the decision to run any picture ? 2960165_2965745
yeah ? 2966905_2967025
I just have a question that wasn't the only two pictures they had was it ? 2967185_2970205
well I &~th I think they hadta choose between those two +/. 2971085_2973085
⌈ oh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ they were on ⌋ deadline &~af . 2973225_2973825
so why couldn't they &~ha just have shown one of the Jeep after it rolled over or and just told the story about what happened ? 2974085_2979865
⌈ or how about their +//. 2980265_2980705
just their pictures ⌉ ?

yeah . 2982385_2983025
yeah .
okay why ? 2983445_2983865
if they hadta &~sh show one of the &~a from the accident scene . 2983885_2986765
and why would you prefer that ? 2987125_2988545
&~m I don't know . 2990185_2991625
&=laughs .
okay . 2991925_2992425
(be)cause it doesn't I don't know I just think seeing dead bodies in a newspaper I don't . 2992685_2996465
I mean it it bothers you . 2997105_2998205

okay . 2998665_2998905
yeah ? 2999685_2999885
I I mean I agree that it it's bothersome and that would be helpful . 3001025_3003525
but then if you you know after the explanation was made if you look at &-um the letters that they received &-um I was kind_of shocked to think that the reader would I mean that some of these would be &=clears_throat excuse_me sent into the newspaper about +... 3003725_3015945
if you think about basically you know if you think about how many lives were saved from this or if somebody thinks of this image it's it's it is upsetting and it is powerful . 3016445_3022845
and that's why they wanted it in there because once an image like that is stuck in your head it's there . 3023005_3026785
and then whatever possibly whatever images were in the photograph or whatever it is can trigger off those images that you have in your mind and it can prevent something similar from happening . 3026985_3036565
instructional value . 3037225_3039185
yeah ?
I mean &~th they didn't mention it here but also like I think sometimes it hits home more like a picture of the students before an &~im like a a normal +/. 3041005_3048665

this is the boy who's killed outside a convenience store &~i during a robbery . 3093625_3096525

just for the sake of argument somebody disagree . 3151615_3153755
you don't hafta personally agree with it just advocate the position . 3154315_3156815
yeah ? 3157915_3158115
you're an independent paper and you've decided already that you wanna run the photo because it's gonna affect people and it's gonna make people understand the context of the murder more and so &~i it's it's gonna &~f &~y it's gonna be serving the public good by showing this photograph and so you should show it anyway . 3158555_3174195

what are the concerns with him being a minor ? 3175975_3177935
like don't parents have to give permission for minors to be on newspapers ? 3178255_3182095
I know that's . 3182555_3183235
well I mean &~th the purpose of that is to protect someone who later in life keep doesn't wanna have this shadow hanging over them . 3184725_3192345
unfortunately this this young person is dead so it's the fact &~th it's a juvenile doesn't matter . 3192745_3198265
right ? 3199045_3200385
there are no implications for the future (be)cause unfortunately this person doesn't have any further life that's gonna be affected . 3201445_3207725
the people affected are the family . 3208305_3209445
right you don't have a an issue of of withholding the name of a juvenile for the usual reasons . 3211335_3216215
you might have it for some other reason . 3217155_3218355

I think you'd have a_lot_o(f) trouble . 3228815_3230035

they did also decide to put it in black and white and not color ⌈ it's one of the decisions that they made ⌉ . 3297865_3301985

&-uh I'm not so crazy about the front page of the New York Times being in color I can see stuff inside being in color . 3350665_3358045
&-um if if the New York Times decided to run a photograph of a dead person for some legitimate reason then they'd hafta make a &~re really tough decision about color or not . 3358785_3373205
they've got the picture in color are they gonna run it in color ? 3373305_3375285
that would be a tough decision . 3376045_3376965
&-um okay case study thirty one (0.10) this man apparently slipped and fell . 3378505_3394865
alright ?
regardless why he got on top of this tower once he was there he slipped and fell that's a fact . 3395665_3403805
&-uh it's not clearly suicide he may have intended suicide or wasn't sure or whatever but it +//. 3404985_3410585
you can't say for sure this man was committing suicide at the moment he fell . 3410985_3414025

&~wh how does that impact on the decision whether to run in the pictures or not yeah ? 3417205_3420505
well &-um they had a policy on no running suicides . 3420605_3424325

yeah I was gonna say something similar to that like they have the runaway teen policy <we read> we read about like +/. 3517675_3522315

isn't that in the reading for today ? 3547405_3548125
it's because &-um people &~h heard about it or were already hearing about it . 3551685_3554765
so &~th so many people were there and everybody was interested in it so well we'll run it . 3555565_3561105

and you know as far as this this suicide the difference between <like running> a suicide or whatever because of copycat things they were concerned about that and they still ran it . 3563405_3570785
