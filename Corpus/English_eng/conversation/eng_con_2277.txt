I did this with somebody else and the other girl was like a really
You just have to make sure you know where the mic is and make sure
like if you're facing in that direction, it's probably not going to
Ok . 13746_14739
You just think about it . 14739_17916
I mean it's just like we record stuff for music all the time and we
That goes to show how much I know what I'm doing . 25801_28773
Tape recorders . 28773_31458
It's one of those technological things +... 31458_35310
fun . 35310_36880
that, you know, I don't know very well but I can use a tape
Ok, that's good, because I can't . 41239_43346
So guess what . 43346_47533
What ? 47533_48526
Mr Thompson told me that I've got an A for the semester . 48526_52446
Oh, yes ! 52446_53849
Because of my breathrough . 53849_55296
He like came in during intermission at the concert and he was like
+" That's what I've been trying to get you to do all semester . 58473_62105
You've just earned your A ! 62105_63524
Yes, finally ! 63524_67678
So what breakthrough was this ? 67678_69247
He was trying to get me to play louder and fuller and with like a
And it finally like +... 79650_82250
it wasn't working . 82250_83903
Like he was trying to like do everything he could think of to play
And then he gave me a new reed . 87657_90136
Like he gave me his new reeds that he's using . 90136_92941
And like I put the reed on and ⁎boom⁎ ! 92941_96452
It was like perfect . 96452_98969
It was so much better . 98969_100910
It was exactly what he was trying to get me to do and it was an
Oh, wow . 103427_104830
It was not a lack of understanding between me and him . 104830_107885
And it was not for lack of his telling me what to do and me
I just needed different reeds . 112632_114572
Oh, this is really good ! 114572_116143
I know ! 116143_117173
It was such a simple answer to a problem we've been trying to fix
Wait +... 120722_122208
So how old was your other reed ? 122208_123034
It's not that it was old . 123034_125059
It's a different type . 125059_126107
Oh . 126107_126833
This type was better . 126833_127797
Ok . 127797_128403
Like, well it's better for me, not for everybody . 128403_130836
Yeah . 130836_131291
Some people don't like them, but I like them . 131291_133687
Oh, ok . 133687_134718
So I have to buy two boxes of reeds tomorrow . 134718_137319
Oh, jeez . 137319_138367
Wait, how often do you have to change them ? 138367_139853
These last longer so it will probably last me like a month . 139853_145037
And then I have to start breaking in new reeds . 145037_148109
Wait, only a month ? 148109_149329
Wow . 149329_150527
Well my old ones last only about a week . 150527_152856
Oh jeez . 152856_155978
That's pretty bad . 155978_157753
Reeds ? 157753_158700
Yeah, they're pretty expensive to do . 158700_161218
Oh no . 161218_162582
But the new ones, apparently for him Mr Thompson he'd been using
Whereas in a normal box of the ones that I'm using now, they last
Wow . 178658_179317
So it's a lot better deal . 179317_181817
Yeah . 181817_182189

The sophomore vocal majors were throwing their cast party for the,
And part of it, like, revolved around their solfege class . 213042_217317

Everyone was told about it so I was like +"/. 221420_224998
+" I have to spend time with my mother, so I won't be able to go . 224998_228850
Yeah especially since she like came all the way from Texas . 228850_230775
Exactly . 230775_231807
exactly . 231807_233626
But I did go shopping ! 233626_235522
Shopping is fun . 235522_237462
Do you want to see what the stuff looks like ? 237462_239320
Yes . 239320_239708
Ok . 239708_240434
Here's the shirt . 240434_241921
this is pretty plain . 241921_245181
Oh it's a really pretty color though . 245181_251209
I like this color . 251209_252695
It happens to be one of the few that looks good on me . 252695_254924
And my skirt, I hung up . 254924_257320
Oooh, that's pretty too . 257320_261983
It's this nice fabric . 261983_264129
And it's like +... 264129_264872
it's really long, which I love . 264872_269208
I love longer skirts . 269208_270406

Oh so it's like a poofy one . 274160_275274
Yeah . 275274_275729

So that's the new skirt +... 281319_283159
And then the shoes . 283159_284645
Shoes are so +... 284645_287124
Oh yeah, we have to see the shoes . 287124_288982
Ok . 288982_290097
here's the tennis shoes . 290097_292176
Oh, those are pretty . 292176_297360
Black and pink ! 297360_298680
They're kind of like Cathy's . 298680_299961
kind of . 299961_300992
I like them . 300992_301735
I was just looking at them and they fit better than the other ones
And these are so adorable . 306648_311312
These are my new concert shoes . 311312_313335
Oh, those are really pretty ! 313335_316020
Wow . 316020_317627
And well what I was looking at a pair of black pants at the Gap
They fit well and everything, but they weren't long enough though .
Oh no ! 326338_327165
They would have been okay if like they came down to here and they
Because this is a regular and most Gap pants come in a long . 337651_340745
Oh, I hope you get them . 340745_342769
But if not, my mom will just buy some at the Gap in Houston and
Like they were fine normally but I had bought the shoes already and
Oh, darn . 357175_358289
So that wouldn't have worked . 358289_360064
I hate it when that happens . 360064_361921
So since you know the whole purpose of buying black shoes is for me
You know, black pants anything black I buy is for my concerts . 367056_370095
Yeah . 370095_371126
I wear other black, but still . 371126_373150
That's the main purpose . 373150_375972
So are you doing anything for carnival ? 375972_382522
Um . 382522_384129

So I won't be doing anything Carnival related then . 418764_421381
And I'll have to go to carnival like to the midway on Thursday or
Yeah . 424708_425990
Because Saturday I have to do PYSO . 425990_428606
Are they making you go to PYSO on Saturday even though it's
Well they're not related to the school . 431312_433420
Oh yeah . 433420_434656
So they don't care . 434656_435415

And the day before my jury, of course . 454141_455190
Oh man . 455190_456947
I'm going to have a jury on Monday . 456947_458312
Mr Thompson has already decided what I'm going to play for my
for my recital next year . 463968_465658
We were talking about it today, like we got all my jury things and
+" This would be a really good recital piece and we need to go
And he's like +"/. 472817_473544
+" So we'll do this; it'll be like the show piece, the main thing .
And we'll have a couple of other shorter pieces for you to do . 478207_482211
so I was like Ok . 482211_483037
so he was like +"/. 483037_484068
+" I think you should do this, this, and this . 484068_486669
it would be a good, like, contrast . 486669_487866
so I was like +"/. 487866_488609
+" ok, sure, whatever . 488609_490756
So I'll have to order some of that over the summer and, you
So you're going to be practicing for a long time . 499672_502439
I'm always practicing . 502439_504092
That's true . 504092_505473
I didn't practice today cause I had a lesson . 505473_510408
But most other days I practice . 510408_514289
It's a musician's life . 514289_515032
We get used to it . 515032_517345
That's true . 517345_517838
I am so excited, though . 517838_522546
we get two days off of school ! 522546_523948
So am I . 523948_526178
It's not carnival that I'm excited about so much as that we like
The only thing I have definite plans that for carnival is the fact
Yeah . 538726_539719
than I normally do . 539719_540212
I can always use some time to catch up on my sleep and having like
When do you usually have to wake up ? 548469_549750
Um . 549750_552018
Mondays and Wednesdays I have to wake up at eight thirty so that I
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday I have class at nine thirty so I
Oh, ok . 572246_573361
So . 573361_574309
it's closer to the time that I get up on the other days . 574309_577281
But if I don't set my alarm for that early, I wouldn't get up that
And then I get up at like nine fifteen on Saturdays so that I can,
Cause I have to catch a bus like twenty five minutes before it
Ok . 599284_602999
and it won't get better . 602999_607169
Yeah, well actually it will get better because once I'm like not in
It's not usually in the mornings . 618314_620022
Oh, so you'll get to sleep ! 620022_621575
Cause a lot of us a lot of musicians, like, they do their paid
So they don't have them getting up early in the morning after
So they're getting most of their rehearsals done in the afternoon .
Oh, ok . 640606_643040
And I think that's when Mr Thompson has most of his students . 643040_644981
Every once in a while he has a morning one when they need extra
Oh, so it does get better for you . 649522_653609
It does get better . 653609_655483
