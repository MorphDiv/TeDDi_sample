well first thing is I found that article . 4115_5975
oh thank you .
(0.6) .
that was seventy nine I think . 17135_21175
what year were you born ? 21255_21995
seventy nine . 22295_22855
that's what I thought . 23055_23615
&=laughs .
actually a_lot_of the research was done in seventy nine I've been noticing . 27575_29955
like Reddy wrote his article in seventy nine . 30495_32715
yeah that was the big metaphor seventy nine eighty . 33035_35255
&-uh when I wrote that I had read a a draft one of many prepublication drafts of Lakoff and Johnson . 36335_45875
and so I knew pretty much what was in it . 46755_48615
but &-uh book didn't come out until later . 49915_51895
yeah .
thank you . 54255_55235
and I found an amazing amount of &=laughs:S1 information so I haven't gotten to get through all of it yet but &-um . 56715_69295
has she gotten recording levels ? 70215_71295
I think so . 72995_73995
okay . 74135_74415
alright .
&=pause_while_reading alright .
okay so these were from the web or from the literature ? 74855_84595
I found one useful one from the web most of (th)em from the web were &-um there was something that was set up as a a conversational thing for a linguistics class and so it was just questions and replies +/. 85175_100935
oh I see . 101395_101835
+, and there were four hundred and twenty one entries and the first +//. 102035_104275
&=laughs:S1 out_of the first fifty I think forty of them were +/. 104435_106335
+, oh okay +/. 107015_108055
+, were just questions and replies that weren't too helpful . 108115_110815
+, uhuh +/.
+, but I did find I actually found something in Japanese that if I could find some way to get it translated because the whole thing was on the conduit metaphor and there were just random &-um translations into English every third page or so but . 111445_127465
oh my word . 127665_128485
yeah . 128805_128945
wow . 129605_130025
well ask Jessica I guess . 130385_133525
yeah . 134685_134985
she said that she's not +/. 135165_136125
that good ? 136605_136985
+, that good with characters . 137105_138005
she's better with ⌈ speaking . 138365_138985
so ⌉ .
⌊ oh yeah ⌋ . 138935_139495
could be . 140295_140575
still there's lots_of Japanese linguists . 140915_144975
the most exciting thing I found though +... 145795_147515
is this . 149875_150555
it's Wong Scollon and +/. 151135_155015
Scollon +/.
+, here's the the first page of the abstract . 155555_160235
this is from Multilingua sixteen one nineteen seven ninety seven . 163055_169935
&=pause_while_reading ah root metaphors . 170535_175735
okay yes I remember that . 176175_177395
that used to be +... 178555_179355
that used to be the big phrase about the middle of the century . 182775_185735
root metaphors for civilization . 186215_187895
has a better &~re theory theory &~place replaced it now or ? 192855_195695
well +... 196935_197475
they weren't exactly looking at metaphor . 202395_204395
they were more looking for things that motivate cultures . 205435_209735
okay . 210275_210695
&-uh like the root metaphors of fascism . 211995_215035
that sort of thing . 215415_215935
okay . 216695_217015
she looked specifically at Cantonese and English metaphors and then . 218845_222825
right . 223125_223185
well she's got a &~m &~a a more modern sense of what metaphor means . 223385_225805
okay +/. 226005_226145
+, yeah . 226145_226325
+, okay . 227005_227325
+, based on the human body . 227805_232385
why am I not surprised ? 232585_233545
&=pause_while_reading ooh that's an interesting take on the American metaphor . 249025_251245
&{l=READING an abstract ideal trying to free itself from biological and social restrictions through communication . 253625_258805
&}l=READING yeah . 259345_259465
inside and outside . 260045_261085
and so she said that a container metaphor and a colonization metaphor were the two primary metaphors in English . 261445_270885
what was the first one ? 271245_272265
&~a &~w just the conduit metaphor the container metaphor . 272925_275465
&~a &~a and ⌈ colonization ⌉ . 275785_276645
⌊ and then ⌋ colonization . 276735_277335
right .
and she says that it comes from American popular American myth . 278155_283535
of .
westward ho ? 284855_286095
yeah . 286435_286835
ooh . 289875_290215
that really does cling you know that &-uh that resonates in a_lot_of different ways . 290775_296875
I like that . 297515_298195
ooh colonization .
you get imperialism . 298555_302095
you get hegemony . 302595_303655
<you get> you get the gender wars . 304985_307605
you get +... 309125_309605
you get east west north south . 313445_315865
(0.6) .
she also talks about the importance of creative development within the individual . 316925_325325
creative development ? 325905_326805
right . 327145_327345
but within the individual rather than creative development of the entire network of the entire social network which is what the Cantonese metaphor is which is the opposite but she says that &-uh the American metaphor really focuses on the very self-centered creative development of the individual . 327855_347995
and I think that works with the colonization idea too because it's a very +... 348875_351895
it's the very small group of +... 353555_355495
yeah . 358955_359155
it also suggests that the American view of the self is sort_of takes the mind body difference wholeheartedly and identifies with the mind it isn't integrated with the body . 359395_374175
whereas the Chinese metaphor is integrated +/. 375035_377275
mhm +/.
+, and the Chinese individuals are personally integrated and they integrate with their society +... 379235_384675
which probably has a whole lot more survival value than the American metaphor as evidenced by the success of Chinese culture . 387445_393745
mm .
ooh that sounds like fun . 396085_397205
colonized self . 397845_400425
free xxx colonized self . 401065_407845
oh the the self has been colonized by the body ? 408125_411725
by . 412145_412805
the self has been colonized by these individual containers for not necessarily for meaning but for aspects of the self so actually the American data that she has is from Carbaugh's study on Donahue &=laughs and so &=laughs:S1 it's from talk shows and it's a_lot_of talk about &-um feminist theory and how within the female individual there's a an aspect of feminism . 414645_444625
and so +... 448855_449275
I think that's what she means by colonization of . 453335_455215
yeah I think +/. 456215_456735
⌈ the ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &~wha ⌋ &~she she's maybe dealing with a +... 457275_458915
a gloss . 460335_461275
obviously it's a structure . 461695_463055
obviously it's complicated . 463835_464935
and maybe colonization is the best she can get to . 465795_467915
but I don't think we should necessarily take the name as meaning too much . 468335_471435
+, okay +/.
+, but yes that sounds like &-uh definitely worth reading . 471915_474695
mm yum . 476845_477025
she actually has an appendix at the back too of Chinese proverbs &-uh &~m . 477145_481145
&{l=READING oh . 481805_482545
explode big cauldron reveal somebody else's inside story ooh . 483845_490065
&}l=READING .
actually in the last part of that of her metaphorical analysis of Chinese +//. 490825_496585
what ?
seven mouths eight tongue all talking at once . 498065_500865
she says that school teachers say that to classrooms of children to make them be quiet . 501445_504785
wow wonderful . 506645_507345
Chinese are so earthy . 507925_508845
&{l=READING teeth brush brush . 509625_510565
&}l=READING &=laughs &{l=READING to be voluble to boast of oneself &}l=READING . 511465_513325
&=laughs &{l=READING teeth chop chop same thing . 517065_518425
&}l=READING &=laughs .
and so she was saying that in contrast to the American conduit metaphor that the Chinese metaphor &-um holds a strict importance on keeping what's inside inside and keeping what's outside outside so . 520775_534835
and face in the middle . 536215_537015
hm .
okay . 537955_540755
yeah . 541195_541455
yeah exactly . 542055_543355
hm .
you seriously interested in China ? 544955_548455
yeah . 549675_550175
I took the Chuang Tzu course last ⌈ semester . 550755_553515
yeah .
Chuang Tzu ⌉ .
⌊ oh you did ? 553515_554155
Chuang Tzu ?

oh ?

+, yeah ⌈ he does ⌉ . 560635_561295
+, ⌊ ever anywhere ⌋ . 561295_561675
&-uh in that case let me recommend a book called Bridge of Birds . 562915_567295
it's a fantasy novel . 568515_569435
I use it in my &-uh metaphors class . 569895_572235
freshman seminar at the RC . 573795_574975
it's terrific . 575415_576015
+, okay +/. 577585_577785
+, &-um and it is a novel and it's a very fantastic novel it's a very Chinese novel &-uh but all the facts except for the you know the fantastic parts +/. 578445_589225
+, mhm +/.
+, but it's hard to tell which are fantastic and which are just Chinese . 590285_592845
(be)cause Chinese history is a little fantastic in places &-uh are true I mean all the &-uh almost everybody in the book that's actually sounds like they oughta be a historical personage was a historical personage and did something like what they did in the book so it is you're never quite sure where you are in this book . 594325_612545
very interesting . 613465_614065
okay . 614665_615085
that was my first introduction to Eastern thought ⌈ and ⌉ . 616325_618805
⌊ well that's ⌋ the right one I think . 619025_621725
ah Confucious is a waste of time &~t as an introduction I think . 624305_627125
<all it> all it does is give you the idea you don't wanna go there . 628045_630685
but Chuang Tzu . 631685_632145
hm .
yeah . 632785_634885
okay . 638825_639205
&-uh so how does this fit in with your experiment ? 639565_643885
okay . 644645_644945
I'm starting to realize that metaphors of self in within the American framework and the Chinese framework have a_lot to do with the metaphors for communication . 647095_660215
and that might be something that's sort_of inherent just in the nature of communication but I thought it was an interesting thing that both Wong Scollon and &-um Carbaugh who were studying communication put such an emphasis on the different cultural ideas of self . 662265_681785
well they're calling it self . 682265_685605
&-uh the question is exactly which variety of concept they're talking about . 685975_692955
there are a number +/. 693155_693775
mhm +/.
+, and they can be distinguished there's probably whole branches of philosophy that do nothing more than distinguish soul from mind from self from personality from +/. 694295_706015
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-uh ⌋ you know a whole lot of other stuff . 707375_709795
+, mhm +/.
+, id ego &-uh +... 710595_713495
and I tend to think of it as well +... 715805_721925
one of a number of possible ways of the &~m I tend to think of it as the mind but you know that includes all that stuff and there's a_lot_of different ways to talk about it . 723465_736005
there is definitely an inside going on in almost everything . 736365_739565
I think it's interesting though that as for my research the only part that really matters is the socialized &~real the socially realized conception of self . 740495_749355
so what comes through in social institutions . 750215_754355
comes through ? 755495_756315
right . 756895_757615
like ⌈ within ⌉ . 758035_759215
⌊ to whom ⌋ from what using what channel ? 759215_761215
okay . 761535_761975
&=laughs &-uh through religion through the dominant literature philosophy arts &-um +/. 762645_769105
⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 769425_769525
+, ⌊ you look ⌋ at Chinese literature and especially &~i I really I don't know too much about this subject but even look at Chuang Tzu and the fact that the book was compiled . 769525_781725
inner chapters and outer chapters . 782745_783925
and then the extra outer outer chapters that don't necessarily have anything to do with specifically with ⌈ Chuang Tzu himself ⌉ . 784075_791655
⌊ yeah it doesn't exactly ⌋ read like a novel does it ? 791655_793595
&=laughs .
no . 793835_794095
and so there's &~no there really isn't that much of an importance placed on plot . 794635_798095
there also isn't an importance placed on individual authorship . 798395_800755
it's all called Chuang Tzu and no one has really done all that much work to find out who wrote the rest of it and it really doesn't matter . 801255_809375
⌈ no ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ there ⌋ probably isn't documentation . 809635_810755
+, hm +/.
+, but in Western literature the author is really important . 811855_817715
well up to a point . 818515_819435
ah there you get into the de_re@s:lat de_dicto@s:lat distinction . 820455_824275
mhm +/.
+, &-um what was it <there's a> there's a famous joke about the classic professor who spent his career proving that the Iliad and the Odyssey were not composed by Homer but by another blind Greek poet of the same name +... 825475_842475
whereas Virgil if you tried to do the same thing about the Eniad it wouldn't be a joke . 843915_851515
it'd be dull but it wouldn't be a joke . 852375_854395
(be)cause Virgil was a historic personage . 855275_856815
we know other things about Virgil . 856915_858055
but we know nothing else about Homer except number one he was blind number two he was Greek and number three he composed the Iliad and the Odyssey . 858275_865395
or at least did something that stuck his name on those particular tellings of them . 865655_869975
okay +... 870615_870875
but what I think is interesting is not necessarily the de_dicto@s:lat de_re@s:lat distinction and what actually matters but what the different societies think matters . 874825_885985
because +/.
yes +/. 886745_887025
+, okay .
yes exactly . 887905_889305
so that's what I think is interesting in a concept of self . 889805_892685
uhuh .
yeah . 892845_894805
I think that's right . 895125_895845
&-uh and we don't exactly &~ha it's not like some things it's not like metaphors for a number of phenomena where we have physical reality to fall back on as something to reflect them off . 896105_908605
but nobody has any idea what self means if anything . 909425_913025
except everybody has the idea that they're inside and everybody else is inside them their their own skulls or bodies or persona or whatever . 914065_922945
mhm +/.
+, &-um and that in a sense you can't get out and you can't figure out what's going on other places . 924125_928825
so there's a basic basic container metaphor . 930285_932525
but beyond that it can be elaborated in all kinds of different ways . 933885_936705
it could be porous . 937545_938285
it could be it could be opaque . 939085_941085
could be &-um with many doors and windows . 942005_945805
and you get into things like houses Freud's house metaphors . 946145_949485
you dream of a house you're dreaming of your mind . 950105_951785
and you're trapped inside secret passages attics basements . 953045_957765
see and that's interesting because the something that Scollon said was that &-um one of the really dominant communication metaphors for Chinese is of bodily secretions so the idea of the container is very porous . 957965_975305
that sounds so Chinese yep . 975425_976625
and then one of the dominant metaphors for English &~m for American English metaphor &-um is more of a concrete container more of a house doors and windows box +/. 976655_989335
mhm +/.
+, ⌈ type container ⌉ .
⌊ light in the attic ⌋ yes . 990095_991715
yes .
I wonder if the Chinese if the homunculus ever the theory ever ever had any currency in Chinese philosophy . 992875_1004235
I don't know . 1005395_1005815
you know the the homunculus is up here there's this person behind your eyes who's sort_of driving . 1007375_1013075
the question is you know what's in their head ? 1013855_1015895
well it's another one even smaller etcetera . 1016015_1017835
right +/.
+, as long as it's as long as it &-uh &~it it's tail recursive then it's okay you know each one gets simpler and simpler . 1018555_1024515
but you do run the risk of infinite regress . 1025535_1027735
&-um but the it sounds like the Chinese don't bother with that . 1029325_1034585
they're there and they're one person . 1034745_1036865
and there's no nonsense . 1037825_1038705
and it seems like the important part is that they're within the social network . 1039605_1042845
not that their one person +/. 1043625_1044805
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ is ⌋ a creative autonomous being but that they're part of the social structure . 1046005_1052285
and of their own family structure . 1053105_1054525
sounds right . 1057065_1057785
sounds right I mean something hasta give this incredible strength to Chinese culture . 1058825_1064725
I mean it's minimum twenty five hundred years old . 1065005_1070705
and while <it's been changed> it's been changed real slowly and it's it's resilient and it's tough as hell . 1072205_1079005
just unbelievably successful . 1080145_1081585
Roman culture isn't around anymore Greek culture isn't around anymore old English culture isn't around anymore . 1082405_1087725
Chinese culture is just keeps on plugging . 1088765_1090785
(0.10) hm that would be that would make an interesting thesis there &-uh oh &-uh while we're on the subject of houses let me recommend another book . 1093025_1109865
&-um it's (0.12) the Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard . 1110245_1129405

this is a Fauconnier_Turner thingy . 1375155_1377435
okay . 1377475_1377755
their stuff works pretty good the problem is that it's so general that I can't see that there isn't anything that isn't a blend . 1382055_1387855
okay . 1389525_1389705
so the generic space . 1389945_1391565

you have the input and output . 1416365_1417645
uhuh +/.

I mean really simply speaking . 1422505_1424085
yeah . 1424585_1427065
essentially that's where you store that's where you &~s you store common properties . 1427465_1431245
okay . 1431845_1432225

it's like the tongue ready position right ? 1443075_1444995

&=pause_while_reading yeah right that's the generalized one . 1449975_1457755

&~d do you know &~any much about programming ? 1471895_1475395
a little . 1476015_1476655
what have you studied ? 1477775_1478255
C ?
actually I haven't technically studied program programming but I have some outside knowledge of it so . 1479255_1488435
you have ? 1489835_1490295
just some knowledge of it from working with the project ⌈ and ⌉ . 1491195_1495735
⌊ oh ⌋ I see . 1495735_1496095
okay . 1496295_1496395
&-um well there's this kind_of programming called object oriented programming . 1497005_1503085
and it's &-uh ordinarily +... 1504825_1510485
programming started off with you know everything was <do this> do this <do this> do this <do this> do this . 1512725_1517305
it's all orders . 1517405_1517945
and then it turned out that the smart way to do it was to define large complicated structures very much in the way SGML does . 1519325_1529965
and <once you> once you define that stuff then you can write a program for that particular thing like suppose you want to you want to add complex numbers . 1531945_1541165
well you can't just use a regular plus . 1542505_1543985
so you hafta have a special meaning of plus for complex numbers . 1545145_1548185
so but you don't wanna have to try and worry about is this a complex number do I use this plus or that plus or something else . 1549805_1556045
so what you do is you say &-uh &~w I won't worry about is this a number I'll just send it a plus and let it decide which plus to use (be)cause it knows . 1556565_1564305
that's called operator overloading . 1566245_1567785
plus is a is an operator . 1568245_1569745
and it's overloaded because it has one meaning in this context one meaning in that context one meaning in some other context and so on . 1570545_1576785
and that's this kind of thing . 1577685_1579345

I mean what's it getting me ? 1610055_1610955
it looks more like &=gesturing that than this . 1611475_1613955

&-um just from looking at this at first what I thought immediately was that it might have some +... 1623055_1631775
it might be a way to correlate this idea of the self with conversational metaphor . 1632555_1641495

+, using some kind_of a model like this . 1642715_1645135
mm yes . 1645475_1646075
yes I think that's right . 1646475_1647715
that was how I thought ⌈ it might be useful ⌉ . 1647995_1648855
⌊ yes I think ⌋ that's right . 1648855_1649555
well &~i &~i clearly the self is a product of conversation of communication . 1649715_1654855
as you say it comes through . 1655615_1656675
that's all we can know about other people is what we observe and what we communicate with them and the inferences we draw . 1657795_1663935
and and how well their &-uh our internal predictions are met or exceeded or abashed by &~v various things . 1665205_1677585
okay .
+, &-uh so &~i there's a sense in which communication and the self sort_of mutually create each_other so that would make them <a good> a good candidate for this sort_of thing . 1679005_1689225
&-uh did they go through I've forgotten what +//. 1689755_1697235
there's a special name for a special a one one of their best examples &-um Turner and Fauconnier is &-uh like lemme see X is the Y of Z . 1697835_1712015

about metaphor in German and Spanish ? 1787785_1789645
ah okay . 1790025_1790785

the last thing that I was considering was a translation task . 2335985_2340605

⌈ so ⌉ +/. 2349725_2349825

<then you> &~ha then you basically get to the meaning after you've been through about four or five steps . 2386035_2389815

okay . 2394195_2394495
+, at least with those languages . 2394655_2395655

and I think this one's more sophisticated . 2427435_2428575

yeah plus if you ask for a translation task you're introducing many more ideas and &-um many more sort_of tasks that are going to stimulate other things . 2430855_2446995

you've heard of Pete Pete Becker tells that when he does a web search on his name at AL Becker he he finds that mostly he's referred to on the web in terms of &-uh &-uh Becker's demonstration as it's now called . 2454855_2471875

which is &~h he he does it in classes and lectures sometimes to demonstrate exactly how variable talk is . 2474675_2483455
and he &-uh the the bigger the audience the better . 2484595_2488195
&-uh he says <I'm going to> I'm going to do something I'll say start then I'll do something then I'll say stop . 2489195_2494735
I want you all to pay very close attention to me and then I want you to write down what I did . 2494915_2497895
and he says start and then he usually like walks up to a table and drops a book on the table and then says stop . 2499915_2504515
and then they all write it down . 2506675_2507555
and then they collect them . 2508895_2509615

okay . 2551715_2553295
yeah . 2555155_2555475
okay well <I think> I think we're clicking on enough epistemological ideas here . 2555565_2559085
alright .
so &-uh is this beginning to &-uh to sound more like it might be a &-um be or or become a &-um a thesis idea ? 2560865_2571685

I'd be interested to look more into that and see how I could combine them . 2617915_2624855
okay . 2625535_2625855
well &-um there's no problem from the linguistics side . 2626115_2629895
we &-uh we steal philosophy all the time no problem . 2630675_2633215
&-um so I would guess find out from the philosophy side &-uh what they think about &=sound_effect empiricism . 2634975_2642715

and then I was also considering doing separate doing something separate for each . 2651805_2659665

girl I know who's living in Switzerland for the summer . 2805115_2806935
now for Spanish I have some contacts in Ecuador and some in Bolivia . 2807835_2814995
let me see +... 2817255_2817975

oh you &~kno &~n there are a number of other people around that have have &-uh have contacts though . 2834825_2840405
<you could> &-uh you could put a &-um &-um a message out to you know the linguistics faculty say you know I I would like to be able to talk to or to do a little experiment &-uh via email with &-um native speakers of the following languages . 2841535_2864035
&-uh if you happen to know of any that you you wouldn't mind me sending a little questionnaire to just &-uh send their email . 2864865_2872505
+, okay +/.
+, what kind of response rate are you looking for ? 2875085_2877685
that's gonna be the issue . 2878665_2879705
they're not there and they're not taking your course you know so . 2880645_2883265
yeah well the last time we had twelve native speakers of English and twelve nonnative . 2883705_2890825
and we really only carried out the research for a week and a half two weeks . 2892495_2897715
&-um since it was a group project and we did have kinda short notice we didn't really have the time to get that many participants . 2898155_2908075
but I think the fact that in that short of an amount of time that many people replied a_lot_of people replied the next day I think it's because email is not invasive . 2908555_2918555
it gets there quickly +/. 2918775_2919535
mhm +/.
+, and it comes back right away . 2919755_2920755

nobody can tell whether you've seen it and if you wanna ignore it you can ignore it and yeah . 2921895_2925275
yeah .
+, that makes sense . 2925575_2926995
&-um alright so I guess you just keep going until you get an adequate response rate . 2927935_2932755
yeah .
and I really +//. 2933195_2934155
I don't even know what to expect for that . 2934335_2936075
right . 2936395_2936515
well how many you gotta have this statistically significant size right ? 2937455_2943535
what kind of end are you looking for ideally in terms of responses ? 2943995_2947195
ideally ? 2950235_2950795
I would like twenty five from each group and +/. 2951115_2955535
⌈ twenty five each language ⌉ ? 2955795_2956635

unhunh .
and they all getting the same variants on the same questionnaire everything's in English you're not gonna do the translation task &-uh there's only those two tasks you can randomize it without any difficulty &-uh yeah . 2970885_2989265
and then yes I would say that's a pretty simple protocol . 2989905_2996825
&-um have you looked into what statistical tools you're planning to get out_of this ? 2997865_3005265

okay . 3011745_3011825
&-um . 3012625_3012965

I would like to take Stats four oh two though ⌈ maybe this summer ⌉ ? 3022725_3027525

okay . 3059805_3059825
and they might be able to think of something really fancy that &-uh because of the way it's set up . 3060465_3065605
