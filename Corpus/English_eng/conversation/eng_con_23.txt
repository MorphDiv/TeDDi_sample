I'm telling a story about two men who at some point in time made an
that they would come back at a particular restaurant .
so the man was there at a particular location where he was waiting
and an officer came up .
and was asking him, I guess, how his day was .
and what he was standing around for .
and he told him that he was waiting for his friend .
I think it was Bob .
was it Bob ?
or Jimmy ?
anyway, he asked the officer anyway about +//.
the officer asked him, rather, about his friend .
and whether or not or how long he would actually wait before his
so he told him that he would give him at least an half an hour .
so the officer just bid him farewell .
and you_know and told him that he hoped that he enjoy his stay .
so as time went on .
and the guy was waiting there .
he ended up being approached by another person .
and you_know, he said +"/.
+" hello, Jimmy .
I'm not sure about the names, .
I forgot the names .
but anyway, he said +"/.
+" hello, Jimmy .
+" good to see you .
and he said +"/.
+" hey Bob .
+" how are you today .
+" good to see you .
+" and glad you made it back .
and at that time, they just walked along .
and they started talking about the old neighborhood .
and a_lot_of things that weren't there .
especially the restaurant where they met twenty years ago .
so the guy had offered another restaurant that was supposedly
and he said that we can go there to talk .
but as they were walking, the guy, Bob, had kind_of looked at him
trying to figure out was this the person he was waiting for for
and he noticed something different .
so he felt that the features in his face were a little bit more
I guess the nose or whatever kind_of indicated to him this couldn't
so he just kind_of backed back .
and said +"/.
+" you're not Jimmy .
said +"/.
+" who are you ?
that's when the guy proceeded to tell him that you_know he was
and kind_of seeing you_know exactly what he was doing and all that
and he just told him that he was wanted somewhere else in another
and he told him that he had police officers waiting for him around
so the guy was very surprised .
but <he didn't kind_of> he didn't run away or anything
he just told him you_know “okay” .
so he gave him a little note .
he said +"/.
+" by the way, someone told me to give you this little note
so he took the note .
and the guy read the note, which indicated that he knew who he was
Officer_Wells .
and he ended up explaining to him in the note that he knew that he
and he didn't have enough heart to actually arrest him himself .
so that's why he brought another person in disguise to play as him
so that point they just walked around the corner .
well, I guess I can talk about maybe an experience of when I was
and hadn't been at school for awhile .
and my friend Earlene and Diane, they kind_of gave me a call to see
and why I was out .
so anyway, they ended up calling me .
and I was talking to my girlfriend Earlene .
and she was saying everybody's trying to figure out why you haven't
and I'm like +"/.
+" well I've been out because I had the measles .
she said +"/.
+" oh we were trying to figure out what was going on with
so I continued to tell her exactly you_know why I was down and out
and my mom wouldn't let me go outside and all that .
so she ended up changing the conversation .
she said +"/.
+" by the way, Diane said that she's going to end up
+" she said she was going to end up kicking your behind .
I'm like +"/.
+" kick my behind ?
+" for what ?
+" well, she heard that you were talking about her .
+" and she was trying to figure out why you were saying you_know what
and I'm like +"/.
+" well, what was said ?
so anyway, she had told me that I had made comments about certain
and she didn't think it was nice for me to say .
and I'm still trying to figure out at what point in time did I say
I've been in the house .
hadn't been outside playing .
so when did this take place ?
so anyhow I said +"/.
+" well, you know what .
+" I'm not going to even say anymore .
+" I want to talk to Diane myself .
so I got dressed .
got out of my bed .
and went around to really talk to her to see exactly what was going
so anyway, when I got to her house, you_know, I went to the door
and I said is Diane home ?
and they said +"/.
+" hold up one minute .
so Diane came to the door .
so I said +"/.
+" well Diane, I'm trying to figure out exactly what was
+" Earlene called me .
+" and she told me that you had said that I was around talking about
and I said +"/.
+" how can that be because I've been in the house sick .
so one thing led to another .
but anyway, it escalated into a big fight .
so we ended up rolling in the streets .
and tearing off clothes .
and I mean just really you_know going for it .
but <after it all> after all that took place we ended up finding
so I had to end up going back after we kind_of you_know got our
and people kind_of broke us up and all that .
<it really got to the to> the ball of the whole story was
so I was trying to figure out why would somebody end up saying
or even making comments to other people you_know just to put you
so it kind_of bothered me .
but I got over it .
but I kicked some butt at the same time .
