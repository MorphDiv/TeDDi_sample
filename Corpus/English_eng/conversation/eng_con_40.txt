this is a story that spoke of a gentleman who went to meet his
and he stood in the doorway of once was a restaurant .
and the policeman came by .
and asked him why he was standing there .
he indicated that he had planned to meet a good friend <and he>
one went to the West to make his fortune .
and the other one stayed in New_York okay .
and <at that time> at that time he was talking to the policeman .
the policeman asked him how long he thought he would wait on his
he said approximately another twenty or thirty minutes .
so, ironically, a gentleman across the street wearing a coat .
and with the collar pulled up around his ears .
and they said they would go to another store to &-um sit over .
and talk about good times, the old days .
so &-uh at that time they both took an opportunity to look at each
and the man in the doorway realized that it wasn't his friend after
and come to find out his friend was a policeman himself .
and he realized when he lit his cigar while he was standing in the
it was a picture of a wanted man .
and he could not arrest his friend .
so therefore, he sent a plainclothes policeman to do it .
now, the individual's names were Jimmy and +...
oh, I'm sorry I can't remember the other man's name .
and that's the end of the story .
the moral of the story is that even if you make your fortune
you will pay one way or the other .
just so happened that he had to go all the way back to New_York to
and his friend ended up being a policeman .
okay, the experience that sticks with me most is the time that I
and we were riding our bicycles .
I guess I, not guess, I know I was just as rough as the guys were .
and we were coming down the hill .
and at that time everybody was riding without hands on the
I did the same except for my bike ended up hitting a fire hydrant .
and I was out .
when I did wake up I was in the hospital .
and the following years were really tough because I was on my way
and at the time of the accident I lost my front teeth .
so I had to go to junior highschool without teeth in the front of
and children were cruel during that time .
and well they are sometimes today .
<so that's the> and I know who hit my bike .
and I ended up losing the control .
