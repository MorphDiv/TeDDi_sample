&~www .
&-um the boy had the frog .
and he's playing with it .
and then he went to sleep and forgot to put a lid or anything on it
and then in the middle of the night , the frog went out .
and in the morning he got really worried .
he was looking for his frog .
and he was like ignoring his dog like <if it did> <if it>
he's just <ignoring to him> ignoring him .
and he was looking around everywhere for the frog .
and then he looked up on a big rock .
<and saw> and he fell on <a> like a deer .
and then the deer went running and chucked him like in a pond .
and he heard the frog .
and then he saw the frog .
and then it was with like <s(ome) and diff(erent)> another
uhhuh .
and then the frogs gave him like a baby frog to have .
