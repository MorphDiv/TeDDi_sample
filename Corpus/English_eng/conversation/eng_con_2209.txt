And one of my friends is into the Jungian thing .
She says that that comes from having a . 795070_798890
a consuming &=breath . 799210_800710
mother . 800950_801760
mhm . 801500_802420
And I guess she was I don't know .
She looks . 801970_804300
doesn't look . 804430_804870

&=laughs . 805990_806840
&=breath but that this is just, you know, he's fifty six years old
So &=breath . 810740_811890
all at once . 812200_813490
in the last day or two . 813630_814950
I've . 815080_815420
jus- I've just sort of realized I'm ready for some stability .
&=breath . 815530_819160
hm . 819550_819710
And I thought oh what a concept .
i- I haven't really . 819560_822490
been in a market for it . 823350_824630
up until now . 824800_825630
&=breath . 825740_826190
um . 826490_827110
and I I wouldn't know . 827270_828350
how to go about getting it either .
It's just that hey I think I'm ready for it, j- jus- . 828600_832450
oh . 832800_833120
m- . 833460_833640
&=laughs . 833530_834180
Interesting &=breath . 834340_835620
&=lipsmack yeah that sort of hit me too when I . 835420_837180
I told you about . 837340_838270
realizing that tutor tutoring is not very stable and I don't enjoy
It's okay but &=breath . 838870_844210
that's why I think I I'm going to go back to school &=breath . 844280_847200
You're ready for stability too ? 846890_848720
&=breath yeah, I mean I want to have . 848610_850360
a profession that I can use . 850470_852700
you know and get a job . 852950_854340
and have a practice and . 854820_856430
that I would enjoy more . 856670_858240
And &-uh . 859110_860040
you know and I think about marrying Eve and &=breath . 860360_862820
if I wanted to I could just be a housewife .
And f- he's going to make a_lot_of money and everything but . 862940_866900
that doesn't make me feel too comfortable &=laughs . 867110_869170
mhm . 869070_869730
You know so &-um . 869320_871240
you know I want to go back to school and know that I can support
&=breath I tell you it's nice though . 873900_875690
to have a man who would allow you that option . 875970_878950
&=lipsmack mhm . 878580_879660
There are men out there who will not . 879550_881400
be happy until you're learning you know you're &=laughs xxx if they
xxx you know what I'm trying to say . 887640_888920
yeah, yeah . 888620_889530
um, yeah .
So I think that's neat .
But yeah I understand what you're saying it's . 889150_893300
yeah . 893450_893910
You need something for yourself . 893820_895060
Right and it's not just a matter of money but having my own life .
too . 898740_899040
yeah . 898820_899450
&=breath . 899500_899850
But &-um one thing I was going to ask you about was . 900000_902160
like you were getting all excited about doing . 902370_904310
financial planning and learning that . 904420_906330
mhm . 905580_905980
Have you thought about going to school and doing that ? 906530_908830
&=breath Well I haven't gotten too far on that, I &-um &=lipsmack
took a little &=breath three session course at the local &=breath
m- adult school on financial planning and e- e- a financial planner
I says how did you get to be that and he says well he took a class .
He says basically he says eh there's a whole outfit in Denver where
But he got a . 932030_932960
an undergraduate degree in finance . 933140_935230
mhm . 935510_936000
And I thought hm . 935860_936940
well that sounds interesting .
I don't know if I want to go that far &=breath . 937070_939930
but . 940230_940760
I'm just pointing in the direction of learning more about money .
And I've got a net worth statement now and it's &=breath . 941950_946910
I'm surp- <I'm just is> . 947020_948120
I'm just surprised to learn that my net worth is increasing every
like there's eight hundred and ten dollars every month . 954280_956870
increased equity in the &=breath +/. 957670_959470
huh . 959240_959580
+, the building . 959630_960580
Wow . 960370_961000
yeah and a few years ago it was only two hundred a month a . 961090_963480
and &=breath . 963610_964250
and there's that .
And then I'm you know saving money through my retirement see I
income at the disposable income much . 968630_971540
now but &=breath . 971670_973280
xxx . 972390_972650
There's &=breath future stuff if thing you know if . 973580_976420
mhm . 976230_976860
so I can . 976800_977250
manage to get the m- equity out of the building without giving it
taxes &=laughs . 981440_982630
yeah . 982380_982910
<that's where> that's going to be a big problem . 982670_984520
&=lipsmack . 984970_985200
So &-um . 985000_985750
&=breath . 985710_986160
&=breath . 986700_987060
I'm just trying to learn about money &=breath . 987370_989600
uhhuh . 989430_989840
And and it's it's not that hard . 989660_991820
&=breath . 991910_992460
I still don't know about . 992560_993520
price expense ratios and st- some of the stuff just doesn't
you should buy bonds when interest rates are . 997760_999810
coming down . 1000280_1001340
But not always and . 1001430_1003190
You know &=laughs I don't know why is that &=breath And e- you know
xxx . 1003730_1003950
+, quite get it .
But . 1008990_1009910
hm . 1009840_1010360
I will .
And you know, &=breath it just just life seems to be all about
Learning computers and riding a bicycle and worrying about money
mhm &=lipsmack hm . 1019770_1021380
So &=breath . 1021380_1022040
um I e- I feel pretty good .
This thing with Jerry m- it was made me upset .
I was I guess mostly I was j- . 1022180_1026970
beating myself up over it .
Well here's another relationship .
&=breath . 1027130_1030120
But you know, I never did take him seriously as a . 1030189_1033270
marriage partner after the first month or two . 1034250_1037050
xxx . 1037060_1037300
And . 1037150_1037839
But . 1038360_1038890
I was comfortable and I enjoyed being with him for the most part .
&=breath . 1038990_1042970
Although the circumstances have changed now .
He just . 1043170_1045740
he's standing on a shrinking iceberg talking about his big plans
He's probably going to end up living with his mother &=breath Like
mhm . 1052650_1053080
&=lipsmack . 1053370_1053680
you know d- raggedy-assed@n and &-um &=breath . 1053570_1055820
&=breath . 1055610_1055910
So does he like you say it's over but does he know that ? 1056030_1058900
&=breath . 1058950_1059600
oh . 1059710_1060690
Have you talked about it or is he like sort of assuming that you're
We can go out you know it was . 1064460_1066010
e- . 1066140_1066580
indefinitely as far as I'm concerned .
But I have no plans to be with him for the future .
I don't have any plans not to be with him either &=breath . 1066960_1073920
But . 1074230_1074750
I don't know if he's going to get bummed out by this &=breath . 1075160_1077760
mhm . 1077730_1078080
Or he s- said the other day in when he was in a kind_of a crappy
&=lipsmack . 1084240_1084400
oh . 1084570_1085140
Well that's a strong statement &=laughs . 1085260_1087050
And if he . 1085280_1085720
if he presses it then I guess I'll have to say it'll be nothing . 1086880_1090470
uh-uh . 1090300_1090680
&=breath . 1090760_1091650
mm . 1092000_1092340
And &=breath I have never been . 1092130_1093980
&=groan . 1094340_1094810
terribly involved in his financial problems &=breath . 1094990_1097820
But . 1098170_1098740
I find I do things that I'm going to try stopping .
Like I &=breath . 1099040_1102440
I'm afraid of being alone . 1102750_1104490
And so I asked him if he wanted to go to this Aid banquet and I I .
told him I'd buy us tickets .
You know now really he ought to buy his own damn tickets . 1108700_1112230
mhm . 1112230_1112660
&=breath . 1112360_1113110
And there's no reason why I should buy it . 1113240_1115880
But I just wanted to make sure he'd go . 1115970_1118090
mhm . 1118120_1118760
So I'm going to stop doing stuff like that .
And if he . 1119080_1121780
doesn't want to go then I'll go with somebody else . 1121940_1124560
&=lipsmack well that's the thing the thing about being alone .
I mean it is hard . 1124540_1128690
It is hard &=breath I've been alone a_lot &=breath . 1128770_1131070
yeah . 1130980_1131860
And I I kept meeting these men that . 1131700_1133420
I mean I was really wanting to meet somebody and &=breath . 1133710_1136220
I kept meeting these men and then . 1136290_1137640
trying them out and then it didn't work out .
You know I'd like hope I'd keep hoping &=breath . 1137720_1142080
And I got pretty good at ending the r- these things after about
mm . 1146000_1146440
+, meeting people just ending them &=breath . 1146860_1149890
And &-uh yes it's it's hard it's hard .
But like I enjoy being alone too though . 1150190_1155200
yeah I guess . 1151660_1152140
yeah well . 1156070_1156970
It got less scary after a while . 1156400_1158050
&=breath . 1158670_1159120
&=lipsmack . 1159290_1159580
yeah well I am going to have to . 1159490_1161210
come to terms with that .
Because I have basically had a man in my life for the past past
I f f- figure that in July nineteen ninety one I was alone for
&=laughs . 1170780_1171520
A- and up till I've always had some man around . 1171170_1173530
mhm . 1173490_1173960
And &=breath . 1174800_1175890
maybe it's time to give that a look &=breath . 1176040_1178470
&=lipsmack, yeah because . 1178260_1179460
I don't know I I . 1179630_1180640
&=breath . 1180750_1181280
I really started to enjoy . 1181450_1183150
not . 1183510_1183840
needing somebody . 1184030_1184940
mhm . 1185220_1185800
And &-uh . 1185900_1186620
I felt really good . 1187530_1188530
Not meeting somebody ? 1189630_1190610
Not needing somebody . 1190630_1191910
Needing somebody .
yeah . 1191700_1193050
yeah . 1192650_1193090
&=breath . 1193130_1193720
And like e- e- I could just turn my attention to other things . 1193990_1196850
w- . 1194100_1194410
Well some of my friends are telling me that I don't need a man .
And I I know that .
But on some level I don't .
yeah . 1196890_1201660
mm yeah it's a real internal thing . 1201450_1203550
yeah &=breath . 1203330_1204510
&=breath . 1203760_1204360
So anyway .
um Jerry is around .
And you know like I'm . 1204660_1208560
I was using my mother's recliner here .
I'm sitting in it right now .
I can't get the damn foot rest . 1208580_1212980
down so I'm probably going to have to call him up to get him to
get it down for me if I don't want to break the damn thing . 1216400_1218800
You know stuff like that it's nice to have a it's nice to have a
&=lipsmack well maybe you could look underneath it and see if you
xxx . 1222670_1222850

hm . 1231000_1231380
yeah, just turn it over &=breath But &-um &=breath . 1231240_1234160
So it sounds like one of the joints is not working . 1234410_1236620
Well I don't know I just moved it out pretty far . 1237020_1239400
