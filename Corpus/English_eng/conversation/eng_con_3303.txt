0 → 0_6075
so grav(ity) → 6075_7084
so when we say gravity's always the same→ 7084_8836
uh → 8836_10380
we ⌈mean → 10380_11129
⌊well we cannot s(ay) 11129_12396
⌊that's a good question ⌈what we mean → 12396_12699
⌊you know I just cleaned up the way I think → 12699_14807
I mean I really thought I had figured this thing out it's→ 14807_17248
I never really figured it out → 17248_18622
it's some unit of mass or something→ 18622_21342
Right it's the same pull → 21342_22238
its gravitational pull- 22238_22447
+, is always the same 22447_23519
mm → 26479_27229
oo: → 27229_27983
So, well cuz→ 27983_29382
Explain that, it makes sense but- 29382_31294
+, so I don't know, I can't figure it out→ 31294_32537
but like if something's heavier→ 32537_34814
there's more mass more units of weight or whatever → 34814_39526
more Ns → 39526_40336
+, more Ns, are they Newtons ? 40336_43062
yeah → 43062_43784
so:: it has to- 43784_46485
there's more of them so it has to pu(ll), 46485_48837
0 51495_52392
is getting pulled→ 52392_52925
there's more gravity acting on it→ 52925_55262
'cuz there it's the same amount per unit → 55262_57629
Uh huh→ 57629_58703
So let's say this is one→ 58703_59957
this is one unit, right, 59957_63072
0 → 65278_66078
+, in weight → 66078_66919
+, in order for this one unit of weight 66919_68750
ok → 71582_72441
of force → 72441_72886
+, right → 72886_73551
+, one pull→ 73551_74685
of gravity → 74685_75487
Gravity exerts that much yeah→ 75487_76607
+, and on this one you're saying it take on the big one→ 76607_78808
+, the cannonball → 78808_79710
it will take a heavy one, it doesn't have to be bigger→ 79710_81784
the one that's ten times this→ 81784_82622
ten times the mass of this → 82622_83965
+, right → 83965_84624
takes ten → 84624_85375
Yeah → 85375_86373
and somehow→ 86373_87573
+, so gravity's always the same cuz that one's ten→ 87573_90133
and this one's one it's it's one to one it's just that this
calls for ten → 93055_93975
yeah it's more → 93975_95032
and the big one gets &~m generates more gravity→ 95032_97615
the Earth cannonball &~gr gravitational attraction 97615_100750
yeah → 103213_104247
little ball→ 104247_104911
right→ 104911_105158
+, gravitational attraction, I mean the force→ 105158_106719
the force- 106719_107279
right→ 107279_108095
+, between the two of them is→ 108095_108590
proportional to the difference in how massive they are → 108590_111283
which is I guess why they always accelerate 111283_113840
⌊at the same rate, yes→ 115096_116055
when you drop them, 116055_116743
⌊so this is the same thing as → 119405_120933
okay, but I'm still stuck 120933_121910
that's why:: they, 127859_129837
⌊right → 144680_145924
I have an idea → 145924_147043
But I don't get it→ 147043_148573
+, you said something there→ 148573_149549
let me see → 149549_150294
I can't explain it→ 150294_151188
+, let me try that→ 151188_151390
you said this ball here let's say you have 151390_153285
right, as you were trying to say Suzanne, ten ball → 154995_156893
ten times → 156893_157860
another ball that's → 157860_158621
mmhmm→ 158621_159283
okay if you see this larger ball as ten small ball like that→ 159283_161765
they're all being pulled next to each other, pssh, boom→ 161765_164973
Hey:: → 164973_166188
That's cool→ 166188_167216
That is so good, that's great→ 167216_169934
like they're connected or something→ 169934_170374
yes, wow→ 170374_171364
But it's- 171364_172270
+, I love it→ 172270_173142
+, but it's small→ 173142_173813
it's the same size → 173813_174853
They're the same same size → 174853_176119
so it gets to be harder to see it, right, 176119_177527
Gravity's looking at 178861_179579
yeah → 180515_181085
so they all fall together → 181085_182235
Mmm: → 182235_182685
But it's looking at each of these ten weights or something, 182685_183686
+, That's probably, that's- 184069_185042
it can't → 185042_185595
that's interesting → 185595_186228
mmm: → 186228_186517
That is great → 186517_187181
well so → 187181_188091
so then so it's just like you have eleven balls 188091_189813
right→ 192646_193188
+, and so why shouldn't they hit at the same time ? 193188_194731
