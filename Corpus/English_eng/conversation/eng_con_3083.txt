who just has his course where . 220_1380
and Alex has not begun at all . 1420_2950
&-um so because but he was at Junior Great Books this morning right
when was he at yesterday . 7360_8340
oh he finally got to sit down at Logo see some of the kids who were
and they knew everyone else had had more computer time . 16580_18780
so yesterday I gave them a big chunk of time to work with Logo like
yes I knew you're working . 22640_23740
I told you you'd get computer time . 23920_25220
so they didn't get to design their two by twos . 25480_27260
and then Alex today &-um and Teddy had something else to pull them
and then we have another visitor . 32600_33660
so it's gonna be to see if we can use today to try to even things
I don't mind if some kids are way ahead . 37380_39550
if I get everybody up and running and started . 40010_42220
I mean it doesn't matter that Sarah's almost ready to design her
and maybe she'll begin with those finished quilts before today is
<I'm not> I'm not sure as long as I get everybody through quilt
and everybody has started their logo quilts then &-um I'll be happy
like if your team we're just gonna be cycling through the computers
and once I know who the teams are I'm gonna take two like two whole
and they can come back and . 76660_77620
be at the same point . 77640_78420
I can do that . 78950_79360
so I can't do . 79750_80110
how does the computer stuff you know compliment or reinforce what
doing I think it's cementing it all together . 84280_86460
I think some of those kids who maybe would've kind of &-uh . 86680_89190
I don't know if you &-um asked (th)em what have you learned about
I think once they sit down there and start generating that and
I think now when I ask them . 104160_105470
what can you do you know what are you able to do . 106390_108710
now with quilts . 108810_109410
what do you know about quilts . 109660_110470
what can you do . 110520_111020
they'll be more confident about what it is . 111230_114380
it happens faster . 114500_115380
and it comes together . 115540_116180
I mean they're able to see that progress so quickly . 116360_118030
it's not three days of cutting and pasting little things . 118190_121470
I mean it's actually those designs happen . 121670_123190
and you can change (th)em and alter (th)em it . 123300_124790
mhm . 124840_124970
you know it's not frustrating to say . 125320_127180
oh that two by two is just like this and only turned the other way
you just light that away and you build again . 133190_135620
&-um so . 136020_136550
is it more helpful for for kids like Brian mhm . 136980_140780
as opposed to Sarah or . 141340_142620
nope . 142950_143140
Sarah's just doing more amazing things . 143280_144830
and she's it's making sense to her . 145020_146470
and she's getting the same amount out_of it . 146700_148180
but it's been especially rewarding to watch Brian sit down . 148260_152300
and &-um Kevin is loving that . 152500_154500
&-um it's easier for them my kids who struggle small motor wise . 154860_158590
Alex and Kevin and Brian and Paul yeah I didn't see Alex he hasn't
but he is gonna beat that up . 163410_164300
and computers are like Alex and and Kevin and a big thing . 164500_168740
and they think that they should just be able to do it all . 169410_171310
and I struggled with that that strip quilt that they made it
I mean they it was I was so impressed . 181440_183500
but Kevin made a two-sided courseware today a complex two-sided
and to do the two-sided strip . 199140_200860
they both started over over five times . 201320_203660
they they struggled with that . 205550_207380
and then I was like . 207500_208030
is this worth it is this . 208140_209260
and the point is yes it is . 209570_210790
they had to get through that process once to know what to do . 210870_213980
because now Kevin knew exactly what to do . 214300_215900
he took that more complex thing . 216220_217620
and no problem made a two-sided four square . 217950_220220
and he knows what he's doing . 221140_222740
and when he sat down at the computer he knew exactly what what
and he's been living for that waiting for that . 226020_227820
and I knew I was holding that back long . 227840_229220
but he's gonna be able to produce just as much as everybody else .
and it's gonna be meaningful for him . 232080_233660
he's gonna know what . 233710_235460
he's doing . 235480_235900
and if I had just opted Alex and Kevin out and let them like do
&-um I think they'd be manipulating a trial . 245380_248580
they do there they'd do it . 248600_249460
but they would know what they were doing . 249660_250900
I think then when it came time to do some assessments like here's a
they'd be like . 257440_257910
oh I don't know . 258019_261350
I I don't think . 261480_262340
and they certainly wouldn't understand the process that was
the process of design of planning and designing and going through
how is a quilt . 272060_272870
built . 272920_273060
well it begins with a courseware . 273080_274950
and that courseware becomes either a strip or a two by two . 275060_278820
and those strips become a quilt . 278840_280820
and there are steps that you go through bright as they both are . 280840_284630
that was a concept that was not there for them . 287380_289170
and now it is I think &-um they could talk intelligently to someone
I think they could guide someone else through the steps and tell
and I think I'm hoping when they talk about their designs that they
uhhuh . 312280_312360
mhm &-um they didn't just happen it wasn't just cool software . 312850_316970
I mean like they might say . 317690_318570
oh that's really cool . 318590_319500
but they'll they'll know what they were what they're doing . 319690_322810
I think it's too easy for . 322990_324320
and I think that's part of why Alex and Kevin are like that they've
they're so bright and . 330260_331020
they pick up new ideas easily . 331070_332020
and I know Alex has done lots on the computer at home and stuff . 332130_334490
and he's done so much that way instead_of having to produce it
and &-um that that was just it was necessary . 339650_343140
and I'm hoping that there they'll be very successful in their
and they'll come without pain that was very painful . 347440_349950
but they were proud . 350540_351190
they were proud . 351770_352070
when that was finally finished they missed the whole Nutcracker
it took them all day . 354900_356070
but they worked back there . 356510_357300
and they talked . 357340_357900
and they didn't just give up . 358050_358900
by the end . 358940_359490
they both knew what they were doing . 359920_361220
and they just and they knew what they had to do to get done . 361780_363820
now they floundered for the first three quarters of that project .
and it was so hard to just walk away or say talk to your partner or
and they did you'll have to make six more . 378940_381180
and they did &-um it was so funny when I was here with them . 381620_386430
and Alex came to me and told me . 386540_388820
I'm sort of having this stress . 389260_390780
he's so funny . 392550_393270
and then you know what just working helps students . 395260_398560
you'll be less stressed if you get anything accomplished . 400260_402840
and that was a good lesson for them . 403380_404830
and they will not be in each other's group &-um for the final time
&-um but but that was good . 410180_411340
they they actually needed someone who would go right at their
but by the end I was kicking myself for a lot forever letting them
but in the long run yes it has paid off . 422540_424550
and now I'm relaxed about that again . 424680_426110
and and they'll get on the computer . 426520_427530
and they'll be fine . 427680_428950
and yeah they understand what they're doing . 429260_431340
so yes that was a challenge . 431380_432860
but it was the kind of challenge they need . 433140_435260
they're my Alex's visual skills are growing . 435350_439380
and his his ability to talk about what it is he is seeing is
that's very hard for him . 447650_449270
very hard . 449950_450430
and that's why he had to make six attempts at that two-sided strip
but he he knows what he's doing now I mean what . 456500_459870
what_about &-um . 460390_461180
yeah I've been noticing . 461610_462350
Atu hasn't been saying much in class recently . 463020_466350
what why do you think that is . 466670_468030
I don't know . 468680_468890
and every time I start to get a little concerned and worried to do
okay . 471520_471740
oh yeah . 471980_472380
and yesterday filled that in perfectly . 472560_473990
and he sent out_of the computer . 474180_475220
no problems . 475540_476190
uhhuh . 476250_476360
and he's just I I don't know . 476840_479900
but he's fooling around less . 479920_481070
at_least he's sitting there . 481120_481990
that's right . 482100_482510
<he's not> he's not missing Sod a bit . 482770_484680
I neither am I in terms of that . 485400_487950
so . 488270_488390
yeah well he's he . 488440_489190
he seems to be being . 489340_490460
I think &-um Sod is not a leader in terms of Ooz task be I mean Otu
and Sod was someone who had been roping him in a lot . 498440_501100
and I think he's feeling I think he's glad that that
and for he can just sit and listen . 505840_507940
I mean he's focusing his attention more . 508240_509790
sometimes he's off . 509840_510510
but he's he's on he knows what to do . 510560_512590
he has not been coming and saying . 512659_513909
yeah . 515070_515220
and I think he but he is kind of in that where some kids get more
and his pace has gone down . 524059_526140
he he's doing what he should be doing . 526220_527950
but you know he needs lots_of like just kind of . 528180_530270
okay . 530670_530940
keep with it not stopping to tell him what to do . 530960_533380
he always knows what to do . 533420_534460
and he's aware of the process we're going through . 534620_536230
but he's kicked it into load gear which is okay though he's doing
and it's there . 541580_542180
and &-um I I don't know . 542420_544580
yeah I mean yesterday I was like there were certain kids . 544700_546660
I was like . 546760_547030
whoa I need to bring you back in and like . 547110_548780
yeah . 549040_549100
no I I've noticed he tends to he seems to do that . 549630_552620
anyway you know kind of hold back . 552900_554180
and then all_of_a_sudden something will come up for me . 554300_556750
I'll talk about it . 556940_557620
mhm . 557940_558150
but &-uh he hasn't been very vocal . 558910_559870
no . 559940_560090
I'm kind of cutting him some slack lately . 560460_562100
because all the other times I do it he he's able to talk about what
and he does . 566040_566310
okay . 566480_566590
now it might take a while . 566640_567470
and
