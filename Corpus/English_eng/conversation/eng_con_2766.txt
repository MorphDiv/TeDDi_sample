this is the Justice Harry <A> Blackmun Supreme Court Oral
my name is Harold Hongju Koh .
I'm a professor at Yale Law School , a former law clerk to Justice
this is session number three which is being held on September
<mister> Justice , let's go back before you were born .
how did your family first get to the United States ?
well that's a broad inquiry of course .
I know more about my mother's family and their arrival than I do
but let me take up my father's first .
they were really old New England Yankee stock , and just within the
I hadn't known she was working on it , which draws a line of
she did the same thing with Vice-President Quayle on a different
so he's traced back to Miles Standish also .
but it brought back the fact that on my first Thanksgiving day in
but I think it's probably a genuine tracing .
my father used to speak of connections in England and Liverpool
but to the extent that I've worked on it , it has always been New
on his side of the family , there is a little French touch in there
I have a feeling they were French Huguenots but I'm not sure about
on my mother's side , her father , whom I well remember of course
he came over here in his teens and was engulfed in the Civil War .
he served in the <one hundred and seventeenth> Illinois
came through it unscathed , and was naturalized in <eighteen
but as I say , I remember him with affection .
what was his name ?
his name was Theodore Louis Reuter , R-E-U-T-E-R , which is a
but he was a good guy , and I liked him a lot .
on my mother's , that is her maternal side , her maiden name was
her father came out of a small Bavarian town named Hasslock near
and then moved east another ten miles or so and built his own mill
and he prospered in a small fashion .
but he to me was Vater , we called him Vater .
and every Sunday we kids had to go down , pay our respects to him
in exchange for what ?
just as a gift ?
just as a gift , Sunday morning .
but he had a large family and I well remember them , I think there
they were all living when I was a kid and I knew them very well .
and as they grew up and married , he built houses for them on a
so there were I think six houses , four on one side of the street ,
it was a substantial family at the time .
if I could go back to the Blackmuns .
have you ever traced the spelling of the name “Blackmun” ?
it seems quite unique .
yes , and as it goes back , it varies from generation to generation
my father always said the correct spelling was M-U-N and that this
I don't know how true that is , I never checked it out .
but his father , when he enlisted in the Civil War as a youngster ,
and to this day the Civil War records record him as Andrew Perkins
but every now and then it would shift .
there were attempts to move it back to M-U-N .
it isn't very significant , but there it is .
the sword that used to hang on your wall at the Supreme Court ,
well , that sword was my father's .
he was in the Minnesota National Guard for over <twenty-five>
but with it , in the same frame , is a silver handled cane which
it was given to him I think by his children on his <seventy-fifth>
so I'm glad to have it .
how did the Blackmuns get to the Midwest ?
well , my grandparents on the Blackmun side were married in the
and after the war , I think they just decided , as so many other
and they moved out from New York state into , oh , mid-central
they had a farm out there , my grandfather did , and did pretty
they had a large family , I think nine , but they lost four
that was too much for my grandfather , and I think he just
the loss of four children at one time was pretty severe .
of course in those days they didn't have any antibiotics or
but the thought today of losing four youngsters is pretty
and his name was ?
his name was Andrew Perkins Blackmun .
how then did your parents meet one another ?
well , they both , one from Illinois , one from Minnesota ,
it no longer exists but there are still signs .
I've driven over there a few times and there are signs that +"/.
+" these buildings once belonged to Central Wesleyan College .
and .
that's where mother and dad met .
and I guess that was it .
do you have any idea what they studied or what their majors were ?
well , my father studied philosophy , always wanted me to be a
mother studied music .
she was pretty good on the piano , but she had an immediate older
the two of them were due to take an Australian tour in <nineteen oh
this is a loss my mother never got over and I'm named after him ,
and my inability to do very much at the piano , I think , was
because he evidently was very good , he composed and played just as
+, did you get your musical training early as a boy ?
no , I didn't have much musical training .
mother insisted on my taking piano lessons .
I labored through it , but I like music a little bit .
and how many children did your parents have ?
they had three .
I was the oldest and then three years later came a little boy who
and then I had a sister .
what was he named ?
his name was Corwin Manning Blackmun , <Junior> They named
and then my sister came along , born in <nineteen seventeen>
and her name was ?
+, her first name was Theo , named after my mother who , in turn
it's rather an unusual contraction , I suppose , but , strangely
what was their religious background ?
well , they were , as far as I knew , they were German Methodists .
which strikes me as a little strange because Bavaria , from where
and beyond that I don't know , but they were active in the
they weren't overly strict .
mother was fairly strict in the sense that she didn't sew on
but as far as the kids were concerned , we could go out and play
we weren't restricted to the house to read the Bible or anything
but then you were actually born in Nashville , Illinois .
I was born in Nashville , Illinois .
how did that come about ?
which is mother's home .
well , Nashville is the county seat of a county called Washington
the Louisville and Nashville Railroad has a line through it running
but this was a place where Vater built his mill and I think I was
mother and Dad I'm sure were living in a cold water flat in
I have the old address on LaSalle Street .
but my father was a fruit buyer at the time .
he spent a lot of time traveling in the West in Washington , Oregon
decided she wasn't going to have me alone in Minneapolis .
so she went back to +/.
her home in Nashville and I was born there .
happened to be I was born in the same room in the same house in
and that house is still standing .
I can remember some happy summer days down there , and it seemed
but I look at it now , it isn't very large at all .
but that's how it came about and I'm sure that +...
but , did you live down there after you were born ?
your mother returned ?
+, well , I think that as soon as Mother was able to ; in those
I'm sure she came right back to Minneapolis .
and then Mother and Dad moved to <Saint> Paul and I grew up
now you've described your neighborhood growing up as kind of a
what neighborhood was it ?
this was the east side of <Saint> Paul , the farthest , the
it was distinctly lower middle class , I would say , occupied
it was a good place to grow up actually .
there were +/.
four of us about my age that became good friends .
one who was the oldest of the four of us always wanted to be a
he knew it from the time he was born apparently , and he realized
what was his name ?
his name was Briggs , John Francis Briggs .
I can remember his Irish mother saying , +"/.
+" john , you really don't want to go to college and waste all that
+" just go out and get a job .
but he held on and I think his interest in medicine influenced me
a second one was a fellow named Robert Damkroger who later got into
and the third one was none other than Warren Earl Burger .
when did you first meet him ?
do you remember ?
well , I suspect that about age five or six we were packed off to
but that friendship endured for a long time .
we went to the same elementary school .
that's Van Buren ?
yes , it was called Van Buren .
I had to find out who Mister Van Buren was , I discovered
it was a good elementary school .
but when we came to embark on high school years our paths diverged
that year for the first time the <Saint> Paul system put in
I wanted to go to a downtown school that I liked where John Briggs
but Warren Burger went on to a high school that was on the east
your high school was Mechanic Arts ?
mechanic Arts .
it was originally kind of a trade school .
it taught people in the trades and then they enlarged into a full
did you live near Warren Burger ?
well , yes , we were about six blocks apart I would say , and
and the other one , Bob , was closer to where Warren lived .
he lived in a little modest house on Conroy Street in <Saint>
his mother in my estimation was a saint ; she brought up a large
we didn't have much , but the Burgers had less than we did .
but it didn't seem to bother us .
we had a good time , I think , a happy childhood .
what kinds of things did you do for fun together ?
oh , sports .
softball primarily , but then we developed into tennis and played a
warren Burger was always a little stronger than the rest of us ,
what was he like as a boy ?
oh , much the way he is as a man actually , He liked to dominate
but he was a good Pal , a good companion in every way .
no question about this .
but when you went to different high schools , did you see each
well , less than we had before , of course .
and then when the college years came on why I went east to school
but then you were , later , best man at his wedding , is that right
I was indeed , yes .
and were you friendly with his wife at that point ?
well , I had met her through him .
they were married in <nineteen thirty-three> , right in
and I well remember when they went off in a little car that he had
now when did he move to Washington ?
he came down here in the Eisenhower administration .
warren had always been active in politics in the sense of being
he never himself ran for office .
I think he was , people were tried to persuade him to do so
but he was influential , was a good friend of Harold Stassen and
and I think in , when was it Eisenhower was first elected ,
and they had battled the Eisenhower forces however , but as is
do you know if Chief Justice Burger actually suggested your name to
well he always intimates he did .
I have no way of knowing that but he wasn't the only one .
it was funny , when I was nominated on the Court of Appeals , oh
the pattern repeated itself in <nineteen seventy> .
Mister Justice , going back to your early childhood ,
well , of course , she was my little sister and I was charged with
we got along well , I think , and she did well in her endeavors .
she wrote a good bit of poetry .
and I lost her a year-and-a-half ago and I was sad about that .
what had she gone on to do after she left home ?
well , she married and continued in her , I think , literary career
what was her married name ?
gilchrist .
g-i-l-c-h-r-i-s-t .
her husband died before she did .
did she go on to college ?
yes , she's a graduate of the University of Minnesota .
did she have children as well ?
she had two .
one son , Peter <Michael> , who lives now in Boothbay
he was in the computer business and got fed up with it and went
I think he has two or three of them up there now .
I've never visited there , but I'll have to do it sometime .
and he has a couple of children , one of whom is about to graduate
what do you remember about World War I ?
well , I can certainly remember a number of things about it .
I remember that everybody in those days had somewhere in his home a
and nearly everybody had pins that would show the front , and if
it was a difficult , hard time .
the other day I mentioned April <sixth> as being a
well , April <sixth> was when Congress declared war on
do you remember when you first heard about that ?
or what you were doing ?
+, no , I don't really .
I was eight years old .
I remember the service flags that people had in their windows with
and some of them had several stars .
gold stars were not uncommon either .
and then I well remember Armistice Day in <nineteen eighteen>
there was a lot of racket in the sense that planes were flying
I wanted to go downtown during the celebration but my father
and he was probably right , it was probably a pretty heavy
but that was the +"/.
+" war to Make the World Safe for Democracy .
and I think I can remember the <nineteen sixteen> campaign
of course , it wasn't very long after he was inaugurated the second
of course what brought it about , I suppose , at least people use
there was a lot of impatience with German people in the Twin Cities
I can remember crowds outside a German turnverein that people
everybody with German parentage was suspect at that time .
but that's typical of every war .
the same thing in World War U with the Japanese citizens of this
yes , the War to Make the World Safe for Democracy .
<mister> Justice , you are famous for your work habits .
did you inherit them or did you learn them from your parents :
oh , I don't know , maybe I was very frightened or scared if I
but I like to get up early because I felt I did better work in the
this was certainly true when I was in college majoring in
I could think better mathematically in the morning than I could at
then I worked outside a lot and there weren't many hours in the day
how long did your father continue the job as a fruit buyer or did
oh , it wasn't very long , I suppose , after I came along when his
my father never was , I don't mean to speak ill of him at all , but
he either wasn't interested in it or , in part it was because he
did you have to go out and make money yourself ?
yes .
when did you start ?
well , after I got back from college of course .
right after the Depression , I had to help out .
but I can remember periods even before then when financially things
I can remember sitting in the kitchen of my mother with tears
but we got through that period all right .
you often write in your opinions about “the little people” and “the
how do you think you developed that kind of affinity ?
+" was it through this early period ?
well , I suppose growing up as I did there on the east side of
they lived on the other side of town .
and naturally I probably had empathy for them .
it caused me to rethink some things when I got into practice , of
who do you think were some of your heroes growing up ?
you've described a “hero” as sort of a “beacon” for a person .
well , unquestionably Abe Lincoln always was a hero to me .
I probably got a good bit of that from my two grandfathers , both
they were , both of them were , distinctly liberal Republicans in
the family was always Republican ?
well , not every member of it , but it was on the liberal side
do you still consider yourself a Republican now ?
well , I don't know .
I certainly don't vote a straight ticket anywhere .
no , I , suppose well , it kind of depends .
look what's happened in Minnesota in the last week .
of course Minnesota always , when it's gone Republican , has , in
I think one has to go back to Governor Theodore Christianson years
Minnesota was caught between Wisconsin progressivism on the one
so it isn't unusual to have Minnesota politics as fairly liberal .
you're contrasting this to the reelection of Arne Carlson this week
I'm just +/.
trying to recall for the record what happened in Minnesota this
well , he won the primary even though he wasn't nominated by his
he's backed into everything since he's been first elected Governor
<mister> Justice , what kinds of things did your parents
did they like politics or music or what kinds of things happened
<h_a_b> ; Well , my father was always interested in
mother liked movies , She loved to read .
dad liked public speaking , was pretty good at it .
in what capacity ?
was he a member of civic organizations ?
what ?
in what capacity would he give the public speeches ?
well , often church-related capacity , one way or another , but not
he was a pretty good student .
he taught an adult class in our church and did very well .
he was very popular , had a large class .
that kind of thing he did excel in .
when did your dad pass away ?
he died in <nineteen forty-seven> , in February .
so that was after you were back and already practicing .
yes .
I was practicing in Minneapolis at the time .
came about in a way rather suddenly and yet he had been ill for a
yes , I remember that very distinctly .
how did he die ?
he started bleeding internally and was taken to the hospital and
now did he have any you said he wanted you to be a lawyer , a
is that what you wanted as a boy , in terms of your ultimate
well , I was just a kid , and he kept grinding at me .
he definitely wanted to be a lawyer .
I have today in my shelves some of his law books , including his
I think he would have been a pretty good lawyer , generally .
he was a scrapper , Dad was , but he was never a compromiser , that
but he wasn't insistent .
in those days , people always said well , if you don't know what
but I drifted along for a while , and I was torn between medicine
but I was always a little concerned about whether I could do very
was that your best subject as a student ?
yes .
I well remember when I was a freshman in college , they gathered us
he said it doesn't make much difference what it is as long as it's
for instance he said , +"/.
+" I went on to law school but I majored in mathematics .
I thought if that was good enough for Abbott Lawrence Lowell , it
some commentators have ascribed your well-known qualities of
do you think that's true ?
is there's anything to that ?
oh , it may have an influence , I suppose .
I like to think I pay attention to detail .
I think that's important .
and is that something you learned from your parents or was that
<h_a_b> : I think it was my own doing , studying math more
<h_k> : What do you remember about the Depression years ?
they were pretty tough years .
I remember particularly Black Friday in <nineteen twenty-nine>
I was in my first year in law school and was walking across Harvard
I said to myself , well , it can't hurt me .
because I was broke , I didn't have any money .
and how wrong I was .
but I remember that very distinctly .
then of course , as the days went on , the following Tuesday was
those were desperate days in <thirty-two> , <thirty-three>
but the world was collapsing .
people thought the world , not just this country , but it was
going back to your grade school days , do you remember the first
no , I don't .
do you remember the first time you heard about the Supreme Court or
boy ?
well , I studied Civics , I had a pretty good Civics teacher .
I guess this was in the high school level .
that was a tribunal that stood at the top of the judicial system
I didn't have any close connection to the judiciary , I didn't know
fortunately I stayed out of trouble and wasn't up before them .
did you know any lawyers ?
not until I was about to go off to college .
oh , I'd met a couple , but I didn't know them really .
I know you're modest , but were you a top student in high school ?
in high school ?
well , close but not valedictorian or anything of that kind .
we had a class of about four hundred and fifty , and it was a good
there were about ten of us clustered right at the top , oh , tenths
there was a little fellow who was valedictorian and then a pair of
it was a lot of fun , a good competition and the like .
did you ever keep track of those people , do you know what happened
I think they're all gone now .
I heard from them for a while , maybe six or eight years .
but it was a good class .
for me it was a splendid high school to go to because it was
so we had a very diverse student population which was very good for
did you have a sense of the life of the African-American community
to a degree , yes , a little bit .
I had a couple of pretty close friends .
we discussed their problems and I discussed mine .
none of us had any money +/.
0 &=laughter .
, it was common in that respect , had to work outside a little bit
how conscious were you of segregation in the South at that point
oh , not very conscious I think , living up north .
on the other hand , the banners of the War between the States were
it was only fifty , sixty years after the Civil War and certainly
it was rather impressive for the kids .
were there any special teachers who really stuck in your mind ?
well , I remember the ones in elementary school .
they were without exception very kind , very understanding , more
but at the high school level , yes , there were several that were
two English teachers whom I really didn't have much in class , one
and Miss Deem and Miss Copley were the ones who suggested that I
had you ever known anyone who had gone to Harvard ?
there was a fellow from our high school who had gone out the year
I remember the principal who later became a good friend of mine ,
he did to me what he shouldn't have done , he said , +"/.
+" <harry> , you're probably going to Harvard
+" if you flunk out , we'll never get another student into Harvard
and I thought , in later years , what a thing to tell me .
it just added to the burden of going east in a new culture and all
but he was so desperate about it and as I say , we became good
did you apply to other colleges ?
well , I had applied and been admitted to the University of
it was rather a surprise .
I was working that summer as I had the summer before on a dude
how I got that job is a long story , but anyway +...
is it worth telling ?
+, no , not really .
was it through a family friend ?
yes .
I ran the ranch store .
the dude ranch was <thirty-five> miles from the nearest town
this was fun , I opened up at seven in the morning and then closed
I show some photographs to my current law clerks all the time .
they're amazed to see me on a horse and chaps and all the rest .
but those two teachers particularly put me in touch with the
I well remember them .
one was from Minneapolis , his name was Carl De Laittre , who's son
and then Bergman Richards who was a warm , successful lawyer over
and <W_W> Cutler of <Saint> Paul who was kind of
then a little fellow named <E_B> Young , who was just
I remember walking into his office and he said , +"/.
+" so you want 'to go to Harvard ?
I said , +"/.
+" who said that ?
+" I don't know anything about Harvard .
+" I was just told to come and see you .
what was the tuition at Harvard ?
tuition at that time was three hundred dollars .
and so the scholarship was for the full amount ?
no , the scholarship that was finally offered , it was three
but I was working on the dude ranch out in Wyoming and a telegram
I didn't know what to do .
I didn't have any money except what I was earning .
tuition was fine , but I knew I had to eat and do some other things
among the dudes out there was a family named .
Garfield and Mister Garfield was the son of the
but his wife , <Mrs> Garfield , was kind of a friend to me
she , I guess , was kind of interested a little bit , and when she
well , I said , +"/.
+" but you're not Harvard , the Garfields are Yale from start to
and she said , +"/.
+" oh , yes , yes , but you must go to Harvard .
she kept , almost nagging me , for a while .
I think she influenced me in my decision .
when that telegram came in , I thought I'd better get back , so I
I remember talking to my father one day , he was shaving , and I
+" aren't you pleased that the scholarship has come along ?
he said , +"/.
+" yes , I'm pleased but that doesn't answer everything .
and I know he was worried about how to get me through , what his
but I finally determined more or less on my own that I'd go and did
we went out by train at that time .
well , we're coming to the end of the tape so maybe we can pick u
