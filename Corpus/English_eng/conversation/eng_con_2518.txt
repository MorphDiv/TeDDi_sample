thank you . 5930_6190
yeah . 8900_9100
perfect . 9120_9280
is there any &-uh way that &-uh freely or otherwise I mean that way
I don't know . 34080_34300
no I don't think there is . 34660_36010
anyway . 36080_36350
I think you got so remote as_to be almost beyond possibility . 38120_43300
it'll be rough as a we see . 44600_46030
and if you did there's well we've got it know we'll have some
isn't it . 52840_53150
&-uh yeah sure is that's what right thought that on the desk when
well that would be very hard if he did it . 65710_69740
then we'd say . 70310_70740
yes possible not virtually impossible . 70760_73580
if he did it we'd say . 73780_74630
yes sir . 74680_74920
that was a recording . 75200_76020
and I was investigating . 76120_76950
that's right on the other hand . 77160_78670
it'd be god damn hard . 79470_80740
I mean you run that in the press . 80840_82020
that'd be pretty well <no way to> no way to find out is sir . 82140_86300
no there isn't any . 86620_87620
there isn't any no way anybody would know . 87640_90340
we have no him no record of &-uh we don't have any around as_to
have we none there's been no evidence at any time under any
and I've you know been involved in enough you know where he is
<I I> I just find it impossible to think that that there
mhm . 115950_116180
one thing about those those things that's I think that you know
I mean I didn't look at (th)em that closely . 123480_124820
but you were there but god damn . 124980_127100
I mean <I I> I think that it's a little even the smallest ones
you know where they carry . 140560_141380
a pistol holster or something . 141560_142900
I mean . 143710_143860
mhm . 143880_144150
yeah . 144800_144860
well just I really don't think it's it's so remote is to be
it doesn't matter nothing as we're beyond the realm . 155450_157060
oh that's true . 157500_158140
but &-uh yeah . 158420_159390
and and but of_course he &-uh draws a sword on that . 160020_163580
it's &-uh &-uh I think if if that's the subject he has in mind
oh yes you know his own record afterwards . 171550_173300
that's right . 173500_174020
oh well on that we'll destroy him . 174360_176060
and &-uh he use his word against you know from the basis his word
well you were there but particularly the presidents on that is
I don't think you're gonna have the have a problem with that . 201360_205420
I mean other_than other_than perhaps an effort to to base
and you know his memorandum afterwards or if he's done something
but he didn't usually do that . 216780_218740
mhm . 220820_220950
he didn't write conversations around . 222310_223700
not usually on this one . 223980_228140
like I said it sounds if he had notes which you you said you
yeah that but I mean he didn't make any notes and any conversation
he always sat there . 241960_242820
and and then probably as a I mean with a good memory you can go
you remember . 247960_248310
but &-uh he so always sort of made a memorandum of the conversation
afterwards and I said this and that on the other hand Ziglar had a
and he said . 258700_259140
John Fee's credibility is nil because right the Dean report is
and you're simply say . 267500_268370
and that's what we've gotta have in mind here now without you and
that's right . 284540_285030
he's who the hell is to believe what what he's gonna say now .
and he's saying it now for what purpose . 288700_290460
he's he's gonna be of_course &-uh saying . 290670_292890
well I they're making me the scapegoat and all the rest . 293400_296070
and therefore I'm gonna tell all . 296260_297710
and he's gonna as he says I'll try this . 297910_301390
his attorney says this administration right up to the president . 301740_304540
he doesn't say the president but you know that's what they said . 304580_306640
yeah but that's all for purpose . 307990_310830
when you get down to trying to do it they they've got a very tough
the purpose of_course is to get immunity . 314700_317450
which now the prosecutor Bob is not about to give him . 317860_321000
really . 321430_321550
no sir they're not no Peterson says that I said . 322810_327100
now you make your judgment on your own . 327720_329340
I said not on my base . 329520_330460
he said . 330480_330780
no . 330840_330960
he says he's just much involved as a principal . 331060_333700
he just can't do it . 334170_334950
and frankly I think it's just as well . 335930_337380
he's right I think if you if I think you're in a position now that
that's right hanging it over you . 345980_347450
and the point is that &-uh now if he's gonna have this pissing
and &-uh it'll be a bloody goddamn thing . 354790_356710
but you know strange kind of a way that's life isn't it . 357340_361250
public will be understood . 363100_363990
and it'll be rough as a cop . 364100_365260
and we'll survive . 366410_367100
and and some people some you'll even find in Mississippi you'll
no we do still have some support in the country . 378540_380830
I hope . 381080_381270
but &-uh we shall see . 381380_382590
you agree . 383070_383380
absolutely no question . 383880_385450
yeah yeah that's right despite all the polls and all the rest
and from what I've seen or you know <they they> they wanna
well sure what you would do . 400960_403470
right . 405910_406020
anyway I thought it was just a thought that maybe you check that
but there's no way you can check it itself . 412840_414020
there isn't anything to check . 414090_414900
you've never heard that &-uh that he's ever done that before . 415060_417700
never never . 417890_420020
mhm . 420490_420700
although as I say it's worse comes to worse . 422330_423900
and he has one . 424360_425020
well we've got one . 425360_426020
yep no . 426470_426800
but what I mean is gotta live with it . 426920_429020
that's it . 429290_429750
well you know what's there at_least isn't that's right . 429800_431720
that's right . 432140_432470
that's right tomorrow there's the there's a little left on what one
yeah . 441040_441300
mhm but you were there during that discussion I suppose that we
we get the one twenty right . 448770_450510
I don't remember it . 451440_451960
I don't think so . 452720_453230
I think it was you know just sort of a . 453360_454980
rehash of the other thing . 455440_456110
basically going into the impossibility of doing it . 456330_458590
and the next day you I suppose the question is well . 459730_462420
did you get put to one twenty . 462440_463550
I may have asked him that . 463760_464500
I don't know . 464620_465030
I don't think I did . 467170_467750
but I I'm not even sure there was a second . 467970_470350
well anyway let listen to it tomorrow . 471710_473500
lemme know . 473520_473830
will you . 473880_474060
yep
