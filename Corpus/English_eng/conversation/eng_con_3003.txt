ten sure &=writes . 0_4694
Firstname „ thank_you maam . 4694_6368
Firstname „ do you have your homework for today ? 6368_9543
alright ‡ here's the +... 9543_15814
and how (a)bout yours ? 15814_19310
sorry &=paper:falls . 19310_23911
I really do hate it when I figure out something and then I forget it the next day . 23911_27510
well ‡ I think you remembered it just fine . 27510_30375
see (be)cause look I had it all written down here &=shows:paper yesterday when we were doing that . 30375_34463
+< good . 33563_34145
+< no that's great . 34145_35433
<and then> and then I didn't get a chance to xxx because the bell rang and +... 35433_40101
how many feet are in a mile ? 40101_42143
five no +... 42143_45647
how many feet are in a mile ? 45647_47023
five thousand two hundred and eighty . 47023_48679
no ‡ two thousand +//. 48679_50107
no ‡ it's five . 50107_50922
five thousand „ okay . 50922_51638
I looked it up . 51638_54256
&-um we got that . 54256_56959
that is that +//? 56959_58119
+< can I see your homework ? 57718_58816
is that an answer right there ? 58816_60000
well ‡ you could probably make that look a_little nicer „ huh ? 60000_62671
but I mean is that the answer ? 62671_64066
is that the answer ? 64066_65425
I get sixteen plus or minus +... 65425_67270
well +... 67270_69078
I don't know . 69078_69398
it depends on what that square root's gonna come out as . 69398_71330
eighty three point five . 71330_73195
oh ‡ that's no good . 73195_74100
it's not an irrational number . 74100_75668
aw &=sighs . 75668_77918
can I see what you guys did ? 77918_79543
can you guys explain it to me ? 79543_84295
where'd the sixteen come from ? 84295_88287
(be)cause &-uh +... 88287_91025
yeah ‡ I think that's where we messed up (be)cause I I was thinking +... 91025_97076
oh ‡ (be)cause I was thinking negative two divided by negative two . 97076_100799
thirty two divided by negative two would be xxx . 100799_102967
okay ‡ you might not wanna be copying this xxx . 102967_105727
&=laughs so this is &=points +... 105727_107491
so ‡ you set these equal „ huh ? 107491_109842
yeah ‡ so ‡ it has to be thirty two . 109842_111399
oh ‡ that's xxx . 111399_112715
I'm confused . 112715_113603
what do you mean thirty two ? 113603_115081
right there . 115081_116103
we divided both equations by negative two . 116103_118782
yeah ‡ <I guess> I think we thought +//. 118782_121913
I would multiply both sides just by two . 121913_123807
if you multiply this by two and multiply this by two this cancels this out . 123807_129694
this cancels this out . 129694_133734
alright ? 133734_134814
yeah . 134814_136362
so ‡ then you get seventy two minus y@l minus forty minus x@l . 136362_142533
and then you can &+subt +/. 142533_143904
oh ‡ and then you can find x@l and y@l . 143904_148894
okay . 148894_151032
well ‡ you can find one of them . 151032_152098
and then once you find one of them what are you going to do with it ? 152098_153966
then you can find the other one . 153966_155710
well ‡ how how what do you mean ? 155710_157334
you could &+s add forty to that side . 157334_160172
I mean subtract forty . 160172_161724
subtract forty ? 161724_162500
+< from both sides . 161800_162944
and then that will find you x@l . 162944_165342
and then you could subtract seventy two from the other side to find y@l . 165342_168963
+< this is thirty two minus y@l equals negative x@l . 168002_173097
is that good ? 173097_176557
no . 176557_178222
(be)cause your x@l is negative . 178222_180480
okay . 180480_180756
so ‡ then what do I do Firstname to get rid of this negative x@l ? 180756_186229
&=points make this a positive so thirty two plus y@l ? 186229_189670
&-um or make that a negative . 189670_192414
how do I get rid of the +/? 192414_193509
how do I deal with this negative ? 193509_198222
do I add something ? 198222_199831
do I subtract something ? 199831_200784
do I multiply by something ? 200784_201896
do I divide by something ? 201896_202816
<you multiply> don't you multiply by negative one ? 202816_206014
negative one times a negative would give you a positive „ right ? 206014_208414
so ‡ I do that to both sides . 208414_210148
so ‡ what do I end up getting ? 210148_213478
negative thirty two plus y@l xxx on that side . 213478_217898
and that equals &-uh thirty two . 217898_220973
okay ‡ so then &+wh where do I go from here ? 220973_224461
then you do the same thing but to y@l . 224461_226846
well ‡ I've already mastered this one . 226846_229252
did you guys use <your other equations yet> the other equation yet ? 229252_231910
can't you put that into x@l or ? 231709_235341
back into the same equation ? 235341_236752
no ‡ in the other one . 236752_238043
okay okay . 238043_241278
but wouldn't it be easier though to find out what y@l is ? 241278_244738
and then you would put both of them in together . 244738_250049
but then you're still gonna have an x@l and a y@l in your equation . 250049_252857
yeah ‡ I guess so . 252857_254121
0 . 254121_260092
okay ‡ homework ? 260092_260922
this is it ? 260922_262010
&=checks:homework . 262010_269028
can I see your homework „ Firstname ? 269028_270952
and Firstname ? 270952_271897
&=examines:homework . 271897_275168
this one „ right ? 275168_276884
yes . 276884_278378
&=checks:homework . 278378_320045
can I see yours ? 320045_321417
your homework . 321417_322188
can I see your homework „ Firstname ? 322188_325036
okay . 325036_326497
nice . 326497_327905
you did some thinkin(g) . 327905_330033
0 . 330033_345961
see ‡ the smart people at our table need to share . 345961_348482
+< what's going on ? 347881_348890
we &-um Firstname had it . 348890_350517
and that seemed to help me . 350517_351397
but the thing was he thought this was a minus . 351397_353702
so he wrote &-um minus y@l . 353702_357049
and then I'll say +"/. 357049_357869
+" what do you mean minus ? 357869_358510
+" it's times . 358510_359642
and so ever since then xxx we're not sure . 359642_362044
it's times ? 362044_362840
oh ‡ whoops . 362840_363672
see ? 363672_365384
why is it times „ Firstname ? 365384_367712
because x@l times y@l equals sixteen eighty . 367712_370733
(be)cause the area the length times the width would give you the sixteen eighty „ okay . 370733_374585
<let me> yeah ‡ let me first check this . 374585_377344
and then I'll help you guys with that . 377344_383084
just check your homework before . 383084_384681
and then I'll help you . 384681_385889
no ‡ hmhm . 386889_389761
thank_you . 389761_391449
that's Firstname . 391449_392311
I already gave you ten . 392311_393234
Firstname ‡ ten . 393234_394713
alright ‡ &=gasps Firstname dear . 394713_397424
Firstname , Firstname I said half a page . 397424_403336
woo ! 403336_405017
wow she thought about it . 405017_408393
she did lots of thinking . 408393_410681
okay ‡ so ‡ here we go . 410681_413574
I would have wrote more . 413574_415120
we had a essay report in Miss_Lastname's . 415120_417768
so ‡ you have your two equations here . 417768_422266
what were your guys' idea before when you thought it was subtraction ? 422266_425079
what were you trying to do ? 425079_426265
xxx . 426265_427688
+< subtract y@l so x@l xxx . 426687_430610
wait what balance it out ? 430610_431470
what do you mean ? 431470_431933
well ‡ I erased it . 431933_432972
but I thought I could like somehow xxx . 432972_435197
and then like xxx &-um +... 435197_437836
xxx &=laughs . 437836_439483
okay ‡ that was my previous . 439483_440759
I think I'm fine . 440759_441567
ask him . 441567_442064
really loud &=ges:lower xxx . 442064_444839
yeah ‡ well <try to> <can you> can you tell me what you xxx ? 444839_448123
okay ‡ &-um basically I substituted an n@l for an x@l . 448123_453711
right ? 453711_454646
and so I have the equation . 454646_456374
and then I subtracted the other +//. 456374_458097
+< so ‡ you substitute it in for the x@l . 457900_459637
+< yeah . 459536_459797
from which one ? 459797_460687
what'd you get ? 460687_461692
how'd you substitute in for the x@l ? 461692_463492
it's thirty two minus y@l times y@l xxx . 463292_465601
oh ‡ you mean ? 465601_467007
<you substitute> you said you substitute something in for the x@l ? 467007_470191
into this one or into this one ? 470191_471513
into this x@l or into this x@l . 471513_473239
into this x@l . 473239_474148
so you got x@l by itself over here ? 474148_476183
yeah ? 476183_476673
but I did it with subtractions . 476673_478338
oh ‡ well ‡ <can you get that> can you still use everything ? 478338_481135
+< you could divide the y@l though . 480234_482434
if you divide both sides by y@l ? 482434_484506
would you get the x@l by itself ? 484506_487406
yeah . 487406_487836
yeah . 487836_488492
so ‡ you could still use your method . 488492_490039
go ahead . 490039_490837
that's what I was doing . 490837_491770
okay ‡ nice . 491770_492490
but I erased . 492490_493113
+< do it together now . 493013_493881
mhm . 493881_494309
+< stick together . 494109_494837
be together . 494837_495677
be together . 495677_497004
how'd it go ? 497004_498234
is there <five hundred> five thousand two hundred and eighty feet in a mile ? 498234_501723
+< five thousand two hundred and eighty „ yes . 501323_503068
I was right &=claps ! 503068_506326
then that would be +... 506326_507465
so then you divide one seventy six by five thousand ? 507465_509703
no ‡ one fourth of a mile . 509703_511511
so ‡ divided by four +... 511511_513255
so it's five thousand +//. 513255_514410
five two eight is divided +//. 514410_515848
+< are you guys having fun ? 515248_517367
so ‡ this fun problem ? 517367_520071
one three two oh . 520071_522292
thank_you guys . 522292_523238
+< so ‡ one three two oh divided by one seventy six . 522892_528671
+< and then one seventy six divided by +... 523629_525308
I know you guys are in the zone . 528671_530507
but can I just pause your +..? 530507_531931
