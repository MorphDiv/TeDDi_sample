ken . 0_9090
um, i'll put you in, you can come in .
you in mrs .
campbell's room, class ?
yeah, you can come in, mate .
okay, take a seat guys, remember do not touch any of the equipment that's been set up . 9090_39010
guys, a couple more could probably sit at the front bench, rather than have you all at the back .
and some of you could sit at this front one just in front of the camera, just don't sit on the other si oh, yep they can sit behind . 39010_50940
so you can just, please, that bench guys, go to that bench .
all right ?
it's all right . 50940_72180
just be careful not to knock it .
rickie, come to this side .
sit .
okay, we're just waiting on, I think francine and charles, he didn't know where to come so he'll come in a bit late, that's all right .
okay, today we're looking at energy transfer and energy transformation so we, can you open up your books please, your science books . 72180_79180
put your date, which is the eighteenth of the eighth, and a heading, energy transfers and energy transformations . 79180_91950
eighteen plus eight . 91950_126180
energy transfers and energy transformations .
okay, because currently we've been looking at energy haven't we and types of energy . 126180_130080
stored energy and energy in action . 130080_150080
and we're going to be looking at today how they work together .
did you find him ? 150080_151930
no . 151930_152000
that's all right . 152000_154040
he'll be all right .
he was having trouble with his lockers xxx . 154040_156010
he might be with mrs . 156010_168030
campbell, it's all right .
this, francine you could probably sit between rhea and bob at the moment, or down, um, there .
xxx please ? 168030_170180
I don't think she'll fit in there mate, you'll be all right . 170180_183160
okay, ready ?
good, so let's talk about something .
imagine, in the mornings, it's a bit cold like in the mornings, isn't it ?
and you have a shower, you get out the shower, and you put your foot on the cold bathroom tiles . 183160_194900
what do you notice ?
ground's a bit colder . 194900_196040
xxx . 196040_197120
sorry ? 197120_198190
xxx water mark ? 198190_200910
all right, you leave a water mark . 200910_203000
karla ?
condensation . 203000_204160
condensation . 204160_208160
yeah, what else ?
the first thing you'd notice when you put your foot on that floor ?
cold . 208160_209130
well, hands up . 209130_211060
reflex action . 211060_212070
no . 212070_213060
it's cold . 213060_214010
it's cold, isn't it ? 214010_215030
yeah . 215030_215980
is it ? 215980_216900
yeah, but when you pull it back it's a reflex . 216900_217980
yeah, okay . 217980_227130
thanks .
okay, so, it's cold .
if you lifted your foot up and you felt the tiles, what would you notice about the tiles where your foot was ?
it's made a print upon it . 227130_228910
yeah, what else ? 228910_229990
they've warmed up xxx . 229990_230900
they've warmed up, haven't they ? 230900_234120
where's that warmth come from ?
jack ?
our body temperature . 234120_236050
your body temperature . 236050_244960
from your foot, hasn't it ?
so your foot was warm, you put it onto the cold tiles and the tiles were cold to start with, weren't they ?
and you lift it up, and you touch it, and you get warm tiles, don't you . 244960_254930
so what sort of energy was in your foot to start with ?
heat . 254930_255900
heat energy, and what sort of energy ended up in the tiles ? 255900_260180
on the floor, vanessa ?
heat energy ? 260180_261020
heat energy . 261020_274970
okay so we took heat energy from our foot, and moved it to the tiles in the form of heat energy .
okay ?
that is an example of energy transfer .
okay, heat from our foot moving, as heat to the tiles . 274970_289140
think about playing golf, hitting a golf ball, so you're swinging your golf club, what sort of energy is in that swinging golf club, angela ?
kinetic ? 289140_290100
kinetic, what happens when you hit that golf ball ? 290100_294990
what happens when you, brent ?
ball moves ? 294990_295130
the ball moves, so what sort of energy is moved into that ball ? 295130_298950
kinetic . 298950_300000
kinetic . 300000_314060
so we've gone from kinetic in the golf club, to kinetic in the golf ball .
so once again, that's an energy transfer .
kinetic energy in the golf club to kinetic energy in the golf ball .
for both examples, and we've gone from the heat energy in your foot to heat energy in the tile, and then you've got kinetic energy in the golf club to kinetic energy in the golf ball . 314060_325180
what is the one thing that is the same in each of those examples ? 325180_333010
what's the same aspect, or what's something that you'd notice that stays the same each time ?
takes one to give another energy ? 333010_335020
right, takes one to give another energy . 335020_337990
what about the types of energy ?
they're both the same . 337990_340060
they're both the same, aren't they ? 340060_352940
heat to heat, or, kinetic to kinetic .
so when energy moves from one object to another, and doesn't change it's form, it's an energy transfer .
okay ?
so that's an energy transfer, so let's write down some notes on energy transfer . 352940_372170
okay .
okay .
b: energy transfer: when energy moves from one object to another but does not change form . 372170_401150
okay, so when energy moves from one object to another but does not change form . 401150_415180
come in, charles .
just sit, just for now, bob can you just move those goggles and let charles sit there ?
just sit there, you'll have to grab a chair from somewhere else . 415180_446130
okay .
so some examples, we are going to write them down, um .
so looking at the foot touching the cold bathroom floor .
what energy did we start off with in our foot ? 446130_449000
matt ?
heat . 449000_450010
heat energy . 450010_463180
so we've gone from heat energy in the foot, and it moves to, what sort of energy is it in ?
heat again . 463180_464010
heat again, and where do we find that heat energy now ? 464010_466150
in the tiles . 466150_467090
in the tiles . 467090_497190
so its heat energy, in the tiles, or the floor .
okay ?
another one was the, hitting the golf ball off the golf club .
golf club .
okay what energy did we start with ?
brent ?
kinetic . 497190_498920
then where was it ? 498920_500030
um, it was, went in the golf ball xxx . 500030_501970
where was it first but ? 501970_503140
golf club . 503140_504140
golf club, so we've got kinetic energy, and it's the golf club . 504140_521050
and it goes to kinetic energy where xxx, brent ?
where does it move to ?
ball ? 521050_522010
good, the golf ball . 522010_547980
good .
okay, so those are energy transfers .
now we're going to look at some energy transformations .
instead of foot, can we have body ? 547980_549990
yes, you can have body . 549990_559900
you're planning on lying on the bathroom floor, are you, matt ?
slippery floor . 559900_564040
there'd be a bit of sound energy then too, won't there ? 564040_587910
okay, looking up here guys .
I'm going to light this match, and you're going to tell me about all the energy that you see .
so think about the energy that you're seeing here at the moment, okay ? 587910_599040
and now if I light the match .
tell me in terms of energy what's happened, gilbert ?
um, what do you just want an energy ? 599040_601110
sorry ? 601110_602010
i'll just tell you the energy that you've got . 602010_603910
all right, what energy have I got here ? 603910_605040
um, light and heat . 605040_606960
all right, you've got light and heat . 606960_611130
what energy did I start with ?
angela ?
potential . 611130_612190
what sort of potential but ? 612190_613960
chemical ? 613960_614980
good, chemical energy to start with . 614980_625970
and then we got light and heat didn't we ?
okay, was it pote was it chemical light and heat all to start with ?
or did something happen between the chemical and the light and heat ? 625970_630050
bob ?
the kinetic energy ? 630050_631090
all right, there's a little bit of kinetic, where's the kinetic energy ? 631090_633900
oh, okay, I used kinetic energy to start, start it up . 634970_645110
but, just looking at the match as an isolated object, okay, there would be a bit of kinetic somewhere else .
where do you think the kinetic would be ?
um, the hot air going up . 645110_646940
good, the hot air going up . 646940_656910
so there'd be a little bit of kinetic if you wanted to really look at it you can see the hot air moving up .
so, what happened there ?
when I did that ?
there was a transformation from the chemical energy to light, sound, and heat . 656910_663070
good, okay, so we started with chemical, then that chemical changed to heat, light, and a little bit of kinetic, and maybe even a little bit of sound, because it might be crackling a little bit there mightn't it ? 663070_675060
okay ? 675060_684020
how is that different to, how is that example different to when we're talking about the foot touching the bathroom tiles ?
how is it different ? 684020_685960
nancy ?
um, it started from cold going to hot ? 685960_689110
yes, so or, in terms of this and the foot one ? 689110_695040
what's the one thing that's different ?
xxx energy ? 695040_696080
yeah, the energy, what happened with the energies ? 696080_699090
in this one ?
oh, they changed . 699090_700010
they changed, didn't they . 700010_704930
the energy form changed .
where with the energy up here, did it change form ?
no . 704930_705970
no, it didn't . 705970_720150
so we had an energy change, didn't we, from chemical, to heat and light maybe, and a little bit of kinetic .
let's have a look at another one .
I have a battery .
okay ?
I have a battery . 720150_727160
what sort of energies do you find in a battery at the moment ?
as it is there ?
vanessa ?
chemical ? 727160_728160
chemical . 728160_744070
okay ?
now, let's have a look .
see if I can do this with just a few hands .
let's see what happens when I touch either end .
can you see that ?
yes . 744070_745000
what's happening ? 745000_750900
what, I've started with chemical, what have I ended up with ?
karla ?
light ? 750900_751900
all right, we've got some light, what else've we got ? 751900_753190
electrical . 753190_754180
good, there's electrical, and what else ? 754180_757140
heat . 757140_758010
heat, okay . 758010_766980
we've got light, heat, and electrical .
after the chemical one, which one came next ?
movement, uh, kinetic ? 766980_769180
&~ki, no . 769180_778040
after, we've just said that we've got electrical, heat, and light, as well as the chemical .
after our chemical, what was next ?
um, electric ? 778040_779930
good, electrical . 779930_782950
and then from electrical what did we end up with ?
heat . 782950_784060
light . 784060_785010
good, light and ? 785010_786060
heat . 786060_787010
heat, good, okay . 787010_798940
so we've gone from chemical, to electrical, in the wires, and that produced then, light and heat .
so the chemical changed to electrical, and then the electrical changed to light and heat, didn't it ? 798940_810120
okay ?
is that an energy transfer or an energy transformation ?
transformation . 810120_811170
hands up energy transfer or transformation, bob ? 811170_814000
energy transformation ? 814000_815120
good, why ? 815120_816140
don't know . 816140_817990
who can help him ? 817990_819120
they're not the same energies ? 819120_821030
good, there's not the same energy from beginning to end, is it ? 821030_826900
there's been a energy change somewhere, hasn't there ?
so an energy transformation is when energy changes from one form to another . 826900_856140
and one form of energy can change to several different ones, can't it ?
all right, so let's make a note there .
oops . 856140_860980
energy transformation: when energy changes from one form to another . 860980_873990
so when it changes form, it's an energy transformation . 873990_890900
we'll do some examples, we can do the lighting the match .
lighting the match, what did we start with, what sort of energy ? 890900_892990
bob ?
chemical . 892990_893160
chemical . 893160_908080
is chemical energy a stored energy or an energy in action ?
is it a stored energy or an energy in action ?
stored energy ? 908080_909150
good, it's a stored energy isn't it . 909150_914150
now the chemical energy in the match, what did that become ?
um, light, heat, sound, kinetic . 914150_917080
good, we could get light energy, heat energy, little bit of kinetic if you want to consider the hot air moving up, and a little bit of sound . 917080_944150
we could probably take, put the kinetic off from the heat, because it's from the heat that it causes the movement, doesn't it, but that's all right how it is . 944150_951920
the light, heat, kinetic, and sound . 951920_957070
are they stored, or energy in action ?
&~um . 957070_958030
energy in action . 958030_960180
energy in action, good . 960180_985150
another one was the battery connected to a light bulb .
now, tell me what we started with .
what energy did we start with, matt ?
stored energy . 985150_986100
stored energy, good . 986100_989170
what sort of stored energy but ?
chemical . 989170_990130
chemical, good . 990130_997130
so we started with chemical, what did the chemical change into ?
first up, what did the chemical energy change into ?
electric . 997130_998060
good, it went to electrical, didn't it ? 998060_1005180
so it went from chemical energy to electrical energy .
then what did the electrical energy change to ?
vanessa ?
light and heat ? 1005180_1006060
good, light energy and heat energy . 1006060_1018930
now see these things we've been drawing with the arrows, okay, and this one over here ?
these are called energy chains .
energy chains .
I want you to draw now, for me underneath here, the energy chain to show the energy transformations from the battery being connected to a light bulb . 1018930_1028050
with the battery one, would there also be kinetic, 'cause the electricity is moving ? 1028050_1032150
yeah, but electrical energy is the movement of electrons, so we don't really count it as kinetic . 1032150_1041100
okay, 'cause if there wasn't that movement, there wouldn't be any electricity .
just turn these fans on a bit, guys . 1041100_1051020
okay ?
so come on, write the chain down, let's see if you can get it right .
we've gone from, we've just said it, chemical, then it changed to electrical, then from there it changed to heat and light . 1051020_1058150
do we put energy ? 1058150_1059980
yeah, you have to put energy in, but you've got to have the types of energy . 1059980_1062910
oh . 1062910_1063150
there's all different types, matt . 1063150_1087020
so let's see if you got it right .
we started with chemical, that changed to electrical .
this one's a little different from the one above, isn't it, because now from the electrical there's another change, and it goes to heat, and light . 1087020_1102100
who got it right ? 1102100_1112080
good .
who had coming off here, heat, light .
couple ?
okay .
remember we said it went from chemical, and then to electrical, and from electrical it was heat and light, yes, jeff . 1112080_1117950
I thought that heat and light might have been around the other way . 1117950_1119960
oh yeah, doesn't matter . 1119960_1130990
yep, you could do it the other way, that's fine, okay ?
they can be in a different order .
who got it right now, with that cleared up ?
better, good .
all right, so that's your theory . 1130990_1142150
so you need to know what an energy transfer is and what an energy transformation is .
so that brings us to our activity today .
right ? 1142150_1148980
we've got set up around the room, and most of you are sitting near one, some workstations .
there's nine in total .
and at each workstation, it's either involving an energy transfer, or an energy transformation . 1148980_1155120
so as you're going around, I want you to think about which one's &~be, which one's involved . 1155120_1161190
think to yourself, oh, I wonder if this is an energy transfer, or an energy transformation . 1161190_1166020
now, you're going to be walking around with this worksheet . 1166020_1176130
not making you write it all out by hand today, you can just fill it in .
okay ?
so i'll quickly hand these out, then we'll talk about it a bit more . 1176130_1181120
are these all different experiments ? 1181120_1184110
yep, each, there's nine different ones . 1184110_1189120
each one is a different one .
will we do nine today ? 1189120_1190190
you're going to do all nine today, in your groups, you're going to walk around . 1190190_1223990
and i'll be telling you your groups soon .
there you go .
two, three, four, five .
okay, did you get enough ?
yes . 1223990_1224910
anybody missing one ? 1224910_1225900
no . 1225900_1226970
we got one .
okay, before we start to look at these, we need lab coats, lab aprons . 1226970_1248160
okay ?
so, very quietly, lets start with the back row .
go grab an apron, come back to your desk, put it on .
you know how to put them on ? 1248160_1260930
okay second back row, go .
mindy, can you grab two for sandy and evie so they don't try and squeeze through, or, she's going anyway .
xxx jacket on ? 1260930_1262960
can we, do we xxx . 1262960_1264100
you can leave your jacket uh, I would take it off bec particularly they're very flammable, and you're going to be working with bunsen burners in some places . 1264100_1272080
I'm going to have to play with these fans too, because some of them are going to now have to go off . 1272080_1284090
yep, and that one'll go off, I've just got to work out which one it is . 1284090_1292130
I think there's only two bunsen burners set up . 1292130_1303970
one .
yep that should be all right, that one's going off now and those two're fine where they are .
okay, um, front row, go get your, um, aprons .
I was distracted . 1303970_1321990
once you've got your apron on, sit back down at your desk for now .
charles, there should be, see how you've got the one round your neck ?
yeah . 1321990_1322140
there sh you've got to put a double, just show him bob, you double it up . 1322140_1327940
you haven't, oh, is it not there ?
oh, there it is . 1327940_1328060
oh, there it is . 1328060_1339010
just so it sits up higher on you, there you go, that's better .
don't forget you put the double string over your neck, not a single, or it ends up round your waist .
um . 1339010_1343990
how do you get it into a double, ms . 1343990_1344020
cooper ?
you've got a, oh, yours isn't made into a double . 1344020_1348140
okay, you'll be all right .
how do you make it into a double ? 1348140_1349920
yours isn't made into a double, oh yeah, there you go . 1349920_1354100
head through there if you can .
yep . 1354100_1358020
okay, sitting down when you've got your aprons on . 1358020_1376100
you all right ? 1376100_1386140
okay, so there's nine stations around the room .
now all the equipment is at each station .
and also at the station there's a little description of what you need to do . 1386140_1390900
okay, so you have a quick read of it, then you carry it out, and you observe what's happening, and as you move around, you're going to fill out your worksheet . 1390900_1399090
okay, as it's fresh in your mind . 1399090_1404150
as you notice something you fill it in .
okay ?
at the top you'll notice it says, return all equipment at each station to how you found it . 1404150_1410970
okay, so with the steel wool, you do not leave the steel wool connected to these alligator clips, okay ? 1410970_1420180
you leave it exactly how it is .
there's tongs here that the steel wool is going to be, if you can't touch it . 1420180_1430940
okay and there's plenty of steel wool here .
now very important with this one, don't use a big bulk of steel wool .
it's not going to work very well . 1430940_1442000
just use a little bit .
okay ?
just use a little bit to connect .
what you're gonna do here is you're gonna connect the steel wool to the alligator clips .
the best way to do this, is you just turn, clip it onto one end, and don't worry about clipping the other end, just touch it . 1442000_1454190
okay ?
hold on to the red plastic but, do not hold on to the metal .
hold on to the red plastic and just touch the other end of your steel wool . 1454190_1461060
okay, and you'll, and observe what happens .
so, please make sure all equipment is cleaned up . 1461060_1471950
those who use the test tubes, if you use one test tube, clean it, put it back on the drying rack, upside down to dry .
okay ?
so don't leave your station a mess before you move on . 1471950_1480020
okay, i'll give you your work groups .
please remember your group number, because your group number is also the station you're starting at . 1480020_1493930
okay ?
so group one, is gonna be george, gilbert, and jeff .
so you're group one, so you start at station one, which is just where you are at the moment . 1493930_1505100
group two is gonna be matt, brent smith, and bob .
okay and you're group two so you start at station two . 1505100_1521060
group three is neal, charles, and ken .
okay .
so you're group three, down the front here .
okay, you'll notice one, two, three, four, five , six, seven, eight, nine . 1521060_1532910
that's how it works in a circle .
group four is angela, karla jones, and, na and nancy sommers .
okay, so you're group four . 1532910_1551160
group five is davina, rhea, and dorothy smith .
okay .
group six is francine, and evie, and adam .
i'll put you at that group okay, because I left you off .
so adam . 1551160_1566130
group seven is nancy and rickie .
group eight is nelly and june .
and group nine is sandy, vanessa, and kendra wolfe .
okay, so remember your group numbers .
now, you're gonna do an activity, clean it up, and then when i, when it's time to move on, you're gonna move, in a circular motion . 1566130_1577080
so if you're on group one, you go to station two, and you work around the room like so . 1577080_1582070
so people on station nine will go to station one . 1582070_1591130
okay ?
and we'll work in numerical order .
as best you can .
the solar cells have to go outside with theirs .
go out that door, close the door behind you, please . 1591130_1600030
because if you leave the door open the wind is gonna annoy the bunsen burners .
it's gonna blow them all over the place .
station one you need to get some hot water, so you need to go to the staff room . 1600030_1608180
knock on the door and just ask can you use their hot water .
just put, see your big beaker, so the rest of you need to listen to this . 1608180_1611960
use your big beaker, put a little, you don't need a lot of hot water, just put some hot water in that, carry it back inside here, pour it into your smaller beaker . 1611960_1620000
okay ? 1620000_1626150
now if you use the zip heater in there, be very careful because it's boiling water .
so don't go and touch it with your finger .
when it says feel the water, touch the outside beaker if you have to . 1626150_1634040
don't go sticking your finger in boiling water .
fair enough ?
okay, let's go, so move to your first station, i'll let you know when it's time to move on . 1634040_1647060
yep, if there's goggles you need to wear them .
um, just put it on that front bench if you like there . 1647060_1648950
excuse me, do we have goggles ? 1648950_1650160
um, I've put goggles at each station that you need them and you just leave them there, okay ? 1650160_1658960
so if there's no goggles, you don't need to wear them .
okay ?
year eight, if there's no goggles at the work station, you don't need them . 1658960_1669000
so you need to wear safety glasses if you have them, or the goggles at each station at their position .
and you leave them there as you move on . 1669000_1674100
okay, guys ?
you all right, mate ?
what are we doing ? 1674100_1675160
okay, read the instruction . 1675160_1678000
yeah . 1678000_1678110
hold the magnet still inside the xxx induction, watch the milliamp meter . 1678110_1686170
does anything happen ?
while I'm holding it there ?
no . 1686170_1687930
it's xxx zero .
right, nothing's happening . 1687930_1694050
move the magnet up and down inside the induction coil .
what's happening now ?
it's moving . 1694050_1695100
good, what do you think a milliamp meter is measuring ? 1695100_1701020
um, five . 1701020_1705150
yeah, but what is it ? 1705150_1709170
what sort of thing is it measuring do you think ?
have a guess .
yeah, what sort of energy ?
energy . 1709170_1711930
um, what's the magnet one, um . 1711930_1715970
no, not magnet, we used it for the light bulb earlier . 1715970_1719080
mm, chemical ? 1719080_1720980

oh, yeah . 1723970_1724940
okay . 1724940_1730980
milliamp meter is measuring electrical energy, so what's &~hap, what energy are we starting with ?
um . 1730980_1731920
what energy are we starting with ? 1731920_1733100
kinetic . 1733100_1734080
kinetic, and what energy are we getting ? 1734080_1735990
electrical ? 1735990_1736920
electrical . 1736920_1737920
electrical, there you go . 1737920_1745140
okay ?
so that's what you got to do .
so you find workstation eight, and you answer your questions .
and you could have a go at this if you want yourself .
inside here is a magnet, okay ? 1745140_1747060
yeah . 1748010_1749010

is it not, can I just have a look ? 1758990_1760150
yup . 1760150_1761930
oh, no, that silver bit there ? 1761930_1779990
should be all right .
you just spin, okay ?
put it on the bench, hold it, and then let it go .
okay ?
guys have you lit this bunsen burner yet ?
no . 1779990_1780190
may i ? 1780190_1781100

the very end . 1799010_1802040
put it onto a blue flame .
blue flame . 1802040_1803980
now, listen carefully . 1803980_1812980
see, see this section where they're all twisted, that's what you want to heat with the blue flame .
oh, I see . 1812980_1814010
move over this way a bit more you look like you're scared of it . 1814010_1817920

it moved . 1831070_1833100
you need to, it moved, didn't it ? 1833100_1844070
okay .
milliamp meters measure electricity .
okay, milliamp meters measure electricity, what energy are we supplying here ?
heat . 1844070_1845010
heat, and what are we getting ? 1845010_1860960
what did I just say milliamp meters measure ?
just pull it away .
I just said it .
milliamp meters measure what ?
you're not listening, are you ?
measure's electricity, doesn't it ? 1860960_1862950
so you're supplying heat, and what are you getting ?
yeah, I thought that . 1862950_1867140
electric, electricity . 1867140_1868050
electricity . 1868050_1884950
okay ?
so there you go .
so turn off your bunsen burner now, just place all that down on the bench .
turn off the, no, the gas, adam, gas .
and now fill out station six .
okay ?
you guys all right ? 1884950_1887110
it wasn't too hot, the water, was it ?
no, it was boiling . 1887110_1888930

because that was a pretty white light, wasn't it ?
so there had to be heat involved .
okay, turn off your bunsen burner .
ms . 1930060_1932100
cooper, so we just xxx .
yeah, you just tip it upside down now . 1932100_1933990

so make sure that your station is nice and tidy, and how you found it . 1959930_1968160
and now you move round numerically .
so station nine goes to one, and the rest of you move up by one . 1968160_1972080
okay, there's hot water at the front guys . 1977190_1980040

is it ? 1994120_1996010
can you just run to the staff room and knock on the door and ask them have they got another rubber band . 1996010_2005100
can we borrow a rubber band, please .
all right then . 2005100_2006100
quickly . 2006100_2023090
go .
snapped .
&=laughs okay, guys, you need to light your bunsen burner, don't you ?
do you take this ? 2023090_2024050
and you're going to hold the very end . 2024050_2025920
ms . 2025920_2026950
cooper .
hang on, all right . 2026950_2031050

mm, hm . 2033150_2034980
i know . 2034980_2035010
and what does a milliamp meter register ? 2035010_2037940
what, what number ? 2037940_2038190
what does it measure ? 2038190_2042140
what type of energy does it measure ?
um, electric current ? 2042140_2043910
electrical current, yep . 2043910_2046140
okay ?
do you want to light the bunsen burner ? 2046140_2048070
did they give you one ? 2048070_2050020
yup . 2050020_2051010
good . 2051010_2067040
where is it ?
quick .
oh they've given us a nice big one .
hopefully I can get that through this .
okay, it's gonna be too big .
do you want me to go get a small one ? 2067040_2074940
oh, it's gonna take a while . 2074940_2077150
do you want me to go get a smaller one ? 2077150_2078990
just ask them if they've got any smaller ones . 2078990_2099080
just thinner, just tell them that the thimble's too small to get .
i'll keep trying, it might work .
nancy, what sort of energy do you get from your, um, what's happened there ? 2099080_2106910
what do you think the milliamp meter measures ?
force, kind of thing ? 2106910_2108020
what's what sort of energy do you think it might measure ? 2108020_2111120
well, um, kinetic . 2111120_2113090
kinetic and electric ? 2113090_2114150
electric it is . 2114150_2117950
it's electrical .
so you started with ?
kinetic . 2117950_2118990
and you end up with ? 2118990_2119150
electrical . 2119150_2120130
excellent, well done . 2120130_2132970
smaller one ? 2132970_2134160
they kept xxx . 2134160_2135900
oh no . 2135900_2142090
murphy's law, something always goes wrong, doesn't it .
this is hard to get through .
yeah, because you have to twist it . 2142090_2145120
maybe thread that thing through . 2150130_2153990
would it go through ?
no, a little bit bigger . 2153990_2154080
no, we have see if we had a bit of string it would probably work . 2154080_2157910
yeah, pull it through . 2157910_2161190
you wanna just keep going . 2161190_2167900
I did station nine very well . 2167900_2170070
it just keeps folding up inside . 2170070_2172970
potential, chemical ? 2172970_2174170
ask if they've got string ? 2174170_2175930
do you have a stick ? 2175930_2177120
do you want us to get a stick ? 2177120_2178960
no, it'd have to be really thin . 2178960_2180960
it'd have to be really really thin, it's just, it's just folding up in there . 2180960_2182930
we'll have to give this one a miss .
and straight . 2182930_2189170
do you want us to ask if they've got string ? 2189170_2197090
I just don't think it's going to fit in but . 2197090_2202140
won't work .
it didn't work . 2202140_2206150
no, it won't fit . 2206150_2209110
you've smashed it . 2209110_2211000
guys, be careful . 2211000_2212990
it slipped out of my hand, miss . 2212990_2214090
jeff, nothing should slip out of your hand . 2214090_2219070
you're meant to be using those tongs . 2219070_2220050
there's tongs there, test tube holders . 2220050_2227090
okay, take that next door and ask them if they've got a bit of string they could thread that through .
oh, and take this guys to come here, quick, come here . 2227090_2232160
this is what you do, okay ? 2232160_2238160
when they get that rubber band through, you thread that through and sit it in, so the rubber band goes over there .
yeah . 2238160_2239110
okay, and this goes on the other end, and then the pencil goes in . 2239110_2248060
okay, so just take that and see if they've got a bit of string .
we'll use all them, we'll use our resources .
although that probably wouldn't have gone, still a bit small . 2248060_2256150
never mind .
I'm going to check on this group .
now what's happened, guys ?
is it broken ?
yep . 2256150_2257930
I let it all out .
I let it all out, but .
strange that, isn't it ? 2257930_2260110
right, put it in that .
I didn't do it, miss . 2260110_2261900
I know . 2261900_2268100
all right, would you, clean off that test tube now .
okay .
did you see the reaction, did you see what happened ?
yeah, it frothed . 2268100_2269130
good, all right so just clean out that test tube now, you'll not drop another one . 2269130_2276980
okay you guys are finished ?
yep, we're finished, miss . 2276980_2276990
yep . 2276990_2278140
okay, solar people are in ? 2278140_2290110
okay, guys we're going to move on to the next one .
station nine's out of action at the moment, so, just skip that one .
I've got the girls working on it at the moment .
so go, so station eight will go to station one, and you keep going around that way now . 2290110_2298940
xxx . 2298940_2301940
oh, do we just join up with them ?
no, they'll be, should be finished by now, shouldn't you ? 2301940_2304100
I'm just filling in this xxx . 2304100_2304990
good, you just move on, that's fine . 2304990_2306950
it smells like vinegar in here . 2306950_2308110
is it vinegar ? 2308110_2310050
uh, there's vinegar coming up . 2310050_2312990
okay ?
so you need to use some hot water, I think that's enough hot water there, and off you go, okay ? 2312990_2313050
vinegar . 2313050_2318100
never sit down in a laboratory . 2318100_2321990
so you guys need to move on now and let someone else in . 2321990_2328060
how much bicarb did you gentlemen use ?
I didn't use that much, miss . 2328060_2329950
who did ? 2329950_2330170
what ? 2330170_2332130
that was full . 2332130_2333900
it was like, to there when we came, miss . 2333900_2339990
and we've all done one, and we only used that one .
well, you only do one each . 2339990_2342180
you don't do one each, you do one .
yeah . 2342180_2344170
oh, sorry, miss .
now move on, there's people waiting . 2344170_2361960
okay, guys you only use one test tube, and the rest of you watch .
okay guys you, all right ?
know what you're doing ?
yep . 2361960_2362090
don't wind it up too hard, that's no point . 2362090_2373130
you're going to make it not work very well at all .
you just pull a bit off .
okay, you're gonna connect one of those alligator clips to one end .
you're gonna put it down on the ground . 2373130_2382960
holding it with the red wire, touch it .
okay ?
miss, do you heat the magnesium under a blue flame ? 2382960_2385100
yep, blue flame for heating . 2385100_2387000
ms . 2387000_2388980
cooper, is that enough soda like that .
yeah, you don't need a lot . 2388980_2392090
okay .
miss, is this supposed to be a blue flame, or ? 2392090_2394080
uh, blue flame works yeah . 2394080_2412900
no, no, no, no .
hold it on the very end .
read the instructions, holding the end with the tongs, heat the junction of the two wires .
someone watch this .
if you let that go they said we're dead . 2412900_2416910
okay now, put that bit of metal just through that loop, okay . 2416910_2423080
do you want me to hold that ? 2423080_2426140
yeah, I just don't want to, good . 2426140_2433910
now I need this .
yes, we have . 2433910_2433940
but that's all right, you do this one and then i'll give you some time at the end to um okay, that will have to do .
actually, I'm not very good at things like this .
that'll work .
have we moved on yet ? 2433940_2451980
no, no, I need to tighten this somehow . 2451980_2468140
let's come up here, I know what we can do .
got it ? 2468140_2472190
they said we'd be in trouble if the rubber band comes out . 2472190_2475120
what they have all big troubles, did they ? 2475120_2478040
they had to get a rubber band and then they got string, needles . 2478040_2481160
&=laughs well, let's hope, i'll have to keep an eye on this one and make sure people don't twist it too tight, then won't I . 2481160_2494900
well, that's what happened .
okay, there we go .
so you're going to wind the pencil a little bit, don't have to do much, then you're going to hold it down . 2494900_2509930
then, you have to wind a bit more .
hold it down, then let it go, okay ?
xxx chemical energy ? 2512910_2515940
no, what was supplied it was ? 2515940_2519910
the heat, wasn't it ?
what about chemical ? 2519910_2522130
that's gas, isn't it ?
well, yeah, but we're not worried about that at the moment . 2522130_2529110
just worried about the actual supplier, and then, the energy produced was ?
uh, electricity ? 2529110_2530170
electricity, yeah . 2530170_2540970
exactly .
okay ?
when you're finished you turn that flame off, jeff .
yeah, xxx . 2540970_2542100
you have to do only one piece per group . 2542100_2546190
you don't need to use it all up .
we break broke it into bits . 2546190_2547970
we broke it into bits . 2547970_2555960
move your hand away . 2555960_2565070
okay, guys, you all right ?
good, guys, you finished ?
yep . 2565070_2566150
tidied it up ? 2566150_2572180
good .
that's not too bad .
oh don't, yeah, that's fine .
miss, is that called a milliamp ? 2572180_2575030
milliamp meter . 2575030_2576070
milliamp meter, that's the one xxx . 2576070_2577940
how do you spell that ? 2577940_2583960
okay, guys, should be time to move on . 2583960_2606130
so to your next station .
so guys, you just jump in now and do station one .
and we'll give you some time to catch up, okay ?
we do this one outside ? 2606130_2607960
yep, you take them outside, and you put this in the sun . 2607960_2618990
okay ?
think about what the wire's there to do as well guys, okay ?
that might help you with one of the energy types .
solar, electrical ? 2618990_2624050
quickly guys, holding everybody up again . 2624050_2629170
is that hot or cold ?
yes . 2629170_2630190
warm . 2630190_2631010
out the front there's some hot water . 2631010_2650170
so empty that out .
there's hot water in this tap .
so just turn this one on and use it, okay ?
okay guys, you ready ?
mm hm, just get my glasses . 2650170_2651180
good, you'll need your glasses at this one . 2651180_2673920
good .
need some help ?
i'll turn the gas on for you .
good, now you're going to get a bit of magnesium .
one piece, okay .
holding it with the tongs we're going to heat it . 2673920_2679000
what sort of flame do we need for heating ?
uh, hot . 2679000_2680070
hot, blue, so turn open it up, pick it up with your tongs . 2680070_2696900
so just pick it up in your hand, hold it, put it into the tongs, and now hold it over the flames until it starts to get hot .
now pull it away .
okay ?
you can try one more piece if you like . 2696900_2707140
there should be enough there you can have another go .
okay ?
then you two .
it's burning it, miss . 2707140_2708180
it is, isn't it ? 2708180_2717050
amazing, isn't it ?
guys, be careful, turn it onto a blue flame .
aah, what happened ?
it came undone . 2717050_2720130
I don't know how .
xxx . 2720130_2724020
no, they've pulled it out, somehow . 2724020_2735140
and I've just lost the bit of metal now .
no, it was a bit of metal, snapped again .
guys we're going to leave station nine .
we're gonna just forget about it, okay ?
just xxx . 2735140_2736080
so, just forget about station nine . 2736080_2753060
you guys are twisting it too hard and snapping it .
so, one group's going to be in limbo as we, actually we might join you guys up with june and nelly .
so you guys join up now and work with them and you'll moving round as a group of five from now on . 2753060_2762010
okay ?
and that will work .
so group, station nine is out, guys .
we'll try that another day, we'll do it as a demo . 2762010_2768960
what are we getting ?
nothing . 2768960_2769910
what's happening to this red needle ? 2769910_2771970
xxx . 2771970_2777070
so, it's moving the red needle, isn't it ? 2777070_2783990
okay, pull it away .
oops .
turn the bunsen burner off .
xxx off, bye, bye . 2783990_2787130
what does a milliamp meter measure do you think ? 2787130_2789120
electricity ? 2789120_2790990
electricity, doesn't it ? 2790990_2795070
okay, so we've what sort of heat was being supplied ?
heat . 2795070_2796990
heat, and what en what sort of energy did we get ? 2796990_2800110
what was produced ?
electrical . 2800110_2801140
electrical, there you go . 2801140_2810090
okay .
was this untangled when you guys got here, was it ?
yeah . 2810090_2822960
you did well to be able to put it together to heat . 2822960_2829000
how hot has it got ? 2829000_2830950
not very hot . 2830950_2833070
it's cooled down now .
and how much, how, how, how high, how high has it got so far ? 2833070_2839050
oh, not very high, what'd you get yours up to ? 2839050_2841010
fifteen . 2841010_2842100
fifteen, yeah .
did you ? 2842100_2864180
you must have got it pretty hot, did you ?
pretty red hot ?
well done .
it hasn't been showing much of a reading at all .
what have I done here ?
that's all right .
there we go .
should be all right .
ok, ready to move on ? 2864180_2866070
yes . 2866070_2867010
yeah .
ok, move . 2867010_2874110
no, you don't leave it like this . 2874110_2883020
what have you been told to do ?
tidy up as you go .
don't forget . 2883020_2887110
if there are goggles at your station you must wear them .
we've gotta wear the goggles . 2887110_2890100
yes xxx . 2890100_2891030
i have to go . 2891030_2892010
yes . 2892010_2896970
what stations have you got left to do ? 2896970_2898000
um, we've got two, three, four, five, six . 2898000_2903950
xxx . 2903950_2914180
xxx . 2914180_2930160
where's it going ?
what's that ?
what kind of energy ?
xxx . 2930160_2933150
magnetic ?
i thought it would be chemical .
no, it's not . 2933150_2944090
no, it's not .
wait .
this is a magnet isn't it ?
can I just get in ?
sorry .
if I just set the set the magnet in there . 2944090_2945990
it doesn't move . 2945990_2946900
it doesn't move . 2946900_2947060
xxx does . 2947060_2949020
good . 2949020_2949950
so what what what's the energy ?
xxx . 2949950_2951120
kinetic . 2951120_2951190
kinetic is being supplied, and you're getting xxx . 2951190_2953160
so . 2953160_2955970
electrical .
electrical . 2955970_2957960
good .
so it's got nothing really to do . 2957960_2961960
the main thing is your kinetic .
complete the following . 2961960_2963140
okay . 2963140_2965040
electrical energy xxx . 2965040_2967050
yep, that measures electricity doesn't it ? 2967050_2969970
yep . 2969970_2970010
i don't know . 2970010_2971920
whoops . 2971920_2977060
careful guys .
now blue flame .
oh, that one there's burning . 2977060_2978010
electricity . 2978010_2982000
into kinetic .
oh no sorry . 2982000_2987920
stored as it's not stored as solar .
where what sort of energy is stored in the sun ?
heat and then xxx . 2987920_2988900
no, nuclear isn't it ? 2988900_2995900
and then the nuclear is changed to light, because you've got the sunlight and the light's changed to kinetic .
how do we hold it ? 2995900_3001040
like that ?
where's the twisted end ? 3001040_3010970
there .
okay .
oh yeah mate, you had it right .
I wish I had a pair of scissors or something .
you're going to hold it there, and see that twisted end that's been twisted together . 3010970_3020190
you're going to heat that until it's red hot and why don't you've got to watch that red needle .
okay .
got it ?
yeah . 3020190_3021150
and one of you watch that red needle . 3021150_3023970
ah . 3023970_3031050
ah .
ah .
rickie .
rickie .
heat with a blue flame .
I mean nancy and rickie .
yeah .
that's why it didn't . 3031050_3032090
hold it the second dial thing . 3032090_3033950
right . 3033950_3037060
now, pull it out .
there you go .
oh . 3037060_3038150
okay . 3038150_3038170
right . 3038170_3039170
right . 3039170_3044180
so it's light and if you touch that white light, what do you think it's going to be ?
hot . 3044180_3045100
extremely hot, isn't it ? 3045100_3046940
burning . 3046940_3047900
okay . 3047900_3050190
do you want to try another piece ?
yep . 3050190_3051000
xxx .
put your glasses on xxx . 3051000_3052010
yeah, you should be having goggles are here . 3052010_3054170
they're meant to be worn .
but they're geeky . 3054170_3055010
i was going to give you my glasses . 3055010_3059910
they look really funny . 3059910_3067000
they look like you're going swimming .
so what did you so what happened ? 3067000_3068060
it lit up . 3068060_3071010
lit up . 3071010_3074960
it burned didn't it ?
so what are we supplying to this ?
electricity . 3074960_3075930
electricity . 3075930_3077170
and we get ?
light . 3077170_3078090
heat . 3078090_3079010
heat and light mainly don't we ? 3079010_3080100
yeah, and xxx . 3080100_3081900
and there'd be a bit of sound wouldn't there ? 3081900_3085000
did I put the sound in there ?
no . 3085000_3086010
xxx . 3086010_3090160
which station are you at guys ?
you're not even on the right page .
read your station numbers . 3090160_3091990
I didn't mean that . 3091990_3094040
so what was what form of energy is supplied ? 3094040_3096930
chemical . 3096930_3098040
no . 3098040_3099010
electrical . 3099010_3100010
electrical . 3100010_3104990
it's stored as chemical isn't it but you've supplied it to electrical .
and then what's formed ? 3104990_3117120
heat and light .
if you listen if it was really quiet in here, it should be crackling shouldn't it ?
because you know when those things .
okay ?
good .
okay, are we ready to move on ? 3117120_3118180
yeah . 3118180_3119110
i'll i'll just grab the boys from outside . 3119110_3126190
in you come . 3126190_3129090
ready to move on . 3129090_3131020
okay, guys, move on . 3131020_3135130
xxx heat . 3135130_3139920
don't forget if there's goggles at your workstation, they must be worn . 3139920_3144070
are we allowed to use our own ? 3144070_3145010
you're allowed to use your glasses; yes . 3145010_3150110
you must have eye protection .
okay, guys, i'll come out with you this time . 3150110_3157000
there's some more outside we'll grab them .
just come out, we'll grab them on the way out .
give us your solar things . 3157000_3158920
where are they ?
they're xxxthey're all right there . 3158920_3159010
oh, they're out there . 3159010_3170170
okay .
come out and we'll have a look at it .
they've put them out on the table for you . 3170170_3172980
there's some more on the table girls . 3172980_3186060
just grab some .
oh, they've made it hard to get to them, haven't they ?
okay . 3186060_3193100
there you go .
all right, so what energy are you supplying to one of these ?
light . 3193100_3194070
light energy . 3194070_3196940
where's the light energy coming from ?
sun . 3196940_3197920
how is that energy stored in the sun ? 3197920_3200960
chemical ? 3200960_3201150
not chemical in the sun . 3201150_3203180
um . 3203180_3206980
any ideas ? 3206980_3211990
how is energy stored in the sun ?
in what form ?
not heat . 3211990_3212100
heat . 3212100_3214040
hi sandy . 3215090_3216010
think of your um stored energies . 3216010_3222990
it's not chemical .
think of bombs .
oh . 3222990_3223970
nuclear . 3223970_3224900
nuclear isn't it . 3224900_3234040
so, we're starting with nuclear up there aren't we ?
and that changes to light .
so we're supplying light energy that's stored as nuclear .
and what are these wires carrying do you think ? 3234040_3236050
electrical . 3236050_3237060
so the light energy is being changed to ? 3237060_3239150
electrical . 3239150_3240010
electrical . 3240010_3246070
and then what's the electrical being changed into ?
what's happening to your thing ? 3246070_3248020
it's spinning . 3248020_3249010
it's spinning isn't it . 3249010_3258000
so that's kinetic, it's moving, isn't it ?
okay .
so, if you put that in the shade, nothing happens does it .
okay .
kinetic . 3266990_3267130
kinetic . 3267130_3268060
okay . 3268060_3270130
do you see the pathway ?
cool . 3270130_3285180
okay, then .
we'll take these in .
the boys shouldn't have left them out .
excellent, girls .
if you want to play a bit longer you can . 3285180_3297160
and i'll call you out call you when it's time to come in .
ok ?
miss cooper, is that light heat ? 3297160_3298010
sorry ? 3298010_3299990
is that light, heat ? 3299990_3300020
it is . 3300020_3301070
well it would be wouldn't it . 3301070_3304050
if you touched that, would it be hot do you think ?
yeah . 3304050_3305010
oh yeah . 3305010_3307090
but not stored . 3307090_3308130
but it's not stored in there is it ? 3308130_3313160
what sort of energy do you think is stored in magnesium ?
chemical . 3313160_3314990
what was it ? 3314990_3315040
chemical . 3315040_3316010
chemical . 3316010_3318010
and then that chemical is changed to ?
heat . 3318010_3319190
heat and light isn't it ? 3319190_3333940
okay, how are we going ? 3333940_3335110
ready to move on ?
yeah . 3335110_3336010
yeah . 3336010_3337180
no .
can't get that thing to move, miss . 3338070_3340130
that's because you're not doing it right . 3340130_3342160
well it burns your fingers when you're trying to grab it to hold on to it . 3342160_3343000
it tells you it tells you to put it red hot, and I put it red hot and it burnt the wire pieces . 3343000_3348030
oh did it ? 3348030_3349010
yeah . 3349010_3351060
well that's you've got to twist it together . 3351060_3355000
okay .
now, when you hold it no hold it here, and burn that twisted section . 3355000_3367910
and watch the needle .
now it's moving isn't it .
a little bit, but it is moving isn't it .
it's not red hot yet . 3367910_3371110
it has moved a little bit okay . 3371110_3383000
take it away, jeff, take it out, and that will drop back down to that black line .
okay .
if you get it too hot, it does melt so we can't get it too hot at the moment .
okay .
fair enough ? 3383000_3385940
all right .
that's enough, jeff .
so . 3385940_3396960
turn of the um burner the burner gas .
this is the way you turn it off .
i'll try and twist this a bit more, and then you can move on to your next one . 3396960_3408950
okay, mate .
so, girls, are you ready to move on to this one now ? 3408950_3414930
now where it says holding the ends with the tongs, you're going to hold the end before the twisting like that . 3414930_3421100
okay, and you're going to heat where it's twisted .
we need goggles . 3421100_3422990
yeah . 3422990_3428160
guys, give me those goggles back please, jeff .
thanks guys . 3428160_3431160
okay . 3431160_3438910
so you're going to hold it there and heat it where it's twisted .
and you have to watch that red needle .
notice where it starts .
the person heating, don't you watch, you watch what you're heating . 3438910_3446150
the other two watch the needle .
okay .
so if you've got to come around this side, come around this side .
fair enough ?
so there you go . 3446150_3458000
is it not working ? 3458000_3463180
put it up a bit higher . 3463180_3479000
there we go, and now pull it out .
okay .
you've got to pull it out once it starts .
all right ?
put some xxx it works . 3479000_3483180
is it cold ? 3483180_3484110
where's the bicarb gone, girls ? 3484110_3488120
oh, there's still some left .
that's all right .
it's very cold . 3488120_3489990
did you know that ?
really . 3489990_3490160
yeah, but it's stuck to the bottom . 3490160_3493000
that's all right . 3493000_3495130
clean it out now .
okay . 3495130_3496070
xxx . 3496070_3497100
well just keep you've got a um brush there too isn't there ? 3497100_3504080
wasn't there a test tube brush ?
use that .
finished . 3504080_3514060
ready to move on ?
are you getting it ?
don't use it all . 3514060_3516070
there's still groups to come .
broke up pieces . 3516070_3523080
how many more have you got to do guys ? 3523080_3525070
have you got to do station five, station six .
xxx . 3525070_3527930
I'm sorry and station seven . 3527930_3528070
okay, let's move .
what's wrong ?
xxx . 3528070_3530970
is is the battery um chemical ? 3530970_3533030
no, we're not worried about the battery at first . 3533030_3536960
what's coming through here ?
electrical . 3536960_3536980
electrical . 3536980_3537050
electrical . 3537050_3537990
so that's being supplied, and then what do you get ? 3537990_3540910
okay .
heat and light . 3540910_3540920
heat and light . 3540920_3541120
good . 3541120_3549950
okay, guys, ready to move on .
so please move on .
guys, come in now . 3549950_3552190
ready to move on ?
yep . 3552190_3553930
bring all the stuff with you . 3553930_3566990
did you work it out ? 3566990_3568130
now, when you heat this magnesium you want to use a blue flame . 3576970_3580060
okay . 3580060_3583140
oh . 3583140_3584050
sorry .
&=laughs there you go . 3584050_3589040
okay . 3589040_3591080
now it says use a xxx .
i thought we had to go ? 3591080_3592040
no . 3592040_3604040
we're going to use this because that's not it's not boiling, but it is hot .
it's fairly hot hot enough .
for the activity .
don't want to give you don't want to give you third degree burns, do we ?
that'll do you .
what's the baddest degree burn ? 3604040_3606000
third degree, isn't it ? 3606000_3607060
yeah . 3607060_3609050
I'm not sure is there a fourth degree . 3609050_3620020
now, guys . 3620020_3622120
this one, people keep getting confused about .
well light it, and you're going to hold it here with your tongs, okay ? 3624040_3628050
and heat that, okay ?
oh well, it's been ruined .
you got to hold it there, and &~heat see where it's twisted ?
this didn't work .
hold the end on there . 3628050_3634060
xxx .
put your glasses on . 3634060_3635010
it didn't work for us . 3635010_3637170
light the match and xxx ? 3637170_3638050
come round here ! 3638050_3650930
you guys just quick you've done the ping+pong, haven't you ?
notice where the red needle is .
it's on the zero, isn't it ?
you light it and i'll hang on, and i'll turn the gas on for you .
don't be scared . 3650930_3655170
oh, someones oops !
someone left the gas on .
who was here ?
I just I just turned it back on . 3655170_3656110
they say to turn it on .
i just burnt my finger . 3656110_3661900
once you've lit the match, you could have killed us all, lauren . 3661900_3674090
okay, light your match .
it should all be gone now .
hold it over there .
it won't do that again, roxy, okay .
just hold it .
there you go . 3674090_3685040
now pull it away .
now we're going to turn it to a blue flame .
now you're going to heat that twisted section in the blue flame, off you go .
oh, I didn't know that . 3685040_3688060
now, see that needle ! 3688060_3701990
what happened ?
did it move ?
it moved, didn't it ?
okay, oops pull it away now, it's broken .
okay, so it moved .
this is measuring electricity, so we started with what sort of energy ?
heat . 3701990_3702920
heat, and we ended up with ? 3702920_3704170
electric . 3704170_3705030
electrical . 3705030_3708970
good !
so i'll twist this again !
wouldn't it be hot though ? 3708970_3710160
won't be too bad . 3710160_3712960
xxx . 3712960_3714080
no it's not hot now . 3714080_3717920
xxx, what energy is supplied ? 3717920_3722140
well, what was the energy ? 3722140_3723050
heat . 3723050_3723170
heat . 3723170_3725030
good !
what energy is produced ? 3725030_3739930
energy ?
energy, electric .
complete the following .
heat to electric .
miss, can we do this one ? 3739930_3741920
no . 3741920_3746960
it's broken .
I've given up on it .
it keeps breaking .
cause people get there and twist too far ? 3746960_3747920
yeah I know, yeah I know, but we can't get that rubber band through . 3748960_3751190
have you done this one ? 3751190_3752010
xxx . 3752010_3753070
where's the magnet . 3753070_3775100
gilbert, can you go get me another bit of paper toweling, please, from the front ?
now !
we'll move on, soon .
so, have you done this one yet, guys ?
yeah . 3775100_3776940
so you have looked at this one ? 3776940_3783980
you worked it out .
oh, that's all right then .
oh, is this your last one ?
you can't do number nine . 3783980_3784980
because you can't do number nine . 3784980_3799040
there's one group that might've i'll check with this oh, yeah, we're up to this, I think .
is that a magnet ? 3799040_3801930
this is the magnet . 3801930_3804070
that's where you oh no have you done the ping pong ?
yes . 3804070_3805010
and you've done that you started the ping pong ? 3805010_3809990
so we're finished .
okay, good .
okay, guys . 3809990_3828900
just tidy up where you are .
just turn everything off .
so we're ready to move on, so tidy up where you are, but we no, ken .
what is this xxx ? 3828900_3830930
so that's from the magnesium . 3830930_3834100
it makes it into powder .
that's all this stuff, this powder here . 3834100_3838170
okay .
it's all over there .
so does that clean off ? 3838170_3839990
it will clean off . 3839990_3849040
okay ?
please go sit back in the chair that you started with, at the very beginning when we did the theory . 3849040_3860970
yes, thanks .
adam and guys, in ! 3860970_3878140
hurry up !
now, june, have you done the nichrome wire and copper one ?
activity six, I think .
you've done it ?
you guys haven't done activity six ?
right . 3878140_3890000
june and nelly haven't, have they ?
okay .
you quickly go now and do activity six, nelly and june .
the rest of you are sitting down .
okay . 3890000_3897020
yes, you can take your aprons off while I just finish with nelly and june .
they've missed out on one because they've been helping with that other one .
we haven't done the ping pong one either . 3900960_3903030
oh, we'll worry about that later . 3903030_3911930
you're missing two now are you ?
hold it at this end, right, and heat that twisted area, and watch this needle .
it's at zero, at the moment .
watch it when you heat it, okay ? 3911930_3913950
you mean, with the tongs ? 3913950_3914930
so ready, turn &~your light your match . 3914930_3916930
you hold it at the end with the tongs . 3916930_3924920
okay . 3924920_3941030
blue flame .
no, no, no, no, no, no, no .
just there a bit closer up, bit closer, a bit closer, a bit closer, a bit closer .
there's fine .
see where it's all twisted ?
heat that !
you watch the needle . 3941030_3948160
hopefully, it won't what's happening with the needle ?
it started exactly on the zero, and where is it now ?
it's going up . 3948160_3952970
on number one . 3952970_3953900
it's up a bit, isn't it ? 3953900_3955940
so it's moved up a bit .
what's this measure, again ? 3955940_3958900
no electricity . 3962110_3963190
what sort of energy ? 3963190_3965920
potential ? 3965920_3967080
what's in a flame ? 3967080_3968190
kinetic . 3968190_3969080
heat . 3969080_3970010
electrical . 3972990_3973910
electrical, okay ? 3973910_3978090
don't worry about the ping+pong one, we'll talk about that later .
okay ?
all right .
sitting down !
what can we xxx write all our stuff down ? 3978090_3981900
well, we're going to do it soon . 3981900_3983190
is there any chance I could leave early, because I've got to go to the office and get my report card from last term ? 3983190_3988970
you can go now, mate . 3988970_3992940
just pack up your books and go .
okay, year eights ! 3992940_4003920
listen carefully !
we are going to try and clean this lab up before we &~cl finish off this lesson !
there's a workstation at each of your benches .
so it'll be your job to help clean up your bench, so listen very carefully . 4003920_4018010
the goggles, you know where they belong, out the front, bottom drawer .
you know where these wooden boards belong, at the front . 4018010_4031160
be very careful over there in that corner .
you know where bunsen burners belong .
any used matches, in here, okay ?
any other equipment, you're to bring it at the front to me, okay, and i'll have some tote boxes . 4031160_4043900
we'll put it in tote boxes .
you ready ?
any matches out the front to me as well .
go !
miss, we smell gas . 4043900_4044140
i'll turn it off ? 4044140_4057140
xxx .
thank you ! 4057140_4061090
um, front, bottom drawer .
you know where it goes, over there !
where do these go ? 4061090_4088190
miss xxx, what do you want us to do with this station one stuff ? 4088190_4091930
uh, you know where beakers belong ? 4091930_4104940
uh, just bring those sheets of paper down the front, the stations, the actual instructions, matches to me .
station two ! 4104940_4106060
station two !
uh, front top, top um drawer . 4106060_4135910
thank you .
if there's any mess, remember paper toweling .
you can easily wipe it down .
nope !
they stay together, like that .
no . 4135910_4138910
it's all right .
i'll wipe up that later now .
thank you .
you're welcome ? 4138910_4150990
miss, they're xxx for you .
do you feel privileged ?
which sink ? 4150990_4152130
thank you .
oh, okay .
um, there's a rag .
just use that one .
second one . 4152130_4162920
do we take off our aprons ? 4162920_4164160
um, yeah, take your aprons off . 4164160_4183150
put 'em away .
boards, down there .
thank you .
thank you, those students that cleaned up the back bench for me . 4183150_4187130
excellent .
can I clean off the blackboard ? 4187130_4188930
no . 4188930_4210920
okay .
thank you .
sitting down .
shh !
being very quiet .
now, you would have done all of those stations, so if you haven't quite finished filling out your sheet, you could easy finish up tonight, can't you ?
okay ?
what I want to ask you now hands up, which ones were energy transfers, which stations ? 4210920_4222030
was an energy transfer, opposed to being an energy transformation ?
which, out of all those nine, was an energy transfer, as opposed to an energy transformation ? 4222030_4233120
jack ?
number five four or five . 4233120_4239060
the one where you burnt the steel wool .
you think that's an energy transfer ? 4239060_4243120
what's an energy transfer, jack ?
xxx . 4243120_4245920
what's an energy transfer, jack ? 4245920_4247130
I say number one . 4247130_4248180
no . 4248180_4251170
I'm asking another question now .
what's an energy transfer ?
an energy transfer is when energy goes from one form like for example from your foot to the floor, and doesn't change its form . 4251170_4260120
good . 4260120_4266030
it doesn't change its form .
let's try again, jack .
which stations do you think was an energy transfer ?
number one . 4266030_4267010
good . 4267010_4272030
all right number one, what was the what sort of energy was transferred in number one ?
jack ?
heat . 4272030_4273010
heat energy . 4273010_4274900
from where to where ?
from water to the spoon . 4274900_4276060
good . 4276060_4281930
all right, so that's one of the energy transfers .
the &~uh what are the other energy transfers .
seven . 4281930_4282940
number seven . 4282940_4287120
what happened up at number seven ?
kinetic to kinetic . 4287120_4288010
kinetic to kinetic . 4288010_4290990
where was the kinetic originally ?
in your finger, and it got transferred to the ? 4290990_4291050
ping+pong ball . 4291050_4291120
in your finger . 4291120_4294110
ping+pong ball . 4294110_4305110
any others, energy transfers ?
no ?
so what's the difference between an energy transfer and an energy transformation ?
what's the one main difference ?
one thing that will definitely tell you that it's an energy transfer or energy transformation . 4305110_4310980
brent ?
an energy transfer is when the energy goes from the same energy goes from xxx one object to another . 4310980_4316950
yep . 4316950_4317910
it changes its form . 4322170_4332160
so this one down here with the steel wool what energy did we start with ?
who could tell me ?
what energy did we start with down here ?
the steel wool ?
bob ?
chemical ? 4332160_4333070
before th it was chemical in the battery, and it became ? 4333070_4336090
stored . 4336090_4337080
no . 4337080_4341990
stored is chemical, in the battery, and then it became ?
heat . 4341990_4342160
no . 4342160_4343010
before that .
electrical . 4343010_4346990
heat . 4346990_4347120
electrical, and the electrical became ? 4347120_4348990
heat and ? 4348990_4350960
the steel wool ?
sound . 4350960_4351010
sound and ? 4351010_4352990
light . 4352990_4353150
light . 4353150_4367100
okay ?
so it changed from chemical to electrical, and then from electrical to heat, sound, and light .
so that's an energy transformation because we've changed forms, haven't we, jack ?
yes . 4367100_4368120
whereas the spoon in the, in the hot water, it went from heat energy in the water to heat energy in the spoon, so it did not change forms . 4368120_4382950
that was the main aim of the lesson .
homework ! 4382950_4399170
you're going to fill out this sheet, complete this sheet .
bob, you need to go now, don't you ?
so, you go !
grab this and go, because you've got to catch an early bus .
the rest of you aren't going yet . 4399170_4407160
just wait !
so that's your homework .
make sure it's completed .
xxx . 4407160_4409130
you go then . 4409130_4426010
no, wait ?
okay, can I have all chairs up, please ?
all the windows are already closed .
just your chairs up .
