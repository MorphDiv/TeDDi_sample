Tion we could talk about the gooey elements during the walkthrough
yeah . 5190_5260
so we can give what is . 5280_6040
the slides . 6500_6860
what_if you go up like slide six maybe . 7030_10460
way . 10940_11010
like . 13000_13090
you wanted part of that . 18280_18960
just tab it . 20710_21410
go . 22160_22290
tab the entire thing . 24160_25540
there you go . 26370_26690
&-uh I . 27120_27180
actually you're supposed to use the arrows up top . 28300_29720
did you see that arrow . 30320_31000
that doesn't &-uh . 33050_33930
what are these like spaces . 39600_41400
you don't want that . 43950_44470
does that look good . 45750_46280
why is that one . 50830_51520
yellow . 52050_52270
they're all yellow . 53650_54040
no . 55120_55270
what's yellow . 55990_56590
that last dash . 57030_57910
that last bullet is it . 58450_59830
oh you're right . 60180_60640
wow . 62230_62310
oops . 67530_67640
yeah . 68510_68550
I just keep it . 68690_69120
who cares . 69170_69600
they can't notice it . 69980_70550
they . 70570_70760
can't tell . 70810_71070
oh it looks white to me . 71250_71870
I don't know . 71890_72160
be a it'll be on a really . 72210_73790
big project . 73870_74150
there you go there . 74220_74840
yeah . 75360_75430
what'd it say . 75450_76000
maybe it's a projector . 76140_77190
is it contribution really . 86810_87920
I don't know any other word that works . 89100_90150
what else . 90520_90910
&-um interaction interaction . 92040_93150
yeah or participation participation is you know what I was
I was talking to a_lot_of people that have been living at the site
and &-uh they like registering like as with any site registering .
seems to be a pain in the ass . 106350_107610
do you know what I'm saying . 108610_109090
so thinking if there are other ways that we can what do you mean by
so simply that's . 117220_118190
let's . 119490_119630
see I think it's relatively simple though . 119840_121740
so this . 122020_122330
page . 122720_122860
yes . 122880_122940
no . 123170_123260
no . 123280_123350
but then there are the optional details which should like this . 123400_125140
well yeah . 125160_125490
optional .
this is optional . 125880_126360
you don't have to do it . 126540_127380
I think most people just think that they have to do it so . 129370_131430
they .
don't like it . 132240_132660
I mean if they don't know they don't have to do it . 132750_134740
yeah . 135510_135580
relatively I think it's way simpler than the others . 136820_139420
yeah . 139800_139910
so we could get rid of slides five and six maybe or maybe just like
yeah . 147840_147990
gooey . 148260_148550
slide six . 149660_150110
we don't need think . 150310_150870
what do you think . 150890_151220
slide six . 152140_152470
we definitely don't need . 152490_153170
okay . 160040_160220
and then maybe like . 161760_162670
that . 163400_163670
what_about that . 164020_164520
okay . 164890_165040
that maybe like . 165330_166310
I don't know . 167610_167930
I think if you're someone's going quickly through the front and
design . 172860_173170
just helps guide . 173890_174720
okay . 175210_175300
yeah I guess we should . 177470_177930
you wanna show your all the backend stuff that you really want to
yeah . 186750_186910
and like what percentage of the users use . 187190_190700
what kind of browser . 190830_191420
where do we want to place them . 191770_192830
yeah . 193230_193310
can we skew these results to make it rely less on Mac and Netscape
unless you just go to a Windows machine and keep reloading . 201240_203550
that's fine . 203570_203840
I'll do that . 203890_204280
no seriously because I mean that way if they like bring up Netscape
well our data suggests that . 210890_212280
no . 213790_213960
well we're ha we're gonna handle that . 214300_215800
eventually we know that's an issue . 215890_218230
