should I read this out loud ? 1_13951
yes, please . 13951_14360
factorial designs . 14360_16031
topics: independent variables, values on independent variables,
ok, great, thanks . 25783_26806
did you have any specific questions before we get started ? 26806_31086
yeah, but I was gonna save them for later . 31086_33055
you want to save them ? 33055_34438
ok . 34438_34830
well, do that then . 34830_36071
ok, um, what we have been talking about before have been simple
okay and what's making them simple is having two levels of one i_v
so what we're talking about now is complex experimental designs and
the addition of more independent variable . 56295_59101
right . 59101_59430
or increasing number of levels independent variables you got to
but you know, that's funny . 69646_71141
but that doesn't make it factorial . 71141_71853
oh, ok . 71853_72550
what makes it factorial is having the additional +/. 72550_75670
the addition of i_v . 75670_77013
the addition of variables this categorizes it as complex for some
okay just looking at that that instance, where we increased the
oh you could see more of an interaction . 94096_96101
uh . 96101_97141
an interaction ? 97141_97726
if, uh, there is such an interaction . 97726_100685
wait a minute . 100685_101566
I'm talking about just increasing the level of having more than one
I was close to <xxx> . 106068_107001
<there are some advantages> to just that too . 107001_109913
(e)scuse me ? 109913_111570
well, uh, if you were graphing it, you would be able to see if
can I ? 116686_118815
sure, please do . 118815_119781
you'd be able to see if you had for instance here's your little
if you had a positive and then a negative effect . 126636_132471
in other words curvilinear right ? 132471_134928
yes it's more like a xxx idea . 134836_136910
more like an upside_down triangle . 136910_138758
but anyway, sure, in other words it's more accurate picture and
another case might be a continuous variable you know you
no . 159686_160390
ok . 160390_161343
I'm just a junior scientist I don't know anything . 161343_164198
oh . 164198_164573
ok, I'm sorry to hear that . 164573_166030
a continuous variable is one in which there are an infinite number
like you know, if we were looking at age, we usually don't study
we would look at maybe five years or ten years or whatever . 183133_186750
but anyway, if you increase the number of levels, then you're
ok, now . 191868_194908
factorial designs . 194908_196156
increasing number of i_v's xxx um we can learn what there is to
that may not necessarily tell us anything about a combination of
I'll agree with that . 217790_218966
good . 218966_219606
wanna elaborate on that ? 219606_220886
yeah . 220886_221981
let me find where you are . 221981_223013
I'm on page ninety five . 223013_224798
increasing your number . 224798_225535
ok, gotcha . 225535_225975
increasing the number of independant variables okay um what would
uh, well, you could see more of an interaction like we said before .
ok . 239261_239773
as long as it xxx um, um, also, you could study uh, more than one
well, why couldn't you just study more than one main effect by just
with those two variables seperately . 257708_259716
well, then you wouldn't have as much of an interaction between the
yeah, but you still look at my main effects . 263108_265175
or you, or you look at you main effect . 265175_266590
yeah, but it it would tell you Ok, so, uh, the lack of oxygen and
so big deal . 276470_277453
that doesn't tell you anything . 277453_279150
uh, so if you add the other independent variable, oxygen, then you
well, what about practical reasons you wouldn't need hardly any
that's true . 290413_290750
that's true . 290750_291108
why don't we try to come up with a more psychological example ? 291108_294906
you started it . 294906_296123
I know I did didn't I ? 296123_297586
let's say, what sort of experiment well let me think what if we
okay our hypothesis is the teacher praise +/. 311300_315721
is conducive to +... 315721_318401
is conducive to xxx . 318401_321793
ok . 321793_322728
ok . 322728_323040
how about we decide to set up a study to look at that what sort of
well, you'd want to set up uh . 330801_332600
you can draw if you'd like . 332600_334743
can I ? 334743_335440
do I have to ? 335440_336148
yeah, if you want . 336148_336988
no, you don't have to . 336988_337253
that thing stinks . 337253_337828
in more ways than one, right ? 337828_341213
yeah . 341213_341645
ok, you might wanna set up, uh, two independent variables one of,
student learning ? 353028_354451
I said, I said my two conditions are conditions of praising or
ok . 361055_361541
those are my two levels . 361808_362445
that's just one independent variable . 362445_364773
that's right what else can we do to it ? 364773_366480
do you want another ? 366480_367040
do you want another ? 367040_368695
well, do you think it might be advantageous to do so ? 368695_371480
yeah . 371538_372361
ok, why ? 372361_373376
uh, it might be able to tell you little more about students and
ok . 379520_380290
well, I'm gonna start drawing then . 380290_384473
ok . 384473_385153
ok . 385153_385898
be my guest . 385898_386385
uh, you might wanna use the crowded noncrowded condition . 386385_391890
ok . 391890_392736
that we used before in chapter three or chapter two . 392736_395635
wll look it up ok, I see . 395635_397595
ok, I'm kidding ok, so we have a pen that does write . 397595_401138
this one's good . 401138_401993
ok so we have i_v one and that's gonna be our teaching method and
two . 420435_420816
two levels . 420816_422111
level one is xxx . 421960_433085
okay what might our dependent measure be ? 433085_436173
learning doesn't it ? 436173_439356
yeah but how am I . 438960_440628
xxx . 440628_441116
do you just go out and say, measure learning ? 441023_443320
no, no, no, no . 443320_444040
uh, you would, you would, you would test learning students uh,
ok, how ? 450391_452373
uh, wonderful learning abilities or poor learning abilities . 452373_457110
you would give them some sort of achievement test . 457110_459190
finally ! 459190_460013
why don't we just say test score ? 460013_461956
why not ? 461956_462525
well but what test would you use ? 462525_464628
that that's . 464628_465685
uh . 465685_466196
nevermind . 466196_467981
well we could discuss that if you want . 467981_470590
how about just a test on material that they were taught ? 470590_473310
like the regular midterm exam ? 473310_477078
yeah, but . 477078_478741
ok, Ok . 478741_480036
but what ? 480036_480348
no, if you have any objection, go ahead . 480348_482045
I would think you would want it, for ethics sake, you would want to
oh, so you're saying you think the two teaching methods are
no, no, well . 498868_499411
if measuring the two teaching methods is not fair ? 499411_502701
a little of both . 502701_503083
ok . 503083_504108
maybe, um, you would want to have some subject that was neutral, or
hmm . 515163_515950
in other words, <you think, maybe> . 515950_516588
<xxx> . 516588_517108
so we'd want to make them neurotic . 517108_519851
oh, Ok, Ok, forget I said that . 520171_525363
no, no . 525363_526890
honestly, you know it's good that you raisd these sorts of issue
um, hopefully the fact that they're praising good behavior and
but you know obviously there are some ethical consideration we can
no, just go with this one that's fine . 551858_552748
ok, alright . 552748_552996
ok . 552996_554525
we have our teaching method, we have our dependent variable . 554525_556691
alright, this is one i_v, and that's, obviously, if we run the
but what might be some other factors in there ? 562573_566123
what if we are randomly going to assign . 566123_567900
if we're gonna randomly assign these kids, obviously, the ones that
so we might wanna get some otheri_v as well . 575003_578133
I agree, I agree . 578133_581628
ok, ok . 581628_582013
like what might be an example of xxx . 582013_584645
uh for independent variable number two ? 584645_587811
yeah . 587811_588396
uh . 588396_589236
you said xxx . 589236_590660
I did, didn't ? 590660_591083
yes, you did . 591083_591765
xxx . 591765_592556
it was the crowding condition . 592556_594198
ah, yeah, the crowding verses non_crowding . 594198_595655
so we can say these people were going to be crowded and these are
ok so there's our design . 604666_608753
could that be, uh, county schools verses public schools ? 608753_612578
county schools verses public or county verses city ? 612578_616960
or public verses private ? 616960_618293
uh, yeah, well, public verses private . 618293_619860
ok . 619860_620483
anyway, now that we have decided . 620483_623483
alright, so what do we have here ? 623483_625915
we have a factorial design . 625915_627963
yes, we do . 627963_628820
right, Ok . 628820_629788
what can we look at, in terms of this experiment xxx there we go . 629788_637405
well, before I answer this, I have a question for you . 637405_640291
ok . 640291_640901
although you have two independent variables, is this considered a
right . 647405_647858
you have two independent variables on twl levels . 647858_648903
actually, you've simplified you've simple, you're remaining on a
within each variable . 656246_657105
is that what you're saying ? 657105_658383
you're saying each variable has two levels . 658383_660280
yeah, see you've done away with this here
magic ! 663233_663825
and um . 663825_664656
no, not necessarily you still have two levels . 664656_667640
well, <you can only> you can only get linear relationships on
<yeah, yeah, two levels> . 668551_672680
yes, you are right . 672680_673391
ok . 673391_674440
for each of the i_v's . 674440_676096
so we don't have a complex factorial design ? 676058_678338
we just have a basic factorial design . 678338_680571
yeah, yeah . 680571_681170
it's factorial that compares more than two simple or complex . 681170_684185
I don't know, I don't know how the book . 684185_687035
<I> it didn't go into it, no . 687035_689378
it didn't go into that, I know . 689378_690050
um, usually, what I would think of as simple, is the two levels
yeah . 710556_710955
ah anyway . 710955_714275
yes . 714275_714746
ok . 714746_715156
so by virtue of the fact factorial design, we can look at do we
we can't look at just xxx ? 731980_733490
oh no, no . 733490_734106
we can still look at that the main effects of each ah independent
in other words, it's relationship is what ? 738163_740595
what would be the main effects of i_v relation to . 740595_743410
the dependent variable . 743410_744253
right . 744253_744661
ok, alright . 744661_745681
so we can look at that and yet we can also look at the interaction
xxx . 749843_750810
ok . 750810_751685
there might be similiar results we might get here . 751685_753453
if we had a main effect, for IV one what would that be ? 753453_757805
you could say, praise leads to better learning abilities, whereas
poorer learning ? 767700_768273
I'm getting deeper . 768273_768976
I notices . 768976_769465
I'd like to throw in another variable . 769465_770961
uh, criticism toward neurotic children leading to poorer learning
ok . 778345_778738
but taking it from a simple point of view . 778738_781440
thank you . 781440_782008
praise, uh . 782008_783208
praise might be xxx . 783208_785240
yes, verses criticism but criticism xxx make a child work harder
you're mumbling . 795095_798515
I, I, I know I'm mumbling . 798515_800191
okay . 800191_800775
I'll do better . 800775_801263
alright . 801263_802303
alright . 802303_802951
so what might happen with just IV two ? 802905_805858
IV two ? 805858_806785
you could say that crowded conditions lead once again to better
ah wait excuse me, poorer learning conditions . 810773_813715
well, that could be better, you never know . 813715_815323
<that probably wouldn't be xxx> . 816078_816878
<that depends on if you're in the city or the county> . 816878_819053
and the uncrowded conditions are more conducive to good learning . 819053_823436
ok, alright, so what might happen if there were an interaction ? 823436_827325
if there were an interaction, you might say praise and an uncrowded
xxx interactions can mean that, um, it works differently . 836973_844955
it may be that, um, under uncrowded conditions, it doesn't matter
it's only once they get in crowded conditions that praise or
<xxx> .
<now you're going against the book> . 861733_862213
the book says it depends, one independent variable depends on the
and that's what I just said . 868273_868890
no, no, no . 868890_870201
yes it is . 870201_870740
okay look . 870740_871786
you said, you said that this uncrowded condition . 871786_873946
right, I said just the uncrowded . 873946_876025
it may be that in the uncrowded condition, it doesn't matter if
but it's only once this level changes, that this one is
ok . 887508_888123
the book doesn't make that clear . 888123_890875
ok . 890875_891371
we need to . 891283_892531
point it out . 892531_893010
let me highlight it . 893010_893553
yeah, let me find it . 893553_894721
let's see I wan to make sure I have it right . 894721_896698
I agree, I agree . 896698_898835
I'm sure it's in there somewhere . 898835_900001
no ! 900001_900561
let's find it . 900561_901323
xxx . 901323_901715
that makes sense though . 901715_902306
ok . 902306_903523
let's look at what it says . 903523_904873
an interaction effect . 904873_906761
that's on ninty seven . 906761_907693
these main effects tell us that the over, that overall, there are
if there is an interaction, the main effects from the independent
interaction between independent variables . 922581_932750
in other words, when the question, using their example, when the
however, when the questions . 941101_943125
ok, so that would be like one i_v . 943125_944650
they had xxx . 944650_957096
and they had knowledgeable xxx . 957096_965073
I'm only kidding . 965073_965408
I'm kidding . 965408_966201
I believe you . 966201_966808
and what was the other one ? 966808_968488
oh, the xxx that verifies the questions . 968488_971903
ok, alright . 971903_980111
wait a second . 980111_980743
let me cheat . 980743_981168
my book's different from yours, I got the older edition . 981168_983591
ahh, tsk, tsk, tsk . 983591_985503
ah hah . 985503_990398
knowledgeable I don't even know if I have this . 990398_994581
ok, well, I'll give you the brief runthrough . 994581_999510
ok, well, I got what you read before . 999510_1002718
ok, ok . 1002718_1003206
this is the xxx experiment where the two levels of this variable
uh huh, uh huh . 1014695_1015070
ok . 1015070_1015455
this is where they asked leading questions about the situation in
gotcha . 1030383_1030940
alright . 1030940_1031363
when the questioner is knowledgeable, in other words, we have this
however, when the questioner is naive, in other words, we've
uh huh . 1054371_1054946
so that's the same thing I was describing here . 1054946_1056578
in the uncrowded condition, ok, it doesn't matter if it's praise or
well . 1067081_1068341
that's an interaction . 1068341_1069038
I disagree with that . 1069038_1069870
ok . 1069870_1070398
because you have no control over, like I said before, it may be a
you don't know if it's having some effect or not . 1079573_1082151
you're going to have to explain to me what you mean by neurotic
ok, say you, you, ok, the child that reacts to criticism and goes
are you just saying an individual differences in their data ? 1095045_1097645
yeah . 1097645_1099156
I mean that's gonna be controlled by, uh, if you had random
that doesn't really have anything to do with the interaction, I
I mean, am I addressing you question ? 1116763_1120556
yeah, yeah, pretty much, but I still disagree with that . 1120556_1124428
ok, well, how would you explain it ? 1124428_1126108
how would I explain it ? 1126108_1127036
what do you think's an interaction then ? 1127036_1128468
an interaction ? 1128468_1129251
well, I agree for you, with you for the most part . 1129251_1132835
we go to get this pinpointed, seriously . 1132630_1136126
no, I don't, no, I don't . 1136231_1138143
what do you think is different about it ? 1138143_1139823
I, I still think that you could have enough of an effect from
um, to blow the hypothesis . 1148791_1150208
right . 1150208_1150543
well, that's fine, this is just an example . 1150543_1153208
I'm just worried about xxx . 1153208_1154768
I, I understand the for +/. 1154768_1155745
do you agree with that, that that's the definition of an
yeah, I do, I just wanted to split hairs . 1159200_1160510
I could see that . 1160510_1161758
I, I agree with everything you've said so far . 1161758_1164430
you know you could always prosecute me for this . 1164430_1166941
no, that's Ok . 1166941_1168733
take me to APA ethics court . 1168733_1172396
ok . 1172396_1173003
but supposing you no this is later on, I'm sure you're gonna
ok, good . 1179451_1180131
I'm looking forward to it with bated breath . 1180131_1183051
ok . 1183051_1184266
ok . 1184266_1189695
so the main effects tell, the main effects tells us the one
right, right . 1202373_1202645
ok, Ok . 1202645_1204901
looking, just briefly, we're gonna mention the outcomes of
is it possible to have a main effect for one independent variable
sure . 1228161_1228538
ok, is it possible to have no main effects for any independent
yeah . 1233425_1235265
waste of money and time . 1235265_1236290
ok, well, but if that happens, is it possible to have an
I mean, you have no main effect . 1239858_1242208
what are you studying ? 1242208_1243880
I'm just speaking in hypothetical terms . 1243880_1247825
hypothetical terms . 1247825_1248385
you want an interaction with no main effects ? 1248385_1251560
if that's possible, can that occur ? 1251560_1252680
no, no . 1252680_1253823
yes it can . 1253823_1254168
oh, come on . 1254168_1254945
yes . 1254945_1255480
yeah, but you have no main effects . 1255480_1257145
but you can have an interaction . 1257145_1259456
you would have, if you graphed it, and you have no main effects,
no, wait a minute . 1267808_1268326
no, there is a graph for it . 1268326_1269520
in fact, it's one of our examples . 1269520_1271655
I thought so . 1271655_1272151
but, yeah I'm sure you did . 1272151_1274543
let's look at our, do you remember our, and I so handily erased it,
and IV two of the xxx overcrowded . 1280983_1288238
it may be that it doesn't matter that the teaching effect alone
it may be that crowded or uncrowded doesn't make a difference, but
so that's where we have the interaction, but not the main effects .
this I don't understand . 1308566_1311191
how could you not have a main effect ? 1311191_1312623
well, because of the teaching which, whichever teaching method,
and whether it's crowding or not, doesn't make a difference . 1317798_1320598
it's only when you put them all together that you get a difference .
this is a bad example . 1323670_1327550
this is a bad example . 1327550_1329970
I, I can't see one without the other . 1329970_1332130
you can't . 1332130_1332985
I can't see an example of teaching effects <being neutral and then
<ok, well, let's think of something else> . 1335775_1337983
and then having some sort of effect . 1337983_1340093
ok . 1339861_1340533
well, um, in theory, in theory it is possible . 1340533_1345758
let's see if we can think of another one . 1345758_1346951
how about if we . 1346951_1347645
theoretically oh wow . 1347645_1348398
theoretically, yeah . 1348398_1349445
you didn't say that . 1349445_1350341
well . 1350516_1350971
ok, do you know what a pursuit rotor task is ? 1350971_1354346
no . 1354346_1355195
well, good . 1355195_1356133
I've got something to tell you . 1356123_1356668
enlighten me . 1356668_1357268
I will, thank you . 1357268_1358966
it's where you have, um, a, um, like a record with a dot on it and
uh huh . 1367533_1368181
ok ? 1368181_1368893
get the picture ? 1368893_1370381
got it . 1370381_1370751
alright, alright, let's say we have a pursuit rotor task, and d_v
on the pursuit rotor task, Ok . 1377391_1382686
you might wanna focus in on that I don't know . 1382686_1386603
oh, I don't know let's hope . 1386603_1388240
ok . 1388240_1389968
IV one is might be the size of the dot . 1389968_1395095
on the record that they have to keep the stylus on, Ok ? 1395095_1397835
i_v would be speed . 1397835_1399658
very good . 1399658_1401001
IV two is speed of the record . 1401001_1404058
ok . 1404481_1406080
it may be that making the dot bigger or smaller doesn't
uh huh . 1415865_1416968
it may be that how fast you make it go doesn't significantly affect
ok . 1421111_1421535
but it may be that if you make the dot really small and really
but if the +/. 1429228_1431115
you don't see that, I know . 1431115_1432475
if the size of the dot doesn't matter, and the speed doesn't
well, both of them together because it's like too much all of a
well, what about if . 1438895_1439990
well, wouldn't it be just something you're not really controlling
ok, it could be, but if you deliberately manipulate it, then it's
then it, then it would be . 1448135_1448910
then it's an i_v though . 1448910_1450398
and it would have some sort of effect . 1450398_1453541
an interaction effect, but it alone doesn't have an effect, one, or
let's look at this one . 1457528_1459583
ok . 1459583_1460000
I disagree with this . 1460000_1461471
I really do disagree with that . 1461471_1463225
ok ok . 1463225_1464003
well, let me try one more thing . 1464003_1465395
you're not gonna convince me . 1465395_1465973
I'm sure . 1465973_1466790
I don't care . 1466790_1467213
that's fine, but let me try this . 1467213_1469156
what about your studying for an exam . 1469156_1471285
ok . 1471285_1472388
ok, and your roommate turns on the stereo real loud and I don't
alright, you roommate turns on the stereo really loud . 1478220_1481531
gotcha . 1481531_1482285
ok, you're studying along and it kinda has an effect on how you're,
then your roommate turns off the stereo, your roommate turns on the
well, pretty soon a couple of his friends come over, and they're
all of that might affect your ability to study when you want to
possibly ? 1511125_1513245
possibly . 1513245_1513933
possibly . 1513933_1514676
ok . 1514676_1515933
alright . 1515933_1516565
now . 1516565_1517205
what . 1517205_1517741
why don't you think, do you think . 1517741_1518588
well, uh I +... 1518588_1519036
do you honestly think there's no possibility in the real world for
if you do this . 1526268_1526861
if you go . 1526861_1527908
ok, erase the second variable and then study this way and say the
but I don't see how you can define the two and say there is no main
ok, do you see the size of the dot might not have the performance ?
yeah, but I don't see +/. 1546368_1547743
provided that the subject can see the dot . 1547743_1549406
true true . 1549406_1549878
you know it's not microscopic . 1549878_1550933
where is it ? 1550933_1551638
ok . 1551638_1553246
alright, you can see that . 1553290_1554466
that much, I agree with . 1554466_1555218
ok, wait . 1555218_1555616
taken independently . 1555616_1556793
go ahead . 1556793_1558513
I hate to be redundant . 1558513_1559465
taking the independent variables independently, I, I can agree with
right ! 1567776_1568601
that's the whole point, that's the interaction . 1568601_1569825
but, there would still be some effect . 1569825_1573305
right . 1573305_1574425
an interaction effect . 1574425_1575648
but it might Ok . 1575648_1577393
there there should be a main effect also . 1577393_1578665
ok . 1578665_1579368
taken together . 1579368_1580071
not necessarily . 1580071_1580840
you can call it interaction, but it can still be taken as main
how can it be taken as main effect ? 1584968_1587280
because just because you add two variables together, doesn't mean
ok, you're saying that . 1594691_1595003
ok, alright . 1595003_1595325
look at this you're saying that you don't think that there's a
ok . 1604268_1605586
and dependent variable with IV two alone . 1605586_1607140
those are two separate experiments . 1607140_1608588
right, Ok . 1608588_1609413
you're saying that you don't think that if you did an experiment
right . 1617753_1618735
such that you can only, only examine the effects of one and only
for this, for this particular situation, I would say, Ok, you don't
but when you combine the two, not only do you have an interaction,
because your design has changed . 1637503_1638960
yeah, exactly . 1638960_1639488
some how they're not pure . 1639488_1640271
is that what you're saying ? 1640271_1641888
right, right . 1641888_1642608
in a sense ? 1642608_1643103
ok, well . 1643103_1644320
I hate to be so hard nosed about it . 1644320_1647031
no, you don't . 1646986_1647363
no, you don't . 1647363_1649386
well . 1649386_1650755
but anyway, um I think there is some there are some legitimate
I do think you can still look at the main effects of one
statistically . 1665611_1666018
statistically, it's quite possible . 1666018_1666618
yeah, Ok . 1666618_1668085
ok, so in that sense, yes you can . 1668085_1670285
whether if in fact manipulating IV one in an experiment alone,
whether if you xxx both of those at once or with the same subject
you know, in sort of external and internal validity sense . 1693620_1698683
that's a good question ok ? 1698683_1703703
ok . 1703703_1704136
but I think, I think a lot of I don't think it's a major
oh, I don't either . 1709506_1710106
depending on your depending on your, <wholly depending on your
<well, we'll see> . 1712035_1713803
in the next ten years . 1713803_1716876
ok, alright, statistically, you can just look at the main effects .
mixed factorial design, what does that refer to ? 1720948_1726180
garbage . 1726180_1727363
refers to garbage . 1727363_1728620
ok . 1728620_1729483
this is where I want to start raising some questions . 1729483_1731803
I wrote down a few things . 1731803_1733235
ok . 1733235_1733850
uh, the last, next to the last paragraph, it says um, talking about
ok . 1744203_1744475
you can't, can't just totally disregard the notion of causality,
it's not in this one . 1760508_1761401
what ? 1760841_1762561
ok, go ahead, that's probably why they took it out . 1762561_1765191
probably so . 1765191_1766711
anyway, they they just totally disregard the notion, well they
they mention extraneous variables, and the notion of cause and
and they say in um, this mixed design . 1776240_1779871
uh huh . 1779871_1780215
you have totally understand the behavioral sciences in order to
that's, you know, well and good, if you understand it, fine, but if
ok . 1800625_1801415
they didn't they didn't explain that at all . 1801415_1803175
right, Ok . 1803175_1803510
well, the mixed design only means that you're, in combining
what we usually think if as correlational variables are often
uh huh . 1828436_1829063
in other words like I said age gender something like that what, the
<xxx> . 1853425_1854918
and vice versa . 1854918_1856270
does your experimental manipulation have a differential effect
right . 1864748_1865161
so now what I don't understand is what was your question about ? 1865161_1867873
uh, uh, Ok . 1867885_1868805
what did they leave out ? 1868805_1869380
if you do look at it that way, how do you control for +/. 1869380_1874500
external ? 1874500_1875198
yeah . 1875198_1875868
it, the only way you could do it is the same way you do it for
random assignment . 1884920_1887615
ok, obviously, for something like correlational variables you can
ok, you cannot randomly sample males and females in that ok I'm
ok, obviously, you cannot randomly sample people to make them male
right . 1911128_1911335
but we can, one we have the males and females, randomly assigned
um that's the best we can do, and obviously, with subject variables
what kind of study did they do ? 1928616_1931188
direction and mixed design oh they used neurotics in this one . 1931188_1935300
<they talk> oh they said proof read in type a@l and type b@l
oh . 1940820_1941211
and the type b@l personalities did worse when there were lots of
well, this also talks about cause and effect . 1950203_1953148
how do you determine cause and effect using a mixed +/. 1953148_1956068
in a mixed design ? 1956068_1957043
ok, if you're saying xxx . 1957043_1962028
I'm saying if you're using a mixed design, you're in for a lot of
variables ? 1969728_1970278
ok, I think, obviously, that that is a danger when because like I
I do too, and it says um . 1976223_1977978
what does it say ? 1977978_1978651
um, mixed designs offer a very appealing method for investigating
okay you got that to can you do something similar to that . 1993955_1996616
no, they just dropped it right there . 1996616_1998703
they could have written another two pages about this . 1998703_2001680
ok, well that's true, they could have elaborates . 2001680_2003471
when you get to grad school, you . 2003471_2007168
elaborate for me, elaborate for me . 2007168_2008455
I'm just saying or I'm not saying but the point of this is what I
the fact that I'm a female doesn't mean that I'm gonna react
you know, but, obviously, because we're looking to use
so, if you were to pursue that notion and just drop the idea of a
what notion ? 2058096_2059536
the notion of the separation between xxx ok, if you wanted to
this is hard to get acros(be)cause we're talking about neurotics
ok, xxx then, you can look at it in those terms . 2101255_2113868
however, if, I mean, you know, just because, obviously, all your
you know there's a difference in just having all these different
yeah, yeah that helps because . 2141905_2146561
because there's a difference in just, I mean, whether or not you've
the old randomization . 2161825_2163838
or, or matching on the one or two characteristics and letting the
ok ? 2167270_2167708
ok . 2167708_2168325
I just hate that the book did that . 2168325_2169585
yeah, well I hate so too . 2169585_2171661
I hope I that xxx . 2171661_2173355
yeah, yeah sure randomization sure the answer to everything . 2173355_2175990
yeah, uh huh . 2175990_2178261
trying to give me that false sense of security, right ? 2178261_2181965
right . 2181965_2182421
ok . 2182421_2183301
subject assignment in factorial designs . 2183301_2185293
speaking of subjects . 2185293_2186356
yes . 2186356_2186796
ok . 2186796_2187325
what happens if we had independant groups in our factorial design ?
what would that mean for say one subject ? 2192675_2196418
if we had a subject you know, Chris Cross as our subject . 2196418_2204060
and we want an independent groups design ok this is still IV two
what happens to Chris ? 2212395_2214046
xxx . 2214046_2216758
and in independent groups ? 2216758_2218066
one and two one and two chris is there all the way . 2218066_2222115
in an independent groups . 2222115_2224534
independent groups . 2224534_2225103
in an independent groups, Chris is only gonna get one or two of
what am I thinking . 2230695_2232175
I think you thinking of repeated measures . 2232175_2235088
oh, see there it is right there . 2235088_2236808
yeah, look at that . 2236808_2238311
so, Chris is going to get say, um, one which was the xxx, one he's
and he's gonna get the smaller dot size one . 2251433_2259615
first he gets to one or the other and then here comes Mary moive
ok, Mary's gonna get . 2266778_2271703
well, she might get the same combination, or she might get a forty
ok ? 2279280_2280161
but she's not gonna get both size of dots and she's not gonna get
what's the independent ? 2284185_2285610
that's the independent . 2285610_2286448
and the repeated measures . 2286448_2287745
would be what would happen if Chris xxx . 2287745_2289545
then he would get . 2289545_2290225
what ? 2290225_2290881
everything . 2290881_2291401
xxx . 2291401_2292313
you'd get thirty three . 2292313_2292986
at with the +/. 2292986_2294698
small dot . 2294698_2295195
then a large dot . 2295195_2296673
then a large dot . 2296673_2297291
and forty five with a small dot . 2297291_2298705
ok . 2298608_2299073
and the same for Mary movie star . 2299073_2301015
great, thank you . 2301015_2302216
you welcome . 2302216_2303025
ok . 2303145_2303631
what about the combination, though ? 2303631_2305368
everything in groups . 2305368_2306408
it doesn't happen as frequently when you have your repeated
mary, on the other hand, got the other speed every time of day as
ok ? 2346505_2347530
so that all the subjects are getting every contintion at the time
so how would you go about making a comparisons between the groups ?
well, what do you mean ? 2360768_2363966
uh, say you assign Chris to that one speed and then all conditions
uh huh . 2369855_2370646
and you assign Mary the other speed likewise . 2370646_2372743
uh huh . 2372743_2373135
how do you make a comparison ? 2373135_2374406
well, you're not gonna look at just that time of day to see xxx at
there may not be xxx . 2380350_2383383
at five:o'clock in the afternoon, however, there might be a
well how do you xxx ? 2385678_2387118
well, there might be a main effects, but there might be an
very good, that's very good . 2394488_2395438
who's asking the questions ? 2395438_2396910
well alright, um suppose Chris was assigned a thrity three and that
and Mary was assigned a forty five and that was it . 2403780_2405981
xxx . 2405981_2410996
more or less . 2410996_2413716
more or less . 2413716_2414548
ok, well, let's say xxx . 2414548_2419940
unless it was a repeated measures then Chris would be exposed to
that's right . 2424586_2425706
that's just your main effect xxx . 2425706_2431946
ok . 2431946_2432443
that I understand also xxx . 2432443_2436343
um, supposing for example that Chris was given a repeated measures
ok . 2443488_2444078
thirty three throughout the day at different times . 2444078_2447085
right . 2447085_2447548
and the size of dot varied xxx small to large, small to large etc .
etc . 2453898_2454170
etc . 2454170_2454483
ok, so it's still a combination . 2454483_2457155
yeah . 2457155_2457835
because one xxx the other two xxx . 2457835_2462306
right, but how do you account for say burnout, or +... 2462306_2466393
well, that's just a hazard of the repeated measure, you know xxx . 2466393_2472296
so just chunk this design or +... 2472296_2473730
well, xxx having the fact that xxx with Chris doing it over and
I know, I know it's hard to accept, but . 2499345_2502528
my major . 2502528_2503635
you might as well just go find another field go study
anyway . 2508033_2509803
it isn't over yet . 2509803_2510748
yeah, it's been long over, but you seem so interested . 2510748_2513795
well, I still have a few questions, if . 2513795_2515588
ok . 2515588_2515860
you wanna turn that thing off . 2515860_2517195
I'm kidding . 2517195_2518171
woo . 2518171_2518666
um, well, go ahead with what you xxx we've discussed everything but
statistics . 2526326_2528221
oh, it is . 2528221_2529215
stastistics . 2529215_2529796
no it is statistics . 2529796_2530533
and um we didn't discuss that or cells xxx . 2530533_2537276
cells xxx The statistics are xxx . 2537528_2542818
we did mention statistics . 2542818_2543736
in other words, there's a difference in talking about statistical,
oh . 2550575_2551070
I thought you were gonna get into more detail . 2551070_2553896
well, I can get into as much detail about statistics as you want,
go ahead . 2558871_2560271
I think we'll stick with this . 2560271_2562768
cells . 2562768_2565530
ok, the cells xxx cell matrix xxx graph there is a whole bunch of
bunches of em . 2571945_2572688
ok, we're gonna get into that xxx a topic, but we can briefly
well, this is my last tutoring session . 2579016_2581505
oh, you don't get it next week ? 2581505_2584168
what a shame . 2584168_2584703
I don't get it ? 2584703_2585543
is that how y'all put it ? 2585543_2586608
that's it . 2586608_2587520
wait til I tell the xxx . 2587520_2590120
ok . 2590120_2590591
um, looking at your cell matrix xxx the graph tells you a really
uh huh . 2598791_2599223
if the lines are not parallel, xxx an interaction . 2599223_2603023
xxx . 2603023_2603703
ok . 2603703_2604318
the cell matrix, however, is a much quicker way to look at xxx main
uh huh . 2616286_2616846
ok . 2616846_2619381
I agree with that one . 2619381_2619765
great, good . 2619765_2620486
the cell matrix is a much better way of looking at xxx . 2620486_2624493
the twp by twp factorial design, you have the four cells xxx . 2624493_2630868
yes, it's the simplest factorial design . 2630868_2633148
yes, it is . 2633148_2633876
the two by two has two IV's at two levels . 2633876_2640276
two independent variables at two levels . 2640276_2640683
and you multiply it to find out the number of cells . 2640683_2644860
four . 2644860_2645125
um . 2645125_2645508
and this would be what ? 2645508_2646851
three independent variables . 2646851_2648308
ok, and how many levels would one have ? 2648308_2651940
the first one would have three, the second would have two and the
ok, and how many cells ? 2654820_2655925
three times two is six times two is twelve . 2655925_2657891
isn't that amazing ? 2657891_2658978
xxx . 2658978_2660611
I want to talk about power . 2660611_2663923
statistical power ? 2663923_2665578
yeah . 2665578_2665931
ok . 2665931_2666380
to have a good sampling, what would be a good xxx ? 2666380_2676446
xxx . 2676446_2678420
or does it depend on the study ? 2678420_2679360
that depends entirely on the subject . 2679360_2681150
there are whole books written Cohen's is the classic statistical
depending on how many independent variables you have, what's the
yeah xxx . 2701351_2702333
used to, used to you would see xxx a minimum n of you know like ten
that's interesting . 2716681_2717625
anything else ? 2717625_2721065
I'm sure you can come up with something else . 2721065_2724048
yeah, well . 2724048_2725425
let's see where, um, I got a few things . 2725425_2733393
I was afraid of that . 2733393_2734773
ok, you answered that one . 2734773_2736773
um, for the levels, for the levels and number of dependant
right . 2747473_2747791
what gets me, Ok, you have the first independent variable has three
and in order to see a curvilinear relationship wouldn't you want to
that way you could tell if you had some sort of other . 2767286_2771710
ok, yeah, the three level one is going to enable you to have
only the one with the three will have . 2780813_2783670
xxx . 2783670_2785198
something like this . 2785198_2785933
if you're looking at an interaction, something like this . 2785933_2791183
you know xxx interaction but this one at three points, but see
xxx . 2804713_2809206
oh, uh huh . 2809206_2810448
see look at this ? 2810448_2817241
yes, you can a curvilinear relationship, because you only need that
uh huh . 2822631_2822935
the other two, xxx the others will be put on the lines in the body
and they are gonna xxx measures xxx . 2833695_2840126
well, how can they have measures when, how can they have ? 2840621_2842253
this would be this would be your xxx . 2842253_2844318
but how can you do that ? 2844318_2846236
xxx graph it . 2846236_2848198
because the way they play off the first variable ? 2848198_2850516
because you measure, Yeah, because it's measured xxx and at this
to me that seems more of an assumption . 2861150_2862748
well, actually . 2862748_2863116
xxx . 2863116_2864148
but see you get the xxx . 2864148_2873926
but supposing there was more in there besides just just that
supposing that you use three levels for b@l and you found out that
instead it went like this . 2890973_2894756
yeah that's fine . 2894756_2896243
well, at what point do you reach complexity and say, Ok we've got
and there's just no way we're gonna be able to xxx . 2903435_2905571
I guess at what point do you, well Ok, I guess you know that what
the third dimension ? 2920028_2921410
right . 2921410_2921923
if it was a four, like a three by two by two by two . 2921923_2926475
don't tell me the forth dimension . 2926475_2927161
xxx it would be virtually impossible to depict practically . 2927161_2934650
however, it still exists, because you can look at the interaction
you can look at a four way interaction, a three way interaction, a
see, supposing you wanted to keep it simple, and you had a choice
xxx simple ? 2950286_2951133
well, Ok, Ok . 2951133_2953055
supposing you wanted to keep simple and complex . 2953055_2956325
style . 2956325_2956988
ok . 2956988_2957580
you had a choice between a three by two by two or a three by three .
what would you opt for ? 2962906_2964906
xxx obviously, you have third variables and forth variables . 2964906_2970370
and I know you think I'm I don't understand what you're saying, but
but you do later studies to find out whether third variables are
sure you could . 2977370_2978371
but in this case . 2978371_2979650
but you might wanna look at it xxx as far as having measured, sure
ok, I gotcha . 3002906_3008408
well . 3008408_3008873
I know that sounds like I'm trying to evade the issue, but it's
right, um, it just seems like you would want to keep it as simple
well, it may be that you would need two levels xxx and I think it
well, we're starting to get into too many moral and ethical issues .
we better . 3048045_3048788
well, I think we won't assume the blame for heading in tha
