just don't wanna do the wrong thing and then have somebody's lawyer call me in the morning saying my client was recorded against his will . 5495_13215
okay &-um we did we talked about medical ecology on Monday and today we're gonna talk a little bit about epidemiology this is my favorite epidemiology cartoon . 14155_25235
I don't know why I get such a kick out_of this but &-uh &~bu but I do and you know here are two of just the clueless children that are gonna come out here and say oh yippee . 25935_34995
can I get a shot too ? 35675_36755
so epidemiology is not a subfield of medical anthropology &-uh lest you think &-um that it is because we're going to be talking about it today as a matter of fact there are many people for whom the two sciences seem absolutely impossible to &-uh to reconcile . 37395_55475
epidemiologists have one way to justify their claims to knowledge about events of &-uh sickness and healing they have their own way of achieving knowledge their own way of verifying this new knowledge about sickness and health and anthropologists have another and one which is &-uh which was quite different . 55875_73795
among practitioners of both disciplines both epidemiology and anthropology as_well_as among their audiences the two &-uh are sometimes regarded as pretty tangential &-uh to one another if not entirely antithetical there are people who when you ask them to think about epidemiology and think about anthropology &-uh would feel as if we're talking about two opposite ends &-uh of the spectrum here . 74385_96985
epidemiology is seen first of all as a completely objective science . 97895_103035
it's seen as an objective science that focuses on associations that are very clearly specified +... 103395_110675
it uses variables that are very precisely defined . 114655_118775
and the way it looks at those associations is through things like measurement and counting and statistical analysis . 120675_126555
so one definition of epidemiology might be the scientific assessment of clearly specified associations among precisely defined variables through measurement and counting and statistical analysis . 127055_140235
anthropologists have accused epidemiologists of being totally immersed in their own particular scientific bias and my favorite quote made by an anthropologist about an epidemiologist is that epidemiology practices rigor to the point of rigor_mortis . 142435_160955
&=laughs:multiple anthropology by contrast is &-uh clearly if we didn't have epidemiology up here it would be a rare person that would substitute anthropology right over there anthropology is thought of as a subjective discipline and that is not necessarily a pejorative sort_of thing .
it's thought of as subjective it's thought of as devoted to understanding the inner worlds of other people +... 178175_183975
and it does so by means of very close very empathetic encounters . 186695_191895
so the two disciplines seem to share very little granted these are somewhat stereotypic &-uh notions or definitions or or narrow definitions of the two but I think that they do not appear on the surface to have very much in common . 193395_207095
historically though anthropologists and epidemiologists have worked together for a very long &-uh period of time and there has been increasingly a call for more anthropology to find its way into epidemiological studies and the reverse as well . 208275_221635
for more anthropologists to avail themselves of things that are thought of as epidemiological methodology . 222035_226615
epidemiology is rooted in the observation that disease does not occur randomly but in patterned sorts of ways . 227115_236395
I think that a medical anthropologist would say just exactly the same thing looking for patterns of beliefs and behaviors or even patterns behind beliefs and behaviors is something that anthropologists always do so it isn't so much that we are polar opposites as that we sort_of go at getting at the truth in &-uh in very different directions . 237375_260055
epidemiologists are often after universal laws . 260615_264555
what they will try to do is eliminate local particularities to see what's global . 265055_270095
anthropologists on the other hand focus on the uniqueness of local settings focus on the particularities and sometimes they do this so that they can see what this tells us about larger things but certainly eliminating uniqueness or eliminating local particularities is not something that an anthropologist would build into her or his research . 271595_292155
so in thinking about a way for us to talk about epidemiology that would be sort_of a less dry comparison &-uh anthropologists do this epidemiologists do this this'd be good for anthropologists to do and borrow from epidemiology this'd be good for epidemiology to borrow from anthropology I began to think about some of the similarities and and differences between &-uh the two sciences and I started to think about the concept of risk . 293045_314605
because risk is something that epidemiologists talk about all the time relative risk absolute risk all all manner of of risks . 315895_323235
and &-um lots_of people talk about risk risk is is a very colloquial part of the way we talk about things that have to do with health and illness but oftentimes when different people are talking about risk they're talking about it from vastly different perspectives . 324155_338735
much like &-um when the Christian missionaries &-uh found that the Hmong had a tremendous belief in the soul . 339455_347675
the soul was a big part of Hmong cosmology and the soul and saving the soul is a big part of of Christian ideology as well . 347875_354575
missionaries seized on this because they thought that it was something that could be translated across these cultures , something that was the same . 355075_361055
but when Hmong talk about the soul they are not talking about what Christian missionaries are talking about and when epidemiologists talk about risk they are not really talking about the same thing <&-uh that> &-uh that the lay individual is talking about . 361545_374025
so that risk is a construct that can take on a different meaning depending on whether the language being used to talk about risk is the language of epidemiology which is one &-uh one way we can think about risk or the language of clinical medicine which is a different language of risk or whether we're talking about the language of the lay individual . 374065_400725
each of these three groups of people has a relationship with risk defines risk &-uh in a particular way . 401155_408395
so these three languages of risk can be used can be &-um manipulated in the way any kind of of language can be to either affirm or to challenge many sorts of things . 408935_425655
to affirm or to challenge existing relationships of power oftentimes power and risk come together . 426185_432445
to affirm or to challenge issues of control sometimes control and behavior control and access to resources center around risk or even to express very deeply held feelings of vulnerability or responsibility . 433285_448965
so risk is a very very rich kind of concept . 449885_452645
&-uh and I thought that it was something that we might want to take a look at not just for today in terms of epidemiology but in terms of the readings that we have been doing and &-uh and will be doing . 453025_463405
for most epidemiologists risk exists as a statistical construct . 463985_468085
<it's a> it's a product of analyzing aggregate data in a &~particula particular way yeah Sue . 468585_472505
is is this idea of risk tied in at all to probability ? 472505_476765
+, probability of of certain variables playing out in particular . 477405_481005
I think that that risk is tied to probability tremendously in &~e in epidemiology and a_lot but &-uh but <in a> in a more liquid way in clinical medicine +/. 481465_493505
mhm +/.
+, and a_lot &~in &~w within the lay individual in terms of perceived &-uh susceptibility . 494625_499725
so I think that susceptibility is every bit as malleable &-uh and as changeable as as risk is . 500065_507745
and I think that probabilities &-uh differ right along with +//. 508245_511745
they covary with the idea of risk throughout these sorts of things I think . 512005_515325
and you'll see in the example I'm gonna give that probability does come up &-uh as well . 515525_519105
and I'm gonna ask you to take a little test at the end and we'll see &-uh what you think about probability also . 519165_523305
so &-um starting starting with epidemiologists they construct risk <in a> in a way that seems very solid to them they take the data and they analyze it in a particular way . 524145_533765
what clinicians can then do is take the language of epidemiology the information provided them &-uh by epidemiology and express their own clinical agenda through using epidemiological information and different &-uh different health care providers will have different sorts of of agendas . 534445_551865
obstetricians for example can argue that lowering the risk of some complication is a very good justification for some form of technical intervention in birth or some form of clinical intervention in the birthing process . 552155_566635
and groups like the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Medical Association and the Canadian Medical Association use risk to legitimate their opposition to home births and to midwifery for example that &-um that this is the level at which they speak about &-uh about birthing processes . 566745_584765
conversely those who challenge &-uh medical controls also can employ the vocabulary of risk . 585545_591145
midwives then turn around and claim that their much less interventionist less technological mode of delivery reduces risk to both mother and child so the concept of risk and and things that can be cited are available in all of these &-uh different languages . 591645_609305
supporters of home birth have all sorts of tales of problems that are caused by doctors caused by &-uh being in hospitals that would never have occurred at home when nature would have taken its course and nobody would have been &-uh intervening in this particular way . 609575_623035
epidemiologists speak the language of risk very dispassionately and it's <it's the clinical> it's clinical medicine . 624155_631635
it's doctors and it's lay individuals who add a more political and more emotional layer to their language of risk . 631875_638995
and and if you read &-uh things about risk you'll find that the language of epidemiology into the language of clinical medicine whether it's doctors or nurses into the lay language becomes more more passionate and less dry as people go ahead to use these &-uh these kinds of numbers . 639235_657075
when we think about health and illness we don't only think about organisms or pathenogenesis or whether we go to a doctor and someone else goes to a shaman . 658115_666815
we think about risk and we're taught to think about risk . 667395_669595
that's sort_of built into a_lot_of ideas about illness . 669675_672895
sometimes we decide whether or not something could be something &-uh depending on whether or not we feel at risk for it . 673095_679455
and &-uh and different people assess their own risk in a very &-uh different sorts of way . 679995_684795
sometimes the ways in which different levels of medical culture miss each_other have to do with the different ways that people define or accept or reject the idea of &-uh of risk . 684995_698175
and since epidemiologists are sort_of in the business of telling us about risk and they do it <in a> in a very sort_of dispassionate way it seems as if risk is something that should be a very objective sort_of thing . 698255_709195
when you see people begin to &-uh live the experience of risk or risky behavior you can see that it becomes something that's much &-uh more subjective . 709395_718835
so &~i if you think about &-um smoking or drinking or &-uh or driving a car or having sex or getting tan or travelling by &-uh by airplane &-uh or what_have_you , you think about or you are asked to think about risk in terms of so many of &-uh of the things that we do in the course of the day . 719215_737175
so given that that's so I think that it's &-um a cultural idea that's very relevant for us when we're looking at at illness in a cultural sense and &-um I was thinking about it even in &-uh reading the Fadiman there are lots_of articles we've already read in the course pack and and more to come most especially the Verghese article &-uh about about AIDS . 737465_757305
when we start talking about sexuality and &-uh reproductive rights and death and dying we'll also be be using the idea of of risk . 757675_766415
&-um a_lot_of what we read about in &-uh The Spirit Catches You hasta do with risk and the way all the different players involved differently assessed what was risky and what people were at risk for . 767155_781455
&-um the way the doctors thought about what was being risked by not giving Lia her medication was something very very different than what her parents thought she was at risk for . 782065_792845
what she was at risk for at base was tremendously &~dif different between the family and &-uh and the medical establishment and which behaviors were risky were entirely different . 793185_804685
the the doctors thought that it was risky to not give this child the medication and the family saw for a fact that it was very risky to give her this medication because I think they said +"/. 804825_814785
+" she became a different child when we gave her the medication . 815165_817525
+" she wasn't the same person . 817665_819105
that's a very &-uh terrifying sort_of thing . 819225_821765
&-um look at how the doctor assessed what was the worst possible risk for this child . 822425_829145
it was clearly riskier to let her stay living with her family and not get the medications right than to remove her from her parents as a two year old and give her to strangers just so she would be given her her &-uh epilepsy medicine . 830305_846185
that's an entirely different &-uh conceptualization of what is risky what's riskier taking a two year old away from her parents or not giving her her &~epil her epilepsy medication ? 846525_856005
and clearly different players involved in this were assessing risk in an entirely &-uh different sort of way and if you were to read something epidemiological about what happens to kids with grand mal@s:fra seizures who don't give them &-um their epilepsy meds none of this would be in there <it would> &-uh it would be approached &~i in a different sort of way . 856025_874405
so I think it's an interesting thing to think about &-um especially as we get into the healer portion &-uh of things because &-uh risk is something that becomes &-uh very explicit when &-uh when medical personnel &-uh is talking about stuff . 874505_887225
so I thought that this would be an interesting thing to pursue &-uh a little bit . 887405_890825
and we'll probably do it more after the break as well and we can segue right from medical ecology into epidemiology and risk and not even have to leave our friends the Inuit . 890905_902105
that's how relevant this is to &-uh to Monday . 902265_906305
because two medical anthropologists Canadian medical anthropologists examining childbirth and risk among &-uh the Inuit did a very interesting &-uh study and talk a little bit about these different languages of risk and &-uh and how anthropology and epidemiology kind of articulate together in this . 907505_927025
these folks were living in a place called the Keewatin . 928265_931625
the Keewatin is an area of the arctic on the &-uh western coast of Hudson Bay in Canada and they provide a very good example of the cultural construction of risk and how this can sometimes bump into the other languages of risk the +//. 932345_949345
the language used by clinical medicine and and the language used by epidemiology +... 949825_952625
there are about four thousand Inuit who live in seven communities in &-uh in the Keewatin yeah xxx work (be)cause that's all I have which is good . 955455_964395
each of these communities each of these seven Inuit communities &-uh in the Keewatin taken together four thousand people has &-um a small health center called a nursing station . 965475_975235
and these nursing stations are staffed by anywhere from one to four nurses &-uh depending on the community size and and and they're staffed all the time . 976545_984845
at these nursing centers routine prenatal care is provided to all pregnant women by the nurses and then a visiting physician will will come by will will rotate around all of these various nurses' stations a_couple_of times during the course of their pregnancy not a whole lot so mostly they were managed by the nurses that staffed this place . 986345_1005245
the nursing stations are run by the government . 1005785_1007725
and it was official policy &-uh at at the time of this study that all births should occur in hospitals that was the way it was supposed to go . 1008905_1018185
and so about two or three weeks before their due date women were sent to the hospitals . 1018965_1024685
&-um in cities like like Winnipeg so &~a at two or three weeks before their due date so they would get there in time they were separated from their families forced to leave their &-uh their younger children at home <if they> their older children at home if they had any and and sent to the cities to await birth so they could give birth in &-uh in the hospitals . 1025325_1044685
up until the late seventies most nursing stations had at least one nurse midwife and the policy at that time was that low risk women however they defined low risk at at this time and this place low risk women were delivered by nurse midwives at the nursing station . 1045085_1061065
and it was only high risk women that were shipped out_of the Keewatin into city hospitals . 1061925_1066205
however in the early eighties there was a policy change and the a mandate came down that all women were to be evacuated from the Keewatin to hospitals for delivery . 1066455_1077775
however more babies were stillborn at the nursing station than anyone expected &-uh mostly because when women went into labor prematurely they hadta be delivered there . 1078415_1087035
but women purposefully arrived at the nursing station already in full labor . 1087575_1092715
they stayed at home as long as they could stand it knowing that there wouldn't be time to airlift them out to get into the hospitals . 1092795_1098175
so &-um despite this government policy women &-uh did try and manipulate it a little bit by just saying +"/. 1098515_1104075
+" well gosh you know I I didn't know I didn't really know . 1104235_1105935
+" I was in labor until here I am and now it's too late to get me out so you've got to deliver me here . 1106035_1110195
and &-uh and and so that happened . 1110915_1112215
but after a while you know people got wise to that and when folks came in for their checkup and they were about three few weeks away from their due date people would say now you know we don't want you just waiting too long and going into labor so as we have to deliver you here so &-uh they got busted &-uh after a couple years of doing that . 1112425_1127605
women were extremely upset with <this change in policy> this change in policy that said no matter how your pregnancy is going or who you are you cannot deliver in a nursing station you hafta be airlifted to the hospital but there wasn't much that they could do about it . 1128535_1141315
there were traditional Inuit midwives who still lived in the community but they were very old and they had not delivered babies in many years . 1141815_1149515
they began to cede control to the nurses because the nurses did a good job and it was done in a very similar way to the way midwives did . 1149485_1156605
no new indigenous midwives were trained and so when things escalated and and births weren't really being done in a way that was a good substitute for a midwife &-uh they were stuck . 1156845_1166025
there weren't folks to deliver them locally . 1166165_1167805
not only that but you can see how these power relations develop . 1168505_1171905
the whole family got medical care through these nursing stations it wasn't just obstetrical care . 1172705_1176745
it was sort_of like a family practice type place . 1176985_1179805
so women knew that &-uh if they were labeled noncompliant if they were you_know put up a stink about where they delivered their children this might have a negative impact on health care for their whole family . 1180425_1192965
their kids , other kids are being treated there , their their parents their &-uh their husbands their siblings . 1193245_1197705
and so it was very difficult for women to refuse because it wasn't just her own delivery &-uh that &-um that she was talking about she +//. 1198065_1205525
they were really afraid that they might compromise care for their whole family and women were unwilling to risk doing that so that was another piece of of of the risk that got factored in there . 1205725_1214165
women complained but they were generally compliant and and got airlifted out . 1214765_1218385
as regulations about mandating births in hospitals got stricter and stricter there was more and more local opposition . 1218545_1225705
there was a point after which when more and more technological intervention was being mandated &-uh that that women started to be very upset . 1225765_1232065
until finally a team of investigators was assembled to go in and see what in the world was going on with these pregnant women in the Keewatin . 1232445_1239505
and that's how these anthropologists &-uh got involved because &-uh it was a a research team that had a_lot_of different &-uh folks on it . 1239945_1247665
&-um there were epidemiologists too but <it was> it was a a lovely way to combine epidemiological perspectives and anthropological perspectives &-uh in one study which is why I'm telling you about it . 1248265_1259745
it was questions of risk that were at the center of this debate that's what all of this focused around that's what everybody used to talk about this &-um particular issue which is why I I chose this study to take a look at . 1260685_1273545
much of the work of the project was committed to the measurement and to the evaluation of of risk risk to the mother risk to the baby risk to the family risk to the community &~o of evacuation that was what was at the core of this study . 1274545_1289145
but the anthropologists involved were also interested in risk as a concept risk as a value not just as a quantifiable measurable thing . 1289685_1297645
the epidemiologists were going in there and saying well look we have to see how much risk there really is here and the anthropologists said yeah but how do you define risk and risky to whom ? 1297975_1306795
okay this is the arctic . 1307575_1309155
it's very cold . 1309915_1310555
it's vast . 1311235_1311815
travel is a problem communities <are very> &-uh are very scattered and isolated . 1312355_1316835
transport of patients of doctors of medication of blood samples of medical records are all done by plane and &-uh flights are few and expensive and the weather can sometimes close off communities for days at a time so at the beginning of airlifting women out it was not a very easy thing to do getting those women out_of there to deliver them in hospitals was no mean feat . 1318075_1341935
the arctic has not changed very much since the seventies but technology has changed tremendously . 1342605_1347765
as the seventies became the eighties landing strips got upgraded planes were upgraded there were better aircraft there were pressurized aircraft which made it safer to transport &-uh women in labor so you didn't hafta be delivered at the nursing station just because you were in labor and couldn't go in an unpressurized little plane to Winnipeg you could &-uh go in pressurized aircraft . 1348645_1370885
so all of these technological advances had an impact on obstetrical policy making . 1371845_1377905
you might think what in the world does technology &-uh on an airstrip have to do with &-uh with obstetrics but &-uh but it really had tremendous effects effects that was +//. 1377845_1386905
that were direct in that pregnant women could be evacuated more easily but also indirect because perceptions of just how inaccessible these Inuit communities were changed tremendously . 1387305_1398445
it became logistically much more easy to get in there get these women and get them to &-uh to hospitals and as it became easier to do this it became ideologically much more difficult for administrators to allow birth to continue in the communities . 1399085_1413305
it wasn't that oh well it such &~a it's so risky and it's so arduous to get in there and get them out we might as well at least let some proportion deliver there . 1413845_1420825
so you can see how these things are all &-uh work together . 1421185_1423705
I will spare you the long version of the place of the Canadian government in Canadian childbirth . 1425445_1429325
suffice it to say that statistics about infant mortality are a very symbolic marker about countries and the powers that be in countries are very aware of this . 1429485_1440165
you always see comparisons of infant and &-uh and and perinatal mortality used as indicators of &-uh just how advanced a country or a community is . 1440305_1451405
we use &-uh these sorts of statistics as ways to talk about how good things are &-uh in different places . 1451505_1458425
there was a tremendous gap between the rates in the north and south of of Canada . 1458965_1464065
and the government stepped in <&-uh and> &-uh and mandated &-uh all this stuff about birthing in hospitals and the rates of infant and &-uh perinatal mortality improved and that became proof of the government's wisdom in making these decisions about intervention for birthing . 1464985_1483565
however &-um one of the major reasons that perinatal mortality was high where it was high had absolutely nothing to do with childbirth . 1484065_1492365
although the government was able to use statistics to their advantage . 1492645_1495005
it hadta do with the fact that changes in the migration patterns of caribou resulted in starvation among many groups and babies and postpartum women were the ones who died because they were the most at risk . 1495585_1508905
they were the ones who &-uh <who were> who were the most tenuous to begin with and they suffered the most <from &-uh> from &-uh various things that hadta do with with malnutrition . 1509725_1518985
changes in the migration pattern of caribou resulted in &-uh in in starvation and &-uh but the statistics showed that babies and &-uh and newborns and &-uh and mothers were the ones who were most at risk at dying where they &-uh birthed at home so these statistics were able to be used &-um to the government's advantage . 1519665_1543425
&-um in the Keewatin the Inuit &-uh gave up their nomadic lifestyle they settled into coastal communities and sanitation and nutrition were very poor . 1544175_1554035
infectious disease was a problem &-uh among this group and &-uh people became dependent on government services and the government response to a tuberculosis epidemic was to send people south to sanatoriums where they often died . 1555935_1570855
this was the history of these particular people the people that were now &-uh being sent south to deliver their babies &-uh in in hospitals . 1570985_1579185
&~th the communities really suffered they suffered tremendous disruption &~d demoralization and and families were separated . 1579765_1585865
the government feels like they saved &-uh the Inuit from starvation and extinction and &-uh and tuberculosis but the evacuation of women to the south to give birth is still very much colored by family members' remembrances of what happens is the government comes in and takes you and sends you south in the seventies with TB in the eighties or nineties to have a baby and you never come back . 1586175_1610515
and so &-uh people who were trying to put these things in place completely missed the history of these people . 1611005_1616725
their their relationship to what happens if the government says you're sick here's what we're gonna do to take care of you we're coming in to get you and we're sending you south and you never see these folks again and and families are torn apart . 1617445_1628265
so this was very salient to the Inuit women &-uh and it was &-uh completely ignored by by policy makers . 1628805_1635105
as childbirth technology grew childbirth outside of a hospital began to look less and less acceptable <as it does> as it does in other places not just &-uh in the arctic because the gap between what could be done in the hospital and what could be done in these nursing stations was getting <wider and> wider and wider . 1635995_1653835
the more newly trained nurses and &~ob and obstetricians became reliant on the things they learned in their training which were technological things the more technology got substituted for skills . 1654475_1667015
so the nurses and doctors that got assigned to these nursing stations +//. 1667735_1671495
although in a biomedical sense they were maybe better educated because they had much more &~u understanding of technology and and &-uh and monitors and scopes and all that new kind of stuff . 1672155_1680975
and that people who came before them were actually in a sense sort_of doubly unskilled because they didn't have the machinery to use at these nursing stations . 1681545_1690205
and that was the only way they knew how to manage birth was by using these machines and they didn't have any idea what to do without the machines . 1690545_1698205
so in a sense these more highly trained folks who were at these nursing stations were much less well suited to be there and take care of people than than people ten or twenty years before them . 1698725_1708285
they didn't have any experience with untechnological birth and they had no confidence they could manage childbirth without technology and they kind of didn't believe that most people could manage childbirth &-uh without technology . 1708415_1719575
so these public meetings took place and &-uh the health professionals &-uh defended their position and the epidemiologists came <and gave> &-uh and gave their their position and the Inuit women came to talk about their feelings about being evacuated to a hospital to give birth . 1720195_1735375
and the dialogue that went on at these meetings centered around risk and the dialogue was in all three languages of risk the epidemiologists would say stuff and the clinicians would say stuff and then the women in the community would say stuff too . 1736005_1748265
&-um and the women would complain about being evacuated . 1749145_1752225
the clinicians &~wou would &-uh listen and their answer would be to talk about mortality &-uh rates and the risk of of birthing <in the> in the nursing stations and those sorts of things . 1752345_1762385
and one woman said that she could not remember a single mother or baby dying in the previous sixteen years . 1762405_1769525
and I meant to bring a book to be able to read you this &-uh this big long quote so I wouldn't have to &-uh type it down here . 1769925_1774545
but the transcript of these meetings were was really quite interesting because you can recognize even without the little &-uh notation to the left that tells you the the status of the person who's talking whether it's a physician or one of the women or or &-uh or someone from the public health department . 1775005_1790025
you can see just by the +//. 1790305_1791445
their language of risk who they are and &-uh and what they're talking about . 1791685_1795145
the doctors would use epidemiological language in an attempt to &-um convey this very complex information to a lay audience . 1795605_1803485
you can hear him trying to sort_of translate what the epidemiologist told him to try and make these poor folks understand &-uh how risky it was to have babies and to try and persuade these women that it really was in their own best interest to be evacuated out and go someplace else to &-uh to to give birth . 1803505_1822145
and when the women protest doctors &-uh say things like +"/. 1822645_1826925
+" look this risk exists whether you choose to believe it or not . 1827445_1831085
+" it just is . 1831185_1831885
+" this is the truth . 1832025_1832605
+" the truth is you're putting yourself at risk and you can say no I'm not but you're just as at at just as great a risk whether you believe it or not . 1832705_1840085
she is not impressed by by his numbers by by by his &-uh language of risk because &-um statistical death does not hold as much sway for her as her own experience which is of no deaths . 1840685_1854205
so the doctors and epidemiologists come in and say +"/. 1854585_1856325
+" well you know for every thousand women who gave birth this way these sorts of things happened . 1856405_1860665
and she would say +"/. 1860845_1861425
+" I've lived here all my life &~ha as have my mother and grandmother . 1862065_1865265
+" I've never seen anybody die in childbirth . 1865705_1867865
+" I don't care what happens in your hospital in Winnipeg . 1868085_1870825
+" I'm here and we're talking about &-uh here . 1871245_1873465
so he gets all flustered and goes on to say well you know I've seen seven women die horrible you know horrible &-uh deaths . 1873725_1879225
none of them were Inuit none of them were from Keewatin no one none of them was giving birth at home they were all from this hospital where he was but he wanted her to believe that this was a risky &-uh situation . 1879675_1889675
he +//.
his +//.
he said +"/. 1891535_1891755
+" look I have all this clinical experience and my clinical experience is women die in childbirth . 1891955_1897175
+" that's what happens &-uh &~some sometimes . 1897415_1899415
and the local people &-uh turned things around &-uh &~i &~i in their own way <in a> <in a very> &-uh in a very elegant sort of way . 1900185_1908165
they challenged the doctor's philosophy . 1908325_1910365
they they challenged the doctor's ethics . 1910605_1912365
and &-um there was an Inuit language of risk that came through very clearly and it was rooted in Inuit culture and Inuit experience and it didn't derive from some generalized nonprofessional view of the world . 1913185_1927265
many of the people at the meeting were elders who were traditional Inuit midwives the community felt they should be there &-uh at the meeting and their view of childbirth as you might anticipate was that it was a naturally safe process . 1927675_1941655
the clinicians' construction of childbirth was that it was inherently dangerous you're in this dangerous situation and what you need to do is everything you can do not to let the danger happen . 1942575_1951895
the midwives saw it as an essentially safe sort of thing . 1952655_1955635
and if you sort_of let things go along as they should go along chances are things are going to be okay . 1956185_1961605
so <in the> &~r in in some rare instance something will go wrong according to the midwives . 1962245_1966865
according to the clinicians in some rare instance something might go right if you didn't have machines . 1967065_1970705
but do you want to risk it when you know when you're delivering &-uh your your baby ? 1970905_1974385
Inuit assumptions about the general riskiness of human existence was linked to their own history as it would hafta be where else could they formulate their ideas about <what is> &-uh what is risk ? 1976165_1987245
&~a one woman said and I do have this quote &{l=READING we live in an isolated community where we put ourselves at risk for any number of life threatening situations . 1987885_1997005
we live here . 1997665_1998225
this is our choice to live here and if anybody feels that they can't live with that risk then they probably move elsewhere . 1998885_2005285
the possibility of losing a child simply because of the place that we live if that happens that's a sobering thought and it'd be a terrible thing to happen but it's still our choice to live here . 2006105_2016365
&}l=READING so &~y you've heard the cultural history <of the> of the Inuit just a little bit in talking about the caribou &-uh sort_of stuff &~a and tuberculosis &-uh and those sorts of things . 2017785_2026585
people for thousands of years survived in a harsh environment this is their experience of the way they <live their> &-uh live their lives . 2026685_2034685
through their own competence through their own skills through whatever whatever way they've adapted to their environment they manage . 2035065_2040425
we we talked on &-uh on Monday about the Inuit &~an and dogsleds and five thousand calories and not eating livers of polar bears these are folks who know <how to> &-uh how to get through their their days . 2040865_2051585
their understanding of the natural and what is natural is something that they bring with them to the childbirth experience . 2052355_2058295
<one of the &-uh> one of the &-uh elders who who was a midwife I think said &{l=READING the Inuit people do not believe that having a child being pregnant birthing is a disease . 2058935_2069015
it's a part of life it's a normal function of a human being &}l=READING and in the sense that it's not a disease they don't think you need to be in a hospital so risk isn't denied so much as accepted in some sense as part of the reality of life in the Keewatin one person asked &{l=READING can you guarantee me my life tomorrow ? 2069495_2086895
I live here there's always risk in my life every day . 2087155_2090155
you wouldn't live if you didn't live with risks . 2090635_2092455
&}l=READING so &-um you can see that their response to &-uh to people telling them that they were at risk for something was rooted in their own experience and and and health beliefs and and birthing hasta do &-uh with the same sort_of thing for the physician risk in childbirth is a constant and frightening element of his clinical life . 2093235_2111675
his job is to to manage the risk that's inherent in in childbirth . 2111875_2116215
the bigger question becomes not only in this example but in other things that we'll read and talk about who has the power to define risk and to insist that their view should be the one to prevail over others ? 2116555_2128675
and and this is the sort_of thing we think about daily when we're thinking about drinking and driving or practicing safer sex or who should be allowed to come in contact &-uh with with whom . 2129055_2138215
so &-um &~th the debate sort_of moves away from the the question how much risk is acceptable to you to what kind_of a society do you want ? 2139145_2147245
and the Inuit clearly wanted a society that wasn't mandated by this other kind of &-uh of definition of &-uh of risk . 2147625_2154965
&-um and the encroachment of the government on this particular part of native life was &-uh was a very interesting example of of these different languages of risk . 2155665_2165405
we have evolved a very interesting relationship &-uh with risk . 2166025_2169525
there's been some very interesting debate lately I don't know if you're following it in the paper about warning labels on products there's been a_lot in the paper about it in the past few months not labels on &-uh on cigarettes or alcohol that's interesting too but this is &-um using the language of risk to which we resonate greatly <in our> in our health culture for some entirely different cultural agenda . 2170545_2190185
some of these warnings seem absolutely ridiculous until you understand why they're there . 2190635_2195515
let me share some of my favorites &-uh with you and all you have to do is go to Toys R u@l-s and you can find these too . 2195995_2200355
there is a Batman costume on sale at Toys R u@l-s . 2200875_2205035
this is what the label on the package says and I quote &{l=READING parent please exercise caution . 2205495_2211875
for play only . 2212735_2213755
&}l=READING this is a Batman costume for play as opposed to what ? 2214315_2217015
&=laughs:multiple as opposed to you know a disguise to stick up the Seven_Eleven I guess okay &{l=READING for play only . 2217835_2221655
mask and chest plate are not protective . 2222535_2224915
cape does not enable user to fly . 2226755_2229755
&}l=READING &=laughs:multiple now as a parent I'm really glad you know this warning is there because otherwise I might have let my kids go right up to that window you know you wanna go for a flight hon ? 2230635_2237855
okay but do you have your Batman cape on ? 2237915_2239555
&=laughs:multiple xxx we want to be safe now <don't we> . 2239855_2241755
put on that cape and out the window you go also at Toys R u@l-s same aisle even Toys R u@l-s there's a plastic toy hardhat that tells you not to use it for safety at a construction site . 2242935_2252455
&=laughs:multiple can you just see the construction worker who's gonna there there's this +//. 2253215_2256195
his helmet you know and his kid's helmet which one shall I wear to to work ? 2256435_2259935
oh I think I'll take this pretty pink one . 2260055_2261655
it was pink . 2262035_2262735
okay . 2263335_2263515
McDonald's you may &-uh recall was told a few years back to pay a customer two point seven million dollars because the coffee that she drank was so hot that she scalded herself two point seven million dollars . 2264055_2276175
so McDonald's coffee cups now have a warning on them that reads &-uh &{l=READING caution contents hot &}l=READING at Starbuck's if you look they are classier at Starbuck's their cups say &{l=READING caution the beverage you are about to enjoy is extremely hot . 2276695_2291375
&}l=READING that shows you McDonald's Starbuck's . 2292015_2293595
&=laughs:multiple in North Carolina a teenager was crushed to death this is not supposed to be funny . 2294315_2300075
but it's funny a teenager was crushed to death when a soft drink vending machine fell over on him okay ? 2300435_2307095
the upshot of this is that the court ruled that soda machines now hafta have a warning on them . 2307675_2313175
&=laughs:multiple I don't know if this is just in North Carolina or not . 2313275_2314735
the warning says that they are big and bulky and you should not like rock and shake them violently if you lose your fifty cents &-uh because if they fall on you . 2315745_2324125
they will crush you . 2324265_2324985
this is the level that we are are dealing with about now okay . 2325145_2327505
also at Toys R u@l-s not to single them out &~i it could be at Kmart just as well but I just happened to be at Toys R u@l-s there is a five dollar plastic sled . 2328425_2336705
it is a four foot long piece of red plastic with a four foot long label stuck to the back of this the label is as big as the sled . 2337145_2344465
&-um here's some of what it says on this sled &{l=READING wear a helmet at all times when sledding . 2345285_2351465
allow no more than three riders at a time do not ride while lying on stomach while lying on back or when standing . 2352145_2359465
<avoid trees> &}l=READING avoid trees it says on this honest to goodness . 2360165_2363985
&{l=READING avoid trees stumps rocks branches or any manmade objects . 2364655_2369855
&}l=READING have we eliminated everything by now ? 2370555_2371635
&{l=READING do not use near streets near roadways near driveways or on sidewalks . 2371975_2377615
this product does not have brakes &}l=READING it's a piece of red plastic &{l=READING this product does not have brakes do not pull this sled using any motorized or non motorized vehicles &}l=READING how many vehicles does that leave ? 2378475_2389655
motorized and non &~m motorized they're out okay ? 2389855_2391475
if I were to buy this I would say to my child here here is a piece of red plastic put it on the carpet sit there and watch television . 2391825_2398325
&=laughs:multiple xxx with this thing okay . 2398625_2400265
there is a stepladder which I own which I took out last night to change a light bulb and because I was collecting these . 2400905_2407085
this is the label that's on my stepladder . 2407845_2409885
it has twenty one points of warning each with a little little bullet next to it some of which warn me about getting electrocuted about not placing the ladder in front of an unlocked door not balancing it tilted on a staircase . 2410105_2425265
&=laughs:multiple and my favorite one +"/. 2425865_2427185

I mean you want okay am I buff enough to change this light bulb ? 2430965_2433805
tell me I can climb on a stepladder that's how good I am okay I read this ladder I'm thinking like it's like the Three Stooges stepladder <it was ridiculous> it was ridiculous every step had a piece of this until they got to one twenty one okay why ? 2433835_2445235
why do we feel the need to tell parents that it is risky for them to believe that if they put the cape on <their child> their child &-uh will not have the power of flight so they better not let them jump out out the window ? 2445495_2456595
are we a nation of idiots ? 2456735_2457895
yes . 2458715_2458895

I found this example which is my favorite okay ? 2599245_2601985
about about using the language of risk and tapping into . 2602725_2605645
because you know you can't really put something on <on a> &~s on a stepladder that says +"/. 2605825_2609885

you_know that sort of thing . 2613025_2614185
but but the language of risk in terms of injury and illness is is a a is an acceptable way to be able to warn people . 2614465_2621425
it looks as if it's beneficent and also it carries a tremendous amount of of power and we can even use this to lie . 2621685_2628145

Victor Schwartz is a corporate lawyer whose job is to defend companies against product liability claims and this was his finest moment . 2631305_2640045
in the early nineteen eighties teenagers discovered lo and behold that they could get high by spraying one of his client's cleaning products into a plastic bag and inhaling the fumes fabulous discovery okay ? 2640605_2652265
the label on the can clearly warned that serious injury and death could result from inhaling the product but this carried very little sway with teenagers looking to get high as you might imagine . 2652705_2663805
and there were deaths and there was brain damage and there was all sorts of horrible stuff . 2664285_2667525
the company said to Mister_Schwartz we want to put an even bigger label on the can and he said don't put a bigger label on the can because if you put a bigger scarier label on the can then teeathers &~w teenagers will assume there's even more good stuff in the can now and &-uh <and they> and <they will> they will use it even even more . 2668005_2690265

&-uh how they look he said . 2704045_2706585
here's how we'll revise the label . 2707125_2709185
the new label says and this is a complete and utter lie &{l=READING warning inhaling can cause hair loss and facial disfigurement &}l=READING &=laughs:multiple it does not but they have not had a liability claim since that label went on the product . 2709705_2726485
and his clients are very happy and &~mish Mister_Schwartz's comment in this article I read was and that's why I'm paid three hundred and seventy dollars an hour &=laughs:multiple okay if you know the culture with which you are dealing you know how to do this now let me give you this . 2726825_2740365

when they say tobacco use do they mean like cancer caused by tobacco use or are they talking about . 3165745_3171185
heart disease too and they also mean probably ⌈ &-uh ⌉ . 3171225_3173565

let's see the garbage category of alcohol related I'm not gonna ask you to guess because we don't know what it means but it's second . 3187095_3191535
whatever it means it's a terrible thing and whatever it means a hundred and eight thousand people &-uh die of it now this is number one this is gonna be the highest number we have you can see &~tha that there's a vast gap afterwards of anything aside from of tobacco use and that does have to do with the fact that that tobacco use has so many different ways &-uh to kill you . 3192335_3213695

this where I got this from was consumer's union &-uh was trying to assess how well their employees a random sample of two hundred people who work for consumer's union now if you work for consumer's union you are like intimately involved with this four foot label on the piece of red plastic okay ? 3234265_3252325
so they asked these folks who were the heads of departments or something like that to to do this rank and this is where this is how close they got to the actual rank order so you'll see that as we go down . 3252815_3262335
okay . 3263255_3263275

right &~tha clearly risk <is not> &-uh is not distributed across a population . 3456245_3460565
and it's interesting to look at something like this &~a to look at this kind_of a chart and and do something just like this . 3460655_3466675
and &-um &~wh what &-uh the folks who did this survey found was that &~i <if they> if you ask people to describe &-um a chart like this and talk about risk <if we wanted to> talk about the risk of all these sorts of things people will construct their own very interesting narrative of risk having to do with which of these have something to do with them and which of these do not . 3467125_3491825

but &-um asking lung cancer patients who were smokers to describe for me what caused &~th what they thought caused their lung cancer was quite an interesting experience . 3517285_3529485
because I had &-um patients who had smoked three or four packs of cigarettes a day for fifty years describing the onset of their lung cancer this way . 3530185_3541025

xxx .
<to do> &~s to do it there ? 3783485_3784445
like xxx Keewatin xxx .
why ?
because &-um they really believe that that &-um no matter how much training you have what you really need is a hospital where you can do an emergency c@l section where you can have all the monitors and stuff like that and they really believed that it was important to get them out_of that environment and into a healthier environment . 3787275_3803715
they if if they had wanted to see what they could do to make it the most culturally appropriate thing for these folks they might have done that but their belief was that technology was the way to go . 3804295_3813555
even more so if they xxx +/. 3813835_3815235

the ways in which you can reinforce your power and status by by making this happen all over &-um is worth it &-uh to a_lot_of places but also don't don't underestimate &~th fact that they can then say that our infant mortality rates are are the best . 3833945_3849705
there's &~there there's a huge amount of of national prestige and also funding &-uh and that sort of thing that you get by changing your infant mortality ratings and &-um and if it costs more to make your numbers look better then that's what they <will do> . 3850075_3867075
mm .
it's like taking a Stanley Kaplan course that'll bring your your numbers up <on the> on the xxx . 3867615_3870615
and it's that's it's worth it it's &~wor you bump those numbers up it's worth paying that amount on on that one test . 3870875_3876195
it's worth paying those you know thousands of dollars to do it . 3876475_3878915
and it was very important for the government to look as if especially after they had had this &-um problem with lots and lots_of infant deaths &-uh from starvation they really were looking at these backward Indians were making Canada look like a backward country <in that way> xxx . 3879215_3891715
yeah . 3892715_3893915
sure I'll look forward to reading it . 3896375_3900395
would they have done the same thing for say an inner city urban ? 3900435_3906455
I wonder that's a very good question . 3907325_3908685
&-um I wonder if it'd be harder for them to do because it's &-um because what they were dealing with was a traditional sort_of folk practice versus modern medicine as opposed to &-uh people who were classified as underprivileged or deprived in some way . 3909425_3928825
&-um <it was> <it was> &~jus it was &-uh it was technology over native practice it didn't have to do so much with access to scarce resources in in a different sort of way . 3929385_3940245
