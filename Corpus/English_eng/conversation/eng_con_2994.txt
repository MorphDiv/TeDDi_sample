all right, facilitators, or team captains, if you have one, how did you all start ? 490_4370
we haven't started .
okay, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to call on someone else and then, you're going to re-explain how they got it . 8910_20710
okay, ready ? 21230_21250
um, S_two, how would you start ? 22850_23830
uh, so, finding X to the power of three ? 25065_28245
okay . 28605_28865
and then, I put X squared on top . 29585_32465
okay, why X squared on top ? 32965_34225
because X, um, times X squared equals X to the third power . 34285_39685
S_one, what did S_two just do ? 41225_45185
re-explain one more time . 59385_60485
listen carefully and put it in your own words . 60885_62405
so, I found X to the third power by putting X squared, because X times X to the +... 63605_69205
second power equals X to the third power . 69805_73165
how did she find this ? 73845_76405
give me one sentence of what you're thinking right now . 89835_91375
how did she find this X squared ? 91535_92195
right . 118515_118575
I'm going to come back . 118895_119735
we're going to check in one on one after . 120995_122015
it's okay . 122135_122335
we really wanna make sure you're understanding that, (be)cause that's one of the first steps that most people are taking here . 122655_127035
S_three, what did you do next ? 127655_128675
what else could you fill in in this box ? 129155_137155
um, does it matter which one ? 145355_147315
doesn't matter . 147415_147935
um +... 149735_150595
so, on top of the, the one right corner . 153935_155735
okay . 156435_156455
on top of it . 157295_158115
on top of this one ? 158355_159115
no, the middle . 159475_160315
yeah . 161115_161315
I want to make +... 161955_162715
with the negative two X . 163095_164095
negative two X . 164255_165015
and I'm really curious, how did you get negative two X here ? 166435_169395
um +...
I don't know . 182525_182665
okay . 183065_183245
do your team mates say something about how they found that negative two X ? 183845_187965
yeah, what I've got . 188365_190345
okay . 190805_191005
is there another piece that you all found, that would help us figure out why this is negative two X ? 191245_196525
xxx .
all right, we're going to come back . 199225_207865
we're going to fill in more pieces and make sure you've got an idea of where this negative two X is coming from . 208205_211585
S_four, give me another piece you filled in . 212145_214125
uh, two . 215345_216185
two ? 216705_216905
where ? 217085_217285
I mean +... 217725_218145
right, nevermind . 218785_219285
um .
uh, positive four ? 219485_222445
wh +...
and then, uh, bottom . 222905_225085
bottom, bottom where ? 225545_226645
right . 226945_227285
bottom right ? 227745_228185
yeah . 228365_228565
okay, so you've put four here . 228825_229825
how did you know that the four would go here ? 230325_232065
I thought xxx I got that number that xxx . 233445_243065
so, the number that goes at the end, you're talking about in the polynomial here +... 243445_248865
yeah . 249025_249045
okay . 249365_249525
so, I'm hearing you say, and I'm going to start color coding like we did yesterday, this last term, the constant of the number, is going in the bottom right, in each of these boxes that we're filling in . 249985_261065
okay ? 261595_261835
so, I'm seeing some color coding there . 262195_263875
S_four, I'm gonna push you again one more time, what else could you fill in now that you've got this piece here with the four ? 264635_271195
negative four ? 274915_276115
where ? 276455_276755
on the top right ? 277175_278515
negative four on the top right ? 278895_279975
how would you know that this negative four ? 280295_282055
I did a guess xxx . 283415_285575
what's the guess based on, like, why do you think that the negative four should be here ? 287125_290325
uh, I don't know . 291665_295425
okay, so he's thinking negative four here . 296805_298265
xxx coming to you . 299225_300225
agree or disagree ? 300345_301685
disagree . 302105_302425
why ? 303025_303245
because negative two times negative four is gonna make even four . 303785_307605
so, negative two +... 308645_309745
times negative four +... 310065_311225
times negative four +...
is not going to be equal . 311445_312205
okay . 312405_312605
so, what needs to be fixed ? 312965_314085
you need to put, um, negative two at the top . 314725_316925
negative two right here . 317265_318345
S_four, check in with you, do you agree with that ? 318985_322545
does negative two times two give us this four here ? 322625_325225
yeah . 325545_325705
why ? 327345_327645
because the two's, like, you just said it, negative times negative two would be . 328205_334945
cool . 335325_335945
I just want to make sure that you're hearing that it's multiplying, to get the outside and the inside . 336165_340145
um, S_six, give me one more piece . 341085_344045
about what ? 345025_346065
of any part of the box that you were able to fill in . 346545_349065
uh, X squared, uh, in the middle . 349805_351825
in the middle here ? 352705_353325
uh, in the middle, okay +... 353885_356245
you got X squared ? 356645_357365
how'd you get X squared ? 357825_359225
uh, I don't know, I just guessed . 360645_363385
total guess ? 364125_365245
yeah . 365425_365745
where's it coming from ? 365925_366565
is +...
okay, so that +... 369155_369975
I put an X on top of it . 370435_371735
okay . 372335_372375
where did this X come from ? 372775_375695
(Be)cause +... 376155_376575
so, you have X squared and then, adding the other X equals to the X cube . 377575_382315
I did it both ways . 383235_384815
say- say one more sentence . 385935_387135
you did what both ways ? 387195_388215
um, like, um, adding the X's . 388635_391055
I did it both ways . 391235_391995
so, you, like, took these two X's here and that's how you got +... 395105_399245
no .
sorry, go ahead . 399785_400525
so, so you have, uh, X squared, so adding it to the other X, would be X cubed . 401225_408205
that's what I did . 408845_409185
this one and this one ? 411565_412745
yep .
or this one and this one ? 413305_414525
yes . 414545_414805
I see . 415385_415765
okay . 415885_416065
sorry, I needed to really make sure I understood it . 416205_417825
um, so you're saying these two added together is how you got the X cubed ? 418425_421705
mm-hmm . 421885_422205
but, I heard earlier from S_two that this X times X squared is where we're getting the X cubed . 422585_428625
so, that's not exactly related . 429405_431965
I'm going to leave this here for now and see if we can make sure whether that makes sense . 432545_435985
S_seven, what else would you fill in ? 436665_438185
okay, so, the missing numbers are negative X sq +... 438925_445125
uh, squared ? 445125_446265
and where would that go ? 446505_447205
um, to the bottom +... 447745_449625
hold on one second, I want to +... 449885_451845
&=laughs bottom left . 451545_452365
bottom left ? 452545_453005
so, you said negative two X squared here ? 453085_454305
uh-huh and then, the last one is +... 454365_456585
wait, what ? 458565_458945
so +...
negative two X . 460325_461905
negative two X . 462685_463325
okay, and how did you know that these were negative two X squared and negative two X ? 464065_469585
so, n +... 469785_472025
um, negative two X, I mean, X squared times negative two, it will give you negative two X squared and then, negative two X, uh-huh and negative, I mean, negative two times X, it will give you negative two X . 471105_485385
yeah . 486065_486465
okay . 487005_487305
um, I'm going to summarize the patterns that we saw yesterday, just so that it's clear how these pieces fit together . 488345_496105
I heard a couple of mistakes, that I want to clarify right now . 496725_499945
so, like I said, when S_six was saying here, that this X squared, he has taken these two and adding them together, remember in our area models, the length times the width will equal the whole area inside . 500505_511925
so, this is being multiplied on the outside, to give us the inside . 512525_515765
all of these pieces added up together should give us the original polynomial . 516425_521785
right ? 522765_523365
so, I'm color coding each of the terms, so you remember in the diagram, as we see this diagonal pattern, that's how it's showing up in the polynomial . 556145_564545
who has questions about how that diagram should look ? 565985_570185
if you do not have that written down, you should definitely write it down now . 571425_578905
make sure you got a full example . 579345_580405
so, if I were to write this polynomial factored, it would be, like, X squared plus X minus two, times X minus two . 582105_590305
I'm going to give you all one minute in your teams to turn and talk and then, research managers, I want to hear from you in a minute very quickly, can I sketch a graph of this ? 601005_610565
could I graph this ? 611545_612505
all right, research managers, um, I did use all of the facilitators, so I'll guess any team . 613045_620485
S_eight, do you think we could sketch this graph ? 620985_623385
yes, because there's still an exponent . 624205_625585
yes, because there's still an exponent ? 626125_627605
so, how would I sketch it then ? 628005_629745
um, rewrite it . 630565_632925
okay, so, you're saying something about the exponent and you're saying, yes, we could, but you have to do something . 634225_646425
yeah, okay . 647305_649505
so, S_eight's noting something, noticing something about this, I would like someone else to build on that . 649985_655185
S_nine ?
so, S_eight just said this factor would have to do something . 658805_662345
can you explain a little more about that ? 662545_663685
um, so I think they can graph it, because it has the exit- X squared and you can factor . 667085_675985
so, because it has the X squared, we can factor this ? 676525_680245
yeah, so that's building on what xxx said . 680565_683225
we have the second factor here, where we could figure out the two other factors of that one . 684645_693785
so, this would be fully factored if we figure that out . 694205_696305
to S_eight's point, uh +... 697585_698945
we already did the first factor, but she was saying, if we just use a smaller box, if we wanted to, we could find the other two factors, like, S_nine just said . 704125_713925
so, we got that exponent, right, we know that we could still find more linear factors . 714585_718965
all right, when I say go +... 719925_723325
