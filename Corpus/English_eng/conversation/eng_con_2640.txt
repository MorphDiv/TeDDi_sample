Sandeep +/.

unfortunately I have a direct conflict usually during your meetings but I wanted to come in and say a couple weeks ago I had the opportunity to go to the &-um concentration advisings fair that you guys hosted and it was heaven to me . 175225_187605
because I'm a prelife student &-um not too sure what I'm gonna do yet and there's about four or five things I wanted to check out but it's been tough to set up appointments with four different people to discuss things and it was really easy to walk around and just say hey what's up ? 187875_202875
how're you doing ? 202995_203495
what about this ? 203755_204435
what about that ? 204515_205035
it was really cool . 205495_206235
&-um and there was a_lot_of positive feedback from my friends I got some guys in my hall to go &-um it was neat and &-uh I told some of the officers and stuff and some people that I see around but I wanted to tell everybody because I know all of you put some time into it I thought it was really cool . 206905_222825
in fact I'd recommend it twice a year like once each semester &-um the reason being is (be)cause as you take courses as a university student your interests vary and they develop and you might wanna just check it out one more time . 223285_234905
&-um I think you guys had pretty good attendance and like I didn't hear one negative thing and the best part was like all the people that were there giving advice from the different departments were just awesome people . 235385_245005
like they were into it they were excited and they were happy to be doing it so just wanted to say like keep it up and like hopefully we'll see one next semester too so . 245325_254545
thank you for the positive feedback . 254545_255665
it's always good to hear positive feedback . 256305_257645
John .
hi &-um I'm John Epstein I'm the &-uh chair of communications for MSA &-um turn really quick to the back of the agenda that you just got &-um I'm really proud of this this is a historic moment . 260945_273385
this is &-um as far as our records indicate this is the first resolution presented to the L_S_And_A student government on behalf of the Michigan Student Assembly committee . 273825_283385
&-um so that's I'm I'm proud of that I think that's pretty cool . 284165_286325
&-um the resolution is &-uh as you can probably tell by its title &-uh to sponsor a petition to improve the CCRB . 286585_293925
MSA took this on &-um couple weeks ago and &-uh Matt spoke to you about it last week and told you that we were gonna be doing this and told you that we were +//. 294285_303405
that that &-um that we were taking the CCRB on that we wanted to improve it this is the actual formal support . 304065_310125
&-um we'd like you guys to do this tonight . 311025_314285
reason being we have a meeting on Thursday with the director of the CCRB . 314905_318665
if we can take this resolution to him and say look students support it we have five hundred signatures on petitions we have a resolution unanimously passed by MSA we have a resolution passed by the L_S_And_A student government &-um and then just go down the list and and show him and show the administration that students think this is a big deal they will listen to us . 319465_339825
they will do the improvements . 339925_341265
and things'll get done . 341705_342345
&-um now I understand that you guys have a first and second reads process so do we . 342825_347885
and I don't wanna violate that process I think it's I think first and second reads are important &-um if you can pass this tonight cool great . 348485_356105
it's more important that it gets passed overall . 356985_359325
&-um this meeting on Thursday is not going to be the last meeting regarding improvements of the CCRB next week we're gonna start meeting with the provost we're gonna start meeting with the vice-president for &-uh student affairs and those meetings are to be honest more important than the meeting on Thursday . 359825_374925
if you pass this next week it will still be extremely useful to the improvement effort if you pass it this week it'll be even more useful but I don't want you guys to &-um &-uh split any hairs about it <I don't want> &-um I don't want it to be a major debate it's more important that this gets passed in general than that it gets passed tonight . 375585_394025
but if it does get passed tonight great . 394445_396145
&-um Matt Hackworth is the sponsor and &-uh for L_S_And_A SG and I assume he'll be talking about it a little bit &-um when you guys get to it . 396745_405645
we have to leave now to make the MSA meeting but are there any questions ? 405805_409085

&-um . 465505_469845
on the back &-um are the budget committee recommendations why don't you take a a second just to briefly look it over ? 466625_473305
(0.6) and if you have any questions &-um address them to Jim +/. 473945_482125
<who do I give this to> ?
+, Mister_Fattahippour (0.14) Lena .
Jim I just have question if you could explain to me why the Michigan Journal of Race and Law only got three hundred out_of a thousand ? 499525_504625
only got three hundred of a thousand ? 505645_507325
⌈ right ⌉ +/. 507585_507905
+, ⌊ is that what ⌋ &~y that was your question ? 508245_508785
yes . 508865_509125
&-uh the first reason that they didn't get a large majority of the money they asked for is because they're all law students and &-uh that might seem like absurd at first of a &~r sponsoring a law students kind of journal and to put on speaker events but the fact is a_lot_of L_S_And_A prelaw students attend them . 510025_529305
and they seemed like pretty well funded and a_lot_of the money they wanted was for travel but we weren't gonna fund them for having their speakers fly in round trip at &-uh six hundred dollars a ticket so we funded them for printing posters only . 530065_545985
and that three hundred dollars would cover that .
okay are there any other &~ques Shilpa ? 547425_554485
&-um I had a question about Encompass . 554825_556605
I understand that that's a it's a multicultural show being put on &-um during the time of Diversity Theme Semester . 557385_563965
and I was wondering &-um I mean I know of of different kinds of funding that Encompass has . 564365_570525
just because it is Diversity Theme Semester I was wondering why they were given eight hundred out_of a thousand as opposed to the IASA show a couple weeks ago that was only given two hundred ? 570725_579325
&-uh that's a good question and we like thought about that for a while and what it comes down to is that just like us sponsoring Dance Marathon last year it was a it was a like a takeoff of that it was like the first year you know +/. 580485_593385
mhm +/.
+, and it's the first year they're putting on Encompass and it's supposed to be a big deal and us sponsoring it with this amount of money would help really help it really get off its feet so that next year they could &-um find sponsors of their own and so forth . 593865_607545
like it's our investment now is gonna help them +//. 607895_610115
help it grow so that they won't need as much money from us in the future . 610355_612715
are there any other questions to Jim ? 613055_616575
I move to approve the affirmations . 617455_619355
okay is there a second ? 619935_620835
second . 621075_621395
are there any objections ? 621775_622475
okay nice job budget committee . 622995_624995
it seems to be running smoothly . 625215_626655

&-um are there any Ac ? 627535_631435
Ac is Academic Affairs Committee resolutions ? 631775_634395

okay &-um executive officer reports . 636135_638135
hm +...
last &~we &-uh last week &-um the visiting committee of L_S_And_A came and I decided I'm +//. 639795_649135
I was invited to speak in front of them . 649675_650955
and I just wanted to let you know what the visiting committee was . 651035_653175
the visiting committee is a group of very influential donors from L_S_And_A people who donate &-um millions and millions of dollars . 653595_658755
&-um some person donated the the Gail Morris Sweetland Center . 659115_662275
Mister_Sweetland was there himself . 662415_663515
&-um the CEO of Pagenet Motorola Activision the people with a_lot_of money who give a_lot_of money to L_S_And_A . 664045_672105
so they came on Thursday and they spent three days with &-um the dean and various other people in the dean's office . 672205_678405
&-um I made a presentation not about student government but about the dean's search committee in the morning and then I made another diversity presentation in the afternoon and I got to spend &-um time I I spent a_lot_of time with them and it looks like they're really interested in getting student involvement . 678925_693085
and what I arranged for next year hopefully is that student government members will be able to take around &-um the visiting committee members for a whole day &-um before they actually come . 693805_703785
so that's something you guys can look forward to next year is &-um meeting these really influential people and &~get hopefully giving them &~t letting them give us a_lot_of money so if you have any questions about that &-um let me know and I'll answer (th)em later . 704125_716825
I just wanted to kinda let you know what the VC was . 717225_719165
other than that &-um I have no report . 720145_723085

okay first thing was given to me today by &-uh MSA it's a project they're working on &-um in regards to the Code the Student Code it's a real nice packet what it does is it details what's going on to other schools what we have and the review process that's going on right now . 730275_747335
I'm gonna leave this in the office &-um so you can look at it &-um they haven't really asked for anything from us necessarily they're just trying to they're starting up kind_of like a grassroots &-um +... 747595_756655
I don't &~kn discussion on this there's already some other stuff going on and this is kind_of like all of it in the same folder so you can kinda get an idea if you're interested . 758605_764885
so this'll be in the office &-um if you're here and you don't have access to the office talk to me and we'll work out something if if you want to start getting in there to get to this information . 765105_773025
&-um the other thing &-uh I went to for I went to &-um the office space allocation meeting today at six thirty &-um we're just going through the process of setting up that office and everything . 773705_784705
I wanna make that a resource that you can use for for more than just studying so that <you can> you can get stuff done if you want there if there's nothing if &~th if there's something that should be there that's not there let me know so I can get it . 784805_796865

&-um number two theme semester funding . 962175_964875
&-um the reason I was asking Jim about the Encompass is because there's &-um a special there's a special &-um I guess fund set aside for groups who are programming for theme semester . 965705_977285
it's specifically set aside for them and the way it goes is it's a rolling budget allocation process and &-um the deadline is December fourth if you a guys have &~qu the deadline for that is &-um December fourth but if you have questions feel free to contact me . 977505_990725
it's basically first come first served so if you have an idea like Diversity Days if they wanted to apply or something like that for funding then it'd be a good idea to do so &-um <focus groups> focus groups are rolling around really well . 990955_1003895

okay the &-um red ribbon drive for drug awareness is this Thursday in the Diag between eleven and to two or whenever we run out_of ribbons . 1273345_1282845
&-um so far we probably have about mm twenty five hundred ribbons somewhere around there we're about halfway there so we still need a_lot_of help and we're having a meeting tomorrow night at eight o'clock in the Tap Room which is in the +//. 1283485_1295805
eight thirty +//. 1296465_1296825
which is in the Tap Room of the Union and we're gonna pass a sign+up sheet for you all to &-um sign up to come to the meeting tomorrow night . 1297015_1304055
we're gonna be putting just a bunch of ribbons together and also sticking the cards that we're gonna make up &-um with hotline information numbers &-um together with the pin and we're also gonna be sending around a sheet to help distribute the ribbons on Thursday . 1304415_1320275
&-um like I said we're gonna be distributing &-um between eleven and two we'll send out a sign+up sheet around &-um we want as many people as possible to help us distribute the ribbons not just because we have a_lot_of ribbons but the more people we have distributing them ribbons the more attention we draw to ourselves and therefore our cause . 1321025_1337545
so we'll send around the &~r ⌈ the sign up sheets ⌉ . 1338025_1339325
⌊ you said ⌋ eleven to two ? 1339325_1340305

oh and also &-um our meeting this week has been cancelled so you can scratch that off okay no meeting this week . 1346465_1352025
that's it .
&-um is Mister_Caster here ? 1352745_1357505
no Randy's not here ? 1357685_1358345
no .
okay . 1358465_1358625
&-um publications Lena ? 1359145_1360325
&-um I met with Annie who's the editor in chief of the Daily and the result is basically that &-um they can't do a special section because of the rules that they have in terms of &~d what Daily writers can write and what outside groups can write and how that can be put into the paper . 1360625_1376845
but what we're thinking about +//. 1377505_1378505
I'm thinking about doing &-um and I'll give you guys a proposal about it in a week or so is coming up with our own section but getting it inserted in the Daily that would be the same size as the weekend editions you know those filler sections &~th we could do (th)em on the newsprint in the same way . 1378745_1392185
&-um and so I'm I'm contacting the business managers and the people that deal with that kind of stuff at the Daily right now to see about how much it would cost and I'm also talking to people from MSA &-um to see how we can coordinate &~d this together with other students groups . 1392625_1407305
so &-um student governments . 1407685_1408805
so I should be able to get back with you in like by next week hopefully &-um with some more details on that . 1409365_1414185
that's good . 1415305_1415605
&-um elections of officers or chairs &-um we don't really have elections . 1416665_1420605
but I did wanna mention the new election director at this time . 1420845_1423545
&-um it is gonna be Beth Wiegand &-um &-uh so she'll she's not running in the election so she will &~no have no conflict of interest . 1424325_1432625
and that's it so if you have any questions and you're running she is the person to go to . 1433625_1439265
even though she doesn't know very much what she's gonna do right now . 1439945_1441825
do you ? 1441985_1442285
+, have you figured it out yet ? 1443105_1444265
no but +/. 1444465_1444745
okay +/.
+, it'll all come to me . 1445665_1445885
it'll &~al all come to her . 1446085_1446945
starting tomorrow . 1447105_1447525
okay . 1448105_1448365
there's no amendments to the constitution or bylaws &-um so we're gonna go to old business point A which is a special allocation proposal and I'm gonna hand this over to Tom . 1449125_1457245
okay . 1457585_1458205
so if you look on the back of the very end of the &-uh agenda titled special allocations proposal +... 1458965_1467685
I reworded it based on the suggestions I was given &-um and I went with the approach that has people that ask for more than a thousand dollars has them go through the budget allocations committee . 1468685_1478805
and then they come up with a recommendation for the next meeting or whenever they get around to it hopefully at the next meeting for us to &~d start with and then talk about the decision . 1479425_1488565
so let's say Dance Marathon came they would come and they would be directed to the budget allocations committee . 1488865_1493665
the Budget Allocations Committee would have them fill out a budget allocation form you know what expenses they have and that information . 1493985_1499765
they would hold an interview if they need to but they don't hafta and then at the next week's meeting the Budget Allocations Committee would come and say we recommend that we give them fifteen hundred dollars for Dance Marathon . 1500425_1510505
and they would be here to talk if &~th if Dance Marathon needed to talk to to add to to our discussion and answer questions . 1511125_1516525
it's it's basically what we've done before except it has them go through the budget allocations committee and <give us> give us more information &~t to decide on . 1517355_1525155
&-um hopefully that'll that'll &~st streamline the the discussion of what we should give (th)em so it it feels less &~ar arbitrary and we can go into it better informed and also we involve Budget Allocations Committee in this way . 1525955_1539575
&-um it's not in resolution form because this isn't a resolution . 1539995_1543875
&-um this is I I put this up so that we can vote to &~f to support this process this internal process so that when a group comes we kind of know what to do when they come so we don't just you know discuss and talk about the allocation that day . 1544505_1558445
&-um we don't hafta vote this on but I think <if we> if we modify this tweak it and then go by it we'll know what to do when a group comes . 1559085_1565885
&-um I don't think I'd I oh also I removed from the last resolution or the &~r last proposal I removed the part that said we will suspend parliamentary procedure for five minutes &-um just because well you can't really put that in a resolution . 1566345_1578225
if we're gonna do that we have to say let's suspend parliamentary procedure &-um actually we talked about it at steering we don't really need to to get rid of parliamentary procedure we can have a speakers list . 1578665_1587845
I just think if we had more discussion on what we might wanna give them before we make a resolution we'll avoid that problem that we run into when you know right in the beginning of the conversation someone says I move we give (th)em five hundred dollars and then we talk about amendments and and you know voting to call the amendments <and so on> and so on . 1588205_1603525
and so I I think we can streamline this &-um I throw this up for support &-um I guess we should have &-uh discussion and then for support or a vote what do you do ? 1603665_1613785
just a vote of support . 1613905_1614585
so &-um it's just a it's a we'll vote if they support it . 1614945_1618965

I have a question real quick +/. 1655945_1657085
shoot +/.
+, sorry &-um how does the deadline affect this proposal like the fact that that BAC closes their Budget Allocations Committee closes their &-um allocations process and they have an actual deadline if a group approaches us after the deadline then do we just say allocations are closed ? 1655965_1674325
or do we actually &-um ⌈ have them go through the process again ⌉ ? 1674545_1678065
⌊ is this for a recommendation ⌋ that's more than a thousand ? 1678065_1680165
yes +/.
+, less than a thousand ? 1680185_1680925
more than a thousand . 1681045_1681745
okay &-um it would go to the Budget Allocations Committee and if they determined that there's no reason that this could &~p couldn't (ha)ve gone through through the process of &~th +//. 1681915_1690095
actually no that's not true because all &~al allocations greater than a thousand come to us +/. 1690675_1694195
right +/.
+, don't they ? 1694595_1694795

⌊ of_course ⌋ of_course the Budget Allocations Committee can can look at all the information and say this group coulda gone through our process they don't necessarily need to ask for a thousand and one they could've asked for six hundred dollars +/. 1703225_1711285
okay +/.
+, and for that reason we recommend we give (th)em zero . 1711885_1714005
you know and they &~c they can inform our discussion but the &~all the deadline wouldn't apply to groups like that . 1714365_1718985
just just so you guys know this is not like something that we're advertising it's something for us to implicitly kind of agree on so when a person comes from the outside and asks for money this is &~w the what we're gonna follow . 1719145_1728505
so it's not like we're gonna advertise people coming to usurp the budget allocations &=laughs committee process at all . 1728585_1734365

okay &-um charitable donation point B . 1791325_1793125
I think Shilpa is taking this ? 1793425_1794625
yeah . 1795065_1795225
&-um if you guys remember it's just &-um basically this is gonna be a discussion on where we're giving +//. 1795745_1802425
which type of substance abuse program we are donating our charitable donation to . 1802685_1807085
&-um I did a little bit of research &-um and I found see I kind of added to Beth's research that she had done a couple weeks ago . 1807625_1816065
&-um and I've narrowed it down to &-uh at least in my opinion &-um to three different organizations that we could could possibly give our money to &-um and they're they're each of them differ in they +... 1816985_1831785
they differ in a few ways which are pretty important to to just talk about right now so I'm basically gonna describe the three different organizations and then open it up to discussion &-um which will be followed by +/. 1832835_1843395
a vote +/.
+, a vote . 1844115_1844335
&-um so the first one is called &-um Dawn Farm Sunrise Treatment Center which is the one that I I thought was it was Anita Bone's favorite one over at Project Serve and I thought it was a really cool program because first of all it's a coed facility . 1844875_1860075
&-um they don't accept anyone under seventeen so it would be targeting &-um people more our age than +//. 1860705_1866745
as opposed to adolescents . 1867205_1868205
it's a very long term program in the sense that &-um they they enforce the Twelve Step &{l=SIC Alcohols &}l=SIC Anonymous type thing there and &-um they have patient treatment . 1868985_1880385
&-um it's basically it's very personalized it's a walkthrough type of &-uh program and so it's it's a really great program &-um they are nonprofit and they don't receive any type of funding from the state or anything like that it's all on donation basis . 1881145_1895145
that they run their program . 1895545_1896345
&-um the second one is Ozone House which I'm sure a_lot_of you have heard of . 1897125_1900185
its &-um substance abuse program is more directed towards &-um adolescents and teenagers so eighteen and under . 1900745_1906685
&-um and then the third one is the Washtenaw Council on Alcoholism which is more of a more of a &~pol politically aware &-um group in the sense that it's funded by the state . 1907225_1918805
and it's &-um a_lot more general . 1919045_1920905
it's focused more towards adults and that sort of thing . 1921185_1924345
&-um I guess if there are any questions or if you guys would like to discuss this feel free now . 1924745_1931105
does anyone have any &~qu mm . 1931285_1932165
Lena &=laughs .
I was just wondering &-um you said that the Washtenaw Council one was funded by the state so is there a need for funding ? 1934325_1940245
like what would our money go towards ? 1941065_1942525
what .
⌈ would these ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that's that's ⌋ kind of what my worry was with that one is just because &~i I don't see a real need there it was just a +//. 1944065_1950045
it was a different type of organization that I thought I would mention . 1950145_1952345
our money would just go into the general pool along with all the other donations it wouldn't be directed to one specific thing . 1952925_1958605
like we couldn't say we want this money to go towards like a program for teenagers or something like that . 1958565_1963945
⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ Beth and then ⌋ Matt .
&-um I was just gonna say quickly that when I went to Project Serve Anita Bone who is the head of all of Serve &-um we talked about Dawn's Farm a_lot . 1964485_1974585
and I really like that one too because I just thought you guys it would be important to know that she knows the director personally and she knows that they go yearly from like that budget to the next budget so &~th it's a very tight thing . 1974725_1984565
and and our money unlike if we gave it to the Washtenaw Council you can tell which one I'm for +/. 1984825_1988505

do you officially recommend the first one the farm one ? 1998765_2001805

&-um new business &-um Student Mediation Services is not here and they're coming two weeks from now &-um so we'll go down to point B which is &-um +//. 2189025_2196825
the U_Of_M for Life resolution and Jerry so this &~w you can speak to it ? 2196945_2201645
okay &-um these are this is the resolution like here that I wrote up &-um and this is the general information sheet that I'm gonna pass out I only made like I think fifteen copies of each so you may not get one of both . 2201865_2213245
but &-um basically &-um what this is is you guys have heard me talk about it before . 2213945_2219105
&-um it's an event that's gonna happen on Palmer Field the CCRB and a coffee shop that's gonna take place August tenth of this Winter Term . 2219965_2227685
and the focus is to raise money for the National Childhood Cancer Foundation which is a nonprofit &-um organization that &-um <has various> &-um supports various research institutes and treatment centers in the United States such as &-um u@l of M's own Mott's Hospital &-um one at University of Chicago one at North Carolina UNC Chapel Hill and so forth like that . 2228305_2252785
and &-um basically the student group Focus for the Future is &~im is implementing they're the host and as &-um a representative or a liaison for that student group &-um I wanted to get &-um L_S_And_A Student Government's support and just simply endorsing the event and supporting its purpose . 2253265_2272205
and pretty much how we're gonna raise the money is through sponsorship and &-um student just regular students who wanna donate any money the information sheet that I handed out has been changed a little bit because &-um it's on a voluntary donation basis so five to ten dollars isn't really five to ten dollars it's just whatever you can give . 2273025_2293445
the suggested &-um donation was three dollars and there also is a coffee shop and we're just trying to make it as fun as possible so it's gonna be really good too . 2293505_2304985
it's gonna be it's coming along really well and we just wanted to get your support . 2305385_2309625
and straying from the typical let's just pass this over for first reads and discuss on second reads we're actually gonna discuss at this time so we can kind_of streamline it for next time . 2310325_2318365
so if you guys have any questions &-um ask Jerry now . 2318805_2323325
hm ?
Matt .
&-um I have a question . 2323065_2324145
on the &-um agenda it says U_Of_M for Life is that . 2324565_2328325

the the name <of the> of the student group is Focus for the Future . 2329385_2332465

Usha ?
so exactly like what would L_S_And_A do ? 2353735_2357675
we just endorse it ? 2357935_2359095
⌈ or ⌉ . 2359255_2359395
⌊ well ⌋ right now like it's still going through &-um it's finishing up &-um it's gone through the Athletic Department I have a &~m meeting this Thursday with Warde Manuel and he and I have been working together kind of and &~h we're gonna go over the final logistics part as far as the Athletic Department's concerned . 2359495_2376515
if the Athletic Department they they may endorse it they may not (be)cause they have logistics with the NCAA that they have to worry about so . 2376985_2383745
I'm looking pessimistically &-um it's still gonna happen even if they don't endorse it because the athletes will still there's still &~ath a &~ver a_lot_of athletic interest in doing it and so basically it's I mean it's it's +//. 2384305_2398545
we need your support just to say you know what this is something that L_S_And_A SG would like to happen like to see happen and also we support the purpose which I put in the resolution as &{l=READING raise money for the <international NCCF> . 2398645_2411765
&}l=READING and <so forth> so forth and also &-um we're not gonna ask you for money like this term but I mean like money is kind_of an issue so I mean I wouldn't be surprised if I +//. 2412405_2424525
&~we we went through the process of asking for some money next term but I'm not gonna even talk about that now . 2424825_2429345
so . 2429865_2429925
yes . 2430605_2430645
I just have a quick question &-um if you look at the resolution &-um the second point says &{l=READING whereas the University of Michigan's Challenge for the Children that was created to &}l=READING and then the point the third point is &{l=READING build the community of Ann Arbor . 2431245_2443225
&}l=READING and I +/. 2443665_2443785
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ didn't ⌋ what do you mean ? 2443945_2444805
okay well basically what we're the reason why I said build the community of Ann Arbor it's because our sponsorships we're looking for both like local and somewhat national . 2445195_2453595
like our right now our main &-um sponsorships we're trying to advocate for are like let's say Pizza House &-uh like Cava Java like what_have_you things just in the Ann Arbor that everybody knows like where Pizza House is and so forth like that . 2454275_2468235
We're also trying to get like national sponsors such as like like a KMart or like a Meijer or something like that (be)cause the the main point is to raise as much money as we can . 2468655_2477495
and like we have nothing to lose by asking like KMart for money if they wanna donate it . 2478015_2482355
&=laughs I mean the worst thing they can say is no . 2482775_2484315
and then they have to like live with the point that they're not helping the children . 2484475_2488115
&=laughs:multiple so that's not my issue . 2488855_2490755
but that's why it's +/. 2491175_2493215

but so there's another one and I can hand that out next week but basically the only thing that the only the resolution is the one is the little fine print one that is kind_of messed up (be)cause &~th something happened in the printing . 2525825_2537665

and that's the only reason why I didn't do it as a part of the Government . 2562835_2565035

&-uh okay . 2679595_2680695
&-um oh . 2681095_2682195
&-um it's the resolution that &-um John Epstein was talking about on <the back of your> &-um the back of your agendas . 2683505_2691625
&=clears_throat excuse_me .
&-um what it is is eh &-uh John John pretty much went over it . 2692325_2697585
they're going to around to various administrative people and asking to &-um generally make improvements in the CCRB of which they're taking suggestions . 2698065_2708245
&-um it's very vague right now because they're not exactly sure without talking to the people from the CCRB which is what they're doing at the end of this week &-um &~w how much &~wha which changes they can make . 2708785_2721625
&-um so this is basically just us supporting MSA's effort &-um to make &~alt alterations in the CCRB . 2722005_2731085
&-um they're asking us to pass it &-um on first reads if that is okay &-um ⌈ I know that yeah ⌉ . 2731945_2740065
⌊ to waive first to ⌋ waive first reads . 2740105_2740725
to waive first reads and pass it today . 2740805_2743025
&-um can I get an informal opinion on how many people find that okay and how many people are against that before (be)cause &-uh as John said like if there's a_lot_of &-um dissension about doing that <we can> we can just not worry about it but &-uh . 2742945_2760885
&~c can I make a comment ? 2762305_2762925
yeah . 2763205_2763425
okay <I would> I would &~s not necessarily for the resolution but I would probably vote not to bypass first reads because I think first reads are important because usually that's the first time anybody's seen anything but because this isn't such a life &~sh changing resolution +/. 2763515_2778575
+, but just in general I &~don I don't think it's good precedent to waive first reads . 2779795_2783895

⌈ let's ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that's ⌋ my only point . 2785015_2785515
let's just take an informal vote of how many people &-um just kind_of out_of Parli_Pro whatever it doesn't matter take an informal vote of how many people would be willing to bypass first reads ? 2785685_2795165
how many people would be opposed ? 2796645_2798025
okay it looks like Matt you're gonna get a_lot_of dissension on that . 2799165_2801265
okay . 2801725_2801765
so we'll just go ahead and &-uh look &~ov look it over and &-um if you have any any changes that you wanna make come to me and we can &-um go ahead and discuss at the passage next week then . 2802145_2812125
does anyone have any questions about the content and not necessarily the wording ? 2812115_2815515
Matt .
oh . 2816455_2816975
(be)cause like the wording can be fixed outside of the government time unless it's gonna infringe too much on . 2817615_2824055
&-um I have to just because just before he was leaving he &-um told me that he wanted to change the second to last paragraph . 2824675_2831235
okay . 2831895_2831935
&-um because there was already some talk about us not wanting to actively encourage the administration on this . 2832055_2837175
&-um so he suggested this wording change and I wrote it down and I'll say it now . 2837625_2841385
&{l=READING therefore be it resolved that the LSA Student Government supports the MSA effort to encourage the University of Michigan administration to improve its &}l=READING and then so on . 2842125_2852165
so it's instead of us &-uh actively encouraging the administration it's us &~en it's it's us supporting MSA's effort to encourage the administration . 2852985_2860965
I'll reread that if ⌈ do you need me to &~re do you ⌉ ? 2862425_2865905

we didn't ?
whatever &=laughs:S18 . 2984105_2984825
yeah Parli_Pro ⌊ whew ⌋ .
⌈ whatever ⌉ .
⌊ we ⌋ suspended . 2985505_2987065
the discussion .
okay &-um parliamentary procedure . 2989375_2991475
&=laughs:SUm Matt would you wanna take this over ? 2992495_2994075
sure &-um in response to to what's been happening in the last few meetings and in response to some comments that have been heard from constituents and representatives both . 2994755_3005395
I'm gonna pass around this little informational sheet which is something like the one that &-uh Mister_Randall gave us earlier in the year what it is basically is a primer for the discussion that will hopefully be ensuing from our new council which is supposedly coming down the pipe . 3005765_3020365
&-um so I don't wanna step on any toes and &-er take up too much time talking about parliamentary procedure but hopefully everyone'll look this over &-um and think about it . 3020945_3030945
and hopefully when we get a new council they can pass us something that's a little more &-uh complete as far as Robert's Rules go . 3031905_3038945
I mean it it is a whole book so I don't think we're gonna get a copy of the book for each of us . 3039105_3043085
but &-um if we all become more familiar with the types of motions the types of main motions that are allowed and the order in which things are considered then things'll in my opinion run much more efficiently and much more quickly than they are when people are kind_of &-uh sounding off about their personal feelings on an issue in successive order not relating to any particular point and not addressing any previous arguments . 3043545_3068665
so &-um a couple things I'd like to call attention to is &-uh specifically this first point here is something that people seem to be having a_lot not &~ev if I shouldn't say that people are having a_lot_of trouble with but it's a very important point that +... 3069345_3085305
matters of a lower rank are considered first in other words the most +... 3087425_3092725
&~l the lowest order of amendment is considered first the example given here is <the amendment> the amendment must be disposed of before the amendment can be voted on and the amendment must be disposed of before the motion can be voted on . 3095705_3110485
that that's a pretty important point and lots_of time we get off track talking about the motion when we're supposed to be talking about the amendment . 3111425_3117945
so in the interest of not stepping on anyone's toes I'm going to end this discussion now . 3118525_3122465
okay . 3123675_3123815
in response to some of what our constituents have &-um emailed both to Tom and I &-um we're gonna try to become &-um a more well informed government on parliamentary procedure &-um when we have when it's not running &-um effectively people seem to be lost and so we're trying to make this all a more effective so everyone's kind_of on the same page . 3123815_3144435
and like anything it's a learning process I'm not gonna say that I'm fluent with Parli_Pro (be)cause that's not even that's not even close to true so &-um just let's use the next couple of meetings to really practice &-um doing Parli_Pro and when we have a council it'll be a_lot better . 3144985_3160325
but &-um just bear with us and &-um we're learning as you guys are learning too so . 3160885_3165125
one final point in relation to parliamentary procedure if you look on the bottom of the back of the sheet it says that &-um you can utilize SAL services this little sheet was produced by SAL so if you wanna go to &-um the student leadership people and go through one of their seminars you can always do that . 3166145_3183005
okay thank you &-um hopefully we'll try to get an SAL person in here to help us with Parli_Pro too . 3183565_3189745
mhm +/.
+, eventually . 3190045_3190345
okay &-um &~po point seventeen E the ITD discussion &-um this is also Matt Lane . 3191275_3196035
okay now I've got another handout to pass around and &-um this one here this fun little item is a copy of a proposal that was presented by the Provost to the regents that was the impetus as far as I understand for the thirty dollar a person or an allocated student fee that we were assessed this year to improve the information technology environment of the college . 3196795_3223155
&-uh ITD actually has nothing to do with this committee . 3223865_3226765
&-um in fact one of the key issues of the committee is how to stay away from ITD's business and how to tailor the money &~w that will hopefully be spent on behalf of the students away from the activities that ITD or the services that ITD is providing for the students because the fear is if &-um as a college we do anything to supplement ITD's services they may pull back from the services they're already providing . 3227265_3256565
so the autonomy of ITD is something of a problem as far as improving the &~i technology environment <of the> of the campus but that's a completely separate matter &-uh the name of the committee incidentally for for further budget &-er for further agenda purposes is the LSA Informational Technology Committee +... 3256905_3275505
&-um we will be meeting next Monday again with Mike McPherson and the rest of the committee Ladizwana and I and &-uh we will be discussing some further issues as far as &-uh what sort of response the committee has been getting back from a letter they sent out to all the department chairs . 3277385_3294125
&-uh the strategy that the committee has been taking to dispose of this one point one million dollars is to write letters to all the committee chairs and ask them what they think as far as how the money could be best spent . 3294745_3309065
and we haven't gotten any response from that yet &-uh so obviously the committee is in its very early stages . 3309605_3315145
next Tuesday we're going to have Mike McPherson here to speak with us so &-um after I answer Jerry's question I can talk about some of the main issues . 3315795_3323355
oh I'm sorry . 3324055_3324555
I I didn't know you weren't done . 3324855_3325615
go ahead . 3325895_3326495
no please &~an ask the question . 3326755_3327635
no I was gonna I'll wait (un)til you're finished . 3327715_3329155
oh okay . 3329215_3329515
&-um as far as some of the main issues that are in front of the committee some some questions that we might be able to tailor for Mister_McPherson who is being kind enough to come and visit us next Tuesday &-um the key issue is the student labs . 3329785_3345005
we have all these student labs in all the departments and some of them are fostered through the department for instance in the political science department the lab is completely taken care of by the political science department and the college has nothing to do with it so that's not under our purview . 3345065_3358325
it says here there are currently ten structural computing labs and it lists where they are and how much it's &~cos costing to upgrade them on a thirty year cycle so that that is a big issue in <in the> in the committee if we buy all these wonderful things how much is it gonna cost to keep replacing them and keep &-uh insuring that they're continually wonderful &-uh &=laughs . 3358665_3379825
the only group so far that we've spoken with is the Language Resource Center and Monika Dressler the director of that center has all sorts of wonderful ideas for our money as far as putting in &-um new software that &~a allows text in foreign languages &-uh at all the computing sites which I think is a pretty solid idea &-uh as far as cost benefit goes . 3381185_3402745
&-uh and lots_of the things overlap for instance the LRC the Language Resource Center wants to hire more technical support staff to support the students and the priority the key priority of the committee is to make sure that all the money is spent in the most most direct impact for the students and the key issue is is how direct does this impact hafta be ? 3403585_3430285
how direct does it hafta be for the college to spend their money on it ? 3430505_3432845
and I assume that the +//. 3433565_3435645
&~tha that's what our questions to Mister_McPherson will revolve around &-uh is teaching is training the teachers or training the instructors in these new methods like PowerPoint and other new software worth our money ? 3436045_3449125
is that a direct enough impact on the students ? 3449285_3450885
or or is hiring technical support staff to help students &-um or to help faculty do their business is that direct enough ? 3451025_3461765
is computers direct enough ? 3462645_3463525
is computer on faculty desks direct enough ? 3463605_3465445
&-um it's sort_of a difficult thing to talk about when we're at the early stage we're at seeing as we don't have any formal proposals . 3466465_3473685
and seeing as the administration is against us having formal proposals and against the committee &-um ruling on formal proposals because they want to reserve that formalized process to their own decision making bodies . 3473945_3491285
so that that could be another point of interest to Mister_McPherson . 3492165_3496925
&-um I should also add that in addition to the one point one million dollars that we're all kicking in as individuals at thirty dollars a pop the Provost has also agreed to kick in six hundred and sixty thousand dollars . 3497105_3509305
and curiously enough that that pretty much just covers the proposal here as it's written . 3509785_3515685
&-um so I just encourage everyone to take a look at these things and think about you know how how how useful is a PowerPoint lecture compared to the the traditional lecture ? 3516985_3530845
is that worth us spending our money on ? 3531125_3532765
what sort of new computer technology do we want in the labs or &~d would we rather spend that money on making sure our teachers are confident enough to utilize this technology because these new methods of teaching are so powerful ? 3532915_3545975
&-um I think it's sort_of up in the air and I have my own particular leanings on it and as I said before if anyone has something to say to myself or Lena about how you'd like us to represent the college in the community ? 3546895_3558815
or in the committee +//. 3559315_3559755
please please say that to us but you'll have an opportunity next week to to say it directly to the man who's really in charge . 3560785_3566365
okay Jerry .
&-uh my question is this &-um how much like right now did you like take a survey or something to see like (be)cause I think that one of the things is &~w how many student actually participate in the like <in the> in the programs that are sponsored like for PowerPoint and for Excel whatever have you ? 3567525_3585805
like how many students like tend to show up to those ? 3586125_3588225
can you take a survey of that or if you +//. 3588385_3590325
do you have general foundation of that ? 3590605_3591945
(be)cause I think a_lot_of this would be based on what is currently happening at the university I know myself I see I'll see a sign that says PowerPoint I'm like I know how to use it I'm not gonna go . 3592085_3602485
and then that's just me though . 3603005_3604125
maybe other people are like would be like oh I don't know I'd like to learn but I think that xxx the original idea in what the students want (be)cause I don't see what would would it what would help if you were trying to improve the teaching if kids or if students weren't even trying to like get that learning . 3604165_3619925
right . 3620925_3621345
well the <the whole> the whole story about &~Pow PowerPoint it should be teach our teachers to learn this . 3621545_3627825
is it a powerful enough instructional tool that we should spend this money to teach our teachers how to use it ? 3628085_3632745
or is it not as powerful &~a as an instructional &{l=SIC toor &}l=SIC tool +//. 3633225_3637485
or as a learning tool that maybe some more advanced software in in Angell Hall might be ? 3637645_3641725
okay . 3642125_3642165
&-um so it's all a matter of where to spend the money &-um should we spend it on support staff ? 3642765_3646845
should we spend it on training the faculty ? 3646985_3647945
should we spend it on putting computers on faculty desks ? 3648085_3650745
I would say definitely not in that last instance I mean to me that's really a progression of getting further and further away from a direct impact on students . 3650905_3658505
and the question is where is that edge ? 3658965_3661785
where is the dropoff so to speak as as far as &~w when spending becomes too indirect to be using our money on it ? 3661985_3670965
and I think one thing that we really should seek to pin down Mister_McPherson on is +... 3671025_3676765
will the six hundred and sixty thousand dollars that the Provost kicked in be subject to the same priority restrictions that the money that is &~re drawn from the student thirty dollar fee is ? 3679655_3692415
&-um so (be)cause I think that the administration sees the six hundred and sixty thousand dollar kick in as you know their form of play money that they can shuffle around in that budget however they want . 3692955_3704115
&-um so well I think we'll have some interesting things to talk to these people about . 3704685_3709565
and hopefully we'll have some informative questions . 3709825_3711845
hopefully you'll take a look at this and do some thinking about what would &~i improve the environment in your classes or you know maybe you can ask some people . 3712165_3721905
I I don't really know what sort of regime you can employ to take a survey . 3722125_3725405
&-um in fact &~i it's interesting that most students don't even know that they were assessed a thirty dollar fee &=laughs so . 3726185_3731605
okay &-um as I said next week &-um Mike McPherson's coming &-um so I am &~g I'm gonna put this in Matt's lap so if you guys have any questions that you wanna generate that you wanna ask Tim &-um ahead of time &-um email them to Matt . 3734415_3748875
right and &~al and also Lena and I are meeting again with the committee on Monday morning so we'll have a_lot more to say hopefully after Monday . 3749675_3758055
and maybe we can get together and put out some sort of informational email that'll give you all some ideas of of how the process is moving along and what sort of responses what sort of proposals we're getting so that might be able to guide your questions a little bit . 3758145_3769845
okay .
thank you &~t for taking that on . 3772165_3773825
okay . 3774565_3774905
