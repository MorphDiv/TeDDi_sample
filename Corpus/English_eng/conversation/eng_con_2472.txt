&=breath <I think if> uh@fp yeah, so would happen if the

&=smack let us do some mistakes, &=breath like uh@fp flying
&=breath and we won't complain too much . 237300_256560
don@i don't you think <they c@i> they are capable of
yeah . 248970_249540
what do you mean ? 257040_257900
I mean, that them the FAA, the pilot, they know that
&=breath or , hes@fp they are asked &=throat asked to do

you mean, uh@fp ask for more pay ? 281070_283170
the income . 281890_282630
yeah . 283070_283480
hm@fp . 283660_283990

right . 289580_289910
yeah . 292090_296680

they are not +//. 292400_293040
right . 295830_296260

&=laugh . 305620_310730
right . 309000_312740
&=smack tha@i tha@i that they're right, though . 309000_312740
it has gotta be tremendously expensive . 309000_312740
I wonder what the average salary of a pilot is . 313980_317600
I have no idea . 313980_317600
it has gotta be quite a bit, it is a stressful high risk job,
&=breath . 316830_321460
yeah . 319900_320590
well well, of course the airlines would say, you know, the
I don't think it is not so high as you would expect . 321430_328840
I I know it for Lufthansa just, but I was disappointed
well, Lufthansa xxx like the the &=throat the least
&=laugh . 327540_328020
right, but you know many of these people flew jets in the army or

in Air_France ? 335550_336260
yeah . 336350_336900
yeah . 336400_336870
and and US American_Airlines pay a lot, too, I think . 336980_340110
huh . 340220_340710
mhm . 340270_340640
yeah . 340680_352770
so, I was disappointed about the Lufthansa thing, I thought they
&=breath but they have just hundred thousands, around . 340680_352770
&=breath which is not so much if you would +//. 340680_352770
xxx +//. 341220_342060
they just keep striking . 342110_343060
yeah . 347680_348290
right . 349740_350140
yeah . 353060_353750
but they're really on the low side . 354620_356470
&=throat . 354620_356470
well it depends, do they have a lot of advantage <on the> on
do +//. 354680_359500
&=laugh hey, translate it . 355420_356630
yeah, maybe . 356180_357370
they have a lot of d@i advantages ? 358900_360130
do they have that, a lot of advantages ? 360200_364210
as &=breath free vacation ? 360200_364210
I don't think that it is so much different to other air co@i . 363790_374690
hes@fp <if airlines state they can> all the relatives can

that is sweet . 371410_372060
well, yeah . 374930_377480
at least for Air_France it is . 374930_377480
I don't know the rest . 374930_377480

it is a very productive three and a half hours, but you know
&=laugh . 665700_666520
&=laugh so, &=breath that reminded me <of those little>
like &=breath this one last week it was about how there are germs
&=breath like everything you touch has horrible germs on it . 666280_705540
it is like well yeah . 666280_705540
&=breath and they show these like &=breath big close+ups of

&=laugh . 720790_721250
yeah . 724590_724990
I think I saw something on Sixty_Minutes where they &=breath

&=laugh . 743790_747310
&=laugh . 746730_747660
but it is something very exclusive . 747000_758920
and I think some couple of hundred people in the world do this,

mhm . 751340_752230
yeah . 754040_756130
and I think +//. 754040_756130

&=laugh . 898280_899590
yeah . 907040_916660
I actually was wondering about that, that was like the most
<is it just a> no ? 907040_916660
is it just a person sitting there typing it ? 907040_916660
no, no . 914360_920080
<they have a@i> hes@fp they are very high paid, very high
&=laugh . 914360_920080
somebody does it . 915810_916870
it is a person typing it . 918720_923160
not in real+time, <you ca@i> is it that fast ? 918720_923160
it is almost . 918720_923160
right . 919040_919660
&=laugh . 919040_919660
&=laugh . 919520_920010
<it is> i@i it is like a couple seconds behind real+time

Sixty_Minutes isn't live, but they just need it that fast . 923920_929650
huh . 923920_929650
right, but that doesn't seem to matter . 927060_934350
<because they're not working> the transcriptionists aren't
for NBC, or the local station ? 933750_935360
yeah, and there is tremendous amounts of error, <if you ever read>
oh . 935810_936560
yeah . 938560_939410
there was a bunch of typos in that one just then . 938960_940960
yeah . 939100_939650
yeah . 940270_943380
were there ? 940270_943380
I wasn't reading it . 940270_943380
I usually do . 940270_943380
yeah . 940430_940850
and some short shortcuts I saw, like &=breath swing was S O

sug@n . 946470_948280

so, you have to know that too . 949990_953190
&=breath yeah, it is kind of interesting, uh+huh . 949990_953190
but these people uh@fp hes@fp they they use very specialized
hes@fp it is almost like a stenography machine rather than a

is it ? 959270_960170
but it is not a Qwerty ? 961950_965280
there is another one that is y@i I can't think of what it is
