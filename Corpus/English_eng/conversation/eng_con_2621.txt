in &-uh your interest I'd like to mention that we are in fact &-uh &-uh quite a bit ahead of our schedule &-uh that means one or the other either you could talk more and &-uh slow us down &=laughs:multiple or or by your silence you might go home a little earlier tomorrow and I'm not offering anything particularly .
&=laughs:multiple &-um sometime before you go though here are the &-um certificates .
&-uh some companies like to know that you actually were here &=laughs:multiple and &-uh so there's an +//.
there's one for everybody .
and &-uh &-uh I signed them as &-uh the verification indeed that you were good boys and all that sort of thing .
so there it is .
pick one .
it's not quite like you_know we have +//.
&-uh you_know up the road there's a place called Michigan State University and &-uh every now and then around campus here you find &-uh you_know rolls of toilet paper .
you_know a little sign above +"/.
+" &-uh MSU diplomas take one .
&=laughs:multiple .
you you mean you're gonna pass those out before Friday ?
&=laughs:multiple .
yeah yeah .
<I see> .
well one of the things I &-um &-uh did not cover or &-uh zipped by on Monday morning is the matter of the literature .
&-uh I postponed that &-uh to the point &-uh where &-um I I've heard questions &-uh now from quite a number of people where do you find information on this or that ?
I've got a product that's not working so well how do I know &-uh what materials work better than the ones we've got right now .
well &-um we don't know .
and &-uh there again you kinda wonder if &-uh you_know if &-uh if if I've really been &-uh diligent in these forty years why don't I know ?
&-uh it's because the subject I say isn't so complicated but you know when you're looking for a &~w &-uh &-uh a solution to a problem and you're looking perhaps for a different material or a different lubricant &-um you you you expect that there may be one out there now can you trace can you go back in your mind as to why you expect that there's a solution laying out there somewhere .
hm +..?
well isn't it because &-uh very often we have things that break and the answer to things that break is to find a stronger material .
simple hm a good connection there ?
or we've got a material that &-um &-uh that fatigues or buy a material that doesn't fatigue as as as readily you know that sort of thing .
&-uh or you might get into certain nuances you know relating to residual stresses so forth and so forth you know that the majority of us are are are well steeped in mechanics aren't we ?
and in mechanics or the mechanics ethic leads us to to suppose that &-uh there are materials out there that satisfy a need but now &=background_noise how do we measure how well a need can be satisfied by a different material well we've got equations huh +..?
&=door_closed and &-uh so perhaps you hope thereby that in wear there is a direct equivalent .
that there are equations on wear .
now you asked earlier about what material does which to .
&-uh I haven't the foggiest idea .
because I don't know whether your present product is tweaking a fatigue mechanism or an oxidation mechanism you see or a corrosion mechanism or what &-uh &-um what the present problem is and so I have no idea which way to turn .
and &-uh that's disappointing , that's discouraging , that's disconcerting &-uh disconcerting &~f to &-uh &-uh for managers .
you_know &-uh managers have &-um I think well an urgency to get something done .
and &-uh there comes this wear crowd they never have the answers you_know .
or they're likely to say +"/.
+" well give us two hundred thousand dollars .
+" we'll research it for you and &-uh &-uh we you_know we'll we'll call on you .
+" don't call on us in three years .
and &-uh so on .
&-uh along that line &-uh at this Gordon conference I was just &-uh &-uh &-uh mentioned I mentioned a couple times the Gordon conference out in New Hampshire &-uh the first paper was delivered by &-uh a &-uh a man &-uh a savvy designer who works for a diesel engine manufacturer in Columbus Indiana and I won't reveal the name of the company well &~Cumm you know Cummins .
&=laughs:multiple and &-uh &-um he wrote of his frustrations as a designer of diesel engines in a successful industry and among other things &-um he hadta say or he did say that he doesn't know which way to turn .
&-uh he can't of_course go down the street to Peoria and ask certain questions of those fine folks down there &=laughs or the people of generous motors or any of the other manufacturers &-uh of &-uh diesel engines for good reason then where do they go ?
he says <in this> in this talk he doesn't trust universities &-uh because they &-uh you_know just don't deliver &-uh he doesn't trust the literature they don't deliver or the literature the articles just don't describe anything close to his problem .
and &-uh this is &-uh very true I must say that at the at that Gordon conference about a hundred and ten people attended thirty three were from industry &-uh the rest were from &-uh universities and government +...
there was quite a stir after this paper one professor of another university said to me I've never been so insulted in all my life .
&=laughs:multiple well now why was he insulted ?
because &-uh this man at Cummins &-uh did not state his problem to that professor .
well it is a bit of an arrogant sort of attitude you know and I mean the idea there then if you tell me your problem I'll be able to solve it hm ?
and &-um I'm one to tell you that &-uh that doesn't work .
&-uh I cannot solve problems immediately at all really &-um your problems are +//.
have already been picked over and all the easy solutions have been done right ?
and what there's left is &-uh &-uh several paths several alternatives .
now how do we proceed down &-uh to pick an alternative ?
well that requires a_lot_of discussion .
now you can call in a consultant but that consultant doesn't know the problem .
so you've got to educate the consultant and that was the Cummins' man complaint .
I first educate the consultant then he goes off and helps Caterpillar make better products .
&=laughs:multiple &-uh okay (o)kay .
what's wrong with that ?
&=laughs:multiple .
from his point of view yeah .
&=laughs:multiple .
&-uh and &-uh so you know one &~aga one &-uh &-uh again &-um &-uh expects a relationship with a consultant just like you would <with &-uh> with &-uh might I say simpler problems ?
you know if you've got a corrosion problem &-uh a corrosion consultant can point you the way fairly quickly .
and likewise in the metallurgy problem .
but &~w wear &-uh &~y &~y it's very hard to point the way and you've gotta work a while .
and where I have succeeded &-uh in in consulting and &-uh where as you see it &-uh Vern Wedeven has succeeded it's when you're taken inside of the problem for a while .
now my inclination generally is I'm inside the problem for a day or two then I say +"/.
+" you_know there's a guy at Penn State that knows this topic better than I .
why don't you call him .
and then I can help describe the problem and so forth so on and expand &-uh you_know the kind_of &~thi the the the database &-uh or &-uh let's do some tests .
but not at the university .
the tests at the university will be on a pin on disc machine which doesn't tell you very much you know ?
let's do some tests in the company with the people in the company and when that is done the intelligence is is it is embedded in the people in the company where it belongs it doesn't get farmed out to the university the interface between universities and external research groups and the sponsoring industry is &-uh &-uh well <it's a> it's a rather high resistance interface .
it's hard to transmit information from outside to inside of a problem that has so many &-uh almost &-um &-uh subjective nuances that people in the company have got to be deeply involved <in the> <in the> in the &-uh investigation .
well alright that doesn't mean you don't look in the literature .
now early on or <in the> in the first part of the book there's a mention of the literature .
there are many journals and I get most of them &-uh and there are many books and I've got &-uh probably nine tenths of the available books of substance .
now there's <a little> &~su a little you know &-uh &-uh subjective sort_of evaluation .
but &-uh <what are the> what are these books ?
well I I you know I can mention here Elsevier has a tribology series and here's a very gripping title Materials for Research written by a very competent guy Bill Glaeser at Battelle .
now Battelle or Glaeser is a &-uh metallurgist and he describes all the metallurgical types of failure that happen and &-uh this is a helpful thing to read .
it's a lengthy thing to read whether you can derive something in one reading &-uh &~i &~i is &-uh you_know something for you to judge I wanna pass these around &-um there are &-uh as I say many books there's this tribology series there's about thirty of them by now to look into &-uh there are the professional society journals the ASLE now called Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers &~p turns out the Tribology Transactions .
here's a journal of very high quality that is to say they are quite careful to accept only good papers +...
they rejected mine three years ago &=laughs:multiple and &-uh &-uh they're &~we very carefully edited and &-uh very well done .
&-uh many of them are &-uh you_know rather esoteric and very &-um &-uh narrow in scope but now and then you can &-uh &-uh find something of use to you in that journal .
the ASME turns out the Journal of Tribology another very high quality journal &-uh really top in the field in hydrodynamics elastohydrodynamics and that sort of thing .
Tribology Transactions will have more articles by the &-uh the chemical industry the &~auto the &-uh additive people &-uh and grease people and so on solid lubricants .
&-uh journal of tribology is mostly hydrodynamics elastohydrodynamics &-uh so+called limits of lubrication so+called boundary lubrication and so forth physical boundary lubrication not so much chemical .
and <both articles> both will have &-uh articles a smattering of articles in wear of materials as_well .
then there's the journal called Wear which is &-uh very much oriented to wear W E A R .
and &-uh this is an Elsevier journal .
fewer people get the Elsevier &-uh journals for one fairly good reason .
you know you can get the Journal of Tribology if you're a member of ASME for a hundred and ten bucks .
hm ?
Elsevier journals cost four thousand bucks +...
&=gasp:SS a year .
now you get twice as much paper &=laughs:multiple &-uh but &-uh and and they're good articles they're you know <there's a> there's a there are more &-uh articles for your four thousand but &-uh that's very expensive .
virtually all libraries around the country you know are are trying to save money and the first things they go after are these Elsevier journals (be)cause all of them are expensive .
but at the same time Elsevier is just growing &~l by leaps and bounds and absorbing many many other independent journals .
before too long they'll have a you know corner <on the> on the commercial market &-uh and all the prices are gonna go up .
&=laughs:multiple the strange thing is that &-uh I'm involved with that journal and &-uh that society that group the &-uh upper administration of ASME just simply will not hear any proposals to raise the price of that journal .
and I think they can go a long ways but &-uh mm so it goes .
anyway the &-uh &-uh Wear journal I got two of them I think they're different ones yeah they're different ones and &-uh this is edited by Duncan Dawson the author of that book you saw the other day on the history of tribology &-uh Duncan has just retired as editor there and Ian Hutchings has now &-uh &-uh taken his place .
well &-um how does one pick through those articles and &-uh &-uh know whether there's something valuable it just takes time .
&-um I suppose a quarter of my time &-uh is spent going through papers and journals .
you know ?
&-uh and I don't think that's enough to stay on top of the field &~i &~i in the manner I want to stay on top of the field you know ?
&-uh &-uh I I I I think that's far too much time for most everybody that's gotta work on real problems so well &-uh so we're &-um moving on now to chapter nine a topic called chemical boundary lubrication .
now +...
this is a &-uh &-uh an an appropriate time for that &-uh being directly adjacent to &-uh the presentation of Doctor Wedeven &-um Vern .
I'll use the &-um &-uh informal term &-um started out in the fluid mechanics side of the house and &-um &-uh bit by bit he had &-uh moved toward &-uh &-uh thinner thinner and thinner films &-uh in &-uh the lubrication problem &-uh down to elastohydrodynamics and then microelastohydrodynamics and now they talk about nanoelastohydrodynamics and next will be teraelastohydrodynamics and so on .
&-uh that's the natural progression of things &-um but I he he says to me anyway did he say this to you ?
&-uh that his techniques have run about to the limit <of &-uh> of &-uh what shall we say &-uh &-uh of &-um treatment of hydrodynamics or fluid films as a load carrying element ?
did he say it &~qui quite that way at all ?
well &-uh we described the problem &-uh this way that &-um you_know hydrodynamic lubrication is the case where &-uh there's a very thick film between two surfaces .
and &-uh we take the fluid film thickness as being something here a value called H .
we take the surface roughness as a value called sigma .
and &-uh we take the ratio of these as &-um &-uh equal to lambda and that's the magic number .
now &-uh &-uh formally we had the luxury of expecting that lambda would be greater than one .
and for that there is an adequate mathematics in simple fluid mechanics then the next thing we get to is &-um elastohydrodynamics and &-uh &-uh the &-um what what slipped in along with elastohydrodynamics &-uh is the &-um &-uh &-uh the &~g the &-uh the fact really that in so very many cases of sliding lambda is less than one .
and &-uh maybe more like say point one and often smaller .
well now that says something about how each individual asperity will collide with somebody else &-uh they feel each_other's presence whereas these do not .
and so the study of hydrodynamics is getting on toward &-uh considering what happens on a microscale .
and here you've got to admit that &-um when you've got asperities colliding there goes an asperity that way and here stands one and &-um at some point this one hasta glide up over <that one> that one hasta scrunch down .
&-uh they are separated by a very thin film .
and if we look at it from the side you see we can envision that .
but &-uh even this treatment you_know has its difficulties .
this contact pressure is high and so we've got to consider the pressure viscosity index .
that is to say how does that oil &-uh thicken up or harden up &-uh with contact pressure ?
and &-uh if it becomes hard &-uh rigid as &-uh Vern mentioned how does it shear ?
there's &-uh plenty to study in that area but &-uh now &-uh &-uh the other side or the other half of the picture is that where we've got large or a contact nominal contact area &-um they &-uh &-uh microelastohydrodynamics happens in isolated little patches and they're highly transient .
at one instant they're there and an instant later we've got those &-uh microcontact areas in different locations and that just keeps changing with time .
now how do you calculate what happens in these isolated regions &-uh when you &-uh you know have a large surface like this ?
what is the meaning of +//?
&-uh well &-uh you see downstairs in the elastohydrodynamic equation is W over L E R to the point one three power .
well W and L &-um &-uh &-uh well if you got two rollers rolling together you've got implied load and you've got a length dimension L like this .
and from contact mechanics you can work out this dimension which is two a@l .
we have an average area or average contact pressure through those numbers .
that's not where the action is .
the real action is on these individual asperities &-um which you have to calculate by a different way .
so the equations of elastohydrodynamics are moving over to a very different form than we had seen to accommodate the situation where we've got &-uh &-uh very isolated contact all over .
and I'm not equal to that task .
I'm not a mathematician at all .
&-uh but eventually though though you &-uh &-uh &-uh somebody well there's some fairly good work going on in that area .
some of it is by &-uh finite element methods .
&-um but eventually we all know that &-um surfaces &-uh will give up somehow or other .
we can &-uh you know with the elastohydrodynamics we've got alpha and E to the point seven power and then here we've got &-uh velocity and viscosity divided by ER to the point seven power and a_couple_of other little things that are constant out front and so on H over R &-uh that is a &-uh we can calculate a film thickness .
&-uh as I say working with lambda we kinda get a sense of you know the comparative comparisons there but none of these equations say much about what do the materials think of it all .
&-uh will these materials &-uh you_know &-uh go on forever with smaller and smaller lambdas how do we start to get into this equation the stress state on each asperity or little points of contact and then work outward from there &-uh well by by what sort of mathematics ?
&-uh you could say I suppose that an asperity comes by hits this one and tears it away a single contact causing adhesion that tears away or could you say that many asperities pass by here and eventually this thing falls off by fatigue we don't know the bridge from hydrodynamics to material failure yet .
well &-uh I'm not going to help all that much in that area but I'd like to &-uh &-uh report <some of the> &-uh &-uh some of the chemical effects as we had found them .
this chapter really is a kind of a summary of &-uh the work in our lab for the last twenty years and &-uh boundary lubrication .
and &-uh well let's go into the <chapter one> &-uh chapter nine page one fifty seven and and eight .
&-um how do surfaces fail ?
well we've got general terms .
we don't speak specifically about the experience of individual asperities or regions surfaces fail by &-uh a number of &-um well mechanisms that we'd we've come up with .
we say there's galling on the surface or we say there's scuffing or there's scoring and &-uh other such words that we use .
&-um I think it doesn't help us understand how it all started &-um but we do call that +//.
&-uh &-uh the situation that leads to those kind of failures , we call that marginal lubrication which I've written before on the board &-uh boundary lubrication and &-um inadequate lubrication or catastrophic lubrication or words like that .
&-uh but let's go back in this this word boundary lubrication .
&-uh Vern used the term .
Vern used the term in the sense of fluid mechanics .
usually &-uh boundary lubrication is when &-uh lambda is too small to be &-uh very helpful .
&-uh it's it's the the word boundary in that sense is &-uh &=pause_while_writing_on_blackboard boundary is &-uh in the sense of between good and bad hm ?
(0.6) &-uh that's one sense &-uh there's another sense in &-uh &-uh that &-uh in which people use this sorta thing whenever whenever the coefficient of friction is greater than some number say point one .
or maybe point one five or maybe point two or point one eight .
&-uh that is functionally one defines boundary lubrication &-uh as &-um well there's that <this is> this is evidence that things are not <as you> as you like them .
a different definition .
&-um well another &-uh evidence for or definition of boundary lubrication is you know <as we> &~see as we've seen before the lambda ratio as being less than one &-uh well there's no kind of limit to where the boundary lubrication regime is &-uh on the Stribeck curve some put boundary lubrication here some put boundary lubrication there I think what you see is that boundary lubrication is just everything to the left of where things work right .
&=laughs:multiple xxx which isn't all that bad I mean say if you're working out here in the lubrication &-uh area you can't spend too much time helping other people define their terms you know ?
&-uh so you see these terms in the literature I I I say this without value judgment particularly well marginal or boundary lubrication's been studied &-um in a number of ways and by a number of people .
you remember I mentioned &-um that &-uh Sir William B Hardy in nineteen twenty five or thereabout &-uh did an experiment dropping fatty acid on water and then picking up that film on a glass plate and then sliding doing &~s &-uh friction experiment .
and &-uh &-uh that was the experiment that dispelled the <the &-uh> the &-uh &-um interlocking idea &-uh but Hardy went on to do more work this boundary film or this fatty acid film attached to the surface by some method &-uh different from &-um &-uh surface tension .
that is to say you put a drop of water on a surface and tilt the surface there's surface tension indeed but that drop will just flow right off and &-um &-uh leaving scarcely any mark behind now these fatty acids didn't just flow right off they would &-uh &-uh form &-um &-uh a residue where they parked .
there was some chemical reaction .
boundary film &-um real chemical boundary film work started there but then &-um &-uh there were several other kinds of &-uh boundary films there are &-uh on page &-uh one fifty nine &-uh one you see in the literature three classifications of &-uh of boundary lubrication &-uh A an unreactive lubricant metal pair in which lubricant viscosity decreases as &-uh mu rises as temperature increases .
&-uh well that's just simply the straight mechanical boundary lubrication .
friction goes up as the temperature goes up .
how about B ?
well there's a fatty acid or the metal soap of a fatty acid which melts at a particular temperature and becomes ineffective as a lubricant at higher temperature .
but it sure worked at lower temperature .
then we've got the third kind of boundary lubricant it's a liquid .
containing a reactive constituent that forms low shear strength compounds on the sliding surface at even at room temperature &-uh a little bit .
these reactive constituents are referred to as EP extreme pressure additives these days .
but what happens with this kind you see there's some reactivity in the view of the fact that the friction is lower than say case A .
&-uh but then as the temperature rises there's greater reactivity and makes <the temperature go> &~dow &-uh the friction go down .
but eventually even this gives up and the friction goes up .
well the &-um the &-uh &-uh effective constituents are &-uh phosphates which work up to about two hundred and fifty C chlorides which work up to about four hundred and sulfides which work up to about four hundred and thirty .
well so the &-uh &-uh +//.
one could ask then why not just dump a_lot_of this stuff in your engines and or transmissions gearboxes or whatever because &-um &-uh they will work but one hasta be quite careful because they work ultimately by corroding the metal and the product of corrosion lies on the surface and if it's the right has the right properties it's a lubricant .
<that's the> that's the mechanism of chemical boundary lubrication .
it's that simple well relatively simple .
&-um a chemical reaction occurs with the substrate metal and &-uh that product of corrosion has a low shear strength relative to the substrate if you do it right and that produces low friction lower than if you didn't have it there and whenever you have lower friction do you have less wear ?
⌈ well ⌉ .
⌊ not necessarily ⌋ .
sometimes .
certainly you have less tendency to scuffing +...
so that's the friction in marginal lubrication next we have the wear in marginal lubrication +...
&-uh how fast do these materials wear &-uh when &-um in various &-uh types of lubrication ?
in figure nine two we have three curves .
three lines line A is for inert substances line B is for mineral oil and line C is for commercial grade engine oil now we use these three &-uh oils or environments in our work as &-uh &-uh easy ways to get certain effects .
but first of all let's say that line A has been predicted by &-um &-uh considerations of &~elasto &~hydrodyn &~cont &-uh elastohydrodynamics and contact mechanics .
&-um &-uh Tallian of SKF Bearing Company &-uh &-uh very &-uh sharp contact mechanics guy says that &-uh you've got rough surfaces well everybody says that &-uh some of these bumps are higher than others you know statistically &-uh now if you've got a &-uh &-uh an adequate film thickness there none of the asperities are in a state of high stress .
but if you increase the load or decrease the viscosity of the lubricant in here &-um your calculations will tell you that you could get a thinner film .
and &-uh now if that thinner film is thinner than the height of these asperities then you could say well some of these then must be making contact with each_other and I'll you know you just have to imagine these are touching &-uh they're making contact with each_other and &-uh &-uh more of these will make contact with each_other as that film gets thinner and thinner .
so &-uh Tallian comes up with a load sharing idea that the thinner the film the less the load will be carried on a fluid film and the more it will be carried on asperities then he says that any loads carried on asperities is subject to the considerations of you know of dry wear or something like that the Archard type of wear .
hm ?
that if you've got minute areas of contact you're gonna have wee little bits of wear .
if you've got several regions of of contact you're gonna have more wear .
or what happened is &-uh &-uh &~c &-uh &-uh Tallian's final calculation is curve A .
&-uh that is the amount of wear one would get +//.
that's on a log scale you notice .
that's the amount of wear one would get &-uh &-uh as a function of lambda .
when the lambda is three and over +...
ah I should have mentioned that earlier too .
you know lambda is the ratio of &-uh H over sigma .
sigma you recall is a statistical quantity and &-uh when you deal with a statistical quantity +//.
let's say you've got an RA of ten .
likely there will be &-uh a good number of them also at height fifteen some at twenty fewer at twenty five but some also at thirty .
and this is kind_of the &-uh the the range that people take &-uh that &-um a lambda of one may have asperities that are three times as high as your average .
and so you see the Tallian curve starts at about three well that's carefully crafted to come out that way I did it on my own Macintosh &-uh but if you look in &-uh Tallian's article it does come out that way so then as lambda gets smaller and smaller the load carried by asperities increases and the wear then should increase &-uh in the same &-uh &-uh &-uh in the same way .
is it true ?
does it happen ?
well in_order_to in_order_to check this out you've gotta test this &-uh you_know hypothesis in a neutral atmosphere .
why a neutral atmosphere ?
the assumption is that when there's contact you've got adhesion and adhesion can come about if you don't have &-uh oxides .
alright ?
so our way of doing that is to use vacuum pump oil &-um &-uh diffusion pump oil which is a silicone and it has no gas in it .
&-uh &-uh unless you you_know leave the bottle open and shake it or something like that .
but as you buy it there's no gas in vacuum pump oil .
it's a silicone fluid .
then you you_know on our machine that we had here you pour some of that on the specimen .
and then we put a plastic bag around it and blowed nitrogen through there .
and we've got an &~iner &~iner inert atmosphere as inert as &-uh as you needed .
you don't hafta have a vacuum .
in my younger days I always pumped up a vacuum but now we can get it much more cheaply with just a bag of nitrogen .
alright then using that inert atmosphere we got a wear rate that followed curve A .
&-uh Tallian is vindicated I believe in that &-uh load sharing concept well we did another experiment then with laboratory grade mineral oil and that always has some entrained air &-uh in it and &-uh &-uh something different happens .
&-uh at the &-uh lambda of three or thereabout there's very little wear and this curve kind of &~go goes up along with A but then finally peels off at some point .
&-uh well why does it peel off at that point or what is the meaning of peeling off in the first place ?
this surface will function at a lower lambda ratio without severe wear .
well that is the case of &-um some kind of coating forming on these &-uh these these points of &-uh collision and &-uh those coatings &-um well I'll give you the bottom line those coatings will prevent high shear stress on that asperity .
and we'll mention this two or three times the the the +//.
my best explanation of that mechanism comes out to something this we know that +//.
&-uh &-uh let's just kind_of make a_couple_of &-uh of asperities here &-um when one slides over the other &-uh there is a &-uh &-uh likelihood of &-uh you_know some kind of traction being transmitted from one to the other and we can use our familiar terms when there's a load on that asperity .
and there's a &-uh traction &-uh which is &-uh we we can call F or F is the force required to overcome that traction and we're familiar that &-uh with these terms that that is F over W .
and &-um &-um now from mechanics we know a few things that backing up to a simple normal load the first plastic flow happens there and then with increased normal load there's gonna be &-uh a larger and larger plastic field .
now if we instead of or in addition to W have a finite value of F applied the point of first plastic flow moves out and finally appears at that surface when mu is about point three .
on this asperity .
well &-uh on that asperity that's different I want to reiterate that's different from a &-uh coefficient of friction that one measures over a large surface .
because we're talking here about very remote little spots .
each of these might have a coefficient of friction of point five point six point seven or something like that .
and <it might not> it probably would not be detectable by the measurement of the overall friction of the system because the rest of this area is so large compared to those little dots .
and we've got fluid shearing over every place else .
and we might have solid adhesion in those minute spots but there are too few to measure .
and <we have> &-uh we've done this many many times .
we know that in scuffing tests in our machines like the one I had here &-uh that the coefficient of friction bobbles along like this so on and so on .
eventually that friction goes up as the surface really goes to pot .
but if we had &~in +//.
and we do investigate this .
look at that surface in detail all along the way .
you often find that about two thirds of the way through final failure is +//.
you see the first evidence of scuffing .
scuffing starts way back there and you can never detect it by friction measurements by sound you know ultrasonic devices by temperature by nothing &-uh it just is an insidious little force I suppose like a cancer or something like that we how do we detect it ?
well by diligent microscopy we don't of_course take a specimen and run it at &-uh this &~le this amount of time examine it put it back in so on and so on because whenever you take it out_of the &-uh of the system it's oxidizing while it's outside of the system and the situation has changed &-uh and you dare not start from there .
so rather we usually &-uh put in a specimen one for five minutes ten minutes fifteen minutes and so on down the line and do this often enough until they were reasonably sure that out here is where the action is &-uh in scuff initiation and &-uh out here is <where the> where the where you get the real evidence .
and this &~th this is the point of a_lot_of discussion at conferences .
&-uh we &-um well you can probably reconstruct the arguments &-uh well enough anyway when the coefficient of friction on an asperity exceeds thirty tenths or some number like that the plastic flow field comes out to the surface and &-uh begins to &-uh push materials ahead of the &-um &-uh of the upper slider scuff it forward like that and &-uh that bump is higher than the original bump .
hm on average .
how do we know that ?
make surfaces rub together and just <keep rubbing and> keep rubbing and keep rubbing &-uh and do surface roughness tracing &-uh during those experiments and you'll see that the surfaces get rougher .
and &-uh that hasta be due to this sort_of mechanism .
there's nothing else and there are no other interactions on the surface that could make the roughness increase like that .
so there it is alright &-uh so now we got &-uh &-uh &-uh oh yes and and obviously when little chunks pull out that coefficient of friction must be very high on that surface &-uh but somehow or other when a soft substance forms and that soft +//.
if that soft substance produces an asperity coefficient of friction less than thirty tenths we have &-uh &-uh shall we say arrested the &-uh &-uh &-uh roughening of the surface .
and &-uh in fact you'd probably even get a smoothing of the surface with the coefficient of friction is low enough and what was a danger point here &-uh has &-uh now been &-uh &-uh smoothed down and then here's another danger point and that gets smoothed down so forth and eventually the &~sur the the the surface kind of &-uh &-uh &-uh those two surfaces are accommodated to each_other .
well we'll go over this a couple more times but curve B &-uh follows curve A for a while and &-uh then &-uh peels off and &-uh &-uh looks like it's a protected surface we don't get an awful lot of +//.
that's a log scale on the left side we get a great reduction of wear we +//.
because of the protective action of a film which in this case is oxide .
a chemical analysis doesn't show anything other than iron and oxygen mineral oil &-uh we get laboratory grade mineral oil with very low sulfur content and what we see on the surface &-uh well &-uh you see a sulfur zipping by every now and then but it's predominantly oxide .
FE three o@l four oxide which is nice and soft and protective .
and this is still done under &-uh oxygen free atmosphere ?
&-uh no this is done in air .
oh that's in air .
yeah done in air and we've worked with dry air and moist air and you get the same results +...
what happens if you do it in nitrogen ?
if you do it in nitrogen after time the surface &-uh &-uh fails .
&-uh the oxygen is used up on the surface but you still have &-uh &-uh contact and &-uh &-uh oxide gets knocked off and it doesn't get replenished after some time and the surface moves toward failure .
yes sir .
&-um one question I have is as that plastic field moves up and forward +/.
yes +/.
+, how did the shear planes change ?
&~do does it rotate with it or does it stay in the same ⌈ same orientation ⌉ ?
⌊ yeah you mean to say ⌋ does this then kind_of go this way ?
well yeah right now our +//.
with direct normal loading it's at the forty five degree angle .
yeah +/.
+, &-um when it moves up toward the front does it rotate or does it &-uh +/.
+, well +/.
+, stay in the same orientation and move forward ?
yeah there are a_couple_of views on that are you acquainted with slipline fields +...
in plasticity ?
very little .
very little yeah you'll +//.
you know <there are> there are sliplines &-uh not always oriented at a forty five &-uh with a large normal force they'll be oriented a little flatter than that &-uh or in other words with a lower coefficient of friction they'll be flatter with a higher coefficient of friction they're higher &-uh so on slipline fields &-um &-uh +//.
Peter Oxley of Australia and &-uh Ken Johnson of Cambridge are trying to work this sort_of thing out &-uh just exactly how does that material flow .
hm I ought to know slipline fields I &-uh took a course in the subject &-uh back in eighteen seventy I think it was &=laughs:multiple &-uh and I've still got some of those notes in my file and &-uh I look at those things and I say jeez wonder who wrote this I mean I just don't understand it anymore .
does that have to do with the dislocations in a particular ⌈ material ⌉ ?
⌊ no ⌋ .
no +/.
+, they just they treat the material as homogeneous isotropic and rigid and plastic perfectly plastic .
you know ?
it's really as us chickens know it's really due to dislocations but the continuum mechanics people &-uh &-uh treat it differently .
alright so &-uh now the next experiment is done with commercial grade engine oil &-uh a &-uh &-uh we bought a_couple_of cans of &-uh ordinary Mobil ten w@l thirty one day and &-uh used that and I got Mobil ten w@l thirty because &-uh Uncle Ed where I have my car oil changed that's what they sell .
and &-uh so that's our choice .
&=laughs:multiple scientifically &-uh &-uh determined you see ?
&-um well there again &-uh you see that the the wear rate is &-uh orders of ten couple of orders of ten less than you get with straight mineral oil &-uh with &-uh and goes to even a smaller +//.
you +//.
surface goes to a smaller lambda ratio before it fails &-uh and the end of those lines incidentally are points at which wear is so severe the surface gets rough and you'd rather not run it anymore +...
alright what forms on the surface when you use engine oil ?
&-um &-um well &-um a whole lot o(f) stuff .
now &-um when doing this kind of research &-um you are driven to &-uh looking for some shorthand way of doing things because scuffing tests or &-uh lubricated wear tests can be quite lengthy .
and &-um &-uh there again your conclusions are so strongly connected with the geometry that you use .
and &-um you had seen and I had mentioned before that in our work we prefer to use the disc with a cylinder laying on it .
and we had found over the years that that configuration connects with or correlates significantly better with practical problems than the pin on disc .
and I I mentioned just a little bit and I'll just mention some more here that you_know <whenever there's> &-uh whenever this disc turns &-uh with high contact pressures something gets loosened from the surface .
and those are usually oxides .
and &-uh those oxides get loosened and come up from under the slider and move around out in front again .
and &-um &-uh if you've got a pin a contact you've got &-uh &-uh geometry of contact such_that the oxide and debris other debris particles are washed aside .
but if you've got a cylinder laying there the &-uh debris are constrained to to pass through the contact area again and that is what happens in most practical things .
the debris somehow hangs around and gets shoved through contact again and does its own &-uh peculiar type of damage .
so we'd used the &-uh cylinder on flat &-uh geometry other people use other geometries &-um their conclusions come out a little different in time and wear rates and so forth &-uh but I just want to mention the kinds of tests we do because the conclusions are <are &-uh> are &-uh given in those kind of terms how do you do a scuffing test ?
or &-um any test that's going to last for a long time ?
&-uh you you know you don't try to hasten them with high loads &-uh that's you know brings on a different wear mechanism (0.5) you can do a test at very low load a very safe load and &-uh run the test for a year &=laughs you know ?
before you get failure or you can increase the load and get failure in say a month this is a log scale or you can increase the load and get a failure in a week or a day or an hour or whatever and we've done some of those not the year+long ones &-uh to see xxx if there's some regularity you know ?
if you get +//.
if you don't get regularity in other words if you don't get the same surface appearance in every one of these &-uh at the end of every one of those experiments &-uh you're not invoking the same failure mechanisms hm ?
well we had found &-uh that you know there's a limit above which you dare not go &-uh and &-um &-uh so we kind of restricted ourselves to &-uh some kind of lower area of load &-uh but then we were +//.
we didn't want to &-uh &-um run these tests for a month and a week and all that sort of thing &-uh what we tried then <is to> is to see once if it's possible to use a step load test .
here is the load and &-uh here is the duration or time at load (0.6) &=writing_on_blackboard and so we put a load on like that leave it on for ten minutes and increase the load xxx for ten minutes and so on down the line and now we're looking for the step at which failure occurs .
a step load test .
and the first question one hasta ask is whether or not that is a fair &-uh way to test &-uh or fair way to simulate this this we feel is probably a &~val more valid way of testing but it takes a long time does this short test connect with this ?
and in &-um our work it does if you do it right again &-uh and &-uh what is doing it right well you could do a whole lot o(f) wee little steps you see and &-uh or you could do &-uh several big ones or you could do a step that lasts twenty minutes and so on down the line .
&-uh we had found that &-um if you if if you have &-uh &-uh step lasting about ten minutes or so &-uh it works okay it gives you time to get your instruments going and take a sip of coffee and so forth .
there's no point in rushing the thing and if the &-uh you you do find &-uh that say in this &-uh sort_of graph that there is a load at which the thing only lasts you know a little a second or so .
&-uh so now there is a critical load if we divide our steps up to that particular point in say about seven eight or ten units and that's how we pick our step height or so &-uh we end up with a test that's pretty good .
and &-uh &-uh this I do recommend if you're into the &-uh topic of of &-uh scuff &~re scuffing research the step load test is pretty good &-um it's certainly short and you've gotta know what &-uh what you're seeing when you do that .
is there any correlation between &-uh the failure mode there and the compressive failure that you might do in one of these pencil machines or opposite xxx where you actually get a number for the pencil failure and then there's another number that's higher for the compressive failure .
ah +/.
+, is there any relation between those ?
I don't think so .
I don't think so .
no (0.5) .
I mean xxx for the particular material .
yeah .
no I don't think so .
xxx &-uh &-um the &-uh +//.
you see we're looking for the failure of asperities and that involves both normal load and shear load on that asperity and furthermore we're looking at repeat &-uh events .
yeah +/.
+, we're more into plastic fatigue than any other property of the material I think .
I say then right up front I do believe that galling scuffing and scoring are basically plastic fatigue mechanisms (0.5) plastic fatigue mechanisms +...
but of_course one hasta take account of what is the coefficient of friction on the asperities you know .
&-uh X number of &-uh collisions &-um &-uh &-uh is not the answer I mean you gotta know how &~mu what the severity of stress was .
and then the other imponderable of_course is with a whole lot of asperities xxx how do you know who's got bang how many times you know sort_of thing ?
does that coefficient of point three change with &-uh different materials ?
&~i .
ductile materials .
yeah is that just &-uh steel ⌈ per_se ⌉ ?
⌊ that's ⌋ all ductile materials .
all ductile materials okay .
all ductile materials .
yeah .
mhm .
at at what point in the wear then does any noise begin to be produced ?
at what point <in the> <in the> in the test ?
yeah if you started out with good lubrication and you slowly .
and at what time does noise at what point does noise change ?
mhm increase +/.
+, after well after the first &-uh initiation or the +//.
yeah the first initiation is first isn't it .
well after the &=laughs:multiple well after the initiation of scuffing the microscopic &-uh evidence appeared you know .
is that at the knee of the curve then ?
&-uh knee of which curve ?
the +//.
your &-uh wear rates .
oh no .
no the +//.
that's not connected .
&-uh let's say those curves there +/.
mhm +/.
+, &-um let's just put one of them up &=writing_on_blackboard &-uh let's take the mineral oil one and go like that something like that .
yeah .
&-uh these +//.
<this is> this is wear rate that is a steady progression of wear and where does the noise start ?
+, yes +/.
+, at the kickoff .
+, so +/.
+, <you know> you know at at the very start .
the kind of noise &-uh doesn't get particularly worse .
&-uh the the noise that &-uh throughout the whole test doesn't get particularly worse until we get to that point then we deem that to be a a failure .
but all the while that this wearing is taking place the noise is about the same .
+, mkay +/.
+, just kind_of a low level of noise somewhat like you know when you run a lathe or a cutting tool there's a kind_of a rumble or a low noise all over the place ?
&-uh but then <when the> when the cutting tool fails you know the +//.
what kind of noise you get ?
that's about &-uh <what we> what we have here .
you know ?
in terms of in &~te you know &-uh &-uh noise pressure .
so when you're doing the step test &-um noise is not a good indicator of when you're +/.
no +/.
+, starting to get +/.
+, no +/.
+, xxx it always happens well after .
yeah .
&-uh when you're doing the step load test typically &-um you you measure friction &-uh during during during these &-uh &-uh load applications and when you're measuring friction &-uh the friction will generally go up you know very much in parallel with the load .
so you put on a load and if let's say you put this load on and if the friction jumps up a tad then settles down the next time you put on the load you're gonna get failure .
usually or something like that you see ?
if that +//.
that works if your steps are not too big .
&-uh and +//.
so then you see when you put this load on you'll get a little bit of a quivering of the machine .
it wants to fail but it thinks better of it you see &=laughs:multiple and then you put this on and then you get a a significant noise .
and that's failure .
&-uh now that <that is a> that's a little different from &-uh &-uh what I described earlier .
that &-um &-uh &~w &-uh &-uh friction &~v versus time +//.
if you run one of these <long term> long term tests &=writing_on_blackboard friction versus time eventually goes up and the first evidence of failure is there .
that's with a steady load on it .
and you've got to kind_of guess that that's happening somewhere along this line too .
every time you dump a new load on you're changing conditions .
every time you dump a new load on is the equivalent to setting yourself up with a curve that's gonna fail earlier .
so you jump from that curve to that curve .
seems unfair but it sure is a_lot shorter test .
you know you can +//.
this this kind of test if you're doing things right that kinda test is out_of the way in an hour's time .
maybe two hours something like that .
&~i <is that> &-uh is that cumulative damage or are you just trying to find the point that +//.
that two thirds point where the scuffing actually initiates ?
&-uh <it is> it is &~s &~s somewhat of an accumulated failure &-uh because you see the length of time that you run these at these steps matters .
&-uh if you have very short steps you'll probably get failure at a lower load .
okay ?
&-uh so that accumulated time means something in two ways that's either an accumulated damage or an accumulated curing .
you know healing of damage .
in other words the chemistry has time to to work to protect &-uh +//.
produce a protective film .
hm ?
and if your steps are too short you don't give it &~e &~ti enough time to build up a film .
none of the area <under the> under the curve then really is &-uh &-uh +//.
defines failure ?
&=sigh well &-um I I &~r I doubt that if you see if you have very short steps shorts steps like that you'll get failure quicker than if you have longer steps like this .
of the same height so .
at the same height yeah +/.
okay +/.
+, yeah .
(0.5) well so we have &-um &-uh step +//.
a step load test and &-um &-uh I suppose we did these kind of things for four or five years with about &-uh five or six &-uh &-uh PhD projects trying to work out macroscopically what we're seeing and connecting with practical parts .
&-uh we had gotten satisfied with our &-uh &-uh our &-uh three ways of testing &-uh in a neutral atmosphere a &-uh &-uh &-uh mineral oil only and a &-uh &-uh Mobil ten w@l thirty oil &-uh and so we we tried a good number of things but we always did see that &-um and I showed you yesterday on one of those disks that had a dark streak on it .
and &-uh bit by bit we became aware that &-uh &-uh that dark streak &-um was &-uh &-uh involved in &-uh &-um &-um surface protection and so what's in that dark streak ?
&-uh there have been several claims as to what could be in that dark streak we &-um &-uh though did our own analysis and &-uh found that it was FE three o@l four largely almost exclusively FE three o@l four ah but there was something else in it .
&-uh we had always found a relatively high amount of carbon in that film an amount of carbon that was &-uh much greater than you could attribute to the &-uh carbon connected with the iron in the form of the substrate steel .
you know we worked with four tenths percent carbon steel forty thirty forty steel and &-uh the amount of carbon we saw now &-uh relative to the amount of iron was &-uh several times greater than you could connect with &-uh the carbon in the steel .
well furthermore we had found that &-um the &-um &-uh coefficient of friction of dry steel on dry steel was &-uh about point two five and &-uh this is &-uh before lubrication dry &-uh before &=writing_on_blackboard (0.4) that coefficient of friction at about point two five well then the next thing was to &-um +//.
we formed that film under &~th the step load kind of test and when the film was nice and dark and uniform &-uh we then dried off that surface with solvent &=pause_while_writing_on_blackboard solvent dried and the coefficient of friction was point one two +...
&-um that's on a new +//.
other &-uh mating slider and so on .
well could we safely infer from this that the &-uh &-uh that whatever that film is &-uh it &-uh &~provi produces low friction &-uh reduced friction there's something in that film &-uh what is that carbon ?
&-uh that's +//.
remains a mystery .
now &-uh we did one other thing &-uh since now we are +//.
had come to &-uh believe that there's &-uh &-uh &-uh +//.
that oxygen &-uh is important in the system to form FE three o@l four &-uh we began to &-uh &-uh &-uh work with &-uh &-uh different &-uh &-uh oxygen states .
we deaerated +...
is that the right way to spell that ?
oil and &-uh &-uh we got earlier failure .
&-uh we aerated that +//.
I don't know +//.
I forget +//.
is that the way to spell that ?
somebody must know how to spell that but &-uh oil that is &-uh we bubbled oil into the thing and &-uh &-uh you_know cooled down the oil and bubbled oil into it and shook it and all that sort of thing got more oxygen in and &-uh we got higher load carrying capacity .
&-um well then the next thing we did +//.
I was &-uh at the same time as this project was going on I was working with &-uh &-um a &-uh maker of &-uh &-um &-um of &-um hydraulic fluid &-uh water base hydraulic fluid and the water base hydraulic fluid &-uh would &-uh chew up the pumps rather badly .
&-uh but it was still worth doing because &-uh you could &~re &~re replace a pump every week rather than replacing a steel mill every year &-uh you know when when hydraulic lines break in the presence of &-uh red hot steel you have fireworks .
&=laughs:multiple well &-um we then took &-uh +//.
used water in our experiments and &-uh &-uh found a &-uh &-uh +...
a coefficient of friction after sliding with water a coefficient of friction of point one eight rather than the point one two .
now that doesn't hafta be solvent dried just dry in the atmosphere &-uh then we &-um &-um deaerated water took the air out_of water by the freeze+thaw cycle with a vacuum pump attached and &-uh oh excuse_me this produced FE two o@l three .
&-uh we deaerated water and &-uh &-um got a lower coefficient of friction about point one five and then we found on the surface there was FE three o@l four .
well &-uh we took another shot at &-uh pumping air into the &-uh oil and &-uh we did that long enough so that &-uh we ended up getting FE two o@l three on the surface rather than FE three o@l four .
&-uh then if you +//.
well there are obviously &-uh &-uh &-uh &-uh combinations that one can get but &-uh in every case when we formed FE three o@l four we got low wear and whenever you had FE two o@l three you had high wear .
&=writing_on_blackboard (0.6) FE two o@l three is harder than FE three o@l four and it's a_lot thicker .
and we found that the FE two o@l three was approximately eighteen hundred angstroms thick and the FE &-um thirty oh four was something of the order of three hundred or four hundred or so angstroms thick or thin and it was of_course &-uh well well very protective low wear .
well now &-uh so much for identifying what occurs +//.
what happens on the surface +/.
+, sir .
where did the carbon come or go ?
I mean is the carbon in all these other tests ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ oh the carbon ⌋ is not +//.
where you have water you don't have carbon .
okay .
yeah that's a good point xxx &-uh now then what does that lead you to to guess that perhaps that high carbon content ⌈ is &-um ⌉ +/.
⌊ breaking down the oil ⌋ ?
+, some oil .
in what form ?
now <if you> &-uh if you think of &~FE &+th or any ceramic material &-uh furthermore let's see at this point we started looking at these surfaces with quite high magnification and found that the &-uh FE three o@l four was present as flakes .
and &-uh like this and these flakes might be five ten maybe fifty layers high .
and &-uh where do these flakes come from ?
&-uh well I can believe that these are the native oxides that reside on &~t tops of asperities and they get knocked loose and they're carried downstream somehow or other maybe piling up in front of the next asperity well we kind of &-uh are reasonably sure of that piled up in front of the next asperity in various layers and then when a real serious asperity comes along it &-uh finds a &-uh a film +//.
multiple films of FE three o@l four with what in_between ?
perhaps there is &-uh a hydrocarbon in_between but &-uh that hydrocarbon cannot be &-uh very thick .
&-uh because of the coefficient of friction point one two &-uh at very &-uh &-uh &-um +//.
when the surface is the &~so the top surface is dried there are these &-um &-uh layers possibly of &-uh of oil between we are are +//.
we have some specimens in a an expensive analysis lab this at as we speak trying to figure out what's there .
&-uh is it &-uh oil so there's +//.
&~th &~th the oil has been tagged we've got some specific elements in that oil for tracing &-uh &-uh that's &-uh you_know &-uh the the oil between the film +//.
the flakes .
but if you +//.
if this is oil lubricated then we would expect to find that the higher the sliding speed the higher the friction as in the case of viscous lubrication and we don't find that .
we get a &-uh solvent dried surface &-uh as a coefficient of friction about point one two no matter how you slide it and we covered two orders of ten in sliding speed .
a constant friction suggests something closer to a solid than to a liquid .
so we don't know the state of that stuff what it is but we could I suppose &-uh &-uh begin to believe that it's &-uh &-uh these are films that are molecularly thin and what about films that are molecularly thin ?
this is only &-uh &-um &-uh vain speculation maybe I don't know but you know the people that &-uh &-uh do molecular dynamics &-uh do some calculating on this line .
but there +//.
at the same time there are people that take mica sheets and &-um well they actually take mica sheets and make &-uh &~c &-uh &-uh cylinders of them and &-uh then they &-uh cross these cylinders like this such_that there's an a +//.
put a load on and there's a &-uh kind_of a a a flat region of contact between them and then they &-uh &-uh +//.
well we gotta have a little separation there +//.
put solvents in there &-uh not &-uh &~y your simple ones but &-uh solvents very low viscosity substances and then &-uh by &-uh &-uh multiple beam interferometry work on how thin those films are .
and they are working with films that are &-uh &~w &-uh two three and four molecules thick and they measure effective viscosities that are a hundred to a thousand times greater than bulk viscosity +...
now they also &~pur &-uh purport to see waves passing through here just as Vern mentioned &-uh the work of Winer and Bear &-uh fluid between two &-uh hard steels are solidified and then when this is sheared you see shear lines or shear plains .
well are we at the &-uh boundary between liquids and solids here ?
and is this stuff &-uh really &-uh molecularly thin oil ?
&-uh which is +//.
well what about that oil ?
why is this stuff &~ha so viscous ?
well it's simply because you see this mica or the steel or the oxide or whatever , you_know it's composed of &~molecul of atoms rather .
and &-uh surface atoms have a much higher energy state than any other row of atoms in the substrate by virtue of having them deprived of neighbors .
and &-uh their bitterness shows &=laughs:multiple &-uh and any liquids that form &-uh that &-uh wander in there &-uh take on the orientation of the substrate .
and if we've got another surface here not too far away perhaps the entire liquid in here becomes oriented or settles in some &-uh some order .
and an ordered structure is a solid or a solid is an ordered structure so very very thin films do have viscosities very different from the conventional &-uh &-uh kinematic or &-uh &-uh dynamic viscosities .
I don't know if we've got that here or not .
&-um but &-uh the fact that &-uh this coefficient of friction is independent of shear rate suggests that we are not looking at bulk viscosities there (0.5) well &-um let's see that was your question are you +//.
did you have any follow up on that at all or do you +//?
you know your people are working on this kind of thing too aren't they ?
&-uh yeah .
yeah .
you have anything you can reveal at all ?
&=laughs:multiple .
you mentioned several things which thing are you asking about ?
oh I see .
&=laughs:multiple okay +...
we probably don't know as much as you would like to know about it .
&=laughs:multiple it's not really our xxx we're trying to catch up with them .
mean to say we ought to exchange our ignorance sometime or other ?
&=laughs:multiple .
we don't always know what's going on .
boy I don't either I tell you .
alright now now that we kind of know what forms on the surface and we're quite sure that it's FE three o@l four I mean &-uh &-um people in &-uh &-uh another car company and &-uh and one of the suppliers to the other car company hm have favored us with some very thorough analysis &-uh and it's &-uh &-uh &-uh by Auger and other spectrographic methods are quite sure that it's FE three o@l four .
and &-uh in the case of &~l liquid +//.
&-uh &-uh oil lubrication and quite sure it's FE two o@l three .
but we've got a verification of that anyway we've done ellipsometry and we &-uh see certainly the FE two o@l three it stands out like a sore thumb but &-uh so obvious in &-uh ellipsometry .
but let's &-uh take a little look at &-uh &-uh something of the dynamics of this &-uh sequence of events .
it's not enough to know what the chemistry is what we wanted to then find out was what surface roughness what hardness of substrate what sliding conditions <and so on> and so on and so on will form this film ?
because you know there is a &~com competition in practical machines .
you know that &-uh a new &-uh &-uh steel part has only an oxide &-uh layer on it and that oxide layer is simply not equal to the task of &-uh carrying a &~signif a significant load .
&-uh and I think by now we see on the basis of the &-uh those those curves those three wear rates that &-uh with no oxide or oxygen present we're on the way to &-uh &-uh a short life or early failure and so any surfaces that survive you gotta say well there must be some oxygen getting in there to form new oxide .
&-uh and then if we add &-um &-uh other things to the oil this stuff must get in there too .
so we're faced I think with a &-um chemical kinetics issue &-um new surfaces are on the way to failure from &-uh the kickoff of the game .
how do they survive ?
or in other words what is the mechanism of break+in of sliding surfaces ?
most surfaces we deal with are inadequate to the task to start with how do they end up surviving if &-uh they don't have the proper antibodies in them to prevent failure ?
well I I I portray that in a certain fashion on the front of the textbook on the front of the textbook is a graph .
and the &-uh graph is &-uh +//.
on the abscissa is time and &-uh on the ordinate is something else .
well &-uh on the ordinate are &-uh two curves and one of them is a curve that &~s &-uh &-uh that shows &-uh something like this that a surface has a a &-uh &-uh a tendency to fail as new and &~th when you start rubbing it <you are> &~consid you are already doing some damage to it so a tendency to fail increases with time +...
it's +//.
and if you don't do the right thing it's gonna fail .
but there's another curve on there that says the capability of the lubricant present is say down there when you pour that oil into the &-uh engine or transmission the capability of that lubricant is not adequate to the task as it starts .
you've gotta do some rubbing to get the right thing done .
now then you've got to rub with that oil present so that the capability of the oil catches up with and maybe exceeds the need of the part +...
this is the break+in time (0.8) so we've got two competing events taking place .
the surface is on its way to failure but the Lone Ranger comes in and rescues the part before it fails .
hm ?
(0.13) well the study of that surface dynamic is &-uh &-uh +//.
requires a certain amount of faith I suppose in &-uh what may be happening on the surface but I think we all believe don't we ?
that surfaces are composed of little asperities little bumps I have now put this kind of picture on the blackboard some eighty times &=laughs:multiple &-uh &=laughs and <the name> you know &-uh the preponderance alone ought to &-uh be convincing I suppose but &-um &-uh two surfaces touch each_other on little regions of contact and we're gonna see oxides floating around so forth .
now I ask you how you know that's our picture that &-uh these are bumps &-uh that &-uh knock each_other's oxides loose how else do we find oxides piles up in flakes like this ?
and we think those flakes are of the same order of thickness as the native oxide on the surface .
twenty eight or so nanometers or whatever .
&-uh that's kind_of hard to verify you see unless you get to a &~mic &-uh scanning microscope &-uh up to about ten thousand X .
&-uh but until until we see evidence to the contrary xxx we're gonna say that &-uh what happens is that &-uh contact between asperities <knocks the> &~as knocks the oxides loose .
and these oxides get shoved downstream and &-uh pile up .
well there's gonna be some over here that pile up over here and so on eventually as time goes by &-uh you'll have more and more of these oxides all ready to &-uh &-uh to prevent severe contact by some passing marauding asperity .
that's the hypothesis now how do you verify or prove this ?
well the common metallurgical tools don't work and &-uh &-uh this was the &-uh &-uh a low point in my my time being a metallurgist &-uh you can do a hardness test and what does that tell you hm ?
what does the hardness test tell you on this surface right here ?
well you know the hardness test penetrates that deep it doesn't tell you anything about what goes on on the surface .
&=laughs:multiple &-uh you can look at that with a microscope an optical microscope and &-uh you don't see those you can't tell what's in those flakes huh ?
you can clean everything off &-um with solvents and so forth and &-uh use a scanning electron microscope but by the time you clean everything off with the solvents you've already taken the oxide off and so you don't see the evidence there either hm ?
in the nineteen late sixties and seventies &-uh several people were working on this problem including myself and we would get to these conferences and everybody would &~sa see different things .
&-uh nobody reported oxides on the surface but we all reported &-uh &-uh &-uh the different residues of the different solvents we were using .
&=laughs:multiple ultimately and &-uh &-uh that's because you know back in that day scanning microscopes were nice and new and you dare not introduce a single atom of chlorine into a microscope in that day .
half an atom maybe but certainly not a complete atom you know ?
&=laughs:multiple and &-uh &-uh +//.
but then as time went by the &~miscrosco microscopes got better and we were less careful about cleaning and all that we started working with dirty surfaces but by that time the cat was out_of the bag .
&-uh so there there was no good way to observe this &-uh phenomenon and &-uh at the same time I was carrying on some work on corrosion and I was intrigued by an instrument called an ellipsometer .
and &-uh that corrosion people use +...
and any chemist worth his salt will say don't use an ellipsometer it produces ambiguous results you get more confused than enlightened with it don't even look at an ellipsometer .
is that &-uh roughly the attitude of the chemists ?
roughly ?
roughly huh ?
hm and it is true .
I mean the &-uh +//.
it's a pretty cruddy instrument to use but I must say for this kind of work the rest of them are worse .
&=laughs:multiple &-uh now the ellipsometer is a device that +...
&-um &-uh it's been long time used in in corrosion work .
&-uh and I'll just describe roughly how it works .
and &-um what you do is you you &-uh you send a polarized light at a surface and if you know it's polar state &-uh then you observe what has changed upon reflection .
and that change is due to the properties of this surface the properties of index of refraction and the index of absorption kappa .
well now this requires of_course some &-uh instrumentation because you can't observe these changes of polar state with &-uh the naked eye &-uh but then this gets a little more complicated too this is now +//.
these are the properties of the substrate if you shine your ellipsometer on here you get an answer for a clean surface in a vacuum hm ?
good enough .
and now we put a coating on here and &-uh that coating will have a &-uh an index of refraction of the film plus the index of absorption of that film &-um and then of_course there's this other quantity &-uh the thickness of that film .
now &-uh this +//.
these numbers being different from this will alter this beam from what you get from just reflection from that solid and of_course the thickness matters because there's more material that you &~pa that the light passes through .
well <if you> <if you> if you already know what that stuff is on the surface a single shot with the ellipsometer will tell you what the thickness is .
now if you don't know these quantities &-uh but the surface +//.
the stuff looks kind of transparent you say well at the moment we'll set that to be zero but then we'll do the measurements at two different angles and from that you can get the thickness and the index of refraction of that film .
if you don't know this do three measurements either angle or colors of light .
and &~s by +//.
that means that the corrosion people have &~s slain many dragons have &-uh worked out the rate of corrosion of surfaces &-uh now the beauty of all this is this can be done under liquid .
and &-uh this finally is &-uh &~i it makes more sense than trying to do an experiment clean off the surface and put the part in a scanning microscope and so on down the line watch this experiment in actual environments .
you can &-uh put a slider on that surface and &-uh &~i immerse this oil &-uh and you put a tube &-uh &-uh &-uh a glass &~t or any old tube with a glass window here like that so the light can &-uh enter the fluid and leave the fluid &-uh through a lens that's perpendicular to the path the optical &=break_in_recording .
but &-uh apparently &-uh you know better get at it &-uh tis breaktime
