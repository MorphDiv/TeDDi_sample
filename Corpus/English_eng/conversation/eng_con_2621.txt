one of them wanted some action .
and the other one was too scared .

the alien dog looked scarier than the aliens .
but the aliens didn't see the people .
then they saw place where they can start to live .
but the people they like to go there everyday .
so the aliens stole their place .
the aliens didn't even know about the people .
they said to each_other how could we get there with all those

<if we> if we do something first and make something to get them
so they tried their idea .
their idea worked .
and they lived happily ever after
