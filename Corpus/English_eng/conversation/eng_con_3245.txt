okay, in you go . 0_6945
take your hats off . 6945_9210
good morning, year eight . 9210_35628
okay, write down the answers to these please . 35628_40766
yes, Daniel . 40766_41936
um, what time are we gonna come back from computing ? 41936_45665
three o'clock . 45665_46530
first one +... 46530_54645
nine sevens +... 54645_56701
three eights +... 56701_59495
thirty two divided by four +... 59495_63256
negative six plus nine +... 63256_68175
three times negative nine +... 68175_72246
a mathematical formula for the mean +... 72246_77840
a formula for the area of a circle +... 77840_86985
simplify four X all cubed . 86985_96885
and three quarters of sixteen . 96885_116645
here are your answers +... 116645_126706
sixty three, twenty four, eight, negative six plus nine, positive three, three times negative nine, negative twenty seven . 126706_140330
the formula for the mean: sigma f@l x@l on sigma f@l . 140330_144825
area of a circle, pi r@l squared . 144825_149490
four x@l all cubed simplified . 149490_154063
four cubed is ? 154063_155528
sixty four . 155528_157770
sixty four x@l cubed . 157770_159688
and three quarters of sixteen . 159688_162838
one quarter of sixteen ? 162838_164063
four . 164063_166013
so three quarters ? 166013_166743
twelve . 166743_167703
twelve . 167703_167996
mark the number . 167996_168743
slayed you . 168743_175455
what happened ? 175455_177325
which one caused the difficulty ? 177325_179293
xxx . 179293_184960
twenty five . 184960_186428
four x@l all cubed . 186428_187453
yeah . 187453_187891
okay, don't forget, if you've got that situation where something is all cubed, both the numerical coefficient as well as the variable has to be cubed, yeah ? 187891_197653
so what does four cubed mean ? 197653_199581
four by four by four . 199581_201123
four four multiplied by itself three times . 201123_203723
so four fours is sixteen, times four, sixty four . 203723_207628
okay, nine . 207628_209441
eight . 209441_211895
and less than eight . 211895_214798
okay, any questions about them ? 214798_217425
all right, here's the story . 217425_222311
my wife bakes hot chocolate chip cookies, which I like . 222311_231301
but lately, the number of cookies or the number of chocolate chips in the cookie +... 231301_242606
has been decreasing . 242606_246125
we're going to simulate an experiment here whereby we have to find out how many chocolate chips I've got to put into a mixture to create six cookies +... 246125_264113
which you have on that sheet that I've given you so that I can be pretty sure that each cookie is going to end up with at least three, yes ? 264113_274828
now, anyone got any ideas as to how many chocolate chips I would have to put into my mixture so that I would end up with at least three in each cookie ? 274828_288095
eighteen ? 288095_289425
eighteen . 289425_290256
what about if I had eighteen now, they're mixed up in this mixture for the six cookies are you sure that each time you scoop out some of that mixture, you're gonna get three ? 290256_301035
so you you're riding on the bare minimum there, aren't you ? 301035_305111
you're hoping you're hoping that you're going to get three each scoop . 305111_310465
what we're going to do is this little simulation exercise and it's just to gather some statistical data so we can carry on with our statistics . 310465_318801
you're gonna work in pairs . 318801_320441
one person's going to roll the dice . 320441_322791
the number of the dice indicates the cookie and your cookies are numbered one to six . 322791_329570
for example if I rolled a five that means I've got one chocolate chip for cookie number five . 329570_336543
you're going to have to roll the dice sufficient times to end up with a minimum of three chocolate chips in each cookie . 336543_345093
do you understand ? 345093_346648
yeah . 346648_347168
okay . 347168_347825
Tim, I'll help you, seeing you who's away today ? 347825_350973
Renee . 350973_352230
Renee, thank you . 352230_353023
all right . 353023_354343
so you know what to do ? 354343_356095
one person's rolling the die . 356095_357760
each time that number comes up, you put a stroke into your cookie . 357760_364088
now, it may be that you end up with ten chocolate chips in cookie number five . 364088_368621
that doesn't matter . 368621_369215
okay, here we go . 369215_371631
three +... 371631_372005

one . 393853_396165
can you continue ? 396165_397508
do you understand what you're doing ? 397508_400653
good . 400653_401690
don't forget you've gotta end up with a minimum of three in each . 401690_406860
roll it quickly . 406860_408741
we want to get this started to together . 408741_411026
roll it faster . 411026_411715
roll it quickly . 411715_413708
we want to get this started . 413708_415125
would you roll it properly please . 415125_422921
roll it properly . 422921_431763
sorry . 431763_432505
hurry up, get your cookies done . 432505_446410
I've got it . 446410_447810
who's finished ? 447810_457425
do we roll it we roll until each xxx three ? 457425_459058
you must keep rolling until every cookie has got three chocolate chips in it . 459058_463906
our dice has got all these dots in it . 463906_467368
don't worry, continue . 467368_471296
no, not yet . 471296_474775
hurry up, Josh . 474775_485226

well done . 487625_489135
any group not ? 489135_495391
yeah . 495391_496365
once you have finished, count up the total number of cookies or sorry, the total number of chocolate chips that you required to get three chocolate chips into each cookie . 496365_512841
mitch, have you finished ? 512841_524501
no, we're unlucky . 524501_526725
