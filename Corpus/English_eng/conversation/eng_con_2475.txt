that is also ambiguous, right ? 255980_258060
I mean . 255980_258060
&=breath . 255980_258060

yeah . 275760_276430
uh@fp yeah . 278040_279010
so your customers can see how you smell, huh ? 281430_283190

yeah, right . 286620_287490
&=laugh . 289790_291340
but yeah, I mean, we're but we're supposed to aim it
so +//. 293230_297900
right, so we're not targeting the companies who have to uh@fp +//.
yeah, but if you have a home homepage for example, you might

nope . 313740_314850
that is true . 313740_314850
right, we assume that is some sort of advanced scripting tag
right . 318920_319440
and they don't want to try that smell &=laugh before . 321560_327860
&=breath okay, so the end+user will be the one who wants to smell .
I don't know . 325010_326020
&=breath . 325010_326020
yes . 327970_328520
mhm . 328100_328700
hm@fp okay . 328340_328930
can we change the product a little bit, or can we put some features
&=smack <well, we can for example> I mean, we will have an on

yeah, yeah, you need that . 344430_346630
well you also &=breath +//. 344430_346630
you need a filter, yes . 349010_352000
a neutralizer button, &=breath to uh@fp +//. 349010_352000
some &=smack something like, that you say ok@i I like
&=smack and we just leave it open &=laugh &=smack what is good and
&=breath &=smack &=laugh . 351510_360790
&=laugh . 357060_359320
yes . 359640_360370
you can customize it . 361320_363180
what about that ? 361320_363180
sure . 363960_364620
do you guys think that this should be marketed as a serious

oh, that is right . 380910_382800
yeah . 380910_382800
&=laugh I don't know . 381150_383590
business related ? 381150_383590
well, yeah . 385190_387340
I mean, there is frivolous uses for this . 385190_387340
hey, thanks a lot . 388070_389290
so, we should +//. 390100_390830
yeah, well, there are a few products <that would have to>
I mean, you know . 390770_411570
like, who was it, xxx you know, for perfume marketers, for
&=breath uhm@fp but and for the user, I think it is useful, in

&=smack it is a toy . 412560_414900
&=laugh . 412560_414900
<there is not> I mean, yeah, I guess it is important for

well, right, yes, I mean yeah . 425180_437390
I mean, what <what i@i> what how do most people use
&=breath to surf, to play games . 425180_437390
mhm . 435310_435900
oh, yeah, games, I mean, that would be great thing . 439150_448440
if, you for example, <you had> you're playing what about,
&=laugh . 439150_448440
oh, yeah . 441530_442700
Doom . 444340_450290
&=breath you can smell the sulphur . 444340_450290
&=breath hell, yeah . 444340_450290
that that &=breath +//. 444340_450290

&=laugh . 450320_451100
smell the burning flesh when you're using the flamethrower, you

yeah, or or or the sports games, you know . 454600_457430
&=laugh . 455620_456410
mhm . 457770_458360
well, that <that is a> yeah, <that is a> that is an

and for +//. 459090_464070
&=laugh . 459190_460020
shopping ? 464660_465170
for browsing, hes@fp yes . 465190_467160
mhm . 466650_467160
the game industry is probably more important, 'cause it is a lot
a lot more money . 470930_472190
&=breath . 470930_472190
so, for example, if you go hunting, you might smell your &=smack
what is it ? 475980_490590
yeah . 479860_480430
further . 490400_490950
further than the screen+shot . 491020_493070
yeah . 493280_493840
right . 494200_494730
what if &=breath &=noise +//. 495210_496430
then you need a strong I_Smell, because you m@i must be

it is +//. 497620_499980
&=laugh mystery games could be, you know, the solve the

right . 504690_505310
and it must be possible to regulate the the intensity of the
yeah . 510750_515100
&=breath well, so +//. 510750_515100
it is like a volume knob on a speaker . 514690_516330
mhm . 515920_516450
so, are there any other markets, besides the two that we
the porn industry ? 521490_522890
&=laugh . 521490_522890
well, that usually does drive technology, right ? 523500_526440
but +//. 523500_526440
&=laugh . 523610_527220
&=laugh not bad . 524190_527710
&=laugh . 524190_527710
&=laugh . 525700_527740
I don't know that uh@fp +//. 528370_530020
do we wanna advertise that ? 529270_530770
&=laugh . 529270_530770
&=laugh probably not, I guess . 531200_535650
&=breath it is a big industry . 531200_535650
&=laugh . 531460_533910
uh+huh . 535250_535960
it is the reason for streaming video . 536970_538680
&=breath . 536970_538680
could be the reason for I_Smell . 540330_541840
&=laugh doubtful . 541680_553490
I don't know, <I might pay to> I might pay money to have
maybe we can put it a different way . 541910_543890
&=laugh . 541910_543890
&=laugh . 550210_551170
&=laugh . 554440_556440
&=laugh . 554910_556670
depending on what country it is from, I mean . 556520_558630
&=laugh . 558340_559060
&=laugh . 558420_559620
or maybe you can plug it into your PDA, and then you have the

you can <give your sc@i> &=laugh give your &=breath your

yes, yes . 567780_570030
&=laugh . 569970_571470
oh, yeah . 574440_575110
so it must be portable . 575040_576520
yeah, how big is the I_Smell ? 578150_579340
it is small . 580100_581200
hm@fp . 580100_581200
you can have the I_Smell_Junior <that fits on> xxx &=laugh
&=laugh &=breath super . 583010_598270
&=laugh oh, yeah . 583010_598270
now we have <the I_Pac compact and> or the I_Smell compact . 583010_598270
&=laugh . 583010_598270
here we go . 583090_588490
&=laugh . 583090_588490
&=laugh . 587100_588080
&=laugh . 593870_594600
mhm . 596570_597010
yeah . 597790_598810
and then we have the powerful I_Smell wi@i with the really
yeah . 606320_607140
&=breath . 606320_607140
for uh@fp auditoriums, or something . 612410_614480
so, yeah . 612750_613840
it is all so unnecessary . 613180_615250
then yeah, and then we are at the same thing <with the>
<then you> then you can also market it to to moviegoers .
yeah . 619910_622410
and even to pop+stars . 619910_622410
but then it is not like an Internet thing . 621040_623980
it is +//. 621040_623980
well, right . 623870_624550
well, you can hook it up . 625160_626160
well, it depends . 625320_629700
I mean, movies are gonna be delivered <over the> over the net
and all the pop+stars can have really nice smells during their
&=laugh . 633820_634500
so . 637540_651860
gamers . 637540_651860
shoppers . 637540_651860
&=breath can you target both of these people with the same ad,
&=breath I would say no . 637540_651860
think so . 650900_651590
one might be predominantly women, and the other might be
right . 655140_655700
shop@i shopping over the inter@i Internet is
are you sure about that ? 660210_664350
no, I'm not sure . 664540_666140
uhm@fp . 664540_666140
well, <it is> it is gonna be +//. 667000_668040
I just assume so, because &=laugh +//. 667540_670620
sh@i shopping for perfume probably is . 668090_670180
well +//. 671200_671970
maybe not . 671880_672470
&=smack I learned last time that it is uhm@fp hm@fp a typical male
really ? 677840_678440
well, I guess that makes sense . 679810_682250
or +//. 679810_682250
and it is so nasty buying perfume for men, because, I mean, they
&=laugh &=breath and you can't say anything because it is a gift .
&=laugh &=breath so, maybe you want to buy it over the Internet
yeah . 687430_688100
hm . 691730_692460
yeah . 701210_702070
&=breath . 701210_702070
so what type of thing ? 708280_712740
print ? 708280_712740
&=breath television ad ? 708280_712740
people spending lots of time in front of their computer . 713230_717000
the advantage of a print ad, I suppose, would be that you could
you can't do that over tv . 717890_727580
hm@fp yeah . 724140_724710
&=breath . 724140_724710
hm . 724470_725060
right . 728370_728840
so that, <it is a people we're really> they don't
<they just> they prefer to stay at home, in their room . 731580_741440
they are young . 755950_756700
yeah, so . 761790_775990
&=breath &=smack yeah, so, I think the easiest might be to do
someone playing, you know, &=breath some first+person+shooter,
&=smack yeah . 776210_776570
and uh@fp +//. 781170_782170
wow, what is that ? 784050_785100
refried+beans, or black+beans, or whatever for dipping on . 785630_788920
how you doing with xxx +//. 789270_790260
in the game magazine ? 789790_794100
but this only goes for the gamers, not for the shoppers . 789790_794100
y@i yeah . 790630_791420
right, right . 792730_805340
so, you hm@fp maybe you have two . 792730_805340
&=breath &=smack 'cause, I think i@i it is gonna be tough to
&=breath you know ? 792730_805340
unless you do something that is really simple . 806130_839790
&=breath it seems like, the &=breath well, the obvious thing
&=breath but, I don't know . 806130_839790
I don't know if I'm voting for that way . 806130_839790
&=laugh . 806130_839790
&=throat . 811800_812450
so, you are more thinking about something which is highly
&=smack uh@fp yeah . 847220_848120
I think +//. 847220_848120
that was my idea . 848050_857360
I mean, given that there is only t@i two such groups, I think,
&=breath but +//. 848050_857360
hm . 849060_849770
well, there might be people who want it, though we wouldn't even
&=laugh . 856170_863120
right . 860480_861000
right . 862700_863160
yeah, <I think th@i> <I think what> hes@fp with such
smell what you've been missing ? 886420_889230
yeah, I don't know . 886420_889230
hm ? 888580_889040
smell what you've been missing . 889670_891290
&=laugh . 891810_892300
your Internet experience has not been complete . 893710_895620
&=throat so, what about a commercial, &=smack like, before and
so, <what is the> what is the before and after conditions ? 913760_916540
well, then , the the the difficult thing is that we
&=breath <so even we> even +//. 917110_925270
<you would have to do something like> uh@fp <you would have to
or they order the I_Smell over the Internet, or something . 924560_943930
right . 942110_942590
but that doesn't give you the feeling xxx yeah . 944290_946410
well, no . 945270_951400
<and then> <and then the first thing that> &=smack so
mhm . 951480_952040
and then they plug it in, and surf to a new site, and the whole
colorful ? 956210_956840
yeah, so now the sensory experience is more complete, right ? 956600_960340
it is +//. 956600_960340
right . 959440_959920
mhm . 961340_961910
&=smack I mean, in the tv ad, there is no way to convey smell,
<so I mean it is the kind of> &=smack hm@fp &=breath use color
&=laugh . 962020_970010
right . 971470_971940
so, the thing is, can can we assume here &=swallow that we
oh, forget about . 972400_988290
&=smack or <or we can> hes@fp <would we> if we put
so, you could have a similar thing in a magazine, that is also
right . 997250_997710
mhm . 998190_998670
like a two page ad, or something . 1003200_1004740
right . 1004590_1005130
we could even go further &=smack <and give the black and white>
you know . 1007820_1019190
mhm . 1019450_1020050
xxx P_D_P_eleven, even better . 1022170_1024630
uh+huh . 1025890_1031020
yeah . 1025890_1031020
even without Internet . 1025890_1031020
&=laugh . 1025890_1031020
right, I mean the whole thing . 1032500_1035870
&=smack if we could coul@i +//. 1032500_1035870
what about somebody playing Pac_Man on an Apple . 1035280_1040460
<what is that> xxx <or an I@i> &=smack oh +//. 1035280_1040460
do we still have that Macintosh ? 1039760_1041100

&=laugh . 1049200_1052030
&=laugh . 1054190_1055200
yeah, so let us +//. 1055550_1056840
so, you have somebody xxx sitting in front of this antiquated piece
right . 1059790_1060360
obviously bored with life . 1060430_1061850
&=smack yep . 1061860_1062360
mhm . 1062500_1063030
'cause his or her Internet experiences is woefully incomplete .
playing &=smack playing a two+dimensional &=smack P@i
right . 1067750_1068330
and then, all of a sudden, you know &=breath &=smack there is
color . 1073550_1083180
smell . 1073550_1083180
or we do it like an evolution . 1084040_1105870
first we have this Pac_Man on the Apple, and then we have uhm@fp
and then we have really, like, Doom or something else . 1084040_1105870
&=smack and then we have smell . 1084040_1105870
&=smack <what is that> how is that ? 1084040_1105870
hm@fp &=breath actually, I don't know if the game is is really
right ? 1105530_1112560
I mean &=breath +//. 1105530_1112560
right . 1112760_1113220
I think, just, old equipment, bored looking person . 1113280_1117440
if you go with the game, then you sort of &=smack lose the shopping
so, &=smack if you do the whole &=smack transformation into color
yeah . 1123300_1123890
hm@fp okay . 1130620_1131290
&=throat . 1130720_1131200
if we've gotta come up with one ad, you know, then you would have a
right . 1137550_1137960
is one of our our uhm@fp &=smack goal here just to come up
xxx oh, she is not there . 1147220_1150480
hm . 1149380_1149800
&=smack I'm not sure if we have to describe the ad, or actually
well, I mean, she gave us s@i s@i stuff to work with,
so . 1152850_1156050
&=smack I mean, <we can p@i> we can play the ad . 1152990_1160660
we can use the Apple, to have uh@fp Pac_Man stuff on it . 1152990_1160660
&=breath or is it still running ? 1152990_1160660
right . 1155360_1155810
but <we need black> we need black and white film to
no . 1160980_1162310
&=laugh no . 1160980_1162310
uh+huh . 1162880_1163510
<it is> yeah . 1164150_1175450
wh@i uh@fp we would need black and white film . 1164150_1175450
perhaps a print concept would be uh@fp &=breath would be more
right . 1170400_1170800
or, <we can> <we can even> I mean, we can play it . 1174830_1190850
one is playing the really bore bored people in front of the
woo+hoo . 1186750_1187390
&=laugh . 1188910_1189940
behind the Pontiff, there, yeah . 1190040_1191720
&=smack and clicking in the Internet, and &=smack and playing,
&=breath and then we we build a small, neon blue box and put
it is +//. 1196930_1197460
I still think we would need the the concept part, 'cause
&=breath and if you can't show the black and white part of the
oh, no, we're just playing it in front of the judge, is all . 1216290_1220860
isn't it ? 1216290_1220860
I mean, we can +//. 1216290_1220860
&=throat . 1216890_1217540
yeah, but they they still wouldn't get that sensory uh@fp
&=breath &=noise . 1220390_1224920
right, right . 1222080_1223410
I mean +//. 1222080_1223410
right . 1224330_1224880
they wouldn't get that, okay, we're in black and white, now . 1226270_1230070
so, we can say it . 1226270_1230070
hm, okay . 1229310_1231100
that is right . 1229310_1231100
yeah, I mean, I suppose, <isn't it> <with the whole> with
they could be sitting in front of an old computer, listening to
m@i mono, or whatever . 1232400_1249250
and then the music becomes nice and +//. 1232400_1249250
yes . 1242420_1243070
or even +//. 1245880_1246750
yeah, <the old> the old tone music . 1247690_1253660
&=breath boop@n, boop@n, boop@n, boop@n, boop@n . 1247690_1253660
right, right . 1249670_1250550
oh , God . 1253060_1253750
yes . 1253930_1259980
<I just> <I just downloaded> uh@fp I just started playing
mhm . 1258170_1258720
mhm . 1259610_1260140
and it is exactly like that . 1260740_1262240
&=laugh . 1260740_1262240
yep . 1261950_1262380
yeah, so how are we gonna present that ? 1268250_1270000
so, I don't know . 1269240_1270360
I mean, I like that +//. 1269240_1270360
hm ? 1270670_1270960
I I said, I guess I like &=smack this idea, as far as an ad
yeah . 1278100_1283620
&=breath well, yeah, I mean, hes@fp just like the McIntosh ads in
right . 1283670_1284150
I mean, <we know> we know who &=breath makes best use <of a>
&=breath . 1284140_1293700
right . 1290200_1290630
right . 1292830_1293230
well, the good thing on this is that we've &=throat we might
I mean, we we it took us at least five to ten minutes
so maybe there are more we just didn't think of . 1302250_1315790
yeah . 1312420_1313160
right . 1317750_1318210
but how do we present that ? 1325910_1334990
hes@fp &=smack I mean, if we stick with this idea, how do we
do we present two pictures, or do we just tell the story ? 1325910_1334990
or do we play it, or +//. 1325910_1334990
hm@fp yeah, hes@fp I think that is what we do . 1333480_1353630
I think we take that sketchbook &=breath and make, like, a mock+up
&=breath and find some way to make half of it smell . 1333480_1353630
&=breath &=laugh I mean &=breath rub popcorn in it, or something .
I don't know . 1333480_1353630
&=laugh . 1348000_1349480
so you saying we do two pictures, one in black and white and the
yeah . 1363150_1365930
though I mean, yeah . 1363150_1365930
what are the pictures of ? 1369040_1370220
so, I guess one picture would be of a person sitting in front
you know, black and white gray pants, white shirt, thin
perhaps one of them in glasses . 1370290_1394320
&=breath <this is hard> getting hard to draw . 1370290_1394320
&=laugh . 1392380_1393270
&=laugh . 1393490_1394990
yeah . 1394470_1396310
do we have the ability to draw that ? 1394470_1396310
yeah . 1396210_1417480
no, of course not . 1396210_1417480
uhm@fp &=breath and the next picture is, you know, <the sam@i>
with a &=breath you know, uhm@fp &=breath well . 1396210_1417480
&=breath shit, <we can> we can go on the web and get pictures
sorry ? 1417710_1418220
we can get onto the web and download these pictures . 1418110_1425100
a history of computing site, we could have somebody sitting in
probably could, yeah . 1418920_1420130
right . 1424010_1424510
mhm . 1424560_1425880
yeah . 1424560_1425880
uhm@fp so, perhaps we should start looking for some of those . 1426290_1435200
&=breath uh@fp but the second picture in color, <nicer com@i>
&=breath . 1426290_1435200
&=smack I would say younger, and hm@fp three people maybe,
people obviously having a better time . 1436820_1438890
younger . 1436820_1438890
yes . 1439410_1445170
and then we rub some interesting smell into the page . 1439410_1445170
I don't &=laugh +//. 1439410_1445170
mhm . 1441230_1441800
&=laugh . 1444190_1445660
&=laugh . 1444840_1445550
it seems more like a commercial for, like, the I_Mac itself . 1445770_1453330
it is going from, like, a beige computer to a colored one . 1445770_1453330
well, right . 1452270_1454380
well i@i +//. 1452270_1454380
it doesn't really convey +//. 1453780_1455220
<if you have to make the IS@i> you would have to make the
&=breath and &=breath +//. 1455220_1461470
yeah, the I_Smell has to p@i prominent in the picture . 1457710_1459960
I don't think it quite says what <what the >
&=laugh . 1462430_1469540
well &=smack we don't care what the product does . 1466650_1471900
we just want people to buy it, right ? 1466650_1471900
I mean &=laugh +//. 1466650_1471900
&=laugh right . 1470770_1472070
well +//. 1470770_1472070
&=smack no, no, it is not that easy . 1472050_1473620
&=laugh . 1472050_1473620
if you buy this product, your life becomes a party, right ? 1472530_1476360
I mean, well that is what most advertising is . 1472530_1476360
yes . 1477210_1477820
but, I don't know . 1479280_1487250
I it just seems like uhm@fp the general, or usual,
well, they buy Windows . 1488180_1493510
I mean . 1488180_1493510
no, sorry . 1488180_1493510
&=laugh . 1488180_1493510
oh, you mean it is just too simple ? 1493560_1501380
just hes@fp to say it is this black and white, without s@i
or +//. 1493560_1501380
I think that is, like, a advertising trap . 1500780_1509280
&=laugh I think it is, like, the easy way out . 1500780_1509280
&=laugh . 1500780_1509280
hm@fp okay . 1509700_1510300
I think that we could come up with something more clever . 1510270_1514910
<that appeals to> I don't know . 1510270_1514910
well &=breath +//. 1516500_1517190
but, I mean, <the critical thing> as I said before, the
right . 1526640_1527170
we don't even +//. 1528120_1528880
<well yeah> well, that that is the reason we wanna go for
so, tha@i that is &=breath you know, but <that doesn't>
it just says what medium we're gonna do it in, right ? 1528260_1549650
so, &=breath I don't know, what would you suggest, then ? 1528260_1549650
for &=breath +//. 1528260_1549650
yeah . 1528740_1529480
<well I think whatever uhm@fp advertisement we do is gonna have
I think something filled with at least slight humor would
&=breath and also something that has to do with smell . 1548980_1620110
not just, like, this is a new piece of a equipment, it is newer and
but, you know, that doesn't really say anything about what
&=breath and I think that the, like, black and white to color idea
&=breath <I think something> there has to be something
right . 1563040_1563440
&=laugh okay . 1619630_1621490
so okay, so <how about> how about two people chatting,
&=breath and uhm@fp he looks just awful, just f@i out of the
&=breath and she just tol@i told him that she bought an
so, he is <looks real@i> xxx looks really great and smells
what about that ? 1620360_1652120
&=laugh . 1620360_1652120
get a load of this . 1628650_1630400
yes . 1628650_1630400
&=laugh . 1636620_1638560
&=laugh . 1637220_1638200
well +//. 1653350_1654010
no ? 1657640_1658080
I don't know . 1658240_1683060
<I mean y@i> yeah . 1658240_1683060
hes@fp I mean, projecting a false identity, I guess, is a
so &=breath this helps . 1658240_1683060
uh@fp I don't know, is that too subtle ? 1658240_1683060
<is that> is the chat+room user market too small ? 1658240_1683060
hm@fp do most people find them strange and not wanna be like
I mean +//. 1658240_1683060
mhm . 1666040_1666530
&=smack you mean uhm@fp that that would just sell the story to
or +//. 1684880_1688720
uhm@fp I don't know . 1688490_1719990
I don't know how many people <use cha@i> <use their>
an@i <I mean, you see people> I mean, chat+rooms are
&=breath right ? 1688490_1719990
&=swallow like the uh@fp the digital+cable versus uhm@fp
&=laugh . 1719880_1720800
&=breath &=noise &=laugh . 1722010_1723980
I don't know . 1722410_1739930
&=breath so, I mean, uh@fp people have <used it> used that
uhm@fp <but I don't know if it is> uh@fp &=breath I
&=breath . 1722410_1739930
is there an &=breath a famous game you can play uh@fp over the

name that smell ? 1745880_1748010
no . 1745880_1748010
huh ? 1747330_1751140
so that we can do the same story, but with people playing a game ?
I can name that smell in five particles per billion . 1749650_1752760
&=breath . 1749650_1752760
&=laugh . 1752470_1753920
&=laugh . 1752540_1753370
I can name that smell in four . 1755120_1759670
&=breath name that smell . 1755120_1759670
&=breath &=noise I don't know . 1755120_1759670
&=laugh . 1756620_1757640
I mean, we should try to come up with some kind of s@i slogan
'cause it is easy to, like, insert that into some kind of
or it is easy to build an ad around it . 1783280_1784970
&=breath . 1783280_1784970
yeah . 1784440_1785160
