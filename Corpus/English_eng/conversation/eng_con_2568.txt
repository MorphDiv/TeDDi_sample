yeah .
so there's no .
I have no idea .
who's doing five then ?
you doing four ?
&=laughs .
huh ?
you doing four ?
yeah xxx just started on it .
that's a pretty xxx .
we're stuck at the end . 30315_42335
<yeah it's orange juice> .
what is it ?
xxx .
xxx .
lead bromate .
just hafta be pretty much &-uh xxx .
replace .
xxx .
I think I saw your roommate .
is he a large xxx tall ?
kind_of xxx .
&-uh he's he's kinda tall .
is he built like you a little ?
&-uh xxx .
yeah .
&-uh xxx .
oh really ?
yeah .
<oh here we got started bad> what had happened was that we were getting no reaction .
SML xxx maybe in the computer room .
yeah .
no reaction .
we got what we found is that &-uh when you mix the sodium hydroxide and xxx you get a white precipitate and then just we were just like <fixing the> xxx and so we found we got white precipitate but then we add the potassium chromium to it the white precipitate xxx so we +//.
we're guessing that &-uh the white precipitate xxx .
what am I doing ?
I don't know .
God only knows .
like is our liquid clear or is our liquid's clear . 88715_92235
so I guess it kinda hasta be thick . 92595_97355
well let's filter it okay ? 97735_99235
all all of these reactions . 99235_102475
are <you going> on four now ?
halfway the first step is you get a queue xxx .
yep .
<what we're> what we're guessing is that like xxx is &-uh better xxx .
okay ? 105435_106235
yeah . 111675_111695
excuse_me .
I'm done with mine so if you want some help I mean . 112235_117415
well .
I don't have anything to do . 117215_119715
&-um is it right ? 120995_121995
⌈ oh boy ⌉ .
⌊ yeah I looked ⌋ it up I think it's right . 122995_124395
okay &-um well <you can> you can did you ask is Shannon done ? 124875_132375
&~yea no he's not but he's all confused and he's like stressed out on it . 132495_137135
aah you could kinda chill I guess .
and then xxx <potassium bromate> and then when you <put it> all together you have xxx result xxx put together and got sixty percent xxx ⌈ is that the &-uh bromates xxx ⌉ . 141655_147195
⌊ what are we ⌋ at Nick ?
⌈ no precipitate ⌉ .
⌊ no reaction ⌋ .
alright I was ⌈ right <lordy God> ⌉ .
praise the lord .
⌊ <CSO four> xxx ⌋ .
CSO four plus SN CO .
that should be a precipitate .
oh man .
okay you're doing <work right> ?
here's your &-uh reagent sheet .
with all the reagents ⌈ on it xxx <the back for the reactions> ⌉ .
⌊ that won't do it ⌋ .
NH three makes it turn like purple with yellow polka dots I think we've got it . 187165_189565
alright so add NH three to the end result ? 189905_192005
what ?
so add NH three &~t ⌈ as the third ⌉ okay . 192265_195845
⌊ yeah to the ⌋ to the halfway mark (0.9) .
hey <Ani Ani> &=laughs .
fuck you &=laughs:SUm .
test tube do you have any test tubes <left here> ?
&-uh I think so .
so <we're filtering> we're filtering out our precipitate .
see the results xxx .
yeah .
so this is the same as this . 224995_226455
right ? 227215_227615
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.

all the possible xxx . 237695_238135
xxx these in cold water . 239415_240075
hot +//.
we have to put it in we have to put our solid in the hot water . 240695_243815
wait .
that <if that's> ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
xxx soluble ⌊ it's insoluble in cold water ⌋ . 244395_248535
right so it's not it so right now it's a solid . 248535_251615
like right now we have precipitate (be)cause our water's cold . 252725_254865
I've got five molar . 255125_256145
&=laughs:SUm .
⌈ okay or if it's tin nitrate what ⌉ . 258605_265145
⌊ xxx you can do it with yours ⌋ and do yours in hot water I'll do mine in cold water . 266465_281545
cold ?

xxx so &-um you're saying that you saw purple with the hexate right ?
<yeah we did> xxx .
so .
okay no you <hadta be> ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ ooh ⌋ . 283365_283605
I'm tired of counting to forty . 283885_285905
alright if we've got five molar how many drops do we add ?
xxx five what ?
isn't chromate CR two ?
&{l=SINGING you are the answer &}l=SINGING .
no I guess not .
xxx gonna be ⌈ something xxx ⌉ in here .
⌊ Brian ⌋ ?
<we want> if we heat up <the original> the original like solution xxx . 286845_313165
xxx .
(be)cause one was ⌈ soluble ⌉ +/.

what are you guys doing with hot water and stuff ?
trying to get out a precipitate . 328235_329515
oh: .
I hope I don't hafta go through all that .
<you finished> &-um you finished both of yours already ? 330435_339875

man we shoulda done it by section &=laughs .
that's what I was seriously about to say . 371325_380985

well look it's basically all in the test tube anyway as long as the water's clean it doesn't matter +... 418955_425275
right ?
hey is this water really hot ?
no .
I don't know .
well it's a little warm .
that water gets hot xxx .
alright so what were they saying ?
they were saying that .
they told me it was a better Lewis base than .
than NAOH ?
yeah .
okay .
but they didn't test that and I think &~th we didn't either . 427095_429975
I don't know if we do because <we know> we know what the product is . 431305_435085

are you sure it gets it hot +//. 452845_453565
it gets hot enough ?
I mean .
it probably doesn't get hot enough xxx .
<what was that> ?
it doesn't get hot enough .
well we've gotta let it run for a minute . 458465_461285

xxx compulsory for the hypothesis as to the xxx okay &-um hypothesis xxx .
this is not hot . 512295_513175
okay you were right so this doesn't heat up but <this isn't good> . 514335_532075
<it does> .
xxx we're heating it up .
turning it on high man .
do you need your pipettes anymore Catie ? 532275_534895

do you have water ?
no . 535135_535575
<not good> not good .
so xxx .
this has gotta go .
that was probably not a good idea was it ? 570795_572855
(0.6) .
okay I'm gonna add hot water to ⌊ this okay ⌋ ? 573975_579815
⌈ anyone ⌉ who didn't hear xxx the first reaction got a precipitate . 579875_583115

you know the FE two reaction ?

no .
they're getting precipitates ⌊ I think you have to xxx ⌋ . 592295_594475
no it's the water . 594475_595555
it's the water it might be the water . 596135_597555
it's the &~b xxx water xxx . 598185_598585
yeah but .
if your water's too basic you're gonna get a precipitate . 599025_604765
xxx the number one reaction .
⌈ their water sucks man ⌉ .
⌊ you know what we usually ⌋ like filter our water though (be)cause it xxx . 605765_611785
if they're using boxed water <that's why> .
(be)cause the boxed water's basic .
tell them to use tap water . 615305_616385
Henry what'd you say two meant ?
D decomposes .
hey Richard it doesn't <clear it up> .
did you use the right copper ?
yeah forty one ?
yeah . 648995_649275
you use the same amount .
hey <I want> hot water .
okay we heat up the water .
you are stupid why did you touch it ?
don't do anything yet . 649355_652975
okay why ? 653235_654835
(be)cause it says here that xxx nitrate +/. 655255_658295
yeah ? 660995_663635
+, decomposes .
xxx .
oh .
oh man .
it said like xxx .
so do I need this ? 664875_669715
I don't know .
well check ⌈ what happens to the copper fluoride ⌉ . 671155_672055
⌊ well I ⌋ could go ahead and try it and see . 672055_673895
hey check what happens to the copper fluoride in hot water . 674215_676255
so how are you how are you doing +//. 676665_678165
you getting the &~f the the precipitate and then ⌈ adding to water ⌉ ? 678545_682365
⌊ I was ⌋ gonna add it to hot water . 682365_683625
⌈ and what would we think would happen ⌉ ? 683985_685805
so if that's the case it should disappear . 685805_687385
right . 687885_687905
but why is it remaining if it's in lukewarm water ? 688545_691325
just that's a property of it ? 691545_693005
I mean if it's at room temperature water it remains ? 693305_695025
&-uh you know like say like you're mixing stuff like sugar and if you mix in really cold water it takes more time to dissolve ? 695325_702625
okay so +/. 702625_703225
so +/.
+, it has some property like that ? 703305_704245
like hot water has +/. 704315_705395
makes it go faster +/. 706075_707175
+, heat makes the the things go faster . 707175_710575
okay I'm gonna add it to warm water now . 711035_712695
uhuh .
ready ? 713195_714955
(0.6) .
we're not gonna get all of it done <in one day> .
mix &-um xxx I didn't I &~didn xxx .
did it remain the same +..?
I'm a little worried xxx water . 732925_733905
it's not that hot .
I thought it would be so .
was it it was like that before right ? 733905_742005
yeah .
and so the temperature of the water like doesn't affect . 742245_746925
okay well this wasn't like boiling but it was warm . 746925_748925
(0.39) .
so what do we do ? 783805_784705
we don't know what it is . 784825_786125
is there <an eraser> xxx . 786165_787505
don't joke around in the lab Nick .
it's just water .
yeah but xxx .
water's enough .
how you guys doing Ross ?
&-uh we're done with the <experimentation in> number four and then we have now ⌊ &-um Brian's finishing number three I think . 788385_813425

⌈ well we we know that nitrate is soluble why can't we just xxx ⌉ .
the precipitate's white . 813665_813785
or so xxx +/.
right xxx +/.
+, but it says that water at xxx it holds xxx .
but does it +//.
what does it exactly mean ?
does it mean like xxx .
are you done Jeremy ?
I thought .
hey did somebody do number one ? 831085_832225
for discussion you guys +/. 832305_833805
⌊ I don't know ⌋ +/.
+, alright xxx I have to break up one team for presentation . 834605_841245
(0.7) I have to break up one team for presentation does anyone volunteer or am I gonna hafta flip a coin ? 842405_852645
(0.14) .
do we get extra points xxx .
yeah of_course no one wants to break up their groups but it's just for presentation . 865325_868205
&=laughs just for a five minute presentation . 868825_870525
you know <or a> or a three minute presentation . 871385_873285
okay there are six teams . 874645_875965
I'll do it for five dollars +... 876185_877245
I'm gonna throw three pennies . 878925_881045
why don't you call like ⌈ one person call heads and tails one person calls heads heads and one person calls heads tails ⌉ . 881365_895305
⌊ <for work> there's gonna be extra there's <gonna be extra> gonna be extra data sets until xxx ⌋ .

I can't throw two pennies (be)cause that's only . 894495_896295
you can throw one and throw it twice one person calls heads heads ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 896455_899795
⌊ I'm gonna ⌋ try to pick one team to split up no one's volunteering . 899795_902795
so how does three pennies work ?
are you gonna flip three pennies and we call we each call ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ no ⌋ no I'm gonna write down what I'm gonna pick and then that's it . 904255_912135
oh .
okay .
up up up is one .
why don't we have ⌈ a mass game of rock paper scissors shoot ⌉ ?
⌊ up up down is two ⌋ &=laughs:SUm .
do you like to ⌈ play rock paper scissors shoot ⌉ ?
⌊ actually I'm going to hafta do this ⌋ with four pennies &=laughs:SUf .
what was the last one ?
shoot .
why don't you just throw one and throw it twice ? 924295_924475
one person .
because there's six teams .
you're gonna get ⌈ picked I know you're xxx ⌉ .
⌊ why don't you just throw ⌋ them all for each of us and one of us calls like oh really ?
I don't care .
it's not really a big deal .
<what is> what is she talking about ?
I don't know what she's talking about .
never mind .
&-um splitting up groups .
I don't know what she's doing .
splitting up groups xxx .
because there are too many groups ⌈ to each do a presentation xxx ⌉ . 942175_946955
⌊ alright tell tell you what ⌋ just let me do this . 947495_949975
oh .
so one groups has gotta split up .
she should probably split up our group because we only have three people .
team team two call heads or tails . 950995_954335
heads . 955415_956035
heads ? 956295_956735
you guys are tails ? 956915_957535

heads .
who won .
we won .
so whoever got heads won .
they lost twice so .
so <once we> .
so you guys called tails &=laughs:SUm .
so you guys so you guys <may get> split up . 971225_977445
heads or tails guys ?
heads or tails ?
tails .
tails ? 978085_978985
it's not fair to them (be)cause they hadta go twice . 1005395_1007095
and they had another shot xxx .
so you lost .
okay it's against you two guys to see <whose member's> pulled out .
<what if it's> a tie ? 1007535_1015715
no no xxx them against team number one .
chromate was CR four . 1016115_1021735
we're voting tails .
you're gonna vote tails ? 1021735_1022575
yeah .
chromate was CR four two .
okay &=laughs .
it landed on its side . 1022935_1029135
what ? 1029535_1030475
&=laughs:multiple .
no don't do that lemme flip it again . 1030935_1035375

it's heads .
what do you mean it landed on its side ?
it was tails the last time yo .
but it was tails over there so you got one more .
what does that mean ?
it was tails over there see .
all this means is that you guys are gonna hafta do presentations with another group . 1042805_1055485
so what ?
yall lost to every group in here <on a> &~t on a &~h coin flip ? 1056045_1059765
alright I can't break them up because one of them commutes an hour to get here . 1063945_1067205
are you telling me yall just lost every coin flip to every team in the class ? 1068425_1071605

that's horrible .
I need someone to volunteer . 1071645_1073105

no CUCL two is xxx CUCL .

oh okay .

wait what did you have ?
is it CUCL three right ?
xxx makes sense and then the CUNO three is definitely xxx CUCL . 1689545_1694945
