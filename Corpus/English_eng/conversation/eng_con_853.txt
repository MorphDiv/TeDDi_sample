&~www .
there's this girl in my class called Sadie , who I think (i)s quite
and she likes to hang around with a person , who I'm not going to
and <he's very> he seems very nice .
I've met him before .
but she's so full of herself +...
and she <she always> if you wanna put it +...
she always like brags about it .
and I wouldn't brag about someone that's older than <a w(oman)>
and you don't know what they could do +...
but I just think it's really annoying because she's just so full of
and she doesn't really realize the what could actually happen
and I just think it's stupid because <she doesn't> she doesn't
she just hangs around with him because he's older .
and she knows she can get attention for it .
