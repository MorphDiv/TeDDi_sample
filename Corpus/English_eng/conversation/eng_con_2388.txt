two machines running at the same time . 20_1780
like he suggested . 1950_3100
what do you mean by that . 3350_3990
like the one computer that's in the room and yours . 4040_7660
and just like switch . 7860_8630
I think what he meant was &-um you have two different screens . 10680_13910
like you load up Explorer two times . 14980_16190
oh or that what . 17210_18620
and then load . 19230_19670
exploratories . 19720_20390
like once you have everything in one screen you have everything
&-um well the thing is like all the forms fill . 25540_28100
pages . 28170_28470
yeah . 28970_29150
so . 29300_29420
you can't just like fill in one page and like . 29520_31590
leave it . 32280_32500
that's what you meant . 32830_33500
that's what I'm saying . 33520_34050
well . 34460_36950
we just fill out all it . 36100_36940
it takes a while like they'll just be . 39040_40780
sitting . 40850_41090
no . 41140_41230
no they don't . 41360_41620
they don't want us to do that . 41720_42470
no . 42520_46860
we'll have it all pre-filled out . 42720_43840
and we'll just have the last . 44200_44800
to do that we actually have to go into the code selected next_to
no . 53180_53240
we might have to do that . 53400_54220
oh well . 55200_55350
<no no> no . 56000_56260
no . 56480_56670
I mean like if we have two . 56800_59460
okay . 59720_59900
if we have two browser windows open we could just like switch to
but there are multiple pages . 65360_66130
multiple pages . 66460_66680
but the second . 66760_67170
page is optional . 67250_67820
anyways . 68020_68300
if <no no> no . 69140_69960
the register . 69980_70400
fine . 70420_70590
the matching is . 70660_71210
yeah . 71300_71390
the matching . 71500_71730
I mean the match for the matching . 71860_72910
I mean . 73380_73670
so we'll just show the last page . 73810_75250
we don't have to show all of it . 76830_77800
we could just talk about it . 79510_80360
you know what we could have . 84440_84920
we could have different pages of the form . 85140_86600
&-um filled out like . 87510_89890
no . 89970_90090
we can just show Windows with each of the first three pages so that
last page will be filled out like like where we have page four
the entire thing had been depleted . 99580_100840
and just click send on that . 100860_102730
do you know what I'm saying . 104690_105200
no . 105680_105800
basically we keep four browser windows open . 107090_109300
right one at . 109320_111460
each page . 111480_111980
yeah . 112190_112250
one in if each page so that they can quickly get an overview of
because our content is a part of our site . 116000_117910
then &-um after that we just basically have the fourth one has
yeah . 126630_126860
we can do . 127140_127590
that too . 127640_127850
so maybe we should get there a little early tomorrow . 131680_133240
get to class a little early . 134830_135730
yeah . 136810_136910
like eleven . 137430_137700
