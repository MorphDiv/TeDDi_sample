and Lisa had <and Lisa had a a a okay a &~chees> a happy meal
and then the clerk said that it all adds up to twelve fifty .
his mom reached out for her purse it wasn't there .
then she remembered that she had left it on the kitchen counter .

then <oh what was it oh yeah> Sam didn't make it to the bus
then when he gotta school his teacher was very disappointed because
so the day went on normal except for Sam <because &-um um>
and the end .
<all right> that's great .

that's fabulous .
I did one with these pictures .
this one was when he broke his shoelace .
this one he was rushing his breakfast .
this one found out that he was late for school .
that one was the one when he was running late .
and he he didn't catch the bus on time .
when the teacher was very disappointed .
and then when he was late to school .
okay .
okay one day <simon and Jan I mean &-uh > Tim and Jan
and then they heard a strange rumbling noise behind those bushes in
and then when they looked over they saw a <&~s> big spaceship
and then out came aliens .
they were from the planet Jinga &=laughs I'm guessing .
and there were about <four people> three people who actually
there was a father a mother and a little kid .
and they had a dog too that looked very strange .
<so> and Jan <she was she &~lov> she loved aliens so she
but then Tim stopped her .
<she> he said no don't go .
<how do you what do> how do you know these aliens are friendly
what if they're trying to take over the world ?
don't be silly Tim .
those aliens probably just people dressed up in in costumes and
<no Michelle &~wu I mean I mean what was her name Jan> no Jan
don't be silly there's nothing wrong with them .
I mean <they're> they look pretty nice and <they>
still we shouldn't go and do it .
still we shouldn't go see them .
we should go tell mom and dad .
so they ran home to go tell mom and dad .
and when they got there only the children saw the aliens .
mother and father didn't see anything but just people .
and a big giant truck .
0 .
