xxx . 0_4835
xxx . 4835_6146
okay . 6146_9833
quick . 9833_11216
because there are two answers . 11216_38320
xxx . 38320_40151
xxx . 40151_40501
did you get two answers ? 40501_42973
there are two possible answers . 42973_48320
okay, who can do this for us ? 48320_61950
okay, number four ? 61950_67698
&=laughs . 67698_73638
Leung Hoi Chung . 73638_74328
number five ? 74328_80255
uh +... 80255_83048
ng Chun Mei . 83048_84255
you're kidding . 84255_101176
xxx . 101176_104905
xxx . 104905_135758
okay, uh, number four, so you you write this &~e equation to express this, uh, condition . 135758_145276
so the square of a@l equals sixty four . 145276_147868
so a@l equals the square root of sixty four . 147868_150773
this is to represent a positive value, okay ? 150773_153130
or negative square root of sixty four . 153130_157460
so this you can find the answer is eight . 157460_160291
this, you can get the answer negative eight . 160291_162835
so there are two answers because eight times eight is sixty four . 162835_167458
negative eight times negative eight is sixty four . 167458_171908
so there are two answers, okay ? 171908_173945
and then, for this case, it is correct, okay ? 173945_176506
in this case, you do not need to write it, uh this sentence again this equation again . 176506_183826
do you have any questions ? 183826_185368
okay . 185368_190946
there are some things for you to think about . 190946_199075
okay . 199075_210546
&=laughs . 210546_216790
okay, think +... 216790_222598
think about, uh, square root of negative four sorry, square root of the square of negative four . 222598_230576
is it equal to four or equal to negative four ? 230576_234790
lo Chi Hung . 234790_241798
four . 241798_242943
four . 242943_243545
why ? 243545_243911
four . 243911_245311
four . 245311_246046
four . 246046_246285
negative four times negative four is it is equal to sixteen and square root of sixteen is four . 246285_255896
yes, very good . 255896_258038
so, this square root of the square of negative four, you can express +... 258038_265351
the number inside, you can expand it as you can calculate . 265351_269885
negative the square of negative four is equal to negative four times negative four . 269885_275413
so it is equal to positive sixteen . 275413_278590
so in this case, the answer +... 278590_281518
is it equal equal to negative negative four ? 281518_285725
no . 285725_286371
why ? 286371_286861
because there is no negative sign in the front . 286861_291131
so, the answer must be positive, okay ? 291131_295196
so in this case, you can see that the answer is positive . 295196_300003
you can you can find the answer is positive if there is no sign . 300003_305180
okay ? 305180_305645
if the answer is negative, only if there is a negative sign, uh, before the square root, okay ? 305645_316291
so in this case, there is no negative negative sign +... 316291_320723
uh, uh, in the front, so, we call uh, we can find the answer positive . 320723_327668
we can find a positive answer . 327668_329520
do you have any questions ? 329520_331923
okay . 331923_333451
now, uh, we have another question for for uh, for you to think about . 333451_339908
uh, it is this . 339908_340521
no solution . 340521_365546
okay . 365546_365783
no solution . 365783_366301
okay, wait a min(ute) wait a minute for you to think about this . 366301_373680
so, this, uh, square root of a sorry, uh, negative sorry, square root of negative four . 373680_382996
is it equal to two, or negative two, or no solution ? 382996_386173
no solution, no solution . 386173_388756
okay . 388756_389703
who says that it is equal to two ? 389703_392168
&=laughs . 392168_393478
put up your hand . 393478_393791
why ? 393791_397550
because take square root means what is the number times itself equal to negative four ? 397550_404165
so two times two is four . 404165_406413
so it it does not equal negative four . 406413_409271
it is it does not equal negative four . 409271_411800
how about negative two ? 411800_413455
so this answer is incorrect . 413455_415231
how about this ? 415231_415958
is it correct ? 415958_418823
&=laughs . 418823_419831
do you think this is correct ? 419831_420590
please put up your hand . 420590_421488
why ? 421488_423408
because negative two times negative two +... 423408_426951
equals +... 426951_428433
four . 428433_429426
four . 429426_429926
so it does not equal negative four . 429926_431751
so, there is +... 431751_434561
no solution . 434561_435985
no solution . 435985_436401
why ? 436401_437393
because, uh, if you find that it is, uh, just like that, a@l squared is equal to negative four . 437393_443510
so which number times itself is equal to a negative number ? 443510_447631
none . 447631_448391
none . 448391_448801
because a number a@l all number can be, uh, divided or grouped into three uh, must be one of these . 448801_457113
one is positive . 457113_458273
one is +... 458273_460241
negative . 460241_461106
negative . 461106_461726
or +... 461726_462815
no solution . 462815_464678
no solution . 464678_464988
no . 464988_465575
a number must be one of one of one of these . 465575_470158
maybe it is a positive . 470158_472276
maybe it is negative, or +... 472276_474798
zero . 474798_476046
zero, yes . 476046_476735
very good . 476735_477183
so uh, if a@l squared we see, uh by case, so if a@l is positive, then what is the value of a@l squared ? 477183_487310
positive ? 487310_488156
negative ? 488156_489853
or zero ? 489853_491035
positive . 491035_492316
positive . 492316_492853
and then if it is negative, what is the result of the square of a@l ? 492853_497803
positive . 497803_498443
positive . 498443_498828
if it is zero, then what is the &~squ square of zero ? 498828_502620
zero . 502620_503426
zero . 503426_503845
so is there any answer equal to negative ? 503845_506195
no . 506195_506956
no . 506956_507403
so, this answer this &~neg uh, negative four, you cannot find the answers . 507403_512901
okay ? 512901_513908
because, all the square +... 513908_515773
all the square, you cannot find the negative result . 515773_520445
do you have any questions ? 520445_522794
no . 522794_523901
so uh, in this case, we just, uh, learned something about the meaning of the square root . 523901_529060
so that's what is this meaning of square root ? 529060_531993
so, take square root of nine is to find the number of a@l such that the square of a@l is equal to nine . 531993_539693
so you just take the square root of nine to find the answer . 539693_545096
and then, uh, if a@l squared is equal to a@l, then there are two values . 545096_548856
so, in this case, it solves the answer is the answer is positive . 548856_554426
if this one, there is a negative sign, then the answer is negative . 554426_559008
okay ? 559008_560031
finally, there are some, uh, uh, special, uh, questions for you to think about . 560031_566746
so you must think carefully . 566746_568035
