get up ; I help pull the blankets off of you .
Trevor needs a change .
Daddy at work ; be back soon ; dinner time .
watch me come down the ladder myself alone .
listen ; what's that noise out there ?
hear the owl ; whoooo ; there he goes again .
I'd be glad to .
I don't want any more grapes .
making some fruit , Mom ?
close the door ; Trevor's screaming .
I want to get out .
put some salad dressing on it ?
going to see Martin guitar ; man has it ; take it out and show us ?
go to Palo Alto in the car ; ride in back with pillows ?
dumb bike won't go .
it doesn't move .
I don't think to .
I want something to eat ; maybe dinner .
anything the matter , Mom ?
Daddy's a nice boy ; plays with you .
Daddy , kiss Mom ; kiss Trevor ; goodbye .
Trevor's a pill ; not happy .
Mom , hold you .
cigarette .
let's go to Morning's house in her big truck .
going to the bank soon ?
play with that jewelry box .
close it .
another side ; around the edges .
this is sometimes mine .
keep this feather ; put it in your pocket there .
necklace .
come sit next to me on the warm bed ; keep 0me company .
sing a song about the teapot 'tip me over' .
be careful , Mom ; watch out for spilling .
uh oh ; I did it ; sorry about that .
oatmeal .
get another shoe .
Palo Alto .
I say I don't want any of that stuff .
so fine to see you , Mom
