alright guys Liz I want you to I'd like it . 3010_4780
if you weren't touching your core squares right now . 4800_6890
thanks . 7100_7500
they can be on the floor in front of you or they can be sitting in
but Katie you must yeah you can't be touching them . 10120_12490
Amanda you can't be touching them right now . 13180_15150
great . 16480_16740
Brian can you could you just lay your down . 17200_19340
great . 19850_20150
wonderful . 20670_21200
okay . 22510_22780
&-um I don't know if we'll get to all of these &-um ideas for you
but we'll start out with some we'll talk about what the idea is . 33840_36940
but the the possibility with the question Amanda you can't be
okay . 43420_43540
I agree too . 43920_45350
everybody's eyes need to be up here . 46270_47500
and everybody's hands need to be in their lap . 47560_49010
okay .
'cause you won't know what to do . 49860_50560
but when you get time to use your course scores all thank you . 50640_54060
&-um and then we'll spread out for a while . 55080_56790
and we'll do some tests . 56840_57610
and let you do some thinking and talking with other kids . 57810_60670
and then we'll come back together and see what we found out . 60960_63620
so we're gonna see if we can prove that this idea this suggestion
if it's true all of the time . 71510_73180
if it's just true some of the time or if it's really not true . 73260_76740
okay . 77710_77950
so whatever it is that I say you don't have to think . 78420_82110
oh Mrs Curtis said it it must be true . 82490_84180
no what I'm putting out for you is an idea for you to test anything
okay . 91350_91440
so because so just because I put this idea out for you to think
don't assume that it must be true because I'm saying . 95620_98870
it might not be true at all . 99520_100800
what you're gonna do is test show me as many ways to either prove
yes . 107690_107940
it really is true . 108070_108720
or show me as many samples of things that you can that show that .
no that idea doesn't work because I tried it <this way and>
and it doesn't work . 116680_117350
okay . 117730_117830
so you have to be the testers and the thinkers today . 117850_120720
and you have to take what we've been learning about quilts . 121140_123880
and put all of that thinking and learning to use to try to &-um to
&-um what you can do with that . 131090_132750
learning . 132890_133160
Nicole okay . 133230_136850
the first idea that we want to spend some time with is one that
but you've never really gotten a chance to show &-um to show others
you found out or you've never gotten a chance to spend a whole lot
what I'm wondering . 157400_158310
is it always true that you can start with a core square that's not
okay . 167670_167780
remember we talked about the difference between a symmetrical core
if a core square is not symmetrical we call it Asymmetric okay . 175720_181380
can you start with a core square that's not symmetrical . 181980_185420
and use that core square in some way to make at_least one two by
no . 197220_197320
you don't think so you think sometimes you would have an asymmetric
and no matter what you did you couldn't get a symmetrical two by
are true . 208740_208970
you think what do you think . 211020_211950
what do you say . 212590_212980
true . 213000_213230
what do you mean . 213310_213950
what's true . 214180_214670
it's true that you can never get a symmetrical one if you start
you can get the a two by two two . 219560_223630
guide . 223880_224070
that's symmetrical . 224120_224830
always . 225360_225550
not always . 226370_226640
for any course where that's not symmetrical . 227660_230030
can you do something to it to get &-um a symmetrical two by two
yes . 235520_235550
that's what we want to start our thinking with today . 235740_238220
so first take a look at the core squares in front of you . 238310_240700
and sort out the ones that are not symmetrical . 241940_245310
<all of> all of yours are not symmetrical . 245580_248910
okay . 248990_249080
but some people have symmetrical ones and not symmetrical . 249280_252390
is that one asymmetric or symmetric ten . 253550_255810
the one there the one that Brittany's touching what's on . 256100_260269
that one are . 260320_262440
those are symmetrical terms . 274650_275950
the ones that those are . 276100_277430
and the ones in front of you are . 277620_279230
not . 279940_280090
I just heard somebody say . 282160_283230
all of his are symmetrical . 283460_284630
who's the person you think . 284910_285670
they are not symmetrical . 287350_288740
show me Alex one of yours and how it's symmetrical . 289090_291530
please . 292060_292190
okay . 293350_293590
this one isn't colored on the back . 298080_299750
does it have to be colored on the back for you to show me if it's
no . 304980_305040
can you &-um can you hold that one at first seat . 305220_307860
&-um what Alex you're not holding it . 308740_312020
so we can see it . 312080_312790
we need to is that big triangle at the bottom . 313560_316300
is that all green . 316340_317140
or is it half green and half blue . 317290_318670
I it's I'm trying to make it green . 320280_324940
oh well we just need to know . 325310_326060
okay . 326080_326180
so we just have to think about that all green . 326560_327980
okay . 328070_328340
good . 328360_328510
show us how that core square might be symmetrical . 328560_330940
yeah . 334270_334470
it is very good . 334780_337100
can you pick a different one which what's your other four square .
okay . 343290_343380
and how is that one . 343950_345040
symmetrical . 345600_346060
yeah . 347560_347710
what I know . 359950_362460
what's wrong . 362480_362830
orange right here . 365920_366500
what side . 369030_369470
you mean so the flip side . 371410_372300
oops . 372320_372410
well we only have to look at what one side to figure out if it's .
symmetrical or not . 376160_376940
is this . 377860_378150
a symmetrical coplay . 378720_379630
yes . 380300_380370
okay . 381030_381120
exactly . 381710_382130
so side folding it sideways . 382510_383860
you mean like this . 384100_384550
yes . 384820_384850
okay . 385040_385160
yep . 385320_385460
Blue touches blue . 385480_386310
right . 386560_386700
what was confusing you is the flip side of this one isn't colored
but if you look at just the front side orange touches orange . 389960_392950
blue touches blue . 393710_394910
here orange touches orange . 394960_396340
orange . 396360_396540
blue touches blue . 396740_397430
so . 397740_397860
yes . 397900_397930
Alex does have all symmetrical core squares . 398220_400620
mine . 400800_400940
yours are all not symmetrical . 402210_403710
yours are . 406810_407230
symmetrical . 407280_407590
we're looking Alex . 409610_411090
you're just going to have to work with someone . 415960_418190
as you test . 418500_419120
so . 424980_425150
Nicole do you have at_least one that's not symmetrical . 425470_427510
all symmetrical next_to Brian this next part . 431300_436790
because . 437260_437410
you need to . 438260_438680
be able . 438840_439150
to have one that's not symmetrical . 439240_440860
Nathan please . 442220_442830
okay . 444870_444980
guys . 446070_446280
please know that you found which of your core squares are not
what . 455910_456050
do you need to do with them now that you've found which of your
Justin what do you need to do . 461540_462660
symmetrical . 465030_465330
okay . 466490_466620
you're gonna find a way to prove to me or to disprove to prove to
okay . 479550_479820
that's what you want . 483180_484030
although you wanna start . 485240_485840
this is not symmetrical . 486030_487230
okay . 487390_487510
can you make a symmetrical two by two design . 488380_490550
okay . 492610_492750
oh where's your other gonna . 494460_499240
do your . 500760_501060
two . 518940_519070
she looked . 567980_568320
can you do it again . 584350_584740
