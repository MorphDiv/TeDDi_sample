conversation number thirty eight . 6000_7620
dash ninety two portions of a telephone conversation between the
the following is segment one . 27760_29430
well rather a hard day wasn't it . 36560_40390
well it was hard for you . 41510_42720
yeah . 44940_45070
when I I didn't know you had made the statement you did until
when I think of the discipline with which you conducted the meeting
you know the problem I have is that &-uh I can't look at it the
I really should . 66850_67360
well these people god damnit . 67480_69350
they're guilty . 69370_69710
throw (th)em out and go on . 69940_72270
but &-uh just the personal things are god . 72470_75950
damn . 75970_76120
I think of these good men that's try to who wanted to do the right
and &-uh well it's gonna splash in a_lot_of (th)em and &-uh anyway
of_course . 100800_101000
garment as you know was having the idea that I should get up and
and John Mitchell should step up like a man and say . 118850_121750
look I was in charge . 121830_122670
I take the responsibility . 122850_123990
period . 124300_124470
exactly all the Moreso is doing the opposite . 124880_127790
won't help him . 127890_128479
any . 128530_128830
nope they're gonna get him . 129910_130990
&-uh no I think the fire Holman would make him the villain . 133190_138990
well in the end he would probably have to go Henry they're gonna
good . 148140_148260
well if that's the case then he should get out before . 150600_152830
well but not until I have absolute evidence . 155360_161050
I'm not gonna fire a guy on the basis of a charge made by Dean who
you see that's why I had that phrase in there that no immunity
yeah . 176480_176550
he has no right to do that . 176790_177910
no that's absolutely . 179020_180070
I mean I think that is outrageous . 180240_181780
no I I just have no way . 184220_186500
I I have no good feel for where . 186720_188300
I I think you would not have improved the situation if you had
yep . 199530_199620
and &-uh well we have two or three hard months ahead . 201260_208700
it's gonna be real rough . 209380_210220
well the major thing now Mr President if I may say so is to protect
the that'll be hard because &-uh well that be absolutely essential
they'll some of these people will even piss on the president if
well it's pretty hard . 228230_229660
I'm the only one frankly the whole god of of the whole bunch
well here's where it is . 244560_246380
which he should have done months ago . 248200_249220
well they better know but they had . 250630_251910
and they try to instead_of stepping back and assessing where they
cut in deeper and deeper . 257740_258860
that's right . 259300_259820
but I think the absolute I mean to protect the place . 260700_265400
well <if we can> if we can we will but if we don't what the
what the hell . 281600_282020
that is out_of the question with all due respect . 282810_284850
Mr President that cannot be considered . 284920_286670
well personality what it would do to the presidency and to the
why should you do it . 294940_295790
and what good would it do . 297360_298270
whom would it help . 300270_301110
it wouldn't help the country . 304320_305260
it wouldn't help any individual involved . 305500_307380
but with all respect I don't think a president has a right to
and it would of_course be personally untrust . 319160_321310
well maybe I think we have to dig . 322610_325390
well I've had done a few tough meetings you know I've had dinners
we had a dinner . 336240_336790
and they were tough . 336980_338620
but boy I'm telling you tonight I that was a hard one for me to get
<I don't think> I don't think you edit it off . 343850_345220
<I don't> I don't think the audience sensed it . 345450_347460
but no one sensed it . 347480_348650
no one in fact I didn't know you had made a statement . 349140_353020
so one of my dinner partners said . 353180_355660
isn't it astonishing how the president is behaving considering what
today . 359600_359900
I said . 360660_360820
yes . 360920_361090
he's had a tough meeting in the morning . 361110_362620
but he does that all the time . 362700_363900
she said . 365030_365190
no . 365340_365510
the statement was with his guest . 365560_369020
so it wasn't astonishing performance . 371880_374030
but I think Mr President it can be well to the extent you can . 376500_380980
and you're talking to people . 381020_383030
you may may have to mention really very strongly these personal
if it'll help . 388060_388620
I don't know may not help . 388800_389980
oh no it it will help Mr President then . 390500_392790
if the stuff any stuff gets out then there has to be ruthless
yep . 400380_400470
well it will there will hell . 400900_402390
yep . 403740_403830
the ax will fall . 404740_406500
and . 408100_408190
&-uh it's impermissible to touch the presence that cannot be
and . 416500_416590
whatever prize . 418080_418550
and I'm sure that even Bob &-uh that Bob wouldn't want that . 419330_422390
oh no . 423620_424050
Bob is willing to Bob and John Bo willing to throw themselves in
although there when they do they're gonna fight like hell . 428680_430830
but &-uh one of them ought_to die . 432140_433820
I would hope so . 435640_436270
but it I'm afraid it can't be Haldeman and I'm afraid the only one
but I think you've positioned it correctly that as evidence comes
well that's the garment line . 462230_463380
what do you think of Islam well garment wants you to fire Alder
yep . 474870_474970
well . 478270_478510
well it's a poss . 481960_482700
I don't know what the evidence is . 483290_484380
but &-uh the evidence is at this time . 484580_488380
charges made that have not been corroborated yet . 488570_490830
but they're well if there's a good chance that they'll have to go
then I don't think you should fire them . 499110_500700
they ought_to resign on the ground that their youthfulness is
that they have to be above like Jesus's wife . 507070_509900
mhm . 513059_513280
we'll think about it . 516880_517539
do our best . 517980_518580
but I think it does you credit to have stood as you have . 519659_524870
and in any event today you were right to go no further . 526920_530460

oh four am . 572660_573400

you do your job . 582540_583240
you two or three of us have gotta stick around try to hold a
and you you have saved this country . 588330_590400
Mr President the history books will show that when they don't when
and maybe although our enemies you know say . 599120_604880
well this proves that we were obstructed justice . 604900_610040
we . 610470_610570
oh well oh and in six months no one will know it anymore . 612090_616410
mm . 617600_617630
it's a human tragedy for Alden and Dean and a few of those fellows
and he Dean is the the real the follow the thrill . 626990_632100
he gonna be the loose cannon because he's &-uh trying to save his
trying to get immunity . 638920_639680
that's why add in that little phrase that no immunity should be
yeah . 644770_644860
and that's gonna burn his ass because then he'll thrash out about
yeah . 652130_652190
although Ziegler made an interesting point . 654540_656240
he has god damn little credibility credibility . 656320_658720
after all he was making the report . 658750_660400
that's right . 661080_661440
he was the one that said there was no involvement . 661520_663320
and that's what we relied on . 663460_664560

and <took him> took him till February or March of this year
well here it is . 671740_672290

I testified him as_soon_as it comes out and let him scream from the

well we will when the time comes well you know nobody really will

Mr President and it's &-uh because dates passed . 702610_706080
it's no damn well that you couldn't have known about it . 706280_708480
that if one considers all the things you had to go through you
you're running the government . 715370_716310
you're doing all the negotiating . 716360_717780
you're carrying a bigger load than any president has . 718850_721190
top of it . 722620_723100
they want you to . 723120_723700

we were going to Russia and China and ending the war and
I wasn't even thinking about the goddamn campaign . 728170_730460
you know I had nothing to do with the campaign as you know . 730540_733150
of_course that's the pro . 733580_735020
that's the tragedy . 735150_735630
I wish to Christ maybe that I had . 735960_737350
but if I had been spending time in the campaign maybe wouldn't
<then it's> then it's rather difficult . 747310_749100
