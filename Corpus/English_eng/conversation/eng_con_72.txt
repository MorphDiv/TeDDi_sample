I was going to UDC .
I was taking a class in electronics .
we were setting up a circuit that week .
we started on Monday .
when Thursday came around we .
me and the two guys in my team .
we came in and all our circuits had been removed from the circuit
we had to reinstall everything in twenty minutes .
so I decided that I was going to take control .
put all the components together .
I would send the other two guys to get the parts .
I would read the list off the parts .
Sean and Andrew were my two partners .
so I sent Sean to get the resisters .
Andrew to get the capacitors and the transistors .
we assembled the test, components test in about fifteen minutes .
it worked .
to this day I believe the instructor took it apart .
because we were always laughing .
joking in class all the time .
so that's what I remember .
the lady was went shopping .
she had lost her wallet .
she had no way to pay for her groceries when she got to the
she couldn't pay for her groceries so she put the groceries away .
she went home .
when she got home she got a phone call .
the little girl said she had found her wallet .
the lady went shopping .

so she had to put the groceries back .
