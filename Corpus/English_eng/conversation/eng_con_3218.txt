read it out loud . 1_25665
oh, ok . 25665_26766
topic statistics type one and type two error, decision
ok, that's fine . 35495_35830
ok, there's kind of a lot of material . 35830_39966
were there any particular questions you can think of ? 39966_43301
um . 43301_43758
I thought we might start with those to make sure we covered
well, there's one thing in here that I don't know how important it
ok . 70318_70571
and it says that . 70571_72011
what page ? 72011_73140
page one hundred thirty eight . 73140_74435
it says, that if you conclude that you have not sampled from the
where are you ? 87075_89195
oh yeah, right there . 89195_93810
ok, alright, that is you conclude that you have not sampled from
and instead you decide that your data are from a different sampling
ok . 104898_105706
I don't really understand that . 105706_106666
ok, what that's saying is when you are testing a t_test or an
uh huh . 119180_119625
if your means are different, what does that mean ? 119625_122553
that means your samples are different . 122553_124705
well, what does that mean ? 124705_125553
that your samples come from different populations . 125553_128441
ok, um, when it talks about the sampling distribution, the sampling
it tells you the probability of obtaining any particular results . 140610_145801
say you got a score of three, well you can look and see what the
ok, so what this is saying is that's just another way of saying
so when it says that when your obtained results you conclude that
in other words, your sample didn't come from the population
in other words . 173598_173895
yeah, that's what . 173895_173918
in other words, every score comes from some theoretical normal
it can be but the sampling distribution that's where we get the
you know ? 196150_196388
uh huh . 196388_197061
there is such a thing as having a sampling distribution of ten
and so that's just a fancy way of saying, in other words, the null
uh huh . 216726_217251
there was a difference, so to me that's a confusing way to put it
uh huh, uh huh . 233268_234195
which is a funny way to think about it that you know the two
well, you get their scores . 241546_250921
I guess the whole concept of population like one guy over here is
I mean to me there are just a bunch of people out there . 259008_261313
uh huh . 261313_261873
and they all have different scores . 261873_263823
well, we group them into populations according to what
so in other words if you get something way out in the o@l one range
well, possibly . 277791_279883
but yeah, sure, if you look at it in a limited sense you'll get
if you just say different populations i_e they're different because
then that kinda of limits it . 294371_295875
yeah, it just . 295875_297706
it kind of brings it out of the realm of the flowing stuff just a
I just thought it meant that this one particular person had an
it's like he's a Martian or something . 309793_310511
it doesn't mean that . 310511_311238
well, right, right it's not talking that these are people and these
yeah right . 313968_314383
it means that they're different populations as per what you're
ok, alright, anything else ? 317671_321870
we can just go through it . 321870_324461
yeah, that's fine . 324461_325638
page by page, but if you have specific questions which you want to
well, there's one other one on page one hundred and forty two
ok . 333365_336885
a very large sample size might enable the researcher to find the
now, that's confusing . 349413_350301
ok, what that means is Ok when you have larger and larger samples,
right . 360805_361451
of what's going on . 361451_361908
right . 361908_362740
as you get close and closer to it, accounting for every member of
statistically, the way the statistics work, it is often possible to
uh huh . 377875_378235
not changing anything else, but the more people you collect it's
right . 390635_391268
ok, the example they use, and I think it's a pretty good one . 391268_394115
just because something is statistically significant doesn't mean
it could just be so what . 402058_403153
in other words, if an expensive new psychiatric treatment technique
uh huh . 419580_420136
two days . 420136_420570
so what it's just that paragraph is just about statistical
uh huh . 434003_434656
doesn't mean it has any real world practicality or significance . 434656_440080
ok . 440080_441208
I was trying to think of another example . 441208_443758
it seems like to me maybe what they were doing is not very
well, they might not have been looking to see if it would reduce
if by just two days, they might have been thinking it would do
oh, Ok, I see . 459830_460503
maybe what they come out with was just &=mumbles . 460503_464621
but in most cases the more samples you have, the better your
up to a point ? 469196_470541
up to a point, there is a difference . 470541_472510
that's what the books' saying, I mean you can almost;
there's a point at which, oh gosh, I have actually a very good xxx .
I'm gonna put this one pause and run upstairs . 494045_496411
I'll be right back . 496411_496468
ok . 496468_497220
with another book . 497220_500260
xxx . 500260_502500
yeah, I saw it, but it just says that; all that is meant by
that means that the null hypothesis is true . 511083_514178
but it is the substantive meaning of statistical significance if it
in other words, we should not feel proud when the psychologist
perhaps, that is the most practical use . 531730_537578
uh huh . 537578_537858
so you can have something that's significant but it's not very
sure, a lot of people tend to level that criticism at research in
yeah, right . 556991_558165
but that's a matter of some debate . 558165_561508
ok . 561508_563011
alright does that take care of that . 563011_567396
yeah . 567396_567756
for you a little bit ? 567756_568283
ok, let's go back and kind of run through it all . 568283_573466
can you tell me about inferential statistics ? 573466_578386
kind of review from last week a little bit . 578386_580570
well, uh, it seems like inferential statistics are just taking
ok, it's more along the lines of saying how applicable what you
ok, alright . 617266_619856
if a researcher has made sure that he or she has equivalent groups,
does this necessarily mean that any differences in dependent
uh, no because there would be within, are you talking about within
right, well, or there might be error or variance . 645015_647303
you know, sure when you talk specifically about it in general
right, there's always gonna be differences . 655855_657615
sure, major differences or whatever . 657615_661391
ok, that's why we need inferential statistics is to see how
ok, so, when we're looking at our statistics obviously we have to
well, the null hypothesis states that the mean for the population
um, the alternative hypothesis of a particular research project
uh, hah, between the means . 705560_707863
right . 707863_708288
in other words, the means are different, therefore they come from
that's what we were talking about . 711846_712855
ok, so, in other words, which one means that the independent
the null . 720751_721431
ok, and so the alternative says that . 721431_724166
there is an effect . 724166_725198
right . 725198_725575
it does have an effect . 725575_726223
ok, um, why do we, Ok, usually when we're formulating hypotheses,
in other words, we speak of the alternative in terms of the null . 740768_744070
that the null s not the case you know we speak in terms of
do you understand the logic of that ? 750070_752221
why is that so ? 752221_753281
well, because it's easier to, uh, I mean it's, ah, let's see it
that's sort of . 787226_789263
one thing you have to be careful of is proving . 789263_791703
right . 791703_792375
ok, we rarely can say, rarely, never can say we prove anything . 792375_796543
we can only get to such a probability that we accept or reject . 796543_799718
um, it's more along the lines of that if we can determine that the
in other words, the independent variable probably has had an effect
but the null statement is an exact statement, perfectly precise, it
so this allows us to calculate precisely the probability of the
ok, such precision is possibly due to the research hypothesis, Ok,
ok ? 839216_839976
ok . 839976_840313
so it allows us for that precision because we calculate an exact
alright, so we speak of the probability that the observed results
you know the null is rejected, and that probably gets so low, that
ok ? 865066_865863
so what then is statistical significance ? 865863_868663
well, statistical significance means that data was found that would
and of course you can set that with your, ah +... 882128_885606
probability, you confidence level or alpha . 885606_891733
confidence level, right ? 891733_892126
the &=mumbles to that is the more unlikely it is to find something
right, in other words, as you're saying you can choose how much
that's right . 908453_909116
xxx . 909116_912736
ok, alright, so but again, remember, that we speak in terms of
to bad . 929160_930025
yeah, really . 930025_930860
ok, so we already talked about it a little bit so let's see if you
um +... 939826_942186
one more time . 942186_945546
the sampling distribution, well, that term, you mean a normal
a sampling distribution, just like we were talking about earlier
ah, well, the sample distribution would be what you get from your
ok, right the distribution of say sample means . 967978_971458
sample means . 971458_972416
or whatever . 972416_972618
right . 972618_973345
remember that a sampling distribution refers to a distribution of
right . 979936_980328
um, the can be of two types like I was talking about earlier . 980328_986016
you can have say literally ten observed sample means or we can say
uh huh . 995280_995600
and that allows us to; these theoretical sampling distributions
sampling distributions based on the assumption that the null is
that's from the normal distribution xxx ? 1010598_1013486
it's from a sampling distribution of the scores at the confidence
I don't understand . 1020620_1022228
ok, so it allows us to determine the probability associated with
alright, um, so we've already talked a little bit about what
well, your variability decreases, doesn't it ? 1040921_1044681
well, not necessarily . 1044681_1045753
I mean . 1045753_1046113
but you are more likely to detect, to obtain an accurate estimate
yeah, you would get your curve would look more . 1057681_1061855
well, your line would get more accurate, you know . 1061855_1067453
xxx . 1067453_1069261
you might find more outliers as you <xxx> . 1068711_1073320
<this is true> . 1073320_1075366
really the important thing to remember that +/. 1075366_1078643
truer picture . 1078643_1079483
yep a truer picture xxx .1079483_1084738
ok . 1084738_1085495
and alright so talking about testing our means looking for
what were the two types we talked about ?1091703_1095270
t_test and f_test . 1095270_1096096
sure .1096096_1097151
when do we want to use the t_test ? 1097151_1099625
t_test is used when you just have two you want to find the
means . 1108435_1108896
means ok . 1108896_1109696
xxx .1109696_1110785
and then the f_test is three or more when you have three or more
groups . 1114993_1115890
right . 1115890_1116625
xxx .1116625_1118296
ok . 1118296_1118935
alright so it's most commonly used when xxx two groups xxx . 1118935_1124595
often the type of case is when you say have two levels of one
okay when using any type of statistical test of your means what
there are a couple of things you have to assume or decide . 1148238_1153533
ah let's see <before> after you've done your test before you
before you analyse your data .1160831_1163063
xxx you have to decide some things .1163063_1167271
you have to specify your hypothesis first . 1167271_1170455
oh yeah your research hypothesis and then you set your alpha level .
right, exactly . 1174503_1175823
ok, so, ah, can you think of an example of when a t_test might be
xxx . 1181006_1182558
ummm . 1182558_1184391
well, let's see, maybe if you want to, ah, xxx . 1184391_1194470
this is hard, actually figuring these things out . 1194470_1196990
umm, let me think . 1196990_1198021
well if you can't think of examples you can often understand a
right, or when you want to use it . 1204496_1205545
or when you want to use it . 1205545_1206336
well, umm, test scores, maybe . 1206336_1216633
are affected by what ? 1216633_1218560
the amount of study time . 1218560_1220503
ok, that sounds good . 1220503_1222063
alright, so for convenience sake you want to say you had two groups
uh huh . 1230341_1230740
ok, x@l one studied for how many hours ? 1230740_1232396
uh, five hours . 1232396_1237463
you not xxx here . 1237463_1237911
ok, five hours of study . 1237911_1238895
this may not be per night . 1238895_1240335
oh, well . 1240335_1241865
two hours . 1241865_1245553
two hours of study . 1245553_1248968
ok . 1248968_1249393
this then would be what, our independent or dependent measures ? 1249393_1255328
ahh, those would be independent measures . 1255328_1258385
right . 1258385_1258656
so, what do we want to call our dependent ? 1258656_1260593
we'll call it y@l . 1260593_1261560
the dependent measure would be, ah, grades . 1261560_1265480
on the test scores . 1265480_1266351
yeah, on the test scores . 1266351_1267440
ok, so what would be our null hypothesis ? 1267440_1277233
the null would say that x@l one minus x@l two is equal to zero, the
do you know the symbol of the null ? 1285130_1291993
the null is, ah, xxx . 1291993_1297761
come on, you remember . 1297761_1301825
mmm, I can't remember . 1301825_1307113
ho . 1307113_1308338
oh yeah . 1308338_1309546
ok, so our alternative or research hypothesis . 1309546_1314283
h_y . 1314283_1314826
yeah, and if you did in these terms ? 1314826_1317626
0 . 1317626_1318201
it would be x@l one minus y@l one equals zero . 1318201_1322618
yeah . 1322618_1323433
or that means . 1323433_1329816
right . 1329816_1330753
ok, alright so we're gonna set up our t_test, and there are a
do we think that there's gonna be a difference ? 1341521_1344890
I mean obviously . 1344890_1346688
yeah, we do . 1346688_1347313
do we think there's gonna be a direction for that difference ? 1347313_1350663
in other words . 1350663_1351151
yeah, it would be a one tailed test . 1351151_1353065
ok, in other words, so what are we saying here ? 1353065_1355423
we're saying that the, ah, x@l one, or x@l one . 1355423_1362311
is gonna be better . 1362311_1363646
yeah, is gonna be better . 1363646_1364383
so a one_tailed might be more appropriate . 1364383_1371463
ok, we've decided on our direction, we formulated our hypothesis,
point o five . 1381350_1382861
very good . 1382861_1383615
ok, alright, so we know that our t_test is to look at our to test
so could you tell me what exactly is the t_test . 1392950_1396325
what are it's components ? 1396325_1399126
well, let's see, umm, you mean the formula ? 1399126_1405621
ah, the formula and then how to explain it in plain English . 1405621_1410990
well, I guess what you do first of all is you get gather all your
then you get your average, and ah, ah +... 1424741_1432643
you apply your formula . 1432643_1433363
right . 1433363_1433851
ok, but what does that formula consist of ? 1433851_1437226
it's a ratio . 1437226_1439018
yeah, it's a ratio of the, um, mean difference on top . 1439018_1443795
I mean actually the difference in means go on top . 1443795_1447500
means of what ? 1447500_1448988
of both groups groups . 1448988_1450716
between groups, Ok . 1450716_1452870
between groups, and then on the bottom, ah, it's +... 1452870_1457493
ok, you have definition between groups . 1457493_1466660
within groups . 1466660_1467211
ok, what does that mean ? 1467211_1468460
well, there's probably gonna be some variability within the group
in other words, each raw score and x@l one is gonna deviate from
right, so technically you figure out the distance from the mean and
is that right ? 1498748_1499106
right, I was just mainly looking if you understood the logic of the
well, that's true, that's sometimes more important than
the formula, you can look up . 1504938_1506586
when we were talking about that, um, when I got more into
sure . 1523268_1524038
so that's never gonna go away ? 1524038_1525646
yeah . 1525646_1526200
so, um, well, I'm kinda getting ahead of myself, I was trying to
well, you know in a perfect case you would want; the important
that's the way . 1551128_1552093
oh, right, right . 1552093_1552741
that's to make it more significant . 1552741_1554853
um, are you asking maybe, do you not understand why they even look
is that what your saying ? 1560685_1561965
well, kind of, yeah, I mean you know there's gonna be some
ok, I can draw a little figure that may help, but if it just starts
ok . 1574140_1574645
I'm gonna try this xxx . 1574645_1578468
ok, here's our two groups . 1578468_1582460
ok, here's our means . 1582460_1588083
xxx . 1588083_1593275
we'll just play with our data here . 1593275_1597828
ok, alright, this is your means, Ok, this is sort of theoretical of
if you had it all this is the way it would be . 1605161_1606498
well, obviously, if I drew a sample, my sample mean might also be
over here say my sample mean might fall a little bit above, ok . 1622683_1628128
so, but if you look at the within groups variability, how much
then we can sort of have an idea of how far off that would be . 1637265_1641048
that's what within groups variance is, you know how far each one
so if you have some idea of how far each one xxx . 1647023_1651071
then we have some idea of how close to the real mean our observed
do you see that ? 1656740_1658891
yeah . 1658891_1659723
ok . 1659723_1660388
you mean in other words, if you just picked, chose a mean, one of
yeah, this is gonna say, but since we are ignorant, this is just a
right . 1670601_1671053
and yet if we calculate the variability within that group we can
uh huh . 1682093_1682436
don't vary that much we can say well this is probably pretty close .
oh, Ok . 1685796_1686460
ok, so that when this mean that we draw can come from anywhere on
uh huh . 1693251_1695008
then we're closer to knowing, you know, how significant this spread
uh huh . 1708720_1708958
if you know something about how close this spread is to this one
uh huh . 1718125_1718348
ok . 1718348_1722601
ok, well wait a minute, I understand why you would want to know . 1722601_1731088
how much variability ? 1731088_1731578
how much within one sample ? 1731578_1733361
one group . 1733361_1734313
one group, one mean . 1734313_1735296
ok, so that gives you some idea of how close to it's real mean it
right, right . 1740553_1741576
ok, so if you know how a treatment estimate of each within group it
in other words, if you know, if you have an idea that this sample
uh huh . 1761006_1761455
then you might say well, maybe the difference between these two
oh, Ok . 1768918_1769758
that's all it's saying . 1769758_1770590
that's why you use both components . 1770590_1772798
oh, ok, alright I think I understand let that sink in . 1772798_1777975
ok, see if you can say it back to me . 1777975_1780648
so, in other words, by knowing how much variability there is within
if you can see how close to the real mean, the actual mean your
ok, you have an idea of how much each group varies . 1803095_1806006
uh huh . 1806006_1806415
so you have an idea, you know how good an estimator your sample
I don't understand that . 1821535_1824715
ok, Ok . 1824715_1826755
I mean if you already know that your two means are far apart why
well, because this is that actual distance between the two means
but if you know that this is not real close to that
oh, ok . 1856146_1856568
but if you know that this is real close to
oh, Ok, I understand that . 1865073_1865785
ok, alright, but in any case don't worry, don't lose sleep over it
ok, alright so you have that . 1875120_1883825
ok, so this is your ratio and you put it through your formula to
uh huh . 1893295_1893870
what do you do with that value ? 1893870_1895103
ok, let's say that you get two point five or something . 1895103_1899063
yeah . 1899063_1899526
and we go to the normal distribution table . 1899526_1904198
ok, xxx the normal distribution the critical value would be xxx . 1904198_1909838
right, and then we find what percentage of the population fall
greater than in absolute value terms . 1925480_1926836
right, then you would not reject your null . 1926836_1930188
but if it was outside that then you would feel like you had enough
ok, alright . 1937630_1938845
so in other words, you start off we specify our hypothesis, our
we calculate our value of t which is the ratio of . 1945108_1948300
between groups divided by within groups . 1948300_1952531
right . 1952531_1952948
you get that value and you compare it to a critical value to see if
yeah . 1965211_1966255
so what are those ? 1966255_1967155
I don't really understand degrees of freedom . 1967155_1969786
ok . 1969786_1970586
but I know what it is, it's n@l minus one . 1970586_1973035
sure . 1973035_1973388
usually . 1973388_1973826
but it depends on the statistic, Ok . 1973826_1976515
and they say that it's the number of scores that are allowed to
once the mean; Ok, you're confused . 1981715_1986146
alright, in terms of the t_test, the degrees of freedom are the
for example, if the mean of a group is six, Ok, we already know
uh huh . 2002818_2003218
ok, so we already knew that, and you have five subjects in the
uh huh . 2019020_2020600
that means that you could pick any four values, but once you had
oh, Ok . 2035065_2035295
that makes sense, but then it's not gonna vary, that . 2035295_2037158
I know that's why it's not free . 2037158_2039200
four of 'em were free to vary, but one isn't . 2039200_2043191
oh, Ok . 2043191_2043903
and that's why they say degrees of freedom is the number of sample
oh, Ok, that makes sense . 2050823_2052071
ok, good, and so, and of course lot's of times that's how you
ok, now back to a little bit more about the one and two scale
pictorially, what would be the one_tail look like ? 2070295_2074581
just tell me what to draw . 2074581_2076566
oh, Ok, well you'd just cut off one side of your . 2076566_2078893
ok, in other words, you need your t to be at some level over here,
uh huh . 2084996_2085398
and you know this would be your critical value for t
I think the book has an example of, um, the critical value say
whereas in the two_tailed one what you do . 2102918_2109021
you divide it . 2109021_2109436
you break it up, right, so you only have half of point zero five on
ok, so we had a one_tailed test so we got to pile all of our
whereas with a two_tailed, you know if we guesses wrong we would be
see how for the two_tailed here you need something to exceed two
uh huh . 2147588_2150226
so , you know we're taking the chance that we're gonna have a less
that seems kind of risky . 2154138_2155561
but, well, if your pretty sure then you want to go ahead and do it,
uh huh . 2162563_2163156
ok, F_test . 2163156_2168611
when would you want to use that one ? 2168611_2173243
well, I know you use an F_test when you have three or more groups,
ok, basically, an F_test does the same sort of thing the t_test
the t_test is a special case, um, with only the two groups you're
the F_test you could use an F_test for just two groups, and in that
ok, so that's a special case . 2203570_2206130
but the F_test for, or also called, analysis of variance . 2206130_2212888
oh, yeah, an anova . 2212888_2213753
ok, the same thing is typically used when you have more . 2213753_2218185
ok, and it's set up, the similar thing is this, the F_value is the
and the book calls those the systematic variance and the error
ok ? 2232471_2232785
uh huh . 2232785_2233800
0 . 2233800_2234280
and what does the systematic variance correspond to ? 2234280_2237536
well, it's between . 2237536_2239168
in other words . 2239168_2240095
right . 2240095_2240615
same thing . 2240615_2241335
systematic variance to error variance . 2241335_2247351
and the error variance being ? 2247351_2249895
ah, between, within, within . 2249895_2258406
that's right . 2258406_2258815
it's the same sort of test . 2258815_2260981
ok, the systematic variance is the deviation of the groups from the
in other words, it is between group variance, but this time we have
uh huh . 2272586_2273820
so, this time we might have five, two, and one hour of study, or
but in any event, we have three groups; x@l one, x@l two, x@l
alright . 2292651_2294745
we take a mean of each of those . 2294745_2296633
and then we get a grand mean which is the mean of every single
ok, the systematic variation is the deviation of each one of these
ok, and then what would our error variance be, our within groups,
it would be the deviation between each group . 2318800_2322711
from itself, so the within stays the same . 2322711_2327231
right . 2327231_2328215
within group each time, the deviation of a raw score in this group
ok . 2334211_2337268
so the systematic variance, the difference between each group mean
right . 2350930_2351751
ok, the larger the F_ratio then the more likely the results will be
right . 2361441_2361871
ok, so the five_point sort of summary of that is the goal is to
ok, significance level is your choice of how confident you wish to
ok, you are more likely to obtain significant results when you have
um, you are more likely to obtain significant results when between
ok, alright, um, just remember that the t is the ratio of between
you have to count both types of variance is all you really need to
f is the same thing, between groups is each group to the grand and
alright, so that leaves us type one and type two errors . 2422533_2429148
if you want to go that's fine, but I'm welcome, I don't mind . 2429148_2434066
no, no, that's fine with me . 2434066_2435643
you're supposed to be cut loose at quarter till if you want, but . 2435643_2444323
no, that's fine, I stayed an hour last time . 2444323_2446683
I need all the help I can get . 2446683_2448970
ok . 2448970_2449795
this stuff, I have such a weak grasp on it, you know it's kind of
and that's such a shame because it really make sense when it can
maybe if we do some research in there . 2463281_2465650
you sound fine . 2465650_2465881
you're doing fine . 2465881_2466825
sometimes I get confused . 2466825_2468601
I think I understand it . 2468601_2469393
I mean in theory I sort of understand it xxx . 2469393_2474400
xxx . 2474400_2482283
ok, talking about types of errors . 2482283_2490386
so what am I putting up here ? 2490386_2492946
do you know what it's called ? 2492946_2493930
well, yeah . 2493930_2494778
the decison matrix . 2494778_2499433
it has to do with the population, and the decisions we make about
ok, what two decisions can we make ? 2515971_2519640
well, let's see, we can fail to reject the null hypothesis . 2519640_2525311
in other words, usually we just say it as fail to reject . 2525311_2530896
that's what kind of confused me about that . 2530896_2532760
yeah, I agree with you . 2532760_2533880
you are usually told to say failed to reject . 2533880_2539335
ok, or we can ? 2539335_2546015
reject . 2546015_2546718
ok, about our population we can say that either that the null is . 2546718_2556146
true . 2556146_2557265
or we can say the null is ? 2557265_2561248
false . 2561248_2561881
ok, if I reject the null hypothesis, in other words, I found a
what kind of error have I made ? 2586561_2587983
type one . 2587983_2589158
ok, in other words we rejected the null when actually the null was
ok, when the null is false and we reject the null, what have we
you've make a correct decision . 2602510_2606526
when the null is true and we have failed to reject it . 2606526_2618021
correct decision . 2618021_2618493
ok, the null is false, but we have failed to . 2618493_2626565
type two . 2626565_2628228
in other words, In English, type one errors occur when we reject
type two occurs when the null hypothesis is accepted although in
in other words, the null is false and the h@l one is true . 2648560_2651560
althought you were correct, we don't usually talk in terms of
we usually say accept or reject . 2656840_2661668
ok, can, which type of error do we usually think of as being more
type I . 2671740_2672323
ok, and why would that be true ? 2672323_2674220
well, because, um, you would always want to make sure that befor we
right . 2695563_2695921
it has no basis at all, and I'm sure that happens all the time . 2695921_2699305
well, as you set your alpha level higher and higher it becomes more
true . 2704633_2704991
ok, but why then is a type two error not so serious in research ? 2704991_2711103
well, you could always go back and test it again you know if you
would you do another study ? 2716211_2719218
yeah, you can, ah . 2719218_2720688
maybe you could do what with your sample size ? 2720688_2723265
you could increase it . 2723265_2724208
ok, maybe you could do some other things like get some more
change you whole set up . 2731200_2734696
I mean maybe you didn't do it right . 2734696_2736336
sure, change the way you formulate things whatever . 2736336_2741175
ok, what if I'm studying the effects of sleep deprivation on
one group has had twenty four hours of sleep deprivation and the
I analyze the results and based on them conclude from them that the
however, in reality the amount of deprivation used in my conditions
again, what type of error have I made ? 2764776_2766735
ok, if you say that sixty hours of sleep deprivation is different
was different from the other . 2774891_2777250
well that would be when you reject the null when it is true, so
type I, right . 2784073_2784985
so what happens as we decrease the chance of our type one, as we
it increases . 2796766_2798430
right . 2798430_2799021
because it makes it harder to, Ok, as you make it harder to reject
right, you make it harder to reject the null . 2821575_2824420
so . 2824420_2825468
so, there might be some significant . 2825468_2829468
so you might have made it so hard to reject that there might have
you let something slide through xxx, too large of holes or
well, that's actually opposite the effect . 2840173_2841646
in other words, as you make it so hard to reject the null, you run
that there's a real effect, and you don't pick it up . 2846406_2849718
right, and you don't pick it up . 2849718_2851150
don't people usually attempt it again in a different way, you know,
sure, sure, that's the whole point . 2863328_2864910
for research purposes a type two is not so bad, but like the book
you might want to run the risk of surgery that really wasn't needed
right, right . 2889301_2890051
ok, um, ok, can we specify the probability of makin a type one
in other words, when we report our results can we specify what our
well, our alpha level sets up . 2908715_2910275
if we say that it's point o@l five then we have a ninty five
right ! 2920521_2920841
and we also have a ninty five percent assurance . 2920841_2923073
a type one error, in other words, yes, it is the alpha level that
you can never know, because say you set a ninty five percent
right . 2954030_2954308
your exact probability is; by definition you set your alpha level
uh huh . 2961583_2963143
ok . 2963143_2963583
xxx . 2963583_2967015
ok, you mean one beta and all that kind of . 2967015_2969653
yeah, that kind of confused me . 2969653_2971406
if you want to go over it sometime just give me a call, but again I
xxx . 2981078_2981965
I don't know, we'll see . 2981965_2983773
well, I guess I should concentrate on this . 2983773_2987518
yeah, which is why just as far as the t; if I what I drew helped
right . 2998708_3000355
of those two, and you know that between the groups the within is
right . 3005931_3006226
and you need both of them for your t@l . 3006226_3007898
ok, alright, so, um, interpreting nonsignificant results then in
uh huh . 3028115_3028446
you know, that would be sort of silly, um, and it's problematic;
um, Ok . 3043520_3050433
xxx . 3050433_3055345
um, and I may have said that backwards . 3055345_3057601
ok, a single study may not show significant results cause you had
now you could run six studies and say forget it . 3070901_3073251
but you know may not necessarily so serious . 3073251_3077333
ok, anything else ? 3077333_3079741
I don't think so . 3079741_3082093
ok, I hope that was helpful . 3082093_3087645
it was, anytime I go over something . 3087645_3090101
