I mean I assume being as already he said he found a place and it
he's already committed to he said that he's going to move in there
y- . 754610_754970
I don't want to tell him something now and have him . 757840_759900
says something different to the people he's gi- giving a commitment
Well I mean he's under no obligation if you tell him like well
&=laughs you know . 770230_771170
Well it was more I thought that just whether you were comfortable
than it was wi- whether whether or not we had somebody to move in
yeah I mean that was the original issue . 780000_782350
right . 782410_783030
But I'm I guess what I'm trying to say is that I . 783350_787390
You'd be willing to give it a chance . 787450_788750
&=breath at this point &=breath I feel like &=breath I don't have

Well I mean I hope you weren't you know you know your mind wasn't
It was in a little bit to a certain extent yeah . 827090_829640
because . 831670_832280
you know and it's nobody's fault really it's just bad really . 832750_836710
abysmal timing . 837150_838300

Well yeah . 839400_840340

xxx . 848320_848780
It does . 849420_849840
but I mean . 851800_852990
it's really frustrating here because I have no control over it too
so it's like . 860260_861170
yeah well it makes it equally . 860320_862280
and then t- . 863030_863990
hard to have any decisions done . 863550_864930
to think that whatever that it had been all wrapped up and
you know to get this email from Sarah like oh I'm so happy I'm
right she she clearly didn't see that it was important . 875340_878420
like you know you had a commitment . 878850_880270
show you the place . 881290_882040

last summer . 947320_948010

handle another . 972910_974370
I mean . 975960_976290
