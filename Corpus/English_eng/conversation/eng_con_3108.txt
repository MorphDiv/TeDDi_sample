with two different core squares . 190_1830
were they both &-um asymmetric . 2150_4100
yeah . 4680_4740
okay . 5180_5310
what did you find out . 5360_6190
I found out that this . 7040_8230
okay . 19200_19300
this two by two is symmetrical . 19320_20900
but the core square is not . 20920_21950
could you use your finger to show us the lines of symmetry . 22080_24230
please . 24280_24540
good job . 26370_26810
how_about that one the design you that was using the same core
so it ended up being different . 31490_32650
okay . 33850_34030
area it . 35000_35200
so what did we find out . 35330_36650
well that's it . 37910_38290
&-um is that way symmetrical . 43600_46930
but it has to be the whole path of your design . 55200_57440
I would be folding at once . 57660_58680
not just one horse square . 58840_60040
if I took the whole half of your design and folded it vaguely . 60600_65050
is it gonna match . 65160_65960
no that one horse squares . 67120_68530
you found a way to do it . 68580_69360
oh wait . 71120_71370
I wanna talk about what we found out . 71540_72880
&-um Kelly could you scoot back a little bit 'cause you're kind of
thank you . 78770_79040
we were trying to find out if this idea was always true . 80600_85010
sometimes true or never true . 85360_87000
can you start with a core square that is in no way symmetrical . 87680_92400
and every time you could make at_least one way that a two by two
sometimes make this is part . 100690_105530
part &-um what Kevin this his . 106130_108490
yes it is . 108920_109410
Katie what did you say . 110330_111040
not all the time . 112370_113050
just sometimes because I couldn't these ones aren't symmetrical . 113100_116570
but I couldn't make a symmetrical . 116620_118300
show us that you're wait . 119170_120640
just lay down the course chair first so we can look at it . 120660_122910
is Katie's course clear . 123400_124560
symmetrical or not symmetrical . 124690_126730
not . 127280_127400
symmetrical . 127420_128009
okay . 128250_128449
Amanda could you leave it there and move back . 128539_130460
please . 130539_130639
thank you . 130910_131370
I'll take . 131740_132010
a look at it . 132140_132560
great . 133070_133370
&-um Katie show us a horse for that . 134160_136720
you tried and that . 136740_138520
and it wasn't symmetrical or show us . 138990_140970
let's see if we can think about this one together and find a way
with her core square . 151870_153580
because if Katie actually has a an asymmetric foursquare that can't
&-um . 164580_164660
okay Katie can you scoot back a little bit so they can also can you
Katie made a two by two from her asymmetric core square . 170230_174220
is that two by two design symmetrical . 174540_176830
no . 177100_177270
no . 177500_177670
does it raise your hand if you were looking at it . 178360_180620
and you see a way that you could make it symmetrical . 180660_183500
Alex show us what you're thinking . 184150_185710
well go right ahead . 186350_187940
we'll get all you need to if you . 188250_189580
do this and can . 189740_194390
I just take one piece . 194840_195750
no . 196580_196640
you need to show us a two by two design that's symmetrical . 196940_199380
can you use those four pieces . 200100_201710
Alex and make a two by two design . 202150_204830
that's symmetrical . 204880_205660
you can rearrange Katie's course for any way you want . 206530_209060
maybe if I . 211110_211440
pop that . 211900_212130
okay . 217240_217370
but how does that be in the two by two design . 218100_220990
the way it is now is is it's symmetrical . 226020_228440
the way it is now . 229960_230590
is that part symmetrical . 230700_231970
what does metrical mean . 234070_235500
means to fold it . 236770_238820
okay . 239510_239610
it'll make . 240730_241330
the same . 242570_242900
where would I be folding this two by two so that the halves would
I'll . 249740_249880
fold fold it . 249960_251620
yeah . 251910_251970
yeah . 253360_253470
Alex can you leave it in that position for a moment . 266160_267940
hands down . 268590_268940
listen . 269100_269360
don't you take a look at what Alex did . 270160_271550
please . 271600_271790
is the Amanda would just scoot back a little . 272420_274420
thank you . 274570_274920
is the two by two design that Alex just laid out symmetrical . 275490_279100
no . 279740_279800
how hard it's is the two by two design symmetrical . 281260_286600
not yet . 287210_287630
who sees how Jillian show me what you think you'd do today to end
are you watching him . 329340_330030
is that symmetrical . 351490_352340
yes . 352770_352830
yes . 353160_353300
hold on . 359270_359690
please lay it down again . 359760_361340
Sarah so where's the line of symmetry on that one . 361360_365750
right . 366400_366630
there's two . 367290_367710
of . 367760_368120
oh I don't think there is two of them . 368410_370460
no . 370740_370800
like this . 372310_372660
there's two . 372880_373280
no . 375100_375270
oh wait . 378420_378650
I wanna back the way Jillian had it . 378720_380420
that's the way you had it . 381430_382220
that's only one . 382750_383440
only one line of symmetry . 383870_385240
uhhuh . 385410_385660
down the middle . 386010_386580
the reason watch it's not one this way . 386880_389940
'cause we'll watch her . 390540_390960
that green ends up it is symmetrical . 391040_392940
she did find a way to make it symmetrical . 393320_395780
but since this is Katie's design we're gonna let her show . 396330_399110
now she thinks she sees another one . 399480_400790
remember Katie thought she had a course where that could not make a
okay . 408870_409040
and now she thinks she's gonna show us a different way from
&-um no that's . 420140_422630
not symmetrical right now . 423860_425300
I know way that . 425800_426240
but . 426660_426770
just a second . 427630_428130
Katie's let Katie rearrange . 428430_430390
that's the same as . 435680_436390
not yet . 437580_437980
no . 438300_438470
okay . 451830_451960
that's magical . 456540_457070
is it . 457980_458350
yes . 458780_458810
yes . 459260_459290
no not yet . 460860_461770
no that way . 462540_467130
and what_about the other way . 467760_468950
it is not . 470500_471980
but it has one line of symmetry out . 473180_474900
and is this the way the same or different than Jillian's way . 474940_477710
different I think . 478250_478850
oh that's that's okay . 480220_481000
that's . 482580_482920
okay . 483000_483110
hands down . 483160_483630
hands . 484130_484260
down . 484480_486220
so Katie thought she had an asymmetric core square that would not
did she . 493780_493940
no no . 495380_496070
I mean did she have an asymmetric core square that couldn't make a
no . 501380_501450
no . 501600_502050
no . 502100_502240
she did make a symmetric . 502930_505500
we made more than one symmetric two by two design . 505670_508350
so did anybody today have an asymmetric core square that couldn't
by two design . 517179_517480
so is it always true that you can start with an asymmetric core
and build a symmetric two by . 524200_526190
two design . 526240_526590
yes . 526660_526720
can you always start with a core square that's not symmetrical . 528740_532380
but always find a way to make make a two by two that's
no . 536820_536990
none of you showed me that every one of you was able to every one
and you made a symmetrical two by two design every one of not . 546500_549960
symmetrical . 550750_551140
do you show it to us . 553650_554450
can you make a symmetrical two by two design with that . 558220_560740
yes . 565500_565540
&-um I was looking at the two by two design you actually made from
&-um it's the third one from the left . 576690_579380
yeah . 579920_580020
on the top row . 580180_580980
if you start at the left side lower is that symmetrical . 581580_584380
Nathan &-um yeah . 584400_586480
I think a closer look would . 589600_590990
be a . 592020_592310
good idea . 592360_592640
please look at the top row of two by two designs . 593120_595670
start at the left and go over to the third one . 596080_598670
that's the one . 599240_599780
the quarter . 599800_599950
