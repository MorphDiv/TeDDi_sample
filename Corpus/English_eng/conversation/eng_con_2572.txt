xxx like I said I don't know if the word interested is probably the best &=laughs word to use but +/. 161115_164575
forced <would be better> +/.
+, forced maybe . 166035_166515
&=laughs required okay . 167035_167955
here's your quiz for this week +...
okay you got a quiz this Thursday I believe right ? 168655_175135
homework's due on Wednesday quiz due Thursday all kinds of fun stuff . 176335_180775
end of the semester we have two weeks left &=pause_while_taking_quizzes yeah I know . 314865_315305
you &~kn &-uh what ? 315845_316765
go . 317225_317505
what do you mean ? 318085_318505
twentieth right ? 319005_319425
yeah . 319625_319945
okay go ⌈ <I knew> ⌉ . 320105_320925
⌊ okay ⌋ I have another question . 320925_321805
alright go . 321885_322045
&=laughs no not that &-um do you mind if I started practicing with the calculator now since I'll probably have to borrow it again for the ⌈ practice test ⌉ ? 322165_329585
⌊ &-um ⌋ sure . 329805_330025
I mean it would be easy for me to borrow it then because we're already setting up a day +/. 330625_333405
yes +/.
+, alright okay cool . 333825_335165
thank you . 335305_335585
no problem (0.10) okay you guys ready to go over this bad boy ? 346065_348785
that's good xxx +/.
+, &=laughs &=laughs I swear I forgot about that see I don't even know it's there . 348785_355605
okay so the probability that June gets an A in Stat one hundred is point four five so &=writes:board the probability ⌈ of ⌉ +/. 355865_361525
+, ⌊ number ⌋ ?
+, J &-uh the probability that May +//. 362505_365505
I I couldn't think of any names so I'm like oh I'll just use months . 365745_367905
April was gonna be next but I didn't have any other name I could use . 368265_370825
eight five probability of both May and June getting an A is point thirty five . 371495_379215
okay . 379915_380275
so now what is the probability that either May or June +//. 381055_384055
(be)cause we're looking for the probability of M over J . 384755_386995
we wanna know that . 388795_389555
now we know that we have this awesome addition formula which is probability of A or B the probability of A plus the probability of B that's the probability of A and okay so this is on your formula sheet you know all this &-um this is review for you hopefully . 390385_412665
so this is the formula we can use to solve this . 413725_416485
so we have we we're given this this and this and we wanna find that . 416625_420545
so we're given probability of A probability of B probability of A and B and we wanna find probability of A or B . 420885_425445
we just plug and chug into the equation . 426005_427205
okay ? 428425_428485
so the probability of A is point four five . 429485_431545
probability of B is point eight five . 432325_433945
point thirty five and when you add (th)em up and subtract it's point nine five . 435005_440665
so the probability of A or B or the probability of May probability of May or June is point nine five . 441865_450065
and that's that answer . 450785_451405
you can also do this &-uh with a Venn diagram . 451845_454185
either way is fine . 455785_457305
<if you see> &~it if you see things easier probably it's best to draw a Venn diagram . 457945_461485
but I can see things with formulae easier so I don't use the Venn diagrams . 462665_466865
are the events June gets an A in Stat one hundred and May gets an A in Stat one hundred independent ? 467985_473565
well now how would we calculate if things are independent +..? 474285_477745
but we know there's the independence formula this . 479845_483165
&=writes:board A +...
so if this happens we know they're independent . 483805_492845
if the probability of A times the probability of B is equal to the probability of A and B then they're independent +... 492925_498965
okay mkay and either way if they're independent then this is true and if this is true then they're independent . 501065_510385
it's a tautology . 510885_511645
there that was an ace English words for you . 512305_513765
okay are the events independent ? 514165_516805
okay so the probability of A is point four five . 517065_520205
probability of B is point eight five . 525635_526015
are they equal ? 526015_526495
so the probability of A and B well the probability of A and B is point thirty five . 527915_531035
it's not if these two &~mul &~t multiplied together is equal to point thirty five then they're independent . 533495_538255
did I do this right ?
it's point thirty eight two five . 539155_541455
so the answer is point thirty eight two five is not equal to point thirty five therefore they're not independent . 542495_550195
so they're not independent . 550515_552955
mkay ?
and you may think wow why shouldn't they should be independent . 555085_557725
they're two separate students in the class . 557865_559145
but I don't know you can always +//. 559425_562345
don't don't use logic <when you> when you &-uh solve stats problems . 562585_566165
just use numbers . 566345_566865
numbers work better than logic . 567425_568585
are the events June gets an A in Stat one hundred and May gets an A in Stat one hundred disjoint ? 569765_574185
are they ? 575165_577845
they're not . 579605_580145
they have thirty &~f &~fir thirty five percent chance that that will happen so they're not disjunct . 580435_584755
<if they had> if there was no events in common if there was no chance of that happening then they would be disjoint . 585075_590035
but since we have a chance of that happening they're not disjoint . 590255_593095
what is the probability that that either May or June gets an A in Stat one hundred . 594475_600355
okay ? 601575_602275
so the probability come on &=writes:board <we'll do> that here +... 602795_608615
that's the probability that neither an M or J is equal to the minus the probability that M or J gets it . 614395_622575
okay ?
M minus point thirty five so it's a only a five percent chance that neither of (th)em will get an A . 623655_630555
okay ? 631545_631745
question two +/. 632345_633745
+, what is the answer ? 634245_634785
+, what what do you mean ?
the probability of . 637185_638125
neither May +/. 638825_641225
oh neither okay +/.
+, mhm I'm sorry I I'm sorry I can't write very well . 641925_646485
&-uh question any questions for number one ? 647465_649385
let's move on to question number two . 650445_651985
X is distributed u@l thirty seven what does that mean ? 652785_656345
&=writes:board again three lower bound upper &~bou I think almost everyone did really well on the &~qui the exam for this question for drawing this so that's good . 656465_663945
and we want to find the height but we always label it density that's one over the max minus the Min one of them over seven minus three that's one out_of four . 664765_672885
okay so we have drawn this . 673165_674465
&{l=READING find the probability that X is greater than four &}l=READING well there's four +... 675165_679565
we want that probability . 681825_683085
remember probability is the same as area when you're doing uniform and area is equal to what height times width . 684605_692385
okay ? 693505_693545
it's equal to one fourth (be)cause that's the height times the width is &~s seven minus three which is three so thirty fourths . 693905_703105
so that's the probability X is greater than four +... 703545_706025
three out_of four . 708765_709385
okay . 709805_710285
and we want to find the probability so we want this now . 710555_714455
probability X is greater than four we have X . 716035_718975
okay . 719655_720455
now this slash I didn't write it in words but that means given . 720895_723515
so we wanna find the probability that X is greater than four given that X is less than six . 724255_728595
&~aw another rule another awesome formula that you must know probability of A given B sequence of the probability A and B divided by probability of B . 729665_742925
mkay ?
another formula that you must know so I don't know I happen to write three of the really important formulas that you must know for your quiz on Thursday and for your exam in a couple weeks so know this stuff that's good . 744605_755965
so then we can rewrite this statement from here be something like that . 756545_760245
so this is gonna be equal to the probability that X is greater than four and X is less than six . 761425_766925
divided by the probability that X is less than six . 767985_770945
mkay +...
so now when we wanna find the probability that X is greater than four but less than six . 772345_779865
so basically that means the probability that X is between four and six . 780065_782505
right ? 782845_783005
does everyone see that ? 784005_784585
we're greater than four and we're less than six . 784985_788085
so +...
that's the area we're looking for . 791405_793005
mkay .
so that's what that's equal to . 793725_798325
and it's again divided by the probability that X is <the systems> . 799105_801685
mkay ?
so this probability again area of a rectangle the base times the height the base here is six minus four is two times one fourth so it's two over four . 803705_813345
and the denominator is X is less than six base times height again . 815365_819505
six minus three is three height is still one fourth three out_of four +... 820225_823585
and that's two thirds . 824625_826625
okay so this probability is equal to two thirds . 827625_830465
so the probability that X is greater than four given X is less than six is two thirds as_well_as the probability that X is greater than four is thirty fourths . 831345_838365
are these two independent ? 839625_840745
well another rule see this rule +//. 841705_845805
we can also rewrite that as saying the probability of A given B &~probabil so if the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of A then they're independent +... 846285_858925
as well . 862815_863155
it's the same &~s it's actually the same statement as this one here just rewritten in a different way . 863515_867335
okay ? 868015_870915
so and we've we actually have done all this work already . 871195_873555
so the probability of X is greater than four given that X is less than six less this guy is two thirds is that equal to probability of +//. 873895_882915
that X is less than four X is greater than four excuse_me thirty fourths ? 883155_886735
it's not equal to so they're not independent . 886735_889555
okay ? 891235_891435
again this is just some of the stuff from chapter eight that you must know . 891635_897415
okay +...
today's lab +//. 901815_902535
does everyone know the game show Monty Hall ? 902695_904155
that's not what I &~thought Let's Make a Deal . 905715_906915
everyone know that game show ? 908575_909435
anyone know that game show ? 909595_910595
I used to love that game show . 910995_911915
we're doing a lab based on a game show . 912395_914875
so &-uh everyone needs to get with another person we're gonna have lab in groups today . 915385_923405
so get with &~i one more person so we can have groups of two and have all kinds of cool fun . 923925_929365
<take that> xxx mkay groups of two who doesn't have a group ?
you get the cool &~gr you don't have someone else you get the group of +/. 971385_973885
+, oh okay +/.
+, xxx okay group of three people . 974185_984245
if you can read this slip &{l=READING there are three doors . 984245_986085
behind one door is a car . 986325_987505
behind the other two doors is a goat &}l=READING +/. 988125_990045
+, idiots +/.
+, &{l=READING as a contestant you are asked to select a door with the idea that you will receive the prize behind the door . 991825_996285
the game show host &}l=READING you know Monty Hall &{l=READING knows what is behind each door . 996745_1000585
after you select the door the host opens one of the remaining doors that has a goat behind it . 1001025_1004645
note that &~mo that no matter what door you select at least one of the remaining doors will have a goat behind it for the host to open . 1005385_1010485
&}l=READING now explain just be certain you guys see that . 1011565_1014725
right okay . 1015545_1017845
so there's three doors . 1018845_1020825
one has a goat one has a goat and one has a car . 1021765_1024585
there's three doors . 1025715_1026555
again . 1026775_1026915
so now let's say this is I can't draw &~th draw draw doors very well . 1027195_1033835
door one door two door three . 1033995_1035515
&=laughs okay . 1038835_1039175
if you do if if let's say you select door one the game show host is gonna show you door two that has a goat behind it . 1039715_1047235
okay does everyone see that ? 1047375_1048095
if you select door two the game show host is gonna show you door number one which has a goat behind it . 1049555_1054475
and if you select door three the game show host will show you either door one or door two which has a goat behind it . 1055475_1060495
so either way you're going to see a &~ca a door with a goat behind it . 1061135_1065715
okay so that is the +//. 1066415_1068335
that is really what I want you to see so does everyone see that ? 1068595_1070315
so no matter what door you pick you're going to see a door with a goat behind it . 1071115_1075795
for example I have three cards here . 1076385_1079785
as you see there's two red cards and one black card . 1080925_1083025
this is a car these are goats . 1083565_1085825
they're not really goats but let's pretend . 1086385_1089305
okay ? 1090025_1090165
so I'm mixing the cards up okay ? 1090485_1094245
select a door one two or three . 1095205_1097345
+, two +/. 1099145_1099505
+, two .
you select door two I'm gonna show you this door right here which has is a goat . 1099845_1103405
so I can show you a goat all the time . 1103425_1105505
okay ?
now it doesn't matter again I can show you one more time . 1106265_1109925
you select this door &~ri initially I'm gonna show you one of these two doors which has a goat behind it . 1110605_1115585
if you select this door I'm gonna show you this door which has a goat behind it . 1116205_1119645
and if you select this door I'm gonna show you this door which has a goat behind it . 1120385_1123885
so either way you're going to see a goat . 1124545_1127505
okay that's the key . 1128385_1128965
now the big question is knowing that knowing Monty Hall always &~sh you know gives you the option he always shows you the one door and he asks you do you wanna stay or do you wanna switch ? 1129805_1138885
okay ? 1139265_1139865
now that's the big question that's what we're gonna investigate whether it's better to stay or better to switch . 1140345_1144585
now how many think that it doesn't really matter that you get no there's no real difference if you stay or you switch . 1145165_1149665
okay we got a couple . 1150525_1153365
good . 1153525_1153725
people are alive today . 1153945_1154645
how many thinks it really does make a difference that one is one gives you a greater probability than the other ? 1154965_1159965
which one gives you the greater one do you think ? 1160705_1161905
+, &-um if you switch . 1163005_1166445
+, you think switch ? 1166625_1167205
why ? 1167365_1167725
you don't know +/. 1167885_1168245
+, I don't +//. 1168385_1168645
I'm just guessing .
+, we're gonna +//. 1168925_1169285
yeah we're gonna take a look at it we're gonna investigate it . 1169425_1171285
&-um it's kind_of interesting if you read an article on the web that &-uh +//. 1171625_1175265
we'll talk about that later though . 1175425_1176465
okay it says &{l=READING note no matter what door you select at least one of the doors will have a goat behind it . 1177045_1181285
the host then gives you the option . 1181565_1182705
stay with the door you originally chose and get the prize behind it or switch and get the &~pri prize behind that . 1182765_1189085
what is the probability of winning if you stay ? 1190385_1191545
&}l=READING well I think we can almost guess that one but we'll get on to that later . 1192185_1197165
what is the probability of winning when you switch ? 1197485_1198845
does switching increase your chance of winning ? 1199305_1200925
does your neighbor agree with you ? 1201405_1202665
if the answer's not clear we can carry out a simulation which is what we're gonna do . 1203465_1206765
so each group that's why I have you in groups of two is going to get a set of three cards which I'll hand out right now . 1207585_1213405
again you're gonna get two red cards and one black card . 1214245_1216405
they're kind of big too so let's see and again the two red cards are your goats and the one black card is your car . 1217185_1227665
so we're gonna carry out a simulation and see which is +//. 1228925_1232065
is it better to switch or is it better to stay ? 1232245_1233885
(0.5) I think yeah .
let's see how many groups do we have today ? 1241065_1241685
we have one two three nine . 1241925_1245205
okay so we have nine groups . 1245505_1246545
okay <I need> +...
working with +//. 1247005_1253205
here's one way to simulate the game show . 1253385_1254585
which is the way we're gonna do it . 1254785_1255885
working with a partner designate one person to be the game show host . 1256525_1259625
the one person will be Monty Hall . 1260065_1261345
and the other person will be the person &-uh who is gonna be the contestant . 1261725_1265205
if you remember the game show they always had everyone dress up as you know oranges or bananas or tomatoes or something like that if you remember the game show . 1265425_1272425
I loved that game show so I &~re I remember that . 1272825_1274845
they always had people in costumes . 1274905_1275805
that was funny &{l=READING designate one person to be the game show host and the other to be the contestant . 1276725_1281185
you can switch roles halfway through the simulation . 1281305_1283245
the game show host controls the three doors represented by the three index cards . 1283905_1287285
&}l=READING playing cards in this case . 1288105_1288905
and what's gonna happen is the &~s the contestant will select a door . 1290745_1294105
just from experience it's faster to just point to a door rather than say one two or three (be)cause is it is this one or is this one you know just say I select this door . 1295125_1303625
okay when you're the contestant . 1304305_1305585
I select this door . 1305845_1306525
and then the &~g game show host is gonna show you a door with a goat behind it . 1307185_1310445
again I showed you before you can always find a door with a goat behind it . 1310645_1314265
you show them one of the doors they did not select that has a goat behind it . 1314345_1317805
okay ? 1318245_1318265
so you would show them this door <if they select it> it has a goat . 1319025_1321125
okay ? 1321485_1321605
and then the person will either switch or the person will stay and we're gonna tally and see <how many> &~chan how many times you're going to win . 1321685_1327825
mkay ?
now this &~is the host &~clo you can either lay (th)em down like this like you know do it like Three_Card Monte you know that but we don't they're not bent so you really can't do it . 1328265_1339525
so it's probably easier just to you know hold (th)em like this and then have someone select . 1339685_1344045
okay ? 1344825_1345085
and keep a record list of your &-uh results either staying or switching either winning a car or winning a goat one should perform any repetitions you can do you &~re use the relative frequencies to estimate it corresponding probabilities . 1346225_1360025
you turn the page over and see we have strategy win strategy stay . 1360325_1364585
and we're gonna do this twenty times each . 1365485_1367225
so each group will do it twenty times . 1367485_1368625
and we're not gonna randomly select people of either &~s you know you're gonna switch half the time stay half the time . 1369105_1374005
what it's gonna do is you guys are gonna stay &-um stay stay and stay . 1374405_1381105
and then <switch switch> switch switch switch . 1381645_1383545
does everyone know who's staying ? 1383725_1384745
mkay <stay stay> stay stay <switch switch> switch switch switch okay ? 1385625_1392465
so you're gonna do this twenty times mkay ? 1393345_1396205
and again we can practice one more time . 1397005_1399085
so if you're staying okay select a door . 1399305_1403425
okay so I'm gonna show you this <you're staying> you're staying so you would've won . 1405965_1410285
okay ?
so you would've won . 1411205_1411905

okay let's tally our results and see empirically what the answers should be . 1851685_1859485
okay so groups that stayed how many did you guys get Anne Marie how many did you get ? 1859905_1865665

&=writes:board eight five five six . 1866345_1870905

so we had thirty five thirty five wins . 1885325_1898985
this is out_of there was four groups so it was out_of eighty total . 1900325_1902505
now let's do switch . 1905625_1906505

is that everyone ?
<looks like that's everyone> five ten fifteen twenty sixty five . 1953825_1962285
this is out_of a hundred (be)cause we have five groups . 1963825_1965505
okay so now we can calculate these empirical probabilities . 1965985_1968445
I can do the one in my head I don't think I can do the other one . 1969125_1971205
let's see .
so let's see we have thirty five out_of eighty . 1976175_1979015
wow that's pretty good .
four thirty five and this one I can guess is <four six five> . 1979975_1986115
okay ? 1986415_1987475
so now <if you> if you listen to the numbers posted we had a_lot_of pretty big ones for switching . 1989195_1994015
and actually it is true . 1994735_1996055
switching does help you win . 1996415_1997355
you win two thirds of the time as opposed to one third of the time if you stay . 1997395_2002275
and I'll just show you really fast why . 2002515_2003795
I think some of the groups figured it out fairly quickly okay . 2004255_2009655
so let's just say for instance door one is the car so goat goat . 2010735_2016895
okay .
if if you pick door one and you stay you would win . 2018795_2023655
okay ? 2024675_2025015
so if you stay and you picked one you picked door one you would win you pick door two you'd lose pick door three you would lose . 2025145_2037785
okay ? 2037985_2038965
now if you switch +... 2039485_2040845
and you pick door one okay you pick door one . 2041545_2046245
okay ?
&~ga Monty Hall's gonna show you door two . 2046285_2049245
you're gonna switch over to door three but you're gonna lose . 2050165_2052725
you're gonna get a goat so you'd lose . 2052895_2054375
if you pick door two initially pick door two Monty Hall's gonna show you door three . 2054855_2059975
okay ? 2060755_2060895
(be)cause that's the losing one . 2060915_2061735
you &~ca and you're gonna switch over back to door one so you're gonna switch over to a win . 2062635_2065315
and if you pick door three Monty Hall's gonna show you door two which is a loss but you're gonna switch over and you'll win . 2066155_2073575
so the actual probabilities you're gonna win two thirds of the time that you switch and you're gonna win one third of the time if you stay . 2075105_2081765
<that's the> &~empir that's the actual probabilities . 2083145_2085125
empirically we can see we're pretty close here point six five is really close to two thirds . 2085705_2090105
&-um point four seven five &~i again it's kind_of big but we had one group that was really really big so that's why I think that that happened to be little bit higher than than it did . 2091345_2099425
if we did more repetitions obviously we only did eighty repetitions if we did you know two three thousand we'd get numbers really close to one third and two thirds . 2099945_2107105
okay ? 2107825_2108545
so basically does everyone see why it pays to switch ? 2108865_2112345
okay ? 2112945_2113405
so if you're ever on the game show you know you should always switch . 2113685_2115625
basically the only way you win if you stay is if you happen to guess correctly initially and get the car right away . 2115985_2121465
if you're switching the only way you lose is if you guess correctly right away . 2122245_2126705
so <it's kinda> it's kinda weird the way that that works . 2127375_2129915
so when you switch when you when your strategy's switching you really wanna guess the wrong door initially then you're gonna win once you switch . 2130135_2136835
so and the thing is you've got a greater chance of picking the wrong door than picking the right door initially so that's why it's always better to have switching rather than staying . 2137575_2147995
let's see . 2148455_2148755
what else do we have here ? 2149315_2150075
number of wins using this . 2151055_2153495
what did you estimate the probability of this xxx what strategy appears to be best again switching is the best just because we can show empirically it's better and we can show actually it's better . 2154485_2165505
now if you go on the web page the Stat one hundred web page under I think other information maybe I think it's there . 2166205_2171645
they have on there an actual article by statisticians and mathematicians arguing this exact problem . 2172245_2178345
I mean they have nothing to do in their free time other than arguing this particular problem but you you get really you know well known statisticians actually arguing that it's better to stay rather than switch . 2178685_2189185
and we could show right here you know within you know half an hour that it's it's better to switch . 2189325_2193705
even just doing it empirically it's better to switch than it is to stay . 2194185_2197285
you can show it actually fairly easily in this problem . 2197385_2200225
okay ? 2200845_2200905
so let's see what time we've got any questions from the lab ? 2203145_2206165

okay ? 2376885_2377045
so we wanna find the probability it'll go through in less than ten seconds . 2377445_2380545
so there's time . 2380905_2382605
we wanna find this area +... 2383465_2384545
correct ? 2387015_2387435
does everyone see that ? 2387575_2388875
okay so again we just use normal CDF right ? 2390755_2394735
normal CDF lower bound is negative infinity upper bound is ten . 2397695_2403335
the mean$n is twenty standard deviation is five (0.10) and it's negative E nine nine ten count to twenty da@i da@i da@i and we get nine zero two two eight . 2403925_2427525
okay +..? 2428385_2428445
what is the probability that it will take longer than thirty two seconds for a long distance phone call to Australia ? 2431405_2436125
okay ? 2437305_2437685
thirty two +... 2440245_2442105
there's thirty two . 2444425_2446345
okay . 2447345_2448765
again it's the same thing normal CDF the lower bound in this case though is thirty two the upper bound is positive infinity mean is still twenty standard deviation is still five and we get do do do thirty two okay +... 2449025_2468645
&-uh point zero zero eight two . 2472305_2474845
okay ? 2476965_2477245
(0.6) what else you guys got ? 2477445_2484045
give me your best shot . 2484785_2485805
fire away (0.15) questions ? 2486105_2501245
(0.12) .
how about a graphed one at the end ? 2513205_2514025
which one ? 2514585_2514945
one of those graphed ones at the end ? 2514985_2516165
it might have been in the next chapter . 2517465_2518925
yeah .
I'm not sure +//. 2519225_2521525
graphed ?
there's some well reading graphs and stuff . 2522425_2524585
oh you mean like reading &-um let's see . 2525005_2528265
they're probably in like like in nine nine two or something . 2528285_2531225
xxx (0.7) .
do you have a page number maybe on that ? 2531625_2540505
&-uh it's four thirty four thirty four +/. 2540665_2542945
+, <I think> exercise nine two .
nine two .
okay we could do that . 2544825_2548185
⌊ to &~est ⌋ +/. 2548345_2548465
+, &{l=READING to estimate the parameter Theta from a given population three different estimators were proposed . 2549245_2553765
the graphs of the sampling distributions of the three estimators are shown at the right note that the all three graphs have the same scale . 2554545_2561365
which estimators are unbiased ? 2562365_2563885
&}l=READING now unbiased means that what is the &~definit I I always like saying more often than not <you're getting at> the right answer but . 2564565_2569585
you're doing nine two ? 2569745_2570385
yeah nine point two page &-uh thirty fifty four . 2570805_2574645
I don't wanna give you guys the wrong answer wrong &-uh definition for biased unbiased sorry +... 2575965_2582145
oh unbiased sure .
&{l=READING a statistic is unbiased if the center of the sampling distribution is equal to the corresponding population parameter value . 2585665_2591625
&}l=READING that's the book definition like I say more often than not getting at the right answer . 2592545_2596025
that's what I my definition of unbiased is . 2596285_2597805
know the book one though practically I I practically will use the one that I know but book one's more important to know . 2598245_2604705
estimator one as you see the centered right on the parameter so that is unbiased . 2605385_2609645
estimator two more often than not we're going to get the right answer . 2610525_2614005
that's also unbiased . 2614445_2615145
estimator three as you can see the center is not even close to Theta well it's like a unit or two away so that's &~un that is biased . 2616155_2624275
so estimator three is biased one and two are not biased . 2625395_2627295
of estimators one and two which would you select and why +..? 2628615_2632235
well we know they're both unbiased so now we wanna probably have to take the one with less variability . 2634895_2641055
that would be that's always the two key things we want in an estimator . 2641905_2645225
we want it to be &{l=WRITING unbiased and low variability +... 2645405_2652085
&}l=WRITING that's the two &~th key things in an estimator to have . 2655585_2657285
now again we measured variability as the standard deviation of variance by how far away the &-uh the all the &-uh parameter the &-uh xxx all the &-uh estimates mkay are away from the mean$n . 2659215_2673895
so how far away is everything away from the mean$n ? 2673895_2676015
and in this case as we see for estimator one which looks like a normal curve +... 2676355_2682375
&=writes:board okay and estimator two was like &=sound_effect okay ? 2688715_2693075
which one has more values closer to the mean$n ? 2693075_2700515
right ?
which has less variability ? 2701355_2702495
this guy does . 2703415_2703875
right ?
(be)cause here we have these guys spread far apart from the mean$n and here we have a_lot centered clustered right around the mean$n . 2704995_2711515
so &~s estimator one has less variability . 2711695_2713395
therefore it would probably be the one you would select . 2713995_2717715
because it has less variability . 2718135_2719095
part C . 2720695_2721735
which estimator has the smallest variability ? 2722255_2724155
and that's the one where it's tightly &~cru clustered around its mean . 2724835_2727695
okay .
so in this case estimator three as you can see the values even though it's not on target it's tightly clustered around where it is on target for . 2729455_2739655
so that estimator has the lowest variability . 2740115_2742135
(0.5) .
is that C wait was that C ? 2744775_2748295
yeah . 2748475_2748615
estimator three has the lowest overall variability even though it might not be on target . 2749755_2754555
or wholly on target . 2755215_2756155
&{l=READING based on the sampling distributions which estimator is the best estimator of Theta ? 2756935_2761735
&}l=READING now and again we want an unbiased estimator and we want low variability . 2762255_2768115
so if we get to be really concerned about low variability we'd probably pick estimator three even though it's a little bit biased . 2769155_2775075
but if we wanted unbiasedness we'd probably pick estimator one . 2775655_2778095
because it's got +//. 2778795_2779355
it's on target it's unbiased but although it has high variability . 2779795_2782495
so that's kind_of like a toss up question . 2783435_2785415
which which do you think is more important ? 2786055_2787195
to have low variability or to have unbiasedness . 2787315_2789435
okay ? 2789955_2790235
so you can answer that question any particular way you choose . 2790515_2794115
as long as you make a good rational argument for it . 2795895_2800875
(0.6) okay . 2803335_2807855
you guys have class now . 2809275_2811135
