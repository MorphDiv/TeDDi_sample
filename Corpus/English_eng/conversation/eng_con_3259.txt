okay, page one sixty one . 0_12155
uh, we have learned something about the square, do you remember ? 12155_17341
no . 17341_18208
no ? 18208_18848
so uh, we have learned for example, I give you a +... 18848_22680
question for you to think about . 22680_26188
so first of all, what is the square of three ? 26188_34110
what is the square of three ? 34110_37668
so so that you may understand what is the square of . 37668_42256
six, six . 42256_43180
six . 43180_44138
so what is the answer ? 44138_46563
six . 46563_47753
nine . 47753_48153
nine . 48153_48538
six ? 48538_48961
yes ? 48961_49538
uh, Leung Chi Fu . 49538_50866
nine . 50866_52540
nine, yes . 52540_53636
so uh, we can answer the question like that the square of three +... 53636_59853
is equal to nine nine . 59853_63225
right . 63225_63745
so you can show the step . 63745_64848
what is the square of nine ? 64848_66381
you can use mathnotics sorry, mathematical notation . 66381_70090
how to write the square of three ? 70090_72448
Fung Chi Pui . 72448_73618
three times three . 73618_75048
three times three . 75048_75681
and then, there is a step, the square of three . 75681_81265
so, can you write a mathematical notation ? 81265_85073
uh, Mung Wing Chi . 85073_88865
the square . 88865_89908
the square of three ? 89908_91041
so that can you write it on the blackboard ? 91041_92936
&=laugh xxx . 92936_93458
are you tall enough ? 93458_95540
are you tall enough ? 95540_96406
wow, so long . 96406_98813
very big . 98813_99188
yes . 99188_99580
uh, the square of three, you can write, uh, at the same as this . 99580_104035
so that it the meaning of uh, square of three is equal to three times three . 104035_108526
so the answer is nine, okay ? 108526_110445
so, what is the square of negative three ? 110445_114666
negative three . 114666_121980
so can you show the step ? 121980_124235
okay, the first the first line, what do you what do you write ? 124235_129958
Wong On Kei . 129958_131806
the first line . 131806_136916
okay . 136916_143381
so, have you found out there's something missing . 143381_146331
so you must write down what do you what did you find out ? 146331_149660
what did you find ? 149660_150581
okay, uh, next . 150581_153550
oh, you you can answer it again . 153550_155670
the square of +... 155670_162036
negative three . 162036_169935
so, the square of negative three, you can write like this . 169935_173411
and then, square means ? 173411_175211
what's the what's the meaning of square ? 175211_179668
so the answer next step, what do you write ? 179668_182715
Ng Hoi Yan . 182715_183646
can you answer me ? 183646_187133
I want to write . 187133_188101
okay . 188101_188925
&~neg negative three times negative three . 188925_197588
okay ? 197588_198051
so the answer is what's the answer ? 198051_200210
you can answer me . 200210_201523
uh, orally, so uh, Chan Wai Yan . 201523_206540
nine . 206540_207923
nine . 207923_208496
okay, now uh, we will learn another another type of question . 208496_214940
okay . 214940_240178
now, what is the positive value of a@l if the square of a@l is nine ? 240178_247191
so can you find the answers ? 247191_252926
so what is the positive value of nine ? 252926_256231
Law Oi Ping . 256231_257548
three . 257548_259258
three . 259258_259746
so how can you do that ? 259746_261456
how can you how can you find the answers ? 261456_264340
so first of all, you must express the square of a@l equals nine . 264340_271035
so you can write an equation about a@l and nine . 271035_273871
so, can what do you write on the left hand side ? 273871_276621
wong Chun Kei . 276621_279086
a times a@l . 279086_280455
a times a@l . 280455_282295
or ? 282295_282701
three squared . 282701_284718
yes, write the little two on the top . 284718_287598
the square of a@l equals nine, okay ? 287598_292278
so then now, we want to find a@l . 292278_293298
so some of you say, the answer is three . 293298_296775
so I I think you can go oh three times three is nine, so the answer is three . 296775_302141
uh, I will teach you a step to solve . 302141_304678
so, uh, if you find the uh, the value of a@l, you can write like this . 304678_309086
so a@l, you want to find a@l, then this side, you put square root, okay ? 309086_314448
so this sign this signs +... 314448_316908
we call it radical signs . 316908_323306
radical sign, okay ? 323306_324730
radical sign . 324730_325318
so what is the meaning of this radical sign ? 325318_327618
so the meaning is the same as this sentence . 327618_331768
okay ? 331768_332896
square root of nine means to find a positive value of a@l, a@l huh, if the square of a@l is nine, okay ? 332896_343415
square root of nine to find a value . 343415_346020
to find a positive value . 346020_348973
its square equals to nine . 348973_353115
okay ? 353115_353603
do you know do you understand what's the what is the meaning of square root of a number ? 353603_359593
yes, okay . 359593_360786
so now, number two . 360786_363263
what is the negative value of a@l if the square of a@l is nine ? 363263_380145
so the result is the same, the square of a@l is nine . 380145_385205
but now, you want to find the negative number . 385205_387615
can you find the answer ? 387615_388463
yes . 388463_389695
Yeung Suk Ping . 389695_396118
negative three . 396118_397878
negative three . 397878_398708
so how can you find that ? 398708_400193
how can you find that ? 400193_401783
so first of all, if the square of a@l is nine, then you can write an equation . 401783_406666
so, can you write an equation for me ? 406666_409928
lo Chi Hung . 409928_414608
so now, in this question, you want to find the negative value of a@l . 414608_427408
what is the difference ? 427408_428911
what is the difference between this part and the and the previous question ? 428911_434848
good . 434848_440725
but now a@l, a@l is a negative number, not negati(ve) negative a@l . 440725_445948
so the square of a@l the square of a@l is nine . 445948_452440
yes . 452440_452916
haha . 452916_455110
is there any question ? 455110_457348
if the square of a@l, so which number ? 457348_459878
the square of which number ? 459878_461281
&=laugher . 461281_465130
the square of a@l . 465130_474993
you just write this sentence as a as an equation, as an equation . 474993_481106
the square of a@l is a@l . 481106_481663
why ? 481663_482196
yes, good . 482196_484373
okay, so a@l uh, square of a@l equals nine . 484373_488316
so now, you will you know that, the answer is negative three . 488316_493148
why ? 493148_493678
because you you know because you know that, negative three times negative three equals nine . 493678_502048
so negative three squared equals nine . 502048_504630
so the answer, compared of this equation, a@l is negative three, okay ? 504630_509340
so now, can we, uh, show the step like this ? 509340_513163
so, first of all, what is the difference ? 513163_516995
so a@l is equal to the square root of nine . 516995_521288
is it the same ? 521288_523241
no . 523241_524128
no, so you must add +... 524128_525951
&~neg negative . 525951_527070
&=bell Kwong Wai Kit . 527070_528695
yes, just just talk . 528695_532975
uh, a negative xxx equation . 532975_536401
&=laughs . 536401_536840
another sign ? 536840_539788
uh . 539788_541246
in +... 541246_542085
he wants to be on camera . 542085_544295
&=laughts . 544295_544615
yes, in here . 544615_545061
okay ? 545061_545440
negative sign in front of the square root . 545440_548191
so if you want to find the negative value, then in in front of the, uh, square root +... 548191_556805
before the square root, you write a negative sign . 556805_559550
so that you can get the answer is negative three . 559550_562045
