can you tell me what you're doing and where you're . 7120_9350
oh wait . 10820_11100
wait wait . 11640_11960
wait . 13050_13780
because my microphone full apart . 14530_17510
okay . 18670_18790
making . 23000_23170
make . 26720_26840
we're . 28070_28370
we're making four squares . 31340_32770
for . 33920_33990
a strip to see what kind of to see what sorts of strips we want in
do you have to color both sides . 47080_48870
mhm . 49480_49780
yeah why but I don't . 50090_51520
'cause if we were going to flip it like that it would that would
and &-um so I put and it would just be like it would be just be
so you just don't have to turn it especially for &-um especially
you can't really turn . 83980_85040
you can turn it . 85330_86210
but and it's just hard to &-um it flips it makes it the same exact
only it gives you different different places to &-um . 96010_101690
if you flip it slip it . 102160_103300
mhm . 103770_103940
if your scores were going to be different than you flip it &-um
for this one it would be exactly the same . 114720_118320
but some parts would be in different places . 118880_121560
and . 123360_123530
like that would be like that . 124330_127650
or something gonna make lots_of different strip designs . 128280_136640
you're gonna show me all the possibilities for strips . 136840_139840
okay . 140230_140370
this with an up down for an up down flip . 140490_147440
Nathan and are going talk to Katie and Sarah and find out what to
and they do with graph . 157220_158250
an up and . 159200_159680
down one . 159740_160890
point up down . 163450_164050
flip this corner would be where this corner is . 164130_166600
uhhuh . 167030_167320
but the diagonal flip it would just be exactly the same . 169960_173800
either a sideways flip or an up down . 174880_178600
flip pin would be this different . 178810_180750
thank You I'll come back to Ben . 183690_187580
in a second . 188300_188830
tell me what you think of when you think of a pinwheel design . 191030_193470
just wait one second .
I'm gonna move this strip a little bit . 195080_196470
so it's not so it's where we can all see it easily . 196760_198670
now . 199530_199660
is this a possible strip from your foursquare . 200180_203350
yeah . 204010_204100
so this is one way a strip could look . 204140_205990
but what you were just talking to me about what was that . 206370_209420
you were hoping to make a strip that had some kind of a pinwheel
when you say pinwheel design . 214520_215700
tell me what that means . 215720_216740
and I'll see if we can problem solve together . 216980_219030
it's like a pin sort that &-um goes like this . 219230_222300
and then it maybe so it looks like kind of like a saw or a point
okay . 228590_228860
how many colors does it take to make a pin wheel design . 229190_231350
two . 232140_232260
two . 232940_233020
okay . 233550_233710
can you show me any part anywhere on any of the core squares that
because if we could find a part that's half maybe we can put
wait . 250750_250870
which part because you're saying this whole thing looks like half .
<this looks> this looks like a half . 253880_255190
oh so that's the kind of pinwheel this . 256620_258269
well that if that looks like half if that looks like half . 258510_261980
and you put another half with it like you guys did before you end
like we just that was the first strip you showed me . 266240_268860
had these all got out_of position . 269020_272150
but . 272200_278390
of_course . 272460_272780
&-um if we could put like a goal two by two design but we can't . 273460_278130
uhhuh . 278510_278640
what happens . 280310_280870
&-um . 281260_281460
what . 283150_283340
happens if . 283440_284140
what . 286710_286980
happens if these come together . 287000_288260
what's . 290280_290510
what happens there . 290720_291500
oh different . 293020_293680
like a bow rain . 295460_296380
touch is green . 296400_296980
and like a bow tie . 297020_299070
it's like a bow tie . 299520_300090
mhm . 300480_300750
wor out rest . 300900_301780
see . 303540_303700
oh it goes like this . 305070_305940
what would the rest of the strip look like . 307490_309100
if you wanted to trip a strip that would kind of repeat this design
how would you do that . 312460_313260
oh <I know I know> I know . 313860_315470
<wait wait> wait . 315950_316310
we'll have to finish that on both sides of . 316360_317900
wait . 319310_319420
wait like that . 319750_321510
no . 321780_321910
no . 322300_322420
wait this . 322520_322890
we go like that . 323950_324380
no . 324740_324860
no . 325220_325280
you touch the screen . 327170_327990
oh okay . 328680_329060
so you wanna make triangles there . 329170_330460
and then here and then Justin you take these two and put it on that
so he got the green and red bow tie in the middle . 335740_337620
and he made sure that the triangles that resulted here were the
so let's see . 342160_342950
would that be right . 343170_343740
no . 344110_344220
no . 344660_344780
let him keep . 345460_346120
there you go . 347730_348350
okay . 348910_349180
and now how are you gonna make that hourglass bow tie kind of
okay . 354550_354820
let's see . 355730_356150
oh Brian please please pay attention to what's going on . 356260_359430
so you end up each time with the kind of as Justin put it bow tie
and then Paul's idea was keep the triangles that happen along the
so here I see a triangle of green . 374500_375820
and here a red and the bottom of green . 375840_377260
and then a triangle of red . 377300_378510
hmm .
that's an interesting design for this . 379240_380620
right . 380640_380810
wait but wait . 380910_381780
wait . 381800_381950
don't move that . 382000_382510
no . 382670_382820
he has that in the right position . 382840_383940
he has that in the right position that was not . 384540_386230
a . 386350_387540
bow tie . 386440_386830
yes . 387620_387650
it is two triangles right . 387930_389020
that wasn't right . 389040_389610
we didn't . 390380_390640
this is what your next step is . 392450_393870
though as each you're gonna keep on trying different combinations
but you'll never just be able to remember all of those . 398740_401460
and we wouldn't be able to see all of them unless you make some
and what we're gonna use to help us do that as a tool is graph
hold on just . 411140_411580
okay . 413830_414070
then what I don't don't not yet hold on . 414510_418390
I'll be right there . 422450_422980
ladies . 423000_423150
you . 423540_423700
next . 423830_424070
just a second . 425390_425770
uhhuh . 427050_427210
because what you're gonna do is just like when you made the
so actually I don't think any of you got to that part of the quilt
did you . 435400_435670
so this is gonna be a lot more challenging for you . 436100_438210
'cause you haven't had any practice . 438620_439860
you got to use the squares on the graph paper . 440390_442620
just like the squares on here to make a mot &-um a record of your
we'll be able to see exactly what this strip will be like . 448600_450780
uhhuh . 451840_451980
red and green colored pencils you'll need . 452260_454150
and when you guys get this one all colored in Brian are you
you're the only one left in your group . 457440_458660
when you get this this strip all recorded at your graph paper
have somebody in your group come and get me so that I can come look
okay . 478790_478900
okay . 479250_479420
you'll Ryan you're gonna need a red colored pencil and a green
okay . 484300_484390
because you guys this was a long time ago to make sure your paper's
so a strip goes across this way not across this way . 489010_491000
'cause you can fit more strips in this way . 491380_492860
kitty get cracking . 493170_494230
alright . 494280_494630
I wanna see this . 495000_495700
strip . 496660_496860
recorded . 497160_497260
I need to use your green color pencil because my green isn't good .
Nathan that's yellow green . 529690_533270
I can't even find my like . 535600_540940
wait maybe not I mean who knows . 543110_544530
hmm . 547320_547670
I think it's found it . 547720_548630
Teddy so let's ask take go sharpen it Nathan Nathan while he's
can you explain it to me . 558610_559700
how you made that design . 559740_560830
what did you have to do with your horse . 560950_562750
I just look and turn it a lot . 563030_564170
can you go . 566700_567030
