have a seat, al . 3490_9980
right, ready to start guys .
now, what we're doing today .
as you can probably see, we've got kidneys around the room, so we're going to do a kidney dissection . 9980_14110
now we've started talking about, with this topic, we've talked about excretion . 14110_17990
right, so have a seat there . 17990_18110
what we've done, we've started talking about excretion .
so first of all, we've said excretion is when wastes are removed from the body . 18110_31940
so excretion is when wastes are removed from the body . 31940_33980
for example, when we breathe out we get rid of some wastes from our from our blood . 33980_38120
what sort of wastes do we get rid of from our from our blood when we breathe out, harry ? 38120_41940
carbon dioxide . 41940_42010
carbon dioxide . 42010_47950
okay .
so one form of excretion is when we breathe out and we excrete carbon dioxide .
right another form is the kidneys and that's also involved in excretion . 47950_52090
right, so what waste stand there please what waste is removed from the blood by the kidneys ? 52090_59940
so what waste is removed by the blood from the kidneys ? 59940_64160
we talked about this last lesson .
who can remember ?
harry ?
what's it called ? 64160_65900
it starts with u .
urea . 65900_67030
urea, right . 67030_71090
now urea is made when the body breaks down protein .
if there's too much urea in the blood, it's a poison, it has to be got rid of . 71090_78940
so that the kidneys filter out the urea .
what else do they get out of the blood ? 78940_82980
so they get urea out of the blood and they get something else out of the blood .
yeah ?
carbon dioxide . 82980_83160
no, they don't get carbon dioxide out of the blood . 83160_86980
what else do they get out of the blood ?
oxygen . 86980_87900
no, they don't get oxygen out of the blood . 87900_89170
yep ?
water . 89170_89910
water, well done . 89910_96900
okay, so the kidneys, they filter two things out of the blood .
they filter urea and they filter water .
right . 96900_99990
when you mix the two together what do you get ?
can you tell me ?
tony ?
urine . 99990_100170
urine well done . 100170_106970
okay, so you mix urea with u with ah water and you end up with urine .
right .
as you walked in, you should have got a sheet, but no+one did, so we'll hand these out . 106970_111900
can you hand those out please ? 111900_114130
give one to everyone .
right, first of all get your homework out please . 114130_117090
now we want to you had to cut out um sections of the kidneys for homework . 117090_122890
let's go through and label the different parts . 122890_132960
sir, is that right ? 132960_134010
yeah, that's right . 134010_143940
I didn't get to finish it, sir . 143940_149040
so on your, the one you did for homework, let's just go through and label the different parts . 149040_156950
I've already labeled them on mine .
i'll just rub that writing off the board . 156950_164060
I want you to label these on your sheet .
these are the parts of the kidney we're going to look at today . 164060_167040
right, so first of all, up the top of the kidney, the top part and the outside of the kidney is called the cortex . 167040_175050
so use your ruler, draw a line from the top part of the kidney, opened up from the inside and that's called the cortex . 175050_183910
so label that on yours please . 183910_185090
open up the flap of the of the ah fr open the kidney up . 185090_199090
label the cortex .
it's just the part there .
so the cortex is the part here .
that part there . 199090_208070
so it's the outside of the kidneys if you like .
so the outside of the kidneys is called the cortex .
next part . 208070_215160
this part here is called the bowman's capsule, but that's been really highly, highly magnified .
so that's it's much, much bigger there that what it is normally . 215160_218890
have you got a note, karen ?
okay, can you hand in the note please ? 218890_223020
so it's been really magnified .
so label those two parts, the bow the cortex and the bowman's capsule . 223020_236020
next part . 236020_241900
the really dark red part, which is involved in the filtering the blood .
yep ?
I left it on the bus . 241900_242950
on the bus, okay, we're just um you'll just have to copy someone else's book for homework . 242950_248930
okay .
right .
medulla is this part here, the dark red part . 248930_251890
so when you colour in that dark red part in the centre of the kidney, it's called the medulla . 251890_261050
so the medulla is the part of the kidney involved in filtering the blood . 261050_264890
so that filters the blood, and it filters out the urea, filters out the water . 264890_269150
come give me your note ? 269150_278110
thanks, have a seat .
close the door .
right, and so I said the medulla's the part that filters out the urea and it filters out the water . 278110_281960
what happens if it breaks down ? 281960_283130
and it builds up with too much urea and so you get poisoned . 287060_289990
okay . 289990_290180
there's too much urea there, it's too concentrated and it starts to break down your body cells and so you die . 290180_295160
yep . 295160_302100
so the medulla filters out the urea, it filters out the water and it collects here in the pelvis .
so label the pelvis, pev@k, pe@k, pelvis@k . 302100_308160
and it collects in the pelvis . 308160_316950
it runs down to the bladder in a tube called the ureter . 316950_321160
okay, in a tube called a ureter . 321160_323990
okay, so, it gets filtered out in the medulla, it collects in the pelvis and it goes down the ureter, a tube down to the bladder . 323990_331950
so label the bladder, which is down there . 331950_334010
there's your bladder .
yep . 334010_337940
sir . 337940_338990
we didn't get that on the sheet . 338990_339030
okay, i'll have to give you the sheet, and you'll have to catch it up . 339030_344960
okay .
but just watch for the moment just so just learn the parts yourself . 344960_347150
you'll have to catch it up later, but this is important to understand this for the dissection . 347150_351000
okay . 351000_354990
understand the different parts .
because you're going to find these different parts on your kidney .
all right .
do we get one each ? 354990_355160
no, one per group . 355160_361970
right, so here's your bladder .
last part is your urethra .
and that's the part that goes from the bladder to the outside . 361970_365080
okay .
so the urethra is a tube going from the bladder to the outside . 365080_371120
yeah, john .
what type of kidneys ? 371120_372990
okay, we've got sheep's kidneys here, and I've also got some ox kidneys, and i'll show you those in a little while . 372990_376890
can I have an ox one ? 376890_378130
sir, what's this part here called ? 378130_380170
ah, the ureter . 380170_396910
all right, everybody copied that down ? 396910_398890
so what we're going to do is we're going to go through the dissection sheet with you . 398890_401060
then you guys are going to dissect the um, kidney . 401060_405990
and then we're going to put the results together .
what we've found .
what the diff where the different parts are, and what the different parts do . 405990_409990
yep . 410050_411010
it's all yuk xxx . 411010_415900
isn't it supposed to be brown or something ?
it's all white . 415900_420180
um, that's right, good question .
there's my big picture of the kidney .
i'll just leave that up .
is that an ox one ? 420180_421070
it's because it's not conceiving any blood or xxx . 421070_423170
xxx that's the one there . 423170_431040
all right, now you there's some good questions .
you can see the ones as you walked in, they're covered in a white material . 431040_438940
okay, so here is okay, i'll fix it up in a minute .
here is two kidneys out of an ox . 438940_444010
now as you can see, this is how they normally come .
this is what so straight out of the animal, this is what it normally looks like . 444010_446100
how many can tell me what you think that white material is ? 446100_449990
there you are, al .
fat . 449990_450010
fat . 450010_456040
okay, so both kidneys, in our bodies also, the kidneys are surrounded by fat .
all right, so to protect them and also to insulate them . 456040_459160
yeah, julia ?
how big are our kidneys ? 459160_463110
in our body like how big are they ?
how big are they ? 463110_466070
okay, so about the same size as your fist again .
so a bit a bit s so it's a bit smaller than the heart . 466070_470910
so your heart's about the same size as your fist .
kidneys are a little bit smaller . 470910_473000
all right . 473000_479910
all right, so have your sheet out there in front of you .
I'm going to go through the steps of the dissection .
you're going to do a number of things . 479910_482990
i'll just get that in the right spot there .
all right, first of all, you have to remove the fat off the off the kidneys . 482990_495920
so you need a pair of scissors for that .
so first of all remove the fat from r the outside of the kidneys . 495920_503020
it takes a little while .
oh yuck . 507000_509090
that's mad .
does it come off easily ? 509090_510130
yeah, the fat comes off really easily . 510130_515070
it's probably easier just to to pull it off .
but as you pull it off, there's one thing to be careful of . 515070_520080
there's a number of tubes coming out of the kidney .
don't rip them out . 520080_521010
you don't want to rip them out . 521010_522010
so peel peel the fat off from all around the kidney on the outside, except for around where the tubes are . 522010_527000
and where the tubes are, use a pair of scissors or the scalpel . 527000_532090
now, i'll show you how to use the scalpel . 532090_541010
scalpels are not for using like this, al .
scalpels aren't to be used like this, okay .
the way you use a scalpel is by using it to push the the meat away, or the fat away . 541010_546080
so you sort of scrape it with a scalpel . 546080_552020
that sort of cuts it as well .
so you don't cut things with a scalpel like that .
you cut it by scraping like that . 552020_563080
right, so remove all the fat .
i'll i'll be ruthless and just pull the tubes off .
I got lucky .
oh, there's the vein xxx . 563080_564990
okay so there's you can see that there . 564990_572890
there's the ureter .
there's an artery .
no, there's a vein and there's an artery .
as I said, the dissection's quite simple . 572890_574930
and you cut all the way around like this . 586930_590900
so you can hold it here don't want to touch .
if you don't want to touch it you can use a pair of tweezers . 590900_593010
do people eat kidneys ? 593010_594170
people eat kidneys, yeah . 594170_597050
steak and kidney pie .
steak and kidney pie .
just like eating a xxx . 597050_610100
so you see how I'm cutting it . 610100_614010
guys look at look at what I'm doing please .
how far in, sir ? 616990_617020
and you cut your way around . 617020_619030
sir, how far in do you go ? 619030_620100
only a little way in . 620100_635180
so it's quite a simple dissection .
just go all the way around .
yep . 635180_643970
it's not that bad . 643970_645990
ohh . 646140_647130
lovely . 647130_649950
so cut it in half totally, and you need to find the different areas . 649950_657000
okay, so there's there's a kidney cut in half .
let let me show you the different areas . 657000_658970
so, as you're doing the dissection, use the overhead to find help find the different parts . 658970_664940
okay, so in the centre here, what's the one in the centre called ? 664940_667990
fat . 667990_668910
what's the one in the centre called ? 668910_669100
fat . 669100_669900
not fat, no . 669900_670090
pelvis . 670090_671010
pelvis, thank you . 671010_673180
right, hand up for the next one, please .
um, magnia . 673180_674960
shh . 674960_675970
right, so there's the pelvis . 675970_676900
next one out is called the what, tony ?
I can't read . 676900_679040
medulla . 679040_680050
medulla, close enough . 680050_684110
medulla, right .
on the way out again .
okay, julia ?
cortex . 684110_685010
cortex, all right . 685010_690110
and what's the name of this tube coming out here ?
urethra . 690110_691000
um, yes, larry . 691000_693100
ureter . 693100_694100
ureter, right . 694100_697980
this is what you've got to do guys, three things .
first of all, you've got to find those parts, and you need to put a pin in the right spot . 697980_703090
so when you find the medulla, put a yellow pin there . 703090_706140
when you find the cortex put a blue pin there . 706140_714170
when you find the pelvis a red pin, and the ureter, a pink pin .
so, first of all you've got to put a pin in the right spot . 714170_717910
second thing, you've got to label this picture, you've got to label that picture . 717910_722060
third thing third and final thing you have to do is colour in the right spots . 722060_729040
so I've got some coloured pencils here .
you need to use the coloured pencils and colour in the kidney the same as your dissection . 729040_735060
right, now and the final instructions . 735060_742890
first of all, all kidneys are to stay in the trays .
second of all, there's only one piece of equipment per group . 742890_746050
so one pair of tweezers, one scalpel, one pair of scissors and one probe per group . 746050_751960
last instruction is that you are going to be marked on this . 751960_756180
so you need to leave your dissections in the trays at the end, and also fill out the sheet properly . 756180_763950
right, um, you can begin that now . 763950_769110
i'll come round and watch what you're doing .
yep . 769990_770080
xxx . 770080_771940
that's okay . 771940_793930
have fun .
you'll enjoy it .
why were you late to class ? 793930_795950
why were you late to class ?
because I had to return the football, and kyle and tony were still kicking it around . 795950_799040
and because tony put it in my name, I had to return it . 799040_801100
yeah, but you were almost ten minutes late . 801100_803160
yeah, bill was later than me and he didn't even have a note . 803160_807100
all right, i'll talk to you later, okay . 807100_825930
talk to you later .
al, what what was the first instruction ? 825930_828110
don't take 'em out of the tray . 828110_829140
right . 829140_829920
I had to rip it out, xxx . 829920_832900
sir, can I do it with rondah's group . 832900_834900
yes . 834900_835890
can rondah xxx . 835890_838030
yes, for today only . 838030_840130
what are we doing ? 840130_841140
I've got to rip this open and get the kidney . 841140_843920
I'm not ripping it open . 843920_845930
sir, why is it so hard ? 845930_846900
that's the fat . 846900_848020
xxx . 848020_849010
yes, where is she ? 849010_852120
yes .
I'm here . 852120_857040
is that right ? 857040_858890
yeah, that's right . 858890_865180
yep .
so what you can do while you're waiting is get some pencils and colour it in .
I haven't seen it yet .
what are we supposed to colour in ? 865180_866940
colour that colour it the same colour as that . 866940_870990
oh, okay . 870990_872020
colour that in the same colour as what you see . 872020_873080
gimme that pen . 873080_877930
sir, what is this xxx . 877930_880090
oh careful . 880090_884930
use tweezers when you're using a scalpel .
otherwise you cut cut right through .
cut your finger .
don't worry, I'm used to cutting my finger . 884930_888120
look at all the blood ! 888120_890000
yep . 890000_891010
will I cut apart these xxx ? 891010_892900
use the tweezers, here you are . 892900_893160
use those things . 894150_896090
you know what I'm talking about . 896090_899950
actual wires . 901040_904090
the tubes coming off . 904090_906980
wires . 906980_908080
keep going, you're doing well . 908080_912060
okay, you're doing it properly guys ? 912060_916970
being careful ?
not destroying the tube ?
harold, can you tell me why you were late for class today ? 916970_918130
I found it, eventually found it, and then I looked what class I had xxx, because I couldn't find what class I had without my diary . 926010_934050
what happened to your diary ? 934050_935970
who took your diary ?
oh it fell out it must have fallen out of my bag . 935970_942960
so this has got quite a bit of fat on it, hasn't it . 942960_946050
red in the pelvis . 946050_947000
so you found the ureter . 947000_948960
red in the pelvis . 948960_949930
we've found it have we . 949930_953160
yellow's, what yellow's medulla .
yeah, well done .
red in the pelvis . 953160_954010
yeah, red in the pelvis, that's right . 954010_956940
blue . 956940_959170
blue goes on there isn't it, sir ?
the cortex, yeah, is that the cortex . 959170_961000
yeah, the outside layer . 961000_962110
yeah, that's right . 962110_963010
good, that's it . 963010_965020
and the ureter . 965020_967990
the ureter .
xxx flip it out . 968020_969970
