Yeah But I 'll talk to you some time about the heating because I
Well er er the whole thing the the hall is is is a big worry
I did n't know that .
Michael said to me the first thing he said to me when I came here
So there 's no point in spending a lot of money on it .
No that 's what I say and and I 've written to the insurer to the

Well that 's well there 's no .
Cos it was sort of insured when we first took it over .
Yeah there 's no record of an insurance in the the file .
Oh I see .
And so I we have written to them and waiting for an answer .
Right .
So when we you see there 's no good putting anything in there erm
No .
Mind you when I said it 's got ta come down it might be five years
Yeah I mean there 's no point in re-roofing it for instance .
Oh no Not as as far as I know But we 'll see what they say .
Is the insurance through the diocese Father .
Well it 's it 's done it 's a di er no .
No .
it 's done privately but it 's the diocese have appointed the
I see .
We 're done through Peter .
Mhm .
he 's the insurance broker and it all works through Norwich Union .
Mhm .
Erm and he 's got some very good quotes for us .
Yes .
you do n't er insure a building according to its size now but
Mm .
I mean you might have a massive building .
And hardly anybody using it .
you 've got ta pay for it .
Yeah .
So it 's according to the number of people that use it go to mass
Mm .
erm on the insurance And it covers everything but as far as I know
Yeah I do n't know .
that that is not insured .
No well we do n't know we had thought that it was Especially after
No as far as .
it was all done up .
Mm .
Yes after it was sort of .
Well as far as well I know that Michael .
renovated .
Michael said to me the first thing he said to me that has to come
How funny he never ever said anything like that to us You 've not
told me .
That 's the first thing I know nothing about no well I know nothing

The scheme the youth scheme and er .
The .
youngsters .
Oh .

The work work something something scheme and and they they 'd
Well it looks alright to me .
they made it useful again .
But if I if I .
Usable .
if I had anything to do with it I would like those those gas fires
The trouble is there .
The trouble is there 's .
no mains gas .
there 's no gas .
into the hall .
No well .
That is why we did n't we would of liked to have had it but the
Oh well .
and the electric supply is limited to the heating that we 've got
0 .
This is amazing because in Cornwall they would put in the gas for
Well I mean you know I mean .
Cos we had it done in our hall .
they are now perhaps if you had a word with them .
We we we had it in our hall we they put it into the building for
Yeah .
and then you have to wire erm plumb it in or whatever they call it
Yes .
Yes that 's fair enough .
but they put it in to the meter in .
Well well th this was the problem it was gon na cost I do n't know
Well I had the one .
Presumably there 's no gas here is there .
There 's gas here .

Mhm mhm .
They have to sort out .

Oh this was seven years ago I suppose .
About seven years ago so .
two years ago when I was at we had the gas put into the hall .
