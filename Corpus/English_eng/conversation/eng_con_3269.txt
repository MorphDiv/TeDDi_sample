it's three x@l plus seven, right ? 49146_50788
yeah . 50788_51173
so when I put in let's let's just start with zero . 51173_53491
when I put in zero, what's three times zero ? 53491_55955
zero . 55955_56378
plus seven is ? 56378_57681
seven . 57681_58171
why did you put negative seven ? 58171_59793
what's zero plus seven ? 59793_61736
well I started oh . 61736_64501
Chris, let me take a look at your table for three . 64501_66065
how come you're not standing up to Raymond here and saying, hey man, look I got the right answers . 66065_72896
all right, your table is correct . 72896_76293
you've got to believe in yourself . 76293_77551
all right ? 77551_77886
I didn't know it was right . 77886_78846
you guys gotta start working better together and comparing answers . 78846_81038
all right ? 81038_82453
Ben, I'm worried about you man . 82453_84423
what are we doing here . 84423_85620

okay . 86886_87646
and Chris, you need to work with your normal partner here a little bit better . 87646_91013
and compare answers . 91013_95436
so I mean, if you would have compared answers, guys, you would have seen on this table here, right +... 95436_100950
that, hey ! 100950_102031
someone must be making a mistake because we're getting different answers here, right ? 102031_105341
mm hm . 105341_106206
so, either correct yours, or if you want, you can trust Chris . 106206_112010

all right . 113893_114406

yeah . 125043_125906
yeah . 125906_126283
so on these kind, I always told you just use, like, zero, one and two, right ? 126283_130104
you didn't have to go by multiples or anything because there's no fraction to divide by . 130104_134065
you see ? 134065_134920
all right guys, let's see what we can do here . 134920_138088

the thing is I I have to be honest . 154591_158373
I'm getting a little a little worried, maybe a little frustrated here, just because I could see that some of you have some serious weaknesses . 158373_166541
yet, you have people either across from you or right next to you, your own partner that seems most of the time . 166541_176020
have the right answers, yet you're not even asking them . 176020_178355
so, guys, I ask you, starting right now, is check your work with your partner's work . 178355_185005

let's focus on this . 271380_272691
we got done and we xxx like +/. 272691_274708
+, where's the paper at ? 274708_275276
right there . 275276_275493
all right, Ashley ? 275493_276773
yeah, um +... 276773_278251
okay, I don't get these two . 278251_281436
all right . 281436_283071
does anyone in this group +... 283071_284165
no . 284165_285576
understand what to do here ? 285576_286296
no . 286296_287180
because, like, there's different numbers . 287180_288230
which one would we use ? 288230_289035
okay . 289035_289260
all right . 289260_290358
okay . 290358_291413
now you want to use slope and y@l intercept or do you want to make tables ? 291413_295445
tables . 295445_296386
seems like tables are the way to go here, right ? 296386_298476
yeah . 298476_299483
so let's let's go there, all right ? 299483_301081
first of all, Ashley, that's a negative five thirds, isn't it ? 301081_304908
oh . 304908_305118
wait no the fastest +... 305118_306190
okay . 306190_307118
so now, if I plug in zero, guys Brandon, watch . 307118_311226
if I plug in zero, what's negative five thirds times zero ? 311226_315310
zero . 315310_316070
plus eight is ? 316070_317503
eight . 317503_318018
all right . 318018_318828
that was easy . 318828_320188
but I don't know what to use . 320188_321575
like threes ? 321575_322396
you would use threes . 322396_323675
try three and six . 323675_325371
okay ? 325371_326906
my stomach's hurting . 326906_328635
can I get a drink of water ? 328635_329915
sir, no . 329915_331195
you have to stay here . 331195_331940
all right ? 331940_332435
so all right, let's try three . 332435_335130
Nick, Jessie, you ready ? 335130_336626
two ten . 336626_337548
if I put in a three there, okay +... 337548_341668
it's going to be five, right ? 341668_343058
you're going to get negative five because the negative plus eight . 343058_346545
what's negative five plus eight ? 346545_347660
negative oh yeah . 347660_349226
positive three . 349226_350145
wait, xxx is negative two . 350145_351808
wait, is that how you do three ? 351808_352820
well you wrote it upside down . 352820_354298
that's okay . 354298_354858
and then the next one is going to be what ? 354858_357096
negative two . 357096_357658
it's going to be negative two . 357658_359481
you got it . 359481_360048
oh . 360048_360408
xxx two . 360408_361321

okay, you haven't done you did that in your head, huh ? 363311_364758
yeah . 364758_365136
impressive . 365136_365640
I always do my work <in my head> . 365640_366881
<okay> . 366881_367380
so don't let the negatives scare you . 367380_369740
just the same idea as the front . 369740_371410
just know that when you times, you've got to have a negative, right, in your problem . 371410_376370
that's all . 376370_378396
all right . 378396_379535
why do you keep getting out of your seat, Robert ? 379535_381668
well, I have to xxx . 381668_382951
I'm coming to +... 382951_383996
okay, I just kind of noticed out of the corner of my eye . 383996_385413
so what's going on here, how we doing ? 385413_387661
okay . 387661_388541
we're doing fine . 388541_390926
okay ? 390926_391996
so have I come by to check all ten equations yet ? 391996_396251
<no not yet, we're just we're on number ten> . 396251_397053
<not all ten> . 397053_397620
<just the first five> . 397620_398110
<we're on number ten> . 398110_398910
okay . 398910_399238
you are on number ten . 399238_400550
you want me to wait until you get number ten done ? 400550_402261
yeah . 402261_402776
yeah . 402776_402965
okay . 402965_403543
all right . 403543_404233
why did I get it wrong oh, I didn't write it . 404233_408656
ladies, you've been awful quiet over here . 408656_410040
what's going on ? 410040_410543
well, because we've been waiting for you ? 410543_411840
okay, all right . 411840_413686
for like a century . 413686_414200
so where are you stuck ? 414200_415856
or if you're not stuck, what would like me do you want me to just check your answers then ? 415856_419391
yeah . 419391_420253
is that what you're saying ? 420253_421415
yeah . 421415_421863
okay . 421863_423623
so , so I've already checked the first five ? 423623_428040
yes or no ? 428040_428463
no . 428463_428846
no . 428846_429181
oh, really ? 429181_430230
well, because you've been over there, you know +... 430230_432293
yeah, I know . 432293_432895
I've been pretty busy . 432895_434238
all right, let's start with six through ten . 434238_436126
well, we're only on eight . 436126_437460
so okay, so I'll do I'll do the first eight, how's that ? 437460_440750
first eight okay . 440750_442985
all right . 442985_443960
so I agree, that's plus twelve . 443960_445975
wait a minute, which one are we doing ? 445975_447556
number six . 447556_448123
that's plus eight, right ? 448123_449348
two, four, six, eight . 449348_450675
good . 450675_451028
now negative five thirds would mean you come down five and you go over three, right ? 451028_455275
so that one's perfect . 455275_457115
number seven . 457115_458131
you would have started at negative one and because of the negative four slope you would have gone down four and over one . 458131_465248
number three . 465248_466198
so that one is perfect . 466198_467015
and number eight ? 467015_468060
okay . 468060_468251
and number eight, I'm a little concerned . 468251_471410
see how it's slanting up ? 471410_472658
see, eight's a negative one third . 472658_475310
yeah, but that's a plus twelve . 475310_476963
so are you ready ? 476963_477728
well what does plus twelve mean ? 477728_479628
up here . 479628_480763
so erase number eight . 480763_485043
try number eight again . 485043_486873
okay ? 486873_487810
xxx . 487810_488530
okay . 488530_490288
all right, wait a minute Jessica all right, let me slow down, then . 490288_492185
because trust me, I'm sick and I'm also tired but we we can do this, all right . 492185_495896
you ready ? 495896_496496
zero, three, and six is right, though, right ? 496496_500656
zero was twelve . 500656_501863
so why did you plot down here, when zero positive twelve is up there . 501863_505438
oh, I made a mistake . 505438_508798
okay, let's look at the rest of your table . 508798_511048
I put a negative . 511048_512056
so three . 512056_513991
all right, if I put a three here, DeCarlos, what's one third of three ? 513991_519480
um, one . 519480_521301
one, right ? 521301_521756
so that negative makes it a negative one plus twelve, which was a positive so you had these points exactly right . 521756_526693
I check I put them backwards . 526693_527726
so you put them down you plotted wrong, basically, right ? 527726_530375
yeah . 530375_530885
all right . 530885_531458
Mister Ormsby ? 531458_532761
okay, all right . 532761_535193
yes ? 535193_535881
you're finally done, right ? 535881_537126
yes . 537126_537808
okay . 537808_538816
if you don't mind I'll just take a quick glance . 538816_542615
spot check a few of them because I'd like you to move on to the questions . 542615_545855
okay . 545855_546448
all right . 546448_546960
start answering the questions . 546960_547798
okay ? 547798_548185
and the ones I'm looking at right now, like for example, this one here this is number seven . 548185_553023
that looks good . 553023_553608
number six, five over three, that looks perfect . 553608_557711
okay . 557711_559518
oh, let me see . 559518_561150
you just finished ten, right ? 561150_562158
mm hm . 562158_562616
and that one's also perfect . 562616_564310
so I can safely say that you guys seem to know what you're doing . 564310_567483
