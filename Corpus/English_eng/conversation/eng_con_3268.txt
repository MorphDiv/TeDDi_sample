right ? 0_408
yeah . 408_760
so it's going to be well, what's three times a positive five ? 760_4576
fifteen . 4576_5078
divided by five is ? 5078_6896
three . 6896_7775
three minus ten . 7775_9608
seven . 9608_10496
negative seven . 10496_12111
don't forget the negative . 12111_12920
negative seven . 12920_13635
oh, all right . 13635_13878
okay ? 13878_14428
all right guys . 14428_16373
thanks for waiting so long . 16373_17435
okay . 17435_18015
all right, you want me to just check the answers ? 18015_19846
yeah . 19846_20190
now the only favor I need you to do, is because for each of these numbered equations, just number them . 20190_25618
for example, this is one, correct ? 25618_27701
yeah . 27701_28476
this one was equation three . 28476_29836
yeah . 29836_30346
this one was equation five . 30346_32101
so near the end of each of these arrows +... 32101_34035
yeah, put the number ? 34035_35651
just put put the number . 35651_36268
and then this one, let me just make sure, because I don't have them all memorized . 36268_41115
let's see, negative nine was one fourth . 41115_44185
you've got the slope perfect there and this one was three fifths, right ? 44185_47450
so everything looks perfect . 47450_48941
just number them and move on to the next five . 48941_51683
okay . 51683_52251
okay ? 52251_53155
Mister Ormsby ? 53155_54026
we're on number six . 54026_57843
I got it, guys . 57843_58468
I got it . 58468_58963
check our answers . 58963_59930
so here's all of number five . 59930_60763
look at that excellent work, man . 60763_62381
excellent work . 62381_63023
I crossed it out . 63023_64069
there's one, there's two, there's three, and there's four and there's five . 64069_67535
I figured it out . 67535_68231
excellent . 68231_68630
but it they're having problems on number +... 68630_70968
oh there it is . 70968_71383
I found it . 71383_71831
I found it . 71831_72255
I I now I xxx do . 72255_73476
okay . 73476_73846
you know what ? 73846_74926
as a matter of fact I think it's time for me to address the whole class . 74926_77676
okay . 77676_78713
everybody . 78713_79815
ladies and gentlemen, listen up . 79815_80895
five, four, three, two, one, zero . 80895_86141
now, about half of you are about ready to start the next set of five, right ? 86141_91676
starting on number six ? 91676_92931
yep, that's what we're doing . 92931_94008
we're starting xxx . 94008_94425
let me give you a hint . 94425_94920
just a little reminder, what you will notice +... 94920_97320
julie, you're doing a great job but please listen, okay ? 97320_101870
you'll notice on equations six through ten the slopes are negative . 101870_107413
yep, all xxx . 107413_108311
all right ? 108311_108798
so therefore, instead of rise over run meaning you'd go up and to the right, with the negative you're going to instead go, down and to the right . 108798_119355
okay ? 119355_119956
does that make sense to everybody ? 119956_122608
yeah . 122608_123243
so please keep going . 123243_124276
please make sure I check your first five and give you the okay to move on . 124276_127606
okay ? 127606_128696
could you check ours ? 128696_129543
all right . 129543_130168
yeah . 130168_130574
actually, I'm on four . 130574_131655
I'll check yours real quick . 131655_132368
okay . 132368_134591
all right, good . 134591_135400
you guys numbered them ? 135400_136318
yeah . 136318_136951
yeah . 136951_137415
okay . 137415_137823
there's one, slope . 137823_140373
equation three, two thirds . 140373_143808
equation five looks good . 143808_145073
I haven't even gotten to five . 145073_146981
I'm already +... 146981_147551
okay . 147551_148006
then you've got four and two . 148006_150240
it looks perfect so far . 150240_151320
okay . 151320_151760
move on to equation six then . 151760_153783
okay . 153783_154463
now you're saying you're being left behind here a little bit ? 154463_156758
on which one ? 156758_158485
well, they're obviously on five and +... 158485_162596
okay . 162596_163070
we're on +... 163070_163918
now Robert, here, I'm sure can help you . 163918_165406
you've got the one of the smartest kids in class right here . 165406_168580
he's tried to explain it once, but I'm not so sure . 168580_171245
okay . 171245_172108
it looks like you made a nice table here, though . 172108_173758
you understand what you did there ? 173758_175196
yeah . 175196_175635
okay . 175635_176413
so you when you put in zero, one fourth times zero is what ? 176413_180443
zero . 180443_180950
minus nine is ? 180950_182403
negative nine . 182403_183116
okay . 183116_183605
then you tried four, right ? 183605_186716
yeah . 186716_187253
all right . 187253_188111
why did you pick four and eight ? 188111_189485
why didn't you pick like one and two and three ? 189485_191595
numbers like that ? 191595_192541
because they're divisible by four . 192541_194916
well said . 194916_195901
good job . 195901_196778
so when I try four, see, what's one fourth times four ? 196778_200820
just one +... 200820_201843
yeah . 201843_203123
minus nine is a negative eight . 203123_204210
yeah . 204210_204828
and then you put an eight . 204828_206156
one fourth of eight is ? 206156_207373
two . 207373_208086
minus nine is negative seven . 208086_209925
so that's perfect . 209925_210596
if you plot those three points you get exactly what is on your graph there . 210596_214685
okay ? 214685_215861
can I see this really quick ? 215861_217095
Mister Ormsby ? 217095_218495
all right . 218495_219041
guys +... 219041_219665
are you sure this is right ? 219665_221741
because you're all +/. 221741_223013
oh, so you want me to just check six real quick, right ? 223013_225055
and five . 225055_225751
and five . 225751_226206
five, because that's the one we messed up on xxx . 226206_228911
right . 228911_229158
five now looks perfect . 229158_230175
no three . 230175_231336
three was +/. 231336_232008
oh, three was the one we messed up on . 232008_233518
so three is right here and the idea is that you want a positive three slope, which you did perfectly . 233518_240198
all right . 240198_240821
so three is good . 240821_242383
let's go back to six since we're here . 242383_245420
here's six, so you started at positive eight . 245420_248140
yeah . 248140_248796
the slope is negative five thirds so you went down five and over three, didn't you ? 248796_253316
yeah . 253316_253756
perfect . 253756_254581
all right . 254581_255826
okay ? 255826_256718
okay . 256718_259803
Ashley, how is Brandon doing here ? 259803_262336
<I'm helping him> . 262336_262983
<Brandon> ? 262983_263513
good . 263513_264283
that's what I want to see . 264283_265235
the rest we're done . 265235_267561
we just want you to check . 267561_268920
all right, you keep helping Brandon . 268920_270351
let me meet with Ashley over here . 270351_271511
Nick, if you want to watch you can . 271511_273000
okey dokey . 273000_273788
but I can tell you right now, five is good . 273788_276938
okay . 276938_277823
and you see the pattern in eight and ten ? 277823_279136
if I put how many do you add for ten ? 279136_279401
okay ? 279401_279848
let me start in order here . 279848_280561
one looks good . 280561_281256
hold it . 281256_282465
wait a minute . 282465_282865
let me check one again . 282865_284035
yeah, you've got to do twelve . 284035_285418
one, the slope is two thirds, isn't it ? 285418_287680
right ? 287680_289468
so first of all our y@l intercept is eight . 289468_293213
wait wait . 293213_293566
Ashley, let's look at yours since you're more comfortable with yours . 293566_295733
yeah . 295733_296230
you agree that zero, eight should be my first point, right ? 296230_298525
mm hm . 298525_298885
two, four, six, eight . 298885_301365
okay . 301365_302468
that's good . 302468_303150
hold on Brandon . 303150_303651
three +... 303651_304318
I made one over three . 304318_305655
one, two, three . 305655_306675
oh, here's your mistake . 306675_309516
yep, Jessie . 309516_310685
all right ? 310685_311116
now watch Ashley, you ready ? 311116_312781
when I put in three, two times the three would be six +... 312781_318835
six . 318835_319253
oh yeah . 319253_320150
divided by three would make ? 320150_321916
two . 321916_322476
two . 322476_324935
six divided by three is two, right ? 324935_326291
I know it's two . 326291_327676
okay, plus eight would make, ten . 327676_329610
so three would be ten; well what's two plus eight ? 329610_332268
ten . 332268_332723
so if that's a ten, this one I'm sure has got to be something bigger . 332723_338515
okay ? 338515_339871
eleven . 339871_340595
twelve ? 340595_340848
this may be twelve . 340848_341405
I believe it's twleve . 341405_341931
yeah, see I did it on here, but I did it wrong on my paper . 341931_344555
okay . 344555_345348
it's weird . 345348_345925
all right, so it sounds like you guys didn't compare your answers here but I think that's your only mistake . 345925_352335
because equation three looks very good . 352335_356611
all right . 356611_358363
you know what ? 358363_359301
equation two I don't necessarily like either . 359301_361435
is this supposed to be two ? 361435_363826
two says we're starting at what number ? 363826_367243
negative ten . 367243_368428
negative ten, right ? 368428_369155
you're not starting at negative ten here . 369155_371503
what's this number ? 371503_372176
two, four somehow you're starting at negative six . 372176_375101
so what happened on equation two, guys ? 375101_378951
hey, how come we didn't use your table ? 378951_383446
I don't know . 383446_384390
we were looking at his . 384390_385703
okay . 385703_387381
so if we start at ten, then +... 387381_389350
oh, I know look what you did wrong . 389350_390798
you copied the equation down wrong . 390798_392316
that's number four . 392316_393820
oh, I'm sorry . 393820_395796
you're right . 395796_396573
my mistake . 396573_397395
oh yeah, it does start at six . 397395_399396
I can't even read your writing . 399396_400526
yeah, why is that a six ? 400526_401563
that should be a negative ten, right ? 401563_402710
it looks like a six but it's ten . 402710_403861
okay . 403861_404595
and five you got negative seven . 404595_406668
yeah . 406668_407068
I agree with that . 407068_407563
yeah . 407563_408211
okay, and then ten you got negative four . 408211_411823
okay, so why don't you try replotting those three points and move on to equation six through ten and I'll check on number two later on . 411823_422781
okay, the rest of them look pretty good, though . 422781_424630
<all right> ? 424630_424798
<all right> . 424798_425223
Mister Ormsby, whoo hoo . 425223_426110
okay, what are we doing here, guys ? 426110_429325
hey, how come none of these lines are labeled ? 429325_431646
whoops . 431646_433140
now what I suggest you do +... 433140_435555
xxx two lines . 435555_435853
hold on . 435853_436135
what I suggest you do before I come back is for each of these just call it equation one, two, three, four, and five, right ? 436135_443596
put a number at the end of each of these lines . 443596_446935
oh, like number one, two, three +... 446935_450340
like for example, number one uh oh . 450340_453353
wait a minute . 453353_455503
I don't like what I see here . 455503_457881
look what you made me do . 457881_459185
you probably thought of it wrong . 459185_461168
okay . 461168_461618
let's see here . 461618_463503
number one, I believe this is supposed to be your number one here, right ? 463503_468758
I think so . 468758_469965
I don't know . 469965_470495
how come it's going down, guys ? 470495_471518
I don't know, it does it . 471518_472668
aren't all these slopes positive ? 472668_475086
so all of these should be going up . 475086_477846
how's it going down ? 477846_478781
look at it . 478781_480156
it's going down . 480156_481135
it's going up . 481135_482115
how do you read a book ? 482115_482601
how do you read a book, sir ? 482601_483971
left to right . 483971_484611
you read from left to right . 484611_485275
so let's start on the left side of the line . 485275_487401
yeah . 487401_487963
and as I move to the right I'm going in which direction ? 487963_491530
down . 491530_492411
right . 492411_492938
now if you look at all the other lines, see they're all positive . 492938_495651
but it's going up . 495651_496435
sir you have to read from left to right . 496435_499083
okay ? 499083_500203
all right . 500203_502381
it's going down like that . 502381_503628
so, guys, you need to make those corrections . 503628_505285
label the line . 505285_505956
correct this one, at least . 505956_507801
how come we've never done this before ? 507801_508683
okay ? 508683_509146
you made me do it xxx . 509146_510548
could you check our answers for xxx . 510548_512148
oh my gosh . 512148_512653
let me make sure I keep track of the time, too . 512653_514765
all right . 514765_515980
hey you guys did an awesome job here . 515980_519826
okay . 519826_521668
let's take a look here . 521668_523493
