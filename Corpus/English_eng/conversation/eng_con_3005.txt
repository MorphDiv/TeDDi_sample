yeah ‡ that's that's twenty eight times sixty . 368213_371634
really good . 371634_372865
are you kidding ? 372865_374089
negative thirty two . 374089_376056
okay ‡ so ‡ you need to know how +//. 376056_378145
+< well ‡ what ask them . 377509_378791
lead them . 378791_379316

oh ‡ yeah ‡ it is . 397872_399074
is sixty and negative twenty eight your answer ? 399074_402569

so ‡ I think you guys still got a bit . 415087_416761
0 . 416761_426780
okay . 426780_429282
ladies and gentlemen . 429282_432568
if can I go ahead and ask you to pause real quick ? 432568_435555
huh ? 435555_437229
if you haven't finished this I would like you to add this to your

0 . 453720_466572
hm . 466572_467217
so ‡ can you put this in the quadratic formula ? 467217_469678
(be)cause that's what I did . 469678_471720
yeah ‡ <did you> where's your quadratic equation ? 471720_474152
seven point five ! 474152_475771
isn't it like +/? 474871_475507
oh ‡ whoops . 475507_476582
okay ‡ I get it . 476582_478020
but where's the +..? 478020_478796
so ‡ it has to be x@l is on the other side ? 478796_481326
&+w yeah ‡ <for which> where is it at ? 481326_482888
was that it ? 482888_483346
oh ‡ okay ‡ yeah . 483346_484227
0 . 484227_487229
you have_to have like an x@l squared . 487229_489153
like a@l x@l squared plus b@l x@l plus c@l equals zero . 489153_493168
xxx divide by x@l and then +//. 493168_495559
no . 495559_496280
well ‡ what do you +/? 496280_496862
what +..? 496862_498840
&+w what would happen to y@l ? 498840_501089
you have this . 501089_502268
and you have this . 502268_503822
0 . 503822_510829
and +..? 510829_514097
so ‡ you had these two equations . 514097_515294
so ‡ what good did it do to get this y@l by itself ? 515294_517802
&=to:K Firstname you're a very smart person . 517802_519404
well ‡ I had_to figure out that <I like> forty eight plus x@l
+< right right . 525523_527191
so ‡ how do you show that you know that now ? 527191_529110
so ‡ you brought your y@l . 529110_529896
oh ‡ that's what you had right here . 529896_530964
y@l equals forty eight plus this thing . 530964_534181
+< the plus sign . 533096_533974
okay ‡ go ahead and write that . 534181_536237
so ‡ &+inste your variable instead of the x@l is gonna be y@l inside
so ‡ so ‡ I'm +... 541098_545214
so ‡ instead of keeping y@l and then a@l and everything +... 545214_548494
a@l would actually be eight . 548494_551078
+< well ‡ you don't have this . 550878_551893
you would reverse all this so you do get the +... 551893_554762
so ‡ <I would> I can just multiply everything by y@l ? 554762_557945
+< you would just get everything on one side . 555062_556836
yeah ‡ because you know how to get rid of this fraction „ right ? 557945_560120
mhm . 560120_560443
so ‡ go ahead and do that . 560443_561798
multiply both sides by y@l . 561798_563055
0 . 563055_567365
