that's enough, Miguel . 990170_996190
that's funny . 996190_1003230
let's get them back together, cases on . 1003230_1013280
bring them up front .
justin, would you collect all the compasses ? 1013280_1015270
please send the compasses to the front of the room so justin can pick those up . 1015270_1026100
don't just throw it, audrey . 1026100_1029010
audrey . 1029010_1033180
audrey .
i'll take it . 1033180_1037000
thanks .
huh ? 1037000_1042180
my name is justin . 1042180_1044230

timothy .
justin timothy .
oh . 1055120_1057060
this is your xxx class ?
uh, last year, yep . 1057060_1058120
so was muriel, huh ? 1058120_1059240
yep . 1059240_1064230
she was in my algebra class .
we gave stuff away in there, huh, muriel ? 1064230_1067180
last year's algebra class . 1067180_1069120
just like gave you stuff, remember ? 1069120_1070260
oh, yeah . 1070260_1072160
yeah . 1072160_1079200
she's looking at you in the picture .
like candy bars and sodas, remember ? 1079200_1081270
yep . 1082250_1085070
I need you guys to take out the lab sheet that we went over yesterday, please . 1085070_1106130
I remember somebody paid like three thousand dollars for a cup of soup or something like that, remember, in the secret bags . 1106130_1113060
remember the ones we rolled up and stapled shut . 1113060_1115190
that was funny .
I need one . 1115190_1116220
they're on the counter up here . 1116220_1124180
folks, get your labs .
find your spots, please .
what the xxx ? 1124180_1126150
carly, watch your mouth, please . 1126150_1128270
okay . 1128270_1130130
sorry .
you want to die there ? 1130130_1134100
xxx here ?
matt, find your seat . 1134100_1135200
liar . 1135200_1136030
and you're telling the teacher why ? 1140080_1145260
they go in the bag on my desk . 1147130_1153020
can you do that for me, please .
shh .
always in my face . 1153020_1154210
oh, my gosh . 1154210_1156100
okay, folks . 1156100_1158260
I need your attention up here, please .
I wasn't jamming it . 1158260_1167260
oh, my god .
xxx .
tom . 1167260_1170150
esther . 1170150_1176040
okay . 1176040_1181140
everyone should have the “pulley potpourri” sheet out in front of you; the lab sheet .
who thought of that name ? 1181140_1183090
I did . 1183090_1211000
it's my lab .
shh . 1211000_1218010
we're gonna get started on the lab today .
shh . 1218010_1223100
folks, I need your attention up here, please .
I'm glad you guys are having so much fun coloring inside the letters, but if I could get your attention up here, I would really appreciate it . 1223100_1234110
we went over this yesterday . 1234110_1243120
I'm just gonna recap it today because it's been twenty four hours, and I know you forgot .
you're just gathering three pieces of data from each pulley setup . 1243120_1248160
you're gathering the effort distance, the effort force and the resistance force . 1248160_1255190
when you lift the weight by ten centimeters . 1275240_1278180
the resistance distance in every case is ten centimeters . 1278180_1283110
just quickly go over this for the first setup again . 1288120_1291240
there are two rulers back at the station . 1291240_1299190
you'll be using both of them at the same time . 1299190_1302050
one person is gonna be measuring resistance distance; one person is gonna be measuring effort distance . 1302050_1308240
so you'll have one person using the centimeter side of the ruler . 1308240_1315120
there's an inches side .
don't use the inches; use the centimeters . 1315120_1322230
they're gonna be measuring how high the bottom of the weight goes up .
when it's at ten centimeters, that's as far as you're going . 1322230_1326000
is gonna be measuring how far they have moved the string to raise the weight ten centimeters . 1335130_1343220
now, some people in earlier classes were just writing down the numbers on here . 1343220_1349010
they would just be holding them here and go, “oh, that's fifty five” . 1349010_1352050
that's not how it works . 1352050_1356180
it's how far it moves .
so when the person is reading the resistance and they say, “oh, that's ten centimeters” on this thing, then you'll stop . 1356180_1363110
where did you start ? 1363110_1366220
where did you end ?
depending on how you turned, how far would that be ? 1371100_1374230
say, you started at fifty five, and you pulled the string down to sixty on the ruler . 1374230_1380150
how far would that be ?
five . 1380150_1381190
it would be five centimeters . 1381190_1387140
say, you started at fifty five, and it went to forty five .
how far would that be ?
ten centimeters . 1387140_1388100
it would be ten centimeters . 1388100_1394050
so it's how far you exert the force .
audrey . 1394050_1401170
it's the distance over which you apply the effort .
that's what effort distance is . 1401170_1403250
so if you start here and extend it that far, that's the effort distance . 1403250_1408150
a couple things to be aware of when you're doing your measurements . 1408150_1412060
so you want to make sure that you're pulling straight down in the direction that you are measuring . 1416060_1422010
secondly, you want to make sure that, uh, when you're measuring the force you're also pulling straight down . 1422010_1429230
straight down really helps on this lab . 1429230_1433150
all right .
so that's effort distance .
probably one of the harder things to measure in the lab . 1433150_1440000
we went over we went over resistance distance .
what is it for every experiment that we're doing ? 1440000_1442260
newtons . 1442260_1444180
that's force, as in newtons . 1444180_1450190
but what's the resistance distance ?
look on your lab .
it's already filled out .
ten centimeters . 1451100_1452120
it's ten centimeters . 1452120_1456180
so ten centimeters is how far we're lifting the weight up .
how far we pull this to lift the weight ten centimeters is our effort distance . 1456180_1460130
the forces I went over those yesterday . 1460130_1464070
got to zero these things .
the resistance force is just how much the resistance weighs, and as you guys just said a second ago, we are measuring it in what ? 1464070_1471130
newtons . 1471130_1472100
we are measuring it in newtons . 1472100_1476250
estimate to the closest quarter newton .
and you're gonna pull, and it works again much better if you pull upside down . 1484250_1489110
if you pull upside down I'm sorry . 1489110_1491210
not pull upside down .
pull straight down . 1491210_1496150
if you pull straight down, you'll get much more accurate measurements .
if you do it off to the side, it just, uh it's not gonna be as accurate, and again estimate to the closest quarter . 1496150_1501220
those are the only three things you're doing for each pulley setup . 1501220_1506060
there's four pulley setups .
you're not gonna get them all done today . 1506060_1512010
you might not even get the first one done today .
that's okay .
it's better that you get accurate data than that you just rush through all of these . 1512010_1517120
we got time .
we're gonna spend a number of days on this . 1517120_1520110
mechanical advantage, lastly . 1520110_1526090
but you gotta have to have good data so don't worry about mechanical advantage yet . 1526090_1530070
all right . 1530070_1535070
at this time I'm gonna divide you up into ten groups and send you to a station .
get started on well, you can do any of the pulley setups you want . 1535070_1538210
it doesn't matter whether you start with the first one or not, but let me sort of divide you guys up here . 1538210_1548290
that'll actually work out just, uh, fine . 1548290_1552160
cindy, I'm gonna go ahead and, uh, put you and matt with miguel, and you guys will be at the first station over there . 1552160_1559050
don't kill each other . 1559050_1566070
um, diane, you guys are gonna be here on the other side of this first station .
cassandra, you guys will be on this side of the first station . 1566070_1568250
carly, you guys will be across from matt's group . 1568250_1576250
audrey, you guys will be at this third station over here .
rupert ?
yes . 1576250_1577260
you guys will be just across from that . 1577260_1582110
sheila and eleanor, you guys will be where cindy is, working at that station . 1582110_1586200
and, josh and muriel, you'll be just across from that . 1586200_1590150
and let's see andrew and zeb, you guys will be at this station back here, and you guys will be at the very last station on the end . 1590150_1597030
okay . 1597030_1602120
let's head to our stations .
take your data table .
let's get them set up and get to work .
how much are these worth ? 1602120_1604020
is there anything over fifty ? 1609260_1612030
I don't know . 1612030_1615280
okay . 1618110_1619100
go ahead and put fifty on there . 1619100_1633230
there are knots in your string other than the one at the end . 1633230_1637170
you're gonna want to get those out . 1637170_1642030
they don't go over the pulley well .
are we right here ? 1642030_1643050
yep . 1643050_1644010
all right . 1644010_1652290
you guys are sort of working at different ends here, okay ? 1652290_1656260
like this ? 1656260_1657190
you probably want to put the loop through . 1657190_1661210
it doesn't it doesn't really matter .
oh . 1661210_1662010
but the loop hooks onto the weight . 1662010_1671030
it's just you have to pull a lot more string through if you put the better bring the string through first .
sure . 1673000_1674250
you can .
that's fine .
put that weight up . 1674250_1678110
you can ask me more, like, gently . 1678110_1680280
right here . 1680280_1681290
where's the weight ? 1681290_1685280
this hooks around it ?
yeah . 1685280_1687080
this hooks through .
it falls off . 1689280_1690020
you got to keep the string on the pulley though . 1690020_1692220
mr . 1692220_1693060
melville ?
yes ? 1693060_1697170
do you want us to do something with forty one the forty one part ? 1697170_1702290
I have no idea what you are talking about . 1702290_1705010
how do we do effort force ? 1705010_1707110
you tie a loop in the string and pull down when you're lifting the weight up . 1707110_1710280
okay . 1710280_1711060
and see what reading you get . 1711060_1712250
okay . 1712250_1714130
what do you want ? 1714130_1719030
how did you get effort distance on there, zeb ? 1719030_1722120
this side ? 1722120_1723000
you just yeah . 1723000_1728280
you need the difference .
so what's the difference between fifty seven and forty one ? 1728280_1733220
we need, uh where is the ruler ? 1733220_1735250
stop . 1736210_1737150
oh . 1737150_1739110
&~where ?
okay . 1742280_1743030
'cause that's what they said to us . 1743030_1744250
shall i measure it ? 1744250_1746000
she has to measure how far hers went while you're measuring that . 1746000_1754260
sheila, you're measuring how far your hand moved while she lifted that . 1758160_1765280
“oh, that's ten centimeters” then you look at how far you went . 1771260_1776190
all right . 1776190_1777130
okay ? 1777130_1778010
oh . 1778010_1779010
is that effort distance ?
so you start it's how far the effort string goes . 1779010_1782200
yeah, that's effort distance .
mr . 1782200_1783050
melville ?
yes ? 1783050_1784000
what is it if it is from fifty to the one right here ? 1784000_1788260
do we count one, two, three, or these little ones ?
well, the little ones are what ? 1788260_1794270
the big ones are centimeters .
what are the little ones ?
millimeters . 1794270_1795180
okay . 1795180_1800210
they are millimeters, or tenths of a centimeter .
so it would be it would be point something .
you are trying to measure accurately, yeah . 1800210_1813180
to the tenth would be fine .
you're gonna flip it . 1813180_1815000
I'm confused . 1815000_1817050
which one ? 1817050_1818170
all right . 1818170_1820190
put your hand up there somewhere .
what are we supposed to do ? 1820190_1823100
just pull up and be like +"/.
+" woo, look how far it went ?
yeah . 1823100_1825090
that's it .
you're supposed to actually measure some stuff along the way, and what would that be ? 1826000_1829270
then what do we do after that ? 1829270_1830000
wait up . 1830000_1832010
dude, just leave it this .
what's that ? 1832010_1833000
hold it, audrey . 1833000_1834200
all we do is pull it up ? 1834200_1836170
that's it ?
oh . 1836170_1838030
hold it . 1838030_1839000
and how far are you supposed to lift it ? 1839000_1840000
hold it . 1840000_1841080
ten centimeters . 1841080_1842060
okay . 1842060_1845280
so when that's being lifted ten centimeters, you want to know how far you had to pull this down .
that's what I'm saying . 1845280_1848110
hold it .
where do you start from ? 1849290_1850250
you need to measure . 1850250_1855290
you can start from anywhere you want because it matters where you go to .
sixty . 1855290_1856070
so I'd start at something even . 1856070_1857220
sixty . 1857220_1858230
but it has to be straight down, and you have to know where you started . 1858230_1863030
audrey .
audrey, it's gonna fall .
start at sixty . 1863030_1864110
all right . 1864110_1865150
hold it from up here .
but you got to hold it somewhere so that you can pull . 1865150_1868020
okay . 1868020_1870270
ready ?
oh, my god . 1870270_1872000
you're supposed to hold this right here .
you got to measure measure it while you do it, audrey . 1872000_1875160
you do it . 1875160_1876020
yes . 1877040_1878000
it's so frustrating working with a blonde . 1879010_1880020
don't worry about that yet . 1880020_1884170
we're gonna do that together once we got our data .
audrey, just measure while you pull down . 1884170_1886090
I don't understand it . 1886090_1887280
come here . 1887280_1888010
you have to write on this page, okay ? 1888010_1890270
just this page .
okay . 1890270_1891080
I wrote there . 1891080_1894220
audrey, let's say you started there, and by the time that thing was ten centimeters off the ground you were here . 1894220_1904230
how far did it move ?
how far did it move ? 1905220_1906050
i understand it . 1906050_1907270
I started at fifty, I went down to forty four . 1907270_1914090
how far did it move ?
or you can do it this way if you like that better .
yeah . 1914090_1915080
just take my pen .
started at fifty, and I went to sixty four . 1915080_1916230
i don't mind . 1916230_1917030
how far did it go ? 1917030_1918000
ask him . 1918000_1919000
ten . 1919000_1920000
twelve .
fifty to sixty four is ten ? 1920000_1921290
fourteen . 1921290_1922020
okay . 1922020_1926120
so it would have been fourteen centimeters, right ?
that's all you're doing .
but then where do you write it down ? 1926120_1927230
I know . 1927230_1928000
under “effort distance” . 1928000_1929280
okay . 1929280_1931190
we need your help .
but guys, I wasn't doing it for you . 1931190_1934990
it was just an example of how to read it .
&~okay ? 1935130_1936010
you can't write down fourteen . 1937020_1938260
when this is ten centimeters off the ground, you want to know how far this string was pulled to lift this ten centimeters off the ground . 1938260_1947010
that's what you're measuring . 1947010_1949000
mister m ? 1949000_1951030
Ian, go back to your spot . 1951030_1952080
we need to show you . 1952080_1953230
what ? 1953230_1954010
you can't show on the other side measuring xxx ? 1954010_1955010
mr . 1955010_1956150
melville, I don't get this .
how do you do effort force ? 1956150_1957260
tie a knot in the string . 1958130_1959290
okay . 1959290_1960080
pull it with the scale . 1960080_1963010
read the reading in newtons .
oh . 1963010_1964010
okay .
so thanks . 1964010_1966280
we need to pass this back ? 1966280_1968020
uh, yeah . 1968020_1977250
pass everything back .
that's cool .
thanks .
mr . 1977250_1978280
melville ?
what's that ? 1978280_1980030
xxx . 1980030_1981180
uh, I it's been it's been in there for a while . 1981180_1985260
I've already seen it so yeah .
take it right here ? 1985260_1986220
yes, ma'am . 1986220_1987090
he called me first . 1987090_1990140
like on this again because we were doing this on this and we hooked it up to here . 1990140_1993260
no . 1993260_1994140
we did this . 1995250_1998010
we did that .
you need three pieces of data . 1998010_2001250
weigh this thing .
that's resistance force .
off this ? 2001250_2002170
tie a loop here, pull it down with the scale . 2002170_2011290
that's effort force .
lastly, lift this ten centimeters off the ground by pulling here .
and measure how far you pull this to lift this ten centimeters off the ground . 2011290_2018250
this is the effort into my string so how far I pull it is gonna be what ? 2018250_2022010
ten centimeters, isn't it ? 2022010_2024190
same as the bottom .
well, that's what you are gonna find out . 2024190_2025230
oh . 2025230_2026000
okay .
but you're gonna find that for most of the pull setups it's not the same, okay ? 2026000_2030220
tie it up here ? 2030220_2032090
no yeah, for the force, yeah . 2032090_2035000
so we're doing a weight on it ? 2035000_2036080
yeah . 2036080_2037010
wait, wait, wait . 2037010_2040120
hold on .
hold on .
hold on .
okay . 2040120_2042030
which part are you guys stuck on here ?
I know . 2043100_2044000
resistance force wait . 2044000_2045090
okay . 2045090_2046010
that's where you just pick up pick up the weight .
four and a half pounds . 2046010_2047270
it's not pounds . 2047270_2049280
what is it measured in ?
newtons . 2049280_2050110
newtons . 2050110_2051120
four and a half newtons . 2051120_2055010
four and a half . 2055010_2056010
it's not four and a half . 2056010_2057280
it's halfway between four and six . 2057280_2060110
that's not four and a half .
oh . 2060110_2061010
five .
what are we measuring though on this ? 2061010_2063010
you're measuring three things . 2063010_2066260
vincent just did one of them .
okay . 2067050_2068150
you you you're sure you have it zeroed before you start it ?
I'd ask the same question to vincent, too . 2071200_2072270
zero ? 2072270_2073240
when it when it's not hooked up, is it at zero ? 2073240_2078140
no, it's not .
oh . 2078140_2079000
so you want to adjust it so that it is in fact on zero when you start . 2079000_2083000
okay . 2083000_2084140
so that's resistance force . 2084140_2089290
it's like newtons . 2089290_2090180
tie a loop . 2090180_2091010
I got four and a half . 2091010_2092040
pull it down . 2092040_2095250
read what the force is on the scale .
I don't get what you're saying, +"/.
+" set it to zero . 2095250_2099020
+" like, it can't move .
okay . 2099020_2102030
this thing goes up and down .
oh, I didn't see that . 2102030_2103000
put it so it's on zero . 2103000_2104250
yeah ?
how do we set it up for that one ? 2104250_2106210
okay . 2106210_2107000
you need to tie it up here . 2108010_2109010
yeah . 2109010_2110040
you need a pulley here . 2110040_2111240
uh+huh . 2111240_2112250
a weight here . 2112250_2114290
there's a loop of string up here .
okay . 2114290_2115250
that connects your pulley to your weight . 2115250_2117260
uh+huh . 2117260_2118030
the string from the bar goes through the pulley and up . 2118030_2120200
okay . 2120200_2121000
just like it looks in the picture . 2121000_2122230
do you have any tissues ? 2122230_2123280
uh, no, but I have paper towels over by diane there so I think the tissue box is all empty . 2123280_2133070
okay . 2133070_2135070
what do we do with this ?
that's how what you measure the forces with . 2135070_2138010
so it's this one and that one ? 2138010_2140210
it's you're gonna use it to measure resistance force and effort force . 2140210_2143050
now look, mr . 2143050_2144290
we got four and a half . 2144290_2146150
when I did that, I started out at fifty and I ended up with sixty so what would I write ? 2146150_2149080
okay . 2149080_2150290
so it would be how many centimeters ?
ten . 2150290_2151210
ten centimeters, yeah . 2151210_2152090
so where do I write that one ? 2152090_2156050
on effort distance ?
effort distance, yes . 2156050_2157230
wait, four newtons . 2157230_2159230
four newtons . 2159230_2162000
four and a half . 2162000_2163020
we put that on . 2163020_2164280
now, did you have it zeroed before you weighed it ? 2164280_2166250
yes . 2166250_2168200
okay . 2168200_2171170
it should be at zero, and you'll see that it's way above the zero .
oh . 2171170_2172110
you actually just slide this up and down to get it on zero . 2172110_2175270
oh . 2175270_2178280
okay .
you're gonna want to get the knots out of that when you're done, too . 2178280_2187280
it's not four and a half newtons . 2187280_2190160
look .
it's almost six .
it's four and a half . 2190160_2191100
it's almost six . 2191100_2192270
look .
watch .
you have to make sure it doesn't move . 2192270_2194080
watch . 2194080_2196090
that's far away . 2196090_2197180
you're supposed to stay with four .
isn't it almost six ? 2197180_2201040
that's probably way too far . 2201040_2203020
mr . 2204000_2205000
melville ?
yeah ? 2205000_2206000
which one is the effort force ? 2206000_2207020
how do you do the mechanical advantage ? 2207020_2208020
you want to take this off, but don't worry about that 'till later . 2208020_2212260
we're gonna do do it all together .
all right . 2212260_2213220
you want to take this off of here because yeah . 2213220_2219220
you need the knot out of that, too .
you you need this off the weight . 2219220_2222270
you instead of being looped around here, you need it looped around up here .
oh . 2222270_2223270
because it's supported from the top . 2223270_2225090
okay . 2225090_2229070
mechanical advantage . 2229070_2232130
how do we find the effort points ? 2232130_2235260
when your weight is on there, you need a loop here . 2235260_2240290
with the weight off the ground, hook the scale up, so that you can read on the scale . 2240290_2248000
okay ? 2248000_2249050
audrey, what you working on ? 2249050_2257230
audrey, what you working on ? 2257230_2259090
this . 2259090_2260250
did you help ian out with the lab setup ? 2260250_2262290
mr . 2262290_2263290
melville ?
yes ? 2263290_2264070
what do you write for here ? 2264070_2265000
the force distance and force ? 2265000_2267290
effort . 2267290_2268140
and effort force ? 2268140_2270210
okay . 2270210_2271120
and mechanical average ? 2271120_2272240
effort force . 2272240_2276040
don't worry about mechanical advantage yet .
you need to tie a loop here in your string . 2283210_2288230
you said not to tie anything . 2288230_2290240
no, I didn't . 2290240_2293090
I said, +"/.
+" make sure the knots are gone when you're done .
oh . 2293090_2294000
I specifically told you to tie a knot here because you're gonna hook this up to it and lift it off the ground and read the effort force . 2294000_2300010
that's effort force . 2300010_2308040
the effort distance is how far this moved in lifting this ten centimeters off the ground .
okay . 2308040_2309000
I got you .
so you are gonna have one person measuring that it's ten centimeters, the other person measuring how far their fingers moved when they did that . 2309000_2314280
this is for andrew . 2314280_2316090
thanks . 2316090_2317240
I told you . 2317240_2319120
you didn't tell me anything . 2319120_2320190
mister miss isaac sent him in . 2320190_2322170
miss who ? 2322170_2323150
miss isaac sent him in . 2323150_2325020
oh . 2325020_2330280
it's from miss isaac .
okay .
do I got two of them ? 2330280_2332290
no . 2332290_2333160
just one .
just andrew ? 2333160_2334120
yeah . 2334120_2335000
you got stuff to work on, dude ? 2335000_2336060
yeah . 2336060_2337000
okay . 2337000_2338010
come here .
richard, you're still xxx . 2338010_2341180
thanks . 2341180_2346060
you can work right there .
that'd be fine .
hopefully we'll never have to use this . 2346060_2348170
yes, except when subs are here . 2348170_2352140
this counts as a homework stamp, right ? 2352140_2355000
what's that ? 2355000_2356000
this counts as a homework stamp, right ? 2356000_2357250
I have no idea why that's on there . 2357250_2360260
what is that on there ?
yeah . 2360260_2361010
i wonder why .
is that the day you couldn't find a blank piece of paper and I stamped that on there for you ? 2361010_2365040
no . 2365040_2366110
okay, look at xxx . 2367090_2369010
let's do this .
okay, I'm gonna bring it up, and you measure ten centimeters off of the table . 2369010_2370000
i don't remember stamping it either . 2370000_2373220
I have no idea what that is .
mr . 2373220_2374220
melville ?
mr .
melville ?
yeah ? 2374220_2376010
andrew, you need to sit down . 2376010_2380000
you need to sit down .
wait . 2380000_2381290
that's ten inches, not centimeters . 2381290_2383030
you guys are seriously gonna want to get that knot out of there . 2383030_2384250
we need to go inches . 2384250_2385220
it really messes up the pulleys . 2385220_2388010
ten centimeters . 2388010_2389210
centimeters !
no . 2389210_2396100
no .
I said you need to tie a loop to measure effort force, but you don't want any knots in the string .
it messes up going through the pulley .
you have to have your finger right here . 2396100_2398060
let go .
you mean a loop like this, mr . 2398060_2400140
melville ?
what's that ? 2400140_2401030
like this ? 2401030_2402270
bridget ? 2402270_2405020
what are we weighing ?
a loop, that circle thing ? 2405020_2406200
I don't understand what you're saying . 2406200_2407290
never mind . 2407290_2411070
the only time you need a loop in there is when you're measuring the effort force . 2411070_2418290
other than that, the knot should be out of the string .
understand ? 2418290_2419240
okay . 2419240_2420010
yes ? 2420010_2421010
that's fine . 2422000_2426280
it has to be enough that you can well, it should be on the pulley for one .
is savannah here ? 2426280_2428000
savannah ? 2428000_2430110
I wasn't looking at that . 2430110_2431240
and then you have to pull down to make the weight go up . 2431240_2435240
no, no, no .
so like this ? 2439220_2440190
no . 2440190_2441180
you do it . 2441180_2442070
there . 2442070_2445280
there .
that's it .
now pull down on the scale .
on the scale ? 2445280_2446040
on the scale . 2446040_2451270
let go of the other string .
there you go .
that's it .
yes . 2453290_2455190
you're gonna be looking at it upside down .
I was, like, like four and a half . 2455190_2456180
there you go . 2457090_2460220
yeah .
now, untie it when you're done .
four and a half ? 2460220_2461100
so I go like this, right ? 2461100_2462260
where's my pen ? 2462260_2463040
yes . 2463040_2468240
but you want to do it straight down, because if you do it at an angle, it gives you a slightly different reading .
six newtons . 2468240_2471190
course . 2471190_2473070
six newtons . 2473070_2474260
six ? 2474260_2475280
yeah . 2475280_2477000
why do you tie that around ? 2477000_2480100
what do you need to do for this ? 2480100_2482170
you need to tie your string at the top, attach your weight directly to the pulley with this little loop of string that I put up here . 2482170_2491290
and then you need to run your string through the pulley and up, and you'll be lifting in an upward direction for that one . 2491290_2499080
you didn't see the pulley . 2499080_2502170
lift the rope .
yes, ma'am . 2502170_2503140
yes, ma'am ? 2503140_2504080
I said, +"/.
+" yes, ma'am . 2504080_2505260
oh . 2505260_2509050
I see .
I see .
wait .
no .
wait .
no .
no .
not that .
we already pushed that .
yes, ma'am ? 2509050_2510260
mr . 2510260_2511130
melville, my loop isn't very good .
xxx and it's thirty eighty centimeters . 2511130_2515210
where do you put it ?
I forgot .
what's thirty eight centimeters ? 2515210_2517180
the xxx . 2517180_2518140
this .
no . 2518140_2522160
no, no, no .
it's not it's how far you moved it .
yes, I did . 2522160_2523120
no . 2523120_2530270
it's how far you moved it in raising it ten centimeters .
so start somewhere even like fifty .
marcello ? 2530270_2538270
measure the weight .
measure the weight and tell me when it's ten centimeters off the ground .
how do you tie a knot ? 2538270_2539270
there . 2539270_2540050
right there ? 2540050_2541050
yeah . 2541050_2542010
okay . 2542010_2543140
I'm at sixty now .
where did I start ?
fifty . 2543140_2544010
I started at fifty so how far did I pull up ? 2544010_2545280
ten centimeters . 2545280_2546210
there you go . 2546210_2549290
that's what goes in this first spot .
the distance that you moved the effort string . 2549290_2551220
the effort distance ? 2551220_2552250
the effort distance, yeah . 2552250_2554280
yes ? 2554280_2555240
we did we already did this one . 2555240_2560240
how do we do this ?
you're gonna tie tie your string to the top . 2560240_2567200
actually, you can just loop it through, around .
it's gonna go down, through the pulley . 2567200_2574030
the pulley will be attached with this little loop directly to your weight .
no . 2574030_2575060
I don't get it . 2575060_2576060
can you show me again ?
no . 2576060_2580080
I look at the picture .
I want you to look at the picture and set it up like the picture .
you finished all four of them ? 2581260_2583290
or you finished the first and second ? 2584130_2586290
can I see your data ? 2586290_2592060
is it the last one, zeb ? 2592060_2596200
you guys were able to get the first and second ones done ? 2596200_2600290
who ? 2600290_2601240
us ?
it's us . 2601240_2602040
oh, it's you guys . 2602040_2604100
what did you do ? 2604100_2607070
look at this . 2607070_2609230
the effort force was sixteen newtons ? 2609230_2616280
sixteen . 2616280_2619180
oh, sixteen centimeters .
okay . 2619180_2621270
that would be effort distance .
oh . 2621270_2623040
okay, we can go on . 2623040_2624000
okay . 2624000_2631160
the resistance force, how did the weight get your weight was three newtons both times ?
which weight do you guys have ? 2631160_2633270
oh .
you guys have the brown one, right ?
yeah . 2633270_2634010
okay . 2634010_2635090
so that one's different .
okay, the one thing you didn't do then on on, uh, either of these setups is correctly figure out the effort force . 2635090_2644060
hook the scale up to it and pull . 2647060_2650010
we did it on this one, and we got twelve . 2650010_2651250
no, you didn't . 2651250_2657130
and does that say sixteen also ? 2657130_2661270
okay .
that one's not right either .
when you lift this off the ground by ten centimeters miguel, stop it . 2661270_2670270
when you lift it off the ground by ten centimeters, how far did this string move ? 2670270_2675280
that's what you need to measure .
oh . 2675280_2677030
okay .
okay ? 2677030_2680010
I don't think you did it right either place .
this is hard . 2680010_2684000
we need will in here .
he's a smart boy .
you took my stool . 2684000_2685270
when you get it set up again, call me over . 2685270_2688120
i'll show you .
all right . 2688120_2690290
yeah ? 2690290_2691190
can you help us with part two ? 2691190_2692290
yeah . 2692290_2693260
okay . 2693260_2695000
whatcha stuck on ?
we don't know how to do this thing . 2695000_2696260
okay . 2696260_2705270
well, look at it .
your string should be tied to the top bar .
do you see that in the picture ?
oh no, well look . 2709230_2712170
here, i'll give you one hint . 2712170_2720280
hand me the other end .
oh, it will slide through . 2720280_2721290
oh . 2721290_2728260
it's the same . 2728260_2733210
then you hook the pulley directly up to the weight like it shows, run the string through the pulley . 2733210_2738250
that little loop of string yeah . 2738250_2743250
that's how you do that part .
ian, you gonna do anything today ?
I already did one . 2744020_2746150
I did practically everything . 2746150_2749230
oh, thank you . 2749230_2750000
how do you do this part ? 2750000_2751010
can I actually look at it where I can see it . 2751010_2752290
how do you do mechanical advantage ? 2752290_2755180
we're gonna do that one together . 2755180_2757280
we got twenty five . 2757280_2758140
what was twenty five ? 2758140_2759230
that's what I told her . 2759230_2760230
where does it say twenty five ? 2760230_2762130
on twenty three or whatever that says . 2762130_2765000
what is that ?
that says twenty three . 2765000_2766220
so where did that come from ? 2766220_2767220
did you just make that up ?
you take twelve, six oh, wait . 2767220_2772280
I forgot to add ten, huh ?
okay .
it's it's thirty three .
why ? 2772280_2773280
because I added it all up . 2773280_2775290
why ? 2775290_2776150
watch out . 2776150_2777000
why not ? 2777000_2778170
why ? 2779280_2780270
I don't know . 2780270_2781150
it doesn't make any sense . 2781150_2782210
well, I don't know how else to do it . 2782210_2784180
that's why .
how do you do this part ? 2784180_2788170
you broke it . 2788170_2790210
no, I didn't . 2790210_2791020
that's your effort force . 2791020_2793280
you just pull that one down .
this ? 2793280_2794130
yep . 2794130_2795000
look it, mr . 2795000_2796000
melville .
we did it .
don, that's it . 2796000_2798260
perfect .
excellent job .
okay, folks . 2798260_2801270
it's time to clean up .
hurry up, hurry up, hurry up . 2806160_2808080
so everything hung back neatly where it belongs . 2808080_2812190
that was like this . 2812190_2813260
and, uh oh, can I have that xxx ? 2813260_2816280
after school . 2816280_2817040
mr . 2817040_2822120
you think someone can pick up our notebook ? 2822120_2824030
you're scaring me, rosalie . 2824030_2826230
uh, diane dropped her pencil down the drain . 2826230_2829260
you did ? 2829260_2833270
seriously ?
I have no way of getting it out .
no one must see that book . 2836290_2839270
nobody .
don't do it . 2842150_2844020
just to remember . 2844020_2845290
you come after school and you can have it .
okay . 2845290_2846290
yes ? 2846290_2847230
that looks perfect . 2850030_2851000
resistance from the lift, ten centimeters ? 2851000_2852060
yes . 2852060_2853020
but how do you calculate the effort force ? 2853020_2855070
tie a knot in the string . 2855070_2861170
hook the scale through it and pull .
read what you get on the scale .
oh . 2861170_2865270
okay .
and and we weigh we already weighed it .
it weighs five and a half newtons .
that's what that's the force the gravity is pulling downward with . 2865270_2868270
that's correct . 2869170_2870280
that's the resistance force .
no . 2872040_2874290
don't worry about that yet .
we're gonna do that together .
okay . 2874290_2877090
and it's the same thing here if we were to do it ?
exactly . 2877090_2881150
it's just a different pulley setup, but the calculations are the same .
oh . 2881150_2884040
okay .
I thought I told you guys that yesterday . 2884040_2886000
you said friday . 2886000_2887250
right . 2887250_2892240
tomorrow's friday .
that's cool .
folks, seriously, your stations need disassembled, cleaned up, put back the way they were . 2892240_2898250
I don't see a single station that's acceptable right now . 2898250_2902140
that one is . 2902140_2903000
look at ours . 2903000_2904000
ours . 2904000_2907110
you guys don't get to go until the station looks like it did when you got there . 2907110_2914120
are you serious ? 2914120_2915230
serious . 2915230_2916290
that's how it looked when I got there . 2916290_2917280
that looks good . 2917280_2918180
I know, huh . 2918180_2921010
everything neatly hung up on those corners like it was when you got there . 2921010_2926290
rulers lined up neatly on the table . 2926290_2938260
no knots in the string .
please get them cleaned up .
we couldn't get the pencil out of the drain . 2938260_2940150
no . 2940150_2948010
you won't probably be able to .
I'm sure there's probably many, many things down the drain .
you probably wouldn't want your pencil back after it'd been down the drain anyways . 2948010_2953090
it's kind of nasty .
does this go in the closet ? 2953090_2958130
would you get my pencil out ? 2958130_2959220
no . 2959220_2961250
I think it went all the way down the drain, because it's not in there no more, diane . 2961250_2966280
there's a there's a drain trap so it can't go past . 2966280_2970170
well, we could . 2973010_2984100
and you could rescal rescue her mangy old pencil . 2984100_2988080
you need it desperately ? 2988080_2989280
uh+huh . 2989280_2990080
yes ? 2990080_2993170
excuse me, mr . 2993170_2994070
melville ?
hey, folks . 2994070_3017090
let's stand up and get your chairs pushed under, please .
shh . 3017090_3019270
just push it under, but you don't get to go until anybody else goes . 3020290_3027110
okay, andrew ?
punch and munch tomorrow, not punch and munch and movie . 3027110_3032290
just punch and munch .
you do have a quiz tomorrow .
what can we bring again ? 3038070_3039260
anything except for gum, corn nuts, sunflower seeds and chips . 3039260_3043280
anything else is fair game .
all right . 3043280_3048230
I need miguel, matt, ian, and audrey .
they owe me two minutes .
the rest of you may go .
miguel, you owe me fifteen minutes at lunch, tomorrow . 3049220_3052180
expect to see you then . 3052180_3055190
