0 .
there yeah . 485473_487833
Yeah . 488703_488923
E two now you 've got to work out the average speed right try and
A hundred and twenty miles . 521603_523423
Right well say a nice you know just to the nearest to the nearest
A hundred . 527933_528263
Right . 528443_528683
and twenty seven miles . 528683_529273
A hundred and twenty seven what 's that to the nearest hour . 529273_534283
Two hours . 534283_535743
Right so if it goes say a hundred and twenty six miles or a hundred
Sixty . 550473_550663
Right sixty so that ca n't be right can it Right so how are you gon
Divide that by that . 565833_567213
Right but what are you gon na divide that by on a calculator . 567623_572303
Two point twelve . 572303_573903
No this is the whole thing is n't it Do n't you remember look if
Sixty . 592783_593113
Right now look it says there so what 's twelve minutes . 593223_600973
Nought point two . 600973_604063
Right so what are you gon na divide that by to get the average
Twelve point two . 608883_610133
No . 610133_610423
Nought point . 610673_614213
what 's the time . 614433_617683
Erm two hours and twelve minutes . 617683_621913
Right how do you write that as a decimal of an hour What 's two
Erm five . 642163_642693
No what twelve minutes is what fraction of an hour . 643763_651123
Oh nought point two . 651123_653613
Right so that equals the minutes is point two how many hours . 653613_662003
Two . 662003_662503
So two hours twelve minutes is two point two . 663623_672263
Two . 672263_672603
hours . 672603_673013
Yeah . 673953_674613
Right so to find the average speed what you gon na do . 674653_678233
Two hours divided by . 678233_679963
Right but and what that by . 680283_682173
That divide by that . 682173_683323
divide come on say again . 683523_685603
That . 685603_685853
That by by what . 686143_687543
Two point two . 687543_688863
Right . 689323_689633
Fifty eight . 689633_698703
That 's right right well what about the next one . 703973_720113
Does n't say . 720113_727743
Well how many minutes is it . 727983_729313
Nought point nine five . 729313_730433
0 .
nought point nine five . 731043_735363
Where does fifty eight come . 736333_738983
There . 738983_739283
Does it . 741003_742723
No . 742723_742853
Right there so what are you gon na divide it by . 745373_750083
Mm . 750123_750213
That 's nought point eight nought point nine nought point nine five
Six . 758803_759373
six and that 's half way to it so that 's nought point nine six
Five . 765073_765193
Look nought point nine six five and so you 're gon na divide . 765313_772203
Five . 772203_772823
you 're gon na divide fifty point five by . 773643_776453
Fifty two . 778593_784633
Right right now D . 784883_795553
Well that one point two . 795553_804533
That 's right . 804673_805233
forty two . 805233_815633
Right right now the next one . 815633_829973
Er how you gon na take it out of it Three at thirty nine . 829973_858903
0 .
thirty nine . 858903_859183
So what is it . 859473_860303
Two hours thirty nine minutes . 860443_861423
Right two hours thirty nine right . 861553_866983
Two point six five . 871423_882183
Right . 882213_882433
Seventy two . 883433_895143
Right . 895243_895413
