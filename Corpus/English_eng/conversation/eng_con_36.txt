the story is called twenty years after .
it's a story about two men, Bob and Jimmy_Wells .
who always meet .
and they were good friends growing up .
so one night a policeman .
it was after ten o'clock .
a policeman was going by checking the neighborhood .
he was checking all the doors and so forth .
and he came past this building where a man had an unlit unlit
and he was just standing there .
so right away the man told the policeman, he said +"/.
+" oh, it's okay officer .
+" it's okay .
+" I'm waiting for my friend who's the best guy in the world .
+" <we always> <we used to have> we used to eat here .
and the policeman said +"/.
+" tell me about your friend .
so he started talking about Jimmy_Wells .
with you_know this guy .
so the policeman left him .
and so the man waited .
and waited .
so then along came <this man with a>
and when he came back .
and Bob said +...
so they greeted .
and so Bob you_know knew that this was Jimmy .
and so they exchanged their greetings .
and then they started walking off .
and then Bob said +"/.
+" I never knew that you were this tall .
and so Jimmy said +"/.
+" yeah .
that <he grew> he gained a few inches you_know .
oh first, he asked Bob Jimmy how was he doing .
Jimmy said +"/.
+" things have been okay .
and Bob said you_know .
I think one of them said +"/.
+" not so good or something .
but anyway, so <as Bob> as they proceeded to go .
and have coffee .
and then Bob said +"/.
+" you are not Jimmy .
+" you're someone else .
and then he said +"/.
+" well Bob you_know .
and the man told him that he was under arrest .
and that he was taking him with him .
but he handed him a note .
<he handed> the note read that you_know +"/.
+" Bob I came by when you were lighting the cigar .
+" and and <I realized you_know that> I guess that he
+" and that I could not do it myself .
+" so I got the next &~plains plainclothes officer to do it .
and that was the end of the story .
I can talk about the time that <I remember that> I remember the
I was not a tomboy or tomgirl@n .
I always felt I was just a girl .
in fact, I was a girly girl .
but I was a girly girl who liked to hang around boys .
and I was the only girl in my neighborhood who had a bicycle .
and I remember it was almost dark .
and Jimmy Jimmy some people &~ca Jimmy .
his last name down in where I'm from is Hargert .
and a couple other guys and myself, we wanted to go to the store .
so it was almost dark .
and so I said +"/.
+" oh yeah, I can go too .
so I went to the store .
and so <when I> <we were driving on the> we had to go on
so <we were> all of us were driving .
and I was known for doing stunts .
and sitting <on the> on the you_know .
I could do the stuff that the guys did .
so I guess I was more like a unitype@n person .
that I could do you_know both .
you_know do things like you_know that the guys did like play
and and then play &~hop hopscotch at the same time you_know .
so I was like that .
so anyway, we went to the store .
and and I went without asking my mother .
and so when I got home, my mother was waiting for me with a switch
and I never forgot that .
and that was the only whipping that I remember getting .
and I remember that because it was a switch .
and it comes around my legs .
and it hurt .
and it was really hurting .
so that was my mother, Jimmy, and the other guys, and myself .
