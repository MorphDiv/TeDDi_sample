++ was Kelly's and this one is Amanda's . 0_3005
that will help us when we talk about each one . 3005_5288
now um did I hear somebody say that they think Amanda's core square
yeah . 11883_12440
it is . 12440_13115
it's not . 13115_13392
except it's just the opposite it's just flipped over . 13392_16848
flipped over ? 16848_17993
oh well we'll have to test that . 17993_20313
we'll have to test that . 20313_23340
I'm gonna make a core square that looks just like the
I am checking my chart to see if I can make one just like she
okay is this the core square Amanda told me about ? 35668_39513
yes . 39513_39735
+< Amanda is that what you told me about ? 39735_41627
yeah . 41627_41647
okay now if it's really the same as the one Dani told about I
who thinks they could do that ? 58158_59742
tell me what to do with Amanda's core square that would make it
Sarah what would you suggest I do ? 65893_67998
um turn it one fourth to the right . 67998_72150
turn it one fourth to the right . 72150_74345
does it look like the way Dani told us ? 74345_77270
yeah . 77270_77718
yes . 77718_78167
yeah okay let's see if someone was thinking of a different way to
remember Sarah said turn it one fourth to the right you'll have to
what could you do to Amanda's core square to prove it's the same as
Vanessa what could you do ? 98302_100170
um flip flip it um one once up . 100170_107717
flip it once up . 107717_109452
okay does it look like Dani's ? 109452_113778
yeah . 113778_114753
okay yes it does good job . 114753_118365
Sarah please stop . 118365_123590
he's trying to he's drawing in front of my desk . 123590_127470
she was too . 127470_128575
no I wasn't . 128575_129647
okay guys and ladies this is the core square Amanda described . 129647_135680
so far two different people have given us suggestions for how we
so far we've had turn right one quarter and flip up once . 147645_151753
who sees a different way ? 151753_153843
Asarebia ? 153843_155058
turn left one fourth . 155058_157772
turn left one fourth . 157772_159113
let's try it . 159113_160363
is that Dani's core square ? 160363_163720
yes . 163720_164458
yep so what did we find out about Dani's core square and Amanda's
they're the same . 168473_169587
they are the same . 169587_170817
they're the same . 170817_171765
Nathan you have a way we didn't um describe yet ? 171765_173490
+< yeah . 173490_174797
okay just a second I need to get it +//. 174797_176520
okay there's Amanda's . 176520_178548
take the bottom corner over on this side and flip it over here . 178548_185417
yeah that corner and then flip it over here then +/. 185417_189490
how would I do that ? 189490_190445
diagonal . 190445_191278
a diagonal flip ? 191278_192358
yeah . 192358_192885
like that ? 192885_194142
yeah and then turn it then turn it um um one fourth um to
did he make Dani's core square ? 205792_207848
yeah . 207848_208597
yeah . 208597_208880
so I think we let's see I lost track did we find four or five
+< four . 212922_213512
+< four . 213512_214043
+< four . 214043_215330
are we pretty convinced that they're the same ? 215330_217123
yeah . 217123_217442
I've got a different way . 217442_218698
you've got a different way Katie ? 218698_220135
share that before we see if we can find some other ways . 220135_222760
flip it to the left . 222760_224743
flip it to the left ? 224743_226993
that's Dani's way isn't it ? 226993_231577
good job . 231577_232340
I think we've proven that Amanda's way is the same as Dani's way . 232340_237137
now what I'm interested in though who thinks they have a core
so how many ways do we have so far ? 250040_252353
four . 252353_253930
five . 253930_254610
+< three . 254610_255015
+< three . 255015_255365
+< three . 255365_256110
one two three (be)cause this one was the same as this one and this
so far we've found three different ways that um the core square
Paul tell me about your idea for a different looking core square . 266427_276063
I'm gonna color in here whatever way you're thinking
top left blue . 281103_285822
top left blue . 285822_287222
okay . 287222_296142

green . 314497_320628
green . 320628_321290

hold on one second okay guys and ladies we need to take a brief
as soon as they shut the door +/. 347062_348473

what color should I make it right where my finger is . 360137_368647
blue or green ? 368647_370207

<a way that's not up there yet> a way that's not up there yet .
Kevin what are you thinking ? 409515_410540
two greens on the bottom . 410540_413010
okay just a second I have to uncap my green marker . 413010_416382
two greens on the bottom is this what you mean ? 416382_419613
these two there would be green ? 419613_422213

if it's really the same as Brian's core square someone can tell me
<who thinks they could do that> who thinks they could do that ?
tell me what to do to Kevin's idea for a core square that would
Asarebia what should I do ? 526468_528092
