so anyway basically I have a really good time giving a tour .
if you do not want to be here I don't want you to be here and the reason is because I don't want you to cramp my style I don't want you to cramp anybody else that wants to actually be here so if you don't want to be here that's fine . 36515_37155

xxx is a phat dorm . 402185_406125
<is it> ?

yeah well it's not like that anymore they changed it .
&-um so if you got +//.
and you got a pretty good pick .
rooms are a decent size and it's just really cool to look at .
&=laughs right off of Palmer Field it's not too far to walk (0.18) okay now this is the first big stop on our tour .
anybody tell me what building that is right there ?
School of Business Administration .
well there you go .
&=laughs:multiple .
everybody at the same time couldn't figure out who it was that is the School of Business Administration who's interested in going to the School of Business ? 420485_421625
me .
good luck .
it is tough .
kickass .
&=laughs:SU totally kickass (be)cause that's pretty much the only way you're gonna get in no I'm just kidding I'd a bunch of friends that got in but they totally kicked ass as undergrads and they got really really involved while they were here . 421845_422565
so if you're interested in going to the School of Business Administration it's number one so totally totally kick butt at academics . 437085_437365
&=laughs .
it's a squirrel .
they're rugged around here I'm not kidding they'll kick your butts .
if you look through here through these little trees over there you will see two big nice Greek pillars . 437365_444145
those Greek pillars were imported by the School of Architecture Dean .
he thought it was so cool and he was so rich that he decided to import those two pillars himself so that the School of Architecture students which was housed in Lorch Hall which is behind &-uh those two pillars +... 473985_474045
he thought he would bring (th)em in so that they could see what Greek architecture's really like and how you know +//.

⌈ I'll ⌉ tell you I'll tell you in a little bit .
xxx Law Library xxx .
yeah .
okay so this is the second part of the tour and one of the first parts of the off+campus tour . 629665_629765
everybody's gonna look over here where the two older guys are looking at you ? 629765_630065
that is Dominick's . 630605_630645
Dominick's is the largest hub of underage drinking ever to be imagined on University of Michigan campus . 630645_630765
basically what happens there is that you get into a line somebody with an ID goes up there orders big pitcher of sangria everybody's maybe familiar with sangria maybe not probably shouldn't be anyway everybody knows what sangria is you go up to sangria guy I want a pitcher of sangria . 652865_655045
so he hands you one glass and a pitcher of sangria .
now is one person really gonna drink an entire pitcher of sangria ? 655125_655405
no .
so that's why that person brings the entire pitcher and one glass back to the table where there's twelve friends who all can't get in and shouldn't be there in the first place are all gonna suck down this big pitcher of sangria . 655405_655825
if you want more ID +//.
you +//.
you want more glasses you're supposed to have more IDs .
but I've seen people drink straight out_of the pitcher and I don't understand what the mentality is because honest to God like if you +//.
one person is gonna drink an entire pitcher of sangria now sangria's pretty dilute . 679645_688085
but if you're gonna drink an entire pitcher of sangria I'm sorry you're not walking out_of the joint so I don't understand &=laughs how they can just let you get away with that . 688165_688625
but anyway .
Dominick's big hub of underage drinking on campus and I'm not condoning this of_course I'm not condoning this I'm not &~con +/. 688625_688725
+, yeah is that right ?
that's right .
I'm not condoning this .
don't go to Dominick's and drink underagedly . 718165_718185
&=laughs:multiple darn it that's the official University of Michigan position .
just kidding .
don't do it .
it's bad for you .
alright what building is this behind me right here ?
Law Library .
Law Library .
who all said Law Library ?
right there Alex +/.

+, &=laughs:SUm oh Mike <here> Mike Mike Mike ⌊ oh there you go +//.

⌈ we ⌉ don't have access to it do we ?

well you are really bitter aren't you .
&=laughs .
you're really bitter . 721285_722325
xxx good try (0.4) .
xxx .
I've always wanted to go down there . 722625_723605
that is incorrect . 723625_727765
that is incorrect that's ⌊ what <he told me> ⌋ +/. 727765_736345
⌈ that is incorrect ⌉ +/.
+, told us last time .
I don't xxx .
they lied .
why can't we go down there ?
alright so here's the story about this building as &~s so many people are so impatient to hear about . 738425_746845
this building is the Law Library . 774265_774285
it was built in the mid eighteen hundreds by a name by a name .
by a man by the name of William Cook .
William Cook was an incredibly rich law professor that went to the University of Michigan and taught here . 774285_774385
and he decided +"/.
+" hey let's just donate about oh I don't know about twenty million dollars that I had back in the mid eighteen hundreds which is a fat check still now but was a &~fat even fatter check back then to the University of Michigan to build this law school . 777485_807465
he wanted to build it after the Stanford +//. 807765_837745
&-er this the +//.
the Yales the Harvards you know the really nice Ivy League posh places right and you can see I mean it must've cost a_lot (be)cause all those things are hand carved up there you get the shield right there the crest and you got all these little pillars that are hand carved blah blah blah and he said two things have to happen before I +... 841305_845765
are gonna +//.
am gonna give you all this money .
one the whole building the whole thing's gotta be done by the time I die . 868265_869625
secondly if you're gonna add on to any part of this then you have to guarantee that it hasta be done in the same style with the same brick . 869665_870245
as it was done now .
so they're like okay .
well that's cool .
so they worked their butts off to get it done before he died and he was really old but unfortunately he died just before they finished it . 870245_870365
sucks really bad about two years boom he's dead .
they hadn't finished it yet .
and the second thing is when the University of Michigan decided to add &~t on to it in the nineteen sixties they didn't have enough money to add on to it because the price of brick went from about six dollars a brick to sixty dollars a brick so they couldn't afford to do it . 886525_894965
so what'd they do ?
dug a big hole in the ground didn't use any bricks and went underground .
this is what you're leaning over right now .
into the Law Library which is down and to your left you can see xxx but that's basically what it is . 909825_916705
you cannot get &~i get down there unless you are a law student you can go down the stairs and you can stand there and they'll swipe your card and if it doesn't say you're a law student &=sound_effect denied you have to go home . 916705_917645
but you can sneak into the Law Library if the person doesn't happen to be there which I definitely recommend to all undergrads while you're here .
also another thing is you get up into the Law School and you climb up on those balconies like that where those other windows are .
course that's also not an official university position that I'm taking but it's fun as hell . 917645_917705
do this &=laughs especially really late at night so definitely take advantage of sneaking into the Library they've got really neat &-uh classrooms in there that are actually mock courtrooms .
so it looks looks just like LA Law you guys remember LA Law ?
xxx pretty cool in there so I mean computers and stuff it's fresh as hell ⌊ so ⌋ .
⌈ have ⌉ you ever been caught ?
oh yeah .
oh yeah .
&=laughs:SUm are you a law student ?
yes .
&=laughs:multiple I mean I look like I'm sixteen but ah sure I'm a law student can I see your ID no that's fine I'm xxx so anyway so another little thing is everybody always says oh is this an aquarium ? 917705_917905
is this +//.
do they let you swim here I hear they let you swim here . 917905_918845
water not very high they build it to about these little porthole you see those little portholes there with the little screens over (th)em . 918845_919605
is that another group over there ?
what's that ?
where ?
Aaron don't play me .
⌊ yes ⌋ .
⌈ yes ⌉ .
we'll go get (th)em in a minute .
&=laughs:multiple thank you very much <that and that > eyes and ears .
that's what I'm talking about right there &=bumps_into_someone whoops hello eyes and ears . 945375_947835
anyway as I was saying they do fill it up to about those portholes that's where the water comes in and they put fish in it so everybody's like yeah right okay why isn't there fish in there now ? 947835_947935
why don't you think there's fish in there now because we import the fish from Florida and because of El Nino and all the other crap they're dead .
they died this year we couldn't get (th)em .
so there you go that's why there's no water and no fish in the bottom down there .
any questions before we go ?
xxx .
alright .
we will go to a restroom right now . 952335_952495
okay (be)cause I've gotta +//. 952595_960015
I'll catch up xxx .
⌊ &-uh oh ⌋ . 960475_966635
⌈ it hasta be in a group right ⌉ ? 966635_970775
&-uh oh alright okay .
alright this is Eric +//.
this is Eric's group .
Eric really gets made fun of a_lot because he has chicken legs .
everybody's listening in the back right ? 970775_973635
Eric gets made fun of a_lot because he has chicken legs right ? 974135_975975
and so what we're gonna do is as we walk around the corner I'm gonna go +"/.
+" one two three .
and on three we're all gonna scream chicken legs okay ?
if you don't back me up in this I'm gonna look really stupid and I'm gonna make sure you look stupid by the end of the time so please back me up on this . 1007925_1010305
this is crucial .
alright you guys ready ?
he might scream one two three .
chicken legs .
woo .
ow +/.

he's got a bigger gun though . 1013365_1024685
pretty big .
yeah but he doesn't know how to use it . 1024685_1033665
in this case size certainly does not matter . 1033665_1037625
(0.5) .
stubby &=laughs:multiple .
stubby ?
(0.6) but you'll notice that his group sucks pretty much because what +//.
I mean what &~i what has he got like seven eight more people than we do and stubby &=laughs:multiple . 1037645_1041865
eh alright anyway so we're standing on the steps of the Reading Room of the Law Library one of my fave rooms on campus .
this is gonna be the cheesiest thing you're gonna hear on the entire tour but is actually one of the reasons why I decided to come here to the University of Michigan . 1063185_1068705
came on a tour was like alright <well it's> not bad <no it's> not bad came in here and whoa . 1092315_1094815
absolutely loved this building it's one of my favorite ran the Naked Mile through this building totally fresh xxx jumping on the table absolutely live . 1108305_1116505
if you go to the Naked Mile which you all should go to the Naked Mile . 1126345_1126465

run if you want to it's a great time if you do do it sober I did it was fun but come in here and hang out here ten minutes before the whole thing starts it is so live .

but anyway pretty cool place to live we were actually ah playing whiffleball out here about twelve thirty at night they were all pissed off because they had class at eight o'clock in the morning and so they asked us to go find &~annif another field for the whiffleball (be)cause we were playing whiffleball right here it was pretty cool . 1537035_1539775

another neat thing is that the guys that live in the top of that tower right there I think they have to sign something in their contract which says will throw the coolest parties ever . 1539775_1539995
because if you go by there any time during the weekend <you you're gonna hear this> &=sound_effect wheehoo@o people are hanging off the balcony . 1539995_1541355

&=sound_effect alright anyway moving on.
the president held a frat party there this year completely and totally unintentionally after we won the national championships in hockey .
whole bunch of people knocked on his door kicking on his door he happened to be home .
when you've got four thousand people standing in your lawn you should probably answer the door he answered the door everybody piled on in and started having this little party he hosted &-uh didn't really have any choice but he hosted the +//. 1600915_1603035
pretty much the coolest party that happened here at the University of Michigan last year . 1625215_1627755
&-uh had four cleaning trucks come in and actually take over the whole place for the whole next day really really cool . 1627775_1631835
something not so cool was that there was a really drunk guy up there that day too and climbed all the way to the top of the tree . 1652265_1652825
that's right in this front yard fell from the top of the tree all the way to the ground . 1652825_1652945

and he's walking well now . 1678885_1680145
he was a student here that just got way way way too drunk . 1680265_1680545
so don't climb trees when you're drunk basically is the moral of that story .
another neat thing is that the president has a big heated sidewalk in front of his place so that he doesn't trip on his way to work and fall on the ice . 1680545_1680645
isn't that nice ?

the bars closed . 1793605_1793685
&=laughs the bars closed and he wanted all the drunk dudes to come down that's the best theory I've heard all +//.
yet but they're all incorrect .
he actually wanted to thwart an assassination attempt somebody got tipped that there's gonna be an assassination attempt and so he was like hey let's just throw the whole thing and have it at two o'clock in the morning so he did . 1819985_1820285

well not a neat thing a kind_of a stinky thing was that it was originally built only for men when it was first built . 1869915_1875535
&-um as you can see the two ideal Michigan men +//.
male students are exemplified by the two statues that you can barely see underneath the ivy the one on the left is the athlete and the one on the right is the scholar curious that the scholar's completely covered and that the athlete is not hm . 1889495_1890295
anyway what happens at the Michigan Union in the bottom basement of the Michigan Union there's the MUG the Michigan Union Grill great place to hang out especially when Michigan's playing games and stuff like that &-um major games . 1930615_1930735
everybody's piling in there eating food that's down there there's a_lot_of fast food down there also the Michigan Union Bookstore is down there Mail Boxes Etc there's a travel agent . 1930735_1931095
the computer showcase that you're gonna talk about tomorrow that's down there on the second floor .
there is a billiards room pretty cool to hang out there until two o'clock in the morning shoot some pool . 1931095_1933015
and there are a_lot_of secret societies that have their meetings up there and a_lot_of other organizations and groups and major university administrative type people that hold their offices there as well .
we're not gonna go in the building because most of you've probably been in there if you haven't I definitely suggest that you go in it but for the sake of time and to make sure that we do get to go off campus we're not gonna go in it I'm sorry . 1971315_1974995
any questions ?
come on you guys +...
alright &=starts_walking okay so since you guys are my pace cars now (be)cause you were in back and now you're in front we gotta kick up the pace . 2036165_2036245

alright (0.54) hey what building is this ?
Literature Science and Art Building .
oh I can't give credit for that I'm sorry +... 2036685_2036725
anybody know why it's orange ?
⌈ (be)cause ⌉ .
⌊ because they ran out_of ⌋ money for bricks that matched the other bricks . 2036725_2037325
⌈ (be)cause ⌉ .
⌊ is that right ⌋ ?
what is with this guy ?
&=laughs:SUm .
what ?
what is with this guy ?
the Ann Arbor lady didn't even get that one .
get what ?
huh ?
why is this orange ? 2059985_2064565
&=laughs it is orange for the exact reason that Nasr just said .
it is orange because when the University of Michigan decided to build it they couldn't afford the brick because the brick was a_lot more expensive the red brick that is because it was being used in the war effort . 2064705_2066605
so they jacked up the price so that no one would buy it so they could use all the red brick so they decided hey instead of waiting until after the war is over (be)cause who knows how the hell long this is gonna last we'll just go and build the ugliest building on campus . 2075395_2077435
so there you have the Literature Science and the Arts Building . 2088325_2089305
that's +//.

less than that probably .
the only thing that's really in there of of any worth of anything at all in my opinion is the Cashier's Office . 2122035_2123835
and I'd really just as soon not go there anyway because I've always gotta pay my phone bills there because they always send me these notices that say yeah you owe us thirty six dollars and if you don't pay it yet you'll shut +//. 2140585_2140825
we'll shut off your service .
that's happened about six times or so but they give you about ten notices ahead of time so it's kinda cool they +//.
you know they lead up to it +... 2140865_2140885
the Registrar used to be there so +//.
but they moved so pretty much the only thing worth anything is the Cashier's Office .
xxx <hand me a> Starburst candy .
ah Jesus mystery chew .
that was +//.
it's pink .
Nasr unhunh .
mystery chew .
<how come you> xxx the Starburst ?
it's for the brick .
I didn't . 2140885_2140905
he got it for the brick and he got the mystery chew (be)cause he's been bitching at me about the fact that he only gets the pink ones . 2140905_2140965
&=laughs I only got the pink ones .
I like the pink ones .
well you can have all his pink ones then .

this white area right in front with the windows is gorgeous . 2142845_2142965
there's a baby grand piano in there absolutely incredible plush very nice carpeting etcetera etcetera etcetera but I have to tell you +... 2160405_2168145

xxx .
yeah and they're &-uh +//.
they're really rough .
&=laughs the professors here at least what I've heard the unofficial position is ah the the professors can be really rough sometimes .

&=crosses_street okay <we do> we do have to give &~some it's alright it's yellow it's fine .
do you have to watch the green sign ? 2194985_2195345
oh if it was green I would have to watch out if it was green okay so this is the next stop on our tour now I'm gonna try to make this as inconspicuous as possible (be)cause hey we're off campus now . 2195345_2196065
so I'm not gonna try to embarrass you guys in front of a bunch of people you don't know and everybody's like oh great it's a tour . 2215925_2216125
I love these tours .
blocking up the streets blah blah blah shut up I gotta go .

Domino's .
<Domino's Pizza> Domino's Pizza's the coolest place at four o'clock in the morning because it's cheap and it's open at four o'clock in the morning it's one of the only places that's gonna be open at four o'clock in the morning for your dining needs . 2257475_2259375
why would you need to dine at four o'clock in the morning (be)cause you were at a party until two thirty you're completely wasted and you come back here and you eat some food . 2281365_2281505
now I still eat here at four o'clock in the morning I'm not much of a drinking guy but I come here four o'clock in the morning anyway just kinda to see what's up with +//. 2300205_2300345
what's up at four o'clock in the morning the line is stretched out the door everybody's hanging out here all kinds of people really fun place to hang out .
&-um another neat thing the reason why I actually +//.
that I came here to the University of Michigan is because we just walked across the street from that way and if we would've come from that way or even come from that way we went from campus to off campus in a matter of oh I don't know thirty feet . 2327675_2327815
that is pretty damn cool you can't get that anywhere else .
you cannot get that anywhere else you go to Michigan State there's campus and way the hell over here is off campus you go to any other school it doesn't work this way it sort of just melds and kind of flows and it's just pretty damn cool . 2352885_2353025
so yeah +...
and it's neat (be)cause you can go out to a club or to a +... 2375525_2375845
social event other than a club and get home in like five minutes (be)cause your dorm's right across the street from that place like Dominick's or something . 2375845_2375925

so she's gonna go from the M to the library . 3360615_3361035
&=laughs:SUm .
so alright anyway .
so okay there's a_lot_of different things to talk about in this area .
introduce you to a few buildings on campus so I don't +//.
I give you the full tour . 3361035_3361115
over here is the Randall Laboratory Physics Building this red one right here if you can +//. 3384025_3389865
you can barely sorta see it over here is the middle white part in the middle now why is this building cool ? 3390485_3392245
well physics is held there and physics is cool .
no actually physics sucks I hate physics it's probably one of the worst subjects that's ever been taught here ever &-um that's just my personal opinion but &-um anyway the cool &~b part about this building is that middle part is all completely free standing and it's on its own base . 3413245_3413285
it's on its own base .
why is it on its own base it's so it's they can do seismic studies .
they have these little generators in the inside that can shake that part of the building so they can do earthquake stuff . 3413285_3413305
pretty damn cool okay .
the rest of the building isn't like that but the middle part it's all labs up in there and it shakes freely on its own base . 3413325_3413365
whoa .
moving on to the left coming over here to the brick building over there is the School of Natural Resources and the Environment anybody involved in that ? 3413365_3415385
really cool program here at the University of Michigan lot o(f) people call (th)em tree huggers I do too but I got a_lot_of friends who are in (th)em +//.
in it so I can do that . 3416185_3433165
really really really neat if you're going into biology another neat thing to do is to go to the Biological Station up towards the UP . 3433165_3441425
really really cool thing to do I did it I studied insects and &-uh ecology .
the insects was a little off .
but it was pretty cool too (be)cause I got the really phat Belostomatid .
it's really really neat .
it's kinda &=sound_effect crawling around .
it was huge .
killed it big thing &=sound_effect .
it was really fun .
talk about that later too .
Chemistry Building's right next to that if you're interested in chemistry or even if you're not that's the Chemistry Building . 3470975_3471555
one of the biggest lecture halls in the world is in that building right there actually just in the United States .
&-uh holds about six hundred people .
but they can't even put six hundred people in there because it's not built &-um right .
the NEA the National Education Association or somebody else said +"/.
+" sorry you can't fill it to capacity because it's kinda like it's kinda drawn &=drawing like you got the chalkboard here right and you got all the seats that go like this right . 3471555_3473315
+" and the problem is you can't put anybody here or here up in this area sorry or up in this area because they can't see the board right . 3473315_3473475
so they actually can only put people in this middle area so they can only fill it enough so that people can sit in the middle area people sit on the sides anyway and sleep but you know you gotta give it an opportunity . 3498295_3498635
another neat thing about this &~b room is that right here where these chalkboards are three chalkboards lift hydraulically up into the air about thirty feet in the air .
pretty cool they <write on the one board> write on the one board write on the one board they don't feel like erasing it . 3512045_3512205
and here at the University of Michigan you can be lazy as a professor and hit that little key &=sound_effect lifts it up to the second level . 3512205_3525785
you get bored you're <writing on the board> writing on the board you don't want to erase that one either . 3525785_3525885
&=sound_effect you can go into three tiers up in the air and you got this huge phat chalkboard thing up in the air . 3559075_3559115
pretty cool so if you &~e ever have a class in there go in there (be)cause it's cool . 3559115_3559195
it's intimidating as hell but it's really cool .
just to realize that building that room we were in this morning that's just like all the +//. 3592425_3592645
a_lot_of all the +//.
&-uh blah la la la .
that's just like most of the &-um lecture halls on campus . 3592645_3594345
the one we were in this morning that's pretty standard . 3594345_3594385
don't flip out it's not that big .
that one is huge it's the first lecture hall I ever went in and the first one I ever saw I walked in registered for classes I'm all geeked I went in for my my &-uh my first class my chem one thirty class I sat down four hundred other people around me pissed myself I was so scared . 3594385_3594485
&=laughs but keep in mind that Angell Hall Auditorium A is the average size classroom that we were in this morning . 3610895_3617355
moving around the corner we have with this white little &-um Hershey's kiss looking thing that is a greenery green +//.
what is .
greenhouse ?
greenhouse .
greenhouse thank you very much yes I am a biology major .
&-uh the building behind there is the Biology Building not much in there except the Nat Sci Auditorium . 3617355_3617455
cool stuff happens in Nat Sci Auditorium they show free movies in there every now and then .
you gotta wait for about two hours in line just to see the free movie but it's pretty cool nonetheless .
and &-uh you'll take exams in there it's one of the worst places to take exams because you're sitting in this little chair and you got this little tiny desk like you did for those placement tests right the desks are smaller and &~th the &-uh +//. 3643075_3643515
the table +//.
&-er the +//.
the guy in front of you is even closer .
so you try to put your knee up you're kicking somebody in the back of the head it's a really big pain in the neck took all my exams in there that's why I didn't do so well here at the University of Michigan . 3643515_3643555
moving over here is <Angell Hall> Angell Hall pretty much speaks for itself a_lot_of great stuff in a_lot_of administration buildings etcetera etcetera etcetera .
any questions before we move on to the coolest part of the tour ?
is that where the Fishbowl is ? 3643555_3646615
that's where the Fishbowl is . 3647215_3647355
what is the Fishbowl ?
everybody's wondering what the Fishbowl is .
Fishbowl is one +//.
you'll see it on the third day .
unless you're an engineer .
&-uh then you won't see it . 3659345_3661985
&-um you'll see a cooler building actually .
but &-um the Fishbowl is a big big big room and it has about three hundred computers in it .
one of the largest &-um +...
here's a mystery chew .
oh_my_god .
I dropped a mystery chew . 3661985_3662685
has about three hundred computers in it and (i)s one of the biggest computing sites on campus . 3662825_3663725
&-uh University of Michigan houses more computers than any other facility in the United States except Microsoft and NASA .
whoa .
lots_of computers so the question is do I bring my own computer ? 3663725_3664345
obviously you don't hafta (be)cause you can find a computer somewhere else because we got that many computers I guarantee there's probably gonna be one available . 3664345_3667645
if you're willing to walk a little bit .
who wants a mystery chew ?
takers for the mystery chew ?
Adam's got the mystery chew threw it on the ground last part of the tour &=pause_while_walking back up . 3667645_3667785
alright .
this is the most sacred and beautiful part of campus . 3667785_3672065
this is the M and I know you guys think you know what the story is I know you guys think you know everything but you don't . 3702965_3703285
I'm telling you now you don't know the story of the M before we talk about the story of the M though because it's one of my favorite stories we're gonna talk about the story about the pumas which are in front of the Nat Sci &~Aud &-er Natural Science Museum . 3703285_3703385
pumas in front of the Natural Science Museum (be)cause they're gonna come into play later there are two big stone pumas in front of the Natural Science Museum and who knows what those +//.
that story is ?
every time .
you gotta run like naked <a in front of them> .
no no no shh .
that's coming up .
&=laughs:multiple next ?
come on everybody knows .
you mean like the bell ringing <and you have to run back and> xxx .
yeah that's true but there's something else .
okay so what everybody always thinks they always tell people on the campus day tours and the other campus day tours you know when you got your parents with you they always say every time &-um Michigan beats Ohio State the pumas roar . 3703385_3703765
well we beat Ohio State all the time . 3703765_3703805
and they're stone .
they're not roaring I'm sorry it's not gonna happen .
so actually what is true is every time a virgin graduates from University of Michigan the pumas roar . 3703805_3703905
and as they're stone they've never roared .
anyway so that's the legend just wanted to throw that out for the little thing there moving on to the last part of the tour this is the M . 3729465_3729825
very sacred and actually geographical center of campus this is the M . 3729825_3730165
the M was actually just refinished all this area right here all around it was +//.
used to be blue this blue part right here &-uh &~we used to be blue but it's not blue now it's rose or salmon or whatever the hell color you wanna call it and they just sent it to England last year to have it refinished . 3730165_3730265
last summer this whole area was completely redone so you're standing actually in the new Diag &-um and it's a_lot more light +//. 3744005_3756685
lit than it was before like I said I was playing frisbee here at two o'clock in the morning . 3756685_3756725
we're gonna come back from the comedy troupe thing at night and you +//. 3756725_3756765
we probably are not going to go through here but you look over here you see this wow I mean it looks like what do you call it Close Encounters of the Third Kind man it's just like all lit up it's totally cool people study out here under these lights two o'clock in the morning I'm not kidding at all . 3762865_3771065
so anyway really neat refinished and everything like that so what's what's the story about the M ?
you can't step on it .
shh .
see I don't want you to screw up the story see I appreciate your efforts but you can't screw up the story (be)cause everybody's got their own version of the story and everybody always tells their version of the story and it's wrong I guarantee it this is the only story here . 3791505_3791945
(be)cause it's your story .
(be)cause it's my story and I only tell the truth I never lie . 3791945_3792585
so anyway currently stepping on the M why am I allowed to step on the M ?
I just graduated from the University of Michigan and I've already taken a bluebook .
what's a bluebook ?
a bluebook is a big thick wad of paper . 3818165_3818185
with a blue cover on it .
and &~wh if you take a class like econ take a class like oh I don't know philosophy sociology history those kind of things . 3818185_3818325
involves a_lot_of reading and writing .
you're gonna probably take an essay exam .
that essay exam is gonna be given in a bluebook if you are to disrespect the M +...
eat the bluebook +/.
+, if you were to disrespect this M and step on it inappropriately you're gonna fail that bluebook because you have acquired the curse .
I I didn't do that .
I wanted to respect the M until after I took my first bluebook and I took that bluebook on my birthday October twenty seventh so you can all send me cards my freshman year and I aced that bluebook .
I did I studied I didn't step on the M and I aced that but somebody else . 3842765_3842805
they stepped on that M they studied hard too they got an A as well but they still acquired the curse . 3842805_3844845
and they should've failed their bluebook and it's coming later it may not come right away sometimes it takes awhile but they're gonna fail at some point . 3862645_3862785
the only way to reverse the curse is to strip completely naked from this spot and run all the way to the pumas over there by the Natural Science Museum and give (th)em a kiss &=sound_effect on the face run all the way back and get dressed by the stroke of midnight according to the Burton Tower .
that's the only way to reverse the curse .
so the night before bluebook exams hundreds and hundreds of people are running naked no not really but it'd be pretty cool if they were .
so anyway that is that about that .
are there any questions ?
no .
you guys are <so quiet> so quiet all day today .
fascinated .
fascinated in awe .
yeah .
that deserves a Starburst right there .
<okay good> .
definitely definitely .
how do you pronounce your name ? 3877585_3877985
Shill .
Sepa .
really .
yes .
that's beautiful .
thanks .
&=laughs .
no I'm not kidding at all that is awesome . 3908125_3908145
okay so anyway actually that concludes our tour . 3908145_3908245
yes .
+, I thank you very much for &-uh being on the tour sticking it out and &-uh dealing with my ramblings and craziness &-um the last couple minutes before we go in to go see the comedy troupe I like to hang out here and just relax (be)cause this is really a_lot_of work for me . 3908165_3913145
so we're all gonna hang out I got some frisbees in the back got some extra Starburst we're all just gonna chill I'm gonna play some frisbee if anybody's up for frisbee I'm definitely down with frisbee otherwise this concludes your tour here at the University of Michigan I hope you enjoyed yourself . 3935235_3941655
&=applause:multiple if you have any questions <you > thank you very much this is the first group that's clapped you guys . 3941655_3941715
so anyway I'm just gonna hang out over here so if you guys wanna come over here or you don't that's fine &-um you can go take a leak or anything over there if you want through those same buildings <over there> . 3941715_3943175
