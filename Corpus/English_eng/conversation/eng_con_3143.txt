cool . 0_46616
all right let's see what we have here . 46616_48826
we have a variety because um I sorted these out very carefully and
not just for that reason though (be)cause they didn't turn up
so the reason this group um only has two two by two designs to show
so this was Paul Dani Vanessa Brian and Brittany and they began
Brittany can you talk about this one a little bit ? 97115_99501
+^ what do you want to tell the group about this two by two design .
well that +/. 101718_103095
+< Kelly your eyes need to be over here . 103095_104471
well that one we um is different from the other one because it's
and this one isn't . 115178_116598
okay so Brittany wants you to notice that even though they used a
but this one Brittany says is not evening star . 129121_132608
it's different it has um um that um the um red square closest to
+< what color squares are you asking um the four red squares . 144000_146528
++ red squares red squares are on the corners . 146528_148385
and the um some of the four of the red squares are in the middle on
okay um somebody else in the group not Brittany Brittany you did a
who can tell me how you started with this same core square and used
what did you have to do to the core square each time to get it to
+^ did you just keep it the same in all positions ? 185778_187780
did you just take this one and copy it four times here here here
is that how this design was made ? 193951_195843
+< no . 195843_196280
Brian could you tell me a little bit about how you started with
+< I didn't build that xxx one but we xxx squares xxx . 202758_208113
hmm can you look at it and think about it even though that wasn't
+< we turned it so the &~r red square was facing the desk and +/. 210751_216803
okay so if I'm starting with this &~ar to here I had to turn it to
I'll move that one out a little bit so you can see which one we're
+< yeah so the two top ones are facing the desk and then the two
oh wait you're calling this the top and this the bottom right ? 230095_232470
yes . 232470_232700
I want you to think of you see this square that I just pulled out a
yeah . 235816_236420
will you think about that one and think about this as the core
what would I have to do to make this one into this one ? 239435_243640
just you have to I don't know . 243640_252626
do I have to turn it ? 252626_253528
uh no . 253528_256646
do I have to flip it ? 256646_257856
no . 257856_258515
so I just have to this one is just a +. 258515_261505
+< just leave it . 261505_262210
++ a copy . 262210_263118
right I just leave it . 263118_263618
this one's just a copy of the one we started with . 263618_265705
okay now let's think about this one . 265705_268138
so that one you have +/. 268138_270543
can I just copy it for this one ? 270543_270823
no . 270823_271775
oh okay . 271775_272475
um let's see if you wanted to make that one out of that one you'd
so if I flipped it like this ? 288608_290438
yeah . 290438_290943
okay and then it matches . 290943_293175
okay good job so that one I had to do a flip . 293175_296691
how (a)bout this one ? 296691_298943
what do I have to do to turn this that was my starting core square
this you gotta turn it right +. 305120_309315
okay . 309315_310571
++ left I mean . 310571_311705
left how much ? 311705_313041
a quarter turn . 313041_315673
and then you gotta flip it from the top . 315673_320726
flip it from the top . 320726_322028
did Brian match it ? 322028_325080
yeah . 325080_325813
yep and we can test . 325813_327116
okay . 327116_327830
all right and I'm gonna put it back in the starting
+^ what did you have to do to the core square to make that part of
um turn it right . 336808_340206
um how much ? 340206_342543
quarter turn . 342543_343881
flip it right a quarter turn . 343881_354006
um I can't flip it a quarter of the way . 354006_356751
gotta flip it all the way . 356751_359405
+< now do you want me to go back to the start and do you want to
go back . 363440_364056
okay so this is the way that the core square began and we want to
what would you have me do ? 369380_370530
we want it to match this one . 370530_378621
match just the green one ? 378621_384256
no this core square here (be)cause it's the same core square but
we had to we had to move it so that it would finish this cool
+^ who in Brian's group can help him ? 395763_397465
what do I need to do to this core square the starting core square
Dani what should I do to this one what should I do to it ? 403336_406438
flip it left . 406438_407540
flip it left . 407540_408273
like that ? 408273_410575
&=nods her head yes . 410575_410940
let's see did she do it ? 410940_412091
yep . 412091_412943
yep good job . 412943_414293
so sometimes Brian was asking me to turn and sometimes Brian and
+< flip . 422098_422516
so they turned and flipped the core square in different ways to get
what would the design look like if you just copied the core square
a mess . 430566_432310
uh xxx . 432310_433348
a mess ? 433348_434050
let's see . 434050_435905
this is how the core square started just like this one . 435905_439110
+^ I'm just gonna do that same thing +. 439110_441003
+< it'd look just like the evening star . 441003_443200
++ every time . 443200_444600
um hold on hold on . 444600_446171
+< xxx just like evening star . 446171_447218
no . 447438_448501
okay oh I got to click that together . 448501_450705
+< it's not evening star . 450705_451008
you don't think it's going to be evening star ? 451008_453141
there I copied it every time . 453141_454506
this was the beginning core square . 454506_455725
I copied it . 455725_456375
I copied it . 456375_457043
I copied it . 457043_457678
I copied it . 457678_458415
what does it look like ? 458415_460376
it looks like a big fat mess . 460376_461878
does it look like a mess ? 461878_463446
it looks like +/. 463446_464346
it looks like a quilt . 464346_465615
it looks like a two by two . 465615_469235
+< oh oh um it has to it looks like the blue part up in that top
cool . 476421_477273
okay so the blue parts remind you of an hour glass ? 477273_479041
+< yeah yeah . 479041_480343
my gosh that just reminds me of +/. 480343_481926
is there anything wrong with that design ? 481926_483415
no .483415_484075
when the core square is just copied ? 484075_485513
+< reminds me of an envelope . 485513_485930
the um +/. 485930_486551
+< which oh which part reminds you of an envelope ? 486551_488581
where do you see an envelope Brittany ? 488581_490245
xxx . 490245_491243
it does . 491243_492418
okay I'm gonna let Brittany sneak through and show us
+< these parts right here . 496950_497766
okay those parts remind you of an envelope ? 497766_500270
you know what guess where I thought you were maybe gonna
this part here the green parts being like the square part of the
+< that does and this . 507938_507940
wow maybe we just created a new kind of quilt design . 507940_511276
maybe it's a xxx design . 511276_513181
+< we made three but we made three but we can only have two because
right oh yeah that is a different two by two . 517128_519103
+< we had we had enough of these kind but we just didn't have
so can you make two by two design just by copying the core square
yeah . 526501_527685
yeah is there anything wrong with doing that ? 527685_529320
no . 529320_529853
no but to get a different two by two design from this one what
we couldn't just copy it every time . 535725_539878
+< xxx um if you took that one apart maybe we could make um another
um how many core squares go into a two by two design ? 552505_556440
four . 556440_557390
four yeah so would having any more help us ? 557390_560260
no . 560260_560810
nope but it does it did it was important for us to be
