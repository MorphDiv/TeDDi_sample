okay . 1070_29660
so, <what I think> I I've had the experience of
&=breath <and so> and so, what I had done was, I
but, other people had clever things and <they had it padded with>
yeah, I had to do that, too, actually . 9550_11990
xxx +//.
&=laugh xxx +//. 18090_19230
&=laugh . 18730_19580
I was thinking that we need some kind of lubricant . 29450_32590
I was thinking the same thing . 29960_31590
it will break hes@fp if you put it in the balloon, because it will
<how far> how far does this stretch ? 35030_37240
yeah . 37080_37490
yeah . 40150_41820
yeah, it would .
what if if we tape it completely, first, if we put tape around
<or we could always just> go ah@i +//. 44070_46420
that is a good idea, I think . 52680_54440
no ?
no, I <I'm thinking ma@i> well, I mean, that that is
ev@i even if we can't get it in here, &=breath we could always
<I wonder what would happen> I wonder if this is one of those
you know, if you blow it up and then it stays in the air, and
I don' t know . 66940_67560
uh@fp . 71860_73680
uh@fp . 72720_73660
yeah, you know, we should do that . 79040_80770
&=laugh . 81260_82710
I think that might work . 82230_83280
mhm . 83480_83760
but, now, let us see, what can we do with a paper+clip ? 83990_86090
we don't have to use it . 88790_89980
poke the hole in the top of the cup to get the string through ? 89620_92940
see uhm@fp maybe we +//. 93010_93910
maybe, yeah, if you put the balloon on the bottom as an
&=breath the egg, this, and then we want this to fall like
maybe we can use <the hair+clip> the the clip to put
&=breath and then, this, to drop it like this, maybe it will stay .
hm . 111240_111590
wouldn't it be interesting . 119060_145900
well, what would happen if we did something like that ?
if we poked a hole in here, &=smack &=breath and we had our string
and if it falls, <it is not> it is just kind of like in
yeah, but the thing is, you don't know how if the egg is gonna
<like you can't really guarantee> like even if the weight is
mhm . 152690_153120
oh . 158630_159500
yeah, I'm wondering if there is some way that we could stick tape
we can put tape hes@fp like this, <if we> maybe
just bunch tape up . 166030_167500
just uh@fp you know . 170780_171810
oh, as like a cushion ? 171840_173010
mhm . 173090_173610
yeah . 173220_173610
oh, well, well, that would take a lot of tape . 174230_176450
but, we have a lot . 176990_178320
&=laugh we have a whole roll, that doesn't matter . 177280_179290
well, then . 179470_182380
hm@fp &=breath &=noise we could do that .
we could also maybe +//.
but you don't think like if we use this as a parachute +//. 181930_185110
I don't think it would work, unless we had that right kind of stuff
<like if> I mean, if we did +//. 187670_189180
no, I mean, like if we used her idea of like putting little pieces
&=breath and then <put like a> &=smack blew up a balloon
&=breath I mean, <it would> it would save it from a
we can blow the balloon <just to sa@i> just to see uhm@fp
what happened ? 213370_218580
do any volunteers ?
&=laugh it hurts my ears when I do it .
&=laugh . 216640_217260
uh@fp i@i i@i if you can tie that, and then we can always
&=breath uhm@fp and then then just see if it floats .
<I will just> we don't have to break it . 239330_245730
&=laugh .
&=laugh . 245230_245930
what do you mean, floating balloons and non+floating balloons ? 245510_249980
<don't all balloons fl@i> what do you mean ?
<it is not really> I don't think it will be light enough to
yeah . 251920_252610
it is not +//.
it would help, though . 255780_258940
don't you think ?
yeah . 255810_256200
<I don't think> I don't think . 258120_259810
is there any way to xxx +//. 259890_261240
I mean, once it starts falling in the air . 260770_262930
just to see . 264640_265350
I mean, it helps a bit, right ? 271920_273520
well, okay . 274430_276850
count up .
maybe if we had that on the bottom, if we had that blown
so, it is immobile .
&=breath well, no .
okay, so, sort of like like this, but hes@fp only we
and it is almost the same thing . 280140_282970
and just use one cup ? 284190_285310
oh, yeah, beca@i look, &=breath if we do that the +//. 289350_292190
if we try to like tape the cup to the top ? 292820_294900
hes@fp first, <it will> uh@fp it will uh@fp hurt the balloon .
so, it will slow down . 294060_302630
&=breath &=breath and maybe if we put the tape, also, as
right . 296700_297350
can I see that balloon for a second ? 302680_306050
so, we could do something like +//. 302680_306050
<or we can> maybe also this balloon be cl@i uh@fp
kind of like this, like if we were to &=breath put the egg on the
&=laugh . 312280_316380
&=laugh . 314340_315620
put the other side . 316120_317090
that might work, eh ? 317910_318900
uh@fp what oh, however <however it would most> I'm
okay . 324120_324520
yeah, but what if it falls like this ? 324720_326170
that would +//. 326140_326580
yeah, but but I think that it wouldn't, though . 328850_335210
because, <I just think that physics would maybe> well, who
we we could try to like just +//. 328850_335210
tape the balloon to the egg ? 334860_338150
or the egg to the balloon ? 334860_338150
well, like put the egg inside this cup . 338420_353660
and then, you know, tape the egg to the inside, sort of,
&=breath it may may not do that, I don't know what what
if if there was something heavier in the other part, the
mhm . 361910_365260
&=smack &=breath so, then we could put another cup down here .
weight, yeah . 362250_363160
yeah . 363410_363810
yeah . 364920_371270
or <we tie> we can tie something heavier here, and put the
but, I'm afraid tha@i +//. 364920_371270
like the marker ? 370630_373470
maybe that is why we have the marker . 370630_373470
oh . 370630_373470
yeah, the marker is quite heavy . 372700_377930
&=breath and this, also, we can tie this . 372700_377930
let us compare the way the +//. 374910_376390
it is a little heavier, but . 379210_380520
yeah, but this uh@fp with this, we can put both . 380470_382920
yeah, we we could tape those t@i sort of to the bottom,
&=laugh . 383830_388100
what do you think, Debb ? 388250_389740
uhm@fp . 388250_389740
&=laugh . 389100_393470
I don't know . 389630_399850
&=laugh &=breath I don't know if it would help, or you're just
&=laugh . 389730_390290
now, let us see . 401370_416350
so, if we we we immobilize the egg inside the cup, and I
&=smack uhm@fp now, <maybe what we ought to do is> let us
you have to cushion it, too . 406510_408230
I just want to to to make a test . 417460_419130
oh, okay . 419330_419990
the thing is that we have to take xxx oh +//. 423980_426450
wait . 425430_428180
careful, it doesn't pop, here . 425430_428180
let us cushion our egg again . 432180_435880
let us put it in its nest . 432180_435880
oh xxx +//. 435270_436090
oops . 437860_441950
&=laugh &=breath <it is gotta> it is a smiley face with a hat
&=laugh . 443260_445720
oh . 452200_452880
&=laugh . 452200_452880
oh, no . 452470_455320
&=laugh did you destroy our balloon ? 452470_455320
&=laugh . 452470_455320
&=laugh . 452580_453410
no, no . 455940_458050
&=breath &=laugh it just uh@fp +//. 455940_458050
&=laugh <it just deflated> it just deflated . 456650_460680
oh, just untied . 458060_461690
oh, okay . 458060_461690
&=laugh . 458060_461690
oh . 458940_459240
how did it fall, though ? 460200_461290
it bounced . 462430_466260
<it bounced when it> when it hit, it bounced . 462430_466260
uh@fp how did it what ? 462500_465420
it bounced first, yeah . 462500_465420
hm@fp . 468020_468520
first, yeah, it make shboom@n and floop@n . 470060_473770
yeah . 473880_474200
hm@fp &=breath now, egg you remember that eggs do have a bit
they you know, they're in those cartons and they're jostled
&=breath so, <we don't have to be> hes@fp th@i we
if we're not gonna use both cups, you could take one cup and
hm . 496820_497190
hm@fp yeah . 497040_497760
yeah, that is a good idea . 497280_498830
we could break this cup up and like make an egg shield . 499400_521430
we could like tape the Styrofoam to the sides of the &=laugh
&=laugh <I think> I think we should do that . 499400_521430
&=laugh I think that we should &=breath break the Styrofoam up, and
&=laugh <and then> uh@fp and then we can like put the hat
and then we could +//. 499400_521430
yeah . 500050_500420
&=laugh supersonic egg shield . 503870_506410
&=laugh . 505620_510710
&=laugh . 506290_506920
yeah . 507690_508020
cushion it, tape it all up . 512840_514190
yeah . 513910_514260
yeah, this should work . 516900_517920
but, we have to t@i make sure that the hat would stay on the
because the tape is not really resistant . 520980_527660
well +//. 525020_525430
what would happen <if we put> rather than than having it
but, it it'll hit with this side coming down first . 528350_543580
hm@fp . 538430_539230
hm . 541230_541550
this would work . 546640_547620
hm . 546650_546860
we could try that, I'm just afraid that too much weight on the
we should draw a schematic, good idea . 548550_553430
we'll do, yeah, like uh@fp like in the word and the word
so, we have the egg ? 552530_570510
&=noise hm@fp this is the egg . 552530_570510
&=breath we'll use that one, we have one cup . 552530_570510
&=breath so, we do a shell with a +//. 552530_570510
so, we'll break up one of the cups and we'll put stuff around it
right . 570430_582480
right, and then that will be inside of another cup . 570430_582480
&=noise . 585640_586080
mhm . 591440_592020
right . 595130_595790
and then that'll be upside down on top of the balloon . 597350_600200
&=smack upside down ? 604020_604810
yeah, so, it'll be like this . 605040_606510
like that . 605900_606800
oh . 607150_607800
yeah, like that . 607230_612120
so, it'll be with the base of the cone down on top of the
&=noise . 608280_608580
&=laugh . 615520_617100
and then +//. 617240_617980
and then, what is on the bottom ? 617450_618920
and then, here . 617660_618680
and then I was thinking that we could have the roll of tape, sort
like this ? 621960_622550
yeah, if <if that> if that would work . 623410_625740
but +//. 623410_625740
yeah, I think it would be good, yeah . 625300_627140
but, now, how would we secure that ? 627380_637310
because I'm I'm just afraid that <too much weight on the
tape ? 630500_631060
now we have to tape that . 637180_638800
you're afraid it'll let go ? 638250_639460
I'm afraid that the tape won't hold the roll of tape to the
or that too much weight +//. 639840_644750
'cause it is heavy . 642860_643770
why don't we use the marker, then ? 644500_645870
it is just uneven . 647600_650980
uhm@fp . 647600_650980
hm@fp &=smack okay, so, this is one idea . 650500_657940
we don't really want to start breaking up our cup before we can
yeah . 657050_657400
right . 657460_658020
and we still have time . 658620_659650
now, <how else could we> &=breath I think that it is a good
we can keep that idea, but let us just try to think if we can
hm@fp it would be interesting if we had scissors and we
where is our paper+clip ? 659740_680160
I like xxx +//. 659740_680160
why would you cut the balloon apart ? 679870_681630
here . 679870_681630
because then you could wrap the egg up in it . 681950_697300
<in the> in the rubber, you could sort of like dangle
you know, egg is never gonna get inside there, but . 681950_697300
&=smack &=breath hm@fp . 681950_697300
yeah . 687200_687460
and uhm@fp no . 698600_701760
so so, we had this idea, originally, with having the egg sort
I don't know, I I think that this might be, you know,
I think even if we did suspend it with the tape that uhm@fp it
the string and the tape . 715870_717080
yeah, it is very possible . 718560_719740
what would happen if we had a little balloon and we stuck it inside
you can let a little air out . 729170_730360
&=laugh &=breath yeah, like that, &=breath and then we put the egg
it is not smooth enough at all . 748090_749820
that that is very interesting . 754960_765070
and then, what would happen if we put tape, while <it is> it
yeah, that might work . 758030_759160
mhm . 761720_763040
&=smack I don't +//. 761720_763040
and tape over like this . 764640_766850
right . 766680_767040
over top of that . 766730_768550
and even if it falls this way +//. 767040_769990
mhm, <it di@i> it won't move . 770380_771610
yeah . 771750_774150
we hope so . 771750_774150
<so it now> okay . 775320_776820
so +//. 775320_776820
but, what if it lands on it is side, though ? 776470_778350
well, <but the tape> the the egg will be taped to the
yeah, but you can't guarantee that the balloon is not gonna move .
yeah, what what I meant was, what if the cups land
well, no, but +//. 789590_790190
might lose the tape . 789910_791060
well, but, i@i if i@i <if the> if the egg is
like this ? 794000_794690
yeah, like that . 794810_795870
okay . 797930_798620
now, because the the balloon, once it is blown up, it'll
because you'll you'll put strips of tape all across the top of
be like a +//. 816570_817040
it would be like a little cage . 819510_820860
or <we can> uh@fp we can try to make something very
<I think it> I think it was good the way you had it when you
wow . 828940_829450
that <having that> it needs to have a little bit of air
yeah . 830800_831190
&=laugh . 832060_835810
&=laugh . 832350_833260
<I think it was good the way you had it the first time where>
hm . 835950_836270
hm . 843380_843710
<I think this might even> I think this might be better . 845910_848420
one cup, balloon, the eggs, &=noise tape . 848620_860890
now there is a strip of &=breath +//. 858950_860350
yeah . 861640_871320
and then the egg itself is taped to the balloon . 861640_871320
&=smack &=breath you know what, I think that that'll work . 861640_871320
I think what we ought to do before we uhm@fp +//. 861640_871320
tape, tape, tape . 865680_867750
and then, the second cup . 870970_875380
&=noise &=breath and we tape all this . 870970_875380
now, how cups +//. 876320_877000
we could also put these little things inside of it, up here, you
you we can also, if you have enough, yeah . 878720_880720
mhm . 881470_881980
<I think what> so, we should blow the balloon up to a@i
and then <before we> before we <we put it> <I
oh . 889370_889890
a little more, I think, okay, and <then we can> and we may
okay, like this . 910550_911450
now, let us just see, how how is this ? 914820_919180
&=breath <the egg I think needs to> let us see . 914820_919180
uh@fp uh@fp if I put it in the other way, word . 919080_922440
yeah, that that is pretty good, I think . 935680_956430
what do you think ? 935680_956430
<and then> &=breath now, we'll take the this balloon out,
<we can tape> we'll tape, before we stick the balloon
hm@fp . 944290_944580
be@i before we blow in the balloon ? 956810_958520
no, no . 959840_964320
well, I I think we need to let a little air out of the
oh . 960710_961060
hm@fp yeah, but, I &=breath <I'm not sure if we can>
but uhm@fp +//. 965330_965950
mhm . 975310_975680
is there still a lot of cushion on that ? 978750_980550
yes . 981920_983880
oh . 981920_983880
well, on@i once it gets mushed@n down in there . 982910_993440
here, why don't you try tying it with a string jus@i
but, hes@fp I'm afraid that af@i if we can't remove it +//. 992620_995830
oops . 998430_999020
well oh . 1003060_1004180
okay . 1005170_1005660
and if we do it this way, we can do it in hes@fp any such building,
we don't have to go outside . 1007030_1015580
&=laugh . 1007030_1015580
now hm@fp &=breath see, I'm just wondering, it feels like it is
so, I wonder if we can just let a little bit more air out, I'm just
and &=noise &=breath what <if you put it> if you
do you mean put it down here, instead of on top of the balloon ? 1042080_1045040
hm@fp okay . 1045560_1048380
<can we> <can we try the> can we try this ? 1045560_1048380
uh@fp okay . 1062680_1064400
so, there is a +//. 1062680_1064400
there is a a point where <it is not> it is flat, or it is
&=smack okay . 1070770_1088490
&=smack &=breath well, &=smack &=breath <there i@i>
you think that that'll be a good idea ? 1070770_1088490
the which uh@fp +//. 1079480_1080280
instead of the first one ? 1089050_1090160
yeah, <instead of> this one, instead of this one . 1090110_1093080
mm . 1093020_1095500
why do you think that one is better ? 1093020_1095500
because you wou@i totally immobilize the egg . 1096080_1125520
it is not like we're trying to hope that we can have a weight .
&=breath th@i that the the really falling point of
hes@fp and this tape really is not strong enough, I don't think, to
yeah . 1111700_1112070
yeah, the only reason I'm a little bit worried about that idea
mhm . 1132990_1133380
because a balloon, by nature, like, it expands . 1134550_1148790
&=breath so, if there is a weight that is pulling it, like, it is
do you know what I mean ? 1134550_1148790
&=breath like, even if you tape it to the egg, it is just <the
well +//. 1142810_1143200
well, <I don't think it> I don't think it really can move,
okay . 1154020_1156180
got it . 1154020_1156180
I don't think that it really can move, because the egg itself is
it is gonna be like taped with stuff over it . 1159710_1173570
<if we> look, if we put tape here +//. 1173430_1176490
no, no, no, I mean, I see what you're saying, but I just think
like, unless you fill the up this space to where it can't . 1179910_1191600
okay, this +//. 1183790_1184880
we have to fill this, yeah . 1191550_1193620
maybe y@i +//. 1191550_1193620
wrinkle up some tape and put it in all around the edges . 1193490_1196770
like this, yeah . 1196050_1196950
hm@fp yeah . 1196920_1197440
well, okay, so &=breath +//. 1197760_1199630
I mean, hes@fp &=breath I'm not saying that that is a bad idea,
and I don't have any other better ideas . 1200870_1210170
so, I would go with that . 1200870_1210170
this one looks nicer, but . 1206530_1208450
&=laugh . 1206530_1208450
well, okay . 1210510_1250830
now, let us see . 1210510_1250830
<we could> hm@fp it needs a little bit more air, I think, just
&=breath but, we see th@i this, <it really> I
&=breath okay, let me think . 1210510_1250830
egg in here, egg taped to balloon . 1210510_1250830
of course, I think the balloon does need a little bit more air . 1210510_1250830
&=noise &=breath but, uhm@fp so, there'll be like strips of
it really shouldn't move . 1210510_1250830
&=laugh . 1234600_1236070
mhm . 1251130_1251550
the tape, I think, will adhere really well w@i wit@i you
&=breath and we can put tape in the bottom here, against the
&=breath and then, I was thinking, <we could put> you know,
hm . 1277460_1277840
&=smack hm@fp okay . 1283350_1283800
I don't know . 1284460_1315060
so, there is that idea, but we don't have to be settled on that one
&=smack because we could always, h@i &=breath you know,
oh yeah, we were gonna break up &=smack &=breath the Styrofoam,
were we gonna do that ? 1284460_1315060
<but okay> <so you really don't think> &=breath I'm not
&=laugh &=breath but, okay, if you had the balloon &=swallow like
you really don't think it would ? 1318480_1350320
not this balloon, it is not helium . 1350520_1352760
and I don't +//. 1350520_1352760
no . 1353070_1358390
but, I mean, it does to a certain extent . 1353070_1358390
like, it is gonna make it lighter than a free+fall . 1353070_1358390
not i@i +//. 1356280_1356820
but not enough to, I think, prevent it it . 1359200_1365950
because you're going from like what, fifty feet or something like
yeah, but still . 1366180_1375260
okay, so, why do you think that a balloon would cushion it
because because +//. 1371950_1372970
because, here, the egg is hitting first . 1374540_1381430
<there is nothing to> <this is> these pieces are not
and you really think it is gonna fall with this side down ? 1381540_1383950
well, sure, this is the heavier side . 1384560_1394430
uhm@fp the balloon, I mean, uh@fp the the egg is here, it
well, there is a hm@fp big chance that <it will first>
&=breath it will first land like this, and then it will uh@fp
and if there is nothing to block it, even, it will fall and
topple over . 1403540_1404330
mhm . 1406960_1407390
but +//. 1407820_1407990
but, rolling isn't gonna do anything . 1416190_1421480
I mean, on@i once it hits, the major force of the +//. 1416190_1421480
we just have to <to take> to make sure that <there is>
&=laugh . 1420830_1427880
uhm@fp hm@fp &=smack &=breath uh@fp I wish I were better at
I mean, &=laugh &=breath I don't know . 1429170_1454430
&=breath but, uhm@fp as opposed to this one, wh@i
&=laugh . 1440970_1441450
&=smack okay . 1456220_1456650
okay . 1457510_1513460
uhm@fp all the impact of uh@fp contact with the ground
but, &=breath <we don't> we can't really suspend the egg in
we can't really &=breath immobilize it as well in here as we could
&=breath &=smack and then with this idea, with the the hat
but, then, that really isn't any cushion, again, inside the cup . 1457510_1513460
&=breath and in order <for d@i> to guarantee it hitting,
and <I'm not really> &=breath this this is very flimsy
&=breath I don't know . 1457510_1513460
but, we have the tape and we have this, also, &=breath that we can
we have two things . 1512910_1523490
but <but the> but the &=noise &=breath the egg is
we have the tape and this . 1525530_1527200
but, this, once the balloon is blown up, I'm just saying I don't
it could, but I'm afraid that mid fall it'll like fall off, or
I don't know . 1527610_1540220
okay . 1553350_1554480
so +//. 1553350_1554480
one, uh@fp <we j@i> we will just take one piece of tape that
okay . 1558310_1558830
up, like, up . 1558930_1565330
you <you mean> you meant like this, right ? 1558930_1565330
mhm . 1565420_1569950
I mean, we could probably tape it like that uhm@fp or +//. 1565420_1569950
can I have this piece ? 1570610_1571790
yeah, <we would ta@i> we would tape it all around and then
turn it . 1573320_1574770
&=throat . 1573320_1574770
yeah, but, I don't want to use all the tape, right now, so I try it
yeah . 1578400_1578720
here, you can do it <on to> on to that chair, maybe . 1595780_1597440
no, maybe maybe not on the chair, because it is hitting the
I don't think that it'll pop . 1604660_1609670
yeah, &=laugh I don't want it to to to break . 1609370_1614170
&=breath &=noise can we have another balloon in case of +//. 1609370_1614170
no balloon . 1615390_1616300
okay . 1615390_1616300
okay, I don't want to do it . 1615930_1619520
&=laugh . 1615930_1619520
&=laugh . 1617890_1618810
well, &=smack I'll I'll just do it from from a baby
it seems to fall pretty well . 1618450_1621070
I didn't see hm@fp +//. 1618450_1621070
now, that is what it did from, like &=breath how many, like two
&=breath it jiggled a lot . 1624680_1631380
and now from a very +//. 1624680_1631380
yeah, but we just put two piece of tape, not very well, also . 1630680_1634680
yeah, it it I guess it could survive the fall, yeah . 1634930_1649000
&=breath but, now, hes@fp &=breath if we dropped it from like this
yeah, but as long as we don't blow up the balloon too much, it is
can we +//. 1649230_1649600
no, no, no, no, uhm@fp well, uh@fp yeah, okay . 1652640_1684330
hes@fp I'm not really quite so worried, <I'm just> like the
where where is the cup ? 1652640_1684330
so, this is what it would sort of look like, and then we would
but, <we can't really> &=breath you know, <it is not
mhm . 1661570_1661930
we can tape e@i everything together . 1684690_1687750
that is interesting . 1688580_1691650
but, now, how are you gonna actually secure the egg inside the cup
with this uh@fp cup . 1691650_1694080
how what did we +//. 1695540_1696700
we make a shell, &=breath and maybe if we use +//. 1698020_1700420
I think that +//. 1714660_1715290
one thing is that maybe if we use this as uhm@fp can you
mhm . 1719390_1719970
how is that going to slow it down ? 1729290_1730840
I don't know . 1731830_1738740
&=smack &=breath but, uhm@fp &=smack &=breath I'm just seeing
<that might> think that might poke the balloon and break
let us see . 1740230_1741340
first +//. 1740230_1741340
yeah . 1741640_1742250
&=laugh . 1741640_1742250
no . 1744640_1788960
&=breath <I think that if> <if a@i> I think that if we
<that would probably> and that way, that might be some way
&=breath <I don't think that> <that we> I don't think we
&=smack &=breath <so we need to decide> okay, so, we we
what does everyone think ? 1744640_1788960
&=smack personally, I think that you've got about &=laugh the
&=breath so . 1744640_1788960
&=laugh . 1787780_1788610
<what is> <what is> uhm@fp &=smack the thing is that we
<at the> okay . 1788960_1800040
mhm . 1799320_1799710
<the benefit of this one> so, let us look at pros and cons of
okay, the pros and cons of &=breath plan number one, good . 1802520_1820740
we can guarantee that the bottom of the balloon will hit first, the
yeah, <the only thing is that we> hm@fp the only thing is <we
<I think that we can make the h@i> uh@fp if we can secure that
&=breath uhm@fp so, will that really reduce the weight of the roll
<how much do you think> I think the weight will still be
yeah, I think it would stay on . 1837720_1839680
uhm@fp . 1852220_1852750
yeah . 1870280_1882490
&=noise &=laugh &=noise that is a good point, 'cause we're
uhm@fp &=smack &=breath can we think about something else, a mix of
&=breath . 1886220_1892510
hm ? 1894980_1895330
if &=breath we put the balloon on the bottom, <if we do>
&=laugh . 1898350_1899280
&=laugh . 1898400_1900020
hm@fp that might work . 1910830_1911690
<so you mean> oh, so, just take the idea of &=breath
word . 1923030_1923340
mhm . 1923160_1923490
put some tape on the hole, then we will &=laugh +//. 1926330_1928300
oh, no . 1927360_1927740
yeah, there is a hole . 1927630_1928710
there is a hole now ? 1928960_1929790
yeah . 1929850_1935140
I think it won't matter if we use this one . 1929850_1935140
&=laugh . 1929850_1935140
oh, no . 1931100_1931700
&=laugh . 1934300_1936090
I guess that we have decided our fate . 1935200_1945420
&=laugh &=breath all right, well, all right . 1935200_1945420
so, <we can> where is the hole ? 1935200_1945420

&=laugh . 1935500_1936960
&=laugh . 1937020_1937830

blow, you will see it . 1944670_1945680
it is right here . 1946000_1951100
okay . 1946000_1951100
uhm@fp . 1946000_1951100
do you want one person to blow and the other person put it on there
it is probably better to put it on when it is blown up, don't you
<because maybe> &=breath or maybe, also, what we can do +//. 1956500_1959010
yeah, I think, <because it> see, look <it is> it is a
all right . 1961240_1961600
&=throat . 1963480_1963960
hm@fp okay . 1965380_1967140
here, ready ? 1965380_1967140
we can +//. 1967710_1968270
uhm@fp okay, I wanna take a fresh piece of tape here . 1967780_1970930
hang on one second . 1967780_1970930
holy . 1982240_1985850

sorry . 1982870_1983410
&=laugh . 1982870_1983410
sort of . 1986480_1998640
<this isn't> it is not sticking on too well . 1986480_1998640
&=laugh uhm@fp that is not really working, &=breath it is getting

&=laugh &=breath &=noise &=breath okay . 2001560_2005830
&=laugh . 2001560_2005830
if we don't blow it too much, <it can> it can stay, I guess .
we blow it at the last moment . 2006030_2011680
and uh@fp +//. 2006030_2011680
here, ready ? 2006100_2006890
hm@fp . 2006100_2006890
well, wait a minute . 2012250_2016620
&=breath I guess we can't really use anything, but what if we
a piece of ? 2017040_2017720
Styrofoam on the hole ? 2017960_2019240
Styrofoam . 2018060_2018620
tape then . 2019640_2024520
&=laugh . 2019640_2024520
&=laugh &=breath I don't think so . 2020320_2027500
&=breath &=laugh no, here, just put a piece of tape on, but, we
&=laugh I don't think that would've worked . 2020930_2024330
&=laugh . 2020930_2024330
put I was gonna say, make the piece of tape smaller . 2027970_2030700
yeah . 2028230_2028650
yeah, and just put it on, don't like pull it up like you did, just
ready ? 2031340_2044950
&=smack &=breath I feel like we're doing drugs &=laugh or
&=laugh &=breath okay, I shouldn't have said that . 2031340_2044950

come on, you just doing it &=laugh to get over with . 2049280_2051160
okay . 2050910_2051320
we're doing balloon &=laugh surgery . 2051390_2052840
&=laugh . 2053270_2053910
oh, it is not staying . 2056990_2058030
it is wet . 2057410_2058060
yeah, because the <the he@i> the moisture from from
the moisture in the balloon . 2060140_2061770
inside the balloon . 2062860_2063830
it is sort of disintegrating our tape stuff . 2064200_2070840
&=smack &=breath maybe maybe we should be able to ask if we
she said, no, we can't use that . 2071050_2072800
no, just to mend our balloon . 2072930_2074490
mm . 2073290_2073800
oh . 2074490_2074910
can we use this to mend our balloon ? 2076750_2078070
&=laugh &=breath we cannot use that to mend our balloon . 2079900_2083110
uhm@fp . 2081710_2082290
something else, if the balloon won't uh@fp stay, &=smack can we
mhm . 2086200_2086510
uh@fp yeah . 2100860_2102090
mhm . 2103900_2104220
it'll be like i@i the egg would be in a little crate

mhm . 2110570_2111110
and +//. 2113110_2113660
I think we can still use the balloon to some extent . 2113680_2130920
&=smack uhm@fp &=smack &=breath maybe we ought to just tape it
&=breath and then we can still put it in here, but if you wanna
&=breath uhm@fp &=smack let us just see if this'll +//. 2113680_2130920
I think <we can just> ju@i we can use just one cup . 2134380_2140910
and use the other one as a protection . 2134380_2140910
yeah, yeah . 2139840_2140760
do you want another piece ? 2153520_2154710
Tam is now performing surgery . 2155720_2159720
&=laugh balloon surgery . 2155720_2159720
&=laugh . 2155720_2159720
now, I wanna piece over here on the side of this thing, so that
I wonder how much time we have ? 2171720_2173140
probably about ten minutes, I would say . 2173850_2177820
five or ten minutes . 2173850_2177820
how long ? 2174090_2174700
and we have to have this completely put together ? 2178460_2181320
ten, yeah . 2179710_2180240
putting it together won't be so hard, I don't think . 2181250_2183180
everyone approves of my &=smack tinkering, here . 2188790_2193130
hope it works . 2188790_2193130
uh@fp it is not gonna work . 2209110_2214930
well, we'll see what stays on, I don't know . 2209110_2214930
maybe if we put the hole against the +//. 2219600_2222670
the side of the cup . 2223800_2224980
uh@fp the side of the cup . 2224540_2225810
mm, <there is> hm@fp it is +//. 2235030_2236750
&=laugh . 2246860_2250130
okay, plan C . 2247720_2250910
so, &=laugh &=breath sh@i maybe +//. 2247720_2250910
<why don't we wrap the egg in the> &=laugh no, &=laugh it
&=laugh . 2250530_2255170
yeah, we can rub the &=laugh the &=laugh +//. 2252810_2255190
where where wait a minute, <where is the hole>
it is on the side . 2256690_2257740
well, it is on the side . 2257830_2258820
<it is> <it is like on the si@i> uh@fp I don't think that
pretty far down . 2260000_2265530
&=breath I thought maybe we could blow up the bottom part of it and
mm, it is too far down . 2266040_2268060
uh@fp where is the +//. 2266640_2267530
no, it is too far down . 2266780_2268010
xxx +//. 2279960_2280600
that would be cool if we could <tie the> tie off the regular
mhm . 2288390_2289070
that would be really cool . 2289100_2293530
&=smack &=breath we <we could always> we could just tie
<or else d@i> or else, do like Celine is doing, she is holding
well, what we could do would be just tie off that end, widen the
I'm trying to blow <in the> in the hole, but, too small .
I don't think it would be too easy to tie off, though, 'cause it is
it is +//. 2307150_2312390
no, no, just +//. 2308430_2309230
mhm . 2311840_2312290
if you try to stretch it a little bit, maybe . 2318870_2320510
yeah, but I don't want to make it uh@fp larger . 2322190_2324660
no, I mean, just like +//. 2325150_2326010
I think it is already shot . 2325560_2326870
yeah, I mean , see , like stretch it hes@fp uhm@fp sort
if we can't use it, blowed up, I was thinking, once we cushion the
darn it . 2338450_2339020
well, yeah . 2343830_2344460
&=laugh no, I can't . 2346100_2349830
&=laugh after the surgery, it is uh@fp +//. 2346100_2349830
see, <this tape just isn't the kind of tape> y@i you
&=smack &=breath actually, I have waterproof tape with me, but
<it is> it is, you know, that medical tape stuff . 2353430_2379810
&=breath we could always just cut the balloon apart with our
you know what I mean ? 2353430_2379810
right . 2356370_2356920
yeah, it is not the right kind of tape . 2358090_2359630
not allowed to use it . 2365470_2366560
no, rip it . 2380740_2381590
here, I'll show you . 2381620_2398880
so, <we can take our l@i> where is the little hole friend ? 2381620_2398880
we can just use our paper+clip . 2381620_2398880
you know, sort of, <make the> you know, open it, like if
open it up, and then wrap the egg in it, tie it around, and
mhm . 2392950_2393620
yeah . 2397580_2397960
yeah . 2398820_2400710
but, what is this little piece of +//. 2398820_2400710
it is a rubber, it'll help to absorb the shock . 2401030_2402780
even this thin ? 2403740_2404720
hm@fp &=breath I think before you wrap that around the egg, I think
sure . 2405480_2405800
tape tape around the egg, balloon, cup, and piece of
hm@fp yeah, that is a good idea . 2415100_2416740
yeah . 2416620_2417060
yeah, so, what we're we're gonna use one cup only for dropping
yeah . 2420620_2421040
right . 2420920_2421300
and then we're going to cut this off, sort of like like an
I think <we can use> uhm@fp we can use uhm@fp this stuff to
sure, sure . 2427550_2446160
we all we need to do is get a hole in here and we can just
uhm@fp and then, &=smack we'll cut off pieces, then we'll tape it
you know, like this level, stick the egg in there . 2427550_2446160
and then +//. 2427550_2446160
yeah . 2429570_2430070
hm . 2442680_2443080
just just put it all over the egg . 2445780_2449210
stick everything to the egg . 2445780_2449210
shall we start ? 2448980_2449810
yes . 2450850_2451290
okay . 2451950_2453350
so, first thing +//. 2451950_2453350
seems like we don't really have a choice now, with time &=laugh and
y@i &=laugh +//. 2454540_2455740
well, hm@fp who knows, we we could be the new engineers or
hopefully . 2455230_2462390
&=breath all right . 2455230_2462390
so +//. 2455230_2462390
&=laugh . 2460400_2461370
I think we don't +//. 2462060_2463840
so, we need little pieces of tape . 2463360_2464910
hm@fp . 2465680_2466230
<first we'll> okay, so, <you w@i> <you want> you
yeah, but <I want> I don't want to start at uh@fp the line I
I want to start uh@fp lower to be sure that we are not breaking it
okay . 2477440_2482550
&=smack &=breath okay . 2477440_2482550
&=breath so, just pop a hole in there, first . 2477440_2482550
yeah . 2490630_2496230
and we can start breaking off bits of tape, and so, I'll just grab
you have some pieces I thought, yeah, we can use . 2496610_2498760
here, you can have some, if you want . 2501420_2503140
shall we drop these into the cup, you think ? 2508520_2510130
yeah . 2511320_2511670
make them more ball like, maybe . 2511690_2513390
like ball, like a circle ? 2516180_2518690
ball ? 2516180_2518690
yeah, I was thinking like that . 2518140_2523660
that maybe the sticky side up, and that'll help to stick
sticky side up ? 2524130_2525860
okay . 2524130_2525860
yeah, ju@i <I don't know> I <I don't know>
what do you think ? 2525550_2532710
so, I think bigger would be more cushion, I don't know . 2533530_2537150
okay . 2535040_2535480
oh, we we could just make a mix like it is like grat@i
&=laugh . 2538130_2541210
&=laugh . 2539310_2541700
now now, &=breath are we gonna stick any to the egg, just
no, no, no, we're we're gonna put a Styrofoam shell around the
okay . 2544410_2545110
oh, okay . 2546310_2546990
you're doing pretty well, there, actually . 2551600_2552720
we're gonna use Styrofoam, too, right ? 2552120_2553630
yeah, <we're gonna use> <good job> good job . 2553790_2560260
good, that is good . 2553790_2560260
yeah . 2560350_2560800
and then we'll just tape that over top, good . 2561890_2563710
five minutes, okay . 2567350_2572100
&=breath uhm@fp okay, I break it, big piece . 2567350_2572100
uhm@fp &=breath I think that what we need to do, w@i we need
I can make two pieces like this maybe . 2580320_2582290
I think that what we need to do is, we can have part of that
here, well, let me see what you were doing again . 2582720_2601640
yeah, <we can> we can cut it sort of here, &=breath
put line where you want it to be cut . 2600790_2603040
I think we just wanna cut this little ridge off, here . 2603470_2618410
you know, kinda like this . 2603470_2618410
&=noise &=breath xxx &=laugh +//. 2603470_2618410
oh . 2610670_2611300
it is broken . 2617100_2618110
the egg is broken . 2619780_2620890
&=laugh . 2620680_2623330
&=laugh it was my fault, &=breath all my fault . 2621290_2628640
&=laugh at least it landed on the paper . 2621290_2628640
&=laugh . 2621290_2628640
&=laugh . 2621760_2622330
&=laugh . 2627930_2628880
well, our experiment &=laugh is over . 2628560_2630970
&=laugh . 2628560_2630970
we we can just erase the meeting &=laugh and do it again . 2631380_2633650
but I know it would've worked . 2634320_2635600
okay, uhm@fp hes@fp nobody has an egg ? 2634450_2639120
well, to summarize what we've done . 2636510_2639920
&=laugh . 2636510_2639920
&=laugh nobody has an egg for &=laugh lunch ? 2639230_2641420
uhm@fp what can we use ? 2641510_2643930
uhm@fp we +//. 2641890_2643140
we we can put the meeting on pause, and I can go run and get
&=laugh . 2643910_2648320
&=laugh . 2648150_2649300
which store, they don't have eggs at the Entropy . 2648430_2651180
no, uh@fp Craig, up on Forbes and Craig, it is like right down
oh . 2653280_2653930
yeah, but it is far . 2655800_2657350
<could we tur@i> &=breath well, it is too late, <the egg is>
&=laugh . 2657580_2661460
no, no, no, no, <it is> it is +//. 2659110_2660310
wait . 2660530_2669380
&=breath tape tape . 2660530_2669380
&=laugh &=breath <no we can put> oh, and then uh@fp now it is
&=laugh . 2664650_2665470
it is oozing, &=laugh I think it is dead . 2668970_2671230
here, put it in here . 2671460_2672660
yeah . 2673160_2675510
well uh@fp well, wr@i wrap it up in this stuff . 2673160_2675510
<I thought you said it wa@i> I thought she said it was a
no . 2680040_2683530
no, she told us to be careful 'cause it was raw . 2680040_2683530
oh . 2680760_2681370
no, no, no, she said it was not . 2681220_2682850
oh, &=smack okay . 2683610_2686400
yeah . 2683850_2684370
so . 2689070_2689880
nobody then has an egg ? 2690510_2703670
&=breath uhm@fp &=breath &=smack &=breath we can still do
well +//. 2699240_2699520
I think we ought to +//. 2701370_2702360
no, no, I I I think that what we ought to do is just put
and we can +//. 2703060_2708050
we can ? 2707420_2708040
sure . 2708640_2709190
no, we can't . 2708800_2709580
we can't . 2709320_2712440
we can stop it and then restart it, right ? 2709320_2712440
maybe we should just summarize what we were doing, and what
yeah, but it is all my fault . 2719280_2726140
I <I don't really wanna> &=laugh I don't wanna admit my
well, I I I I <I ru@i> <I ruined>
&=laugh . 2723610_2724420
do you want to summarize, Debb ? 2728130_2731450
it was your idea . 2728130_2731450
things happen . 2730440_2751550
&=laugh uh@fp the only thing that I can think of, w@i what we
&=breath during our +//. 2730440_2751550
construction . 2751550_2752570
construction &=laugh experimental stage of trying to figure out
yeah, okay, so +//. 2762380_2763680
we broke the balloon and the egg, but we we should
oh, okay . 2770720_2771440
so, we we had one cup, we had two Styrofoam cups . 2773380_2806880
we took one, &=breath sort of cut it in half . 2773380_2806880
uhm@fp we were gonna use one cup as the vessel to contain the egg,
use one part of it as a crate inside the first cup . 2773380_2806880
and then break up the other bits of Sytrofoam to make armor for
tape that inside with a cushion of tape on the bottom &=breath
and then we would've dropped it . 2773380_2806880
it would've been totally enc@i enc@i encapsulated and
&=smack &=breath unfortunately, our egg broke in the process of
and our experiment +//. 2773380_2806880
<a piece of> yes . 2781820_2783450
we got a hole in the balloon . 2805870_2809080
&=laugh . 2805870_2809080
right . 2807050_2810060
okay . 2807050_2810060
so, that is basically our summary . 2807050_2810060
