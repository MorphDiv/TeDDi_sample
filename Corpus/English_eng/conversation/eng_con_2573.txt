&-uh men's and women's work now are there any questions before I get started ? 228905_235105
okay ? 235645_236305
okay . 237085_238365
&-um now I just wanna remind you that we've just finished discussing men work and &-uh the &-uh presentation the slide tape presentation the computerized slide tape tape presentation &-uh that you saw &-uh did I think a very good job of linking cultural notions of masculinity to the changing experience of work for men . 239175_268135
what I wanna do today is give you an overview of women and work and although I'm less concerned about how their work experience had an impact on their notions of femininity what I &~a will be emphasizing is how cultural notions of womanhood determine women's work experience okay so it's a little bit different than &-uh men's &-uh sense of masculinity and how it was altered by their experience of work . 268585_298565
&-uh and we're more concerned now with how cultural notions of femininity proper femininity determined women's work experience . 308695_318415
now I wanna make some general &~mar remarks first &-uh some &~s &~s sort_of generalizations the first is that the tension between women's work and women's role in the family was present at the beginning of industrialization . 320495_338315
in a way that it had not been in the colonial period . 339175_342855
so that they the we we take for granted today that there's tension between women's role in the family and women's work lives . 343695_354435
many of us experience it either through our mothers or in own lives profoundly and if you don't experience it yet whether you're a man or a woman you're gonna experience it soon . 355055_367855
because it's still there it's there in very difficult ways okay ? 368965_372705
&-um and I will be talking a_lot about that &-uh later on . 373585_376985
but industrialization and what it did to the organization of family life really began that tension in ways that haven't been experienced before because it took men's work out_of the home and out_of the family and pulled some women increasingly more women into wage labor as well raising fears that &{l=SIC women's &}l=SIC work outside the home would alter her relationship with the family . 377705_407685
okay ? 408675_409055
and the notion that women were grounded in the family was already &~pre present in the colonial period but in much more flexible ways and in much more handleable ways since everybody's work was grounded in the family it wasn't so surprising that women's work was okay ? 409115_429075
second generalization which I think &-um I can make because I lived through it too is that Americans have generally &~invoi avoided desperately the implications of this for much of our history . 430345_445665
and although &~i occasionally when I lecture on maternalism for example and progressivism we'll talk about the little forays into dealing with the problem that &-um &~gov government made &-uh or the culture made but for the most part I think avoidance has been the main &-uh stance of &-um American culture &-uh up until the last thirty years . 446665_473145
and then we've been struggling with it because we didn't lay any groundwork for dealing with it before and that's a theme that I will be talking about in different ways from now until the end of the semester because it affects the family so profoundly . 473425_487765
and thirdly the third generalization that I wanna make is that the constraints of women's home responsibilities have typically and almost universally placed women at a disadvantage in the labor force . 489785_505845
it's not that &-uh you_know it's it's their connection with the family their link with home life their responsibilities in the family that have continually &-uh made them not equal participants &-uh &~a and I'm not just saying that they couldn't get into the work force who would want to be in the work force necessarily ? 506995_529315
but when they were forced to be in the work force they were always at a disadvantage because of the notion that women weren't really permanent workers they weren't really serious workers they didn't even need the money . 529705_543805
they were just there okay ? 544765_546565
and all of the reasons for that is because they were seen as nonworkers and we'll talk about that in a minute . 546805_554485
and &-uh their main job was that of the family so that we're faced with that structural problem of disadvantage . 554705_564465
and for the last thirty years we've been faced with it . 564985_568025
and I say we@q because the disadvantage of women most women are married and have children in this society so that the disadvantage of women in the workplace is also a disadvantage of families . 568185_581705
women who work hard and earn less bring less home to their families . 582015_587755
and so &-um the economic changes that have brought more and more women into the work force in the twentieth century especially middle+class women &-uh who tried to follow the ideology of domesticity and could not &-uh in the last thirty years &-uh &-uh these economic changes have been such that the need for women's wage earning has clashed with the inability of our society to deal with women large numbers of women in the labor force okay ? 588265_618245
so we're in a bind we have a crisis it will women will not the majority of women will not go back to the home . 623265_632645
okay ? 634425_634465
and when this economic boom ends I promise you that some of those women who are profoundly privileged now to still be able to stay at home and not have to go and work for wages they're +//. 634705_647985
some of them are gonna &~h have to go back into the work force as well . 648045_651445
or their daughters will . 652165_653185
okay ?
so as a society we have to figure out how to cope with that and also raise &-um healthy emotionally &-uh stable well loved and well nurtured children and have sane parents . 653905_670685
&-um and that's a problem that we haven't solved . 671645_673765
okay . 674365_674485
now let me start &-uh at the beginning or at least at an arbitrary place that I'll call the beginning . 675305_681985
women's work in &~pre in the preindustrial period . 682205_684445
very quickly going over some of the things I talked about &-uh regarding the colonial period now there was no &-um I mean because culture in some ways was up for grabs and institutions were up for grabs and relatively flexible in the colonial period as British and European culture was &-um transferred but then translated into the American context . 684955_714115
it was no longer dictated that women would necessarily be disadvantaged and couldn't have opportunities of social mobility in the New World . 716165_724985
but the two avenues to social mobility in the New World one was land ownership &-uh and the other was apprenticeship you know learning a trade learning a &-um &-uh <how to> how to be a craftsperson both of those were at least legally and officially barred to women . 725505_748045
it doesn't mean that women in some states weren't able to &~herit inherit land and hold on to it especially in the South where certain laws and &~cer during a certain period of openness did allow women to own own land but only &-um as widows &-uh or as &-um &-uh dowries . 748825_768305
and the legal system brought wives under the coverture the &-um auspices of their husbands and once women married they pretty much lost all their legal rights even their rights to their children . 768785_782365
in the colonial period those laws weren't changed until the middle of the nineteenth century . 782825_787465
&-uh and in terms of apprenticeship although there was a great deal of informal apprenticeship shoemakers and carpenters and other craftsmen very often &-uh taught their wives and their daughters their trade officially these women worked as part of the family economy . 788345_810425
and were not able essentially to be free actors and agents &-uh selling their own labor so that in the division of labor in the colonies the women did &-uh the bulk of the production &-uh in the family economy which included &-uh making food you know raw &~ma turning raw materials into food cloth candles soap making . 811105_841085
they took care of the farm animals they took care of the kitchen garden while husbands and sons did the plowing the planting the harvesting with women's participation when necessary . 842295_855235
&-um men sometimes helped at spinning and weaving when the farm work was slow in the winter months . 855495_863075
&-uh and women's work as I've already said was seen as &~effe essential to the family economy it was valued on a lower scale than men's . 863765_873465
but remember we're dealing with a hierarchical society that believed in the Great Chain of Being and men were at the top . 873665_881605
I_mean first came God then came the king and then came the heads of the families okay ? 881825_888185
fathers being the representative of the king in governance of the family that's why when children went bad in the colonial period it was the father who was blamed not the mother because he was responsible for not only his wife's behavior but everybody &-uh under him . 888375_907415
okay ? 908555_908755
&-uh but <so that> so that the notion that women's work was important lived next to the notion that women's work was important but of_course less important than men's . 909385_922045
so it shouldn't be too surprising that that unequal importance although I wanna emphasize the essentialness of women's labor in the home in the colonial period (be)cause that's something that gets lost in the nineteenth century &-uh in this translation to a new economic situation <&-uh so> &-uh so the notion that women's work is important but subordinate to men's explains part of what happens . 922465_950145
you know when merchant capitalism industrialization comes along and takes men's work out_of the home . 951305_959105
women's work &~m is reduced in the home the need for women's work is reduced in the home when that happens not all women's work the wife was still working from &~morn you know some +//. 959785_971425
from dawn (un)til dusk she's still doing all those chores . 971705_975045
but not as many of them as she needed to do before . 975725_979185
she can buy cloth she can purchase cloth now she can purchase bread she can purchase candles she can even purchase certain kinds of foodstuffs . 979545_997185
so that a_lot_of that original production which happened in the family is removed from the family and we begin to get a money economy &-uh remember surplus people are are producing for surplus and so the reduction for the need for women's labor occurs &~amon &~arou among &-um young unmarried women in the home who formed some of the early factory workers &-uh in the early stages of industrialization in New England .
and I think it's important to note that the factory there was an ideology of industrialization in the United States because it happened later than in England . 1027635_1038915
and the &-uh &~th &~th many had witnessed the degradation of labor and the degradation of families as whole families were pushed off the land the family impoverished and pulled into the factories . 1040355_1054595
there were children of five and six years old were working alongside their mothers and fathers in the factories the early ideology of &-um &-uh industrialization here said no this is not gonna happen here okay ? 1055095_1069835
and in many respects those early factories were seen as opportunities for poor families to make a living &-uh to bring in poor widows and children poor women so that they could make a living &-uh and there was &{l=SIC a &}l=SIC understanding a local understanding that these factory owners would take some responsibility for protecting workers from exploitation . 1070465_1100445
but the idea of protection broke down as the transition from a mercantilist state which took certain kinds of responsibilities for &~m the &~m the members of &-uh this state or the citizens of this state &-uh transitioned into the demands of free market capitalism which basically let the market determine what happened to people . 1102785_1131005
and so the &~e effects of the transition to wage labor for women were very complicated . 1131745_1138985
for younger daughters of New England farmers it initially meant an ability to continue to commit to the family economy to contribute to the family economy by being &~ex exposed to factory work in a new kind of way . 1139665_1154365
but the effects on these women who experienced this were mixed . 1155225_1160345
some of them were able to earn dowries and then marry middle or upwardly mobile young farm men on the make who were moving into the lower middle class by moving to cities taking jobs in this new economy . 1160985_1174885
others put their brothers through school so that their brothers could experience the social mobility that they did not . 1175595_1184055
and others were pushed down into the impoverished working class and hadta stay &-uh in this new permanent working class . 1184715_1195615
&-um it's also &-um true that some women probably experienced a measure of autonomy and freedom from family authority that they had not experienced before . 1196595_1209395
so we're beginning to see a certain detachment of &-um both &~adol adolescent boys and girls from the authority of family life as capitalism begins to pull both young men and young women into these new economic situations . 1209835_1229955
another important effect of wage work on all families was the drawing of sharper lines between affluent women who could afford not to work for wages and who could keep their daughters at home and those families who hadta send their daughters into the factories &~a or and sometimes took piecework into their homes or occasionally even hadta go into the factories themselves . 1232605_1262425
so with industrialization comes the emergence of classes and in the United States it's primarily the middle class and the working class .
and it's the middle class that it's is creating a new kind of culture to go along with this change in family structure . 1272905_1282245
where women and mothers stay at home with children and are given different kinds of tasks than the productive tasks of the subsistence family in the colonial period . 1282615_1297475
and I've already talked +//. 1297875_1298815
this is a review but I want you to &~u understand how it's very connected to women's work and to &-um to economic development this is where the emergence of the ideology of domesticity occurs . 1298675_1312635
the middle class essentially invented the ideology of domesticity to help them cope with some of the changes that were taking place in the economic realm . 1313335_1325335
and this is an ideology which dictates that middle+class women ladies respectable women whatever you wanna call them should stay at home and they should be doing housework for their families childcare and the whole notion of childcare expands &-uh the whole notion of childhood expands in this period and I will talk about the emergence of childhood as a life stage along with this family this new &~st family structure . 1325825_1355805
and <so that> &-um so that this new family ideal &-uh was held up as the proper family ideal for everybody . 1357665_1369385
it also meant that women who could not live up to this family ideal were denigrated . 1370645_1377125
they were seen as lazy &~shilf shiftless Irish which also meant drunk and Catholic &-um you know to Protestants we already talked about that &-uh irresponsible mothers <etcetera> etcetera mothers who hadta work were clearly inferior morally okay ? 1377355_1400235
here's the beginning of that notion of if you're poor there's something wrong with you okay ? 1400545_1407205
and it still exists in our society we assume that people are poor because they're lazy . 1407365_1413405
okay ? 1414305_1414425
and mothers who hadta go into the factory to work were simply degraded inefficient you know immoral . 1414685_1423265
okay ?
and you've read about this I suggest that you go &~f back and refer to this again in Christine Stansel's article Women Children and the Uses of the Streets which contrasts these new notions of middle+class mothering with the &-um experience of poor women who simply can't live up to &-uh the ideal . 1424085_1445525
so the wives of respectable artisans those on the top of the working class attempted to imitate this life as well . 1446065_1454085
and we see those artisans you know the top echelons of the working class managing for the most part to keep their wives at home now those wives may have helped a great deal in the &-uh work and some of the daughters may have helped a great deal in the shops in the shoe making shop &-uh shops which were in located in the home during this period &-uh for a while . 1454505_1480945
&-uh until the the shoe factories came in the eighteen forties and fifties and sixties &-um and certainly by the end of the Civil War . 1481465_1489865
xxx but they managed to retain a certain amount of respectability . 1490785_1495285
for free blacks who didn't have the economic wherewithal for the merst most part although there was a segment of the black middle class in the North who tried very hard to live up to this ideal . 1496305_1508385
but for most free blacks for immigrants the Irish and then immigrants who came in at the end of the century in the eighteen eighties for widows for those who were pushed off their &-uh increasingly impoverished farms by agricultural capitalism &-uh factory work became &~common commonplace . 1508905_1528885
and about ten percent of women in this period up until the eighteen eighties of all women worked for wages outside the home . 1529305_1539185
now I wanna talk about something else which has carried over to our attitudes about women's work today . 1540425_1548345
and that's what happened to married women's work in the home in a wage labor economy . 1548805_1557225
the most significant fact I think &-um that we need to be aware of in these changes is the denial the gradual denial of the economic worth of housework . 1557825_1570105
housework anything that falls under the rubric of housework is still not factored into the American gross national product . 1570845_1580025
in other words it's not considered work it's not considered productive labor it doesn't &~d it it is assumed that it doesn't do anything economically . 1580705_1591245
and yet +//. 1592205_1592585
and so recent historical studies have shown the way this process occurred with the emergence of industrialization in which the gradual meaning of work and the definition of work changed from labor in the household performed by everybody to &{l=SIC waged &}l=SIC labor labor in which wages for which wages were paid outside the home . 1592625_1621065
so that gradually the notion of women's work sort_of gets erased it's not paid labor in the home . 1622165_1630345
and so it no longer is considered work . 1630965_1635045
and this is &-uh &~th so that you &~d do not see anymore by the eighteen forties and fifties a recognition of either the middle+class wife's economic role in the household or the working class wife's economic role in the household . 1635545_1654945
we begin to see elaborate +//. 1655465_1657325
&-uh the development of elaborate cash economy in the early nineteenth century and all through the nineteenth century the emphasis on growing competition among males for wages and for property &-uh which enhances the importance of money and money becomes the primary measure of social and &~ec economic worth . 1657505_1681685
so that all wives who stayed at home continued to produce an enormous amount if it was only to produce the children who would then or the sons who would take their place in the wage economy . 1681785_1694825
to produce food to dress their husbands to &-um to feed their families there &~w to take care of children to do all the things necessary to allow the men in the family to function as workers and everybody understood through &-uh folk mythology that if you didn't have a wife you weren't fully a man . 1695705_1719465
if you weren't a breadwinner who had a wife and child to show for it you were not a man . 1720425_1728405
you were not an adult man and yet the &-uh idea of how the wife allowed the breadwinner to function in the work world was hidden and obscured . 1728825_1742325
but we still see &-um &-uh an extraordinary amount of work being performed both by middle+class and working class women . 1742705_1751405
their labor at herm home was &-uh subsumed under &-uh child care and household management if you were middle class and increasingly for middle+class women that meant consumption . 1752065_1766745
it meant becoming the purchasing agents for this little family economy . 1767105_1772925
&-uh but it also meant cooking cleaning baking seeing to the family's &-uh provision of vegetables whether or not you were growing for yourself or purchasing it at market &-um so the cultural invisibility of the value the economic value of wives' work emerged in this period . 1773545_1798025
and for working class women it was extremely important they didn't have &-uh the opportunity just to manage servants &-uh consume &-uh take care of children and help to create this new life stage of middle+class childhood . 1798585_1816185
&-um working class women as you &-uh learned from reading Christine Stansel's article whether they were working in the factories or not contributed up to three hundred dollars &-uh of the family economy through scavenging for food in cities finding discarded clothing &~hou making household implements &-uh picking up fuel by going around &-uh you_know to &-um &-uh keeping &-uh &-uh conversant of the transportation of coal and picking up coal at on the streets . 1817025_1847005
how many of you saw what's the name of that Irish movie Angela's Ashes ? 1855625_1860845
do you remember when they when the father left and the whole the mother and the children were out there picking up coal from the streets ? 1861505_1870865
that is the classic it is a classic working class family task mother and children . 1872445_1878885
&-um you know all &~i taking in &-uh certain kinds of piecework which was available to working class women . 1879665_1887005
&-um the &~t for immigrants later on taking in boarders &-um &~al all sorts of ways in which working class &~wil women &-uh contributed roughly a hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a year to a working class economy at a time when if a family didn't make eight hundred dollars a year a family of four it could not sustain itself . 1887465_1910625
so that's almost a third or maybe it is a third up to a third of you know family income was provided by this hidden nonwage labor that working class &-uh women performed . 1910625_1924525
and of_course &-uh although middle+class women performed their work in a more comfortable setting they were also working hard long hours and performing essential labor . 1924705_1937025
in order for their men and their sons to participate as breadwinners in this economy . 1937825_1944185
and this notion that if women are home they don't work has pervaded our assumptions about family life in the twentieth century . 1944925_1954965
now &~ab in nineteen eighty eight &-uh when there was a_lot_of change going on the divorce rate was going up in the nineteen seventies and eighties . 1955605_1965765
and the divorce &-uh law was still you_know sort_of tied to notions of family life from the end of the nineteenth century . 1966345_1975145
and a divorce lawyer who wound up representing a_lot_of housewives who had given twenty five years of their life to you know sort_of sustaining &-uh families raising children and supporting husbands so that they could be breadwinners and then were basically thrown out on their ears and expected at the age of forty to find some way of earning wages . 1975825_1999565
and their you_know main work had been facilitating the lives of others , &-uh this lawyer &-um &-uh wound up &~bein representing a_lot_of these women and finally &-uh wrote a book called What Is A Wife Worth ? 2000125_2015945
this was in nineteen eighty eight . 2016105_2017665
&-um and &-uh he &-um at the time he &-uh argued +//. 2018405_2024505
and <this is> this also gives you a sense of how much inflation &-uh <had happened> &-uh has happened &-uh from nineteen eighty eight to the present . 2024565_2033585
at the time he argued that if you paid somebody an hourly wage to do what &-uh women did in the home childcare laundry cleaning &-uh transportation for children meeting with teachers &-uh you_know childcare all this stuff that basically you would have to pay a wife &-uh roughly thirty five thousand dollars a year &-uh if you farmed out the tasks that wives do for free . 2034385_2064365
in nineteen ninety four I heard an interview with this very same lawyer &-um on NPR . 2065865_2073005
&-uh <and he> &-uh the &~f the economy had changed and so now and of_course <this is> &~a this is a &~o an old statistic . 2074185_2082285
but he updated the worth of these tasks and in nineteen ninety four a wife <would have> would have needed to be paid sixty two thousand dollars a year &-uh in order to &-um pay for the tasks that women who stay at home perform for the family . 2082345_2103405
and along with this hidden you know sort_of notion of the fact that this isn't work our society assumes that women who stay at home &-uh with children are just playing cards and coffeeklatching@n$part all day . 2103905_2120585
&-uh so there's this sort_of denigration &-uh this notion of you know when they have time they just go out and shop (un)til they drop &-uh that kind of stuff . 2121365_2130505
I mean the way in which our &~s society both says that you know if you're a respectable and a caring mother you have to stay home with your children but then dumps on them for making that choice because they're lazy and they don't really do anything I mean it's really a schizophrenic &-uh attitude towards women . 2130685_2148925
and <I remember> I remember when I was and this was before feminism I was not you know in college when feminism had emerged I was already out_of college I had just about finished graduate school . 2149345_2161565
and we used to &-uh we I you know at parties when you were introducing yourself to somebody blah blah blah you know &~w well we used to ask questions like well what did your father do ? 2162105_2174505
what did your mother do ? 2174725_2176125
did your mother work ? 2176505_2177605
and you know the answer if you were middle class was no . 2178525_2181245
she didn't work . 2181685_2182365
even though my mother did not work for wages outside of the home I was lucky she she worked all the time I mean she was never I never saw her sitting down I never saw her she was facilitating everybody in the world I mean that was what <she did> she did a pretty good job of it and &-uh you know at the end of the day she was exhausted . 2183195_2206275
&-uh think about &-um &-uh women in the work force now who have to do both those things talk about exhaustion . 2207115_2215195
for God's sake . 2215595_2216395
&-um but we'll get to that later on . 2217015_2219035
okay so this is the moment in which housework and all the complicated &-uh things that women do to facilitate the functioning of the economy you know the gross national product got hidden and denigrated . 2220295_2241475
okay . 2242035_2242135
so to summarize by the end of the Civil War the patterns of women's work were set really up until the end of World War Two . 2242845_2252225
working women were a relatively small proportion of workers because the ideal was if you were a real true man you could keep your wife at home . 2252945_2262805
and so that even labor you know labor unions when they demanded a family wage we will come into &-uh discussing the meaning of the family wage again you'll be reading about it what that meant was to be paid enough to keep their wives at home just like middle+class men could keep their wives at home that was the dominant notion of masculinity and of being a breadwinner . 2263635_2289395
so that &-uh the women who worked were the women who hadta work and between ten to fifteen percent of all women worked <in the> &~u in the &~eigh by eighteen eighty for wages outside the home . 2289885_2305465
and that &-uh number went up to about twenty percent by World War Two and then shot up to almost double that &-um by &-uh the end of World War Two . 2306165_2319025
okay World War One twenty percent almost double that by the end of World War Two . 2319525_2323865
when women did work outside the home the only excuse that they were allowed to have otherwise they were totally degraded and unrespectable was that they were working for family means . 2324635_2340755
okay ? 2341355_2341495
the idea that you might enjoy work or that it might give you certain amount of autonomy from your family and &~in independence not an excuse those kind of women were considered promiscuous and stepping out_of bounds . 2342995_2358275
so wage work for women became primarily for immigrant women for poor women for the desperately poor widows . 2358815_2368555
and there were a_lot_of them because there was no workmen's compensation in this period of industrialization and a_lot_of men were injured or &~w &~w &-uh women whose husbands were injured and could no longer work . 2368635_2381115
but in spite of these patterns industrialization gradually continued because of the technology to expand the opportunities for women to work <and more> and more women needed to work . 2381615_2395275
there were a number of changes that took place that facilitated that . 2395745_2399385
first technology continued to streamline factory work in ways that allowed industrialists to hire cheap women's labor in different factories because of you know increasing technology which didn't require the kind of brute strength that men had &-um &~a by the end of the century employers loved being able to hire women because &~the they could pay them half the wages of men . 2399985_2429965
&-uh and the assumption that &~w &-uh it was fine to pay women half the wages of men was based on this notion of proper womanhood . 2432715_2442995
even though people &-uh denigrated women unless they were working for their family employers argued that women who worked were really under the protection of men and were just working for pin money . 2443975_2458015
so <you got> you got it either way if you were a working &{l=SIC women &}l=SIC &-uh &~wo woman employers paid you half the wages of men because the assumption was that you were only working for supplementary wages . 2458755_2471715
and &-uh if you were in the work force at all you were suspect because you hadta prove that you were helping a family if you were a widow God help you . 2473715_2484335
okay ? 2484995_2485335
&-um so so &-uh &~e employers were delighted and recruited women wherever they could and the other thing that happens with technology at the end of the eighteen eighties is that a new work force of pink collar labor emerges with the emergence of typewriters for example . 2486395_2510295
&~type typewriters originally &-uh clerks and secretaries were &-uh that was an originally a male occupation and the assumption was that most secretaries male secretaries would move into &-uh &-uh important positions of authority in these independent own businesses . 2513405_2535365
but once these larger corporations came along with the you_know these large numbers of of employees like you saw in the slide tape presentation &-uh and men were no longer self-employed and didn't have just one secretary who would inherit the business people discovered that being a secretary and typing out &-um letters was a dead end job which didn't hafta &-uh include &-uh mobility up &-uh the scale . 2535925_2564925
and so it became a feminized occupation . 2564965_2568245
and so a_lot_of women after eighteen eighty began &-uh seeking out office work and another &-um &-uh popular &-uh occupation was &-uh department store work sales women working women who &-um enjoyed &-uh +//. 2569005_2586865
they were paid less than factory workers sometimes but at least it wasn't dirty . 2587005_2591625
you weren't quite as exposed to sexual harassment although you were but not quite as much in the same way . 2592045_2598385
&-um and so we begin to see technology moving more of &-uh young unmarried working class women into other kinds of work secretarial work department store work and factory work as well . 2599185_2614425
and <you're gonna be reading about> &-uh &-uh you'll be reading an article by Kathy Heiss which will talk about this new cultural world for women workers that emerges . 2614565_2626385
a second &-uh stimulus on &-uh women going into the work force at the end of the nineteenth century was the increasing number of affluent households of the middle class which were able to relegate more and more domestic work to machinery and therefore didn't need &-uh &~th &-uh to &-um require these light chores from some daughters who were waiting at home to get married . 2628305_2655125
and many of these young daughters began to continue to go through school (un)til high school and then to college . 2655725_2664025
and so we see a real &-uh change by the eighteen seventies &~a and eighties in which women's colleges are founded and drawing more and more young unmarried affluent women into college educations . 2664365_2679805
and what happened to some of those daughters ? 2680365_2682165
some very important things happened and I'll speak about it again in another context is once those women received equal &~educa college educations with some of the men +//. 2682275_2692815
most men were not going to college then . 2693075_2694855
they were going into business and making it . 2695235_2697755
&-uh part of the reason some of these big universities like the University of Michigan which admitted women in eighteen seventy were interested in having women is (be)cause they couldn't get enough young men to sustain their operating costs . 2698105_2710805
and so they began to draw on middle+class women but these women who came out_of college with educations were sort_of ruined for &-um or at least partially ruined for being able to go back into that Victorian &-uh family in which they were required to become &-uh you_know sort_of homebodies and primarily child rearers and &~m &~s many of these women began to seek employment for &~themte selves that would satisfy some emotional needs &-uh to use their education . 2711545_2741525
and in_order_to do that they hadta invent a whole range of new occupations . 2749385_2755585
and so we see many of these college educated women becoming factory inspectors . 2756045_2761505
health inspectors in factories . 2762305_2763765
&-um they become social workers . 2764785_2767125
as the occupation of social work is stimulated by the horrible degradation that families working class families they're experiencing industrialization . 2767585_2779645
and the old reform impulse the women reformers who'd begun to critique capitalist society in the eighteen thirties and forties and fifties . 2780645_2790745
a new generation of women reformers now college educated begin to create the social welfare occupations that will address the absolute &-um horrors of this new industrial state so they become social workers . 2791325_2810825
they become visiting nurses who go into the homes of the poor and try and help them with issues of health truant officers jobs taking jobs in bureaus of labor statistics in state and federal governments personnel officers they begin entering graduate programs . 2811395_2831135
they'd already begun entering medical schools already by the eighteen fifties &-uh &~som some women and law school becomes increasingly more attractive too so that by the nineteen twenties you get a significant minority at least an equal minority of women &-uh about five percent studying law as there were &-uh women studying medicine but it happened in medicine much earlier you think there weren't any women doctors (un)til the nineteen sixties right ? 2832765_2862745
you're wrong . 2864345_2865225
there were the same percentage of the women physicians in nineteen hundred as there were in nineteen sixty so women actually entered the medical profession in the nineteenth century . 2865605_2875805
but anyway these educated women began to manipulate the ideology of woman's sphere the ideology that women were responsible for raising good children &-uh preserving the morals of society seeing to it that industrialization doesn't destroy the decency of Christian civilization . 2877945_2900005
they began to take these notions very seriously and as they did even earlier in their involvement in abolition and other kinds of reform movements temperance in the eighteen thirties and forties at the end of the nineteenth century they began to critique government both state and the federal government for not putting in place social welfare programs . 2900475_2926375
and I will discuss that &-uh when I talk about maternalism and the invention of the social welfare state . 2926385_2933925
but these educated women really helped to invent the social welfare state at least the institutions that were eventually coopted by the social welfare state in the early twentieth century . 2934465_2947505
now one of the things that many of these women reformers did especially &-uh a large group of women who were studying sociology &-uh and political science at the University of Chicago &-uh and were involved in the founding of Hull House how many of you have heard of Jane Adams and Hull House ? 2948625_2970265
okay Jane Adams was one of those college educated women who didn't know what to do with her life and she was so confused after getting a really good education and feeling on the one hand that she needed to commit to this sort_of relatively idle life of an unmarried daughter until she got married and started her &~o &~mof own family . 2970395_2992375
&-uh and she was not interested in marriage not profoundly interested in men . 2993255_2997355
she actually &-uh later in life became a lesbian . 2997545_3001165
&-uh but the fact of the matter is that Jane Adams wanted desperately to use her education to improve society . 3001845_3009965
and she had a breakdown after college in the eighteen eighties because of this horrible choice that she felt she had a_lot_of pressure from her family to come home and she felt a_lot_of inner pressure to do something meaningful . 3010605_3024605
and that's how she finally went to Chicago and established Hull House which was one of the model settlement houses to deal with immigrant &-uh workers . 3025025_3034945
and the University of Chicago which had been founded in the early &-uh eighteen nineties had an extraordinary vibrant young faculty of &-uh &-uh WI Thomas John Dewey and a number of scholars who taught the first generation of women sociologists and psychologists . 3035585_3055245
and and in many respects Hull House was a proving ground and a &~ler a learning laboratory for those academics as they invented modern sociology and &-um you know these these &-uh new occupations that would eventually be part of the welfare state . 3055825_3076065
now one of the most important issues on their agenda was protective legislation for women . 3076305_3083205
and &-um so that one of the &-uh &-uh things that women reformers along with &-um others who were &-um supportive of bolstering labor's position vis_a_vis &-uh the &-uh &-um &-uh &-uh industry &-uh &~th &~m the idea that women needed &~re to be protected if they were gonna work in factories otherwise their bodies would be damaged for reproduction . 3084265_3112385
and so protective legislation was a very very complicated issue . 3113265_3119385
it's very interesting that some of the most radical women who were interested in socialism did not want protective legislation specifically for women they wanted protective legislation for all workers men and women . 3120045_3135545
because the understanding was that if women were protected they would continue to be only women were protected they would continue to be disadvantaged in the work force vis_a_vis men . 3135755_3148435
but in the end protective legislation was passed first by the states &-uh individually and then eventually &-um bolstered by the federal government and the debate over protective legislation &-uh that historians &-um have been carrying on ever since the progressive period still goes on . 3148985_3171205
and now the fact of the matter is that we believe that protective legislation did improve &-uh the work situation for a_lot_of women in the factories during this period . 3171585_3183365
they were given breaks they were factory owners were forced to establish women's &-um &-uh washrooms &-uh they were barred from certain kinds of labor night work for example which it was thought mothers shouldn't be doing they should be home taking care of their children <&-um and> &-um and &-uh in the end what protective legislation accomplished was very very complicated and mostly negative . 3183895_3212915
it helped women at the immediate moment when they needed it . 3213665_3217705
but the fact that men weren't protected also drove many women workers out_of industries when +//. 3218125_3225165
where &-um employers ceased to hire women because it was too costly to institute &-um the kinds of protections that were needed women who were barred from night work &-uh for example . 3225785_3238365
there was a large contingent of women a large percentage of women working in the printing industry . 3238335_3245715
and much of the printing industry went on at night because the bulk of the printing industry's work was newspapers . 3246275_3253775
women were essentially &~m &-uh barred from the printing industry and lost a very very lucative lucrative and fairly decent paying niche in industry . 3254175_3267815
also in a number of leisure industries bowling for example and amusement parks where women were being hired at fairly decent wages but which required night work . 3268635_3279155
&-um women lost out there too and were unable to &-uh make gains because in many states those industries were protected also this was particularly difficult for &~w widows single mothers who liked to work at night so that they could be around for their children during the day . 3279745_3298325
so what we see happening in the long term with the institution of protective legislation for women is that it was based on the notion that women are weaker than men that women need a certain kind of special handling within industry &-uh and instead of equalizing the work experience for all men and by the way in Europe the labor unions for the most part rejected protective legislation for women . 3298825_3328805
they were not they understood the implications and they understood the ways in which it would reinforce the inequality of women in competition with men and so the labor unions which were much stronger in Europe during this period I'm talking of France Germany England Italy &-um &-uh for the most part insisted on protective legislation for all +... 3332115_3359295
there's been a_lot_of debate among historians over whether entering the work force was an emancipatory experience for women or whether in many respects it reinforced their sense of &-um second class citizenship . 3362515_3379695
and &-um many I think historians want to argue that the experience of entering the labor force did offer a certain &~for form of autonomy and agency to women who seemed to have more control over their lives and certainly Kathy Pize's article argues that women were agents and in control of their leisure time and understood how to negotiate &-uh things that they needed . 3380625_3410605
on the other hand I tend to side and you guys have to make your own decision about this I tend to side with the people who're skeptical the historians who're skeptical about how profoundly emancipatory &-uh working class women's work experience was &-uh during this period and well into the nineteen fifties . 3411505_3434305
women were paid less than men . 3434885_3437165
their second class citizenship was constantly reinforced . 3437315_3441935
it seems to me that the work culture &-uh which &-uh dictated to young women that the best thing would be to get married and get out_of the work force +... 3442695_3451875
&-uh the &-um &~s the way they were treated at work &-um often &-uh sexually harassed &-um all of these low wages the &-uh impossibility sometimes of being able to make it on their own having to live together because of the low wages +... 3452685_3471985
the idea that marriage was a cushion from abject poverty and &-uh the low self-esteem +... 3472845_3479425
it seems to me being placed in the lowest and dirtiest jobs hasta have had an effect on &-uh working class women . 3479605_3488245
and I would argue that it's one of the reasons why I think working class women were relatively slow to respond to feminism when it began to articulate &-uh some of the needs of working women in the nineteen sixties because working class women hated their jobs for the most part and derived most of their emotional satisfaction and &~f meaning in their lives from family . 3488565_3514565
&-uh to the degree that they could . 3534985_3545065
and so the notion that &-um they should be out in the work force &-uh given what the experience of work was for women up until the nineteen seventies when &-uh &-uh equal &~l legislation &-uh was put on the books nationally to reduce the &~d discrimination of women in the work force both of &~wag in terms of wages and other experiences +...
it seems to me that until <you are> &-uh you are treated decently on the job working outside the home isn't always about independence . 3545365_3557065
it's also it can often be &-uh about being beaten down as well . 3557365_3561765
now I wanna &-uh to &-uh move to the period between &-uh World War One and the present . 3562405_3568645
and make some &-uh large generalizations about women's work during that period +... 3569305_3574405
&-um the nineteen twenties was a &~m a period in which the more afflicant affluent group of women who &-um entered the work force in these new pink collar jobs continued to enter the work force . 3575565_3594245
and there was an expanding job market for clerical and secretarial work in the professions and interestingly enough in the nineteen twenties because of that we begin to see in the women's magazines and some of the more progressive magazines a discussion for the first time about how women would balance work and family . 3594655_3618495
and the notion of balancing work and family how long should women work ? 3619375_3623495
can women work after they get married ? 3623835_3625615
can women work outside the home when their children are young ? 3625995_3629255
these were &-uh issues that were raised in the nineteen twenties and economists by the nineteen twenties were also arguing that for a certain segment of the population wage work for women was going to exist forever . 3629715_3646475
so already by the nineteen twenties the situation the pieces were in place to discuss what to do about the large numbers of women in the work force twenty percent and how to balance family life and work responsibilities . 3646855_3663415
but unfortunately the Depression put an end to that public debate . 3664075_3668655
and the &-uh reaction in the Depression against women working was swift and ironic . 3669375_3678635
married women were fired all over the place from government jobs from any other jobs a_lot_of women hadta hide the fact that they were married in_order_to keep working even though many of them were the sole supporters of their family . 3679855_3693275
ironically however the numbers of women working during the Depression did not go down because they &{l=SIC weren't &}l=SIC at the dirtiest and low paying jobs which men wouldn't take . 3693965_3707465
and so we +//. 3708445_3709405
because of the way in which protective legislation helped segregate the work market the labor force men and women were not competing in the work force and so in the Depression although women did lose their jobs they didn't lose their jobs in the same ways that &~m men did because they were &~tie service jobs that were needed in spite of the breakdown of the economy . 3709505_3738305
and this is when between &-uh a fourth and a fifth of the labor male labor force was unemployed . 3740465_3745905
now during World War Two and we'll be seeing a wonderful movie &-uh about this Rosie the Riveter the opposite happened with large numbers of men leaving home there was an extraordinary labor shortage especially in the economy gearing up for war . 3746685_3763885
and so government propaganda was produced to get as many women including married women into the work force as possible and you'll see some of this government propaganda when &-uh we show the movie Rosie the Riveter . 3764325_3778865
but during World War Two as a result women made some dramatic &-uh gains and black women as well were able to move out_of low paying &-uh cleaning jobs into factory work &-uh <which was> which was much better paid . 3779325_3798085
now what's interesting about that period is although the government profoundly committed for five years to getting women into the work force they did not commit to supporting women with childcare and other kinds of &-uh supports that would help women stay in the work force . 3798845_3818885
and so that a_lot_of women went into the work force unsure of how to manage childcare . 3819125_3824285
many of them were absent . 3824945_3826085
there was a very high absentee rate &-uh because there were no stores that were open after they came home from work to shop . 3826145_3833105
and the ability to coordinate the needs of working women something that happened in England which you know stores were kept open until late at night childcare was provided for &-uh the understanding that if you're gonna have married women with children in the work force you have to help them continue to take care of their families , that didn't go over here so well . 3833485_3856545
and although there was some discussion some factories did attach childcare &{l=SIC centered &}l=SIC for the most part there was very little response to the needs of working women once they were gotten into the work force yeah ? 3856885_3870285
I just wondered if there was like an increase in possibly older women who couldn't work in the factories did they go into childcare &~pr childcare providing because of this shortage ? 3870465_3880665
no there was no coordination of need and knowledge you really do need to do that you know in a systematic way and either local government state government or federal government hasta &-uh you_know &~g get in and coordinate that and there were no funds for thinking creatively about that at all . 3881005_3900225
