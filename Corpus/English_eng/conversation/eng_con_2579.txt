there's just one handout today on the lecture and the exam's coming up Wednesday &-uh do you have any questions coming up on the exam ? 5475_14515
the review will be tonight &-uh bring questions to the review (be)cause you'll really generate &-uh you know what information is given out . 14695_23195
so do that &-uh go over your study questions that you got . 23795_28955
there's there's example exams on the web or on the web page for two eighty one . 29175_34895
and &-uh I looked over the the first exam and this the population stuff is on there . 35635_42495
but there's a foraging problem and obviously we haven't talked about foraging so don't worry about things that we haven't discussed at all . 42795_49175
so any questions <coming up> ? 50755_53775
everyone's .
is the exam is in this building ?
exam will be here in this room at this time and &-uh you'll be handed out the exam that you write on so you don't need to bring &-uh books or anything no calculators . 55095_68395
be no need for calculators you can just show all your work and &-uh so no calculators yeah ? 69355_80095
is today's lecture on the exam ?
&=sneezing:SU .
I'm sorry what ?
is today's lecture on the exam ?
&-uh oh . 81635_81855
good question I'm sorry it is not on the exam . 81935_84715
okay ?
it will include up to last Wednesday's lecture . 85675_88335
good questions . 88935_89575
(0.4) but this will be on the next exam . 91455_94175
do you have any of the handouts that are outside your office xxx .
oh &-uh I don't . 95275_101855
if there we're missing some handouts that people need I guess the best thing is to tell me or email me and I could try to xerox some more but I don't . 102315_110655
&-um they're all there outside the door . 110815_112275
basically .
but if we're missing something I could try to replace them .
or you could get them you know maybe from somebody xxx okay so everyone's all set ? 112875_122755
for Wednesday ?
okay well today I'm going to talk about population regulation . 126565_130805
we've been talking about populations demography life histories . 131945_135965
and &-uh when I talk about population growth I showed you &-uh this figure where if we look at the patterns of population growth for different species &-uh we find in some cases we do get a nice logistic pattern where we have the model that fit very nice where the species grows to a carrying capacity and then settles down around this equilibrium . 137375_160115
but more often what we see are populations that fluctuate but around some sorta K value or at least some &-uh asymptote here . 160775_170915
and the populations fluctuate within bounds . 171575_174495
and this is what we mean by regulation . 175995_179415
that is there's some factor that's causing the population to stay within bounds rather than completely crashing and going extinct or going into exponential growth &-uh indefinitely . 180615_192555
and &-uh we saw this then in the logistic equation our population increases up to this K and stays there . 193835_205135
and if the population &-uh for some reason goes above K then our little density dependent term will become negative and it'll start going down if it's below K this'll be positive and growth will &~pu put it back up to K . 205645_221025
so we have an equilibrium then . 221905_223905
(0.6) and this equilibrium in the density &-uh &~th or the density dependence in our logistic equation is due to +... 230085_239865
this density dependence is due to what ? 242365_245105
or what do we assume it's due to ? 246365_249285
it's in our models we just kind_of assume I said the models should &-uh &=noise_disturbance supply a logically reasonable parameters well they assume it's due to intraspecific competition . 250685_259825
for resources . 261325_262465
that is what slows the growth . 263925_266365
and keeps it around K and it becomes relatively more intense as you get near K . 267205_273705
so and this is why we have what we call K selection too . 275865_278705
but &-uh today what we're going to talk about is that other factors can also act in a density dependent manner and this is when we start looking at species interactions . 279665_292365
for example you could also have like predation or predators acting in a density dependent manner . 293285_299905
that is as the population reaches +//. 300325_302525
is +//.
gets more and more abundant it may be easier for predators to find the prey they might eat more of them and so it gets proportionately greater &-uh as a density dependent factor . 302965_314405
we could also have interspecific competition that is between two species that becomes more intense as they reach their carrying capacity or you could have things like disease or parasites that could all act as density dependent factors . 314945_332365
now they don't necessarily act as density dependent factors but these are biotic interactions that could show this density dependence . 333505_341305
and then they could set the population at some other K I think I gave you a little K a saturation K level +... 343145_351385
so .
and &-uh to remind you this density dependence occurs because either our birth rate or our death rate is going to change as the density or the numbers change . 355625_368585
and so for a population to slow down as it grows larger what hasta happen to birth rate ? 369265_374925
it hasta go down right ? 376365_379245
so we have the birth rate declining and and or the death rate may increase as the population goes up and that's what will cause the population to &-uh stabilize and what is this point right here ? 379505_396285
⌈ zero growth ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ birth equals ⌋ death it'll be K . 403865_404165
at zero population growth . 405005_406405
that's when the population stabilizes right ? 407485_409645
⌈ it's right here ⌉ .
+, (0.5) so this is what we call a density dependent relationship of birth rate or death rate or both . 412085_420265
now this is in contrast to what is called density independent +... 421305_425185
relationship and this would be where our rate either birth or death shows no relationship to density . 428245_434265
(o)kay ?
it's neither negative or positive and it may just be kind of variable around this line . 436165_440445
okay ?
so that's density independent . 441165_443825
and &-uh when we have density independent factors which I mentioned in the &-uh &-uh lecture on life histories what we see is a population so if it's density independent factors the population N over time you'll go +//. 446255_464575
the population may go into exponential growth and then it might get hit by some catastrophe like a flood or blizzard or whatever then it might decrease and then it'll start going into exponential growth again . 464615_476215
it may get knocked down by a bad summer and then it may go into exponential growth . 476655_481395
and so you end up with a pattern like this rather than what we see with the logistic where it stabilizes around some carrying capacity . 481595_490675
so this is where we have R selection right ? 491815_494015
and the important thing &~t here to realize is this density independent factor will determine the population so we have determination of population but there's no regulation . 494455_510055
(0.4) so regulation is something that keeps the population within some bounds . 511315_517615
(0.7) now there's another interesting &-uh density dependence that we can find and that has been found and this is where we have our birth or death rate and let's just look at birth rate and what happens is we have inverse density dependence +... 524735_541495
and by this we mean that as the population is small gets smaller the birth rate actually declines . 542455_552555
so <this is> the birth rate . 554665_555705
and then at some critical threshold point (0.6) the regular density dependence will kick in and it will decline as the population gets larger . 556185_570725
so this is our regular &-uh density dependence that we think about in &-uh stabilizing population growth but you can have this kind of inverse density dependence and this is called the Allee effect . 571675_586675
named after Allee who first described this . 587895_592215
so what's the problem with this ? 593255_594755
well if the population gets &~stro as it gets smaller as the birth rate starts declining what's gonna happen to the population ? 596345_602265
(0.4) it's likely to go extinct right ? 603545_607185
so this is a real concern this could also be death rate too where death rate increases as the population gets smaller . 607465_614785
so there's a problem +//. 615585_616825
&~pop &-uh possibility of extinction local extinction of this population . 617505_621925
and so this is of great concern to conservation biologists . 622495_625695
if you find this effect and how could this happen ? 626575_629695
well it could be as the population gets smaller it's harder to find mates . 630155_634175
and as a result reproduction declines . 635175_637055
or you could have species that are group hunters like lions where they hunt together and they're more successful if they hunt together . 637595_643835
if there are too few they may be unsuccessful in hunting and death rate could increase birth rate could decline as this population gets smaller . 644175_652695
and also &-uh some organisms really depend on large groups for some kind of social behavior . 653455_658215
like the passenger pigeons . 658795_659755
when they reach a certain size smaller &~s size of population they're just &-uh they didn't &-uh mate and &-uh reproduce . 660215_667595
so their social behavior was disrupted . 668235_671315
and so this effect is of great concern and it has been found in fact &-uh in certain species . 672895_680695
so what we're very interested in here then is regulation that will stabilize the population . 681695_689135
in contrast to this Allee effect where this destabilizes . 690475_695195
at low population . 695655_696635
or density independence where we don't have this regulation we just have determination . 697335_702355
(0.6) now in thinking about regulation we have some &~stabl stability but it can fluctuate within bounds . 706255_714655
what is very fascinating to population biologists is that you can have this fluctuations or &-uh within bounds but they form cycles which are regular oscillations or fluctuations over time . 716505_731305
and &-uh <this has been found> this pattern of cycles has been found in many species . 732685_737885
&-uh this is on your handout . 738485_739625
and here's &~an a a caterpillar a pine looper . 740485_742985
&-uh and you can see we have these fluctuations but it turns out they are in a a pattern &-uh where we have peaks what about every ten years . 743745_754565
okay ? 755465_755485
and lows about every ten years . 755825_758045
here are voles and these are small like mouselike &-um mammals and &-uh here they have &-uh cycles where the peak and the trough is is like every three to four years you have a peak population . 758715_774195
and then &-uh also red grouse here's an a bird and here we have peaks that occur like every four to eight years and finally the classic snowshoe hare which you've probably all been introduced to where the population of snowshoe hares peaks about every &-uh eight well nine to ten years . 775465_793985
so these patterns then as I told you in one of the first lectures is that really we hafta look for patterns and when we see these patterns they demand explanation so how can we explain these population cycles ? 795785_808945
and &-uh these species have &~acq garnered a_lot_of attention because people really want to understand why do you get cycles ? 809625_817285
why don't we get the stability at just one &-um &-uh value . 817425_823505
and it is interesting that most of the cycles that we see in species do occur in very simple environments particularly in the boreal forest or in tundra . 824625_839225
in northern or more northern areas . 841245_843685
now voles do cycle here for example in Michigan . 843965_846925
so but they seem to be in relatively simple systems at least that's what we think so far . 848265_853445
so we have these cycles let's go back to thinking about our model can we take that simple logistic model ? 854785_863725
I told you it's a really simple model then could we generate cycles with that ? 863885_867945
well it turns out we can and how does that work ? 868785_873505
well let's take the logistic and we have this here change in population over time equals do you all have this memorized now ? 874755_886795
little R times N okay times our density dependent factor mkay ? 887375_904735
and remember I said one of the assumptions of the logistic was I'll get instantaneous density effects . 896145_903045
so the population now if we add one more individual to that that density effect is gonna occur right now . 904245_914785
as soon as we add an individual it's gonna kick in and start changing this &-uh population growth . 915325_921225
(o)kay <that was> that was instantaneous . 921685_923165
sorry I spelled that wrong . 925135_926575
and &-uh in fact we may not always have this instantaneous effect instead there may be a time lag or delay . 928535_939595
so that instead what we find is we have our population (0.6) where we have the N at some previous time +... 941845_957645
affects the population at time now . 960965_963125
okay ?
so let's &-uh let's look at how this would well first of all let's &~ex let's give you a biological example . 965795_975735
&-uh one example is just within a species and we can look at Daphnia and these are little water fleas they're very common in lakes very important fish food and in Daphnia the adults of Daphnia these little creatures actually store food as fat globules in their bodies . 976715_995835
okay ?
and as a result when we have the population growth we have our logistic growth here the &-uh it should be slowing down here as they &~imme start coming up to the resources K but in fact these Daphnia have stored all of this food so the population can actually increase keep on increasing above what it should be set by by resources . 997915_1023215
(o)kay ? 1024255_1024335
okay and then it gets too far above and then it starts kicking in we start getting negative &-uh growth but again the population now starts to decline and it's based on the previous population . 1025445_1039105
the density effect is based on the previous population so it's gonna decline below the carrying capacity . 1040225_1046525
okay ?
so as a result we can see that we can start getting cycles because of this delay or this time lag in the logistic . 1048475_1058495
now another way we could get a time &~la we could call this delayed density dependence then . 1060075_1066095
(0.6) and this is usually put in the equations where we just use &-uh a term tau (0.8) okay . 1072225_1084445
but that's it's just the &~gi you need to know the idea of this whole thing you're not gonna actually &-uh do this . 1085245_1091085
and &-uh so we have this delayed density dependence and we could also get it through another kind_of a a a predator something like this . 1092745_1103725
okay ? 1104245_1104265
or we could have a time lag because say predators increase but then they increase and they stay at a high population and &-uh start forcing the population then down below the saturation K . 1104805_1119865
and so we get cycles and I'll I'll go over that again in a minute . 1120505_1124465
so we can see then how a time lag can start to give you cycles . 1126385_1130645
and I have on your handout where people have done this with our simple logistic equation where they put in a one generation time lag and here's the population growth with no time lag and here's the population growth with one time lag . 1131545_1147325
and we get these nice cycles . 1147625_1149585
okay ?
and it turns out that as we increase the &-uh time lag okay ? 1150805_1160525
and if we have high R and we increase time lags these cycles get bigger and bigger the oscillations get greater . 1160705_1173845
okay ? 1175345_1175685
so here's an example of that and what finally happens which is really fascinating is that instead of these nice regular cycles which are called stable limit cycles +... 1175745_1190005
where we have these cycles going on and on over a long period of time we start getting really violent fluctuations and we can end up with population growth that might look like something like this . 1193165_1209685
(0.6) and this is called chaos . 1211325_1217385
(0.6) so this very simple equation the logistic remember it's a very simple equation just by adding time lags and having a high little R we can generate this really complex population behavior . 1222735_1234795
it not even regular cycles anymore it's just violent oscillations . 1235535_1239295
and yet it is generated by a very simple deterministic equation . 1240195_1244715
so here is N over time . 1246055_1247475
so we have this simple deterministic equation (0.5) we add a time lag and we can get this chaos or chaotic behavior . 1248905_1262825
(0.6) and &-uh it looks totally unpredictable . 1267125_1269565
but is it's deterministic . 1270905_1272365
and this was a really exciting and somewhat disturbing finding because we're very interested in how often does density dependence population growth occur how important is density dependence and here we have this model and it doesn't give us just a sweep logistic it gives us this totally unpredictable looking pattern . 1272735_1292515
and &-uh it's &-uh this whole idea of chaos has come into many different fields . 1294175_1298475
now it's in physics it's in chemistry &-uh it's in many different areas and it's really like a revolution in trying to think about how the world works . 1298505_1307505
and this actually came out_of Robert May who was a physicist who became an ecologist and he explored these models . 1307685_1315185
and he's the one who really started this by thinking about the simple population models . 1315885_1320185
he came up with this aspect of chaos . 1320765_1323125
which is &-uh very exciting and has implications in all these different fields . 1323935_1329975
so it is interesting then that we can take our simple little model and we can generate very interesting behavior . 1331955_1340775
okay .
in fact if we take a a real population cycle +//. 1341895_1346295
this is with little lemmings and they're like voles &-uh and they have these cycles that where they have a peak about every three or four years . 1347045_1357185
they have taken the original data and this is on your handout and &-uh fit one of these logistic equations with a time lag . 1358225_1367945
and they're able to predict or generate I should say the population cycle pretty well that you see in nature . 1368395_1376435
and so just with this tau or this value T &-uh we can fit the natural population cycles . 1377135_1385255
so that's all really well and good what can we say from that ? 1386075_1390095
does that mean we've explained it ? 1390275_1391855
well no we we could be right for the wrong reason right ? 1392955_1395595
maybe these cycles are due to something totally different . 1395745_1398145
or maybe there is some density dependence in there . 1398985_1401445
and maybe it's just within this population or maybe it's created by density dependent factors outside this population like predators . 1401705_1409325
or food . 1410125_1410705
so this has become the big question then is what factors actually cause these population cycles ? 1411585_1418785
is there a delayed density dependence and <is that> &~wha is that really what's causing the cycles and what are the factors &-uh involved with that ? 1419555_1428335
so &-uh what I want to do then is give you some approaches that have been used in trying to explain these population cycles in different species . 1429235_1440995
and (0.6) oh first I'm gonna show you this this is in contrast now to what has happened in some cases &-uh this is a reindeer population this is just to remind you of the &{l=SIC difference &}l=SIC things that could happen these are reindeer that were introduced to the Pribilof Islands off Alaska and here we see on one island the population went into exponential growth and then it crashed . 1443475_1470035
and &-uh went extinct . 1470995_1472735
okay ? 1473805_1474085
here's another island the population grew &~s kinda slowly and then just kinda &~stable stabilized at a very low low level . 1474205_1481665
so &~w what determines these different population behaviors ? 1482145_1485105
what factors were going on and then &-uh so we can ask about what factors cause these cycles but really the way we do it can be applied to any kinda population . 1485305_1496545
not just cycling populations . 1496965_1498145
but these kinds of populations as well . 1498725_1500925
if I had the first slide (0.7) &-uh okay . 1501475_1511015
can we push that over ? 1511475_1512555
that's great . 1514135_1514715
alright (be)cause I hadta show you my reindeer slide this is +//. 1515735_1518135
I was in Sweden this summer in Northern Sweden and &-uh here are the reindeer the &-uh Laplanders or Saami actually &-uh herd these and so forth but &-uh they're +//. 1518375_1528535
during the summer they wander all around and &-uh browse and they're all over . 1528575_1533835
it was wonderful . 1534095_1534555
very exciting to see these running around they're small they look like baby deer . 1534775_1539915
it was really cute . 1540815_1541515
and so that's an example of reindeer . 1542415_1544795
and &-uh here is the area in Northern Sweden where this where I saw these reindeer . 1545375_1550735
and this is just to remind you that these cycles often occur in very simple habitats and this is more of a boreal habitat where we have mostly just &-uh spruce and a few birch and &-uh and some areas just &~hav tend to have just grasslands . 1550955_1565395
and many of these &{l=SIC populuns@u &}l=SIC are also in tundra where it's mostly just sedges and &-uh a few shrubs so these simple environments seem to somehow foster the cycle cycles +... 1565715_1579835
so first I'm gonna talk a little bit about what are called microtine cycles and microtine is &-uh &-uh these are microtine rodents and they include the lemmings that we <were talking> about and voles &-uh lemmings are more northern voles occur here if you go out into any field you'll &~f see voles and they do show cycles right here in Michigan as I mentioned . 1583315_1608355
and &-uh and here is a lemming aren't they cute ? 1609355_1611615
I think they're adorable but &-uh anyhow these lemmings are very very interesting and they occur in northern environments all over through &-uh Canada and Scandinavia &-uh and what is amazing is they have these dramatic population cycles . 1613325_1634285
and the peaks tend to occur about every three years and the population increase is just phenomenal . 1634945_1642525
and &-uh this has been &-um known historically for a very long time and in the &-uh nineteen twenties Charles Elton who was a very well known ecologist in Britain at Oxford got interested in these population cycles of lemmings in Scandinavia . 1643625_1668405
and he was going to Norway and &-uh here they were well known for what are called their marches to the sea . 1669345_1678745
and what you would see during these peaks there'd be so many lemmings the ground would just be &~s covered seething with lemmings and they would reach the edges of the fjords in Norway at the edge of the ocean and they would jump in like &-uh Gary Larson so nicely shows here in this little cartoon . 1679625_1699805
and so these were called the marches to the sea and like what what's going on with this ? 1700705_1704365
&-uh and they're fascinated Elton and I'm gonna read a little bit from his paper on this so he said +"/. 1704905_1712645
+" &{l=READING every few years these lemmings migrate down from the lowland in immense numbers to the edge of the ocean . 1712825_1718325
+" and the lemmings march chiefly at night and may traverse more than a hundred miles of country before reaching the sea into which they plunge unhesitatingly and continue to swim on until they die . 1719025_1733605
even then they float so that their dead bodies form drifts on the seashore . 1734605_1739025
&}l=READING so this is the sort_of pattern that grabs your attention . 1739945_1742545
right ? 1743065_1743205
and we really want to try to explain what is going on . 1743785_1748205
and first of all these marches to the sea are very dramatic but in fact it's just a matter of dispersal . 1749105_1753885
the population is getting really high and so animals are trying to leave and find better areas with food . 1754225_1760845
and so there's a natural dispersal and it turns out some populations happen to disperse towards the &~en edges of these cliffs and the ocean and they basically get pushed over or happen to fall over whatever they're obviously not committing suicide as some people have called these suicidal marches and they aren't marching to the sea they're just trying to disperse and find better habitats . 1761585_1783485
so these &-uh &-uh drownding in the sea does not explain the cycles . 1784585_1790485
that's not what causes these cycles &-uh these peak numbers to decrease . 1790645_1796265
it's not that many individuals that are involved . 1797045_1800145
and also these decreases are equally dramatic . 1800865_1804565
when they're in a low you can hardly find a a a lemming . 1805265_1808805
you can go out and search and you may not see a single one . 1809505_1813025
so very dramatic population cycles . 1814005_1817265
and people have tried to explain this for a long time and I like this explanation that I wanted to just tell you about . 1818945_1829125
this was in fifteen thirty two and there was actually an explanation written about this and the explanation is shown in this wood cut . 1829395_1840275
and their explanation was that the lemmings fell from the sky and were eaten then by ermine ermines which are these &-uh weasels that turn white in the summer I mean in the winter sorry . 1841175_1855335
they're they're pretty pretty too but &-uh and here's the picture of these weasels eating these little lemmings . 1855995_1864275
okay . 1864795_1864815
and the interesting thing this is a little idea about how science the the time difference that we have because in &-uh this explanation was given in fifteen thirty two and it was confirmed in fifteen ninety nine by eyewitnesses who were reliable men of great veracity or truth . 1865785_1890085
so that was the state of science in the fifteen hundreds and see how long it took for them to even test this &-uh hypothesis . 1890785_1900405
and of_course Elton didn't really buy this explanation as I don't think anyone here is going to do . 1901065_1906745
and so he wanted to look for what factors are actually determining these population cycles that are just so so dramatic and one of the first factors that &-uh he thought about and others was &-uh could it be weather ? 1907265_1927805
that is somehow there's a cycle in the weather and these are the good years and those are the bad years . 1931255_1936615
mkay ?
and people looked at this for a long time but there just aren't any weather patterns that are that regular for that long . 1937215_1944895
so it just has never held up . 1945955_1947835
and we just cannot explain these cycles this may determine some of the population numbers at times but it does not explain this sorta regulation &-uh with cycles . 1948175_1959055
so people have dismissed that . 1959905_1961765
now it is very interesting that if you go back and look at the hare lynx cycle this hare cycle which is &-uh nine to ten years nine to eleven years I guess and then it just varies . 1962425_1978605
&-uh people did think there is something that varies on that kind of cycle . 1979305_1984325
do people know what that is ? 1984445_1985405
+, I think I hear it sunspots . 1988205_1989625
so people have actually looked to see if for the snowshoe hare this is related to sunspots . 1990845_1997885
because they tend to flare up about &~ele every eleven years . 1998885_2001885
okay ? 2002745_2003265
so these other cycles they wouldn't explain the microtine rodents but maybe it would explain the snowshoe hare . 2004565_2010925
and it turns out that this did fit for quite a while but then things got out_of synchrony . 2011225_2016705
and it didn't work . 2017445_2019025
so the evidence is not looking good for that +... 2020505_2023665
(o)kay +...
so people started looking at other factors particularly biotic factors and one of (th)em was the thought of well what about predators or predation &-uh such as these little weasels these ermines on the microtine rodents ? 2028305_2044405
because that could cause &-uh cycles . 2044905_2047925
if you look at &-uh how predation might change as the population grows we might see &-uh cycles occurring . 2047925_2058685
and let's just look at just with you think about it makes sense . 2060145_2063685
we have a high prey population and the predators then eat a_lot and they're doing really well so they reach a very high level . 2064445_2074265
but then as they eat up <the prey> the prey start declining and then the predators can't get as much food and they start declining even through lower birth rates or higher death rates . 2075145_2085385
and and then when the predators get rare the prey can start increasing again . 2086525_2091725
so you can see where we might have the predation actually set up cycles in their prey . 2092565_2100785
and people have done &-uh predator prey models and &-uh Doctor_Warner's gonna be talking about this aspect he'll be starting your lecture next week and you'll talking about all these interactions &-uh and including predator prey models so he'll talk about that a little more but I think intuitively you can see how predation could cause a cycle . 2101585_2122445
and so what you can get with &-uh predator prey interactions are what are called coupled oscillations +... 2122985_2133105
you may not get them but you can get these in models and they've actually done laboratory experiments where they've been able to find &-uh these coupled oscillations in &-uh insect and as a parasitory . 2136005_2148405
so and this is really due to a time delay . 2150585_2153385
(o)kay ? 2154825_2154945
or a time lag . 2156105_2157445
because a predator's lagging behind the prey . 2157805_2160305
okay ? 2160905_2161285
so we're back to our sorta idea of how we could generate cycles in our models . 2161405_2166085
so we can see through models then that predators could cause cycles but is that what's causing the cycles we actually see in nature ? 2166485_2175805
and we tend to focus on predators because they're so cool I guess . 2177985_2184265
but let's also think there's another sort_of predator prey &-uh &-uh interaction going on here and that is that these animals eat plants . 2184665_2194785
the lemmings eat sedges . 2195685_2196925
the hares browse on twigs . 2197465_2200005
and so we could also imagine this same oscillation going on with the food or plants and food quantity and quality that is how nutritious the food is and the herbivores . 2200625_2218905
so we basically have a predator prey &-uh cycle . 2220565_2224585
that could be through effects on the food . 2225305_2228065
the food that the lemmings eat out <the food> the food &~de &-uh decreases the lemmings decrease and then the plants can recover . 2228665_2238605
so you have again this lag time then between the food and the herbivores . 2239365_2243765
so we really have two big biotic factors that could cause these cycles and that is predator prey or food interactions . 2244765_2256425
so people &-um have set out to study that . 2257465_2260785
and for some reason I can't get my handouts xxx . 2263025_2266885
the study I'm gonna talk about next is the snowshoe hare study and its main predator here which are lynx (0.6) . 2268165_2277985
and this &-uh let's see and the next slide xxx (0.4) here's a snowshoe hare . 2283505_2292785
this is in the summer . 2293165_2294065
in the winter it turns white so it is camouflaged against the snow . 2294425_2298745
and &-uh and they show these &-uh nine to eleven year cycles and here's a lynx . 2300385_2306025
which is one of the main predators not the only predator . 2306605_2309185
but &-uh one of the major predators . 2310065_2311985
and we have these records of the hare and lynx cycles and if we look at this we see exactly what I told you for the hare as it increases the lynx increase but with a lag time when the hares decline the lynx decline but with a lag time . 2312805_2332845
and so we have the lynx tracking the hares . 2333285_2336325
so they sorta track the hare cycles . 2337225_2340005
but are they the cause of the cycles ? 2341505_2344945
or are they just following along with these hare cycles that are caused for some other reason ? 2345365_2350625
(0.4) (o)kay now it fits very nicely but maybe that's not the actual the lynx don't really cause these these cycles so that's our question . 2351745_2361905
so &-um there's been a_lot_of research done on this oh I know what I wanted to mention . 2363625_2369725
and they have these incredible records that go back to eighteen forty five . 2370225_2373285
and the reason we have this long time span is because of the Hudson Bay Company and fur trapping records . 2373745_2381085
(o)kay ?
because that's a problem with a_lot_of our ecological studies that we don't have long term data and when we're looking at population cycles we need long term kinds of studies . 2382065_2390945
and &-uh the Canadian government actually has &-uh they have convinced the Canadian government that this is really an interesting problem and the government has put in millions of dollars into a huge &-uh &-uh huge research projects trying to understand what caused these cycles in &-um Canada . 2392385_2411985
and there's a +//. 2412805_2413505
one major person is a guy named Charles Krebs who's done a_lot_of work on both microtine rodents and on the snowshoe hare &-uh cycles . 2413665_2423265
and &-uh he wanted to look then at the effect of predation and food which for the snowshoe hare are twigs . 2423745_2439465
they tend to browse on twigs of &-um different shrubs and low trees and so forth . 2440475_2447155
and now &-um actually I want to do a little aside here if you think about predation you would think that with the predation it's obvious why +//. 2447835_2459535
of_course it must cause these cycles I mean when predators kill <the prey> the prey have to decrease right ? 2460055_2465755
so it would seem almost like it's an &{l=SIC obviosity@n &}l=SIC . 2465955_2468415
but that's not necessarily true because you could have predation where the lynx are killing all these hares but it's possible they're just killing hares that would have died anyhow . 2469865_2480365
and that the cycle's really caused say by food and the predators are just causing what we call secondary mortality . 2481505_2488085
(0.6) and this just means that the predators kill the prey that are doomed to die anyhow . 2493745_2499565
for other reasons +... 2501065_2501785
mkay .
so it may be we see these nice coupled oscillations but the predators don't have anything to do with them . 2502885_2511725
(o)kay ?
now the predator cycles are just following the prey cycles . 2513185_2517265
so this is &-uh something we need to find out and the way to test whether it's predation or food is to do field experiments . 2519415_2528975
and this is what Krebs and actually many &~m a whole group of people have been working on this . 2529775_2534135
and we're also dealing with a system &-uh I think we can just actually stop the slides yeah thanks <we can get> a little more light here . 2535095_2547215
&-um and the scale of this is a real problem because when you think about lynx I mean those animals can go over large areas snowshoe rabbits can go over large areas and &-uh the experiments that I'm gonna talk about today they had plots that were a kilometer squared . 2545215_2563795
(o)kay ? 2564235_2565335
so we're talking like big scale experiments . 2565775_2568455
and they had two plots a kilometer squared each where they added food for the hares and they did this by adding commercial rabbit chow it's known to be good for bunnies and so they increased both the quantity and the quality +... 2569255_2589555
(o)kay . 2594535_2599075
and then they had only one plot where they did a predator exclusion and here's where &~th I mean there weren't any replicates on this but you can imagine how difficult it is to exclude all the predators in a kilometer square of area . 2594975_2610935
and &-uh they went and they live trapped out these predators &-uh there were also coyotes and lynx and &-uh well two of the major predators and they put +//. 2612015_2623295
did this they live trapped (th)em and then they had an electric fence to keep them out (o)kay ? 2623595_2629915
and then they had &-um one plot where they had both food and predator exclusion +... 2631175_2641475
they also had two plots where they added fertilizer . 2644315_2649955
and this was to increase the plant quality . 2650675_2654615
in case plant quality and quantity was driving these cycles so this was actually through the plants the natural food that the snowshoe hares are eating and then they had three controls . 2655535_2668655
okay so not many replicates but I said it's &-uh hard in field ecology to get the kind of replicates you can do in lab just because these experiments are so huge . 2670175_2679675
and what they did is they +//. 2680695_2681795
and then the time scale they followed these hares' population patterns for eight years and they followed it then through &-uh the start of a cycle through a peak and through to another low . 2681865_2698405
mkay ?
so this was the timeframe of the experiment . 2698945_2702065
so &-um if you think about any lab people &-um I don't know how many of you start out intending to do an eight year project where you're gonna get results in like eight years . 2702705_2712765
okay so what'd they find out ? 2714545_2717225
okay well I have this on your handout this little figure and here we're just going to look at what was the effect of these different treatments on the survival rate ? 2717865_2729605
this is our LX . 2730195_2731215
(be)cause that's gonna tell something about whether the population's gonna increase or decrease . 2731375_2735675
and if it's in the decline phase if LX increases it means the decline will be less or it may mean be that it'd even stop that decline . 2736495_2745195
okay ? 2745835_2746255
so what did they find out ? 2746535_2747995
well first of all fertilizer had no effect it was not significant +... 2748735_2754815
so it seemed like even though the twigs sort_of disappeared and there is some change in the plants they couldn't seem to change the plant effect . 2757705_2765805
and doesn't mean it doesn't happen but somehow this fertilizer did not work . 2766305_2769465
okay ? 2770625_2770985
and then they looked at food the rabbit chow and they found out that in fact survival rate increased over the controls and that was significant . 2771165_2779625
so what this means is that this decline then was less if you added food . 2780765_2787645
okay ?
(0.6) and so this would then affect that population cycle . 2789825_2797385
but the cycle is still going on . 2797545_2799325
okay well then they looked at this predator exclosure and here they found out that the survival rate was even greater . 2800365_2807925
okay ? 2808675_2808995
so again we have this decline is less (0.4) but the cycle is still there . 2809155_2819855
the &~pop the hares is still going to go through this decline . 2820235_2823835
so yes but &-uh it doesn't stop the cycling . 2825275_2831595
and then they did looked at the experiment where they combined both of those and this was the most significant . 2832065_2840165
and the interesting thing here is if you can just look at this if we take the food effect and add that to the predator effect it would be about here . 2841045_2849745
okay ?
so when you do both of these you don't just get an additive effect that is that we add the food effect to the predator effect but we get an even greater effect than you would predict by this additive effects . 2852425_2866205
by adding the two effects so this is called an interaction . 2866525_2869245
so we seem to be that the predator and the food interacted and so we have a significant statistical interaction . 2870365_2878885
that is we're getting a bigger effect than we would predict by either one &-uh food or predator removal alone and here they found that the decline virtually stopped . 2879555_2891255
not completely but pretty much and it pretty much stopped the cycles . 2891735_2897795
(0.4) mkay .
so the conclusion then from this incredible set of experiments is that it may be not just is it predation or is it food but rather it's an interaction between the two of them . 2902925_2916585
and why might there be what is the biological reason for interaction ? 2917525_2923005
(0.4) well they don't know but some of the hypotheses are that when you have &-uh the predators are abundant +... 2927605_2935985
it may be that the hares perceive this risk of predation and they may forage less they may eat less and so their survivorship goes down and &-uh Doctor_Werner's gonna be talking about this because to avoid the predation they don't go out and eat as much or it could be that as food quality goes down +... 2939675_2964555
or as food quality goes down they're more susceptible to predation +... 2968315_2972195
that is they can't escape as easily . 2975195_2978115
they're not in such good condition . 2979255_2980715
or it could be that instead they're searching more for good food so they're more exposed to predation . 2981115_2987115
so all of these factors then could &-uh cause this interaction effect that they believe they saw . 2989425_2997125
now we only have the one one replicate but &-um these are all hypotheses as to why they saw that effect . 2997685_3004565
and so this is one of our most complete studies &-uh let me just mention that the for the microtine rodents they have very similar results if they remove all the predators they can pretty much stop the cycles but there also appears to be a food effect so this may be general &-uh that both interact but the end of the story still is not in . 3006025_3035325
people are still studying this and &-uh well I guess I'll end there it's very fascinating and we're still trying to figure out what's going on . 3035745_3064865
so +..
