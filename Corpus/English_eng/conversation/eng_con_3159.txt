Kevin let's try that again . 130_1580
I need to untape it and slide it over an up down flip . 2080_4940
it looks like the other one . 5500_6700
it's same . 9500_10170
well could it just left it . 12350_13950
what do you . 14110_14300
it's still an up down flip . 14520_15500
just an up down flip . 15990_16860
well is there another way to make that happen . 17230_20110
because . 21410_21560
I think some of you were thinking something besides up down flip .
we hold on . 24900_25810
I have to write down up down flip and up down . 26320_28420
flip . 28510_28740
did get that one looking like this one who's picking a different
Brittany . 34560_35010
&-um turn it to the left . 35410_37510
one . 39300_39470
two fourths . 42100_42560
turn it to the left two fourths . 43130_45200
okay . 46060_46220
you didn't turn it . 46690_47260
anyway yet I'm just moving it over here so you can see it . 47280_49580
let's see . 50080_50460
turn it to the left . 50510_51370
one fourth two fourths . 53540_56620
turn it back . 60270_61270
one fourth . 61500_62070
okay . 62830_63100
if I turn it back one fourth . 63180_64780
so . 66620_66790
what was your then . 66840_68270
what would the whole &-um your whole movement be . 68320_71260
if we were starting like this . 71420_72540
turn it to the left one fourth . 74000_75420
get it to the right . 78700_79790
two fourth . 80220_80660
hold on . 80990_81360
you mean there might be three ways to do this . 81940_83580
turn . 83830_83950
two . 85500_85570
turn . 86840_86980
it to the right . 87000_87790
two fourth . 89640_89820
this is the beginning position . 90260_91230
turn three two fourths . 92050_93270
three three <two two> two three three . 93570_97100
okay . 97750_98020
we're going right this time . 98320_99510
one fourth two fourths . 100140_102830
one one four . 103170_103980
three three fourths . 104050_105510
there's number one . 107790_108790
hold . 109600_109700
on hold on . 109720_110390
I'll lose this one if I don't write it down . 110630_112340
turn right . 113030_114140
three fourths . 116330_118110
&-um okay . 118980_120030
I need to put that one back in the starting position . 120160_122020
what's your idea . 122860_123630
Nathan oh away . 123680_124620
we don't have yet . 124640_125140
do a up down flip . 125860_126690
okay . 127640_127740
hold on . 129190_129380
I'm gonna move it where I can reach it . 129400_130539
better . 130680_130820
it's still in Teddy's beginning position . 130840_132450
I'm gonna do an up down flip . 133100_134390
then turn it . 135850_136550
&-um then turn it two times . 137580_141510
turn it to the left two times . 142830_144550
two around around two whole times . 145420_147700
yeah . 148550_148620
two holes . 149140_149590
that's one hole time . 152280_153150
the thing must be getting dizzy . 155050_156230
two hole times . 157340_157990
it it's it was still same . 159540_163400
but someone had already done up down just the up down flip . 166860_171540
so what does that show that Nathan knows about turning . 171940_176620
not about flipping . 177750_178420
what does it show that he knows about turning . 178510_180550
that you don't have to just turn it like &-um three-fourths or
you can turn it whole sometimes . 187250_189180
what does a hole turn do to a core . 189670_191500
square it . 191620_192230
it turns it all the way around . 193750_195340
so it's better in the same position that it started in . 195660_199590
so if I do one turn on Teddy's Core square . 200060_204780
how will Teddy's Core square look . 205620_207070
same as you're holding it right now . 207670_209420
but if I do forty nine turns on Teddy's core . 209800_211970
square nine . 212040_212640
turns &-um it would be the same as it looked . 212930_216230
seven turns . 217170_217910
say how many turns you do . 218900_221150
stay full turn . 221630_223060
it's saying turns . 223110_224260
it's saying . 224570_224940
look how what you &-um how it looks . 224990_227820
&-um right now . 228290_228940
okay . 230010_230150
so Nathan's way is an up down flip . 230490_232560
and then turn . 234510_235750
I forgot which direction . 236210_237200
we turned Nathan . 237250_237950
&-um right <left left> left then . 238660_241630
then turn left . 242320_244960
&-um two times . 247310_248560
two . 249950_250010
hold two hold turns . 250740_252190
should I write so that nobody gets 'cause they might get confused
let's look at Jenna let's look at Jenna and Danny if you look at
well . 266330_266470
and you can be the first to share an idea if you would like . 266490_268510
okay . 268560_268790
this is the way Dennis Jen not designed her Core square . 269760_273750
that's the way Jenna designed her Core square . 274400_276110
I did something to Jenna's core square to make it look like this .
Danny what do you think I did . 283460_284480
flip right once . 289630_291050
flip it right once . 291840_293070
oh could I flip it left . 294110_295270
yeah . 296700_296880
do side flip . 298250_299160
right side left . 300520_302700
let's try . 303030_303320
Danny said . 303710_304200
flip it to the right . 304570_306080
yeah . 308840_309080
but then I flip it to the right . 309350_311280
right . 311980_312270
that's why I did flip it to the right . 312290_313590
you mean if I can start it the way Jenna did it . 314510_316440
and I can flip it to the left . 316510_317910
yeah . 318120_318270
and what word did I hear you use for that . 320310_321880
Brittany . 322170_322520
sideways flip . 323290_323670
sideways flip . 324450_324820
why are we using sideways flip instead_of flip . 325310_328470
right . 328490_329110
you do it because you can flip it any up . 329710_333240
you can flip it up . 333830_335070
you can flip it right or left . 336150_338370
and it still look the same . 339030_340500
and so the let's say you flip it right . 342110_344790
<then you> then you put it back . 344920_346910
then you flipped it left . 347150_348270
or it looked the same same as &-um the right as when you
do we know that . 354250_354870
what did you do yesterday . 355280_356350
because when we were making &-um &-um two by twos with quilts for
&-um we &-uh &-um we &-um you &-um we &-um started &-um doing first
and then they then then &-um after we we found out that we
then &-um then we started doing &-um it &-um doing it &-um right
and then we found out that that would even make the same thing
so then we &-um just called it sideways flip . 403260_406670
so flipping it right or left will look the same as_if I flip it up
no . 410860_411060
yeah . 411590_411670
no . 413260_413380
flipping it right or flipping it left . 414200_415940
makes it look the same right . 416150_417420
yeah . 417620_417790
it's up . 418230_418750
and flipping it up or flipping it down makes it look the same . 419390_422550
yeah . 422630_422730
so we came up instead_of four kinds of flips . 423070_425150
which we started out yesterday . 425200_426230
we kind of started out yesterday using flip it up . 426280_428460
flip it down . 429190_429660
flip it left and flip it right . 430260_431980
and after yesterday after a_lot_of testing and checking and
flip and sideways flip . 439470_442070
Katie do you have another way to turn Janice course square &-um
what do you think . 449550_449980
turn it to the left . 450270_451790
two fourth . 452500_453190
turn left . 453950_454520
two fourths . 454820_455410
I need to bring it a little closer to me . 455560_457040
this is Janice four square . 457630_459020
Janet do you think that's gonna work . 459600_460620
turn it left . 460870_461500
two fourths . 461770_462350
try to imagine . 464100_464660
no it it won . 464900_465620
you don't think it's gonna work . 469620_470430
let's try it . 470800_471390
turn left two fourths one fourth two-fourths . 471470_476430
no one fourth . 478140_478720
one fourth . 479190_479630
it needs to be one fourth . 479910_480960
you mean just turn left one fourth . 481670_483080
yeah . 483160_483380
okay . 483720_483880
I'm going back to the starting position . 484010_485400
I know this is Jenna's starting position . 485690_487080
'cause she marked her upper left corner . 487810_488950
turn left one fourth . 489720_490950
yeah . 491310_491460
it looks like . 492270_493030
does . 494040_494280
it . 494330_494540
no . 495710_495880
okay . 499390_499600
Kelly and then Vanessa if you want a video that's different from
here's how it starts . 505510_506550
Kelly what would you tell me to do to make it look like this turn .
right two fourth . 510580_511790
turn right . 512440_513080
two fourths one fourth two fourths . 513470_517429
got those two green triangles to the left hand side . 519630_521799
don't you_all right . 521900_523390
Vanessa is that what you were thinking or do you have another turn
one . 526870_527040
turn right . 527680_528270
one fourth . 528790_529270
got that blue one to the upper right corner . 532870_534630
didn't you but . 534790_536180
that green . 537270_537750
okay . 539710_539980
Vanessa you try again . 540260_541740
she's been thinking already an up down flip . 542200_546640
okay . 548490_548590
ready . 548690_548950
you're not done . 554590_555040
oh she says she's not done up down flip was her first step . 555320_558680
she thinks by doing an up down flip . 559160_560600
and then something else . 560720_561520
like we did here . 562390_562880
what would you do . 562930_563530
turn right . 564450_564670
