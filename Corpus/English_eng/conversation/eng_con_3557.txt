once there was a boy and his dog .
and the boy caught a frog .
that night he went to sleep .
and when he was asleep <the> the frog went to the pond .
the next morning he woke up .
and the frog was gone .
he looked <in> everywhere .
the dog put his head in the bowl .
to see .
<he looked out> he even looked outside .
then <the do(g)> his dog fell out the window .
and broke the jar .
he called for his frog in the woods .
and his dog sniffed for him in the air .
he looked in the hole .
but all he found was a gerbil .
then he looked in <the> a hole in a tree .
and his dog knocked down a beehive .
an owl knocked the boy down .
and the dog was running from the bees .
and then he climbed up on a rock .
and called for his frog .
but all he found was a deer .
and he was on top of his head .
the deer ran to a cliff .
and pushed him off into the pond .
then he found his frog .
because there was a log .
and he looked behind it .
and he found the frog he had .
then they gave one of their kids to him for a pet .
and he went home .
the end
