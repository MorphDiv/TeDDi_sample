frog where are you ?
look at that .
isn't that frog nice George ?
when the boy went to sleep the frog escaped .
in the morning he found he was gone .
he looked in his boot .
the dog looked in the glass .
he wasn't there .
he called out the window .
George !
no answer .
<the dog> the dog fell out the window .
he broke the glass .
and the boy was mad .
he called George again .
no answer .
he looked in his hole while the dog was jumping at a bee hive .
then a wart hog came up .
what are you guy-s looking for ?
did you see my frog George ?
the dog was still jumping at the bee hive .
he said no .
so he looked in a hole .
and he looked in a hole .
called George .
<was George> was George in there ?
no just an owl .
he swooned out and knocked the boy down .
why did you hit me like that ?
cause you were looking near my hole .
okay .
he called out George again .
no answer .
then a deer popped up .
and he flew on his antlers .
the deer gallopped down .
the dog was barking at the deer .
the deer flung him off of his head into the lake .
they both landed in the lake .
the boy sat up and listened .
he said shh to the dog .
and they both climbed over the log .
and there was George with <his> <her> his wife and seven
he gave him <one of the sons> one of the frogs and watched him
I think the dog's thinking about where the frog is .
<and he's calling> I think he's calling the name of the frog
yyy .
he's under the log .
I think he's thinking about the frog that he caught .
and the dog thinks he doesn't know where it is .
and I think the frog wanted to escape because he had his wife at
I think the boy's thinking how come he got out_of the jar when he
<and &-um if he could hop> and if he called his name he would
is he saying something here ?
he's calling his name .
and the dog wanted to jump out the window .
but he didn't know he had a glass bottle like a glass thing on him
and it broke .
and the boy was very mad at him .
and &-um <he> I think he's calling his name to see if he's
and <he look> he thinks he's down that hole .
but he wasn't .
<and the> because +...
and he has his hands on his nose .
I wonder why .
that was a skunk !
oh okay .
and what might he be saying there ?
you stink !
and the dog wants to know what's inside there .
he's thinking he's in there .
the bee hive fell because the dog was jumping at it .
the owl swarmed out because <he> he thought he was trying to
and the bees are going after him cause he knocked down their home .
so why is he running away so quickly ?
because the bees are chasing him because he knocked down their home
and he said he thought the owl knocked him down on purpose .
and he thinks these are branches .
and he's saying something again isn't he ?
<he's saying> he's calling his name .
and a deer lifted up .
he fell into his head .
how does he feel now ?
hurt .
and they carried him over .
the deer gallopped over and threw him off .
and he was scared .
so how did that happen ?
<the> he fell on the deer's head .
and the deer pushed him off .
and they landed with a splash .
it was probably hard because it's not that deep .
and he wanted to listen for the sound of the frog .
so why is he holding his hand up to his ear ?
he was listening to the sound of the frog .
and he's telling the dog to be quiet .
<and they found> and they found the frog .
and they saw their kids .
and how does he feel there ?
happy .
and took one .
and they said he could take one .
and then he left and said goodbye
