how did they do that is my question .

I saw that some of you were here yesterday . 265005_266845
if you would like . 268005_268905
how did they do that ?
&-uh Bruce &-uh can you please Morgan ? 269685_277245
how did you do that ? 277245_277985
the web page .
&-um .
how'd you get the pictures on it ? 280265_284925
you get the pictures from like different sources and you paste (th)em into a web page . 285805_291345
⌈ like there are programs ⌉ . 291365_292245
⌊ no like your ⌋ picture .
what's that ? 293145_293685
your picture . 293785_294305
oh we used a digital camera for that and then just imported (th)em like any other graph . 294905_298665
it was well done . 299845_300565
&=laughs well done . 302125_302945
what what &-uh as I mentioned in class it's not for instance the emailing . 304025_309225
your participation is how much you contribute it's not how often it's how much it's the content . 310065_316645
it's what you're really contributing to the class as a whole . 317565_320365
the same for the emailing it's the qualities it's not the quantity of the your email participation . 320825_326945
so if you &-uh he will talk about I if you have any further questions regarding the technical aspects of it you can ask now . 328385_338545
Vara did you read our did you read our emails ? 338665_341765
yeah .
yeah . 342045_342465
oh .
all of (th)em ?
yeah . 342925_344765
and sometimes I'd ⌈ print too ⌉ . 345685_347085
⌊ yeah she ⌋ responds .
I remember I like someone wrote like you're probably gonna delete this who wrote that ? 347925_352765
me . 353025_353305
Kelly .
I'm sure half of you will delete this before reading it but I just wanted to say that I <xxx yesterday with a tear in my eye> &=laughs:S12 most people watching that movie particularly because he has so many nonactors there are so many people who were there . 353425_370925
what happened was during the shooting of the the movie people passed and they saw the sign . 371155_377115
even though they knew it was the shooting of a feature film they hoped that she would really write the letters and give to them and they would get the chance to mail to their loved ones . 377555_388935
so as you probably may have noticed some of the people truly looked like they were not actors . 389635_395735
they were just there opening their hearts . 395915_398455
they were just saying it and sending a message hoping that they would send a message to a loved one . 398765_402945
and at the opening of the film she they +//. 403265_407185
the premiere was at that city . 407425_408625
so they went there and the people who had invaded the homes like they mentioned that that had really been invaded they came to her and said that the mayor still hadn't given them electricity . 409225_419985
so she went to him and said how come ? 421065_423365
you promised me when we were here . 423465_424825
so there is a_lot_of &-um participation of the real people from the region . 425025_430825
that's what made the movie special particularly to Brazilians who knew the behind_the_scenes stories . 431665_437285
&~s and it was nominated for an Oscar it didn't win but Life Is Beautiful it's was a good movie too so . 438365_444945
I don't know if &-um it's working well . 445885_448445
in the meantime we can this here one of the question this is from Robert from Kevin . 448545_455805
Kevin had asked &{l=READING how has the media reached the individuals living in the deepest part of the Amazon ? 456505_462545
are they beginning to try to modernize every every part of the country ? 463145_466865
&}l=READING anyone would like to try to answer that +..? 467265_469285
this is a question that Kevin asked . 471085_473725
&{l=READING how has the media reached individuals living in the deepest part of the Amazon ? 474105_478325
&}l=READING remember that we saw the Avon lady etcetera etcetera in that documentary . 478805_483225
anyone would have from future presentations anyone would have any input or any information ? 484405_491285
I don't wanna answer if it is something that is part of your presentation . 491825_494585
yes Betty ? 495125_495925
well didn't we learn in like one of the videos like &-um TV is just universal down there like everyone has one and it's just like all linked together ? 495795_503875
and so that's how like people even in the deepest regions can stay in contact . 504675_508615
it was part of a government &-um campaign it was party of the government plot or goals to unite the country . 509735_519235
what they wanted were was to have every single citizen or as many as possible even in the jungle to have access to TV and that was how they spread their propaganda . 519675_532075
it was during the dictatorship . 532635_533775
they worked in partnership with Globo which is considered the fourth largest TV network in the world . 534455_541215
and the government wanted to show the PSAs and documentaries and TV ads etcetera and even soap operas . 542025_551865
they were all part of the &-uh government plan to introduce information that it would benefit the &-um government goals and plans . 552465_563385
that's why even in the jungle when they didn't have electricity the government would provide electricity and buy even if only one TV set and put in the center of the square and people would come in the evenings and watch TV . 564025_579305
maybe some of you who've had Kottak's anthropology class have heard about that ? 579925_584345
I remember someone early in the semester &~men &~me mentioning anthropology . 584385_589465
but &-um the TV had a very &~i <it was> it was part of the government's &-um plan to communicate so brought TV even to Indian villages etcetera . 590265_604285
if you guys are ready is it working Bruce ? 605305_608845

it's ⌈ ready to go ⌉ +/.

&=reading_throughout_utterance seven thousand four hundred ninety one kilometers of coastline . 777325_780605

Brazilians are friendly warm and happy people . 792245_794805
above all they are free spirited and resent being told what to do . 795625_798385
Brazilians are gregarious outgoing and love to be around people . 799185_802205
the hot climate allows them to spend a great deal of time outdoors often just chatting with friends or watching people . 802785_808365
this seems like an ideal place . 809705_810865
however there is much that is less than ideal happening beneath the surface . 811705_814185
the prison and law enforcement systems appear certainly less than ideal . 815185_818205
torture happens often and methods of interrogation are frequently inhumane +... 818845_822225
two women Marlie and Rosanna were tortured and sexually assaulted by civil police when they were interrogated in connection with a murder . 824145_831505
the women were taken to a police station and subjected to two days of torture . 832765_836285
when Marlie refused to sign a confession a police officer slapped her on both ears . 837725_841605
another policemen then hit her on the soles of her feet and palms of her hand with a long strip of rubber cut from a car tire . 842465_848545
the police officers both lowered their trousers and rubbed their penises in the face of Marlie who was handcuffed . 849765_854425
the couple says this treatment continued for two days during which they were not permitted to drink eat wash or have contact with a lawyer . 855225_863285
the police allegedly also asked for bribes . 864505_866405
when they were finally allowed to wash under a water pipe it was in the presence of a policeman and male prisoners . 867405_872545
when they were finally transferred to the women's prison staff noted their visible injuries and tried to persuade them to have a medical examination however they refused . 873255_880975
because in_order_to get to the Forensic Medical Institute they would have hadta travel with a police escort made up of the same police who had tortured them . 881895_888615
in a hearing before the judge the couple alleged ill treatment by the police but the judge has not taken steps to investigate their allegations of torture despite the existence of a medical report and eyewitness testimony to their injuries by prison staff . 890425_904145
no action has been taken against the policemen involved either . 905025_906945
public prosecutors from the court that oversees prison sentences discovered a range of instruments in a small bathroom in the ground floor of the prison known to be used for torture sessions . 909185_918605
these included wet towels which are placed over the victim's head electrical devices from which bare wires protruded for applying electric shocks and a metal bar from which victims are suspended upside down by their ankles and wrists . 919685_931525
how could any human treat another in such an inhumane way ? 932525_934865
what is this all about ? 935545_936465
law enforcement agents are supposed to serve and protect citizens not rape beat torture and abuse them . 937105_942385
the mindset of an individual who feels it necessary or even justifiable to make another human feel less than human is tragic . 943165_948645
torture and beatings are an unnecessary part of life . 949405_951545
no man deserves to be treated as subordinate . 952325_953945
these practices must stop . 954385_955345
&=applause (0.14) .
okay &-um I'm going to talk about the the political &-um corruption that happens in Brazil and relate it to the the &~stor history of corruption . 974695_984515
&=reading_throughout_utterance &-um Brazil is the largest nation in South America and the third world's most populous democracy . 985335_991755
political leaders have always faced challenges in ruling Brazil because of its immense size and population . 993195_997895
ever since the conquest corruption has been the norm among politicians . 999295_1002915
because Brazil has been slower to make political changes than the rest of Latin America it is harder to find &~similari similarities between it and Spanish America . 1003875_1013155
for example while the Spanish nations were becoming independent through revolutions Brazil was being ruled by a Portuguese emperor . 1013775_1021055
also contrary to the majority of Spanish America slavery was abolished in the late eighteen hundreds a hundred years after the rest of Spanish America . 1022235_1030455
this might explain the more prominent gap between the rich and the poor as the former black slaves are a majority population of poor and the white rich elite and politicians are the minority of wealthy . 1031715_1044555
through the many political regimes there seems to be a &~pr pattern of wealthy oligarchy controlling a nation through corruption . 1045715_1053795
through the corrupt military regime +//. 1054935_1057135
though the corrupt military regime is over the democratic state of Brazil is the democratic state of Brazil immune to the traditional corruption ? 1057715_1065575
many scholars believe that the political system needs to be reformed because the corruption is still a prevalent problem . 1066035_1072595
for instance politicians can easily partake in corruption because many of them stay in office for one or less terms . 1073505_1080885
even if they were to stay in office longer there are ways to get around scandals . 1082045_1085765
one of the most used methods is through the corrupt judiciary system . 1086865_1090625
though Brazil's constitution imitates the US one there are many inconsistencies . 1091445_1096005
the court system is supposed to balance the power of the Congress and executive branch . 1096805_1101345
but if all are corrupt how can the corruption be eliminated ? 1101955_1104975
as for the political candidates how can the people elect a politician when the campaigns are based on personality and not ability ? 1106095_1113295
yes the people have the right to vote but is there really an honest politician to choose from ? 1114615_1119155
many believe that the current President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is the one to break the chain of corrupt politicians . 1120155_1126775
however recently a scandal arose involving him and a Cayman Islands bank account holding three hundred and sixty eight million dollars . 1127315_1135575
luckily the documents claiming this turned out to be false . 1136455_1139095
nevertheless Cardoso's predessor predecessor Fernando Collor was removed from office in nineteen ninety two because of a real corruption scandal . 1139935_1150075
another more recent scandal of corruption dealt with the murder of a judge who attempted to expose his fellow judges to the Brazilian Senate . 1151485_1159645
he claimed that some of them received bribes were receiving bribes from drug traffickers to reduce their sentences . 1161005_1167565
and others were involved in embezzling court funds . 1168785_1171425
at least in reaction to all of this people are beginning to recognize the corruption in Brazilian courts . 1172465_1177205
however does this mean change is &~like likely to conquer <a cure> ? 1177305_1181745
or will this incident be forgotten ? 1182285_1184085
the good news is that President Cardoso appears to be a good politician . 1185305_1188385
unlike those before him he has maintained his office position for more than a term . 1189005_1192945
and although he faces great economic social and political changes that stem from centuries of corruption he may be starting a trend of anticorruption as he seeks the necessary reforms . 1193725_1204465

we'll wait and have &-uh ask questions at the end so who is next now Anita Robert ? 1245975_1254495
Robert .
(0.15) .
okay . 1269075_1269315
well welcome to health care in Brazil . 1269975_1272695
&=reading_throughout_utterance &-um first of all Brazil ranks fourth in the world in the number of AIDS cases so this should give you a little bit of an idea about the quality of health care in Brazil . 1273735_1283175
mhm +/.
+, &-um now the &~h public health care system in Brazil suffers from &-uh two things lack of money and unequal regional distribution of services . 1284175_1293195
now there is money to be spent and &-um like Carol &-uh pointed out there's a_lot_of corruptness in the political &-uh realm circle in Brazil and so what happens is the little that is spent whether they hoard it or not +/. 1294105_1306905
+, mhm +/.
+, &-uh you might see a_lot_of politicians playing golf &-um stuff like that possibly . 1307485_1311845
&-um but anyways little of it is spent and it's not spent well in fact in nineteen ninety two a stat says that &-uh Brazilian government spent roughly fifty dollars per person on health care per year . 1312605_1321965
in the United States that's gonna get us maybe an immunization shot +/. 1322345_1325445
+, mhm +/.
+, for whatever hepatitis flu . 1326425_1327745
&-um compare this with our own country the United States which is a mediocre health care spender and &-uh &~w our country spends &-uh two thousand eight hundred and forty dollars per person per year . 1328465_1337685
so &-um quite a drastic change in fact fifty six times &-um more than Brazil . 1338525_1342325
&-um now the benefits of &-um Brazil's improving health care system &-um have unfortunately been shared unequally by both region and class . 1342945_1352685
again the south is the richer area in Brazil +/. 1353245_1356185
+, mhm +/.
+, where Sao Paulo is . 1357225_1358105
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um there's gonna be more &-uh more buildings more hospitals better quality hospitals &-um so people in the south are gonna you know have more access to better health care . 1358725_1368885
&-um also &-um in terms of class the rich class have &-um much more access to better health care systems for example say the president of a business or say a high CEO is gonna &~h he's gonna be &-um he's gonna have available to him say &-uh an ambulance +/. 1369505_1387965
+, mhm +/.
+, top class physicians maybe even a helicopter +/. 1388745_1390785
+, mhm mhm +/.
+, where as a person below him let's take out the helicopter right ? 1390845_1395265
&-um he's gonna have you know physicians maybe not the top physicians he's gonna have an ambulance but &-um exclude the helicopter and the best physicians and it's kind_of a hierarchy that goes down to the poor class basically the poor get nothing . 1395855_1407095
&-um now we'll move on to AIDS in Brazil &-um like we mentioned in that first quote &-um at which the health care system is directly responsible for &-um Marshall C Eakin &-um says there are two two main factors that have facilitated the spread of AIDS . 1408275_1424535
&-um the first is the poorly regulated blood supply &-um transfusions etcetera &-um Bruce could you just scroll down a bit . 1425155_1432095
&-um there's a quote &-um that said in nineteen eight seven twenty percent of all cases were reportedly contacted through blood transfusions . 1432745_1440565
compare that with the United States and Europe of one to two percent . 1441165_1443545
that is incredible . 1444285_1445325
+, mhm +/.
+, I think one to two percent &~i is too high . 1445665_1447705
&-um you know I wouldn't wanna go in for a blood transfusion and you know &{l=SIC contact &}l=SIC AIDS so +/. 1448545_1451825
+, mhm +/.
+, that's that's kinda &~a that's too bad and it's a shame . 1452525_1454405
&-um the second factor is &-um just the inability of the health care system to you know adequately hold these people &-um what happens is you have overflows there's not enough beds . 1454405_1466065
so they get discarded +/. 1466725_1467545
+, mhm +/.
+, into the streets &-um basically they become outcasts of society and again we go back to the hierarchy it's all the poor people that get thrown out first +/. 1468625_1474925
+, mhm +/.
+, so what happens is whether it be drugs needles they just it's a vicious cycle they continue to spread the virus &-um now &-uh we can move into abortion . 1475025_1483805
&-um in Brazil &-um illegal abortion has become a increasing problem . 1485945_1491465
according to &{l=SIC Myron &}l=SIC Eakin &-uh &{l=READING sexual promiscuity and traditional patriarchal politics combine to result in a vast amount of illegal abortions &}l=READING so basically there's a_lot_of people in Brazil who wanna have sex and the male dominated political realm doesn't care about &-um females' health issues or their health rights . 1491915_1511075
so they don't care to make it legal &-um get into that in a little bit . 1511775_1514975
&-um so &-uh what happens is many &~th <of the> of the abortions in Brazil are performed in back alleys &-um in fly by night clinics . 1515505_1523445
&-um obviously they're unsanitary and they're very dangerous and it's led to the hospitalization of over four hundred thousand women and the deaths of nearly four hundred women in Brazil . 1524285_1532245
&-um now back to the hierarchy of class . 1532865_1536905
the rich women they have access to information &~w of whereabouts the good clinics are . 1537385_1542965
&-um where they can receive a physician underground so to speak and &-um they also have the money to do it so the poor are left with you know paying two hundred dollars for a barber you know to basically +/. 1543425_1556385
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ cut them up ⌋ . 1556645_1556945
so &-um you know that's basically the gist of that . 1557625_1561005
&-um Eakin concludes &{l=READING it's clear that this human tragedy should be blamed primarily on political culture dominated by men who have shown little concern for women's issues . 1561585_1568845
&}l=READING &-um now the economics of abortion I'm taking &-uh Economics one oh one here microeconomics and we have this &-uh kind of supplementary book and it there was a section on abortion and I just want to share a little bit of that with you in the nineteen seventies the United States legalized abortion . 1569385_1583845
and what this did was a_lot_of the physicians who were scared to perform the abortions prior to that came out . 1585025_1591505
now we start getting more and more of those physicians you know as it goes from the seventies to the eighties to the nineties &-um that increases &-um actually decreases the health concerns or health &-um the dangers in the health &-um +/. 1591985_1605045
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ for that ⌋ and what happens is economically when you have more firms or more &-um people in a market . 1605405_1611985
what's gonna happen is competition's gonna increase so the price is gonna lower so now many more women are able to get these abortions in the United States . 1612165_1618525
and in fact now and this quote is from &-uh the middle nineteen nineties &-um nearly all health related problems have ceased in the United States &-um regarding abortions . 1618445_1628745
so this could be a &~po possible &-um solution to Brazil's illegal abortions problem and &-um as a closing statement in the words of Leslie German &-uh in Brazil &{l=READING if Brazil wants to keep &-uh help its poor it will have to change its health care system . 1629065_1643265
&}l=READING and that's health care . 1644225_1645525
&=applause (0.12) .
okay . 1662945_1663165
&-um I'm gonna talk about the &~Univers okay &~d first of all do you +//. 1663385_1667665
have any of you heard about the Universal &~Decala Declaration of Human Rights ? 1668045_1671585
&=reading_throughout_utterance well Brazil happens to be a signatory of this declaration along with a whole &~b &-um other countries and the main purpose of this Universal Declaration of Human Rights is to give citizens of Brazil and other countries &~fundamenta fundamental rights which they deserve . 1672765_1686885
for example Article One states that &{l=READING all human beings are born free and equal in rights and dignity . 1687925_1693465
&}l=READING unfortunately there are examples of when human rights of individuals and social groups have been violated in Brazil . 1694325_1700145
so then who defends the human rights of these minority groups and &~indivi individuals ? 1701205_1704685
and who ensures that this declaration will be enforced ? 1705105_1707885
the human rights defenders risk their lives safety and peace of mind to defend others . 1708905_1713605
human rights defenders vary from everyday citizens to state officials . 1714255_1718135
often these people are subjected to threats intimidation and even death squads . 1719495_1723915
and I have two examples of how these defenders &-um have been intimidated . 1724615_1729255
this is a example of intimidation . 1729515_1730715
&-um human rights activists Mato_Grosso_Do_Sul &-um &~Gi Giselle_Marques_De_Carvalho_Fontoura and Andenilso_Dos_Santos_Assuncao and other staff members of a Human Rights Center Centro@s:fra de@s:fra Defesa@s:fra dos@s:fra Direitos@s:fra Humanos@s:fra Marcal@s:fra de@s:fra Souza@s:fra Tupa-y@s:fra began receiving death threats in October in nineteen ninety seven after the discovery of a cemetery that possibly contained &~rema remains of &-um death squad &~vis victims . 1731425_1761405
allegedly these people were killed by policemen from the Frontier Operations Department . 1764075_1769175
Andenilso dos &~San Santos Assuncao researched the killings and disappearance of two hundred and seventy six people in the state in nineteen ninety six and nineteen ninety seven and his report presented was presented to the Ministry of Justice in August in nineteen ninety seven . 1770235_1786315
&-um it contained &~ev evidence of the involvement of both civil and military police . 1787035_1791635
&-um in response to this report the delegations from the Human Rights Commission of the Federal Chamber of Deputies visited the region in October twenty third nineteen ninety seven . 1792185_1802165
on that &~e occasion Giselle_Marques_De_Carvalho_Fontoura received anonymous telephone calls about the secret cemetery and cars with unknown occupants began circling her house and parked outside her front gate . 1802945_1815645
so this is just an example of how one person tried to do some investigation and they're these people are intimidated they received phone threats until they're &~eve either forced into go into hiding or &~th even forced to leave their country . 1816185_1831825
and here's an example of how a defender was &-um subjected to death squads . 1832645_1836485
one activist was shot dead on his doorstep and another hadta flee to another part of the country for fear of his life . 1837105_1844205
&~Francsico Francisco_Gilson_Nogueira_De_Carvalho a lawyer at the Center for Human Rights and Collective Memory in Natal &-um the state capital was shot dead by six men outside his house on the twentieth of October in nineteen ninety six . 1844985_1860605
he was killed by thirteen bullets and most of them to the head . 1861325_1864565
he had been working with special commission set up by the State Attorney General in May nineteen ninety five to investigate the activities of the Golden Boys which is a death squad believed to be responsible for numerous killings as_well_as cases of tortures and death threats carried out mainly in poor areas of Natal . 1865025_1889485
since nineteen ninety five allegations had been repeatedly made that the death squad &~operat operated under the deputy &~se of &~secre the deputy &~ze secretary of public security . 1884445_1896625
Francisco_Gilson_Nogueira_De_Carvalho killers his killers have never been found and an official &~of investigation was &~clos closed due to lack of &~e evidence . 1897685_1907465
this just shows that there is a need for an improvement in the &~judi judicial system and prosecution in Brazil . 1907955_1913555
&-um it is sad to see that these people who are defending the defenseless are also subjected to the same harassment that as the people that they're defending . 1914575_1925495
in fact people sometimes even accused the defenders of &-um of defending criminals . 1926455_1932355
not all people view the death squads as violating the human rights of others . 1932825_1937005
many policemen and members of the general public truly believe that some social groups are devoid of rights . 1937805_1943945
like if they're discriminated against and if people people harass them they believe that well they're lower and it doesn't matter because they're not considered at the same level as they are . 1944345_1953885
&-um there is also there're specific articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which defends these specific social groups . 1955035_1961815
for example Article Twenty_Five defends street children by saying that &-um what is it ? 1962335_1967995
&-um by saying that &{l=READING all children shall enjoy the same social protection . 1968875_1972895
mhm +/.
+, so . 1973695_1973895
and then there's another &~qu &-um Article Five defends common &~pris prisoners and indigenous people by saying &{l=READING no one shall be subjected to torture or to &~cr cruel inhumane or &~de degrading treatment or punishment . 1974625_1986085
&}l=READING although Brazilian government seems to be committed to protecting and supporting the human rights of its citizens it &~pon it &~s it seems to be &~commi committed to this by &-um promises made by national legislation and by national humans rights programs which have been established and put into effect by the federal government . 1987445_2005505
however the human rights defenders are the ones who have done most of the work to achieve the importance of human rights in Brazil . 2006325_2012205
although there are still multiple examples of blatant violations of these articles <in the> in the declaration . 2013365_2020085
for example here's an example of &-um discrimination against street children . 2021105_2027545
and also this is also deals with the harassment of defenders too . 2028685_2032185
on October twelfth December nineteen ninety three street educators from the Catholic Church Children's &~Pastor Pastoral Jonas_Beltrao_De_Oliveira and Jonathan Luke Hannay attempted to mediate a confrontation between police and street children . 2032665_2047165
&-um the police started beating a sixteen year+old girl and a &~twe eleven year+old boy . 2048325_2052725
the police then allegedly hit Jonathan Hannay in the stomach and a number of local street traders then started beating up on Jonas Beltrao while people did nothing . 2053335_2062335
he was left semiconscious with a cranial fracture and perforated eardrum . 2062855_2066475
after that &~n incident they both continued to suffer police harassment . 2067055_2071555
so this just goes to show that first of all the street children were being harassed by the policemen and then the policemen &-um were beating up the defenders who were trying to protect the children and then &-um street traders jumped in and started beating up on the defenders . 2072095_2086535
that just shows that like the general public needs to be educated about like human rights in the country so they could team up and &-um defend human rights of each_other . 2087135_2097475
&-um another example is &-um on the thirteenth of November nineteen ninety two the body of a thirteen year+old &-um Jean Alves Da &~Ca Cunha &~hed a leader of the National Streets Children Movement was found dumped on a hillside in Vitoria Espirito Santos state with gunshot wounds to the head and ear . 2098535_2119255
he was last seen on the evening of November eleventh being detained by members of &~justitif justice officials attached to juvenile courts . 2119695_2127955
he was about to attend the Third National Congress of the National Street Children's Movement in Brasilia and at the preparatory meeting he had denounced the local police for putting pressure on street children to commit crimes and share the &~pro proceeds with them . 2128955_2143835
he taped the allegations and expressed fear for his safety . 2144545_2148165
his death had has been linked to a number of similar death &{l=SIC quads &}l=SIC killings allegedly committed by a police organization in the area . 2148785_2156825
the SDLC military police has been accused of his murder and was acquitted in military court in May nineteen ninety seven . 2157685_2165005
so here's another example of when they caught the people who were violating the human rights and again they're acquitted and they weren't prosecuted . 2165185_2174205
furthermore another group of &-um a social class I guess you could say or a group of people which are commonly discriminated against in Brazil are &-um just common prisoners which have been sentenced to prison for petty crimes . 2175505_2188405
&-um on &~Dec the second on October second nineteen twenty two a rebellion erupted in one of &{l=SIC San &}l=SIC Paulo's largest prisidents prisons . 2189025_2198605
la@s:fra Casa@s:fra de@s:fra Detencao@s:fra .
shock troops were sent in to quell the rebellion and when they withdrew eleven hours later a hundred and eleven inmates were dead . 2199205_2208325
eight separate inquiries into the massacre confirmed that most the prisoners had been killed by police while defenseless in their cells . 2209645_2216165
the military justice prosector charged a hundred and twenty military police with homicide attempted homicide and bodily harm describing the massacre as the largest slaughter recorded to date in a single prison in &~th where the world detainees &-um the largest slaughter recorded to date in a single prison in the world . 2216785_2235645
detainees prison sentences were arbitrarily and illicitly turned into death sentences . 2236125_2241305
they were originally sent for petty crimes and they ended up dying for no reason . 2241875_2245775
however the hard work and devotion and persistence of these Human Rights defenders is making a difference in Brazil . 2246915_2252975
the human rights defenders including police have become involved in collaborating in a joint effort to tackle human rights in Brazil +... 2253515_2260815

more women in power at least in the dot-com companies . 3624325_3626765
what do you guys what would you guess one of the implications would be ? 3626985_3632705
well obviously the computer's like of the future so in the future the women are gonna I'm not gonna say take over but they're gonna obviously have equal and there'll be equal amounts of women in in each company . 3633135_3649015
<I feel> &~li I feel like right now though like in at least in the United States &~ev they're equal . 3649195_3652515
like they're looked at equally businesswise except there's not as many as them because because of the past but now I don't know exactly how to put this but I don't know I just feel like this correlation as business goes on the women working will increase . 3652855_3666075

the one of the questions that comes to my mind when he mentioned more women and that they're treated &~weakl equally do you as men and women in this class do you personally feel that you are treated equally as women and do you guys feel that you treat women equally and vice versa ? 3702205_3719425
is that a general ? 3719785_3722145
in this class ? 3722385_3723145

you like you Kelly . 3724225_3728585

⌊ uhuh ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ in ⌉ the room ? 3736415_3736875
yeah . 3737235_3737455
there there is a tendency there there there is some thought that perhaps at least in the the high school level and we still have &-uh &-uh &~Ver what is the name Versar ? 3738155_3750315
&~we we have so many colleges that are female only and that &~is Vassar ? 3750535_3755555
is that the &~r ⌊ correct pronunciation ⌋ ? 3754805_3756465
⌈ Vassar ⌉ .

right .
&-uh and in high school they feel that if it is &-uh not a coed but if it is a women only class and the entire school the girls will achieve and they will perform better and they will get higher grades in tests etcetera . 3756745_3774845
because some girls particularly in high school they feel a bit not that they feel harassed but they they feel that &-um the presence of the guys will &~no not permit them to participate as much . 3774475_3793875
they are reluctant to raise their hands and say that they didn't understand and ask the teacher to explain again &-uh a subject matter . 3793995_3803215
so there are some people that believe in that and they go even to the college . 3803795_3807055
what do you guys think would be the the consequences of that ? 3807675_3810815
