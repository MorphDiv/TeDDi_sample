two and one are independent of each_other +/. 1025_2805
right +/.
+, but and &~s but how does that correlate with three ? 3805_8205
well it doesn't matter . 8925_10345
basically in this case three doesn't matter you don't use rule &~w one and two to see that node two is &~indepen node one is &~inde and node two are independent . 10745_17585
so it doesn't correlate to rule three . 18705_21545
so knowing you could have said knowing three or five and you'd still get the same result that +/. 22525_27085
⌈ you could have said ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ one is independent ⌋ of two . 27045_28205
well you could have said knowing nothing even that node one is independent of node two . 28385_32465
independent node one is ⌈ I guess ⌉ +/. 33505_37645
⌊ so ⌋ +/.
+, I don't understand the table . 37785_38645
⌈ <how does that say> ⌉ .
⌊ okay so this ⌋ is evidence so here the only grayish gray &-um node is three so the only evidence is node three . 39185_45065
here the only evidence is node four . 45545_46805
right I see that but ⌈ independent of ⌉ +/. 47005_48345
+, ⌊ so down here ⌋ so node two was like the punched in stomach in the homework so basically it's saying . 48405_55685
I haven't read through all the ⌈ homework ⌉ . 55745_56365
⌊ if you ⌋ have &~evid oh okay so this is task two . 56405_58365
basically it's saying say you know &-um &-um you have a bunch of causes of abdominal pain in the homework . 58825_65205
so one of them is punched in stomach . 65685_66865
and so the idea is that you &-um want to see all the things that are independent of punched in stomach . 67785_74245
so I was trying to use that analogy but we'll just go back to numbers for now . 74915_78235
so what this is saying is that you wanna look to see what's independent of node two . 78775_82795
so to do that you say let node two be part of group X . 83295_86235
right +/. 86795_86935
+, what else is part of group X ? 87915_89795
&-um and what else is part of group Y ? 90295_93455
and in some cases if there's nothing independent of node two then that means everything is in group X . 93775_99475
there may not be a group Y . 101235_102335
so &-um +... 103755_104515
if you know node three then then this turns gray and you look at the network as if this is evidence and everything else is not evidence . 107375_113855
so you first start at node two and you follow all the paths going out_of node two or coming into node two to see what all's connected and what's not . 114595_122815
and you use these three rules to see where things aren't connected . 123335_126855
obviously if there's no line there then then +//. 127595_130495
say say like if node two and four weren't connected then obviously two and eight would be separate from everything else . 130345_135345
and that's that's an unspoken rule that's not written down . 136105_138405
but in this case you're effectively providing a break by having node one and two follow rule three . 139185_148705
so what this is saying is that the probability +//. 149465_153705
knowing the probability of node two is not going to affect the probability of node one that's what these rules are saying . 154435_160615
+, okay but ⌈ why ⌉ +/. 161215_161695
+, ⌊ given ⌋ that you don't know anything about node four or any of its descendants . 161875_164495
oh okay that's why three isn't included just because since you +//. 165515_168475
it's evidence . 168835_169335
yeah +/.
+, it's +/. 169715_170055
+, ⌈ so yeah so I mean ⌉ +/. 170215_171035
+, ⌊ not really affected ⌋ by anything . 171035_171455
right because you you already know it . 171735_173435
but +/. 174875_175075
⌈ so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ doesn't ⌋ the fact that you know three remove five as evidence ? 175195_178235
I mean three is evidence so that removes five so why is +//. 178555_182135
why do you even have to include five there ? 182545_184105
well so the the table &~i &~i is saying that node two +//. 185045_189025
things that are independent of node two are node one and node five . 189305_192065
okay +/.
+, so node one is independent of node two node five is independent of node two . 193085_196165
+, alright +/.
+, and so node one is independent of node two only by rule three because of this &-um coming into node four &-um node two and one coming into node four . 197245_206545
node five is independent of node two by two different rules so you could either look at node five being independent of node two because this chain is broken by knowing node three or you could look at node five being independent of node two by this third rule . 207055_221675
now I didn't understand your reasoning for if this using node one chain is broken here but that's between five and one how does it relate ⌈ five and two ⌉ ? 223055_232015
⌊ right but the the idea ⌋ is that you could have this network look any way that it wanted to if its only connection to node one +//. 231265_238945
to node five was through node one I mean you try to look and envision yourself following paths +/. 239505_244825
right +/. 245285_245385
+, through the network . 245585_245985
so two could be anywhere in this +/. 246265_247825
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ blob ⌋ down here and it would still be by rule . 248405_250205
right so two could be where node four is obviously at that point node one would not be independent . 250285_255005
with node four . 255985_256505
right +/. 256945_257245
+, or which +//. 257565_258085
but node three still breaks five off from the rest of the network . 258595_262275
+, okay +/.
+, because ⌈ <you know &~i> ⌉ . 263995_264095
⌊ so that's just ⌋ because just since you put two in here that that you're saying what's independent of two that you hadta use three or one . 264115_272075
right so you have to choose . 272335_273135
okay (be)cause two and eight could be switched and it would be the same . 273355_275555
yeah +/. 275935_275975
+, okay . 276175_276355
mhm +...
okay so &-um why don't you ask me about specific entries +/. 276595_283135
+, in here . 283335_283495
how about &-uh evidence four so is one and seven independent ? 284475_287615
so one and seven . 288795_290775
exercise one .
yeah . 292135_294435
so this is just a_couple_of entries in there . 294855_299335
yeah I'm &~no this is not complete . 299755_301235
&-um the idea was is that I was giving examples of all of it so one and seven is analogous to two and six and two and seven . 301975_310115
because again it's the chain . 310655_312055
so the chain two four six and two four seven is exactly the same &-um separationwise as +/. 312915_320575
⌈ they're both independent ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ one four seven ⌋ and one four six . 320815_322075
okay so like five you're looking at like this ? 322435_325035
and like one of these ? 326155_327055
five and &~si . 327235_327935
so for five and six ? 328135_329615
right +/.
+, yeah so I'm going up the chain here +/. 329855_332775
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and ⌋ saying okay well five is connected to three which is connected to one and so then I'm looking at one at that point and saying how is one connected to these ? 333595_341135
and one is separated from seven and six because you have node four as ⌈ evidence ⌉ . 341635_345975
⌊ okay ⌋ . 345975_346115
so that means all of these +//. 346755_347935
since this breaks the chain +/. 348815_350435
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ this ⌋ would be independent of that but then since this is one thing all of these are independent +/. 350835_354355
+, right +/.
+, of that +/. 354475_354835
+, yeah +/. 354975_355115
+, okay .
oh okay . 355335_355455
so that's one of the reasons I didn't put it all in the +/. 355655_358355
⌈ right ⌉ +/. 358455_358555
+, ⌊ table ⌋ so +... 358555_358975
alright what else ? 361545_362565
(0.4) .
&-um . 364945_366205
so an example of this &~s &~s second rule I mean the second rule probably is the easiest one to look at (be)cause you have the the &~f the the four six seven type of relationship which just says <if you know> if you know node four then &-um <it breaks> it breaks things off so here you have six is independent of everything . 367165_385405
so six is independent of seven by rule two . 386305_388525
and six is independent of everything else by rule one . 389115_391535
I wrote rule one there but it's +//. 392835_394935
when it's all it's probably more than one rule so six is independent of seven by rule two . 395735_399655
okay . 401695_402055
(0.4) .
<may I> &~a may I ask a quick question ? 405475_407375

(o)kay I mean this +//. 484795_485375
you +//.
this way is it correct or not ? 486535_487475

I mean even in part A this true is &~in independent right ? 524465_528745
mm they're not independent . 529545_530945
how &~ho why are they independent ? 531385_532865
&-uh <lemme see> . 533205_533865

+, ⌊ talking ⌋ d@l separationwise they're not independent because you don't know on time or healthy . 534925_538445

four I mean . 593785_595165
for this ? 595485_596285
yeah and probability of sunset and the conditionals I mean theory is that we should write a true false and false true or false false . 596765_605625
okay +/. 605805_605905

&-uh in part A you mean we have &-uh . 611985_614785
(be)cause you don't know anything about the network in part A right ? 614965_617745

okay +/. 643845_643905

it should be probability +//. 846945_850845

there is only one evidence &=background_conversation . 1367385_1368365
okay . 1368585_1368725
yeah then these are dependent also because this is dependent through this one through this one and then to that one . 1368945_1374865
so +/. 1375385_1376665
⌊ I want to know ⌋ +/.

+, &-uh huh +/.
+, oh .
so I mean &~th &~th the way to do this is to follow chains through the network . 1392915_1397315
&-um so when you have this as evidence now you have a chain that goes from there to there . 1398235_1402295
mhm +/.
+, and so now anything that's connected to this node +/. 1402615_1405495

+, can follow the same chain . 1406455_1407795
+, so this one is connected to this one . 1409775_1411535
and then that's connected to this one . 1411835_1413055
and then that one's connected to that one . 1413175_1414475
so you've effectively created a single chain of dependency . 1415255_1418435
&-um if &-uh I want to know the dependence property's transitive I mean A and B are &~depen A is dependent to B +/. 1419295_1429075

mhm +/.
+, this one is &~in independent and this one right ? 1501835_1504575
those are independent yeah . 1504815_1505715
because of this this connection the two arrows going to that node and this is &-um so the reason those two are independent is because those two arrows going to that node which means that by rule three if you have two &~ind two parents going in like this then the two parents are independent of each_other . 1505845_1523985

it looks like you took a point off for using the extra operator and and I was confused on that because the instructions said use the same operators for the UC POP that you used in the STRIPS example . 1623185_1632685
right well the the operator +//. 1632985_1633985

I think problem set four was the great equalizer for people who had been working hard and making a few mistakes here and there and the people that had been not working that hard because everybody that didn't work that hard in problem set four made a bad grade . 1725305_1739425

you <didn't ran> task four to <look like> look like this ? 1909795_1913035
you know you're supposed to get these . 1913235_1915495
right but you hafta be able to get these based on these independent probabilities . 1915815_1919135
so how are you gonna do that ? 1919495_1921675
I don't know work it ⌊ out ⌋ ? 1923155_1923795
⌈ yeah ⌉ say it's it's it says here and you can use the noisy or@q relation to calculate the conditional probability . 1923795_1927795
oh +/. 1928755_1929275
+, so that's that's why it was really . 1930335_1932215
oh so +/.
⌊ it was important for me to get that example out ⌋ . 1933185_1934785
+, ⌈ &~i <it's a> it's a advantage ⌉ to use noisy or@q . 1934785_1936305
yeah because it's a_lot easier to do the calculations . 1936465_1938505
I see . 1939145_1939645
and in fact you don't have all the information you need there to do anything but noisy or@q because you don't have all of the combined conditional probabilities . 1939925_1947905
well so we we just have to submit like this something like this ? 1949625_1952485
yeah mhm +/. 1952705_1953885
+, okay .
and this +//. 1953985_1954245
these were given . 1954525_1954945
+, right +/. 1955345_1955605
+, okay .
so these two . 1956565_1957385
yeah so +/. 1958525_1959705
these two are +/.
+, you should probably use noisy or@q for some of those . 1960285_1961905
oh .
and like here number one I can just &-uh say I break it down and like I can say just finally &~y &~y you really need this like that +/. 1965585_1974845
yeah mhm +/. 1975205_1975745
+, just ⌊ say ⌋ . 1975825_1976685
⌈ yeah ⌉ that's fine &~s so you say yeah if I know this then +... 1976725_1979805
yeah (0.4) . 1980405_1982345
mm .
and obviously you're gonna be writing insufficient at least once or else it wouldn't make sense to have +/. 1988265_1993345
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ that ⌉ problem .
there may be more than that +/. 1993965_1995385
+, oh +/.
+, so .
and here this is the way you want it right ? 1997185_1999065
⌊ given ⌋ .
⌈ evidence ⌉ is &-um &~abdominal ⌊ pain ⌋ +/. 1999945_2002565
⌈ pain ⌉ +/.
+, and .
<and then> &~w and then what's ⌊ independent of this ⌋ . 2003665_2005565
⌈ independent variable ⌉ question stuff yep . 2005665_2006825
<and nothing of> . 2007585_2008165
right well so so in the the d@l separation table I was just giving you a whole bunch of different examples . 2008785_2013385
oh +/.
+, but this one it's a_lot harder network to follow everything through but the idea is the same that you just have like some number here and some number there and you wanna see ⌊ what's independent ⌋ . 2014185_2023365
⌈ and this will be ⌉ this is will be ⌊ this ⌋ . 2023365_2024625
⌈ that ⌉ would be what the answer is . 2024665_2025865
it may or may not be big I mean you have to trace through the network and see what's independent of different things . 2027105_2032325
okay +/. 2032745_2032945
+, so like starting out I'll give you one answer which is ordinarily by rule three which is the one that says if you don't know abdominal pain then the two parent nodes are independent ordinarily punched in stomach and cancer would be independent . 2032995_2046575
but now that you know abdominal pain rule three doesn't apply anymore so punched in stomach and cancer are dependent so you can't put cancer in this column . 2047395_2056115
right . 2058855_2059135
⌊ so ⌋ .
⌈ so ⌉ then like something like this would be independent . 2060795_2062675
right ?
well I don't know is it ? 2063575_2065195
&-uh no +/.
+, &~y &~y mean you have to find +/. 2066175_2068175
+, find +/.
+, one of the rules that make it independent in order for it to be independent . 2068375_2071455
so what rule would make those two independent ? 2071595_2075535
&=flipping_papers:S7 you just picked it up the example that . 2078835_2081555
like here it's like smaller but this is like a_lot bigger . 2082935_2087415
right but the arrows were also pointing in different directions in some cases . 2088575_2091675
so this is a very different network . 2093035_2095195
very different from this one +/. 2096135_2096975
+, yeah .
mean it has examples of stuff in it but I didn't want to give you the same network or else you wouldn't have to do much thinking . 2097995_2103215
&=laughs .
mm .
so like +... 2103815_2106135
mm .
(0.7) <how would you> how would you go about like &-uh <doing (th)em over> here ? 2116385_2119185
like you have three here have three you can see see that but like . 2119445_2122865
well so if you want you can just redraw things so you can say you know if this is node two and this is node four and this is node one then you could pretend that's node three . 2123805_2135085
right ? 2135985_2137145
so I mean you're still ignoring these connections you have to follow those through also but basically you look through and you say is there a connection from this node to this node ? 2140465_2148785
so you first would follow this path and say well is this a connection or is there something that d@l separates those ? 2149365_2155145
so you'd say well this doesn't d@l separate it because you have this as evidence . 2155765_2159045
and since you don't have allergy as evidence this by rule two would be separated only if allergy were evidence . 2159885_2168405
so there's no way to separate itch from punched in stomach using those three rules . 2169365_2174125
if by this path they were separated then you would need to go up this path and say are they separated this way ? 2174525_2184705
because they're not separated if there's at least one path that you can follow and say nope this <isn't separated nope that> isn't separated nope that isn't separated . 2184905_2192605
oh so like go here match if +/. 2193205_2196225
yeah +/.
+, <if it's> if it's not +//. 2196585_2196945
if it's dependent go back here or like ⌊ dependent ⌋ . 2197005_2199385
⌈ right ⌉ so keep following all of the dependencies until you get to something that's independent . 2199385_2203205
I see +/.
+, and if say if you follow this through and found that this was independent of this then you would need to try all the other paths too which in this case is through there . 2203525_2213805
so if this is independent but this is dependent then this is still +//. 2214625_2219325
then there is a dependency between the two so you have to find to see if every path between two nodes is independent . 2220735_2227015
by those d@l separations . 2229095_2230095
oh .
and and this this meant &-uh this and this right ? 2231135_2234575
right . 2234855_2235175
oh okay +/.
+, so that means that that those are both gray shaded areas so &-um +... 2235295_2239755
like here I I don't get &-uh what what noisy or is . 2241715_2246735
okay so what noisy or@q is is you are approximating +... 2247155_2251775
&-um get get these again get these off the web page . 2253475_2256995
that is what that email was about . 2257215_2258255
&-um . 2258975_2259135
so noisy or@q is basically when you &~g are given probabilities only in terms of one of the causes you try to have some way to combine them . 2259875_2272375
so what this is saying is would it make sense +/. 2274175_2278915
to model +/.
+, to model abdominal pain as noisy or@q because you already have four causes you have +/. 2279535_2283835
+, yeah +/.
+, allergy stress cancer and punched in stomach . 2284075_2286015
so . 2287335_2287395
you +//.
I would say yes . 2287935_2288615
well why ? 2289895_2290695
because &-uh this &-uh depends on one of these four ? 2291395_2296495
well so it does depend on one of those four but &-um +... 2297935_2300675
does it make sense to combine the four independently ? 2301635_2303995
mm +/.
+, well so basically what you're doing here is you're saying the three causes are independent &~e of each_other so +/. 2304995_2314235
+, oh because these are independent of each_other ? 2314735_2316255
+, that's that's basically what you're saying here is that &-um I have some probability U that this is gonna happen but then I combine that with this one . 2316275_2323615
oh so if there was a some connection these &~the you wouldn't have &-uh use &-uh noisy or@q ? 2324255_2328835
well you still can +/. 2328995_2330395
you still can ? 2330575_2330955
+, but basically what &~y &~wha what this +//. 2330975_2332855
&~wha what they want you to do here is to try to think about several things one are those four really the only causes of abdominal pain ? 2333235_2341055
+, mkay +/.
+, so think that just just ⌊ common ⌋ +/. 2343715_2344835
+, ⌈ not ⌉ +/.
+, sense . 2345075_2345335
+, mhm +/.
+, if they're not then you know maybe noisy or@q by itself is not sufficient . 2345615_2350335
maybe you need to add extra things to get those probabilities . 2351005_2355125
because if you're gonna do this noisy or@q computation you're gonna pretend like these are the only causes of abdominal pain . 2356925_2365385
so so you could still use or if there was something connection here ? 2366905_2369705
well I mean you can always use noisy or@q because you can ignore everything else because you have these simple tables . 2371045_2375785
but when you have things connected it's harder to consider them to be independent . 2376545_2379885
so in this case &-um do you have dependencies between the three &-uh +/. 2381285_2384705
four ?
+, three nodes ? 2385785_2386125
+, ⌊ these these four ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ when you're trying to pair (th)em ⌉ . 2386525_2387725
yeah .
and then see .
are they independent or dependent ? 2388665_2393105
looks like they're independent . 2394125_2395905
that's what it looks like yeah if you don't know abdominal pain . 2396945_2399085
so maybe in this case that wouldn't be a problem for noisy or@q . 2399665_2402385
(0.5) .
hm ?
okay so you don't have these direct connections then in this network right ? 2408155_2412535
yeah &~i it looks like these are independent . 2412735_2413975
mkay so that's one of the factors that you might want to consider for noisy or@q and another one is the fact that you don't know &~tha that these four causes are not complete . 2414735_2425215
is is +/. 2425495_2427035
⌊ so ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ noisy or@q based on just this two ⌉ . 2427435_2430215
⌊ I mean all noisy or@q is ⌋ . 2430455_2430575
not looking at these ? 2430575_2431195
right . 2431275_2431515
yeah . 2432115_2432135
so &~i if this +//. 2432375_2433235
&~th it's saying these won't cause +//. 2433895_2435435
that these won't cause this ? 2436075_2437375
⌈ you can &~u ⌉ . 2438115_2438255
⌊ well ⌋ so what it's saying is that those well those cause allergy but noisy or@q does not trace back up the tree . 2438475_2445175
I mean it +/. 2446095_2446375
⌈ oh noisy or doesn't ⌉ +/. 2446495_2446715
+, ⌊ it's a very simple ⌋ model it just looks +/. 2446715_2448455
+, yeah +/.
+, independently at each of its parent nodes and says okay I've +//. 2449635_2452395
I hafta have these tables for what the probability is of this node given each of the parents independently . 2452675_2458655
but it doesn't try to put them together &-um based on whatever the rest of the the belief network structure is . 2459165_2465085
all it cares about is just this local model . 2466525_2469185
so that's one of the &~p approximations that it makes . 2471365_2473925
and it also +//. 2475665_2477125
there's there +//. 2477465_2477885
you don't have any information like maybe if you have cause A you know that cause B is not gonna happen or maybe if cause A doesn't happen you know cause B is not gonna happen . 2478085_2486925
but you don't have any of that information here . 2487365_2489225
so like maybe in this case you have that &-um &-uh let's see maybe if you &-uh are not under stress you know that you're not gonna get punched in the stomach . 2491765_2501045
that +//. 2502945_2503065
this is just an example it's +//. 2503385_2504465
so if that was the case then noisy or@q would not work very well ⌈ because ⌉ . 2505545_2511205
⌊ &~wa ⌋ wait if you're under stress you're not . 2511605_2512605
so if you knew that when you weren't under stress that you &~w also wouldn't get punched in the stomach +/. 2512945_2517185
yeah okay +/.
+, then noisy or@q would not be a good model because you had a connection +/. 2517865_2521085
+, okay xxx +/.
+, between stress and &~poin punched in the stomach which noisy or@q doesn't model . 2521385_2524965
because you take +//. 2525965_2527625
for noisy or you just take the probabilities of these independently put them together . 2527865_2531765
so if these nodes are independent then that makes sense to put them together like that but if they are dependent then maybe it doesn't make as much sense to put them together . 2533235_2544035
&=flipping_papers:S7 so basically what that question is for is they want you to read in the textbook everything that it says about noisy or@q ask us in office hours to see how much we'll tell you and then kind_of just write a paragraph that says noisy or@q will or will not work because blah blah blah . 2547955_2561895
if they are conflicting pieces of information like maybe &~s one thing will support the use of noisy or@q and one thing won't support the use of noisy or@q write down everything that you can think of and say well based on this evidence I would or would not use noisy or@q because there are these reasons . 2562195_2576835
so you have to choose but there may be some factors that would allow it to work ⌈ and some that wouldn't ⌉ . 2577135_2581795
⌊ like like ⌋ like here ? 2582135_2582655

yep . 2586095_2586335
mhm +...
yeah so is that the way the network changes ? 2589525_2591145

mhm .
okay +/. 2594065_2594345
+, right . 2595505_2595625
so in this case the nodes that are coming in to on time aren't connected to each_other . 2596145_2600065
they're independent . 2601405_2601945
these are independent ? 2603305_2603905

noisy or@q makes a_lot_of sense because they're not related to ⌈ each_other ⌉ . 2605645_2607885
⌊ but ⌋ what about here this isn't independent right ? 2607885_2609845

so were you using noisy or@q for that ? 2610485_2611885
(0.4) .

I mean the noisy or@q what are you calculating with that ? 2617295_2619335
you're calculating things &~invo involving . 2620475_2623275
<&~sun sunset> .

it would be a good idea to use this set and <noisy or@q> noisy or@q ? 2634955_2637675

yeah it's an approximation . 2682655_2683315
so what I was saying is it's a better approximation if the parents are independent . 2684555_2688655
but you can still use it as an approximation anyway . 2689075_2691375
it just might not be as accurate if if the various parents' values probability values are independent of each_other . 2692235_2697775

talk louder . 3221605_3226545
&=laughs right so the key here is that you know the independence relation right so you know that the probability of A and B is equal to the probability of A times the probability of B . 3228175_3237015
right +/. 3237435_3237455
+, so that way you can cancel out &-um so you know that that's equal . 3238215_3242415
so the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of A . 3242615_3245755
let's see if this helps us here in . 3246415_3247755
well well now I hafta hafta rewrite my original statement . 3250515_3255015
I'm looking for the probability of H given e@l one and e@l two . 3255155_3258675
mhm +/.
+, so it's either in <that form or> that form or that form . 3259635_3262175
+, mhm +/.
I can rewrite either of these as a probability of E times +... 3263255_3272075
these two are equal .
+, mhm +/.
+, these denominators +...
those the +//.
wait those denominators are equal ? 3277475_3281455
sure . 3281855_3282275
probability of e@l one given e@l two is the same as the probability of e@l two given e@l one ? 3283035_3286655
if they're independent . 3286735_3287915
<no no> no no no . 3288115_3289535
this is the probability of e@l one and this is the probability of e@l two right ? 3289695_3292815
if they're independent you +/. 3293795_3294875
⌊ oh ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ just <go on> ⌉ independency . 3295095_3295895
oh .
okay +...
okay . 3296255_3296495
(0.10) .
so you can figure out from these what the probability of e@l one and what the probability of e@l two is right ? 3310785_3317445
well I'm not so sure now let me just work on it a little bit ⌊ (be)cause ⌋ . 3318645_3322145
⌈ okay ⌉ .
I kind of don't see . 3323885_3324765
&=laughs .
alright go off and see if you can calculate those two first and then that might help . 3325085_3328285
hello . 3329365_3333865
just let me get some &-uh orange soda <and then> I'll be right with you . 3334585_3337425
okay .
there's no one here where is everyone ? 3341445_3343045
I mean like there's lots_of four ninety two people here but at the beginning of the term there were lots_of office hours now . 3343925_3349845
okay .
&-uh can you explain a little bit of <&-uh reasons> . 3350845_3354965
okay . 3355245_3355485
yeah +/. 3355865_3356065
+, &-um so the best way to explain this is by examples so what example do you want me to explain or examples where do you want me to start ? 3356605_3364605
yeah I mean okay for number &-uh xxx two and five &-uh . 3364605_3368505
two and five ? 3368845_3369285
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
⌈ okay ⌉ so if you imagine here that node three is the shaded node +/. 3369325_3374665
okay +/.
+, because it's evidence +/. 3375965_3376645
+, yeah +/. 3377025_3377045
+, then if you go from node five what you're trying to see is is there a path between node two and node five . 3377725_3384525
but there's no paths here (be)cause it's it ⌊ <you are linkless> ⌋ . 3384985_3387625
⌈ well but they do +//. 3387625_3388165
⌉ don't pay attention to the arrows I mean you can go backwards on an arrow if it doesn't get split by one of these rules . 3388265_3392965
so ⌊ here ⌋ . 3394865_3395345
⌈ so the ⌉ direction of the link is not . 3395405_3397045
well it's important but +... 3397215_3399015
for example if four were evidence then one and two are not independent anymore because rule three only applies if node four is not evidence . 3400735_3411355
yeah but I mean now three is evidence . 3411555_3414015
but ⌊ we don't ⌋ +/. 3414655_3415215
⌈ right so ⌉ +/.
+, have any paths from two to five . 3415415_3416915
not directly but the idea is that if node two and node one are dependent and node one and node five are dependent then node two and node five are dependent also . 3417085_3425265
because there is a direct path between them . 3427025_3430185
⌊ it's not direct but there is ⌋ . 3430565_3431265
⌈ so put them ⌉ in a direct paths . 3431265_3432905
well so I mean that you can follow and say node two is dependent on four node four is dependent on <node six> node six is dependent on whatever's below it . 3432985_3440165
so you can follow a path between node two and node eight +/. 3440825_3443905
⌊ yeah I understand ⌋ .
+, ⌈ <or whatever> ⌉ and say that none of these rules apply so there there's a chain of dependency . 3444565_3449765
so in this case node two and node five is kind_of a bad example because they're way independent . 3451105_3455945
so in this case you look at node two and you say well this is the only path between node two and node five . 3456965_3462225
two four one three five . 3462785_3464225
so then you say well okay I'm gonna follow this path . 3465265_3467505
is node two and node four dependent ? 3467645_3470165
yes they are so keep going +/. 3470305_3471645
+, mhm +/.
+, is node two and node one dependent you're gonna hate this grammar &=laughs:multiple node two and node one &-um dependent . 3472405_3479185
well the answer is no because rule three breaks node two and node one . 3479905_3484385
okay so what do you mean by path by paths ? 3485065_3488285
⌊ I mean <I was> talking about xxx ⌋ .
⌈ well what I mean by &~pa &~let's ⌉ let's look at one that is dependent . 3488585_3491605
let's say node four is given as evidence . 3491845_3494905
okay . 3495585_3495745
+, and you're trying to see if node two and node five are independent of each_other . 3496185_3500125
+, uhuh +/.
+, okay . 3501655_3501935
so you start at node two and you say well okay is node two dependent on node four yes ? 3502035_3506775
+, yeah . 3506995_3507215
+, is node two dependent on node one ? 3507775_3509435
yes because rule three doesn't apply anymore . 3510155_3513335
so you can go from node two to node four to node one and you see that they are dependent on each_other . 3514435_3520735
+, okay +/. 3521455_3521735
+, which is basically saying if you know the value of node one does that affect the probability of node two and the answer is yes if you know the value of node four also . 3521775_3530095
+, okay +/. 3531115_3531135
+, that's what that rule's saying . 3531315_3532235
so now you have that node two and node one are dependent so now you can keep going so now you can say well is node one dependent on node three ? 3533695_3541835
yes +/. 3542155_3542875
+, mhm +/.
+, so that means that node two is dependent on node three . 3543555_3546055
+, okay +/. 3546315_3546535
+, so now is node three dependent on node five ? 3546535_3548495
yes +/. 3549415_3549835
+, mhm +/.
+, so that means that node two is dependent on node five . 3550935_3552835
alright then okay so so if <when you> when you said &-uh node two is dependent on node one which means if you know node one you will know node two . 3555115_3569435
it doesn't mean you'll know node two it means that that may affect the probability of node two because when you have these tables you're gonna have +//. 3570155_3575935
you might have a table that says node two &-um well if you know node four then &{l=SIC node's &}l=SIC two's probability changes whether four is true or false . 3576295_3587735
okay . 3588915_3589895
okay . 3590455_3590855
so because say there was a hundred percent probability that node four would be true +/. 3591135_3594455
mhm +/.
+, if node two was true and a zero percent chance of &~n if +//. 3595015_3597395
of four being true if two was false so then you know &-um &~tha &~tha if the value of this affects the value of that . 3598095_3604875
okay .
okay so now say you know the value of four say it's true and you also know the value of one say it's false . 3605475_3613055
mhm +/.
+, now say node four has a probability of zero +/. 3613555_3617495
+, mhm +/.
+, when node one and two are both false . 3619175_3621695
+, okay . 3622415_3622575
+, so if you know node four is true node one's false then you know node two hasta be true . 3623055_3626875
+, okay +/. 3627475_3627515
+, so that's how that dependency relationship &~i &~i that's that's kind_of the extreme case of how you can see that node one or &~t and two are related when you know node four . 3627655_3635535
+, okay . 3636075_3636355
+, so that's why rule three is here . 3636595_3638395
so you can +//. 3639455_3640475
similarly you can do the same thing for rules one and two &-um if you know the value of ⌊ node three ⌋ . 3640935_3646695
⌈ so ⌉ if you can apply the rule which means dependent . 3646795_3649815
&~ye &~w well if you &~w can apply the rule that means it's independent . 3650545_3653465
independent .
yeah .
so how about this &-uh this one &-uh if given node four ⌊ &-uh ⌋ . 3654665_3660265
given node ⌈ four ⌉ ? 3660385_3660985
⌊ node ⌋ four how about &-uh one and seven they are dependent ⌈ on each_other ⌉ . 3661185_3665185
⌊ okay ⌋ they're well so does it &~fol so node four becomes shaded if you know it . 3665185_3669245
yeah +/. 3669385_3669545
+, ⌈ so ⌉ .
⌊ so ⌋ you can apply rule one . 3669845_3671645
you can apply rule one . 3671685_3672625
⌈ so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so ⌋ what does that tell you ? 3672765_3673465
they are independent ? 3674305_3674925
right . 3675145_3675425
and why it's not here . 3675885_3677605
well it's not here because I only had &~spec if you noticed that I'm I'm only looking at part this woulda been a huge chart if I'd done everything . 3677695_3683595
okay +/.
+, so I'm only looking to see what's independent of nodes two five and six because they cover the different areas of the graph . 3684375_3690935
so I'm looking to see what's independent of node two what's independent of node ⌈ five what's ⌉ +/. 3691835_3694975
+, ⌊ okay &~s ⌋ +/.
+, independent of six . 3695155_3695375
so for node four you can say okay what's independent of node five ? 3695535_3699275
+, uhuh +/.
+, so node five's connected to node three which is connected to node one so those are all dependent . 3701045_3707925
so ⌈ basically ⌉ +/. 3708445_3708865
⌊ so ⌋ +/.
+, for node five you &-uh you have paths to any node here . 3709705_3713945
from node five no . 3714245_3715065
because from node five you connected all the way down to node four +/. 3715325_3718885
mhm +/.
+, but now since you know node four by rule one +/. 3719285_3723725
+, mhm +/.
+, four one and seven are different are are separated right ? 3724965_3728565
+, mhm +/.
+, and one and six are separated . 3729525_3731105
so that means you can't keep going through node four to six and seven from five . 3731965_3735985
so five is separated from node seven because when you go five three one and then four four separates one from seven so that path doesn't exist anymore . 3737305_3747385
how about eight ? 3748105_3748645
so eight the path is +//. 3748825_3751525
does exist there because since you know node four +/. 3752405_3754425
uhuh +/.
+, you go five three one four +/. 3754885_3757165
+, mhm +/.
+, and then ordinarily you would apply rule three but since you know node four +/. 3758025_3762405
+, uhuh +/.
+, rule three doesn't apply anymore . 3763065_3764725
because you can't know &-um this node in order for these to be separated . 3765185_3769685
okay so . 3771225_3771705
so now one and two are dependent so you can go five three one four two eight . 3772345_3778925
one and two are dependent . 3779365_3781265
right . 3781465_3781685
because the only way they could be independent is if you could apply one of these rules . 3781745_3786245
okay so this rule is for independent . 3787545_3789565
yeah . 3790225_3790345
okay . 3790685_3790845
so now given four one and two are dependent . 3791305_3795305
&~th yeah . 3795645_3795945
uhuh whereas if you didn't know four one and two would be independent . 3796265_3799425
okay . 3799565_3799685
so given four these two are dependent but +/. 3799985_3802665
mhm +/.
+, six and seven are independent . 3803345_3804805
right because of rule one . 3805185_3806325
because rule two or rule one ? 3806845_3808405
rule &~ru well six and seven are independent of each_other but five is independent from six and seven . 3808815_3813275
no I mean six and seven are . 3813335_3815015
yeah . 3815075_3815275
they're independent . 3815535_3816015
⌈ independent ⌉ .
⌊ because ⌋ of rule two . 3816335_3816955
yes exactly . 3817255_3817975
okay . 3818415_3818655
alright .
&=laughs:S2 .
alright I I have another question about this tree +... 3820215_3826215
so I actually this table like this number point nine means &-uh the probability of on time given ⌈ no accident ⌉ . 3829235_3836675
⌊ no accident ⌋ .
yes .
right ? 3837085_3837305
mhm .
so well if I want to calculate this on time and health given no accident +/. 3837325_3844405
mhm +/.
+, I shouldn't multiply by point seven right ? 3845445_3848685
you shouldn't do what ? 3849025_3850765
I mean how to calculate this . 3852145_3853865
do I need to have point seven here or not ? 3856245_3858565
(0.5) .
yeah but break that down first . 3863545_3866485
no I mean if my question is I &~di I don't know if I should have point seven here or not ? 3867865_3876445
okay do you have your example from class ? 3876665_3878025
did you take notes in class when . 3878125_3879585
mm no I I mean I I'm just confused (be)cause given no accident these two should be independent . 3880365_3886385
(0.4) .
yeah uhuh . 3887445_3890785
right ? 3890825_3891005
mhm .
so I should have this I think the probability of this is just point nine times point six . 3891665_3899025
<no no> no no because you're given no accident well &~o well &~s so are you given no accident which task are you doing ? 3899925_3906085
mm I'm trying to doing task one but I want to ⌈ calculate this first ⌉ . 3907585_3912145
⌊ you're not given ⌋ okay you're &~y you're not given no accident . 3912145_3913985
so ordinarily how you would look at this &~i &~i &~i &~i is that you would say that this hadta be multiplied by the probability of no accident in_order_to get +//. 3914175_3923135
give you the probability of so what you're looking for is the &~o the probability of on time and health right ? 3923475_3930775
for part A you're trying to ⌈ to look for ⌉ . 3931715_3934155
⌊ no I mean ⌋ <I mean> I mean I don't ⌈ &-uh ⌉ . 3934235_3935855
⌊ yeah ⌋ okay okay okay yeah ⌈ yeah ⌉ . 3935855_3936875
⌊ I don't xxx ⌋ . 3936895_3937215
⌈ so &~s alright ⌉ . 3937315_3937535
I just want to calculate ⌊ this probability ⌋ . 3938715_3940015
⌈ okay .
<yeah yeah> yeah yeah ⌉ mhm . 3940135_3941275
so should I have point seven here ? 3941355_3943215
<no no> no no no you don't need point seven here ⌊ <to calculate it> ⌋ . 3943275_3945355
⌈ no alright ⌉ +/.
right .
+, so so basically &-uh I get I like from here and I don't have +//. 3946195_3952015
I don't need point three here . 3952655_3954075
<so this is point three here> +/. 3954975_3957135
+, yeah .
mhm +/.
+, yeah .
right .
so the probability of this one should be just a summation of these two ? 3957355_3963335
yeah &-um +/. 3963875_3964955
right +/. 3965495_3965755
+, presuming that you know no accident yeah . 3965975_3968535
<no no> no no I mean this one's not &~no-acci &-uh you have accident so not &~no-as accident . 3969155_3975155
well so . 3976235_3976815
but it's true if then ⌊ &-uh ⌋ . 3976975_3978095
⌈ the ⌉ probability of on time and health +/. 3978095_3979755
mhm +/.
+, is the probability of on time and health given no accident times the probability of no accident plus the probability of on time and health given no accident times the probability of no accident . 3980555_3990935
so you're missing some terms in here so you have to write down that the probability of on time and health is equal to this times the probability of no accident . 3991645_4000045
I think both should be equal (be)cause if you have two like two say A and B and you say the probability of A given B plus probability A given not b@l should be equal to the probability of A . 4000665_4014265
yeah but ⌊ you have to ⌋ . 4015765_4017745
⌈ this should be right ⌉ right ?
no .
why not ? 4020335_4020695
because you have to here you're you're saying you're given no accident here you're saying you're given no accident but you're not given no accident &=sighs:S9 you have some chance of there not being an accident . 4020975_4033235
these two event are &-uh independent . 4033595_4036015
no they're not independent if you have no accident then you can't have no accident . 4036795_4039855
these ones not ⌊ &~no-as accident ⌋ . 4039875_4041435
⌈ right ⌉ . 4041655_4041915
I mean &~th the point is that you can't have both an accident and no accident . 4041975_4046495
that's my point so . 4046555_4047475
they're so they're dependent . 4048025_4048785
they're not independent . 4049365_4050125
okay .
well what .
this is confusing (be)cause you're saying not no accident but oh well . 4050405_4055665
yeah . 4056245_4056305
I mean is this right ? 4056865_4058405
is this equations right ? 4058645_4059785
no . 4060125_4060665
why not ? 4061325_4061685
this equation should be . 4061945_4063185

no it's not . 4064485_4065085
&=laughs:multiple .
⌊ yeah so ⌋ .
⌈ so ⌉ the probability of A is equal to the probability of A ⌊ given B ⌋ . 4066025_4070965

no . 4076405_4076545
it's not . 4077085_4077405
&=sighs:S9 .
so I'm writing this down so that you can look at it and compare them . 4077925_4084065
okay . 4084765_4084865
+, okay . 4085305_4085565
so why do you need these terms they're they're effectively weighting terms because here you you're just saying you're adding the probability of A given B plus the probability of A given not b@l . 4085905_4095785
(0.4) and so what this is saying is that this is the probability of A given B times the probability that you're actually going to be given B . 4100695_4106635
+, okay . 4107195_4107335
+, plus the probability of A given not b@l times the probability that you're actually going to be given not b@l . 4107855_4112815
so the point is that you can't just assume both B and not b@l . 4113815_4117715
which is what you're doing if you don't put in these weighting terms . 4118475_4121075
alright . 4121755_4125055
yeah I'll ⌊ xxx ⌋ . 4126355_4126835
⌈ does ⌉ that make sense ? 4127415_4127975
I mean if not then ⌊ ask another question ⌋ . 4129995_4131355
⌈ yeah ⌉ I know this one is right &=laughs ⌊ but ⌋ . 4131455_4133115
⌈ okay ⌉ yeah and &~y you can see mathematically why this isn't equal +/. 4133375_4136175
yeah +/.
+, to that right ? 4136335_4136695
yeah ⌊ &-uh ⌋ . 4137155_4139175
⌈ (be)cause I ⌉ mean &~th the only way this is gonna be equal to that is it's the probability of B is one and the probability of not b@l is one . 4139175_4144695
and that's impossible . 4145235_4145955
so like if you were to know that B is true +/. 4146435_4149535
mhm +/.
+, then the probability of not b@l would be zero . 4150495_4152155

⌈ so you would ⌉ be left with that . 4152595_4154235

alright so .
and +... 4158215_4158475
&=flipping_papers in in task one &-uh I can prove it's sufficient but how about in case it's it's not &~s &~s ⌊ it's &~in ⌋ . 4159415_4170335
⌈ if ⌉ it's not sufficient +/. 4170335_4171055

+, uhuh +/.
+, but what you would have to do is to say this is the extra piece of information I need and I can't get it from the rest of them . 4186375_4193955
and like you can explain why but you don't hafta prove +/. 4194635_4198355
+, okay +/.
+, that you can't get it . 4198735_4199475
so if any one of these &-uh is sufficient in part A ⌊ it should be sufficient ⌋ +/. 4199715_4206735
⌈ if it's sufficient ⌉ +/.
+, in part B . 4207075_4207715

+, yeah . 4207935_4208055
+, right ? 4208175_4208555
mhm .
⌊ mhm ⌋ .
⌈ so ⌉ you don't hafta prove again . 4208575_4210495
right . 4210675_4210975
okay . 4211475_4211775
yeah . 4212215_4212395
(be)cause in part B what you can say is it was sufficient &~i in part A and I know extra stuff so &~th therefore it's gonna be &~suf sufficient here . 4212635_4219515
okay .
and the problem &=flipping_papers noisy or@q . 4220295_4224235
if you want to say you can apply &~nois noisy or@q you have to ⌊ prove the truth table ⌋ ? 4224495_4230335
⌈ you have to do that ⌉ . 4230775_4230795
prove it ? 4230795_4231275
no you don't hafta prove it you have to calculate the values because these are just ⌊ possibilities ⌋ . 4231495_4235215
⌈ yeah I mean ⌉ &~y you you in all of these then you need to calculate &-uh &-uh all the probability ⌊ here ⌋ ? 4234625_4241565
yeah uhuh . 4241685_4242245
so and they say it's true so you can apply &~noi ⌈ noisy or@q ⌉ . 4242345_4246105
⌊ well ⌋ so so as far as applying the noisy or@q goes you have to &~kn know whether it's good to apply . 4246345_4252545
so like in task four it tells you you can go off and apply noisy or@q so you can just assume that it's okay to do it . 4252725_4258465
for task two +/. 4259065_4259905
uhuh +/.
+, it asks you whether you actually can apply noisy or@q . 4260225_4262445
so there you don't have the probability so you can't go and make a table like this . 4263415_4266855
+, mhm +/.
+, in task two what you want to say is well noisy or@q is appropriate because how the network's set up and what things are in the network so what I've been telling people is look at the network and say are these four causes of abdominal pain the only possible four causes . 4267435_4284315
if not then you need something else that models the fact that there may be something else that causes abdominal pain . 4285285_4292885
read about noisy or@q in the book and it'll tell you something about that . 4293465_4296545
yeah I mean +/. 4297425_4297905
and +/.
+, okay . 4298325_4298425
<if you> if you don't know about probability how can you +//. 4298885_4303325
you said you can apply ⌈ noisy or@q ⌉ . 4304205_4306645
⌊ well ⌋ so you would you know you could only apply noisy or@q if you knew these individual probability tables . 4306705_4312545
yeah . 4312985_4313065
+, so what you would have to &~d have is &-um probability of abdominal pain given that punched in stomach is true given that punched in stomach is false . 4313045_4321785
mhm .
but if you have your individual tables here you can have the ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 4322965_4327445
⌊ you can ⌋ do this but the question is does it make sense to do this . 4327945_4331305
what +/.
+, mathematically you can always take these tables and make this but say for example . 4331685_4336705
no I mean ⌈ <maybe it> ⌉ . 4337525_4338045
⌊ A ⌋ and B were connected . 4338045_4339045
so maybe say that B could only be true if A was true . 4339165_4343065
if if you can not apply noisy or@q your tables &~sh shouldn't be like these . 4343865_4349505
no . 4349685_4349805
no if you can't apply noisy or@q then this doesn't make any sense . 4350105_4352645
this was just an example of the mathematics behind applying noisy or@q this is not telling you when you can and when you can't use it . 4354485_4360385
why not I mean . 4361025_4362145
well I mean so this is +//. 4362245_4364365
&-uh there's no commentary here this is just saying these are tables this is what you get if you use noisy or@q . 4364125_4369225
but this is not telling you whether it makes sense to combine these probability tables using the noisy or@q . 4369825_4375985
but if you cannot use noisy or@q the formula shouldn't ⌈ be this ⌉ . 4376645_4382005
⌊ if you ⌋ can't use &~nor noisy or@q then you shouldn't make one of these tables . 4382085_4385925
I mean the only thing this example was showing you was the math this wasn't showing you whether or not you could actually apply noisy or@q in this case +/. 4387255_4394335
mhm +/.
+, you can apply noisy or@q +/. 4395115_4396295
+, yeah +/.
+, because I have no knowledge except that A B and C are the only things that can cause D and it appears that A B and C are all independent and I have these nice probability tables so just given this simple network noisy or@q makes sense . 4396555_4410135
so can I say &-uh if all of these three nodes are independent to each_other then you can ⌈ apply ⌉ . 4410395_4418635
⌊ if ⌋ they're independent and there is no other cause for node D then you should be able to apply noisy or@q . 4418635_4425335
how about if you have another node D here . 4425335_4427115
can you apply ⌈ <to this one> ⌉ ? 4427335_4429095
⌊ well something ⌋ E ? 4429115_4429575
yeah .
it it shouldn't be the same ⌈ name ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
&-um if you don't have one of those tables for node E +/. 4429975_4435375
mhm +/.
+, then there is a specific &-um term for that in the book and you may or &~m noisy or@q construction becomes more difficult if you have a node E . 4435875_4444615
but you know they are independent . 4445555_4447815
you &~do don't have table rather you know that this node are independent . 4448575_4452435
right . 4453175_4453515
so you want to leave some of the probability left over for this node E right ? 4453815_4457475
but I mean so you should still be able to apply noisy or@q but you want to use some of the terminology in the book in that case because if these aren't the only causes then what does that mean ? 4458475_4468855
how can you explain away the fact that you don't have all of the all of the causes ? 4469595_4474555
so basically just write a paragraph that says I can or can't use noisy or@q this is why and why being the dependencies and what does it mean &~t that there may be other causes . 4477255_4490055
okay +/.
+, and the book will tell you something about how you model so what you want to do is you want to explain if I use noisy or@q for this model then I have to do this and that +/. 4491295_4502735
+, okay +/.
+, in_order_to be able ⌈ to &~u ⌉ . 4503415_4503955
⌊ so ⌋ so <if you> if you can use noisy or@q you just make a table . 4504515_4509695
yeah .
+, if you can not you have to explain ⌈ why ⌉ . 4510035_4512175
⌊ if ⌋ you if you can't use noisy or@q then you can't make a table like this so you can't combine these probabilities in that way . 4512295_4519715
yeah +/. 4520395_4520515
+, so if you can't use noisy or@q then you hafta have more information as far as like how your network's constructed or what you need to add to your network in_order_to calculate the proper dependencies . 4520795_4532735
(be)cause here you're just guessing . 4533515_4534575

I'm starting out badly . 5136465_5137265
point nine times point five four times point seven . 5137545_5142765
point thirty four oh two . 5143665_5144605
point nine point one two times point oh six point seven point seven eight nine eight point six point oh six point seven point six point two eight point three . 5146315_5173515
now there's just a decimal point in the wrong place now let's add these up . 5175725_5180505
&=pause .
I think I found +... 5181065_5194705
an error +/.
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ in your ⌉ calculation .
yep this this answer that she got was right before there was one of the intermediate steps that wasn't right . 5196945_5203645
so &~s so neither of them is right . 5204815_5208015
that's correct . 5208275_5208655
okay xxx <calculation but> I don't ⌊ understand ⌋ . 5210115_5213655
⌈ for ⌉ part C that looks right . 5213755_5215035
this is right . 5216295_5216755
that's pretty close to right yeah . 5216875_5218155
that's at least +//. 5220055_5220735
the the second decimal place so the point eight part is right for part C . 5221315_5224675
but the second decimal place looks a little off . 5224935_5227675
okay but I think I found my one error I thought this is &-um this should be reversed xxx . 5228745_5235065
okay . 5235545_5237245
thank you .
sure . 5237705_5238825
(0.6) next &=laughs (0.37) . 5245605_5246105
can I ask you some questions ? 5283855_5284935
sure . 5285175_5285395
okay . 5285755_5285935
&-um just to make sure I'm doing this right +/. 5286955_5291115
mhm +/.
+, that I'm thinking about it right +/. 5291395_5292775
+, mhm +/.
+, like this is evidence +/. 5293075_5294695
+, mhm +/.
+, then I can apply the rule where these two come in to an evidence node +/. 5294935_5299915
+, mhm +/.
+, and in that case these would be &-um you know these would be &~ind &-um . 5300455_5308335
independent if that's evidence or independent if that's not evidence ? 5310005_5312845
if it's not evidence +/. 5312865_5313625
right +/.
+, ⌊ it should be independent .
okay so ⌋ .
⌈ right . 5313825_5314005
so if that's ⌉ evidence then those two are dependent . 5314645_5317745
dependent . 5318465_5318985
⌊ right ⌋ . 5319305_5319385
⌈ yeah ⌉ .
so these are dependent these are dependent these are dependent +/. 5319765_5324085
yep +/. 5324485_5324765
+, and since these feed into here +/. 5325145_5327305
+, mhm +/.
+, then these would also be not independent with this . 5328585_5332025
+, right . 5332245_5332525
+, okay . 5333525_5334165
and then up here since this feeds into here and these feed into here +/. 5335335_5340135
+, mhm +/.
+, they wouldn't be independent of this . 5341515_5343395
+, right .
+, and since now this &-uh this feeds in here so this affects allergy . 5343995_5349535
+, mhm +/.
+, it also affects bad breath . 5350015_5351675
+, right .
+, so these two would also not be independent of this . 5352255_5355875
+, that's correct +/. 5356055_5356515
+, okay . 5356975_5359475
<Sun hi> came by to correct me .
yeah .
so part A <ends the> answer's kind_of scary but it's +/. 5360415_5363035
not &=laughs +/.
+, that's right yeah . 5363535_5364155
okay . 5364875_5365235
and then I guess if I'm thinking about it right I should have this correct I think . 5366475_5371695
but in in the case where these are both evidence then these two would be independent if this is evidence +/. 5372875_5379555
mhm +/.
+, so then these would be independent &-um and there's +//. 5380475_5385835
so this is blocking I guess +/. 5386075_5387575
+, mhm +/.
+, &-uh punched in stomach and itch or eat_apples@q or eat_fish@q &-um yeah so these would be independent of punched in stomach . 5388275_5400015
right .
but you hafta be careful about the &-uh the rash one . 5400475_5403395
the rash one right . 5403675_5404655
yeah +/.
+, (be)cause stress goes into there and there's no blocking +/. 5405415_5407755
+, yeah +/.
+, between there okay . 5408915_5410315
so rash but let's see . 5416845_5417665
but bad breath would be independent because or are these &~ar can you go both ways on these arrows or . 5419845_5428585
what do you mean both ways ? 5429125_5429965
mm +/.
+, you have to use one of the rules for everything . 5430225_5432625
okay . 5433205_5433545
eat_fish@q is independent of punched in stomach . 5437265_5441725
via that path yes . 5442245_5443425
which means that bad breath since coming from here would also be independent . 5444525_5447745
yeah .
but &~i they hafta be independent on all the paths so now you have that punched in stomach via allergy is independent of eat_fish@q and bad breath . 5448405_5455285
but is eat_fish@q independent of &~punched-in-stom stomach if you come this way . 5455945_5460305
not via rash . 5460425_5461285
okay . 5461945_5462185
is it not ? 5462685_5463105
mm not . 5464365_5465925
wait . 5466665_5466905
is this independent of this ? 5467605_5468905
right . 5469025_5469265
⌊ via rash ⌋ ?
⌈ if you ⌉ ignore the allergy path and just look at the rash path . 5469485_5472285
&-um let's see +... 5473945_5476805
&-um I'd say it would be .
mkay +/.
+, because this only goes that way . 5479745_5484845
yeah .
mhm mhm .
okay .
okay then .
&-um and I worked out the &-um the task four with &~th &-um the noisy or@q +/. 5490945_5502865
mkay +/.
+, and I wanted to see if I was doing it right (be)cause I followed what they did in the book +/. 5503365_5507225
+, yeah uhuh that's good +/. 5507425_5508525
+, &-um they &~l what they did they took the probability of say sunset given each of these +/. 5509685_5518245
+, uhuh +/.
+, and that was a number and then you take one minus that number +/. 5518765_5523025
+, mhm +/.
+, and then take there's true &~y &~y you well if there's a true here you count that number +/. 5524205_5530185
+, right mhm +/. 5530605_5530925
+, and if there's three trues you multiply them . 5530925_5532585
+, yeah . 5532985_5533065
+, and then you'll end up with this and then you just subtract one to get this value +... 5533305_5536885
subtract this from one and get . 5539085_5540885
yeah okay I &~w I woulda thought that you went the other way . 5541185_5545045
oh .
+, (be)cause I mean in class we did the probability of sunset is equal to the probability of O plus one minus the &~prob one minus probability of O times the quantity and then we combine those +/. 5546005_5555865
+, okay +/.
+, which &~i probably gives you the same thing . 5558625_5560325
I think is I think it's &~exac ⌊ it looks like the same ⌋ . 5561165_5562665
⌈ yeah I think it is ⌉ . 5562865_5564065

mhm +/.

so and then the one +//. 5567745_5568365
I mean it's easy to check the ones that are just individually true because you can just look at the table and say &-uh +/. 5568485_5572585
right .

yeah . 5573105_5573285
<I got it> .

you ready to get on tape too ? 5592265_5593885

I know this is &-uh dependent ⌊ xxx ⌋ . 5613275_5615275
⌈ yeah . 5615695_5616055
mhm ⌉ .
this is dependent +//. 5616255_5616855
or these should be both dependent on this +/. 5617195_5618735
mhm +/.
+, if given only this evidence . 5618735_5620695
+, yeah +/. 5620915_5621115
+, but I don't know if this one is dependent <or not> . 5621275_5623835
well is this one dependent on that ? 5623895_5625355
should be yeah . 5625575_5626175
okay . 5626375_5626635
since this one's dependent on <that one> that one's dependent on <that one> that one's dependent on that then it is . 5626665_5631345
this is evidence . 5631605_5632285
well so but but yeah . 5632985_5634465
so &~th the point is can you follow a chain all the way to punched in stomach and so you have that stress is dependent on punched in stomach . 5634705_5642905
so so is this way ? 5642905_5643945
so that one is also . 5644125_5645065
so I know &~y if this this point R <that if it sends> some nodes xxx this is one is &-uh dependent on this . 5645645_5651045
that one's dependent on that yeah mhm . 5651425_5652445
right . 5652445_5652685
oh this one you mean the arrow points ⌊ <that way not this way also &~becau> ⌋ . 5653325_5656725
⌈ well so so the point ⌉ is can you apply any of those three rules for separating the network into parts . 5656925_5661805
yeah I guess so +/. 5661945_5662545
+, and in this case you can't because you have dependency that comes from abdominal pain up to stress so you have some sort of evidence about stress based on abdominal pain evidence . 5662585_5672745
+, mhm +/.
+, the fact that you know abdominal pain changes the probability of stress a bit . 5673665_5677585
since you have that you can't apply rule three to separate these +/. 5678035_5683515
+, yeah alright +/.
+, which is what you would ordinarily apply +/. 5684135_5685335
+, right yeah +/.
+, so since you can't apply rule three to separate these now this is dependent . 5685835_5689175
this is dependent on what ? 5689815_5691015
so this is dependent well so these are dependent on each_other +/. 5691155_5693315
yeah +/.
+, but because this is a chain &-um and you don't have all of the evidence about this one this chain isn't broken . 5693815_5702455
so midterm depends on stress which depends on abdominal pain . 5702855_5706055
and &~a +/. 5706985_5707265
+, <to &~b> +/.
+, abdominal pain depends on punched in stomach . 5708545_5710045
so ⌊ you basically ⌋ +/. 5710505_5711685
+, ⌈ yeah oh okay ⌉ +/.
+, just work your way through and find all of the chains . 5711965_5714245
(be)cause I don't know when it &~sh where it bloke broke or where it's it is not . 5715385_5719665
well if you were +//. 5719785_5720425
if you knew stress is evidence ⌊ then &-uh then ⌋ . 5720565_5723465
⌈ &~y oh yeah &~th in this case yeah this this &~sh ⌉ . 5723465_5725225
midterm would not be connected to abdominal pain if +/. 5725405_5727605
yeah +/.
+, you knew stress is evidence . 5727665_5728725
+, alright .
+, but since you don't know stress then midterm is dependent on stress which is dependent on abdominal pain . 5729825_5734965
okay but &~y in this case these these two are not . 5735925_5738625
those two are not dependent on each_other . 5739165_5740865
⌊ well yeah well ⌋ . 5741205_5741745
⌈ oh &~th they are dependent ⌉ . 5741965_5742525
they are because you're getting evidence +/. 5742625_5744245
(be)cause they oh okay +/.
+, from abdominal pain . 5744665_5745245
if you look at rule three then it matters whether the children have evidence or not also . 5745365_5748865
so basically for this this chain is xxx . 5750025_5752005
is that a guess or have you worked through it ⌊ to see ⌋ ? 5753885_5757445
⌈ I I have ⌉ to I &~ha &~i if if this way is dependent on this result then &-uh xxx . 5757445_5761845
okay . 5762345_5763025
that's that's the case but but I just wanted to make sure you'd work through it . 5763615_5766755
yeah so I don't I'm not sure if this one is dependent on this +/. 5767435_5769975
yeah mhm +/.
+, xxx so if this ⌊ okay &~fo ⌋ . 5771015_5772795
⌈ for part B ⌉ though it's &-uh it's not quite so simple . 5773055_5775155
mm but I . 5776135_5776835
I mean it's it's simple but &~th the answer is not all of them in part B . 5777355_5780715
&~y yeah . 5781915_5782155
this one must be independent of this one . 5782695_5784835
mhm mhm +/.

+, mhm +/.
+, I take this one and these two are xxx these these two +//. 5794245_5800885
let me see +//.
this is evidence so we can apply yeah this is blocked . 5801525_5806085
right ?
why is that blocked ? 5806825_5807705
this is evidence . 5808445_5809005
yep mhm +/. 5809445_5809945
+, and this is is . 5810485_5811285
so it's blocked from there but it's not blocked from here +/. 5811525_5814065
ah +/.
+, so whatever this is (be)cause I &~m see this is rule three again +/. 5814865_5817805
+, yeah +/.
+, so you have to look back through here and say . 5820145_5822265
why why it's rule &~thr oh rule three said if this is evidence this +//. 5822565_5826285
these ⌊ then those ⌋ .
⌈ then those two ⌉ are not blocked . 5826825_5827745
yeah .
yeah +/.
+, these two .
+, uhuh +/.
+, and it ⌊ so these xxx ⌋ . 5827845_5829865
⌈ so you ⌉ have to work through all of the paths so in_order_to say any of these are independent you have to both work through this path which allows you to say that they are independent but then ⌊ you have to come back this way also ⌋ . 5830065_5839205
⌈ what oh yeah this way yeah ⌉ . 5839485_5840125
and you have to decide well so if rash is dependent on this punched in stomach +/. 5840185_5843625
<just &~w> +/.
+, then well eat_fish@q is dependent on it also . 5843885_5845725
+, so work your way back this way and see if those are dependent also . 5846405_5849145
ah so this one is dependent on <this one> this one is dependent on this one . 5850485_5853865
right . 5853885_5854105
but but well so then the question is +... 5854305_5855965
is this one dependent on that one ? 5857065_5859385
that's the key is stress dependent on eat_fish@q ? 5859525_5861305

yeah this is &-uh . 5874235_5875095
joke ar_ar@i . 5875255_5875955

⌈ oh ⌉ yeah . 5878935_5879035
this is not evidence so this is not broken so . 5879275_5881595
&-um I don't know is it broken ? 5881815_5882775
well &~l look at this versus the rules that you have . 5883835_5886695
this is this +... 5889435_5890815
&-uh &-uh so &~r rule says only when there's two other nodes ⌊ <something like that> ⌋ . 5892275_5898255
⌈ oh well ⌉ no that's &~i just saying if there are any other nodes down here if you have those as evidence then that makes it not blocked ⌊ or makes ⌋ . 5898275_5905295
⌈ if there's ⌉ no nodes ? 5905295_5906795

oh okay +/. 5910515_5910795
+, you just don't know any evidence about any of the nodes down there which is good . 5910815_5913755
so this this one is so this one is blocked ? 5914975_5918015
yep +/. 5918315_5918515
+, oh . 5919075_5919275
so <this is blocked> this is blocked . 5920115_5921375

and you're missing one . 5922815_5923455
this one . 5924715_5925115

this one is blocked ? 5929455_5930275

think about it . 5931435_5931915
is it ? 5932595_5932735
I mean &~y &~you'r you're gonna ha +//. 5934695_5936095

<oh I &~sh> okay . 5942875_5944955

Bayes' rule and the . 5966325_5967245
you have to apply Bayes' rule +/. 5967945_5969145
yeah +/.
+, and then you have to just manipulate things here and there ⌊ to see ⌋ . 5969405_5971725
⌈ and ⌉ <to find A for &~a all the things at that side where we give about it> . 5971725_5976925
yeah . 5976985_5977265
mhm .
so I figure out only this <makes it> . 5978185_5979845
okay . 5980165_5980765
you still have to do part B but yeah . 5981635_5983375
&=laughs .
&-uh okay . 5983995_5987775
okay thank you . 5988055_5988215

he's back . 5989015_5991355

⌈ and he's made things ⌉ shaded yes . 5993615_5995175
the d@l separation was giving me trouble before . 5995515_5997575
mkay +/.
+, &-uh the first one with just that as evidence +/. 5998255_6000655
+, mhm +/.
+, there's nothing you can say about anything (be)cause none of these rules applies really . 6000895_6004235
+, good +/.
+, but my problem is even with the second one in there if none of these rules applied the first time they're not going to apply . 6005885_6011345
sure they are . 6011805_6012345
you want them to block right so now all of a sudden I mean if you just look locally eat_fish@q and itch are blocked right by rule one ? 6013085_6020665
that doesn't help you much here (be)cause I didn't wanna tell you the answer . 6021405_6023625
right +/. 6023825_6024185
+, so is anything else blocked ? 6024765_6025945
well the thing that confuses me is and this confused me in lecture seeing that sometimes you treated it as if there were an arrow pointing that way and sometimes you didn't . 6027245_6036065
mm you shouldn't treat it like there's an arrow ⌊ pointing that way ⌋ . 6036585_6038105
⌈ right I ⌉ couldn't say that these two are independent (be)cause there's no chain +//. 6038105_6041565
well there's no rule one chain going to it no matter how you . 6041765_6044785
well you don't want a chain if there's no chain that means they're independent . 6045125_6048005
I mean think about it if you had two networks that had no connections between them then those two networks are gonna be &~i independent even though none of these rules apply . 6049135_6055315
right but +... 6055855_6056615
it just seems like this is going to be . 6057535_6061575
so think in terms of those three rules still . 6063375_6065995
so ⌊ since you know allergy ⌋ . 6067075_6068955
⌈ but with this still ⌉ there and only one arrow pointing in from here ? 6068975_6072915
mhm +/.
+, I don't see how &~anyth this is gonna depend on anything . 6073135_6076635
how it's going to depend on anything ? 6077795_6079255
yeah . 6079535_6079735
well you just said everything depended on it . 6080475_6083695
+, (be)cause you're supposed to list the stuff that's independent of punched in stomach ⌊ and you said everything's ⌋ . 6084815_6090575
⌈ let me rephrase that ⌉ talking about the independence +/. 6090595_6092155
(o)kay +/. 6092695_6092955
+, given just this as evidence I don't know anything about the independence so I can't say one is independent of the other . 6093495_6100015
sure you do . 6100495_6101055
you know the independence you know this one is not independent of that one you know this one's not independent of that one . 6101595_6106575
you know that it doesn't matter for this one because you're given that one as evidence . 6106815_6112815
yeah there are too many double negatives floating around . 6116415_6118115
okay . 6118395_6118495
so I think the key here is for me to tell you +/. 6118775_6121455
well +/.
+, one of the independents so . 6122315_6123675
no the key is &-uh do it on a different network so I +/. 6123835_6126575
well +/.
+, can apply it to . 6126695_6127295
do you have the example from the web with you ? 6127285_6130165
&-um the one you did in class you mean ? 6130565_6131685
yeah .
mhm +/.
+, I didn't really follow all of that one . 6131825_6133665
okay . 6133665_6133885
let's go there so that at least someone will use it . 6134365_6138385
&=laughs .
you can run Netscape off here ? 6138505_6139705
it wouldn't let me do it . 6140025_6140785
I logged in elsewhere to start it up . 6141685_6143165
hm +/.
+, I logged into Crusty actually which Jeff hates me for my &~s Netscape from Crusty but oh well <he won't> he won't find it . 6143905_6152405
okay . 6154425_6154845
(0.7) it's not the fastest in the world . 6162075_6163615
(0.12) .
maybe I answered the first one too hastily without actually knowing . 6165215_6177655
no . 6178895_6179195
you may have gotten lucky on that one but it is kind_of good for you to know because I guarantee you there'll be some of this on the exam because this is one of those fast things that are good exam questions because you don't hafta do all the calculation . 6179575_6192235
(0.5) so +... 6195075_6197195
I mean so this is a simpler network . 6198795_6202235
but the idea is still that you can apply these three rules to various parts of the network so . 6202555_6207315
right . 6209075_6209415
so I mean the the simplest case is if you know node three then one nodes one and ⌊ five are ⌋ . 6210095_6214735
⌈ actually ⌉ this isn't representative at all because here +/. 6214735_6216775
sure it is +/.
+, we've got a bunch of (th)em pointing inwards toward ⌊ the nodes though ⌋ . 6216935_6219295
⌈ well here you ⌉ have node one and two that point in to node four . 6219295_6221695
okay but <they're not> they're not individual nodes . 6223155_6226935
huh ? 6228195_6228475
well that doesn't matter . 6229235_6230455
I mean if they were individual nodes it would still be the same application of rule three . 6231415_6235495
right +/. 6236875_6237195
+, I mean I didn't want to give you something that had the exact same structure as ⌊ that ⌋ . 6237435_6240195
⌈ I ⌉ know I &=laughs:multiple .
so I mean the idea is that the rules are applied in the same way . 6241055_6245775
so here I mean you can look at the network locally and you can say &-um eat_apples@q is independent of the stuff down here because allergy &~b breaks the chain between eat_apples@q and the stuff ⌊ down here ⌋ . 6247035_6260055
⌈ no but ⌉ these don't follow rule one because the arrows are pointing in the wrong direction these arrows are ⌊ pointing this way here ⌋ . 6259985_6266005
⌈ no no no but ⌉ you look at it locally and so basically you're just saying eat_apples@q is separated from abdominal pain . 6266025_6271505
oh okay +/. 6272005_6272485
+, and then the only connection to eat_apples@q well ignoring this part the only connection to eat_apples@q to the rest of the world is through abdominal pain and since +//. 6272485_6281665
I mean so the idea was that these are sets X and Y +/. 6281985_6286485
+, right +/. 6286745_6287265
+, and so X and Y can have any number of nodes in them so right like right here what this is saying is that nodes one and two are separate sets . 6287685_6295565
if if you don't know node four . 6296185_6297305
+, that I understand that +/. 6297645_6298585
+, and so that means that node three is also independent of two node five is independent of two because one three and five are members of set X and two and eight are members ⌊ of set Y ⌋ . 6298685_6308425
⌈ that I understand ⌉ but that ⌊ like you said ⌋ . 6308465_6310245
⌈ it's the same thing here ⌉ .
that's a simple example because you can't really divide anything in this ⌊ example like that ⌋ . 6310405_6313645
⌈ sure &~y ⌉ well yes you can I mean <you can defides@u> you can define +//. 6313645_6317145
divide simple things like PS five and midterm using that rule but you can also divide things using rash right ? 6317905_6323605
these two can be divided . 6323965_6324745
right and that's the whole network I mean you're dividing I mean &~y when you know allergy and you know that this connection is broken because you know allergy then you're also dividing stuff out based on that right ? 6325005_6336345
you mean like consider it breaking it right there and there ? 6337075_6339495
yeah mhm . 6339675_6339995
so this is independent of that (0.8) since I know this I can't say that this so this is a network right here +/. 6340055_6353335
mhm +/.
+, but I can't say anything about that because for the same reason I couldn't say anything about it in part one . 6354295_6359235
+, right . 6359755_6360035
+, so there's nothing I can say about that over there . 6360315_6362255
well you can say they're all dependent right . 6362455_6363915
well yeah but ⌊ you're asking for ⌋ . 6364355_6365215
⌈ that's that's something ⌉ to say &~y I mean but that's something to say is the the fact that you're saying all they're all dependent means that you know something about them . 6365385_6371525
mhm .
so now since I've worried about all that I just have this part of the network left . 6372905_6377985
mhm +/.
+, &-um this is out also . 6378265_6381965
oh no it's not . 6383925_6384605
what do you mean it's out ? 6384845_6385465
I was going to say this is broken here but it's (0.7) I know this and this are independent but what does that that doesn't break the dependence of rash on eat_fish@q . 6385825_6401945
⌊ yeah I mean ⌋ . 6404365_6404685
⌈ oh ⌉ and once this is out I can collapse these as one node right ? 6404845_6408285
I mean as one evidence node ? 6409285_6410785
yeah mhm . 6411225_6411845
okay . 6412585_6413245
does that help ? 6413385_6413765
no it doesn't . 6415435_6417575
actually yeah it makes this independent of that . 6417735_6421135
huh ? 6422415_6422435
I mean it makes this dependent oh no it doesn't (be)cause that breaks a link too yeah it makes this conditionally independent of that . 6422715_6430535
mm yeah mhm +/. 6430855_6431475
+, because you've got if these can be collapsed as one and this I don't hafta worry about that arrow going the wrong direction . 6431595_6437115
so that would now +//. 6437735_6439555
that's legal right ? 6439775_6440355
since I've taken off this part of the network by showing it's conditionally dependent ? 6441395_6444955
+, mhm +/.
+, then I'm just left <with one> with one arrow going +/. 6446215_6449935
+, yeah mhm +/. 6450495_6450795
+, between these two . 6450795_6451155
+, mhm +/.
+, and since there's only one I consider this as one evidence node now right ? 6451435_6455215
yeah that may actually hurt you later but yeah you can do that ⌊ for now ⌋ . 6455855_6458635
⌈ well ⌉ doesn't that now show that these two are conditionally dependent ? 6458855_6461715
⌊ or independent ⌋ ? 6462535_6462975
⌈ dependent ⌉ ?
independent yeah . 6463075_6463635
independent I mean ? 6463815_6464235
yep mhm . 6464335_6464935
okay but how does that how does collapsing this hurt me later then ? 6465835_6468655
well I &~do I don't know that it will I'm just thinking about all the rest of this stuff for example . 6468955_6473315
I mean if I've reduced it so that there's only one arrow combining two evidence ⌊ nodes ⌋ . 6473575_6477535
⌈ well ⌉ so what that means is if &~y <if you> &-uh if you collapse these into the same node . 6477535_6482395
I can't do that with these here but ⌊ since I've pruned this off ⌋ . 6482915_6486115
⌈ right so so if you ⌉ collapse these +//. 6486135_6487175
well but can you just prune them off if you're actually collapsing these into one node ? 6487515_6491555
well that's what I'm saying and since I've showed that when I broke it here and then I've showed that these are all conditionally dependent . 6492135_6497875
right right right but but the point is if you're actually &~physic if if you're making these one node then that means that the arrows into this one combined node include <this one> this one <that one> that one and that one . 6498055_6508735
mhm +/.
+, whereas if you leave them as separate nodes then you only have these two arrows and these going in . 6510555_6515095
okay but if I leave them as two nodes then I can't say that these two are independent by +//. 6515195_6518915
or conditionally dependent because of rule one . 6519005_6521465
well yes you can . 6521925_6522805
why ? 6523565_6523645
this arrow is going in the wrong direction . 6523765_6525185
well no &~d all you have to do is to say that by rule two this one and that one are independent . 6525365_6531665
because this is part of set X and that's part of set Y . 6532445_6535765
oh the fact that this is an evidence node doesn't change that . 6536425_6539425
no . 6539785_6540005
no that doesn't change for these it just changes for all of the things in the center so can I mark ? 6540685_6546405
sure . 6546665_6546885
all of these hafta be specifically evidence or not evidence but the ones out here +/. 6547825_6552545
okay +/.
+, don't matter because this is just set X and set Y . 6553325_6557445
which could have any number of ⌊ evidence or nonevidence ⌋ . 6557985_6559465
⌈ which could have any number ⌉ of evidence yeah . 6559465_6560925
okay that's what I didn't understand . 6561185_6562885
but I mean it also matters for these child nodes here if you have evidence of one of the child nodes for rule three then rule three doesn't apply anymore . 6563145_6569545
okay so this is rule two saying that these two are conditionally independent +/. 6569965_6575785
yeah +/. 6575795_6576235
+, &-um .
so like here since you have this one as evidence rule three does not split those two anymore . 6577935_6582815
okay .
but then I guess I jumped ahead by saying this was conditionally independent of that because knowing this is independent of that +//. 6585995_6593995
oh this is part of . 6594155_6595035
yeah that's +/. 6595375_6596175
oh +/.
+, that's fine . 6596455_6596735
okay . 6597035_6597335
(0.4) hm .
so really my splitting off this and showing all this was conditionally dependent didn't really mean anything . 6601525_6606025
it did mean something it meant that you didn't have to go back and look at it again . 6606425_6609305
well it didn't help me for this though . 6609605_6611265
yeah it did because there's two ways to get over to all these nodes . 6611365_6614545
there's this way which you've shown is conditionally independent so you can break the network here which simplifies it a_lot and you can effectively ignore this this link here . 6614785_6623585
mhm +/.
+, so that lets you &~s divide the network into halves that are only connected by this one arrow . 6623885_6629025
+, oh okay +/. 6630205_6630985
+, that does help . 6631385_6631905
so now you just have to look and see &-um ⌊ what all over here is ⌋ . 6633045_6637965
⌈ so <that's what> that's what ⌉ was confusing me the arrows are only important when you're dividing it and then once you've divided it you don't really consider the arrows anymore it's just a link of +/. 6637965_6646405
yeah +/. 6647025_6647165
+, of blobs or whatever . 6647385_6648425
which is considered network so +/. 6649085_6652085
+, mhm +/.
+, this is considered part of abdominal pain's network . 6652425_6655005
+, mhm +/.
+, so you can say that this is part of that just like you were saying three and five were part of one . 6655975_6659755
+, yeah +/.
+, if you had double arrows going from +//. 6660155_6661795
like if the arrows were reversed for three and five +/. 6662135_6664935
+, mkay mhm +/.
+, you could still say that two was independent of three and of five . 6666235_6669675
+, yeah +/.
+, okay .
alright that's what was getting me +... 6671715_6674855
alright . 6675895_6679075
okay and explain whether it would make sense to model this as noisy or@q +//. 6679775_6683335
that's assuming these two things again right ? 6683365_6685145
or is it +/. 6685985_6686465
+, nope +/.
+, just in general ? 6686665_6687145
no because it doesn't make sense if you already know abdominal pain then it doesn't matter how you model it because you know what it is . 6687605_6693165
so actually you shouldn't assume you have evidence for part C . 6694125_6696705
okay . 6697325_6697545
and in assuming &~eviden no evidence for part C I can again break this +/. 6698305_6702245
sure mhm +/. 6702525_6702925
+, network here so I have in effect shown that these four things are independent . 6702925_6707285
(be)cause this doesn't depend on that <or that> or that . 6709835_6711475
yeah . 6712755_6712775
&~s which is one of the prerequisites for noisy or@q . 6714235_6716495
&=gasp oh wait no I can't show +... 6716875_6719715
I mean &-uh the point is you don't know what you have as evidence so it's possible that you might have rash as evidence +... 6720555_6726035
okay +/. 6729155_6729655
+, so you wanna be careful when you state your assumptions if &~y if you say I assume that I have no evidence . 6729935_6734855
right I wrote since we don't have rash as evidence +/. 6734975_6737115
yeah +/. 6737415_6737915
+, stress is independent of allergy . 6737915_6738955
right but if you had rash as evidence then +/. 6739075_6741615
okay +/.
+, then that's not the case anymore . 6744375_6745555
so if you had rash as evidence maybe noisy or@q wouldn't make sense . 6746715_6749755
+, right . 6750615_6750735
+, so you want to be clear on that . 6750875_6751835

+, other assumption I made &-uh and other causes are independent . 6769105_6771825
mhm .
okay . 6772125_6774265
other causes are independent ? 6775665_6777365
what do you mean ? 6777585_6777925
that the other causes are independent of each_other and that they're all listed . 6778825_6781725
there are no ⌊ other &-uh ⌋ . 6782325_6782865
⌈ you're ⌉ assuming +//. 6782865_6783385
but does that make sense here ? 6783665_6784825
or can you think of something else that causes abdominal pain . 6785025_6787065
I mean don't divorce yourself from the problem this is a specific problem . 6787645_6790865
well you could always introduce a link node there ⌊ that's independent ⌋ . 6792405_6794925
⌈ right ⌉ well so so &~jus just mention that you might want to mention that somewhere . 6794925_6797565
okay . 6798005_6798205
the cure+all .
yeah exactly . 6800245_6801765
but it never hurts to say too much in these things . 6802465_6804465
okay . 6805825_6806385
it just makes the graders work harder . 6807945_6809905
&=laughs alright I think that does it . 6811205_6813225
okay . 6813425_6813665
thanks . 6814245_6814425
hello .
&-um for the &-uh the task two &-um is this part right ? 6816715_6823035
I mean for the first one there's none . 6824415_6827075
mhm +/.
+, and for part B <I think is> . 6828115_6829815
yeah it looks pretty good to me . 6830375_6831615
&-um &~f how about C because I think they are connected so it was not not model . 6832355_6839555
well &-um +... 6839915_6840755
so there are a couple things that you're not mentioning which +//. 6842765_6847125
are you assuming that you have no evidence ? 6847425_6849145
because what +/. 6849425_6849705
oh +/.
+, happens if ⌊ you have ⌋ +/. 6850045_6850485
+, ⌈ ah ah ⌉ +/.
+, that as evidence . 6850665_6851165
okay so I have to take that into account +/. 6851605_6853445
yeah +/.
+, whether I have &~e evidence . 6853625_6854625
+, mhm +/.
+, okay &~fo for this one still desperate &-um &=laughs:S2 &~a &~a &~a and I <I think got> the right &-uh formula . 6855745_6862005
+, mhm +/.
+, so &~fo &-uh for this one &-um &-uh for xxx (0.5) . 6863625_6867145
now lemme lemme look to make sure that +//. 6873145_6873885
lemme compare because there's probably some number somewhere that . 6874385_6876865
<how about> how about the first stack ? 6877365_6878605
the first stack combined is two evidence right ? 6879365_6881065
uhuh okay uhuh +/.
+, so I got these two rules . 6881605_6884285
+, okay +/. 6885465_6885765
+, and I've ⌊ got the same thing right ⌋ . 6887125_6888785
⌈ let's see ⌉ +... 6889565_6890245
holds true +... 6890365_6894445
false true so +/.
this is +/. 6895565_6895865
+, your numbers are the opposite of what ⌊ we have here ⌋ . 6895925_6898365
oh_my_god .
okay .
and oh &~wa &~wa wait +/. 6899305_6900785
mm +/.
+, and there's there's pointer yeah so <these are> these are the &-uh . 6901135_6904575
so I should . 6904815_6904975
so <this is> this is the false +/. 6905475_6907855
okay +/.
+, and this is the ⌈ true ⌉ . 6908495_6909815
⌊ &-uh I ⌋ don't think I'll confuse false for ⌈ <is this> ⌉ .
⌊ okay ⌋ . 6910015_6911775
&-um so for this part &~thi this xxx are the same right ? 6912975_6916915
yeah mhm . 6917495_6919115
<okay I'll do it again> &=laughs:multiple .
that's why I said the +//. 6920435_6922395
&~i in discussion I was like it helps to &~c look at the numbers over and over again or compare it with something . 6922775_6927875
yeah &=leaves:S10 .
eh ⌈ it's after five ⌉ . 6932085_6933545
⌊ are you done ⌋ ?
I dunno I guess so . 6934205_6935025
things seem to be &-uh slowing down a bit so +/. 6935945_6938005
alright +/.
+, I'll pretend I'm done and go home . 6938485_6940365
