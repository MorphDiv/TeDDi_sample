'cause otherwise it is gonna keep popping up . 33930_37920
&=laugh what the hell is that ? 38070_44780
&=laugh what do you keep on this computer, man ? 38070_44780
&=laugh . 38970_39630
well, it is suppose to do that . 40670_42050
&=laugh . 41710_42800
no, no, not that . 42100_44430

uhm@fp . 48320_48950
&=laugh . 48710_49440
<maybe I can make> you guys get the picture, right ? 49800_53400
<what this> what the ad is, right ? 49800_53400
yeah . 51740_52180
I think it should be bigger . 53120_54030
I can make it bigger, if you really want me to . 55110_57250
what part ? 56000_56700
uh@fp . 59670_60700
oh, it is already a hundred . 64390_65950
oh, okay . 64390_65950
yeah, it is a small ad . 66500_70160
I got it out of an article on the web . 66500_70160
I just downloaded it . 66500_70160
there we go . 70790_71730
that is better . 71150_71940
all right . 71220_97470
it doesn't look a@i better anyway . 71220_97470
&=breath this ad was never published . 71220_97470
&=swallow &=smack this is an ad for Adidas . 71220_97470
as you can see, that is all they're wearing, are Adidas sneakers .
&=breath it is a soccer team, I can't remember, I think it is the
it was a few years back &=breath and Adidas approached
&=breath and Sports_Illustrated said no . 71220_97470
wo@i we won't publish that ad . 71220_97470
but they will publish &=breath the swimsuit issue . 97320_101090
&=laugh . 97320_101090
exactly . 99710_117460
&=breath a lot of feminist groups got really ticked off that they
&=smack &=breath so, I wanted to just show this, &=breath and ask
that is crap . 117500_118700
what is crap about it ? 118960_120280
&=laugh the fact that they wouldn't do that, that just seems like
&=laugh am I making enough sweeping generalities yet ? 119660_133830
&=laugh . 119660_133830
&=laugh . 133010_133620
uhm@fp about the the ad or the situation ? 134790_139010
I think it is stupid that they wouldn't publish it, yeah . 134790_139010
both . 137700_138250
it is stupid that they wouldn't publish it . 139070_144090
uh@fp would you have published it <if you were> if you were
if it was my magazine ? 144100_145030
yeah, if you could make the decision, would you publish that ad ? 144960_147080
I guess it depends on who reads the magazine and what where I
well, a Sports_Illustrated magazine . 150480_152140
okay . 152360_153010
a men's magazine . 152550_153660
and it is in the US ? 153670_154610
in the US . 154730_159110
but keep in mind that you also publish the swimsuit issue every
I don't know, I guess it is a political decision . 159020_163880
I mean, I then uh@fp if I publish it, then I would take a lot
uh@fp I think it is in better taste than the swimsuit issue,
and <it is> it is kind of poking fun at it . 164600_170970
and so it is funny . 171260_173340
but do you think everyone would +//. 171260_173340
w@i i@i in <in a Sport> in a Sports_Illustrated
well, yeah, it is +//. 173470_174140
do you think everyone would find it funny, all the readers ? 175290_180150
or do you think readers would complain ? 175290_180150
I think you could find worse stuff in like Newsweek . 182000_188090
I don't think if they complain they would ver@i have a very
there is always someone that c@i +//. 182410_183610
there'll always be people that complain, <no matter> &=breath
exactly . 192110_193080
&=smack okay . 193200_211090
&=swallow uhm@fp what I find interesting about this is that this is
&=breath and I have looked &=breath hes@fp through at least, I
what kind of magazines ? 210030_211060
men's magazines, women's magazines, uh@fp news magazines . 211630_216840
huh . 218200_221070
I'm trying to think of any . 218200_221070
&=laugh I can't think of any ads . 218200_221070
I mean, even like National_Geographic magazines . 219100_221590
hm . 221460_221920
I this is one, I found three . 222270_224570
hm . 225010_225490
one has just a guy with a vest on, no shirt . 225880_309510
it is the best I could find . 225880_309510
&=breath the other one was uhm@fp &=smack actually a Kahlua ad of a
&=laugh &=breath <that wa@i> that was the most nudity I could
but this ad was never published . 225880_309510
&=breath uhm@fp what I find interesting about it, and I open this
&=smack &=breath and they wanted to know things about paintings . 225880_309510
&=breath and what people liked about paintings and artwork . 225880_309510
&=breath and one of the things that they found out is that &=breath
&=breath men or, like, you know, when you see the percentage signs
&=breath uhm@fp &=swallow it is like two, three percent of these
&=breath and this was in hes@fp US, European countries, &=breath
oh . 243530_245070
&=throat . 243530_245070
hm . 284740_285330
hm . 307890_308380
wow . 309980_310610
&=smack so, let me ask you guys, would you guys &=breath I
I think we see more women anyway, so that would sort of lead me to
th@i it is kind of con@i const@i uh@fp consistent .
yeah, that is true . 325740_326710
why do you think that is, that we primarily only see women and
because +//. 331020_331490
they're curvier and they're easier to paint . 333440_336810
&=laugh no . 333440_336810
<and that> yeah, and they were like &=noise +//. 335350_337230
'cause <it is> it is more <of a> of a shocking . 338060_343140
w@i it is hes@fp +//. 338060_343140
uh@fp a a painter is not going to paint a man, like, oh, look
I mean +//. 343080_347110
well, <you s@i> you see the sculpture of David . 346260_349860
that is definitely +//. 346260_349860
why not ? 347010_347810
because it is just +//. 348120_349270
well . 348160_355540
yeah, David, that is exactly what I just thought of . 348160_355540
what about all the the ancient Greek and Roman statues, the
okay, that is one, one . 350690_352010
yeah, there is plenty of +//. 352500_353980
<what about> okay . 356440_358540
but uhm@fp +//. 356440_358540
why did that change ? 358200_359360
I think it is more of, like, uh@fp it is not not not
keep a certain amount of coverage on themselves &=laugh
you could walk around without a shirt if you're a guy, but for
so, if hes@fp societies have &=breath deemed certain things
m@i more thought provoking, I suppose, yeah . 360400_396890
&=smack more artsy . 394400_395560
well, what about uhm@fp other cultures, especially in desert areas
what kind of artwork do you think you would see there ? 396960_445900
or, think about primitive cultures, where they had &=breath
&=breath do you think that would have something to do with it ? 396960_445900
that the reason why, <we see> well, we can't see naked men but
'cause if it is not something even biological . 396960_445900
if something biological then hes@fp the primitive cultures would've
hm . 446610_447230
that somehow it developed socially . 447530_449780
hm . 452830_453360
what are you asking ? 453650_454610
yes ? 453710_454280
do you agree with that, that it is something socially, or it is
hm . 455170_455520
is it, like, a universal thing . 457790_460850
<or is it> &=breath oh . 457790_460850
is it something you would find everywhere, as in, it is biological,
&=breath or is it something social . 459930_470390
that +//. 459930_470390
the fact that it is okay <to s@i> to see nude women but
is that what +//. 469790_474300
well, the fact that we see more naked women than we do men . 474750_486260
I mean, I have found countless countless countless advertisements
but not naked men . 474750_486260
because, I think +//. 485100_485790
depends on who your audience is, who you're trying to sell stuff
but it is both, both men and women . 492530_495010
it is not a gender issue . 492530_495010
yeah . 494890_495710
and I just think traditionally, like, the woman is worshipped as
no . 496780_502710
but not men . 501510_502360
well, I find it interesting that when I put this up, you guys
that is just +//. 503910_504640
yeah, 'cause it is funny . 507180_508110
but if it was a whole bunch of naked women <would you guys have>
<no it would have be@i> well, I don't know, maybe, but it
I mean, not a di@i different uhm@fp I don't know . 511650_517150
yeah, that is true . 514070_514970
would do you guys have any opinions as to why we find naked
uhm@fp &=breath this is kind of a s@i well &=breath I
&=breath <I think i@i> like men can run around wearing
&=breath but, you know . 523190_546650
uh@fp I don't know . 523190_546650
&=laugh . 523190_546650
well, <there has been a lot of> hes@fp and there is a lot of
&=breath uhm@fp &=breath there has been research done where
<you ha@i> you're more likely to remember a man's face if it
&=breath and if you're talking about advertising, you wanna use
not necessarily ugly people . 547280_594690
&=breath so, you're not necessarily gonna remember a uh@fp
what are they finding ? 554460_555400
but we're not looking at their faces here . 593520_596840
we're looking at what they're not showing us . 593520_596840
a naked man ? 593920_594820
right, <a man is not> hes@fp a s@i a naked man is
because you would find a naked man on the street ? 600830_602340
cause i@i +//. 602300_603050
'cause it is closer to what you might see, like on the beach or
right, closer to what you might see on the beach or on the street .
hm . 607200_607860
uhm@fp &=smack &=breath th@i I mean, the other reason why
and they wanna look good, too . 607930_631880
so, if you use a naked woman and say hey, she is beautiful,
but +//. 607930_631880
I totally agree with that . 629700_631220
yeah, but men are also interested in hm@fp what looks good . 631080_633400
I was totally thinking that . 632240_633600
exac@i but different reasons why, right ? 633830_639730
men just like to look, women want to look that way . 633830_639730
&=laugh . 633830_639730
what're the different reasons ? 636380_637370
and comparis@i compare themselves . 639070_646120
&=breath I was thinking that, but I didn't know if I could express
so +//. 640690_641440
peo@i al@i everyone does . 645890_648230
every hes@fp +//. 645890_648230
<a man wouldn't wanna look> a man wouldn't wanna see what
men aren't as concerned with their body image as women . 649980_652290
not as concerned . 650620_656030
in the population as women, no way . 650620_656030
not as concerned as women . 650620_656030
&=breath . 650620_656030
they're not ? 653080_653710
n@i +//. 653780_654870
how are they not ? 655470_659330
<like where is the> I don@i +//. 655470_659330
we@i well, uhm@fp okay, <look at all the@i> you can
and there is lots of evidence to show +//. 658500_670610
and how many more women that affects than men . 669060_672360
&=breath or +//. 669060_672360
<there are> there are hes@fp men that suffer from bulimia and
&=breath and saying it as as a woman myself, and having
okay . 673670_674300
yeah . 675460_676840
that is what I was gonna +//. 675460_676840
are bulimic and anorexic . 684490_685890
hm . 689280_689970
seriously . 690120_702660
you're concerned about what that girl is wearing, and <if you>
&=breath things like that, and if a woman is beautiful you wanna
yeah . 701950_702520
if I'm gonna check out a girl, I'm probably gonna look at her body,
&=breath but if I'm gonna check out a guy, I would look at his
right, because he is the opposite sex . 711770_714300
and you're attracted to the opposite sex . 711770_714300
right . 714390_714970
right, <well I would do the> I'm not gonna look at a woman and
obviously not . 714790_720070
uh@fp . 714790_720070
no . 719180_722970
&=laugh but you would look at her body . 719180_722970
probably . 719180_722970
but you wouldn't look at a guy either, would you ? 719990_725060
would you look at a guy and say hey, I wanna look like that guy ? 719990_725060
actually yeah, I would . 725090_729420
hm@fp and I do . 725090_729420
and I know lots of people that do, so . 725090_729420
yeah . 725900_726350
but I@i uh@fp +//. 727200_728180
yeah . 730060_730670
but I'm pretty certain you won't do it to the extent that women do
&=breath or as often as women do it . 730100_734220
maybe not . 733380_734280
but +//. 733380_734280

I just check out girls . 734950_737470
&=laugh . 734950_737470

<unless it is like> <I mean e@i> I mean even for
&=breath and basically they're saying if you use our brand, you'll
&=breath they don't really say hey, if you use our brand you'll
it is easier to use +//. 756160_757060
mhm . 770270_770870
I don't know why that is . 772540_795470
&=breath but I I also feel it is also because it is just
'cause it is something which has been proven, that sex
so, they're just gonna use sex . 772540_795470
&=breath uhm@fp let me put up something else . 772540_795470
hm@fp hm@fp &=breath uhm@fp this is one ad that I personally

it is for a stereo system, a car stereo system . 804570_807550
&=laugh . 804630_805190
that seems so unor@i unnecessary . 808880_812900
&=laugh . 808880_812900
we've <we've se@i> we've seen these ads before,

so unnecessary . 813610_829170
I never have . 813610_829170
&=breath that is so blatantly, like, yeah, we're gonna throw a

she doesn't look cold . 831160_834270

maybe Maxim . 858390_861960
&=breath or Playboy . 858390_861960
yeah, I think it was FHM . 860500_863180
uhm@fp okay, yeah . 862970_866230
&=breath &=smack that is another good one . 862970_866230

didn't think too hard . 989820_990990
hm@fp . 993130_993940
I don't think they would have to spend a lot of money on it . 998750_1004680
it doesn't look complicated, I don't know . 998750_1004680
<I don't know how much> I have no idea about that stuff .

no . 1006570_1007280
not really, no . 1007160_1008030
they're trying to relate nakedness to the natural, to the comfort .
<and it just> by tacking the word classic on the end it just
&=laugh not enough thought was put into this ad . 1009940_1018830

I could see it, 'cause it is not, I mean <it has g@i> it has
she is not too revealing, &=breath and she is definitely, you know,
I could see it being like a &=breath Self or something like that .
and because they're trying to link nakedness with natural feeling
like you said, I think that would <why w@i> I don't
I think it would be in a woman's magazine because of that . 1073030_1081600
hm@fp comfort . 1076640_1077750
