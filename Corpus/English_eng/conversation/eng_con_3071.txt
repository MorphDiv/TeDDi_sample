actually I have two words shh please . 0_13288
hopefully everyone else is thinking along with you Justin . 13288_16308
okay please just keep those where they fall Kelly thanks . 16308_20530
um (o)kay if I +/. 20530_24795
+< that's in that's in that's in half . 24795_27813
+< what shape were you imagining you'd end up with Jillian ? 27813_29965
um . 29965_31793
what shape were you imagining you'd end up with ? 31793_33926
+< a diamond . 33926_34878
+< a diamond . 34878_35361
um the only thing is uh how are you gonna fit that in
+< you can use the xxx . 48645_48988
+< xxx . 48988_49261
right oh but this still attached . 49261_52800
xxx a square . 52800_54378
so it would +//. 54378_55546
no she was thinking of a square . 55546_56913
oh a half xxx . 56913_57630
but could you use that to fill a whole core square and not have any
no . 61656_62325
um probably not so it probably wouldn't work for planning a core
yeah . 72816_73200
like a square with a xxx . 73200_74316
there's a square with areas done in our design . 74316_76903
a square with a &~try one of those smaller triangles . 76903_81206
Jillian Kelly Brian slide back away from the table . 81206_84706
there's a house right there Brian . 84706_87371
Justin has more ideas about other shapes we might be able to try
Katie could you repeat my question for the group please . 91786_97006
I couldn't hear (be)cause Sarah was talking to me though . 97006_100748
what should you have said to Sarah ? 100748_102343
stop . 102343_104011
yeah that probably would've been your best choice . 104011_106100
+^ who can repeat the question I just asked the group please
what did I just ask everyone to think about ? 112768_114798
not can you answer it for me just can you ask it again so that
Nicole what are we trying to figure out right now in the time we
+< does anybody else have any ideas for a different shape ? 123571_126406
different shapes we could put into our newest two by two design
is your hand up Nicole or are you just stretching ? 140030_142483
what shape are you thinking we might try ? 142483_144268
um um I can't really show it and explain . 144268_151511
I got it in my mind uh um um um um . 151511_158996
remember whatever shape we use it has to be a shape we could fill
excuse me Paul and Nathan that's really distracting you need to
Nathan I'm asking you please not to talk unless you're talking with
what kind of shape is it Nicole that you have in your mind . 185005_189095
two triangles and link them together . 189095_192865
two triangles going together ? 192865_195166
oh that shape we just had up here a moment ago ? 195166_198268
no . 198268_198593
&~cuh um Brian did you just say that'd be a diamond ? 198593_202485
if you put the if you cut a triangle in half . 202485_206883
so are you saying that we could put two triangles together to make
+< yeah . 212053_212288
+< that probably wasn't the shape in your mind . 212288_213873
um Nicole were you thinking of the shape we just talked about a few
nope . 224796_225788
what did it look like how did your two triangles go together ? 225788_229691
excuse her Sarah . 229691_233411
Sarah your eyes should be up front not on Katie . 233411_235896
okay um if we had lots of this kind of shape we might call it I
could you fill all the space of a core square with nothing left
+< yes . 252158_252408
+< using two of them yes you could . 252408_252708
using two of them ? 252708_253876
okay . 253876_255143
+< using four . 255143_255500
well +... 255500_256606
yeah yeah using two big ones . 256606_259000
would &~t if I had one more like this Nicole would it be big
uh yeah but not that kind of triangle . 263650_267753
a different kind of triangle . 267753_269753
+< I I mean a bigger triangle . 269753_271021
okay so this is the shape you're thinking of but you're thinking of
uh huh yeah and it could fill if you used another one . 275766_279276
+< there'd have to be two more there's have to be two more to fill
+< yeah that's how long xxx . 280010_282203
+< and then and then another shape <square> . 282203_284348
there needs to be two more to fill it in . 284348_286118
um if I had two more just like this and I put them in so that they
no . 293990_296460
yeah . 296460_297076
no . 297076_298160
well if you filled like all four squares though . 298160_299943
well our core square is based on those four that xxx design and the
+< if you had two of those things would . 306531_307356
no . 307356_308183
two of what two of what I'm holding now ? 308183_311186
uh um if you had uh two more of those two more triangles put (th)em
that's what I was thinking .330518_330519
+< so if I had two squares made entirely of triangles orange
how did two squares go together to make a core square ? 335063_338450
two squares go together to make +... 338450_345658
if we put two more right here we'd end up with a square for a shape
it couldn't . 355596_356316
what kind of shape would they go together to make ? 356316_359186
if I had you have to imagine the other half of this they're
rectangle . 371275_371925
a rectangle hmm . 371925_373943
if you put two more next to it . 373943_375860
+< but but if you if you had it put the other two
well we've done that before this is the size triangles we've been
no . 403815_404500
nope as a matter of fact that's exactly what Nicole and Dani did in
they took eight triangles they put four in the middle two of (th)em
no . 429648_431000
no . 431000_431450
Justin has a suggestion for something we could try that we haven't
Justin what do you think . 434795_435628
could you just sit down and tell us about (th)em please Justin
um so what if you take a triangle and you cut the um top corner off
remember whatever shape you come up with it has to be able to fill
you could use another small triangle that you cut and use it . 453213_457060
ah is this triangle that you're describing going to end up being a
<it'd be a bigger one> . 462651_464776
how big ? 464776_465951
just cut in half . 465951_467636
right that size we've used before and then what do I do to that
+< um just flip it over and then you cut the +/. 471941_476986
well if I do that how am I gonna get that whole core
that is a triangle it is right . 481996_486181
+^ Justin took a triangle we've been using all along and he said
that is still a triangle right ? 492101_495283
yeah . 495283_495965
but could you use triangles just this size and fill in all the
um no . 499526_500350
+< no . 500350_500351
how are you gonna make up for this missing space ? 500351_502388
you can use another one of the small triangles < in a different
this is the amount of space I have left how am I gonna
(o)kay guys ladies I want you to take a look at some +... 511038_514398
xxx I'm thinking that maybe we should have done it like this . 514398_517450
but you have to be able to fill the whole core square using the
take a look at um these are core squares we haven't looked at
what do you notice about that top one it's using blue green and
what's different about that core square than any of the ones we've
Nicole honey you're not even looking at it . 551290_554303
no it's it's blue over time it's kind of faded please think of it
xxx rectangles . 559390_559875
rectangles where do you see a rectangle Brittany ? 559875_562395
I see them um if you fold xxx right here . 562395_567111
+< I see some too . 567111_567680
oh um .567680_568066
