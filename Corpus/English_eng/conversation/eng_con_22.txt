twenty years ago, two men used to meet at Bob's restaurant .
one evening, Bob was waiting for his friend .
and the police walked up .
and he told the officer he was alright .
so <the officer told> he told the officer everything was
so the officer walked along slowly .
the man standing in the doorway lit a cigar .
and he told the policeman about the reunion that they had twenty
as he went about talking about his friend .
or thinking about his friend, someone else walked up .
and he thought it was his friend .
and they talked about this restaurant that was torn down some time
the two of them went on talking .

enjoying the clowns and the acrobats and all the animals .
and it was a day that my dad always said to me +"/.
+" you will never forget the circus .
+" and when your children come along .
