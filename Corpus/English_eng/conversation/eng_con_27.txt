it's the story of a man who had decided to come into a particular
waiting for someone that he had promised he would meet let's say
while the man was waiting a police officer had come over to him .
and sort_of asked him why he was there since it was dark .
it was night .
and the man indicated he was there because he was waiting for
and that there was no need for the officer to be concerned .
so the officer told him +"/.
+" well, are you going to be waiting long ?
and then the man told him the story .
making an agreement with his friend many years ago to meet back at
and then <the officer> they talked .
understood that the man he was waiting for name was Jimmy .
and that's when the officer asked him if he would wait long time
and he said he would wait over maybe a half hour or so if the man
he said that the individual was someone who normally was on time .
and if he was alive .
and could be there he would be there .
so the officer gave him his goodbyes$n .
and went on his way .
the man waited a little while longer .
and then another man came down into the same area that he was .
and he started talking to him .
Jimmy started talking to him because Jimmy thought the man was his
they talked about old times a little bit .
and the fact that the restaurant called Big_Joe's, something like
but of_course, over time it was no longer there .
as they decided to walk away Jimmy lit a match .
I believe her was a smoker .
and when he lit the match he could see the face of the man who had
as the light from the match revealed his face, he realized that it
and he made a comment that over the years, you can't change a man's
and then the man said +"/.
+" you are correct .
+" I am not, I guess, who you are looking for .
but he had something for him .
and he gave him a note .
and the note read .
from Jimmy's friend .
no, from Bob's friend Jimmy .
Bob was the gentleman who was waiting in the first place .
so the note read +"/.
+" to Bob .
and it said that he had come .
he was there like he was supposed to be at the time that he was
in reality, in checking, he knew that Jimmy was wanted by the
and since +//.
that's wrong .
Bob was wanted by the Chicago police .
and Jimmy realized when he lit the match that the individual .
I'm getting the names mixed up .
Bob realized, no Jimmy is the police officer .
and when Bob lit the match he saw his face .
and he realized that he was the man that they were looking for from
and at the end, he signed it Jimmy .
so I guess the story summarized that the man was where he was
his old friend had come back .
but over the years the old friend had become a police officer .
and the other gentleman had become the thug .
the one who the police were looking for .
and he didn't have the heart to arrest him himself .
so he asked a plainclothes policeman to come in .
and do the arresting instead .
that's it for me .
probably about four years ago .
I'm married .
I have a son that is thirty one .
and he's the only child .
and it's my husband and I .
and we've been together thirty years .
and throughout the thirty years you see the body changing .
and the relationship with each other really formulating .
and getting better over the period of time .
so what had occurred over, I guess, the last three to four years .
I noticed a change in my husband's walk .
and it concerned me .
but of_course, for some reason, men don't seem to want to go to
you almost have to force them .
and pull teeth to get them to go .
so it took a little while of urging .
but I made an appointment for him with the doctor .
and suddenly that's when everything changed .
when the doctor decided to examine him, he couldn't find anything
so one of the things that they do when they see something is
so he was given to see a neurologist who was a specialist .
and we spent the next year and a half going back and forth to the
over time the husband became a little more fatigued .
the walking a little more strained .
and dragging the leg even more so .
but it took at least a year and a half for them to diagnose what
and it was multiple_sclerosis .
so one thing that I've learned from that experience is it's, it's
you're still there .
and you stick with it .
and it's almost as if as people go through changes .
and things the love of relationship that you have truly becomes
at least it has in my case .
it hasn't been one that you want to run away from since you now see
and we both love the Lord .
and I think part of getting his mind set to accept the diagnosis .
and realize that according to doctors it won't get better .
it's progressive .
so it will only become worse .
and I have a sister that has m_s who is wheelchair bound most of the
so knowing that that's something that can happen to him .
I just feel very blessed that he does have a relationship with the
that we realize that there is no more on him than he can handle .
and that's just part of the many things we need to do in this life
and even though it's going to cause a change .
and be a change .
we are enjoying each moment of time as if each day was the best one
so as relates to the three characters .
