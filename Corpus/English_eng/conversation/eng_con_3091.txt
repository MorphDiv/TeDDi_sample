++ xxx so each person will make twelve core squares . 0_7070
tell me where your thinking goes from there Sara . 7070_9803
um and if you add two of two I mean um um come on um &~s six um man
okay just a second Sara's thinking about six two by two designs
+< yeah . 38040_38775
that would be twelve and twelve is twenty four . 38775_41225
twenty four two by twos ? 41225_42910
twenty four core squares . 42910_45461
very good . 45461_45863
and then there's two rows left . 45863_47990
mmhm . 47990_48636
so that would be another twelve I mean that would be another twenty
okay . 53403_54151
and twenty four plus twenty four is forty eight . 54151_56053
okay . 56053_57020
xxx . 57020_57021
+< okay hold on look at um the way Sara thought about this is she
she thought about the &~per the team member who would attach their
and she knows there is going to be another member in the team and
well we looked at one row of two by two designs and saw that it was
we found out that there were twelve core squares in each row . 107956_112226
Sara put twelve and twelve together and got twenty four . 112226_117396
then she realized that okay if these two rows together are twenty
and then she had to put the twenty four and the twenty four
+^ how are you sure Sara that twenty four and twenty four are forty
+< because . 135576_135876
because twelve and twelve is twenty four . 135876_138780
actually we have four +/. 138780_141883
I want you to explain to me how you know twenty four and twenty
+< because we talked about it when we were doing apartments we did
+< yes we did . 151033_151546
++ and I said that I counted the twelves that was twenty four and I
how do you count two twenty fours in you head ? 160000_162105
<it goes xxx um twenty four> okay take the two fours away and
mmhm . 172295_172830
and twenty and twenty I know was forty (be)cause that would be four
+< okay yep . 177348_178333
and since we had eight left it would be forty eight xxx . 178333_182370
good job good thinking . 182370_183500
so the group of four people when they make their finished quilt how
forty eight . 190241_190593
forty eight . 190593_191630
okay is that fair that they're making forty eight core squares and
yeah . 198548_199281
yes it is . 199281_199950
sounds like they're doing more work forty eight core squares is
no because they have more one more person +. 204401_207571
+< because they have +/. 207571_207620
+< they're not doing more work . 207620_208271
++ than groups of they have to make a &~ex extra . 208271_212548
xxx wouldn't be fair because they would probably get done before
why ? 217378_218028
because um they got because they got one more person and he could
hmm . 239428_240811
and stuff and just glue them all down and stuff . 240811_242000
Nathan is saying that the group of four is gonna be the lucky group
it just no they have they have +/. 248251_249735
+< no but +/. 249735_250503

I disagree . 252540_252800
Jenna why do you disagree with Nathan ? 252800_255630
+^ he thinks the group of four has it the easiest and that they're
no because I think they have more work to do . 258558_262013
<they have more> do they have more work to do ? 262013_263795
no but they have xxx they have an extra row because they have an

okay . 272405_273166
Nathan if four people were gonna make the same size quilt that
yeah . 282858_283200
+< but is their quilt gonna be the same size ? 283200_284700
no . 284700_285626
it's gonna be bigger . 285626_287045
+< no it's just gonna just be one row bigger but they they they
+< how can you be sure uh what do you know about the whole project
there's nothing unfair about the group of three or he group of
they're gonna be doing exactly the same amount of work . 299073_301671
how do you know that that's true ? 301671_304576
um because um +/. 304576_306976
because each person does three two by two designs . 306976_307215
what Brittany ? 307215_308295
because each person does three two by two designs . 308295_309813
if every person in every group does three two by two designs is any
no . 315533_315990
no . 315990_316718
<they're just they're &~ju> the group of four are just doing
but they have one extra person . 320950_323255
yeah that's what I said but that's not +/. 323255_325190
+< so really does any one group have any more work to do ? 325190_325941
no . 325941_326575
(be)cause each person is each group is responsible for how much of
a third . 331145_332278
xxx . 332278_332495
three two by two designs . 332495_334130
+< but one group but one group +/. 334130_335000
+< one row . 335000_335471
but one group might be might get done and might go a little faster
one might finish faster right but will the group that finishes
no . 344775_345071
will the group that finishes last whichever group finishes last
no . 351610_352076
nope . 352076_353126
everybody has the same amount of work to do everybody has twelve
yep . 358368_359548
everybody has three two by two designs to do . 359548_361750
no everybody doesn't do twelve core squares . 361750_363855
yes . 363855_364201
the whole +/. 364201_365958
+< yeah . 365958_366975
