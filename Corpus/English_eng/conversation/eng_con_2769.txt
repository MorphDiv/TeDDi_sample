<mister> Justice , what did you think of Franklin Delano
he was coming along during this period .
well , he certainly was .
I first stood in his presence because he was the commencement
commencement in those days was in the Sever Quadrangle , in Harvard
I well remember his standing up , because he had been crippled by
he was governor of New York and obviously gearing up to run for the
he was very impressive , he was a great speaker and , of course ,
so he was a dominant figure in American politics over a long period
did you ever vote for him ?
yes , yes , not always .
the Roosevelt days , of course , he had a tremendous following and
you were either strongly for <F_D_R> or strongly against
Eleanor , <Mrs> Roosevelt , I think was a great plus for
a great public speaker , almost a show of arrogance as you watched
I suppose he's a great president despite the fact there's no real
there's just that one stone in the grounds of the National Archives
it's the only thing I know of .
of course , we went through those campaigns .
in those days , one didn't run for a third term , but he did and
he had a lot of ideas , certainly the New Deal legislation was full
he went through the Court-Packing plan which , only he could
I think probably the most interesting campaign he had was against
I've often wondered what the country would have been like had
you were friendly with William <O> Douglas , who was a close
+, a little bit , sometimes as we drove into court together .
he admired him tremendously , of course .
I can understand why the two would respect each other .
of course , I've always felt that William <O> Douglas came
the choice of the vice-presidency there in <nineteen forty-four>
did Justice Douglas ever talk about this ?
no , I can't say he did .
I don't think that it's anything that hung heavy in his conscience
what kind of president do you think William <O> Douglas
I think we had a much better presidency with Harry Truman , really
Douglas was extraordinarily able but whether he would have been a
you are often likened to President Truman , I guess because you're
did you have any feelings about Harry Truman either when he was
I thought he was a person greatly to be admired , certainly , and
living in the shadow of Roosevelt .
people knew eventually there would be somebody not named <F_D_R>
he merged into , I think , colored his place in politics because of
I think probably he will go down as one of the great presidents .
there are those who differ .
did you ever meet him ?
yes .
that's all though .
on what occasion ?
I think probably some gathering the <eighth> Circuit had in
you mentioned that Judge Gibson was a close friend of his at one
I did .
he was , but I think a closer friend was Judge Albert Ridge , a
he and Truman were in Battery “D” together and went through the war
ridge thought the world of him .
it seems to me that Truman had a commission , maybe a second
and so did Floyd Gibson who came along later and was also out of
you never could say anything adverse about President Truman .
during this period , living in the Midwest , did you ever feel that
this was now , in history , if you remember a period of great
that issue was always brought up every election that came along .
there were those who were afraid of it , there were those who
I wasn't particularly , even though I saw the change in the power
I think generally it worked out for the good although there are
do you remember how you felt when the Supreme Court decided
from the legal point of view , it was an exciting time because
of course , he made the most of it as a political issue and Chief
it was exciting in many respects .
the four older justices , Van Devanter , Sutherland , Butler , and
pierce Butler was the first justice from Minnesota .
did you ever meet him during your clerkship days ?
I met him once .
I knew his brother Francis better because he was practicing in the
I'd encounter him once in a while in legal matters that we had ,
I knew the Pierce Butler homestead on Summit Avenue in <Saint>
what was Pierce Butler like ?
most people thought he was an old curmudgeon and hard to meet and
Francis was a little bit that way .
you didn't get by with anything with Francis in trying to be nice
in later years you came to play , as circuit justice for the
do you think Pierce Butler had any kind of reputation among the
what kind of vibes did they get from him ?
oh , I don't think they got any vibes at all .
he was only on the Supreme Court and that was it .
no I don't think at least I didn't sense any .
another feature of your chambers , once you came to the Court , was
was that something that was engendered in Judge Sanborn's chambers
you were the first , but there were many who followed , I guess .
there was never very much in a social way with Judge Sanborn .
the Sanborns had their own friends and being a law clerk you were
I think that was true for my successors as law clerks , I can
when I moved to Minneapolis to practice law there and the judge
one of them , not the one who succeeded me but the one who came
the book was fairly popular for a while .
in the time that you were clerking , were there many dissents ?
did they go err bane very often ?
well , they went en banc very rarely , maybe once or twice when I
no , there weren't many dissents .
the judges would get into colloquy before they wrote a dissent .
<a_k> Gardner , who was chief judge for a long time , was
he thought it showed a weakness on the part of the court somewhere
now , of course , dissents are very common .
when the judges conferred after oral argument , did you get full
were the conferences long , or were they quite quick ?
they were usually this is when I was a clerk they were
ninety-five percent of the cases it was the way his vote was ,
in my day , when I was on the Court of Appeals , we always
we didn't put it off until the end of the week .
some of those conferences lasted fairly long .
+, two cases that have been mentioned by former Harvard Law dean ,
in his memoir he says , +"/.
+" I lost the first case Burnet and won the second
+" at that time , Harry Blackmun whom I did not then know
+" it may be that Blackmun , future Justice of the Supreme Court ,
can you settle that question ?
no , he never asked me .
these are two cases in <sixty-three> Fed <second> ,
he did not write the opinion in the other one .
he was the junior judge of the three who sat on the case .
I have a vague recollection of the one that he wrote and I'm sure I
reading some of the language struck me as being a little bit
did you know Erwin Griswold or know of him ?
no , I did not .
and I don't recall the argument .
it probably took place down in <Saint> Louis , and I was
could you have stayed on as Judge Sanborn's clerk longer than you
I think so .
he certainly didn't press me to leave at all .
we talked about it a little bit .
I was there seventeen months .
had I gone on to finish two years I'm sure I would have felt that
so how did you then make your transition from the clerkship into
of course , I was out interviewing with both Minneapolis and
but at that time , when I was a clerk , the Foshay Enterprises ,
in Minneapolis to this day , there is a building called the Foshay
but the Dorsey office was counsel for most of the receiverships in
judge Sanborn as a district judge had been in charge of some of
when he was elevated to the Court of Appeals the chief judge of the
the result was that regularly people from the Dorsey office would
they would come in and instead of waiting in the outer ante room
how big was the firm at the time ?
it was called the Junell office at that time , and I'm guessing now
is that a big office ?
that was a big office for those days .
it was the largest in Minneapolis .
I've always thought it was one of the best .
I remember going over there .
I had , of course , to go in and see Mister Junell , who
he was a hard-boiled fellow .
he was Finnish and had come from the upper peninsula of Michigan
and someone had tipped me off never to say anything adverse about
so I took that up and went in there and praised the University of
he turned me over to a couple of his partners at that time , and
<mister> Junell had had a serious automobile accident
then it became the Dorsey office .
who was Dorsey ?
I shouldn't say it became the Dorsey office , it really didn't .
the old firm at one time , as I remember was Junell , Driscoll ,
Robert Driscoll was a <Saint> Paulite over there in
greyhound was one of our prim clients .
so his name came out and it was Fletcher and so forth for a while .
Clark <R> Fletcher was a litigator who graduated the
Dorsey in the meantime , however , just before the Depression , had
he was always a dominant figure in the firm .
what was his area of specialty ?
he was .
an old litigator , a business-getter and wore the map of Ireland on
one wouldn't expect it but he was always concerned about them and
if he ever had to let one of them go because he wasn't cutting the
did that happen a lot ?
was it competitive ?
well , yes it did .
in those days , as I suppose is still true , you either went up or
there have been a few exceptions maybe .
but Fletcher and Dorsey ran the office for a long time , and it was
their primary client was the First National Bank of Minneapolis .
I think the firm , which is comparatively young , it was really
that's the way the firm started and you know , you get a good big
did you feel that in choosing between a Minneapolis practice and a
well , I was glad to get to Minneapolis , I was glad to have any
practice in those two cities , I think , is contrasting .
<saint> Paul is the older city , the wealth over there is
Minneapolis is much the younger of the twins and full of bustle and
I think , although probably Chief Justice Burger would disagree
now he was there , Chief Justice Burger , when you returned ?
yes he was indeed .
he had been admitted to the bar one year before I had .
did you see him very much when you were a cub ?
we always kept in touch with each other .
socially , with two others , or eight of us , we would get together
are these your old friends from the original neighborhood ?
yes , yes , indeed .
when you first got to the Dorsey firm , how did you get your first
as usual , the cubs there , and there were two or three of us ,
any partner would call on any new associate and haul him in .
I remember I sat at a double desk with one of my cub associates on
we graduated to a room with a window , which was a big promotion .
where was the office located ?
we were on the <thirteenth> floor of what was called the
the Sao Line is a railroad , Minneapolis , <Saint> Paul and
we were there for a long time and finally the firm grew and took
how did you come to do the tax practice ?
that was a matter of great concern for the cubs .
Leland <W> Scott was the tax partner .
he had been here in Washington working for the Internal Revenue
but his health was not good , and he was out of the office as much
but tax practice was beginning to blossom and I think the office
with Leland Scott being indisposed , we were told , I suppose , by
one of the cubs .
yes , there were about four of us .
we all groaned , none of us wanted to get into that .
that would be a real condemnation .
the chip landed on me and all the others thought it was great .
and here I was going into the tax department and never studied
did you volunteer in any way ?
no .
none of us did .
we waited for the ax to fall .
but it was the best thing that ever happened to me , actually .
it has sometimes been said that because of your math background you
did you feel that way when you started doing it ?
it might have .
I have a feeling that that fact was a factor in my being chosen ,
the other cubs at the time , did they stay with the firm and become
yes .
who were they ?
there was Don Nelson , who held on for a while and eventually left
<w> <F> Marquart who stayed on with the firm and
Malcolm McDonald who was a year or two older than I was and
they all did very well .
now you came to do quite a bit of litigation in the tax department
did you have a preference between litigation and counseling or you
I thought it was all part of a job and actually I thought that tax
you're up against government lawyers for the most part ; they were
or you're up against somebody in the <U_S> Attorney's
if a case was important enough , always there was somebody from
+, how did you come to feel about the <I_R_S> ?
you later went on to write many opinions about tax at the court .
I think it's a responsible agency and much depended on the
I have no reason to be critical of the <I_R_S> We
when we were filming in the courtroom in our first session , you
can .
you tell us more about that ?
I think that is Douglas against Willcuts in , I'm guessing , <two
the Supreme Court building was opened in <nineteen thirty-five>
it may not have been the first one announced because , as you know
but it's the first reported because they are reported by seniority
there it is , with Leland Scott having come down to argue it and
well , Mister Fletcher hadn't anything to do with the
I'd written the brief but I wasn't admitted to the Supreme Court
I well remember it .
we lost the case , and properly so in those days .
what do you remember about the argument in the case ?
well , it was pretty good .
I thought Scotty did a very presentable job .
forgotten who was on the other side , it might have been Sewell Key
but tax law was changing , and the government was scraping the
do you remember much about the Supreme Court bench and the Justices
no .
I don't , particularly .
I was glad to be there .
how many Supreme Court cases did you work on at the firm ?
oh , I'm guessing , as long as I was in the tax department ,
certainly , we must have had a dozen where cert was filed , of
Erwin Griswold has made reference to one case you worked on in
do you recall anything about this case ?
the Dobson case was another one of the same ilk .
we had won it in the Tax Court and the <I_R_S> took an
we filed a petition for cert being fully convinced , all of us in
I thought for a while that maybe they'd send me down to argue it
in the office at that time was William <L> Prosser , Prosser
was he a tax expert ?
no .
didn't know anything about taxes .
he knew just about as much as I did when I went into the tax
and so , Leland Scott and I worked on Bill Prosser , tried to tell
the office generally said , you go down and argue it and don't be
well , it turned out that he won it , nine-zip , to his utter
he came back after the argument and was thoroughly discouraged that
but what happened was , not only did they reverse the <eighth>
to what extent were findings of fact made by the Tax Court to be
so the Dobson case became very important from a procedural point of
of course , Bill Prosser , being Bill , would never let the rest of
+" you had a loser up here and sent me down over there .
+" just easy to overcome .
+" good lawyer and knows how to do it .
what was he like ?
well , Bill was fascinating .
we all liked him for the stories and an amazing kind of a
he was not very good with clients , I suppose , because he was so
stimulating .
we brought him in on a lot of stuff .
he always had ideas and must have had a great influence in his
he was a practical joker .
one time when I was teaching as an adjunct at the University of
at the end of the hour our classes would switch , they'd go over to
and pretty soon I discovered that Bill was insulting me from the
so I returned the favor .
we had a lot of fun .
we almost got him into trouble with one of his practical jokes one
how did you start teaching ?
I started teaching night school at the <Saint> Paul College
it's a fine night law school .
judge Sanborn was a trustee and allowed as how I ought to go up and
so I did .
it seems to me that I taught there for about six or seven years ,
started off teaching Real Estate and Future Interests and all I did
and then I was squawking so much that they didn't have a course in
+" good , we'll put it in and you teach it .
you see .
so I had to teach Tax Law for a while .
so that was quite a time commitment given your workload at the firm
yes , it was too much , really .
and I paid for it a little bit .
a couple of times going down with pneumonia and not enough sleep .
did you enjoy the teaching ?
oh , sure .
well , you would know far better than I do .
I think teaching is a great sport and is hard work , particularly
after that , I think it's much more enjoyable , and you fill in
did you ever consider going into teaching full-time ?
yes , I considered it .
the Dean of Minnesota , as I indicated , I had taught at the
now and then Mayor Donald Fraser .
+, yes .
+, called me into his office one day and suggested that I come over
I thought about it a little bit and gave him a negative answer ,
the gist of which was , +"/.
+" look , you're just starting your career , what really do you
I quote , +"/.
+" do you want to be another James Dorsey ?
he wasn't insulting Jim Dorsey , what he meant was , +"/.
+" do you want to , eventually , if you're lucky , become head of a
+" if you go into teaching think of the influence that you can have
+" I'm disappointed that you're turning me down .
we were always friends after that , but , as I look back on it ,
because every time I thought of leaving practice , I thought of
and that encouraged you to consider other options .
yes .
what did I want to make out of my life ?
did you do pro-bono activities , bar activities ?
yes , to a degree , although not as much as one of the other ,
he was doing so much , particularly in connection with bar work and
+" look , we're still in a depression time , we need your time .
+" billable hours , are more than we do pro-bono hours .
so they weren't very eager , although the need was even greater
times were tough , +/.
do you know of any minority law firms ?
or were there any law firms that had sort of a more of a public
+, no , but I can remember when the Dorsey office took the first
that was a major event .
but we were all nice to her , I think she was happy .
but some of the old-timers , it was a hard thing for them to
did she stay with the firm ?
she stayed with the firm .
her name was Betty Washburn and eventually she married a vice
now , it's around this period that you met Dorothy Clark .
yes .
when was that ?
you're getting kind of intimate now , Professor Koh .
that was August one , nineteen hundred and forty-seven and it was a
how did you meet her ?
I had a regular Sunday morning tennis date with a friend of mine
as I said , it was blistering hot , we got three sets under our
so we went down and they said sure .
and Dottie was one of them .
she walked to the other side of the net and I just followed her .
what was she doing at the time ?
was she a student ?
she was a secretary for a businessman in <Saint> Paul , who
she was , through him , engaged in a lot of civic activities .
I followed her over there because I thought her legs were rather
both of us were pretty hot and very offensive , I suppose , at that
yes , we had a few dates along the way from then on .
was Dottie a life-long native of Minnesota ?
she was born in Cloquet , which is up , near Duluth , so was a
she went to high school at a little town called Barnum , which is
then eventually , because her family didn't have any money , she
and you , at that point , were you a partner yet at the law firm ?
not at that point .
this would be forty-seven +/.
thirty-seven +/.
+, thirty-seven .
I think my partnership came along a little later .
I knew her for four years before we were married .
+, when did you propose ?
if Dottie were here , she would make a joke and say that I proposed
translated , what that means is that she was ill at the time and I
and then when did you get married ?
we were married on the <twenty-first> day of June ,
and this brings lames <E> Dorsey back into the picture .
before that , oh , it must have been , shortly , not too long after
the party was out at Lake Minnetonka where one of the partners had
when we arrived , whoever was receiving us said , +"/.
+" everybody's down on the dock in the lake .
so I went down and Dorsey was out there “holding court” , so to
so I took Dottie's hand , took her up and introduced her to James
he didn't say anything for a moment , he just looked her over from
+" how do you do Miss Clark ?
+" when are you and Harry going to get married ?
which , of course , translated means that he approved .
so it was .
where did you first live as a married couple ?
we had an apartment on <third> Avenue South , in
it was a brand new apartment complex and we were the first
it was close enough to downtown , it was <twenty-second> ,
it's well known that you were the best man at Warren Burger's
when was that ?
the chief justice and <Mrs> Burger , Elvira Stromberg ,
so while you were still a law clerk .
yes , yes .
I well remember when they drove off in a little , he had , I think
I thought , +"/.
+" my friend's gone down with a strange woman , and I'm left alone
did they attend your wedding ?
yes .
they did indeed .
was it a big wedding ?
no .
and where did you go for your honeymoon ?
where did Dottie and I go ?
yes .
I had a fairly new car , and we packed it up and neither one of us
so we drove South and went straight down to Louisiana , New Orleans
it was shortly after that that Pearl Harbor was bombed , shortly
can you remember where you were that day ?
yes , it was a Sunday morning and we were in our apartment in
of course , everyone was in a state of shock that this would happen
despite the fact that there had been kind of a tension building up
I remember the next morning going in to see Mister Dorsey
I just remarked , I said , +"/.
+" things are changed , aren't they ?
and he said , +"/.
+" yes , we're in a full-fledged war , and how it's going to affect
those were tough times and some of my young friends , young lawyers
no one in our office was lost , but others in other offices were .
did you consider joining up ?
oh , sure , and we all in effect were drafted , of course .
I remember going out to Ft .
snelling for a physical and the like .
that summer of <forty-two> , Dottie and I decided we had a
we had to be careful because gas rationing was then starting to be
so we saved up our coupons and decided not to use them and went
I can remember staying there at the same hotel with , at night ,
do you remember where you were when you heard about the Atomic Bomb
I don't remember that exactly .
I should , but I don't , where we were .
what we'll do Mister Justice is we'll begin again next
then we'll talk about the Mayo years and your move from the Dorsey
but I think we'll end this session here
