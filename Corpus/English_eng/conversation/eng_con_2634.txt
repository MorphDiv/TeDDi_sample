okay .

can I ask you after class today ?
let's there are several of you who missed the comments on the paper .

I did .
so why don't we huddle in the corridor after class please because there's another class that'll come in and I don't wanna repeat the whole thing in front of class .
so we can have a consultation after class .
okay ?
alright .
&-um couple announcements but maybe you wanna start first and then I'll go into some things and then we'll go into Sarah's presentation .
&=micase_recording_announcement .
now one announcement Diane I won't use her last name .
why ?
+, recorded for us +/.
+, oh +/.
+, a an a@l and e@l program which ran Sunday night right ?
and I missed it (be)cause I never have time to watch TV .
but she recorded it .
it's a video recording and it's excellent .
&-um it's actually called The Good Book of Love colon Sex in the Bible .
&-um it's really fine .
it's quite excellent .
&-um there +//.
it's well done .
there's a_lot_of artwork in it as background the narration is good .
they have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven esteemed Biblical scholars .
giving different perspectives on the various topics on sex in the Bible .
I have put it in the Language Resource Center .
the Language Resource Center is on the second floor of the Modern Languages Building .
you can look at it I think up to five of you can look at any one time so if there's more than one of you who shows up these are the hours they're quite liberal I thought about how do I get this best &-uh how is this best accessible to you and I figured if I put into the Language Resource Center it would be very fine .
so it'll be there (un)til the end of the term it'll give you ideas .
there +//.
they +//.
the the discussion is excellent also in terms of attitudes towards sexuality in the Old Testament as opposed to the New Testament as opposed to the early Christian writers Saint Augustine and so on so look at it get some ideas it might help you with your paper who knows and &-uh thank Diane .
thank you Diane .
&-um any questions on that ?
it takes oh I don't know an hour and forty five minutes if you look at the whole thing .
so it's time well spent .
any questions or comments some of you missed last time some of you were busy dancing or dancing +//.
what was the dancing for Rina ?
it was &-um a fund+raiser for the children's hospital and Beaumont Hospital .
oh I see +/.
yeah +/.
+, which children's hospital ⌈ at Beaumont ⌉ ?
⌊ Mott ⌋ .
and Mott's .
and Mott .
okay .
did you raise lots_of money ?
yeah we did .
and you danced nonstop more or less .
yeah more or less .
&=laughs .
wow .
xxx .
okay so now you're rested .
&-um maybe you can get notes from someone .
any &-um questions or comments regarding last time's &-um session ?
one more point I wanted to make about the daughters of &~Zeloph Zelophehad .
and I alluded to it maybe I didn't stress it enough we have here a legal case Kim you'll wanna know look look back on it and if any of you wanna meet with me sometime talk about some of this it's fine .
&-um what is so interesting about that story these five daughters is not only that they present the case which we already talked about they present the legal case to the heads of the heads of the state .
I mean these are this is a little bit intimidating .
but they present it themselves .
with all the legal arguments they present it themselves .
they don't get themselves a spokesman .
they don't get themselves some man to speak for them because they're only women okay not only do they present the case legally &-uh in <in the> in the correct legal language and legal arguments and all of that but they present it themselves .
you're talking about a patriarchal society but they're not intimidated by that they hold their own they present their case well they are mentioned in Joshua that it's rehearsed in Numbers &-uh so you know they really make a point for themselves .
now how many of us present our own legal case in court ?
not many .
and so if we're intimidated by this in our modern age &-uh I think it speaks very well for women being heard being acknowledged being given recognition .
they won their own legal case it's taken to the deity .
Moses takes it to God which is only proper in his role as prophet he is the mouthpiece of God God gives the judgment but they give them a serious hearing .
and so that's one of the points I don't know if I honed in on it enough because we sort_of ran out_of time but it's very interesting in terms of setting precedent in terms of setting &-uh jurisprudence and so on .
&-uh have any of you had experience with the law ?
with legal things ?
how did that go ?
&=laughs:S3 .
good &=laughs:multiple .
good .
I've had experience with the law too .
I built this little old cottage up north .
in what after I got the foundation I had all the permits .
I got the foundation then I got a stop order .
all the constructions on the harbor it's on Presgill Harbor got stop orders .
one November .
nine constructions .
and mine among them .
they all went with a legal case with a legal firm .
I said no way am I going with a legal firm I'm not building this house on spec .
it's mine .
the logs are on site I've already paid for the roof I'll do the legal work myself .
and I did .
and it took me months .
but I got the permit .
I hadta fight the DNR the Fish Game and Wildlife Commission the &-um Army Corps US Army Corps of Engineers they know me .
&=laughs and the people in the area .
anyways .
let you know <you can> you can take your case and you can win .
so there you are .
the daughters of Zeholephad Zelophehad and I think I've said enough .
but I did wanna bring that out .
any &~q other questions or comments on that ?
then we should let Sarah have &-uh time because and take as much time as you like and then we'll go into Deborah and if we don't finish Deborah today we'll finish Deborah next time .
(0.7) .
okay .
&-um I'm gonna do &-um a presentation on the Song of Songs and &-um I just became interested in it &-um after Erin's talk when Professor Reichert said something about &-um there's the only other &-um instance of like +//.
at like &-um besides &-um Rebekah at the well of the kiss was like Song of Songs .
and then &-um I remembered my cousin's a folk singer and &-um she wrote a song based on the Song of Songs which I'll play for you later it's really short .
&-um but I brought that in .
&-um but I have a different Bible version than you so you'll just have to find it yourself but it's it's very short and I really really &-um liked it a_lot .
and it's one of my favorite &-um books in the Bible .
just because I think it's it's just really +/.
it's in ⌈ the middle ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ beautiful ⌋ language .
&-um but as far as interpretations I found so so so much information .
I'm just gonna try I'm gonna try to put as much in as I can and there's still some things that I wanna put in that I just don't have time for .
but &-um there's two main interpretations .
one is the rabbinical interpretation from the Midrash which is &-um scripture interpretation Jewish scripture interpretation and that's from the rabbis and they say that &-um it's not a love story it's not a love song it's not nuptial vows it is a metaphor between God and the Jewish people just signifying &-um the love and the marriage between God and the Jewish people .
and the covenant .
&-um and the rabbis who wrote the &~Mid the Midrash aren't exactly feminists first of all and second of all the only the way they could probably get the Song of Songs +//.
or it's also called the Song of Solomon &-um into the Bible would be to make a metaphor out_of it because it does have sexual erotic &-um undertones things that aren't supposed to be appropriate &-um for the Bible you know at that time or whatever .
&-um the structure of it is &-um is kind_of confusing sometimes because &-um in some parts of these &-um &~sh eight short chapters it's very clear that &-um there's a female voice in some it's very clear that there's a male voice and in some &-um areas it's it's kind_of ambiguous .
so Jewish feminists take that opportunity to &-um to infer God's feminine or nurturing aspects .
&-um and so that's where like the whole Jewish &~feminit the feminist Jewish &-um standpoint &~cam started in this .
&-um as far as the question of authorship &-um what the like &~th the rabbis say &-um it's attributed to Solomon .
&-um and then the first line is &{l=READING the Song of Songs which is to Solomon .
&}l=READING which could mean that A he wrote it .
B it belongs to him or C the subject matter is directed towards him .
and &-um Solomon's name is mentioned six times in &-um the book +...
&-um but another interpretation is that several people wrote different parts different poems &-um in it and then later on they were all assembled together .
&-um the Christian approach and I didn't find very much &-um on the Christian views of the Song of Songs but &-um it's supposed to be the romance of Jesus and the church with Mary as the chief female figure .
so that's the Christian approach am I going too fast ?
okay .
&-um characters .
there's two main &~char or one &-um interpretation is there's two main characters .
and one interpretation is there's three .
and I don't really see three .
but &-um the two main characters are Solomon and a Shulammite shepherdess and &-um it's the the &-um female lover is &-um the rhy@s:fra I think I don't know how to pronounce it but it's &{l=WRITING R H Y &}l=WRITING .
and that's the female and the male is the dodi@s:fra .
&=writes &-um so those are like the that interpretation with the two main characters .
&-um the one with three main characters and I didn't see this at all but I read it &-um it's Solomon and another shepherd and they're like vying for the affection of the Shulammite woman .
so that is the &-um the rabbinic approach .
the feminist approach is I just think is so awesome .
&-um and I found an entire book about the feminist approaches to the Song of Songs and there's so much good stuff in it .
&-um what it is is it +//.
like the feminists say it's it's completely secular it's one of the most +//.
only secular &-um parts that &-um is is unbiased .
and <they say> they say that there is kind_of like one opaquely &-um opaque mention of God and that's in chapter eight verse six and &-um it says &{l=READING set me as a seal upon your heart as a seal upon your arm for love is strong as death passion fierce as the grave it flashes +//.
its flashes are flashes of fire a raging flame .
&}l=READING and &-um the &~reas that +//.
the reason I see +//.
could see that but I would've hadta have been directed to see it is because &-um in Jewish tradition you have what's called tefillin@s:fra and &-um it's +//.
there's +//.
it's a box with a prayer inside attached to some leather straps and you wind it around your head and around your arms in a certain way that's supposed to symbolize the shape of God you wind it around your hand in the shape of the Jewish letter shin@s:fra which means God .
and &-um so that's why I thought it was a seal upon your arm .
and then (be)cause God has appeared in fire before .
so that's that's the only thing I see but otherwise it's it's fairly secular .
it's it can be +//.
the Song of Songs is read as less biased from the rest of the Bible because &-um the enormous significance of the female element .
&-um the &~fem feminist interpretation says that &-um they +//.
at the very least some of the poetry of the Song of Songs should be attributed to feminist perspectives or even feminist &-um authorship .
&-um and because of this the text provides &-um a way to discuss culture and reclamation of the affinities of the Song of Songs with other poems in the +//.
or other female poems in the Bible the &-um the song of Deborah the song of Miriam .
&-um so .
there's a question .
oh .
okay .
I've never read the Song of Songs so could you just give like a general +/.
sure .
+, like (be)cause I don't +//.
I've never like read it so I don't know what like it's +/.
+, it's +/.
+, about or anything .
it is &-um a dialogue and it's been called a drama between &-um the bride and the bridegroom .
it's +//.
a_lot_o(f) people think it's nuptials &-um or just people professing their love &-um it's very flowery kind of beautiful poetic language really different from the prose &-um that's the rest of the Bible or the you know stuff that isn't a song per_se and &-um +...
there I mean there's a_lot_of metaphor in it .
and like I said the metaphor like the rabbinic &-um scholars see it not at all as &-um a conversation between a man and a woman but as &-um God and the people .
is that why they think it's in here ?
⌈ because it's a metaphor ⌉ .
⌊ yeah .
that's why ⌋ .
yeah .
⌈ that's ⌉ .
⌊ that's how ⌋ they justify its inclusion .
that's +/.
+, it's a metaphor for God as the bridegroom and Israel as the bride .
so it's a celebration of the bridegroom so you can read it on a number of levels .
and one of them +//.
and that's why it's in the canon it's canonized .
it's part of the sanctified text .
is that it's seen on that level .
as a metaphor between God the &~b bridegroom and Israel the bride .
because in Amos for example Hosea .
God is the the the husband and Israel is the wife .
that's one level .
but that's a little hard to see .
but that's how some people interpret it .
&-um but what Sarah's saying and I would concur it's it's a celebration of sexuality primarily seen from the woman's voice .
I mean if you really wanna celebrate sex there it is .
read it .
it's interesting .
and read a modern more modern translation than this one or read several .
go to Borders .
go to &-um Shaman Drum .
sit there .
you don't hafta buy the book .
there's a book called Discovering Eve .
and I can't remember the author right now .
I didn't read it but I was it was &-um +/.
yeah +/.
+, somebody suggested it to me .
&-um that as far as social attitudes go it's &~com it seems like it has completely different social attitude from like the patriarchical &-um other parts of the Bible .
&-um it shows a loving couple &-um very &-um equal &-um relationship .
and &~i which is singular in the Old Testament .
because it really +//.
it doesn't very +//.
it doesn't show often &-um equality of the husband and the wife the man and the woman .
&-um and the &~f &-um female voice and the female figure is much more prominent .
&-um there's allusions to matrilineal and matrilocal &~sys@n values and what that means anthropologically is matrilineal is where you trace your family line through your mother and matrilocal means that you live where your mother lives .
&-um it it isn't however matriarchical which is &-um it's &~beca because the entire Bible's written in a patriarchical sense .
&-um and this kind of ties into &-um modern Jewish thought .
&-er and I mean even previous Jewish thought is that &-um the religion of your child depends on &-um the religion of the mother .
like for instance my father's &-um very Irish Catholic except my mother's Jewish so I was raised Jewish .
so that's &-um how it's &-um that's like a matrilineal line .
&-um .
it's just like Moses's mother .
&-um there are &{l=SIC fratrilineal &}l=SIC &=laughs:S3 and &-um &{l=SIC fratriarchical &}l=SIC &-um aspects .
which means the power belongs to the women's brothers .
&-um and I'll get into that a little bit later .
&-um but there are no or very few or no apparent references to a patriarchical society .
and I think this is really cool because it's just it's like a stepping stone for constructions of social order it just if I mean even even if you know after you get through the Song of Songs and then you just go back to regular it's just &~kin it just kind_of was like a ray of light or a ray of hope &-um for women that's the way I I read it .
the words of &-um the rhy@s:fra the woman lover comprise most of the book and the most important element is of her wishful thinking of her dreams &-um of her hopes and her love and which &~d &~wh it all determines the plot and the framework of the whole book and it's &~a it's all hers .
so I just thought that was really cool .
like &~wh I mean if you take +//.
and &~i it doesn't take very long if you go through it pretty thoroughly you can just like you can just see how much more she is involved in it than &-um the male role .
which is not to say anything bad about the male role it's just that she has the majority of the emotion and of the text and stuff in here .
there's three detailed &-um descriptions of her of the female lover in &-um the book and only one of the male and &-um it's &~bec &-um a_lot_of &-um like Egyptian poetry .
I read a_lot about Egyptian poetry because &-um Egyptian and Arabic Islamic because &-um it's all kind_of a little bit related .
and Egyptian poetry only depicts the female body never the male but they don't really I I it seemed when I was reading it that they don't really do it in kind of &-um a gawking way just to show the beauty .
and the Song of Songs is considered a wedding song by a_lot_of people .
and &-um very often there's bits of the Song of Songs in nuptial vows and in Jewish weddings only the beauty of the bride are sung .
it's all about &-um you know the bride and her beauty and &~h her day .
and &-um this is +//.
I'll play you the song now .
&-um this my cousin Julie lives in California and she's a folk singer .
and &-um &~sh my she has a sister named Robin my other cousin .
and &-um she wrote it for her sister .
and sang it at her wedding and then later put it on this album .
so I think it's really pretty .
(0.10) it's called &-um the title of the song is You Have Captured My Heart .
and if you read &-um the Song of Songs then &-um you should be able to recognize some lines .
taken directly from the text .
&=start_sound_clip .
it's like three minutes long so xxx &=end_sound_clip .
&-um so that's the song .
&-um and &=latecomer_arrives .
come sit down .
I didn't want to interrupt .
I was just &-um I'm doing the Song of Songs and I was just playing a song that my cousin wrote that &-um is +//.
that comes from the book .
&-um so I mean there's lines like &-um in chapter two verse two it says &{l=READING as a lily among the brambles &}l=READING and &~li my and &-um and the song says like a lily among the thorns it &~sa my beloved &-um &{l=READING my beloved is mine and I am his .
&}l=READING that's two sixteen .
&{l=READING how sweet is your love my sister my bride .
&}l=READING that's four ten .
so I mean she just kind_of &-um took various lines and put them in where they fit .
&-um the way of life &-um is feminine it's +//.
never talks about &-um any fathers or &-um or any male &~dominat &-uh any male dominated society .
&-um the bride &-um refers to my mother's house several times which infers that her father's dead .
so &-um that's where the &{l=SIC fratrilineage &}l=SIC comes in (be)cause once her fathers die her brothers take over .
&-um King &~Solom &-uh when it talks about Solomon it only talks about his mother .
and <in thirty> &+ei in thirty eleven it says &{l=READING look oh daughters of Zion at King Solomon at the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding on the day of &~hi of the gladness in his heart .
&}l=READING &-um so it appears that his mother has an important role in his wedding as_well .
&-um King Solomon &-um &~i I mean &~n &~no now I'm I'll just give you some numbers about &-um the different sexes that are mentioned various times .
King Solomon talks about his friends his &~is his companions .
it says twice in passing and it's just in the third person .
&-um while the bride's own friends and she calls them daughters of Jerusalem daughters of Zion are mentioned seven times .
&-um it mentions daughters or young women five times .
and I in reference to the female lover <more than> &~twe more than a dozen times .
&-um does anybody have any questions so far ?
mhm .
&-um in chapter one it talks +//.
it has the &-um first person plural .
in verse four .
&{l=READING we rejoice and delight in you we will praise your love more than wine .
&}l=READING &-um I was just wondering ⌈ what you thought that was ⌉ ?
⌊ that's part of my question actually ⌋ .
&-um <I think> I think that she's talking I mean it's I think she's talking &-um I think it's the bride and her friends are talking &-uh or &-um her +...
I think it's her friends actually talking to her .
right .
the &~tradition interpretation of this that I'm familiar with is that there's the bride and the groom and there's these group of friends or who are kind of narrators .
&-uh and they kind of pitch in from time to time .
&-uh so I was .
yeah other women and that's that's the refrain +/.
yeah yeah +/.
+, or the chorus .
and that's one of the interpretations .
&-um oh okay .
I thought this was really neat .
and this &-um I think that this is &-um I wanna say Phyllis Trible &-um in this collection of &~wome of feminists who wrote this really great book and I I'll put the source on the board afterwards .
&-um in in &~th Genesis in the Adam and Eve story when God punishes or curses Eve and says &-um you shall desire your husband and he will &-um be your master .
and &-um &~i the woman's inclination and the woman's desire subjugate her to Adam .
Eve to Adam .
but in the Song of Songs &-um chapter seven verse ten it says I am my lover's his desire is for me .
so here I think she unties this bondage from Genesis and then we encounter a new relationship between the two sexes .
and it's equality and &-um mutuality so I really liked that part a_lot .
there were +...
In the Wake of the Goddesses there weren't very many things but it said Tikva Frymer_Kensky says that the Bible treats sex as just kind_of like it's a commodity or it's just something &-um for procreation and it's it's all about with whom and where and when .
and &-um in the Song of Songs sex is unconstrained or sex sexuality or eroticism is unconstrained &-um by social considerations .
and &-um it recognizes the &~s that &-um sex comes from love and not just procreation or &-um you know marriage in terms of &-um a &~ma creating alliances .
so &-um love comes from love .
and &-um she's never called a wife she's never asked to procreate &-um never asked to childbear@n$v .
&-um so that's that's that one that is In the Wake of the Goddesses .
&-um the last thing that I wanted to say was &-um that in the medieval times in Portugal &-um &~ab women used to come together and sing to each_other about women just like in a celebration and there's a really remarkable degree of similarity between the Song of Songs and then it's called the Cantigas@s:fra de@s:fra Amigo@s:fra &=writes:board they make it for interpretation .
&-um and they call each_other beautiful which &-um I really like .
and in &-um +...
and in &~chap in chapter one verse five it says I'm black and beautiful .
and so it's just &-um the &~re oh I read the reason it says I'm black and beautiful it's because she's not supposedly she's not royalty she's a commoner and she's been working in the vineyards or working in the pasture so her skin is all tanned .
and &-um &-um you know just her own &-um like I don't know that she thinks she's beautiful that &-um I really like that part .
and &-um that's I mean that's basically all I have I just &-um I really like it because &-um there's a_lot_of strong women in the Bible but <it doesn't> it doesn't give a_lot_of description of them and it doesn't give them a_lot_of depth .
you can just kind_of see by their actions that they're strong but &-um +...
women as lovers with emotional depth aren't really shown except for in here .
and &-um most of them are given the short shrift and I really like that this was mainly &-um a women's thing in here .
does anybody have any questions ?
(0.4) ⌈ do you ⌉ .
⌊ comments ⌋ .
<I was> I was just gonna ask if &-um what you guys thought about the interpretation how you feel about &-um the meaning of the metaphor with &-um the rabbinic metaphor or a feminist metaphor or if there's like a mix of both .
<I think> I think it probably could be a mix of both like I think both interpretations are valuable I think like the feminist interpretation is in +//.
is really valuable on a personal level .
I think and especially to women in sexuality and even to men in sexuality and I think that the Rabbinic &-um thing is also really &-um a good interpretation for religious purposes and for like faith purposes and it it could be a really beautiful poem .
&-um to express like &-um a relationship with God and the people too .
I think that both interpretations are good ones .
I've also heard an interpretation that &-um the Song of Songs was like about God's gift of like love and sexuality and marriage to to people .
like like a gift for us .
and that it was written in there like because nowhere else does it say it .
&-um I don't know (be)cause +...
<all the> all the mainly poetic books are pretty much lumped together .
and like a_lot_of (th)em are about like all kinds of random things but this one's like all about like love marriage and this this whole theme and &~i and I I don't know one interpretation is just that it was in there to show that it was a gift for us or something .
<I don't> I don't have references for that though .
no I I it sounds familiar and I think that that's really cool I like that a_lot .
&-um it's interesting that you talked about you know the Bible's view of sex and I don't think the &~who the entire Bible is antisex I mean &=laughs ⌈ <you can> ⌉ .
⌊ I don't think +//.
⌋ go ahead .
&~y your statement was a little I think overgeneral I thought .
I mean you can find other references especially in the New Testament I think that that &-uh indicate that it's a gift and .
I &-um I think no <I don't think it> I don't think it's I don't think it's looked down upon but I think in terms of &-um I just I really don't like &-um when they say it &~ju I mean it's archaic language obviously but when they say he knew he lay with her it just seems like a chore or something .
you know and &-um +...
the the Midrash isn't obviously for the New Testament so and that's what I did research on the rabbinic &-um research of it .
but &-um +...
&~y no I I don't think that the Bible is wholly &~again anti sexuality .
but I do think that &-um it's very cautious maybe even overly cautious .
in a modern sense .
(0.6) anybody else ?
I think it's &-uh a wonderful statement of sexuality .
the way it starts the Song of Songs .
that's &-um already hyperbole that's the highest song .
it's and it's a poem and it's a song .
it's the highest song .
that's what it means .
Song of Songs .
and then it starts into a celebration of love .
the imagery is of of fruit of figs of wine <of of> of of pomegranates of mandrakes it's all a &~cel a celebration of love and sexuality .
<in a> in a very positive way and and upholds that and I think you're absolutely right &-um and it's uninhibited and that's the beauty of it .
a celebration of uninhibited eroticism .
and that's what makes it so unusual in the Bible .
and they did include it in the canon .
and that's interesting too .
but you start out with sexual imagery .
&{l=READING oh that you would kiss me with the kisses of your mouth for your love is better than wine .
your anointing oils are fragrant .
your name is oil poured out .
&}l=READING it's already a celebration .
and then as you said in the next verse &-um well even before that &{l=READING we will extol and rejoice in you .
we will extol our +//.
your love more than wine ripely do they love you .
&}l=READING and then the next verse &{l=READING I am dark and beautiful .
&}l=READING that's that's the translation it's not here but that you know scholars have argued that is the correct way to interpret it it's not but it's and .
and so all of what she's done she's been out in the field she's been in the vineyard she's been in the sun she's beautiful and the whole thing is a celebration and it's it's overt eroticism &{l=READING upon my bed at night I sought him .
&}l=READING I mean it keeps going it's wonderful poetry and it's a real celebration .
and it takes you right back to the Garden of Eden with all of these springtime ritual the blossoms in spring .
&-um God brings Eve to Adam .
so that they will be one flesh that's the celebration of marriage .
and you have it all over here the same kind of imagery as you have in the Garden of Eden .
and I think that's &-um intensifies that .
if that adds anything I don't know .
yes ?
I was gonna say too that I mean even if it is looked at as &-um even if it's taken as an interpretation of God's relationship with Israel the fact that they use such &-um sexual &-um images and and ideas says something for the sexual experience .
mhm +/.
+, I mean the fact that they're using that &-um in that interpretation to represent a relationship between God and humans really says a_lot for how &-um amazing and wonderful human sexual experiences are .
that they can use it that way so .
and the description of the anatomy it's all there .
none of it's couched .
I mean they talk about all of the you know all of the female body .
the breasts everything on down .
&-um in in a language of celebration .
it's really quite remarkable .
so yeah .
there's another &-um thing that I didn't mention but it it's kind_of &-um interesting is it's just &-uh &-uh this is just something I got off the web and and it it's an interpretation that it's it's all about unity .
and that especially in the kiss .
&-um it says in here that the kiss of love &~ext extends into four spirits and the spirits are supernal the supernal chariot companionship &~unis unison and wholeness .
and the four spirits are the four limbs of the body .
and when two people kiss or two people join &-um maybe in intercourse or something that each of the four spirits or each of the &~pa four limbs of the body they flow into one another and <they all> &~beco they all unite .
and I think it's +//.
really makes a statement about unity and equality because everything that we've read so so far is &-um is just the difference between the women and there just seems to be at least for me there just seems to be such a huge gap between the men and the women and they're always &-um separated by just &~tha something that's not equal .
and &-um that it's &{l=READING let him kiss with the kisses of his mouth &}l=READING it's the second &-um verse .
that's what &-um this says here .
and then there's some Hebrew letters that &-um denote this spirit &-um the four spirits whatever .
so I just I liked that whole the unity idea .
if you look at chapter two verse sixteen and seventeen .
&{l=READING my beloved is mine and I am his .
&}l=READING that's sexual union .
&{l=READING he pastures his flock among the lilies .
&}l=READING lilies has been used as a metaphor for women's genitalia .
so what what are they talking about ?
it's quite clear .
&=laughs:multiple &{l=READING until the day breeze and the shadows flee &}l=READING so it's all about a night of love making .
&{l=READING turn my beloved be like a gazelle or a young stag upon a rugged mountain &}l=READING or upon upon rugged mountains .
those are the breasts .
I mean it's really it's the imagery's beautiful but and it's lofty .
but it's very graphic it's right there .
I think <that that> that that if &-um there there &~i you know people were trying to get this in regardless of what they thought &-um what the authors wrote it as I think that they were very smart in getting it in there &-um for whomever's &-um you know for whatever point of view you take it for &-um you know it's in there .
I mean that's that's the point that it's in there and I think &~whate however you interpret it or &~ho whatever you take from it from you know however many interpretations there are it's important .
did you say that this like from your research like it was credited to Solomon ?
because like when he wrote a_lot_of this stuff it was after like his like he had turned away from God and come back and it seems like +...
I don't know I just had this funny thought that like like if he had that kind of experience like if it was a man writing this it would be more likely to be about like the actual like less than metaphorical sense .
you know like he was using all these metaphors to describe like sexual relations but it's probably less likely that it was like him thinking about this is God's union with Israel .
you know what I mean ?
it's not attributed to Solomon .
&-uh it's linked to Solomon somehow because Solomon had he built the temple .
he was he had wisdom .
somehow it it it comes at that point in Israel where they're at the height their golden age .
and so the song is linked to him in that way .
but they don't attribute authorship +//.
well they argue about it but I don't think ⌈ <it's his> ⌉ .
⌊ but &~a ⌋ in the Anchor Bible Dictionary it says it has no &~att like no one has &~con like said that there's one you know one attributed author there's continuous arguments about it .
it could've been someone in his court though that he hired or ⌈ that's why it could be in the yeah ⌉ .
⌊ it comes &~fr yeah from a high period ⌋ <of of> of of literacy in in &-uh the history of Israel .
thank you Sarah .
that was very nice +...
any other questions or comments ?
before we go on to the account of Deborah and Jael +...
okay .
it's just very interesting and I left a book there for you in case you wanna take a look I finally dug it out_of my library .
okay .
(0.5) let's go on to the story of Deborah Judges four and five .
it's a marvelous story .
we may not finish it that's alright .
it's a very very interesting story and yet not much space is given to it you could blink and you'd miss it .
&-um but it's a celebration of woman +...
in a number of aspects .
she is &-um &~s we have some other sources in Josephus she was called or she had &-um the the &-um the task of keeping the tabernacle lamps in the priestly tradition .
so that's a sort_of a lowly task but nonetheless important to the temple tradition highly regarded she's a prophetess and the prophetess is the mouthpiece of the deity of God .
she is called a judge in the account she's also a visionary .
she has a sense of the future she has a sense of mission you might say she's &-um parallel to perhaps their version of Joan of Arc .
she's a military leader she wins victories .
how do we &-um get to all that ?
&-um she +...
is introduced into the text in chapter four Israel is <in a> &~sen in a time of trial .
&-um they have been &-um under the king Jabin for twenty years &-uh he's been king of Canaan he's oppressed Israel &-um that's in some of the other accounts the vineyards have been destroyed the women have been dishonored we know what that means .
&-um the children have been slain many have turned to worship idols .
so it's a low point in the history of Israel .
but we're in Judges and Judges is sort_of &-uh in a sense &-uh a a heroic time .
and so then we get into the story of Deborah .
in Judges four &~th verse three where there's Sisera his army .
how many chariots does he have ?
nine hundred +/.
+, nine hundred chariots .
that's a_lot_of chariots &=laughs:multiple right ?
how many armed warriors go with this ?
so that's a huge army .
and chariots are formidable weapons .
and don't +//.
you know don't underrate them .
&=laughs:multiple we're in the Iron Age .
Israel hasn't got chariots .
what pulls chariots ?
+, horses .
+, horses .
well they barely started having horses they've got them well it's still early but nonetheless Israel doesn't have chariots they don't have iron &-uh much of an iron culture they don't have horses they don't have the equipment they don't have the arms they don't have the iron and here's Sisera lording it over them &{l=READING and he oppressed the people cruelly for twenty years .
&}l=READING the end of verse three .
and then we're introduced to this woman Deborah a prophetess she's a wife .
she's not stressed for her wifely role but she's a wife .
and what does she do ?
she's judging Israel at that time .
where does she judge ?
what's her seat ?
where's her seat ?
where does she do this judging ?
she sits under like a tree .
she sits under a tree what kind_of a tree ?
palm tree .
a palm tree called +...
Deborah +/.
+, Deborah .
she has her own palm tree .
this is her ground .
this is the palm tree called Deborah .
the palms were stately .
and &-um she's in the hill country here between Bethel and &-um &-um Ramah in the hill country you could look at it on the map .
we'll look at the +//.
it +//.
in +//.
on the map in a minute .
and it's repeated the people of Israel came to her for judgment .
now the people of Israel are under oppression .
what kind of cases is she hearing ?
and judging ?
and she's judging them she has this plateau she's got this great palm tree she sits under .
she's up from Jericho in the hill country .
you can imagine +//.
it doesn't tell us but she's listening to their cases and she's judging and they're coming to her from everywhere .
she's well known .
she's highly regarded .
so what does she do then ?
she sends for and summons Barak from the son of &~Abinoa Noam from Kadesh in Naphtali .
so she sends for the foremost military leader and he comes .
now that's rather remarkable .
look at your map .
in the back you have your maps right ?
remember your maps ?
map three .
Israel and Canaan Joshua to Samuel and Saul .
and you look at up from Jerusalem (0.5) you see &-uh Bethel .
she's between Ramah and Bethel .
do you see it there ?
up in the hill country .
and then she sends (0.4) &-um for Barak .
and he's in &-um Kadesh .
now look at where Kadesh is .
you go past the Lake of Kinneret which is the Lake of Galilee you keep going up the Jordan River and you see Kadesh there .
do you see it ?
that's a long way away .
he's not just in the neighboring town .
and later on the battle will take &-uh place at the River of Kishon near the Mount Carmel .
do you see it there ?
Harosheth Haggoyim <near the> &-um near the Mediterranean .
so that's where you're going to have the battle lines drawn .
but she sends for him way up north and he comes down .
so all of this is kind_of an understatement .
and she summons him and she says to him the Lord God of Israel commands you .
that's her role as prophetess she speaks through God .
she is &-uh speaks through the Deity and then she orders him &{l=READING gather your men at Mount Tabor taking ten thousand from the tribe of Naphtali and from the tribe of Zebulun and I will draw out Sisera the general of Jabin's army to meet you by the River Kishon with his chariots and his troops and I will give him into your hand .
&}l=READING so she's calling him out she's commanding him she's got a battle plan she's got all kinds of confidence she conveys it to him .
and a_lot_of it is behind the scenes .
she trusts God first she's the counselor of the people the judge in their disputes then she becomes the deliverer of the people she makes a plan they've been oppressed for twenty years nobody else has come along .
so she trusted God implicitly she could inspire in others this same trust .
she inspires it in Barak sort_of not right away +...
&-um Barak says to her and these are the most unusual lines in Biblical history .
he says this mighty general .
&{l=READING if you will go with me I will go .
if you will not go I won't go .
&}l=READING okay ?
and she responds &{l=READING I will surely go with you .
&}l=READING she doesn't say oh wait lemme ask my husband right ?
she makes her own decisions .
she says yes I will surely go and then she prophesies some more .
&-um so she she's in a sense the personification of this free spirit in Israel .
she understands what she's doing she's got all kinds of self-confidence .
&-um she says &{l=READING the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory .
for God will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman .
&}l=READING now you're gonna think she means herself .
but she doesn't .
okay ?
but she does +//.
it's like a riddle .
we've we've run into riddles before right ?
so it's like a oracle .
&-um so Sisera you're not gonna get the glory for this a woman is gonna get the glory .
and then she arose and went with Barak to Kadesh and then Barak summons the army .
these ten thousand so he's doing it on her word on her confidence on her inspiration on her vision .
&-um so in a sense she becomes the chieftain .
from the role of homemaker &-uh keeper of tabernacle lights she now &-uh is in the hill country and &-uh and is is becoming military leader coleader .
so together they work out a plan of action .
together &-um they they plan and plot .
he gathers the men and it repeats again &~l last part of verse ten Deborah went up with him .
then we get &-um to this next little these +//.
the next verse Heber that's really anticipating what comes next .
Heber who's he ?
+, Kenite .
+, he's a Canaanite Heber the Kenite .
&-uh they're descendants of Hobab he's the father in+law of Moses and they've &~pit &{l=READING he's pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim which is near Kadesh .
&}l=READING so but who is Heber anybody know ?
remember ?
he's Jael's husband .
he's Jael's husband .
so here we're introduced to Jael's husband .
and the reason for this introduction here is <that &-um> that &-um Sisera thinks that the Kenite is going to be loyal to him .
&-um and so that's &-um they they had separated themselves and they were sort_of off in their own tents so they're itinerant they're they're wanderers and they're living in tents .
and then we get back to the main action .
&-um (0.6) so Sisera gathers his chariots his nine hundred chariots of iron it it repeats it for emphasis and all the men who were with him and they get to the river Kishon .
&-um and then there's Deborah .
and you can sort_of see her standing on a rock she is the one who tells him what to do .
she is the one who inspires him to action .
&-um she says what does she say ?
up up up get up .
she tells him .
&{l=READING this is the day in which the Lord has given Sisera into your hand .
does not the Lord go out before you ?
&}l=READING so she's telling him she's dictating the action she's commanding the beginning of the battle .
she says up Barak .
and so Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him so he's he's got his ten thousand it's repeated now from other sources .
from Josephus .
do you remember Josephus ?
okay .
he's the historian I mentioned before .
from Josephus we know and also from the song of Deborah which comes later we get some pieces of information on how the battle went .
the the text here doesn't tell us .
but Josephus says that &{l=READING the storm of sleet and hail burst out over the plain from the east driving into the face of Sisera and his men and his charioteers .
&}l=READING and the slingers and the archers do you remember the movie Ben_Hur ?
&=laughs:multiple how do they fight with chariots ?
(0.4) how does it work ?
don't they run into each_other ?
yeah in Ben_Hur they do they have this race .
&-um .
I thought they sort_of &-uh they'll run up and fire their arrows you know sort_of and then turn around and run back or &=laughs .
so it's not the best way of fighting .
the &-um the the Greeks then under Alexander the Great developed the stirrups well actually they were developed a little sooner but then you had a horseman on a horse with stirrups and &~s then he could fire the arms without having another man guide the horses .
see in the chariot you've got someone guiding the chariots and then these other guys in the chariot firing away but it's a very cumbersome way of fighting .
so anyways &-uh the storm came the sleet and hail in their faces &-um handicapping the men and and and the chariots and the slingers and archers were disabled by the beating rain and the swordsmen were crippled by the biting cold .
I'm sure they weren't wearing stuff I mean or else what were they wearing ?
cloaks ?
and that hampers your arms .
&-um Deborah and Barak had the storm behind them .
and they saw &-uh that the storm was lashing the enemy and they pushed on .
and of_course this is Yahweh the storm God .
this is divine providence this is the Deity looking after them I'm sure giving them courage .
&-um as is +//.
as Deborah had prophesied .
and then with all this rain and sleet &-uh the flood waters went down the Kishon River and what happened to the chariots ?
they sank in the mud .
whereas these foot soldiers who didn't have much of anything except their hand arms slew the enemy .
they were not hampered by weight they were not hampered by iron they weren't hampered by &-um &~s &-uh shields and and arms that that are heavy so then you go on with the story &-uh the &~la Lord routed Sisera .
that's really what this is all about .
and Josephus see &-uh augments the story .
&{l=READING and all his chariot and all his army before Barak at the edge of the sword and Sisera alighted from his chariot &}l=READING so so Sisera then what does he do this heroic guy ?
+, ⌊ he leaves ⌋ his soldiers in the lurch and runs off .
<that is> that is not what the leader of the army's supposed to do right ?
&=laughs:multiple he runs away .
&{l=READING he fled away on foot and Barak pursued the chariots and the army Tarud to Harosheth Haggoyim and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword not a man was left .
&}l=READING that's a complete rout .
&-um and of_course &-um the Israelites may have had geographic advantage and so on we don't know .
so here's the only guy that was left and he fled away on foot &{l=READING Sisera to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber &}l=READING there you are and &-um and &{l=READING there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber .
&}l=READING so &~Ja so Sisera thinks he's safe .
and Jael comes out and invites him into the tent .
very interesting .
and she says to him &{l=READING turn aside my lord have no fear .
&}l=READING she doesn't say I'm not gonna do anything to you she says have no fear .
you might say that's a little misleading .
&=laughs:multiple and so he went into her tent and she covered him with a rug .
see why is she covering him with a rug ?
just relaxing him to get him +...
comfortable warm and sleepy .
yeah he's cold he's been out in the sleet in the ice he's soaked to the skin .
she's covering him with a rug he's he's he needs to get warm and he said to her give me a little water so he asks for water to drink .
what does she give him ?
to +//.
milk +/.
+, pardon ?
+, ⌈ milk ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ milk ⌋ why ?
to put him to sleep better .
yeah .
⌈ see .
when you've raised children ⌉ +/.
⌊ warm milk xxx ⌋ &=laughs:multiple +/.
+, when you've raised kids you know .
+, ⌊ you give (th)em something to eat ⌋ what do they do next ?
they fall ⌈ asleep ⌉ .
+, ⌊ throw up ⌋ .
+, I used to take Michael up north my grandson it's always a long trip .
what do I do about an hour into the trip ?
I feed him and he eats and next thing you know he's sound asleep in the seat next to me .
the the word stillen@s:fra +...
in German ein@s:fra Kind@s:fra stillen@s:fra ein@s:fra Baby@s:fra stillen@s:fra means to nurse a baby .
and &-uh to quiet a baby .
&-uh so that's where you get the English be still .
right ?
so you give a baby milk every mother knows it .
and &-uh then you put the baby to sleep .
so here he is Sisera in the tent .
&-um and she's giving him the milk &-uh the curds and whatever .
and he's nice and satisfied .
and then he says okay watch out .
she's been having this in mind all along she takes the tent peg .
right ?
&-um now what does that tell you about her ?
she's strong .
she's strong .
she's determined .
she gets only one chance .
right ?
if she blows it she's had it .
and don't think a man's skull isn't very tough .
&-um so +/.
especially that guy's +/.
+, &=laughs:multiple yeah .
so you know how does she succeed ?
does she succeed ?
+, mhm +/.
+, she drives the pent tent peg right through his his skull +/.
+, ⌈ xxx and he died ⌉ .
+, ⌊ it's temples ⌋ into the ground .
on the first first try .
she only gets one .
&-um she goes softly to him .
&-um and he was fast asleep from weariness .
he's been through a heck of a battle .
and &-uh then Barak pursued Sisera and Jael went out to meet him and what does she say to to Barak ?
(0.4) you're looking for Sisera right ?
he's occupied at the moment .
&=laughs .
I will show you ⌈ where he is ⌉ .
⌊ he's tied up ⌋ +/.
+, she doesn't say oh well you know I'm this great hero and I've I've done the guy in already .
no she takes him into the tent and lets him see for himself .
that's high drama and understatement .
I mean this whole story is really a marvelous story in the way it just sort of flows .
&{l=READING come and I will show you the man you are seeking and so he went into her tent and there lay Sisera dead with a tent peg in his temple &}l=READING again repetition for emphasis .
and then &-um it says &{l=READING on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel and the hand of the people of Israel bore harder and harder on Jabin and so on until he destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
&}l=READING and then we get into the song of Deborah and that's probably what we have to do that next (be)cause there's a_lot in the song .
any questions so far ?
it's really a great story .
do you think so ?
mhm .
yeah .
it's cool .
so take another look at the song of Deborah &=student_shakes_head you don't think so ?
&-um with you know with that in mind because the song of Deborah elaborates some things .
it's a high song it's a great song it's a heroic song .
we'll talk about the song of Deborah some more and then we'll get into Jephthah's daughter and Beth is going to talk to us .
right ?
on rape next time ?
yeah on Valentine's Day .
pardon me ?
on Valentine's Day I'm talking about rape .
ah yes .
I hadn't made that connection .
<it's true> .
happy Valentine's Day everybody .
so I will show you some slides because we have some great slides .
not so many .
but they're really very fine .
