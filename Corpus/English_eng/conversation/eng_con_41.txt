on a dark cold night, a policeman was walking down the street
he came across a gentleman who was standing there who was smoking a
and the policeman asked him was everything all right .
he told the policeman everything was fine .
and but that that he was there waiting for a friend .
he was also looking for a restaurant that he and his friend had had
so he named the restaurant .
and the policeman informed him that the restaurant was no longer in
I believe he said it was hadn't been in existence for about
so the gentleman proceeded to tell the police that he was expecting
and they had planned to have dinner like they did twenty years ago
so the policeman asked him was he going to hold his friend to that
and he said “no” .
well he would give him about twenty minutes .
he would wait at least twenty minutes after ten for him .
<so the policeman continued> <the policeman continued to>
and continue on his beat .
and as he was getting ready to leave the gentleman struck a match .
and lit his cigarette .
and as he lit the cigarette when he struck the match it lit his
and the policeman was able to see his face .
so the policeman went on down the street .
and continued to check businesses .
and the gentleman continued to wait for his friend .
and shortly thereafter, a tall slender man came along .
and presented hisself@d .
he spoke to the gentleman .
he said +"/.
+" hi Bob .
and Bob assumed that it was his friend of twenty years whose name
and so he asked +"/.
+" is that you Jimmy ?
and the guy said +"/.
+" yes .
and so they they greeted one another .
and Bob informed him that the restaurant that they had eaten in was
but suggested that they go somewhere else .
and eat .
but then as Bob looked at who he thought was Jimmy <he said that>
+" are you Jimmy_Wells ?
because he didn't look like the Jimmy_Wells he knew .
and as it turned out the guy was not Jimmy_Wells .
and the guy informed him that his picture was posted as somebody
and that the policeman had asked him to approach Bob .
and as it turned out, the policeman ended up being Jimmy_Wells .
but the policeman had to get someone else to go back to approach
and arrest him because Bob was his friend .
and <he couldn't> he wasn't going to be able to arrest him .
and that's the end of the story .
well now I'm going to tell you this story .
and I don't know if I should .
but I'm going to tell it because I'm having a hard time thinking of
but the reason I'm going to tell this story is because I just
we were talking about the good old times .
and how times had changed .
and I was speaking to him about how me and my best friend .
well <we talked> I was talking about some of the things that we
and one of the things that I was telling him about was an
and see shows .
and we used to love to go see James_Brown, the Temptations, and
we were young girls .
and I don't know if I should say just how young we were .
but we looked a_lot older than our age .
but we used to go to the Howard frequently .
and we used to meet a number of young men around the Howard .
and I think that they probably all thought we were older than we
so they used to talk to us .
and there used to be a barbershop that was around the corner from
and they use to call it Seventh and T@l .
and there were a couple of barbers in there that we knew .
and we used to go around to the barbershop because most of the men
and at that time <people used to> men used to have their hair
so we used to be around there when the entertainers would come in .
and get their hair processed .
and it was always a_lot_of fun because they would get in the
and they would sing .
and dance just like they would on stage .
so we got to meet a_lot_of people .
and I was telling my brother how things are so different because
<they weren't I mean> they might have said little complimentary
but nobody put their hands on us .
or tried to abuse us or anything .
and we used to really have a nice time .
and <I was also> I was telling him about how I ended up
or at the nightclub that was across the street from the Howard
now my girlfriend and I one day had the guys, the barbers at
and we were below the drinking age .
just let me put it that way .
but we were sitting there .
<and they didn't> I don't know if they knew how old we were .
but they brought us Champale, which is a drink that I don't even
but we were sitting there sipping Champale with our sunglasses on .
and somebody offered wanted to take a picture of us .
so they took this picture of of my girlfriend and I with these
and I took the picture home .
and then <a girlfriend> another girlfriend of mine came
and my father answered the door .
and there was something of hers, I can't even remember what it was
a book or something of hers that I had .
she asked my father if he could find it for her .
as my father proceeded to look at some of my personal belongings .
and found this picture of me and my other girlfriend in the bar
needless to say, it was quite a while before I went back to the
and <that to me well, that was> that's the end of that story .
but <it was very> it wasn't funny at the time .
but I can look at it .
and laugh now .
but all of this is just to say that at one time you could do a_lot
and have fun .
and people didn't bother you .
and It wasn't dangerous like it is now .
but I don't know .
the moral of the story is maybe <you shouldn't>
or you definitely will get caught .
