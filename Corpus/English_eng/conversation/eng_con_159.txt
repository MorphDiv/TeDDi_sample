do they have an idea ?
they there are many theories theories .
theories .
yeah theories .
I can't get the words right sometimes .
that's okay .
I understand you though so it's okay .
theories .
there's some theories .
a lot of theory .
one <is prob(bably)> is a giant asteroid crashed the earth .
mmhm .
and just blocked the dust .
so the dinosaurs can't eat everything .
<don't have many things> the plant+eaters don't have many
only they die .
so the meat+eaters will will starve too .
then they will probably kill each other for some food .
mmhm .
&~mmm xxx there's there's more plant+eaters more than
they won't have <enough things to> enough things .
another one is just the world got too cold or too hot for the
why would it get too cold or too hot ?
&-uh probably the weather changed .
okay yeah .
probably the ice age were gonna come .
mmhm .
<and then din(osaurs)> well another theories was was about
this xxx I don't think you understand this .
it's <there were small furry animals animals called>
and they probably just steal the dinosaurs eggs to eat .
what's that theory called ?
mmhm .
that's probably for killing .
that means the won't +...
but actually I don't know +...
that's that's for the &~e .
<the debate > the animals will <eat their> eat the
mmhm .
so what theory do you think is true ?
hm: my my grandpa told me it was about volcanoes !
what's that theory ?
volcano blast !
uhhuh .
and the lava just just went down .
and probably burned the plants and was the dinosaurs .

do you believe your grandpa ?
I don't know .
<I think> me and my friend have an imaginary bad guy called
car+bumper+zero+eight !
uhhuh .
he says the dinosaur's extinction was about &~s +...
a long time ago there's something called lava .
it have a kind of poison gas .
xxx was called lava .
sees how a volcano is blasts out a poison gas .
mmhm .
and it'll go down into the grass .
after a plant+eater eat it the grass <and their egg> so so
that's how he say it .
what's his name again ?
car+bumper+zero+eight .
it and and actually xxx eat grass .
and <the eggs> the eggs they were +...
<they they they they they> they laid &~on +...
can't <can't be> <can't be ba(by)> can't hatch baby
I don't think I believe that .
that's a new theor(y) theories .
(be)cause I scientist in China found found dinosaur eggs .
and break the shell <and see> and sees there's something in
mmhm .
<and some &~s> <and some of> some scientists said <the
and just flew away ?
&-uh birds are the closest ancestors of of of of
