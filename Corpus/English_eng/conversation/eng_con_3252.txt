it fails . 0_461
all right ? 461_2126
therefore, to prove identity, we will use this method . 2126_9398
we will try to change the left_hand side or right_hand side to be expanded form and then compare each term . 9398_19510
when all the terms are the same, then we say that it is an identity . 19510_24958
but if there are some different terms, then we will not say that it is an identity . 24958_30698
then it will be a normal equation only . 30698_33181
okay ? 33181_34916
all right, I will give you some examples, who's on duty please clean it . 34916_38451
clean the blackboard please . 38451_42925
can you see the blackboard clearly ? 42925_52460
yes . 52460_53403
yes ? 53403_54146
just leave the word identity, okay ? 54146_75438
therefore, the difference between identity and equation, equation it may be only one solution, two solutions . 75438_97513
but for identity, you have infinite many solutions . 97513_101801
it will be always true, okay ? 101801_105560
for any value of x@l . 105560_107798
0 . 107798_145938
okay here, I have two other equations . 145938_152285
of course, now, they are equations only . 152285_154310
okay ? 154310_155621
we don't know how many solutions for each one . 155621_159548
therefore, they are still equations only . 159548_161621
I want to prove that, whether these equations are identities or not . 161621_167763
are they identities ? 167763_171451
or are they just equations ? 171451_174588
the main steps will be, we try to expand the left_hand side and right_hand side, and then compare the terms . 174588_185068
okay ? 185068_185816
if they are, okay, they are expanded form already . 185816_189995
no need to simplify it . 189995_192168
but if they are not, simplify it one by one . 192168_195370
and then compare the sides . 195370_198315
okay ? 198315_198738
you can start with the left_hand side or right_hand side . 198738_201721
no matter . 201721_202490
okay ? 202490_204690
it doesn't matter . 204690_205313
left_hand side +... 205313_206378
expand it . 206378_208951
it should be +... 208951_216321
five x@l . 216321_218111
five x@l . 218111_218626
minus fifteen . 218626_220936
minus fifteen . 220936_222993
minus three x@l . 222993_224006
minus three x@l and +... 224006_226421
plus three . 226421_227516
plus three . 227516_228495
therefore, how many x@l ? 228495_233423
two x@l . 233423_235335
two x@l only . 235335_235365
and the constant term ? 235365_237655
minus twelve . 237655_239501
minus twelve . 239501_240375
okay ? 240375_242686
expanded form . 242686_243768
simplify that expanded form . 243768_246135
and for the right_hand side, after expansion, it is two x@l . 246135_258095
two x@l . 258095_259901
minus twelve . 259901_260535
are they equal ? 260535_262108
yes . 262108_263301
all right ? 263301_269220
they are equal . 269220_270213
therefore, do you think that it is an identity ? 270213_274590
or an equation ? 274590_275716
identity . 275716_277906
identity . 277906_278391
therefore, you can write down the result like that . 278391_280676
five x@l minus three minus three x@l minus one . 280676_287403
two x@l minus six bracket . 287403_291373
with this symbol . 291373_295108
it's identical to the left uh, right_hand side . 295108_300435
okay ? 300435_301788
or you can write it as a written form . 301788_304635
it is an identity . 304635_307505
okay ? 307505_308475
but of course it is not so clear, to just write down it is . 308475_312385
therefore, I think this is better . 312385_314588
with the symbol, one, two, three, three lines . 314588_318835
okay, how about the second one ? 318835_321123
how about some helper ? 321123_333873
so Wing Chung . 333873_338386
you need to practice some more about your handwriting . 338386_343425
try to simplify the left_hand side and right_hand side . 343425_351065
how about the bracket ? 351065_361551
are you too nervous ? 361551_365245
yes . 365245_366485
he is very careful . 366485_384820
&=laughs . 384820_387236
very very careful . 387236_388508
&=laughs . 388508_389896
how about the right_hand side ? 389896_393513
is he correct for the left_hand side ? 393513_400241
yes . 400241_401218
yes . 401218_401730
okay, thank you . 401730_411368
firstly, is he correct for the simplification in the left_hand side and right_hand side ? 411368_421656
yes . 421656_422105
okay . 422105_422815
after simplification, you have two expanded forms, are they equal ? 422815_428833
no . 428833_431008
although it is the same five x@l, but one is positive, another is negative . 431008_436678
okay ? 436678_438136
even the ten is the same, it is not identically equal . 438136_444870
but of course now, it is not the same, negative ten, positive ten, okay ? 444870_448351
therefore, we can say that, the left_hand side is not equal to the right_hand side . 448351_455590
then can we say that it is an identity ? 455590_459710
no . 459710_460998
no . 460998_461605
then your answer, you may just write down . 461605_464045
or you complete this, okay ? 464045_466468
uh, write down the whole equation . 466468_469318
we have the conclusion, this equation is not an identity . 469318_482388
okay ? 482388_485173
if it is not identity, we can still call it an equation . 485173_489380
okay ? 489380_491435
it is only an equation, not an identity . 491435_494163
if it is an equation, it may be one solution only . 494163_499516
because it is one unknown, one equation . 499516_502810
therefore, you may find the solution for it . 502810_505025
just one . 505025_505708
but for identity, you have, in fact, infinite many solutions . 505708_511075
okay ? 511075_512868
it will be satisfied for all the values of x@l for identities . 512868_518426
understand ? 518426_520235
know the difference between identity and equation . 520235_524658
and for identity, in between the two sides, you can use a new symbol with three lines . 524658_532753
and we read it as, is identical to . 532753_537378
or you can say that they are identically equal . 537378_541328
okay ? 541328_543881
you have some class practices here . 543881_546983
page one four seven page one four seven . 546983_552616
seven equations are given to you . 552616_556970
okay ? 556970_558001
seven equations are given to you . 558001_559626
some of them are already in the expanded form . 559626_564498
but some are still in factorized form . 564498_567393
