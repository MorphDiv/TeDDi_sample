the one thing I wanted you to throw into the pot is that &-um you
the second thing point &-uh point is that &-uh one thing that
you know I mean what the hell . 66850_69090
I mean that's just unbelievable . 69630_71450
you know that they would suggest such a thing . 71490_72970
but that that shows you how death . 73010_74540
the point is . 74730_75060
I don't think they were suggesting I think he was saying . 75230_77010
that's what he would do if he were his lawyer . 77030_78420
<I know> I know . 78790_79450
but they're they're also covering up their own . 79470_82090
this is a rather slimy fellow . 82110_83290
well you gotta realize that this is the way they're indicating
their lawyer's concerned about . 90420_91410
mhm . 91910_92100
but &-uh I would not &-uh make decisions based simply on what
I mean it I mean obviously the the fact that that Hunt's
fine . 105640_105810
we understand that . 106040_106580
and I'd make it on that . 106830_107490
but &-uh some of the rest did Chuck bring over the transcript . 107570_112090
nope . 112540_112810
just a minute Chuck didn't have the transcript . 113970_115410
did he no . 115430_116130
and his partner said . 116450_117340
forget it . 117390_117780
yeah . 118620_118780
his partner said . 118910_119480
forget it . 119580_119890
you'll never get the transcript . 119910_121010
but they swear up one side and down the other and crosswise <that
but I'll tell you listening to the thing the other side . 127880_130410
I you're convinced of that you you heard the transcript didn't
yeah . 133260_133410
what do <you think> you think he's lying . 133940_135170
Chuck is lied . 135540_136090
I I find it very hard to believe that he's telling the truth .
mhm . 141000_141220
mhm and John does too . 141690_143050

I think so . 143870_144220
yes . 144370_144540
in fact John said that he believed that &-uh Mcgruder ready to
no question . 150370_150770
mhm question it isn't ready to crack . 151060_153010
he's obviously worked out with the lawyers the the plan for it
and he's trying to make the final decision as_to whether he goes in
he obviously has crossed the bridge that he's not gonna lie anymore
right right . 165800_166480
