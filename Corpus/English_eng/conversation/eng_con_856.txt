right people who irritate me +...
<is my family because> my brother and my dad (be)cause like
they always steal my amp and my leads and never put them back .
so I hafta go round collecting it .
and when my mum tidies my room , I always lose everything and get
so I never know where everything is .
but if it's messy , I know exactly where everything is .
yeah because you put it there .
but when mum tidies up , I just haven't got a clue .
so that's why it's annoying .
any anything else that perhaps your brother does ?
just himself .
things that are annoying ?
well not really he just steals things and gets on my nerves .
