what if the Titanic hadn't sunk ? 115_2415
that was my question . 3795_4775
so there wouldn't be a movie or a book about it . 5075_10815
it wouldn't be that important . 10975_12235
it wouldn't be an important event . 12235_13375
it would just be noticed that there was this very big ship that made it to New York . 13475_18055
I disagree with you because it was still a bit a part of history because the Titanic was very great . 19285_28885
and there's a lot of news about it . 29285_32025
and how they would say that it couldn't sink, also that it was a first class, it had been a ship that had carried, like it would, it had been a cargo ship . 32065_51505
it had to turn into a cruise ship, sort of, and it still was the biggest ship and amazing . 51725_64685
well, S_one . 65245_66185
I'm sorry . 66185_67545
go ahead .
so I understand what you're trying to say and what your point is, but you never, it's hard to tell, but the reason that I'm going to support S_five is that you basically, what happened was it sank and they said it was unsinkable, but lots of the reasons that we know about it now is because they said it was the unsinkable and it did sink, there was two little rafts . 69705_99685
they didn't fill every raft . 104045_105585
so I think it wouldn't be noticed as much, for starters . 105785_109265
I agree with you like that, but I also think it would have been famous just not as famous as it was because it sunk . 109765_117465
yeah . 118005_118165
because it wouldn't be as famous as it is now because now we kind of do, I don't think that most of us would know about the Titanic, because today I think there's bigger ships today . 118365_129745
not like this, the one thing they know about it for its size, because it was just a ship that's as big as . 130725_136285
and other ships have definitely sailed and they probably said some of them weren't going to be sunk, but they xxx and made it through, so, and we don't know about those ships much . 136325_154905
I'm not sure I know about any of those ships like that . 155165_158485
I get what you're saying and I get that you're trying to tell me that it wouldn't be as famous, and I agree with that . 160605_165705
but I also think that it would be in a museum, because it was the first big ship to ever be made . 166605_173305
and also there may be bigger ships today, but it was still famous because it was the first one . 174445_179765
how do you know it was the first one ? 180625_183625
I watched the movie and I've also read a chapter book about it . 185325_189545
so It said in the chapter book, not in this, but in the chapter book, that it was one of the first big ship to be made, because it was three football fields wide, but long . 189945_204565
I disagree because, the thing is that if it's unsinkable and it didn't sink, it's if it didn't sink and it was unsinkable, there's nothing really important about that . 205445_216905
and I think the ship would only be recognized in size . 217305_219425
so some ships on tours, like tour ship . 219705_223345
there's these papers that show have big it is . 223765_225705
and that'd probably be like a xxx the Titanic as how big it is compared to this ship . 226165_230145
but I don't think it'd be that important to any other . 230305_233145
yeah . 234355_234675
some, sorry, go ahead . 234975_237695
I also thought, I disagree with you S_five, again . 237975_242915
because I think it, you guys are saying that it's smaller than ships today, but I'm saying that it is the first one to ever be made . 243895_259555
so I think it would have been in a museum and also the unsinkable ship and it would have said that and it would have been there because ships could always sink . 260665_269365
I understand, I understand . 270925_272625
and S_three or S_two, do you have anything you want to say on this ? 273045_276825
I'm looking up information . 276925_278205
if the ship sunk in the day, do you think that would change how many people died ? 279645_286485
it said that, well, it didn't say it in here, but in class we said that a lot of dogs died and all that stuff, but do you think it would affect it if it was in the day and people could help them ? 287005_298465
it could . 298625_299225
but, go ahead . 299665_300365
I do think it would because they might've seen the iceberg since it was day . 300625_307465
yeah . 308385_310985
and because since the water, since the sun is reflecting off the water, it's easier . 314545_319885
it's going to be warmer, because the sun heats up the water . 320265_322845
but even though it is in a high up North, still, the sun is going to increase the temperature, maybe three to four degrees, which then brings it above freezing point . 323525_334365
and since it's day and not night, it would be warmer too . 334925_337405
the water there is so freezing . 337865_340925
I don't think it would help . 341225_341885
because they said they dropped died in a few minutes . 342325_344945
it was either . 345085_345265
there was one guy . 345625_346385
we were talking about only they would be able to see it . 346885_356305
also, I know, I agree with you guys that they would have seen it, but also what I'm about, I watched the show about it . 357145_365785
it was I just wanted to learn about it . 365965_369425
so I was watching a show about it and they said it wasn't that they couldn't see it . 369385_373785
it was because of the weather . 373905_375425
there was this fog that was laying over the ocean that day and night . 376305_378985
so I think it could have not stopped him, but it could have still sunk because of the fog, I just wanted to say to S_two, if when it's light out, then you could see it and like all that stuff and you wouldn't have to jump off the boat so that when it really pertained to it . 379145_405525
yeah .
so, I'm going to say the opposite to you . 406785_410825
so, I was trying to xxx . 411205_412845
so, what I was thinking was it might not effect yet, because xxx . 413105_420125
but, it says something and I tried to a museum and it had stuff from it and they told us all about it, and it had a ton of people on this wall who died when the Titanic crashed . 424685_438725
so I'm going to disagree with you on that part . 439425_444025
because even though, even if they could have seen it, because he said it was he who warned the bridge, iceberg right ahead . 444025_454085
so they could see the iceberg and so they barely fill, they didn't fill all the people in the boat . 454545_465825
it says here among the twenty-five people in a boat designed to carry more than forty-five people . 465325_473105
um, I- +... 473465_473505
but it was, they filled up the ships so little, and they were for a big amount that might not make a big difference . 474385_486845
also, I disagree with you because what you're saying is that they would have been able to see it fast enough, but I disagree with you because they would've been able to see it earlier than what you're saying . 488735_506255
because it was daytime now . 506575_507675
because they could have, like you said, they saw it, but that doesn't mean that they reacted quick enough because boats don't really turn that fast especially when they're big . 509025_518425
it's huge . 518905_520185
it's going to take a long time to turn . 520425_522025
they didn't fill the boats and they didn't put enough boats on . 522685_528325
when I was at the museum, this guy said that there were a ton of people and they knew, but they only put a few life boats on and they barely filled them . 528615_538615
S_one ?
I'm just saying we kind of off topic about like Kinsey and guys, I'm just saying that we had got off the question, but the question was about if it was in the day, would it affect it ? 543035_558115
yeah . 558295_558475
so I was saying that it would have affected it because they would've been able to see the iceberg sooner . 558875_567455
and so, since it was a huge ship, they probably, maybe like three miles before they probably would have been able to see it . 567625_578225
if it was in time . 579725_580425
I disagree because we did a study before we came here about the Titanic and there was a bunch of facts and the ship was going basically basically half its speed . 580785_591285
it was going full speed . 591985_593325
sorry, it was five below its maximum . 596815_600035
