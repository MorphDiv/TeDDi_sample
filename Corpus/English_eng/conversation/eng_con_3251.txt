are they equal ? 0_746
do it now . 746_2041
just mark it on your book . 2041_5738
and answer the question, whether they are equal or not, for the left_hand side and also the right_hand side . 5738_14690
it's better not to use a calculator, okay ? 14690_53633
but if you use it, just use it to check the answer . 53633_58206
it is simple calculation only . 58206_62023
errors ? 62023_87111
don't use this, this kind of ball pen, you can't see it clearly . 87111_112941
have all of you finished ? 112941_118858
okay, let's check the result . 118858_121538
page one four four . 121538_123755
the three values for x@l . 123755_126666
uh +... 126666_127876
okay, Mak Pui Ling . 127876_129789
you are nine . 129789_130523
tell me the result, when x@l equals zero, what will be the left_hand side and right_hand side ? 130523_136588
left_hand side ? 136588_137930
equals ten . 137930_139148
equals ten . 139148_139945
how about the right_hand side ? 139945_140921
equals ten . 140921_142010
then is the left_hand side equal to the right_hand side ? 142010_145510
yes . 145510_146160
yes . 146160_146666
okay ? 146666_147385
we have test the third value for x@l . 147385_150146
when x@l equals zero, it is still left_hand side equals right_hand side . 150146_155858
okay, how about the fourth trial, when x@l equals negative one . 155858_160056
Sung Wai Ling, okay . 160056_162821
left_hand side equals eight, right_hand side equals eight . 162821_168405
therefore, do you think that they are equal ? 168405_170501
yes . 170501_171110
yes . 171110_171798
when x@l equals negative one, both the left_hand side and right_hand side equal eight . 171798_177741
okay ? 177741_179045
therefore, it is still left_hand side equals right_hand side . 179045_182613
how about the fifth trial ? 182613_186013
this time, Lee Shan . 186013_188573
left_hand side equals nine, right_hand side equals nine . 188573_194243
okay . 194243_194795
therefore, equal . 194795_198290
this time, when x@l equals negative one over two . 198290_202010
both the left_hand side and right_hand side, the result is nine . 202010_205683
okay ? 205683_206628
therefore, we have the same result . 206628_208628
left_hand side equals right_hand side . 208628_211155
how many solutions now ? 211155_213793
five . 213793_216100
five . 216100_216683
okay ? 216683_217546
two on the blackboard with the three in the book, you have five results . 217546_221906
do you think it is only five ? 221906_225001
no . 225001_225896
no . 225896_226561
it has many many . 226561_229401
infinitely, many results . 229401_231753
why ? 231753_233185
okay, let's use another trial . 233185_235473
this time, this time, we just simplified these two parts . 235473_244978
okay . 244978_245983
left_hand side and right_hand side . 245983_251121
in the expressions, you have learned two forms . 251121_257769
the one, all the terms add or minus together . 257769_261831
it is called ? 261831_263718
it is called ? 263718_266040
how do we call them ? 266040_268670
add or minus together, it is called ? 268670_278391
expanded form . 278391_279143
expanded form, okay ? 279143_281200
expanded form . 281200_282150
you have other ways to express the terms, for example, like that . 282150_294260
this time, the terms are times together . 294260_299068
of course we will, we will not call them terms, we should call him call them ? 299068_304405
factors . 304405_306470
therefore, this is called ? 306470_307996
factorized form, okay ? 307996_312508
you may express different expressions in expanded form or factorized form . 312508_326365
now we try to change them, with the same kind of form . 326365_333878
which form, is more easy for you ? 333878_336763
expanded form or factorized form ? 336763_341428
factorized form . 341428_342745
some say expanded, some say factorized . 342745_345585
in fact, if you want to find expanded form, what are you doing ? 345585_350283
just multiplication . 350283_353410
okay ? 353410_354410
but if you want to find the factorized form, you need to find common factors, or maybe groupings, etcetera . 354410_363168
okay ? 363168_363593
therefore, usually, expanded form will be more common, more usual . 363593_369088
just use multiplication, expand it one by one . 369088_373433
okay ? 373433_374383
we'll try to change both sides, to be expanded form and compare . 374383_380463
left_hand side, is it expanded form ? 380463_383408
yes . 383408_384800
it is already expanded form . 384800_386263
two x@l plus ten . 386263_388631
the left_hand side, it is factorized form . 388631_393750
what will be the expanded form for the right_hand side ? 393750_401375
two x@l +... 401375_403093
it will be ? 403093_403488
two x@l . 403488_403981
two x@l . 403981_404941
plus ten . 404941_406070
plus ten . 406070_406855
constant terms, both are the same, ten . 406855_414535
x term, the same, two x@l . 414535_420013
therefore, will they be always the same ? 420013_423110
yes . 423110_424180
yes . 424180_425413
in fact, on both sides, the expressions are exactly the same . 425413_429941
or we say that they are identically the same . 429941_434588
therefore, no matter what's the value of x@l, it is you substitute for x@l, the changes will be the same . 434588_443243
therefore, you will get the same value . 443243_445813
okay ? 445813_447283
you cannot see it very easily because at first, they appear in different forms . 447283_456516
but if you change them to be the same, same form, then you can see that in fact, they are identically the same . 456516_464286
all right ? 464286_466111
therefore, not just one solution, you have many many solutions . 466111_471501
for this kind of solution, uh, that's this kind of equation, we will give them a name . 471501_479006
identity . 479006_487350
identity means that they are exactly the same . 487350_491301
okay ? 491301_492741
follow me . 492741_494283
identity . 494283_495301
identity . 495301_498083
identity . 498083_498813
identity . 498813_501156
okay ? 501156_501531
and therefore, for this kind of identity, we will give it a symbol, this time, not just two lines . 501531_512605
we use three lines as a symbol . 512605_518188
it means both sides are identically the same . 518188_523673
we say that, two x@l plus ten, is identically equal two bracket, two, uh x@l plus five . 523673_535058
okay ? 535058_536898
it's identically equal . 536898_540111
they are in fact, exactly the same . 540111_544850
okay ? 544850_547023
all right, then how to prove identity ? 547023_549375
do you think that we try all the values for x@l ? 549375_554726
first try, second try, third try, and then, oh, five trials . 554726_560568
then I can conclude they are identity . 560568_562635
no, because, that maybe the sixth trial . 562635_567591
