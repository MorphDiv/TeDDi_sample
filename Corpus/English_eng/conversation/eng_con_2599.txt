good afternoon . 2785_3565
good afternoon . 4305_5125
&-uh it's not always the case but today's music actually was related to the lecture the first song was called Do the Evolution and the second was Strong Enough to be My Man which will really be more as far as we're gonna get more like &-um Thursday's lecture but I hope to be able to find another content related theme music by Thursday too . 6345_25165
I actually have no announcements today although someone else has an announcement about recording the lecture . 26155_30515
before I do that do you have any questions ? 30995_32555
okay so here's an announcement about recording . 64345_64725
(0.4) &=micase_recording_announcement .
I always wanted to be part of a corpus . 148945_151345
&-um okay . 152945_153865
what we're gonna do in today's lecture is we're basically done with history we're done with methods and we're going on to biopsychology . 154645_162805
so we're gonna talk about biopsychology from a_couple_of different perspectives and before I talk about +//. 163025_169505
we're gonna talk about sorta biopsychology as it relates to sort_of our evolutionary heritage but we're also gonna talk about biopsychology as it relates to the immediate moment . 169605_179605
&-um &~i I've got names for those kind of causes here in a minute but &-uh before I do that I just wanna sorta make a plea . 180305_186705
one of the things that that I find sort_of frustrating or mystifying or I don't know exactly how to put it but at the end of the course lots_of times students come up to me and they say +"/. 186945_196645
+" you know that psychology stuff I really liked it but I didn't understand why there was all that biology in there . 196805_203225
+" I don't understand what the biology hasta do with the psychology . 203685_206585
and so I'm gonna make this point a_couple_of times in the biopsych lectures but I just wanna try to make it here one time &-uh with feelings which is that +//. 206825_216025
I_mean at some level the reason why I find it a frustrating thing is I sorta don't know how to respond to it . 217645_221705
because while biology is not what people often think of in psychology when they think about clinical psychology for example it is the case that every single thought emotion memory any psychological experience you've had conscious unconscious it doesn't matter what it is it has a biological component to it . 221685_248925
you do not think without biology . 250145_252665
you do not experience an emotion without changes in your biological makeup . 253485_258985
those things are mediated at some level by biology . 260205_263385
so it's sort_of like I mean in some ways it's sorta like I +//. 264185_267105
&~i &~i it would be sorta like saying you know I took a course on driving and I didn't understand they kept talking about the car all the time . 267345_273365
that didn't make any sense to me . 273885_275245
in some ways that's it I think sometimes it's hard to see as we get into how neurons act and what evolutionary theory says and what does it have to do with biology +//. 275665_283925
with psychology it's easy to lose the connection . 284225_286845
but the connection is the proposition is simply that our biology whether we're talking about our evolutionary heritage or whether we're talking about immediate changes in &-uh our biological makeup influence our behavior and psychological experience . 287625_303525
you cannot have a psychological experience without having the &~biol biological component going along with it . 304065_310025
again you know <at the> at the extreme no brain no central nervous system no thought no psychological experience nothing right ? 310345_317425
so what we're gonna do over the next couple weeks is try to look at different biological takes <on &-uh> on &-uh behavior . 317605_327905
and we're gonna begin by talking about evolution and behavior &-uh and that's what today's lecture is gonna be about entirely and much of Thursday will be about evolution and behavior too . 328385_340565
before +//. 342485_342545
in +//.
and in evolution and behavior essentially what we're asking is does our evolutionary heritage does the <generations and> generations and generations that we've been in an environment influence our &-uh our current behavior . 342905_359245
and one of the things I'm gonna try to do in the lecture is to try to mark out for you what is and isn't controversial among psychologists about the proposition that evolution shapes behavior . 360105_371825
so we're gonna spend much of today talking about Darwin and Darwin's Theory of Evolution so that &-uh &~w I make sure that we all sort_of understand what Darwin's Theory of Evolution was about and then try to apply it to human behavior . 372325_384405
parts of that account are extremely controversial in psychology and parts of it aren't . 385455_391295
and I'm gonna try to help you see which is and isn't controversial . 391575_395215
and &-uh and we'll see that as we go on . 396255_398155
the other thing to make as sort_of a a preamble to this also is is that evolutionary theory is really I mean we're gonna be there's sorta two things that I wanna talk about there're two questions as I talk about in evolutionary theory that I think you wanna think about as we go through the lecture . 402765_421705
the first is is it in fact possible to identify behavioral candidates for making an evolutionary account ? 423225_428865
can you find some behaviors that look like maybe evolution shaped them ? 429845_433245
do you have to make the argument that all behaviors are shaped by evolution ? 433745_437025
so the first most of what today is going to be about is can you find some behaviors that it looks like we can make an evolutionary argument about ? 437525_443625
what would you want to look for in a behavior that would be consistent with an evolutionary argument ? 443905_447965
the second thing is if you make an evolutionary argument or any biological argument how should you interpret the meaning of that ? 448805_458705
so evolution for example is really a theory about how environments shape behaviors over millennia . 459885_466405
so at some level you can talk about it as being a biological cause it's our genetics it's our evolutionary heritage . 467565_474445
it's also possible to talk about it as being an environmental cause one of the things that you're gonna see is evolution is very much a theory about the environment . 475125_483185
but &~i no matter what if you accept the biological explanation whether it's evolutionary or whether it has something to do with current brain structure and function how should you interpret it to say that some &~thi some behavior is caused by our biology ? 484085_495885
so for example if I made this argument that said that there's lots_of good evidence that says you know most of us like sweets most of us like fats now we don't like to say boy I love to eat a big tub of fat but we all like butter on our bread right ? 496515_509135
and the reason why we like butter on our bread is (be)cause it got high fat content . 509255_511915
one of the argument +//. 512515_513115
the reason why we like really good premium ice creams is because they have high fat content that's the main thing that separates a premium ice cream from your run of the mill ice cream . 513255_521155
so &-um you could make this evolutionary account that said gee maybe the reason why we like we tend to universally like sweets and fats is because of our evolutionary heritage . 521635_532995
maybe an +//. 533435_533875
a taste for those substances was adapted in our past . 534255_537835
maybe we've evolved a preference . 538095_539735
for sweet and fat . 540795_541755
now does that mean that when you're walking down the street and you walk by the donut place and you smell the cinnamon rolls wafting out which are high both in sugar and fat you say I gotta have one . 542505_553365
it's not my fault it's my evolutionary heritage I have no choice in this I'm a highly evolved human being and that's what I've evolved to do is gonna be eat the donut right ? 553985_563185
so we wanna sorta try to talk about what the &~me what it means to make a biological evolutionary argument . 563325_569505
now in talking about biological approaches to behavior I really do want to make a distinction and the lectures are organized around the basic distinction between two kinds of causes . 570065_579445
one kind of cause the cause that people typically think about when they're talking about biological causes is what we could call the proximal cause . 580385_589245
the proximal cause just means the close cause . 590925_594065
the immediate cause same +//. 594585_596245
it shares the same root as &~w words like approximate . 596665_599405
it's close nearby . 600145_601825
so in terms of biopsychology when you're looking at proximal causes you're looking at how current changes in physiology or structure change behavior . 602725_613445
how they're associated with it . 613725_615045
so if you wanna know what happens when people experience love at the neurochemical level you're looking for a proximal cause of behavior . 615345_623705
&-um and it is clearly the case that things like brain structure and neural functioning affect psychological experience . 624705_632865
if you're in an automobile accident and have damage to the frontal lobes it's absolutely gonna change your behavior . 633525_639705
if you have &-uh damage to the hypothalamus your ability to regulate hunger and thirst is gonna go out the door . 641105_648105
those brain structures neurotransmitters how neurons fire if you lose for example a neuron if you lose the myelin sheathing that &-uh insulates the neurons &~s insulates some of the neurons which is what happens in &~n multiple sclerosis you will absolutely see behavioral changes . 649655_666715
there is a dynamic relationship between the current biological state of the organism and its behavior . 668015_674535
and that's what most of biopsychology looks at . 674955_677035
but you can look at the biological influence on behavior in another way you can look for distal causes same root as the word distant far away causes . 678065_687425
so is there anything not in the immediate moment that shape +//. 688885_691625
about our immediate biology that shapes behavior but is there something about our biological heritage that shapes behavior ? 691865_698465
&-um is the &~be and one way to think about it is is the behavior of our ancestors currently +//. 699925_704985
or the behavioral choices that they made continued to influence our current behavioral choices . 705025_710305
&-uh <in a biopsych> in biopsychology if you're looking for distal causes you're essentially looking for evolutionary based explanations . 711005_718345
okay ? 719445_719885
and again that's what we're gonna try to do today is to look at evolutionary explanations of behavior . 720025_725805
&-uh as we look at them &-uh again keep in mind that what you wanna know +//. 727425_731605
what you wanna try to ask yourself are these two questions are there some kinds of behaviors that are maybe more amenable more obviously open to an evolutionary account than other behaviors . 731465_742525
and two even if you find an evolutionary explanation for a behavior what should you make of it ? 744025_750605
to what extent +//. 751325_751985
how +//.
what kind of explanation has that provided for the behavior that you observe ? 752465_756005
questions ? 756465_757645
xxx .
okay well what I want to do then is to start talking about evolutionary theory and then we're gonna move into psychology . 760305_766345
so if you wanna talk about evolutionary theory you have to start with Charles Darwin . 767285_770525
not because Darwin was the first evolutionary theorist . 772385_775865
he was not . 776225_777105
&-um there were lots_of evolutionary theorists clanking around at the time of Darwin . 777925_781645
what Darwin did was got it right &-um and I'll try to tell you where he differed from other other evolutionary theorists as we go along . 784465_791365
a few trivial sort_of facts about Darwin he was born in eighteen oh nine you don't really need to know that it's just a trivial fact he was born in eighteen oh nine in England &-um to a wealthy family &-uh his mother who died when he was eight was actually the daughter of the founder of Wedgewood China Company so just a little trivia . 792475_815815
&-um incredibly affluent family &-uh Darwin set off to college and &-uh wanted +//. 816295_822915
initially his plan was to become a a medical physician . 823775_826595
&-uh but he didn't stick with that very long . 828255_829795
it's not clear whether his decision not to go into medicine was because the lectures were just deadly dull &-uh and he just couldn't find any intellectual interest in it in the time or if it was really an aversion to seeing and performing surgeries surgeries at that time were done without anesthesia . 830185_846205
that's a pretty gruesome thing to be involved with &-um and so he bailed &-uh early on from his plan to be a physician . 846825_855225
he got his BA and &-uh set out on a journey &-uh his first job was an unpaid job . 856055_863235
he spent five years as a ship's naturalist on the HMS Beagle . 864215_868735
&-uh again it was an unpaid job what a ship's naturalist was +//. 870075_873475
did was &-uh on ships of the Crown on British ships the ship's naturalist would travel around and and their jobs were to &~ex to examine and write about the animals and plant life the flora and fauna that they encountered on the travel and the HMS Beagle was on a round the world journey <again it> it took five years . 873855_897435
and &-uh what Darwin did was he would go do +//. 898615_901375
collect samples he would write about his observations when Darwin came back after five years he basically never left England again . 901715_909955
in fact he basically never really left &-um &~d his immediate town he suffered for most of his life from sort_of a chronic illness probably contracted while he was travelling in the tropics on the HMS Beagle but he he didn't venture forward very much and he had this enormous impact and he never left England . 910495_928635
&-uh he did continue to collect data for the rest of his life but the way would collect data was &-uh he would write to colleagues scientists around the world and so for example when we get to the emotion part he'd ask them what do people look like when they express happiness in your culture ? 929055_944755
you know or here's a drawing show it to some people and tell me what they think this emotion is . 945515_950875
so he would do it all by correspondence . 951195_952855
&-uh he lived to be &-uh quite old for the day he lived I think until he was seventy two . 953535_957815
he died in eighteen eighty two and and he his &-uh another piece of trivia his &-uh grave is &-uh next to the grave of Sir Isaac Newton which in some ways is highly appropriate because now Isaac Newton's impact on physical science is of the same magnitude as Darwin +//. 958795_978235
I guess you'd normally say it the other way (be)cause people always assume Newton's the big guy . 978415_983515
Darwin's impact on biological sciences is easily as big as Newton's impact on the physical sciences . 981355_988815
&-um Darwin's theory of evolution <as we're gonna> &-um as we're gonna see <in a> in a minute &-uh really found +//. 989655_996775
forms the foundation of biological sciences today and &-uh one of the things that I just wanna say right off the bat is &-um &~bi evolution is one of those things that outside of scientific circles there's still lots_of discussion about whether evolution is true or not . 997295_1013715
now &~n I wanna tell you that within scientific circles which is not to say that it's not possible that scientists are wrong but within scientific circles Darwin's theory of evolution is not controversial . 1014335_1024475
there are controversies about specific parts of evolutionary theory but the idea that organisms evolve that they adapt to their environments and that it leads to some of these adaptations are passed on to future generations is not a +//. 1025085_1041465
is not controversial in science you can only find a handful of scientists in the world right now who would who &-uh &-uh who would disagree with that I think . 1041725_1050025
&-um &-uh so although evolution is controversial sometimes in our culture it's pretty much an assumed truth within within science . 1050655_1061155
and it's an assumed truth within psychology all +//. 1061555_1065375
what what +//. 1065735_1066155
where psychologists start to break down is in whether or not you can account for &-um not just physical changes evolving but whether or not you can see behavioral changes and I'll try to make that clear as we go along . 1066495_1078535
but his impact on the biological sciences was enormous . 1079385_1083245
&-uh and so let me tell you a little bit about the story of what happened so he's travelling around on the Beagle which is when &~hi the origins of his theory of evolution really started happening . 1084265_1092865
he spends five years travelling around and one of the things that he notices over and over again is that he sees variations of species in different environments . 1094085_1102585
in particular if you think about the &~gal if you go to the Galapagos Islands one of the things that he was struck by was that there were at least eighteen different versions of the same species of finch . 1103345_1115365
finch is a little bird right ? 1116465_1117525
and all of these different versions were clearly members of the same mainland's finch that he observed but as he travelled around the Galapagos he noticed that on different environments in different islands the finches were subtly different . 1117985_1133645
so for example on one island he would find that the finches look just like all the other finches except that their beak is really short and really thick really tough . 1135205_1144145
he'd go to another island and discover that the finches looked just alike except that their beaks are long fragile slender things . 1145145_1153085
and he notices that as he looks at their diets what they eat in the different &-uh environments he notices that on the island where the finches have the short tough beaks their diet consists primarily of hard nuts . 1153805_1169385
and on the &~r island where they have the long thin beaks their diet consists primarily of insects that bore into the bark of trees . 1171105_1179005
so what Darwin says is ah these organisms are adapting to their environments . 1180545_1186765
okay ? 1188145_1188165
they're changing anatomically in ways that fit the environment . 1188985_1194085
I mean think about it how nice it is if you're on an island where your main diet is gonna be these hard to crack nuts it's gonna be great to have a beak that's really tough . 1194385_1202725
on the other hand if you're on an island where your primary diet is gonna be these little insects that bore in isn't it great that you have this long thin beak &-um to &-uh get in to those insects . 1203765_1213885
so what he noticed was that organisms adapt to their environments . 1214605_1218545
and that's evolution . 1219085_1219885
Darwin's not the only one who notices that . 1220985_1223485
lots_of competing theorists are noticing the same thing that in +//. 1223985_1227725
that organisms seem to match with adapt to their environments . 1227985_1232365
what Darwin does that's different from the other theories of evolution is propose that the mechanism by which that adaptation occurs and the mechanism that he proposes is natural selection . 1233385_1244005
(0.5) now I wanna spend a little bit of time talking about natural selection because but &~f first I'll just read this definition which is &{l=READING any inherited characteristics that increase the likelihood of survival in reproduction are selected for &}l=READING if it helps you it's gonna be selected for &{l=READING and any that decrease the likelihood of survival are selected against . 1248905_1271085
&}l=READING now &-uh one of the things that's hard to get about natural selection is often people think about natural selection as being this sentient knowledgeable all knowing guided planful thing out there as though nature natural selection has a grand plan for each of us and it's gonna determine what things are good and what things are bad . 1273615_1296795
&-um in fact last night I was watching with Michael we were flipping through the Discovery Channel and they had a program on about these guys who were diving down to three hundred feet underneath the water trying to find a species of fish and they found this one incredibly ugly fish . 1297455_1311895
it was &-um it looked like a bowling ball only it was a really ugly bowling ball and it had lost its ability to swim . 1312575_1320435
what it did was walked across the bottom on its little fins so its fins were useless now it's just this big beachbally kind of thing . 1321825_1328565
useless for swimming but good for walking right ? 1329145_1331245
and the narrator on this made this statement which just almost sent me over the edge . 1332025_1337865
the narrator said evolution has taken care of two problems at once . 1338325_1342505
while taking away the ability to swim it has given the fish the ability to walk on the bottom as though evolution knew what the hell it was doing right &=laughs:multiple evolution doesn't know what it's doing . 1342965_1353925
that's not what evolution is about . 1354665_1356645
evolution is a probabilistic occurrence . 1356965_1360105
basically what evolution boils down to is it says that things that work are gonna be more common and things that don't work in a particular environment are gonna become less common . 1360985_1373025
if the environment changes evolution didn't know that right ? 1373925_1379265
so if the environment changes something that at one point worked really well doesn't work anymore if it doesn't work anymore it's gonna be selected against so there's always this temptation to think that evolution is moving us in a direction towards always higher performance that's not what evolution is doing at all . 1379575_1397075
evolution is a pressure to match your characteristics <with your> &~enviro with your environment and really not your characteristics your offspring's characteristics . 1397705_1407925
evolution is a theory about how environments shape organisms over time . 1408285_1415325
okay ?
<it's not> it's not a knowledge guided there's nothing sentient about it it just says if there's something that works in an environment that thing is gonna become more prolific and if something doesn't work in an environment that thing is gonna become less prolific . 1416425_1432965
again notice that although evolutionary theory is always thought of as a biological account in many ways you can argue that evolutionary theory is the ultimate environmental explanation of behavior (be)cause it says it's the environment that determines selection criteria that determines how things happen . 1433695_1449595
&-um so I think this is a kind of complicated &-uh &-uh statement it's it's a little easier to be breaking natural selection down into sort_of what are the assumptions that are embedded in here and look at &-uh a couple cases . 1450985_1462005
so there are really four assumptions that are in that definition of natural selection . 1463285_1467365
(0.9) the first is that &{l=READING <members of a> &~spec members of a species have characteristics that vary . 1475385_1481985
&}l=READING what do I mean by that ? 1482885_1483705
all that statement really means is members of a species are not identical to each_other there is some variation some of us are tall some of us are short . 1483805_1492545
some of us have brown eyes some of us have blue eyes some birds in the Galapagos have relatively tough beaks some have relatively fragile beaks right ? 1493675_1503655
there's just variation . 1504015_1505195
&-uh one of the concerns that people have right now about modern agricultural practices by the way is that what we've done in modern agricultural practices which work well in our industrialized environment right now +//. 1506155_1517155
but one of the things that we've done is we cut down the variability . 1517595_1520795
so for example there are very few species of corn . 1521265_1524725
<all those &~vra &~vra I_mean &~veri &~veri &~d varieties of corn> all of those varieties of corn are genetically pretty identical to each_other which makes them very vulnerable if the environment suddenly switches because there is no variability . 1525225_1537145
natural selection first you have to assume that there's variability in &-uh in the species . 1537645_1543285
the second thing is is that at least some of these characteristics are passed on genetically . 1544245_1548485
now Darwin didn't know about genetics what Darwin argued was that there hadta be some mechanism he didn't know what it was but that there hadta be some mechanism of passing on characteristics from one generation to another . 1549425_1562365
&-uh one of the ironies is that Mendel who was working around the same time <as &-uh> as &-uh Darwin &~a apparently sent Darwin a copy of his &-uh manuscript where he laid out the basics of genetics &-uh and in those days when you got a manuscript a book you still hadta cut the pages . 1562825_1580485
so people have found this book and +//. 1581145_1582725
Darwin's library is still preserved if you're if you you're a very special person you can go in and go in and sit in Darwin's chair and be in Darwin's library . 1582765_1591205
and people have done research in there and found the books that were on his library at the time of his death and there was a copy of Mendel's book which was &~onl which had only been opened to about the twenty fifth page and then Darwin got bored with it apparently and put it up . 1591705_1604405
so sort_of ironic that the mechanism that he needed for his theory really to sort_of flush it out was there he just didn't know about it didn't read it but &-um &~the you have to assume that characteristics hafta be passed on . 1604665_1616105
evolution happens across generations . 1617185_1619565
it does not happen in a lifetime . 1620765_1622345
it does not happen in two lifetimes . 1623185_1625325
it happens across many many many generations it is a relatively slow process +... 1625805_1630905
third some of those characteristics will aid survival and reproduction it's really what should go on it's really evolution is really about reproductive success so some of these things will aid survival so if you're a bird in the Galapagos Islands and you have developed with the tough beak relative to your neighbor fragile Fred right ? 1634295_1656615
then if your &~d if the diet on that island is in fact these tough nuts your strong beak's gonna be an advantage to you . 1657475_1664335
you're gonna have more access to food which means you're gonna be healthier which means you're gonna be more resistant to disease which means you're gonna be more fertile which means you're gonna have more offspring to the extent that your beak is passed on genetically . 1664815_1677255
your offspring are gonna have the same advantages that you had over your rivals at that time . 1677755_1683015
they're gonna have the same advantages . 1683375_1684835
so that over time over generations what you oughta see is the number of tough beaked birds goes up in this environment . 1685305_1693245
in contrast if you were in the environment where <it's the> &~thi it's the insects boring in if you have a thin delicate beak you're gonna have an advantage over the tough beaked ones who can't get to (th)em right can't get to the bugs . 1693645_1704405
so it basically says that some of these characteristics are gonna aid survival right and reproductive success . 1705605_1711465
okay ? 1712465_1712505
the last point is simply to say that it really hasta translate to reproductive success it's not just that it helps you &-uh &-uh do well but it helps it increases the chances of your offspring surviving and and your offspring in turn reproducing . 1712945_1738225
well the last assumption just says &{l=READING species produce more offspring than survive to be adults &}l=READING really that some organisms die before procreating themselves . 1733445_1742405
if every member of every species survives and reproduces at the same rate you will not have evolution you will not have natural selection (be)cause evolution natural selection really is about differential success in reproducing . 1743785_1758105
okay ? 1759145_1759365
with me ? 1760125_1760925
now there are a_couple_of things that I wanna point out about these &-uh &-uh about these assumptions . 1762825_1767925
and again it's this that sets Darwin off from other people . 1769485_1772505
why is evolutionary theory basically widely accepted in the biological sciences ? 1773925_1778285
and at least in most respects in psychology well lots_of reasons . 1778885_1783205
one reason why evolutionary theory in general is accepted is because &-uh we have &-uh a fossil record that shows a fairly steady progression of changes . 1783985_1795945
you can see where environments change and organism change organisms over generations change in response to that environment . 1796225_1802905
the fossil record provides pretty good continuous evidence of this progression from presumably single celled organisms &-um up through complex multicelled organisms by the way and up is even a bad word to use there I mean you could make the argument that the most successful evolutionary organism right now is a &~viru are viruses or bacteria I mean there are far more of them than there are of us . 1803385_1827425
there are more of them in this room than there are of us but we often talk about when we talk about up we're really talking about going up in complexity of the organism . 1827855_1836015
so as you move up in the complexity of the organisms up to humans you you see a fairly clear progression . 1836615_1841635
similarly a second reason if you look in different species you find similar anatomical structures serving very different functions . 1843495_1852835
so our hand and a bat's wing are anatomically very similar they serve very different functions but they look very similar suggesting that at some point way back in the evolutionary history we were +//. 1853785_1868045
we had a commonality . 1868425_1869505
right ?
but then the environment changes for bats they evolve certain things that that facilitate them flying we evolve things that &~in facilitate our grasping right ? 1871085_1879925
but it looks like there's some commonality across species commonality in structure . 1880785_1885085
the third and probably most compelling reason is because we can in fact see evolution in action . 1886425_1891205
how can we see evolution in action given that I told you that evolution is a very slow process ? 1892245_1896805
well it's a slow process generationally but if you find an organism that has a quick generational half life you can actually see things happening you can see evolution happen . 1897205_1907945
there are lots_of organisms that have very very quick generational lives insects tend to have quick &~genera you can run through a bunch of insects in two months bunch of generations bacteria even better you can run through generations of bacteria in twenty four hours and we see evolution in action . 1908265_1925425
one of the persistent problems today in medicine is the evolution of &-uh antibiotic resistant bacteria and it's a clear case of evolution . 1926075_1937675
so think about it . 1938915_1939895
you have bacteria that vary in some of their characteristics . 1940095_1943955
one of the characteristics that they vary in is how much &~peni let's just take penicillin as an example how much penicillin does it take to nuke the bacteria . 1944695_1952475
some bacteria if some members of this of the same strain of bacteria it turns out maybe go &=sound_effect with a little penicillin they fall over and kick their little legs so to speak and they're dead . 1953565_1962825
other bacteria you have to just bomb (th)em with lots_of penicillin before you're gonna nuke (th)em so they vary in their susceptibility to penicillin right ? 1963525_1973685
that's the first thing . 1973945_1974525
second those characteristics are passed on genetically and remember that bacteria just divide and then you've got two replicas of the original and so they're passed on genetically . 1974745_1984005
three some of those characteristics aid survival . 1985045_1987585
in a prepenicillin environment it doesn't matter but if suddenly you're in an environment where there's penicillin having a resistance to penicillin is gonna aid survival . 1988505_1996845
so when you start introducing penicillin that is a selection pressure you start putting penicillin in it suddenly makes disease resistance I mean penicillin resistance a survival characteristic . 1997785_2010685
notice again nobody thought this out nobody said gee we're gonna design a bacteria that's gonna be resistant to penicillin so that when penicillin comes along it's gonna be resistant to it . 2011465_2019485
it's just there's variation suddenly an environmental press comes on species produce more offspring than survive to &-uh reproduce themselves once you introduce penicillin into the environment most members of the species die off . 2019795_2033275
the only ones that don't die off are the ones that are highly resistant to penicillin . 2033995_2037455
they go on to reproduce and you have now a higher proportion just like with the birds in the Galapagos you now have a higher proportion of penicillin resistant bacteria . 2038075_2049375
so we believe it because we've seen it in action I mean you can see evolution happening . 2050515_2055135
I noticed that natural selection began at first with environmental change . 2055635_2059555
somebody asked me well are we +//. 2060195_2061195
&~a after the last class somebody asked me well are we affecting our evolution are we taking over for natural selection well &~w we are nature . 2061295_2069535
I mean we're all part of nature natural selection just says when the environment changes or the environment puts a press on it so if we introduce penicillin or another problem is pesticides we introduce pesticides into the environment some of the pests are gonna be resistant to those . 2069995_2086515
we are exerting selection pressure &-uh on the &~envir &~th through the environment on those organisms . 2086865_2093545
if you start using pesticides you can guarantee that you're gonna start seeing pesticide resistant insects . 2094245_2100065
if you use antibiotics you're gonna guarantee that you're gonna see antibiotic resistant strains of penicillin . 2100465_2105945
I think there's one version of staph infection right now that's in Japan where there is one known antibiotic that works and and sure as the sun rises that &~go the the bacteria will evolve a resistance to that version of penicillin too . 2106045_2121165
so it's a constant race of whether you can come up with a new sort_of version of penicillin or antibiotics . 2121325_2127545
okay ? 2127985_2128205
now psychologists don't question psychologists are happy with this psychologists think when it comes to okay so what about evolution in psychology ? 2128625_2136425
well psychologists are also very comfortable with the notion that brain physiology physical anatomy has evolved over time . 2136885_2144105
and the argument if you were gonna make an evolutionary argument about this goes basically +//. 2144945_2148185
well if you look across species what you see is sorta this progression toward complexity that there's something about centrally organizing information processing which is what the nervous system is really about . 2148285_2160665
it's about processing information taking input from the world doing something with it and putting out a behavior right ? 2160905_2168285
that if you look at what happens to sort_of that central processor in your lowly striped bass you got a bunch of &~ner nerves together that just sorta +//. 2168785_2175585
we call (th)em ganglions just sort of very primitive &-um &-uh meaning simplistic &-uh information processing controls things like breathing and reflexes and stuff like that not a_lot_of higher order computational power in your basic striped bass &-um nor a_lot_of sensory processing processing and stuff it's a fairly simple sensory world if you're a striped bass . 2176325_2197345
as you go up across species again up in terms of complexity as you go up you see sort_of regular organization so this part of our brain the hindbrain we'll talk about that when we get to brain physiology but the hindbrain and the bass are really pretty similar and they control similar functions it's breathing and all those kinds of basic survivals . 2197825_2217105
when you get up a little bit more complex more sensory &-uh processing is involved you get the evolution of things called a midbrain just a little bit of bulging around what was just the ganglion well in humans that part is right here . 2217355_2229755
it's called the midbrain it's the second structure to evolve sort_of evolutionarily and it processes sensory information . 2230115_2236475
and then as you get up in cats and primates and humans what you get is the forebrain this last part which is &-um where the cortex is where most of what we think of thought and if consciousness resides anywhere and it most surely does it resides somewhere in the cortex language resides there all kinds of higher functioning more complicated functioning reside there . 2237065_2256985
so psychology'd be perfectly happy saying well what you get is this evolution of physiology . 2257885_2262665
there was something about information processing that's adaptive that aids in the survival and reproduction of the species and so that's what's happened we've filled the niche right &-um by going down this trail . 2263255_2275755
where psychologists start to depart is when you start talking about evolutionary influences on current behavior . 2276675_2283735
so we're not looking about the structure of the species we wanna know can I explain something in the moment ? 2284535_2290135
so can I explain for example the fact that if I go &=smiles how's everybody doing ? 2290875_2296095
you all assume I'm more likely happy than unhappy . 2296495_2300035
or if I went &=scowls so what do you wanna know ? 2300655_2302735
&=laughs:multiple you're gonna be more likely to assume that I'm angry than not angry and in fact I need to cut the language out I don't say so what do you know I just go &=angry_facial_expression you're not gonna say boy he's a happy camper . 2303055_2315335
right ? 2315795_2315955
you're unlikely to do that . 2316195_2317255
can we explain that behavior evolutionarily . 2317865_2321325
notice now we're not talking about physiology so much as we're talkin(g) about a behavior in the moment . 2322105_2327585
and notice that unlike physiology there's no fossil record you can appeal to you can't say gee four million years well that's a &~t four hundred thousand years ago how did people signal happiness ? 2328245_2342765
there's no record . 2344025_2344785
you can't tell . 2345505_2346405
so evolutionary theorists who are trying to explain current behaviors are always in the position of having to look at something that they see now and see if they can tell a story an evolutionary account and then the trick that separates evolutionary psychology from other approaches that have been taken to this is can you make a novel prediction ? 2346965_2368725
can you go out and test it find evidence now so again what separates from just an as so story is can you &~s tell your story your theory and then say and if this is true I oughta be able to see why and then go out and see if you see why . 2369385_2384105
so the first candidate for that kind of behavior is gonna be emotions . 2384845_2389145
can you explain can you offer an evolutionary account for emotions ? 2390085_2393265
now the first person to make the argument that maybe our emotions evolved again notice it's a different game here . 2394545_2405625
we're talking about explaining behavior not physiology now . 2406405_2410385
can we understand emotional expression things like smiling crying disgust anger can we explain that by appealing to our evolutionary heritage ? 2411725_2422445
the first person to make that argument was Charles Darwin . 2422825_2425325
not surprisingly . 2426485_2427365
&-uh Darwin in eighteen seventy two believed that facial expressions &-um did in fact evolve I'll give you his language and then try to explain what it is . 2428625_2437665
he believed that they evolved from quote serviceable associated habits of behaviors what the hell is that right ? 2438305_2445685
so here's what a serviceable associated habit is what Darwin argued was well lots_of behaviors have lots_of things that sort of consistently go along with them . 2446465_2455185
so for example if I'm gonna attack this +//. 2455645_2457425
I won't but if I were gonna attack this person right here right ? 2457705_2460665
any way you look at it if I'm gonna attack you I gotta +//. 2461365_2465765
I'm gonna go something like this why am I gonna go something like this &=angry_facial_expression well I need to be in a position where I can lunge forward remember we're a preverbal society I need some way that I can lunge forward and I'm gonna be tense (be)cause my emotions +//. 2466025_2480805
I mean my +//. 2481085_2481445
I want to be ready right ? 2481725_2483665
I need to be able to punch I'm a whole lot easier &~i to punch if I'm like this &=angry_facial_expression than if I'm like this . 2484005_2490165
&=relaxed_facial_expression right ? 2491185_2491245
so what Darwin argues is well maybe this behavior that really has nothing to do with the attack it's the preparation for the attack but it has nothing to do with the attack directly maybe this behavior is the serviceable associated habit meaning maybe organisms that were able to pick up on the intent from just the expression would have some advantage . 2491985_2515105
I mean if I go like this &=angry_facial_expression he can either decide to prepare himself and fight back or he can decide to run either way he's at a better advantage than if he's standing there clueless while I'm getting over here ready to attack him right ? 2515685_2530105
so what Darwin argues is that essentially maybe emotional expressions evolved as a mechanism of communication . 2530305_2538145
it's an extremely profound point &=laughs:S1 I argue (be)cause you're in a preverbal society and what emotions allow you to do is to make internal intentions public . 2539535_2549715
it allows you to say I'm gonna beat you up but you don't have a language that says I'm gonna like beat you up . 2551115_2556555
or oh I sure am happy you're here friend when you can't say gee I'm so happy you're here friend . 2557215_2563815
it allows you to communicate internal hidden states to make them visible . 2564345_2567985
and Darwin's argument was that organisms that that picked up on that that detected that would have a survival advantage a reproduction advantage . 2568445_2577205
that if you're the type of person +//. 2577825_2579305
there's variability sensitivity of these expressions . 2579985_2582985
if you're the type of person who displays and decodes the expressions you're gonna be more likely to survive in the wilderness in the desert okay ? 2583645_2591645
now consistent with that argument are just a few things first is that if you look at the facial neuromuscular mechanisms fun to say that three times they show continuity from higher primates to man . 2592205_2606365
all that means is that again just like you wanna see continuity <in the> in the &-uh the &~b evolution of the brain you'd like to see continuity <in the> &~f in the physiology that would support emotional expressions you wouldn't want to find that only humans are able to go rrrr@o . 2607045_2622565
&=threatening_facial_expression if we're the only species that can go rrrr@o &=threatening_facial_expression then &~the it's hard to imagine that evolution coulda done that (be)cause it shoulda happened over time and shaping it . 2623145_2632765
the second thing is that facial expressions in humans really do carry close similarity to animal responses that have presumably again originally serves some function relating to defense . 2634645_2644765
again if &-uh if you're watching in a horror movie and you are genuinely frightened in the middle of a horror movie you're not likely to go wow &=surprised_and_pleased_facial_expression right ? 2645325_2653725
you just you don't do that approach thing right ? 2653865_2656205
when you're frightened you go aaahh@i &=surprised_and_scared_facial_expression &=laughs:multiple like that right ? 2656345_2659545
just like a horse shying away . 2659685_2661445
again when you're angry you don't very often see people who are really really ticked off go except Clint Eastwood +"/. 2661915_2669075
&=nonchalant_facial_expression go ahead make my day . 2669675_2671015
you_know it just doesn't happen . 2671295_2672295
when you're angry you're in someone's face you're just like this little critter right here &=points_to_powerpoint_slide right ? 2672515_2677015
so it looks like there's a +//. 2677155_2681435
and then my favorite is that some emotional expressions seem to resemble reflex and reactions to nonsocial stimulus so take something stinky and put it in front of a person and they'll go ugh . 2679105_2692285
&=disgusted_facial_expression just like this just that's disgusting right ? 2693685_2696465
so try turning in a paper that you started writing at three AM and finished at four AM to your GSIs . 2696725_2703405
ask them to read it and watch them while they read it . 2703765_2705525
and you'll see the exact same facial expression of disgust at this stinky piece of work &-um the same way you know when you &~se don't like something . 2705745_2714205
I_mean think about it when you don't like something the expressions that you make are really +"/. 2714425_2718405
+" &=disgusted_facial_expression oh that's terrible . 2718965_2720185
how could he do that ? 2720565_2721445
how could he say that right ? 2721585_2723065
so again it seems to be related . 2723265_2725205
now so far we got an as if story . 2725645_2728205
seems like there's this communication . 2729345_2731805
what's the evidence for it ? 2732385_2733705
well now we need a new hypothesis . 2734195_2735995
the new hypothesis is that these emotional expressions oughta hold true crossculturally . 2736375_2742995
people from different cultures oughta be able to identify similar emotional expressions and in fact Eckman does that . 2744015_2750835
Eckman goes out and finds the last civilization where television hasn't been introduced yet and shows them pictures of people doing different displays of emotion . 2752525_2763645
and asks them in their own language to describe it and when people see this &=points_to_powerpoint_slide they basically say oh that's disgust . 2764725_2771965
and when they say this &=points_to_powerpoint_slide they say that's +/. 2772825_2776205
sadness .
+, sadness . 2776805_2778525
when they see this fear . 2777675_2781395
right ?
when they see this &=points_to_powerpoint_slide happiness . 2782995_2786395
did I get those right ? 2787515_2788215
oop I got surprise and fear wrong ugh . 2789155_2791455
good thing I wasn't on the subjects list . 2792195_2793455
so &-um surprise and fear . 2793675_2795355
it turns out that if you go crosscultural you do this study over and over again not only are people who've never seen TV when shown these photos identify them correctly but crossculturally you find incredibly high levels of agreement about these six emotional expressions joy disgust surprise sadness anger fear . 2795455_2816815
there's some evidence that contempt may also be a relatively universal emotional expression . 2817215_2822015
so the argument goes there's evidence that these expressions there have been some evolutionary advantage to being able to detect them if they're universal but other emotional expressions vary widely by culture . 2822625_2835145
we'll pick up there on Thursday . 2835965_2838105
thanks a_lot . 2838405_2838665
