okay today's icebreaker is and yes I will give another one when it comes around to me again I have lots . 1105_6105
my name is blank &=laughs one crazy weird defining fact about me is blank I would like it to hopefully be something that's not true to anyone else in the room . 6745_15125
does anyone else here +/. 15285_15925
+, ⌊ have ⌋ &~s at least seventy three first cousins ? 16385_17725
⌈ I don't think ⌉ . 18425_18885
⌊ I think think xxx ⌋ I have seventy three siblings . 19105_20785
exactly .
well then I'll come up with +/. 21485_22365
⌈ wow ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ another ⌋ one . 22605_22805
but that's my example . 23045_23845
at the last count which is about three years ago I had seventy three first cousins they breed like ⌈ rabbits ⌉ +/. 24095_28755
+, ⌊ wow ⌋ +/.
+, so who knows how many I have now . 29175_31175
and only one that I know of has died . 31475_32795
so I know I have at least three new ones but I don't know most of them so I don't know what kids they have &=laughs:S4 so there we go . 33295_41355
today's this week's group building goal can't really apply in group and that is I would like when you guys pass each_other outside of group for you to feel comfortable saying hello to one another and addressing each_other by name if appropriate . 41985_54885
and if you do have the opportunity to have such an occasion in which you can do that I would like to hear about it just for the uplifting <so that> I can say <nah nah> nah nah boo boo to the powers that be . 56445_65545
saying that we don't provide a well developed atmosphere bah humbug . 66775_71275
so alrighty then okay we're also starting something a little new this week . 71755_77175
&-um it occurred to me yesterday like no one had anything they really wanted to talk about we did concepts for a little while and then they were like well we'll let's just work on the the things . 77695_86155
and it really didn't seem to me to be a good use of time to just sit down and look at the course pack and work on it . 86415_91255
&-um (be)cause that's something you guys can do on your own +/. 91375_94155
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and ⌋ if you need to work with other people it's something that hopefully you guys can contact each_other you can use our group email list &-um and you guys can do that on your own too . 94335_102095
I think it would be a better use of our group time while you have this many minds in one spot to work on concepts . 102875_108155
+, okay +/.
+, but I understand that the problems are good examples of concepts so I would like to try to split it down the middle +/. 108795_113395
+, mhm +/.
+, and spend about half the time working on like concepts kind_of try to hash things out like when we +//. 114075_119615
I don't know if like the tables and charts and that kind of thing are helpful to you guys or like the day +//. 119755_124295
I don't know who was here the that day we divided up different kinds of reactions and had people teach them . 124515_129115
+, I liked that . 129455_130555
+, but that kind of thing just a hearing it one more time is never bad . 130555_134355
so that's that's the only thing and &-um I have gotten some feedback from a_couple_of people over email and I really like that this is you guys's group not mine . 135695_144395
&-um I like knowing what you like and don't like and what you'd like to change so if anyone has comments please feel free to send them to me I won't ever like be like oh well you know +... 144855_154595

like Greek or like mm manageable or yeeks@n need some help ? 428065_431805

if it's a xxx molecule let's say SN two then &-um <there's an R to the S> and vice versa ? 910955_925255

but .
our GSI said that if you like if there's always going to be an inversion no matter what however whether or not it switches from R to S she said usually does but you got to check it just to be sure . 958905_970985
mhm ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/. 971185_971685

how can there be an inversion if it's going from a single bond to a double bond ? 985295_988335
hm .
hm .
there is like unnecessary xxx <sections in the> the &-uh stereochemistry eliminations . 991355_1004235

is that like whether you <can net E or Z> ? 1040485_1041445

yeah +/. 1051785_1052525
+, so I don't . 1053925_1054045
so it really can't have inversion can it ? 1054285_1056445
&=laughs .
it's not called inversion . 1056925_1059025

what do you mean higher ? 1098285_1098865
&-um like there's an example in the book . 1099365_1101245
like &~s for example it that one that's got more carbons attached it is higher priority than this one . 1102485_1107905

yeah . 1127015_1127095
so we can't really call it inversion then . 1128355_1130855

oh . 1598805_1600265

okay then . 1603085_1603925
so we were talking about antielimination right ? 1604425_1607145
before I so rudely distracted you . 1608405_1610245
what about antielimination ? 1614435_1615775
Liam ?
+, it's it's the best because &-um you know is it the easiest to attack or something ? 1616695_1627855
Rashmi ?
no +/.
+, wait what's attacking what ? 1628475_1632895
&-um a Bronson base is attacking the hydrogen . 1634075_1637595
the beta hydrogen . 1638495_1639035
so does it take off the beta hydrogen and then that causes the whole thing ? 1639105_1642765
&-um it takes off the beta hydrogen at the same time that the leaving group is leaving right ? 1644265_1650565
yeah .
so it's like a big old simultaneous +/. 1651545_1653645

and if you need another marker just tell me and I'll go steal one . 1671925_1682065
&=laughs .
<I'm okay> (0.11) .
okay so why did it why do we have the reaction between the carbons that we do instead of between a carbon with the bromine and the CH three that's pointing out to us ? 1692075_1702955
(0.6) .
you mean why is that hydrogen removed is that what you're asking ? 1703635_1711155
well you're saying that the reaction's gonna happen between those two horizontal carbons right ? 1711455_1715495
right . 1715635_1715855
and not the two that look vertical in our two dimensional picture ? 1716715_1719975
why ? 1720975_1721235
why not between the carbon with the bromine and the CH three . 1721875_1725855
no idea .
xxx &-um that's a good question . 1728395_1732315
because it because it's easiest to attack on the other carbon because of the area that the molecules take up . 1734035_1744055
that's good . 1746375_1746675
mhm +/.
+, explain to them why you think that would be . 1747265_1749085
yeah .
&-um what was it ? 1749965_1752985
chapter four when they were talking about when a carbon is attacked when like there's a certain amount of area (be)cause it's tertiary and it comes to attack like this &=gestures_with_hands and like it can't get in because it gets blocked out +/. 1753105_1764905
oh +/.
+, so maybe between the C that's coming towards us and the carbon that is attached to the bromine there's too much of that tertiary area that's taken up as opposed to the opposite side . 1765935_1776355
so that's where it would attack . 1776835_1777615
(0.4) .
so <that brings up> some kind of rule about substitution on carbons . 1779415_1785035
it's gonna happen with the more highly substituted carbon . 1785735_1789295
mhm .

E .
but it has something . 2154945_2157185

yeah &-um &=laughs <that was> that was my point &-um . 2165825_2168825
what was your point ? 2168825_2177485
well &=pause_while_s2_walks_to_board the way I look at it is you're gonna have a double bond between here and ignore the hydrogen beta hydrogen &-uh bromine . 2171795_2183615
and so you're gonna have a CH three going out and a hydrogen coming in and vice versa here so it's gonna look something like this . 2184215_2190715
&=pause_while_writing and the ones in the front correspond to the wedges and the ones in the back correspond to the dots . 2213665_2217865
so that's why I was saying well it'd be E because these are ⌈ they're on <opposite sides> ⌉ . 2218005_2223025

alright . 2283625_2283745
let's just say this is a single bond and this is rotating . 2284225_2286065
technically this can come down here so you have these two on the same tide side and this is gonna cohere so then . 2287045_2292165

oh that's a good question . 2332525_2333405

the hydrogen in the leaving group or the beta hydrogen . 2339305_2341625

mhm .
right .
right . 2351205_2351525

&-uh one . 2358005_2358445

we have one option right ? 2360705_2361505
right . 2361705_2361885
if it is rotating how many options do we have ? 2362085_2363805

where's the other option ? 2364045_2365765
the other ⌈ hydrogen ⌉ +/.

it could those three could rotate on the C and you could have the CH three <and the H> and the H kind of switch places the three of them . 2369785_2378865

yeah .
I know the base attacks the beta hydrogen and then what happens to the BR it just falls off ? 2432815_2438675
is that <it's just> it's just the leaving group that just leaves ? 2439375_2441735
yeah .
(be)cause it's simultaneous . 2442715_2443535
so where does the double bond +//. 2444095_2449915

have we done that in lecture ? 2471015_2474095

&-um &~w today when we were talking about the same kind of molecule and they were trying to talk about what H &~wh ⌈ what was gonna be protonated ⌉ . 2474155_2484295

+, geometry which is just like the anti form of the other side which is a easy way to figure out which one's gonna get protonated .
wait why are we protonating things ? 2493875_2495315
well I mean &~w which hydrogens are gonna leave and so &=s6_walks_to_board +/. 2495455_2498535
oh so deprotonated +/. 2498895_2499355

would be the ones that are gonna be leaving . 2514615_2517255

that's what that's my hypothesis . 2549145_2550685
okay +/.
+, can anyone explain why that might be ? 2551725_2553865
yeah because I don't know I I think it has something to do with you want it to be in or it's gonna be in its most stable form like if you &~d looked at the Numer projection so its most stable form is gonna be anti and so I think you'd look at whether it's E or Z in its anti formation . 2556875_2577455
is that . 2578055_2578135
so like is it more stable if it's anti and the CH threes are on the same side ? 2578835_2584675

right now . 2593265_2593885

I think it's just because &-um they &~l they want to stay at like when they're &-um the hydrogen's being attacked and the bromine is leaving at the same time and they don't want that to happen on the same sides . 2628955_2642815

⌈ could be ⌉ either inversion or retention . 3749285_3751725

⌈ so we're ended with a racemic ⌉ mixture . 3762565_3764605
that sounds like one of those key phrases we should probably put down on a chart . 3764845_3768005
but &-um &=laughs:S1 I just &-uh I have a hard time seeing that because it's like fifty percent of the time it's just I mean it's just that you go with you know the odds you think fifty percent of the time it's gonna come up one way okay . 3768185_3779765
<this is> this is one of those statistics things that if you do it enough it will end up with the right proportion . 3780285_3784245
basically there's no good reason for it to either come at my stomach or my back . 3785785_3789165
like there's nothing making it want to do one or the other . 3789765_3791965
so you assume that if you have enough molecules and you repeat this enough times half the time it'll hit me in the stomach and half the time it'll hit me in the back . 3793225_3799665
does that make sense ? 3801345_3801865
yeah (0.8) okay so what else do we want to try here ? 3801965_3811485
we can do the order of reactivity . 3814185_3816365
tertiary secondary .
oh yeah that's good . 3817345_3819725

&-um half of (th)em will end up in inversion half of it'll be retention . 3834095_3837235
xxx racemic .
that's why it's racemic . 3837935_3839555

right +/. 3845395_3845715

⌊ yeah ⌋ .
⌈ no ⌉ but so let's &~a sometimes these things sorta have foresight . 4087375_4091235
so let's say that you have &~s you're starting all the way on the left and you have that chirocarbon with the leaving group right ? 4091495_4100015
and so it's sitting there and it says I have a couple choices if I wanna do substitution I can either do SN one or SN two right ? 4100905_4108865
and it says well I know that I'm in a polar solvent and I know that if I end up with a carbocation I'll be okay (be)cause it'll get kinda balanced out . 4109225_4122025
am I more likely to go the SN one route or the SN two route ? 4122885_4125765
the SN one . 4126845_4127685

so I'm more likely to form a carbocation if I know it's gonna be stabilized . 4129625_4134045
if I'm in a nonpolar &-um solution and I know I can either do SN one or SN two but my charge is gonna be all mine to carry it won't be stabilized at all am I gonna head more to SN one or SN two ? 4134825_4151865

this one I think there's some debate on actually &~be before the last test if this is a racemic mixture then you have to assume that &-um let me think about this for a second . 4635235_4650655
that's a &~chir that will be a chiral molecule because but there's just an orbital there does it matter when you have the &~wh when you have the cation ? 4651895_4661575

is that what you're asking ? 4666435_4667115

and so if I have on great big bulky clothes and my Hammer pants and a great big fluffy jacket is it gonna be even easier for it or even harder ? 5688595_5694875
harder . 5695775_5696875

the nucleophile can fit right there +/. 5775205_5776985

+, and so if I have on the Hammer pants and the big poofy round inflatable jacket am I gonna favor SN one or SN two ? 5780025_5786785
