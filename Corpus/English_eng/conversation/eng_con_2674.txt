computer to work . 2585_3385
&-um first we'd like to start with a little activity a little class participation &-um what I want you to do is to build since our directions aren't on the computer I'll read them to you . 4145_16525
&-um take your pixie sticks and your marshmallows to create the best structure possible . 17445_24545
use your imagination and be creative . 25065_26825
do not trade your supplies . 27445_29185
&=laughs:multiple and that's all the instructions we can give you . 30145_34085

thirty seconds guys xxx . 160405_160425
okay okay +... 160425_164345
now since none of you guys &-um realized the fact that you could defy us and collaborate (be)cause collaborating is ⌈ not trading ⌉ . 165565_175745
⌊ no but she's ⌋ selfish .
&=laughs ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ no no no ⌋ .
⌈ no Andrea said that wasn't the topic ⌉ for two more weeks xxx &=laughs:multiple . 176785_179665
I'm out_of a job now .
you have thirty &~s thirty seconds to see what you can do collaborating with your ⌊ xxx ⌋ . 180625_187765
⌈ I like mine ⌉ though . 234725_235785
really quick xxx .
okay okay .
⌊ we can stop ⌋ .
⌈ we not done yet ⌉ .
⌊ unhunh unhunh hold on ⌋ one more second &=laughs:multiple . 235785_237665
nah time's up . 239505_239825
so .
&=laughs:multiple .
<it's sad> .
<we will defy you> .
okay what what did you guys notice from doing this little activity ? 246875_250675
we didn't all have the same amount of ⌈ materials ⌉ . 250935_252995
⌊ we didn't xxx ⌋ .
⌈ I have lots_o(f) legs ⌉ &=laughs:S4 . 252995_253635
you didn't have the same amount of material you had lots_of legs . 253835_256655
we had no time . 256835_257475
you had no time . 257715_258695
some people had all Pixie Sticks and no marshmallows . 259415_261975
some people didn't wanna share their resources . 263195_266615
&=laughs:multiple .
&-um . 268455_268715
some people didn't xxx &=laughs . 268835_274595
what this was meant to represent was &-um with the more resources that you have the stronger your collaborations can be and the stronger your structures can be . 270275_280755
&-um pooling with others &~t who share similar resources which you all had pixie &~sh sticks and marshmallows can lead &=laughs:multiple to better structures or in this example to better lives . 281395_293455
(0.8) .
okay . 300795_300995
you guys can eat your food now . 301215_302755
so xxx . 303455_303635
we don't have power in the computer right so we don't have our audiovisual presentations for yalls but you'll just hafta hafta go with it . 304615_312495
&-um so the with the example of resources and structure that you're supposed to be using what you have to build your life and that sometimes you know you don't have appropriate materials or you don't have a means of interacting with other people who can help you build that structure for yourself . 312955_328515
so we started at a really &-um national level about students in the United States (be)cause our topic is about women in multiple roles &~ma mostly students who are parents . 328905_339485
and so in the United States thirty two percent of undergrads enrolled across the nation label themselves as independent with dependents so that's not even counting graduate students that's undergrads alone . 340505_350185
twenty six percent of those students are considered low income and fifty nine percent of those are &~undergr are +//. 350625_355545
of the undergrads are single parents . 355665_357405
wow +/.
+, and then amongst women students in Michigan we're ranked thirty sixth nationally out_of fifty one including Washington DC in terms of women who complete college . 359165_366785
fifty &~perc fifty six percent of the students in Michigan are women which is a pretty good percentage but about twenty percent of those don't get to their graduation date . 367845_375485
&-um and just enacted recently I guess I don't know where this information came from but the +//. 375845_382825
that you can't be with the new welfare to work rules Governor Engler helped pass through you can't be in school and on welfare simultaneously without really severe restrictions on how many hours and how many credits and how much work you're doing at the same time so that it's very restrictive for people trying to get ahead . 382745_400625
and then how we identified our population of interest &-um with our theory about multiple roles the number of women in the Ann Arbor University of Michigan has escalated since nineteen fifty there was only about twenty six percent of the population and then now the nineteen ninety nine numbers was forty seven percent of the population were women &~incl &~cross across graduate and undergraduate degrees . 402175_423975
and &-um it's +//. 425175_427015
a report from Lapore in nineteen ninety five said that data suggest that chronic stressors may increase psychological vulnerability to acute stressors by stripping people of their biological psychological and social coping resources so that with the introduction of multiple roles into women's lives they're &~fa they're being faced with a multidimensional coping strategy that that they might not have had access to or been taught how to cope with all the different levels that they're now being faced with . 427505_455165
okay .
&-um surprisingly with all of these figures &-um there are &~r there's really not a &~no a network of support at the University of Michigan . 457325_466645
&-um there are programs that target graduate students but really nothing exists with the exception of a lesbian moms network &-um for undergraduates at all . 467385_476545
so understanding the environment is pretty critical to &-um do we have it now ? 477125_482645
just about . 482925_483345
okay . 483505_483645
understanding the environment is very critical to our &-um our needs assessment of the community and as Izumi pointed out a few weeks ago the University of Michigan is a very politicized environment so we really have to &-um get a good &~ex assessment of the major players and their roles of power and all those other things . 483775_503215
one of the main people or organizations that we're working with is the Rackham School . 503695_507675
they actually house a_lot_of the different programs or there is information there available for parents who are also students . 508295_516415
&-um it's an umbrella organization that acts as headquarters for many of the graduate programs on campus and &-um some of the programs that are available are kids care at home which provides service for kids who are sick at home for &-um a fee . 517395_531215
family housing family care resources program . 531795_534555
and our contact there is Jane Landow . 535385_537205
Jane is the parent advocate for graduate students . 537545_539885
and she essentially serves as a voice for the needs of students who are also parents . 540445_545365
&-um she's been very very helpful and is very excited about our findings and really wants to know &-um wants to hear our feedback on what the University is doing . 546125_555525
our other contact at Rackham is Damon Forthman Damon is the president of the graduate student government and just this weekend he sent out an email trying to &-um gauge interest for parents who are also students for like a social network so people can feel like they belong to the community . 555945_573165
the other organization we're working with at the University is the Center for Education of Women . 573785_578525
&-um CEW provides funding and counseling and support to women students on campus . 578945_584165
together CEW and Rackham have recently formed a task force for student parents . 584645_590005
their first meeting was actually last week and this comes out_of a study that was done over the last two years &-um on grad student parents and they explored funding accessibility curriculum etcetera . 590385_604685
&-um the results of this study were basically that parents really want more money they need more money and more resources and also they feel very isolated from the community &-um whether it's within their programs or just the University in general . 602985_616265
the last organization we're working with is actually the Women's Center of America . 617685_621265
the Women's Center is a new organization as of January two thousand and they're very willing to implement new programs which makes this really great for us &-um they're very very flexible about this they're adding new programs currently and &-um so this way we're not forcing any of our ideas upon them they're ready to receive them . 621585_642105
and we also wanted to look at issues of community and organizational diversity within the women student parents on campus . 645535_652155
and although this particular community shares a common experience of being both student and parent a wide range of diversity issues come into play . 653075_660935
&-uh for example student mothers at the University of Michigan come from all different racial ethnic religious cultural backgrounds &-um as_well_as socioeconomic levels and &-uh also as_well_as that they are single parents or two parent if they have family instate out_of state what their just personal support systems are in their family . 661515_679195
we initially looked at women in multiple roles that included wife or mother partner &-uh students and employee and we narrowed it down to just parent and student because it was too broad of a +//. 680415_693615
too many roles to look at for this time period . 694515_696795
and &-um the variance of roles in the community of student mothers demonstrates the need for both multicultural organizing as_well_as diversity among the facilitators of the program . 698075_705715
&-uh the facilitators must consider these roles that come into play whether this is just a student and a parent or whether this is a student an employee a partner a parent you need to look at those things . 706885_718985
and also you need to be aware of your own status &-um as well &~i as the facilitator are you a student parent ? 719365_726785
are you going to be somebody coming into this group who has no idea what these kind of role constraints can be ? 727105_731985
and then adapt yourself and your presentation to be there as strictly a facilitator and not somebody to say I'm in you know the same boat as you tell me how you're feeling oh that's that's terrible that's too much . 732425_744605
&-um it's also important to examine the cultural and religious beliefs of the particular group of student mothers that you are working with . 745925_751665
for example &-um African women maybe international students who come there +//. 752085_757465
a_lot_of African cultures women carry their babies constantly even up to like two years old on their chests or back . 758285_763565
and how you need to be aware of that and say +"/. 764325_767205
+" well maybe you wouldn't be so constrained in your roles if you put your baby down for a little while and did your housework . 767405_772865
and and then you need to understand that that's how these women do everything and not try to say that that's a bad thing for their children to be you_know visibly attached to them twenty four hours a day . 773265_784925
and also for religious and cultural backgrounds there may be outside role constraints coming from a particular religion or culture inflicted on the woman for being a student while they're a parent . 785705_798945
so you need to look at those issues as well . 800425_802105
and always be aware of your bias and privilege when working with xxx . 803225_805625
you might wanna move a little bit so that people here can see the slides . 805985_811705
&-um I'm gonna talk about methodology what we're planning to do and how we're planning to do it . 813975_818655
&-um we are +//. 819215_821055
actually last night we initiated our first contact to get to &-um parents who are also students and we did this via email &-um emailing different &-um departments and different schools within the University of Michigan . 821815_834835
and as of like three hours ago we'd already received nine answers of people who wanted to participate so this is obviously a real concern for people in the University of Michigan . 835785_848385
&-um within that email we stated that we would have these +//. 849185_853005
ask them what days would be most accommodating for them what nights what evenings what mornings . 853905_858745
&-um within the next month or so and also we told them that we would have child care and refreshments provided which formed an incentive for them to come to the focus groups . 859595_869875
&-um when they get there we are going to have like a one page survey questionnaire &-um about what kinds of services they know about currently that the University of Michigan is providing have they ever accessed those services ? 870855_884935
&-um do they have any recommendations or suggestions about things that would be useful to them as a parent ? 885855_891335
&-um things like that . 892275_893095
we're also going to target with the survey &-um a mass meeting that's being held at Rackham next week so that we would get a wider range of answers for our questions . 893235_902675
&-um and our focus groups &-um refreshments and child care provided &-um will hopefully be eight to ten participants &-um from diverse educational and &~socioesh economical and &-um racial backgrounds . 903745_919805
that the University represents . 920225_921665
&-um we've already actually gotten one man who responded so we already +//. 922505_927025
I know we have a little bit of diversity in there . 927245_929065
&-um we'll have a facilitator from our group and a recorder &-um and then someone who will watch the kids &-um and the groups will be organized according to like what time they requested . 929815_941355
&-um would be good for them so it's very &-um participant friendly focus groups . 942095_946795
&-um and our analysis is gonna be a content analysis of the dialogue &-um picking out what things are important what quotes as_well_as a trend in classes . 947795_957335
&-um which we hope will be helpful . 958635_960175
and these results we will give back to Rackham &-um as_well_as the Center for Education of Women and the Women's Center who are all really anxious to see what these women and parents &-um want and need in this University +... 960775_974255
&-um the work being collaborative &-um one thing that we've really learned already in this is that's it's very hard to target one organization because &-um of the very nature of our project the women's multiple roles in that as multiple roles they're not only mothers but they're students as well and their lives are touched by different organizations that can help and provide resources . 976525_999865
so we're trying to &-um coordinate those different organizations and see how we can help them and how they can help the parents within the University . 1000505_1009625
&-um and each agency knows and supports us in that we're talking to other agencies that share the concern about parents who are also students . 1011045_1018685
so . 1019525_1019745
do you guys have any questions about our project or what we're doing ? 1020465_1023765
mhm ?
is it for +//. 1025245_1026265
are you targeting everybody or &-um graduate students or undergrads ? 1026665_1030785
I didn't hear what you said . 1030925_1031905
both .
both . 1032365_1032625
everybody .
okay .
we're still waiting for the okay to send out a mass mailing to undergrads . 1032905_1037785
oh okay +/.
+, you have to go through the dean so +/. 1038085_1039465
+, yeah +/.
+, it's kind_of difficult but actually the study that was done for two years only targeted grad students and that was actually one of the most telling complaints from an undergrad there was a quote saying you know why is there nothing at all ? 1039945_1051325
why is no one interested in us ? 1051525_1053525
so definitely wanna look at that . 1053945_1055705
(0.5) .
is there any aspect that you wanna &~t &-uh get feedback from ? 1057985_1064425
xxx from the people ? 1064645_1065585
&-um I would think possibly like what +//. 1068065_1072605
if you guys have any suggestions about how to &-um best &-um go about forming with the collaboration between the different agencies and the parents as well and us (be)cause we're students as well so do you guys have any suggestions ? 1072645_1088965
do you mean as far as just getting the meeting to &~org@n like an organizational meeting xxx ? 1089485_1093245
I'm not sure <what you're asking> . 1093545_1095325
that's a good &~i well that's a good idea getting people within &~e each organization to meet together . 1095585_1100625
yeah .
we don't have one set up but that would be good . 1102545_1104585
<I don't know if you> could do a community forum type thing where you could have representatives from each organization there and have all of them talk about their services what they have and then have the community of of single parents in this case come up and give testimony on what they'd like to see and that way you've got representatives of +//. 1105585_1125445
appropriate representatives as well of all of your organizations that are listed directly . 1125985_1129985
that sounds great . 1131385_1131485
does the University have data about which students have kids and which don't ? 1132145_1138825
no ?
⌊ not at all ⌋ ?
⌈ they don't ⌉ . 1139665_1140185
⌊ no ⌋ .
they they in answer to our question about that they don't have enough funding +/. 1140765_1144465
uhuh +/.
+, to to find that out so &=laughs:multiple . 1145945_1147105
one of the problems that I've had is I I wanna focus on the diversity among the group and I can say that I know that student mothers are different ethnicities and religions and whether they're partners or wives or whether they work but I can't back that up with any numbers (be)cause they're just not there . 1147245_1162405
supposedly there's a proposal sitting on the provost's desk right now so that they can start collecting this information but it just hasn't gone through yet . 1163125_1171285
it's it's one more line item on the questionnaire you know . 1176415_1177815
it just seems it's sort_of standard ⌈ it should be asked ⌉ . 1180395_1182995
⌊ yeah just so simple ⌋ so simple that it xxx put on the application . 1182995_1185695
it'd be interested +//. 1185855_1186535
it'd be interesting also to know like if the majority of students that have +//. 1187055_1192195
especially undergrad like are traditional students or more nontraditional and are older and have come back . 1192755_1199155
like I wonder ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 1199615_1200075
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
⌈ yeah ⌉ that's true and I also think like just from thinking about this in the past week or so is that &-um I think University of Michigan the population that we're gonna reach is a little bit different than if we were doing this at Eastern or at WCC . 1202765_1214885
mhm +/.
+, I think it's a very different +//. 1215385_1217745
we would get a_lot more nontraditional students at WCC who are going there at night than we will at the University of Michigan . 1217905_1224445
age of the kids might also be important . 1225165_1227445
I think at WCC xxx you might have a_lot_of much younger children whereas here at U_Of_M I would suspect that you have an older female demographic that has gone back and might have kids at home but they're not you know one two toddlers etcetera . 1227945_1242225
yeah that's actually been another thing that the University looked into &-um because there isn't a_lot_of support for part+time graduate students some programs don't even offer it so you would assume that the part+time students would be the ones with the really young kids . 1242375_1256695
(be)cause they couldn't be there full+time so they were looking into that too how how to make things more accessible for those type of people . 1257235_1263375
just to go along with what Joanna suggested about community forum &-um there are brochures that &-um I think Rackham puts out and &-uh list listing different resources for student parents . 1268675_1279415
but one I wonder how much &-uh how well that's distributed . 1279915_1283755
&-um so these student parents may not know about the resources to begin with . 1284795_1288435
&-um two so that the community forum could be part you know &-um resource fair you know where agencies or units or &-uh child care agencies around the area or public school officials whatever come together and present what they do or where parents can walk around and get the brochures and stuff . 1289125_1306625
and last half second half of that could be hearing from the parents themselves . 1307345_1312425
&-um okay this is great that there are these services . 1313305_1315805
but what about this and what about that ? 1316345_1319105
so I think there's the two issues that the University doesn't know the issues but also parents are so overwhelmed or so busy that they don't have time to get around and xxx . 1318405_1327365
hopefully we'll we'll get to some of those questions by the survey . 1327645_1332565
<that we'll> that we'll send out to we might <get answers> to some of those . 1333545_1337565
hopefully .
information's been a problem . 1337985_1340745
like in both directions because a &~un the University can't ask on like your application for admission . 1342375_1347795
you know if you have kids or if you're married those are all you know taboo questions so unless they have money to fund a follow+up project for &~th those kind of questions then they're not gonna get asked . 1348355_1358155
and then you know each of the centers that we've talked to have a web page or some information resources but they aren't linked to each_other so there's no network so they're not really having a good dialogue interacting . 1358415_1368695
and then like on the Rackham page it has a list of services for students but a_lot_of them'll be headed under like for the Family Housing so if you're not in Family Housing you can't access these services . 1368845_1378005
you you hafta like pick and choose which services are available to you and and it gets really complicated to even figure out . 1378265_1384845
you know what am I eligible for ? 1385225_1386445
so that information has been a really big problem in this whole +//. 1386685_1390165
which is why we wanna make sure our information is available to more than one group we don't want them to +//. 1390345_1395405
everyone to get the jump on it or whatever and try to duplicate services but we want everyone to know what we discover &~s to help alleviate some of this information lag . 1395585_1403645
well maybe if like you get a_lot_of responses hopefully to your email that &-um and you can't include all those people in both of the focus groups for like logistical reasons or whatever maybe you can send all the people that responded to the the survey at least or something . 1405085_1423045
did you get any reaction around the issue that you know you are MSW students for example there are some other MSW students who are parents and sort_of feel weird about going to you to talk about issues . 1428705_1440465
&-um I've gotten &~a the emails but I haven't responded yet to them (be)cause I've been in class all day &-um and I noticed one &~o one of (th)em was an MSW student and a_couple_of (th)em were from doctoral students from biopsych and so a couple +//. 1441665_1457985
a_lot_of (th)em are probably gonna have more education &=laughs:multiple than we are but &-um but I'm hoping that it'll be helpful . 1458365_1465285
like it's really not us who's who're presenting it's really them who are sharing together what resources they have and what they know about and what their concerns are so (0.7) anything else ? 1465475_1483155
you can now eat your Pixie Sticks &=laughs:multiple . 1483795_1487075
if you haven't started already .
thank you &=applause:multiple . 1487875_1490615
people next week we gonna have guest speaker Anne Walt who gonna talk about the &-uh her experience working with the women's organization in Rwanda after genocide . 1497865_1508345
so that's gonna be very interesting &-um especially for those of you who want to do international work or want to work with a nonprofit organization you know like transcultural organization . 1509205_1518565
so that's that's one agenda &-um +... 1519505_1521965
and I &~s please bring back that stack of paper I gave to you today . 1524525_1528185
and you can look through them and if some of them may xxx programs for example there is defining community and there is a couple handouts that you can peel out if that's useful to your assignment you can do that part of as part of your paper xxx &=end_of_first_day_of_presentations:_BEGIN_SECOND_DAY . 1528705_1552405
so basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna fill you in briefly about &-um some of our issues and some of our central strategies and tactics how we're gonna focus more than on &-um processing what occurred when we met with the program &~co coordinator of Generations last evening and some issues that arose from that conversation . 1550045_1567685
however on the board there's a brief outline of what we're gonna do . 1568145_1569925
we're just gonna I'm gonna introduce the program real quick do the five issues and then Theresa's gonna chat about the strengths and limitations that we see of the strategic plan that we created for Generations and then &-um Jessica and Jason are gonna &-um talk about the &-um meeting that we had with the program coordinator last night . 1569955_1589515
&-um like you guys know Generations is a program that deals with children who &-um either have a parent or guardian &-um in prison or &-um have a parent or guardian or close relative that is &-um at risk for &-um I guess falling +//. 1591165_1608885
committing crimes . 1610025_1610525
&-um as you know we work closely with the program coordinator in terms of learning about the organization learning where they are now where they would like to go . 1610925_1619805
and that helped us in a sense develop and come up with the issues that are currently affecting Generations and essentially create our strategic plan . 1619465_1628005
we really wanted to focus on improving the quality of the programming for the children at Generations . 1629505_1634605
so by &-um doing that we wanted to address the children's needs and assets &-um &~in while we were trying to create a street plan all at the same time . 1635585_1647385
so we came up with five issues &-um that we felt that Generations could look at and hopefully address and then improve upon . 1649315_1661115
the first issue was that Generations we needed to know what are Generations' program goals and how does Generations intend to achieve these goals . 1661555_1669335
like you heard about last time &-um they're really +//. 1669835_1672435
they have a mission and vision statement however they're in the process of revising it . 1672615_1676415
so &-um we suggested that they do that so that was an example of one of our &-um strategies for that issue and then the second issue was how can Generations strengthen the relationships between the tutors and the mentors and &-um with Generations and the Generations staff and then the second element was that how can the tutors and mentors improve their relationships with the children . 1677435_1698595
so we suggested that Generations look into creating and implementing an orientation and training specifically for the tutors and that they hold dialogue sessions several times throughout the year so that tutors can come in and talk candidly with &-um the program staff . 1700325_1715825
our third issue +... 1717125_1718005
xxx is how can Generations improve the diversity among its tutors and mentors ? 1722085_1727805
and that was a big thing at when we spoke last time . 1728015_1730655
and it was great because we were able to take a_lot_of your feedback and bring it back to the program coordinator . 1731115_1736615
we even suggested in that paper especially &-um project outreach and also incorporating some of the retirement communities and trying to recruit through the mentors from there to increase the diversity of the tutor mentor population . 1736795_1749255
so we suggested that as one of our &-um tactics . 1749475_1752495
the fourth issue which we spoke in detail about during our last presentation was how can Generations determine the needs and assets of the children throughout their involvement in the program . 1753695_1763015
and &-um as you can remember we wanted +//. 1763855_1766975
we suggested that they were to develop &-um an educational biopsychosocial assessment and that they were to +//. 1767475_1773215
gonna administer that to the students to the children . 1773375_1775615
and then our final issue dealt with evaluation and how can Generations evaluate the success of its program . 1776105_1783465
and basically we &~suc we suggested +//. 1784385_1785645
(be)cause right now currently they have +//. 1785945_1786925
they know by &-um I guess &~s subjective comments that come through they really don't have any objective measures currently to &-um see how the program is functioning so we suggested that they administer surveys and questionnaires on a regular basis to the tutors and the parents and the guardians and the children of the program . 1787555_1806015
and that one's kinda tied into the first one of the whole mission because if you don't really have your mission your goals how can you even evaluate yourself ? 1806675_1813075
if you don't have what you're trying to do +/. 1813455_1815135
mhm +/.
+, or you know <their vision> so exactly . 1815845_1818065
so basically our whole focus was to in our strategic plan like we suggested these strategies and tactics and we came up with these issues and we involved Joanie a_lot in it . 1818865_1828545
in addition when we presented it to Joanie and said here you know if you &~t what you can take from this take it run with it but try to include the children try to include the tutors and mentors and then if you read our paper we tried to suggest ways that everybody could be equally involved in implementing the strategic plan . 1828845_1844245
and in terms of when would the implemation implementation occur most of the stuff would be slated for like fall two thousand . 1845185_1851685
like they're running through they they run the academic year so in a sense you know they're already started this year . 1851865_1856405
we have a_lot_of great ideas and a_lot_of the planning and the prework can begin now however &~m the most of the implementation will occur in the fall so . 1856485_1863565
I'm just gonna briefly talk about the agency's strengths and weaknesses that we've found . 1864625_1869665
&-um first and foremost I think that Generations had really good community &~spor support and in talking with Joanie &-um last night and going over some things with her she shared with us that the Junior League &-um the the local one in Ann Arbor donated twenty five thousand dollars to their agency . 1870585_1891245
so that is just one example of the positive community support that they have at this agency . 1891765_1898645
&-um the other strength is their relationships with the universities around the surrounding area not only U_Of_M but Eastern &-uh they do get their tutor mentors from them and they also do get their interns so that's a positive relationship . 1899585_1913805
we also thought that a strength of Generations was their leadership &-um and their openness and willingness to change . 1915565_1923485
like we said Joanie has been involved in this process &-um every time you know we turn in a paper she's very willing she wants to see it right away see what we've come up with so &~sh herself she is very open to new ideas she wants to implement something &-um to increase the &~effectivene effectiveness of the agency . 1924415_1945435
and that also goes with the agency as a whole . 1947315_1950655
they all really work together &-um so that was definitely one of their strengths . 1951055_1956635
some areas for growths or weaknesses that they had &-um were the fact that we're outsiders implementing you know this plan and this was done relatively quickly we only had a semester to come up with this . 1957675_1972275
some &-uh side issues &-um with that time frame was the fact that you know last night she kinda mentioned to us (be)cause we had handed out surveys to the kids and she was kinda looking for a &-um a statistical analysis of the surveys that we did . 1973345_1992765
and we didn't do that we did you know look at the surveys and you know we get the comments from +//. 1993445_1999745
but we were not going to do a whole statistical breakdown . 2000375_2003315
and that was just a part of the short time period that we had . 2004915_2009295
so . 2009995_2010055
also with the surveys &-um one of the limits that we had was the age thing . 2010515_2019335
with the younger kids it was hard to use questionnaires where you know they could write down kind of an openended question it would really stick to yes no questions . 2019825_2031005
&-um also some other limitations was that Generations only has two &-um paid staff and Joanie the program manager is only there &-um part+time . 2032205_2045845
so . 2046405_2046585
and our last weakness &-um of the agency was the high turnover rate for tutors and mentors and also with the interns . 2047455_2056095
you know they're only there for a semester and then they leave . 2056635_2059375
so that's what we found &-um for the strengths and weaknesses <of Generations> . 2059695_2064415
as far as our plan goes . 2064835_2066435
mhm .
right .
as far as you know anything +/. 2066655_2068035
right +/.
+, that would be like a block to our plan .
&-um so we did meet with Joanie last night . 2069635_2073655
and since it is more of an informal kind_of place . 2073895_2077055
you know she picked Applebee's &=laughs you know for us to do our little thing so over our hot chocolate and coffee &-uh we presented it to her . 2077235_2084575
and I think one of the most important things that we got out_of it out_of the whole presentation process +//. 2085455_2089675
I don't know if you guys have done +//. 2089875_2091395
any of you guys have done it yet &-um I guess I thought back to the beginning of the semester when if you saw the strategic planning chart how it's always a continuum and always keeps going . 2091575_2101855
and even as we're sitting there presenting we're brainstorming more things . 2102215_2105435
and just coming up with more and more things that it was like oh I wish I woulda thought about that for the paper kinda thing but it really was just a good session &~t you know just to use that even as a basis . 2106295_2116675
you know the strategic plan as a basis for things . 2117095_2119555
and I guess at this point since you do have such limited time in consideration that that's basically all it can be &=laughs for the most part . 2119755_2126755
but &-um she was really happy we shared the survey results with her we really made sure +//. 2127575_2132815
we wanted her to know how the kids felt about the place and that was one of our main things is we wanted her to know that they do enjoy it first of all that it is a place +//. 2133095_2141295
let's talk over here too . 2141455_2142255
that it is a place that they wanna come to &=laughs and if possibly more . 2142575_2145875
&-um and she was like they were saying the feedback you guys gave us for like the project outreach and those programs she was really excited about those . 2146745_2155825
I mean the whole project outreach thing just to know that she'd have a commitment which is a big thing there . 2156085_2160625
to have commitment and just involve more people in any possible way . 2161085_2166005
&-um one of the things that we did end up brainstorming on a little which &~person I don't know why we <didn't do it> before was the whole tutor thing right now she has two IP +//. 2167065_2176165
or not tutor intern thing . 2176845_2178025
she has two IP interns right now . 2178165_2179745
and she has such a hectic schedule . 2180005_2182465
and she's a part+time person as coordinator . 2183005_2185465
and it's just such a simple idea to maybe take on a CO person and or management person who can really take part of the workload for her . 2186205_2194425
and you know obviously not a ton of it . 2195195_2197295
but it can really help her use her position in certain ways . 2197515_2200435
&-um she did have some reservations about that &~th she likes the idea but just she seems to have had bad experiences about who she's even hadta interview and I guess we all know Office of Field Instruction pretty much controls who interviews where and whatever so she hasn't had even as many people to choose from as she would want or people would change +//. 2201435_2222975
she's only had interns two years . 2222955_2224335
and she had some people change like halfway through and leave and things like that . 2224895_2229335
&~i so another option we thought of was I don't think she realized the intern programs at Eastern that they have and she also realizes that there's programs at Washtenaw Community College and just you know the different places she can look now for interns and so that was just a whole nother realm that came out_of the presentation part of this . 2229735_2249775
&-um another thing that we suggested to her was you know to find tutors and mentors or even &-um some volunteers to come in occasionally from retirement centers where there's you know a majority of people that're &-um looking to provide activities for themselves and also to help out other people . 2250555_2267755
she was initially not very receptive to this because her impression and &~no from what we understood is she had tried this before and that the people that she had had from retirement centers <they were> &~o they were older which is which again retirement centers +//. 2268715_2282315
and they weren't very assertive she didn't think that they could control the type of kids that she has in her program . 2282655_2288995
&-um we you know &~i tried to sort_of sway her in that you know retired people aren't necessarily little old ladies who are pushovers but they can really be good influences on these children's lives . 2289875_2304315
&-um so hopefully she does that she'll look into that but you know again we don't know . 2305495_2310035
also we suggested to her that she look to local businesses &-uh have her interns you know look to local businesses and see if maybe they can find some &-um volunteers some tutor mentors from &-uh you_know the professional world . 2310685_2323845
&-um again she was she thought this was a good idea but also that you know if they were gonna do it that they would have come to her and I just kinda suggested to her that sometimes people just need a you know personal invitation and so hopefully she'll look at that . 2324985_2338385
also another suggestion that that we had is my internship right now &-um is at a summer camp . 2339485_2345385
and one of the programs I run is for &-uh EI children and EMI children . 2345565_2349645
and so &~sh I gave her the &-uh phone number . 2350525_2353345
and she's gonna call and look about maybe getting scholarships for one or two of her kids so that they have an opportunity and so that their parents or &~m actually specifically for a child if she <has it in> foster care as an opportunity to try something else . 2353485_2365925
could you explain what EI and ⌊ EMI ⌋ . 2367165_2369305

okay thanks . 2373025_2373045
sorry .
sorry &=laughs .
but so all of this came out_of even just the presentation portion of it . 2374525_2377865
so that was kind_of interesting . 2378425_2379825
I don't know I &~d think in a way we wish we woulda utilized Professor Rottmal's her whole schedule of how to have this thing &=laughs:multiple so I might recommend that to anybody like in their presentation phase (be)cause you don't know where to go otherwise . 2380285_2393345
&-um you can get a little scattered &=laughs over the whole process . 2394275_2397655
is there anything else you guys wanna add ? 2399155_2400535
just I guess in conclusion I think we really appreciated working with her it was kind_of a nice mutual relationship where she felt like she gained something by having us working with her so &~w we didn't feel like we were just bombarding her and just using her and just like sucking everything from her +/. 2402395_2416935
mhm +/.
+, she felt that it was an even exchange we were giving and taking and she was giving and taking . 2417255_2420555
so overall I think it was a great experience +/. 2420945_2423625
+, mhm +/.
+, for us in the sense of being able to work one on one with the program coordinator and really get a sense of what the program was about and how you can go about just starting and seeing what the basic elements of strategic plan so . 2424285_2435785
any questions ? 2437825_2438285
I just wanna say that it &~s kinda seems like you guys were able to come in and like pinpoint something that needed to happen and kind of help them think like horizontally about it you know ? 2439805_2450765

&-um the actual +//. 2916125_2917305
we have a document that's the actual timeline and work plan for our strategic plan but it's in my folder right now so I'm just gonna wait (un)til after the presentation and pass it around so you can look at it over the break . 2917485_2927665
&-um but all I'm gonna do is introduce again what the HOPE program is . 2928325_2933665
the HOPE program is the Health Occupations Partners in Education and it's a coalition &-um that was started through the Health Professions Partnership Initiative . 2933945_2944705
and that's a collaborative effort that's national . 2945345_2947305
&-um it's a effort of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation the WK Kellogg Foundation and also the American Association of Medical Colleges . 2948165_2957485
so the goal &-um of the entire &-um I call it HPPI (be)cause that's the great way to remember it &-um for for HPPI is to encourage US medical schools to really start to feed into or to go back to their roots essentially . 2957865_2972085
since they're helping professions it's to get them to go back to the communities the school systems and the very families that they aim to serve . 2972705_2979345
and to increase the representation of underrepresented minorities which in this &~is case are african americans Latino or Latina Americans Native Americans and Asian Americans in the health profession . 2979825_2992945
so &-um HOPE comes from that and that's basically kinda what it is . 2993225_2999625
so &-um I think we talked about that at our previous presentation but just as kind_of like an overview of what our presentation is gonna go over as we're trying to get it up on PowerPoint +... 2999705_3011325
&-um we're gonna talk about the strengths the weaknesses &-um and do kind_of like a SWAN analysis through answering the questions that Izumi put forth <in the> in the outline of the &-um presentation of our action plan as_well_as +//. 3012345_3026865
lemme make sure I'm getting everything some some little snippets about the plan itself and how our goals statement as a group &~matche matched up with the expected outcomes &-um that we found as a group so with that we'll see if I covered everything &-um +/. 3027485_3043445
+, is it my turn ?
+, yep . 3045645_3045865
mkay .
I'm gonna talk about &-um why our action plan is needed . 3046285_3050645
we identified three reasons why we definitely need to &-um address this issue . 3051305_3055825
the first is the need to increase underrepresenteded underrepresented people of color in the health profession . 3056885_3063405
and currently approximately only ten percent of practicing health professionals are minorities . 3064245_3070065
and that's a low number considering that &-um in the mid twenty first century fifty fifty percent of the people in the United States will be minorities . 3070555_3080175
so that's a low figure . 3081375_3082115
&-um the second reason is the public private partnership momentum . 3082715_3086295
sorry . 3087235_3087655
&-um &=laughs &-um there &-um there's &-uh over the last couple of years there's been a dramatic increase of partnership between public public and private &-um entities . 3089205_3099325
and &-um this is desperately needed in urban areas because they lack the funding and the resources to teach the students &-um science effectively and to &~prepa to prepare them to go on to college and major in &-um health professionals so in health professions so &-um public private partnerships are definitely needed . 3100245_3120985
and the last is the changing dynamics of health care . 3121965_3124605
and we &~ha kinda have a rhetorical question here it's &-um are people of color more responsive to professionals who are similar who are of similar racial and &~eth ethnic background ? 3125205_3134605
and &-um the answer to &~th to that is that we don't know because there are not that many of us in there &~s but &-um the I I guess people people think so because &-um they think that it would decrease the language barriers and also decrease the health disparities between &-um the Caucasians and minorities . 3136215_3156015
and &-um there was a survey done I'm sorry I don't have the exact &-um percentage but minorities who are in in health professional schools they +//. 3157105_3166945
the majority of the majority of them would like to go back into low socioeconomic areas to to work so &-um there's definitely <a need> a need there . 3167405_3176865
&-um next I'm just gonna &~sh I guess talk about how we assessed the coalition . 3177585_3183665
it was just simply we met with &-um the program staff . 3184145_3187285
and we reviewed program materials which consisted of the grant &-um grants evaluations newsletters &-um activity observations and one of our members actually works with HOPE so we have the inside scoop +... 3188145_3204385
&=laughs .
alright so I'm gonna get into who who was involved in the planning kinda like just playing coming off of what Ebony was saying is the whole &~p &-um whole program staff is Linda Kingman which is the program director yeah . 3206915_3221175
Joy Canton which is &-uh the program coordinator &-um and we was us all &~tryi going to the meetings and observing what there was going on with the kids the tutoring sessions and especially Angie like she said that is her placement as_well_as the whole parents and &~par and her parents representative . 3223085_3239425
which was partner representative which they have other partners they they partners like Ministers' Alliance of Washtenaw county very involved and the n@l double ACP in Willow Run very involved with this program and U_Of_M is very involved so they do have a_lot_of partnership representatives of the university . 3240175_3259675
the one thing that was kind_of interesting to me was that Saint Joe's is not very involved but that's something they have to look into in that partnership so . 3259995_3266415
well what we found in our assessment our program opportunities is that we have &-um more &~visib more visibility could strengthen the partner relationship and program attendance that's the opportunities they can +//. 3267475_3279055
that we can they can take as_well_as graduate assistant staff can provide program staff the support necessary to strengthen the dormant relationship . 3279375_3287035
the dormant relationship that we found was mostly the relationship they have with the parents in the community because HOPE is mainly a &~pro <is a> is a partnership of HOPE and the children in or the the high school is in Ypsi . 3287385_3303205
and one thing about it is that the kids come with their parents . 3303505_3306065
and we want them to be involved in a sense because we want them to strengthen whatever they learn at HOPE at home . 3306205_3310965
and they don't know what's happening then . 3311325_3312525
that was one of the things that we feel like that's a opportunity they really need to strengthen is their involvement in their children's life . 3312955_3318835
(be)cause that also will empower them as they go on and as that anything else happens in school they will know exactly what's happening with their children and they won't be so dormant about it . 3319135_3327795
and then the program threats is there's only two more years left <in the> &~pro in the program grant . 3328335_3332375
(be)cause this is a five year grant I believe . 3332695_3334335
mhm +/.
+, so with only two years left <they have> &=laughs they have a_lot_of work they gonna hafta do in_order_to make this more than just a grant based study but more of a community based maybe organization something that would last beyond than just a grant money . 3335105_3347625
as_well_as you know new federal leadership . 3348325_3350025
that's gonna change a_lot_of people's programs . 3350465_3352265
I mean who knows how many dollars we will get from the government now if Bush is the president or even if Gore is the president we don't know how many dollars we'll get . 3352505_3358965
so then that &~ch that changes a_lot_of people's perspective of how how much we can give to the children how much you know they can get from this program so . 3359185_3366745
I'm gonna talk about the &-uh health program action plan and basically what Makeba was saying that we were trying to get more parent involvement into the programs and a workshops facilitator guide which will &-um assist them in effectively communicating program &~gro program goals and the promotion of activities that encourage HOPE students and their retention . 3368685_3391045
&-um some of the expected outcomes +/. 3391705_3394165
mkay +/.
+, are to +/. 3395205_3395485
+, strengthen &-um the HOPE partnerships relationships and &-um continue collaborative efforts with the schools the teachers and the parents . 3397565_3408805
&-um also it's to build a more strong relationship with the Ministers' Alliance and &-um the Ypsilanti school district because of the majority it seems like the church is a a place where minority involvement <is a> is a big part of &-um and also to develop the facilitator's training guide to increase the effectiveness of volunteer presentations to students . 3409745_3433525
&-um and that that part right there to me was important because some of the U_Of_M students where they're they're mentor &~par mentors in the workshops that we're talking about &-um health issues . 3434315_3447635
and this facilitator guide will help them to be aware of certain problems or &-um things that might some issues or topics that might be uncomfortable for the students or to &~s to discuss with the students on how to go about it . 3447915_3462995
&-um I guess a better way to implement that information without you know &-um going against someone's religious &~i ethics or &-um personal issues that they find . 3463255_3473915
so those were the &-um expected plan outcomes . 3476215_3478895
(0.4) .
questions ?
any &-um questions ?
⌈ no we're not finished ⌉ .
⌊ no we're not finished ⌋ .
oh okay .
<unless you guys aren't going> &=laughs .
oh the evaluation . 3479935_3490635
okay so what we were looking at in terms of the evaluation was in using the parent involvement plan to really start kind of &~i really to be a framework to evaluating how effective the &-um the program is . 3491015_3506655
if we're looking at trying to essentially make the program sustainable &-um looking at planning beyond just like like Makeba talked about planning beyond the next two years of the program grant and using that time to really help substantiate the significance of this program in Ypsiliti Ypsilanti school district is we work with Ypsilanti High and two &-um middle schools in Ypsilanti . 3507165_3530965
so &-um you have a great opportunity for that population in grades six through twelve to really start to be a core group of &-um really strong &-uh health oriented students to go and matriculate into the health occupation . 3531005_3545605
so the program evaluation as designed right now would be an assessment based on how the kids attend the different components . 3546005_3554345
there's three different components and several activities under the three components . 3554565_3558305
&-um looking at the youth attendance overall their MEAP scores which is the Michigan Educational Assessment Program it's the only standardized test that's given to all students in the state of Michigan that measures social studies math science and writing . 3558725_3573705
so using those scores to kind_of have a more &-um standardized reliable and valid measure to look at that as_well_as their cumulative grade point scores and their marking period scores over the academic year . 3574105_3587685
and then doing a pretest post test &-um summative &-um question type scale that's like a a an a type of Likert scale &-um to really start to evaluate their overall participation and how they've improved the academic achievement how they've become more involved in the community or <how they've been> &-um how they've responded to exposures to community involvement and &-um how they've gotten demonstrated interest in health careers . 3588065_3613385
so we're looking at kind_of like a +//. 3613685_3615225
the way xxx are right now is like a fifteen month plan starting in April through next or June two thousand and two . 3615265_3621965
so that's kind_of a description of it and it would be a nonequivalent comparative program component &-um group design . 3622625_3628885
so that's the way it's established right now . 3629565_3631545
&-um and that's the the evaluation part . 3632365_3634985
so that's really pretty much the gist of the presentation &-uh Joe has a question then we'll go for more . 3635525_3641605
&-um when did you say the funding ends for this ? 3642465_3645245
⌈ &~sor ⌉ .
⌊ in two years ⌋ .

so +/. 3650765_3650845
+, ⌈ you can use the last two years to really substantiate ⌉ . 3651185_3653425
and by the way now that we're at the end of the grant . 3653685_3655405
you know +/. 3655885_3656665
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.

HOPE is really looking at trying to increase any interest in science and health generally . 3755585_3760685
those are our program partners in the areas but they're open to computer science to &-um other parts of engineering not just like biomedical engineering or things like that other things anything to get the kids to to get the kids and keep the kids interested in health and science period . 3760895_3776755
+, yeah +/.
+, with the expectation that this may lead into other things with health health occupations +... 3777235_3782435
this is a stupid petty comment or question &-um about the evaluation process and looking at MEAP scores just out_of curiosity you know I know there's been a_lot_of talk about how the scores are biased because of &-um you know how much money a school system has and that +/. 3784995_3800075

+, or not rural I'm sorry urban areas or &-um where there's underrepresented groups . 3804555_3809435
&-um so I don't know what it what school systems are like in Ypsilanti you know would that be the case that it could reflect negatively when you present these findings . 3809735_3818615
I don't know . 3818895_3819295
just .
there's MEAP scores for the students from I'm trying to remember I think last year . 3820555_3827095
