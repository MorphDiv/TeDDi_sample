&-um but when she realized that they had left it on the
well that is all I remember .

I don't know what the story is about or anything .
it is probably about this person .
he missed his school bus .
is it a boy or girl ?
I don't know if it is a boy or girl ?

as_soon_as two of the aliens and the alien dog got in <that was
and they they got behind the picture .
and as_soon_as those two aliens got in they shut the door down so
then they brought home the proof .
they took the picture off .
and they showed <really &~wha &~h> really what they had .
so +..
