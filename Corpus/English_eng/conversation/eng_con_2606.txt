&-um hate to break up this party here .
&-uh first I brought the book that I thought that I had but didn't have this morning and &-uh this is a Atlas of Breeding Birds of Michigan and it's a tremendous resource and I I'm gonna put it up in the bird lab because it'll be important for you to look at when you're putting together the the project &-um paper .
and I'm just gonna show you for example the Merlin .
&-um this side of the page has basically a summary on biology ecology and so on and this is a map using breeding birds survey data showing &-um what's known about the distribution of Merlins in the state so you can see from the blue dots that you know there's not a_lot concentrated up here on Isle Royale then if I just flip to &-uh +//.
give me another species .
oh here I'll do it I just wanted to &-uh here's the cowbird for example &=expressions_of_amazement so anyway it's very nice because each species is is &-uh has a record in here and you hafta remember from what I said this morning there are some species where that +//.
the data are a_lot better than than others so some of these are probably a_lot more accurate than for the more secretive species but ⌈ <I wouldn't even know about that> ⌉ .
⌊ how old is that book ⌋ Mary ?
&-um about ninety one I believe or ninety or ninety one +...
nineteen ninety one (0.6) okay this afternoon &-uh my plans are to talk to you about avian conservation and management in the United States .
&-uh there's obviously a much &-uh broader picture that we could be looking at but I wanna focus in the United States &-um for a number of reasons and I've done a couple things on the blackboard .
this is &-uh what I put together are some stages of conservation and management in the US and I'm gonna kinda go through these and talk about why these are important to birds and over here is &-um our &~s a list of some important pieces of legislation <as they> &~resol as they relate to &-uh birds as individual species and populations .
and the first thing that I wanna do is kind_of go through and talk about these general stages and then I'm gonna show you some slides with some selected examples .
the period of time pre eighteen fifty is thought of not only for birds but for all &-uh essentially &-uh wildlife species as a period of abundance .
and of_course this includes the time &-um that North America was occupied by Native Americans on up to basically when &-uh European settlement began to occur and and then on until the period of eighteen fifty .
and during this time period when the European settlers &-uh first came and the early explorers they found of_course this unbelievable abundance and no one +//.
this was a a real shock because the populations had been very overhunted throughout Europe and for these people to arrive and find this abundant game that could be used for food &-um was part of the the mystique and the wealth &-um of our country .
well in the period of time between about eighteen fifty and the nineteen hundreds &-um this was a time period where this abundance really began to decline .
there were lots_of examples prior to that time of local losses in abundance but &~a the year eighteen fifty to about nineteen hundred really marks a time period of significant declines and the the species that you identify with during that time period the number one species people typically would identify would be the bison and the fact that bison almost disappeared .
and as far as a bird species the primary bird species that is identified at that time period is the Passenger Pigeon and I'm gonna say more about this later on I just wanna kinda do an overview so when I do the slides you can kind_of relate to it in your mind .
&-uh in response to this overharvesting which occurred &-uh for many species it was not simply Passenger Pigeon and the bison &-uh people began to recognize that some type of legislation was needed to curb the &-uh overharvesting .
and there were several things that happened and in the time period of nineteen hundred to nineteen thirty is thought of as a time period where several very key pieces of legislation were passed at the federal level and two of these I have up on the board one's called the Lacey Act and the other is called the Migratory Bird Treaty Act Lacey L A C E Y .
and basically the &~rea one of the reasons that &-um the overhunting and overharvesting had such a big impact on wildlife species was because of something called market hunting .
and that was &-um that means that if a relatively few number of individuals &-uh became organized and had a good communications network and would harvest huge numbers of a particular species and the case of the the Passenger Pigeon is is a very good one and these would be killed and then shipped in some &-uh relatively rapid and safe way often salted &-um off to large markets .
at this time it was prior to you know having poultry farms and having &-um big meat markets and so on and so &~peop these were in in high demand as a source of fresh meat .
&-um and the Lacey Act was passed and it made it illegal to ship between state lines or across state lines .
now this may seem like a fairly small and minor piece of legislation but this was aimed at the market hunters who &-uh could be harvesting &-um Passenger Pigeons in Wisconsin for example and wanting to take them to big markets in Chicago .
so this was considered a really &-um very vital piece of legislation .
it was in the &~ni about nineteen twenty that a real landmark piece of legislation was passed and it's &-uh referred to as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act .
and it has had &-um several modifications and the basic act &-uh makes it illegal to possess kill &-uh disturb any migratory bird .
now this actually has been extended to include nonmigratory species so it basically comes down to protecting native species at first in the United States but we now have agreements &-um with Canada for example and Mexico so it's a very extensive agreement &-um regarding protection of migratory species and native species .
and this came into play because of concern about overharvests particularly the waterfowl .
many of the ducks breed in Canada and may winter in the gulf or down &-uh considerably further south so they were passing through different bureaucratic zones and in some areas they were protected and some they were not and there was tremendous concern about the harvest heavy harvest occurring in Canada before waterfowl even got to the US .
so this is what spurred on this &-um agreement to begin with and then it's been extended &-uh essentially to all species .
any exotic species is not protected the House Sparrow is not protected the Mute Swan is not protected the &-uh European Starling is not protected &-um and it is possible to get depredation permits for some of the for some species that are protected .
&-um for example if you have woodpeckers damaging your home you can get permission to &-um have them removed or if you have Redwing blackbirds damaging your rice crop you can get permission &-um to have those removed .
if you're an airport Pellston airport gets depredation permits so that they can kill gulls for example that sit on the runway &-um so there are some examples of how to avoid this &-um this particular piece of legislation &-um under certain circumstances .
but this piece of legislation is very far reaching .
it's not just killing it's it is any &-uh possession of so it's illegal to hold any wild bird in captivity .
a pet store was +//.
we think was probably went out_of business in Cheboygan they had that goldfinch in a cage there and &-uh some of the plover people were in there getting mealworms for the plovers and saw the goldfinch and reported it to the local conservation officer and the pet store's not there anymore &=laughs:multiple so <we don't> we don't know exactly what happened but we speculate that that could be related .
&-um there are all kinds of reports of native species showing up in pet stores in the Chicago area .
one primary species is a cardinal interestingly enough .
I think things are tightly controlled now and I think that's that's fairly rare .
it's also as I said illegal to possess birds' eggs or nests without appropriate permits .
and it is illegal to possess dead birds so if you're driving along and you find a great horned owl that's dead and you think oh I can do something nice with this for my bedroom &=laughs:multiple &-um if a conservation officer were to find out about it &-um you would be violating a federal law .
typically they are only going to get involved and pay attention to high profile species like eagles for example &-um but there are lots_of cases of of of people being turned in for much lesser &-um crimes so to speak .
technically it's illegal to possess feathers .
again the primary feathers of_course that are are &-uh being focused on are eagle feathers historically there's some others like &-uh egret plumes and so on &-um so if you walk around with a gull feather in your hat you probably are not &-um going to get arrested but it is &-uh against federal law .
so I point this out because this piece of legislation was passed and I think it's had a very major effect on &-uh bird conservation .
prior to that time birds were harvested very casually people &-um there there has always been kind_of a negative reaction towards birds of prey and people who felt like they were damaging their farms and maybe killing chickens whatever people just randomly would shoot birds of prey .
&-um a wide variety of birds have been harvested for food even those that we don't think of as native species and actually in other parts of the world &-um people in some areas they they feed very heavily or eat a_lot_of small songbirds .
I believe that France has just passed some legislation that now makes it legal to shoot and eat songbirds again they didn't +//.
for a while it was &-um illegal .
I think that that'll end up being changed &-uh just because of of public &~pre pressure but &-um we tend to think of a just a few certain species as being consumed but historically there's been a wide range &-um of birds that've been eaten .
&-um I think there there're just a_lot_of &-uh factors that have sprung from or effects that have sprung from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act that have had a very positive benefit on on &-uh bird protection and I think there are a_lot_of things that we just we can't even measure &-um but it is a very important piece of legislation .
&-um the next period of general stage of conservation in the US is a time period of management and ecology from about nineteen thirty to nineteen seventy and it was this time during this time period that &-um wildlife management programs were being developed around the country and the first one &-uh was founded by Aldo Leopold many of you recognize his name at the University of Wisconsin .
he wrote a text on &-uh wildlife management .
and the focus at this time was really on +//.
primarily on species that could be harvested for human consumption and how to manage these numbers so that they could be harvested at a high level and still &-uh remain as a stable population .
and so what this meant was wherever management was going on regionally there would be a handful of species that would &-uh be getting the attention , would be getting funding from typically the state Department of Natural Resources and federal funding .
so here in the state of Michigan it would've been species like Ruffed Grouse woodcock the waterfowl for example , all of these &-uh deemed as important economic species species &-um that people were interested in in harvesting .
at the same time &-uh hand in hand with good management and knowing how to sustain these populations over a long time period was an understanding of of their biology and ecology so a_lot_of studies &-uh in wildlife ecology were going on &-um at the same time .
well it it was &-uh these time periods are are kind of general but it was around the nineteen seventies that people became very concerned about environmental quality issues and the first Earth Day was &-um established .
and at this time people began to think a_lot wider than just at the species level or just focusing on a &~spe species as having value for humans and there was a major shift in people stopping and saying +"/.
you know here we have all this time and energy that's going into managing a handful of species and we know there are other species that &-um need attention as well one group being endangered species .
one the very the precursor to the Endangered Species Act was a Bald Eagle Act which recognized the fact that bald eagles had declined in number and this Act was passed &-um authorizing full protection and funding to &-uh attempt to recover the eagle population in North America and this was later converted into a broader perspective Endangered Species Act .
&-um so the management efforts continued basically in a single species or population level still focusing on heavily on game species but beginning to include a broader group endangered species and some kind of special intraspecies .
&-uh one example I'll say something later about is the bluebird &-uh bluebird numbers have declined and people &-uh got together Boy Scout troops garden clubs and so on began putting up bluebird houses .
so here was an example of a species being protected not because it was exceedingly rare and not because it could be harvested but because people like bluebirds and they were concerned about their declining numbers +...
the environmental awareness time period &-um continues up until &~da to to today but &~i superimposed on that &-um came a recognition starting in about the late &~ei nineteen eighties and really kind_of peaking in about nineteen ninety &-um it began with people's concern about the loss of biodiversity in the rain forests and people began to say &~a see this was happening on a global scale and see that rain forests were just one of many ecosystems that were experiences +//.
experiencing a loss of biodiversity .
so the all of a sudden &-um a shift began to occur and this is when &-uh graduate programs began to spring up in the universities that are referred to as conservation biology programs and these programs are similar to wildlife management but instead of really targeting species and selected species conservation biology programs focus on basically protection and management of all living things or all biodiversity .
and of_course this meant all birds then fell within this the &-uh realm of of biodiversity .
and at this time there were some other events that that were occurring that were important .
and and one was the focus on the fact that here in North America people were recording what they perceived as being important declines in forest birds .
so all of this led people to start realizing that so much time and energy had focused on such a few number of species .
maybe we should be thinking about population trends in common species or certainly not in rare species but representative species &-um of a particular region .
in this time period of environmental awareness and the more recent one of of global biodiversity protection there are a_couple_of other pieces important pieces of legislation one is called CITES that's the acronym and that stands for Convention in International Trade in Endangered Species that's the Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species .
and this is not a piece of legislation it is a treaty it's an agreement among many nations of the world to respect a a list basically of endangered and threatened species that has been prepared it's a global list prepared by a conservation group &-uh the International Union for Conservation of Nature you don't hafta remember that I would like you to know CITES .
many nations have signed this agreement and what it means is is that they will not &-um import or export species on the list .
and it's &-um some some countries are very &-uh rigid in enforcing this and and in in checking for it the United States for example however you know we have millions of people that are entering and exiting our country every week and there's no way that &-um even good enforcement is going on .
but there are people you know the the enforcement is in place and they have basically a sampling effort &-um there are some countries that you know have signed and they ignore the agreement and periodically we the United States places trade sanctions on them when something is exposed &-uh to try and get them to link in better with the &~a agreement .
this is important for birds the number one group of birds that it probably affects the most does anyone know what that might be ?
pet trade birds ?
parrots ?
+, parrots .
&-uh &-um most of the parrots of the world are have a threatened or endangered status and it is primarily from the pet trade and &-um CITES is one of the strongest &-um as as I said not a piece of legislation but &-uh strongest &-um agreement that helps to to curb &-um trade in in parrots .
another important piece of legislation is called the Fish and Wildlife &-um Management Act and this was passed in the nineteen eighties and this is a very strange &-um piece of legislation passed at the federal level .
and what it said was it said +"/.
+" for any state that has a nongame program established we will provide money .
so and this piece of legislation was passed so the states &-um a good chunk of them about sixty percent said +"/.
+" hey this is a potential for tremendous extra revenue for our wildlife programs so we're gonna gear up and we're gonna get a nongame program .
and the nongame was not just for birds it was mammals typically fish &-um amphibians and reptiles and in many cases plants as well so all these states jumped &~togeth you know jumped up and got these programs going Michigan did Minnesota did as an example basically all except some of the poorer states got these programs going and then Congress never came through with the money .
well +...
they hadta do things to get these programs going they hadta kind of find money in between and many of them did it through things like &-um income tax checkoffs we have one in in &-uh Minnesota and I believe there's one in Michigan as well where you choose to donate ten dollars or whatever &-um on your income tax there are other +//.
there's states that that &~s sell special license plates and the money goes into it some through lottery all kinds of things .
&-um but these programs got established and they were very very significant because they got individual states to start thinking about species other than the ones that they had traditionally supported for so many years through hunting and fishing licenses and just general appropriations from the legislature .
yeah ⌈ David ⌉ .
⌊ what is a ⌋ nongame program ?
&-um a nongame program means in &~i in a typical Department of Natural Resources &-um they would have like a division of fishes and their money and their energy would be going in to making sure there are enough perch to keep the population of Michigan the fishing population happy enough walleye enough trout in in the streams enough you know so all game related .
they had no concern about things like sturgeon that were declining no money would go there &-uh even though sturgeon is a game fish they're just not common enough to worry about and they never would be so they would kind_of fall by the wayside a_lot_of the &-um there's some &-uh tremendously interesting minnows and other nongame nonhunted essentially species that that &-uh would not get any attention .
in in the &-uh wildlife section you would have somebody who deals with upland game the grouse the woodcock the snipe then you'd have a specialist who dealt with the waterfowl .
&-um for example and then you would have somebody who was the forest ungulates the moose and the deer and +//.
or large game include bear and somebody who also or several people who were dealing with the &~h the trap trapping small mammal species those are all the game hunted for game or harvested for &-um a product for humans .
nongame is anything that's not hunted .
so &-um most of the bird species for example .
<what's that> ?
so &~mo until the &~ei &~n nineteen eighties states did not even think about it they put no money towards &-um chickadees or owls or you know whatever .
it was just believed that the energy that went into protecting the game species would spill off and protect the nongame .
so if you set aside a wildlife refuge for waterfowl then think of all the good it would do for Marsh Wrens and bitterns and so on .
and &-um the same for forested areas so the nineteen eighties was a real key point of getting &-um the public and and getting legislators to you know change the way money was appropriated .
okay so now we're at a time where people are &-um are recognizing that we don't have the time we don't have the money to focus species by species or population by population so the energy hasta be spread more widely .
and &-uh many bird conservation efforts are focused at the community or ecosystem level .
that's what I've been trying to do with Piping Plover work is to think about the other species of plants that are involved think of the entire dune complex use the plover as a species with federal status that can help in in protection &-um but don't do it at the expense of other species which is what has happened in the past .
now here we are now &~ki dangling at this or headed in this direction of of concern for global or regional biodiversity protection .
and the question is you know what what's the next step in the future ?
well I don't know exactly where it is but I see one issue that's coming up in terms of conservation and management that people are having tremendous problems dealing with .
and that is <we are now> we've been very successful with a_lot_of species and human activities are changing &-um ecosystems and we're having global pattern changes and we now have overabundant wildlife .
and some of these are tolerable at certain levels , some are not tolerable in a_lot_of different spots , and some are causing &-um very significant ecosystem problems &-um in big regions of the of North America .
I'm gonna give you the details on this in just a few minutes .
&-um so I see that as an area that is going to be very challenging because it involves ethics it involves you know where do we step in and say these numbers are too much for us to bear as humans &-um and &~wh how should we make these decisions whether to try and control populations and how should this be done should it be done .
should we do this for every species that we see as a nuisance or are we naturally gonna see these fluctuations anyway and do we need to step back and just let them occur knowing that there will be some times when people feel uncomfortable with the density of a particular species .
and this is you know something that's occurring with plants insects you know mammals it also has occurred with birds .
okay I think that I've covered everything I wanted to about legislation and these general stages so what I wanna do now is go through some slides and talk about the species and how they fit into these different &-um conservation stages but I'm gonna hafta answer some questions Sally xxx .
just when did the &~sp Endangered Species Act get put into effect ?
&-um the nineteen sixty six is the year that is typically given .
&-um I can't tell you &-um I don't know when the Bald Eagle Act was &-um was initially passed .
and what happens is that the Endangered Species Act is &~peri periodically up for reauthorization and a few years ago it was very &-um close .
there was a_lot_of heavy pressure and and people were really looking at the Endangered Species Act .
and then that was the time when the federal government was shut down &-um for whatever it ended up being a week or so and that just kind_of brought that reauthorization process to an end .
the &~w concerns about the Endangered Species Act it's considered the most powerful piece of environmental legislation that has ever been passed &-um there are a_lot_of concerns by biologists and by nonbiologists .
there are concerns that it &-um infringes on &-um citizen rights when &-um &-uh endangered species occur on private land &-uh that's a very big issue that is &-uh leading a_lot_of legislators to push to have modifications or changes made there .
from a biologist's perspective &-um there are many cases where the Endangered Species Act has been used &-uh to promote the survival of a single species at the cost of other species within the ecosystem &-um and people feel uncomfortable with that one of the things that people may feel most uncomfortable about those who work with endangered species is the allocation of money .
there are about ten species that end up getting you know about fifty million dollars a year &~a from Congress and these species are not logically ones that you would feel should be receiving the money some of them are but &-um some are marginal in terms of &-um &-uh their +...
they are rare anyway in North America .
there's been some efforts that have gone into ocelots and some of the species that are found in Central America and occur just over the border in southwestern US and received a_lot_of money .
the California Condor has received tremendous amounts of money &-um and you know maybe for justifiable reasons a huge amount of money went into the bald eagle .
Kirtland's Warbler here in in the state of Michigan has received millions of dollars .
and then there are other species like the Piping Plover that we typically get about ten thousand dollars a year which barely pays for anything .
so people feel there should be more of a reallocation of funds &-um and that these you know really big money species &-uh need to be evaluated reevaluated as to whether that's justifiable .
and a_lot_of the decisions seem to be very political as to which critter gets the money .
think of the money that's gone into the spotted owl issue .
you know maybe some of these &-um you know I could argue on either side &-uh but that's been a big issue with the Endangered Species Act .
okay .
have you guys eaten your fireballs ?
alright you better (be)cause I'm gonna turn <the slide on> +...
and just burst in if you have questions .
let me see we'll have to figure something out no there oops +...
&=laughs:multiple let me see what it's gonna be like here +...
&=laughs:multiple is this okay ?
might wanna back it up a little get it a little bigger .
(0.9) .
okay now what I want you to keep in mind is I'm gonna go through I talked about those different stages and I'm gonna go through and give some examples and the first one's the period of &-uh of abundance and and fouled with overharvest and this might be a surprise to you but one of the groups that was very heavily harvested were the shore birds .
they would come &-um through areas during migration in the hundreds of thousands and millions of birds they'd congregate along shorelines and they were shot for food and in fact they're very &-um good eating &-um and many species and the Piping Plover is one that there are records of them being harvested I don't know what kind of impact &-um there may have been on on plovers .
have you ever eaten a plover ?
oh no &=laughs:multiple .
have you ever eaten a shorebird at all ?
&-uh no I've never eaten a shorebird I've eaten &-um I've &-uh tasted &-uh Herring Gulls and Caspian Terns birds that &-um +/.
⌈ Caspian Terns ⌉ ?
+, &=laughs:multiple ⌊ that had died ⌋ from injuries and they were not particularly good very stringy and tough .
&-um another group that was very heavily harvested were of_course the waterfowl and that's you know that's not a surprise .
&-um and some numbers were really really low and some populations were almost eliminated as breeding populations in some of the states and it was the waterfowl declines that really &-um were big stimulus for the passing of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and we &~s today have just a tiny fraction of what we once had in the way of waterfowl species .
now excuse_me not species but waterfowl population numbers .
now one of the things that has happened of_course is that we no longer have the problem of overharvest in North America that has been replaced by the problem of habitat loss .
so historically overharvesting was the number one problem and today it's habitat loss and its various &~s &-um various categories from degradation and change possibly through contaminants to &-uh fragmentation of habitat to just direct harvesting of forests or conversion of native prairie to AG lands .
&=new_slide now this is &-uh one that I'm gonna tell you a story about this is what species ?
ring billed gull .
ring billed gull and &-uh this has a neat story that you don't hear about elsewhere &-um it's really not written up anywhere but it is in old literature so you can find it &-um the ring billed gull was present &-um during you know the settlement time presettlement and in what numbers we really don't know but it it was present in the great lakes .
&-um by the early nineteen hundreds it had disappeared as a breeding species in the great lakes which is hard to imagine .
in the state of Michigan right now &-um based on the survey we did this summer there are about a hundred thousand pairs nesting &-um in the state of Michigan .
so what would happen to cause the ringbills to disappear as a breeding species in the great lakes ?
they nest in good sized colonies and they have an egg that's &-um ranked as being a high &-uh in terms of its &-uh taste palatability there is actually a scale of of egg palatability that somebody worked out quite some time ago and &-um when harvesting of eggs for food was was a legal thing to do .
so market hunters &-um knew about these egg supplies .
and they would start at the south end of Lake Michigan at the south end of Lake Huron so Detroit region Chicago region .
they would move north +//.
the colonies really don't start until about Saginaw .
<for the> for Lake Huron and then they go all the way up to northern Lake Huron where we had breakfast at Search Bay the area where we did the Black Tern census .
and then they &~s the &~Ring-bi ring billed colonies start about &-um a line at about Traverse City the islands off the +//.
offshore the Manitous and so on and so these boats would stop at all the ringbill colonies on their way north and they would smash all of the eggs .
they'd go north as far as they could they'd turn back and then they'd stop at all the islands and wherever they found eggs those they would collect because they knew they were fresh .
they were &-uh &-um early in incubation so they were not gonna have large embryos and then they would &~ta pack these in the barrels of salt and take them down to Chicago and Detroit to be sold in the markets .
now at the same time it was a tremendous fashion for women to &~ha wear feathers &-um in hats and on their clothing here and also in Europe .
and birds with white feathers were particularly sought after because these feathers can be dyed .
so adults were also harvested .
so this type of market hunting in very intense pressure went on with the ringbill gulls and because they nest in large colonies they were &-um much more vulnerable than the Herring Gulls that tend to have less dense colonies .
so the ringbill was knocked back .
and it was through protection efforts &-um that made it illegal to sell these feathers and &~illeg illegal to sell the eggs in these large markets that brought the ringbill gull back .
and by nineteen twenty four the first &-um gulls were ringbills were reported nesting in &-um the northern Great Lakes .
it was either Huron or I think it was in northern Lake Huron and then they've slowly increased to the point where in many areas they're now perceived as a problem because they've done so well &-um in association with humans .
but this was a species that was harvested to extinction within a region &-um okay here's another species that was heavily harvested this is ?
Sandhill Crane .
Sandhill Crane +/.
Sandhill Crane +/.
+, &=laughs:multiple and this is <is still> is still a hunted species &-um in many areas &-uh the numbers were brought very very low they are &-um hunted in some of the Western states now but this is another one that was was overharvested .
now this is what ?
Mourning Dove .
yeah Mourning Dove you didn't know they were so gaudy did you blue eye ring and all those details .
well the Mourning dove is not the one I'm gonna talk about it's actually the Passenger Pigeon that I think is the most interesting of the overharvested species and the the Passenger Pigeon is &-um believed to have been the most abundant land bird ever on the face of the earth &-uh &-uh historically and up to modern times existed in the billions and they were a bird of the eastern deciduous forests .
they were a massed crop feeder feeding on beech nuts .
it was a prime food source for them and also on acorns but primarily beech .
and <they would> &-um they were also colonial nesters and roosters and wherever <they occurred> they occurred in the hundreds of thousands and there were historical nest sites and roost sites that you know people reported you couldn't help miss it .
I mean if you've got &-um &~s several hundred thousand birds on your property you you know that .
and &-um they of_course doves are hunted in many states and and and the Passenger Pigeon &-uh as a an adult bird the meat was highly sought after .
they weren't no one was interested in the eggs but the young were also eaten the squabs and it was the same thing as with the gulls .
there were a handful of people +//.
you_know we're talking about dozens and dozens of people throughout the Eastern deciduous forest but in comparison to the the whole &-um human population in in Eastern North America was small .
&-um who became organized to hunt the Passenger Pigeon and bring these in to the <large market so> &~l large markets throughout the Eastern US .
and there were a number of things that went on that helped this &-um this whole process .
one was the railroad came in .
and there were railroad lines throughout Eastern US so they could quickly ship put birds onto &-uh the train and send (th)em into markets immediately .
another was the invention of the telegraph they could communicate somebody could send a message and say I've just found a colony of you know here in &-uh southern Wisconsin at such and such a place and they'd get twenty men on the train and whip over there and and &-uh harvest them .
&-um so the the communication network and the transportation &~netw network was really critical &-um in terms of the demise so to speak of the Passenger Pigeon .
well another thing about Passenger Pigeons that played an important role is that they're highly social .
and &-uh it's thought that they &~n &~n will not nest solitarily and and do not really could not be successful unless there were large numbers of them .
and it's not sure exactly what those reasons are .
but the market hunting of_course could not individually kill billions of birds but they went in year after year for ten or more years and constantly disturbed these colonies so that birds were deserting .
the young were dying .
&-um birds were being killed .
birds were not breeding .
so they the Passenger Pigeon did not breed for ten to fifteen years and literally in that short time period &-um became extinct .
the last bird died in captivity &-uh in the Cincinnati zoo in the &-um early nineteen hundreds .
so this is a this example has been such a powerful one how could you ever imagine that something that existed in the billions a vertebrate no less could be driven to extinction &-um in such a short time period .
well it did happen and it's +//.
you know it really is a symbol of of &-um not the conservation movement but the overharvest and the impact potential impact that humans can have &-um on a species or on populations so it's a a very very powerful story and figured in an important way in &-um in subsequent conservation efforts .
okay the next group so that's really the period of &-uh abundance and overharvest and the next group the next issue I wanna talk about is the era of wildlife management and the studies on ecology .
and here's a species of Canada Goose that you're well familiar with you've heard me say a few things about it this was an overharvested species .
in the state of Minnesota they were extirpated they were eliminated as a breeding species in the nineteen twenties in the state .
that's a long time ago .
and the &-uh &~w people in charge of waterfowl the Department of Natural Resources folks said this is a tremendous resource people want this they want to be able to harvest Canada Geese we will bring them back .
so they did this through reintroduction by bringing in birds from other states where the populations were more robust .
well what's happened in Minnesota is that we now have a huge population of Canada Geese .
and they are valued as a hunted &~speci species so there is a hunting season but they also are viewed as a nongame species .
<people have> many &-um urban areas have brought Canada Geese into their parks and at first this was wonderful because there'd be a couple families and everybody'd like to go and see their babies in the spring .
and and then all of a sudden the numbers began to increase and the birds get up on the golf greens and eat the grass which is not appreciated and defecate which is not appreciated .
and they defecate in tremendous amounts &-um on sidewalks where runners are jogging around the lakes .
in the twin cities there's always a crisis about too many geese but at the same time &-um when they tried to do something about it there were people who wanted them there even in large numbers .
so it's led to a_lot_of &-um court cases and interactions between animal rights groups between management people between the airport is concerned about &-um human safety because geese are have caused fatal accidents and &-um we're left with a species that is &-uh an overabundant species in many areas in Minnesota they shipped extra birds to every place they could .
finally all those places said we don't we can't take any more Canada Geese and one of the things that they did try next that were successful for a while was doing a planned harvest and all the geese went to <local food shelves> .
and that was very popular but there were also legal concerns and now pressure &-um from some of the animal rights groups has stopped that and they found somewhere I think it's Oklahoma that they've been sending extra geese to .
so &-um this is an issue we have someone in my department that back in Minnesota who has contracts with all the local communities or many of the local communities &-um you know like five to twenty thousand dollar contracts for goose management &-um every year so here's a single species effort to manage &-um a species for harvest that has been too successful in that setting .
Ruffed Grouse is another species that's been managed I've mentioned this one before because the recipe for good &~Ru Ruffed Grouse production is very opposed to what is needed to +//.
for good &~conser conservation of forest birds .
grouse need a mix of forest ages so it's recommended that the forest be &-uh viewed as a &-um a twenty four year &-um harvest cycle .
you break it into four sections and you rotate through so every twenty fourth year the oldest &-um &-uh plot aspen are allowed to grow until they're twenty four years and then they're harvested .
but you always have &-um you know every &-uh six years sixth year you have some harvest that's going on .
so this means you have a fragmented forest .
you have a very young forest .
and species of birds that do not do well in this in the fragmentation are really being &-um managed to their death so to speak .
so this was a a case of single species management and it's been popular this is the number one game species &-uh upland game species bird species in &-um Minnesota that &-uh more hunters &-uh had permits for this than than others .
now here's a species &-uh like the Canada Geese was extirpated &~an from a_lot_of regions in eastern North America the Wild Turkey and in some cases in Minnesota it's doubtful that they ever were there but they were close by and so departments of &-uh wildlife had introduced turkeys .
that's what was the situation here in Michigan .
turkeys were native to Michigan .
&-um and now &-uh it must have been about twenty years ago they undertook a big reintroduction program and that's why you're seeing them around the station area .
these are birds that &-um probably came from Missouri .
that seems to have been one of the most successful stocks for the more northern states .
so they were wild birds found native in North America but these are not genetically Michigan birds .
well this reintroduction goes to it &~i its extreme with a number of species and the Ringnecked Pheasant is a perfect example .
this is a species that's highly desirable .
hundreds of thousands of dollars go into this species in the &~w Midwestern states up to the millions of dollars in some cases to manage for the Ringnecked Pheasant .
this bird is found in Asia .
it's not a native species and &-um it does well &-um in many agricultural regions as long as there's good cover and not &-uh &~s harsh winters .
this was okay in the nineteen thirties to the nineteen seventies but a_lot_of people questioned the value of and the ethics of bringing in nonnative species .
for a long time people thought that pheasants had no negative impact on the land they now know that pheasants will lay their eggs in Prairie Chicken nests for example and pheasant eggs hatch sooner .
when they hatch and the chicks leave the nest the Prairie Chicken parents desert their eggs and go with the pheasant babies .
so that is a negative and it may have affected Prairie Chicken populations .
the states will probably you know within my lifetime will never touch the pheasant .
it's too it means too much financially .
it's a highly desired &-uh harvested species .
and the negative impacts are too minor .
okay another group of of managed species are the endangered species the &~s kind of special interest ones and the Peregrine Falcon was one like the Bald Eagle that was affected by &-um problems with &-um DDT so that it had eggshell thinning .
and tremendous money and energy has gone into essentially reestablishing Peregrine Falcons .
&-uh in &-um the US they were essentially gone and it's been through a very intensive program of captive rearing and releasing birds &-um into locations where they were historically &-um around North America that has reestablished them .
they're not &-uh large numbers but they are no longer doing releases .
they are now the the &~nat the population the current population is not being supplemented by released birds .
and &-um their &-um they they've done extremely well in urban areas so that's been very popular .
they use skyscrapers like cliffs and they feed on pigeons and other &-uh House Sparrows and so on and they do very well .
&-um this Bald Eagle puppet &-um is being used to hand rear a young eaglet .
&-um a_lot_of energy of_course went into Bald Eagles in some areas .
they did reintroductions &-uh of young birds in many areas .
it only took good protection .
like in the state of Michigan the &-uh national &-uh ban on DDT along with good protection &-um around the nest sites and so on has led to a recovery that will probably take the Bald Eagle off the endangered species list &-uh in a relatively short period of time .
&-um this is a female Kirtland's Warbler and this is another species that received a tremendous amount of and still continues to get a tremendous amount of financial support .
&-um and they require a very specific habitat of jack pines of a certain age and they nest only in jack pines .
and it was found that they had very heavy &-um parasitism by Brownheaded Cowbirds and so a major program to remove the cowbirds was instituted .
now this is objectionable to some people from an ethics perspective because you are placing a higher value on the life of a Kirtland's Warbler than on a Brown headed Cowbird and of_course that's debatable in lots_of different ways but the program still &-uh it continues on and the Kirtland's after many years are finally they went from about two hundred &-uh pairs up to over eight hundred Sharon ?
&-um why was there so much emphasis about this bird just &~be because ⌈ it used to be here and was declining ⌉ ?
⌊ well the the ⌋ the Kirtland's Warbler &-um I used to take classes there on a trip but it &-um it's something that you can do on your own they're they &~f are found in the Gaylord_Grayling area and they are found only they breed only in central lower peninsula Michigan .
nowhere else in the world .
oh .
+, and that's what makes them a really special species .
they're endemic to that region of Michigan found nowhere else .
they winter in the Bahamas .
and unlike say the Piping Plover where their population's Atlantic coast northern great plains here in the Great Lakes even though there are fewer plovers this bird is a high priority because of its uniqueness .
&-um and and that's why it received all the attention also &-um because it was on forest service land and the forest +//.
and this link with jack pines forest service could get involved with money Fish and Wildlife Service had money so together they could make a united force to towards the management of this species that that you don't see with some of the other species just because the money's not there .
Betsy ?
&-um what's its call ?
it says cheer cheer cheer Larry .
cheer cheer cheerlerie@n ?
&~cher cheer cheer cheer Larry .
oh +/.
+, and &-uh it's a very very distinctive &~i if you &-um they have tours you have to go on tour &-uh into the breeding area in the spring I think they start &-uh late April maybe .
the best time is anytime in May and you're essentially guaranteed of hearing and or seeing &-um the Kirtlands .
they're not at all shy they'll just pop right out and start singing and they're they're easy to see .
yeah David .
it's kind_of off the subject but what about the Bachman's Warbler ?
the the &-um blue book said that they might be extinct it's kind_of old though I wonder if there's .
I you know I really can't I can't tell you I mean that's all I know that there's you know there's this debate about whether or not they're still &-um they're a &~lo there're other species that +//.
where people just don't know the status so sorry I can't answer that +...
I mentioned before that the bluebird was &-uh +...
not endangered in terms of small &~n numbers and certainly not a harvestable species but it was &~s something a species that people really liked &~esthet esthetically .
and they may have declined because of pesticide use .
they may have declined because people no longer were using wooden fence posts and they didn't have old &~o orchard &~or apple orchards with the &~how &~howa hollow that woodpeckers would make in trees .
and a very big effort across the country , &-uh not that it was a national effort but lots_of people pitched in , really has seen a tremendous return of bluebirds .
they're now you know we haven't +//.
it's not that we've seen them a_lot but when we're in open country if there're bluebird houses around you find bluebirds .
so they have really &-um thrived so to speak on relatively minor attention &-uh from people .
the Purple Martin is another one .
&-um their numbers though seem to have declined and really not recovered .
but there's been a_lot_of efforts to manage Purple Martins .
we for a long time at the station had a big Purple Martin colony but they have declined here because of changes in habitat .
they like <an open> a very open area near water .
and down by the beach and the cabins here &-um you know forty fifty years ago this was totally open and now the trees have grown up and it's just not a a habitat that appeals to them .
but this is a species that &-um people like to have around so it was really for esthetic reasons that people found ways to manage them .
well the next stage in &-um in conservation that progressed after this all this emphasis on single species endangered species management and and management for harvest is the concern about &-um ecosystem or regional management or &-um &-uh habitat management <on a> on a much larger scale &~wi with multiple species .
and this Scarlet Tanager is a symbol of large blocks of forest and people who are monitoring songbirds began to report declines in a number of species around the country and they were declines primarily of species that were required large chunks of forest .
and people who were doing the studies and monitoring were able to point out how forests were being increasingly fragmented and just disappearing in areas .
and then there was another camp of people who said well you know it's really not that it's not loss of breeding habitat look at the changes that have occurred in the winter .
in primarily in Central America in some cases in South America and in others just in in southern coastal regions &-um of the United States so this problem of songbird decline you've +//.
I mean I can't imagine you haven't seen something on TV you haven't talked about it in classes or you haven't read about it .
but it's you know where the titles are Another Silent Spring or Where Have All the Songbirds Gone or &-uh the Mystery of the Missing Migrants they're all these kind of catchy titles .
and this really spurred on groups &-uh agencies like the Forest Service and Fish and Wildlife Service .
a_lot_of the private nongovernment organizations such as the Nature Conservancy World Wildlife Fund poured millions of dollars into figuring out what was going on with forest songbirds .
why are they declining ?
are they really in +//?
declining is it happening in the tropics is it happening <in the> in the breeding &-um areas and what is making the decline happen .
so some of the species that were focused on were Scarlet Tanagers the Ovenbird was +//.
is one that is known to well it appears to prefer large blocks of undisturbed forest but it's also found in marginal lands as_well .
the Rose_Breasted_Grosbeak mature deciduous forest and the woodpeckers all depend on &-uh older forests or most of them depend on older forests for food and for nesting .
these are not songbirds but they've been included in the studies .
so &-um there're now &-um there's been enough time that if you look the result of all the money that went into the forest songbird work is that if you pick up any journal that publishes on birds you will find a huge chunk of the papers are on forest songbird studies .
so much money went into it people dropped their research efforts that they'd been pursuing for years just to go for the money .
and we now know a_lot about forest songbird issues but a_lot_of things are still not resolved .
there are no nationwide trends for declines in particular species , there are regional declines , and some species may be declining one place and increasing another .
we do know that habitat fragmentation is an important issue birds that nest near forest edges or any kind of habitat edge where &-um predators are gonna be using these areas have lowered reproductive success .
birds in intact forests in the center have higher reproductive success .
they also are not those in the center are not exposed to cowbird &-um parasitism as +//.
in as great a frequency &-um so we know that those things are influencing &-uh bird populations .
&-um it's not real clear about what's happening in the wintering grounds there's some areas where there's tremendous loss of habitat in other areas where the habitat has been lost there are some species that seem to be benefitting .
so these programs are all &-um many of them are still continuing and as with any piece of research you open one door and you open fifty more .
so &-uh the forest songbird work I think will continue &-uh for quite some time we're still you know getting a huge amount of information .
&-um the original money is not there but a_lot_of these programs are set up and this is a place where you could get &-um jobs &~i quite easily in in the summer based on your experience with the class .
I also mentioned the of_course I talked about my work with Piping Plovers so the effort now in many conservation &-uh studies is to take a bigger approach .
look at multiple species think about the landscape &-um think about conservation issues from a much larger perspective and including human interests because without getting human interests into the picture you can never &-um resolve &-uh most conservation issues .
okay I'm just gonna finish with those species that are now superabundant overabundant and just say a few things about what these problems are and where things may be headed .
this doesn't sound like a real exciting direction we're thinking about future directions and in fact coming up with conservation plans at an ecosystem level and regional level for birds for multispecies is extremely challenging and that's gonna occupy people working on conservation issues for a long time .
endangered species still need to be held by the wing so to speak .
we do all that very intensive management with Piping Plovers so it's not to say that single species management is out game species will demand a_lot_of attention and time simply because of money but these are kind of you know new problems on the horizon .
species like red winged Blackbird and starling have been around for a long time of_course this isn't exotic and they do billions of dollars worth of damage to crops .
during the winter we don't really see that here but they migrate down throughout south south eastern US and there are a_lot_of &-uh control programs to try and keep the numbers down .
the red winged Blackbird &-um I've heard it reported as being the most abundant land bird now that the Passenger Pigeon is gone &-uh in North America and on top of it a problem species , the Mute Swan .
we've talked about this before .
it's appealing , people like to have it around , but it also &-um is responsible for environmental degradation &-um destruction of the substrate and vegetation in wetlands .
and they'd be challenging loons on their nesting platforms .
&-um here is a species that really isn't superabundant or overabundant but it's increasing in numbers .
it hasn't reached anything like the Canada Goose .
it it may be a concern right now .
it basically is doing its own thing and there may be some +//.
a few local control issues but I just wanted to point this out we've got a_lot_of these that are kind of you know on the fringe &-um that people wonder about you know whether they're gonna be &-uh what their future will be .
the Brown headed Cowbird has definitely increased it was a bird of the plains probably followed the bison .
and because it followed bison capturing insects it could not be tied down to a territory and evolved the &-um the behavior pattern of not building a nest .
it's an obligate nest parasite does not , cannot build a nest lays its eggs in other birds' nests and then it moves on .
and the other birds then &-um raise the cowbird young .
and it's been very successful .
when Michigan was cleared prior to that cowbirds were not in Michigan probably they moved way up into Michigan with the clearing of the forest and followed in with the farmlands so the distribution of cowbirds has changed .
next week on the twenty ninth we're going to have one of the world's experts on cowbirds here giving a talk at the required lecture the Hann lecture .
he's also &-um probably gonna go out in the field with us and has offered just to meet and talk with you folks .
and so I'm gonna work with him to come up with an idea of kind_of a general lecture about cowbirds and why cowbirds are interesting .
so you know you have that to look forward to .
&-um this is my special species of interest as a overabundant species you've heard me talk about this the double crested cormorant in the state of Michigan a big worry because &-um they are increasing and where they're increasing &-um sports fishing is very very popular and is a tremendous source of revenue for people and there's tremendous concern that cormorants are eating the sports fish .
perch in particular .
the studies <do not show> that that have been done on diets do not show that the cormorants have big impact .
that's hard to discuss with people when they're fishing and they see cormorants zinging around their boat catching &~fi fish faster than they are .
&-um the cormorants have gone from about seven hundred pairs &-uh twenty years ago to over fifty thousand in the Great Lakes and they're increasing everywhere .
and this is probably in response to banning of DDT and also a big thing is a change a conversion of the cotton crop in the southern US to &-uh catfish farming .
because now the birds have a great source of food in the winter so mortality is lower juvenile mortality is greatly lowered the young they're breeding when they're one instead of four years old and so on .
what will the future be ?
there's a depredation order anyone working within an aquaculture facility can shoot cormorants if they see them catching or about to catch a fish and local &-um communities are pushing for local cormorant control .
<I don't> you_know I really don't know where this is gonna go .
but Fish and Wildlife Service is under tremendous pressure .
one phone rings from a congressman who says +"/.
+" get rid of those damn birds .
and the next phone call is from an animal rights group saying +"/.
+" you touch those birds and you'll be in court .
so the poor person who hasta answer that phone has got jangled nerves .
Betsy .
are they an exotic species ?
nope these are native to North America &-um .
so are they protected under .
these are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and &-um so they have to there is a special what's called a depredation order that is signed by the Secretary of the Interior that allows the &~har you know the shooting of birds that are damaging human property .
&-um anyway that's that's a story to watch .
this is a story though that I really want you to watch because this is going to make big national news on and on .
it's already started but I haven't really seen any big articles yet .
this is a Snow Goose .
the Snow &~Goo Geese nest up in the arctic around Hudson's Bay James Bay by the millions .
and they're grazers like the other geese they feed on vegetation .
in the winter they go down to the southern US and they're in many places they're on wildlife refuges but they go into farmers' &-um in agricultural lands and they feed a_lot on new rice new wheat all kinds of &-um &-uh typically what you'd think of as kind of short grass crops .
they've been protected there is a hunting season on this species and the numbers have &~s began to increase slowly slowly and now the numbers are so great that this is probably the only &-uh vertebrate species whose impact can be seen from satellite because their impact on the vegetation in the tundra is unbelievable .
I've seen the satellite photos and &-um they have completely destroyed the vegetation &-um that they require to to feed on and it's you know it's basically down to the bare soil so this means that the whole tundra environment is changing .
so what do they do well they shift their nesting patterns &-um in response to this there is no predator that can even begin to make a dent their most &-um feared predator &~a is the Arctic Fox .
well if you've got millions of birds even hundreds of Arctic Foxes are not going to &~eve even begin to make a dent so and then there's the concern of with these birds where they're going in the winter .
some areas there doesn't seem to be a big impact where they're spread out but others &-um there is .
so Fish and Wildlife Service is in in huge debates &-um with Ducks Unlimited and all the other agencies and &~noncon and nongovernment conservation groups to try and make &-um a decision that will lead to &-um a solution to the problem .
and one thing that's very difficult a logical solution would be increase what's called the bag limit increase the number of birds that can be taken by a hunter .
well they already have done that and people are not harvesting at a higher level you know people don't want twenty Snow Geese or whatever the level is .
another possibility is that they will lengthen the season of harvest and probably the next step will be a spring harvest .
whether or not these will have the impact that they want in terms of bringing the numbers down is you know it's not known .
because the the numbers are so large &-um that it's it's just difficult to make &-uh predictions as to how &~popula the entire population would respond &-uh to different harvest levels .
but this is very contentious from groups who don't want the birds touched to people who are concerned about the &-um quality of the arctic environment .
is this affecting other species ?
will this have global implications on all kinds of things water quality and and &-um just the &-um watershed patterns and so on in in in the arctic ?
so it's a a fascinating &-um problem .
I'm glad I don't hafta deal with it .
and it's something that I predict this fall you're gonna start seeing more in the newspaper so you can remember that you heard about it here first .
okay I think that may be my last one it is .
and &-um anybody have specific questions ?
or nonspecific questions +..?
yeah .
how reliable are those bird atlases <just in terms of> going out and xxx .
well &-um she wants to know how reliable the bird atlases are with groups of people going out .
how reliable were you folks this morning ?
&-um you know with any set with any data set the longer you do it &-um the more accurate your patterns are going to be .
&-um you can you recognize that with a group of amateurs that <you are> you are +//.
that there're gonna be errors with the group that's doing the breeding birds survey there there're gonna be errors but the overall pattern and just the &-um the strength of the numbers in terms of the data that's what really &-um counts and I think <that the> that the patterns are quite accurate .
I know one &-um for some species if +//.
they're not gonna be because we just don't know enough they're too secretive .
&-um now there was one that I looked at and I was kind_of surprised .
can't remember what it was &-um that the distribution was kind_of as thin as it was .
but if you look under say Least Bitterns there's not gonna be much information .
that's because people aren't out in the marshes looking for Least Bitterns .
&-um and for the breeding birds survey that's where people are driving a route well you're not gonna have a good record of Caspian Tern distribution .
they're out on islands out in northern Lake Michigan but that information is recorded .
so breeding birds survey info that's then converted to a map .
it is very &-um it's not at all accurate for some species .
but for a_lot_of species I think it shows you know very good regional patterns .
we just have you know we just we people just have to keep and will continue to refine the methodology of yes .
<can you give examples > how did the Snow Geese get to that level of ⌈ explosion ?
⌉ .
⌊ how did they get to the ⌋ &-um well through through protection one is one thing and very carefully monitored hunting seasons &-um because my guess is they were probably overharvested early in the century they would have been a very popular species to eat .
&-um and then like the cormorant the conversion of &-um possibly &-uh you know cotton or other crops into like rice was not a big crop historically in the south but it now is and they feed very heavily in these rice paddy fields and &-um &-uh so that would be another that is probably a very important issue .
and then the numbers you know slowly began to build up and &-um moved outside the the framework that any natural predation can affect .
so now it it really is &-uh has led to &-uh you_know it probably as we speak meeting is going on it's a very contentious thing and very very difficult problem &-um to solve for <lots_of> lots_of reasons .
but they don't consider using it is that like economically trying to harvest it like &~some like ⌈ chicken or something ⌉ .
⌊ well ⌋ &~i &-um &~i <there've been> &=laughs:multiple I I know there've been discussions &-um of opening up &-um harvest for native populations &-um so that they you_know essentially could harvest and sell .
for example &-um I don't know what's gonna happen .
<what I> the last time I talked to someone who's fairly close to this issue +//.
he works for Ducks Unlimited .
he said he thought what was gonna happen is that they would have a spring hunt which is almost unheard of because that's the breeding season .
the only other species that I can think of that has a spring hunt &-er is the turkey season .
do you know any other xxx but to have a a waterfowl hunt with Snow Geese during the spring would be a that would be a very major thing .
and it you know it's it's probably something that &-uh some people will block others will endorse some will say this is not gonna work .
&-uh so the whole kind of area of managing overabundant wildlife is what I think a new kind_of professional direction that &-uh is an opportunity for people if you're +//.
if people are interested in that kind of an issue where you're dealing with human social issues and wildlife &-uh protection wildlife biology .
people are not trained they do not know how to deal with these kinds of very sticky problems and they are very difficult and you know the list goes on and on .
we just talked about a few birds what about all you know zebra mussels and dadadada@i it goes on and on .
okay I have one little task you're all ready to race out and jump in the lake and do something .
we need to compile the info from this summer this morning which is not a big job .
if you go into your groups and what you need to do I don't care about the individual points .
what I &~c we care about is &-uh doing like we typically do on the checklist I've got two right here so <let me> &-um you're gonna summarize and put those on the checklist .
we just had these xxx
