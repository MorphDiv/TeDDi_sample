Now one of the things I wanted to do here was just pull
And this is the name of the file first
0 .
Ok, so we have got the source of the year &=writes:year
Yeah . 49540_50275
And the sum of squares there was what ? 50275_53562
For year three three eight nine two . 53562_59284
And for error the sum of squares was ? 59284_65356
two six four five point eight seven . 65356_70699
I'll do two six four six . 70699_75124
Right . 75124_75732
Degrees of freedom is of course two . 75732_78323
two and sixty nine . 78323_79459
and sixty nine . 79459_80520
And the mean squares are ? 80520_83737
one nine four six . 83737_87073
and ? 86483_88076
thirty eight point three four . 88076_91603
thirty eight . 91603_92779
and the F ratio was fifty point something . 92779_96491
fifty point seven . 96491_98987
Uh, ok, so we have got these numbers from the first problem . 98987_107346
Now what I want to do is oh, we will just fill in the model
Ok, the model we have been working on the theoretical model,
Ok . 137963_139259
Ok, and for this particular first problem
Uh sixty four point eight seven . 160271_166641
sixty four point eight seven plus we have these various alpha j's
Yeah . 175436_176107
nine point something . 176107_178292
nine point three three oh nine point three six . 178292_183636
nine point three three is it nine or minus nine ?
minus nine . 189276_190068
then it is plus point three three and it is
Yeah . 204389_207692
If we add these things up plus whatever the specific error is,
Ok . 220708_221436
Ok, so that's specific that's the type of analysis that we have
That adds up to zero . 230108_253868
Yeah . 253868_254331
So why are you adding them ? 254331_255778
Why am I adding em ? 255778_258186
Oh, it'll be the alpha j@l for the oh j@l of that group . 258186_263718
Yeah for the j of that group . 263718_264910
oh I see you put the . 264910_266614
Yeah . 266614_267190
Select one . 267190_268177
Yeah, select one so just use the parenthesis from the linguistic
Oh ok xxx will give you the predictive value . 278439_290422
That's right . 290422_291909
xxx which point will fit this ? 291909_300527
Well each point will fit this exactly because of the form of the
That is, you remember the estimator form here which is xij equals
Oh, ok . 340970_342921
