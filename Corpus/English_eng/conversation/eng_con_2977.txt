okay, ladies and gentlemen . 195_1075
so let's come back together, turning and tracking . 1315_2875
if you need to move your body, go ahead . 3015_4415
so, tracking over here, some of you guys, as you were reading, you were stopping and jotting on Post-its some of the words and phrases that were somewhat unfamiliar to you . 5375_13215
so some of you, I noticed you were writing technical terms that related to basketball . 13575_17275
so some of the ones that I stopped and jotted that I thought were meaningful for us to take a look at +... 17635_22175
so this was one that came up . 22915_24215
how many of you had a fast break ? 24935_26855
happened early in the reading . 29785_30505
so a few of us . 30685_31305
so for those of us that might be more familiar with basketball, if somebody has a fast break, what does that mean ? 31705_36505
those of us that watch basketball . 37605_38645
so S_one, you want to share with us ? 38825_39665
like, if you have a fast break +... 39665_41025
let's say you steal the ball and you're on your own, you can just run down the court and score . 41905_47165
okay . 48005_48345
so, what I heard you say +... 49245_54925
if this was one of your words, you can also flip over your Post-it, or if you have enough space, stop and jot it . 56045_60665
so we have a fast break . 61065_61965
so one way the S_one explained it to us, he said, it's when you're getting control of the ball, right, and they're running very quickly down the court with the ball . 62205_68185
would you like to add on, S_two ? 68345_69085
I agree, but he forgot to say that it's when you're going alone and you're running fast, you have to stop . 69305_79645
so in other words, you're not necessarily in the process of passing the ball . 82285_85305
you're the one that's dribbling, or somebody is dribbling the ball . 85605_88585
so you're running, right, and dribbling the ball yourself . 89145_92405
it's not necessarily a series of passes, it's one person that has control of it . 92585_96985
so I stopped and jotted fast break is when you get control of the ball and you're running down court, meaning you're running and dribbling . 97065_102765
you're not necessarily passing . 102925_104105
okay . 105205_105505
another one +... 105965_107085
nursing their lead . 109835_111195
I saw that show up on page one-oh-five . 111475_113495
now we know what a nurse does . 113975_115075
we talk about magic water here at school with our nurse, right ? 115595_118795
magic water curing everything . 118875_119895
what do we think that means if Drew is referring to nursing their lead ? 120255_125255
so discussion leader, S_three, can you call on somebody ? 125475_128155
what does that mean to nurse their lead ? 128435_129875
S_one .
to nurse their lead is like, if you're losing, and if you're . 130375_136675
so we can all hear you . 136675_137495
like, if you're losing, and you start beating the other team . 137635_141635
can you say that a little bit louder ? 142155_144815
like, let's say if you're losing, and then just catch up to the team, and you're beating them . 145435_149755
so if you nurse a wound, right, it's like you're treating the wound . 151175_154995
you're trying to feel better . 155215_156195
so what do we think nursing a lead might be ? 156355_160575
(be)cause the lead is a positive thing . 160615_161835
what might be nursing a lead ? 162875_164835
how are you acting if you're nursing a lead ? 167245_169765
are you feeling confident about it ? 170025_172185
how might you be acting or reacting to it ? 172405_174605
discussion leader ? 176025_177305
S_two .
you feel confident because you were losing the game, and then you went up ahead and you start winning . 178725_187785
so we think it's a feeling that has to do with confidence +... 188465_191165
yes . 191545_191705
0 +...
and how we respond ? 191785_192645
okay . 192965_193365
let's go on to +... 193995_195775
okay, I see two or three more . 196755_198515
why don't we share, what are some of the ones that we jotted down ? 198855_200695
because these are the ones that I noticed . 200835_201915
discussion leader, call on someone . 202195_203335
S_four .
high crossover . 204315_206435
high crossover . 206875_207995
do we have any folks that are familiar with that term ? 208175_210875
okay, discussion leader, call on someone . 211255_212615
S_one .
high crossover is like, when you do a good move on somebody, and they like, stumble or they fall back . 213415_221735
so S_one +... 225455_227255
so, you as an offensive player, or you as a defensive player ? 227255_230035
if you're an offense player, and you do a good move and make the other person fall . 230935_235375
so, offensive moves . 237635_240735
is it a positive thing ? 241695_242615
is high crossover a positive thing in a game or a negative thing ? 242855_245295
positive . 245535_246155
think it's positive ? 247015_247675
for the person who's controlling the ball +... 248115_252135
it gets the crowd hype . 252255_253255
what's that ? 253835_254395
so you want to have high crossover, if you're the offensive player, you're the offensive team . 254475_259675
okay . 259935_259995
uh, discussion leaders, anybody else that had some terms that they were unclear on ? 261455_264295
xxx .
um, we can pivot +... 265295_270755
pivot ?
pivot .
okay . 274475_274815
so, here's another one . 275475_279815
and if I'm jotting it and it was one you weren't sure about, I see S_eight and S_three adding it to their notes . 279965_285085
pivot . 286245_287685
do we have somebody familiar ? 288105_289185
this could be in basketball, this would also happen in other sports . 289365_292065
what is pivoting, and when you pivot ? 292625_294925
because I know it from martial arts . 295545_297165
that's how I'm familiar with the term . 297565_298785
because our martial arts instructors would always tell us to pivot before we kicked, so that we would get the full force of the turn . 299025_305925
right ? 307845_308445
discussion leader, you want to call on someone ? 308625_310605
we do have a resident expert here on sports . 312325_314745
feel free to call on them . 314825_316405
S_six .
xxx .
it's a physical movement . 317505_330445
so pivoting is a physical movement . 331065_332445
maybe if I act it out, you can figure it out . 332875_336135
so, right, I might be standing here, I catch the ball, I pivot . 337135_339895
so watch what my body did, right ? 340855_342255
somebody passes me the ball and I pivot . 342275_344295
turning really fast +...
in that direction .
you turn .
so, discussion monitor, check in on somebody . 345455_349535
S_two .
what does pivoting mean, then ? 350095_350935
it's like to +... 352075_353455
not to do a move, so that the opponent don't get the ball . 355235_359655
so, I can pivot in things that don't involve like, playing with a basketball . 360425_364825
right ? 365405_365425
I can pivot in martial arts, right ? 365485_367625
models, when they walk down the catwalk, they pivot . 367765_370485
they get to the end of the catwalk and they pivot . 370845_373405
so it doesn't have to be sports-related +... 374165_376025
I'm screaming .
but, there is something that stands out . 376345_378685
so watch my movements . 378985_379905
I'm walking +... 381025_381905
I pivot . 382705_383565
what am I not doing ? 384385_385885
what am I not continuing to do ? 386065_387545
you're not moving, basically . 389615_391155
turn your back .
so I'm hearing words like turning, but what am I not doing after I turn ? 391975_395915
turning your back . 396295_396735
you could pivot completely . 396955_398795
yeah but, you're like +... 399195_400195
xxx +...
you pivot sideways .
what happens +... 400915_402735
you stand on one foot . 402935_403875
can you say that nice and loud to the rest of the group ? 403995_405775
you stop and turn ? 406295_407175
yes . 407335_407655
so my forward movement in any direction has stopped . 407875_411035
when I pivot, even though my body's turning my feet are not continuing to walk in a direction . 411235_417255
in a moment, I plant my feet, I turn them . 417345_419805
the rest of my body moves with me, right, to do something else . 420445_423565
but my body stops moving forward in a particular direction . 424045_427505
so if pivot was a word you were unsure of, take a second to stop and jot . 427945_431105
okay, we're going to have a few more minutes of guided reading in this . 432385_435325
during guided reading, you're not reading aloud . 435685_437845
so, just in summary, taking a look at what we've read so far and leading up to this game, what's been going on with the record for the Baldwin Chargers in general . 443835_454035
how have they been performing this year ? 454315_456055
because the question's asking us about their wins and loss record . 456875_459575
in general, how have they been doing ? 459855_461215
is this the norm for them ? 461535_463235
is this not the norm for them ? 463375_464555
how have they been playing in terms of their wins and their losses ? 464715_467355
does Drew seem to feel like this is the way things normally go, that their season is progressing normally ? 471205_476225
so I see you guys shaking your heads no . 476445_478005
what makes you say that ? 478085_478925
discussion leader, go ahead . 479905_481505
by the way that he's reacting, and like, he's really happy, it doesn't show that it happens normally, because I know if you +... 482265_488425
to this game or the entire season ? 488585_489845
has he felt this happy the entire season ? 490405_494765
no . 494885_495125
so, what does that make you think then ? 495705_497765
it's like, the first time of the season that they've actually won, because he was really happy . 498365_502405
and then before, when they used to lose +... 503145_504645
yeah . 505425_506065
okay . 506765_506865
do you want to just let someone add on ? 506945_508005
xxx .
um, I think Drew is so happy because it's the first time around the whole season that he started playing around, and he's happy he could actually win with his team and that they actually won five points, but he's happy that at least he got to play . 508805_524525
okay . 525085_525525
so, discussion leaders, you mentioned a question about Drew showing he has heart . 526795_530575
so S_eight, can you select some folks ? 531175_533175
we had some confusion in some of our partnerships about what that means . 533575_536715
what does it mean to say he has heart ? 536875_538315
can you fill us in ? 538575_539675
because you related it back to something else you knew in a different language . 539735_542475
so what does that phrase mean to say that you have heart ? 542835_544855
xxx +...
Drew was playing with compassion, and with a lot of effort . 545355_553695
with compassion, or passion ? 553875_555735
passion . 555955_556335
ah, passion . 557075_557595
okay . 557875_558015
and effort . 558575_559455
we think that's what it means to play with heart . 560275_562115
okay . 562795_563295
so, S_eight, can you select someone ? 563695_565395
so how does he show this ? 565515_566555
how does he show this passion ? 566575_568175
how does he show this effort ? 568255_569255
can you select someone to lead the discussion ? 569415_570575
S_ten .
he shows this by actually noticing his teammates . 571435_581055
he notices that Thomas is doing very well . 582825_587305
he notices that his team is playing very good, and he's not thinking about himself . 588025_593545
one of the criticisms that coach remember in that conversation he had with them is he's criticizing him by saying he's not a team player . 594165_600405
so, thinking about that, you said he's noticing the other players . 601745_604805
can you maybe direct us in the text or can someone direct us in the text ? 605165_607605
where do we see an example of him noticing the other players ? 607635_611355
have your book ? 613355_613955
you found something ? 616815_620635
go ahead . 620795_621035
tell us what evidence you found . 621275_622175
oh yeah . 635885_636165
it says, hey, white boy +... 636585_637865
loud enough so we can hear you . 637985_639285
it says, hey, white boy, I'm going to eat you up this half . 639785_642545
hey, black boy, he said, standing, how come I'm the one with the knife and fork and you didn't even start the game ? 643105_649325
what page ? 650325_651725
oh, one-hundred-four . 652165_653345
one-hundred-four .
who is he talking to ? 653745_657405
referred to at the team . 658045_659565
but then there's a line after that which refers to the teammates . 660125_665925
because when I read that section, I'm thinking he's actually talking to him . 666945_670305
if he says number fourteen, he's talking to somebody on the other team . 670345_672485
otherwise, he would know their name . 672845_674005
S_ten's mentioning that he's noticing his own teammates more . 674525_677305
so, I would ask, where do you see evidence that he's noticing his own teammates ? 677985_681905
oh, it's page one-oh-three . 682025_682685
one-oh-three .
what's the evidence that points you in that direction ? 683185_686145
we're not playing sharp +... 686425_687865
we're not playing sharp ball out there, House said . 689075_692275
we're leaving the per +... 692535_694235
the perimeter open for the three, and we're not getting enough offensive rebound . 694595_699115
hey, coach, we're not leaving that dude open . 699715_701535
Ricky spoke up . 701655_702435
he gets the ball off so fast, you can't get it . 702835_705755
he knows he's not going to shoot when he's getting +... 705975_708595
he's getting to a spot . 709375_709915
so I'm going to pause you and push back on that evidence . 709915_712055
again, I see other players speaking up for other members of their team . 712795_717195
this is Ricky speaking up, right ? 717355_718675
and he's talking back to coach, and he's disagreeing with him, right ? 718695_721595
he's arguing back . 721595_722335
where do you see evidence ? 722835_723735
because S_ten said that Drew's playing differently . 723875_726975
that Drew is noticing other members of the team and he's collaborating, right ? 727435_731235
so where, where else would we see evidence again of Drew showing he has heart ? 731295_735795
go and select someone . 736095_736995
on page one-oh-eight, it says, we were playing strong and together, and they were relying on two men, number fourteen and Scott . 738305_745325
uh +... 746465_746805
Ruffy had taken Scott out of their offense, but he was still kicking it on defense and keeping the score close . 747205_753205
I would argue that that quote right there, you see Drew specifically noticing his teammates . 754405_759725
he says, we were playing strong and together . 759885_761525
and there are a few other quotes where we see some evidence of that as well, leading up into one-oh-eight . 762105_766245
so, one thing I want to direct your attention back to, can you flip back to page one-oh-two ? 766105_770905
so there's a quote from Fletch where Fletch, before the game starts, is sort of telling them, he's giving us this advice that this is a turning point in the game . 771145_781745
so, I'm going to come back to S_six, because this is something S_six and I were discussing during guided reading . 782285_789185
S_six, what is it that coach Fletch is telling them that tells us this is an important turning point in the book, or really meaningful for their team ? 790355_796435
we lose this game, you might lose your season .
so what does that tell us ? 797375_802275
xxx +...
and then they might not make it into the finals or the semi-finals . 803835_808935
okay . 809455_809575
so what makes this a particular turning point for Drew, then ? 809735_812075
um, it's showing that Fletch is putting the game on Drew, like, it's depending on him, and not on the other teammates . 812745_821325
potentially . 821665_822065
and then no matter what, however, this game ends up turning out, right ? 822765_826365
it is going to affect the entire team . 826405_827825
this could be the end of their season . 827965_829085
so, ladies and gentlemen, can you make a note of page one-oh-three ? 829665_833185
so that's going to be our homework for this evening . 833305_835725
so go ahead, pull out that page . 836245_839205
