this is stupid . 48975_51055
what's that ?
well . 52375_52695
it's for you .
I think we're all here &-um the MICASE people are here . 55975_60495
and let me introduce the director of the English Language Institute &-uh John Swales . 62175_65955
⌈ hi ⌉ .
⌊ hi ⌋ .
who's one of the brainchild if not the brainchild behind this . 67795_70295
and who's been involved in actually teaching a_lot_of our foreign students English and written language . 71855_77615
yes I teach +/. 78595_79835
through your course +/. 79915_80295

or sometimes a visiting scholar . 88245_89385
(0.14) .
and just a follow+up from last week's paper before Betty gets going . 104775_108995
remember I talked about +... 110995_111935
a mutation in a mismatch repair gene PMS two . 112835_119135
and that if it was +//. 121535_122295
if the mouse +//. 122795_123115
for the knockout there was no mutation . 123395_125655
and Sam made the comment at the end of of one of many that wouldn't it be nice to do this in a regular immune response . 127215_132375
so the latest abstracts that just came out from FASEB has an article has a abstract in it from Matt Hartmann's lab . 133975_140455
and they did immunize the mouse +/. 141755_142955
mhm +/.
+, using the v@l kappa AV system which is Avalon the one that Hoffert studied for <years and> years and years . 143955_149375
the mutations are perfectly normal . 151015_153315
there is no difference between the knockout +/. 154475_156175
+, oh really ? 156235_156395
+, and the wild type . 156455_157155
none except there's tandem repeats so instead of these scattered mutations there apparently there are like doublets and maybe triplets +/. 157665_169585
+, ⌊ that are more ⌋ common . 170825_171785
mutations that are more common than than they would have in their control panel . 172565_177345
and they think that had &~th that maybe those normally occur as a part of somatic mutations and one of those doublets and again you're inferring from the abstracts you don't really know gets &~re normally repaired by the mismatch repair system . 178805_192645
but that's basically all there is that that's the only difference there really is . 194025_196665
+, mhm +/.
+, so there's something remember we had a major problem with the that crazy population +/. 197005_203605
+, mhm +/.
+, that was b@l two twenty and it was not described in his previous paper when he talked about this mouse . 203885_207925
&-um plus the fact that it's a it was a crazy mouse it was that QM mouse that had had a knockin@n on a light heavy chain locus on one allele and was knocked out_of the other so that the only thing it could express was one single heavy chain . 208945_221925
so . 223125_223385
&~sele a_lot_of selection . 225525_226385
a_lot_of different kinds of selection it had an impact on &-um . 226685_230265
+, so it's it's interesting that &~a an article in Science &=laughs which made the News and Views may not be as straightforward as one might think . 233395_246915
&=laughs I think that's +//. 247975_249735
how embarrassing if it turns out +/. 249955_251375
+, mhm +/.
+, to be true . 251515_252095
oh &=laughs:S3 gosh . 252575_253975
well it's probably real <it's just> it's just an artifact . 254935_257235
I know (0.5) . 257515_257795
Heidi ? 262345_262705
am I up ? 262885_263605
okay . 264345_264945
<you can> &~cer you can certainly start . 265165_265945
so we have been trying to determine xxx if you remember a_lot_of my work is &~f focused on determining whether hypersensitive site two in the gamma one locus is really important . 268185_280565
okay and I had showed you a_lot_of xxx data earlier on where we found &-uh &~NF kappa b@l binding sites and stat six binding sites etcetera etcetera . 281445_289505
so this is the seventeen KB gamma one locus it has the i@l region &-uh site two is located here in between the small switch region and the large switch region and then it has the constant region . 292035_303855
so Pete when he was in the lab made a transgene that contained +... 304715_309415
the i@l region &-uh contained this the promoter of the i@l region the small bit of switch through site two and then he put on a &-uh foreign splice site . 311715_322415
and they showed that those &~t &-uh transgenes when injected into mice were properly regulated . 323015_328055
it suggested to us that maybe site two was required for regulation of germ line transcripts . 328675_333695
so a second transcript or a second &-uh transgene was created this one has the I region it has the small switch region and then site two is eliminated from this transgene but they included in &-uh one of the exons from the gamma one constant region CH three okay and what we've been trying to do is determine if this transgene is correctly regulated . 334235_359995
and Pete studied three mice he studied thirty two fifty one thirty two sixty two and thirty three eighty three you can see their copy number here and only one of them thirty three eighty three is properly regulated . 360545_373245
and the other two were so low copy number and they just couldn't couldn't determine it so we created five more lines with this transgene those are listed here and I only have data today from two of them the others will be coming out later in the week . 374185_388005
the way we have several ways that we analyze these transgenes for expression . 389785_393465
&-um first of all we have been looking at their endogenous locus just to make sure that &-uh we see up regulation of endogenous gamma one gene when treated with LPS plus IL four over LPS alone . 394525_406885
and to look at the endogenous locus we use a primer that's in the i@l region twelve sixty four . 407405_412265
and then we use a primer that's in the gamma one constant region . 412885_415885
and we analyzed that with &-uh primer twelve sixty three and that's shown here . 416995_421355
or that probe is there . 421855_422875
we then to look for spliced transcript products . 424635_427695
we have two &~metho well three we either use primer twelve sixty four which is in the I exon and primer eighty four nineteen which we generated which is a primer that spans this splice site so it's only gonna detect properly spliced transcripts so it starts in the CH three and it ends on the other side of the splice which is &-uh just this side of the switch region . 428225_455465
okay ? 456565_456845
and we detect that with twelve sixty three probe . 456945_460245
another way that we've used to detect this is we'll use this primer set twelve sixty four and thirty seven ninety six which is actually in CH three . 460965_470965
and then we will either probe that with twelve sixty three which in that case you would it would not hafta be absolutely correctly spliced to see it +/. 471885_480865
mhm +/.
+, right because it &~cou this could be screwed up a little or we probe it with eighty four nineteen which would mean it hasta be correctly spliced to see it . 481425_489805
but I mean can't you tell by the size ? 490065_491425
⌈ whether it's ⌉ . 493565_494125
⌊ no ⌋ .
no ?
unhunh .
okay . 494805_495725
not really . 495785_496245
you're running these on agarous gels right ? 497765_499465
yeah . 499645_499785
<what's the size> &~betw what's the size of the &-um the transgene so between eighty four nineteen or thirty seven ninety six in the i@l region ? 499795_512375
(0.4) .
&-um it's like forty or fifty base pairs max . 513595_520215
you can't tell it when you're running on agarous and blot it you can't tell the difference . 520675_524455
why is eighty four nineteen picking up &~pro correctly spliced ? 526515_532255
because that primer was made through the splice site . 532575_535775
so if it's spliced it would be negative ? 537895_539295
so if it's spliced says it's positive . 539935_542255
isn't the splice acceptor <on the> on the beginning of CH three ? 544375_547875
yes and that this &~pri this primer spans that . 548635_552295
no it its it spans the splicing goes like this . 553375_558715
I I couldn't draw this that way but the splice +/. 560195_562575
⌈ oh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ product ⌋ goes like this and +/. 562835_563995
+, ⌈ oh I'm sorry ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ this primer ⌋ spans from that ⌈ to the I sorry sorry . 564215_568515
okay ⌉ .
⌊ to the okay gotcha okay okay ⌋ .
&-um alright . 569755_572435
so when we look at thirty three eighty three using this +//. 573195_580475
Pete did this work using twelve sixty four +/. 580915_583215
oh yeah +/.
+, and thirty seven ninety six and probing with twelve sixty three . 584135_588315
okay ?
you see properly regulated &~tr splice transcripts . 590075_594455
properly regulated transcripts okay ? 594475_596075
so you don't see it in LPS but you do see it with LPS plus IL four . 596315_599635
(0.5) if (0.16) xxx if I take and use the same primers twelve sixty four and eighty four nineteen and probe with twelve I'm sorry if I okay so if I take twelve sixty four and thirty seven ninety six and probe with twelve sixty three A you get properly regulated transcripts . 622135_635115
if you take the same primers twelve sixty four and thirty seven ninety six and probe with this splice region product then you see expression in both LPS and LPS plus IL four to the same level . 643985_656325
okay .
this is just <a new> a new technique we are completely confused with what's happening that's why +/. 659305_663165
+, ⌈ I got confused too so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I'm starting from scratch and ⌋ giving you all the data . 663445_666005
so &=laughs .
so for thirty three eighty three if I use these primers and I use the twelve sixty three A probe . 667705_675845
you get right regulation . 676425_677365
right regulation . 677725_678345
yeah . 678505_678605
if I use the splice region ⌈ probe ⌉ . 678885_680925
⌊ you don't ⌋ . 680925_681325
I don't . 681585_682125
so &~wha what's the difference ? 682225_683145
wait a minute you &~s . 683365_683905
exactly . 684485_685505
&=laughs:S3 .
the only difference is this twelve sixty three A this splicing event doesn't hafta occur exactly correctly +/. 686205_695265
mhm +/.
+, does that make sense ? 696015_696895
so you have a_couple_of possibilities . 697515_700355
one is in it's endogenous and you're getting this screwy splicing all the way down to CH three . 700735_706395
do you have a control &~f that rules that out ? 707755_709455
I don't think that's +/. 709575_710415
alright +/.
+, likely . 711095_711135
(be)cause it's it'll go to the +... 711815_713055
no wait a minute doesn't matter whether you have splice or not you're gonna get the product by eighty four nineteen . 714835_721715
if you coming from the outside primer . 722825_724645
I think that's why it confused . 726405_727485
no it's not splicing you see the &~eigh that eighty four nineteen primer is half CH three and roughly a half I exon +/. 728745_735025
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so ⌋ it will only pick up the &~k the the splicing that they're ⌈ imagining happens ⌉ . 735405_738705
⌊ but we're ⌋ detecting it with that in LPS as_well_as LPS plus IL four . 738705_742745
it's not like we're not detecting that at all we're detecting it as no regulation anymore it's expressed in both LPS and LPS plus IL four . 743605_753325
but there's no regulation &=unintelligible_exchange . 754785_756265
no eighty four nineteen &~eigh okay so you're using the outside primer ? 757125_763025
right outside primers twelve sixty four and thirty seven ninety six . 764165_766925
right +/. 767465_767485
mm +/.
+, that will contain the fragments either twelve sixty three or the eighty four nineteen . 767645_773665
correct . 773865_774225
if we use twelve sixty three A we see proper regulation if we use eighty four nineteen there's no regulation we see expression in LPS as_well_as LPS plus IL four . 775125_785885
hence the confusion . 786225_787165
hence the confusion . 787265_788105
this is just one of the &=laughs:S3 confusions . 789485_791145
I'm gonna get some more . 791625_792445
oh &-uh let me let's &~fi let's figure out the possibilities here first (0.5) if you're gonna have more <you'd better> you'd better diagram this you'd better get these results on the board . 792815_804455
&~bec either I think either way you should've kept the product . 806075_808075
okay . 808715_809055
so +... 809595_810475
let's see . 813195_814035
maybe you could just do it right here Heidi just put eighty four nineteen on one line and drop twelve sixty three down to the next line then put the results over to the right of there . 814375_820615
alright &=writing:board .
so this for thirty three eighty three is LPS positive LPS plus IL four xxx for thirty three eighty three . 833125_843865
this is LPS negative LPS plus IL four positive (0.8) nevertheless we believe that this transgene +//. 845455_862555
up to this point Wes hasn't even seen this data . 862835_865155
but up to this point we believe that this &~tr we believe this transgene was properly regulated in this mou these mice up to this last piece of data which I just did with the eighty four nineteen probe . 866285_877825
okay I guess what's what's confusing is so <if you> if you do PCR from twelve sixty four with the &-uh thirty seven ninety six +/. 878065_884525
mhm +/.
+, what's gonna be the A positive products with or without proper &-um splicing ? 886325_890345
⌈ well ⌉ . 892305_892945
⌊ can you ⌋ draw that on the board as well so we can see whether we are gonna have the eighty four nineteen medium . 892945_897205
they will gonna ⌈ have it right ⌉ ? 897945_898705
⌊ well the &~possib ⌋ I mean this is the splice donor &=writes:board this is the splice acceptor . 898705_903445
⌈ they're undecided ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ right ⌋ ? 904265_904285
right so . 904565_905205
eighty four nineteen spans here to here . 905445_908905
right .
so . 910725_911265
so either that's &~ri &~s that's why the splicing doesn't matter . 911525_916245
you're gonna get eighty four nineteen . 916745_918625
at least +/. 919245_919725
+, ⌊ part ⌋ of it should hybridize . 919875_921715
right .
correct . 922415_922935
regardless of what you get whether you have the splicing is weird you &~shou should still have half of this labeled all ago +/. 923475_931155
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ hybridizing ⌋ . 931735_932095

right but that's not the issue the ⌈ issue is the positive LPS ⌉ . 932555_935695
⌊ the issue is not that ⌋ the issue is ⌈ that ⌉ . 936415_937215
⌊ right so ⌋ that's what I'm trying to ⌈ say ⌉ . 937215_938155
⌊ yeah ⌋ . 938455_938575
but if you use twelve sixty three +... 939175_941315
you do get proper regulation . 942435_948795
right (0.5) and I've seen this result now Wes thought the first time we saw this with eighty four nineteen Wes thought maybe &~thi I'd made CDNA wrong and I'd made an LPS IL four for LPS . 948105_962545
this is the second time I've seen this result with the eighty four nineteen probe . 962925_966665
and actually +... 969385_969845
you can ask the question with the first pair . 970505_973965
is there any difference in the intensity of LPS plus IL ? 974565_975865
I did a dilution analysis +/. 977295_978955
oh +/.
+, I don't know if you guys can see this . 979355_980795
I'll do it up here . 981155_981855
what happened with A ? 982975_983835
if you use the &-uh eighty four nineteen as a primer ? 983995_986575
&-uh sorry ? 986995_988675
in A ?
in A ?
xxx in A . 990015_990495
for the primer set is that twelve sixty four and eighty four nineteen . 991915_995375
I've never done it . 995655_996295
oh you ⌈ haven't ⌉ . 996375_996655
⌊ I've ⌋ &~not haven't used eighty four nineteen as a probe you mean as a probe there ? 996675_999575
or as the . 1000115_1000535
no if you use the twelve sixty three as a probe do you see proper regulation ? 1001075_1004635
using the prior pair twelve sixty three and ⌈ eighty four nineteen ⌉ . 1006175_1008955
⌊ this one ⌋ ?
yeah .
A . 1008995_1009275
&-um . 1009715_1010675
what do you see ? 1010895_1011415
we see +... 1012275_1014355
I think that's on a blot right now to be completely honest +/. 1015435_1018955
&=laughs ⌈ xxx do that ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ I think it is ⌋ yeah that's on a blot right now as we speak . 1020395_1024375
I don't think I have that data for you . 1025035_1027195
okay (0.5) . 1027615_1028395
so if you look down here in this area can everybody see that ? 1032775_1037495
yeah .
okay . 1038255_1038475
so this is thirty three eighty three . 1039395_1040955
&~the these three lanes one two and three are LPS . 1041295_1044595
one two and three are LPS plus IL four . 1044915_1047475
this is dilution same concentration of CDNA pretty much to start from I by HPRT analysis three lambdas three quarters lambdas three sixteenth lambdas . 1047895_1059715
you can see that they both even out at about +//. 1059955_1061875
I mean LPS plus IL four might have a little bit more . 1062975_1065935
what's the dilution series under . 1066395_1067815

thirty fold dilution fourfold ? 1068935_1070035
&-uh fourfold dilutions . 1070035_1071275
so at most there might be a twofold difference ? 1071735_1073475
maybe yeah and that could be accounted for like I said by I looking at HPRT you know you just kinda guess so to me that's pretty +//. 1073715_1082535

it looks like it . 1157625_1158645
really ? 1158705_1158905
and that's the best I can tell you is that it looks like it . 1159085_1161485
there's gotta be some kind of <an arc there> . 1162965_1166265
but you don't pick it up by I guess from the nontransgenic do you ? 1167475_1171195

it's a transgene xxx of some kind (0.6) God it's weird (0.7) oh Heidi ? 1196195_1196815
yes . 1197035_1197495
have you amped with eighty four nineteen at all ? 1198015_1202195
with thirty three eighty three ? 1203195_1204675
anything well yes it'd hafta be that one . 1205595_1207855

yeah absolutely . 1211975_1212695
so it it functions okay as a primer ? 1213655_1215795
yeah . 1216175_1216395
I'll show you that data in a minute . 1216915_1218195

I know +/.

okay I'm gonna go on to the next line . 1226165_1228225
because I don't I think you need to see it all and then maybe we can talk about it . 1229605_1234285
&-um okay . 1234565_1235705
but when you do the PCR they are coming from the same RNA prep ? 1236445_1240205
in other words the ⌈ same ⌉ . 1240845_1241325
⌊ this is ⌋ &~exac all this is done with the same CDNA . 1241345_1243785
all of these that I'll show you are xxx with the same CDNA samples +... 1244005_1247825
okay . 1249185_1250865
so let's talk about line forty five oh three I'll just show this really quick &-um if you look along the bottom oops just so you know that the endogenous is doing what it's supposed to be doing &-um +... 1251225_1264305
okay so starting on this side this is LPS plus IL four for this line this is amplifying the endogenous locus so with these primers up here this is LPS plus IL four and five fold increase in concentrations . 1266025_1278985
hm +/.
+, this is LPS with five fold increase in concentrations . 1279505_1283225
this one and this one are the same concentration of CDNA . 1283885_1287765
so .
so we're looking at . 1289525_1290745
one two three . 1290985_1292425
at least . 1292785_1293385
⌈ twenty five ⌉ .
⌊ five ⌋ <a hundred> a hundred ⌈ and twenty five ⌉ . 1294025_1295745
⌊ a hundred and twenty five ⌋ . 1295745_1296305
⌈ a hundred and twenty five ⌉ at least okay ? 1296305_1297985
nice really nice . 1298905_1300465
so now if you take (0.9) forty five oh three . 1300575_1311855
okay . 1312235_1312335
so now if we look at (0.14) if we look at (0.5) using if we look for the transgene in these mice looking with &-uh twelve sixty four and eighty four nineteen and probing with twelve sixty three that's down here . 1312455_1342435
this is the oh three mouse ? 1347265_1348285
⌊ forty five oh three ⌋ ? 1348845_1349885
⌈ forty five oh three ⌉ yeah . 1350025_1350385
okay so ach +... 1351225_1352205
oh I see why <it's gonna be completely> +/.
+, okay so if we look here you got three lanes here this is LPS &-um three concentrations with fourfold dilutions starting highest to lowest this is LPS plus IL four highest concentration to lowest concentration you can't see nontransgenic controls for LPS LPS plus IL four out here . 1353325_1373545
so you can see in +/. 1374855_1376095
+, looks nice +/.
+, &=taps_board this one it looks properly regulated . 1377435_1378975
with a different set of primers ? 1380035_1380995
with right with those so &~th I had &~i I don't have thirty three eighty three data to show you . 1381575_1385835
but with the same probe so the probes are being consistent for different primers . 1386055_1390535
right . 1390655_1390835
on &~dif on different mice but there's still consistency . 1391315_1393095
do you with the eighty four nineteen ? 1393795_1394995
&=laughs .
&-um twelve sixty four thirty okay . 1396715_1400415
if I take this is the best mouse we have right now . 1401935_1405515
if I take this set and I do twelve sixty four on thirty seven ninety six with the eighty four nineteen +/. 1405955_1412455
uhuh +/.
+, same thing . 1414175_1414555
three lines here at three lanes here with LPS decreasing fourfold ⌊ concentrations ⌋ . 1414775_1420055
⌈ it doesn't express ⌉ . 1420155_1420495

⌊ it's fine ⌋ +/.

it's beautiful for forty five ⌊ oh three ⌋ . 1427195_1428375
⌈ so then ⌉ chuck the xxx thirty three eighty three ? 1428645_1430145
&=laughs:multiple .
so and I'll reprobe this blot with twelve sixty three but <I just> I just got this stuff off so &-um . 1430985_1439125
so forty five oh three looks great it's beautiful . 1439745_1442405
it does everything we expect it ⌊ to do ⌋ . 1443365_1444525
⌈ so maybe there's ⌉ something wrong with your thirty three eighty three . 1444545_1446345
now &=laughs:S3 . 1446925_1447445
you can say that but it still doesn't we &~c we &~c that's not an answer to the problem &=laughs . 1448425_1454325
if we look at &~f . 1455305_1455745
<looks like> something else is coming . 1455845_1456565
⌊ yeah it is ⌋ .
⌈ forty five ⌉ oh seven . 1456655_1458135
can't see it +... 1460135_1463535
is it from LPS ? 1463735_1464315
okay . 1464715_1465015
so +/. 1465775_1466415
⌊ oh yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ again ⌉ now we are going to look at the endogenous for forty five oh seven these primers this probe . 1467035_1471195
starting with the same concentrations of CDNA &~goin starting with two lambdas here for LPS five fold dilutions out to here . 1472295_1479155
starting with the same concentrations of LPS plus IL four which is here five fold dilutions out to here this blot looks crappy I know . 1480165_1487685
so you can see in this one there's not the endogenous &-uh the induction did not work very well for the endogenous here . 1488385_1496305
or maybe you got <IL probe> that isn't there an awful lot of LPS ? 1496645_1500145
compared to the other mouse ? 1501285_1501885
yeah . 1502525_1503005
okay ? 1503645_1505665
if line forty &+f +/. 1507085_1508285
yeah but <it's just doesn't look like an IL four probe> +/. 1510025_1511805
+, okay &-uh if we look at now I have something else on this blot so I know that the blot worked and the probe worked +/. 1512525_1522665
+, mhm +/.
+, for something else . 1523025_1523825
over here this is twelve sixty four eighty four nineteen probing with twelve sixty three A . 1524325_1533845
this half of the blot is concentrations of LPS and LPS plus IL four . 1534965_1539925
and as you can see this is the same amplification the same PCR for another line and it worked . 1540845_1544845
I mean it +... 1545105_1545485
so we see absolutely nothing for this line and again I have to reprobe that with twelve sixty three A . 1547745_1555305
so it's gonna be like fifty one and sixty two ? 1556125_1558725
yeah and its high copy number . 1559145_1560665
I mean &~w we always thought fifty one and sixty two were because they were one copy but now we've got one that (0.4) . 1562225_1568105
are are they head to tail do you know that ? 1571525_1573785

also I I should show you this piece &-um using (0.6) oh I lied to you this one I showed you down here was was this . 1612965_1626445

that's up here . 1638425_1639165
and these blots are God beautiful to the eye but . 1639305_1643225
which &~pr for below which probe did you use your body was blocking so I didn't eighty four nineteen or twelve ⌊ sixty four ⌋ . 1644005_1647945
⌈ eighty four ⌉ nineteen . 1647945_1648705
okay that's what I was trying to ⌊ figure out ⌋ . 1648925_1649805
⌈ now for ⌉ this one which is twelve sixty four and eighty four nineteen primer twelve sixty three probe . 1649805_1654645
we've got LP +//. 1655985_1656505
three concentrations of LPS three concentrations of LPS plus IL four . 1656745_1660465
there might be something in that strongest concentration of LPS plus IL four but . 1660885_1665705
but anyway <it's not> it's not responding in either +... 1667175_1669655
&~s with either set up the primer's not being &~real okay so it's at least that's internally consistent <with the other> setup of mice . 1672575_1697055
so that is where we stand we've got three more lines these two we'll have data on by Monday this one has been just a hell breeder and so it &=laughs:S3 <we haven't> we haven't killed it yet we now have one transgenic offspring out_of eight litters +/. 1680415_1695375
ugh +/.
+, and &-uh so we're gonna finally kill that mother and do some work with her . 1696915_1700495
but we're kinda left wondering what's going on with this transgene and we we wondered if you had any suggestions we don't seem to be able to have any consistency at all with this . 1700905_1714165
our primer pairs and our +//. 1714565_1717205
and the data that comes out . 1717705_1718845
yeah but you have three lines that are essentially fifty one sixty two and oh seven are essentially nonresponders so then ⌊ you have to look ⌋ . 1719765_1727865
⌈ well ⌉ oh seven might have have had a little bit ⌊ in this ⌋ . 1728175_1731155
⌈ okay a little ⌉ bit with the higher &~concen the highest level okay . 1731155_1733635
so well first of all it bears repeating I'm sure . 1734955_1737275
yeah .
and but <we can> we can say that that those possibly those three lines are &~non nonresponding . 1737995_1744675
they're missing +//. 1744835_1745395
either it's an insertion side effect which is boy that's the way to see <what if> xxx see this again with the higher copy numbers . 1745775_1751415
well these these two are both one copy +/. 1751835_1754695
⌊ oh jeez ⌋ +/.
+, and then this guy is greater than eight . 1755545_1757865
okay .
but ⌈ yeah ⌉ . 1759445_1760365
⌊ but this this ⌋ is a higher frequency of negatives than you normally would have <with a> with a transgene . 1760365_1764665
yeah . 1764905_1765165
so if it could be it's a critical element but &~th on the other hand with two of the lines eighty three and oh three you at least have proper regulation . 1766545_1779105
&-uh . 1780785_1780985
screw the results with one of the primers and probe but you know let's +/. 1781295_1784475
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ not ⌋ worry about that right now +/. 1784635_1785255

two out_of eight . 1789815_1792595
well <we don't> we don't know about those last three yet but . 1794115_1799315
so then you hafta figure out what you make of that . 1800415_1801835
I know . 1802075_1802455
I mean it looks like <it's throwing a> &~s it's throwing a strong dependency on where the hell it is (0.4) don't you think ? 1805525_1814565
(0.7) for something that normally shows copy number independence . 1815925_1823945
mhm +...
position independence (0.6) . 1824285_1828585
and yeah . 1834395_1835355
site two is critical . 1836595_1837115
maybe ⌈ I mean ⌉ . 1838075_1839215
⌊ but for what ⌋ ?
should those two mice be one copy their the expression level is too low that's why you can't ⌈ really see ⌉ . 1839755_1845115
⌊ I didn't ⌋ even work with those two mice those were totally Kirk &-um +... 1845135_1849635

he used the by PCR ? 1860955_1861815
he did it by PCR he used but +//. 1863015_1865895
then the only method Kirk ever used was this one right here . 1866535_1869635
okay (0.6) . 1870075_1870095
and you have to use PCR <by the> obviously if you take out that switch region on any of our transgenes then you use only the PCR to look at it . 1874415_1882515
now the other thing I should bring up is that before I was in the lab a long time before I was in the lab &~th the lab made a bunch of promoter transgenes fused to four different reporter constructs three different reporter constructs cat luciferase and &-uh +/. 1883725_1904565

+, that's critical +/. 1968235_1968715
+, then what was you know I +... 1969615_1973055
so you have data for five of (th)em . 1974015_1977375
let's just ignore the ones that have +/. 1977575_1978835

and so &=laughs:S3 two of the three that you have you've seen indications that they are properly regulated even though the worth &-um the amount of transcription you get is lower than what you would normally see right ? 1981225_1993865

the endogenous should splice between the i@l region and CH one . 2483115_2486575

+, the relationship between &-uh cis@n elements and somatic hypermutations in &-uh v@l region and adjacent regions . 2884085_2894245
in collaboration with Bill Garrard of the University of Texas in Dallas we are looking at okay MAR region and &-uh &~somat somatic mutations . 2895705_2909725
&-uh basically Bill Garrard made knockout mice so they knockout a MAR region MAR is the matrix attachment region . 2911015_2920795
it locates between the immunoglobulin in v@l region and c@l region in the intron in the TSC intron . 2921075_2933195
so they knockout this region so is four hundred and twenty BP (0.4) we got the knockout mice from them and &-uh we keep them in our &-uh mice colony . 2931275_2948395
and &-uh we when they are five months or six months old we use them for research here . 2949675_2954995
so basically what we did was &-uh to kill mice and we covered the peyers@u patch cells and then we spin them spin spin with the b@l two twenty and &-uh PNA . 2955715_2973175
so then we got a population like this here here so then we sort the b@l two twenty positive and the PNA low cells versus +... 2975395_2988355
b@l two twenty positive &-uh PNA high cells . 2991115_2994175
so this population of cells are low cells in the germinal centers . 2994395_3000275
so we are going to study both populations but for now we just look at this PNA high population first . 3001685_3008705
when we got a cells we lyse them and &-uh and we use the PCR to recover the the segment we need so in the +//. 3008885_3020005
in this case we use the primer here this is the v@l kappa degenerate primer and the one other primer is here xxx j@l kappa five so then we got this fragment by PCR then we clone this fragment into plasmid and then sequence them so this is what we've got so far . 3020285_3048065
this sequencing data here . 3048925_3049945
&-uh for sequencing we still use the same primer as that we use for PCR . 3052645_3057285
&-uh three segment of sequence data are available here so for this segment from which you have five thousand work in one one sixty BP . 3059265_3073385
for the wild type this mark wild type mice here out_of eight clones we got the mutation two point four mutation per one hundred and sixty BP . 3076735_3088755
compared with the the knockout here we've got one point zero mutation . 3091295_3098095
this is out_of six clones we need to do more of this &-uh see the difference is <not too> not too &~man &~n not too much . 3099065_3110905
so our hypothesis is that this MAR region is important in regulating &~hy hypermutations . 3111765_3119985
with the knockout we expect to see the mutation frequency goes down . 3121065_3126085
possibly down to near zero here . 3128075_3132195
but three H is lower though I mean all three of them . 3132775_3135755

you can see the numbering system here going out &-uh we sequenced here &~thi this work for you one hundred sixty BP something like that . 3147655_3157155
so we got &-uh point eight A mutations for the wild type . 3158035_3162955
this data is out_of eight clones we sequenced so far . 3163615_3167135

let's say more than two . 3176725_3177525

yes we got two clones there's two out_of eight . 3188885_3192725
and here we got one . 3193565_3195805

I thought there were &~fi three . 3199865_3201725

the problem is we got one with five mutations here . 3204995_3208615
what were the other ones ? 3209295_3209915
this one . 3210875_3211315

then do the other <ones too> +... 3224415_3226475
we we still haven't done the control yet . 3229855_3231915
with this &~ex &-uh <can't think of it> what is it ? 3232365_3237545

in one clone . 3254905_3255485
&~yea in one clone . 3255865_3256305
ooh .
but the one it has not yet been sequenced for three prima@s:lat bit and the two that have mutations . 3257145_3265365

and then so the question is you know he's doing this but then how much how far do we really wanna go with this because now you're gonna talk about since we can't immunize and get &-um +... 3280305_3292425
a VH and a VL that we know something about . 3295025_3297065
these mice don't respond unless we back cross them on appropriate +... 3297945_3300265
strains of mice which I'm not sure is worth all that kind of work . 3301865_3304245
so . 3305645_3306025
but I mean still you know it's +//. 3306385_3307725
so the &-uh number of clones may be similar between more plus plus or minus minus but overall frequency's gonna be less . 3308665_3318905
⌈ yeah I think ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ it might even be a little lower . 3319365_3320305
in the end we may see there are two or three xxx okay +..? 3320665_3324505
between these two in the end . 3330925_3332545
so I'm not sure whether that data is convincing . 3332885_3336605
we have to treat it statistically and I suspect with N eight and fifteen clones that won't be the case we won't be able to prove that . 3337625_3343285
yeah we we can do more clones of this we have a_lot_of this we can do this ⌈ too ⌉ . 3344645_3351985
⌊ and and ⌋ fifteen is about it for the the thirty nine twenty eight high ? 3352005_3356305
yeah we can possibly do more negations get more clones . 3356525_3359505
it might be better to do a different mouse though . 3360465_3362065
do two additional mice . 3363205_3364005
or at least &-uh another &~w &-uh knockout mouse +... 3364345_3367325
then you'd have it you know you're really repeating the experiment . 3369485_3371945
mhm +...
<yeah we> yeah we can start another mouse . 3374485_3376425
but at least at &~th at the present time it certainly does not eliminate mutations . 3377625_3382985
so the MAR only has an effect five prime of it ? 3383445_3387705
I mean <if that> if that is what the hypothesis is is that the MAR is only gonna affect five prime of where . 3388565_3394905
don't know that . 3395725_3396105
there's a +... 3397065_3398105
paper that's been submitted by Milstein that he references in the paper that he published that that indicates he's that he's studied this in transgene mice . 3398145_3409925
which is problematic because if you move the MAR say five prime +/. 3410525_3415265
mhm +/.
+, of this of the construct and you have a tandem repeat it's three prime of the one in front of it +/. 3416195_3421895
+, uhuh yeah +/.
+, so I mean unless you're looking at individual copies or you got some way of doing it that you're not that's not a particularly doable experiment in that format there's other ways of doing the experiment . 3422655_3431015
and maybe he did it that way so +... 3431515_3432695
he's smart if he did it he'll he won't make that one mistake +... 3434895_3438875

+, what the &~pos relevant xxx on the MAR is . 3443935_3445435

yeah at the most you can say that +... 3466055_3467335
but . 3469335_3469975
you obviously expected a greater difference than what you're seeing here . 3472085_3474065
yeah Bill Garrard says the MAR is important . 3474605_3476005
he's he's studied the MAR for I don't know fifteen or so years . 3476185_3479425
and he's got like I said last time we talked about this he's got a MAR that &~was gave us a MAR knockout . 3479705_3484865
