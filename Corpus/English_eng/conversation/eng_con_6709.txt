I get my hair cut at the barber shop .
you can come to may birthday at Oakland .
careful don't knock it .
you can come in our truck ; some people said I can get in your truck and go ; store ; remember we go on bus .
could I break it ?
could I broke it ?
now I know my a@l , b@l , c@l , d@l , e@l , f@l , g@l .
next time won't you sing with me ?
is that mixing ?
I got trouble .
the firemen put out the fire and they're chop the trees ; Grandma have to tell you something .
this old man he play four he play nick neck on my door .
these my books if I cut the wood .
and the firemans had trouble and hires the house ; the firemans call policemans fire .
to see better .
and Jack fell down and broke his crown .
Old McDonald had a farm .
I want some milk now ; please .
bring me a drum .
I pretend ; I can pretend ; look I'm pretending .
I got two apples .
I got two pears and you don't .
watch a trick , Grandma .
playing golf
