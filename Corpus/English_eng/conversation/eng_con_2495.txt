conversation number thirty eight . 5440_7130
dash twelve portion of a telephone conversation between the
hello . 27040_27340
Mr President yeah . 28390_29250
I have Mr Erlichman calling . 29430_30620
you sir . 30690_30960
alright . 31150_31500
thank you . 31600_32020
hello though . 33700_34100
yes sir . 34330_34690
well they have quite a tail of horror to tell &-uh the bit of
mhm . 44410_44780
that &-um &-uh he &-uh and and my the way they put it it's not
so that Bitman does not get caught in this obstruction of justice .
business justice . 58470_59540
but &-uh he will &-uh I-man Hunt's lawyer &-uh right . 59690_63290
he will implicate &-uh the committee lawyers Parkinson and O'brien
why will Hunt do this . 78210_79100
do they say &-uh they think simply because he has no incentive to
&-uh now &-uh he sees the whole thing going up in smoke . 84130_87930
and he just doesn't want to &-uh be the only guy holding the bag .
do you think he's gonna get something out_of it though . 91450_93120
&-uh I think Bitman is the guy who's getting something out_of it .
and of_course Hunt purges himself of contempt when he does this . 97070_100170
so &-uh &-uh he he gets a little something out_of it . 100370_104300
certainly this is a sentencing . 104490_105790
this is at the committee . 106100_106970
however no no this is at the grand jury . 107150_109370
I understand . 110270_110600
but what he's the grand jury . 110670_112250
he's pissing on the committee . 112550_113370
oh yeah sure . 114030_114850
sure . 115330_115450
alright . 115830_116050
now &-uh all of this this whole hour I just spent with these
well I hope you laid into him a little . 123460_125650
I I did . 126070_126530
and I have what I for what it's worth . 126610_129000
I have Coleman's commitment that he will do nothing . 129150_131690
say nothing . 132110_132570
make no move without prior approval at this point . 132820_135770
but what was their argument about sinking Mitchell I mean well it
it's a they recount a whole lot of details and circumstances here .
&-um there are apparently two other grand juries at work . 144330_146730
the one that we knew about one in New York right which is very
oh one which involves his giving an appointment when he was
mhm &-um right . 162070_162940
and and these &-uh they represent one of the witnesses Danny
so they're pretty well up on the progress of that . 169040_171050
they say right right . 171070_171970
the second is here in Washington where the grand jury was convened
and apparently &-uh it comes out that he gave money to Mitchell and
Jesus Christ can't that . 194770_196450
well I can't either . 196830_197940
but anyway the the grand jury thinks there's enough there that
and &-uh right right progress now &-um the &-um &-uh Liddy and
this . 216560_216770
yeah Lydian Hunt Hunt says . 217030_218660
this is a screwball operation . 218680_220060
this Watergate thing . 220080_220910
<I don't> I don't think I want to go forward with it . 221080_223260
Liddy says . 223450_224230
well Howard we have to we can't call it . 224280_225980
off now Mr Mitchell has specifically instructed that we do and we
so this is who tells Hunt tells us this is Hunt testimony . 232190_235740
and it's worth just a and so on . 235860_237460
and so it comes in right . 237500_239340
&-um also Hunt tells Shapiro the reason Lydia is sitting there is
is he has a blood oath from Mitchell that he's gonna get a
so &-uh &-uh presumably Mitchell's never talked to me of_course
but presumably never anybody that will also go in you see now &-um
well no . 266660_267640
but in any event that's what Hunt will say . 267800_269380
Liddy told him . 269450_269980
you see that's the problem . 270470_271460
mhm &-um <another thing> another thing Hunt will presumably
well I don't know whether John advised him . 286640_287860
I think somebody must have (be)cause he went to ground . 288000_289750
and he was missing for a long time . 289860_291470
mhm now &-um <they have several> they have several suggestions
they say first of all what's gonna happen . 297680_299150
is it been ended by Wednesday of next week . 299260_301660
if if hunt goes in like this this is sure to leak . 301820_304020
and there'd be a big front page story . 304040_305340
lots on allegations . 305720_306570
right . 306770_306990
lots_of congressional excitement . 307470_309100
lots_of &-uh ing around among republicans . 309230_311510
next &-um they say . 311780_314350
&-uh the only thing you can do is is beat this thing to the
and they have several suggestions . 318010_319300
fire Dean well no <that's a> that's a minor aspect of this . 319910_323420
so they don't they hardly get to that instantly I've . 323590_326620
got Colson's long &-uh basic document which was written before he
yeah . 331400_331540
and that has fire Dean and these other things in it . 331640_333800
yeah . 334090_334190
first thing &-um Shapiro says is &-uh to restate very clearly that
never was intended to cover it . 343200_344300
well that is for me . 344890_345630
but that's for somebody else to do that . 345900_347300
yeah . 347500_347670
but <he means> he means from here the justice department either
yeah right . 351950_352390
clans could do that . 352930_353580
but no act no criminal act is within the scope . 353660_356580
and so on right . 356730_357510
I agree with that . 357920_358310
secondly secondly &-uh someone &-uh Colson says me &-um &-uh
but if somebody comes into you and lays out the damaging evidence .
&-uh the Us attorney &-uh is given the damaging evidence by &-uh
&-uh next the &-uh the president's man &-uh goes to see Gordon
Gordon &-uh I don't know what you may have been promised . 384520_386860
but obviously no one had authority to promise you a pardon . 386940_389630
&-uh the only way you could be entitled to any consideration in a
and &-uh the president very much wants you to tell the truth . 398940_401740
always has wanted you to tell the truth regardless of have you or
yeah . 406080_406250
&-uh then &-uh you have stolen a march on hunt . 406370_409740
you have broken the case by &-uh persuading Liddy to come clean . 410320_414420
he's the key to the Watergate thing . 414950_416530
the focus is all on Watergate with Liddy and &-uh that you have
that's their plan . 424660_425420
but how's . 426300_426710
this all affect Polson well &-um I don't know how it all affects .
Colson Hunt has gotta talk a lot about Colson I would guess . 431940_434780
oh one that's the other point . 434940_436580
yeah . 436600_436710
is he wants to keep Hunt silent . 436880_438220
one marginal piece of news that they brought in . 438800_440860
&-uh that has Colson a little shook . 441540_443330
is that Mccord has told the Us attorney that he participated in an
bust Hank Greenspun's safe . 457070_458700
Christ steal some yep . 459930_461190
steal some stuff from it . 461350_462460
jump back in the airplane and come on back . 463190_464980
and that Colson masterminded it . 465950_467220
what in the name of God would that be . 469110_470940
I can't imagine . 471200_471780
but Colson stoutly and devoutly maintains that he never heard a
never heard of Hank Greenspun before and so_forth . 477880_479970
<yeah yeah yeah> yeah well you see you've gotta analyze all of
sure . 491350_491590
but hmm why don't you think it over a bit . 493300_495820
I will &-uh &-um see where we go from here . 495960_499100
my &-um it's as I say it's a it's another Mitchell it tubing their
and nothing you can do thereafter could get out ahead of it . 521559_523950
what do they say in essence . 524780_526080
Hunt is gonna testify that it . 526310_527710
right when two two o'clock Monday mhm . 527810_531510
and on application he's going to say . 533290_534750
what let's run that over again with me if you will . 534800_537110
just well <he will> he will tell about his conversation with
we have to do this because Mitchell wants this on it . 542240_544300
right . 544400_544580
he will say Liddy told him that he shouldn't test that . 545110_547300
&-uh he Liddy wasn't gonna testify because Mitchell was gonna get
he &-um yeah &-uh participated how do we handle that . 553170_556380
the Presidential Pardon thing . 556460_557590
we just deny it flat flat-out deny it . 557640_559710
Vi Strong frankly frankly it's &-uh not only only a
it's totally true . 565190_566070
that's right . 566740_567180
Mitchell's never discussed the goddam case with me right the way he
Mitchell says he's gonna get a part . 572720_573940
and . 573960_574050
well that's Mitchell &-uh not that that's any comfort . 574120_577300
but &-um &-um he says that that &-uh Mitchell has to be aware
and &-uh &-uh that that is certainly adding to his mental
mhm . 605660_606030
well actually all that you've said doesn't particularly change
no <not really> not really . 612380_613820
&-uh except the &-uh it's cumulative in many respects . 614300_617620
well except &-um the Hunt thing . 617850_619100
I I don't know . 619320_619940
I I think I had better let Dean know this in_case he doesn't
(be)cause Hunt is an actor in that aftermath business . 629880_632110
I mean that Dean then would say that he . 633700_635220
well I I don't know if it would change his testimony to anybody
he certainly ought_to be aware that it's happening . 638040_639700
mhm . 640700_640900
now let me ask you to do this . 646090_648220
and you check with Bob on it . 648240_649340
he's sitting right here . 649570_650260
you've gotta figure what will put yourself in Mcgruder and
what are they gonna do . 655590_656430
are they gonna is &-uh is Mitchell gonna sit here . 657700_660580
and &-uh I don't right . 660600_662160
I don't think so . 662680_663030
what do you think do . 663150_664070
come in huh . 664380_665300
I think they'll come into the Us attorney . 665480_666900
I think Magruder is ready . 667860_668660
now come in and confess . 668740_670500
sure . 670710_670940
yeah . 671110_671200
but what are they gonna do if they're gonna piss on the White House
oh <I see> I see . 674000_675140
but you're gonna say I don't think Magruder will I think &-uh Higby
that's not evidence of_course . 685640_686740
is he he'll he'll try and get Dean and str into this . 686760_689460
I think Higby will . 689680_691500
no I mean &-uh Magrid or will . 691640_693220
yeah yeah . 693240_694140
but you see the telephone conversation is not evidence . 694660_696690
John <I understand> I understand but it's a prior inconsistent
and Higby Higg's a witness . 701620_702510
and he refreshes his recollection by a recorded conversation . 702660_706060
mhm which was illegal . 706380_707500
well sure but nevertheless it's &-uh basis for a refreshment . 708060_711170
alright fine . 711280_711830
what does Mitchell say . 712060_712670
what the hell does he do . 712830_713670
he doesn't wanna hurt the President that's for damn sure . 713720_715700
this is a decent man . 715720_716630
well if I were Mitchell I'd get on a plane . 717110_719990
and I'd come down here and ask to see you . 720060_721790
mhm and I'd come in and say . 722570_723900
&-uh well &-uh I've put this meeting off as long as I can . 724020_728020
now now you've gotta know what what happened . 728880_731660
right . 732060_732190
and &-uh right it's up to you as_to what I . 732500_735110
do from here . 735160_735700
mhm . 736140_736510
you see you can be very considerate about a former Attorney general
you know sure that's the point that he's got to realize . 743860_746660
but god damn . 746820_747630
he's any but but he may just decide to stonewall it and fight
we've never went on that . 753380_754030
will I I can't see that he would . 754080_755670
he just he's just with Liddy hand and foot with Liddy cracking . 755860_758700
if Liddy cracks and and Hunt cracks shit . 759430_762230
&-uh but no Hunt's hearsay though . 762700_764100
well he's hearsay on a_lot_of it . 764980_766180
&-um he's not hearsay on Colson and that may be a problem for us .
I really think Colson is deeply &-uh concerned about Hunt don't you
yeah I'm sure he is or did you sense that from your meeting . 775720_778260
he &-um &-uh he had had Hunt talk to Shapiro a long time . 778620_782020
yeah in the day . 782830_783270
yeah . 783510_783640
at that time Hunt was of re frame of mind that he was not going to
but now he is hell he is . 788740_789870
and I think Bitman has brought him around . 790290_791990
Bitman who is Hunt's attorney right . 794540_796220
and &-uh I don't know what's in it for Hunter around . 796830_799010
well what the hell . 799110_799860
he probably figures he isn't gonna get a Presidential pardon .
that's what he gets down to . 801550_802370
let's face it . 802650_803120
and he isn't you know god damn well I can't give him a pardon . 803240_805780
that's right . 806380_806620
they're looking at . 807220_807700
they're looking right in the &-uh and &-uh Colson sort of made all
and he knows damn well we can't come true on (th)em mhm mhm
yep . 818900_818980
don you think that's it . 819500_820140
and Colson isn't here anymore . 820370_821260
and the thing is obviously going a different direction .
then . 823440_823630
so Hunt says . 824650_825090
good god . 825160_825540
let's cut my losses . 825610_826860
Colson probably said . 827140_827980
you know the White House will hard line this thing . 828100_829860
and you don't have a thing to worry about . 829880_831140
yeah . 832340_832430
so Hunt then will &-uh pull the plug . 834770_837300
and &-uh isn't that really Colson's concern that Hunt will pull the
I I he didn't say so . 841640_842910
but I'm sure it is . 843080_843830
mhm . 844240_844420
I'm sure it is . 844540_845070
mhm . 845140_845510
and he's probably doing everything he can to get a line around on
but at the present time for god's sakes . 849820_851670
keep him from talking and know what I mean . 852210_854460
yeah you know by talking I mean I understand tell the truth . 854600_856830
but for Christ's sakes . 857250_857940
I couldn't don't go off on his own . 858500_859460
I couldn't raise that . 859680_860300
other question was Shapiro here . 860320_861950
yeah but I will . 862570_863260
and &-uh the other . 864000_864820
yeah I know I'll talk to him tomorrow . 864960_866300
okay . 866590_866860
alright . 866960_867220
fine . 867400_867510
this concludes the abuse of government power segments for
dash twelve . 881790_882010
