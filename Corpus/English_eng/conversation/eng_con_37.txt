it was something about a man and a store .
shortly around ten o'clock or so, this man was in a store .
I think he was waiting to meet someone that he had known years ago
and the I think it was a hardware store .
I'm not sure .
it used to be an old restaurant where they used to meet .
Joe_Brady's or something like that restaurant where he and this guy
and this policeman who was on patrol at the time had noticed this
and I think this guy said that he was waiting for someone .
or was meeting someone there or whatever .
and there was this guy .
I think his name was Bob that he was waiting to meet .
and they hadn't seen each other for like twenty years or something
and he didn't think the guy was going to show up .
but the guy did show up I believe .
and he found out that I think this guy was wanted by the police .
and I think he was living in New_York .
he was doing okay in New_York .
he asked him how he was doing in New_York .
he was doing okay .
and I think he realized he was wanted by the police or whatever .
but he couldn't turn him in .
so he went .
and got <this plains> this guy in plain clothes, I think, to
that's about as much as I remember .
I went to Bunker_Hill elementary school .
my teacher's name, I think, was Miss_Bradley .
and in that school, it was myself and this guy named James_Brown,
but James used to walk me home from school .
and he would carry my books .
and James had a crush on me .
and I never gave him the time of day .
and lo_and_behold if I had known what I know now back then, I
and he was a a gentleman .
he dressed in a shirt and tie everyday for school .
he was very pleasant .
and then when he came back to Washington DC, he came to visit me at
and lo_and_behold I was in the shower .
and my dad didn't know who he was because James had gotten big .
James was very skinny when he was a a little boy .
and my dad turned him away .
so when I came down I asked my dad .
I said +"/.
+" well, who was that at the door .
he said +"/.
+" some guy named James .
he says +"/.
+" hey, <does that look like> isn't that the guy that's on
I says +"/.
+" yeah .
I said +"/.
+" Dad that's James_Brown .
he says +"/.
+" I thought he looked familiar .
+" you remember the guy who used to carry my books .
he says +"/.
+" yeah .
so I missed him .
but later on we did get together .
and kind_of reflected on our past life .
and enjoyed a moment together .
