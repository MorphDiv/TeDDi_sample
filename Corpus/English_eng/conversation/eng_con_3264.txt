leave them upside down .
I can't believe it .
well .
huh ?
well .
don't say that .
it starts with the bell and ends with the bell .
hmm .
that's the +...
I'll also try to aim that as best as I can .
what about a ruler ?
oh .
it's okay even if you don't have it .
pass it back as it is, upside down, okay ?
what is upside down ?
here .
&=bell .
okay .
now, let's start class .
stand up .
bow .
onegaishimasu .
onegaishimasu .
onegaishimasu .
okay, then please look at your handouts .
okay, then these are the problems we're going to do today .
okay .
um .
it has been one month since Ichiro's mother has entered the hospital .
um .
he has decided say a prayer with his smaller brother at a local temple every morning so that she will be well soon .
um .
there are eightenn ten yen coins in Ichiro's wallet and just twenty two five yen coins in his smaller brother's wallet .
they have decided every time to take one coin from each of them .
and put them in the offertory box, and continue their prayers until either wallet becomes empty .
one day after they were done with their prayers, when they looked into each other's wallets .
the smaller brother's amount of money was greater than Ichiro's .
how many days has it been since they started praying ?
that's the problem .
now, I think there are points that are a little too hard to understand with just these sentences, so .
well, I think I would like to look at a figure and check it .
now, pay attention to the blackboard .
what the ?
okay .
this is Ichiro's wallet, okay ?
um, then +...
okay, over here is the smaller brother's wallet .
and, also there is an offertory box there, right ?
okay ?
okay .
now, first we'll start looking at Ichiro's, okay ?
okay ?
if we look at the wallet there are only ten yen coins in there, right ?
how much is in this in the beginning ?
all together .
how much is in it ?
one hundred eighty yen .
one hundred eighty yen .
yes .
okay .
the amount of money, well, in the beginning .
okay .
compared to the smaller brother's .
there are only five yen coins in it, but how much is in it ?
one hundred and ten yen .
one hundred and ten yen .
yes .
one hundred and ten yen .
this means in the beginning stages, um, Ichiro has more, okay ?
in terms of the amount of money, he has more, right ?
then, um, after this .
okay ?
every morning from each wallet they take out one coin from each, okay ?
they put them in this offertory box, right ?
now, first day one .
okay .
ten yen from Ichiro's wallet um, wallet and five yen from over here .
okay ?
now, it goes in from here and in this offertory box .
wow .
that's great .
that's amazing .
okay .
it's gets stowed away in here, okay ?
is it okay ?
they're in there .
yes .
okay, then how about it at this stage ?
comparing Ichiro's and his smaller brother's wallet .
the contents of the wallet .
which one has more in terms of the amount of money ?
the older brother .
hmm .
ichiro .
ichiro .
yes .
ichiro has more, right ?
okay, then second day .
okay .
of course right ?
they put in the coins in here .
how about it in this stage ?
ichiro .
ichiro .
hmm .
ichiro still has more, huh ?
okay ?
now, the fact is they continued things like this every day, okay ?
but, in the morning of some day, okay ?
um .
they looked inside of each other's wallets, right ?
then the smaller brother had more in the amount of money .
now, that one day was how many days, um, since they started their praying ?
now I would like for everybody to think about that .
then, um, in the open space .
well this part we'll be writing in later on, so writing anywhere other than here is fine so, um, okay ?
you may want to take notes or anything else you want to do is fine, so please try doing it .
where are we going to write it ?
hm .
next to it is okay .
okay ?
masa .
you did it up to the second day, right ?
then, on the third day who has more ?
this one has more ?
then, how about the fourth day ?
if you keep on doing it like that ?
okay ?
that's good .
now, just now see ?
you did it up to the second day, right ?
then, how about the third day ?
how about it ?
in the same manner try thinking, like how about the fourth day ?
do it the same way over here, okay ?
well see ?
up to the second day this one has mor(e) had more, right ?
then, on the third day who had more ?
okay ?
how much will it be ?
well, if it's the third day, where is how much ?
okay ?
do it like that then decide the answer, okay ?
oh .
is this one hundred and eighty yen ?
right ?
oh .
have you already solved at least one ?
okay .
up to &~wh where have you thought about it ?
uh, somewhat .
hm .
what do you mean ?
did you erase this ?
yes .
I erased that .
hm .
you erased the first day okay .
then, how about the second day ?
I did this like this and +...
hm .
the tens .
then, try putting in the dates there .
okay .
okay .
okay ?
how did you obtain this ?
I counted all the way .
oh .
you counted it all the way ?
hm +...
now, well +...
is there any method to find it that's simpler ?
can you please find that .
have you found it ?
then, now it was quite tedious to write these out, right ?
is there any method to find it faster ?
okay ?
can you please find that ?
now, this is also one of the methods, right ?
then, it's tedious to count these, right ?
is there any method to find the answer faster ?
please think about it .
now, if you have found the answer using one method, okay, aren't there any other methods ?
okay ?
oh, now it's okay .
you can leave that .
oh .
then +...
without using this Y +...
it seems you can do it just with this and this, right ?
yes .
then, quickly, okay ?
put the symbols down on this, okay ?
on these, okay ?
huh ?
can you stop for a moment ?
what is this Y ?
this ?
this one hundred and eighty minus ten X is +...
whose money is this ?
that is ?
ichiro .
yes .
it's Ichiro's +...
right ?
then how about the smaller brother ?
see ?
how much is in that, hum ?
hm .
oh .
if you do that then ?
um ?
now, well, you can find it like that also, but can you try thinking about whether there are any methods that you can use to find it faster ?
this person, this is +...
ichiro's, right ?
oh .
this is the smaller brother's, right ?
then it seems you can do it by using this, okay ?
oh .
you got it up to here ?
okay .
this .
it was obtained as how many days ?
oh .
it was on the twelfth day, right ?
then, can you do it a little more ?
okay ?
then if you try combining this and this then you can make a mathematical expression .
okay ?
was it something like a mathematical expression ?
hmm .
then, this okay ?
can you do it without using the Y ?
okay ?
oh .
you combined them, right ?
whose amount of money is this ?
are you talking about this ?
yes .
hm .
hm .
this is +...
hm .
well, one hundred and forty yen .
hm +...
then, how about over here ?
over here is also ninety yen .
and, how did you obtain this ?
this value ?
uh well .
hm .
you minus ten yen every single day and +...
yes .
over here every single day +...
yes .
you minus five yen .
oh .
that's right, huh ?
and you obtained this from the table, right ?
yes .
then, can't this be found by calculation ?
hmm .
oh .
you formed a simultaneous equation, right ?
okay .
well then .
this okay ?
can you try thinking if it will be found by formulating a mathematical expression ?
okay ?
then, this one also, can you try thinking if it can be found by formulating a mathematical expression ?
okay ?
oh .
you made a mathematical expression like this, huh ?
okay .
oh .
the fact is you've counted all the way, right ?
okay .
then, okay ?
also, okay ?
after this I'll have you come up again and present, okay ?
okay ?
this problem .
since we can't write it in and erase it also, so that means would you fill it in here one by one ?
okay ?
no .
don't say that .
I'm counting on you .
okay ?
you went on solving this ?
okay .
then you did this by making x equal one .
okay .
then, okay ?
well, later on I'm going to have you present this part .
okay ?
hm .
hm .
then, okay ?
ando, okay ?
this part, okay ?
would you come up to present it later on ?
here and also one more .
up to here .
would you write just this part and also this part ?
the rest is okay with dot, dot, dot .
since it's troublesome to write all of this .
okay ?
and also .
now, okay ?
I want Bunmei to .
umm, is it over here ?
would you present this part ?
am I going to write it ?
yes .
please write it .
okay ?
that you thought of it like this, okay ?
then, okay ?
I want Choshi to present okay ?
um, this expression, okay ?
I'm going to have you present it later on .
so +...
this this what do you call this ?
hm .
this is smaller than .
what ?
smaller than .
smaller than .
hm .
then, please think beforehand why you formulated a mathematical expression like this .
okay .
then, um, would you look up please .
now .
when I looked around a little just now, well there were people who did it with different solving techniques .
okay ?
umm .
well it seems there were even people who found two or three techniques by themselves, huh ?
now, the fact is to show there are methods like these, um, I think I would like some people +...
okay ?
to present them, okay ?
then, Daishi .
well, please come up .
okay .
xxx .
yes .
you were saying how you would do it for yourself, right ?
will you do it ?
ha ha .
I guess I'll do it .
please .
ha ha .
ha ha .
what am I supposed to do ?
how would you do it ?
so before .
see ?
I put them in, right ?
yes .
and you keep on putting them in .
okay .
that's good .
okay .
it's a lot faster if we put in many at a time .
xxx .
xxx is more cool .
hmm .
there's a lot of ten yen coins, huh ?
then, last the five yen coins go in .
they're sticking out .
xxx huh ?
one, two, three, four, five, six .
five, eight, two .
well +...
huh ?
about this much .
hum .
about this much ?
hmm .
about this much this time it fell .
hmm .
teacher .
and, please say it, okay ?
no .
by the way, what day is this ?
umm .
the fifteenth day .
okay .
how is it ?
it's okay .
it's okay .
now .
just now .
umm, for Daishi's method, okay ?
okay .
while actually putting these in, okay ?
there were other people that kept drawing lines like this, and solved the problem that way .
doing it like that well the answer is the fifteenth day +...
they obtained it like that, okay ?
then, people who also did it with this method themselves or who also tried doing this method .
then, well would you raise your hands ?
okay, then you can lower them .
then, continuing .
um .
is it Etsumi ?
then, would you write it around here ?
in the top part .
okay .
then .
okay .
over here .
around here .
around this side, okay ?
around here .
okay .
then can you say your method of thought and also, um, how many days was it since they started .
okay .
umm .
since the fact is they put in the offertory box +...
one coin each of money in one day so +...
if we do it in an orderly fashion +...
the number of days and also the money left over, one by one +...
on the fifteenth day the smaller brother has more .
okay .
that means the answer is ?
the fifteenth day .
yes .
the fifteenth day .
okay .
that's good .
okay, then in this case, uh, he did it for us by using a graph, right ?
0 .
then, it doesn't matter if you drew lines or not, but people who wrote it this way raise your hands .
okay .
then, you can lower your hands .
okay ?
okay .
then, continuing, um, Bunmei .
okay ?
then, would you write it around here ?
that part I asked you to, okay ?
yes .
go ahead .
my handwriting is not neat .
okay .
then please explain it .
well, in the beginning .
well, Ichiro had one hundred and eighty yen, and the smaller brother had one hundred and ten yen .
and since there is a difference of seventy yen .
and since the difference between them becomes smaller by five yen each day, so it's seventy divided by ten minus five .
and since by the fourteenth day it becomes exactly the same amount of money .
so since on the day after that there will be a difference, so fourteen plus one is fifteen and it's the fifteenth day .
okay .
okay ?
um .
in the beginning .
he just now said it .
there is a difference of seventy yen, right ?
in this expression that becomes sixty five yen .
then sixty yen .
right ?
since it becomes smaller .
0 .
by five yen okay ?
so he obtained it by noticing this, okay ?
are there people who also tried it using this method ?
huh ?
one person .
two people .
just two people ?
okay .
that's good .
okay, then continuing, um, Fujita .
okay .
then, would you write it around here ?
okay ?
it's okay to not write all the lines of the mathematical expression .
oh .
that .
okay .
is it okay with this ?
yes .
yes .
and, if you can write the amount for X .
oh .
yes .
and, the answer .
okay .
and, after I've written the answer of X and Y ?
that's right, huh ?
okay .
okay .
okay .
please say +...
now .
one hundred .
in the beginning, Ichiro had one hundred and eighty yen, and since he takes out ten yen every day +...
and we have X as the num(ber) number of days and if we make the amount of money left Y +...
then it becomes the mathematical expression Y equals one hundred and eighty minus ten X .
and the smaller brother has one hundred and ten yen every day .
oh .
he has one hundred and ten yen .
and since he takes out five yen every day it becomes the mathematical expression Y equals one hundred and ten minus five X .
and when they become of the same amount of money and +...
and X and Y becomes fourteen and forty .
and on the fourteenth day they become the same amount of money .
and the fourteenth day is the same amount of money .
and the next day since Ichiro puts in ten yen and the smaller brother puts in five yen, so there's a difference .
the amount of money put in is smaller for &~Ic Ichiro .
oh .
it's bigger so +...
the next day Ichiro +...
ichiro's amount of money left is less so it becomes the fifteenth day .
okay .
okay, it's good .
okay ?
okay .
she did it using letters, and this one we call X, okay ?
um, the day it becomes equal, okay ?
the same amount of money .
she thought about this fact, okay ?
0 .
well, she put in Y as the amount inside of the wallet for that day, right ?
or some people did it without using the Y, okay ?
it seems there were people who wrote this equals this like this .
okay ?
then, well, simultaneous equations like this or an equation with just X, okay ?
people who have tried doing it using things like these ?
can you raise your hands a little ?
okay .
that's fine .
okay .
that's good .
and, also of course they are using letters, but there were some people who formed mathematical expressions a little differently .
then, the fact about that mathematical expression .
choshi .
then, in the beginning, well, would you present just the mathematical expression right there ?
ah .
ah .
right there is fine .
go ahead .
smaller .
smaller .
what came after that ?
it's okay .
okay .
now, how to say it is a little difficult .
okay ?
smaller than .
0 .
one hundred eighty minus +/.
yes .
+, ten X +...
smaller than +/.
yes .
+, one hundred ten minus five X .
yes .
then, well, can you say why you got a mathematical expression like this ?
um .
the one labeled X is that one day after they finished their prayers and +/.
yes .
+, and on that day since the smaller brother's amount of money is &~bigg oh was bigger than his big brother .
well Ichiro's so in short, well, &~Ich &~Ic who had one hundred and eighty yen .
huh ?
ichiro is one second in short +...
in short the difference in the amounts of money on that one day +/.
yes .
the fact is the smaller brother's amount of money is more than Ichiro's and +/.
yes .
+, and the person who had one hundred and ten yen is the amount of money the smaller brother had in the beginning .
so the smaller brother's is bigger, and &~Kazu oh Ichiro's is smaller .
okay .
okay .
that's okay .
okay ?
okay, then just before, okay ?
there were some people who formed equations or simultaneous equations .
so just now there were some people who just wrote some equations .
but how this X is placed is a little different, right ?
okay .
then, is there anybody who says they also formed equations like this ?
um, in the last situation you placed X as the day when it becomes the same amount of money .
okay .
compared to what he just said now, okay ?
um +...
the day the smaller brother's is bigger is X days later .
okay .
then, is there anybody who says they also formed equations like this ?
okay, so two people, right ?
so these kinds of expressions +...
the fact is these are the ones we're going to use from now on, okay ?
equations that use symbols like this +...
umm, we'll call them inequalities .
0 .
then, um, right around here on the handout, okay ?
in the box +/.
um, this part .
the part around here, okay ?
then, the mathematical expression where the wavy lines are drawn .
then, um, please try writing these in .
okay .
you don't have to write the others .
just here is fine .
okay ?
okay .
then, would you look up again ?
if there are parts you haven't written you will have time to fill it in later, okay .
pay attention this way .
is it okay with people who are looking down ?
is it okay ?
then +...
um, actually in Choshi's situation he has already obtained things after this by calculating .
but I think there are lot of people who saw this today for the first time, okay ?
so today I think we would like to find the value for X that holds true for this mathematical expression while actually putting in numbers .
okay ?
um .
for this .
please write this later .
okay ?
um .
the value of X .
then, um, the value of left side .
then, um, the value of right side .
and, when we put in a number for X, which is bigger the left side or the right side ?
0 .
okay ?
I think we would like to investigate that .
now even if we're to actually put in numbers, well, we don't know starting from what number we should put &~i +...
start at right ?
it's okay if we put in continuously starting from one .
but since we'd have to write a lot of calculations that's troublesome .
um, so well, if we look at the solution method from before, it seems we're getting fifteen .
so I think we would like to see a little with numbers in the vicinity of fifteen .
then, since we are using the vicinity of fifteen, so ones before that are fourteen, thirteen .
then, ones after that are sixteen, seventeen, okay ?
then, I think we would like to investigate up to around eighteen .
then +...
okay ?
the left side, okay ?
when we substituted thirteen into this X +...
okay ?
one hundred eighty minus ten times thirteen .
okay .
everybody .
how much will this be ?
fifty .
fifty .
yes .
okay .
compared to that the right side is one hundred and ten minus five times .
in this X if we still put in thirteen +...
how much is this ?
forty five .
yes .
forty five .
that means in this situation, the values of the left side and the right side, which is greater ?
the left side .
yes .
the left side is greater, right ?
that means since this side is greater, if we ask about the size relationship, okay ?
the greater than symbol goes in, right ?
that means, can we say that putting in thirteen for X holds true for this inequality ?
we can't say it .
we can't say it .
yes .
well, the direction is different, right ?
that means, since we can't say it when it's this, it's wrong .
because of the fact that we can't say it, okay ?
I think I would like to put marks .
then, doing it in the same way if we put in fourteen +...
if we put in fourteen over here also how much will they be ?
and, how would the size relationship be ?
how about it when it's fifteen ?
now, with that, okay ?
I think I would like for you to do up to here .
and, if you find a situation when you can say it is true please try putting circle marks .
then, would you do it up to there ?
what goes in ?
when they're the same ?
that's right, huh ?
then, how about over here ?
see ?
you put a mark here, right ?
if you couldn't say, it's the wrong mark X .
are they the same ?
since they're not the same, do you understand ?
that's right, huh ?
you put a wrong mark, right ?
yes .
please put marks also over here, okay ?
then, please put marks here, okay ?
when you can say it is true, put the right mark .
when you can't say it is true, put the wrong mark, okay ?
you're already done writing ?
then, now I'm sorry but would you go up front and write this ?
okay ?
this place .
you can bring up this handout .
okay ?
okay then .
how about you, did you finish them all ?
are you still in the middle ?
how about this ?
which is it ?
is it the wrong mark or the right mark ?
how about it ?
it's greater if over here is greater, okay ?
it holds true, okay ?
how about it ?
when you &~com compare them .
it's greater .
that means, what is this ?
people who are done writing, okay ?
look at Goda's and would you compare it with yours to see if it's the same or not, okay ?
oh .
th +...
here, okay ?
the right mark or the wrong mark, okay ?
have it written, okay ?
okay, then up to here is okay .
okay ?
try putting marks here .
okay ?
doing it like that, okay ?
then .
okay .
it's good .
okay .
okay .
thank you .
okay, then please look in the direction of the blackboard .
okay ?
how about it ?
well, would the people who had theirs the same as this raise your hands ?
okay .
then, please lower your hands .
that means, well if we look at the symbols over here, an X that holds true for this mathematical expression is .
these four fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, right ?
if we look exactly at the relationship of the size, the first one was greater than, but the next one is equals .
the next ones are all smaller than, right ?
that means it changed here, right ?
that means what can we say about the kind of numbers for X that will make this mathematical expression work .
based on fourteen .
numbers that are what than fourteen ?
greater .
uh huh .
numbers greater than .
okay ?
huh ?
okay .
the values of X that hold true for this mathematical expression, um, like this .
okay ?
we call this value +...
um, I think it came up before but, um, we call it +...
the solution, um, of the inequality .
when we were doing equations, we said to solve for X that will make expressions like these work, right ?
um .
we will think about inequalities in the same way .
well would you not write it yet ?
okay ?
then +...
it's about the answer to this problem, but +...
um, if we look at the things written before, all of them are on the fifteenth day .
but the answer, that one day, is it just the fifteenth day ?
from fifteen .
then, will somebody say it for me ?
is it like this ?
then, just now, well, Higashi said it for me, but well would you say it for me ?
hm .
it's from the fifteenth day up to the &~eightee eighteenth day .
hm .
it includes up to .
how about the nineteenth day ?
it's not included .
why ?
since Ichiro's wallet becomes empty and +/.
yes .
+, at that time they'll end it .
yes .
yes .
since if it's the nineteenth day, there isn't any more, right ?
money, right ?
that means, like it was said just now, it's not just the fifteenth day .
but that one we call one day is of course the fifteenth day but it might've been on the sixteenth day, right ?
the day they looked accidentally was sixteenth day or the seventeenth or the eighteenth day +...
of these +...
well it was one of these days, right ?
okay .
then please write in this part, okay ?
at the bottom of the handout .
then, would you pass it to the back ?
then, would you pass it back while doing that .
oh .
was there one extra paper ?
well, one paper .
oh .
it's passed back .
well, will there be one paper extra ?
one paper will be left .
okay .
okay, then are most of you done ?
then, the small handout that was passed out just now .
please look at that .
is it okay ?
then, I will try reading it, okay ?
umm .
the prayer was answered and, um, their mother was able to leave the hospital safely and +...
um, that night they gave a toast with juice .
um, currently there are fifty milliliters of juice in Ichiro's cup, and eighty milliliters in the smaller brother's cup .
when the mother poured juice into Ichiro's cup it made Ichiro's amount become greater .
the question is how many milliliters had she poured ?
form an inequality and think about it .
it's a problem like this, okay ?
okay, then like before, I would like for you to look at the figure .
okay, then okay ?
since the fact is the mother, okay ?
feels better so, um, that night, um, they gave a toast, right ?
and, the smaller brother drank a little but Ichiro drank deeply, okay ?
so it's greatly decreased right ?
hm .
now, then the mother, um, after this +...
okay ?
since he had less, she poured some for him, okay ?
the juice, okay ?
now, then since it would be poured rapidly, the amount of juice increases like this, right ?
wow .
okay .
if she did it like that +...
when they looked, the fact is that Ichiro's amount become more than the smaller brother's .
then, the problem is about how much did she pour in, okay ?
take this .
an inequality, okay ?
form an inequality like this, then we want to think it from there .
then, for that, okay ?
in this situation what should we place as X ?
somebody ?
what should we place as X ?
well, is it hard to say it in words ?
or it's also okay with you saying it's here .
okay .
then, Choshi .
okay .
yes .
for Ichiro +/.
yes .
+, to pour more than the smaller brother's .
the amount needed for that .
yes .
the amount needed .
then, did you understand that one just now ?
I don't understand .
then, would you point with your finger ?
&=laughs .
huh ?
come up front and l Okay .
where is it ?
in short, here is fifty milliliters so +...
yes .
yes .
let's have it so we need up to eighty milliliters and up to here .
yes .
up to here .
yes .
that amount I think we should make X .
yes .
okay, if we do that, it's when they become the same, right ?
yes .
what else ?
then if we think like that, did it became more ?
when we're asked how about when it's equal, okay ?
we could think things like this, but we can get a viewpoint of it becoming more, right ?
when it's an inequality, okay ?
when it's that +...
when we exactly +...
go from this situation +...
what part is it ?
what do we want to obtain ?
in this situation .
the increased amount .
yes .
the increased amount, right ?
so, um, about the inequality, if you &~thi if it's an equation we can also do it exactly here, okay ?
or if you thought about forming an inequality just like that, it may be okay if you place this as X .
okay .
then, write in X milliliters in the figure and this relationship, okay ?
using symbols like this, please try expressing it .
well, just the mathematical expression is okay .
well, among some of you there are people who made tables and are about to put in numbers .
okay .
please try writing X here .
that X is milliliters, okay ?
okay .
hm, so all you have to do is make a mathematical expression that says this here is greater than this .
since all you have to do is make a mathematical expression that says this here is great than this .
how much was the total here ?
huh ?
it's fifty plus X, right ?
how about over here ?
eighty .
eighty .
and, which is more ?
over here .
over here ?
so for that +...
all you have to do is use that symbol, right ?
ah .
okay .
okay .
now .
we don't have much time so, well I'm sorry, but okay then .
let's have somebody say the mathematical expression .
okay .
anybody who wants to say it becomes a mathematical expression like this .
huh ?
how to say it is this .
all you have to do is use this .
okay ?
mostly, everybody seemed to be able to do it .
okay, then .
izumi .
would you try saying it ?
yes .
fifty plus X +...
yes .
bigger than +...
hm ?
which ?
bigger than +...
bigger than .
okay .
greater than .
okay .
eighty .
okay .
&=bell .
okay .
people who can say they also got equations like this ?
okay .
now, you may lower your hands .
then +...
this mathematical expression's +...
um, the solution .
meaning the values of X that hold true for this mathematical expression .
if we say that, what kind of numbers can we say they are ?
somebody ?
how about it ?
if we talk about values of X that hold true for this mathematical expression .
okay .
then, Fujita .
go ahead .
more than +/.
yes .
+, thirty .
yes .
more than thirty .
well, if we have it in numbers, numbers more than, okay ?
thirty .
now, since the fact is if we ask what kind of numbers are more than thirty, well I think I would draw a number line .
now, we will write it later, so would you look this way .
okay .
then, have zero around here and, okay ?
we'll have thirty around here, okay ?
then just now, um, she said numbers more than thirty for us, but then, for example, what number should we think about it ?
if we ask about numbers more than thirty .
concretely .
xxx .
fifty .
fifty .
yes .
there is one like fifty, right ?
then, if we say one between these ?
thirty point one .
forty .
oh .
it's thirty point one ?
ahh .
after that ?
anything else ?
thirty .
thirty point one .
thirty point ?
one one .
&=laughs .
one one .
oh .
thirty point one one .
anything else ?
forty .
thirty point one one one .
forty .
okay ?
now, incidentally, um, just now we got one, two, three, four four numbers that are more than thirty .
but about how many are there ?
infinite .
infinite .
yes .
there is an infinite amount .
okay ?
meaning thirty .
is thirty included or not included ?
it's included .
it's not included .
yes .
it's not included, but if it comes over here even a little like thirty point one, the fact is it becomes more than thirty, right ?
that means all the drawn parts here are included .
if we say that, if we ask what the answer is +...
okay ?
if we use this compared to thirty milliliters, right ?
amounts more than that .
okay ?
it becomes like this, right ?
then, um, time has run out, okay ?
after the ending bow is finished, well, I think I would like you to write it .
then, for now we'll end .
stand up .
bow .
thank you very much .
okay .
teacher .
do we copy everything from here ?
oh .
you don't have to copy it .
well, just this part is fine .
I want you to know that there are ways of thinking like this, okay
