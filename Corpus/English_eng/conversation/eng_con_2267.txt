Your dreams, or do you forget to write them down ? 177172_179084
I forget to write them down . 179084_179660
I generally remember them for at least a few hours or more . 179660_182139

You had trouble learning how to walk when you were younger ? 186848_189077

I don't think I had trouble learning how to walk . 192792_194028
Oh, I don't know how to skip properly . 194028_195264
I thought you did . 195264_196900
No, I only know the wizard of Oz skip . 196900_197300
What's the differnece ? 197300_199396

I've never noticed that . 204908_206394
Is that what they do in the movie or is that just what it's called ?
yeah . 209073_209549
That's what they do in the movie . 209549_210275

People used to make fun of it . 215660_217412
I think I learned how to skip in like third grade . 217412_221294
It was +... 221294_221870
It was quite embarrassing . 221870_224676
That's ok . 224676_226063
You should try attempting to learn how to skip in highschool . 226063_228725
But you can't skip now, or can you ? 228725_231021
I can still do the wizard of Oz skip . 231021_232607
Can you skip normally ? 232607_233576
Ummm . 233576_234752
no . 234752_235905
Do you want to ? 235905_236731
Learn how to skip normally ? 236731_238217
I don't really care, there's not much use for it that I've found . 238217_241339
Ok . 241339_242349
That's fine . 242349_243402
I suppose . 243402_244411

So, how's Mat_Sci going ? 247861_249613
Good . 249613_251016
Umm, We learn about materials and the science and engineering
Isn't that interesting ? 256050_257127
Just like the title ? 257127_258013
I'm probably taking intro to +... 258013_260242
We're doing the ring casting lab soon . 260242_263714
Yeah, you told me that . 263714_264951
That's really cool . 264951_265610
I hope so . 265610_266620
What is it, bronze, from the bronze you had before ? 266620_269509
Was that bronze, or was it +... 269509_270252
Ehhh, brass, I think, bronze, something like that . 270252_273967
Brass is the shiny one, and bronze is the hard one, I think . 273967_276262
It was a long time ago, at least a month and a half . 276262_280637
Oh, but so you're not casting it from the same stuff ? 280637_282473
No, we're casting it out of silver . 282473_283543
I don't know if we're actually going to alloy the silver ourselves;
It might be a good idea before I actually go to lab . 288494_292133
Yeah, so, how does one do this, or, how does one do this ? 292133_297894
Casting ? 297894_299130
I mean, do you, is there a ring mold that you +... 299130_301525
Ah, yeah, there's many different ways to cast things . 301525_306994
I don't know how we're doing it . 306994_309383
I think we're using a hard mold . 309383_310126
I don't know that that means . 310126_311762
Yeah, well there's also casting with like stuff like green sand and

Sultry ? 322674_323901
Oh, yeah . 323901_324970

I was dizzy earlier . 326723_327699
That's kinda like sultry, only not . 327699_328868
Yeah, yeah, same motion of the eyes, I suppose . 328868_331247
Are you sleepy ? 331247_333743
I'm very sleepy . 333743_334812
Are you hungry ? 334812_335555
I'm not that hungry: I ate earlier . 335555_337308
Well, that's good . 337308_338694
That's why I ate . 338694_339620
because I was dizzy . 339620_340590
And then I became less dizzy, but it took me a while . 340590_342243
So, I'm uh, hoping I don't have mono, like, uh, everybody else . 342243_346685
Except for Ed . 346685_348847
Yeah . 348847_350666
Even though his girlfriend has mono, he has no mono . 350666_352236
Um . 352236_354958
Let's talk about star constellations . 354958_357353
Do you know anything about star constellations ? 357353_359892
I can recognize some, I . 359892_361546
Let me guess, Orion's belt ? 361546_363215
I can recognize Orion, and, let's see, Orion and Taurus and
But I don't remember what it is . 373200_374770
It's generally the stuff that is overhead in my town, hometown
I see . 378818_380138
I'm not good at recognizing star constellations . 380138_382517
But I am good at using telescopes . 382517_385239
Are you ? 385239_385832
mhm . 385832_386299
Which has nothing to do with star constellations . 386299_387635
No, no, it really doesn't . 387635_389531
mm mm But most people are better at that than telescopes . 389531_393512
Um, well, how much skill is there involved in using a telescope ? 393512_398204
Is there ? 398204_398880
I don't know . 398880_399524
It's been a while . 399524_400617
Depends on the telescope . 400617_401503
Yeah, that's true . 401503_402496
I know how to use several different kinds . 402496_403256
