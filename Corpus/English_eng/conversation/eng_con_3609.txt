one night a boy and his two pets the dog and the frog were sitting
when the boy finally gotta sleep when he was sleeping the rabbit
he woke up the next morning only to find that his rabbit had gone
I mean &-um frog his frog .
he got all dressed up .
but his dog got his head stuck in Brandon's jar .
so they started looking for the frog .
and by accident the dog fell off out_of the window .
and the jar cracked .
they got him out_of it .
but the boy was kind of annoyed some .
he made a mistake by calling for his frog near a bee hive .
and his dog playfully attacked it while he looked in a hole .
a gopher came out while the dog tormented the bees .
<but it> but it finally fell down .
and the bees got extremely ticked off .
extremely ticked off ?
so the boy looked more into the tree .
but was startled by the dog and fell over .
the pesty bees went away from his dog .
they found out they'd stung him enough .
they had their fun .
so he looks behind a rock not knowing .
he leans over a branch not knowing that it's a moose .
the moose carries him <off the cliff> onto a cliff .
and he added the brakes .
so him and his dog tumble down into the water .
his dog went on top of moose .
he was dry .
and he quieted down his dog as they climbed over a log .
and they found his &-um frog and another frog .
he was pretty surprised .
so &-um he took <one of the> &-um one of the baby frogs the
good story .
you did a really good job Brandon .
one night <he> a boy and his two pets were sitting in their
and how does the boy feel ?
the boy felt kind of tired .
<so> and the dog felt suspicious .
and so the boy went to sleep .
and the dog curled up <on him> on him .
but little did they know this frog knew how to walk and wandered
in the morning they both woke up to discover that their tiny green
how did the boy feel ?
<the> the boy was kind of sad .
and so was the dog .
so the boy had looked all through his cloth-s and everything and
his dog got his head stuck in the jar while looking around .
the boy then opened up the window calling out his frog's name while
to the dog's point of view it was like the world was ending .
the boy then saw that his dog had fallen off of the window sill .
and he cracked the jar on the ground .
he leaped down angry at his pet .
and he had smashed the jar .
the dog started licking him .
but xxx that he did something wrong .
meanwhile <while his> while the boy was calling the frog's
underestimating the power of the bees he looked up and playfully
a gopher came up and bit his nose .
in pain the boy screamed while the dog tried to get up the tree .
so is that why he has his hands on his nose ?
yeah .
finally the bee's nest came loose and crashed to the ground .
the bees were pouring out at the dog .
the dog whimpering tried to get up the tree but couldn't while the
the boy peered into a tree and found nothing .
hm was the boy saying anything ?
it doesn't look like it .
okay .
the dog screaming because the bees were following him ran over the
the owl then flew away .
but the boy is still <rubbing> rubbing the &-um hit on his head
little did he know a moose was standing behind the rock .
he leaned up on the moose not knowing that it was big .
and the dog sniffed out the place .
was the boy saying anything up there ?
&-um yeah he was calling xxx .
<the moose> he then <fell over the moose> stumbled over
and the moose carried him off to a <far cliff> faraway cliff .
I wonder how he feels up there ?
scared .
scared yeah .
I'll bet .
well &-um stampeding towards the cliff the moose used his air
and all together the boy flew off of the cliff all with his dog .
he &-um scared and fell into the water head first .
he then got up unharmed with his dog panicking over his head .
and I wonder why he is holding his hand up to his ear ?
oh to listen if it's xxx .
the boy listening to the &-um log told his dog to quiet down while
he then found his frog and another frog sitting beside the &-um log
<their baby> &-um the boy was surprised not knowing that his
and his frog allowed him to take home one of their babies .
saying goodbye to the frogs he left the swamp
