where's to drive ?
why you wave ?
what's the noise ?
why ?
honk horns .
some ducks ; some fish ; some dogs Mommy ; some people .
big telephone .
stuck .
that's not a microphone .
I don't wanna take a rest .
look it decorations , Daddy .
to growing up ; some presents .
it's tangled .
what the sign say ; up on the wall ?
on my plate
