it's about these two buddies .
they hadn't seen one another for over twenty years .
and they met on this particular corner where this restaurant used to
and they agreed to meet twenty years from that point in time between
so the policeman had came by and seen the other guy .
I think it was Jimmy waiting on Bob .
and the policeman most naturally he wanted to see what was happening .
so the guy was telling him what he was doing on the corner .
he was waiting on his friend Bob who he hadn't seen in a long time .
so the policeman was going to move on .
and he told him +"/.
+" I hope you have luck on finding this guy that was coming by .
so the guy suddenly came up .
and they started talking to one another .
and they started trying to find out about what happened twenty years
anyway I think it was Bob that got hip that wasn't Jimmy .
I think that's how it goes .
and he was saying something about a Roman or a pug nose .
he was looking different .
and what had happened .
Jimmy became a policeman and knew there was a warrant out for Bob's
so he couldn't come himself .
because he would feel too embarrassed to arrest a friend after they
and the restaurant was no longer there too .
so he took him somewhere else to eat .
but then the guy was telling him +"/.
+" would you go quietly ?
+" because we heard that you was coming to Chicago .
so he went on to arrest him .
and he gave him a note .
and Jimmy was explaining that +"/.
+" yeah I knew it was you the moment I seen you when you lit the
+" but I didn't have the heart to arrest you because we're buddies .
so I sent somebody else in my place .
that's where the difference between the Roman nose and the pug nose
I was in first grade .
and Miss_Wilkerson +...
that was the first grade teacher's name .
anyway me and the other kids we was horseplaying .
and so she had so many books in her hand .
and she was coming down the steps .
and I think she missed a little flight and all .
and my laughter was so pronounced .
she could pick mine out from a thousand other people .
well everybody else was laughing .
I wasn't the only one laughing when she slipped and fell .
and the books came out of her hands .
and I laughed I guess so loud .
I guess my laugh was just so distinct .
so anyway she started getting up mad .
and this guy named Leroy .
this little boy named Leroy .
she told Leroy to help her pick up her books and everything .
and she looked at me and called my parents to the school .
just singled me out from everybody .
I guess I had the most contagious laugh to make everybody else laugh .
so anyway one thing led to another .
and she failed me for that year too for laughing and being so loud .
