ok, what we need to do is once you get to the page, it's one
topic, graphing, frequency distribution xxx . 44585_50248
that's what we're gonna go over today . 50248_52238
that, that's what you read, right ? 52238_53606
good ! 53606_54623
that's a great way to start . 54623_56151
uh, when you were reading through, and while you're been sitting
okay, have you had statistics ? 64663_67158
so that kinda helps, right ? 67158_68926
uh, what we'll need to do is we need to kinda go through the forty
the four pages ? 75701_76830
yeah, the four pages xxx . 76830_78293
so, um, we'll go through slowly, and I'll provide some problems for
ok ? 92726_93610
xxx um, the first paragraph on page one hundred and thirty, well,
ok, why don't you tell me what they are ? 114133_116275
describe data in metrics ? 116275_118355
ok, why do you think it's important, if you're a scientist, to be
so other people can understand it . 125075_127595
ok . 127595_128435
ok, it's just important these things because if you're asked a
knowledge, or some sort of demonstration . 149426_151776
ok, um, why would you want to make inferences ? 151776_156016
so you can xxx . 156016_159696
ok . 159696_161701
um, what they're talking about, um, say a set of data, you've done
um, typically, would you say you're describing a population or a
I'd say a sample . 177083_179283
ok . 179283_179851
what's the difference between a sample and a population ? 179851_182866
well, a population is everybody, a sample is just, uh, a group of
ok, say I did a study, and, uh, I'm talking about third grade
uh, everybody in the third grade, I mean . 201405_206563
yeah, say, say you were writing out a sentence and you were
you'd choose any kind of sample you want that relates to your
just like xxx . 216123_221963
ok, but it's real important, um, just like, uh, last week you were
specific, yeah, describe the sample . 230155_230943
oh, Ok . 230943_232120
you want to be specific . 232120_233080
um, from, from, third, from third grade ? 233080_239646
uh, can you say that again ? 239646_244886
ok, um, well, what I'm getting at is if you were gonna describe a
ok, that's a sample . 255901_258358
but if you say all third grade children, that's a global thing, and
so, it's real important in science to +/. 264245_267813
be specific . 267813_268390
be specific . 268390_269470
as opposed to third grade kids . 269470_271821
well, what third grade kids, are you talking about private schools ?
are you talking about public schools ? 274405_275380
are we talking about, you know, Ok, the South or in the North ? 275380_278765
so it's really important to be specific when you're dealing with
ok, so population of third graders could be all the third graders
but it also could be all the third graders in the world . 291891_294268
it's just a difference in scope . 294268_296755
ok ? 296755_298140
&=mumbles . 298140_299426
it's probably you . 299426_301786
it's, there's not a lot of air circulation . 301786_304098
&=laughs . 304098_305068
but anyway . 305068_305691
so we're clear on the difference between sample and population ? 305691_307555
yeah . 307555_308978
ok . 308978_309546
now, if uh, you're a scientist and you're concerned about, uh,
you can use either descriptive statistics or inferential
one or the other . 326576_327905
which would you choose ? 327905_330388
inferential . 330388_331923
why ? 331923_333123
well, it depends on what kind of experiment you're doing . 333123_335595
um, if you need to predict behavior, then you have to use
and descriptive would be for, so the audience so xxx understand . 339578_353228
right . 353228_354058
um, typically, if you think of levels of sophistication, umm,
and the way the chapter's organized, first it talks about frequency
and so relationships you have an inferential statistic, right ? 376338_381361
as opposed to, if you're just talking about frequencies of things
you can't really make inferences from that . 387488_389505
if you did, you'd be, Ok ? 389505_393413
are you with me on that ? 393413_394973
for example, Ok, let's see, um, if I say in nineteen eighty nine
and I'm not really telling you anything about how many there were
I'm just saying plap . 413500_415291
I'm describing something . 415291_417011
I'm not really telling you anything else . 417011_419475
whereas if I said between nineteen eigthy four and nineteen eighty
yeah . 427826_429210
and really there were only sixty four kinda, random murders . 429210_449100
I'm being gross . 449100_450761
but, but anyway, it gets the point across . 450761_452601
right ? 452601_453176
ok . 453176_454570
um, descriptive statistics, um, the book says, describe a sample . 454570_463728
would you agree with that ? 463728_464745
yeah . 464745_466128
ok . 466128_467111
and you know that for the descriptive statistic you can make no
it's kinda, kinda like facts . 474201_475568
you just state them, you can't make inferences . 475568_478511
ok, on inferential statistics, if somebody walks up to you and
without using the word inference, what would you say ? 486801_490175
a statistic that gives you information about something that's gonna
or could happen . 498233_501036
possibly . 501036_502773
also, something that's kinda implicit with inferential statistics
right ? 526331_527291
so, it has a low of clout, 'cause if you don't want to go out every
um, Ok . 543885_550573
moving right along, on page one hundred thirty one, you've got
frequency distributions ? 563988_564580
it's just +... 564580_566436
first you get the certain score and you put it on a, on a scale,
ok, can you tell anything about +... 570865_576336
xxx any difference . 576336_581040
no, but you can kinda analyze the results of the one thing you're
you can if you wanted to know, you've got one class, and you wanted
it does allow you to analyze results, but not very sophisticated . 595951_601351
you see, that's really important, although we're saying, oh, it's
it's as somebody said, um, is there any point to descriptive
right ? 617698_619505
you look like you understand but you don't agree . 619505_623513
&=laughs I'm camera shy . 623513_624576
oh well, it's not really there, don't worry about it . 624576_632576
&=mumble . 632576_633136
um, so are you Ok with that ? 633136_636240
um, if you've got a frequency distribution, I'd like to draw an x@l
first of all, do you know which one is the x@l axis and which one
and typically, no, it's important xxx you mark them at the end . 653975_667318
the back, see, since then usually you'll be putting some
ok ? 672703_673381
um, what's the difference between a frequency polygon and a
and, no, this is not a test . 683753_688038
a frequency poly +... 688038_688688
a frequency polygon, uh, you plot the points, and then connect the
and a histogram is like a, bar graph you just mark the &=mumble . 694198_701101
but the variables' on the bottom, and what they get is on the other
ok . 708573_709046
that's a real important point . 709046_710558
um, and you're exactly right . 710558_712030
and a histogram you said, is like a bar graph . 712030_714885
it is, exactly, you can use the word histogram and a bar graph
they mean exactly the same thing . 718830_720221
ok ? 720221_721005
then, um, later on, we're gonna discuss, um, graphs and
we're trying to recap &=mumbles . 733863_735908
um, I've got a frequency polygon here . 735908_739725
what do I put on the bottom ? 739725_742900
the var +... 742900_743851
ok, let's, let's go ahead and I've got a problem . 743851_745491
well, we'll work through the problem . 745491_746675
ok ? 746675_747348
I'm a junior scientist, and I want to see the effects of studying
ok ? 755378_756523
but because I don't have a calculator, just to make things simple,
so, if I've got a piece of paper that is, instead of a piece of
you see how they've got a, a score table on page one hundred and
let's go ahead and do that right above your shoulder, over there,
that way +... 788985_789513
your information will be there . 789513_790761
what kind of bar graph ? 790761_792113
just like this . 792113_793153
a score . 793153_793970
a roster of scores . 793970_796710
just group them A or B ? 796710_798141
group A or B, if that's what you want to call them . 798141_801933
ok, now, um, I've only got ten subjects in my study, so that'll
group A is, um, people that study less than four hours . 817548_823028
&=mumbles . 823028_824491
less than four hours ? 824491_824971
uh huh . 824971_825435
less than four hours . 825435_826420
group B is people that study more than four hours . 826420_831306
ok, so that's how I've grouped my people . 831306_836428
ok, I'm, my exam only has fivepoints on it . 836428_840641
one to five, Ok ? 840641_842321
just to make this easy . 842321_843561
ok, I'm gonna give you the scores for Group A . 843561_845466
ok, A two, two, three, three, and a one . 845466_853841
group B, you've got a three, a four, four, and a five . 853841_862850
well, we've got one more four, sorry about that . 862850_866673
&=mumbles ok, these are our scores . 866673_870785
um, I, uh, want to make a frequency polygon, and, yeah, let's do it
I've got my axis . 887721_890231
ok, you want me to just do it, or +... 890231_891175
yeah . 891175_891576
you can explain it as you do it if that'll help . 891576_893943
&=mumbles . 893943_897023
in a frequency polygon, do you have the scores on the side ? 897023_903895
remember when we were talking about frequency distributions, we're
and again, this is . 913880_916221
never mind . 916221_916846
you know, this is supposed to be a wonderful learning experience,
&=laughs yeah . 920221_921710
according to the book, on page one hundred and thirty one, it says,
so the people that xxx the people on the side ? 936406_939213
the numbers . 939213_942548
ok . 942548_943036
so it'd be one through ten ? 943036_944325
or it may be +... 944325_945740
well, why don't you, well, what you would, Ok . 945740_948676
ok, that's Ok . 948676_950515
you had it right when I said, what would you put on the y@l axis
um, it's kinda like, when you've got a graph, the main thing, point
and then you dependent measure always goes on the side . 972290_975698
and here we're not looking at, um, A and group B and what did they
that's right . 982538_983018
we're looking at, when you're looking at a frequency distribution,
so what you've got up here, take this, up here would be number of
see what we're talking about ? 1010715_1013911
we're talking about frequency of scores . 1013911_1015640
ok, so why don't you hand me that eraser, please . 1015640_1025256
um, what you're looking at up here, then, is how many times did
so what you do is you look over here to the table and see, hm, for
so the most times any one score was gotten by a group was, would be
so, on this column right here, you're not putting scores, you're
you're looking at frequencies of scores . 1069758_1071938
it's like, how many kids in this class got a ninety eight ? 1071938_1075258
how many kids got a eighty seven ? 1075258_1077131
how many kids got a, you know, fifty eight ? 1077131_1079650
that's what you're asking . 1079650_1081098
how many, Ok . 1081098_1082666
and this is the how many . 1082666_1086065
down here, what do you think we should put ? 1086065_1087586
the scores . 1087586_1088108
right . 1088108_1088588
why don't you go ahead and mark those . 1088588_1090380
with the possible scores . 1090380_1092331
ok . 1092443_1101083
now before we mark anything on there, are you really clear why
yeah . 1105128_1105423
because when we get to graphs and relationships, it's different,
so it's real important when you're talking about the frequency
ok ? 1124481_1125621
you want me to finish this ? 1125621_1126900
yeah . 1126900_1127403
please . 1127403_1127845
why don't you do a frequency polygon . 1127845_1131106
like we'll do a bar graph, Ok ? 1131106_1133921
ok . 1133921_1134600
I won't ask you to do it . 1136191_1140491
why don't you tell me what you're doing ? 1140491_1141396
I'm just marking the, um, scores . 1141396_1143020
ok . 1143020_1143685
&=mumble . 1143685_1146003
uh huh . 1146003_1146443
what do you think ? 1146443_1161036
yeah . 1161036_1162026
ok . 1162026_1162466
&=laughs an alarm will not go off if you do it wrong . 1162466_1165610
ok . 1165610_1166866
&=mumble . 1166866_1167778
one, can I go on a sec ? 1167778_1170985
one point the book makes is that you need, when you're doing a
do you remember that ? 1179385_1180201
it's on page, what is it +... 1180201_1183050
so this would be what ? 1183050_1192060
xxx find it somewhere . 1192060_1202768
xxx ah . 1202768_1222461
on page one hundred and thirty two . 1222461_1224221
you see, they've, they've drawn a, a, example of a frequency
&=mumbles . 1241800_1244876
yeah, well, it's kinda tight on the other side of the page, so,
&=mumbles . 1250116_1250436
if somebody asked you to do one of these . 1250436_1251836
and you were being graded, you would not done it exactly proper . 1251836_1256011
so it says, um, each frequency polygon is anchored at scores that
so what would you do to anchor the score ? 1265643_1268571
bring it down here . 1268571_1269948
ok, why ? 1269948_1270826
cause zero's right there . 1270826_1272411
ok, nobody has &=mumble . 1272411_1273691
okay . 1273691_1274348
you'd take it, like, like, like this ? 1274348_1279098
that's perfect . 1279098_1280005
and what about the other one ? 1280005_1282731
see, they're anchored on both sides . 1282731_1286610
it's kinda like +/. 1286610_1287050
just pull it, just pull it down to zero here . 1287050_1289003
what would you, what score wasn't received by anyone ? 1289003_1293388
ok, what's the next xxx . 1293388_1297931
four . 1297931_1301466
right . 1301466_1301875
so I should xxx . 1301875_1303731
yeah . 1303731_1304076
ok . 1304076_1309396
think of anchor like, if you're on a boat, and if you heave from
ok ? 1315466_1316610
so when you're anchoring something . 1316610_1318575
throw the anchor down, it goes down to the bottom, Ok ? 1318575_1326110
so for A xxx this is A, you, somebody wants to look at this, they
was received by exactly one, one person . 1334926_1337613
ok, score two had two, was received by two people, score three was
ok ? 1348385_1349600
and you're just anchoring so that you're not like, these skeletal
that's all . 1354488_1354951
but it is the proper way to do it . 1354951_1359396
ok ? 1359396_1360141
&=laughs . 1360141_1361421
I know you're real concerned about it, at any rate, you know, you
it might be important to know . 1365196_1366485
&=laughs ok . 1366485_1367788
ok, you want to show group B . 1367788_1370365
what would you do ? 1370365_1370956
ok, Ok, what, what is that three on the other side of this one
what is this three ? 1385965_1387635
the amount of times that +... 1387635_1391196
uh huh . 1391196_1391595
handy eraser . 1391595_1395363
yeah . 1395363_1395978
so what is this ? 1395978_1400955
what is this, a score, you think ? 1400955_1402626
yeah . 1402626_1403426
that's the amount of time . 1403426_1404498
it might help is we +... 1404498_1405321
score . 1405321_1407370
ok ? 1407370_1408246
&=mumbles . 1408246_1412728
all right . 1412728_1414021
three, um . 1414021_1416518
ok . 1416518_1418718
think of anchor like, if you're on a boat, and if you heave from
ok ? 1425846_1426181
so when you're anchoring something . 1426181_1427293
xxx . 1427293_1427981
well . 1427981_1428533
why are you anchoring the two ? 1428533_1433333
should, should +... 1433333_1433878
oh, Ok . 1433878_1436806
&=mumbles . 1436806_1438678
well, are we ? 1438678_1440191
let's see, one's right here, two's right here, three's here, so now
what's the score not received by anyone ? 1447141_1450998
two . 1450998_1451573
does it matter where I put this xxx . 1451573_1464661
yeah, it does matter . 1464661_1466213
&=mumbles . 1466213_1467733
because a six was not received by anyone . 1467733_1471860
ok, I mean, I guess you could be really, uh, ornery about the whole
&=laughs and the book doesn't make clear, but you anchor it at the
which makes sense, right ? 1484530_1485381
yeah . 1485381_1486115
and it's again, just so they're not hanging there . 1486115_1488428
makes it easier to read . 1488428_1488940
yeah . 1488940_1489580
so if you're looking at the score, and see, it's not like you're
so zero people got a one . 1496380_1499026
so it's not, you haven't, uh, misrepresented anything . 1499026_1505178
one little note is that, um, just for you said it's easier to read
it's also easier to read, well, first of all, you always, um,
but, this one's fairly easy because they're so high, um, you want
a dotted line, or something, or colors . 1530465_1532505
a dotted line, or yeah, colors, whatever it is that you have
say here, for example, you might have a dotted, a dotted line
so we got that one down . 1573260_1579401
why don't you go ahead and erase, uh, your beautiful artwork as far
leave the axes there . 1591530_1592191
I just don't like cameras . 1592191_1593665
&=mumble . 1593665_1597351
go ahead and just erase the scores . 1597351_1599126
you realize that stuff doesn't wash off . 1599126_1605703
you have to use a Brillo pad . 1605703_1607591
and if you have more than one group you have more than one
now, um, I've come in and I've asked you, um, to please construct a
what would you do ? 1634993_1635868
put group A here, just +... 1635868_1638205
why don't you tell me, then we'll do it ? 1638205_1639733
put group A here, Group B here, um +... 1639733_1643996
this one becomes a little bit more complicated, Ok ? 1643996_1658830
um, because when you're doing a frequency polygon you can see
you can, you have two choices . 1669515_1671355
in the book, on page one hundred and thirty two, um, what it's done
you can either do two different graphs, one from group A, and one
right next to each other ? 1692690_1694361
right . 1694361_1694985
ok, so why don't you do a frequency histogram for me, um, with both
both groups . 1704321_1705343
so, frequency, um, frequency would be on the left side
uh huh do you think you can leave xxx as they are, or do you
then again, this is no exam . 1725006_1727676
I can't think for some reason . 1727676_1728781
&=laughs . 1728781_1729341
well, that's Ok, that's Ok . 1729341_1730293
oh, man . 1730293_1732421
I could have don't this outside of my desk somewhere . 1732421_1734533
of course . 1734533_1735021
let me ask you a question first . 1735021_1751606
now +... 1751606_1751901
no, go ahead . 1751901_1753228
that's, uh, I'm trying to think of the bottoms, the bottom . 1753228_1755611
ok, in answer to your question, I'm going to ask you a question . 1755611_1761070
um, what's the difference between a frequency polygon and a
the histogram has the bars . 1767146_1772266
ok . 1772266_1773146
ok . 1773146_1775146
the frequency polygon has, has the lines that are, uh, connected . 1775146_1780530
ok . 1780530_1780930
so that's the only difference between a histogram and a frequency
and you have to &~st uh, change the xxx ? 1785450_1788985
you would, if you were doing them on different graphs . 1788985_1794041
but if you're gonna put 'em both on the same thing, there's
ok ? 1797321_1798776
um, you've seen the book um, it's got the same
but somehow or another, well, this first polygon in the book has
if you were doing this, you would need to mark out to the side that
this was either . 1823463_1824351
experimental or control . 1824351_1825295
so the scores say the same as everything up there ? 1825295_1826591
yeah . 1826591_1827328
it's exactly the same . 1827328_1828768
so we're just gonna +... 1828768_1830783
do the same thing, right ? 1830783_1837135
but with bars . 1837135_1837768
with skyscrapers . 1837768_1838655
ok, you're gonna have to make it kinda narrow because you don't
god, think ! 1843830_1844438
ok . 1844438_1845261
um . 1845261_1846415
um, no, say two . 1846415_1849055
group A, how many, how many people got a score of two ? 1849055_1853220
uh, two . 1853220_1854443
ok . 1854443_1855048
so the score's here . 1855048_1856360
I'll just put it here ? 1856360_1857145
uh huh . 1857145_1858168
the bar's gonna be like, can we do it like this ? 1858168_1862096
and put the other here, next to it ? 1862096_1865536
ooops ! 1865536_1882590
well, how many people got a one ? 1882590_1886771
oh . 1886771_1889051
this looks nice like that . 1889051_1891866
yeah . 1891866_1892590
xxx it's misrepresentation . 1892590_1902911
right now . 1902911_1904093
ok . 1904093_1904950
can I, take care of group B ? 1904950_1905733
please . 1905733_1906141
just put down here, that's group B, and the plain's group A ? 1906141_1943493
how would you do that ? 1943493_1943978
how would you indicate to somebody what you mean ? 1943978_1948281
just put it at the bottom . 1948281_1949155
ok, why don't, why don't you show me ? 1949155_1951258
wonderful . 1951258_1969035
so, absolutely flat out, the only difference between a frequency
it's just two ways of visually presenting something, like writing
that's the only difference . 1992226_1993321
ok the only difference ? 1993321_1997030
the both on one, Ok, you could also do graphs where you had, uh,
ok ? 2011215_2012005
so we're clear on that one, right ? 2012005_2014885
now, if I were to ask you, the book mentions this, um, which type
bar graphs . 2029341_2030058
ok . 2030058_2030563
why do you think that is ? 2030563_2031683
cause they're easier to read . 2031683_2032995
right . 2032995_2033571
uh huh . 2033571_2034098
you just look at it, it looks like little skyscrapers, and we can
ok, so you feel real comfortable with that, right ? 2047386_2050386
yeah . 2050386_2051763
ok . 2051763_2052666
uh, if I asked you what an anchor was, what would you say ? 2052666_2057003
where the Y, um, has to cross graph . 2057003_2063226
it has to be at a score that don't got +... 2063226_2065138
uh huh . 2065138_2065666
and usually, which score do you put it at ? 2065666_2067995
zero . 2067995_2069505
or, the, the one following, alright, if you're, if you're gonna
&=mumble . 2078010_2078593
if you're endin' over here it's gonna be, goin', scored this way . 2078593_2081178
&=laughs right . 2081178_2081890
ok . 2081890_2082496
so we've got our, uh, graphs down for frequencies . 2082496_2087665
ok . 2087665_2088808
why don't you go ahead and erase the graph but leave your data up
just erase all this ? 2094336_2095033
yeah . 2095033_2095281
please . 2095281_2105238
xxx chalkboard . 2105238_2105525
&=laughs . 2105525_2107350
&=laughs this is more technologically advanced . 2107350_2110560
ok . 2110560_2112516
there we go . 2112516_2113036
ok . 2113036_2115228
let's go on, uh, we don't really have to turn the page, just glance
we've been talking about descriptive stuff, which shows you like
um, and how we're gonna talk about, u, two important parts of
I walk up to you and say “I don't know anything about statistics” .
what is central tendency ? 2147685_2149028
the, the way everybody performs, the median, the mode, and +... 2149028_2157883
god, I can't remember, I can't remember the second one . 2157883_2162811
grrr@o . 2162811_2163066
the, yeah, Ok . 2163066_2165620
mean . 2165620_2165866
I was supposed to look mean . 2165866_2166540
&=laughs . 2166540_2167883
I was gonna say range for some reason . 2167883_2170381
no, that's invariability . 2170381_2173181
ok, um, generally speaking, central tendency kinda tells you how
ok, so if you didn't know anything about something, and you knew
and the example I typically use is, um, say you and a friend were
you have no idea how much money you need to bring with you to
or, we can get into variability and we'll talk about that in a
and if he says, well, the, you know, the average meal is eight
so, you have a field of what it is you're looking at, right ? 2225035_2229485
can you think of another example, where, where average would come
yeah, the average cost of a car . 2235125_2241268
uh huh . 2241268_2242163
possible . 2242163_2242525
like, somebody said, um, if I say, eight thousand, then you would
yeah . 2253860_2254153
or if you had twelve thousand dollars, you, you're in pretty good
ok ? 2257473_2258696
yeah, that's great . 2258696_2259673
&=laughs theoretically . 2259673_2260808
I know, that's why I smiled when I said it . 2260808_2261936
ok, but so, central tendency's pretty important, right ? 2261936_2265418
as opposed to some, if you want to know how much money you need to
yeah . 2272451_2275386
so, I mean, it's one teeny weeny little package that can give you a
so if we're talking about descriptive statistics, numbers, data,
and you know, well, a little bit here, a little bit here, I'm Ok . 2288968_2291440
ok ? 2291440_2293018
ok . 2293018_2293551
ok . 2293551_2294296
well, you mentioned three, well, how about two, but three of the,
mean, median, and mode . 2307530_2309905
what are the three ? 2309905_2310088
right . 2310088_2310810
I almost said means to describe, but I, &=mumble . 2310810_2313360
ok, what is a mean . 2313360_2315800
ok, let's go to group B . 2315800_2317056
group B's an easy group to do, Ok ? 2317056_2319128
ok . 2319128_2319791
um, if I said, what is the mean, I want you to tell me what it is,
and again, this is like, it's not gonna end your life if you get it
uhhh . 2327888_2328400
the mean would be the average score, you add them up, then divide
ok, so why don't you do that for me on group B ? 2332583_2335335
it's easy . 2335335_2336271
I was, I was kind . 2336271_2337806
you can use the board, too . 2337806_2339598
the mean would be +... 2339598_2343223
ok . 2343223_2346926
why did you draw the x with the bar on tip ? 2346926_2349543
it's the symbol for mean, isn't it ? 2349543_2351781
yeah . 2351781_2352158
don't worry about it, I was just curious, testing you . 2352158_2356110
testing the breadth of your knowledge . 2356110_2358438
ok, um, so what does that tell me about group B ? 2358438_2363756
if you tell me that +/. 2363756_2365821
that the average score is four . 2365821_2366838
ok . 2366838_2367333
that for people that study more than four hours, their average
on a, on a one through five exam . 2373771_2376541
ok . 2376541_2377325
if I wanted to know what the median was, tell me what the median
and the median would be the middle score . 2384563_2386803
ok . 2386803_2388411
uh . 2388411_2389165
what do you mean by middle score ? 2389165_2393306
the one that you've written down that happens to be in the middle .
the +/. 2395476_2396051
or +... 2396051_2396620
the xxx the +... 2396620_2398226
you're, you're on it . 2398226_2400308
the wonderful path . 2400308_2400554
ok . 2400554_2401035
it would be the four . 2401035_2401753
four would be the median . 2401753_2402986
now, um, something that's important to know is the say, um,
say I walk up and I put down . 2414041_2423241
what's the median score there ? 2423241_2424488
uh, four again . 2424488_2427503
why ? 2427503_2428503
well, I mean, the, you go from, on a hierarchy, from the lowest to
right . 2434398_2435070
and that's real important . 2435070_2435878
and that can really screw people up, they think, oh, well, the way
but that's not right . 2447230_2447773
you have to do the numbers in their ascending or descending order .
ok . 2452390_2453061
yeah . 2453061_2453525
let me shut this nasty smell up . 2453525_2455821
yeah, I marked all over myself . 2455821_2456710
well, to me it's the smell . 2456710_2458318
ok, so we've done mean and median, what's the last one ? 2458318_2462518
the, mode would be the most occurring score . 2462518_2465053
ok . 2465053_2465621
which would be a four . 2465621_2466621
most occurring score . 2466621_2468860
you mean the one that, um, you've written up there the most times ?
pretty much, or the one that most people got ? 2473085_2475671
yeah, the one that most people got . 2475671_2478080
great . 2478080_2478808
great . 2478808_2479640
so, Ok . 2479640_2482848
on group B, then, your mean is a four, what did we say the median
uh, four . 2489448_2490943
why don't you go ahead and writ it down . 2490943_2494326
and you can just put md for median, is a, what ? 2494326_2498095
and mode is a mo . 2498095_2501430
ok . 2501430_2504631
I'm gonna give you the, well, I'm gonna give you the mean for group
it's a two point two . 2508766_2510173
&=mumble . 2510173_2515685
ok . 2515685_2515971
what is that median ? 2515971_2517545
the median would be two point five ? 2517545_2521873
what about the mode ? 2521873_2529224
the mode would be two . 2529224_2533751
five again ? 2533751_2534135
would, would you do it like that ? 2534135_2535256
it's a two and a three . 2535256_2537916
then, the mode is, which one appears most often ? 2537916_2541980
both a two and a three . 2541980_2543363
oh, Ok . 2543363_2543740
so you have something that's not really bimodal, 'cause they're
ok . 2546860_2550306
one important, Ok . 2550306_2553170
we're Ok on central tendency, right ? 2553170_2555115
ok, um, let's get to the next point, which is variability, and, um,
one is the standard deviation, and the second is the range . 2574563_2578980
ok ? 2578980_2579426
what is a standard deviation ? 2579426_2582266
uh, a standard deviation is how much something deviates from the
or the mean . 2587496_2588393
of the samples . 2588393_2589418
the average . 2589418_2590176
or the average number that deviates, right ? 2590176_2591696
um, and what about range ? 2591696_2595728
um, it would be the, uh, difference from the lowest and highest
ok . 2603576_2604080
lowest and highest . 2604080_2604816
ok . 2604816_2605223
so you feel comfortable about those ? 2605223_2607465
yeah . 2607465_2607856
ok . 2607856_2608368
all right . 2608368_2609808
ok, let's go on to the last point, which is graphing means, or,
ok ? 2615846_2616320
the first graph, and we can do this rather quickly, because believe
we're done . 2622286_2622568
ok, but I want to do this one thing because there's a major
I'll go ahead and do you x and y axis here . 2628383_2629686
here's you pen . 2629686_2631471
well, we're graphing means . 2631471_2634690
before, you had your dependent, dependent measure in this study,
I'm looking, I'm curious to see how much hour studies affects your
ok, so that's an independent variable . 2651603_2653900
and the way I'm looking at how important is studying is by
you look like, well, I don't know . 2661843_2664818
I'm sorry, say it again . 2664818_2665955
ok . 2665955_2666418
when you are interested in something, Ok, like how important is
that's my question . 2673466_2674841
and I think, well, I'm gonna look at two groups, so, I'm gonna say
and then, somebody says, well, how do you know means they're
and I'd say, well, if they get better scores on an exam . 2693625_2696288
yeah . 2696288_2696585
and somebody's gonna say, well, how do you know that ? 2696585_2698111
well, I have decided to measure studiousness by exam scores . 2698111_2703991
ok, 'cause I can't just go around making statements and not backing
ok . 2710023_2711753
ok . 2711753_2712058
so, when you're graphing means and relationships
ok ? 2725736_2726320
which is different from when you're . 2726320_2729808
yeah . 2729808_2730105
mapping frequencies, right ? 2730105_2732208
so that would be the test score and this
right . 2735416_2735991
ok . 2735991_2736961
and here, we've got two groups . 2736961_2740231
so we'd have a group A and a group B . 2740231_2745440
and over here, the possible scores are one, two, three, four, five .
ok ? 2752166_2753351
so this is your independent variable . 2753351_2759846
and this is your dependent measure . 2759846_2763446
ok . 2763446_2763998
real important . 2763998_2767038
on your frequency polygon, your dependent measure, score, goes down
the results, and here is numbers . 2771638_2775710
and that's real important . 2775710_2781253
I know I just said it, but I'm gonna say it again . 2781253_2782510
ok, you know that . 2782510_2784023
just like you have histograms and line graphs, or polygons, and
here you're looking at means, Ok ? 2804190_2810700
because you're showing means . 2810700_2812620
if I wanted you to do a line graph for me, showing what the means
mark two point two point, point . 2821140_2827988
why don't you show me right here ? 2827988_2828668
just draw a line between them ? 2828668_2837828
ok . 2837828_2838466
in these, you're not anchoring, because you're, you're not
ok . 2843958_2844493
ok ? 2844493_2844676
now, if you did a bar graph and you don't have to erase what you've
&=mumbles . 2849325_2853948
ok . 2853948_2860868
so you feel +... 2860868_2861853
I guess you didn't really have to do that . 2861853_2863565
hm ? 2863565_2864085
since it's marked at the bottom, you don't have to color it it . 2864085_2866348
no, but it makes it really easy to see . 2866348_2868011
easier to +... 2868011_2868300
ok ? 2868300_2868900
so you're comfortable with that ? 2868900_2870746
the, and that's the, I would say probably the most, uh, let's see,
ok . 2884645_2885818
graphs . 2885818_2886586
ok, and it, you have to flat out know that . 2886586_2888923
ok ? 2888923_2889858
we're done . 2889858_2891003
