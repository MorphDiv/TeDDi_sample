and then he poured in the milk .
and it spilled all over .
he decided to skip breakfast .
he went to find his clothes .
he thought he had layed them out on the floor the other day .
but they weren't there .
he looked all over for them .
<then they> then he gave up .
<he &~w just found> he went to find some other clothes .

there was a boy and a girl .
and they were at the park .
they were playing soccer .
then the boy <threw> kicked the ball really high in the air .
it was high in the air really high above the trees .
and then it fell down far away .
they went to find it .
they didn't find it .
instead they found this big round object .
and they didn't know what it was .
then a door opened .
and some strange creatures came out .
what a wonderful place one of them said .
<&~sha> shall we put down our bags ?
the girl <went> wanted to go out and see what they were .
but the boy said don't .
the girl went out anyway .
and the boy followed her .
the creatures didn't see them .
and they went into the big round object .
and then they heard the creatures coming back in .
they heard the door close .
they couldn't get out .
<and so they went &~ou> and they went out .
the girl went out to the creatures .
she wanted to get out .
the creatures saw her .
and <the creature> the smallest creature ran up to her
she said we needta get out .
<we were> we got trapped in here .

the creature said how'd you get in here ?
and they told them what they had done .
and then the creatures let them out .
once they were safe away from the creatures the girl said look what

I took it from them .
<let's> let's go show mom and dad .
so they went .
on the way girl lost the bag .

they lost the ball .
and they went to find the ball .
