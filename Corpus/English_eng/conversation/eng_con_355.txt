As you say three thousand pound a year that could be paid off a
But . 1059151_1059221
when there 's so much other . 1059221_1061741
as I say you look at I mean this is two fifty You look here in the
Yeah I know Some of them are terrible . 1067751_1069161
You 're talking two sixty two eighty . 1069161_1071081
I know Three hundred . 1071081_1072261
To let Three seventy . 1072261_1072831
No . 1073711_1073941
Detached four bedroomed house admittedly Granary Two b two two bed
That 's the one I fancy If I went anywhere into another flat I 'd
Two bed second floor self-contained flat Living room kitchen
Mm I know . 1089301_1090011
Armada Close two eighty Norfolk Street two eighty . 1090011_1093591
Mm I would n't I would n't go in to Armada Close I do n't think . 1093621_1097771
That 's furnished Six months Two eighty . 1097991_1102201
Yeah well you see furnished you see they can charge extra . 1102211_1106921
Norfolk Street self-contained principally first floor flat two
I would n't want a furnished one now . 1112671_1114761
No of course not But as I say . 1114761_1117671
I know they are expensive Which is why I . 1118741_1122381
Two sixty two eighty which is the same price as . 1122381_1125101
which which is why now er that Rose and Jean when they considered
No . 1138171_1138341
fifty quid a week ones are er forty pound a week and so on You gets
Fifty or fifty five were n't it . 1161251_1163041
it was clean but that 's about all you could say . 1163091_1165811
Is that the one Ann is in now Or in that area . 1166741_1169081
I do n't know where Ann is No I think she 's down Victoria Road
Yeah But I mean you see her up town though . 1183630_1188820
I know That 's cos she 's lonely and she just wanders about She
0 .
do n't want to stay in the bedsit One room she she shares a
Yeah but I mean the times I 've seen her it 's been this end of
I do n't really I just presume she lives down Victoria Road
And she walks to work . 1214610_1215200
She could n't do any other She has n't got a vehicle she ca n't
No no But that just makes me think why that 's what makes me think
She could be But that were n't a bedsitter that I was in Shared
No but yeah . 1227420_1228170
but it was a kitchen and bedroom and living room They 're only tiny
Oh yeah I 've been in one of them You know I 've seen them . 1234810_1238160
I mean it was the only one with a with its own kitchen The one that
Yeah . 1245680_1245940
This was right up the top and there were a tiny attic bedroom thing
Yeah . 1254790_1254850
And as I say that was fifty or something a week and it was n't was
No . 1266590_1266980
Furniture was n't that posh but then er but the only thing I
Mm . 1289160_1289520
But it was n't worth fifty pound a week Definitely not . 1289520_1294940
But that 's what they 're going for though is n't it If they can
people do People are desperate to buy and they 'll have whatever
Yeah . 1312310_1312320
When you think that one what was thirty three thousand two hundred
Oh the mortgage you mean . 1333260_1334430
Mortgage So you can say two hundred and fifty pound a month to buy
Oh yeah . 1338770_1339360
And yet they want two eighty to rent one Seems quite ridiculous . 1339360_1343800
Well that 's if you 're prepared to buy a flat That 's the only
Yeah but at least you 've got actually got the property have n't
You 've got to be a bit careful when you 're renting out though . 1387500_1390560
Oh yes Got to be careful of your tenants pay . 1390560_1392850
Tenants . 1392970_1393070
That 's why it 's best to go through an agency or er something like
Yeah but not only that but I mean if you . 1401950_1406050
And they have they have proper leases I mean after that they 're
Yeah well I mean all all well it counts towards your income as well
Oh yeah I know Oh yeah income tax on it . 1411310_1414350
Counts counts towards your income . 1414350_1418700
But a lot of people are doing it . 1418700_1420390
Mm Oh I know Well there 's for one sell . 1422020_1425590
Lot of people are doing it because they just ca n't well
0 .
Even though your all the money . 1445520_1446120
Think . 1446120_1446310
you were getting in was getting paid out again . 1446380_1449740
I think you 'll find it counts towards your income So I mean if you
Paying them more tax . 1454980_1455350
You you got a job say you 're earning . 1455350_1461880
But I think the expenses when you 're . 1461880_1462840
earning ten thousand a year And you 're going you 're getting two
Yeah but you you 'd be able to claim expenses . 1469010_1473110
I think so yeah . 1473110_1473630
You would n't pay the whole of it taxable if it was you know you
Oh I do n't know but I mean I would n't have thought so Yeah . 1478980_1480670
Otherwise probably that 's why they are dear because they have to
That 's probably why they 're the price they are two eighty . 1485970_1490930
That 's it . 1490930_1491200
Because people take . 1491200_1491900
Pay fifty and thirty quid a week more is a bloody what they get
and people have taken out big mortgages like Tina And to pay off
I mean Tina 's got that little house I mean now you 'd get it two
Yeah . 1513430_1513710
I mean that was bloody thirty nine thousand or was it forty one
I know . 1521300_1521860
forty one I think I mean now they 're going for thirty two We can
Yeah we could is n't it . 1525300_1527480
Mm They do n't sell now Not selling at all There 's a few renting
I do n't like the I do n't like the bedroom . 1547640_1553280
No I do n't . 1553280_1553820
situation for one . 1553830_1554050
If it had a door and a wall and . 1554050_1557370
You 're just straight upstairs and you fall into bed . 1557370_1559280
Mm . 1559280_1559400
Handy I suppose but . 1559400_1560330
0 .
In some respects but I mean it just does n't I mean in a way I
It 's not so bad . 1571960_1573990
is n't so bad but I mean if you 're like us and I mean the smoke 's
That 's it That 's why Tina does n't like people smoking in her
Yes Exactly The smoke would just rise straight up and . 1581180_1583930
Yeah . 1584300_1584360
straight up into the bedroom I mean she does n't smoke anyway so I
She does n't like people smoking in her house Because she says I do
She would do . 1596630_1597620
Mind you they have done a bit more to it since Wiggie 's been there
Oh yeah Across the top of the stairs like or . 1605750_1607440
All the way across Because Steve could n't sleep . 1608050_1611460
Because of the light in that little . 1611760_1613250
Because it 's light See you 'd even the patio door light went . 1613250_1617200
Straight upstairs . 1617200_1617430
straight upstairs . 1617430_1617820
And that . 1617820_1618370
Because he 's and then . 1618370_1620260
skylight Mm yeah . 1620260_1621350
skylight He 's had a blind put up a special blind that leads
She can shut it off . 1630830_1634060
she can shut it right off She could n't she just was n't sleeping
Mhm . 1638110_1638280
She said oh he you know we 've had all that done Tracked across the
With the light . 1651680_1658160
With all the lights and daylight and sunshine through the bloody
Mm mm . 1668980_1669130
as I say when it was sunlight shining through the bloody thing on
Mm mm . 1676740_1676990
They could n't have an ordinary one cos it would hang down Has to
Side yeah so it fall . 1686540_1687940
Yeah . 1688090_1688380
Mm . 1688380_1688510
It 's got a you know like a frame what you put in along . 1688510_1691780
Like a venetian blind in a way . 1691780_1693840
Mm . 1693840_1694040
Or a straight down blind but at an angle but er but on runners to
But it 's got runners to hold the side in you see . 1699380_1701690
Yeah . 1701980_1702400
I mean but Steven would but . 1702400_1708140
Do they owe . 1708140_1711310
the building society and erm . 1711310_1712390
the building society Yeah . 1712390_1712720
They 'll have to pay another mortgage as well . 1712720_1714840
Yeah but on the yeah but I mean if she sold it for thirty two she
Well she must have paid a bit off She 's been in there about three
Yeah Well say she owes them nine thousand anyway . 1730960_1732880
Yeah . 1732880_1732970
But then er if they wanted another mortgage it would be . 1733380_1736840
That would be added to it you see . 1736950_1738620
They 'd probably have a fifty thousand pound mortgage to pay off
Well I do n't know I mean Steve must pay about eighty pounds a
Oh yeah of course Steven and his maintenance Maintenance . 1752320_1754510
Maintenance and one thing and another . 1754510_1755330
Yeah Yeah that would cut it down would n't it on their own you can
Mind you saying that three hundred fifty pound a month to buy a
For the interest rate yeah but it would only buy the same sort of
Yeah well that 's what I mean They could have bought afford a . 1782880_1786380
Yeah . 1786380_1786410
a a better property for about forty four thousand or whatever for
No cos she still owes if she sold it she 'd still owe the balance
Yeah so she 's got to buy a cheaper one and that would be added to
That would be added to it you see . 1805970_1808050
Mm and just his wages how much extra they could afford . 1808050_1810390
That 's it . 1810390_1811090
I know Steven would like . 1811090_1812660
Mm . 1813580_1813680
He 'd like one with a spare bedroom so the children can come and
Mm But that 's about fifty is n't it . 1827340_1828590
Fifty two probably get the fifty . 1829900_1833830
As I say you 're looking at a . 1833840_1837710
Hefty mortgage Tina reckons out of her wages she 's got ninety
Expenses . 1851370_1851460
expenses That 's gone before she starts . 1852130_1854580
And then out of Wiggie 's he 's got . 1856140_1858920
Seventy five I think he pays It 's a lot of money gone before you
Mhm before you even start Mm . 1875410_1877060
Depends what you want most do n't it I suppose . 1877070_1879100
