two . 135560_135578
two . 135578_136031
two okay but I think if you use the things you learned from that
um ladies you don't get to pick your own teams we've talked about
+^ I let you pick your own pairs um I assign groups of three and
+^ all of the groups are mixed boys and girls uh because I want us
+^ most of the groups not all but most of the groups um of kids who
+^ I want you to share your ideas with boys and girls . 178010_180743

you have to pick one . 222610_223500
you have to pick one right . 223500_224808
so your teams first job will be to find a fair way to agree on one
your group has to decide how to do that . 238273_241490
Brittany thanks not touching it will be a big help . 241490_245210
you can do it any way that the group agrees to but the members in
does that mean whoever whines the loudest and throws a hissy fit
no . 254796_255396
no it doesn't um &~d and the more you'll have more time for working
if when it's time for morning recess um your group is still trying
I'm hoping that everybody's group will actually have begun building
xxx two by twos . 285185_286186
right that's why you each designed a two by two so that your team
I want you to do some thinking about the designs within each of
how many two by two designs does it take +//. 329200_333105
yes Paul that's really not necessary . 333105_335675
how many two by two designs does it take put together to make a
three ? 343243_343963
nine . 343963_344613
nine yeah three two by twos would be this size . 344613_348948
+^ now these are two by twos that are not the same but these are
these quilts will be the same size as your finished strip quilts . 367261_372220
they'll be the same size but they'll be made in a different way . 372220_377470
how many core squares are in each two by two design ? 377470_381706
four . 381706_382260
(o)kay so in one row of three two by two designs if I had a two by
+< six . 394748_394780
twelve . 394780_395598
six . 395598_396231
twelve . 396231_397820
how Brittany how many core squares are in each two by two design ? 397820_400838
+< twelve . 400838_401620
core squares ? 401620_402000
four . 402000_402503
+< twelve . 402250_402500
four . 402500_402590
twelve . 402590_402800
twelve . 402800_403810
nine . 403810_404250
so in two two by two designs +... 404250_406300
eight . 406300_407350
that's eight core squares and then if I take four more . 407350_410148
that's twelve . 410148_410860
twelve . 410860_411593
hmm that would be one row of three two by two designs . 411593_415761
but then I'd have another row of three two by two designs . 415761_420266
+< Amanda get off . 420266_421100
and that would be +//. 421100_422103
Amanda turn around sit down lay your two by two design down . 422103_426770
in the top row of three two by two designs we've just figured out
four core squares four core squares four core squares . 433408_436811
that second row of your quilt will have three more two by two
that's twenty four . 441648_442865
xxx . 442865_443436
that's twenty four yep twelve and twelve is twenty four . 443436_446540
+< forty eight . 446540_446901
xxx and then there's another row of three two by two designs . 446901_453590
and that would be &~thirty +/. 453590_454643
+< how many core squares is that ? 454643_455725
twelve . 455725_457246
+< just in this row of three at the bottom ? 457246_458610
twelve . 458610_459196
and that would be thirty six . 459196_461295
+< so we put twelve with the twenty four we had . 461295_461565
thirty six . 461565_462781
thirty six . 462781_463181
thirty <four> six . 463181_463696
thirty six yep . 463696_464851
that was exactly the number we came up with when we thought about
so the six rows of six we got to put six and six together to make
and twelve twelve &~tw and twelve makes thirty six . 482345_485700
yep and <it was> we got twelve twelve and twelve a different
+^ because they'll all have thirty six core squares in (th)em

thirty six . 522211_522663
each member on the team will make three two by two designs . 522663_525698
thirty six ? 525698_526531
no they have four people on their team . 526531_529388
+< forty eight . 529388_530253
forty nine . 530253_531500
they'll have three six nine twelve two by two designs in their
+< four . 553618_554470
so if they have twelve two by two designs and each two by two
four . 561030_561558
+< so each of them makes three um um two by two designs . 561558_565500
