different parts those different . 0_1620
you'd get a shape like that by putting the green triangles together
so so when you look at a core square and you're thinking about
sometimes I check around the outside edge and see if it's gonna be
'cause then all I could ever get is blue next_to red and red
if you if we did it like this . 20070_21220
right . 21240_21410
but if I put green I can get green . 22220_23780
sometimes I can have green next_to blue . 23910_25260
or I can have green next_to red . 25300_26370
or I can have green next_to green . 26620_27700
so d c l you might be able to get a lot more possibilities for
you could try . 31860_32350
well could you put a yellow right there and leave the green right
then you'd have how many colors four . 39110_41590
but you mean instead_of putting a green here could she put a yellow
yeah . 47630_47870
and then she could have she could <if you put> if you put a
the only colors you have around your edges are yellow and blue . 57100_60900
see because you still have red . 61140_61770
but if you have the center where you can't touch anything you're
right . 68160_68350
but if you have a yellow at one corner red sometimes the red and
or you could have all the yellows come together to make a yellow
or you could get a red diamond . 80500_81620
or you could get something with red yellow and coming together . 82190_85380
okay . 86430_86670
so do you see why we were asking you to just think about that . 86720_89260
there's nothing wrong . 89960_90460
is there this was Katie's original design . 91070_92700
is there anything wrong with P's design for four square . 93320_95550
no . 95940_96110
no . 96460_96630
but since we're gonna use have to make different designs this one
so it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with this four it just
and this one . 111910_112270
let's try think about let everybody look here yellow here . 115290_119740
okay . 122350_122590
now let's look around the outside edge . 123040_124460
see yellow . 125280_126570
see three different colors around the edge . 129500_131070
right . 131200_131310
so I think that would yellow triangles together . 133980_138030
here . 138080_138150
look at how many different ways like a diamond middle yellow th
