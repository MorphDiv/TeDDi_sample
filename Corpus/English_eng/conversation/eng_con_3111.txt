is that what we're trying to do to see if we can get (th)em all . 860_2910
no . 3580_3640
no . 3800_3890
no . 4300_4470
what do we wanna find out about though . 4520_6140
what do we wanna find out about four squares that are not
if if you could make it too high . 12340_13730
right . 15330_15430
so Nicole once you had a four square on the computer . 16100_18390
and you were sure it was not symmetrical . 18660_20620
what would you do next . 21030_21820
&-um . 25140_25230
what do you have to do to test just like we did to test . 26420_28740
today . 29000_29180
try to make a symmetrical two by two design . 38940_40940
and <what_if you could> what_if you could make a symmetrical
then then it would be true that you would count as an
then what would you do next . 66920_67700
maybe . 71870_72020
then I what would you do . 73230_79650
next . 81280_81460
Nicole you designed a course where you checked to see if it was
you did . 94180_94550
then . 94870_95140
what would you do . 95160_95710
what would she do . 97350_98070
next . 98120_98280
Jillian what would she . 100270_100890
do next . 101000_101220
&-uh is that part of what we're thinking about today . 104140_106140
no . 107820_107950
she make another . 111540_112820
one make another what . 113020_114330
her scared . 115380_115650
she'd make another courseware that isn't symmetrical . 120290_122630
and what would she do with that one &-um . 122720_124090
do the same thing . 125310_125920
and what was that . 127340_127740
same thing . 127760_128150
&-um . 128460_128560
&-uh design . 133760_137010
any two by two . 140400_141130
design for that horse square . 141180_142250
&-uh . 143240_143250
okay . 147210_147300
and what_if you found one that was symmetrical . 147620_149600
a two by two design that was symmetrical . 149840_151370
&-um . 151920_151980
great . 154990_155200
what would you do next . 155490_156290
famous . 157480_157630
you'd be famous . 158750_159130
no . 159600_159770
I don't know if we found twenty core squares today that were
and you made symmetrical two by two . 164120_166090
are any of us famous yet . 166310_167360
no . 168920_169040
you think what_if Nicole says . 172890_174890
maybe we have to make a hundred . 174940_175820
what_if we found one hundred asymmetric core squares . 178290_182870
and we found for all one hundred of them that we could make a
what would we know . 190870_191620
&-um . 192380_192540
a lot . 194450_194590
know how to make . 196430_197470
do we know how to do that yet . 205270_206310
yes . 207020_207050
I wish y'all do it for me today . 207590_209140
so if we've already done it with twenty . 212160_213470
do we need to do it for a hundred . 213700_215140
I don't know . 222760_223060
do we . 223310_223610
yes . 224220_224320
why . 225020_225140
so that we know that there's lots_of them . 226500_228070
we could probably so that we could a hundred everybody one everyone
that'd be red . 250240_250700
thank you for raising your hands . 254700_255790
recess . 256860_257230
no . 258190_258269
we're gonna go out right now . 258320_259430
thank you guys . 259880_260390
a little bit differently than these questions . 261640_263100
and &-um I wondered if you could cast back a few years and talk
especially &-uh mathematics or space . 272250_274470
and the way you teach mathematics . 275130_276110
now what's different . 276300_277310
okay . 278030_278230
well everything's different about the way I teach math . 278280_281750
but in particular what this unit brings you know . 281860_285760
so brings home for me is how differently I teach geometry to second
because the typical way to teach geometry to second graders was a
&-um I personally put it at the beginning of the year because the
and so many of my beginning second graders struggled even to know
and that was our major expectation . 311010_312670
so to keep them feeling good about themselves as mathematicians I
this is math also you might be good at shapes . 319450_322360
and &-um you know volume and measurement and things like that . 322570_325670
even_though you're struggling with your math facts . 326500_328240
so but it would still be a two or three week unit centered around a
and then just enriching that with other activities . 337610_340030
this is &-um immersion . 340050_342190
I mean <this is> this is different . 342330_343860
this is wonderful . 344270_344790
they accomplished more in the first three days of puling than I
how &-um how did you come to school for class . 351830_354950
history of this . 356540_357140
mhm . 357340_357570
well . 358350_358450
&-uh about four years ago I had started doing maybe five . 360180_366610
I had made quilts a piece of my geometry teaching or more &-um more
we did a lot with taking a circle and dividing it into fractional
and then using those to make designs using those parts of circles
and then each child designed a square which just meant it contained
it was a square piece . 392920_394040
and it contained their design based upon parts of circles . 394150_397170
and then they worked in teams and chose a favorite design and
and arranged them in quilts . 402690_404000
and during that unit then our literature base was all of the
so I had done quilts . 409830_411000
and then when you came to me with look what's in development now
and these are the geometry &-um ideas contained in that . 422650_427200
and after looking through that &-um and all they had written in
that's where this unit has come from . 434980_436530
because for the first two years that this unit &-um was taught with
there was no software here . 441030_442890
we didn't have it yet . 443280_444200
it was still being developed . 444240_445250
so this is &-uh tied to what they had planned . 445450_448530
but it's it &-um it evolved a little differently because we never
I noticed that . 454830_455220
&-uh hold . 455730_455970
sorry . 456100_456300
Rich yeah . 456560_457130
&-um trying not to &-um . 457520_459020
uhhuh . 459310_459410
uhhuh . 459710_459830
watch his answer . 460370_460920
oh okay . 461240_461440
okay . 463070_463200
&-um where were we . 465120_466240
&-uh I think I was gonna ask next . 466840_471650
&-uh so now you have the software . 472700_474350
mhm . 474460_474580
the software's been in the room since the very beginning of the
mhm . 477900_478060
yet &-um the software still plays a different role . 478370_482800
plays in the curriculum . 483290_483890
mhm . 484490_484610
it still seems to come on toward the end . 485130_486860
this is the year I thought that maybe that would change . 486910_489130
maybe I would integrate some aspects of the software earlier than I
but that didn't happen as I watched my kids &-um grow in their
I never got to a point where I said . 505320_506940
you're right . 508380_508570
this this doesn't have to happen offline I can sit them down at
they &-um it it works perfectly as a culminating &-um a
the computer does all of the software that's there . 519530_522020
even_though we made it till the end they're making massive use of
I mean it fits very nicely there more nicely than if I had tried to
so you see the . 533800_534430
computer computer as a kind of a design tool . 534910_537030
mhm . 537380_537590
&-um my kids didn't use it to learn how to quilt or to learn how to
they sat right down before it and were ready to do everything it
they didn't have to &-um get it just out to them a little piece at
or learned just one aspect of how that software worked at a time .
they sat down ready to use everything it had to offer to to
can I just why is the computer . 564580_566910
okay
