it is about <nine forty-five> in the morning of June
we are at the Federal Judicial Center , and this is part of the

I came on board in June <nineteen seventy> , and Roe
it is a case that is controversial ; that is , constantly under

the First Circuit vacated that dismissal , holding that the statute

the opinion in that case was by Justice Brennan , and he was joined

we felt that a narrower ground was available because of the
the chief justice , Burger , was in solitary dissent , and Justices
appearing for <Doctor> Baird was then Senator Joseph <D>
such was the Supreme Court case law situation when Roe against Wade
both Justice Hugo <L> Black and Justice John Marshall Harlan
the rest of the Court tried to function as a seven-member court
it was a difficult period , for there were three two-week argument
the chief justice appointed a committee to screen the cases that
the goal , the stated goal , anyway , was to select cases for
in other words , there was a desire to avoid four-to-three
the screening process , in my estimation , was poorly conducted by
potter Stewart was chairman , I was on the committee , and I think
there were some four-to-three decisions during that period .
none of those , however , proved to be disastrous or embarrassing .
roe and Doe were both placed on the calendar for oral argument
it seems to me that this was a basic and serious error on the part
at argument , and indeed before then , some of us realized that we
the cases were argued in tandem on December <thirteen> ,
at issue was the validity of the respective Texas and Georgia
there were differences in the two statutes , for the Georgia
three of the four oralists were women .
I'm not critical in saying that ; I'm merely pointing out the
the sole male was an assistant attorney general from Texas , who
attacking the statute was Sarah Weddington , who later held a post
defending the Georgia statute was Dorothy <T> Beasley , and
during the argument , I inquired about the Hippocratic Oath .
I was disturbed by the fact that it had not even been mentioned in
the answer to my inquiry to Miss Hames was this : she said that the
my response was that I had attended several medical school
I also told her that copies of the oath hang on the walls of many
one will recall , I think , that some versions of the oath include
was it really irrelevant ?
I got nowhere with my inquiry .
at the ensuring conference on the cases a few days later , the
only Douglas , Brennan , and White , and perhaps Marshall ,
justice Marshall was a little equivocal .
I was the junior justice , and there were only seven of us .
immediately after the conference , as he occasionally did , Chief
usually the rest of us groaned silently when he made a suggestion
it was apparent to me at the conference that Justice Douglas wanted
the chief , however , gave it to me .
some say , such as the late Joe Rauh , that he made the assignment
I assume , but do not know , that the assignment was made because
in due course , I produced a memorandum ending with a suggestion
immediately , however and I do mean immediately I moved
there were several reasons why I proposed reargument .
I was not well satisfied with the draft I had prepared , and I was
I was concerned because absolutely no help had been given us on
still another reason was the fact that Lewis <F> Powell ,
I felt that the issues were important and sensitive enough to
at this time , there were intimations in the Washington press and
he did not make that suggestion .
whether he was dissatisfied with the draft , as I was , is
he denied it , however , to me in person and inferentially in his
when my motion for reargument came up at the next conference ,
I saw recently a segment on the tube to the effect Nina Totenberg
that is not true .
only Douglas complained .
he said he was very much against rearguing the two cases .
he never told me why he took the position , but I'm fairly certain
he was afraid of how the two new justices might vote , and he felt
it was an unpleasant and , indeed , rather an ugly conference .
a subsidiary issue arose .
Powell and Rehnquist had come on the Court on January <seven>
the question that then presented itself was whether they were
I shall not go into details as to this .
I shall say only that the vote to reargue was taken and was
in the summer of <nineteen seventy-two> , I spent two

I was content and happy to work there .
later aspersions in the media were cast about this , with the
the only people who knew what I was doing there , however , were
each culled books for me when I wanted them , and what I desired to
I finally found a definitive answer , I concluded , in a monograph
all this is set forth in some detail in the Roe opinion , <four
it is there for one to read if he is interested .
it convinced me that the Hippocratic Oath was localized and
all this was done on my part without any knowledge whatsoever of
the second argument took place on October <eleven> ,
a different male assistant attorney general for Texas appeared ,
I thought all counsel were better the second time around , but
that , of course , was a disappointment so far as I was concerned .
at conference , the vote was seven-to-two to reverse , but it still
the chief justice , although very tentative in his vote , chose to
the cases were assigned to me to write .
why me ?
I have never asked for a case assignment , although other justices
what I am now about to say is sheer speculation on my part .
I never asked Chief Justice Burger what his thinking was in making
I may be totally in error , but this at least is my perceived

I can understand and sympathize with this .
there also seems to have been personal reasons , due to his family

I have never had an expression from Justice Brennan as to whether

Marshall was next , and Marshall was the only African American on

in addition , I had written the earlier memorandum .
lastly came Powell and Rehnquist .
rehnquist was not a possibility because his vote was the other way

thus , it seemed to me to come down to a choice between Stewart and
I had done the memo , there was the Mayo background , and therefore
I was not enthusiastic about it , but cases are argued and cases
we cannot pick and choose among comfortable options .
I was able to get the new drafts out fairly promptly .
I think the first circulation was on November <twenty-two> ,
promptly came a concurrence from Douglas , joining the opinion but
promptly came joinders from Brennan , Marshall , and Powell , and I

that's at page <two twenty-two> of <four ten> <U_S>
finally , a separate concurrence with a joinder came in .
it was short , being only a little over a page .
to this day I do not know for certain why he took so long .
I am grateful , however , for the final sentence of his opinion .
the chief said this : +"/.

on the part of the chief justice ?

Byron White was rather emotional in delivering the dissent , and
why was Byron White so strongly on that side of those cases ?
it surprised me a little , and I've never asked him .
I have some thoughts about it .

a few days later , however , the roof fell in .
the mail to the Court proved to be the greatest in its history on a

letters on the subject still come in .
a few remarks about the mail .
much of it was organized .
not all of it , by any means , was one way .
some of the most beautiful letters I have ever received have come
there were instances of thirty or so letters from pupils in a

the reaction of the religious community was varied .

the commentators of the media were divided .
the New York Times generally approved , and continues to do so in
