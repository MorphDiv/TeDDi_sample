so:: (0.7) the talk will be casual mainly it'll be a guided tour

u:::m (2.7) there's a f- a little biographical not'e that I found

it's: (0.7) breaking my xxx my insanity's breaking their bank book

the:y are: not controlled by a need to be exa:ct→ (0.7) 124624_128219
and what you get is a lot of nice sounds like ninetynine and
I collected a whole bunch of 'em→ (0.5) a::nd then we branched out
ah::: about a week ago I was telling my class (0.5) at UCI about
sometimes it's easy (0.6) to find a phenomenon→ it's almost like
and I told them this ⁇w'll⁇ I had no idea where this thing had

alright (0.3) that's the kind of phenomenon we're studying in the

and it wasn't anything like I remembered it↘ 171800_173595

it was written to himself and it was handed to me↘ (0.6) 178820_181360
se:condly it turns out (0.5) he had a very specific phenomenon in

turns out he wuz looking for a very special thing↘ (0.6) rephrased
I don't think we've looked for 'em yet ∆we didn' know they were
°well now we'll start looking for them (0.7) we'll turn up a
∆okay so that's:∆ → where f' me it started↘ (0.3) I have a feeling
ah Harvey had clearly been reading (0.2) all sorts of stuff about it
it's not new with us it doesn't reside with us (0.7) 214960_218290
u::m (1.2) Judy Davidson has begun to work (0.5) with these sorts of
and what happened was it seemed the thing was beginning to
and I said we've got to start checking out the literature (0.6)
so Judy brought in some stuff and I started reading it (0.2) 237870_240155
which I don't usually do↘ 240155_241285

and what happened wa:s (0.7) I developed an enormous affection

u:::m (2.1) stopped reading anything else and just started reading
so what I'll do is introduce you to this guy too↘ (0.2) 256630_259090
a:pparently he is: (0.4) quite obscure (1.4) 259090_262430
ah::: (0.7) the thing that attracted me about him is: (1.2) he seems
I don't know what was going on at the time↘ ≡ whether (0.2) at that
b't this guy was very much in favor o:f (1.2) what he called the
that is (0.3) you don't run tests on people to see how they talk and
you talk to them and you listen to them and you xxx down the
he also had another line↘ ∆this is all about∆ psychotic
another line he had was tha:t (0.9) the- interesting thing (0.3)
(0.9) 300090_301060
a listener (0.7) would listen to it (0.9) and try to take it at face
an' that was one of the problems a listener to a psychotic had↘
that he wasn't hearing (0.4) the clangs and associations the
but what he wuz: he was doing was listening to it at for face
how he could be led to do that was (0.7) because the talk was as he
now Woods was talking about sentence structure↘ (0.4) 328440_331280
and 'e kept insisting an' insisting (0.5) this ta:lk (0.4) is: (0.3)
because the sentences are so perfect (0.6) you don't see that
they're just making these nice sentences (0.5) 342235_344175
again and again he talks about how (0.9) the pathological phenomena
and I figure we can jus' adapt that→ (0.3) right off and
this guy's got formal structures which a:re (0.4) more than sentences
sequential structures all the interactional structures we're
so we can jus' do a nice little adaptation of it↘ (0.9) 370340_373680
okay so I'll be introducing you to Woods (0.4) and I'll be
two features I wanna talk about→ (1.2) fo:r (0.3) jus' talk (0.6) 380210_385170
one is the objects out of which talk a- are built→ (0.4) °talk
another feature is that a lot of these words (0.3) phrases (1.9)

those are two features↘ (0.5) 404450_405905
now I'm gonna be looking a:t talk↘ (0.9) 405870_408380

who make it their business (0.7) to work out (0.2) to seek out (0.5)
I'm gonna read you a- (0.5) this is gonna be (0.4) a translation
that's at the top Harvey has a collection of (0.3)
and at the top of it (0.3) is this poem (0.2) by Paul Valéry and it
I'm looking for a word said the poet (0.6) 440750_443055
a word which should be: (0.4) 443055_444590

that's the poem↘ (0.8) tha::t's the poet's job↘ (0.4) °alright°
now you look over at pathology (0.2) which is the other domain (0.7)
an' psychotic talk the clangs and associations→ (0.6) about
you have all these crazy things going o:n↘ (0.6) 473310_475835
now Woods made a very nice observation (0.7) 475835_478460
when he says→ (0.6) he says this about a particular pathological
there is probably nothing pathological about them as a purely

what is pathological is the tendency to incorporate such autistic
Woods complained↘ (0.7) he has this lovely complaint throughout↘ 507090_510210
+≈ those psychotics just will not try:: (0.6) to design their
and it sounds like what he- wuz beginning to glimpse at was
these people don't do it he said and he complains↘ (0.5) 520860_523780
alright (0.6) so here you have it↘ (0.3) 523780_525690
this guy: in nineteen thirty eight (0.5) in a hospital in Iowa City

∆I look at this and I say he was right on it∆↘ (0.3) what happened to
we'll go again we'll take Woods with us→ (0.6) an' we'll take a look
what I'm gonna do:: (1.2) won't replicate how the stuff was found↘
it's ki:nd o:f (1.0) a way of:: (0.4) introducing you to this
I ↑think in a way that might insult your intelligence a bit↘ (0.4) 558490_561595
what I'm gonna start off with is→ (0.4) utterly simple↘ (1.0) 561595_565370
utterly simple instances of the phenomena↘ (0.5) then I'll work it
I'm gonna start with errors↘ (0.6) 571290_573115
and I start with errors becau:se (1.4) 573115_576040
a:s Woods notes→ (0.3) you have this (0.4) ∇plausible (0.3) smooth
the formal structures are going alo:ng and this stuff is
and one of the games we ha:ve with this stuff is (0.2) you don't
and maybe you still don't see it (0.4) and then you see it (0.8) 591770_595150
with errors (0.2) that surface is broken a bit↘ (0.4) it's already
so I'll start with errors an' what I'll do (0.3) for any phenomenon
I'll give you some sound (0.5) and some category (0.5) of each sort
so I'll start with these (0.4) sound errors↘ (3.6) 608830_614650
u:::m (0.8) okay↘ (2.6) 614650_619055
the ha:ndout (0.3) labelled (0.5) with the pages numbered 619055_621990
I'll just go through the handout (0.6) and give you some of the
sound rows↘ (0.8) you get rows of sound→ (0.8) 626565_630310
li:ke→ (0.4) in the first→ (0.8) a K row↘ (0.2) kuh kuh kuh (0.7) 630310_634565
so article (0.3) that you quote here (0.3) refers to Roman
alright you have th- the sound kuh (0.7) possibly discarded
treated then by the speaker as some sort of error↘ (0.9) 649380_652920
a:nd we look at that and say it's possible→ (0.9) that the word kuh
the word countries if it were that word→ (1.0) was selected not by
special (0.3) ∆that it is was better word or whatever∆→ (0.3) 663880_666885
it started with kuh (0.3) and that's how it got selected↘ (1.4) 666885_670875
that it was being sai::d→ (0.6) wasn't quite ri:ght→ (0.4) then got
e-ah fragment two:↘ (1.5) ah: an I: I: will be up 676210_681180
∆this is a W row∆↘ will be up that way wuh- (0.4) a
what possibly has ⁇start on⁇ Wednesday (0.5) wrong (0.5) abandoned
I'll give you another one that's not in your data (0.5) 692550_695110
u::m (1.3) the (0.3) f-feature of these things is y-you type your
you'll run into a few more cases an: not be able to resist
so here's another one↘ (0.6) 704560_706210
u::m (1.6) this is gonna be an S row↘ (1.1) 706210_710660
the question is: ah: ∆when are you gonna get off∆ work (0.4) and
and Emma says yeah won't take you long↘ (0.2) 717050_719000
and then she sa:ys (0.5) an' you'll be home sa- oh Tuesday↘ okay on
so there's seven seven thirty or som-n sa- (1.0) Saturday possibly
that's (1.1) one very simple way t' begin to get a sense that you're

alright now here's another sort of business↘ (1.1) 743720_746500
u:::m (2.0) you get a na:me↘ (1.1) °am I in the right place°↗ (2.4)
this is ∆the same sorta thing when you getta name∆ Foreman↘

and that's wrong he was stopped at the thirty yard line↘ 761530_763810
∆so y' got∆ Foreman stopped at the forty (0.5) corrected (0.4) thirty
the four four (0.6) getting that wrong number which is replaced↘
°awright° (1.1) the next one (0.3) 773135_775675
I'll start out treating as a sound row a little more complex and
number four↘ (0.7) this is taken from a radio show (0.3) 782085_785755
and the (0.2) commentator is doing a live commercial (0.5) for a
and he's into a B L row↘ so it's ∇big beautiful sa:vings from
°awright° (1.1) now we've got these things and they're- fair- fairly
B rows K rows S rows they get wrong sou:nds↘ (0.6) 809830_813200
∆this is a∆ B L row (0.7) and it gets the wrong sound blah↘ gets
now this thing gets treated as no:t just whatever those others would
now I'm not gonna do: much talk about tha:t (0.6) but what I do wanna
we have these phenomena (0.7) and they're called Freudian slips↘
and then we seem to have a bunch of other things that look exactly
except the words they produce (0.4) or in this case (0.4) yeah ∆°the
can't be made some other sense of↘ (0.3) so they're jus' not
the ones that are noticed (0.3) are the ones that c'n this c'n be
and now we collect this very skew:ed corpus of Freudian ↑sli:ps
and are no:t seen (0.4) that they have (0.4) very identical shapes
∆awright so you have∆ (0.8) one set of process (0.4) now divided up
or at least one of them is↘ ≡ °the Freudian slip° (0.9) 881850_884520
and that shows up (0.4) when it ca:n (0.4) we see it when we-
and when we can't we don't see much of anything↘ (0.9) 889190_891835
°awright so it's a very skewed category°↘ (1.4) 891835_895205
this→ (0.5) number four also has another phenomenon (0.4) that may
and it's something that you can call a projection error or a
you ha::ve (1.2) °let's see°↘ (0.5) u::m (1.1) 907620_912315
a consonant vowel consonant consonant vowel row↘ (2.8) 912315_918245
°awright° so what y' gonna have i:s (0.8) bonds (1.2) consonant

so you get (0.2) now C C V→ (0.5) this one might have been C V were
it turns out that's a very very standard phenomenon↘ 942050_944720
you get this consonant vowel consonant consonant vowel

on behalf of the whole frigh- (0.4) flight crew (0.5) I'd like to
so: passengers cracked ↑up nudged each other and said wow

it's a little more complicated and maybe kinda ni:ce↘ ≡ what you
it ought to go (0.4) F L F R (1.5) ah or- F excuse me↘ 1026210_1031850
it outta go: consonant L: (0.9) consonant R (1.1) 1031850_1036670
but there's been an L before it whole↘ (0.4) 1036670_1039140
it looks like what's happened is the whole thing h'z jus got pushed
the L has been done→ (0.5) and now the R shows up where it ought to
except th't ought to go L L R↘ (0.7) so it's just collapsed one move
I find it more interesting→ (0.7) to watch the things work in those
than to sit and t' ponder o:n deep hidden meanings of (0.3)
you get a (0.3) much more enormous ↑corpus (0.2) and you start
rather than waiting for them to identify themselves as Freudian
u::m (0.8) the next one on the other hand looks like just the
it looks like a Freudian slip that didn't ha:ppen (1.0) which
there's a ↑football broadcast (0.8) where an Oakland Raiders

somehow he finds himself (0.5) complimenting (0.4) the very nice
