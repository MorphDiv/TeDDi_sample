okay . 155_375
so I want you to hang on to that thought when we talk about whether or not the plan was insane or not . 395_4695
my question for you all is why would it be a suicide mission ? 5115_7655
think about what he was trying to do . 7815_9535
why is that a suicide mission ? 9815_12395
xxx and xxx are saying, because everyone's going to turn against him, so he's not going to have any supporters, but why ? 12815_18655
think about the physical act of raiding a federal arsenal . 18935_23515
how many people did he have with him ? 23655_25015
twenty-one .
okay . 25355_27015
why is it a suicide mission ? 27985_29365
why is it a really terrible idea ? 30625_33205
S_one ?
because a lot of people were going to die . 33765_35805
probably . 36725_37165
yeah . 37465_37625
why though ? 37825_38585
S_two ?
because it's a whole entire army against just twenty-one guys . 39125_42205
yeah . 42225_42445
it's the United States Army against twenty-one people . 42585_45945
okay . 46565_46785
it's probably not going to turn out well for John Brown and that's +... 47045_51505
where does he +... 51645_52105
what part of the document mentions that it's probably a suicide mission ? 53965_57465
what quote from the document really captures that ? 57805_61765
S_three ?
+" when I told him he was going into perfect steel trap, and that he would never get out alive . 62925_67985
yeah .
so Frederick Douglass is saying, yeah, I told him it's a bad idea . 68485_71725
you're not going to get out alive . 71985_73605
okay ? 73845_74045
S_four ?
but see how Frederick Douglass is saying to that man . 75465_79525
because, as you said before, it all happened now . 81745_83925
but when they first talked about it, when it didn't happen, he could have been like, oh, I think it was a good plan, we should do it . 84385_91525
now he's just saying that because it all happened . 91865_93565
okay .
yeah .
so we have to be critical of that . 94245_96105
right ? 96325_96345
he has the benefit of hindsight . 96425_98365
he knows what happened . 98685_100785
so, I mean, it's possible that, in eighteen-fifty-nine, when they met, that he didn't say all of this . 101625_107545
S_three ?
but, I mean, if he really +... 108585_110985
S_four .
hey, S_four . 111525_112805
S_three is responding to you, so you should be looking at her . 112805_115565
but if he really did support that then, wouldn't he be one of the twenty-one crew ? 116105_120605
that's a good point . 123105_123565
go ahead, S_five . 124225_126725
I agree with S_four, because Frederick Douglass took the time to meet him there . 127245_133325
if he really believed in this plan and really said that he wanted to do this, he would've been there . 133345_138325
he would've joined in . 138485_139185
yeah, because he was a man of his word . 139565_141045
but he could've died . 141345_142805
he would've died at the last minute, so . 142985_144685
we don't exactly know . 145005_146125
Fredrick Douglass was actually talking to xxx .
and I mean we don't exactly know xxx . 146525_154445
he could've said, alright I'm on my way . 164705_167045
you were basically implying, xxx . 167325_168745
okay . 170085_173185
yeah . 173605_175805
so we are limited with just the documents that we have . 175945_178325
okay . 179265_179585
we do need to be critical of the fact that he wrote this twenty-two years later . 179685_183585
so it's easy for him to disagree with it now . 183745_186225
okay . 186425_186745
well, let's focus on what he is saying now . 186885_188965
some of us said, okay, he's saying it's a suicide mission . 190795_194315
what else does he say ? 195275_196295
what else is he saying for why this is a bad plan ? 196295_200635
S_five .
to me xxx . 202235_203895
I said, because he is kind of xxx, he denied it . 204215_210555
because it's kind of an insane plan, but he's also saying that in the better interest of the slaves and the better interest of the people that you are going to be affecting when you do this ? 210725_220705
I'm not going to be a part of this, because he doesn't want, in the better interest of the slaves, he doesn't want it to be exiled from the country . 220865_226745
so you think what he's basically, what you're saying Douglass is arguing is that this is going to hurt the abolitionist movement . 227145_233385
it's going to and that might hurt the slaves in the long run . 233925_236605
go ahead, S_eleven . 236905_237245
so S_five, how do you know that he's a man of his word ? 237705_243445
because he's Frederick Douglass . 244225_246485
I mean he's Frederick Douglass . 246645_250425
so just because I'm S_eleven . 250785_254145
just because I'm a person doesn't mean I'm a man of my word . 254465_263665
no, but because of his role in the +... 264105_267545
in this movement . 267645_268285
he's an abolitionist . 268365_269245
so of course he's supposed to be telling the truth . 269425_271105
well +...
no, just because you're an abolitionist doesn't mean you're telling the truth . 272365_276205
Frederick Douglass, his history is very, very +... 276605_278985
inspiring ?
inspiring .
does that make me a man of my word . 281225_288405
okay . 288625_288845
yeah, go ahead S_thirteen . 289105_292965
in Document A, when he was giving his speech, he was saying that he wasn't trying to kill him, he wasn't trying to make them rebel . 292025_302145
But now like the whole part of this plan without killing people, he's never going to get to the slaves and stuff . 302345_307325
without literally freeing them and giving them weapons, that's actually rebelling the xxx . 307865_313865
so just because you're an abolitionist doesn't mean you're always true to your word . 314125_318225
okay .
and that's a good transition for us again, S_thirteen too . 319205_321965
because you're saying, he says he never planned to do all that kind of stuff . 322105_326085
does Douglass make us think that maybe he did ? 326505_328885
was there anything in the document that made you think yeah, maybe he did plan to do that stuff . 329025_335865
go ahead, S_fourteen . 336485_337805
it says that, Captain John Brown did not care about upsetting the nation . 338045_341165
yeah . 342245_342785
it says he doesn't care about upsetting the nation . 342965_345345
and he says even, something shocking was just what the nation needed . 345585_349645
what does he mean by that ? 349825_350725
what did he mean by that's, what the nation needed . 351305_355325
that if this happened, then this is actually what the nation supposed to open their eyes to just see what's going on . 357085_365225
okay . 365325_365565
so this is going to be, like we were talking about earlier, the warning . 365705_368885
the kind of eyeopening thing, that's going to get everybody to realize that this is a problem and we've got to do something about it . 369025_376145
yeah . 376305_376345
S_fourteen .
another response to S_thirteen, she said that just because xxx Frederick Douglass tried to be peaceful without any violence just like the underground railroad . 376705_391045
okay . 391305_391945
so you're saying that Frederick Douglass thought the underground railroad was a better method, whereas Frederick or John Brown says that's not working . 392605_400045
okay . 401385_401425
so let's talk about that then for a few minutes, a lot of you in the beginning of class raised your hand and said that John Brown was insane . 402585_414465
that his plan was not a good idea, that it ended up killing a lot of people and he clearly didn't care about those consequences . 414485_424265
whereas some of you argued, no, this was a good idea . 425025_428745
or at least that he knew what he was doing . 430165_432185
and he thought that, at that time that's what needed to happen . 432425_437125
okay . 437605_437845
so I want to open this up for discussion and I'm going to put a couple of questions on the board and doesn't mean we have to follow all of those, but we already talked about that one . 438385_449285
okay .
let's start with this one . 451785_455485
okay .
so those of you that raised your hand and said he was insane, or those of you +... 456025_459885
or the plan that was insane and those of you that said no, it was not insane . 460365_464125
did Douglass' opinion change your mind ? 464385_467565
okay . 468445_470645
we're going to start this discussion and I don't want you raising your hands anymore . 470885_473805
we've done it before you guys know what to do, wait for somebody to finish talking and then you can respond to them . 473945_479545
and I want everybody paying attention . 479685_481545
so eyes on the person talking . 481845_483265
S_thirteen, go ahead and start us off . 483345_484305
well, at first I said that he was insane and stuff, but reading Douglass stuff maybe changed my mind . 484475_493155
because he said that she didn't want to do blood spill, but it had to happen because there was no way to get them to the slaves . 494055_504135
so what changed my mind was, it could have been a better way just to use the underground railroad . 505465_513325
and his plan, he didn't really thought through it, he just went along with it and said okay, this is going to work out . 513825_519465
but it didn't really work out . 519925_521525
plus he was xxx . 521845_522825
he was in a lot of pressure of what happened . 523065_525145
he got bankrupt, he didn't have a lot of stuff . 525485_528165
so he was, like S_twelve said, his heart was in the right place but his mind wasn't . 528525_533185
okay . 534155_534415
so you're saying that he was being reckless basically . 534435_537715
maybe some of the things that he had experienced earlier on in his life made him not really think through what he was doing . 538715_547035
and so you think that the underground railroad, just keeping with that and keeping with the more peaceful methods of ending slavery would have been a better choice ? 547635_555375
basically . 556275_557095
I think he feels that murdering five people isn't that important because slave owners are basically murdering all these slaves in one day . 560245_571305
and he just killed five people . 571765_575465
so he thinks that doesn't really matter . 576185_578005
because they're killing like thousands of slaves a day . 578425_581865
okay . 582085_582205
so eye for an eye, they're killing people, so we're going to kill their people . 582345_585065
all right . 585665_587865
are you trying to respond to S_thirteen . 588825_591165
so do you agree with her that he was insane or no ? 591165_593405
no . 593985_594265
okay . 594445_594745
are you saying that revenge was the correct answer ? 595145_598265
not really, but that's basically what they were doing to slaves . 599225_603565
they were basically doing something that was incorrect too . 604985_607485
and they weren't getting hurt or anything . 608105_610505
but two wrongs doesn't make one right . 610585_612105
not all slave owners treated their slaves like that . 615065_618745
some actually treated them well, some didn't . 619145_621225
it kind of depends on the slave owner themselves . 621545_624545
yeah . 626025_626085
and I don't want to get into a discussion over whether or not slavery is wrong or right, right now . 626345_631165
and then I understand where you're coming from, but I want to get back to S_thirteen's point though . 631245_634825
S_thirteen said that he murdered these people, reckless plan, doing what they've been doing was the better option . 635485_644205
S_fifteen brought up, yeah but they're maybe not killing people, but they're taking away the rights of people . 644945_652665
so I mean, that's what needed to be done . 653145_655905
so the opinion that we've got really on the table right now is that they should have just stuck with what they've been doing already . 656905_663825
does anyone have a response to that ? 664345_665805
why would John Brown maybe disagree with that ? 667225_672705
that the old methods are better . 672845_674145
I cannot hear anything that you're saying with your hand in front of your mouth . 676405_679045
he could be a more forceful person . 680005_681745
yeah . 682005_682245
it's kind of that, a big kind of just putting a bandaid through it . 685515_689455
maybe he thinks that, maybe he's like, okay, this is the underground railroad it is working out, but this is just the compromise . 689975_697455
it's not like it's going to go on forever or anything . 697735_700215
it has to stop one way or another . 700215_701875
well, he was kind of going a little, he was doing a little bit too much because underground railroad might've not been fast, but it was effective . 716355_723915
and like Frederick Douglass was saying, Frederick Douglass was a slave . 724595_728955
and so he kind of sees what other slave are saying . 729415_732735
I think that John Brown wasn't right to do that because he kind of, in a way did force the civil war to happen . 733155_741415
and slaves had to pay for it because, the civil war was a very bloody war . 741585_748485
and John Brown shouldn't have done that because the underground railroad was working . 749585_755465
if not fast, it was effective . 755685_757565
and sooner or later the civil war was going to happen . 757785_761445
but in eighteen-fifty-nine, did they know that ? 761685_763345
did they know that the civil war would happen ? 763385_765125
no . 765725_766525
I mean, Frederick Douglass does in the document because he wrote it after the fact . 767045_771045
but in eighteen-fifty-nine, did anyone know the civil war would happen ? 771485_774545
no . 774965_775825
no .
so John Brown and what S_thirteen is saying, and maybe some of you are agreeing is that eighteen-fifty-nine, John Brown is looking, slavery has been going on for years . 776065_785085
the federal government is just making compromises, they're not doing anything to solve the problem, which is historic . 785445_790705
they did at the constitutional convention . 790865_792345
they're ignoring the problem . 792905_794085
now they're just making compromises to appease people and make them just kind of throw a blanket over everything and ignore the problem . 794625_802605
so in eighteen-fifty-nine, nothing is happening . 803325_806665
nothing is changing . 806945_807705
so he's going to go in and he's going to do something about it . 808005_810445
did that make him insane ? 810625_812085
I mean, it wasn't really his position . 813145_814565
it wasn't really his position to go and do that . 815065_817565
because if he really wanted something to happen, peaceful protesting maybe wouldn't do things fast, but he should have, he should have sent letters . 817565_827165
and worked more, worked harder for doing it the legal way . 827425_833485
and if that wasn't helping, then that's when you start, that's not when you start going to kill people . 833645_837985
but that's when you start, marching up to the White House or wherever the president was saying . 838085_844365
protesting there, being loud, getting notice . 844805_849025
I don't think it was his position to go and raid Harpers Ferry . 849465_853685
that was not his position at all . 854085_855405
those of you that think his plan was the right thing to do . 855845_858145
I want some responses here cause S_five's saying, no, it's it doesn't matter . 858265_861385
I think that maybe he was just trying to take some action because maybe in his opinion, he thought that wasn't as effective as what he was wanting to be doing . 861745_871965
xxx be like, oh, I should do it like ten times more action and be way more effective and more xxx because she's not doing a very good job . 873165_881385
okay .
so he doesn't think the underground railroad is effective . 881885_883825
he wants to do something about it . 884705_885965
the doing something part, is correct . 886105_888405
I'm stuck on the way that he did something . 889425_892865
so does that mean you think he's insane . 892865_894605
yes . 894885_895245
or the plan was insane ? 895585_896725
I understand . 896985_898685
