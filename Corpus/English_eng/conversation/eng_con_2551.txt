&=recordingrelated_conversation alright well welcome all of you to &~th I think we shoulda got a bigger room but we didn't &=laughs:multiple know .
&-uh we'll start off the the defense the way that we typically do in in the department is to have the candidate make a brief statement about his involvement with the topic of the dissertation .
&-uh so would you like to talk about that +/.
yeah +/.
+, very briefly ?
well history of of my involvement with the topic is <is a> is a personal story and since the &-uh since that story has undergone obviously &-uh the attempt of objectification in the process of writing I &-uh chose to to keep this introductory &-uh summary personal &-um in the hope that that will get us going &-uh with the questions .
&{l=READING &-uh I embarked on the journey of this dissertation a long time ago when getting to know the music of Keith Jarrett turned out to be an inspiring musical experience for me .
I was a teenage musician in Germany who was growing up with western classical piano training .
like Jarrett himself I was interested in improvisation jazz and various traditional musics of the world .
I fiddled and played accordion in an Irish band .
I sang Yiddish songs and studied klezmer music .
I composed some minimalist pieces a la Steve Reich on my xylophone .
I was fascinated by Ravi Shankar and bought my first sitar .
&}l=READING &-uh stay with me here for a second this is &-uh going to hafta do something with sitar but also with Keith Jarrett indirectly .
&{l=READING in_order_to learn sitar I contacted a German who had been &~recon recommended to me as the authority on Indian music in Frankfurt .
I visited him and he accepted me graciously as his student under one condition that I would give up all the other instruments I played focusing exclusively on the arduous study of the sitar .
this premise seemed absurd to me and that was the first and last time I saw this man .
I wanted Indian music to be part of my musical world rather than my new and perhaps better musical home .
very innocently I wanted everything .
I was looking for differences and multiplicity .
I was searching for a collage of sounds that I perceived as unusual and off the main stream .
actually later on I would study sitar with one of Ravi Shankar's disciples who encouraged his western students not to &~aban abandon their western instruments .
it was in this climate that I encountered Jarrett's music .
the first record was solo concerts Bremen Lausanne .
here was a pianist but he seems to hear and play everything .
he played the world and put it on a piano .
moreover he played with body and soul not with the kind of restrained classical &~de demeanor I had been taught .
his prize of ecstasy while playing gave voice to my own desire to find myself and to be different .
as a postwar German I shared in a particular identity crisis with &~m many in my generation .
those of us who perceived the problem of being German or perhaps being German as a problem hadta figure out who we were in light of an unspeakable history that had given all attributes of inhumanity a German face .
Germany was the topography of the most despicable violation of everything that civilization stood for .
consequently we were desperately searching to reconnect with the good German history one that valued tolerance and respect for other cultures .
we desired to place ourselves in a global perspective a world view built on acceptance curiosity for otherness and fruitful exchange .
my musical choices were part of this search .
Jarrett's music especially the solo concerts connected to the European heritage while also offering an escape from it .
Jarrett the piano recitalist continued a revered tradition but also appeared as a rebel who revolutionized it .
the next steps in discovering Jarrett's music were his recordings with the so+called European quartet .
Jarrett's compositions for this ensemble were of a decidedly lyrical expression with singable melodies and almost folklike &~har harmonic turns .
the instrumentation piano saxophones bass and drums and the element of improvisation belong to the American tradition of jazz .
Jarrett's play with crossing stylistic delineations addressed my own desire for a multicultural globally conscious identity .
Jarrett's work with the American quartet showed him playing multiple instruments and emphasizing free improvisation .
using many instruments Jarrett later produced &-uh folklike recordings .
folk and free jazz were the poles of Jarrett's aesthetic horizon .
the same horizon within which I tended to define myself .
finally Jarrett's classical recordings and compositions added another layer in a multistylistic collage again connecting to my own training in western music .
Jarrett's jazz standards recordings also frequently display a classicizing aesthetic that is for instance the use of baroquelike@n$adj quotations over bebop quotations .
Jarrett's jazz is performed as a chamber musical product for the concert stage .
this predilection appeals to European audiences who generally come to jazz from a classical western background .
in short I began as a listener a fan if you will .
Jarrett's music fit my own predilections and so to speak my identity needs .
the multiple layers however also set up a game of hide and seek with conflicting images .
musical hybridity and paradox are cornerstones of Jarrett's artistic persona .
Jarrett the world musician the explorer of ethnic sound sources other than the piano still plays informed by western by notions of form sound quality and harmony .
Jarrett the improvising solo pianist on the other hand applies principle principles of formal construction remarkably similar to North Indian Raga performances which became popular in the West at the time of Jarrett's formative years the late sixties .
Jarrett the jazz improviser alludes to Bach and Mozart rather than Charlie Parker .
researching articles on Jarrett's work as_well_as interviews revealed an often defensive individualist who made at times outrageous and pejorative statements about other artists very self-confident statements about himself mysterious and ambiguous comments about the nature of art and the realm of metaphysics and critical statements about the world of music apart from himself .
I discovered that Jarrett tends to be received at extreme poles of evaluation .
there is little middle ground people adore him or abhor him .
he is often taken to be provocative .
my musical hero was caught in a web of controversies .
having been cautioned not to glorify him in my own project I took my distance and became frustrated myself at times disillusioned with many of Jarrett's statements and the images they transported .
I realized that analyzing and seeking to understand that which looked puzzling upon confronting Jarrett's music would be my angle of engagement .
as I emerge at this end of the process I find that much of the controversies around Jarrett had at least as much to do with media and market forces as with himself .
in our interviews he has addressed many of the issues that have sparked controversy in a very thoughtful manner .
he has been seen for instance as someone who self-servingly refuses to acknowledge his musical lineage instead emphasizing his own musical genius .
with me he was humble and eager to talk about his many influences .
under public scrutiny for more than thirty years he has nonetheless managed to do quote exactly what I want to do .
the contrasting images of Jarrett have allowed him to engage with a &~vi wide variety of aesthetic approaches to traverse a wide musical terrain without giving up the idea of unifying this diversity by forging it into his own recognizable style .
in the dissertation I observed Jarrett's chosen musical areas attempting to explain their crossstylistic elements and how Jarrett assembles his musical collage .
these areas are and so dealt with in the different chapters his use of multiple instruments between folk and free jazz his solo improvisations his jazz performances classical performances and compositions .
as the writing itself is closing a circle I find myself reconciled with my protagonist enriched by a deeper understanding of how various elements are brought together in an intricate and colorful soundscape an artist's musical journey that remains an inspiration for me .
&}l=READING .
gee I feel like clapping &=laughs:multiple .
that was really great .
okay alright well now we'll get down to the hard part .
&=laughs:multiple .
okay we'll go around the table and we'll &-uh &-uh ask questions make comments whatever so Bob you wanna start ⌈ with you ⌉ ?
⌊ sure ⌋ alright .
well Christoph &-um just a_couple_of of details here &-uh +...
&-uh I wonder if you'd comment &-uh &-uh &~d page one sixty five I &-uh please &~i &~i it was one of those &-uh sort_of moments where you know I was reading reading through your stuff and <you were> &=laughs:S2 you were ⌈ talking ⌉ .
⌊ one ⌋ sixty five looks like this .
oh &=laughs:multiple .
you've got a different .
oh one forty five I'm sorry .
okay .
yeah +/.
+, I was thinking you know .
yeah well I xxx .
you have the only different &=laughs:multiple .
&-um I I you know when we first started to discuss this &-uh project in +//.
or at least when you gave your &-uh your your colloquium I know one of the the issues that was &-uh &-uh sort_of floating around in my mind at the time was was the question of sort_of historical context chronology and and so forth .
and of_course you've chosen to do a &-uh a a nonchronological approach although we do get a a nice biographical sketch of Jarrett at the very beginning .
but &-um you know there there seem to be so many changes in his career &-uh of position and interest and so forth so that when for instance I came to this &-uh this portion I believe you were talking about a concert that took place in +//.
this is the Kyoto concert of nineteen seventy six or +/.
yeah +/.
+, whenever &-uh and and you say &-um you quote him about making the piano sing you're talking about his vocalizations and and so forth &{l=READING I want the notes to &~flo fly naturally float in the air &}l=READING and so forth &{l=READING that's the only thing that interests me .
&}l=READING the the thing that brought me up short a little bit and I'm not trying to catch you on anything but I wonder if you'd just comment on it was &~th &~th the date of the quote was sixty nine which is quite a bit before that particular concert .
and I just wonder the extent to which with somebody who's been so &-uh publicly available and who has made so many pronouncements some of them contradicting each_other how do you know when something that he says at a particular time it can be applied to things &-uh later in his career ?
+, mhm +/.
+, I &-uh in this case I was looking for something closer in proximity to the Kyoto concert <I mean> seven years may not be a big deal but then I thought of it as a more global issue so I wonder if you'd just talk about that .
mhm .
actually the this particular &-uh element of of Jarrett wanting to make the piano sing like a voice &-uh is one that he has &-uh expressed and keeps expressing today &-um &-uh throughout his career .
I guess I chose that &-uh particular quote &-um &~bec because I found it the most eloquent of those +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that ⌋ address that issue &-uh but maybe it would &-uh make the point &-uh better to to include that there are very unrelated interview situations where he keeps making the same point so that it's obviously important to him .
but I think on a deeper level your question brings up that &-uh the whole relationship between those &-uh changing images between the different aspects of his work or the different eras of his work and the underlying &-um &-uh &~con consistency &-um &-uh not to catch Jarrett as a as somebody who intentionally plays with those images but in the process of researching it &-uh what what became more and more dominant to me is how little changes +/.
+, ⌈ hm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-uh ⌋ in the overall scheme of things how many of the attitudes carry through seemingly very &-uh diverse areas and &-uh for me <that's not> that's not a criticism that's in some ways maybe what he expresses when he says I do exactly what I want to do and &-um &-uh +...
for instance the idea &-um this idea of classicizing that I talk about &-uh in the dissertation classicizing jazz improvisation or or building up an &-uh &-uh an aura of a &-uh a notion of artistry that we more commonly associate with western classical music &-um &-uh that carries through many different &-uh musical arenas that he &~e engages with .
for instance I at one point I quote him saying even about this &-uh folk project &-uh the Spirits project where he overdubs himself on recorders and and all kinds of instruments &-um &-uh that he saw himself very much as <as a> as a composer &-uh rather than a folk musician .
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um and all the the attributes that he brings to that notion of being a composer are very much part of &-um of &-uh western classical history and and I I try to be careful not to &~s to use that as a value judgment I and I try to not say oh he tries to &-um to edify the jazz image &-uh by +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ becoming ⌋ this classical &-uh genius &-um &-uh although those perspectives have been mapped onto &-uh what he has done in that area .
so even though it looks very different on the one side to &-uh to do free completely free improvisations than to record these multitrack &-uh folklike &-uh vignettes and then to go out and play jazz standards &-uh even though that looks very different +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, &-uh and is very different in terms of the the the musical arena he engages in but it seems to be very consistent with &-uh with a few attitudes that actually he has held constant over the course of his career and and one of those is that he hates the piano even though as a +//.
that he is a pianist and this &=laughs:multiple idea this idea of making the piano sing making it be like a saxophone or like a voice &-uh is is almost a a metaphoric &-um &-uh manifestation of this idea of wanting to overcome the piano +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ wanting ⌋ to overcome the the &-uh the mechanical &-uh aspect of it the distance from the sound production &-uh that that this mechanism of the piano &~in &~in involves .
well I'd be &~u I mean it's a good good response I I guess I'm looking for something even &~littl just a little more on the technical side +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I think ⌋ it would be a good idea to +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, to let your readers know since there's a somewhat kaleidoscopic &-uh impression created by reading the dissertation +/.
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ from ⌋ front to back +/.
+, right +/.
+, and it's almost as if you know you get the feeling well you know a a writer could &-uh &-uh decide that &-uh he or she +/.
+, ah +/.
+, well in your case he &-uh wanted to reinforce something so well here this +/.
+, ⌈ right from there ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ quote ⌋ bang you know it's just sort_of &-uh &~th that kind of stuff .
okay well that's &-uh &~th I think you could strengthen your case +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, a little if if if you were to do that .
now another one &-uh and this your your opening statement &-uh addressed quite quite nicely I thought but since you and I talked about this this morning among other things I &-uh I wonder if you could just say a bit in this form about the subject of +//.
&-uh which I addressed in my &-uh evaluation for Rackham &-uh coming away with a bit of a feeling that &-uh after you had done all this work on your your boyhood idol and torn away all his masks and everything that that somehow &-uh you you didn't quite have the respect for him that you had when you started off .
and I I I didn't really have that feeling earlier on .
but I &~it when you got into the the later part and the self-construction and all of that in the marketing of Jarrett and so forth somehow I came away feeling that either you you had <felt your> felt him a somewhat diminished figure or you weren't sort_of beefing up .
&=laughs or you weren't explaining to your readers that in fact you you were &~e equally committed to &-uh his work after the illusions had been &-uh shattered or the masks trampled upon or you_know whatever metaphor you want to use there .
so I mean obviously you you said today and you told me this morning that you kind_of put the whole thing back whole .
but could you say a little bit about that ?
I_mean I I I just think that we +//.
I don't think it's a case of &-uh having to do a whole lot on this .
but if you do feel as if you you came out_of this with a renewed understanding for for Jarrett &-uh &-uh and a great appreciation for his artistry that you could say a little more on that .
and I +//.
let let me add just one more thing which I didn't think of this morning when I was saying <but I> but I went back and looked at this I'm not sure that in any of your comments on specific pieces that I take away an impression of your saying this is fantastic this is really &=laughs:S2 this is great &=laughs .
I mean you know I I mean you you you &~sa you say this is the process that's going on and so forth but I'm I'm not looking for xxx anything smarmy or sentimental or whatever but it's like you're really on guard to show that I don't know what exactly <it's a> it's a vexed it's a slightly vexed position I think .
it is .
&=laughs it is a slightly vexed &-uh position &-uh my choosing to to do the opening statement this way &-uh was trying to trace the the circle that that story made &-uh <I think> &~a I think that at first I ran into problems and and &-um and these things were articulated &-uh &-uh by the committee and also from &-um &-uh from not having enough distance you know &-uh to <to the> to the topic or to to him +/.
mhm +/.
+, but by really &-uh by coming to it as &-uh as a musician who liked his work you know I mean a few years back I I &-uh would have said I I listen to to a_lot_of it and it moves me and so forth but that was the extent of my +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you ⌋ know yeah he's a really influential musician for me but it hadta do with musicianship <and &-uh> and &-uh likes and dislikes which are &-uh very admittedly subjective so &-um so that's were I was ⌈ coming from ⌉ .
⌊ he had ⌋ fundamental .
yeah .
okay .
yeah &-um I I think you're right I think you're reading it right &~y &~y &~ya that there was trying to avoid that kind of &-uh &-uh exclamation mark &-uh at the end of my phrases .
and &-uh and the the process of coming full circle with which I concluded the opening remark is still a very young &-uh &-uh process it's it's still very recent &-um and part of it hasta do with the fact that &-uh that the interviews that we had &-uh were so different from from how interviews are radiated in in magazines .
&-uh and &-uh I asked him about this in fact it all started by me +//.
my asking him why he wanted +//.
why the heck he wanted to talk to me I mean because he really doesn't need to and so forth .
and and he said that he likes it when &-uh when interviewers aren't out &-uh to get him or or to get something you know to get something that then &-uh &-uh four weeks later comes up in the magazine as him having said some outrageous thing and and &-uh you know and &-uh &~he &~he very candidly would address &-uh things of that nature that he has said outrageous things and he has contradicted himself and so what ?
you know we do it people do it it happens .
and &-um &-uh in conversation &-uh with me &-uh because I I I wasn't coming from +//.
I wasn't hired to do this .
I wasn't doing it for a deadline project next week to have it published .
I wasn't out to catch some &-uh provocative remark .
&-uh he seemed to &-uh feel less defensive .
so &~m my perspective &-uh &-uh on a_lot_of those comments that have stirred controversy around him &-uh have to do with also looking at the process of how those comments were made and &-uh and and &-um in which situation they <were maked and how> were made and how they were sparked .
so &-um &-uh having had the interviews &~ar &-uh is certainly an experience that is that is part of &-uh &~rec rectifying some of that +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, &-uh for me of of putting things in perspective .
I mean &~th there are issues that &~s that &-uh he was said to simply avoid publicly &-uh that that he was very at ease talking about such as this whole deal about &-um you know him only &~hi him always saying +"/.
&-uh I'm not influenced by anyone &-um I'm my own influence and this kind of thing .
which of_course itself <is a> is a tradition and and and has a history &-uh among musicians so what I'm trying to do &-um &~i in the dissertation is &-uh &~expl &-uh or show <what it> what it does .
that's right I'm I'm trying to show the process of &-uh what effects that has or for instance of of showing that tradition and Bill Evans used to say the same thing &-uh I don't comment about the contemporary scene I don't really listen to other jazz musicians I listen to old music .
and and he and what it does to to construct that as an &-um as a as an artistic persona and I I do accept that even using those terms construction and artistic persona &-uh makes it sound very &-uh sort_of intentional &-uh like he's trying to manipulate some image that he has on his drawing board at home and now he goes about it in the public arena in_order_to construct that image .
and that of_course isn't the case most of the time that's just a a &~bypo product of what what happens <with this> &-uh with this product .
and I think &-uh you're also right in detecting that that process of <wanting to> &-um wanting to describe the effects and wanting to describe the process &-uh of these &{l=SIC phenomenons &}l=SIC &-uh takes away from the impulse &-uh of the the aesthetic commitment or or enthusiasm <that I> that I bring to it .
&-um &-uh most of all because &-uh I was trying to reach a point where that wouldn't matter &~w whether I like him or don't like &~u even though of_course &~i it'll impact how I write but &-um I was trying to &-uh to get away from that and I think I'm only now at the point where I can let myself like him &=laughs:S3 as much as I do again +...
thanks .
okay alright John xxx .
yeah &-um let me ask you some some technical things that's <on the> on the the note guide here &-um +...
there're a bunch &~there there're many little things in here I'd like you to just take a look at +/.
mhm +/.
+, but &-um would you look at sixty three for a minute ?
+, xxx ⌊ had them <by side> by side ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ &-um xxx <in the> in the ⌉ middle of the in the middle of the &-uh page where you talk about All Right ?
+, mhm +...
+, and you give this harmonic analysis &-um I I'm really puzzled by what you said here because you've written the music you've notated the music in e@l flat but you analyze a chord progression which in e@l flat I would've called five one four .
that's two five one in a@l flat .
&-um and at that point you don't really feel a@l flat has been has has taken over as the tonic do you ?
I mean this piece is still really really clearly in e@l flat major right ?
ah .
&-um &-uh &~i &~di &~y did you listen to it on the tape ?
yeah .
I I I I really did I do hear it as a@l flat major and in fact one of the reasons why &-uh why I chose the key signature of three flats instead of four flats is &-uh the predominance of the the Lydian scale in a@l flat with the &~rai raised fourth +/.
mm +/.
+, so I I I mean I might as well have written it with four flats and then added the natural signs to where the d@l-s are .
+, ⌊ really ?
hm ⌋ +/.
+, I mean to me the the the cycling point the point at which the point of return is is a@l flat .
hm .
well this this to me just sounds like a million tunes through jazz history that start on four chords .
okay .
&-um you know there're tons of blues tunes for instance chop off the first four bars of a blues and use the last eight bars twice +/.
okay +/.
+, so they start on a four and they go four five one four five one and then something like a bridge +/.
+, ⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and then ⌋ something else so this didn't this to me +/.
+, ⌈ didn't didn't make sense in a@l flat ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ didn't ever never ⌋ it never threatened e@l flat as the key .
alright .
but maybe I I I don't know maybe maybe I'm I'm wrong .
in any case you said shortly after this the ruling key signature A +/.
⌈ a@l flat major yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ flat major of ⌋ course it isn't .
okay +/.
+, yeah &-uh I mean that's &-um &-uh &-uh I I that's an easily fixable &-uh +/.
+, ⌈ I think ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ accentuation ⌋ because I'm the the point that I'm actually trying to make is &-uh that one dominant key signature isn't &~aban is never abandoned .
+, mhm +/.
+, right it's never threatened and &-uh &-uh if it makes more sense harmonically to &-uh since it ends on e@l flat &-um &~a and to think of the a@l flat chord as a four chord to start with &-um the argument is the same +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ the ⌋ the the numerals are different .
yeah .
well &-uh &-uh right but I mean it's like a world of difference +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to me ⌋ right ?
when somebody says two five one and I'm hearing five one four +/.
+, ⌈ okay right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ it's really different ⌋ so I think if you really do hear it that way I mean I'd I'd I'd be willing to let you hear it that way that's fine &=laughs:multiple but I think the invocation of something I mean even to say in here something about the you know the the +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, sort_of Lydian a@l flat +/.
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ character ⌋ of this +/.
+, mhm +/.

+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ although ⌋ you know the d@l flats do appear so +/.
+, yes +/.
+, okay &-um am I going on here ?
go ahead yeah .
okay here's another thing about keys .
page seventy two +...
&-uh this piece +...
&-uh seems to have practically no B naturals in it +...
mhm +/.
+, right ?
+, right +/.
+, now why is +//.
why didn't you just notate this with one flat then ?
<is this> is this do you +//.
is this somehow a a a Lydian F or a Dorian D or something it doesn't sound anything like it to me +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, but here again +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I mean ⌋ you're you're hearing this with different and better informed ears than I am but I I just don't see why this isn't in on e@l flat ?
and why these all these accidental b@l flats +/.
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ have ⌋ disappeared ?
I I I think what's what's happening is that &-um &-uh you know that &~i it's it's the same &-uh principle that we talked about with the the a@l flat I mean I accept your argument that the a@l flat wasn't &-uh &-uh the best solution to to &-uh take <as a> as a &~start harmonic starting point +/.
mhm +/.
+, but &-uh the a@l flat &~a a@l flat with the sharp four would eliminate the d@l flat +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, and it's it's a similar situation here with a B &-uh flat .
I I think of D minor now so predominantly as not the Aeolian but the &-uh the Dorian mode +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that's ⌋ and and and <when I> &-uh when I compose &-uh &~th this is how it started I I would save myself the hassle of putting the b@l flat in .
and maybe that's a little too ⌈ shorthand ⌉ .
⌊ <well we've been using> ⌋ this hassle for six or eight hundred years &=laughs:multiple .
okay &-uh &~you you're right I ⌈ &~sh I'll I will introduce the xxx ⌉ &=laughs .
⌊ if we just went through this ⌋ from a purely statistical point of view <I mean> I mean you <think of> think of you know Bartok pieces where he'll use a key signature &-uh on e@l flat and one sharp simply because he even though it's not conventional it does describe the picture right ?
right +/.
+, in some economical way .
so I +//.
to me not not doing that seems ⌈ seems odd ⌉ .
⌊ okay ⌋ okay .
⌈ okay ⌉ ?
can I ask you just a couple more things ?
yeah .
go .
&-um .
&~a &~y you're right especially in a context &-uh <where it is so> &~diaton where it is so so diatonical +/.
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ through ⌉ the piece throughout I mean ⌊ &-um ⌋ .
⌈ well ⌉ you know there are there is the like the the A minor ninth chord with a B in it and you know it's just in there for color it's not +/.
mhm +...
+, that's and <there're all> there're all those b@l flats that are the roots of four chords too so +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, &-uh can you &-uh let's let's go to My Funny Valentine +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, to to one sixty one where that where after the introduction .
+, mhm +/.
+, why don't you zip through this introduction ?
it's funny &~how however ruminative it may be +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, it just really whips through it fast .
it's interesting .
anyway tell me what what it is you're trying to tell the reader with these chord symbols .
&-um &-uh at some point in the analysis later on I'm &-uh &-uh I'm talking about how &-uh how Jarrett &-uh contrasts the the &-um the standard chord changes of of the head with &-um +/.
with what he ⌊ actually played ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ with with what ⌉ he actually plays over it and to to see that contrast I thought it was beneficial &~a add the symbols to &-um +/.
+, okay +/.
+, &~a but what I'm realizing as you speak &-uh what is really an omission is that I didn't give a a a a legend that would &~ex explain my is that the word ?
legend ?
+, ⌊ sure ⌋ +/.

so I need to I ⌊ need to add ⌋ .
⌈ well I'm ⌉ not sure that that's necessary but I think it really is necessary like look at the third measure of the head here you've got what you call a C minor seventh chord there's no b@l flat in it but there is an A .
right but but &~tha &-uh +/.
⌊ ah &+bu but how ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ what I'm trying to say ⌉ .
but how do I know that reading this ?
<if you're> if you're saying look at the way Jarrett's actual realization of the piece contrasts with the way the piece was composed +/.
okay +/.

+, yeah +/.
+, but that needs to be said +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ really ⌉ overtly because there's so many places where these chords symbols +/.

⌈ right ⌉ absolutely yeah .
&-uh and I I mean <they're just> they're just it's &~j absolutely full of them +/.

⌈ yeah it's there I mean I ⌉ .

⌊ &-um ⌋ (0.5) okay well &~tha that's gonna resolve a_lot_of this because I'm I was just looking at this and I'm thinking well you know &~th there's an e@l flat major seven yeah but the bass is sitting down on d@l flat &=laughs +/.
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ for ⌋ two bars .
+, right +/.
+, but but since you're referring back to the original of this then that brings up one other thing .
&~c <may I> may I &-uh +/.
⌈ sure ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ interject ⌋ one thing &~th &~the one of my bigger arguments about Jarrett the jazz improviser is that <he uses> &-um he uses the &-uh the format of these jazz standards +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, as a basis &-uh for some minimally restricted free improvisation .
+, mhm +/.
+, and &~a this is this harkens back to what you were saying &-uh &-uh about how different certain aspects of his career look and my arguing that there is a very strong underlying continuity and one of the continuities is fascination with free improvising with not preparing anything .
+, mhm +/.
+, so all you need to do from his perspective &-um to play this music is &-uh these three guys know the changes for My &~la Funny Valentine he starts playing his intro he plays eight measures of the head that's all we need to know +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, to know that we are dealing with My Funny Valentine and off he goes &~an &-uh and and the the the way he stays within the chord changes and then &~m moves outside of them and then on top of it adding this these extensions these freely improvised extros@n$v to +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to ⌋ to the music &-um &-uh really point towards the fact that it's not about playing successive strands of thirty two bar choruses that it's really about just using this as a minimal launching point for free improvisation and to point that out I intended to to show how strongly they disagree how strongly what he does with it &-uh disagrees with the standard changes that +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, that outline the piece .
well that's that's that's perfectly fine I think that's that's a good thing to do .
one last thing I wanted to ask you about this is why you quote the Real Book version of this piece rather than the original music .
okay .
+, the Real Book version &-uh I mean this may be the way a whole lot of people these days learn this piece +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, but &-um +...
+, it's not the ⌈ original ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ well ⌋ it's not the original and for instance the Real Book version doesn't doesn't have the chromatically descending bass line which &~y I ⌈ mean ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ right .
which everybody does anyway ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ clearly it's ⌉ it's implied and it doesn't have like the you know the G here and the the e@l flat here and all this stuff &~th &~th +/.
+, right +/.
+, that we all go out and do on Saturday night .
+, right +/.
+, &-um I'm wondering if it would make more sense just to quote the original of the original of the piece or conceivably even this and the original .
okay .
I think that's a very good suggestion .
at this point in my argument &-uh &~i &-uh the the reason for the Real Book version &-uh was &-um my talking about rhythmic displacements +/.
mhm +/.
+, of of notes &-uh so I wasn't for instance concerned about the harmonies +/.
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ in fact ⌉ I could have wiped out the chord changes for this .
that that wasn't what I was going after at this point .
it was about rhythmic &~dip displacement of the melody +/.

+, &-uh &-uh is that different in the original +/.
+, no +/.
+, music as well ?
well it may be different in some +/.
⌊ mhm mhm ⌋ +/.

&-um my other stuff is just little little nitpicky fussy stuff that you can deal with at your leisure .

this book is illegal to begin with .

mhm .
mhm .
and that's legal .
and people have to come to you for the +/.
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ copy ⌉ .
they can't sell it .
yeah .
&-uh it's just &-uh I haven't had the time to go through that whole process .
you just asked +//.
I'm still a little unclear about the role of free jazz and all of <in in> in in in in &-um whatever you know what I mean by that .
&-um in in in &-uh in in the way in which you've described this because &-um you allude to to Ornette Coleman at a number of places and then you discuss rather interestingly Paul Bley .
and I just wonder how how they &-uh they really function in this because part of the problem was brought up by Jarrett's own statements as you've &~j already mentioned a_couple_of times that it's his denial quote unquote <of his> of his roots and then your &-uh &-uh searching for the historical background of his work and I suppose that part of this would +//.
one would've never attempted part of this is if he hadn't said these things .
&-um but &~w <&~w &~w> &~w &~w what is interesting here is for instance you talk about if I remember correctly about the two saxophone work as being going back to Ornette Coleman and that puzzled me that is I don't still don't understand you mentioned Coleman's influence a number of times but you never specify what it is if I remember correctly except for that one statement .
and that puzzled me because you referred to &~f to the double quartet but this isn't really a two saxophone front line that's it's a four instrument &~fr front line and the two saxophones don't have any particular +/.
mhm +/.
+, &-uh a role in that and it seems to me that at least in the fifties and sixties two saxophone front lines were rather common and the kind of interplay you're talking about was much more &-uh &-uh prominent in in actually in more traditional forms of &~beeb sort_of neobop or hard bop and so forth or +//.
&-uh there were so many &-uh double saxophone groups especially tenor groups at the time and so forth .
I wondered why you chose Ornette &~Col that that that is the only influence I remember of Ornette Coleman that you actually mention specifically <in it> .
why that ?
mhm .
&-um &-uh &-uh your your comment brings out +//.
your question brings out that I need to be more precise &-uh &-uh on on why I'm &-uh &-uh drawing that comparison .
it's actually not about having two two saxophones specifically it's about having two lead wind instruments &-um &-uh &-uh that &-uh are &-uh set in an instrumentation that avoids piano .
so &-um &-uh Coleman's ensembles with &-uh Don Cherry on trumpet &-uh are are just as much a resource for me than the double quartets &~be because the issue is &-uh free improvisation in a setting &-uh in which two melodic &-uh &-uh improvisers play simultaneously &-uh with &-uh without the the chordal underpinnings of of of the piano .
if I remember correctly <you you> you you specifically referred to to free jazz with the two saxophone for for his work with Charles Lloyd .
and +/.
mhm +/.
+, that is not a very good example because &-uh that's a four instrument front line actually and &-uh the the two trumpets it's a double ⌊ quartet ⌋ .
⌈ mhm ⌉ yeah ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ where ⌉ is that Nicolas ?
&-uh I don't have ⌊ the page number yeah &-uh &-uh &-um ⌋ .
⌈ yeah I know you don't have the page number I mean is it ⌉ .
it's early on in the ⌊ dissertation ⌋ .
⌈ which it's in chapter one isn't it ⌉ ?
⌊ I'm sorry ⌋ yes I think so but it it seems to me if you start you you &~le didn't articulate it that way and so perhaps you might want to make it clearer because then of_course you get into the whole Gerry Mulligan Chet Baker quartet .
and also in the more free jazz vein with two &-uh wind &~instrum &-uh &-uh &-uh two &-uh mm &-uh woodwind instruments you've got there was a group &-um that Prince Lasha you know a post &~C Ornette kind of thing Prince Lasha and Sonny Simmons had which had two saxophones or even one played English horn and the other one played alto clarinet .
they were multiinstrumentalists all of them in fact but unusual ones because they played double reeds and and alto clarinet which hardly anyone plays that &-um made quite a &~num &-uh &~qu some interesting recordings at the time and so forth .
so there was much more of that going on .
and and that would <probably not> +//.
but the other thing is is it brings me to another question which in a way elliptically leads back to Saint Vitus Paul Bley's influence .
because you know one thing that I found missing here is Paul Bley had a &~quarte &~ha two groups one of which you mention only in passing which is relevant here which is that the origin of the &-um Ornette Coleman quartet is actually the Paul Bley quintet .
right +/.
+, &-um and the other one is &~hi his next group which which was a quartet with John Gilmore Gary Peacock and Paul Motian .
&-um and that is essentially very much &-uh &-uh the not only the instrumentation of his American and other quartet but if you listen to it the singsong melodies the combination of kind of free jazz and standards and so forth but it it's a fascinating +//.
this is from nineteen sixty eight sixty nine &-um this group because we now think of &-uh of Paul Bley (be)cause of his ECM recordings and so forth but his early work is quite different +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, and is part of the neglected roots of quote unquote free jazz actually .
and &-um .
&~we &-uh the album Footloose that I talk about is &-uh I don't know the date offhand but it is one of the early ⌈ ones ⌉ .
⌊ it's a trio ⌋ recording though +/.
right +/.
+, the thing &~wa that he he &-uh Bley had his own record company for a while Improvising Artists in which he released &-uh these live recordings of with Ornette Coleman &~s from from before Ornette made any recordings with Atlantic but also he &~re he released &-um some some &-uh concert recordings &~wi of this quartet with John Gilmore &~w then with Sun &~R became essentially Sun Ra's tenor saxophone player for for the rest his life .
and it's surprisingly &-uh &-uh it's surprising how &~in <how how> how how how &-uh similar in concept this quartet is to at least the &~s &~s some of &-uh Jarrett's quartet recordings .
+, mhm +/.
+, so &-uh when you say that Paul Bley's influence &-uh on on Jarrett has been underestimated &-uh I think you might want to probe a little deeper into this +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, because Bley is also a kind of chameleonlike figure .
+, mhm +/.
+, he has this &-uh this &-uh &-uh romantic &-uh &~tr standard side and as_well_as &-uh as as this free jazz &~im free improvisation side .
and &~an &~an and also a cantankerous &-uh &=laughs +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, self &-uh &-um sort_of &-uh presentation side to him which in many ways parallels Jarrett of_course +/.
+, right which I address actually +/.
+, yes .
well in his case it's sort_of slightly &-uh colored by a kind of bitterness of lack of recognition +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, rather than overexposure but +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, &-um but &~y &~y you might want to expand that a little bit because I think you you lean towards it but you don't &~re &~de dig deep into it .
the other thing I would suggest +//.
&-um remember I mentioned to you that &-uh when you talk about Braxton solo work &~i I I'm &~a &~a as the background <for for> for for for for Jarrett I I wonder if you wouldn't want to &-um &~s locate it historically just a little more precisely .
that is the influence that Braxton seems to have had not just on Jarrett but on others instrumentalists of the time that is when this whole &~s this whole &-uh fashion for solo recordings started .
&-uh practically everyone acknowledges Braxton when you &-uh &~jus &-uh Evan Parker &-uh Steve Lacy all these people say that they started doing this because they heard Braxton doing this .
and it's not only in recordings it was Braxton's solo concerts .
you're talking about wind players .
wind players yes &~b <but &-uh> but &-uh but there're also pianists of_course who were doing this since time immemorial &-uh but but but this idea of recording these solo album lengths so I mean in Braxton's case they were all double albums &-uh of of solo work and also Braxton talks about this extensively in the liner notes to to &-uh his &-uh &~s &~s second or third long one the &-um what is it nineteen seventy nine +/.
mhm +/.
+, so he he actually expresses very cogently his reasons for doing this which you might +/.
+, uhuh +/.
+, &~wan &~wan want to &-uh look into +/.
+, ⌈ yes ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but ⌋ but it actually became as you point out kind_of a rite of passage among the AACM that people hadta give these solo concerts .
and Muhal Richard Abrams also did them +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, on piano &-uh and recorded a number of them but in Japan (be)cause nobody would record him +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, in the States so &-uh but I I I would like to see you if you're if &~y if you want to pursue this to to to really contextualize this just a little bit more +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, that is &~wha &~wha what was going on because &-uh &~th &~th this was a determined effort it wasn't just a a chance thing that some people were making solo +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ recordings ⌋ &~a and <doing this> and and and especially among the AACM people there were ideological &~reas or he stated ideologic reasons for this .
&-um but but but Braxton's about &-uh &~bu-bu &~bu but &-uh to me Jarrett's about the only one who doesn't say specific quite the opposite &~s I just got this from the spheres rather than saying that +/.
+, ⌈ actually you know &~tha &~i ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <there was this very> ⌋ specific .
yeah this was one of the the things I I haven't completely transcribed the &-uh the the interviews with him yet but this was very specifically something that he did &~ad did address &-uh &-um &-uh saying that the AACM and &-uh that he was looking at the AACM at the time as as something interesting musically <that he> that he drew from .
I mean he &-uh I was surprised by how little shy he was to acknowledge that connection when so many public statements &-uh veer away from that ⌈ so ⌉ .
⌊ well ⌋ this is what surprised me I mean &~i &~i it's interesting that he's more than anyone else he has &-uh I mean of_course the media has used him but he has used the media .
and why is it that he has now switched talking to you he speaks in a completely different tongue ?
no there are lots_of &-uh &~i interviews where he &-uh &-uh talks like that before as well .
it's just the &-uh the ones where &-uh he pronounces his refusal of artistic lineage &-uh are more eye catching or ear catching .
&~the they're simply they they're more heard .
I mean there're plenty plenty of interviews that that express that .
I think &-um they're usually interviews in which he was &-uh felt cornered &-uh &-uh about that issue and I think what's also coming through is that as much as he comes out_of the free &-uh jazz &~e &-uh era and &~i is invested in in in &-uh the processes of freely improvising &-uh he also &-um he he dislikes the interpretation of free jazz as being taken &-uh to be an avoidance of a a a categorical avoidance of harmonic structures and tonal language .
&-um &-uh in other words and and the the when I saw him last week he was dancing around this very carefully to &-uh to make sure he he didn't come out saying that he thinks Roscoe Mitchell is recording what he is recording because he can't play &-uh &-uh within tonal structures or over chord changes or so forth .
but he was he he was avoiding saying that and reverting it back to himself saying +"/.
+" &-um &-uh well &-uh not to pass &~pa pass judgment on on anybody else +...
&-uh I I I guess I was very greedy I guess .
I wanted more I wanted free improvising but I also wanted tonality I also wanted &-uh &-uh harmony .
I also wanted transitory moments of chord changes that then would dissolve again and so forth .
so that there was &-uh clearly this intent to to say &-uh yes this was the the spark that that launched my entire &-uh &-uh idea of how to improvise how to go about playing &-uh but it was also something &-uh that he felt was dissatisfactory to his own tastes that it was that that much of AACMs music &-uh was so clearly defined within &-uh within the parameters of &-uh atonal &-uh nontonal improvisation &-uh sort_of with this cliche of being very dissonant that kind of thing .
so he sought &-uh to to to revert to tonal structures within freely improvised settings rather than &-um seeing those &-uh as exclusives of each_other .
&~we I I I think that he just doesn't listen very much to the Art Ensemble of Chicago or to Lester Bowie's recordings because they especially in their let see after the early sixties their work their whole concerts consist of passages where they do whole +/.
⌈ right I ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ tunes ⌋ and rhythm ⌈ and blues ⌉ .
⌊ I I analyzed ⌋ one of those pieces +/.
yeah +/.
+, actually &~b &~w &~w the reggae piece that &~th that they do on on one of the the &-uh ECM recordings &-um &-uh +...
&~w whether he &-uh &-uh sees that as a judgment of of the Art Ensemble of Chicago or the AACM in general whether that's a broad &-uh &-uh perspective <&-uh I don't> &-uh I don't know .
I I can't judge that from what he's told me but &-uh &~b but the impression that I get is that he got very tired of a certain sound of free jazz and &-uh was very vocal about it .
and in his case it led to him avoiding &-uh &-uh naming the AACM as some revolutionary impulse on him &-um because he didn't care for much of the music that came out_of that &-uh but yet was very impressed with the impulses that led to that music and tried to &-uh and saw himself very much in the same context as that .
(0.4) .
do you think he's manipulating you ?
+, ⌊ no it's not ⌋ it's not I'm I'm not yeah I ask you this quite honestly that is that he talks differently to different &-uh .
no I think we all talk differently to different people but &-um my &~impr my impression was simply that he he was &-uh &-uh he was trying to say that yes he has a_lot to do with that &~w but but he doesn't like much of what came out_of it so he &-uh he didn't make it a big deal in his public statements to say yes I owe a_lot to AACM +/.
mm +/.
+, or I owe a_lot to this &-uh impulse of of free jazz because stylistically he went into such a different direction .
maybe that some of these &-uh statements were &-uh &-uh poorly chosen on his part but I'm trying to not evaluate that .
I <I was> I was trying to look at the fact that &-uh he he does acknowledge &-uh an affinity and even an involvement &-uh &-uh with practices that came to the fore through the AACM .
he talked in one interview he talked about &-uh having done a tour with the Art Ensemble of Chicago &-uh in the late sixties which I wasn't aware of where they were traveling from city to city doing the same gigs .
so and and and he wasn't &-uh in any way defensive about acknowledging that I think that &-uh some of these statements &-um of denial have come about as ways of saying &-uh &-uh &-uh &-uh &-uh &~ha have come about as him really feeling that he doesn't like much of that music .
and and the way it comes out is by not saying these are my musical heroes or something like that .
well &~i may I say this that that that as a result that you might want to reintegrate because of the obviously the the interview you did with him or interviews were done at the very end +/.
right +/.
+, it's not fully integrated into the the work +/.
+, ⌊ because ⌋ I I only know of I mean yes I've in passing read his &-uh interviews with him but I really haven't memorized them and I knew them &~on primarily through reading your your work and &-um &-uh the the the notion that +//.
of his denials etcetera of his lineage they came out very forcefully in the way you presented +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ his ⌋ and I had no idea that that that all along he had been saying other things as well &-um and so I I think you have to make because you've made an issue of that and then played against +/.

+, ⌊ that ⌋ so you now have to temper that it seems to me +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, &-um .
good point yeah I I &~th I mean first of all you're right to that I need to integrate my interviews &-uh but also &-uh it's true that I &~f played off of that denial notion because <it is> it is that most visible pole &~o &-uh with from which that controversy &-uh .
right and then it +/.

+, ⌊ struck me that ⌋ now he's saying completely the opposite but now you're only now telling us that he's actually been &-uh saying these +/.
+, ⌈ right right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ contradictory things ⌋ all along .
what I do in the text is show that there are &-uh that there is another side to that rather than &-uh putting it into his words that's very true I think what I can add is that &-uh that is not only something that he has done &-uh &-uh throughout his career that it's also something that he has addressed at various points .
and it's &-uh it's interesting .
I'm not &-uh sure whether you're familiar with the Edward Strickland interviews &-uh that were done for the Fanfare Magazine .
&-um &-uh Strickland was very much somebody that &-uh he &~f &-uh whatever were the circumstances of the interview but it was a very &-uh easygoing interview and he liked Strickland and he liked how they were &-um &-uh relating to each_other .
and &-uh it's it tends to be those interviews that he says those kinds of things .
&-uh and it tends to be interviews such as with Jim Aikin in in in the Keyboard Magazine &-uh &-uh where he gets more defensive ⌈ because ⌉ .
⌊ or the ⌋ New York Times Magazine ⌈ <or the> ⌉ .
⌊ right ⌋ right the .
so &~no &~no &~no now Wynton is going to Wynton Marsalis is going to send Stanley Crouch to knock him out &=laughs:multiple .
&-uh I wanted to say &-uh &-uh one more thing about the &-uh Ornette Coleman reference .
&-uh you you went on to the the Bley &-um aspect and I didn't have a chance to comment on that .
&-um &-uh &~y &-uh when you talked about Paul Bley you were talking about how the musicians Bley was with then &-uh &-uh later played with with Jarrett and that you know in_order_to point out how important that that influence is and I agree .
&-uh but that was also one of the reasons why I did choose &-uh &-uh Coleman <as a> as an example because both &-uh Charlie Haden and and Dewey Redman which then were part of &-uh &-um Jarrett's American quartet which really was <the first> the first &~ens ensemble that he &-uh came to a reputation with as a leader &-um were musicians <that had> &-uh that had played with with Coleman .
so my my reference to Coleman is not only that there's some instrumentational similarity going on here &-uh but it's it's in the same manner as the Paul Bley &-uh quintet .
it's &-uh it's a trading of musicians that that went on which &-uh which of_course doesn't only mean that these people bring their their styles &-uh &-uh to to the band .
but it also means that they bring the &~sh conceptually &~sh shared background with them &-um which was forged or &~imp influenced by &-um their work with with Ornette Coleman .
but but but &~i &~i would &~pr like to see if these are suggest that &~you that you dig a little deeper that is &~wh when you say you talk about someone's influence such as Coleman I would like to know what that influence is in purely musical terms and not simply shared musicians the same thing for instance you mentioned Brubeck a number of times that he has acknowledged Brubeck's +/.

okay ?
Christoph &-um now that you have &-uh these extensive you know this volume of liturgies that you've done recently &-um I'm just curious has has he talked about his say his jazz training ?
and I mean we know he went to Berklee +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-um ⌋ &-uh the influences on &~th along those lines I mean like did he transcribe did he ever go through like did he ever talk about going through a period of you know copying like +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, most everyone has done is that something you got into at all ?
+, mhm +/.
+, xxx .
&-um as for &-uh I'm before I answer &-uh &-uh I'm just remembering &-um +...
&-um Gary Bergman saying &~y you know Gary Bergman is &~wh &~wh whatever he is now Associate Dean or Dean of Curriculum I believe at the Berklee School of Music and &-um &-uh you know I associate Berklee with &-uh with &-um a heavy dose of transcriptions and formulaic approaches &-uh to to scalar material and you know &-uh &-uh at CAL Arts we used to call it &-uh the jazz factory you know and and and of setting CAL Arts from that a little bit .
but &-um &-uh however that is it's interesting that &-uh that &-um Gary Bergman said that he never transcribed a single solo and he never &-uh &-uh encourages anyone to transcribe a solo .
&-uh .
yeah but what do Deans have to say about the curriculum ?
&=laughs:multiple .
well anyway the the point that I'm &-um making &-uh there is that &-um &-uh that &~th &~th this issue of &-uh how how do you learn jazz &-um &~is is obviously controversial even among those that teach it as as you know best of all .
but &-um &-uh &-uh he always talked about his jazz learning &-uh with me as a as simply having been &-um playing playing with &-uh with performers playing .
I_mean obviously the the experiences with &-uh Charles Lloyd and and &-uh Miles &{l=SIC David &}l=SIC but &-uh but before also the Blakey experience &-uh &-uh &-uh were crucial for for him .
&-uh the Blakey band mm is often addressed in connection with Jarrett as as having been a band that didn't work out and or Blakey said that himself and that Jarrett somehow didn't fit in it and &-uh and that Jarrett was bored with the rest of the group .
&-um so it's generally being portrayed as some as a bit of a frustrating or a negative experience and &-um &-uh he has acknowledged that also as as a kind_of a school .
nonetheless for him &-uh &-uh not only the experience of actually touring with +//.
that was his first touring ensemble but also &-uh stylistically of fitting in with these &-uh musicians that for him that was a kind_of a training .
mhm +/.
+, so I don't think that &-uh in that in his case was &~ac was ever a matter of &-um &-um &-uh really following through with &-uh transcription and analysis in a very &-uh systematic &-uh &~m &-uh manner apart from performing with people .
+, hm +/.
+, I mean there's a &~h a heavy emphasis on &-uh on you know it's done in the doing +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, it's not done in the classroom .
except yeah yeah &~i it's just interesting because &~y &-uh we know he studied classical music +/.
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ from ⌋ when he was very young and so we have kind_of a clear sense of okay you know you have this and there's this body of literature and you learn it and that but but I mean by time +//.
the thing is when he played with Art Blakey I mean by that time I mean sure I I you know he learned with Blakey and Lloyd and all those people but +/.
+, so what ⌈ happened before ?
what what happened right right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ with (th)em in the first place ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ I mean he had +//.
yeah because he hadta yeah I think you know ⌉ &=laughs &-uh <I'm just> I'm just sorta curious about it I'm not you know &-uh .
how old was he ?
&-uh &-um wait Blakey was &-um sixty five so he was twenty .
I think he may have started sixty four so that would've been nineteen .
he was nineteen when he played ⌊ with Blakey ⌋ .
⌈ nineteen ⌉ .
so just out_of just when he just quit with Berklee or did he ?
yeah &-uh Berklee was &-uh sixty two sixty three .
so he was like seventeen or eighteen when ⌊ that xxx ⌋ .
⌈ &-um right ⌉ yeah yeah .
and I &-uh &-uh really don't quite know how that worked because it occurred to me afterwards that &-um &-um that that doesn't quite work out with high school does it ?
but &-um &~th &~th for instance &~th the +/.
⌊ <that record he had> ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ first ⌉ that record that says &-um his first record &-uh where he plays <in a> in a &-uh big band setting organized &-um &-uh wrote up on the liner notes that he was at Berklee and he in fact wasn't at Berklee yet when that recording was made .
so and and and &-uh I found &-uh conflicting timelines about what year he actually was at Berklee .
some say it was sixty two sixty three some say it was sixty three sixty four and &-uh whenever that first album was made &-uh &-uh some people take take their timeline from that but the problem is +/.
+, ⌊ (be)cause he wasn't ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ that he wasn't ⌉ at Berklee at that time .
I bet you that the problem is academic year versus calendar year we think of calendar years and liner note writers think of &~aca &-uh we think of ⌊ academic years liner note writers think of ⌋ .
⌈ yeah that may be part of the ⌉ yeah yeah .
well but to address that that question how do you get to play with &-um with Art Blakey &-um +...
&-um one thing that he addresses is &-uh listening I &~ge &-uh you_know a_lot_of listening &-uh for instance the &-uh his whole &-uh affirmation of the connection to Paul Bley is &-uh is through this especially this one recording +/.
mhm yeah +/.
+, through through Footloose .
I mean I I can relate to to the idea of &-uh &-uh &-uh of having a very few select albums that you really go crazy over &-uh rather than sort_of &-uh covering a certain canon you know of of something .
I_mean we may look at it as as researchers you know we have you know here's the discography so and so +//.
but &-um &-uh what it seems to boil down to in the learning process is is a few very select records that he just practically memorized and and played with as as he listened .
and and one of those was Footloose by Paul Bley and one of them was Abbey Road by the Beatles .
&=laughs .
because you know he &~s he so comfortable playing you know &~i in &~pl it sounds like he didn't play standards for a while and then just moving into that I mean it's really I mean kind of going back to Bob's point like the I &~mean if I were to say this is just mind+blowing you know like the the the +/.
right ⌊ the standards ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ <My Funny Valentine> ⌉ &-uh it's &~inter I mean (be)cause there's a Miles Davis version of that which also just incredibly unique +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ in ⌉ its own way and &-um and I would put this in that same somewhere in that same +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ ballpark ⌉ it's really I mean and and &~this it just just hearing that again when you &~ga gave us that tape it just struck me how &-uh I mean he &~n he not only played the tune well but it was just just this sense of freedom on the just you know very interesting rhythmic concept but it was some you know <just a> just a layer of improvising +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, on that +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, level that he had attained that just you know comes from playing for a long time .
⌊ but what ⌋ .
⌈ &~c &~c ⌉ can I say can I interject one thing there ?
&-um I &-uh &-uh brings that out &-uh I believe very much that the standards couldn't have happened any earlier .
and I I think that the the the standards are for lack of a better word sort_of the mature stage of +//.
I mean when he came to that &~i it was using resources not only of having played standards when he was &-um sixteen but but of everything else he went through and in in that's &-uh in other words playing folk rock playing Dylan songs playing &-uh Beatles songs or &-uh &-uh going through the free &-um &-uh &~f through free improvisatory processes doing the solo recitals and so forth .
and it all came together &-uh in the standards and &~i in that lies a certain personal truth of this &-um &-uh denying the answers &=laughs xxx &-uh issue because I believe that &-uh his having played all these other musics is a has influenced how he plays standards in other words he's learned to play standards not just by practicing standards but by practicing all the other things that came then came out <in the> in the standards .
so that that that is very much &-uh it's just a a formula but I don't mean that with a negative connotation it's a <it's a> it's a way of putting all the ingredients in the pot .
<and and> and and that took twenty years to get .
well it's finding another pot to put the ingredients ⌊ in ⌋ .
⌈ yeah ⌉ but maybe the the pot he feels more strongly about +/.
yeah +/.
+, you know .
so so &-uh I it may be some of this provocative controversial stuff about I've not being influenced by anything and anybody .
also was a way of saying +"/.
+" look I play standards .
having played Dylan you_know .
or or I mean &~i and that's that it shows in how I phrase and so forth .
so you could just as well say I &-um my jazz playing has been influenced by Dylan as much as it's been influenced by Brubeck .
and in one &-uh in &-uh one interview he told me you know that this whole influence thing it's so absurd I I could start naming &-um you know pianists I really don't like that indirectly though also have influenced me &-uh in in how I make choices .
and then he &~g went off on this and now I forgot the name of this &-uh piano comedian &~wh what is ⌊ this popular ⌋ .
⌈ Victor Borge ⌉ ?
⌊ Victor Borge ⌋ ?
yes he said you know I've I've &~b I would have to name him too &=laughs:multiple you know so so &-uh .
Borge's funnier .
so &=laughs:multiple so the idea was +/.
⌈ I'm surprised he laughed ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to to &-uh summarize ⌋ you know to use jazz standards playing <as a> as a sort_of a summary of musical experiences that were very varied and &~m many of which were outside jazz .
I think there should be at least a chapter on ⌈ Victor Borge ⌉ .
⌊ on Victor Borge ⌋ &=laughs:multiple .
back to the drawing board .
so &-um can I one more .
yeah I'm sorry I interrupted you .
no that's alright &-um so I wonder if maybe we could &~s shift a little bit to something a little bit more open &-uh could you talk a little bit about how this dissertation might be a spring board for some other areas that you're gonna pursue either related to &~J Jarrett or not possibly +/.
mhm +/.
+, that &-um I'm a little bit curious about what you're going to do with all this &-um you've got probably hours and hours of of interviews so +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, in fact you you happen to mention &~n &~d &~i in the passing I think once that that you know you may do something further with Jarrett but &-um either talk about that or if there're some some windows that have been opened in this that &-um you might explore .
mhm +...
wow that's an interesting question .
&-um &~y you know I &~me I_mean &~of &~th the first thing that comes to my mind is +...
this may be a little off the wall but the first thing that comes to mind is +...
&-um this has done a_lot for me as a musician and and +//.
but I haven't had the time to actually be a musician .
&-uh &-uh so so I'm looking forward to how this will transpire in my practice and in my my playing .
this really doesn't have much to do with the academic part but the musician was sort_of on hold for a year .
and and &-uh &~i &-uh &~bu in a good way I think that it it can do a_lot_of of that .
&-um &-uh &~w &~w <what I> what I've learned is &-uh in in closer detail or one of the things I've learned in closer detail to understand how this &-uh collage is woven together .
you_know &-um what are the mechanics of &-uh say moving from that My Funny Valentine introduction to &-um to the soloing that then ensues <over the> over the chord changes ?
and one of the things that really were surprising to me is after I had made the transcription is the predominance of that &-uh diatonic &-uh &-uh of the diatonic &-uh material in other words staying within the C minor scale for you know almost half the performance &-uh &-uh and yet it &~soun it doesn't sound like that the melody notes are &~s are are like that but what's going on is is highly chromatic underneath it .
and &-um that was something that I didn't understand just by putting on a record and listening to it .
it's I I needed to see this and I needed to go +"/.
+" wow there are what three hundred measures were all he's doing in his right hand is a C minor scale .
and when I first came &~t to jazz I you_know one of the things that attracted me is the the the possibility of being more chromatic and and less tonal .
so &-um understanding the mechanics of of that kind of improvisation and how he creates &-um a longer arch of suspension or &~l longer energy curve that isn't really contained in clearly separable &-um &-uh sixteen or thirty two bar choruses &-um was really interesting for me to find that out through research and I think it's it's gonna end up sounding as well .
in terms of &-uh a research project I think &-um what I'd like to do is &-uh possibly go to some other musicians and see &-um see how similar issues are handled not in_order_to see whether they're doing the same thing and if they're not doing the same thing then it's not as good but but I think that these issues &-uh impact any improviser .
&-uh &-uh &~an and that was the launching point for my comparison with &-um of the solo concerts with Indian music is that there is a need in in vernaculars &-uh predominantly improvised &-uh to deal with form <in a> <in a> in a creative manner and &-um and one obvious solution &-uh for form in in &-uh improvised music &-um is cycles such as in Indian music .
&-uh and &-uh in in his since he doesn't deal with that theory &-uh &~ye you know <on a> on a conscious and in a strict stylistic manner &-uh one of his solutions is &-uh &-uh &~s &~s this internalized sense of of timing &=audio_disturbance .
and it's something that I from my studying Indian music was very aware of in Indian music but to find it reappear in these in this &-uh in these solo concerts was &-uh not something that I &~s I mean I really hadta see whether this was going to hold water and I I was a little surprised that it did &-uh &-uh I kind of didn't expect that research to come to that point .
so I'd like to &-um &-uh &~f find out more about how &-uh improvising musicians &-um &-uh deal with that other &~ins improvising &-uh musicians deal with that .
and I I think you know in the long run this &-uh research <could be> &-uh could be strengthened by going through the same process with &~re the respect to different concerts .
&-uh I just thought that that would that I mean that that's &-uh that's a_lot to go through .
&-um and and I've I've I've pointed out that you know some of it happens in the Koln concert some of it happens in the La Scala concert and some of it happens <in the> in the Kyoto concert .
but the detailed analysis was primarily about one of (th)em &-um but &-uh it's very systematic .
and that's one of those interesting &-uh paradoxes for me with Jarrett is that it all seems so divergent you know playing jazz standards and playing Bach &-uh Bach's &~We Well_Tempered &-uh Clavier and and &-um and then playing Arvo Part and &-uh Lou Harrison and then doing &~fr free improvisations with &-uh &-uh his American quartet and then playing these folklike melodies with the European quartet .
but these impulses &-uh &-uh really carry through all those divergent areas eras and &-um &-uh he tends to not do any of (th)em anymore &-uh simultaneously and &-uh I mean for all we know he may stick with this jazz standards trio .
it's really amazing with &-uh you_know how with how few musicians he performs he performs either alone or with Gary Peacock and and Jack DeJohnnette or with orchestras and that's pretty much it <at the> at the moment .
&-um so there is a strong underlying continuity and to &-uh to find out how that &-uh carries through &-um maybe different &-uh phases of his work &-um for instance to in_depth in_depth compare you know the La Scala process of temporal development with the &~K Koln concert &-uh would be interesting +/.
mhm mhm +/.
+, and then to see how that &-uh figures out in <in other> &-uh in other musicians improvising I mean I mentioned that Chick Corea's &-uh were the first solo piano recordings on ECM and that there must have been some kind of &-uh well if not rivalry but at least you know there was something going on between these two pianists &-um doing &~s very similar thing around the same time .
I &-um I'll be brief (be)cause &-uh we're really kind_of <out of> out_of time .
so &=laughs &-um &~w one &-uh just a_couple_of things &~h &-uh having read earlier versions and then reading this version some things &-uh struck me that didn't strike me before .
and &-uh one was this whole issue about the comparison between the Alap the Indian the &-uh Shankar Alap and and the timing in terms of the solo concerts and on page one forty eight .
and it seems to me this brings up a_lot_of issues and &~y &~s you don't seem to be quite sure how to talk about this .
mhm +/.
+, &-uh on one forty eight you say &-uh &{l=READING the description of Jarrett's relationship with North Indian music suggests that his format of freely improvised solo concerts was developed in part through a conceptual borrowing from classical Indian traditions .
&}l=READING well I mean that's one way of that's one possible interpretation but then in other places you say well &-uh this hasta do with the nature of improvisation itself and you hafta have these struct you sort_of imply that there's something innate in in these these timing systems that are going through an &~impro &-uh I can't remember exactly where +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, you say that but you do in in other words you don't seem quite how know quite how to handle this similarity .
+, mm +/.
+, &-uh &~i &~i &~i there's a certain &~ambi I felt a certain ambiguity in in &-um in what the meaning of this parallel is .
and I wondered if you wanted to +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, or if there's no ambiguity in your mind and I was just perceiving that there's &~a ambivalence here about what does it mean ?
mhm .
well I &-uh I think what it means in particular &-uh with respect to Jarrett is that &-uh he loves Indian music he listened to it he started the solo concerts at a time that was very much under the the star +/.
oh +/.
+, of &-uh .
well then you're sticking to this tradition that it's a borrowing .
&-uh ⌈ yes ⌉ .
⌊ you're ⌋ sticking to this ⌈ interpretation ⌉ .
⌊ yes but ⌋ &-uh &-uh but I'm also saying that he's not &-uh he never consciously tried to do that .
I &-uh he he never came out and said I'm using Alap structures &-uh to apply &-uh &-uh in in my solo concerts in fact I I I I doubt that he would have ever conceptualized it on that level so therefore what I'm saying +/.
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ is there ⌋ is a similar need in &-uh in improvised languages that so heavily &~re ⌈ rely ⌉ .
⌊ for a structure yes ⌋ .
⌈ right for a structure .
and it ⌉ .
⌊ but &-uh &-uh ⌋ .
so that's the only innate thing is that need to somehow ⌈ come out_of structure ⌉ .
⌊ yes there is a need ⌋ yeah &-uh but &~i &~i in_order_to establish that this is borrowing you would have to establish that other improvisers do this temporal structuring in different ways .
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I ⌋ in other words you have to because &-uh &-uh you don't make you don't make the case +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, that it's a borrowing +/.
+, okay +/.
+, you you say you've gotta have a structure you can't improvise without a structure yes of_course &-uh and &~he here's a structure he uses and it looks like this Indian Alap structure it has similarities with this Indian Alap .
well that doesn't doesn't make the case for borrowing .
I mean maybe maybe it is unconscious borrowing but it seems to me you'd hafta do an analysis of other improvisers which have entirely different +/.
+, right +/.
+, temporal structures in_order_to make the case for borrowing here .
well that's that's +/.
yeah +/.
+, that's the &-uh particularity of this situation +/.
+, uhuh +/.
+, is that &-um as much as Jarrett's &~tech techniques or stylistic &-uh persuasions maybe related to other musicians +/.
+, uhuh +/.
+, there are few others that I I I don't know any other that go through this ritual of these forty five minute long &-uh free improvisations .
I mean I just mentioned Chick Corea's recordings they're all in shorter segments they're shorter improvisations that don't allow for this &-uh kind of &~de development .
so I'm not trying to say that what Jarrett does is is totally unique there but I I I would be hard pressed to to ⌈ compare ⌉ .
⌊ you mean there's no ⌋ there would be no other .
