Raymond ordered a burger with a chocolate shake .
and their mom ordered a salad .
and then Lisa finally decided on a Big_Mac with &-um a vanilla
<and um> and the clerk said it was a total of twelve dollars .
and when the mom reached down <&~t um> for her purse to get

one day this &-um twelve year old boy named Tom <xxx> woke up
and he realized <that it &-um he> his alarm clock broke .
and <um he was like> school was about to start .

so &-um she went up to the little alien girl .
and she said hi my name is Susie .

and she said my name's Susie too .
<and um> and Susie said cool .
and then they started &-um playing together .
