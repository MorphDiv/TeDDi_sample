the egyptian+god cards are really strong .
it's like you first put this in the graveyard .
from your hand .
and then you play monster reborn .
to &~re reborn+ed and make it on the field .
&~oh .
that's how you play it ?
and then what happens ?
and then it will last for one turn .
and you can destroy you eminy .
&~oh .
so if you don't have one of those cards .
you can't really destroy anybody ?
Obelisk_the_Tormentor is pretty strong .

only one monster .
&~oh okay .
that's pretty cool .
I had no idea you could do so much stuff with Yu_Gi_Oh +/.
and &-um &~d the last one is slifer+the+sky+dragon .
it's like if I have like eight cards in my hand .
slifer will the+sky+dragon will have eight+thousand attack
and defence points .
wow .
zero if I have zero cards in my hand .
he'll only have zero attack points .
and zero defence points .
mmhm .
I'm going to tell you the most weakest card in all Yu_Gi_Oh .

it's like a card .
that has zer(o) fifty attack points .
and zero defence points .
mmhm .
that's how weak he is .
that's not very much ?
