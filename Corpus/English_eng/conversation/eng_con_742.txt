yesterday I found a frog .
and I put it in a jar .
I went to bed with the dog curled up next_to me .
the next morning I woke up to find that the frog had escaped .
I looked in my boots .
but he wasn't there .
then the dog got his head stuck in the jar .
I hadn't noticed yet .
he fell out_of the window .
and that's when I noticed .
he smashed the the jar .
and I was a bit cross with him .
I went look for the frog .
so and the dog came with me .
I looked in the hole .
but there was a mole that popped out .
and 0 dog had bees running after it .
I went look in the tree .
but an owl came out at me .
and the dog still had bees running after it .
I looked behind the rock .
and there was a deer .
I ended up on the top of the deer's head .
and it ran away with me on top .
and then it ran to the end of the cliff .
and I fell off along with the dog .
I kept falling until I landed splash into the water .
but I was okay .

and the dog sat on my head .
I went look behind a log , telling as I did I told the dog to

and there were two frogs there .
and then we saw the little frogs come out .
so we retrieved the little frog and took it home with us across the
