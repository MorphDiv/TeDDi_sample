<mister> Justice , continuing with the discussion of the
you've spoken a little bit about Meiklejohn in recent times , and I
well , I don't have any particular comments .
I found him an interesting character .
the only time his name was ever mentioned around our conference
I think he would be the kind of person that Douglas would like and
I had a little talk to give up at Brown University , where
but in a way , of course , he was an absolutist , but he always
but I think his presence probably was a plus for the developing law
amendment , and I was glad to dig in and find out things about him

and there were other things to do besides looking up the history of

one thing that's very striking about your commercial speech cases
+" why should this speech be entitled to First Amendment protection
you took the opposite approach to say , +"/.
+" if it's speech , why shouldn't it be entitled to First Amendment
focusing on the notion that speech , even if it doesn't have pure
to what do you attribute this inclusive attitude that you have
+, well , I think we start with the language of the First Amendment
I think it's well sometimes to get everything out in the open and
speech has never greatly hurt us .
it can be unpleasant and stir up vigorous opposition , but it seems
once we break that barrier , then we run into problems of where the
of course , then we run into questions of pornography and obscenity
another argument that those who have been hostile to the commercial
well , of course , I suppose in a way that could be said of
+" I'm the one you should vote for , and I believe A , B , C , and
and somebody else will say , +"/.
+" well , I don't believe in A , B , C , and <D> I believe
sure , there are various varieties of speech and there are extremes
I think the average person , to the extent he thinks about these
why do you think the Court has moved toward more hesitation about

the case we were talking about just before the change of tape , the
well , it has a convenient ring to it .
one can easily ask himself , +"/.
+" why should commercial speech , something that has a profit
therefore , we take off in that direction .
but I don't find anything more sinful in the commercial approach
another interesting feature of the commercial speech cases came in
what you did in your first two decisions in this area , Bigelow and
do you think that this is typical of your approach with regard to
or maybe you could talk more generally about your attitude about
sometimes it depends on where the votes are , of course .
but , yes , I remember what the Valentine case said , and our first
but I guess I , for one , would never take a blunderbuss approach ,
I'd much rather try to preserve it as much as possible under the
of course , the changing personnel of the Court , the changing
so in attempting to uphold stare devises , you're always keeping an
yes , I think so .
sometimes it isn't .
how did you feel when people would say that Roe <v@l> Wade
well , that's a perfectly valid approach for Roe against Wade , but
but there we are , and I think it's probably more secure today than
I may be wrong .
I've been wrong on a lot of things .
let me turn to another case from this period , <nineteen
this case involved placards on the side of city buses .
in the state of Ohio , political advertising was not allowed , but
so , in fact , it's kind of a flip of the commercial speech cases ,
you wrote a plurality opinion and ended up announcing the judgment
I'm wondering if you remember much about this case or have anything
I don't remember too much about it , except that I was always
to that extent , I suppose the advertiser felt these placards are
the case wasn't easy from a theoretical point of view , and I think
not an easy case , as I say , from a theoretical point of view .
another case during this period which focused on this difference
in this case , the city of Montgomery was giving segregated private
, with such schools exclusive access to public recreational
you wrote an opinion for the Court which affirms .
which affirmed Judge Johnson .
right .
okay .
this started out as a memorandum opinion .
you were asked to write a memorandum , and it evolved into the
I'm wondering if you had any recollection about this case and about
well , I think it was an important case in its day .
to begin with , Judge Frank Johnson is a fine federal judge , and I
but it seemed to me the result was right , and I think , if I
you mentioned my writing was for a plurality , which would be less
sure , it had to be that way .
they couldn't let a group take over the whole system .
when you came to the Court , you entered a position of reviewing
when you were on the Eighth Circuit , did you follow their
did you have feelings about what they were doing ?
did you have impressions of the judges down there ?
well , I was aware , yes , due to , oh , I suppose , a couple of
I served on at least one Judicial Conference Committee that was
he was chairman of that committee and was one of the four southern
john Minor Wisdom .
yes , John Minor Wisdom .
yes , I was interested in what the federal judiciary , as a whole ,
of course , the Eighth Circuit , as I may have said before in our
we had the state of Arkansas in it and got many expressions that
it stood in great contrast to what came down from Fargo , North
here was a circuit that extended from the Canadian border down to
when they were splitting the old Fifth and created the Eleventh ,
I wanted Arkansas to stay in the Eighth .
it lent flavor to the Eighth , and it taught those of us from the
how did you feel when the Fifth Circuit was divided ?
well , I wondered about it this is just off the top of my head
after all , the new Fifth was Texas , Mississippi , and Louisiana .
Texas is a big state .
I was a little concerned that the voices of Mississippi , whether
the other part , the new Eleventh , I find to be a very interesting
Florida today is different from what it was twenty years ago , and
but that's part of the interesting aspects of our federal system .
<mister> Justice , both this case involving Gilmore <v@l>
you yourself came from a racially quite homogeneous background .
came from what ?
a racially homogeneous area of the country .
yes .
all right .
and were now starting to come to grips with real issues of racial
how do you think you came to be educated about race relations and
I don't know .
I went to what I regarded as an excellent high school in <Saint>
they were beginning to district the city at that time , and I broke
it was located , as I say , right downtown near the state capitol .
the students there were from all walks of life , mostly , however ,
african Americans , in <Saint> Paul lived largely in an
it was a great education for me , and , of course , I reacted to it
I was just as broke as they were .
but we .
had an excellent teaching staff who sympathized with these kids , I
I was lucky to be there .
when you were on the Eighth Circuit , were you involved at all in
I must have been .
I don't recall any particular cases that stand out in my memory .
Aaron against Cooper perhaps is one .
but the Arkansas judges on the court at the time were splendid
perhaps my best friend on the Eighth Circuit was Pat Mehaffy out of
through him , I learned a lot about problems of Arkansas and his
pat was a pretty able guy .
did you see many examples of blatant discrimination against African
certainly not in my high school .
I suppose they were there , but it wasn't blatant , anyway .
in Arkansas , they were there and they were apparent in those early
but we came through that period , and , for that matter , there
to what extent did your conversations or interactions with Thurgood
oh , that's hard to say .
thurgood never beat the table with a person .
I sat next to him in conference nearly all the time , and listened
many times I've said publicly I was grateful for the fact that
yes , I repeat , I was very glad his voice was there on the Supreme
he had a lot to say .
<mister> Justice , another area in which you've been noted
that was the difference in age , wasn't it , for a majority ?
+, right .
a Utah statute extended the age of minority for purposes of child
you made this statement , +"/.
+" no longer is the female destined solely for the home and the
+" the presence of women in business and in the professions and
how do you think this kind of statement where do you think it
how do you think your own sensitivity about unjustified
I don't know where it came from , actually , but I think it stated
women were taking their places and were giving the opposite sex a
it certainly was antithetical to what was said by Justice Bradley
were you influenced by the professional pursuits of your own
oh , I've always denied it , and they never pressed it , but
did you feel that they experienced discrimination in pursuit of
no , they didn't talk about it particularly , but I think it was
in her small firm there , she finally was made partner and was the
but they've come a long way .
I remember my old Minneapolis office .
what a project it was to take in our first woman associate .
it called for lengthy discussions in the conference room .
well , how foolish , really .
but we got over that hump .
about this time , you also hired your first woman law clerk , Karen
how do you think that that consideration entered into your thinking
did you make a conscious decision to try to hire more women because
well , Karen was the first woman I hired as a law clerk .
I think she was the first woman hired as a law clerk for a long
I'm very , proud of her .
she'll be an excellent judge , and recently gained that recognition
I tried , Professor Koh , not to give women priority .
what I tried to do and I hope I did it acceptably well was
what I looked for in my clerks , as I'm afraid you're well aware of
even though we and I say myself and the clerks might differ
I think being a justice of the Court is difficult enough without
I think over the long run , I've now had over ninety clerks ,
I think that's part of being mature .
got along well with each other , respected each other , and I think
a recent news story reports that among the justices , your clerks
is that something that you encouraged or that you're happy about ?
well , I certainly am happy about it .
I didn't particularly encourage it .
I knew the thing would develop the way it was going to develop
but , yes , they certainly have argued a number of cases , and if I
justice White has had a number of his ex-clerks argue cases , as
but I have never heard an argument by a past clerk that I wasn't
and usually the justice on either side of me will lean over and say
+" wasn't he a former clerk of yours ?
and I'd say , “Yes” .
I don't know whether that meant he was going to vote against him or
of course , we usually I guess maybe counsel is not aware of
+" I spent such and such a year as a clerk to Justice Douglas .
or something of that kind .
the same survey pointed out that more of your clerks have gone into
do you think this is also something that was a result of their
I like to think so , in a way .
whether that is so , I don't know ; but I think it's because of the
they're interested in the welfare of the average person , and I
and , of course , nearly all of them , strangely enough , even when
+" well , I'd like to teach sometime , but in the meantime I'd like
but strangely enough , there's that desire to teach , which means
either that or they would desire to be poor .
yes .
could be .
another thing that was often pointed out was that you used to
was there rhyme or reason behind this ?
there wasn't any particular reason behind it , but I never worried
you know , some of the justices have hired them two years in
I get that input .
I'm not sure that one can really visualize the ability of a person
I learned well , I wondered at first whether I should worry ,
there are more excellent people than there are clerkships on the
so I didn't worry about it , and the choice was often difficult ,
do you think that your selection practices promoted more women
that is hard for me to say .
it may well have been a factor , but , after all , if a woman is
now , there are those who will argue against that ; I think they'll
+" well , she's a woman .
+" she's going to have a family , and this will affect her career .
etc .
, etc .
each of us has his own career .
each of us has his own calling , I suppose , and a woman does have

let me bring you to another case of this period , a case called
it involved the question of whether Miranda warnings that were
the causal connection .
+, right .
that were given after an arrest and before the giving of statements

later he , as <U_S> attorney , was very grateful that you

I don't think I have any recollection along that line that would be
of course , Miranda was popular at that time , anything having to

one of his theses is that although people say that you have become
I'm just tough , hmm ?
do you think that's a fair characterization ?
oh , I don't want to say it's unfair .
<mister> Wasby , Professor Wasby , is entitled to his view
maybe that's where I am .
in criminal procedure issues , particularly search and seizure ,
probably so , when you put it that way , have I basically stuck to
I think probably so .
what is your feeling about the exclusionary rule ?
well , when I first came across it as a struggling lawyer or judge
yet I think it hasn't disrupted the criminal process too greatly .
it certainly has made law enforcement personnel more careful of
every now and then I come across a case where I gag about it ,
with respect to Miranda , Chief Justice Burger once wrote that had
on the other hand , he would not vote to overrule it , because he
what do you think Miranda's impact has been on criminal justice ?
oh , probably the impact has been on the plus side , and Chief
I have nothing further to say on that one .
in this term that we're now discussing , October Term <nineteen
the happy incident was July Fourth <nineteen seventy-six>
you've often spoken about this , time and what it meant to you ,
do you have any strong memories ?
no , I suppose I don't have any strong maybe what you're

it was an emotional time .

I'm sure he didn't campaign to be appointed to the Court during his

of course , his physical problems exacerbated the situation .
as I remember , a ramp was provided for him to get him up to the

I didn't know him in his red-headed days , but I knew him in his
he was a great figure in his way , very different from William
but it was sad to see him deteriorate as he did with that stroke ,
I remember when he announced that he was going to step down .
it happened to be on my birthday , as I recall , on the twelfth day
whether others pushed him to it , I do not know , I wasn't that
I think I sympathize with his reluctance to leave the Court ,
do you think observing his experience affected your own decision to
yes , I think so .
I didn't want to stay so long that I would be asked to step aside ,
that can be embarrassing , it can be , in a way , humiliating
I knew how old I was , and am , and to hold on as long as I did ,
you look pretty good to me , Mister Justice .
let me turn to our final topic of the day , which is the return of
when Justice Stevens took Justice Douglas's place , one of the
I'm wondering what you remember about this whole litigation .
oh , I don't remember very much about it , except it was a
it must have been difficult for John Paul Stevens to walk into that
but there was that line of cases that the Court came out with , and
I don't know what else I can contribute as of that time , anyway .
now I would have no difficulty .
in those cases there seem to be a group Stewart , Powell , and
if they were controlled and channeled .
yes .
it was the uncontrolled feature that was bothersome .
do you think Justice Stevens has lost faith in this standard of
what's your feeling about his views ?
I suppose we ought to ask him , actually , but I think he's the one
I guess I can't say any more than that .
do you think the Court was prepared at the time of these cases ,
do you think that the justices were aware that they were basically
well , if they weren't aware , they certainly must have become

it seems to be a popular penalty to impose in the United States of

I can understand it .
but as long as it's confined for what it is , I think it's a matter
I don't think it deters other killings at all .
