&~www .
yesterday a little boy received a frog from his friend .
&-er at nighttime he went to sleep , and a little frog crept
in the morning when he woke up he looked at the end of his bed to
he was searching high and low in his shoes , in bowls .
and his dog got caught in a bowl .
he started shouting out_of the window asking where he'd gone .
and his little dog fell out with this glass bowl on his head and it
he went down the woods and shouted and still couldn't find him .
he even looked down little burrows and even in wasp huts or
he was climbing in trees , looking through holes .
and his dog disturbed one of the birds and the bees .
a great big owl flew over and frightened the little boy .
he started shouting .
and then a deer popped up .
and he got caught on his horns .
in the end he fell off a cliff into a river .
he as he come up he heard a noise .
he whispered to his dog and said +"/.
+" shh !
he looked over the plank of wood to find a family of frogs .
he was really excited .
and in the end he picked up a little frog and went all the way home
