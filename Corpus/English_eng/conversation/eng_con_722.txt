&~www .
yesterday a boy found a frog .
and he put in a jar .
and when he went to sleep he forgot to put the lid on it .
and it escaped .
he when he woke up he looked everywhere for it .
he looked outside .
and he still couldn't see it .
he still couldn't find it .
so then he went to the woods .
and he was calling its name .
but <he could> he still couldn't find it .
he looked down holes to see if it went down there .
he looked in a beehive .
and he still couldn't find it .
<he s(earched)> he looked everywhere for it .
he looked under a pile of of rocks .
but he still couldn't find it .
he looked everywhere .
<and when he was finding> and when he was looking for it he
and when when he got out he found two frogs and lots_of
then he took his one back home .
