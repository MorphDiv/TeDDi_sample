we're doing nine point four today . 0_6763
xxx . 6763_9268
are you ready ? 9268_12566
no . 12566_13158
if you need to sharpen your pencil, you better do that right this second . 13158_17011
xxx homework ? 17011_24285
probably not there, Matt . 24285_27555
oh, goodness . 27555_28035
xxx . 28035_31075
I hope you guys have your activities ready from the boxes from nine point four . 31075_45913
that was the only other thing that I asked you to do . 45913_49298
I heard a couple of things +... 49298_51131
Ben, you don't even have your books open, ready to go . 51131_52403
what's going on ? 52403_53075
I thought you were going to be the star of my show . 53075_59995
I'm definitely the star . 59995_61163
we're gonna go through the activities kind of quickly, 'cause you should have already had them done and ready to go . 61163_70826
okay ? 70826_85803
here's your problem of the day . 85803_86806
ready to go . 86806_89811
a little review from nine point three . 89811_103093
you may already have this in your notes . 103093_121763
you might have to look back, try it from memory or look in your notes . 121763_128148
I wanna know about the inscribed angle theorem, the right angle corollary, and the arc intercept corollary . 128148_148813
page five eight two if anybody's wondering . 148813_253406
okay . 253406_283620
help me out with the inscribed angle theorem . 283620_286458
tell me what what it is . 286458_287720
in your own words, how would you describe that one ? 287720_292351
anybody ? 292351_295138
Suzy ? 295138_296290
if an angle's inscribed in a circle and it intercepts part of the circle, then the angle's measure is equal to half of the other angle . 296290_305158
okay . 305158_305425
it ends up coming out to be half of the measure of the arc that it intercepts . 305425_309618
right ? 309618_309955
how about right angle corollary ? 309955_312328
Matt . 312328_313881
if an inscribed angle intercepts a semicircle, then the angle is a right angle . 313881_318906
okay . 318906_320151
if it intercepts a semicircle, then angle turns out to be +... 320151_322801
right angle . 322801_324135
a right angle . 324135_324730
okay ? 324730_325176
and arc intercept corollary, Margaret . 325176_327896
when you have two inscribed angles and they intercept the same arc xxx . 327896_334730
okay . 334730_335026
good . 335026_335376
when they intercept the same arc, then they have the same +... 335376_338298
measure . 338298_339976
measure . 339976_340545
good . 340545_340968
okay . 340968_342321
you can open to nine point four, page five eighty eight . 342321_348878
the first thing we're gonna look at is what kind of angles that we're gonna be talking about today . 348878_354640
they're angles formed by secants and tangents . 354640_359401
here's all different cases . 359401_363143
it all depends on where the vertex is +... 363143_375683
and the type of lines that it that it includes . 375683_383070
if the vertex is actually on the circle, you have secant and a tangent right here, or two secants here . 383070_392703
the second group is where the vertex is inside the circle, but it's not on the center usually . 392703_402196
okay . 402196_402950
talking about here . 402950_403728
last the last group, the vertex is outside the circle . 403728_407098
you have two tangents, two secants over here or a secant and a tangent . 407098_412041
okay ? 412041_412448
that's all gonna help you determine how to find the measure . 412448_415535
are you ready for the activities ? 415535_418315
take that out, whatever you brought from Friday for homework . 418315_423271
we're not gonna go over each one of these in deep detail, 'cause you should have already had most of them done . 423271_439308
we'll go over the first, probably, row or two, and then we're gonna talk about the general pattern at the end with x@l . 439308_446053
so, first one . 446053_449868
you have this circle with secant and tangent . 449868_452508
the secant and tangent angle is a right angle here . 452508_455850
okay ? 455850_456463
the secant contains the center of the circle . 456463_458816
what do you think the measure of a@l v@l c@l, angle a@l v@l c@l is ? 458816_462305
what'd you come up with ? 462305_464048
Michaela ? 464048_464478
ninety degrees . 464478_467501
why do you say ninety degrees ? 467501_468878
because it says that secant and tangent angle is a right angle and it xxx . 468878_476726
okay . 476726_477013
so and the measure of a semicircle here, arc a@l v@l is what ? 477013_481053
a hundred and eighty degrees . 481053_482631
a hundred and eighty degrees . 482631_483168
so what can you get from that ? 483168_484583
if the whole arc is one hundred and eighty and the angle is ninety, what does that kind of remind you of ? 484583_490781
xxx . 490781_492613
what's that ? 492613_493668
the right angle corollary . 493668_495276
okay . 495276_495606
yes . 495606_496445
kind of like the right angle one or where basically because it's half . 496445_502786
right ? 502786_503285
it's one eighty degrees and this is ninety, you can come up with this checkpoint here that says the relationship between . 503285_512101
the inscribed angle and the intercepted arc is the fact that it's half of what that arc is . 512101_517544
that was the easy part . 517544_520748
okay . 520748_522985
look at number two . 522985_523651
the secant tangent angle we're gonna go over this was the if it's the tangent and it's a right angle . 523651_528945
next we're talking about the acute angles . 528945_531376
what happens if the angle's acute ? 531376_532778
it's not a straight it's not coming straight through the center . 532778_536018
so it's gonna be a little more tricky for you . 536018_538083
look at arc a@l v@l . 538083_540835
it tells you that it's one hundred and twenty degrees and then it gives you one hundred and twenty degrees for angle one, here . 540835_550275
how do you know that ? 550275_552171
how can how do they justify that ? 552171_554191
Leah ? 554191_555263
because it's the central angle, and the central, and the arc that they intercept equals the measure . 555263_561320
good . 561320_562531
