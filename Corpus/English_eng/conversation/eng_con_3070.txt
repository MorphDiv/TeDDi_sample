shh ! 7200_7783
I didn't ask you to shout at me . 7783_9751
Kevin please go ahead . 9751_11503
blue green and wait blue yellow green and +... 11503_20000
we're on this one . 20000_20860
blue um wait blue green +... 20860_25601
so how many colors did you just say so far Kevin ? 25601_28200
two . 28200_28781
two . 28781_29320
so blue green and +... 29320_30936
blue green . 30936_31716
blue . 31716_33260
Kevin what's that last color ? 33260_35748
blue green . 35748_37413
here's blue here's green what's that color ? 37413_41765
green blue . 41765_42605
blue green yep always say the um primary color first yep . 42605_48188
okay and how about the last combination we already talked about
Alex do you know what those three colors are ? 52150_53866
red orange orange and red . 53866_56350
yep red orange and red orange . 56350_58403
now there are lots of other combinations . 58403_60173
Vanessa's suggestion no Katie's I'm sorry of blue violet violet and
+^ so we're gonna choose new sets of colors for our
Teddy could you sit down flat . 87600_89595
Alex please tell us what else we could do to make our quilts better
you should do your very very best ! 95291_98145
&~wha &~wha what would that mean ? 98145_99663
what will I pay attention to ? 99663_101830
on your quilts and concentrate like Albert Einstein . 101830_107516
so if we concentrate like Albert Einstein we're gonna
okay um what else can we try that's new and different with these
+^ we could try some new color combinations that we haven't tried
hmm what else what were the things you guys were talking to me
colors was one of them and we just did some more talking about
+< shapes . 137081_137082
shapes . 137082_137673
patterns . 137673_138530
what could we do different with shapes ? 138530_141498
we do wanna look for patterns and what we're planning
make patterns . 146240_147400
we can try to see if our shapes will go together to make patterns
+^ did we do that when we made strip quilts ? 151761_153430
uh uh uh . 153430_156231
no . 156231_157333
yes . 157333_158420
+< we didn't ? 158420_159016
yes . 159016_159526
yes we did . 159526_159993
I don't know &~i &~i I was going to say I just remembered this big
but we will want to do that again when we see how our two by twos
can you think of something else ? 177873_179193
Justin . 179193_179825
um make smaller triangles so you can fit (th)em together and you
what did um did you hear Justin's design Asratu ? 185991_189626
could you say it in a big voice Justin I think some people weren't
make smaller triangles and so we can make like more designs and
Justin says that if we make smaller triangles we'll be able to make
well same colors ? 203403_208741
um I mean with them um three xxx . 208741_213878
so if if Justin picked to work with blue green and blue green
when you say smaller triangles what do you mean Justin ? 217881_220548
I mean like they don't or if you cut (th)em in half like um and
so what Justin is saying I I didn't grab a blue green and blue
Justin's saying that um when he and all of the rest of you were
Justin's idea is to take one of these triangles and to cut it in
um how do I do that Justin ? 257681_260148
do you think that'll work ? 260148_272635
yes . 272635_273216
yeah (be)cause you can fit if you like cut one of one color and
um I took a red orange piece (be)cause Justin's saying that yeah if
I what I was going to do was go like this yeah if you just
+< diamond . 303806_304141
is it a diamond ? 304141_304790
I mean no +... 304790_305525
no we've seen that shape +... 305525_307176
have you seen a shape this size ? 307176_309595
no . 309595_310728
no we have seen that shape . 310728_312730
Sarah were you gonna show us +/? 312730_313945
+< xxx . 313945_314125
that was the shape we talked about in Ashley and Vanessa's problem
+< xxx you need to take like another one and xxx like two squares .
but Justin was saying even if you leave (th)em in that same shape
it's hard to tell from where you're sitting I'll bet but one of
and then +/. 333220_335105
so if they came together I could get I could get a a pin
+< you could um you could put um on the oranges you could put like
+< cool ! 356121_356338
+< you could make even smaller triangles . 356338_358105
um let's not go any smaller than this okay ? 358105_361971
do you think adding that new size of triangle will make my designs
um (...) . 367240_374810
do you think it could ? 374810_376640
or you just you think it's not gonna help at all it's
I think it's not going to make any difference . 382458_385616
okay . 385616_386480
because it's just gonna be there are more triangles
do you think more triangles will make any difference in the designs
well yeah (be)cause you could like well maybe like if you like
okay how many of this size triangle the triangle that we've been
Dani . 432273_433075
how many of these does it take to fill a whole core square ? 433075_437428
um &~teh eight . 437428_441880
eight . 441880_443265
eight . 443265_444088
what about this new size of triangle how many of these could I fit
um sixteen ? 450370_451453
how did you get that so quickly Nathan ? 451453_453763
(be)cause eight plus eight is sixteen . 453763_455848
but how did you know eight plus eight ? 455848_457668
because um if you if you divide um eight you divide eight um if you
so I took all my eight triangles I started with and I cut them all
so if you have sixteen little pieces like this to move around you
you can even make a smaller triangle out of that . 505150_508053
well we said we weren't going to go any smaller than this . 508053_510921
Justin . 510921_515856
I have another shape . 515856_517916
oh that was just what I was going to ask Justin can you hold that
Justin says he has another suggestion for different shapes we could
his first suggestion to you was to take the size triangle we're
+< that's beautiful ! 546843_547361
you got another idea for different shapes we could use Jillian ? 547361_550423
yeah . 550423_550876
what could we do ? 550876_551635
um on the two xxx of the squares cut those off and then the two
um cutting off the edges of the squares ? 560106_566371
yeah . 566371_566540
+< show us what you mean . 566540_568033
