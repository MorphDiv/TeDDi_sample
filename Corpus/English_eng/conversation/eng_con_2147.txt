Great .
What should we talk about ?
&=laughs . 141810_143990
Well I don't know .
Tell me what's going on in America .
I haven't seen the news in ages . 145200_149050
Really ? 149260_149680
You did d- . 150280_150600
In the American news I mean I know what's going on in Russia but .
yeah .
Well let's see .
What's going on ?
uh . 153060_156850
You want me to just give you some headlines ? 157780_159280
yeah .
Give me some headlines .
What's Clinton up to ? 160460_162800
&=lipsmack &=breath up- . 161620_162040
yeah .
I was just going to say Clinton just came out yesterday with his uh
uhhuh . 169900_170380
And, and basically he has in the past said that he was not in favor
you know of making &-um al- allowances strictly based on race . 177580_182230
but at the same time &-uh the analysis in the news . 182930_186490
&=breath shall we say the conservative analysis in the news is that
Clinton just came out and said that he doesn't believe in quota
and in reverse discrimination but that he does believe that
is necessary &=inhales to move &-uh you know black Americans
forward and to give them the opportunities that they've been
So he's trying to, k- kind of walking a tight rope .
You know what I'm saying ? 207780_210920
Right . 211450_211810
In other words &=breath l- . 212250_213170
He's trying to please everybody . 212710_214010
yeah .
Let's see if we can make everybody happy &=laugh . 213890_217650
&=laughs . 217270_217900
I think that he's . 218100_218960
Then he just ends up making nobody happy . 218870_220760
I think you're right &=laughs Because you know affirmative action
from many different quarters right now .
And, and it's a big, &=breath . 226200_229110
it's a big issue because it's supposed to be a gender, I mean not a
uh color blind we're supposed to be race color blind and yet
that are bidding you know with a high bid or higher than . 240200_243850
+, the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they
And it's really you know . 252050_252890
Right . 252520_252920
And then, then so they're taking lawsuits to the Supreme Court and
Wow . 257630_258070
Another thing that just came up was that the Supreme Court said
violated the Constitution because it was based primarily on race . 268540_274410
There was you know a new . 276260_277260
What did they do i- They were doing it because they were trying to
They were trying to make the district majority black Americans so
You see what I'm saying ? 292980_293700
oh right .
uhhuh . 293470_295190
a, a very narrow district and it created a majority black district
a, a black representative and then it was challenged because it
majority black &=inhales and that's not . 308200_310510
right . 310440_310840
you know . 311450_311810
Hello ? 316370_316850
I'm here . 318190_318840
okay &=breath Anyway . 318800_319890
I'm mulling all this over . 319600_320950
yeah .
I mean it's, it . 321320_322210
So it's interesting because today we had a discussion with students
because we're doing a pre departure orientation so we were, we had
discussion today where we break in small groups and we talked about
and racial prejudice and sexual harrassment, feminism and . 333770_336820
just like different topics that they might encounter in America
So that was one of the things kind of like that &=distortion . 342520_344240
But I have I'm not really up on what the attitude is in America
Well there's a_lot_of frustration I think over the fact that
program is in fact discriminating in the other direction and people
Why don't we just give everybody &-uh . 356500_363450
uh &-uh an e- try to give everybody an equal shot and if someone
go at it from the standpoint of, of trying to remedy it through the
rather than saying that government has to give X number of
Right . 380760_381110
And as a result some &-uh m- some people are getting contracts just
of the color of their skin and you know what I'm saying it's, it's,
When they might not even be the most qualified . 390210_392160
e- either them they're, they're not even, they're not the low bid .
you know normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the
Right . 401050_401510
And but now you've, there have been several cases where clearly you
they didn't get it because &=laughs they just didn't weren't the
So now is that . 409790_410460
Right . 410190_410530
is that really remedying the situation or is it's creating a_lot_of
And &-uh . 417000_417540
Right . 417230_417690
it's kind of too bad .
How long . 417820_418970
God what a mess . 418610_419560
oh it's a mess .
It really is .
W- how long have you been there by the way ? 420000_422840
Over here ?

Well I like to think I'm not totally out of touch

uhhuh . 455990_456660
New terminology .
New buzzwords .
And all that stuff . 456680_460970
Right . 460440_460900
Of course when you get to be over forty like me um, you can miss
&=laughs . 469700_470360
