when the <&~ch> children got home from school they they
and they went there .
and and then <her mom> their mom realized that she left
when the boy woke up he was really tired because &-um he spilled
and he pulled the <&~sh> shoelace out .
and people don't do that very often .
and he missed the school bus .
and he didn't come to school on time .
oh no .
because look at the teacher pointing at her watch .
look at him looking at the clock .
you're silly .
the aliens came down <and &~outer> from outer space .
and <they um> they walked down .
and the boy was scared .
but the girl wasn't .
they came down with <a &~mo> a <&~m> dad a mom and <a
and they have eight legs and polka dots .
that's as long as I can think of
