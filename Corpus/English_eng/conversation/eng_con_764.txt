&~www .
at the weekend me and the dog we &-er was looking at the frog
at night the frog jumped out_of the jar .
and in the morning when I looked it had gone .
I put on my clothes .
and the dog looked in the jar and got his head stuck .
I shouted out the window .
and the dog fell out and smashed the glass off his head and was
&-um I shouted outside for the frog .
and I looked in all the holes in the ground .
and the dog looked in the trees .
I looked in the top of the trees .
and a swarm of bees &-um chased the dog and me .
&-um I climbed the top of the rock to shout for him .
and a deer came up .
and I got caught on his antlers .
he carried me a way to the end of a cliff , where I fell .
and we me and the dog fell into the water .
we looked over the tree trunk and were very quiet .
and we saw some frogs .
there was a whole family of frogs sitting around .
we then got our frog back and said +"/.
+" goodbye .
