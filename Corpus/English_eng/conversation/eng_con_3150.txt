right off her course . 210_970
we're building that . 1210_1940
it's sitting at her desk now . 2300_3390
so she can remember what it looks like . 3500_4820
and she can try at_least one other way to see if she can design
and you wanna save it for a while . 11320_12690
but think about it . 12760_13300
just carefully slide it on and build another one . 13430_16020
so you can look and make some decisions about which design you
okay . 20990_21140
okay . 23230_23470
well that's one that you wanna keep thinking about . 23520_25260
now try another one at horse building . 25420_29670
that'll help you . 30070_30820
remember that you can use &-um two or three colors . 31160_37980
and you may use a square and triangles or just triangles . 40350_44210
we had excellent ideas about how those shapes could go together . 46430_49510
I'm seeing stripes . 50220_51270
I'm seeing zigzags seeing triangles go together to make larger one
&-um that's a neat design . 61570_63100
but I'll get &-um options for your &-um quilt family because watch
and I'll show you why . 69660_70270
watch what happens . 70610_71340
I'm gonna &-um I'm gonna turn it . 71690_74050
I'm gonna try to keep all the pieces together . 74380_76020
and I'm gonna turn it to . 76490_77550
the right . 78340_79060
okay . 79470_79600
so watch where it is . 80060_80860
it says . 80880_81130
Blue on the top . 81240_81910
okay . 85070_85190
does it look very different . 85910_87100
no . 89050_89140
let's . 89860_90100
does it look very different . 92260_93540
no . 94170_94230
not very you know what . 95130_96530
there's only . 96550_97060
&-um . 97330_97500
and this isn't anything that you could've known ahead of time . 98220_100330
but if we had more of them just like this . 100490_102530
oh . 102770_102900
no . 103850_104020
we can't . 104070_104420
because they're all &-um . 104470_105690
I don't wanna destroy . 105900_106770
their groups . 107670_108130
four squares . 108730_109170
imagine what it would look like . 110200_110930
if we flipped it . 111150_112570
okay . 113440_113580
if we flipped it over this way it would have yellow and blue on the
right just but yellow first and then blue . 118450_121450
but really there's only two different ways to make your four square
look . 124660_124900
you can either have blue on the top and yellow . 125680_127050
or you could have oops that's blue on the top topal or yellow on
so when you try to keep flipping (th)em and turning (th)em to make
yeah probably . 147790_148380
but could you you could probably still do something &-um with
you like that . 153660_154020
but around the outside maybe you'll wanna change a little bit the
these could only . 160080_160820
well if you have all yellow around the edge every way you turn it
right . 172750_172840
so when your coursewares come together they're gonna look the same
you can together watch this . 177150_178670
what_if you took . 178820_179540
&-um because it doesn't mean you need more colors . 180000_181790
two color designs can be very complex and do things . 182020_184790
what_if I take just one yellow away . 185360_186910
and put a blue on it so that would make that a blue square instead
let's try that . 191390_191990
and then let's try turning it and see how many different ways we
'cause the other design we could only get it to look two ways . 196510_198550
let's try this . 199450_200070
here . 200230_200500
we've got the yellow &-um corner coming there . 200520_203900
what here is that a different way for it to look . 204160_206500
yeah . 206640_206820
is that a different way for it to look . 207900_209500
yeah . 209630_209850
is that a different way for it to look . 211100_212460
mhm . 212560_212850
yeah . 213710_213780
so that was let's see how many ways we look more ways four ways . 214030_216470
that was twice as many ways . 216710_218020
okay . 219140_219260
or if . 219880_220230
you did . 220690_220940
&-um . 221300_221360
yeah . 223240_223390
if you over it I already had one . 223620_232520
that's one . 269670_270230
I like this . 270370_270680
mhm . 270930_271110
hmm . 273900_273940
you trying to make another one . 275190_276350
mhm . 276770_277080
what's . 303650_303800
why because you did you listen to Gillian and I talk to you . 308090_316890
yeah . 318560_318680
so <what did we> what did we try to show you about your core
what's gonna happen if because we said the way you use a core
you turn it and flip it and put it together to make different
what'll happen if Katie does that . 329720_331430
turns and flips her core square to make different . 331570_333350
designs . 333440_333720
okay . 340770_340870
Katie watch as I turn . 341000_341900
look at how yours is now would right on the . 342370_344030
are you red on the left and blue on the right . 344530_346600
okay . 347160_347270
does it look the same or different . 347290_348470
now it's it's different . 351110_352230
and then though now it's back to the way it started right now . 352720_355720
it looks like this . 355770_356190
there's only two ways your core square can look . 356510_358660
there's only two possible ways . 359360_360420
so if there's only two ways your core squares can look no matter
when you start putting (th)em together to make two by two designs
you might be able to make one or two different ways . 369420_371180
maybe one . 371820_372830
&-um Nathan didn't have the same design issue . 374700_377660
&-um but I but Jillian did . 377940_380260
but Nathan had a pin wheel design that every it his the same thing
his looked exactly the same every way he turned it except a flip
the only way he could change his is by flipping it turning his made
you can get some turns and flips but what could she do . 393240_396580
what could be one simple change . 396600_398150
she could do and keep most of this horse for the same that would
that would be one thing . 404690_405430
so what are you saying . 405670_406100
if instead_of we'll just put a if instead_of a blue to a blue
if it was a blue square now does it look different than it did when
does it look different . 418430_419460
if you flipped it sideways . 421390_422590
would it look different . 422640_423340
we took this and flipped it over sideways . 427020_428950
look at the cake . 429890_430660
turn would it look different than it does . 430680_432070
now if we flipped it down an up down flick would it look different
yeah . 438500_438630
so see just . 438990_439410
that that doesn't mean you have to do that . 439480_441300
you could do what else . 441340_442430
could she do . 442580_442830
what_if she wanted to keep this red with here . 442880_444180
what_if she did just &-um something different instead_of making it
what_if she really wanted to use all triangles . 448760_450350
what_if instead_of two colors . 450910_452180
what_if she she could've put like &-um green right there in the
would that help her design . 457360_458230
I mean for two by two designs . 458440_459870
okay . 467130_467220
let's let's do what . 468060_468980
he just said . 469000_469420
we won't change your . 469490_470100
now we're just gonna lay these on top . 470120_471300
Nathan said . 471530_471910
what_if you made those blue ones in the middle green . 471960_474380
I just but I wanna think about that for a minute . 474720_477060
he's already got another idea . 477150_478300
but I wanna think about that for a minute . 478380_479700
do you think that will change the number of two by two designs . 480140_482470
you could make Katie it does make your core square different . 482520_486060
but will that make the two by two designs look any different . 486080_488610
no 'cause why 'cause it's in the middle part . 489840_490550
and when you put the core squares together does the middle of one
no . 495500_495670
so when you're planning a core square and you wanna make say just
oh is that gonna change it at all . 501540_502780
let's try it . 503800_504180
how is this green part ever gonna touch the green part on any other
maybe only if one was up there . 511360_513059
well it might yeah it might go like that . 514530_516070
<yeah yeah> yeah that's true . 516780_518659
but which when you push the four core squares together to make a
edge . 527550_527670
so since here it goes <blue red red> blue red red blue . 528010_532640
if you get even one different color along the edge . 533380_536020
then when you put those together like say for example we left that
I don't know . 540600_540820
let's say if we made this one green we kept everything else the
but we turned this one of these outer red triangles to green . 544480_547140
then can you imagine if we put your we put a green one here . 547440_550380
and when you have you know a big green triangle . 550570_552300
and then if you wanted to you could get a green diamond in the
but they didn't get green on all four corners of your two ways yo
