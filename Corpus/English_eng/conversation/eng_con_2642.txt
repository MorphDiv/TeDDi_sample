⌈ okay ⌉ +/.

+, ⌊ basically ⌋ all my &~f you know firsthand research stuff . 169065_171265
right good alright so what do &~you do you have specific questions about this for me like are there parts that you think are weak and parts you think are particularly strong ? 171425_180665
I dunno yeah I was just kinda hoping you'd read over and say this hasta be changed or &=laughs:S2 you know whatever . 181045_185105
okay no specific questions for me ? 185425_187065
nope nope . 187305_187785
alright .
let me take a look at this &-um &=pause_while_reading . 187845_189985
I kinda hadta throw out like &~th the first outline I gave you +/. 199905_203305
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ was ⌋ kinda general idea and I hadta throw some things outta that (be)cause like . 203465_205965
that's fine yeah . 206025_206765
just like rough ideas I had +... 206925_208305
great . 209545_210625
now &-um you &~m you might though I don't know I mean and this is not so important for the paper but I think this introduction sounds really good . 211275_218795
&-um you +//. 219415_219695
it's written really clearly and stuff . 219915_221135
&-um now I worry whether you are capturing by interviewing your grandmother &-um that you're capturing what people do in Howell or whether you're capturing an older form of socializing that still remains in Howell especially among older people . 221595_238195
&-um so you might &~i it doesn't change your argument necessarily but you might wanna qualify it in that kinda way +/. 238635_244275
okay +/.
+, you see what I mean ? 244635_245035
okay I I made sure to ask well let me write that down &-um &{l=WRITING qualify &}l=WRITING I actually did &-um in a number of places &-um things that she said that I &-uh that interested me I said you know this is maybe why she says this or whatever . 245535_260475

+, to that community . 276155_276595
yeah <she's just> she's just like +//. 276695_278555
everyone knows her in Howell (be)cause she's you know lived there all her life and she's big into the every kinda community thing you can imagine so . 278935_286355
did you get a did you get and include in here the kinds of community things that she's involved in ? 286735_291555
yeah +/.
+, okay good . 291935_292295
&-um &=pause_while_reading . 293715_293755
and I pulled from the Crawford +/. 299435_304755

okay great . 310675_311275
oh and the Detroit News article was awesome too . 313255_315015
&=laughs oh okay &-um you want me to make comments to you as we go along ? 315235_318655
why don't I +/. 318815_319015
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ make ⌋ comments to you as we go along ? 319095_319815
&-um now here's a place where you could pull in more specifically &-um you know partly from the Crawford I think &-um but you could pull in more specifically I mean all businesses exist to make money . 320335_334875
right ?
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I mean ⌋ that's the nature of capitalism . 335555_337695
&-um so +... 338655_339075
you gotta be a little more specific than malls exist to make money . 341645_344125
you know what I mean ? 344485_344885
&-um so why did does Crawford suggest and have we talked about in class that sort of that malls have developed when they have &-um +... 345705_355705
to concentrate the making of money ? 358685_361025
&-um because they can &-um partly (be)cause they can be the new town square or whatever and people can +/. 361925_369225
okay +/. 369225_369585
+, I guess people can go there and &~l like everyone wants +//. 370285_373765
I talk about it later on but everyone wants you know the national kind of brands and stuff +/. 373885_378145
+, okay +/.
+, so if they put the same stores everywhere then people are gonna +/. 378445_380905
+, okay +/. 381465_381565
+, and all that kind of thing . 381725_382445
alright &-um so national brands and you're gonna talk later about security as well right ? 382745_388065
yeah oh yeah . 388225_388485
and you're also I know gonna talk later about &-uh &-um (0.7) &~w where's my mind &-um okay . 393405_406125
you're gonna talk later about (0.7) oh well I don't remember . 406385_415905
what's the other theme that you have that I remember from your last paper ? 416925_419505
&-um oh like well it's kinda like security with the youth and +/. 419675_423515
okay +/.
+, all that and &-uh +... 423635_424395
other theme . 425515_426915
alright never mind we'll find it . 428035_429715
yeah uhuh &=laughs:multiple . 429935_430515
&-um &-um it might be good +... 431455_432975
okay here you say your thesis is how &-um they change people's socializing right ? 434855_440395
but here you're basically saying but before we get to that we need to understand why malls develop . 440515_445235
oh oh +... 445755_446275
just remembered &-um in part this is &-uh the claim of Davis I &~gue hm Davis and Crawford that they partly develop to fill a gap in the need to &~social the gap of places to socialize of communal places in suburbs which are just kind_of tract subdivisions . 447205_463325
yeah I did &-um I &~th I think I yeah . 463545_466005
I think that was in your ⌈ outline so ⌉ . 466265_467225
⌊ it's it's in there ⌋ yeah . 467225_467845
&-um you might &-um &{l=WRITING fill suburban gap . 467865_472265
socializing or public space gap . 473925_476965
you might want a &~f foreground like (be)cause you know malls exist as you've just told me for those reasons as_well_as just to make money right ? 477825_490885
mm +/.
+, (be)cause all businesses exist to make money . 491265_492905
so you might wanna just &-um highlight the . 493865_497845
oh okay .
you see what I mean ? 498485_499005
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-um ⌋ and then you know you're gonna talk about them later in more detail . 499535_502595
&-um but you maybe wanna highlight why malls move to the suburbs in greater detail +/. 503075_507375
+, &{l=WRITING malls &}l=WRITING +/.
+, and &~the and one of the reasons but only one of them is that malls are built in middle+class locations . 508015_515095
right ? 515495_516435
so they're built &-um +... 516815_518575
in a way just to draw on that &-um higher income group . 520095_525695
(0.5) so we'll see as it goes on if if this would affect your broader organization or not . 526555_534455
⌈ &-um ⌉ .
⌊ let's ⌋ hope not &=laughs:multiple . 535215_535635
&-um okay . 535855_539955
this is a tiny bit repetitive in here so you might just wanna somehow tighten it up &-um . 540355_545355
okay +/. 546855_547415
+, &=reading <got right democratic servant is> +... 547625_548645
<don't &-uh> okay tells a story quite clearly . 549125_551865
without +...
yeah this is good &=pause_while_reading now it's developing as a more upper income area is that right ? 552725_571885
yeah . 572045_572185
you might wanna say that . 572845_573565
mkay +/.
+, (be)cause developing doesn't tell me as what . 573725_577565
&=pause_while_reading now are there gaps I mean this is something that Crawford talks about in that map I mean are there gaps where lower income suburbs are ? 596585_604545
+, or can you ⌈ not tell ⌉ ? 605945_606585
⌊ basically ⌋ it's just focus +//. 606605_607325
it shows like a you know a map of southeast Michigan and then it says I'll draw it here mm &-uh there's southeast Michigan and it's it shows like Detroit area whatever +/. 607525_616065
right +/. 616245_616285
+, and then it shows this little box and then it shows &=sound_effect +/. 616365_618725

+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so ⌋ basically all of this area is kinda like upper middle+class &~west this is our like west suburbs . 621025_625465
I see so it's just showing the west suburbs . 626065_627765
pretty &~mu yeah ⌈ yeah ⌉ . 628025_628585
⌊ okay ⌋ and it's all pretty upper middle+class . 628585_629925
yeah .
huh . 630145_630365
and it didn't show the other areas where the malls were . 631265_633265

alright the wealthier cities you sort_of tell me that . 639025_640405
does it mention the connection between malls moving into upper income areas or is it not &~a in that article ? 640925_646625
it yeah it didn't +/. 646745_647365
right mkay +/.
+, &~sa it just +... 647485_647785
okay now this is a bit of a different point . 654525_656485
right ? 657445_658425
&-um I mean this first point about &-um the mall becoming a place for people to socialize is directly tied to your thesis right ? 658765_666705
okay +/. 666925_667085
+, this is a point that you do wanna make but you don't wanna make it in the same paragraph . 667325_671025

⌊ okay ⌋ I think I talk about it later ⌈ too so ⌉ . 671865_673425

now is Howell a more lower income &~midl or like a kinda regular old middle+class community ? 686475_701755

&-um you &~prob +... 706085_707725

I mean I don't like melons but &=laughs:S2 &~f from what I hear they are . 1378845_1381565
<I see> &=pause_while_reading I see right . 1382065_1388645
alright so tell me what you think the Howell Melon Festival does . 1389885_1395005
I mean here's here's a not real problem I mean I've told you this before the way you write that is sort_of chatty has its pros and cons right ? 1395545_1403705
I mean in the one in one way it makes things very easy to read and that's very nice . 1404225_1407405
&-um but you can't let it get in the way of your argument . 1408405_1411745
you can't let your argument kind of disappear as you kind_of tell me this little story +/. 1413125_1416465
mhm +/.
+, &-um so here's a good example of you know somewhere either at the end or at the beginning you have to tell me what I mean here's you know this is gonna go away . 1417585_1428025
&-um &{l=READING Howell has many events through the year that bring neighbors together . 1429165_1431765

&-um do they does it +//. 1444345_1445765
and how is that different from the socializing in the malls ? 1446305_1448345
I mean here's here's an example I mean do you think that &-um in these more like community events and group socializing as opposed to mall socializing that &-um people get to know each_other I mean that people are interacting with each_other in ways aren't mediated by commodities +/. 1448365_1470865

I yeah it builds community atmosphere I mean +/. 1494595_1496315
right +/. 1496555_1496615

&-um &=pause_while_reading huh so everyone in the community goes to the high school play that's very interesting . 1503655_1513835
yeah I thought so too . 1514115_1515015
&=pause_while_reading right so many strangers are moving in . 1515635_1522155
&-um &=pause_while_reading in a way Howell is lagging behind this shift that you're talking about right ? 1531885_1541325
I mean &-uh +... 1541465_1542785
maybe Howell will &~f forever stay outside of but I really doubt it &=laughs +/. 1544825_1549365
yeah +/.
+, &-um so and your grandmother particularly &-um is a good example of &-um a previous Howell . 1550355_1561315
that is in part as she says being disrupted as new people move in not totally disrupted but partly . 1561415_1565755
&-um so &~y you'd you even though your mom tells you how young people socialize in Howell you you wanna recognize the way this is a bit a representation of Howell's past instead you know ? 1566475_1579935
something like that . 1580455_1581275
this is a time distinction yeah . 1584055_1585675
as_well_as +//.
or an age distinction right ? 1585995_1588295
she's older . 1588355_1588935

like in other words like if if it was you_know oops I just hit that thing &=laughs if she she wouldn't do it if it was just golf . 1623815_1634415

do you think this is an older person thing or do you think kids do this too ? 1781725_1784205

⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 1790325_1790365

it doesn't undermine your argument for that to be the case . 1790885_1793385
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 1793645_1793805
+, ⌊ right ⌋ ?
in a way it's just that you're &~s eh then you just need to emphasize more clearly at the outset that the comparison is partly (be)cause Howell is a more &-um has historically been a more blue collar middle+class place . 1794185_1811665
&-um now new gated communities are moving in right ? 1812565_1816565
no +/. 1816905_1817285

&-um &=laughs &-um that may be changing in Howell I mean Howell may be becoming more upper middle+class or whatever &-um but &-uh +... 1819445_1829645
the form of socializing that you're describing in Howell &-um +... 1833545_1837185
is in part you know seen through the view of your grandmother and thus in part something that is about the long term community that's been there right ? 1840625_1848225
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um so about like people with &~h history in so it's not really in some sense a typical transient suburb . 1849085_1855085
it's about people with a history and a place &-um and that maybe the newer residents moving in &-um and some of the younger residents don't have those same kinds of socializing networks that are like built up in that place over time . 1855755_1869655
(0.7) so when you're laying out the comparison between Novi and Howell in the beginning you probably wanna say that kinda thing right ? 1870695_1881835
and maybe even in that paragraph where you start to describe &-um what your uncle says about Novi . 1882555_1888155
no no that's Novi never mind . 1888355_1889455
&=laughs &=pause_while_reading &-um okay that's good okay here you go +... 1889935_1899615
okay this is a very awkward sentence . 1901155_1905555
&=laughs .
yeah it is &=laughs:multiple . 1906055_1908115
&=pause_while_reading right . 1927985_1928505
&=pause_while_reading okay I &-um +... 1928665_1945545
okay I want you to +... 1946945_1950365
well maybe I should see how you do this &=pause_while_reading okay . 1953335_1965995
&-um (0.9) it seems to me like in this paragraph there are lots_of totally different things going on . 1966315_1978875
&-um and in general you should do this throughout the paper too . 1979505_1983005
you need to go through and ask yourself what the point of each paragraph is right ? 1983545_1986205
&-um and make sure it has a point and make sure it says what its point is okay ? 1986605_1990985
okay +/. 1991525_1992565
+, &-um (be)cause here we've got okay . 1992565_1994385
the first sentence which is to me a really important point that you should talk more about right ? 1995005_1999405
&-um what does it mean that the socializing is not tied to shopping for your grandmother right ? 1999585_2004665
why do you think that's important ? 2005125_2006405
&-um and and you can talk about this exception being Wal_Mart . 2007705_2011505
&-um but you know here you you can just drop this right ? 2012485_2018505
&{l=READING it wouldn't be unless a mall moved in that &}l=READING first of all it's incredibly awkward &=laughs &-um &-uh and this is a separate point . 2018885_2027005
more and more people are moving into Hower Howell &-um and you're asking &~so sort_of +//. 2027185_2035305
so I think you should expand this into a real paragraph where you say why you think that's important . 2035185_2040525
&-um and this is a separate paragraph now you can't give me an answer to this question . 2041745_2047965
it is an interesting question . 2048185_2049125
&-um you might wanna put it in a footnote instead . 2050005_2053565
do you know how to use footnotes ? 2055305_2056105
mhm .
&-um (be)cause +... 2056185_2059305

(0.7) and that the most important things are you know wearing these brand names on your body so are this is this clothing point right ? 3366505_3374385
no . 3375265_3377725
I think it is true . 3377885_3378565
okay +... 3378625_3381285
&-um (0.5) you know &-uh +... 3383965_3391485
this is true throughout this paper . 3394475_3395935
it's it's at a pretty good stage I mean you've got a good &-um discussion of your primary materials it seems to have like a basically good organization I mean you need to you know fiddle like I've been suggesting fiddling &-um and tighten up at some points . 3397195_3411715
now may be the time to ask yourself how else this fits in with other readings that we've done . 3412715_3417535
(be)cause so far we're a little bit short on that kind of connection right ? 3417835_3421715
&-um and we've talked a_lot in this class about &-um using clothes to proclaim a certain kind of status now &-um +... 3422375_3431735
there's not a reading that's gonna make the point that you need to make here exactly . 3434215_3437335
but if you looked at In Search of for for Respect or something like that &-um he might make a similar point about clothing right ? 3437895_3446215
about symbolic capital . 3446415_3447435
in fact he definitely does . 3448455_3449575
+, mkay +/.
+, &-um and of_course &-uh it has a different meaning to the kind of upper middle+class people that come to the mall than for the crack dealers . 3450895_3460155
&-um but you wanna think about those kinds of categories that we've thought with in this class a little bit and see if they can if you can use them in your analysis in some way right ? 3461095_3471255
to expand exactly like this point what it +//. 3471595_3474255
why do people feel like they can obtain a certain status ? 3475095_3478715
what do we mean by that you know ? 3478775_3480555
&-um why is it through clothes ? 3481075_3483915
so you wanna yeah . 3484775_3489215
you wanna think about those kinds of ways of making connections . 3489495_3491955
and I think even &-uh doesn't Crawford make the point that that's more important in suburbs &-um or in in &~th in actually modern the way America is most Americans live now no matter where they live &-um &~b because you don't live in a sort_of fixed community where people know your whole history and stuff ? 3494795_3517695
+, mhm +/.
+, right ?
so you probably wanna &-um they don't know your connections they don't know your family they don't know you so you the +/. 3518395_3526395
+, oh yeah +/. 3526435_3526775
+, &~th the statement you make with the consumer items that you wear becomes more important now that may not be so important in Howell . 3527435_3532915
certainly not important for your grandma . 3533535_3534835
(be)cause she has all those connections . 3535195_3536995
+, right +/. 3537335_3537695
+, right ? 3538075_3538415
so you wanna think about those kinds of theoretical moves that Crawford and &-um Bourgois &-um make . 3538995_3550035
in &~non &~ne the sort_of the traditional sociology term for this is non face to face communities . 3550195_3561335
you don't need to use that but that's what I'm writing down here just as a shorthand for that argument . 3562195_3565395
⌈ right ⌉ ? 3565895_3565955
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ okay +/. 3566215_3566535
+, and my shorthand for &-um In Search of Respect is ISR +... 3567145_3569865
so probably actually what you should do is go back and actually just &-um read this one more time go back and read the Crawford one more time and see if there're any sort_of other sort_of arguments that help you out . 3570265_3584785
+, ⌈ mkay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and ⌋ look at your notes from the class think about the symbolic capital stuff in In Search for Respect and then figure out how to weave those into what you've got here you know ? 3585445_3594645
you don't need to restructure it entirely but just where are they gonna let you &~dra and you know several places I've said you should &-um expand like &-um like this point of people feeling pressure to buy clothes from stores right ? 3594955_3610595
from these brand names so that's you can use them to expand that argument about the meaning of brand names in contemporary society and why they're so important right ? 3610975_3620115
we know they're important &=laughs +/. 3620195_3620855
+, mhm mhm +/.
+, &-um but why ? 3621875_3623635
and why not maybe for your grandma ? 3623795_3625975
and why for people who go to malls in Novi ? 3626215_3629295
&-um &=pause_while_reading so &-um Abercrombie's more expensive than American Eagle ? 3629695_3646715
oh yeah . 3646855_3647195
it's +/.
⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 3647435_3647615
+, ⌊ about ⌋ twice as much +/. 3647715_3648315
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 3648475_3648935
+, ⌊ almost ⌋ .
even though they're like the same clothes basically . 3651685_3655085
yeah . 3655705_3658805
okay here you go . 3659065_3660945
now this is these are important observations about what stores are in this mall &-um but you just make the observations and don't kind of milk them for the kinds of connections you can make to the stuff we've talked about in class right ? 3661565_3673265
so &-um here's a good example this is clearly a like middle middle+class not an upper upper middle+class mall right ? 3673595_3683655
&-um and (0.6) and in in our kind of little chart about on the the column that says consumption &-um remember how we talk about sort of the niche the sort_of niche marketing of of even malls right ? 3684975_3705575
so that malls really carefully analyze their and this Crawford's argument too &~re malls really carefully analyze the income the style the &-um &-uh desires of the people in the surrounding area . 3705655_3720075
and choose the stores and the decor and everything else to match and stimulate those desires right ? 3721075_3727895
&-um you wanna maybe think about that argument and and maybe even &-um and talk about it a little bit &-um as to so &~y so we can understand why maybe we have JC Penney's Sears Hudson's and Lord and Taylor and not Nieman_Marcus and Nordstrom's right ? 3728895_3747615
mhm +/.
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 3748495_3750555

so that's just you know it's in this paragraph make that point . 3751815_3754075
I mean this worked out okay . 3756675_3756915
absolutely . 3758415_3759335
&=pause_while_reading I would actually drop this &-um because &-uh here you're you're talking about youth right ? 3768455_3777155
so this is a youth section . 3777235_3778415
&=pause_while_reading oh I see . 3784345_3784805
well I see . 3785085_3785485
I see you're trying +//. 3785905_3786365
I got it . 3786485_3787205
&-um this should be a youth section . 3787725_3790105

⌊ &~jus should I move ⌋ this or just take it out ? 3791365_3792605

⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.

⌊ oh ⌋ +/.
+, at malls before . 3806885_3807705

yeah and then they also go to window shop and stuff I dunno ⌈ I guess ⌉ . 3810195_3813155
⌊ yeah ⌋ so so move move before or something +/. 3813155_3815455
okay +/.
+, &-um or &-uh +... 3817475_3821055
yeah . 3821475_3823235
or something (be)cause this is the section about youth . 3823755_3825355
make it be about youth . 3825615_3826255
(0.5) and you might wanna summarize here &-um what you said you know as discussed above adults come to the malls for +... 3829325_3840525
above adults come to malls (0.5) for <blah@b diddee@b> blah@b diddee@b da@b youth come to malls for +//. 3845075_3857735
okay ? 3858155_3858375
&-um here I would &-um why is this important in suburbs ? 3859035_3865255
right ? 3865895_3866215
(be)cause you need to have a car to go anywhere +/. 3867135_3869055
right +/. 3869615_3869935
+, yeah . 3870375_3870435
okay so .
I didn't hang out in a mall when I was a kid and my parents would never drive me around right ? 3871095_3875895
but like &~f it is you're right this is a very important point like youth can't drive they can't drive period . 3875995_3880495
&=laughs &-um so malls the the way malls bring stores and and movies and everything together are even maybe more important for young people right ? 3881115_3894575
&-um &=pause_while_reading wow now that is interesting . 3896005_3914165
what's up with that do you think ? 3914485_3915365
well she did I . 3916205_3917205
okay here we go . 3917525_3917945

⌈ well ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ here ⌋ here here you go . 3926695_3927295
&-um here's a kind of example of where you're trying to make a connection but the &~im the importance tying paragraphs together is not so important . 3928275_3938695
what's important is having your argument clear throughout . 3939115_3942395
right ? 3942715_3943015
so instead of trying to make that kind of connection &-um think about sort of how this point fits in to the previous points and tell me what this paragraph is about . 3943465_3955945
do you see what I mean ? 3956425_3956825
&-um the it's not +//. 3958045_3958985
flow is not so important in this sense of like every paragraph leading perfectly &~int into the other . 3959865_3966445
what's important is the argument being consistent and flowing throughout . 3966965_3970865
right ? 3971335_3971695
&-um so . 3971855_3975215
&-uh alright now here you're talking about adults again . 3976455_3979795

&=laughs what is aesthetically ? 4028445_4029905
is doesn't hafta be visual . 4030165_4032125

it's just kind_of artistically in some sense ? 4032925_4034805
mhm +/.
+, right . 4035065_4035845
so it doesn't hafta be visually . 4036245_4037265

right +..? 4055665_4056245
okay . 4060445_4060705
I think this is a really important point . 4060725_4064145
that needs to be somewhere else . 4064625_4066105
&-um because here is &-um +... 4068585_4072745
this is a way that malls design themselves to be places you wanna socialize right ? 4075505_4081505
that's the point of this paragraph . 4082145_4083225
&-um and this applies for everybody right ? 4084805_4087205
for adults for youth for everyone so you might wanna put this early +... 4087215_4093455
does that make sense ? 4094975_4097995
&=laughs there's just some of that in for +...
now . 4098795_4101135
what did you observe about the way Twelve Oaks is designed ? 4109175_4117655
that is &-um I mean does it have oh you said it's gonna have a glass elevator . 4117935_4125395

okay so it has two glass &~elev it's no . 4133475_4137455
two glass elevators &-um fountains marble what ? 4137705_4142265
fountain there's a fountain . 4142665_4144025

+, there was only one crappy elevator and oh what else +... 4190005_4193125
okay . 4193295_4195535
&~he here's these two things do belong together . 4195875_4199575
but they I think belong earlier right ? 4200235_4201955
because here's the the problem is that &-um Novi was an early mall right ? 4202175_4207775
I &~th yeah . 4208355_4208895
fairly early you said it was made in the seventies ⌈ right ⌉ ? 4209155_4210835
⌊ uhuh ⌋ +/.

(0.6) ignore what you wrote . 4223195_4226935
you didn't tell me why they're renovating it . 4227015_4228795
but you thoughtfully put these two paragraphs together because you think they belong together and you're right . 4229535_4234995
so why do you think they're renovating the mall ? 4237255_4239475
&~s &~s it's just to make sure that people go there instead of other places . 4241575_4246115
okay to make sure people go there now why do they have to renovate it ? 4246395_4249195
because of . 4250815_4252375
so that people will go there . 4252655_4253455
instead of other nicer malls . 4253755_4255275
okay right so I mean it's about this in some sense it's about kind of creating a beautiful &-um fantasy space . 4255735_4265555
right ?
that's &-um up with the times right ? 4266795_4270135
that's not somehow like seventies style right ? 4270255_4272555
&=laughs &-um that's not but that's not only up with the times but of_course the standards of sort_of mall decor have increased right ? 4273185_4279005
so they kind of &-um I mean it's not gonna have real Siberian tigers and Ching dynasty vases even when it is redesigned but like since malls have gotten to be more and more luxurious spaces on the inside people's &~ec expectations of malls as spaces of luxury have increased right ? 4279105_4296645
&-um and Novi <hasta> hasta remodel or it's gonna somehow seem like some seventies strip mall . 4297585_4302865
and if it doesn't succeed in being a comfortable &-um you know fantasy space people won't socialize there and if people don't socialize there people don't shop there right ? 4303265_4314925
(be)cause the socializing and shopping experience is tied . 4315245_4318065

and you need to set this argument up for me of malls as socializing spaces +... 4494455_4497675
and and you need to &-um in that you should look at Crawford for her argument of how socializing and buying get linked right ? 4503115_4512655
and then you can go through your family you know that &~th &~th this takes different forms for different people right ? 4512835_4521475
you've got families you've got old people you've got youth right ? 4521515_4525835
mhm .
that make sense ? 4527115_4527555
yeah +... 4527815_4527935
now why do you think that there's nobody in the middle ? 4537395_4541615
why do you think it's forty five to sixty and +/. 4541915_4543695
+, seventeen to nineteen year+olds ⌈ that work there ⌉ ? 4544195_4545395
⌊ she said ⌋ it was you_know the gap between you know the baby boomers and and the you know and youth but I didn't really see how that would kind_of fit in to my +/. 4545415_4555275
⌈ no .

+, ⌊ argument so I just used it as a ⌋ transition . 4555435_4556755
yeah &-um +... 4557455_4558895
I don't exactly know what it's about either . 4564085_4565765
&-um mall jobs don't pay good wages . 4566565_4569985
mhm +/.
+, right ?
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ they're ⌋ pretty badly paying service jobs . 4570565_4572825
&-um so it makes sense that young people would get them . 4574005_4576365
&-um and it makes sense that retired people might get them to supplement their income . 4578305_4583485
there're also probably not a_lot_of them even full+time . 4584645_4586745
like they often hire you know part+time casual labor &-um +... 4586965_4590165
so it's an interesting question it's it very possibly could be that &-um these are you know displaced workers in some sense . 4593945_4601765
&-um and that &-um +... 4602645_4607205
you know displaced from I don't know what but &-uh +... 4608245_4612945
and they've hadta take significant pay and status cuts working at the mall . 4614505_4620145
so I mean that's just an interesting +//. 4620605_4621465
to think about &~i you can't probably get the answer to it but &-um +... 4621565_4625145
alright so &-um +... 4627725_4630845
so it seems &~pr I mean it seems like you've got all the details that you need . 4635225_4640625
what you need is a slightly clearer frame . 4641485_4643885
and I think it's even like in a fine order to do the Howell stuff first then to do the Novi stuff &-um what you need to make sure you do is not &-um don't get caught up in your transitions as much and instead like ask yourself alright what's the argument of this section ? 4643865_4664745
&-um have I used the materials from +//. 4666365_4670005
have I used Crawford's argument sufficiently have I used Davis' &~sif sufficiently have I really argued each of the sections right ? 4670085_4677865
so like the security section you need to make sure and I think the security section is pretty good that's a good example . 4678045_4682225
where'd it go ? 4683485_4687145
security +... 4688365_4689405
where'd your security section go ? 4693365_4695805
oh here we go . 4695965_4697365
mhm security yeah . 4698655_4699135
&-um (0.7) I mean <here's the> here's the good place where you need to you know &-um +... 4700335_4711555
here's a place where you could tie this need for security need to feel safe to broader sort_of transformations why do people need to feel safe right now +..? 4713055_4723315
you know ? 4725635_4726335
why need to feel safe +... 4727485_4728545
&-um <why does> why does safety equal +... 4731225_4737065
&-um fairly homogenous +... 4740085_4742185
&-um especially in terms of class &-um social groups you know ? 4745925_4753305
okay so . 4753765_4754705
so there's a good opportunity for you to look outward a little bit and ask how this connects to some of those bigger things we've been talking about . 4754965_4763665
so look for other opportunities to do that and you &~can you don't need to write whole paragraphs about that right you just need a_couple_of sentences that will help actually structure help highlight and structure your argument . 4764665_4777465
&-um and then it'll be totally great . 4778885_4780645
okay &=laughs is the was the end okay ? 4781535_4784315
I mean . 4784515_4784655
&~i &~it ended a little quickly &=laughs ⌈ I mean these are good ⌉ . 4785375_4788075

so I just asked the question ⌈ you know ⌉ ? 4798335_4799495
⌊ okay ⌋ asking the question is good now &-um Davis and Crawford . 4799495_4805055
you're right they don't actually give great answers but they they give some answers right they &~s they suggest it does &~ac some things . 4805545_4812685
do you agree with them or not +..? 4812805_4813545
well I guess I don't . 4816785_4818145
well I dunno I mean you know maybe partly maybe not entirely &-um &-uh yeah I mean these are really good questions . 4818345_4827745
I don't expect you to be able to answer them . 4828185_4829685
right ? 4830065_4830105
I mean these are big questions . 4830245_4831765
&-um but you &=laughs that's very cute . 4832485_4837205
it might be fine to end with these kinds of questions . 4838125_4844905
&-um but you need to +... 4845925_4846985
&-um make this a little more expand this a little bit more right ? 4850425_4856925
so what have you argued in this paper ? 4857185_4859105
remind me . 4860045_4860865
right ? 4861505_4861585
okay +/. 4862125_4862525
+, &-um and then you you might wanna &-um discuss a little bit more I mean okay . 4863865_4870945
why would maybe &-um the consumer &~connec sorta the connection between consumer &-um well the connection between buying whatever and socializing that you find in in the mall in Novi why might that strengthen or weaken the social fabric of America ? 4871925_4891965
+, okay +/. 4892825_4893385
+, I mean &~y you wanna I mean those are good questions but &-um you haven't like laid &~ou you know why might they ? 4893585_4900865
&-um and you know Davis and Crawford have some answers right ? 4902285_4905085
I mean they suggest that malls increase sort_of segregated socializing experiences &-um make people more fearful of strangers in some ways because we're more fearful of uncontrolled environments because they expect a certain level of security . 4905105_4921925
&-um do &-um +... 4923265_4928005
you know Davis suggests more sort_of fundamentally that socializing through commodities has a negative effect on relations between people . 4931765_4938705
you at least wanna think about that argument . 4939965_4941145
you don't hafta agree with it or &~y or disagree with it necessarily but you wanna +//. 4941905_4945145
maybe you could do it in terms of questions but you need the questions to be more &~s &-um more textured more substantive more more elaborated so you see what I mean ? 4946445_4957065
yeah yeah . 4957245_4957965
&-um and partly I think when I say that &-um I also just want you to be making those connections as you go through about malls you know stimulating consumer desire right ? 4961235_4975835
&-um about &-uh what else +..? 4976755_4981555
&-um you know you might want to in the section that you're talking &-um well maybe not . 4985505_4993725
&-um (0.6) oh and about sort of &-um malls as spaces that &-um connect &-uh socializing and &-um buying right ? 4995465_5016505
I mean the kind of point of Crawford +/. 5016705_5017805

you look about as tired as I am . 5024375_5025755

I'm tired &=laughs:S2 okay . 5026175_5027935

&-um &-uh &~d do &~y did I do a reasonable job like +... 5050895_5055595

⌊ yeah ⌋ well &-um you haven't made the connection to the economic shifts right ? 5072575_5077215
I mean do you see what I mean by that ? 5077235_5079395
I've suggested places that you can right ? 5080615_5085775
so &-um both when you're looking at what stores are in the mall right ? 5086095_5096795
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.

+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ right ⌋ ?
&-um so that information is here but that point isn't you know you haven't made that argument . 5123325_5129425
so you should work to do that &-um the other sort_of obvious place to do that &-um in terms of the &-uh (0.6) oh &-um &~w you know one is in the security right ? 5129685_5152365
why now ? 5152625_5154465
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ right ⌋ ? 5154685_5154945
&-um and in part it's &-uh you know the question of fear of crime being a sort_of broader cultural phenomenon right ? 5155645_5164585
<people are> &~sc people are scared because of media representation for all sorts of reasons &-um and partly because &-uh there are a_lot_of really really poor people &=laughs &-um there are a_lot_of homeless people and &-um +... 5164865_5179425
that kind of &~ex increasing inequality &-um you got lots_of strategies for dealing with it right ? 5183195_5192055
and the strategy we're kind of engaged in now is a strategy of making sure people just stay away from each_other and then feel safe right ? 5192155_5199075
&-um so there's another place where you can you know make that broader a a connection to sort_of broader both cultural and sort_of economic things going on . 5200265_5212025

we've had is +//. 9550425_9550945

is that &-um seeing as Focus Hope is in Detroit and then Project &~Re +/. 9552905_9559045

+, Renewal is in New York that shows the major problems of each individual city . 9559265_9564465
okay right . 9564745_9565345
or okay lemme help you reformulate that into a kind of academic thesis . 9566095_9570135
&-um something like &-um (be)cause (be)cause you wanna think like we've done in this class sort_of repeatedly about these organizations as both &-um their &~resp they look the way they do in part because of the kinds of problems they're trying to respond to right ? 9570855_9588275
&-um &-uh but they don't themselves sort_of create those problems &=laughs right like in some way +/. 9588855_9599235
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so ⌋ you you might wanna say that in_order_to understand &-um the programs and sort_of missions of these two organizations +/. 9599815_9609535
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ we ⌋ have to understand them within the context of the you know political and economic situations in these two cities . 9610315_9619215
right ? 9619675_9619695
+, mhm +/.
+, so I think that's &-um a fine beginning of a thesis statement . 9620015_9629315
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um (0.6) and and maybe in addition to it of of these two cities and of sort_of the nation as a whole at this particular moment right that lets you like look broader . 9630295_9646575
+, yeah +/. 9647055_9647075
+, &-um because there're things that &-um these cities have in common and that the populations that they're trying to help have in common as well +/. 9647335_9654995
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-um ⌋ so I mean that seems to me as a good start . 9655775_9659715
now +... 9660095_9660155
what else what are your other thoughts about sort of the thesis and how your argument would go as it goes through ? 9664815_9668795
well I I had some ideas I mean one was to kind_of focus more on the actual mission statements and just do a_lot about that &-um but then I thought that shouldn't be the &~f the focus point but it should be just kind_of in you know +/. 9669195_9686575

+, &-um . 9690775_9692515
I think I agree with you there because +/. 9694235_9695335
it's +/. 9696055_9696355
+, mission statements are generally too vague to &-um I mean I think they're important to analyze and especially the Focus Hope one which is the one I remember +/. 9696565_9704385
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-um ⌋ it was interesting because it it is explicitly trying to bring you know city and suburb together and like through sort_of service solve those kind_of big divides that have created the disaster that Detroit is . 9705185_9719325
&=laughs:multiple &-um so yeah so I think it's important to look at them but I wouldn't just stick only with them . 9719835_9725775
right &-um I &-uh I dunno I mean like it just seems that &~Ne that New York and Detroit are like they're both major cities and Detroit during its heyday is more comparable to New York now than +/. 9726065_9753345

+, and &-uh . 9755925_9756285
you know who you need to think about to think about New York and Detroit ? 9759765_9763545
and I can't remember if I told you this before is Saskia Sassens . 9763905_9766605
Detroit is a global city . 9767605_9769905
mhm +/.
+, it is the kind of city she's talking about . 9770585_9772845
&-um mm in that whole book that we only read a couple chapters from . 9773385_9776045
+, right +/. 9776285_9776545
+, &-um and I don't know if you remember but in that chapter she talks about how &-um these global cities &-um have become +/. 9776695_9786795
+, oh sorry +/. 9787475_9787715
+, centers that are in a way more connected to each_other irregardless of like national boundaries +/. 9788755_9794175
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ than to ⌋ other cities in their own country . 9794995_9798335
and that cities who have not become global cities like Detroit &-um have lost the sort_of a_lot_of their economic functions and have and find themselves +//. 9798865_9811645
I mean Detroit has a particular history that's not only caused by this kind of economic change as we learned but &-um Detroit is that kind of newly marginalized urban center &-um +/. 9811825_9824885
+, mhm +/.
+, so she might help you put those two cities like into connection with each_other in the contemporary moment . 9825675_9832095
you see what I mean ? 9832515_9832995
mhm .
&=writes so should become +...

okay +/. 9851795_9851935
+, definitely . 9852435_9852875
now I've got one caveat . 9853495_9856755
&-um I think this is a start for a thesis right ? 9858095_9863035
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.

+, mhm +/.
+, &-um start to work through these arguments about &-um how we need to understand these organizations within their contexts in these two &~d very different cities which you may be able to frame as a whole with Sassens's argument right ? 9870255_9890735
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-um ⌋ and then after you've kind of worked through that to some degree &-um and you know incorporated your analysis of the sort_of mission statements etcetera you need to be thinking about &-um +... 9891195_9908195
the economic context of these two cities doesn't determine what these organizations are gonna do . 9912455_9918715
right ? 9919455_9919795

+, ⌊ I mean ⌋ it sort of creates a set of problems that these organizations are trying to respond to . 9919795_9923995

+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so once ⌋ you lay out sort of +... 9930435_9932275

+, ⌊ the way ⌋ like the kind of the structural context of these organizations and the problems they're trying to respond to and how they're different and &-um &-um and how their mission statements and their organizations try to respond to them you wanna sort_of analyze &-um both like why they've made the choices that they've made +/. 9939575_9959915

+, &-um and what the limitations of those choices are . 9961115_9964875

so I mean thinking about the the film we saw today both of these organizations have really different ways of addressing problems than Dudley Street . 9965395_9975835

+, ⌊ they're ⌋ addressed to solve right and here's the reason I ask you this question all the time . 10046185_10049825

+, hm +/.
+, &-um to solve problems by solving individual problems . 10061885_10068065
right ? 10068265_10069345
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um and that's important . 10070825_10073745
I'm not saying that's a bad thing . 10074245_10075445
but if we don't think that the problems are caused at the level of individual behavior &-um then &~an then solutions that are addressed to individual behavior or education or whatever are fundamentally limited . 10076245_10095365
+, yeah +/. 10096145_10096225
so &~yo you just wanna think about that and &-um and you know Bourgois obviously talks about that in his book &-um +/. 10099845_10109865
+, yeah +/. 10111065_10111105
