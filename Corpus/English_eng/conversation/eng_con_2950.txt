so in this problem, we were trying to solve twenty-six minus eight, and we decided to use a number line and someone decided that the first step that we should do is to take away six . 7395_19475
do you agree or disagree that that's a good first step to solve this problem ? 20395_25135
talk with your partner about whether you agree or disagree about this first step . 25565_29865
they could just take away two . 30225_31825
you'll get to the round number . 32985_33925
all right . 34225_34765
S_two ?
S_two, do you agree or disagree that this is a good first step to solve this problem ? 35185_40765
I agree because if you take away six it goes to the round number . 41025_46765
are you sure ? 47285_47825
how do you know ? 48265_49105
because there's six ones and if you take away six ones, that goes to the round number . 52205_58085
and what's the round number here ? 58205_59385
what round number are we going to trying to get to ? 59485_61225
twenty . 61465_61725
twenty . 62025_62405
do you want to repeat what she just said, S_three ? 62645_64185
so you also agreed that this was a good first step ? 64225_69805
can she say it again ? 69885_70885
sure . 71025_71185
ask her . 71265_71645
if you take away six, it goes to the round number because there's six ones and if you take away six ones, it goes to twenty . 74075_80555
if you take away six, it gets to the round number, (be)cause there's six ones . 81275_86515
it goes +... 87435_87695
and then it goes to twenty . 88695_90855
and why do you want to get to twenty ? 91615_92895
what's helpful about that ? 93035_94335
because it's a round number . 94495_95855
it's a round number . 96035_97015
what's going to be the second step of this problem ? 97475_99455
turn and talk with your partner about what's going to be the second step . 100615_103755
minus two !
why take away two ? 105695_108075
to get to the right number . 108575_110275
the right number ? 110555_111255
to get to the number that we'll want to . 111635_114215
take away six . 114515_115155
so you know something about eight ? 115295_116795
yeah .
you know something about breaking up eight ? 117235_119015
yeah .
yes ? 119415_119835
what do you know about breaking up eight ? 120835_122455
that since we are taking away six then it has to be two because six, seven, eight, and then yeah . 123975_134895
you agree, S_six ? 135615_136355
what's going to be the next step ? 136355_138295
minus two . 138695_140775
why ? 141035_141275
for me is very hard to explain . 142135_144115
it is kind of hard to explain, it's a lot right ? 144395_147115
S_seven, what do you think ? 147355_148095
I think six plus two is eight . 150425_152285
so if you minus two from the round number then it would equal eighteen . 153065_158865
I'm going to ask you to share that when I stand back up . 159245_161205
okay ? 161405_161425
do you want to practice with your partner saying what you're going to say ? 161445_163705
S_seven's going to share what he thinks the next step should be . 164045_167905
so if we're trying to solve twenty-six take away eight, the first step was take away six . 168285_173525
S_seven, what should our second step be ? 173925_175585
take away two . 176265_176925
take away two ? 177425_178045
why ? 178405_178505
because six plus two equals eight . 178905_181525
do you agree with him, S_three ? 182445_183385
yeah . 183625_184305
you agree ? 184745_185165
can anyone say what S_seven just said ? 185485_187525
can anyone repeat it ? 187585_188665
S_eight ?
it needs to take away two . 189045_193005
why ? 193225_193645
because it will be easier ? 194605_196645
is that what you said ? 197245_198165
I didn't hear you say easier . 198205_199485
I said six plus two equals eight . 200585_205705
so the next jump has to be two . 206425_208985
can you say that, S_eight ? 209785_211045
because six plus two equals eight ? 211045_214025
so we took away the six . 215525_216885
so now we should take away the ? 217325_219025
the two ? 220505_221485
the two . 222065_222425
alright, so here's what that would look like . 224305_226165
and where would we land, S_nine ? 227525_231105
eighteen ? 235045_235445
eighteen . 235505_236105
that had a question mark at the end . 236205_237765
is it eighteen ? 237925_240485
or is it eighteen . 240925_242345
eighteen . 242665_242965
it's eighteen . 243205_243845
and how do you know it's eighteen ? 244185_245325
because twenty minus two is eighteen, and nineteen minus one is eighteen . 246205_259645
okay . 260005_260325
so you could either do twenty minus two or you could do twenty minus one minus one . 260585_265245
so could everyone turn and talk with their partner about why we did minus two next ? 265625_270385
