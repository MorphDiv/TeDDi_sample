but it is not equilateral . 0_1146
okay ? 1146_1626
you try you try to draw +... 1626_3240
in your classwork exercise book first . 3240_6690
okay, please be quick . 6690_31676
please be quick . 31676_32255
okay, can you get the meaning of the uh, questions ? 32255_61695

yes, good . 63536_64211
you you try to draw +... 64211_65731
the uh, four sided polygon, it is equilateral and it is not equiangular . 65731_74105
another four sided polygon, it is equiangular and it is not equilateral . 74105_80718
and also, for the five sided polygon . 80718_83258
that means, you have to draw four four different diagrams . 83258_91446
four different diagrams . 91446_93121
0 . 93121_147306
&=bell okay, I give you one more minute . 147306_157311
and then would somebody come out to try to draw your answers on the board . 157311_163373
four four different types of the diagram . 163373_177316
the four sided and also the five sided . 177316_179525
okay ? 179525_236788
have you finished ? 236788_237858
okay, try to look at the board . 237858_240340
I want you to draw a four sided polygon, it is equilateral but it is not equiangular . 240340_248998
understand ? 248998_249945
it is not . 249945_250473
and also, another four sided polygon, it is equiangular but it is not equilateral . 250473_257258
got the point ? 257258_258391
okay . 258391_259961
would someone come out and and to draw . 259961_263696
okay, for this type . 263696_270073
you try try to come out and draw . 270073_272591
number six . 272591_274798
number six, yes . 274798_278351
and then, uh, &~anoth another one, this part . 278351_282215
twenty . 282215_282775
where's twenty ? 282775_285448
yes . 285448_286856
be careful of the wire . 286856_288120
okay, thirty two . 288120_292513
thirty two . 292513_293250
hey, I want you to to draw this one . 293250_295748
thirty two . 295748_297475
and then for equiangular, nineteen ? 297475_303018
where's nineteen ? 303018_305520
yeah, you . 305520_306906
&~o okay, we look at the four sided polygon . 306906_337356
okay ? 337356_337855
we called it quadrilateral . 337855_339873
uh, I can use some mark to present it is equilateral . 339873_345873
these four sides are equal . 345873_349615
okay, get it ? 349615_350806
do you find that this angle is greater than one hundred and eighty degrees ? 350806_356135
no, not not not one hundred and eighty . 356135_359141
it's greater than ninety degrees . 359141_360943
it is less than ninety degrees, so it's good . 360943_366118
okay, how about this one ? 366118_366693
uh, this boy +... 366693_370295
used the mark to show that they are right angles . 370295_377423
can you find that the, uh length between these two sides are different ? 377423_381460
can you get the point ? 381460_382760
okay, look look look at the five sided polygon, we call it pentagon . 382760_386718
what what are the differences between them ? 386718_388775
can you find out the difference ? 388775_390921
uh, I am not satisfied with these two answers . 390921_396561
I I want another two to try to to uh, to show that they are different . 396561_403518
okay ? 403518_403990
to show some differences between them . 403990_405976
I want this pentagon equilateral but it is not equiangular . 405976_412111
I want you to draw this five sided polygon, it is equiangular but it is not equilateral . 412111_418951
okay, you try it again . 418951_419903
another two . 419903_422815

okay, this angle two angles are ninety degrees . 491340_510621
okay ? 510621_511840
can you get it ? 511840_512563
do you find that uh uh, the shape of this two five sided polygons are different ? 512563_518395
can you get it ? 518395_519616
okay, I as(k) I ask you another question . 519616_523098
if +... 523098_524570
can you can you draw can you draw a four sided polygon, it is equilateral and it is equiangular ? 524570_534450
okay ? 534450_536456
it is equilateral and it is equiangular . 536456_539696
can you ? 539696_549606
okay, I want you to draw in this column . 549606_566003
