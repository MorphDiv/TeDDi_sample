some parents take it offensive though . 0_1619
and and ah th like this past weekend this this one coach . 1619_5453
I called a flagrant foul . 5453_7072
on his fifth and sixth grade team . 7072_9037
three weekends ago . 9037_10061
flagrant p@l f@l . 10061_11168
flagrant was okay, this was the situation . 11168_13312
there is a kid, dribbling down the court and he has a wide open lay up . 13312_17491
his his the kid on his team, was right behind him, okay ? 17491_23290
uhhuh . 23290_23802
and my instinct when I'm an official I always say, “let em go::” you know, lay off them so that they don't do something stupid you know: hit them in the back and hurt them . 23802_30224
I always say just let ⌈em go⌉ . 30224_31232
⌊you can talk⌋ to them during the game ? 31232_32672
I just pull the whistle on them . 32672_34042
I just yell at them . 34042_34554
the official can say anything . 34554_35411
no one hears it except you know, the players . 35411_36947
I'm like let 'em go, let 'em go . 36947_38483
well this kid trips over his own two feet . 38483_41043
huh heh heh heh heh . 41043_42067
and as he's falling, he grabs onto the back of the player holding uh carrying the ball . 42067_49056
and he pulls down his jersey and pulls him down . 49056_51895
and I was like: “whoa:, all right”, I had a decision to make . 51895_55200
obviously it was it wasn't with the intent to hurt him:, because he tripped . 55200_60237
but then again he did obstruct him from getting a wide open lay up . 60237_63654
so I ju I was like, “well, you know”, I called the flagrant, which is the arms crossed . 63654_68083
if you want to call a flagrent with aggression, with the intent to hurt, you have the arms crossed, then you've got to swing them down . 68083_73382
like really, really hard . 73382_75596
&=sniffs . 75596_76025
then you know it's like that was a really serious foul . 76025_77894
and that's a technical and you can get kicked out of the game for doing something like that . 77894_80966
mhm . 80966_81328
I just called the simple flagrant . 81328_82435
the coach went nuts, he went nuts . 82435_83971
so this past weekend I'm officiating this game . 83971_86102
uhhuh . 86102_86960
not not not even close to the same situation, I officiate the entire game, everything went so smoothly . 86960_92246
he didn't say two words to me other than, you know, he warned me about one of his players almost getting hurt, I'm like, “whatever” . 92246_97366
you know you just you blow it off . 97366_98736
you completely look through him, you say thank you sir, you know, I'll look into that, and you walk away . 98736_102570
well at the end of the game, he came up to me, and his exact words were: I don't know if I should bleep this out or anything . 102570_107952
nuh . 107952_108352
the exact words were, he came he came up to me and said, “you mother fucker” . 108352_118192
“you're holding a grudge from three weeks ago” . 118192_120656
and I'm just sitting, you know, and I'm like, “oh my god” . 120656_124769
right ? 124769_126222
and my first reaction was to say to him, you know, something very sarcastic about his mother ? 126222_131158
considering he brought that into effect ? 131158_132611
mhm . 132611_132728
huh huh huh . 132728_133040
but I thought, this guy paid money to be in this tournament . 133040_135421
and I said, “sir, I'm in college, I can't remember three weeks ago”, and ⌈I walked away⌉ . 135421_140624
⌊huh huh huh huh⌋ . 140624_141203
that's what I said to him, ⌈and I walked away⌉ . 141203_144125
⌊that's funny⌋ . 144125_144816
and he went straight to my coach . 144816_148650
and said “this tournament's this and that and da da da da da” . 148650_152400
yadda yadda yadda . 152400_153603
and my coach just laughed when he heard what I said ? 153603_155984
huh huh ⌈huh huh⌉ . 155984_157270
⌊Huh huh he just⌋ laughed, he came up to me, he was like, “that was great” . 157270_159402
huh huh huh I was like, “well, you know” . 159402_160788
that guy was such a jerk ! 160788_162557
that's good ! 162557_162986
oh I hate that guy . 162986_164522
