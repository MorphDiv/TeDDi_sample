kind of . 151637_155831
even enough . 155831_157563
so it's a pretty row and a ugly row . 157563_161109
what about if you just put them all on the same row ? 161109_163208
that'd be weird . 163208_165671
that would be weird ? 165671_166671

that's how you make a rainbow . 189332_191164
okay . 191164_192230
that's how you make a rainbow . 192230_195077
do you make rainbows at your school ? 195077_196891
do you have playdough at school ? 196891_198256
we have playdough people bring playdough to my school and and Miss yyy keeps the playdough and then she borrows it . 198256_209545
she borrows it in her classroom . 209545_211627
and then you get to play with it ? 211627_213009
no &+uh . 211627_213075
you need to make it in a rainbow shape like this . 213075_215173
okay I will . 215173_218004
but first I'm gonna make the snakes first you're right . 218004_220552
that's how it goes . 220552_222367
that's not real though . 222367_223915
but it goes a little bit wider . 223915_226646
like that . 226646_228094
see ? 228094_228527
okay . 228527_229559
kinda that's look like a rainbow . 229559_230924
a real rainbow . 230924_232290
so that one is red . 232290_235937
they need to be the same height . 235937_238751
okay I'm trying . 238751_241032
0 . 241032_244395
this one's too long . 244395_246393
it's pretty fat is what it is . 246393_248757
pretty wide . 248757_251056
you can make your rainbow longer . 251056_253804
a longer day ? 253804_256168
or maybe yyy . 256168_259166
don't put them together because I have to take them apart . 259166_260813
that's the one thing . 260813_262062
but I like them squished together so they stay like that forever . 262062_266092
no I don't want it to stay like that forever . 266092_268356
is this one too long ? 268356_271902
it's still too wide . 272336_275450
I think you should keep rolling don't you think ? 275450_278097
I wanna break some in half so it's better . 278097_281094
good idea . 281094_282093
see ? 282093_284374
I don't think the rainbow has brown in it do you ? 284374_287555
no they don't . 287555_289285
okay . 289285_290201
