they're the same . 0_3815
it's the same . 3815_4500
they're the same . 4500_5120
so an up flip is the same as a down flip ? 5120_7408
no . 7408_8105
+< yep . 8105_8775
no . 8775_11100
+< yeah yeah . 11100_12058
+< no . 12058_13343

+< they're different . 14761_15528
okay well watch this one . 15528_17263
+< it's the same . 17263_17526
watch . 17681_19065
okay I'm trying to lay so that I don't you got everybody
+^ this is the core they started with that's what they want it to
I'm going to first flip it up . 31231_34085
watch what happens . 34085_35521
okay . 35521_37088
now I'm going to go back to where we started and now I'm going to
hmm what happens each time ? 42026_45353
it's the same ! 45353_46788
it goes it's the it goes to the same thing . 46788_48850
flipping it up or flipping it down . 48850_51200
well if you start with the same core square right . 51200_53025
okay let's take two of their core squares and put (th)em in exactly
okay can everybody see ? 62200_64035
oh Dani I'm concerned your eyes aren't even on the middle . 64035_66951
do you have something in your hands ? 66951_67960
put it away please . 67960_68980
okay . 68980_69983
don't play with the binder . 69983_71181
look at these two . 71181_72381
is there anybody who thinks that they're not exactly the same ? 72381_75086
I think that they're the same right now . 75086_77751
does anybody think that they're not in the same position ? 77751_79670
+^ I tried to put them in exactly the same position . 79670_81970
I think that they are in exactly the same position . 81970_84081
okay I'm gonna flip one up and I'm gonna
do you think they'll look the same when I'm done or different . 87475_90151
+< same . 90151_90220
+< yeah . 90220_90700
but Brittany you told me an up down an up flip is different than a
I changed my mind . 93855_95026
changed your mind ? 95026_95490
okay let's see what we figure out . 95490_97006
what we're trying to find out is is an up flip the same as a down
yeah . 101010_102211
okay this one I'm going to flip up . 102211_104696
watch . 104696_105863
I flipped it up . 105863_107881
flipped xxx . 107881_108633
+< this one I'm gonna flip down . 108633_110550
xxx . 110550_111693
same . 111693_112000
+< they're the same ! 112000_113895
they're the same . 113895_114723
maybe that was just their core square . 114723_117051
maybe they had a weird core square . 117051_118538
let's try it with this core square . 118538_120603
okay . 120603_123638
do they look the same they was I have them now ? 123638_126808
yes . 126808_127506
okay I'm gonna flip one up and one down . 127506_130676
flip up . 130676_132528
flip down . 132528_134413
it's the same . 134413_135480
same . 135480_136215
good do you think we have to test it on their core square ? 136215_139500
yeah . 139500_140000
all right . 140000_140973
xxx . 140973_142551
okay now I remember how this one goes (be)cause the yellow end up
+< yes . 150400_150401
I'm going to flip this one up . 150401_151750
maybe . 151750_153668
there I'm going to flip that one up and I'm going to flip this one
what +/. 156720_157200
same ! 157200_157680
same . 157680_159500
okay ? 159500_159950
Amanda ! 159950_161068
hold on I want to make sure their designs get back together Missus
okay . 166555_167755
do they look the same ? 167755_169623
yes . 169623_171113
+< are they starting the same way ? 171113_171356
all right I'm gonna flip this one up . 171356_174225
I'm gonna flip this one down . 174225_175945
same . 175945_177266
it's the same . 177266_177761
what did we find out ? 177761_179746
they're the same . 179746_180800
+< an up flip yeah . 180800_182500
+< that up and down is the same as a down flip . 182500_183500
+< so from now on if someone's going to if you want me to flip
we don't call it an up flip . 189515_191231
we don't call it a down flip . 191231_192916
we call it an up down flip because that shows people we're talking
so instead of calling it an up flip which might make someone who
is there any other kind of flips or just up down flip ? 211480_215550
there's others . 215550_217005
others . 217005_217550
sideways . 217550_218036
sideways flip . 218036_218568
no that was from your xxx I did an up down flip . 218568_225423
you have to look at where I was sitting . 225423_227125
+< diagonal flip diagonal flip . 227125_228028
a diagonal flip ? 228028_229415
that was mine . 229415_230676
like this ? 230676_231413
yeah . 231413_234700
or like this ? 234700_235613
yeah . 235613_236556
the same . 236556_237423
okay . 237423_238426
up down diagonal flip . 238426_239425
well not up down diagonal flip but I don't know . 239195_244048
+< or you could do it sideways . 244048_244580
a sideways flip ? 244580_245946
well you know what before when Brian was giving me directions he
and Dani gave me a command to flip it left when she wanted me to
now remember I'm putting these two in front of me so if you said
okay . 270465_272098
and the &~ri the way see how when I hold my hands like this what
l@l . 277000_277436
&~th yeah my left makes an l@l does this one make an l@l . 277436_280420
no . 280420_281113
no (be)cause that's my that's my right hand . 281113_283063
okay . 283063_284046
hmm . 284046_285681
do you think a left &~ri a left flip and a right flip are the same ?
no . 290786_291871
or do you think they're different ? 291871_292675
I think they're +/. 292675_293538
the same . 293538_294323
I think they're the same . 294323_295408
same . 295408_296273
what makes you think maybe they'd be the same Kevin ? 296273_297811
<well maybe um xxx they look like the same here like xxx like maybe
so do you think if right now do these two core squares look
yes . 321375_321910
okay I just took one and I copied it I put it in the same position .
what if I flipped this one left and this one right ? 324626_327580
do you think they'll look the same when I'm done or different when
different . 331565_332048
same . 332048_332550
different . 332550_333583
xxx . 333583_334451
(be)cause you won't see it like that if um that was like the upside
okay but but just looking at you're not going to move right so
yeah if you sat there for one flip and then ran over there and
you have to look at them from the same um position . 356583_359140
well let's try I'm going to flip this one to the left . 359140_361740
okay . 361740_365076
now I'm going to flip this one to the right . 365076_367508
they're the same . 367508_371400
hmm let's try that with theirs . 371400_374615
maybe that was just their weird core square . 374615_377681
okay are do those look the same to you ? 377681_380283
yes . 380283_381668
okay I'm gonna flip this one left I'm gonna flip this one right . 381668_387423
they're the same . 387423_391548
okay and these two are already in position do those match ? 391548_399898
yes . 399898_401205
xxx Paul can you see those two there ? 401205_403551
okay I'm going to flip one left and the other one right . 403551_406820
do you think they'll look the same or different when we're done ? 406820_408906
same . 408906_409353
why do you think they're going to look the same ? 409353_411556
because the other two did . 411556_412940
because the other two did . 412940_414391
+< well if something happens two times will it happen every time ? 414391_417526
no . 417526_418165
+< yes . 418165_418711
no . 418711_419828
nuhuh . 419828_420896
no they'd be different different . 420896_422163
+< let's see . 422163_422205
left . 422205_423020
nope . 423020_424383
right . 424383_424756
+< right . 424756_425045
same . 425045_426750
okay we've got one more test here . 426750_428803
I'm gonna flip it left . 428803_431341
I'm gonna flip it right . 431341_433823
same . 433823_435200
well maybe it's because I always did this one left and this one
what if I do this one left and this one right ? 437450_439876
same . 439876_441400
let's try I'm gonna flip this one to the right and I'm
same . 446498_448200
so what did we find out about left flips and right flips ? 448200_450968
they're the same . 450968_452618
so what's a good word for that ? 452618_454300
left flip right flip . 454300_455220
left right flip . 455220_456773
how about another word that I used &~s I heard somebody use already ?
sideways flips . 460558_460825
sideways because left or right either way . 460825_463060
do you know why um and that's not because there's anything
it's because um when we work on the computers later and use them to
we can have it happen very quickly . 485191_486878
all the shapes will match perfectly . 486878_489046
they'll all line up . 489046_489863
but you need to know what you're doing before we do that . 489863_494200
so you're not just guessing you really know what you're doing and
they have you pick up down flip or sideways flip . 506256_510276
so from now on so that we're all calling it the same thing we're
because we've proven that flipping it up and flipping it down is
+< they're the same . 523220_523538
and no matter which side you go to left or right we're going to
okay so we know about two kinds of flips up down flips and sideways
Alex what are you thinking about that . 537965_540598
um well there's another way that you can make them be the same or
+< um tell me more about your idea . 551608_552006
turning yeah . 552006_553500
Alex is saying there's another way we didn't talk about yet and
now we did talk about that um in some ways with their samples . 556600_561148
is turning the same as flipping ? 561148_563383
no . 563383_565900
well what makes a turn different from a flip ? 565900_568033
