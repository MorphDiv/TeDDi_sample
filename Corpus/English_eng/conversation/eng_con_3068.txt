to be symmetrical and it'll have tons of colors . 0_2850
every pretend there's little squares and every little square
so it would be possible to make a symmetrical quilt that used many
one that has two colors ! 28050_28800
++ one several of you talked to me about a symmetrical quilt that
+< you could just fold it in +... 33905_34928
okay Teddy tune in we're up here Alex also we're all up here your
um so far we have patterns designs we've talked about symmetry or
what else might you wanna think about or plan for if
Alex what would you need to think about ? 73770_75921
well I would need to think about different types of colors . 75921_86696
tell me more about that . 86696_89195
well +/. 89195_90680
how would thinking about color help make your quilt better ? 90680_93105
if it was just like hmm total splash of like gray orange and yellow
okay so sometimes the way the colors in the quilt are arranged help
good thinking thank you for putting your idea into words Alex . 132693_136116
okay what we're going to be doing today is trying to not only use
we're gonna begin our final quilt project working on
well they're gonna be quilts based on two by two
we've made two by two designs before . 161118_163670
are those like strips or two by two designs those ones hanging
some are in strips and some are in two by twos . 168756_171071
I think one like one of those are in strips one of the um pieces
these are strip quilts and these are strip quilts and these are two
um we've made two by twos before correct ? 187058_191783
yes . 191783_192700
+< when did we make two by two designs ? 192700_194051
when we were working on our um book quilt family book . 194051_196213
our quilt family book . 196213_198636
+< xxx . 198716_198717
+< our quilt family booklets . 198717_199876
okay so we've done a lot with two by two designs but have we ever
no . 205345_206250
nope only except on the bulletin board we at the very beginning of
um so you're like okay well if we're gonna learn new
what could we do to make um better two by two designs ? 227000_234096
Kelly Jillian and Ashley knock it off . 234096_238950
you ladies will have no idea what to do (be)cause you're paying
Kelly I need you to move away from Jillian thank you . 247705_250723
okay um what can we do differently about two by two designs this
I want these to be um the best two by two designs we've created
wonderful way to end the quilting unit (be)cause it'll put to use
what can we try that's new or different with these two by two
Brittany what's your suggestion . 299003_299923
um by trying not to make (th)em the same as other people's . 299923_304356
okay that's always important trying to design a two by two design
and if our quilts are gonna begin with two by two
Kelly what could we do ? 325638_327028
don't look at other people's so that you design your own that looks
okay don't worry about what other people are doing just worry about
+^ what can we do to make sure it looks cool when we're done ? 337346_340650
you can use like three colors or two colors any color you want and
+< Sarah +... 352735_353268
like colors instead of a design . 353268_357018
colors instead of a design you mean I have to choose between
if you do color it won't look that good but if you do design then
how are colors different from the design . 367813_372973
you mean I have to pick whether I'm gonna do colors or
are all the strip quilts we did did we use colors ? 376291_381261
yes . 381261_382881
did they have designs ? 382881_383698
yeah . 383698_385081
so I don't get it I think they have to have colors and designs . 385081_389965
with a strip quilt you need at least two colors . 389965_392578

two ! 400166_400576
three ! 400576_401015
three ! 401015_401731
two ! 401731_402241

(be)cause if you look at the color wheel three don't there's
okay the &~la the strip quilts that we made were based on um color
and Brittany was reminding you that if she looked straight across
+^ she said if you look straight across the color wheel from red
blue . 446711_449040
+< blue . 449040_449041
and two groups did choose to make their quilts based on orange and
yellow orange and +... 452058_453570
+< um remember when we talked about the color wheel the first time
one way to use the color wheel to select colors that look good
Alex do you already have ideas about what that might be ? 472956_475358
