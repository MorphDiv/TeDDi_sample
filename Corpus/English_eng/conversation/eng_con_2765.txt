<mister> Justice , if we could go back to the beginning of
you are now the senior associate justice which meant that you are
how did you feel about that ?
how did you choose to exercise that power ?
well , of course , this is a very significant power that I think
the chief justice , as you intimated , when he's in the majority
this means that the Chief Justice normally can keep those cases
after all , some justices write broadly , others write narrowly ,
I've always felt this is , as I've indicated , a significant power
it isn't set forth by statute or rule anywhere .
it has a couple of consequences naturally , and that is , when one
when I first came on , it seemed to me , I got more than my share
well , how did I exercise it ?
I think during this last term I had my share of cases to assign ,
I tried to get that assignment out promptly because it would affect
I like to think that I did it fairly .
once in a while I kept a case or two for myself , but I never
did any other justice ever approach you for an assignment ?
there were two instances where that happened , but I , usually
I personally never have asked for an assignment , for a case to be
I thought this was the prerogative of the assigner justice ,
and I also learned that in the long run things balance out .
you get “good” cases , and you get “bad” cases .
every now and then a justice is so wrapped up in a case that he
maybe you give it to him ; maybe he's , over-anxious , and you
many times it's his clerks that are putting the pressure on .
they want the case to work on .
I don't believe that any inquiry that I made of another justice as
they're always glad to take it on , and like a good soldier they'll
when you watched Justice Brennan exercise the assignment power when
he did it a little differently .
he didn't do it by telephone the way I did .
he always wrote a note and would say , +"/.
+" dear Harry , you and Joe and Pete and somebody else and I are in
+" he'd do it by writing , with copies to the others .
+" I don't know whether he was ever rebuffed or not .
+" I doubt it .
+" one didn't refuse to go along with Bill Brennan .
+" he was always a gentleman and fair and nice in his assignments .
+" but I didn't purposefully emulate him , I just did it in my own
when did you start getting assignments ?
do you remember what term ?
well , probably right in the October session , and it carried
it might be just one case , or it might be two that I had to assign
although there were a couple of instances , I think in maybe in
how did he react to that ?
oh well , we laughed about it .
at one point he said , you have more cases to assign than I do ,
well , we laughed about it .
early in the term you had the Nightline interviews with Nina
what do you remember about that experience ?
well , Nina Totenberg goes far back in my relationship with this
when I was nominated in <nineteen seventy> , I was sitting
we had a session on .
the news came through , and Martin Van Oosterhout , who was the
+" harry , you better go home and not carry on with the rest of
he said , +"/.
+" I'll get somebody else to sit in your place .
well , I was gratified by that , and so my secretary and my law
well , I didn't know Nina Totenberg particularly .
but she'd been there and apparently had interviewed Dottie she
but I think this is true of so many media persons ; when they start
but she was around in Rochester when we had some initial interviews
on the other hand , I ran into some difficulties .
I discovered that her father is a rather renowned violin teacher
she'd taken lessons from him .
well , as the years went by , Nina , of course , made a name for
I do trust her completely .
I think she's been very fair .
what I don't remember is why I consented to her request for an
maybe I thought I owed her something .
but I said yes , I would give an interview .
and lo and behold when the time came not only was she there but Ted
and what had happened was apparently he had employed her to be part
she had this appointment with me , so to speak , so he showed up .
but they were both very kind in that interview , I thought ,
he , I believe , took over , so to speak , the front seat of that
I think the interview was a success .
now it was in that interview that you in some ways gave a hint of
I guess I did .
because they must have asked me about the death penalty and capital
can you take us through your thinking about the death penalty and
well , the death penalty has always concerned me .
I have writings when I was on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
there's one case , I think it's called Feguer against the United
but I expressed in that opinion , which I wrote it's fairly
but that it was on the books and as judges we had to enforce it ,
so that when <nineteen seventy> came along , I was on
it wasn't anything that was unusual .
I remember in one of the interviews , when my nomination was
chief Justice Burger wrote me a note or called me or something ,
he said don't comment on issues if you don't have to .
I reminded him I was already on record in the Feguer case and was
but the thing has always bothered me through the years , and I
and finally that culminated in my dissent on the Callins case this
remainder of the term .
when Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall would regularly dissent ,
no , I never really did because they took the route via the Eighth
they felt the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment under
I didn't subscribe to that .
it seemed to me that the Constitution as originally written and
there are phrases in the original Constitution I think it's Article
so that I would have had trouble saying that it was violative of
now there's a large body of judicial thinking that is not in line
so I did not join them .
but in the Callins case , I reached officially the same conclusion
more equal protection than due process .
now in the opinion you emphasize the racial discrimination in the
I wonder how that theme started to come into your thinking .
well , I think the statistics concerning capital punishment show it
there were two strains of legal thought developed .
one is that like cases should be treated alike ; all capital
and the other strain is that every death penalty case should be
and as I went through , well over most of my first twenty years
but then I became more and more convinced as I went through , and
it seemed to me that it was impossible to administer the death
I felt the way the court treated them was demonstrative of that
and I reached the point where I thought I couldn't go along with it
now this is different from the Brennan-Marshall approach on the
but I'm persuaded in my own thinking that it's right for me anyway
now you speak about McCleskey and the Baldus study .
the recent biography of Justice Powell , by John Jeffries , makes
did you have any inkling of that at the time ?
well , I thought at the time that Lewis Powell was a little
one curious thing about my dissent in the Callins case I think is
but I wanted to get it off my chest .
but to my great surprise really and some satisfaction , at least it
I don't know what the ultimate result will be , but I personally
now when I say that I realize I'm swimming upstream because almost
some gruesome killing comes along , and the .
popular reaction is he should have the death penalty .
that's natural , I understand it .
but I'm just convinced that we cannot administer it equally and
can I ask you about your personal feelings over the years ?
from <nineteen seventy-two> until probably about ten years
they would go back down to habeas and have another run at it .
but by <nineteen eighty-two> , a lot of the stays that
how did that make you feel ?
well , of course it brings the finality of death into our
those cases always come to the court .
maybe I shouldn't say always , once in a while there is an instance
+" don't do anything more for me .
+" I'm ready to be executed .
+" let's get it over with .
but nearly all of them come , and they nearly always hit us in the
so they hit our court in the middle of the night , and we get these
so that I for me at least I can't speak for the other
I don't know why executions are scheduled for the wee hours , maybe
but I've said before I think every execution lessens us all .
we ought to have a better way of solving these things than the
and as circuit justice , you would get cases from Arkansas and
how would you respond when these states would come to you first ?
well , Arkansas , Missouri , Nebraska were the ones that produced
there were certain cases where I would stay the execution if I was
but in nearly all the cases I did as the other justices did .
we refer the application to the conference , , that is , to the
usually the circuit justice would write a note setting forth the
then the whole court would take it up , usually with correspondence
so in a way maybe one could say that's a cop-out , you're avoiding
and of course if I were to act in a way that another justice
and these late night calls , would you ever have conference calls ?
yes , once in a while .
and would there be much discussion ?
oh , not a great deal .
if the recommendation letter by the circuit justice was well
but now and then , is this enough like a case that's under
and then it was a matter really of whether we held this case for
yes , but it was always a capital punishment case that hit us in
and during the years Brennan and Marshall were dissenting in every
well , they would always , if it came up in their circuits , they'd
knowing as I often knew , when I referred it to the full court ,
did any of them ever lobby you about this particular issue ?
+, no .
I don't think so .
when you were planning the Callins opinion , how did the choice of
well , that's a fair enough question .
I'm not entirely sure I know the positive answer to it except that
now that's a bad word to use because no murder is routine .
but I didn't want it colored by racial overtones or other factors
it was kind of a routine murder without some of the nasty facts
I wanted a good , clean issue , and Callins seemed to prescribe the
and had you prepared the opinion in advance of Callins or could you
probably so , if I'd found an acceptable case .
it was fulminating in my mind , so to speak , and I got a draft or
but Collins came along and I advised the court that I would be
I advised them slightly in advance , not too far .
did you circulate your opinions to them in advance ?
sure .
were any justices surprised ?
no , because I told them it was coming .
they accepted it .
and what role did the availability of federal habeas play over time
another theme of the opinion is that federal habeas was being
well , of course , there's a fair body of academic thinking , I
everyone will have his own opinion about that .
I think the Callins case maybe has served to stop that trend a
and that's why discussion about the issue is good .
whatever the ultimate decision is , why I think the more we talk
do you think that the other justices will continue to talk about
oh , it's there .
it's on the books , and my guess is that they'll let it stand , and
that's my guess , I don't know .
I hope the opposite is true , but you never know .
did you get mail from death row inmates ?
yes , not much , but I did get a letter from counsel for <Mister>
when it came in I thought , oh , what will this all be about ?
but it was a very nice letter .
it was two or three pages , hand-written , legible , in effect
but not in any way claiming innocence of the crime he had committed
he took an approach that in the intervening , I think it was twelve
that he felt he was a different person now than he was twelve years
it was a nice letter , really , rather a touching letter , I really
not a word of that , I responded , as I recall , through counsel .
just acknowledged receipt of it and then the niceness of it and so
and I have heard , I think in that letter from counsel that his
on what ground I do not know .
but as of that time , and this must be a month to six weeks ago ,
have you had much direct contact from litigants in the form of mail
well , not much .
there is some .
but not much really , surprisingly .
you get a lot of mail from everybody else but not so much from the
I understand that Norma McCorvey , Jane Roe , has expressed a
is that true ?
well , I'm told secondhandedly that this is the case .
I've forgotten who told me , yes .
now your last day on the Court , in August , there was yet another
there were three .
in my experience that's the first time I've known of three
and they were set for , whatever it was , in the afternoon I think
I knew they were coming .
we get advance information about executions that are coming up .
they're listed , the state , and the name and what the execution
and so before the third of August when I was still active , Justice
and so I covered those three cases , apologizing at the same time
and then lo and behold Chief Judge then Chief Judge Breyer
where the chief justice has his summer hideaway and be sworn in by
I learned that he was sworn in about <three forty> that
my letter to the president had indicated that my retirement would
so it hit right into the time of those executions , and the order
the Court , of course , denied it , denied all three , relief in
which meant that it was after he had taken his oath .
and , of course , it then did not mention my vote to grant because
so it was a curious timing consequence actually .
but they were all executed .
the State of Arkansas .
over the time you were on the Court , how did the Court's
what was the process of dealing with stay applications and the like
at the beginning , there must not have been fax machines or other
well , it moves along .
if we deny the final motion , why , word goes down by , I presume ,
and then usually the executing authorities go to work .
they seem to be ready all the time , ready to move almost
so that those stay orders on occasion , if they're to be issued ,
so far as I know , no one has been executed prior to the issuance
I don't think there's been any error in that respect .
do you ever recall a time when you , as circuit justice , granted a
I don't recall one , Professor Koh , offhand , but I don't want to
it wouldn't surprise me , but I don't recall one .
one can sense that if his reaction is going to be different from
you can protect yourself in that way .
what do you think is going to be the future of the death penalty in
well , it seems to be the popular thing to do these days .
I've read reports of death penalty legislation being introduced in
that's the current trend , that's the popular trend .
but I think in the long run the death penalty will be proscribed ,
I think our society will mature to that point .
but fight now , if one is taking that position , he's swimming
the popular opinion distinctly is the other way .
and , of course , this affects the political posture of candidates
do you see on the current court any possibility of a change among
on the current court ?
no .
it wouldn't surprise me if maybe Justice Stevens would waver
but I'm not expecting that actually .
he's been too consistently the other way despite his concerns .
but I don't see any great hope of that kind of result being
certainly by a majority of the present court .
did any of them say anything to you about the Callins case ?
yes .
well , there were telephone calls that came in from one of them
I won't identify that person but , because that person's vote was
but I think hat person was rather gratified that I had said what I
sometimes one gets announced antagonism to a writing of that kind .
I experienced nothing of that kind .
the calls that came in were distinctly favorable , good for you
over the years , has this issue been one on which , when there has
on the death penalty ?
yes .
no , there hasn't been angry discussion on that issue at all .
there has been angry discussion on other issues but not on that one
when you think back to the Eighth Circuit days , do you think you
well , back then I and I think all of my colleagues on the
I think that was the general thinking .
I don't know whether it's right .
I think sometimes it's good for a lower court to say all the
there are two attitudes one could take about that kind of thing ,
I guess the death penalty has been lumped together with several
how did you feel about changing your mind or changing your position
I'm thinking particularly about the Tenth Amendment area , National
well , I feel , Professor Koh , that I haven't changed my mind very
people do point to Garcia , National League of Cities as a change
I don't believe I changed my mind , at least I'll say that at this
I think the case and its posture were different the second
+, well , in both the Tenth Amendment area and the death penalty ,
did you have that sense as you were watching the cases come in
are we speaking of the death penalty now ?
<h_k> : Yes , the death penalty in particular .
oh , I don't think I can give you a positive answer to that one .
one's hopes are always dashed , but I've learned over the years
it's good to stir up discussion .
sure .
the Callins opinion came in the form of a dissent from denial of
do you remember how that started to come to be ?
well , I might question your statement about being quite regular
they're more frequent than they were twenty-five years ago
I hope I am correct in making this statement .
justice Stevens , for instance , may be against the denial of cert
whereas some of the rest of us have .
I think he just feels that's Court action , and why should I
would you have preferred to have Callins be the dissent to an
+, no , I think it's in pretty good shape the way it is .
easier this way in a sense .
because I can just pick on the issue sort of in a bare and naked
so you never thought of yourself as trying to gather votes for the
no .
I knew nobody else would go along with it .
as I've indicated I've been really surprised that it's stirred up
if you don't mind I'd like to ask about some of the other cases
what are your recollections about that case ?
well , that case came along in due course .
on the books was Batson against Kentucky of a few years ago .
the court had the issue in the form of race and held on bare and
this touches a tender spot for trial lawyers particularly .
they like peremptory challenges , and they don't want .
to lose them , and I can understand that feeling .
but Batson went on I think there were a couple of dissents in
there wasn't a great deal of discussion about it in conference .
the vote as I recall was <six three> , not <five four>
I know there was a concurrence by Justice O'Connor to the effect
I'm as convinced as I can be that this is as far as the Court will
I don't believe they would do the same thing on a religious basis ,
I think that <J_E_B> is the end of the line so far as
one can argue that if the court were to do otherwise that
personally I think they serve a purpose , and while I'm not a trial
and I have made mistakes in doing so , exercised them for the wrong
did you do a lot of trials in which you did a lot of jury picking
I didn't do a lot , but I did a fair number .
peremptories were something I was always glad I had .
I remember one case where we won the case in the jury finally , but
the judge asked me afterwards , +"/.
+" why didn't you strike witness number five ?
or something like that .
it turned out that witness number five was the one that held out
his judgment was better than mine , he saw through her better than
but I was glad to have those peremptories .
I think they're part of the tradition .
I for one wouldn't like to see them done away with , but maybe the
certainly <J_E_B> carried it along to a point , but I
some commentators have seen <J_E_B> as proof of a
there's a footnote in your opinion discussing the possibility of
do you see a split between , the two of them emerging ?
I guess I'll give you a negative answer to that .
but I'm not too sure about that answer .
they do differ on occasion , and it's rather interesting to watch
but it's no different really from Justice A differing from Justice
did you ever consider assigning <J_E_B> to Justice
the answer is no .
there's nothing of adverse implication in that .
I think that I was pleased with the tentative vote , and it may
another case of this term which people felt may have gut you in an
including Madsen , the final case of the term , yes .
right .
how did you feel about those cases ?
I get kind of tired of all these protests and counter-protests and
I don't know what people accomplish by picketing .
they certainly haven't affected my vote even though I've been
but people get it off their chests .
and of course on the abortion issue there are extremists on both
but people feel strongly about it and seem to justify it in their
whether Madsen was decided correctly or not , it was a little
we had the thirty foot buffer zone and the hundred foot buffer zone
those are factors I can't judge , and the Court rather compromised
but I was wondering what the chief would do .
he kept the opinion to himself on the Madsen case .
I was interested in how it would come out , how he would handle it
I think our time is just about up .
we'll start again with a discussion of your early life next sessio
