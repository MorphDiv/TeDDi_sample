xxx put that in . 0_1335
it doesn't ? 1335_2085
+< and then put that one in . 2085_2935
yep and then +/. 2935_4500
+< green red green red green red green red green red green . 4500_6898
+< yep and that's why you guys have been using flips and turns when
+^ Kelly what were you going to say ? 11710_12623
um with the checker board +. 12623_14141
mhmm . 14141_14906
++ that you flipped upwards and when you turned it and the red was
+< mhmm uh huh . 20630_22261
when you flip it it goes back to the same position that was
excellent thinking . 29768_30843
guys and ladies I need you to um +... 30843_34211
get our snacks ? 34211_35183
no no wouldn't that be nice ? 35183_37781
I need you to make a group right here where you can see the board
you did a great job but now you need to make use of all of those
have a seat Nicole . 58855_60086
this is the directions part of your time today so it wouldn't be a
let's see we're gonna use one of um my two by two
when you're doing this though whose two by two designs do you think
yours ours . 79811_80511
yep your own . 80511_81731
okay what you are gonna need to do on the back of each
(be)cause that's what you guys were doing you were taking your core
sometimes you weren't thinking while you were working you were so
so I'm gonna draw a larger one here . 144871_148738
let's use mine as an example and write down what I really did . 148738_154678
this is my beginning core square . 154678_157183
alright and I knew that because of my x@l in the upper left hand
+^ that's my core square this is my finished two by two design . 165406_169985
in this first part of the two by two design here so I'm starting
um . 183563_186735
who can can who can give me the moves that I had to use maybe
kinda hafta visualize . 195738_197706
+< oh oh oh ! 197706_197993
Justin what do you think ? 197993_199030
diagonal flip . 199030_199893
a diagonal flip . 199893_202328
I think Justin's right . 202328_204280
um who can find who can who can find +/. 204280_208458
+< you may not have done that move xxx . 208458_208665
I might have done another move right uh Justin let's see . 208665_212155
oh you know what . 212155_213338
that's not the right way . 213338_215568
yep you know what watch that again because diagonally it would get
just one second here I need to put this xxx . 224175_229078
okay watch the diagonal flip again . 229078_231636
from uh the yellow square is in the top left and then I'm gonna
aw that doesn't put the green triangle where I need it does it ? 238435_242038
but good using um that term . 242038_244590
let's look at that again and take another idea about how I might
Ashley what do you think ? 247828_249138
turn it one fourth . 249138_250505
uh . 250505_251756
what side . 251756_252180
left or right . 252180_252846
right . 252846_257966
okay one fourth to the right . 257966_259935
can't see . 259935_261618
okay watch I'm gonna slide it over here watch the
+< wait two fourths . 266995_268491
you have to be able to see the core square . 268491_269515
zip it . 269515_270708
and Sarah I think if you sit right there with space between you and
Dani can you see the core square when my body is between you and
I hope so . 280096_281648
okay quarter turn to the right is Ashley's suggestion . 281648_285828
hmm does that get me what I want ? 285828_288586
+< she changed her mind to two fourths . 288586_289301
+< now do a diagonal flip . 289301_290113
+< shh . 290113_290896
Ashley um . 290896_292381
um . 292381_294400
quarter turn +... 294400_295335
+< go two fourths . 295335_296068
two fourths so another fourth to the right . 296068_297958
there now she got it . 297958_299905
yep . 299905_300636
so if I went a fourth to the right and then another fourth to the
+< a half a half . 303646_304203
a half very good . 304203_306098
so turn right one half . 306098_314805
that was the move I had to do to my core square to get it to look
Justin have you thought of a different move I might've +... 319025_321283
+< I thought of another way only use diagonal flip diagonal flip up
okay um show me that again . 325896_332828
this way and like this way . 332828_340900
okay um watch that again I think I can do that now and show them . 340900_345266
he's doing a &~diag watch the red triangle is gonna
yep did it . 359931_361211
he did it . 361211_362105
he did . 362105_363188
xxx two two up down flips . 363188_365180
wait he didn't do two up down flips . 365180_367746
+< he did two diagonal diangonal flips . 367746_369975
the only thing is how do you describe that to someone (be)cause you
if I just say diagonal flip diagonal flip +/. 376931_379875
um . 379875_380510
shh . 380510_381995
if I say two diagonal flips would anyone be able to read that huh
two diagonal +... 390081_390683
one diagonal flip going up um across . 390683_396221
+< from side to side . 396221_397273
and then one diagonal flip . 397273_399066
+< all diagonal flips go from one side to the other Brittany . 399066_401035
and then the other one going from +... 401035_404126
that's hard isn't it ? 404126_408790
can you do that again ? 408790_410773
yep watch what he did watch again and look and see if we can put
we saw him do it and we know it works but what we have to do is how
okay this is what he did . 425553_427375
across and then across again . 427375_433125
well is there any kind of diagonal flip that doesn't go across ? 433125_437366
+< oh oh um down up down . 437366_439180
he didn't do up down flips . 439180_440748
I mean diagonally up down flips . 440748_443616
I know I know ! 443616_445375
Sarah what are you thinking ? 445375_446893
um first a diagonal flip to the um right and then a diagonal flip
okay just a second I'm gonna put this back up to the
first a diagonal flip to the right and then a diagonal flip to the
watch that was a diagonal flip to the right and now I'm doing a
so the um diagonal flip didn't work . 474653_476810
+< did I get what I wanted ? 476810_477540
I got what I wanted did I do what Justin did ? 477540_478850
+< no . 478850_479600
no . 479600_480165
that got the result but that wasn't what Justin did . 480165_485365
who can think of another way to talk about those diagonal flips
Nicole what are you thinking ? 498758_500100
um . 500100_500678
do you wanna +/. 500678_509133
+< right bottom corner +. 509133_510790
mhmm . 510790_511801
++ flip it to the left top corner . 511801_519891
okay just a second . 519891_521291
I don't think there's enough room to write all that stuff . 521291_524918
I'm writing it down here . 524918_526005
right bottom corner flip it to the top left corner . 526005_539100
is that what you said Nicole ? 539100_540381
yeah that is a lot of writing isn't it . 540381_544316
right bottom corner flip it to the top left corner . 544316_548193
so I'm taking the right bottom corner and I'm gonna
it did it ! 554231_555765
okay that did it but now the next step Nicole how do keep it going .
+< take +/. 559695_560078
oh my gosh I filled my hold on I filled my square I was thinkin
