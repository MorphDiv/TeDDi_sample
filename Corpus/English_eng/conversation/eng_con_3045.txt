oh +... 211700_212980
+< take here and that and then take this whole bottom part off . 212480_215433
and then that'd be the beginning of a arrow . 215433_218185
+< what is that ? 217185_218518
something . 218518_219114
&+someth it's a speaker . 219114_221041
is that a microphone or something ? 219914_221386
+< it's a microphone . 220486_221805
it's a speaker . 221805_222872
what is that ? 223872_224519
<and what do you> what are you going to do with these &-uh core
+< make a strip quilt . 227543_229407
&-uh how are you going to make a strip out_of them ? 229407_231569
I don't know . 231569_232146
you need to go and get a whole new sheet . 232146_233958
+< yeah ‡ you do . 232746_233552
ask them . 233758_234871
I think you should be with xxx . 234871_236654
+< no ‡ we're interested in what you think . 234871_237419
I think you know it very well . 237419_239184
we'll work this out . 239184_241416
I am . 241416_242188
I haven't been here very long . 242188_244864
what do you mean ? 244864_245699
here in the class ? 245699_247064
www . 247064_260591
wait wait wait say it now . 260091_262360
it matters what ? 262360_263505
it matters what way the lines are because if if I had that line
why not ? 272729_273568
because the orange like up here like if you turned it that way
+< uhhuh . 279068_279877
so ‡ we if we did it that way it wouldn't work . 289411_296149
and that way it would be like that . 296149_299512
why would that cause problems ? 299512_303596
I dunno . 303596_305058
because it wouldn't get it right on the paper . 305058_311093
and why do you want it to get it right on the paper ? 311093_313764
well ‡ (be)cause if you didn't get it right all like one or two
uhhuh . 318317_319200
and then let's say I was gonna copy this one . 319200_323963
xxx and I messed up on that line . 323963_326957
+< right . 323963_324515
uhhuh . 326957_327546
+< so then <I would be> I would make be making different
+< yeah . 336366_336926
+< if they got it right from copying that and I got it wrong <from
+< yeah . 340161_341001
and why would that matter if yours wasn't exactly like theirs ? 342537_347168
well ‡ because we didn't &-um get it write then . 347168_352633
it wouldn't be the same core square . 352633_354600
yeah ‡ it wouldn't be the same core square . 354600_357189
and it look different than its supposed to . 357189_360552
I see . 360552_361179
it would look different than it was supposed to ? 361179_363207
yeah . 363207_364056
+< plus we're only supposed to use two colors for some reason . 363756_366257
0 . 366257_369410
would the strip be different xxx ? 369410_372164
the strip ? 372164_373117
uhhuh . 373117_373903
I don't know . 373903_375683
if we used all different colors the strip would be all different
and it wouldn't match . 381729_383554
but what if Firstname didn't do do his core square right ? 383554_388519
would this xxx the strip ? 388519_391145
+< it'd be different . 389519_391845
(be)cause see Firstname was explaining . 391845_393521
<he's using> &-uh he's using the same colors . 393521_397065
he was explaining about the lines . 397065_399127
that if the lines were different that would cause a problem . 399127_404504
how could that be ? 404504_406751
+< let me see . 406051_411026
you had a good idea here . 411026_415112
yeah ‡ but I think that that is a very good idea xxx . 415112_419517
why did you mess up ? 419517_420929
+< oh . 420929_422033
yeah . 422033_422991
oh_no &=laughs . 422991_424655
but <I can> I can color the green dark on this . 424655_432239
+< so like that . 424655_427392
see ‡ like he just messed up . 432239_434170
he almost messed up xxx . 434170_436368
+< see ‡ but I'm going +... 435605_438400
+< I guess you can get another piece of paper out and make another
+< but I'm gonna darker the green on this darker . 441304_446576
+< so ‡ you're gonna fix it ? 445456_448276
well ‡ this is the core square <that we> &+d that we designed
looks kind_of weird . 456415_459223
why do you say that ? 459223_461353
because we +... 461353_466305
&-um it's kind_of weird because here we were gonna make this green .
but then we said +"/. 471150_471855
+" n:ah . 471855_475559
I think it's weird because +... 475559_481063
diz@u because most people use this color . 481063_488482
everybody use this color . 488482_490327
these two xxx two colors ? 490327_493619
&=nods . 493619_494988
so ‡ you wanted to make a different design ? 494088_496847
yeah ‡ but then we said +"/. 496847_498868
+" nah ‡ we'll just keep it . 498868_500000
because we already had it glued down . 500000_502961

like &-um put like this like +/. 513811_517384
what was my plan to put it ? 517384_519624
I was thinking of putting this green over here and this red over
and then put this over here so it could be like flipped over . 524195_527881
and then I could put this over here and this one over here . 527881_531351
so it's like xxx different orders . 531351_534823
it's like what ? 534823_535575
I didn't hear that . 535575_536588
