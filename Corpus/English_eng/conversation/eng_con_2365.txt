and then &-like if we left him out and went out_of town he took
no kidding . 360589_360959

mhm was he a big dog ? 411480_413120
yeah ‡ he was very large . 413596_414626
I don't care too much for a small dog . 415291_416541
mhm . 417088_417208
I like a larger dog for this reason . 417230_418620
if they don't bite, well they could scare devil out_of somebody
give them the impression that they will bite „ you_know . 422134_424164
that's a_lot_of protection . 424183_424763
mhm . 425426_425566
but a smaller dog, they so small, just can't have no fun with
yeah I think I agree with you . 429093_431353
you_know (be)cause if you start wrestling with them you might hurt
right . 434002_434232

I didn't even you_know go to parties or nothing like that . 459329_460879
hm how'd you go about training him ? 462241_463601
well ‡ I started out when he was a puppy you_know housebreaking him
and then after that you_know I start turning around the front door
and then watch very closely . 470997_472217
he put <his foot up on a paw> his paw up you_know and try to
and as he got larger he was able to reach it „ you_know . 476535_478135
when he was able to reach it, I stopped pushing it with the paw . 478450_480650
and every time he pushed the doorbell, we'll open the door on the
and so ‡ it got so he was in a habit „ you_know . 484419_486529
when he wanted to get in, he ring the doorbell . 486545_487835
we know to answer . 488257_489007
that's great . 489610_490250

he was easy to train but I tell you, &-like a a pedigree dog,
oh yeah ? 501110_501790
yeah ‡ they say they're easier but they're not . 501814_503384

then Keno kinda got a name for himself behind that „ you_know . 550403_552993

because at the time I was in high school, I liked forty dollar
and my father said that was too much to pay for shoes . 928699_930739
and so ‡ <I decided to do> I just decided to do one thing,

at least that way I was clean every day when I went to school and
yeah geez ‡ that kinda shot your day after school though . 942060_945510

&-um was there ever a teacher anywhere at any of the schools you

I had a government teacher . 958341_959541
she yelled a_lot at the kids . 960315_961745
but one thing I'm 'a say for her, she was a very good
oh yeah ? 964886_965086
(be)cause when you go out that classroom, whether you want to or
mhm . 969758_969998
one way or other „ you_know . 970013_970753
mhm . 971147_971277
but she was a very good teacher, she yelled a_lot . 971710_973720
and then when I was in elementary school, I had one teacher . 973735_975415
and she was hateful . 976486_977526
&=laughs that was in kindergarten though . 979736_981076

I will never forget her because she spank my hands a_couple_of
and then if you raise your hand to go to the bathroom she say no .

then send you home to your parents . 995349_996719
hm she sound like an old witch . 996890_998850
she really was &=laughs . 999183_999963
<you think> do you think it was fair what she punished the
no ‡ it wasn't . 1005795_1006385
no ‡ it wasn't . 1007286_1008036
she was just evil like that . 1008084_1009174
it was a very old lady „ you_know . 1009189_1010439
and what it is, now that I'm older, I think what it was was her
I don't think she had much patience with the kids at all . 1016801_1018851
used it up years ago . 1020272_1021492
oh ‡ years ago . 1021992_1022902
I thought she was the most hateful woman around . 1023053_1024863
if I had a brick she woulda got it &=laughs . 1025103_1027113
&=laughs I guess if I were to ask you if you ever had a teacher you
yeah ‡ she'd be the only one because all my other teachers, I got
I never had any trouble with my teachers . 1039849_1041180
<did you> were you ever in a class where the kids played a
yes I was, &=laughs several classes &=laughs . 1047380_1050110
well +/. 1052240_1052660
xxx ask this question . 1052968_1053648
well ‡ in one of the classes, well we had our thugs in the
and they was kinda smart but they were thugs . 1058560_1060140
and what they useta do sometime, they &-um I_mean the cushion
and we hadta stay after class for a whole week behind that
uhhuh . 1073344_1073604
and then another time was was someone brought some bees,
&=laughs and so ‡ the teachers got us about that . 1080197_1083427
mhm . 1083697_1084037
but other_than that, everything is pretty nice . 1084624_1086584
and then we had <a few teachers that> well one teacher that is
aw yeah ? 1093395_1094235
yes and that was one of my homeroom teachers Missus_Redacted_name
because during the time she was there, she did the things she hadta
and I think &-uh at our age that we realize that when we was bad
and the kids thought so much of her that &-um every time her
no kidding . 1119597_1120087
yeah ‡ and gifts . 1120108_1120568
and right to this day now I see a_lot_of kids who I know who went
they go back and see her now . 1125342_1126202
mm . 1126609_1126989
I even go back there every now and then and see her . 1127123_1128253
she the best teacher you ever had ? 1129989_1131409
&-um no ‡ she's really no contest really &=laughs . 1132080_1134630
another one of my teachers who I think very highly of was &-uh
she's also at Redacted_school junior high teacher . 1140738_1141918
and &-uh she was my english teacher . 1142648_1144168
mhm . 1144220_1144360
she taught me a awful lot . 1144937_1146227
I learned a_lot from her . 1146281_1146751
and then &-like if I did wrong on my paper or something like that,
+" try at first and don't succeed, try, try again . 1152565_1154445
which is something that I never forgot . 1154766_1155696
mhm . 1156209_1156459
and &-uh I did what she said . 1156481_1157971
mhm . 1158261_1158401
and seeing &-like I'm beginning to succeed now in life &=laughs
mhm . 1163984_1164164
and I really think highly of her for that . 1165117_1166507
mhm . 1166845_1167065
what is there that makes a teacher good ? 1167849_1169519
or another teacher might be poor ? 1170536_1172396
well ‡ one of things is the personality of the teacher . 1173210_1175430
the teacher getting with the students „ you_know . 1175810_1178040
getting interested in what some of the students are interested in
instead_of you walk in the classroom, like one of my teachers told
+" you I got my diploma, you hafta get yours . 1190000_1192200
+" the one who wrote the book got a a@l, the one who teach the book
&=laughs shoot . 1198762_1199292
I have had several teachers that tell me that . 1199639_1200879
and of one (th)em wasn't kidding . 1201286_1202346
the highest grade was in his classroom was a d@l plus . 1202630_1205390
aw . 1205817_1206117
I got a d@l minus and I was grateful for that „ you_know . 1206556_1209576
gee_whiz . 1209902_1210162
and so &-um I_mean ‡ the teachers, some of (th)em, I say this &-uh
they really feel like they doing the right thing „ you_know . 1217910_1220300
but some of (th)em really hafta be cruel towards some of the
and then again I'm not too sure about that &=laughs . 1226488_1228378
but xxx reason like I told you the two teachers who I was speaking
mhm . 1233343_1233513
okay ‡ they had the same type of students that some of the other
I_mean ‡ guys who was really bad, who wouldn't listen . 1236403_1238963
but yet still those guys respected them &*INV:mhm very highly and
and so ‡ I really think it &+r falls on their personality . 1247821_1250491
mhm . 1251143_1251263
and then the high interest in the student is in the work . 1251281_1253171
because some of the teachers can sit in there and preach the whole
next thing you know, everyone going to sleep „ you_know . 1259056_1260786
mhm . 1261626_1261766
and then if you say something to (th)em, well they feel like &-uh
because I felt that way myself you_know several times against some
and so I think one of the good qualities is their personality . 1271487_1274647
yeah . 1274834_1274974
that carry a long way . 1275513_1276563
and regardless of the race or how poor a child is or how the child
and they will learn something and try to do better . 1288593_1290283
well ‡ I'm sure that's true . 1292159_1293049
do you watch tv very much ? 1294354_1295314
I useta watch tv &-uh pretty often but here lately I don't even
since my wife you_know she works overtime at night and I have the
yeah . 1306969_1307169
and so ‡ you know how much &-uh time I have for tv now . 1307522_1309962
&=laughs I don't know now but I'm gonna find out . 1310161_1312351
my wife's expecting in the fall . 1313049_1316569
+< but the programs I do like to look at on tv comes on late at
mhm . 1320140_1320270
and like earlier programs I like to look at is &-like
and the reason why I do like to look at that and Mchales_Navy is
but later on in the evening it's like &-uh It_Takes_A_Thief . 1330882_1333272
I enjoy that very much . 1333884_1334944
now it's a new program just came on . 1335108_1336508
because &-uh actually if you really look at it, it gives you a
and then that way you know how to keep on the lookout &*INV:mhm for
and you it's hard to believe some of the things that &-uh the
is that an adventure story ? 1355209_1356379
yes it is but it's &-uh mostly it's a_lot_of fiction in it . 1357052_1360132
mhm . 1360663_1360963
because &-uh I feel it's fiction because &-um it's impossible for
do you remember a story on that show that you could tell me &-uh
you know one episode ? 1373064_1373944
that impressed me ? 1374376_1375156
yeah well ‡ that you remember . 1375449_1376539
ah let me see now . 1377232_1378142
oh ‡ I'm getting old and feeble-minded now „ you_know . 1379069_1382439
&=laughs very forgetful &=laughs . 1382461_1383561
well ‡ let's see, he was on &-uh monday night . 1385649_1387539
it was a program on +... 1388059_1389289
oh it was one program where he was sposta <have stolen> &+s
and the part that really impressed me was how he was able to &-um
hm . 1408805_1408995
you_know and then the other thing he had a briefcase on his arm
he was able to get the briefcase off the guy's arm with a key . 1413637_1416317
and the guy never knew the difference . 1417108_1418358
sheesh . 1418542_1418732
now all this happened in about fifteen seconds you_know on a
&=laughs and so I_mean you_know ‡ I really feel that it's
yeah . 1428768_1428938
because I know for myself if someone touched my &-uh wrist you_know
and so ‡ that's what I think &+r really amazes me you_know and
yeah . 1443980_1444190
(be)cause really nowadays you can't say nothing that's impossible
then one of the other programs that I like to watch is Bonanza
and &-um I forgot some of the other programs . 1455800_1459750
really to tell the truth if someone walk up to me now and say +"/.
+" &-uh what day and what channel do so-and-so <pro come on>
it could be something I watch . 1467034_1467584
I really couldn't tell (th)em . 1468087_1469027
because what it is, I just catch (th)em you_know as they come on
and then I_Spy, I like that very much . 1474420_1476370
mm okay . 1477969_1478959
no_thanks . 1480251_1480621
can you remember a episode of I_Spy ? 1481635_1485685
oh yeah . 1486248_1486688
see ‡ what we're trying to get is a storyline that interests
yeah ‡ this is one thing that interested me &-uh in I_Spy, where
and so ‡ the negro &+s spy had a daughter which was a overseas
and he went to see her which really surprised him . 1504511_1507271
you_know they were both as surprised to see each_other . 1507286_1509246
one was white and one was negro . 1509263_1510513
hm . 1510782_1510912
and so ‡ &-uh the way that the &-uh the writer of the program
how she really love him and he really love her . 1518285_1520915
and they seem to be very close just from mail &*INV:mhm „ you_know
and I_mean that part of it I don't think is fiction at all because
you_know it shows that a relationship between races can exist right
but some people think it's impossible because someone's skin is
yes that's a good one . 1542384_1545074
have you seen a movie recently ? 1546810_1548130
the last movie I seen was the graduate . 1549215_1551085
mhm what was it about ? 1551852_1552582
you can leave out some parts &=laughs . 1554207_1555747
well ‡ it was about a lady they call Missus_Roger and whose &-uh
and the boy was twenty years of age who never knew the difference
hm . 1568364_1568524
but yet still this lady, &-uh she seduced the boy . 1569112_1571632
and then come to find out that &-uh she have a daughter . 1572708_1575978
and then the boy and the girl end up running off with each_other
well ‡ actually before then she really messed the boy's life up . 1580115_1582755
and then <the picture> I think what the meaning of the picture
he tried his best to get away (be)cause he was really scared for
that was his father's best friend's wife . 1598753_1601073
oh . 1601364_1601494
you_know and she was his elder and he had respected her all his
mhm . 1605155_1605315
but yet still she insisted on it that she wanted the boy . 1606015_1608105
she had practically forced the boy, you might as well say . 1608429_1610269
hm . 1610416_1610556
and then it shows how someone that can be so bold also &*INV:mhm
but &=laughs +... 1625591_1625801
that's pretty bold alright . 1626631_1627271
&=laughs yes it was . 1627326_1628216
and at the time when the boy did get out, her husband pull up in a
and it showed <the boy> how the boy really grew up in a matter
hm . 1641435_1641735
you_know and the boy just finished college and everything . 1641751_1644351
it's amazing . 1644890_1645550
but &-uh far as go like <someone is really> a boy is really
&=laughs college yeah . 1653333_1653813
&=laughs it's kinda hard to believe „ you_know &=laughs . 1654103_1656003
&=laughs but it it was a very good picture though and it had a
although if some people seen it &-um they thought it was a little
but I think that goes by how that person think . 1666604_1668894
mhm . 1669470_1669610
you_know if you think dirty, everything will be dirty to you . 1669633_1671393
but if you think there's some moral behind the story, well you
mhm yeah ‡ that's true . 1676865_1677505
and there was a moral behind that . 1678355_1679645
when you were a kid was there a certain group of kids that you
no I was always a loner . 1685158_1687068
same way myself . 1687382_1688062
what_about now ? 1690247_1691217

mhm . 1724105_1724385
you know we never go out together on double dates too much or
mhm . 1727569_1727839
because I like change and back and forth . 1727855_1729275
because I really don't want myself to get involved with (th)em . 1729651_1731911
(be)cause once you get involved, anything liable to happen . 1732900_1734890
you_know and if something happen then your feelings hurt . 1735907_1737927
yeah . 1738426_1738486

I won't be angry towards you . 1771131_1772131
I'll continue to speak to you, talk to you . 1772360_1774550
but yet still in the back of my mind I never forget it „ you_know .
make sure it don't happen twice . 1777783_1778883
mhm . 1779223_1779503
and then like far as it go like &-um (be)cause you're a white man
that's wrong to think because &-um they say all men &+a are created
mhm . 1789959_1790119
and I found out that's true because &-uh some people in my race are
although some of the white men, I have found this out to be true,
but the thing about it when they do take advantage of you they try
I don't know if that's good or bad . 1807290_1808200
and so ‡ like &-uh for instance you find a_lot_of conmen &*INV:yeah
and that had been tried so many times, guys trynna con me you_know
and especially young ladies try to con me mostly for you_know money
and the first girl I ever bought anything for in my life was my
hm . 1827057_1827237
&=laughs other_than that, I won't spend no money on no girl . 1828203_1829903
and then when a girl start conning me or somebody trynna con me, I
(be)cause I started getting around when I was ten &*INV:mhm „
and then mostly the reason why I said I didn't play with no kids
gee_whiz that's quite a difference . 1850477_1852187
+< yes . 1851867_1852177
and see ‡ I grew up fast . 1852584_1853834
I learned a_lot &*INV:yeah very fast . 1854107_1856047
and then I have uncles and aunts who was about eight, nine, ten
mhm . 1863336_1863626
taught me always look out for this, you_know look out for that . 1863736_1865756
and that's why little kids seem to &+l +//. 1866874_1869074
it's like kids to me . 1869241_1869981
&=laughs you_know I really didn't have too much to say with (th)em
+< they were way behind . 1872572_1872952
yeah ‡ and then &-like &-uh for instance once_upon_a_time they had
it was nice . 1880757_1881527
and when I was sposta be in bed at that time of night I was out
the smallest one out there but I was out there &=laughs . 1887438_1889708
&=laughs &-uh if you could live your life over again is there
well ‡ if I could live my life over again I could change something
it is <to be> not to be as poor as I was &=laughs „ you_know .
and try to &+contici conticipate$v more_so than life than I did
because I missed out on a_lot_of things in life . 1921308_1922968
you_know &-like a_lot_of things right now don't interest me because
it just don't interest me at all . 1930112_1931612
you're past it . 1931827_1933117
yeah and then I'm 'a try to grow up a little slower than
<what did you want to be when you> &+g yeah what did you want
when I was back in school ? 1943464_1944464
did you have a goal you were shooting for ? 1944643_1945533
yes I did . 1945557_1946167
I wanted to be a doctor &=laughs „ you_know . 1947399_1951249
but &-uh really a veterinarian, that's what I really wanted to be .
I really had my heart set on it . 1956144_1957214
yeah ‡ your interest in animals and all . 1957577_1959327
yes and I really lost that interest when that dog we had named Keno
when he died I lost all interest in being a vet &*INV:hm „ you_know
how did he die ? 1967809_1968739
what happened, he had stimples@n . 1969139_1971149
oh . 1971568_1971868
and so ‡ the doctor said that they had no cure for a dog with
and so ‡ he said we had a choice either to let him live and suffer
and so ‡ we had him put away . 1984473_1985563
you_know to see the dog living suffering very badly . 1986233_1988933
mm . 1989218_1989358
if you had all the money you wanted just dropped in your lap, what
I'd share a little bit of it with everybody . 1998854_2000474
because I wouldn't want all the money . 2002151_2003161
you find people with a_lot_of money are very unhappy . 2004425_2006715
you don't think money would would thrill you that much then ? 2008509_2012269
no ‡ money can buy everything except love, friendship, happiness .
and those the main things a man need in this world nowadays . 2017125_2019525
that's true . 2019775_2020215
because so-called friends, they'll be around while you got it . 2021311_2025051
but when it's gone, that's when you find out who your friends are „
mhm . 2028523_2028673
if they with you when you're down, those your friends . 2028834_2031444
but if they only with you when you up, they just wanna use you . 2031773_2035903
yeah &-uh what do you do in a day's work ? 2037439_2040599

yeah . 2046241_2046301
okay ‡ for right now, things are slow . 2046829_2050129
and then so ‡ mostly what I do is something like mail or I might
really what you hafta do is look for work . 2059976_2061795
yeah . 2062706_2063016
and but other_than that if it's very busy I help in
hm . 2073885_2074065
you_know how should we arrange these proposals so we can find
and &-uh which is very interesting . 2082032_2083532
you learn a lot „ you_know . 2083554_2085384
+< sounds like it's pretty high level work, that part . 2084793_2087333
yes it's high level work but &-uh you don't get the high level
&=laughs that's the only problem right there „ you_know . 2092659_2094719
yeah . 2095139_2095289
they what they going on by is how much education you had in
+< ah yeah . 2098549_2098619
you_know <if you had> &-uh like for instance as far as I went
and at the time my parents, they wanted me to go to college but my
yeah . 2110591_2110851
and so ‡ I didn't push the issue because before I go to college I
+" well ‡ I'd rather wait and maybe one year I'll go back to school
mhm . 2122519_2122799
which I did start school you_know in landscape design and small
and so ‡ &-um right after I finish high school I moved out „
yeah . 2133369_2133449
(be)cause I wanted to see what it was like on the other side of the
mhm . 2135832_2135952
it looks awfully green to me out there „ you_know &=laughs . 2136192_2138102
yeah . 2138243_2138453
and at the time I was at the age of eighteen then, when I moved out
haven't been back home yet . 2142812_2143702
I'm twenty four . 2144105_2144615
hm . 2145231_2145401
no intentions on going back . 2145914_2147044
mhm . 2147183_2147543
(be)cause I feel once a young man get out there, sposta stay . 2147985_2151275
be able to stand his ground „ you_know . 2151799_2153029
and I think when a young man turn eighteen, if he's not going to
right I agree . 2158560_2159410
because &-um he no more baby . 2160124_2161924
&=laughs you know ain't mama and papa sound educated for eighteen
and meeting them at the bank you_know on payday saying &-uh +"/. 2168583_2171113

I_mean ‡ that's not where it's at . 2173742_2174532
yeah . 2174641_2174721
but I I've been very fortunate though . 2175729_2177429
I guess through the people who I know and everything „ you_know . 2178653_2180823
because really I can't say I had what you call a rough life . 2181523_2184283
because my life was pretty easy really &=laughs to be honest with
mhm . 2192648_2192908
you_know until my taste got so expensive in high school on clothes
then my dad kinda put his foot down you_know &*INV:mm and changed

would there be any decorations ? 2245939_2247429
well yeah ‡ we always decorated a tree or something like that „
but <after I> like I said, after I found out what it was, I
I didn't see no sense in it „ you_know . 2257424_2258244
(be)cause my brother knew also &=laughs what it was so I say it's a

a handkerchief . 2343877_2344477

it was cheap, but +/. 2346403_2348193
that's got a story behind that . 2348241_2349551
and it was a card along with it . 2349732_2350762
and I receive it from my wife . 2351544_2352784
at the time she was my fiancee . 2353302_2354652
and it really got next to me . 2356311_2357381
and then &-uh it's another one that I receive also . 2358539_2360969
it was two very good ones . 2361128_2362068
it's when &-uh I was renting a room with this family . 2362506_2365166
and what it is, they treat me like I was their son . 2365787_2367837
you_know they let me have the use of the whole entire house, the
I was just like I was back at home at mom and dad's you_know really
and at that christmas they gave me clothes you_know, sweater shirts
they knew my taste very well . 2379828_2380698
you_know and they gave me those things which really shocked me
mhm . 2386520_2386790
you_know and I_mean they really seemed like my parents . 2386864_2389224
right today they do . 2389989_2390759
hm gee that's great . 2391661_2392401

at christmas time I always receive a_lot_of gifts . 2396113_2398253
I give quite a few because &-um +//. 2399084_2400734
mostly who I give my gifts to, I don't give gifts to adults very
mostly to kids you_know, my little brothers or little cousins or
&=laughs excuse the expression ! 2411259_2412289
but I enjoyed it because &-um to me to see someone other &+b
and I useta spend my whole paycheck &*INV:mm just buying +/. 2420014_2424334
those kids appreciate it too . 2424379_2425469
&+e and you_know just giving things to people kids . 2425590_2427710
even right today, if my wife don't catch me first you_know
his mother's and father separated so she take care of him . 2437266_2440326
but she to me she's cruel to the boy . 2440826_2442746
hm . 2442966_2443086
because &-um the boy wanna go out and play with some of the other
she said +"/. 2448899_2449039
+" no ‡ you stay in this house „ you_know . 2449266_2450646
and so &-um I_mean ‡ she spanks the boy a_lot . 2451286_2453896
she spank him so bad til you can hear it through the walls just
xxx .
and so what I do, he stays at my house a_lot now . 2458199_2460349
you_know spend the night and everything . 2460499_2461879
I take him out horseback riding, things that he never done before .
and just to see the expression on his face and the other kids
make me feel like I'm doing something „ you_know . 2471398_2472888
and most people really think he's my little brother (be)cause <he
probably better than his brother . 2480427_2481907
&=laughs but little girls, I'll give (th)em a gift but as far as go
because &-um when a girl's at a certain age it's wise for a man not
if anything happen you can be blame whether you was around when it
and it's just a smart thing to do . 2500583_2502353
<were you a> change and make it a_little more serious for a
were you ever in a situation where you thought you might be killed
&-um let me see if I can remember . 2512835_2515655
yes I was once . 2517152_2518292
it was when I fell out_of a two story window once . 2519220_2521490
oh_my_gosh . 2521707_2521767
you_know and what it was, I was just jiving around, my cousin and
she was in the hall . 2534695_2536005
and the bedroom door, when you open it you could throw the ball way
and so ‡ when she &-um threw the ball this time I got ready to hit
and then I see well it might break the windowpane if I swung the
mhm . 2548324_2548474
so ‡ I dropped the bat to catch the ball and when I went back like
&=gasps was the window closed ? 2552931_2553731
no ‡ it was open &*INV:oh (be)cause it was in the summertime . 2554100_2556120
I got the ball and xxx get hurt . 2556821_2558431
but on the way going down a_lot_of thoughts running through my mind
weren't hurt at all, didn't break any bones ? 2561482_2565192
no ‡ I wasn't hurt . 2565372_2566052
I was shocked though „ you_know . 2566069_2567399
well ‡ I guess . 2567753_2568213
that's about all . 2568296_2568786
I landed on my feet and everything . 2568994_2570024
oh_my_gosh . 2570069_2570379
you_know . 2570956_2571136
but I was shocked more than I was anything else . 2572969_2574739
mhm . 2575190_2575310
but other_than that, as far as go like being close to death or
because &-um I really was never around the type of environment
and that's all I hafta say about that . 2588193_2589623
yeah . 2589685_2589845
sometimes people say that whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen .
there's no sense fighting it . 2594330_2595160
+< that's true . 2594990_2595480
that's right . 2595565_2596055
<it doesn't worry> it don't even worry me . 2596134_2597144
and then &-like &-um a_lot_of people tell me „ say +"/. 2597726_2600206
+" you better not go out this time of night because somebody might

certain areas a_lot_of kids wouldn't go through because in order
guys who &-uh collect protection fees . 2612674_2614144
and so ‡ end up I got to know all the hoodlums and thugs around the
but yet still right to this day I don't care . 2624013_2626173
I'll walk through anywhere . 2626432_2627572
if a group of boys come down the street I walk on past (th)em . 2627821_2630011
it don't bother me because I feel this way . 2630449_2632169
it's the good lord meaning for me to get hurt, I'm 'a get
you can't duck it . 2635900_2636280
mhm . 2636297_2636457

and then if you show a person that you're not scared and just
mhm . 2645522_2645702
because they don't know what you gonna do . 2645718_2646608
yeah . 2646873_2647093
but if you show a little bit of fear, which I did one time in my
this one thing I did in my life was when I was in elementary school
he useta wait for me every day he was waiting where I was and every
he was right behind me ready to catch up with me and beat me up „
and so ‡ he chased me up for about a year and half . 2667596_2670316

and he say +"/. 2674470_2674940

and so ‡ at that time I stopped and turned around . 2686306_2688376
the boy caught me and raised his fists and got ready to hit me . 2689005_2691185
we got into a little scuffle . 2691641_2692951
end up I was able to beat the boy &=laughs . 2693576_2695036
and then it was my turn to <do some> &+b do some chasing for a
but it really shocked me that I really could whip the boy . 2700053_2702383
