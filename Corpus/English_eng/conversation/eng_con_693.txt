&~www .
&-um he's got this frog in a jar .
and he's sitting there looking at it .
and then he goes to sleep .
and he wakes up the next morning .
and it's gone .
and then he gets up .
and he looks in his clothes and looks out the window .
and then the dog falls out the window with the jar on his head .
then he goes into the park looking for it and up trees .
and then he looks down a rabbit hole .
and a mole comes up .
and then he climbs up a tree to look in .
and an owl comes out .
and he falls down .
and then he climbs up onto rocks .
and then a deer comes up .
and he falls over his head .
and then he falls down the cliff with his dog .
then he falls into the river .
and the dog comes up on his head .
then he looks in over a big tree stump .
and then he finds them .
and he goes back in the river with them .
