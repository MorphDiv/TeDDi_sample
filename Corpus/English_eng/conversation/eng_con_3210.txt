no because he wasn't presenting real objects . 900000_902345
how possible this is is from what one needs to to identify
yeah absolutely um not just of course <to> to identify what it
so a table we start even thinking about putting papers down on it . 922423_926198
ah a lot of objects um bananas we think about peeling them . 926198_930336
maybe eating them . 930336_932149
we have a sort of a bunch of motor reactions to objects . 932149_936310
you know <they> they we call them affordances . 936310_938600
so what is an affordance ? 938600_941710
an affordance for example would be um a steering wheel <has certain
so as soon as you see a steer if you know how to drive as soon as
you can turn it you can turn these are things you know . 957493_960463
what are the affordances of this ? 960463_962247
you know it's sharp . 962247_966333
but they all were every single one of them were these funny sharp
so there were realy no affordances . 970270_972238
now it turns out that one of the things the frontal lobes also does
one of the things the frontal lobes do is they particularly connect
and so this uh this information is particularly transmitted up to
and the fact that he didn't pick this up is really just a matter of
so we go back to this whole experimental versus observational . 1012340_1015090
course the problem is you can't really observe people you know in
so if he had just put some real object in we would have been able
well beyond that then you'd say not just real objects what about um
ah there are a lot of other conditions <and> and some people
remember the experiment with the image comparison what
remember that one ? 1067511_1068871
you know with the little does he has teeth or claws verses does he
it's all the Kosslyn(sp) imagery work . 1074288_1076558
Kosslyn has done a lot of f_M_R_I work about this kind of thing and
eh if it doesn't I think we might be in a little trouble sometimes . 1098458_1103478
that's ok so so that's all I guess that's all for now ok so
a lot more to that . 1110648_1111985
ok now um there is also some I'll ask you a couple of questions
ah I don't know probably has anyone tried to answer any of those
um in the Massaro readings you know first of all Massaro makes
but it is very hard to really pin down in practice whether an
so what Massaro uses as his example of functional measurement is
ok do you remember the photon thing ? 1153025_1154893
it's not really photons what are they called quanta like quanta and
isn't it one photon one quantum ? 1165700_1167407
quantum of life no ? 1167407_1170510
no physics ok ? 1170510_1171940
I think so I think that means the minimal amount of light would be
and so it ends up with this thing where in fact the retina is
so you have to be dark adapted and probably you know ah I can't
so ah but one of the things was this study went in and said um
so a lot of pho(ton) a lot <of those> of those quanta aren't
so this a <very> very physiological measurement ok . 1231338_1235144
ah <and> and why is this not an experiment ? 1235144_1239247
<why is this> why is this a functional study <and not>
it is tricky . 1247735_1251091
yeah Chris . 1251091_1255257
(be)cause you're not actually controlling how much actual light hits
ah that would be great it that were true that would make a nice
ah oh in that well maybe I'm not quite sure I think the answers
maybe you're right maybe it depends on how you what a second
so that is a variable sort of right . 1295157_1297507
you even saw that you saw that so that hum +... 1297507_1300544
and they can't control what you'll be responsive to . 1300544_1306113
yeah um <I don't know> I don't know . 1306113_1313942
anyone else wa(nt) I'm not trying I don't know that there this is
but ah it doesn't feel like an experiment maybe this is what,
why does this not feel like an experiment ? 1331073_1331436
when you go into the optometrist or to the audiologist do you feel
are you in like <two control one> are you in a control
or are you know see what I am saying is there like a design here ? 1350212_1354348
instead what is going on ? 1354348_1357697
it's sort of like the stimulus is being ratcheted up and your
it's like ah I don't know it is like ah you know how many volts can
you know I don't know if you want to do one of those experiments
ratchet up to the point until something happens ok . 1389084_1392152
so it's like measuring the functional characteristics of you as an
ah how much loudness before <oo> you have you know <this>
another one would be the brain stem response . 1405577_1408779
<ah to aud(itory)> there is a thing called the auditory evoke
and ah you can actual(ly) you know put on EEG cap and then you
ok <there's a> there's a potential . 1417202_1420470
so you could be stuff that really isn't in a way isn't is it an
well see I think that's the problem here is that in a way these are
but they are kind of biological experiments . 1428226_1430833
ok they are almost kind of like real science <xxx> . 1430833_1434904
I don't want to say that no fair how should I say it they are not
right ? 1441958_1443852
would you agree ? 1443852_1444885
what's the hypothesis being tested in the photon experiment ? 1444885_1448289
xxx . 1448289_1449522
try to get some +... 1449522_1455109
do you think their is a hypothesis ? 1455109_1457645
Adler do you say that there is . 1457645_1463897
what is being tested in the photon experiment ? 1463897_1466671
yeah Carry ? 1466671_1475090
a threshold . 1475090_1476422
a threshold . 1476422_1477541
yeah kind of a reactivity . 1477541_1479192
ok what's the point at which ok . 1479192_1482135
ah so I think that's what the distinction here . 1482135_1487491
now what if I said my hypothesis is that peoples' threshold is
oh wait a second th(at) what would you say about that as a
is that a reasonable hypothesis ? 1499561_1502621
peoples yeah . 1502621_1504634
well if you had a reason behind picking nine . 1504634_1506727
there you go . 1506727_1508402
yeah there you go . 1508402_1510426
what would that be ? 1510426_1510652
why would you magically say nine . 1510652_1511718
no clue . 1511718_1513845
yeah no clue I mean this is one of the big times that actually one
ah but ah you know people say <why is it> why is it magically
you know where is the theory that says actually later on we did get
um ah now George Miller had this notion ah the magical number seven
So this when ever we come up with a number in Psychology it's not
ok in fact children's ah short term working capacity actually will
so young children can only remember digit spans of three and four . 1583060_1587018
very young children . 1587018_1587446
and then it goes up to five actually Kelley and I did a bunch of
I've got beautiful graphs showing how childrens short term memory
we are not the only people that have found this but it is a very
ok well so it's an organic thing it's not so much a theory right ? 1603240_1610048
I mean what if I told you the myelin the conductivity of the nerves
right ? 1614602_1615264
because we have myelinization you know remember the nodes of xxx
those increase the speed of the conduction of the neurons so that
it not really um yes or no kind of hypothesis it like how much
ok .
was this important because I think you are going to have a lot of
but ah so that's fine but what about the Sperling thing .
you know there's this ah remember the Sperling one ?
with the ah you know ah r@l q@l two z@l right this business .
I guess this is four rows of four or whatever it is but remember
so in Spurling you know if we point here then we can show the
ah is this functional ?
is this we all remember the experiment is everybody ok ?
um is this a functional study or is this an experimental study ?
<Wh(at)> <why> why is it one or the other here ?
Dwight ?
yeah you're right the theory +/.
he's saying that short term memory's what increased in xxx when he
it's there for a short period of time .
you can't quite recode .
it that remember that whole thing again with the three box theory .
ok then you have your sensory then your short term memory
and you are trying to get stuff over into you short term memory but
ah so you can't get the whole display .
<but if> but it is there for a moment .
so therefore if you probe it you would get a larger ah estimate of
<that's> what I'm trying to get at it's right on that boarder
where the it's it's where it is the size issue .
how much and how big is the number .
he actually does measure the number of characters that you have in
his hypothesis is that they're different .
but he also goes ahead and measures ah the size of them so a way
ok good exactly .
ok ah and then there's another one .
<I think> I've given you enough to help you otherwise that
ok .
so ah ah now +...
we'll talk more about this later on when we get into Massaro's um
ah which is the ah FLMP .
flumpy flump .
ah and you know out maybe several weeks we'll discuss this .
I think that it ends up being the case that functional answers come
and so the degree that to which you end up needing a numerical
so you really are balancing in a sense these two kinds of
in fact I think that's <his> one of his and his people that
sometimes there's a tendency in psychology to go a little bit to
actually maybe I should mention <at this> this is a good time
or dynamical systems some people call them I don't know why one way
but ah dynamical systems actually are probably more of this sort of
they're saying ah we can view the human being actually in terms of
ok yah weather .
who can predict weather .
you predict it by these complete systems .
and a lot of human behavior can be viewed in this way but to do
ah whether it would be a force for moving your arm for example .
ah <or> or walking is a good example for this ok .
there's different types of walking .
how you break into a run .
how we talk about a horse has four different gaits .
ok a horse can have what is it a run a trot a gallop and a cantor I
so each of these ah gates is a different sort of dynamically stable
ah and all of these things are really very much this kind of thing .
still the functional .
ah so there are many good issues in psychology <that> that are
and we don't whatta it all sort of think that hey we're not gonna
ok .
so um .
ok one of the core issues both in the ah +//.
falsifiablity .
one of the core issues in Massaro and but also in the Elms et all
um this ah I just call it give it a general topic but the whole
you probably had this back in the ninth grade .
you probably had it at the beginning at every science book you ever
and it's always the same .
about how wonderful science is .
right .
why is science wonderful ?
what is the thing that makes science so wonderful ?
you have no idea why science is so wonderful .
because we can build bombs .
xxx what makes science so wonderful ?
it's self correcting .
<it the> it's the sort of I think <Elms does it> the Elms
<it> you always get better .
it's always going to get better .
science is going to you know march on until we get closer to truth .
because any time we get a bad idea we can run an experiment and
I fixed the bad idea .
is that right ?
we're all supposed to say right ?
ah is this true by the way ?
do you think this is roughly true ?
yeah ?
<that> was a double negative here and I always have trouble
if you move if believe that with reason you'll always eventually
uhhuh .
that's fine but if reason actually moves you away from your goal .
well right .
then science no matter what no how many times you correct it's just
we could be cycling around .
I mean <it could be> it could be one of these things where
back to the origin <xxx> .
<yeah> maybe with a lot more facts and but your not really
yeah .
yeah .
um that's a tough one .
yeah xxx .
but we do know that over time we do throw away some ideas .
xxx .
you know or ah +/.
what ?
phrenology .
actually we didn't throw away all of phrenology did we ?
we throw away +...
but it came back .
the modularity of mind is sort of <the> the notion that there
ok and now we are trying to throw it away again you know once
but some of these ideas make me think of one of the things .
I don't want to be too cynical because I do believe science is self
I'll accept that .
but um <the> <it> there are some ideas that <die ve(ry)>
because they're very fundamental ideas they're so very vague and
ok .
the problem is figuring how much .
and in what regards they have any truth you know .
so phrenology had a little bit of not the bumps part <no> +/.
not the bumps part .
but the part that said that there were different parts of the brain
that you know we believe .
sort of quote know .
but we only know it to a certain degree and things are never like
yeah .
yeah the uncertainty <business> .
<well> .
see <that's> that's go back to that thing where I was you know
I wish you sort of would have brought it up then because that would
between the observational where <and> and the experimental
you know that's the Hisenburg .
the act of breaking it apart means you violated .
you know .
and ah if you talked to a physicist about that they would say <no>
so people have this pop interpratation of the Hisenburg principle
um <I don't> I don't quite see what's wrong with the pop
<I'm kinda> certainly the pop interpratation has other good
you know .
but weither it exactly follows from the physicist I don't know
you know .
but um the idea that you are destroying things by looking at them .
um that certainly is true for other reasons .
oh oh perceptions color .
ok ok .
so the other one is breaking it up <xxx> .
<ok ok> ok so <who would be a good> see is there a good
<I can give> I can give you one of those which would be Kepler .
who did beautiful studies and got all the things but kept on
eventually he kept on criticizing what was he he kept on firing
there is a number of these where your the is an assistant did the
because he had the wrong theory but the measurements were right .
there was one of those with the ah Greenwich too .
the observatory in Greenwich .
where the director +//.
I mean there's a couple of these running around ok .
so there are cases where the data speak for themselves but the
ah because what ?
he didn't want to get burned at the stake .
ah you know number two you know .
<he just wanted> <he was doing> he was laying the ground
so right we are +//.
and actually this <this goes to what um> this goes to what um
they said <Peirce> Charles Peirce at about the end of the
c@l s@l Peirce .
uh and that would you ever pronounced it Pierce if <I had told you>
no ?
right ?
we call it Pierce or something or Purse .
ok um why do we believe .
the Jewish your right one of the interesting things about the not
ok .
and the idea that Germans were somehow pure xxx .
now everyone knew they were not but then they tried to figure out
most Germans are mostly Aryan .
ok .
this is you know the fact is of course German blood pool has this
plus Celtic .
plus Mediterranean .
plus <overlays all these overlays right> .
Hungarian gene pool ok .
anyone who tries to be a Hungarian nationalist .
the actual you know xxx you know in terms of where they came from
ok .
so all these people want to be nationalist .
you heard about Austria today you know probably on the news you
so Austria you know is another mish mash you know .
but all these people want to make up this notion that they +//.
so then they go out and the Nazi scientists did this .
they tried to find the Aryan characteristics ok .
well first Arian is indo european .
<and> and that means you could be a Persian or who ever these
so where do we get this stuff you know ?
yeah .
I think what it all goes back to that whole um what was it self
self fulfilling yeah .
self fulfilling .
self creating hypothesis right .
which is I think a lot of times more subtle than what the Nazis
<well> the Communists did this .
the Russians did this too .
<ah> ah Stalin was a um ah fancied himself as a linguist .
ok .
ah and he had all sorts of notions <of how> about how language
be believed it ought to have been um +...
well certain types of reconstructions were done ok .
in which ah Slavic had a certain position in the language families
that no one outside would have ever believe except that it fit
ok so I mean it is the same sort of basic story ok .
um <the> the yeah the Subtleties .
you don't need to know the subtleties .
but Stalin got way deep into linguistics and actually all the
and all the pseudo linguists <come> got forced into you know
this happened to psychology in the communists era too .
ah an(d) of course obviously they throw out Freud in Psychology .
it was you know bourgeois .
so now of course I'm not defending Freudian psychology you know .
<but> but right there are trends in <psycho(logy)> in
and they can be heavily +//.
this was actually one of the things I said in the first lecture .
which was one of the problems with psychology is bested interests
and it can be whether it's the oil company telling you about the
or same things with psychology .
drug companies want to sell the drugs for attentional deficit
so they may um you know try to get those studies out favorably
so it's a problem .
it's definitely a problem .
definitely a problem .
ah so is it really self correcting ?
ah probably yeah .
probably despite all these horrible things eventually enough
&=laugh you're a little skeptical .
there is certainly a possiblity .
as you move you could like eventually have a computer do it and
<xxx> .
it doesn't have any innate emotions problems .
<this is what they wa(nt)> this is what <ah ah> ah you
you know he wants the instead of having the reserve board he wants
ah oh I'm sure everybody knows <which one> which economist I
but in any case ah yeah have a computer do it .
well how's going to program the computer xxx .
will be an Arian computer or not an Arian computer .
ok so um there <is another> a couple more points about
one is that um the um one interesting thing is that scientists +//.
a lot of this has to do with this whole social issue .
it you know is a big mistake to think of science is outside of this
certainly that's a fair part of cognitive research methods .
is to understand really the lengths of these nice little reaction
for example the reading wars would be a good one .
ah there are enormous consequences of all this reading research
word superiority theory might be one ok .
but there are a lot of others .
and these are huge battles that <ah> ah teachers will you know
am I supposed to teach phonic not teach phonics .
do I teach it with a bilingual .
you know if I teach a multilingual multicultural group .
what am I supposed to do .
the whole word method .
and so there are huge real world battles out there .
ok .
one of the things that scientists often have is a little bit of
now that was achieved back <in in in> in earlier periods .
ah particularly sa(y) <ah ah> ah the renaissance and ah the
by the fact that sciencetists were often dukes counts earls .
whatever they were .
ok .
they were just plain old rich .
and they thought science was fun .
ok .
now you know there are people like me and we get paid for it .
we live in little suburban houses .
you know .
and we are just like everybody else .
ok .
you know .
but we are doing the same thing .
actually we're getting paid to do things that um people thought
I don't think they had to write grant proposals though .
so <that was> that was a little different .
<but but> but the actual stuff they did <was was was> was
so they had that freedom .
economic freedom .
ah to ah admit they are in the position where they can admit that
now not very many of them do this .
<but it can> but you really can it's really hard for a
or for even maybe for a clergyman .
ah maybe I'm wrong about that .
maybe a clergyman can .
but it's it's now would a shoemaker .
I guess a shoemaker can admit to his customer .
but they can't <make> admit fundamental mistakes .
that they had been building shoes fundamentally wrong .
because they would lose market share and everything .
where as scientists really have the freedom to admit they have made
ok .
now where they +//.
oh there are some examples .
for example Etard is a great example I think of this whole kind of
ah do you know ah the story of the wild child of Aveyron .
the wild boy .
ok may(be) there's really a great French movie about this .
they filled the whole thing with this sort of you know beautiful
Anyway ah you know he found this child .
it had been abandoned .
brought the child up and tried to teach it language .
ah after two years ah finally concluded <the> the kid was
and he had wasted two years of his life .
you know .
so that's a conclusion that the person reached .
in fact probably +//.
Et(tard) and this Etard was a duke and could do this and waste his
<trying> trying to show actually <that that> that language
or whether you know the critical period would be ended once the
but ah other people would go back and say well Etard never really
which he should have .
which his teaching method was bad .
well see I don't go along with that I think the kid was <really
I think Etard was right .
but you know unfortunately with a single case study you can't keep
but in any case Etard did admit <to> that he was gone you know
<so there are um> there are certainly <I think> I think
not very often he is a tough guy xxx .
ok .
ok now another so so admitting that you made a mistake is certainly
so the idea of falsifiablity <is> is really not out there in a
suppose a general could <make> admit to making a mistake right ?
they decide to surround a city you know .
think that one through .
there are some other places .
but it is a costly thing to do .
um meta analysis .
converging operations is another issue .
ok .
um there is a fundamental um +//.
I hate to put to a's after each other .
<can you spell meta(analysis)> can you also spell meta
yeah .
I guess you can do it that way too .
um there's meta analysis versus the critical experiment .
or crucial experiment .
ok can any give me an example of a critical experiment .
a experiment that just like “wow that proved something” .
you've gotta have learned these in your high school classes .
the big experiment .
take a second .
yeah Dwight .
well that one we got right there Ready .
yeah .
so Ready took +//.
<it was in> it was in Massaro also .
<yeah> ah that was done repeatedly but ah it was done clearly
at the beginning of the century .
ah horse meat with flies .
horse meat without flies .
you know .
<but there> yeah there were a couple of earlier attempts but
so that one is pretty straight for(ward) +//.
hi .
um ok ah +...
do you want to try and grab a chair ?
there must be some floating around somewhere .
nope ?
ok .
so um that works .
anyone else ?
critical experiments .
I think I am going to give you time to think .
this is important that you think .
(be)cause <this is> this is so much a part of the culture .
you should be able to go into you mind and pick up little critical
that have you ah know it's like if I asked you um can you tell me
you should now that .
that's part of it you know .
this is the same level .
ok .
ah what are the critical experiments .
yeah ?
oh Curry .
ok .
let's xxx <we got a> <we got ah> we got ready and
and um Madame Curry and radiation .
now what did she xxx what did she do ?
I know she got sick and died of it eventually .
ah well she discovered serendipitously .
but then she ran some experiment .
I guess it was exposure to photographic plates .
wasn't it ?
yeah she found some way to visualize it .
yeah it was very simple .
once she did it .
but it was crucial .
and it showed <that there> <that these> that ah
and you had to put lead .
not lead .
it was a little experiment something like that .
right .
lead photographic plates something .
piece of cake once she had it .
but no one knew it and it was a massive discovery .
ok .
ah what else ?
biology ?
do you take biology ?
DNA ?
DNA is not a critical ex(periment) +//.
ah there are some little experiment down under there .
DNA was the ah formulation of a model .
it was not a critical experiment .
it was crucial no doubt .
but ah then ah it was the piecing together of many experiments into
<and> and you know there was this race to say was the chain
they were building these things in there backyards and everything .
it was sort of like I don't know building some computers we have
ah so I can't +...
that doesn't really work .
what else in biology ?
Men(del's) oh Men(del's) well I was going to say Mendel's peas <is>
ah so what is I can't remember the fruit flies .
drosophilae .
something about ah dominant recessive .
there is a drosophilae experiment .
<you're right> .
<yeah there is> .
<I> I can't I <there are> there is a series of eight
ok .
that um if you open up a genetics book <those are the eig(ht)>
I don't I think drosophilae is one of the but is one of the more
it has to do with the ah movement of limbs .
ah th(at) th(at) it has to do it's not dominant recessive but
the one that you really want I think is Mendel's peas .
oh .
right .
ah the independant assortment .
Mendel and the peas .
ah (do)minant dominant recessive .
ah you know blue eyes you know blue eyes is recessive .
but in the peas I can't remember which on is recessive .
it's some kind of curling pea .
or something you know .
ah and then ah making the hybrid the hybrid cross .
hybrid cross coming out in the ratio of ah one two one isn't it ?
yeah .
and so on ok .
so <that's> that was ah +//.
and now wasn't a single experiment .
it was you know he kept on running it .
and got his numbers wrong by the way and go back and it turns out
not that he faked but the numbers didn't it the numbers aren't the
but basically it was crucial and everyone ignored it for a hundred
almost .
yeah so .
just like xxx with the bats .
ok but that was a fundamental experiment in genetics .
ah there are others .
<which is ah> one is the <ah> ah Mendel's peas .
I don't remember it's the taking of the frog ah frog nucleus .
taking the nucleus out of one cell and <pla(nt)> cloning .
a little these you take the nucleus out into another put it into
ok .
ah then you take a frogs nucleus and put it in a cytoplasm of some
ok another is something you do at the second stage .
of <ah> ah .
your making twins out of certain stages ah +//.
a lot of them have to enucleate .
<pulling> pulling nuclei out .
or um you ah know sort of <swapping> swapping the cytoplasm .
um what other ones .
well they um yeah .
so they're sort of cloning kind of concepts .
ah the one is the you know the enucleation of the cloning one .
ah well any way there are about eight of these things ok .
um in physics there is the Mitchelson Morley .
um ah oil drop experiment ah which that measures the um +...
Does anyone remember what oil drop measures ?
charge on the electron .
right .
charge on the electron .
that's actually a func(tional) not an experiment right .
that's actually a functional measurement in our terms that Massaro
you actually got the number on it .
so that's interesting .
ah what about Galileo ?
the what ?
the ball drop .
yeah well he didn't do it off Pisa but <it it it> it you know
doesn't matter .
ok but he made a couple of these things .
ok .
um so you know ah there's others .
there's Tessla(sp) .
with the torshum(sp) beam .
<and> and ah oh gosh what others .
you know there's that one with the um +//.
there's some in neurophysiology like <ah> ah Galvany(sp) with
you know ah putting the neuro impulse into the legs and it going
ok .
so these are critical experiments .
they absolutely show that such and such is happening ok .
ah do we have any of these in psychology .
you don't have to answer that one .
they're a lot harder to find .
<the(y're) the(y're)> they're kinda of out there .
they're not quite as critical but there are some classics .
<that> that really have sort of xxx the field .
but <they> we certainly can't build psychology up the way you
ah more than a dozen probably in physics right ?
cause you got a lot of others .
you got boxes hitting each other and stuff xxx +...
um meta analysis is more important in psychology and converging
so piecing together what we know at this point .
ah I don't know <I guess> I guess we're probably still at the
so <it's> it's not a beautiful state of affairs .
but that's the real world that we're not quite ready for the
maybe we never will .
maybe the other story is that with really ah complex systems
I don't actually believe that I just think we are quite ready to
ah there is another way +//.
ok so what is meta analysis .
um actually a couple good examples of this there um a guy named
discovered you know the origins of cholera .
ah through ah the kind of work that we really do in psychology .
which is correlational studies .
ok meta analysis correlational studies .
he simply looked at ah the number of cases of cholera across two
he compared the south xxx versus the xxx company .
he found that ah there were thirty seven cases for ten thousand in
and he basically implicated the water from the xxx company as the
ok .
so this is the kind of thing obviously a lot of medical research is
ah do people get ah you know more heart attacks +//.
the latest one I heard is really great .
you get more heart attaches if um your balding starts up here than
did you hear that one ?
isn't that great .
Virgina heard that one .
anyone else hear that one ?
no .
a couple of people .
ok .
ah wow !
you know <is> what now it that because of the balding or
you know some other enzyme or something .
ah pellagra was discovered the same way .
so was pellagra discovered in the south I guess .
south of the US .
and eventually was related to what ?
diet deficiency I guess .
pellagra ?
some kind of +...
boiling killing the something like that .
<yeah yeah> yeah .
it's just not that but it was the soil and boiling went together or
I think .
ah .
right .
I can remember this whole Tom Lear song about pellagra .
but anyway .
ok <so> so this is obviously +//.
we're not able to always run critical experiments .
that doesn't mean we can't either run correlational meta analysis
ok I mean certainly is true that cholera ah you know is caused by
eventually had to figure out what that was too .
ok but the notion of critical experiments goes and goes back to
falsifiablity it the over all thing .
um strong it's called um strong falsification .
so you could falsify these um +...
maybe the cholera issue by saying ah yeah but notice that the
I guess the thing was that both south work and voxel were feeding
so that really wasn't possible there .
but sure ok .
ah strong falsification is dis(cover) you know +//.
Massero talks about it and in a I think a very naive way .
you know .
and he shows a little truth table and makes it sound all wonderful .
you know ah and +...
you know the reality of it is is <it just> it just doesn't work
there is always going to be on every experiment a rival hypothesis .
some other factor that wasn't controlled .
so basically actually I mean I'm not against strong falsification I
but the reason that we can't get to these critical experiments yet
plus that thing itself is so much linked to so many other things .
um but there is progress .
um the idea of strong falsification though <is> is more of a
this is what I really wanted to talk about .
ah there's a this kind of this macho image ok .
in a lot of ah a lot of professions ok .
and um it's like if you're a serious scientist then the way you
so the idea is that a psychologist really wants to be a physicist
this is known as physics envy .
and um and physics has the you know Mitchelson Morley <water drop>
ah so therefore we should do strong falsification .
and if you're not doing an experiment that looks like you're doing
so like this guy I was telling you about with his little Atneave
yeah he did do a strong falsification .
he showed that the other quote theory was wrong .
but wrong in the case that it was irrelevant to you know to normal
ok but it was still I don't actually think it was a bad experiment
so this is that notion of sort of toughness here .
and other experiments do have this ah same notion of <what is>
ah for example ah business people .
<what is> what is being tough in business .
what's your image tough businessman
