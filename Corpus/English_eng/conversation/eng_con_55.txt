well there were two friends that were together .
well they used to be together .
and they separated .
and in this particular spot in the city .
and they were supposed to meet back here in twenty years .
well one showed up .
one of the men showed up patiently waiting .
when a police officer walked past checking doors as he went along .
he stopped to ask the gentleman what was going on .
and he said he was waiting for a friend .
in the meantime he lit this match to light his cigar .
and the policeman found out there that he was wanted by the police
but he went on through his difficulties .
said he would be waiting .
and the policeman walked away .
he started checking doors .
bid each other good night .
and then a fellow ran up from across the street .
right up from across the street from the opposite side of the street
and walked up and said Jim by name +"/.
+" is that you ?
said +"/.
+" yeah it's me .
and so they started talking .
and they noticed that the place had changed .
from once upon a time was a cafeteria or a restaurant .
and now it was another building .
and as he went on talking the man told him that he was under arrest .
he said +".
and passed him a note .
and he read that the policeman was actually the guy that he was
announced that he was wanted .
and he read this note .
and said he was wanted for this particular crime in Chicago .
and said that before I go to the station I want you to read this
that's what he said .
and he read it .
and it said that the original guy was this police officer .
and he arrested him .

I was going to Douglass elementary school .
so they enrolled them both to the same school where I was .
and there we became the best of friends up through the years .
I don't think there was nothing too great for either of us or one
but there came a time when Bar_Lastname +...
he was a year younger .
got into some serious trouble and went to prison .
Dutch became a gangster .
he offered me things that I didn't accept .
because I don't do drugs .
but they made plenty of money .
eventually Bar_Lastname was killed .
and Dutch_Lastname was is in bad shape now healthwise .
