one night a boy and his dog and his frog <were> were awake .
and the boy and his dog were looking at the frog to see how he was
the little boy and his dog went to sleep .
but the frog was still awake .
and he escaped from the glass jar .
then when the boy woke up he noticed the frog was gone .
he looked in the shoe and in his boots .
<and the dog> and the dog well he was very silly .
he put his head into the glass jar .
he was stuck in it .
and then the boy remembered ah left the window open last night
so then he opened it some more .
<and he went> and he went calling for his frog .
and the dog <was almost> was almost all the way out the window
then the dog fell out_of the window .
and the boy was like hm !
then well the boy came out_of the house .
and he looked very angry at the dog .
<and he went> and then he walked a little .
and he like called for his frog some more .
and then they walked just a little further .
the little dog was jumping up on this tree .
and on this tree was a bee hive .
and the little boy went calling into the hole .
and the dog tried to shake the tree a little .
and it looks like there was a little animal in there .
and he bit his nose !
and the little +...
and the dog he shook it again .
and the bee hive fell down !
and the little boy looked in the in the big old tree for his frog .
and then of_course the swarm of bees go chasing after the dog .
and an owl pops out instead of his frog .
the little boy is trying to get away from the owl .
and then he climbs on some rocks .
when he climbs on the top of the biggest rock well he looked over
to his surprise <there are antlers> they were antlers instead
and the animal picked the little boy up on his head .
and he was stuck between the antlers .
and the animal had him still stuck on his head .
and the dog was barking and jumping at the animal .
and then the animal threw the little boy off his antlers .
and he knocked the little dog and it appears he knocked the little
they must have had a pretty wet time down there .
and kersplat@o right in the water !
then the little boy sat up .
and the little doggie got on his head .
he listened very closely .
then he told the little doggie to ssh be quiet !
and then they looked over that log that the little boy was sitting
<and when they> and when the little boy climbed over the
and he had a girl frog with him .
not only was it a girl friend frog .
they had already been married and had babies !
in just a few hours !
my mom hadta wait a few months for me !
so the little boy asked the frog is it okay if I take one of your
and it looks like the frog agreed with him .
and the little boy took the frog baby and went home with his dog .
and they all lived happily ever after .
well on the cover the little boy is probably saying where's my frog
and the little dog in his mind even_though he has a little one he
and they and the dog might be feeling sad .
and so is the boy .
www .
he's hidden .
one night a little boy <and> and a dog are looking at his pet
and well by the way the little boy looks he looks happy .
I think it might be a new pet frog .
and the dog well he's very new to this animal .
and he's like hm I hafta get useta this .
that's what he's thinking .
so well I know I can tell you why this happened cause the dog and
well the frog is getting out_of the jar because <maybe he>
and maybe he wants to find his real mom .
so the next morning the little boy woke up .
and the dog woke up .
why the boy looks surprised is his frog is gone !
and the dog <looks> looks surprised too .
and they look around for about an hour or so .
and they're both looking all over the place .
and the boy is saying where could he be ?
<and like> and it looks like the boy is sad and surprised at
and the dog I don't know why his eyes are closed .
and he's smiling .
I don't know .
now the dog looks friendly .
and he's looking all over the place .
he's crying out for his frog <some> some more .
and this time he looks &-um sad and surprised but more sad .
is the boy saying something here ?
yeah he's saying come here froggy come here !
maybe he's asking people have you seen my frog ?
and the dog probably feels feels sad that he's got his head
and the dog falls out the window .
he looks like he's scared .
and the little boy is like hm .
he looks surprised .
I can't exactly tell the expression on his face .
what would you guess ?
&-um afraid that his dog might get hurt .
then when he comes outside the little boy was angry at his dog .
and the dog's doing his little puppy act .
how did that happen ?
well the little dog fell out_of the window .
and the glass shattered .
so the boy went calling for his frog some more .
now he looks like he's really worried .
but the dog is curious because he's looking at the bees .
<he's> so like I just said the boy is calling out some more
so they just travel a little north to that little tree .
and the little boy looks in the hole .
and he's calling down there cause he thinks well maybe my frog's in
he was a little worried because well he doesn't know .
but he thinks that he might be down there .
<and the boy looks> <I mean and> the dog looks happy
but now one animal pops out .
one animal looks angry .
now the little boy looks at him and goes zzz .
why does he have have his hands on his nose ?
cause the little gopher or whatever it's called bit my nose !
that's what it looks like .
and the little dog <he's> he's barking somewhere .
and he's a little angry .
and then the gopher or whatever he is he says well he's around here
and then the dog goes &-uh oh I just broke something .
and they look angry .
and the little boy looks relieved .
like they might look in the hole cause he thinks his frog might be
what is he saying ?
he's saying here frog come on frog !
let's see if you're in here .
and here is an owl .
and an owl jumps out at him .
so of_course the little boy is disappointed .
and he's kind of angry .
the dog is scared <out_of> half out_of his wits cause he's
woof woof woof !
the dog's saying how did I get myself into this ?
and then the little boy is saying shoo get away you owl !
the little boy is probably <feeling> feeling angry at him .
so then the little boy goes up some rocks .
and he gets to the top of a big rock .
he says here frog here frog !
and he looks &-um +...
he doesn't look so &-um relieved like he did the other two times .
but maybe <he> he feels like oh I don't think the frog may be
<and> so he's still calling and looking over some branches .
whoa <the owl's> the owl's swooping up there .
and the little boy he looks surprised cause an animal had just
and he's like whoa whoa !
the little boy is still surprised .
and animal's mad .
and the dog he looks mad barking at the animal saying put my master
so he says okay I'll put him down .
so he puts him down pushes him throws the boy off pushes the little
the little boy is like surprised .
whoa !
he is scared .
he is happy .
and then the dog's scared too .
so they fall into the river .
that animal feels happy .
those two feel wet .
they're sort of surprised .
and they're smiling .
and the little boy is listening wondering now what could that be ?
so why is his hand up to his ear ?
he's trying to listen to what that is .
and he's telling the dog be quiet .
I'm trying to listen .
and the dog swam across <which> where the boy's going .
and those two look over the log .
and they found his frog .
the little boy looks happy .
<and the frog I mean> the frog looks happy .
and the dog <he probably> he's probably saying to himself I
<all that> this wasn't worth all of that !
I was stung by some killer bees .
I don't believe this .
and I almost got scraped and scratched by glass .
and now the little boy is surprised .
the little dog is standing up on the log sitting on the log on all
he thinks oh well there are baby frogs .
maybe it was worth it .
the reason the boy is surprised is like wow he's got these little
the little boy is probably saying wow !
man <I didn't> I didn't know that a frog could do all this
so then the little boy looks happy that he finally found his frog .
but he also noticed that this is where he belongs .
he feels happy the frog finally found a place that <he> he
but he still wants a pet frog .
so he asks the frog may I take one of your babies home ?
the frog says okay .
and as I said the boy's happy .
and the dog's happy .
and everybody's happy in the end .
and <that's > that's the way it ends .
I mean he lost something .
<but maybe> but now he (ha)s got another frog .
and he can take care of the baby .
and he's gonna grow up .
and this is probably gonna happen in the future .
so I'll be very quiet
