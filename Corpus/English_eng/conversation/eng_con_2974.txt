okay, I'll let you guys rally-robin, share your thoughts with each other, how you guys could build a better calorimeter . 315_4995
go ahead and do that . 5275_5855
tight and enclosed area for the can so the heat will reflect off the hanger and back into the can . 5975_15775
I think that we can put the foil a little bit tighter, make more contact and, like you said, put foil around the crunch wrap, make the foil more smaller . 18245_34285
the aluminum foil around the cheese crunch and soda can for more contact . 34625_38825
and so it could have a better flow of heat and energy to the soda can . 39825_43145
cover the opening of the can . 43965_45825
so all the flame will just go in the can so if +... 46025_49965
and it won't escape . 50085_50165
yeah, it won't escape from the top, so that's the only opening from the can . 50205_54365
yep . 54785_57145
light it from the bottom, and then it'll go up . 57445_59865
maybe you can put the can more closer to the fire and then it'll burn more . 61925_68685
but if you put too close the cheese crunch will literally be on xxx . 69345_74085
surround the can and trap in more heat . 74325_78225
S_nine ?
you can bring the xxx to the burning cheese crunch . 79265_86465
or you can make the cheese crunch more bigger or closer to the can . 87505_91605
or we should have a bigger can so it could trap in more heat . 92985_95365
it could work because if it has more energy, it would heat up more and hold more energy . 97185_105645
I agree with that because if you have more energy the thermometer will have more heat for the thermometer to go . 106545_114845
okay, what did you guys say here ? 135355_136575
cheese crunch closer to the can . 137195_139455
okay . 139975_140135
so you're going to bring the cheese crunch closer to the can . 140335_142115
why are you going to bring it closer to the can ? 142295_143635
because the fire will be closer to the can . 143895_145775
okay, so you think the flame will be brought closer to the can, hence more energy will be brought to the can . 145875_151595
what else ? 151735_152035
what are some other ways that you guys shared out ? 152115_154015
stick your thermometer in the can and then take the foil and wrap it around the whole thing . 154155_157735
okay, so you want to stick the thermometer on the can already, is that what you're saying ? 159015_162935
like in the mouth of the can . 162955_164315
okay . 164655_166215
you're going to stick it in the mouth of the can . 166415_168015
surround it, all around it . 168395_170415
so you're going to surround it with foil . 170415_171815
so you're trapping more heat . 171975_173095
okay . 173235_173415
so not too much heat is escaping . 173405_174845
mm-hmm . 175145_175385
okay, all right . 175785_175925
all right, good . 175945_177065
so some good ideas, good job . 177305_178845
we could put three cheese puffs and burn it in the middle . 179665_187205
okay . 187585_187805
whole class keep in mind, because this just came up . 187985_190545
we are not using more than one cheese crunch, so keep that in mind . 191325_194365
we're only bringing one . 194565_195365
and we cannot attach anything on the can, okay ? 195645_198985
so just keep that in mind . 199025_200145
so everything has to be separate from the can, so to speak . 200065_203945
all right .
so nothing taped directly on the can . 204205_206805
okay, because we don't want anything burning . 207285_208285
all right, go ahead . 208565_209625
continue your discussion . 209745_210505
sorry . 210825_210845
and what else ? 212005_212705
we should make a wall +... 212725_213925
and burn it in the middle and all the heat around the cheese puff could go up and make kind of a bigger fire . 214245_222725
so what are you going to put around the middle of the cheese crunch ? 222885_224785
I think I know what else we could do . 227645_229425
okay, go ahead S_seven . 229845_230785
maybe we can make the can more closer or you could put tinfoil on to connect it to the cheese crunch and connect it to the can . 230785_243065
okay . 243305_243465
but remember the tinfoil can't be attached directly to the can so it has to surround it . 243865_248545
yeah, surround it . 249045_249685
that's what I +...
so you just want to surround it ? 250205_251385
okay . 251465_251605
good . 251765_251965
all right .
these are good thoughts . 252565_253365
well, put aluminum foil around here so it can make more energy to the soda can, or make a better flow instead of it going everywhere . 255715_264835
okay .
very good . 265855_266095
and what do you think in terms of the ring stand ? 266475_269195
the height of the ring stand, what do you think you could also do ? 269375_271895
I can make it lower . 272075_272795
okay . 273275_273455
make it lower so it's what ? 273555_274635
it has more contact . 275155_276115
it has more contact with +... 276495_277515
okay, good . 277775_278575
alright . 278775_278895
awesome . 279095_279215
have your peace and quiet back . 279655_281295
you guys had some wonderful thoughts as I was going around to different groups . 285605_288745
so let's share out . 288925_289665
someone raise your hand and share out what are some ways that we can improve your calorimeter to trap more heat . 289925_295705
go ahead, S_five . 295905_296505
one way that you can trap the heat inside the can is to cover the top of the can so the heat wouldn't escape as much . 296605_304005
okay, good . 304245_304725
covering on top of the can so heat wouldn't escape . 304905_307645
and we established yesterday that heat does escape from the top of the can . 307945_311305
however, what do you guys have to do when you're collecting data ? 311395_316815
okay you can cover the top of the can, but there's something we have to do . 316975_320535
so you have to be careful about covering the top of the can . 320655_324295
what is that, S_eight ? 324395_324875
you stick a thermometer in there . 325255_326835
you still need to stick a thermometer, right ? 326875_328575
to make sure we're measuring the change of temperature . 328735_332615
right ? 332855_332955
so if you want to cover some of the mouth that's okay, but make space for your thermometer so you could collect your temperature readings . 333185_341525
what are some other ways that we can improve our calorimeter ? 341905_346245
go ahead, S_seven . 347005_347805
one thing we can do to the calorimeter is we can put tinfoil around the can and then it will be +... 347825_358685
more heat will get trapped because the can is being surrounded by the tinfoil . 359355_365955
okay, good . 366695_367735
so you want to put the foil surrounding the can and surrounding the cheese crunch too . 367875_372475
so the heat and energy is more concentrated toward the can . 372675_375695
excellent . 376035_376335
very good . 376515_376875
some other ways that we could improve your calorimeter, go ahead S_eight . 377135_381715
you could take the aluminum foil, make a wall out of it and surround the can . 381835_386235
okay, good . 386775_387275
so you're sort of creating just like a wall that also surrounds the can so more energy is flowing to it . 387285_393545
those are some great ideas and some of them I already put up here . 393785_396785
so what most people said is to wrap foil surrounding the soda can and cheese crunch to help trap the energy, so that's good . 396945_403925
a lot of you said bring the soda can closer to the burning cheese crunch, which is excellent . 404385_409465
that's another good way to help improve your calorimeter . 409665_412565
some of you actually mentioned here to add less water into the can . 414075_419015
whole class, if we're boiling a pot of water, what would boil faster ? 419415_424195
the pot with less water or the pot with more water ? 424455_426875
whole class . 426935_427315
less water . 427455_428295
less water, good . 428455_429275
all right . 429775_429915
but I will say this though actually, today we're actually going to use the same volume of water just to keep it consistent with everybody . 430175_437515
so let's use one hundred milliliters today, even though that could be a way to improve your calorimeter . 437675_441815
let's keep your water at a hundred mils . 442495_444295
okay guys, can you do that ? 444435_445575
mm-hmm .
okay, let's keep that at a hundred mill . 445795_447215
and last thing, which nobody had yet to mention, this is the last thing I'll input . 447435_452975
you could position the cheese crunch vertically . 453435_455875
yesterday when I showed you guys, I put it positioned sideways or horizontally . 456395_464935
maybe this time you could position it vertically also, okay ? 465515_469035
so it lights almost like a candle . 469115_470355
all right . 470705_470945
or just vertically . 471125_472425
all right .
so, good . 472985_473945
those are all great ideas . 474445_475965
let's quickly move on to your agenda . 476125_478225
then we will get going with your design . 478505_483265
I'll just give a minute for your agenda . 487805_491125
for your homework, you're only responsible to go up to number three, for in your homework in the back . 505785_510765
so just keep that in mind . 510945_512685
okay, just about ten more seconds before we move on . 512725_523325
okay let's have our focus back up here . 524985_529885
so if you recall on the back of your worksheet, you had your data table . 530865_535865
you filled out the one that I did yesterday . 536165_538225
so let's go to the back of your worksheet . 538385_539665
so you guys filled this out yesterday for when I demonstrated it . 540905_546605
you need another copy ? 546685_547525
yes .
and someone tell me what kind of data +... 548845_554505
someone raise your hands, remind the whole class . 554825_556585
what kind of data do we need to collect before we burn our cheese crunch ? 556565_561545
you have to measure the intentional mass . 561885_563725
initial mass, right ? 564185_566065
you have to measure the initial mass . 566125_567505
so let's look at how we're going to do that first . 567645_569445
so we have our electronic scale here, electronic balance, and there's a button that we push on the side here and, whole class, what are the only two buttons we need to worry about today on this ? 570025_581585
whole class . 582045_582645
what is it ? 582745_583105
on button .
and ? 583105_584345
tare button .
tare button . 585605_585905
good . 586105_586265
and when you push it to the side, it only comes out at this angle . 586505_589465
please do not try to pull it . 589725_590925
it just comes out at this angle . 591345_592305
so I'll just turn it on . 592405_593285
now, can I start measuring the initial mass already, whole class ? 593825_597125
no . 597225_597685
no . 597905_598065
what do I need to put on it first, whole class ? 598165_600145
plastic . 600265_601025
good . 601265_602585
we have to put the plastic container . 602905_604385
now, if you can see, it's already measuring the mass of the plastic container . 604645_610525
is that data that I want for initial mass ? 610665_613245
no .
no . 613865_613985
so what do I have to press, whole class ? 613985_615365
tare .
tare button . 615785_616765
good .
so now it resets to zero . 617865_619385
so we want that resetted to zero before we measured initial mass or we measured the mass of anything . 619605_625585
so, whole class, do I only measure the cheese crunch when I do this ? 626225_632045
no . 632265_632525
no . 632845_632925
what do I want you guys to measure ? 633025_634265
the foil . 634585_634845
everything .
basically everything, right ? 635605_636705
so your whole bottom part of your apparatus . 636805_639265
so you need to make sure you have the big foil on there and you have the square foil in there . 639365_645145
I don't want you to just measure the cheese crunch because crumbs might fall in . 645245_648585
also it will be just tougher to measure because after it's burned it could crumble to little pieces and that'll be really tough to try to measure the mass from . 649105_656165
so we'll just leave everything on the foils with the cheese crunch, with a nail . 656305_660165
and you guys could just measure the initial mass in there, make sure you write it in there . 660445_663905
okay . 664205_664445
besides initial mass, someone raise your hand and tell me what's the other data that you need to collect ? 666245_671345
go ahead . 671885_673345
initial temperature ? 674205_674945
the initial temperature, good . 675525_676765
whole class, does the thermometer touch the bottom of the can ? 676945_681225
no . 681385_681745
no . 682125_682305
good . 682465_682665
so make sure the thermometer never touches the bottom of the can, all right ? 682825_686365
that's the major thing I want you to remember when you're taking your temperature . 686685_691065
are you guys taking the temperature of what ? 691265_692985
water . 693405_693885
water, good . 694335_694975
so you're taking the temperature of water . 695335_696555
all right .
so those are the major things that I just wanted to go over before you collect your stuff . 696895_702195
let's go . 702315_702635
get your eyes over to the side here . 702915_704495
I'll tell you what we're going to collect . 704575_707295
