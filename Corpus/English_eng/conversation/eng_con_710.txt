&-um the little kid and the dog have got a frog in a jar .
and then the frog escapes , while they're asleep .
and then they go chasing for it .
and like the dog smashes the glass jar (be)cause he gets 0 on
and then they they they go out into the fields and stuff
and then that they find a beehive .
and then like the the dog knocks the beehive over .
and then this little gopher thingy &-um like scowls at the boy .
and then then they go over to some rocks .
and being then they're being chased by the bees .
and then they land on a deer .
and then the deer pushes them &-um off off like a little ledge
and then they find the frogs with the little froggy family .
and then they take one of the frogs home .
