sorry we could only get the old book . 6525_8005
oh that's okay . 8265_8625
okay . 8785_9005
(0.9) so we have questions on electron transport or what ? 9565_20925
&-um you &~kn that oxylacetate you know that there's like a a weird cycle . 21525_26345
it's it sorta seems ⌈ separate ⌉ . 26625_27605
⌊ citric ⌋ acid cycle ?
no it's something sort_of related to it but it's not it . 28935_32895
okay +/.
+, like I was reading in the book . 34315_35375
it's like . 35555_35795

⌊ okay ⌋ I just +... 41075_41375
for the fatty acid breakdown right ? 42515_46595
&-uh yeah I ⌈ think so ⌉ . 46835_47775
⌊ okay ⌋ do you know what chapter that is ? 47775_49555
⌈ it's way past this ⌉ . 49675_51435
⌊ &-um in ⌋ &~alri is it all in the same &~ch it was like . 52215_54295
glyoxylate ?
yeah +/. 55275_55655
⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 57865_58265
+, ⌊ I'm just ⌋ sort_of confused about it like . 58265_60365
the purpose of it ? 61005_61925
or ⌈ what ⌉ . 62125_62425
⌊ like ⌋ I I know it's like it breaks down fatty acids but like how is it related to like the citric acid it like feeds to the citric &~a acid cycle . 62425_70745
right right okay so some of the same enzymes are involved okay +/. 71025_77685
okay +/. 78045_78165
+, like &-uh you go from acetyl CoA to citrate that's +/. 78285_81685
+, okay ⌈ yeah yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you know exactly ⌋ what you do in the citric acid cycle so you &~s have a citrate synthase that does that . 82215_86975
okay then you go to isocitrate just like in the +/. 87955_91215
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ citric acid ⌋ cycle so ⌈ aconitase ⌉ . 91495_93395
⌊ and ⌋ what &~i what does this mean ? 93715_94755
like you know that means that if there +//. 95115_97195
ATP would inhibit it ? 97755_98895
or +/.
⌈ &-um let's find out ⌉ .
+, ⌊ is that &~j like an inhibition ⌋ ? 100315_102235
and in calcium and ADP &~s like . 103675_107195
that &~i that's what it appears to be so ATP would inhibit that . 107865_113065
(be)cause &~i is it (be)cause it &~bi it binds to that or or something ? 113785_116325
it probably binds to the enzyme +/. 116605_119485
okay +/.
+, isocitrate dehydrogenase ⌈ which ⌉ . 120305_121685
⌊ oh okay ⌋ and it +/. 121945_122805
+, ⌊ changes ⌋ the conformation . 123025_123625
yeah so and it's it's an allosteric inhibitor . 124005_126725
oh okay +/. 127345_127725
+, and so these are allosteric activators . 127765_129665
⌈ okay ⌉ ? 130025_130605
⌊ oh ⌋ so allosteric inhibitors bind to the enzyme and change the active site ? 130765_134605
or is that ⌈ so oh okay ⌉ . 134635_136615
⌊ right right ⌋ .
okay ? 137795_138195
okay +/.
+, okay so &-um ⌈ maybe ⌉ . 138415_144015
⌊ like ⌋ my book started talking about these two like how they different parts of it give off CO two . 144275_148315
right so we have CO two +/. 149035_151275
yeah +/. 151815_151895
+, so what do you think that means ? 152275_154535
+, ⌈ I remember ⌉ +/. 155355_156255
+, ⌊ so how many ⌋ how many carbons does citrate have ? 156255_158675
doesn't it have six ? 158955_160415
right +/. 160735_161115
+, so it gives off two +/. 161355_162415
+, it &~g +/.
+, isn't isn't there like two parts to it ? 163405_165205
like . 166545_166625
okay let's look at the structure . 167605_169565
⌈ wait ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ &=pause_while_reading okay so here's citrate +/. 171805_180305
+, &~ci yeah +/. 180625_180685
+, okay ? 181045_181345
like I think this one's the one that leaves . 181865_184245
which one's the one ? 184745_185585
the middle one ? 185945_186585
the new one ? 187645_188265
no the middle one here +/. 188485_189825
right +/. 190145_190425
+, that's the one that leaves first . 190705_192385
right +... 193165_193265
so what does that mean ? 194565_199485
that it changes shape ? 200745_204585
right so this is your substrate citrase citrate and aconitase the enzyme +/. 205045_211965
okay +/. 212565_212885
+, is gonna change it to well eventually to isocitrate +/. 213265_216705

+, ⌈ oh okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ six carbons ⌋ at this point okay ? 218265_220025
then you have this oxidative ⌈ decarboxylation step ⌉ . 220705_224745
⌊ oh so that &~car ⌋ <that would> &~ca that would cause the CO two to leave . 224965_227385

I'll be right back .
okay so &-um . 314525_319945

&~wh why do you need oxaloacetate to be reversible ? 2174365_2177525

or it's just . 2200765_2201325
it might be used very quickly . 2201705_2203425
so that's why it's in low concentrations . 2204585_2205925

doesn't it lower the gradient or something ? 3992245_3994565

&-um (0.4) didn't figure this out . 4071465_4077165
oh here's your little cytochrome stuff right ? 4078405_4080345
no . 4081165_4082565
no they were like real big pictures though they (0.8) . 4083005_4084965
oh so it comes out complex three . 4086905_4096065
yeah . 4096285_4097025
it goes in one and is carried by that QH two that's ubiquinol and it goes to three and then goes to the Q cycle . 4097225_4106865
mkay where does the other four get pumped out_of ? 4107905_4110185

NADH dehydrogenase right ? 4126275_4127455

is this where he's talking about NADHs ? 4151815_4152835
yeah let's just answer the questions . 4153075_4154275
yeah right ? 4154615_4155995
right ⌈ okay ⌉ . 4156195_4157155
&=laughs ⌊ okay ⌋ .
so what happened ? 4157855_4158315
oh she's about to tell us . 4160035_4161435
so complex one is NADH ⌈ dehydrogenase ⌉ +/. 4161455_4165135
⌊ yes ⌋ +/. 4165675_4165695
+, okay ?
so all the NADH from glycolysis and the citric acid cycle . 4165995_4170075
go through that . 4170455_4171155
yes . 4171515_4171895
they come in and they drop off the electrons they've been carrying and are converted back to NAD plus . 4172115_4177075
and those electrons are taken by complex one or &~N NADH &~dehydor dehydrogenase complex . 4179465_4185645
isn't it &~i &~i for every one NADH two go out and then &-uh so you have two NADHs going that's why you have four ? 4186745_4193685
⌈ oh okay ⌉ +/. 4194745_4195685

yeah +/.

it doesn't take the NADH it takes the two electrons that the NADH have carried . 4209665_4212945

why is there only one H though ? 4218945_4220645
how does it have two ? 4220665_4221465
okay draw up on the board +/. 4222425_4225185
it's +/.
+, NAD ⌈ plus ⌉ . 4225425_4226065

watch . 4233825_4234465
whoa careful . 4236605_4236905
&=writing:board okay ? 4238125_4250485
so you have NAD plus plus two electrons plus two hydronium ions right ? 4250885_4257325
so that's actually two hydrogen protons +/. 4257465_4259865
okay +/.
+, okay ?
now what happens is &=writes:board this guy takes the two electrons okay ? 4262295_4266655
+, hm +/.
+, and takes one hydronium ion . 4266875_4269835
okay ? 4270075_4271135
so if he takes two electrons and one hydronium ion what's his charge gonna be ? 4271335_4276755
he's already plus . 4277135_4278095
so it'd be . 4278755_4279235
so you take one of those pluses away so <then you> is you add two minuses so one plus . 4279495_4286295
so it becomes a negative ? 4286315_4286975
two minus . 4287635_4288255
oh okay so it &~becom if it's negative the H is there it's ⌈ like ⌉ . 4288425_4291645
⌊ plus one ⌋ plus +/. 4291985_4292645
so it's +/.
+, so what does that yield ? 4294025_4295025
zero . 4295265_4295605
oh .
one plus wait . 4296205_4298925
that's zero . 4299325_4299765
that is zero +//. 4300485_4300865

oh +/.
+, very good . 4303145_4303385
that's zero . 4303565_4303965
so then you get NAD H because you took one of those plus the hydronium ion . 4304065_4313365

you have an N it's bound to four things . 4356485_4359705

they just sort_of show you a picture . 4399205_4401265
okay &=laughs (0.7) .
and then FADH is exactly the same as NADH for this complex two that's why you get four also . 4402085_4414965
what's different about . 4415665_4417065
&~s &~f FADH is &~fla &~f +/. 4420485_4420665

how do I make it ? 4431005_4431705

no . 4456225_4456805
shouldn't they be charged (be)cause they can move inside the cell ? 4457485_4460165
