was it easy to color the other side . 540_2270
what was it . 2750_4059
easy to color the other side . 4080_5550
yeah . 6440_6590
how did you do that . 6980_7700
I it just kind of looks goes in . 9080_13210
how did you find out what colors to use on the other side . 18500_21310
&-um just just go in here . 22540_28670
please . 40200_40550
what a surprise . 41990_42740
&-um <they had> they had many fewer troubles . 43700_46420
I mean that counting of not counting Brian &-um they had very few
and I guess it shouldn't surprise me that Alex's didn't turn out
and then he has to start over . 62760_63950
but those are the only two instances I've sp . 64739_67060
oh I &-um Amanda messed up on her second one . 67300_70750
and she noticed right away that she goes . 70800_72050
oh I'm not gonna only use this one . 72370_73580
so and she caught after just going in two spaces . 74180_76380
not like having the completed project and not not being able to
so really they did handle this &-um much more easily than lots_of
no you should have been here other years . 89080_90070
it's usually &-um five or six turns over for some of them . 90120_94180
so something about this group's ability to visualize and think in
they they are doing better than groups have in other years . 106580_110590
and I can't put my finger on exactly what that is . 110940_113350
and maybe they've just done more visual spatial kinds of things or
I dunno . 119680_119990
we'll have to &-uh see how that happens . 120040_121830
but no this went fairly smoothly . 121980_123540
and maybe it's because they did more talking ahead of time about
be able to touch or you know they seem to have grasping before they
don't occur to them until they're in the midst of the project . 141090_143450
and maybe I did more prepping of that . 144180_145640
'cause I know how hard it is . 146260_146790
I was like . 147000_147260
no you can't just do all four flip it over and do all four again .
but that made sense to this group too . 151270_152820
they didn't just go you can't you know I mean they were like . 152880_155700
oh of_course you couldn't that would have the yellow up here . 156100_158910
so yeah we're &-um yeah we have to do reading things this afternoon
but as they finish their reading work they'll just go back to this
and then we'll &-um tomorrow during class time we'll be using those
oh that's okay . 191620_192060
