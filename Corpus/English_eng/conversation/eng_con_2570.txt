they're gonna be posted on the Internet but like not until Monday or something like that +/. 5565_9165
really ?
+, so I figured ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 9565_9965
⌊ when's the test ⌋ ?
this &~Thurs two weeks from next xxx .
⌈ yeah it's like a one to four ratio ⌉ .
⌊ it's gonna snow hell of a ratio Jesus ⌋ .
⌈ yeah xxx or so ⌉ . 10685_19485
&-um the exam'll be two Tuesdays from now . 20165_23525
⌊ and the review will be next +//. 23845_24985
⌋ .
⌈ <this &~Thurs> ⌉ two Thursdays ?
two Thursdays from now . 25965_26865
and the review will be this coming Wednesday . 26955_28555
and I I took a_lot_of your criticism about the last review to heart and I'm running it . 29555_34555
so don't worry about it okay ? 34735_35935
it'll be okay . 36115_36755
&-uh me me and Angie are running it . 37835_39495
wait is Wednesday the only review ? 40075_41335
Wednesday is the only review session but it's it's in class . 41495_44855
&~wh can you not make class ? 45035_45995
or what ? 46155_46315
oh in class . 46715_49055
it's in class just like last time yeah . 49075_50675
oh right +/.
+, so we're &~gonn we're gonna go over a_lot_of stuff and a_lot_of material . 51035_56935
try to help yall out a little bit .
instead of saying we can't answer that . 57155_60035
&-um okay so &=laughs +/. 60495_63915
shit +/.
+, let's start . 66255_66795
&=sighs this is the like such a cool thing if you have the right attitude about it alright ? 68875_72895
these the first thing to think about is that this is a mammalian brain . 74215_77375
and mammalian brains are fundamentally and structurally incredibly similar . 78275_84295
what you are about to see is in most ways that really matters not very much different from what you see in in human brains . 85435_92775
it's a_lot smaller and there's a_lot_of stuff that's less well &-uh developed . 92975_96755
but for the most part everything that's structured in this brain humans have as well . 97175_100255
they just have bigger or smaller versions of (th)em . 100675_102335
and one of the things that you're gonna wanna do is one of the &~things &~you you're I definitely want you to see is that the cortex itself in terms of its organization is pretty homogenous and not very interesting . 103235_112555
but on the other side of the cortex underneath the cortex there's all this cool stuff . 113195_118235
and that's really what you want to get at . 118615_120315
get at it from underneath the cortex . 120535_121915
things like the fornix right ? 122515_124115
which is attached to the cingulate gyrus or the corpus callosum which is here . 124295_128735
then goes underneath it's a myelinated sheath which seems to be involved in the organization of emotional patterns . 129245_134125
&-um midbrain structures like the hippocampus which if you guys can find is really really cool . 134325_141725
I'll give ya +//. 142065_142425
I'll &~hel I'll try to help you find it but it's organized basically underneath the temporal lobe which is here . 142605_147705
okay ? 148145_148265
these are all not cortical they're underneath the cortex . 148845_150845
so after you do the work that's in here think about the the the &-uh midbrain and the hindbrain structures . 151035_157315
and then all the stuff that's happening in the brain stem like the pons@s:lat . 157995_162715
&-um the thalamus should be very easy to find . 162715_165315
so will the inferior and superior colliculi okay ? 165715_167875
they're they're actually very very obvious . 168195_169755
and the the cerebellum . 170675_172035
what I would recommend you do is take half your &~bra you &~go you got two halves of your brain right ? 172595_178715
take half your brain and take it through that step by step process that's on the sheet in front of you . 178845_184345
and that will take you all the way to &-uh pretty much like basically early subcortical examination . 184765_190665
take the other half of your brain and dig around . 191325_194065
try to find the stuff that <that you> that you think might actually be very very interesting that's actually in the book . 194985_199885
and in particular think about it in in terms of this context . 200365_202945
the cortex itself is really only about an eighth of an inch thick . 203125_205885
okay ? 206595_206835
everything underneath the cortex is &-uh connections to other cortical areas and midbrain hindbrain areas . 206935_213195
so the things that you find underneath the cortex really will tell you a whole lot about how the brain's put together and how it works . 214155_218555
wow . 219295_219535
okay . 220315_220875
it's gonna hafta be four to a brain . 221835_223055
dissection sheets are over here . 224295_225835
alright .
okay . 228155_228795
we we've procured some incredibly high technology &=laughs:S5 plastic knives nice . 231985_238445
+, no way +/.
+, okay gloves are over here . 239965_247465
okay we have some like really high tech instruments designed to cut your brains up alright ? 249445_254605
we also have some metal &~spat metal spatulas it doesn't matter . 254845_258585
as a matter of fact I recommend you use these because it it gives you a better cut and they're lighter . 258605_262905
it &~it &~it it's easier to control control the cut . 263585_265265
&-um these brains have been &-uh stored in formaldehyde so they're a_lot harder than they normally would be . 265745_271525
if you took a brain like this from a sheep you know if you were hunting down sheep one night and you caught a sheep and you pulled the brain out it would actually be very squishy and and very very &-uh easy to damage . 271605_281685
what happened with these is that they were put in formaldehyde and they were soaked so they've been basically hardened and solidified . 281915_287015
that being said it's a very soft tissue . 287515_288855
this is all you're gonna need . 289495_290275
okay ? 291115_291135
this is all you're gonna need . 291315_292055
you might wanna use two but you should be able to do everything you need to do with fingers . 292455_295795
and with with the butter knives . 296495_297515
so come on up grab yourself a &~ins implement of destruction . 297855_301575
we need tweezers ? 302915_303495
tweezers are cool for pulling away some of the smaller parts and everyone's &~in every group should try to have some . 303795_308975
huh ?
+, okay ?
now you go out and sell underwear again xxx .
&-um .
yeah I know .
okay +... 319715_319895
follow the basically follow the dissection process step by step . 323215_327915
I wanna reiterate this is a teaching technique this is a pedagogical method for you guys to learn where the parts of brain are . 328835_337195
I don't care what your brain looks like at the end of this . 337535_339455
&=laughs:SUm I heard some chemist was telling me some story about some pig that she was dissecting all semester and if she messed up the brain she got points off . 340115_345395
I don't care okay ? 345575_346875
what matters to me is that you use this to help you on the exam which comes in two weeks because I guarantee that there's gonna be anatomical questions on the exam in two weeks alright ? 347395_355535
just take my word for it . 355655_356655
just count on that . 356855_357335
so &-um have some fun with this use it to to find the parts that're in here and then dig around a little bit . 357955_364095
if you have questions about a particular &-uh organ or nucleus see if you can find it . 364355_368795
hey tell me about the pineal gland . 368915_370035
&~wh what exactly does the pineal gland what does ⌊ <what does the pineal gland do> ⌋ .
⌈ the pineal gland ⌉ . 370395_373375
I just noticed it .
it's right . 374015_375035
it's in the hindbrain +/. 375115_375875
yeah it's +/. 376175_376515
+, <or the> or the midbrain .
it's really hard to find . 377255_378375
but it didn't say anything about it in the book . 378475_379755
the pineal gland is it's really only interesting if you're into &-uh &-uh ⌊ <property dualism which is Cartesian> ⌋ . 380155_388475
⌈ I I don't ⌉ even know what that is .
&-uh <it's a> <it's a> it's a theory that that consciousness ⌊ xxx ⌋ . 389235_391435
⌈ <oh_my_god a> ⌉ yeah +/.
yeah +/.
+, why is it interesting if you you xxx .
well because Descartes thought that consciousness can't <do anything> . 391695_405095
well yeah that's what I mean +/.
yeah +/.
+, you ever see those old movies ?
+, ⌊ uhuh ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ xxx ⌉ what was that movie ?
The Eliminator ?
I think so ⌊ yeah ⌋ . 404845_405585
⌈ where the ⌉ guy's pineal gland like &=laughs:S1 ⌊ you know what I mean ⌋ ?
⌈ it's cracks me up ⌉ .
&-um one last thing . 406885_412665
is &~i are any of yall leaving before tomorrow ? 413625_416065
any of you guys going out &~go going out_of town for the weekend ? 416305_418485
possibly .
possibly . 419245_420185
is anybody else going out_of town for the weekend ? 420645_422125
alright . 422865_423705
<I wanna leave town for the weekend> .
+, &-um I didn't have I don't have your questions yet because of a photocopy snafu . 424565_428785
&=laughs:SUm I'll have (th)em by eight thirty tomorrow morning on the fourth floor outside my office . 428715_432975
mkay ?
they'll be in a box . 433435_434135
so that's why I'm just asking now . 435175_437315
otherwise just get (th)em you know get (th)em tomorrow .
good .
&=multiple_conversations_next_7:20_only_one_transcribed .
man I remember <seeing where you guys> xxx you know .
xxx specific one of these little curves ? 438395_449855
no . 450455_450775
this whole area ?
it's well like &-uh like &~front frontal lobe I ⌊ guess ⌋ +/. 451915_455195
⌈ this whole area ⌉ ?
+, frontal lobe . 456235_456895
(be)cause then we can point to like a specific thing you know ? 456975_461155
like <temporal is> temporal is &-uh right here +/. 461455_465335
right +/.

where the differentiation is at . 465895_470955
+, right ⌊ occipital xxx ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ and the ⌉ occipital is yeah that's the &-uh .
somewhere up here .
that's the cerebellum +/.
yeah ⌊ somewhere ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ xxx ⌉ so &~it it's in the back correct ?
and then parielesum@n up here ?
right .
and parietal up on top .
honestly yeah I don't remember her showing us I think she said it was really sketchy you know sort_of between where exactly between like &-uh you know parietal ends and the frontal starts .
so +...
alright .
trying to find the central sulcus ⌊ xxx precentral and postcentral ⌋ .
⌈ look at the eyes ?
xxx ⌉ those are the eyes you think ?
&-uh it's possible .
whoa it's freaky .
<I thought there> was only one optic nerve that comes into the brain <maybe these things start here> ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ when's a xxx ⌉ this seems like it's the spinal cord ?
&-uh this is the medulla ?
medulla and then coming up with this here the spinal cord . 531845_531925
right +/.

I guess this would would be the pons@s:lat somewhere here ?
right right +/.
+, cerebellum &-uh +...
you know where the central sulcus is ?
right there .
yep .
pre and postcentral gyri ?
I don't even see where that is . 535785_545525
this this alright .
nah know where you know where the central &=laughs:multiple . 545845_549445
we should <be able to see> it a_lot better if we .
cut it open ?
⌊ oh yeah it's a ⌋ . 550045_556605
⌈ I didn't quite ⌉ make it though ⌊ tried to bring ⌋ +/.
⌈ we should &-uh ⌉ +/. 558425_558685
+, her over so it'd be veteran service .
well okay so we got the xxx central sulcus . 558685_562845
the precentral or postcentral gyri &~gla no that's an external ?
or .
it look &~li it looks like a xxx <and &-uh> .
I thought that was a internal too like around a &~ling like here's a a gyri postcentral gyrus there ⌊ xxx ⌋ +/.
+, no doubt this is like eighth grade . 578745_580105
alright &-um +...
olfactory and optic nerves .
olfactory looks like . 580805_590665
this is removed where it says removed I don't know if that's a diagram of what we were supposed to be looking at . 591525_596185
hey Dan . 597045_597465
yeah .
&~o is the olfactory bulb in this or not ? 597565_600705
⌊ is this it right here ⌋ ? 601405_602085
⌈ &-um ⌉ it's doubtful .
doubtful ? 602105_603245
yeah . 603445_603625
(be)cause it says removed on this diagram . 603685_605145
yeah it's it's usually yanked off +/. 605345_608565
yeah ?
+, during dissection .
+, alright +/.
+, what you do what you should be able to find too is let me see well look at that . 609005_613185
maybe you guys do have that . 613425_614165
+, as in olfactory ?
+, that that looks like the olfactory bulb to me . 614465_616585
and what's the other one on +//. 616765_617565
the matching one on the other side ? 617945_618565
⌊ is that an optic nerve ⌋ ?
⌈ &-uh well there're there're ⌉ two of them . 618685_620725
right ? 621205_621225
there're two olfactory bulbs so there's one on each side . 621625_623425
oh really ?
+, yeah . 623565_623705
and here's &-uh now here's here's a thinker for you Rick . 623965_626785
the olfactory bulb . 627085_627925
you know the optic chiasm is a crossover right ? 628225_630505
and what's happening there is that basically in the &-uh the reason for that is because you know right hemisphere controls left side of brain +/. 631145_636945
+, yeah right +/.
+, olfactory systems are not like that . 637645_639245
olfactory systems are what you call ipsilateral . 639845_641785
+, yeah yeah +/.
+, this is contralateral . 642425_643385
+, right +/.
+, ipsilateral .
and so when you see this you see the way it kinda goes with the brain there . 643845_647705
I have a question when when you're looking for the occipital lobes . 648205_652305
uhuh +/.
+, does it matter when you look at the frontal lobe . 652425_654745
is it just an area ? 655085_656165
⌊ or is it like ⌋ .
⌈ it's just it's area ⌉ I mean it's supposed ⌊ be divided into central sulcus ⌋ . 656385_660285
⌈ <(be)cause they always in all the diagrams they always> point to ⌉ a specific area . 658875_661995
yeah I mean it's hard to find . 662215_663335
like the central sulcus is supposed to be right about here . 663555_666055
actually you can see ⌊ it on this one really nice ⌋ . 666535_668015
⌈ and the sulcus ⌉ that's like another just word for what ? 668015_669615
like a ⌊ canal basically it's not a structure it's just a differentiated ⌋ . 669775_671755
⌈ sulcus means yeah sulcus <is a> is a &-um is ⌉ is a is like a value . 671755_675135
right okay +/. 675475_675855
+, yeah and and so here's your central sulcus . 675915_677935
here's your frontal lobe there's your parietal lobe and there's your occipital lobe back here . 678155_682515
so this division here should tell you what you're xxx . 682775_685115
and temporal temporal parietal that difference is there something ⌊ that separates those two ⌋ ? 685965_689565
⌈ temporal lobe ⌉ is is sort_of yeah temporal lobe is sort_of hard to find on sheep . 689565_692545
but it's folded under +/. 692545_694065
yeah +/.
+, the way you think about it . 694545_695325
think about the brain as a fist +/. 695385_696525
+, right +/. 696805_696945
+, and the thumb <is the> is the temporal lobe +/. 697145_698865
+, right +/.
+, and then you have your occipital lobe here . 698905_700925
and the frontal lobe . 701225_701825
so . 701865_702045
the temporal lobe sort_of folds underneath from the other cortex . 702385_705285
+, right .
+, xxx .
now now where's the optic nerve on there ?
and you guys it's really hard to find on this but it would be here . 705585_712005
that far back ?
well it kind of goes it it &~shou this is part of it right there . 714315_718875
<this is> this is actually a sheep brain right ? 719955_722035
that's actually a sheep brain . 722215_723095
and so this is a really good way to tell you where it would be . 723695_725575
<I don't even> I don't even see . 725815_726855
I see &~op optic chiasm optic tract . 726995_729295
yeah the optic tract is here . 729495_731375
and what would happen is &~you you would see a crossover . 731695_733715
some of the crossovers are more clear than others . 734095_735735
but that's like this is the superior colliculus and so it's going right into the superior colliculus from there . 735835_740735
this one's not . 741715_742395
this one's been beaten up .
&~we we'll try to +//. 744415_745855
<if you> if you guys can't find certain organs wander around a little bit and see if you can find them . 746075_749295
alright .
xxx pons@s:lat and medulla xxx .
&-uh this would be xxx see it looks like the pondula@u pulled it out +/.
yeah +/.
+, and this would be the pons@s:lat and this would be the medulla .
I mean this &~wo .
well I think that little thing that we tore down xxx +/. 750235_765655
okay +/.
+, would be the pons@s:lat . 765655_767355

some of you are are taking the phrase gently separate a little too far and pulling it to the point where I've already seen two groups rip their corpus callosum alright ? 1211695_1220215

the the gyrus ?
what do we do ?

look at this little guy .
it's like a little like separate structure right here .

yeah xxx .
nah not exactly no .
actually I got the hole here <now I actually got> xxx I don't know do we have it there ? 1276375_1284335
<you got> you got some stringy stuff coming off comes off of the &-uh pons@s:lat <and the> medulla .

lemme see it . 1297785_1298265
let's see .
we're assuming .
&=laughs:multiple .
&{l=READING pineal gland is located <behind the thalamus> &}l=READING +/.
⌈ there it is ⌉ +/. 1299005_1303905

+, and we're thinking that's the superior colliculus right there . 1305545_1307565
one of the best ways ⌈ to see the superior colliculus is ⌉ . 1307985_1309865
⌊ it starts a separate body completely ⌋ .
yeah you &~got you gotta really gotta get in there . 1310405_1313365
after you do each analysis +/. 1313525_1314845
mhm +/.
+, cut this area away and and cut away the cortex and then you're gonna see the superior colliculus more easily . 1315425_1320845
<I got> I got a nerve coming out ⌈ right there ⌉ .
⌊ uhuh uhuh ⌋ that's one of the cranial nerves .
⌈ it's <part of the> ⌉ .
⌊ xxx the hypothalamus ⌋ .
the hypothalamus ? 1321185_1326745
yeah .
well the thalamus is +/. 1326785_1328825
this thing right here +/.
+, this large object right here so the hypothalamus is sort_of a broad structure . 1330085_1332585
you can see hey look here .
should say it right here .
<it doesn't> <isn't that the hypothalamus> the hypothalamus is sort_of it sorta holds the thalamus underneath right there . 1344855_1346015
so it's not +//. 1346655_1346935
<it's kinda> it's kinda hard to see as a differentiated object +/. 1347455_1349235

like on on this half it'd be &-uh +/.
lemme +/.

<I guess let's see> ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ yeah <there's your> there's your thalamus there . 1349715_1359015
the hypothalamus must be that ⌈ coming in ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ it's not a connecting area xxx . 1359515_1362095
<what do you> what do you what do you guys think well maybe this is a hypothalamus it's like a separate sort_of structure . 1362275_1365955
⌈ that &-uh ⌉ +/. 1366155_1366935
⌊ or ⌋ +/.

so the optic tract is there's an optic nerve where ? 1381575_1384515

this is the optic this is the optic nerve . 1385235_1386875

last question . 1388935_1391275
yeah +/. 1391655_1391795
+, this part right there . 1392635_1393175
this area here ? 1393315_1394835
&-uh yeah xxx .
okay so this is gonna be when you pull this over that's your superior colliculus . 1395275_1400935
it's just you can't see it very well (be)cause it's hidden by cortex . 1401195_1403395
oh okay so that's what you were saying . 1403495_1404535
yeah so after you guys do some xxx one thing you can do is you can actually do a a horizontal slice this way and sort_of see &~wha actually no one's ever done that . 1405115_1412815
xxx do the horizontal slice this way . 1412975_1414315
and you .
can we &-uh xxx the cortex ?
yeah because what's happening is that the cortex is hiding xxx some meninges . 1415055_1420155
the cortex is hiding all this cool stuff . 1420475_1422475
right +/.
+, so if you can peel away the cortex a_lot_of you will just &=sound_effect pull it away you'll see a_lot more . 1422715_1427475
now would this lemme &~a lemme get two more questions here we got a &~gra some gray material right there . 1428525_1432025
that's meninges . 1432285_1433385
that's &-uh just &-um +/. 1433725_1435025

that looks like okay . 1853005_1854825
here's your superior colliculus . 1855385_1857425

⌈ this is the ⌉ cerebellum . 1863155_1864155

right . 1864835_1865015
now imagine like with humans it would look like this right ? 1865195_1867795
which is why we &~w &~w confused &~wi with animals yeah it's like straight back so this is superior inferior colliculi . 1868015_1874195
now what you're supposed to be able to do if you cut right through the middle of this is find the Substantia_Nigra but I I haven't found <anybody can> do it . 1874455_1881435
&-um okay &=laughs:S8 you can do it alright . 1881575_1884515
so &~th this is a good example . 1884975_1886235
you see that the thalamus which was here right ? 1886205_1890085
and then the hypothalamus was here . 1890485_1892345
and then you have this +//. 1892545_1893065
this is &~real I have no idea what exactly this object right here is . 1893265_1897005
red stuff ?

this is really tough (be)cause it's hypolaminated@n$part but if you pull this away you get you see this ? 1908315_1915075
you see all the you see the little stripes the little lines there ? 1915215_1917915
+, yeah xxx +/.
+, that is all fibers . 1918815_1920415
that's all nerve fibers . 1920595_1921295
I don't know what that is . 1922175_1923195
&-um <I think> I think it's like basically I mean this may actually be a thalamus and this may be the hypothalamus and in which case you know like all this crap we've been doing before is is wrong I've been told wrong all these years . 1923955_1935495
it makes more sense because this is a big old object that has a whole lot of nerve fibers extending from it and there's a smaller object beneath it . 1935865_1941905
but whatever it is it's really interesting because of <all the> &-uh all the ⌊ nerve fibers ⌋ +/. 1942545_1947265

and then <what else> what else we got here ? 1952085_1954585

okay you see this little lump here ? 1994345_1995685
if if I understand correctly if I remember correctly this would actually go into the temporal lobe (be)cause this looks like a temporal lobe &~project so when you cut this one open be a little more careful . 1996425_2005425
try to separate try to cut off the top of the cortex . 2005665_2008425

no that's &~no .
no the the pull it back +/. 2024075_2025695
mhm +/.

+, looks like a little knob xxx like this right here . 2029455_2031335
<I don't> I don't know . 2031455_2032335
I don't know what that is . 2032695_2033515
this is &-um this part right here is interesting because there is the fornix . 2033715_2038775
you see that ? 2039475_2040315
you see this right here ? 2040495_2041375
this is the fornix and if you pull this away +/. 2042135_2043795
peel it ?
+, yeah if you peel it away really gently . 2044475_2047935
underneath that ?
ooh .
look at that . 2048695_2050295
the stringy &-uh ?
yeah it it's really interesting isn't it ? 2050895_2053315
and and underneath that on this side should be +/. 2053355_2056055
+, the hippocampus . 2057175_2057795
yeah I know be careful with that all the &=laughs:SUm crap that's coming outta here . 2058015_2060255
but this this curves around like that and then where's the am I doing this the right way ? 2060635_2064815
oh okay . 2065035_2065435
so this is frontal and this is okay . 2065595_2067395
and this +//. 2067635_2069575
what happened here is that underneath this kinda nestled in there should be the hippocampus and in the temporal lobe right in here should be the amygdala .
so if you pull the fornix away and you &~pu there's another layer of fornix here if you pull that away you should find the hippocampus sort_of nestled in the cortex +/. 2077755_2084435
+, mkay +/.
