you better get there uh an hour and a half to two hours early . 160737_162987
yeah and that's for domestic flight . 162987_164355
two hours early if you're flying international . 164355_166891
San Jose international has just announced . 166891_169407
it has increased security measures . 169407_171090
as SFO did yesterday, +. 171090_173192
and that we they remind us we remember now if you're flying from
things are gonna be a lot different . 178263_179379
starting right now . 179379_180529
no curbside check-in for baggage h . 180529_182195
SFO and well San Jose International's observation decks have been
only ticketed passengers . 187849_189199
will be allowed through security checkpoints . 189199_190884
and airport officials are asking people not to have family members
come into the terminal with them at all . 195169_196954
they prefer . 196954_197654
and noone gets past the security . 197654_199638
<don't leave your bags unattended> . 199638_202373
they will be taken away . 202373_204358
and uh this has been stressed repeatedly hhh . 204358_207060
if you uh go get a snack and leave your bag . 207060_210195
it'll not only be taken away but destroyed . 210195_212297
yeah . 212297_212813

I guess the fear is that if Saddam Hussein cannot strike back at
then terrorism is the only thing left . 217784_219800
we asked San Francisco Major Ron Agnes about that earlier today . 219800_223236
if the playoff would be affected this weekend . 223236_226954
and he said he hasn't been approached about it yet . 226954_229890
well I don't I hope we don't start a panic . 229890_233342
and I do think that these security measures are certainly . 233342_235560
well worth taking . 235560_236944
but let's remember there hasn't been an act of terrorrism ⌈in seven
⌊yo yeah you're right⌋ . 241329_242162
and these ⌈airports⌉ . 242162_242829
⌊and it's purely precautionary ⌋ . 242829_243629
and these are travel advisories to let you know . 243629_245697
to come early and if you bring carry+on baggage it's gonna be
don't leave it ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 249666_250268
