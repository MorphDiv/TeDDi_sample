mod three forty four .
and then two to the one seventy is congruent to one mod three forty one just xxx .
that it .
two to the thirty forty is congruent to one mod three forty one .
so how can you use this to to prove that three forty one is composite but how can you use it to to actually factor the number three forty one ?
any &~volun any volunteers ?
okay .
anyone get this problem ?
&=laughs:multiple Kurt ?
I can tell you &-uh how how &~y how we know it's composite .
so how do you know it's composite ?
well there's a theorem that says &-um that M is &-uh given M prime .
yeah .
x@l squared is congruent to &-uh +...
one .
&=writes:board:S1 .
x@l squared is congruent to one .
mod M &-uh if and only if X is &~cong X equals or X is congruent to plus or minus one +...
mod M .
&=pause_while_writing .
yes so if M is a prime number then +...
thirty two squared cannot be congruent to one mod M .
and now &~wh what was the proof of this ?
and and this was one of the homework problems .
of_course you get that M divides x@l squared minus one which is X minus one times X plus one +...
so if M is prime then M must divide either X minus one or X plus one .
<then two to &~th> two to the one seventieth is not congruent to one mod &~thir three forty one +..?
it is .
oh ⌈ it is ⌉ ?
⌊ it is ⌋ congruent to one ⌈ mod &~thr ⌉ .
⌊ it is ⌋ ?
yeah .
but &~t what's two to the one seventy ?
it's two to the eighty five to the square .
right .
⌈ so ⌉ .
⌊ so ⌋ so here what we get is that thirty two squared is congruent to one mod three forty one +...
but thirty three is not congruent to one or negative one mod three forty one .
three forty one cannot be prime .
okay (be)cause I oops (be)cause alright (be)cause it couldn't you use that same theorem &-um since we were given that two to the thirty fortieth is congruent to one mod three forty one ?
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ since &~two to the ⌋ thirty forty's congruent to one mod three forty one &-uh that's not that in itself doesn't show that three forty one is composite .
no I okay I I'm sorry I just I used the same theorem that you used to disprove it &~t &-um from what I thought was to prove it that it was a SPSP +...
⌈ I don't know whatever I ⌉ .
⌊ well what do you &~t ⌋ it is not an SPSP because +/.
+, ⌊ because ⌋ it fails the test .
but +/.
+, ⌈ I &~d I just was xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but what &~d that's the ⌋ that's method that's the that's exactly ⌈ what the method you ⌉ .
⌊ but I used the same method ⌋ though +/.
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but ⌋ a step up with two to the thirty forty as +/.
+, ⌈ oh but oh okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <the square that I used> and then I squared that ⌋ and I got one to the three so I mean that's what (0.5) .
oops .
I +...
&=begin_background_student_conversation I'm not sure if I understand what you say so you're saying &~y you went from two to the one seventy to two to the thirty forty ?
yeah (be)cause .
yeah but yeah .
so then then the test is &{l=SIC undecisive &}l=SIC but there's then this other pair then you go from two to the eighty five to &~two to the one seventy and that's ⌈ when the test is decisive that's ⌉ &=mumbling_becomes_intelligible +/.
⌊ oh X not x@l squared ⌋ +/.
+, when the test is decisive it it it comes up with something whose square is one but the thing itself is not congruent to plus or minus one .
now <how can you> how can you use this to factor three forty one ?
anyone ?
anyone got that ?
Phil ?
you know that the the theorem that &-uh the GCD between X minus one and M &=writes:board:S1 will be &-uh greater than one but less than M and that would be a factor of ⌈ M ⌉ .
⌊ that ⌋ that was +/.
yeah +/.
+, that was &-uh one of the homework problems .
but you can just so you can just quote it or if you want to work it out here this says that three forty one &=writes:board divides thirty two squared minus one +...
and this is easy to factor what's the factorization of thirty two squared minus one ?
thirty two plus one and thirty two minus one ?
yeah it's thirty two plus one +...
and thirty two minus one .
so we get thirty three times thirty one and three forty one divides that +...
so what are the possible factors of three forty one ?
&=unintelligible_answers:multiple .
what was it xxx .
three eleven and thirty one .
yeah .
and what's the actual factorization ?
two eleven .
eleven and thirty one it's not divisible by three &=pause_while_writing so three forty one is &-uh eleven times thirty one .
you can cancel out the three because three plus four plus one is eight it's not divisible by three .
(0.9) .
why do you have the three there ?
hm ?
xxx oh +/.
well it ⌈ it ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ oh okay never mind ⌋ +/.
+, it <does show> +/.
+, the factorization of xxx .
yeah what you get here is not +//.
so <you can put> <you can> you can conclude that the GCD of thirty one and M is less than M and greater than one and the GCD of thirty three and M is less than one and greater than M <if you wanna use> if you wanna use that homework problem .
so if you don't wanna if you don't actually wanna make this computation you can just quote the homework problem .
that's another way of getting the factors +...
&-uh first you get that the &~G the GCD of thirty one and three forty one +...
and then you get the GCD of thirty three and three forty one .
now what we're gonna do today is is what we started last time &-um and that's &-uh the multiplicative structure xxx multiplicative structure of of &-uh the +...
the numbers modulo M so &~wha &~thi what we can do then is pick a number A which is relatively prime to M +...
&=writes:board and we can ask the following question what's the smallest positive number such_that +...
A raised to that that power is gonna be congruent to one modulo M .
&=pause_while_writing there's there are certain numbers &-uh with this property for example phi of M &-uh +...
is one of them by Euler's theorem &-um so this A is just called &=pause_while_writing of A modulo M +...
so what we're going to start with is an example when the modulus is eleven &=pause_while_writing of all the possible powers that you can have +...
I'd like you to fill out these tables &=pause_while_distributing_tables so &~le let's do the first one together &-um (0.6) ⌈ do you have the ⌉ +/.
⌊ we need another one ⌋ .
+, you need one more ?
one more .
thanks .
so let's start with the first one if &-uh the powers of two mod eleven &-um <what's the> what's the first what's the first I such_that two to the I is congruent to one modulo eleven ?
well you have to go all the way up to ten we know by Euler's theorem that ten will work &-um well actually that's you know Fermat's theorem .
&=pause_while_writing a@l to the ten is gonna be congruent to one modulo eleven for any number A which is not divisible by eleven .
that's Fermat's theorem so +...
ten will always work but sometimes the order is not ten but something less but for two the order is ten &-uh what's the order of three ?
&-uh .
⌈ five ⌉ .
⌊ five ⌋ ?
okay .
&-um what's the order of four ?
&=unintelligible_answers:multiple .
it's still five .
what's the order of five ?
&=unintelligible_answers:multiple .
five .
what's the order of six ?
&=unintelligible_answers:multiple .
ten .
&-uh what's the order of seven ?
⌈ ten ⌉ .
⌊ ten ⌋ .
ten .
the order of eight ?
&=unintelligible_answers:multiple .
it's ten .
the order of nine ?
five ?
⌈ four ⌉ .
⌊ it's five ⌋ .
and what's the order of ten ?
&=unintelligible_answers:multiple .
how can you tell that without ever looking at this table that the order of ten is two ?
mod eleven .
hm ?
xxx .
&-uh the idea is that ten is congruent to negative one of_course negative one to the square is one so +...
the order of ten must be two +...
so what are the possible orders ?
the I didn't list the number one what's the order of the number one ?
one .
one .
one &=unintelligible_speech_and_laugh:SUm .
that's the only thing that's the only number whose order is one because the only number raised to the first power that will give you one is the number one .
what are if M is a prime number what are the numbers of order two ?
oh .
M minus one ?
M minus one .
<M minus one is> M minus one is always a number of order two &-uh is there any other number of order two mod &~a mod a prime ?
(0.6) .
one one will be won't it ?
one has order one .
oh xxx .
M is prime right ?
if M is prime there isn't why ?
because .
<because of> because of that .
if the order of of of the number is two then that number satisfies the equation x@l squared is congruent to one modulo M .
if M is a prime we have only two solutions plus one which has order one and minus one which has order two +...
okay so <if we> if we start to fill out this list the possible orders are one and there is only one number of order one .
then there's two is a possible order and the multiplicity's still one what are the other possible orders that show up ?
five .
five .
five and ten .
how many numbers are there with order five ?
four .
okay .
how many numbers +...
of order ten ?
four xxx .
alright so let's let's start to look for some factors .
so what are the possible orders ?
one two five and ten .
&-uh what does this suggest ?
that all numbers relatively prime to one .
what was that ?
all numbers relatively prime to one well that's &~a one's prime so &=laughs:multiple .
factors of +/.
Todd ?
+, N &~mi &~w .
factors of ?
N minus one ?
factors of N minus one .
factors of order .
factors of ?
of phi of M (0.5) .
why phi of M ?
I don't know &~i you know just thinking more xxx <more generally> factors of phi of M .
⌈ well &~w ⌉ .
⌊ xxx ⌋ divides the xxx .
okay so &~i if this data will will will not be enough to come up with with with with the right answer for sure but <we can> &~j we can we just try to make some conjectures and one conjecture was that the order +...
the possible orders that appear all divide M minus one .
&=pause_while_writing so it was ten for us +...
now +...
of_course ten is is special (be)cause any number to the power ten is congruent to one modulo eleven so +...
let's let's assume MM is prime .
&=pause_while_writing this conjecture makes some sense so every number raised to the power m@l minus one is congruent to one modulo M so we might think that the order will actually divide this number .
but what if M is not prime ?
how do you think this should be modified +...
this conjecture ?
(0.4) so m@l minus one was special ten was special because a@l to the ten is congruent to one for any number A that's relatively prime to eleven .
yeah +...
⌈ right ⌉ .
⌊ &~i &~i ⌋ if you don't start with a prime number +/.
shouldn't you just ?
+, how should we do you modify this theorem Buddy ?
well if M isn't prime then can't you have some numbers for which no order exists like &-uh two and four &-uh <I mean like there or > .
oh &~w the order always exists because I'm making the assumption that A is relatively prime to M .
other other course I I'd be in trouble Luke ?
couldn't we just change M minus one to phi of M ?
&-uh Richie ?
xxx let N be the factors of M +...
oh +/.
⌈ instead of M minus one ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so so &~y ⌋ you you so M you you replace M minus one by the factors of M ?
like +/.
⌈ <oh &~s> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ like it'd be anything divides &-um the factors of M minus one yeah .
okay so the product of phi minus one as phi divides M this <these are> these are all possible &-uh conjectures now let's just +...
&=erasing_board do some of them some computations &-um +...
&=writes:board so very trivial one where M is two what are the relatively prime numbers to two .
one .
one &=laughs:multiple .
what's the order of one ?
one .
one and it divides two minus one so +...
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ it ⌋ divides phi of two as well which is one so actually this is a more general conjecture +...
&=writes:board because it includes the the case when M is a prime phi of a prime number is just the prime number minus one .
now when M is three again just it's a trivial case because what are the relatively prime numbers to three ?
two one .
one and two .
one has order one and two has ?
two .
order two because two is congruent to negative one +...
&=writes:board now when M is four the numbers relatively prime to four are ?
one and three .
one and three &=pause_while_writing &-uh and they have orders ?
one and two .
one and two so &=pause_while_writing will not work because the only prime that divides M is two and this product will be just one .
two minus one is one .
so this one will will not work how about the phi of M formula ?
phi of M is two .
phi of four is two +...
&=writes:board so that that still works .
actually phi of M is very &~cl close &-uh to being this product if if &~y you recall what the formula for phi of M is so this is not that far from from the truth but +...
but you have to modify this this product formula because the actual truth is that it always divides it always divides phi of M .
and <you can> you can just check it with let's say M equals eight &-um the numbers that we have to check are one three five and seven what are the orders ?
(0.5) well one has order one what's the order of three ?
&-um two .
two .
two .
what's the order of five ?
two .
three .
it's still two .
and what's the order of seven ?
just two .
two xxx .
just two because it's negative one .
so here all the orders &=writes:board one two two and two still divide phi of eight which was four but +...
now it +//.
here's +//.
<there's a> there's a change here because four does not appear as an order .
so even though the orders will divide four but we but four itself is not an order .
now <let me make> let me make a a definition about &-uh this phenomenon +...
A will be called a primitive element &=pause_while_writing if its order is phi of M .
&=pause_while_writing if you fix the modulus (be)cause A could be a primitive element with respect to one modulus and not a primitive element with respect to another one .
so A is a primitive element mod M if the order of A &=writes:board is phi of M +...
so mod eleven we have plenty of primitive elements .
we have two and +...
six seven eight they are all primitive elements .
&=pause_while_writing what numbers +...
are are primitive roots .
what other what numbers other than two .
&=pause_while_writing so two itself is a primitive element .
what was the order of four +..?
five .
so it's not a primitive element .
what was the order of eight ?
ten .
so it's a primitive element .
what's the order of five ?
five .
it's not a primitive element .
the order of ten ?
ten .
it's not a primitive element .
the order of nine ?
five .
the order of seven ?
ten .
the order of &-uh +...
three ?
five .
five .
and the order of six ?
ten .
ten +...
so two eight seven and six are the primitive elements .
&-um I I +//.
my claim is that you could figure this one out from the indices .
so two is two raised to the first power eight is two raised to the third power seven is two raised to the seventh power and six is two raised to the ninth power .
so from the indices &-um what are those indices that that enter here ?
they're the numbers that are relatively prime <to ten> .
yes so one three seven and nine these are the numbers &=pause_while_writing that are relatively prime to ten .
(0.16) and and those are the only those are the only &-uh possible choices because if you pick an index which is not relatively prime to ten like let's say four &=pause_while_writing then it cannot be that its order is still ten .
why ?
because two &=pause_while_writing eleven .
so this number raised order to the fifth power is congruent to one mod eleven .
(0.16) &=erasing_board okay can you tell from this table what are those numbers &-uh that are congruent to a square modulo eleven ?
(0.6) four ?
is four congruent to a square mod eleven +..?
yes ?
yes it's congruent to two squared .
&=laughs:multiple .
five .
six .
five .
five .
why should five be congruent to a square ?
(be)cause four is even .
yeah .
so this is two to the fourth power which is two squared squared so this is a square same goes for six eight &-uh so what corresponds to them is nine and three .
so six is an even power eight is an even power +...
&-uh nine is a square and three is a square and of_course one is a square .
now what about the the odd exponents of can two be a square ?
(0.5) why not ?
(0.4) why cannot two be a square modulo eleven ?
(be)cause it's +...
<beyond two> if +//.
xxx it's gonna be odd .
if A was the square root of two then its order would be twice that of two ?
yeah if it +//.
what would be the order of of let's say two is the square of something A .
what would the order of A be ?
twenty .
twenty .
can the order of A <can any number> can any number have an order which is twenty mod eleven ?
no the order must be less than or equal to ten by Fermat's theorem .
so two cannot be two cannot be a square .
now how can you tell from two not being a square that you can cross out all the odd exponents +..?
so how can you know that eight cannot be a square then ?
(0.11) well what is +...
&=writes:board eight is two cubed which is two to the two times two this is a square &=gesturing_to_board if eight was a square mod eleven then two would turn out to be a square mod eleven .
and the same goes with two to the fifth so if we start with ten which is two to the fifth which is two to the fourth times two .
if ten was a square then because two to the fourth is a square two would turn out to be a square .
we know that two is not a square .
so what I'm using is that (0.8) that if if if I have an equation a@l squared is congruent to two b@l squared modulo eleven then I can take the multiplicative inverse of of this number B +...
oops multiplicative inverse of B +...
and then I would end up with an equation which says that two is a square .
it's it's impossible .
&=pause_while_looking_at_notes let me just &-uh tell you two more definitions .
I have a question about the +/.
⌈ yes ⌉ .
+, ⌊ primitive element definition ⌋ .
yes .
&-um if we're saying if the order of A is phi of M so then on your example mod eleven +/.
yeah +/.
+, why are we looking at phi of ten instead of phi of &~el the number of &~elemen if +...
the order of A we're looking at phi of ten instead of phi of eleven doesn't make sense to me ?
do you see what I'm saying ?
&-uh xxx not quite .
the so the order we're looking for &-uh numbers whose order is ten +...
so <we can> we can just go through this list ⌈ and figure out ⌉ .
⌊ I understood ⌋ all that it's the definition that doesn't make sense +...
I mean I understand that two to the fourth in the order of two is four mod eleven wait .
⌈ well the order of two ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <&~w &~w> wait now I'm getting ⌋ confused .
okay the order of something is the smallest positive power +/.
⌈ right so that it's congruent to one ⌉ .
+, ⌊ that you need to show that you get ⌋ one .
right .
and so the primitive elements &=pause_while_writing they turn out to be two and eight and seven .
six .
and six .
but if you well <I didn't use> I didn't use I didn't use the the tables but you could use the tables I mean you listed all the orders you can just check that these are the primitive elements .
and what I claimed is that +...
&=writes:board the indices to get these numbers <when you> <when you> when you look in the first table are one three &-uh seven and nine and these are numbers that are &~relat relatively prime to ten .
right .
but the the those are the indices .
so the point is it's kind_of &~li like a logarithm and we're gonna get back to this &-uh subject next time this is called a discrete logarithm .
so instead of working with the actual numbers I can go &-uh and work with the indices .
it's just like the indices tell me what number I have to use what I have to raise two to the third power to get eight .
I have to raise two to the ninth power to get six .
it's kind_of like a logarithm +...
and well I'm gonna explain it next time but but when you work with the indices with the indices you have to &~b what &~impor what's important is how do you relate to the number ten which was phi of eleven .
right .
+, when you work with the actual numbers what's important is &-uh what they are modulo eleven .
and when you work with the indexes what's important is what they are modulo ten xxx we will get back to this &-uh next time .
(0.6) and the two definitions I promised I I will tell you next time xxx run out_of time .
&-uh
