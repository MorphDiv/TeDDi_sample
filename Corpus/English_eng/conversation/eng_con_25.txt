about ten o'clock, it was a gentleman standing in the doorway of a
he had a cigar in his hand .
and a policeman came up .
and the gentleman said +"/.
+" policeman .
+" it's okay .
+" I'm just here waiting for my friend .
+" he said he would be here .
+" and I know that he will be here .
he said +"/.
+" twenty years ago that we would meet at the same place at ten
+" and I'm just looking forward to him coming .
the police officer then commented .
and then the gentleman mentioned that about eighteen years ago,
and now the restaurant is torn down .
that they would come back together .
and tell where they are in terms of their destiny .
and what they had done with their lives .
and he was looking forward to Bob coming back .
the police officer twiddled his baton .
and then he said +"/.
+" well, how much time are you going to give him ?
and he said +"/.
+" well I'm going to give him thirty minutes because I'm sure that
+" he will be here .
so the police officer, he said something .
and he walked away .
a few moments later, a tall man with a long trench coat walked
and he walked over to the gentleman .
and he said +"/.
+" Jimmy ?
and he said +"/.
+" Bob ?
and they looked at each other .
he looked at each other .
and they then expressed a few words .
and they then decided .
the taller gentleman, which I believe his name was Jimmy mentioned
they're sorry that the restaurant was torn down .
but that they would go around the corner .
and they could sit .
and talk about old times .
and they did .
but when they went there, the gentleman said, unfortunately, he
that for some reason, he wasn't the person because of some reason .
so he mentioned something about he was under arrest .
something about something happening in Chicago .
and he was not the person that, his friend .
and the reason was .
I'm really not sure .
but so it ends with him taking him to the police station, I believe
and said that he was under arrest for something he did in Chicago .
this story is about my twenty two year old daughter who graduated
and <when she left> <when she> after she +...
she went to the prom .
and after coming from the prom .
and coming home very early in the morning, her and another friend
and she was in a car accident .
and in the car accident, she broke her femur bone .
and Tiara was known to be called +"/.
+" too Hype .
which she was very very active .
she was a cheerleader .
a dancer .
and people just know her to be very very bubbly .
and so when she broke her femur bone, it really did put a damper
and in the manner in which people would expect her to because she
she broke her thigh bone .
but because of her tenaciousness .
and her perseverance .
it did not allow Tiara to hinder anything that she would have
so even though she did that, she went on to school .
and even prior to that, the principal said we're going to do
so they did make adequate preparations for her to come across the
so she still did pursue her career .
going on to Florida_A_and_M to college .
she was not able to do the things that she normally would have
and a dancer .
but as the years went on, she did start dancing .
and she did go out for cheerleading practice .
and so <she did> she did end up being a part of the dance company
so I'm real proud of Tiara because in this day and age, .
this is two thousand and three .
and she is about to graduate cum_laude .
I received the invitation just yesterday .
and it's just you_know I'm just proud to know that through her
she never gave up .
and she just persevered even more .
even though I know that she put her trust in the Lord, Jesus_Christ
I'm thankful for that .
to know that she's now walking .
and doing very well .
and she's going to go on to pursue her career .
