you'll note, &=breath all we have here is one cavalry unit . 82040_90770
&=breath they're pretty far away . 82040_90770
I mean, <we don't> hes@fp we d@i &=breath +//. 82040_90770
it is +//. 83010_83830

<I mean we wanna co@i> this is the situation as it is now . 108710_117810
<we also have in@i> hes@fp we have reports of what the

our readiness status ? 120090_124190
down here or or <up in the> up in the side here ? 120090_124190
oh, tho@i those guys are toast, down here . 123750_127660
&=laugh . 123750_127660
&=laugh I don't know if they're doing anything over here . 126600_130420
&=breath I mean hes@fp here, let us +//. 126600_130420
well, uh@fp <what is the> what is the +//. 128630_131110
I I'm worried about the end around that is doing an

<well let us> hes@fp <I would li@i> hes@fp well, <let us
right at the moment . 136820_143610
<you have to cut off> it is uh@fp best to cut off the
okay, well wh@i wh@i wh@i what is the date of
this is current . 147890_163550
this is as of two hours ago . 147890_163550
&=breath <and if you would like to see the whole> &=breath
&=breath play . 147890_163550
and now I +//. 151210_151960
mhm . 160360_161040
<and here is how> now you see they're just sort of moving
&=breath you know, but really, it seems like they're bringing down
&=breath here comes the cavalry down here . 167590_192180
&=breath and all of a sudden we've got this column that is sort of,
&=breath they've got a concentration of air defense here, and a
uh+huh . 170850_171820
mhm . 183280_183880
well +//. 191740_192070
so, it seems like we need to take out their air defense there, and
&=breath . 191840_196210
why do we care about the air defense ? 196170_197610
because if we mo@i +//. 197530_198970
well, what what is the range of the air defense ? 197660_199660
the range of the air defense ? 199790_202260
the firing range ? 199790_202260
&=throat . 199900_200800
yeah . 200830_201280
yeah . 201900_202530
yeah . 202040_202630
uh@fp straight up . 202130_204600
&=laugh . 202130_204600
give me the firing range for this unit . 204510_219740
&=breath show me the firing range for this unit . 204510_219740
&=breath show me the firing range . 204510_219740
oh, that is lovely . 204510_219740
who developed this uh@fp technology ? 222580_224460
yeah, it was me . 225240_226190
I I'm assuming that that those air defense units are
&=laugh . 226490_227530
well, let us see how that is . 231060_268460
&=breath place the air defense units in a table . 231060_268460
add the SAM units the to the table . 231060_268460
add firing range to the table . 231060_268460
so, this unit here, he has a firing range of sixty thousand
I'm guessing this is what this means . 231060_268460
&=breath uhm@fp so, you know, he can pretty much cover the whole
&=breath I mean th@i the only one that is limited it seems is
mhm . 256850_257350
mhm . 257380_258210
yeah . 261670_262160
well, right, right . 269140_271910
hes@fp he is probably attached to an armor unit . 269140_271910
uh@fp &=breath add affiliation to the table . 272550_283260
he is affiliated with the first division, which is
mhm . 283330_283900
I don't see any tack air support . 287750_289950
&=breath . 287750_289950
tack air support ? 290340_294120
meaning <what kind of> what kind of units are we talking about
uh@fp fixed wing . 293370_295690
just in general . 293640_294950
&=breath . 293640_294950
fixed wing ? 295720_299980
I mean, yeah . 295720_299980
<all we've> <all we've got is> we only have reports
&=breath . 295720_299980
no, what do we have . 300000_301380
oh, what do we have ? 301150_303830
&=breath you see what we have . 301150_303830
&=smack I don't see any tack air . 303880_305530
that is true . 306520_308070
we don't have any . 306520_308070
oh, then why are we worrying about air defense ? 307910_316520
<I'm worried about that ar@i> &=breath <artillery is the>
'cause that is +//. 307910_316520
that was his idea . 310120_311220
well, I I think we should worry about the uh@fp +//. 311020_313340
well, okay . 315270_319390
well, &=breath focus on the artillery units . 315270_319390
<the beha@i> the behavior of the air defense units . 315770_319680
okay . 315770_319680
you know . 321280_322190
so, here is all the artillery . 321710_327140
we've got one here . 321710_327140
&=breath one, two, three, four . 321710_327140
mhm . 324430_324950
yea . 324800_325510
so, hi@i hi@i his heaviest artillery concentration is on
and +//. 327400_331180
so +//. 327530_328050
yeah, his heaviest artillery concentration is on the left, but I
&=cough . 333360_335290
yeah . 335540_336020
definitely . 335830_336960
that <that is > depends on what he has got . 338380_342430
mhm . 340730_341360
what what do you wanna know ? 342710_344030

&=breath but I I I wonder . 408270_418680
I mean, they've been making noise over here the last six days, and
&=breath and it seems like they're they really want to move
&=throat . 411710_413240
oh . 415240_415940
yeah, that is what I had been saying . 418150_420400

&=laugh . 449950_452720
<no it is not in these> oh wait, yes . 450750_455150
&=breath place these units in a chart . 450750_455150
&=breath . 450750_455150

it could very well be . 498340_499410
okay, that is mecinf@n there, right ? 500430_502400
mechanized infantry . 502170_504300
