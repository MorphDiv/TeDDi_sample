good morning . 2355_2935
today we're going to be talking about polyprotic acids which are acids that have more than one easily ionizable hydrogen and among the most important of these are the amino acids . 3415_17015
which exist in proteins and peptides and so we're going move to those as soon as we cover some of the basics with some simpler polyprotic acids . 17835_29215
I have on the board acetic acid as the archetypal carboxylic acid and then I have two +... 30015_39675
diprotic acids succinic acid &=writing:board and adipic acid . 45735_53155
&=writing:board these are the common names for these dicarboxylic acids . 59195_63775
their scientific names are one two thirty four butane dioic acid and one two thirty four five six hexane dioic acid . 65105_78465
however they're usually called succinic acid and adipic acid so we'll stick with their common names . 79445_86145
now notice that we have two PKA values once we have two carboxylic acid groups and I've given the PKA values here and we want to compare them then to the PKA value of the single carboxylic group we have in acetic acid . 87885_104785
and you can see that of_course these two protons are equivalent and so the first ionization can be either one of those and so either one for the first ionization has the PKA value of four point two one . 106725_122585
but once I have removed one of the protons then the other proton becomes significantly less acidic . 123225_129645
and so we want to talk about first why the first proton is more acidic than the one in acetic acid and then secondly why does the it becomes so much harder to remove the second proton once we've removed the first one . 130765_147065
and I think you know the answers to both of those questions why is succinic acid more acidic in its first ionization than acetic acid ? 147605_157125
(0.4) .
resonance ?
hm ?
<isn't it resonance> ?
+, I just didn't hear . 164985_165785
is it resonance ? 166765_167685
well the resonance if I draw the structure of the anion in each case &=writing:board so this is the anion for acetic acid the acetate ion +... 168225_184485
and lemme draw the corresponding anion for succinic acid . 187305_193965
&=pauses and it wouldn't have mattered which of these protons I removed I have similar resonance in both of (th)em . 195005_206445
I can draw a resonance contributor in which I delocalize the charge to the other oxygen in either case . 207065_212265
so resonance is not the reason for the difference . 213025_216605
it's a good reason for why it's as acidic as it is but not for the difference . 217865_222445
(0.4) any other ideas ? 225665_226625
yep ?
you have <inductive and that's supposed to> take away the negative charge a little bit ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ and what is ⌋ the thing that's the &~indu doing the inductive effect ? 227185_233745
the oxygen atoms .
the other carboxylic acid group here . 235165_238125
okay ? 239385_239785
so I have the partially positive carbon these oxygens more electronegative than carbon and so I have an electron withdrawing effect through the bonds of one carboxylic acid group stabilizing the carboxylate anion in the other case . 240465_258985
so this base is weaker than the base in &~acetic acetate ion . 261385_269765
&=writing:board and where the base is weaker the corresponding conjugate acid is stronger . 271565_284945
well why is it so hard to remove the second proton ? 285965_288985
why does the PKA go up with the second one ? 291375_294775
(0.8) yep ? 296855_302755
because there's two negative charges after that ?
because I already have a negative charge in the molecule so let's just write a little equation for the removal of the second proton &=writing:board and I'm going to put the hydronium ion +... 304945_332505
that has resulted sort_of up there to remind us that we're trying to pull this positively charged species away from an ion that now is doubly negatively charged . 334345_346585
and so we have to exert more energy it is harder to do to remove that proton from something that is already negatively charged . 347545_357445
so the first proton is easier to remove than it was for acetate ion but the second proton is harder to remove . 359065_367325
now notice what happens with adipic acid . 368965_371665
the first proton is more like the proton in acetic acid in other words the PKA has gone up relative to the PKA of succinic acid for the first ionization but the PKA for the second ionization has gone down . 374285_394085
what's going on here ? 394865_395605
(0.13) .
the dipole is weaker when more carbon atoms xxx .
I have a &~l greater distance between the two carboxylic acid groups . 412385_417865
so my inductive effect if I ionize this one &=writing:board first the inductive effect of the second carboxylic acid group is weaker than it is in the case of succinic acid . 418485_437645
because inductive effect falls off with distance so with the greater distance between the two carboxylic acid groups I have less effect on &~sta the stabilization of the base resulting from the loss of the first proton . 438255_454395
what is also true then about the loss of the second proton ? 455035_458395
<negative charges> xxx .
again with negative charges are further apart from each_other and therefore it's not as hard to remove a proton from this end of the molecule when this end is negative as it was with succinic acid where the charges were closer together . 462395_478555
okay ? 479695_479755
any questions about what we've done so far ? 479995_482595
(0.5) okay I'd like to move on then to talk about amino acids as &~po polyprotic acids &=writing:board . 487055_494055
and the amino acids that we're gonna talk about are the alpha amino acids the amino acids that are found in peptides and proteins . 512285_519905
&=writing:board and they're interesting to us of_course because they are the components of the very important substances such as enzymes muscle tissue cellular tissues which are made up of proteins +... 539785_556045
there's alanine representative of a simple +... 558785_561845
amino acid +...
and I'm drawing it this way first to emphasize the fact that it is an alpha amino acid here it is the carboxylic acid group and the carbon adjacent to it will you remember we talked about is the alpha carbon and I've got an amino group on that alpha carbon so this is an alpha amino acid . 568985_590465
and it has two sites of &~aci possible acidity basicity &-um this is the carboxylic acid group and the PKA there if we compare it to acetic acid we would expect it to have a PKA of approximately four point eight . 591185_612525
&=writing:board and that is sort_of like ammonia ammoniamine methylammoniamine and that has a PKA we would expect of about nine point four . 634905_646905
so if we compare this these two structures we will see that the structure to the right is the one that we should be considering +... 648485_658385
because if we consider this as an equilibrium between two acids this is the stronger acid this is the weaker acid and the proton resides on the weaker acid . 660475_674535
and so we have an equilibrium where the proton is mostly on the nitrogen and only a little bit on the oxygen atom of the amino acid . 675655_686975
so the true structure of the amino acid is in this form where it is an internal salt the proton has been transferred from the oxygen to the nitrogen and we call that form the zwitterion . 689385_704265
the internal salt where we have the negative charge and the positive charge within the same species not two separate ions that can migrate apart from each_other . 705585_717045
(0.4) well let's write a series of equilibria for alanine &=writing:board that will exist at low PH . 721325_737805
where I have both of the basic sites in the molecule protonated &=writing:board so at low PH I will be protonated at the nitrogen and protonated at the oxygen . 739145_755585
but as I add base to the system +... 757645_759965
I will deprotonate &=writing:board and if we look up the actual PKA values of the two acidic protons here it turns out that this one is about two point thirty four and this one is nine point six nine . 763255_786635
okay so when I add base to the system which proton is going to leave first the one on oxygen or the one on nitrogen ? 788125_797165
&=unintelligible_answers .
the one on oxygen is gonna leave first . 798985_801205
so the first deprotonation of this polyprotic acid and this is why I'm calling it a polyprotic acid I've got two protons here that I can lose &=writing:board well the first ionization gives me that species and if I were to add acid to that it would go back to being this species here . 801445_831425
okay ?
so at low PH I have this at intermediate PH &=writing:board so I get to the form that I have at high PH . 834565_862825
&=writing:board let's take a moment to consider these two PKA values . 884875_888895
why is the carboxylic acid group in an amino acid more acidic than the one in acetic acid ? 890295_899055
(0.8) what's going on there ? 900395_906995
positive charge xxx increase xxx stabilize the xxx .
so I have the positive charge on this nitrogen exerting an inductive effect stabilizing the negative charge on the carboxylate anion . 912425_927245
okay ? 928505_928585
so that this is considerably more acidic than what we expected by just comparing it to acetic acid . 929405_938865
the amino group it depends on whether you compare it to ammonia ammonium ion which has a PKA of about nine point four or methylammonium ion which is about ten it lies somewhere in that range . 941425_956385
and you can argue two ways you can say well it's a little more basic than you expect these electrons are a little more available because they're close to a negative charge or you can argue well +... 957325_969325
you have the carboneal@n$adj group there still therefore it makes it a little more unavailable it lies right at the cusp of where you expect it to be and so it's a little hard to make an argument about that as well . 971945_986105
well we're interested in two numbers . 987025_992025
one of them is that for a technique that is very often used in analyzing for amino acids or peptides proteins and in separating them . 993705_1003685
and that's called electrophoresis where you put a substance on a gel and you put two electrodes on it and then you watch to see where the compound migrates in this electric field . 1004425_1018865
and there is a point at which no migration takes place . 1020465_1025985
and that PH is called the isoelectric point . 1027105_1030845
the point in &~whi at which the charges within the molecule are balanced so that it migrates neither to the positive electrode nor to the negative electrode . 1031845_1042485
&=writes:board so one value we're going to be interested in is PH for what we call the isoelectric point . 1043585_1052905
(0.15) the point at which (0.8) the amino acid (0.7) does not migrate (0.5) to either electrode (0.6) in an electric field . 1068025_1098005
(0.9) for example at low PH the amino acid has a net positive charge and therefore it will migrate to the negative electrode +... 1106225_1118425
and at high PH it has a net negative charge and therefore it will migrate to the positive electrode . 1120105_1129085
and I can manipulate the PH to do to make it do either one of those things . 1129705_1134085
but at this intermediate value whatever that is I have a situation where the charges are balanced within the same molecule and therefore the compound is stationary in an electric field . 1134465_1150965
this also happens to be the point at which the amino acid is least soluble . 1151825_1156085
so you can sometimes get it to precipitate from solution at this isoelectric point . 1156885_1161505
so that's another reason that we're interested in knowing what that isoelectric point is so that we can isolate a compound . 1161985_1169365
the other thing that we are really interested in especially when you get into biochemistry medicine is what is the form of the amino acid at physiological PH ? 1170945_1183645
what is the form in which it exists the cells and the tissues enzymes things like that ? 1185315_1191295
so that is the second PH value that we're gonna be interested in . 1191775_1195295
&=writing:board and for the sake of argument it varies from tissue to tissue but let's just take a PH of six point five as physiological PH . 1221265_1231765
okay +..? 1233345_1233365
well last time +... 1235965_1236585
we derived the equation for the acidity constant of a weak acid the KA and from that then &=writes:board by certain manipulations we arrived at the Henderson_Hasselbach equation which said that the PH was equal to the PKA (0.5) plus the log of the ratio of the concentration of the conjugate base of the acid +... 1239625_1269605
to the concentration of the conjugate acid itself . 1278225_1281225
(0.4) so this is a relationship that relates the PKA of the particular acid we're talking about to the PH of the solution . 1282025_1291485
&=writes:board and we went further and said that when at the special point at which we had an equal concentration of the conjugate base and the conjugate acid so when the concentration of the conjugate base equaled that of the conjugate acid then the log +... 1293245_1312925
this term the log of the concentration of the conjugate base over that of the conjugate acid was equal to zero +... 1316255_1325335
so that allows us to cancel out this term +... 1326795_1331255
and we have this one special point at which the PH of the solution is equal to the PKA of the acid that we're talking about . 1334925_1345245
okay ? 1345785_1346705
so now let's see what it looks like if we try to plot (0.6) what kinds of species we have at different PHs for &~ana for alanine xxx for the amino acid alanine . 1349205_1377425
&=writing:board and on this axis I'm going to plot the relative abundance of the different species there whether the concentration of the conjugate base or that of the acid . 1405645_1419125
so at some point I have &~hun a hundred percent of whichever species I'm talking about down here I have zero percent and in between that point I have equal amounts of the two species +... 1419965_1434605
so I start with alanine at low PH . 1437805_1440065
(0.6) and almost all of the species in solution are this form of alanine . 1446345_1455965
the +//. 1456545_1456605
form in which it has it's doubly protonated . 1457125_1459525
okay but as I add base the concentration of the acid falls HA falls and for every molecule of HA that is deprotonated I get one molecule of a@l minus formed so I have a loss of HA and a gain of a@l minus . 1461035_1486195
okay ? 1487035_1487935
and our equation tells us that at a PH value equal to the PKA value which is two point thirty four for the first proton that I'm taking off so somewhere around here +... 1489465_1505305
the concentration of a@l minus will equal the concentration of HA . 1509685_1514765
&=writing:board and then the concentration of HA will continue to decline . 1523265_1528565
&=writing:board and growing in then starting from almost zero I will begin to see the conjugate base forming . 1530485_1543725
and again at this point half of the species in solution will be that of the conjugate base . 1547505_1553745
&=writing:board then I continue to add more base . 1569425_1571265
I'm now at this point . 1571625_1572525
that's what we said at intermediate PH here . 1572985_1576125
and I continue to add base . 1577865_1579085
let me remind you that I can go this way too with acid . 1579285_1582045
I continue to add base . 1583185_1584765
and so at the PKA value corresponding to this proton which is the one I'm now going to remove at nine point six nine I again have a crossing point . 1586065_1597125
&=writing:board and the third species builds in . 1633425_1635645
and I'm deliberately drawing these longish tails to remind you that this doesn't happen all at once . 1638185_1645705
that all three of these things are really in equilibrium with each_other we're just talking about what predominates at any one PH . 1646165_1653885
and so somewhere around here we begin to see some of the third species coming in &=writing:board and at high PH then it becomes the predominant species . 1654785_1670925
so here &=writing:board this region we have predominantly that species +... 1672145_1684685
down here &=writing:board we have this species +... 1710635_1724515
now with this we can answer two questions one is what is the isoelectric point ? 1727115_1735375
and that is the point at which we have a +... 1737625_1742785
maximum for our +... 1745305_1748205
balanced ionic species the zwitterion . 1748885_1767605
&=writing:board which is actually if you wanna be more accurate the arithmetic mean of the two PKA values that border it . 1762415_1770935
okay ?
so if we took the arithmetic mean of two point thirty four and nine point six nine you would get the isoelectric point for alanine . 1773255_1786875
and the other question was what form does the amino acid exist in at physiological PH ? 1784905_1791085
and physiological PH we defined as six point five . 1791585_1795305
&=writing:board okay ? 1798465_1808605
so again the &~zwitter zwitterionic form exists at physiological PH +... 1810385_1815445
do you have any questions about what I've done so far ? 1816465_1820705
yeah ?
when you say physiological PH of the zwitterions ones what about the alpha classes of blue lines doesn't the &-uh basic form also exist ? 1821605_1831845
yes but the you know the blue is just beginning to grow in at those PHs there's very little of it . 1832625_1842205
so what is the predominant form there ? 1843105_1844985
that's what we're talking about . 1845145_1846345
and if I did it accurately if I calculated at every point what the concentrations were I may have exaggerated how early the blue really begins to appear . 1847545_1856525
but the point I'm really trying to make is that it doesn't suddenly become blue . 1857585_1861405
that there is some blue way back +... 1863245_1866105
any other questions ? 1868005_1869545
(0.5) okay well is this true of all amino acids ? 1872445_1877445
and the answer is no +... 1878125_1880265
alanine is what we call a neutral . 1883755_1885755
&=writing:board but other amino acids have additional amino groups called other basic groups or other acidic groups on the side chain . 1893355_1903315
and therefore they tend to be not just diprotic as alanine is but triprotic and so on . 1904305_1912725
so let's take a look at lysine &=writes:board &=pause as an important basic amino acid . 1912945_1921105
&=pause it's very often found in the active site of enzymes and so we're interested in knowing what form it exists in at &~thou those positions . 1926595_1936915
&=writes:board (0.4) so lysine has two amino groups . 1938495_1942875
one of them is at the alpha position (0.7) the other one is at the (0.4) epsilon position . 1943825_1958885
(0.9) so it is known as an epsilon amino acid as_well_as an alpha amino acid . 1968385_1974605
and here are my three acidic protons so I have three different PKA values for them this one is &=writes:board two point one eight +... 1975085_1985445
this one is eight point nine five (0.4) and this one is ten point five three . 1988555_1997495
okay ?
so this one is almost like methylamine this one is more acidic than &~en methylamine and this one is definitely more acidic than acetic acid . 2000455_2009035
so I've drawn the form that exists at low PH +... 2009995_2012435
and we can do the same thing we did with alanine add base and explore what happens at each stage . 2016385_2026065
so as I add base to the system I'm gonna lose one of these protons which one's gonna go first ? 2026645_2034265
&=unintelligible_answers .
the one on the carboxylic acid the one with the lowest PKA &=writing:board so I have an acid base equilibrium here as I add base I go to this form if I were to add acid I would go back that way this is at some intermediate PH . 2040865_2070845
&=writing:board but notice this is not the zwitterion . 2084665_2087065
this is not what exists at the isoelectric point because I have two positive charges and one negative charge . 2088785_2095845
so this is not balanced in its charge yet . 2096945_2099765
(0.9) but I can add some more base to it <set up> another equilibrium what's the next proton that's going to be removed ? 2107625_2117265
which nitrogen ? 2117445_2118145
the alpha nitrogen or the epsilon nitrogen ? 2118365_2121045
alpha +/.
+, the alpha nitrogen is going to be the one to go next . 2122805_2125025
&=writing:board notice that this is the zwitterion . 2147025_2149045
this is the form in which I have a balance of charges there . 2150785_2155165
&=writing:board and also presumably then the form that exists at the isoelectric point . 2157745_2168605
&=writing:board and this is the form that exists at high PH . 2219035_2222235
&=writing:board where I have removed all of the easily ionizable protons . 2222935_2233995
this is a triprotic acid and I have three ionizations for it . 2234375_2240615
well let's do the same thing we did for alanine draw a curve for this (0.23) so here are my axes again . 2241915_2271895
&=writing:board of relative abundancies on &~on abundances on one axis PH on the other . 2287185_2293345
&=writing:board okay ?
and once again I start with the most acidic form the one at low PH where everything is protonated and I have about a hundred percent of the specie@u up there but then very soon at a PH of two point one eight &=writing:board as I add base I have lost half of that species +... 2324345_2352205
it continues to die off as I add more and more base &=writing:board and a new species comes in . 2355505_2366325
&=writing:board so at that PH half of the &~s species in solution is this monodeprotonated form +... 2368025_2382785
which increases as I make the system more basic &=writing:board and a third species comes in crosses at that point +... 2385095_2401615
increases in concentration +... 2438085_2439645
then at the PKA corresponding to the ionization of this third proton in other words at ten point five three you see this happens very fast . 2442365_2455945
&=writing:board comes out . 2476655_2477315
now the structures are too big to write here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to label them this is structure A (0.4) this is structure B this is structure C +... 2478255_2497275
and this is structure D . 2498935_2500775
okay ? 2501555_2501575
so we have A predominating in this region +... 2502745_2506865
we have B predominating in this region here we are at C and we finally get to D . 2510205_2522905
so let's ask our two questions . 2524505_2526645
(0.5) what is the isoelectric point for this species ? 2530955_2535275
well the species that exists at the isoelectric point is C so our isoelectric point is here . 2536655_2547355
&=writing:board so it has a high &~i isoelectric point . 2562085_2564565
and what is the form that exists at physiological PH ? 2565385_2570245
now remember we defined that as six point five . 2572045_2574885
&=writing:board so which form is it ? 2581065_2589465
B is the species we have at physiological PH . 2593585_2597925
so at physiological PH +... 2598625_2600705
notice that the amino group at the epsilon position of the amino acid lysine is protonated . 2601745_2615085
in other words lysine is positively charged at physiological PH . 2615845_2620885
and this is significant . 2621565_2622745
for example in the structure of a protein to have the positive charge on one lysine molecule interacting in an ionic fashion with the negative charge of a carboxylic acid group somewhere else in the molecule . 2623105_2634845
so you have ionic intermolecular type of interactions nonbonding but still helping to shape the structure of the protein . 2635485_2646045
okay ? 2647025_2647205
so the overall shape of the protein is a multiple of these various interactions through the molecules you have a question ? 2647965_2655685
you said that the isoelectric point was also the arithmetic mean is that only for diprotic ? 2656005_2660845
no it's the arithmetic mean &=indicating_two_points_on_board . 2661225_2663505
oh just between those two . 2664765_2666325
between those two . 2666505_2667345
what is the HA and which +//. 2667505_2669565
what is the a@l minus for that particular range okay ? 2669825_2673345
any other questions about what I've done . 2675235_2676815
(0.6) okay next time we'll start talking about carbon acids and enolate ions and then move on to their reactions . 2677995_2705095
