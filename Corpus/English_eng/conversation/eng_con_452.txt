you adopted a horse do you ride ?
no only go up there to see it see them most of the time
down the stables I juʒə ride now and then .
you don't fall off ?
course you do fall off now and then !
then what happens ?
you go back on on again .
you don't break your leg or anything ?
since I've been there I haven't broke anything (ex)cept fallen
you're lucky !
how come you haven't ?
I think is someone up there kɑftə me .
what ?
I think is someone up there kɑftə me .
