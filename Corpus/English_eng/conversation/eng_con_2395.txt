lemme looks . 380_1310
like . 1460_1550
oh what_about the the rest of the matching slides . 1690_3740
yeah . 4080_4230
yeah yeah . 4280_4420
&-um . 9720_9780
don't use too technical vocabulary though . 13510_15330
the the audience might think you're talking down to them . 15980_18000
they all took like . 20320_21310
as as Tanvir . 21560_22370
they all should have taken like one twenty seven or two hundred
yeah two hundred . 28360_29110
you . 29220_29310
the most advanced part is stupid . 30140_31350
the bubble sword which is like . 31420_33100
no you can do it . 33260_33860
you can . 33880_34110
yeah . 34160_34270
talk about it . 34440_34730
yeah . 34870_35060
should we should . 35720_36060
we say like first this . 36330_37260
is not like g s I a class dude to where the professor gets . 37280_40420
talk what &-um . 41110_42070
&-um . 42660_42830
what attributes . 44110_44670
included it goes through . 45920_46750
three . 50230_50320
say something . 51070_51460
more . 51480_51570
three steps now three . 51730_52740
three three . 54040_54250
or two more complicated than bubbles for what say . 54370_58980
something that's more complicated than bubble sort . 59560_61300
makes it sound kind of simple . 61320_62330
it goes through a sorting method I know . 63560_64459
that's what it is actually . 64480_65410
but just make it sound a little . 65620_67260
more because bubble sounds stupid to me . 67280_69190
just say it goes through a sorting method . 70030_71190
no . 72360_72460
say you use bubble sort . 72590_73460
yeah . 73480_73670
yeah . 73750_73910
that's all . 74120_74730
it's a bubble bubble sort on a two dimensional array . 75280_76900
doesn't that make it sound kinda . 80160_81180
simple . 82760_82980
yeah . 84750_84820
you try and code that . 84840_85740
yeah I I mean . 86450_87230
coding wise . 87580_88150
it's difficult . 88510_88940
it's like annoying quoting wise . 89510_90820
it's difficult . 90870_91700
but what was I doing . 91940_93220
oh yeah . 93500_93590
three . 93890_93990
no . 94460_94630
is it two or three . 95380_95990
first it does the &-uh it does the personality type . 101810_107620
then it does the matching . 107720_108810
how_about in in this slide we talk about like what factors are
like . 117590_117680
well we first the matching function first has to get the function
what the first . 124010_124300
well right right . 124380_124840
right . 124860_125380
do so it's . 125600_126290
but like we could talk about we don't have to do it in order . 126520_129400
I just think it would be easier to explain . 130770_132190
like overall <we take> we take all of these factors into
and this is how we get one of them the personality type . 137800_140600
and like this is how we combine it all together . 140770_142970
so like slide one would be like . 144840_146210
you know we like the weights or whatever . 146970_150010
like how we affect . 150030_150900
like the attributes that we use in_order_to match you to your most
and like your I guess like your dating habits or whatever . 160450_162970
and then we talk about like this is how we calculate the next slide
this is how we calculate your personality type . 169200_170880
and then the slide after that this is how we combine everything
make the . 178330_178500
match . 178550_178760
I'm sure they're gonna want to know that value like . 178930_180250
