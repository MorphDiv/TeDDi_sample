that 's what I 'm saying Mark what no matter what the state of the
yeah but . 1363923_1364843
three or four times better than the civilian 's . 1365013_1367533
some of the guys out there you know the Russian people do n't want
no I mean its obvious that . 1381613_1383483
for for a start their tanks are still man powered their still tanks
no . 1387193_1387263
you know he he said he said he said there 's still some of the
still some of them . 1395483_1398253

but every front line regiment in the Germ in Germany had they were
Are you sure . 1407483_1408113
I should know I was I mean ask Mark you know how many people are
that 's what changed . 1425743_1427343
but they 've got so much there 's eight tanks or something to every
yeah so what . 1431343_1433163
seven combat planes . 1433213_1433733
you 've got to you you none none . 1433733_1435963
fucking fifty men . 1436033_1436683
none of their tanks have been tested really . 1436683_1438663

the than they went into Afghanistan . 1451443_1452633
you you are trying to determine gorilla war right but it does n't
yeah the cheaper being phased out . 1465093_1469443
yeah obviously they 're being phased out . 1469663_1476863
challenge for us the right . 1476863_1478723
yeah . 1479173_1479743
but on the other hand you 've got the T eighty eight the T seventy
yeah exactly . 1504463_1504783
and I think where they . 1504943_1507083
cos they . 1507083_1507463
population starts getting that desperate that 's the time when we
no . 1512323_1512513
the Russians are just just mad enough to fucking go for it . 1512513_1514583
no because they 'll do what they they 've always done there send
so what happened to all this Yeltsin thing right has has it been so
No I do n't think we have but I think they 'll probably be a Civil
well yeah now but you you were saying this we we had this
I I I do n't think that you . 1567333_1568813
Here you are . 1568813_1569473
we do n't really have anything to . 1569473_1574563
obviously we got to have fears because there 's something to be
lets face it if if Russia had wanted to declare war to declared war
we always did . 1614873_1615803
because they were scared . 1615803_1616243
just because . 1616243_1616653
they were just as scared of us as we are of them . 1616653_1621503
nuclear weapons . 1621503_1621883
yeah exactly but other its not just that . 1621933_1624823
if we if there was no nuclear weapons I reckon we would of probably
yeah that 's that is it that 's what I 've said er got there 's one
but all these talks all these talks . 1637283_1638183
I would never of er voted Labour . 1638213_1641513
yeah cos its not a union that . 1641513_1643763
it is n't the biggest deterrent in the world backed by . 1643763_1648703
But like I said Mark er the mil nato never used to think that they
You 're telling me that we 've got nothing to fear from them . 1660313_1667363
ah see this this is one of . 1667363_1668273
why has there been such a Star Wars plan Why has there been such a
you you keep ca n't actually tell until it does happen until
All I know is that there are better people in that are more
Fear against . 1701033_1701193
Fear against them I still would n't put it past them I 'm not
and you think part of the fear is er Russian causing the fear that
Yeah you 're going on as if you started off on the fact that you do
No I I just said do you think after . 1767903_1769283
Oh yeah yeah . 1769373_1770233
by the which was . 1770553_1771063

because one of state . 1771063_1772853
yeah I 'm saying it does yeah . 1772913_1775553
one minute shall forcibly put upon the world . 1775723_1779773
well yeah . 1780143_1780343
by force . 1780763_1780953
that 's why the the McCarthy witch hunt and stuff the hippies . 1780953_1782713
that there is that fear that is because that is the second World
0 .
if they were capital capitalist you would n't have a problem .
that 's why that 's ever since bolshevism first started in nineteen
yeah exactly but I think er . 1840203_1843133
but then again since up up until the mid forties we had nothing to
The Germans feared them . 1856063_1857333
yeah because they had that that 's why . 1857333_1860323
shear weight of numbers . 1860363_1861073
that 's why that 's why during the first World War Germany made a
yeah but shear weight of numbers like I mean America America and
Red army . 1875113_1880403
American and Britain are partly responsible for the way the
yeah that 's right but I mean what can you do I mean she was an
she wants the bear necessity . 1893713_1895003

All the reason that we have been against each other is because of

neutral wise yeah . 1914033_1914633
I was thinking venturialise as well I mean we ca n't we ca n't .
we hoped to we could n't never hoped to match them . 1938223_1946843
during the second World War one German found three hundred four
second World War . 1950783_1952523
yeah took them prisoner second single handed I mean . 1952723_1957713
After the second World War they did n't have a economy in the
the Russian have fucking one of the most powerful forces I mean up
They were wearing cardboard boots that froze in the winter . 1974523_1977973
yeah exactly . 1978123_1978933
Yeah . 1979023_1979083
but I mean up until Stalingrad that was it the the Russian army was
I ca n't see what the point is that was more than forty-five years
yeah what I 'm trying to say is that that the Germans on one German
what 's that got to do with modern day warfare and stuff . 1995883_2000823
well I do n't know . 2000913_2002313
its got nothing to do with it . 2002313_2003433
I know but what all going on is the history that fact is since the
yeah no no nobody knows how how they how they do things they 've
I I do n't know how they get there but they know how our army works
no I 'm saying that . 2038413_2038933

for a year or two years . 2044933_2047623
shear weight of numbers . 2047623_2048253
yeah . 2048253_2048413
that 's all nothing else . 2048413_2048983

if it was one on one we would n't have anything to do but it is the
yes yes that 's that 's one of the class of . 2065643_2068683
their their supply routes are n't as well defined as ours but they
yeah . 2094493_2094563
and this is why military strategies have always said we were gon na
