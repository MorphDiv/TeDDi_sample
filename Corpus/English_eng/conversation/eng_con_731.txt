there was a young boy called Peter who once had a frog and kept in
when Peter went to sleep the frog escaped .
in when he woke up in the morning it was gone .
good stuff .
&-um he searched everywhere , inside boots .
he looked out_of the window to see if it had jumped out .
but he couldn't see it anywhere .
the dog jumped out the window .
and Peter jumped out after it .
they left home and went to <look for the dog in> look for the
they searched in mole holes .
they searched up in the trees .
they started to head for the woods .
they looked inside every tree .
&-um they came across a bees' nest .
and the bees chased the dog right into the depths of the wood .
they searched behind the rocks , above the rocks .
and behind the rock was &-um a deer hiding .
&-um accidentally Peter &-er climbed onto the rock .
and the deer picked him up <by the head and> on his head .
and they were running through the woods when they came to the top
suddenly the deer stopped .
and Peter and the dog fell off the edge into the river .
Peter was soaked .
luckily the water was not very deep .
and they managed to grab onto a log and pull themselves to safety .
they looked behind the log only to find the frog and his family .
he he picked up the frog and took it back home .
