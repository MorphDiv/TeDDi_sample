shh ! 37831_38716
make sure that instead of watching them snap the Polydrons together
Nathan wants you to think about why he thinks a checker board might
+< because um because um if let's say there's a blue up here on
+< so you so you were thinking he's thinking about a
let's see . 82290_82710
oh can you click those back together ? 82710_84478

I'm just asking if +/. 120015_120741
no . 120741_121358
oh okay but you okay let's see an up down flip . 121358_125545
nope different . 125545_126495
it does look different . 126495_127835
yep she did but now when I do a sideways flip on this is it gonna
+< yes . 135190_135716
let's see . 135716_136885
yep . 136885_137668
because it got see these are the same as these as these and if
hmm but &~i &~i &~i I know you said to me but look diagonally these
+< I know ! 170913_171425
+< so it's (be)cause it has to kind of like a flip is sort of like
okay we didn't do a diagonal flip on any of these did we ? 180636_183246
but a diagonal flip it will be it doesn't look different because
well wait wait wait now you've um ah let's see uh we I this one we
okay now do whatever you want to it . 202413_204045
this is how it started do that diagonal flip again . 204045_206080
okay oh look it a diagonal flip made it look just like an up down
+^ let's put this one back to the beginning oh wait just a second
okay Brittany do a diagonal flip on it . 225576_227778
because +... 227778_228800
well oh wait was that a diagonal flip ? 228800_230893
yeah let's kind of +... 230893_231865
the red is going to be where that is . 231865_234263
oh ! 234263_235956
+< but it's not the same as this one the checker the checker board
okay so let's put this back and show what the up down flip looked
there we go so this is our up down flip and this is our um sideways
+< sideways flip . 267246_267863
and our diagonal flip we found out we'll do that again if you're
Sarah and Dani knock it off . 271766_274838
thank you . 274838_277746
that one uh it didn't fit our rule did it ? 277746_280581
hmm I wonder why that is . 280581_282005
I mean this one all the ways diagonal flip sideways flip up down
+< I knew it's not going to be the same because +/. 288538_290410
these two were though . 290410_291790
+< I know . 291790_292595
+< you mean you just knew that the diagonal flip wasn't gonna
yep right because these are gonna be right here these
diagonal flip this is how we started out but a diagonal flip is
+< okay do you see what she do you see what Nicole's trying to
she knew it wasn't going to end up with two greens diagonally from
+< xxx . 336310_337638
right when we did an up down flip it looked like that yep good
hmm what is it about this core square that you think makes it look
turning maybe no . 350555_353073
+< yes ! 353073_353318
+< um here this is how we started well we did it did look different
+< yes . 356100_356868
remember this is the starting if I turn this to the right a quarter
yes . 363273_365375
watch again watch again . 365375_367091
+< no ! 367091_367378
see where this yellow is ? 367378_368926
okay watch . 368926_370061
a quarter turn to the right . 370061_373713
+< it's the same . 373713_373908
+< same . 373908_374470
+< it's different . 374470_374988
+< it's the same . 374988_375836
+< but it's different . 375836_377020
I can't see . 377020_378608
it's the same . 378608_379376
Jillian pay look at what I'm calling the top now of the core
+^ now I'm gonna turn it a quarter to the right . 392465_394601
yellow green yellow green . 394601_396938
yeah but it's still the same +... 396938_398785
it's the same . 398785_399451
no oh no it's not the same as these ! 399451_401336
+< yeah that's what I meant . 401336_401350
+< she's talking about this though . 401350_402715
+< no I wanted to know if um if it if you could change this core
+< oh I thought oh I thought you meant if it's the same as that
oh nope good noticing though it didn't make it the same as the
I know . 415195_416028
that's why Nathan decided not to use it when he designed his two by
+^ this was the &~de core square he thought about using but when we
and you can see that from here . 438530_440413
Sarah and Dani go sit down at your seats and I'll see you at
okay um look at these are the only ways no matter what I do that he
he can get it to go together the two of them where you get two
+< can we try turning . 465713_466673
can we try turning to see if we're different yes we could . 466673_469066
this is how the core square began with +/. 469066_471485
a red . 471485_472485
yeah a red in the upper left . 472485_474323
then it's gonna be the same . 474323_476243
it's the same ! 476243_477440
because &~de +/. 477440_479306
now watch my upper left I know it's hard (be)cause you're sitting
this see where my finger is +//. 482480_483995
okay thanks . 483995_487246
um now watch so my upper left is different from you but watch that
it's different . 496006_497526
it is different because for this corner here instead of being red
+< this corner was < back here where > that green corner . 501645_503850
mhmm yep so a turn does change the way this one looks and a flip
yep it &~does +/. 521971_524000
+< this green corner would be here . 524000_525710
I know because they got it's it would be exactly the same . 525710_531345
with diagonal flips you're right . 531345_533946
+< I know because especially with the checker board because across
+< mhmm good job . 552860_554700
+< but if you if you could like a red here and two greens down
+< if you used more colors though +... 558071_558336
then it wouldn't work right . 558336_560120
+< yeah it when you do a diagonally flip um there xxx . 560120_564983
if if you just turn this one like that it'd make a like a +//. 564983_568066
