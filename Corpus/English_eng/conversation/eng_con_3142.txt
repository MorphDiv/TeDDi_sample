so let's see if we can rearrange score core to the same . 138140_141830
yeah . 154820_154910
because your be to rearrange arrangement is this the far which one
yeah if you flipped that . 197870_199020
but the way it is right now where these two point in that direction
and these two blue triangles point in that direction . 201840_204020
okay . 206580_206780
that's a way . 206800_207380

you started with we need some this is these right . 292560_296890
if there are some I was hoping everybody would be able to have one
show the three but you know some of the other ways that . 317960_322470
okay . 324450_324590
then don't worry about that . 324640_325520
your three two ways designs are more important . 325790_327990
you guys have to use circle . 342050_342910
don't click them together . 343050_343930
just lay them next_to each_other . 346630_347790
because they need to be able to move . 348850_350020
I need to see three different two by two designs . 350640_352860
oh wait you guys well you guys will have to show . 354980_356740
me two I think . 356760_357550
&-um . 357940_358010
Danny why are you laying those on top of that one like that . 359300_361320
okay . 363990_364230
<you guys> you guys have a blue triangle shortage . 364280_366260
are gonna have a problem making three but two different two by two
is that a two by two design . 373180_374110
that's . 375580_375800
a two by two design . 376280_377070
ooh . 377250_377310
that's kind of cool . 377360_377950
it's sort of stary looking sort of . 378110_380830
in an unusual it's spider spider on the spider . 380880_392380
a diamond in the middle . 393280_394430
well yeah . 399620_400180
you guys are only gonna a . 400310_401180

&-um this one . 413500_415740
&-um oh bounce outside green . 415980_417270
I think you wanted it all green in the center . 417560_419230
is there a way we can get it all green in the center . 419380_421200
and have red at the four corners . 421540_422950
you . 423740_423830

yeah . 455490_455620
you may snap it together . 455640_456740
the only . 457500_457760
oh no . 457920_458190
actually you may not you won't be able to this . 458520_461150
look if we clicked in the way that it would click together . 461270_463570
watch it change . 463970_464580
so we're just pushing (th)em together . 466320_467720

cool . 468520_469060
wait . 468910_469150
how can you be sure that this two design is different than they
how do you know . 478270_478590
this isn't easy to start . 478640_479480
easy . 480430_480560
they're &-um we squares are on the outside . 482250_487520
and ours are middle . 488540_489630
and they have square the square . 489940_494710
and we have our square . 495220_496500
okay . 499550_499820
