&~www .
there's a dog and a boy .
and they caught a frog in a glass .
and it's nighttime .
then they go to sleep .
and the frog jumps out_of the jar .
and when it's morning they looked and the frog has disappeared .
&-um they search everywhere in the room and out the window .
and the dog falls out the window .
and the boy picks him up .
and the dog licks him .
ah they call just from outside the forest .
&-um the boy looks in a hole .
and the dog jumps up a tree to the beehive .
and a mole comes out and gets the boy .
and the bees are chasing the dog .
and the boy looks in a tree .
and the owl comes out .
and the bees are still chasing the dog .
and the owl chased him up a rock .
and then a deer gets him on his antlers and throws him into a river
and they hear a noise .
and they look over .
and they see the frog and the frog's family .
and then they get one of their little frogs .
and they say goodbye to the frogs .
