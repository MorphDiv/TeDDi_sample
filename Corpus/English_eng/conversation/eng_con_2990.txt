this situation is about buying a car . 4235_9235
we have done a lot of situations where something is growing by a percentage . 9715_13495
you get a pay raise, you are having interest . 13695_15995
what we haven't done as much, we've done a couple, but not much, is when you are losing value by a percentage . 16495_25515
when you buy a car typically, does the value increase or decrease over time ? 26125_31625
increase .
okay if it is a really old car and you take really good care of it it might go up . 32445_37145
but the majority of the time, a typical car does what ? 37705_39985
decrease . 40365_41305
it is going to decrease . 41305_41985
in this situation Anay buys the car for five thousand dollars, the car loses fifteen percent of its value each year . 42305_49625
I really want you guys to think about . 50465_52565
you are going to find what it is worth after one year . 55745_57565
you are going to write an equation to model the value of the car overtime . 58645_61525
this is not one where I check and tell you whether the equation is right or wrong . 61925_65445
but today, I want you to take a second to check or justify if your equation is realistic, if you think your equation is right, prove to yourself and your groupmates if your equation makes sense before you go on . 65565_79545
what does the equation tell you will happen after one year, after two years, is it reasonable ? 81665_86245
then you will go on and answer these two questions . 87305_91365
go ahead and get started . 91965_92905
seven-hundred-fifty is what it loses, so do we subtract seven-hundred-and-fifty from five thousand ? 93825_108365
maybe +... 109445_109985
so five thousand minus seven-hundred-and-fifty, four-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty dollars . 111085_117945
that makes more sense . 118325_119565
I don't think +... 138075_138495
hmm ? 138935_140375
I don't think that's how it works, nope because when you plug in two it equals one-hundred-and-twelve-point-five so you are not dropping that from five thousand that is how much it is worth . 140775_154975
so seven-hundred-and-fifty is actually what it is worth now . 154995_160615
unless our equation is wrong . 160855_164655
maybe +... 165255_167875
probably . 166195_166475
after five years it is worth thirty-seven cents . 166475_177295
that can't be realistic . 178275_180255
after eight years it is worth one cent &=laughs . 196295_198035
wow . 198535_199295
nope . 200015_200175
oh wait, it said to write an equation to model the value of the car over time right underneath it . 201455_211255
wait this makes somewhat no sense . 211655_214835
what makes somewhat no sense ?
we made an equation we plugged in one and we got seven-hundred-and-fifty and we said that was not realistic . 216735_223055
okay . 223555_223855
and then we were like maybe seven-hundred-and-fifty is the percentage it loses so we subtracted that from five thousand . 224185_229385
and we got four-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty dollars . 229845_231665
but when we kept going it ended up equaling cents, or we plugged in two and it wasn't seven-hundred-and-fifty . 231945_239405
so you are repeatedly multiplying times fifteen and it is going down too quickly . 239405_244625
yeah . 245265_245505
okay, not times fifteen, fifteen percent, point-one-five . 247405_251905
yeah that is true, have you ever had that happen when you tried to model a pay raise or something and you accidentally made the equation go down really fast ? 251075_259515
I think so . 259855_260475
maybe . 261035_261055
I don't remember . 261495_261995
because I remember when did a six percent pay raise and they multipled by point-zero-six, it also went down way too fast . 261995_267495
Do you remember what was the problem there ? 267655_269175
nope .
no, I don't remember off the top of my head . 269315_274775
okay, you are right that your equation is wrong . 276635_279395
seven-hundred-and-fifty is right but the equation is wrong ? 281375_283415
seven-hundred-and-fifty means what again ? 283535_284935
how much it is worth after one year ? 285615_287995
it is how much it loses . 288555_289695
no, seven-hundred-and-fifty dollars is the correct amount it loses in value after one year, so how much will it be after one year ? 289935_296475
four-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty dollars . 297155_299235
yes, that is correct . 299735_300995
your equation is going to need a little tweaking you are on the right track, TCH exits . 301315_306455
how did we get the right answer but the wrong equation ? 310085_311885
the equation only works once . 313605_316685
because then afterwards it's weird . 317525_319085
you think she wants us to do the log ? 322165_333105
maybe log might work . 333485_336685
I doubt though . 339125_339685
how do you even do log if you don't know the base number ? 339885_342905
well you do know the base number, you don't know what you want it to equal . 343185_346845
I'm not getting that . 347465_353445
oh we can do, how long before the car is worth half of its original value . 366465_371065
did you get it S_three ? 406745_407525
I got a negative exponent, but I used that equation . 407745_417285
shoot, well that won't work . 417825_422765
makes no sense, how do we have the right answer but the wrong equation ? 422845_429105
the equation only works once . 430145_434145
everybody is using the same equation . 438885_439705
it is probably the most simplest thing we are missing . 441565_449325
we are missing, it is the point-fifteen . 449325_450305
I don't think the point-fifteen is right . 450425_451705
I think each year we have to change the five hundred . 471885_474365
you mean to the current value ? 475045_476885
yeah . 477445_477665
to the other current value . 477825_479085
so for the second year, it would be four-thousand-two-hundred-fifty times point-one-five . 480505_488525
point-one-five would give you another answer . 488525_490105
and it would give you six-hundred-thirty-seven-point-five and you subtract that then you get three-thousand-six-hundred-twenty-five . 490705_501865
which gives you the value of the second year, you're suppose to change it every year, I just don't . 499485_504445
I just don't know how to make it fit the equation . 504445_506045
what if it's not even exponential ? 507305_508865
and zero . 528465_528965
it seems like a lot of people have . 530265_533265
this is a little trickier than what we usually do . 533405_535185
okay ?
I did get sucked in a little bit to talking to certain groups . 535645_537865
let me see . 538765_540265
no xxx .
what did you get for A ? 541565_547225
what was the car worth after one year and how did you get it ? 547725_551185
I got four-thousand-three-hundred-and-forty-seven . 551985_558445
how did you get that ? 564905_565665
I put five thousand, parentheses, one-point-fifteen . 566765_573045
close the parentheses . 574045_575145
and I added negative one to it . 575625_578685
after closing the parentheses ? 579205_582645
no, up . 582805_583265
okay . 583885_587985
and I gave you this number . 592065_593005
okay, S_six, what did you get after one year ? 594165_602645
I got four-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty . 604085_606025
okay . 606205_606485
how ? 606685_607645
because I multiplied five thousand times point-fifteen to the power of one, which is seven-hundred-and-fifty . 607035_621595
And then I subtracted seven-fifty by five thousand and got that . 621895_624915
so, what does this seven-fifty represent ? 625095_626975
the loss in one year . 627735_629475
this was a loss after one year and you subtracted it five thousand minus seven-fifty and you got forty-two-fifty . 629475_643335
what happens if you put a negative ? 643855_644855
do you guys remember what happened ? 645175_647955
Did you put a negative one in the exponent ? 648075_649315
it makes a fraction . 650855_651955
it makes it . 652895_653735
this would become one over one-point-five and that will make your value go down . 654435_663055
okay, so I like . 663715_664735
this is similar to if you were dividing by one-point-one-five . 665535_668315
okay, so I actually, I really like where this group is headed . 668595_670835
this one's correct . 671415_672575
this one is not correct but I like where this group is headed because what they were trying to do is make sure that the- S_six . 673715_681995
what they were trying to do is make sure that the value is going down over time . 682835_688055
they're doing something with fifteen percent, they saw that if you do your regular fifteen percent rates, it would be going up, which we couldn't have that . 688315_696755
so we're trying to make it go down over time . 696955_704255
okay . 705055_705095
I want just clear this up a little bit though at this point because we've gone in a lot of different directions . 705555_710295
this is definitely the amount after one year . 712315_716255
this is definitely the amount after one year, we are still in this mode of trying to figure out something we could do as an equation okay besides dividing that would give us this correct amount after one year . 719395_736415
okay ? 737335_737595
I'm going to go ahead and just set up a little bit of a table for a second year . 738145_741905
I don't want to tell you the equation yet . 742125_743445
we have years, after zero years the car was worth five thousand, right ? 743965_749585
after one year it was worth what ? 749905_751705
I see people trying to make exponential equations . 752905_762345
why are you guys trying to make exponential equations ? 762465_764165
because we've always learned that percent usually isn't that . 766375_769775
okay . 769775_770235
yes . 770695_770715
and is the car going to continue losing sven-hundred-and-fifty dollars every year ? 771675_775775
no .
no . 776135_776655
why not ? 777415_778675
because it increases every year .
because it increases in value ? 779895_785495
yeah ? 786975_787555
okay, well what we were talking about was that when you . 789635_796195
after .
okay, that was five thousand times point-one-five equals seven-hundred-fifty, that's for the first year . 799055_804195
But when did you have to trade out the five thousand for the four-thousand-two-hundred-and-fifty, and then minus it by whatever ? 804675_812855
in other words, if I wanted to calculate the second year, how much money was lost ? 814525_817965
you were right . 818725_819225
in that second year . 819825_820925
xxx are you with me ? 821345_823045
in that second year, I wouldn't be calculating fifteen percent of the five thousand anymore, I would be calcuating fifteen percent of the new amount . 823145_830405
so how would you write that ? 830945_831965
isn't the equation xxx ? 832145_832645
okay . 832985_834285
I'm going to give you guys five, ten more minutes to think about what the equation could be . 835085_838485
think of what the equation should be . 839385_842065
It's not five thousand times point-one-five to the x . 842915_845275
It's not times one-point-one-five to the x, okay ? 845415_850035
Although those are both good ideas . 850115_852275
