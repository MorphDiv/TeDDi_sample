well . 460_620
&-um Danny how how do you know . 1100_3380
you're in the last row . 3400_4270
because . 5150_5300
of . 6030_6140
four oh four rows . 8910_10470
we . 10860_10970
had to the . 11080_11430
bottom one four times . 11480_12150
uhhuh . 12880_12950
go one two three one . 15380_18250
okay . 19590_19720
three . 20130_20430
what . 20780_20940
well forty four times . 21350_23700
where is there a four square at this one . 25370_27230
the core square is right here . 27840_30250
that's this where right here . 31580_33380
yeah . 34790_34910
draw a line here . 35230_36220
I draw a . 36900_37350
line . 37400_37500
oh no . 37580_37810
don't draw a line . 37960_38630
well Dana you said . 39320_40340
no . 40360_40510
what do you . 40560_40900
I don't . 41080_41270
what do you think . 41320_41750
I dunno think . 41800_42070
has a course . 42420_42940
see see watch . 43940_45460
I there's . 45750_46100
no .
course square . 46200_46510
I think there's a course square . 46560_47540
I think that . 47840_48950
course . 49500_49870
you think maybe that's a course square right there . 50740_52380
can you show . 52420_52860
it to me on the . 52880_53390
is it the same over here or is there Core square over here . 56140_59270
yeah right there . 59730_60070
oh right here . 60380_60900
okay . 61560_61740
well with this core square though . 61760_63110
uhoh . 63630_63800
Yucky . 65450_65590
yucky . 66130_66460
here I'll go get you a yucky . 67300_68610
I'll go get a paper towel for you . 69580_70670
it's yummy . 71200_71620
I I want you you . 71880_73060
are gonna . 73290_73420
get thanks . 73440_73820
thanks . 74100_74430
Brian . 74830_74980
I wipe it . 75760_76310
alright . 77030_77350
well you so you're showing this Core square here . 78520_80940
Danny right here . 81170_81980
mhm . 82860_83060
<we can> we can just push it . 83700_85100
yeah . 90310_90370
we can go under the table . 90660_93740
okay . 99470_99740
didn't need it after all . 100060_101140
huh . 101220_101380
did you guys use the camera . 102020_103110
well Danny Danny &-uh o Brian Danny says . 107980_111380
this is probably the core square here . 111550_113300
if this is a core square . 113960_114940
core square has to be in the middle . 116350_117610
has to be in the middle . 118420_119100
no . 120860_121030
because see this is a core square . 121080_123470
no . 124700_124810
because &-um because I guess I don't . 124920_128000
'cause &-um then it's not all around here . 132910_135600
what's not all around here . 136620_137730
I don't . 137840_138130
I don't . 138500_138730
quite if that was the if that was the middle . 138800_141670
yeah . 142200_142310
if that was the course where it would be like over here . 142600_145350
oh but you don't see that pattern over there . 146230_147660
huh . 147820_147880
you don't see that pattern over there . 149260_150460
is that what you're saying . 151940_152580
I can't see . 156440_157550
I think that is . 158200_159540
and this one . 160620_162060
okay . 162380_162580
well let's look at it . 162600_163300
then if we did this or if this was a core square right earlier . 163320_169460
you said that maybe that was four square . 169580_171100
yes . 171380_171410
<what would> what would you do to this four square to make this
like this . 177110_177710
I guess this four . 178080_178780
do you like two . 179220_179700
do a sideways flip . 179900_181170
a sideways . 182880_183390
flip like like that . 184160_186070
like that does that work . 186270_187780
let's look at that . 188330_188980
whoops . 189620_189930
you if you do that . 191080_191980
okay . 192350_192460
alright . 192480_192660
Brian I got it . 192720_193390
okay . 194070_194260
like like this . 194710_195750
where would the white one go then if you . 196290_197910
did that that white one gone on the red . 197960_200430
oh it go on the red that . 201250_202590
red . 202660_202780
but isn't that is that a sideways flip . 203710_205310
if you flip from . 207020_207980
this . 208000_208170
so <if I> if I flipped it . 208220_209820
oh <wait wait> wait Brian let's let Danny describe it for a
she's describing it . 213410_214500
this is a flip this way . 215190_216980
but then the white would be here . 218380_219580
yes . 220700_220730
so it wouldn't match . 221060_221780
is that right . 222020_222460
see that White would match the red . 222870_228140
the white would match the red and the red one . 230140_231550
match . 232070_232160
the white match . 232380_232940
uhhuh . 233410_233560
uhhuh . 236050_236110
but shouldn't it ma <when you> when you do a flip or a turn . 236630_239900
shouldn't it match with this . 240020_241350
fish . 241400_241690
I need that still . 241800_242620
good . 244490_244630
it should it doesn't have to match Danny you're . 245180_246800
not supposed to be playing . 247120_247860
what_if I &-uh what_if I turn this <one one> one way or another
it would still be right there . 261060_263170
but <if you> if you could trade spot these two . 263660_266920
a trade in these spots . 272600_273550
uhhuh . 274530_274710
<how could I> how could I turn this to make this one . 275780_278590
&-uh because this two . 280900_283630
if you flip it you still think it's a flip . 287340_289260
huh . 289500_289560
okay . 290870_291110
well now I noticed &-uh now Brian was saying that this has that you
right . 298680_298770
why do you think that . 299700_300420
because I can see like the square in the middle . 301030_304500
mostly mostly that &-um supposed to that the core square is
okay . 316870_317140
but should the core square . 317160_318460
oh go ahead . 319660_320020
what do you think about . 321150_321860
what_about this . 322830_323430
the core square has to be in the middle . 323540_324860
and I don't think it would be the core square because it's because
what do you think of that . 341520_342160
<Brian Brian> Brian Danny said that it could be the four square
you don't have to see anymore stars . 350540_352110
stone . 352160_352720
what do you think of that . 354190_355190
daddy . 355240_355500
&-um because . 358340_360290
if that's the course . 361380_362950
there would've to be another course square . 364250_366310
everything . 366360_366870
uhuh . 367790_367850
one you say another course square . 369420_370820
&-uh what that's that's one course change somehow . 371510_375060
one course . 375870_376260
will it have to be another core square like this one . 377210_379180
you're saying . 379200_379540
no . 379700_379860
can you find another core square . 380100_381460
okay . 381910_382180
there's a core square in here . 382890_384780
Core square . 385030_385380
oh yeah . 385780_386100
but in this one is there other . 386260_387780
&-uh yeah . 387800_388310
where does this . 388920_389590
core square . 389710_390150
if you take this core square to make another two by two on here . 390380_394590
where would it . 394640_395100
be . 395120_395370
its a bunch . 395900_396390
see I can find all of (th)em . 397320_398830
see . 398980_399150
here's one here one . 399420_403150
he one here's one . 404660_407580
and do they . 408180_410230
look the same . 410280_410730
no . 411420_411590
don't they have to look the same . 412330_413710
&-uh . 414380_414470
no . 415020_415080
no . 415600_415740
yes . 415980_416150
I don't think so . 417520_418070
why do you think that . 419180_419780
'cause all if if they're gonna be all different then then
design . 433220_433590
so you have to put them . 434260_435830
so they the same . 436460_438620
uhhuh . 438930_439010
so they really has to use the same core square . 440100_442140
uhhuh . 443970_444050
I'm just coughing . 448540_449380
it . 449420_449480
you just copied it . 452540_453380
Brian . 453450_453740
thinks that there's Brian Brian yeah . 453860_457860
do you think that the core square means that it has to be in the
&-uh yeah that's . 462930_463670
what you think . 463720_464080
well . 467920_468030
no . 468900_469070
oh so what what is . 469660_470620
whoa . 470750_470830
what is a core square . 471430_472520
I don't know . 473440_473840
you just tried to it's a . 474820_475700
middle of a well the side of . 475720_477840
a clock . 479490_479740
hmm .
the middle of the side of a clock . 480820_482460
middle or the side . 483160_483870
so what makes it . 484510_485060
a core square . 485160_485620
I don't know . 486840_487230
I dunno . 488480_488950
what makes it . 489000_489670
and you were making your two by two design . 494420_496840
what did you have to do what . 497380_501840
I had to glue the pieces . 503640_504530
down . 505180_505310
yeah . 505730_505830
but what was what were the pieces like . 505880_507700
they were like . 508670_509270
they're all . 509950_510720
triangles . 511160_511400
were they all different . 511910_512600
&-uh no . 515169_515860
were they were the same . 517799_518700
no . 519900_520070
no . 520679_520740
what were they like . 521570_522059
they were some are the same . 522390_523789
some are . 523990_524340
different . 524470_525060
how are they . 525500_526030
different . 526080_526380
skateboard . 526840_527220
because they're different colors like like . 527270_531020
let's take these two grains . 531170_533270
and this that's look the same as those . 533320_536430
uhhuh . 537300_537380
I'm talking about the core square . 538780_540420
the core square . 540740_541390
uhhuh . 541820_541990
when you make it two by two . 542470_543590
I don't think you have four square . 544720_546470
oh yeah . 547110_547350
two by twos are made up of four square . 548510_550650
uhhuh . 551290_551410
so then do the score squares have to repeat in some way . 555220_559430
do they have to be the same . 559500_560550
so . 562260_562410
now they don't have to be the same . 562480_563820
