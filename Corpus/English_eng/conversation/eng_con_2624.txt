should like those of you who <came punctually> to get your full money's worth .
&-uh your papers will be coming back in a painfully slow trickle &=laughs:multiple but I shall return them as I finish them &-uh just for purpose of time's sake I'll probably do all the opus eighteen number sixes together all the opus twelve number ones together etcetera etcetera .
&-um in a former life I I served as a desk editor for a publisher so I use &-uh a_lot_of proofreading symbols that &-uh I'll probably have to explain &-uh at some point when more of you have your papers it also means that I have to &-uh resist mightily the impulse to write you a letter after every sentence .
&=laughs:multiple so if you see page after page of your pristine prose left pristine it either means that I think what you're saying makes sense and it's fairly clearly expressed or it means that I don't know where to begin and I'm just <you know> &~s you know +...
&=laughs:multiple I'll try to strike a happy medium okay ?
but please this is just you're getting your money's worth if I give you criticism .
not if I give you one pat on the back after another .
none of it's personal .
I don't think I take any mean pleasure in destroying the works of students .
colleagues perhaps .
&=laughs:multiple musicologists the few of you here have a right to expect that I will be far rougher on you &=laughs because writing is how you perform .
where were we ?
opus four +//.
oh oh why is this person here sleeping ?
&-uh &=laughs:multiple who are you ?
&=micase_recording_announcement .
cut the profanity this time .
&=laughs:multiple we shall edit ourselves carefully .
&=laughs:multiple alright the Kreutzer Sonata is misleading on two counts .
why ?
that title .
what's wrong with it ?
⌈ Kreutzer never played it ⌉ .
⌊ it's not a sonata ⌋ .
Kreutzer never played it .
it was written for whom ?
Bridgetower .
George Bridgetower .
and what's wrong with the other half of that title ?
it's not a sonata .
it's not a sonata .
what is it ?
concerto .
quasiconcerto .
yeah quasi quasi@s:fra come@s:fra in@s:fra uno@s:fra stile@s:fra molto@s:fra concertante@s:fra d'un@s:fra concerto@s:fra right as Beethoven put it on his &-uh or something +//.
words to that effect .
alright now what is unusual about it so far ?
what has Beethoven done fully to justify that charge of aesthetic terrorism that was leveled at him in a contemporary review +..?
begins with a violin as a &~pr places more importance on the violin than the piano .
okay that's definitely a &=sound_effect what ?
what else ?
the structure's rather elusive and fleeting and whatever .
⌈ what about the structure ?
what about the structure's ⌉ .
⌊ and that was there's there there's nothing ⌋ obvious about it .
there's nothing obvious about it okay .
specifics .
the key areas &-um is A the tonic or is it really just the dominant of D ?
D minor right .
okay ?
the key area isn't .
a key area .
it starts on +...
it starts somewhere and goes somewhere but neither the point of departure nor the destination of the first phrase happen to be the tonic .
okay ?
and the piano plays the same game right ?
where &~wh where can we start to talk of a key area or any kind of tonal definition ?
the beginning of the transition ?
exactly .
the beginning of the transition .
which we usually think of as taking us away from something and deluding our ear into thinking that something else is the tonic .
is the aural home base .
Beethoven has been doing this lately right ?
the first movement of the so+called Tempest Sonata .
the D minor opus thirty one number two .
doesn't present you with a key area .
we're not sure what it is that &~sp he's presenting us with .
maybe an accompanying recitative but tonal definition comes only with &=plays_piano the beginning of the transition .
okay .
alright .
if you've got your score oh oh &-uh the other question <what's the> what's the intervallic tie that binds ?
half step .
what kind of half step ?
rising .
rising half step .
okay .
alright .
let's listen and I'm gonna stop when we get to the transition .
you can sleep unimpeded Mister_Dzerzhinski <(be)cause I'm gonna> turn the lights off here .
I've got a &-uh we we were listening to Schigedi <and &-uh> and &-uh Bartok last time this is Georg Kulenkampff and Georg Szolti the two Georgs .
Szolti playing the piano .
&=laughs:multiple &=musical_example_playing (0.5) get the point that the rising half step is D ?
(0.11) <take a> take a cadenza violin (0.21) okay .
this I'm gonna invent a new term okay it's going to be useful today .
it's called the transition to the transition .
okay ?
here's where it starts .
in this faux key area alright ?
notice .
&~chroma the the ascent chromatic ascent of the bass driving the whole (un)til we finally finally cadence in one and of_course that's the beginning of the transition okay ?
now (0.6) if you're at all familiar with Mozart's piano concertos +...
you know that the virtuosic high points of classic concerto form are bound to occur apart from the cadenzas are bound to occur in the transitions .
in the transitional passages .
this I think is a throwback to the ritornello from of the old baroque violin concertos in which the solos precisely the solos did the modulating .
(o)kay so the virtuosic solo passages were the ones that moved harmonically so too in classical concerto form a la Mozart the transitions to the modulatory passages are the most virtuosic .
&-uh we have or we're about to hear a long virtuosic transition that dwarfs the preceding key area .
but the violin is going to keep the rising half step in our ear .
let's listen a little bit further .
&=musical_example_playing (0.6) here (0.4) finally the alternation of tonic and dominant my gosh (0.7) second stage (0.10) xxx same pitches as <in in two> .
third stage (0.6) okay thank you very much and notice the sforzando &-uh emphasis on &~the these pitches same pitches as in the slow introduction .
and not for the last time Beethoven &~wha what he wants to when he wants to make a connection to the slow introduction he &~reno he he he makes the rhythm correspond you gotta use football notes which &~i it presto prestissimo of_course wind up being something like &-uh quarter notes in in the slow intro .
okay now the third stage &-uh of this transition right down here has been setting up the minor dominants .
E minor again just as in the so+called Tempest Sonata .
now we get ready for the rug to be pulled out from under us .
bam +...
a choralelike relief theme in E major .
notice that it too begins with our old intervallic friend .
&=pause_while_musical_example_plays don't you love a key area that's not a key area ?
&=laughs:multiple alright &-uh same trivia as in the slow introduction right ?
repeated in the parallel minor when the piano takes over .
right ?
same thing as the opening gesture of this .
where the piano took what the violin had presented and minored it .
alright ?
and once again I think Beethoven is signaling this connection by writing in football notes here .
okay ?
&~thing things are slowed down .
to a pace that might bring to mind the slow introduction even with the change of meter .
well it's time for another ferociously virtuosic transition God only knows to what .
&=pause_while_musical_example_plays oh my .
oh my .
there's the minor dominant rearing its head just as signaled in the second key area right ?
and what interval does this new theme consist of almost entirely ?
rising +/.
+, m@l-s Ypres you were smiling ?
<a rising> ?
rising half steps .
and nothing but .
okay ?
&-uh so that gives us three distinct key areas .
in this exposition .
well kind of .
alright ?
A minor which was established as tonic only by the transition .
E major for that &=plays_piano which we can't really regard as a mid transition episode I'd love to palm it off on you as that but we've had a complete &~trans transition complete modulation before it .
so we have to regard it as a as as a key area a theme in its own right &-uh and E minor in which key the exposition closes .
and what's the closing material based on ?
let's see if I go that far +//.
I'll let you listen .
&=musical_example_playing (0.25) here's the close (0.9) what's that based on ?
transition .
the transition the most stable part of the exposition .
becomes appropriately the material for the closing passage the cadential passage .
now rather than work &-uh phrase by phrase through the development section let me simply say that it starts with an A minor triad that is the original tonic which we never heard in the first key area and immediately continues on F +...
now that lurch suggests the tonal trajectory .
okay we're gonna fling from the original tonic far to the flat side .
a@l flat .
d@l flat .
even e@l flat minor and guess what it's unfailingly the rising half step that takes us there .
remember that passage in the first symphony when we were when I was ruining the humor of Beethoven for you ?
I said okay he's gotta get the tonic to go down by a half step so what's he gonna do ?
make the bass rise by half steps until he gets there .
okay same kind of thing going on here only I don't think it's very funny .
I don't think it would be much exaggeration at all to say that that one interval the rising half step is the basis of the development section .
in this movement and the consequences are drawn with brutal consistency in the recapitulation .
what do we expect in harmonic terms the recapitulation to reassert ?
tonic .
the tonic right ?
but what Beethoven is going to reassert is not the tonic but the sense of bewilderment that we felt at the beginning of the exposition .
what is the tonic anyway ?
okay ?
here's our retransition starting there okay ?
&-uh preparing +...
&-uh A minor not A major and then you've down here it gives us A major clear as day right ?
which he immediately reinterprets as the dominant of four .
of the minor .
subdominant .
well okay .
we've had plenty of D minor in the slow introduction why not here too ?
but then (0.6) what on earth is this +..?
<five of D minor> five of D minor five of D minor &-uh the beginning of the recap on the minor subdominant of the minor subdominant .
G minor .
way to the flat side .
way overshooting the mark +...
so the first phrase starts on four of four and stops on three of four .
right ?
then he backtracks here rehearsal letter M to the slow introduction .
&=singing that whole buildup passage at the end of the slow introduction &~co of_course renotated for presto circumstances here alright ?
and here finally he gets back on track alright ?
well and on track of_course is the original off tonic starting points .
once again the original tonic will be reestablished only at the beginning of the transition .
now .
if we're defining sonata form in tonal terms that would mean that the recap which we usually understand to be a return to the tonic either begins with the retransition without any thematic resemblance or it begins with the transition .
okay ?
no wonder that Kreutzer is reported to have found this music outrageously unintelligible .
we may be tempted to conclude that by eighteen three sonata form had been so thoroughly trampled on by Beethoven as to be irrelevant .
to an appreciation of his structural procedures .
and yet how else to appreciate the divergences the unintelligible outrageousness and the &~ruthle ruthless logic that underlies those qualities unless we hold up the template of structural expectations .
to a piece that in my view posits sheer bewilderment as a legitimate as a positive aesthetic emotion .
questions about +...
quasi@s:fra come@s:fra un@s:fra concerto@s:fra molto@s:fra concertante@s:fra ?
(0.7) &-uh we'll see this again in the fifth .
alright that that a recapitulation is not a recapitulation of the theme or a tonality so much as the recapitulation of an emotional experience .
of an aesthetic impression .
that is the structural reason why in the finale of the fifth Beethoven hasta go back to the long slow buildup lifted from the minuet .
huh minuet scherzo whatever you want to call it .
the third movement .
because he's recapitulating a transformation .
not just a tune .
alright .
symphonic stuff .
I suggested when we were finishing up with Eroica that the this symphony completed a sort_of &-uh historic transformation from the significance of the genre from the sort_of lightweight divertimento style that we associate with Sammartini to a public genre of instrumental music in which some fundamental problems of human existence might be grappled with .
but of_course a far more palpable way of dealing with such weighty matters was afforded by dramatic composition .
moreover in Beethoven's day the composition of successful operas carried a_lot more prestige certainly a_lot more financial reward than the composition of symphonies and sonatas however molto@s:ita concertante@s:ita .
I suspect that Beethoven had been thinking in operatic terms in terms of composing operas ever since the mid seventeen nineties .
when at least in my view he began condensing entire operas into keyboard variation sets .
he was certainly thinking in operatic terms by the time he started trying to court the favor of Antonio Salieri with the dedication of the opus twelve violin sonatas .
but then .
in the spring of eighteen two .
a more powerful operatic stimulus came to Vienna +...
please don't try to write all of this down because it's on reserve in &~th one of the text packets okay ?
this is not an exercise in stenography .
&=laughs (0.4) I just want to +...
as a historian I figured that what a first sort_of precondition you hadta get things in the right order if at all possible before you could start picking off relationships &-uh between (th)em .
so in the spring of eighteen two Emanuel Schikaneder produced Luigi Cherubini's Lodoiska with great success .
Lodoiska was a rescue opera of a type that had become extremely popular in revolutionary Paris who knows what a rescue opera is ?
(0.4) &=sound_effect Mister_Arnhem .
you have &-uh &~mo most cases it's you know the the hero rescuing the damsel in distress kind of thing it doesn't hafta be but some kind of rescue is performed is necessary by the plot anyway as part of the resolution of the opera .
okay is it usually a damsel in distress ?
no &-uh I shouldn't ha(ve) put it that way that's loaded .
ah yeah I shouldn't put it &~th I'm sorry I &~wa feeding you there .
Mister_Froid what's a rescue opera ?
it would be a a usually a like the Entfuehrung of Mozart would that be one ?
where it's a woman of nobility is taken by the exotic other and then they have &=laughs:multiple to endeavor to capture her back ?
if that's a rescue opera it's it's a rescue opera only as a spoof .
a rescue opera is a subgenre of opera comique@s:fra &-uh the first prominent example of which is &-um Gretry's Richard Coeur_De_Lion Richard the Lion Hearted &-uh seventeen eighty five .
but what's usually happening is that some victim of raw political oppression is unjustly imprisoned .
kept in the pokey and only the self-sacrificing intervention of a loyal friend or spouse suffices to save the day a hair breadth escape at the eleventh hour is the usual pattern .
and hair breadth's escapes at the eleventh hour from the forces of tyranny had an obvious topical relevance in revolutionary Paris .
now I don't know whether Schikaneder's motives in producing Cherubini in imperial Vienna were political I mean is this the old &-uh &-uh free masonic idealist coming back to haunt the businessman here ?
or is he simply banking on the appeal of a cliffhanging story ?
for any audience aristocratic or revolutionary ?
I don't know .
either way he was so successful with his discovery of Cherubini that &-uh the court theater sent &~B Baron Von Braun to Paris to negotiate directly with Cherubini and get more scores .
to produce in Vienna .
and the rivalry was on between Schikaneder's Theater_An_Der_Wien and the Hoftheater that was superintended by Baron Von Braun .
&-uh both houses produced versions of Cherubini's Les Deux Journees in August eighteen two Schikaneder one day before the court theater as you can see &-uh in August of all times .
what's wrong with this picture ?
in August Vienna is so hot and miserable that nobody wants to be there .
they all go off in the +//.
why is Beethoven in Heiligenstadt ?
and that sort of thing &~wh because nobody wants to be in the capital and yet &~s I +//.
this is the only way I can explain it to myself so intense was the rivalry between these two theatrical &~ex establishments to be first with Cherubini that they couldn't wait for the opening of the normal theatrical season .
the court theater produced Midi in November +...
and Schikaneder produced Elise in December in what Thayer called a sadly mutilated version as Der Bernardsberg of_course this all hadta be translated into German .
&-uh and French operas by Cherubini and Mehul and Lesueur among others became all the rage in Vienna for the next several years .
now Beethoven as I tried take pains to point out to you in the very in the second lecture of the semester Beethoven had been raised on opera comique@s:fra .
in Bonn .
but he'd rather lost connection with that repertoire since seventeen ninety three .
well Beethoven apparently responded quite enthusiastically to this new repertoire both to the musical style and to the subject matter and for the rest of his life he would regard Luigi Cherubini as his favorite dramatic composer .
how many of you hadta learn Cherubini music in any of your music history classes ?
my god .
good .
what did you have to learn ?
oh I I did my undergrad work here so they they bring it all into the +//.
it's all in Grout Palisca .
ah they finally they've seen the light .
&=laughs Cherubini is great .
study him faithfully .
&-um I think this new kind of opera was an aesthetic challenge an artistic challenge to Beethoven just in the same way that the arrival in seventeen ninety nine of pianists like Cramer and Woelfel had &-um &-uh given him like sort_of a a a competitive spur in his piano composition .
so early in eighteen three Schikaneder who you know of_course wants &~t another coup was continuing this theatrical rivalry he commissions Beethoven to write him an opera .
and he even threw free room and board at his theater into the bargain .
and so Beethoven wasted a year working on a perfectly atrocious libretto by Schikaneder called Vestas Feuer the Vestal Fire .
by early eighteen four a whole year later he had found something far more congenial an old French libretto by the same man JN Bouilly who had written the libretto of Leonore or or I'm sorry .
no hold it wait no that's not what I wanted to show you .
&-uh who had written the libretto to &-uh Cherubini's Les Deux Journees .
and that was JN Bouilly .
&-uh and his libretto was give the title here Leonore_Ou_Lamour_Conjugal .
Leonore or Conjugal Love .
side bar I'm sorry I don't like to do this usually but &-uh &-uh for those of you who saw or endured Eyes Wide Shut this is the point that Kubrick is making +//.
you know Kubrick a big Beethoven aficionado &-uh as you may remember from Clockwork Orange Fidelio is the passport to the temple of the lights of_course the irony is that the subtitle of Fidelio is conjugal love .
okay .
close side bar alright &-uh the plot of this libretto was based on an actual case of unjust imprisonment and rescue through the &~loy loyal devotion of a wife pretending to be a boy .
at least that's what Bouilly claimed in his memoirs decade later .
it's been questioned but this &-uh libretto had been set as you see here in seventeen ninety eight by Pierre Gaveaux and then in an Italian translation by +//.
oop I have to switch back to the other page Ferdinando Paer in eighteen four .
it seems likely that Beethoven took more than a casual glance at both scores .
in composing his version of the opera .
now .
to appreciate the plot the Leonore plot and Beethoven's affection for this plot it's important to understand the significance of opera in general in revolutionary Paris .
I mentioned in connection with the Eroica the massive outdoor festivals that the revolutionary government staged &-uh with an important educational function .
these festivals helped to consolidate public opinion on important political questions .
and they presented of_course inspiring examples of self-sacrifice and dedication to democratic ideals .
well opera was pressed into the same kind of we'd call it blatantly propagandistic role .
once a week the revolutionary government threw open the theaters free admission and the crowds were invited into the theaters to enjoy &-uh newly composed opera on some appropriately revolutionary topic meant to present examples of heroism self-sacrifice dedication to the ideals of the republic .
and operatic performances were frequently interrupted when audience members demanded the singing of this or that currently popular revolutionary or in some theaters like the Theatre_De_Lesueur royalist song .
&-um for those of you who have read High Brow Low Brow by &-uh Lawrence Levine &-uh he quite happily compares eighteenth and nineteenth century performance to &-um sporting events .
in American culture .
so what you see going on in the stands of &~y extreme football or something is gives you an idea of performance circumstances in the opera house in countries that were not trained from the very get-go to regard opera as inherently soporific .
&-um operatic performance in revolutionary Paris was patently political and didactic and propagandistic so the topicality of the Leonore story that will be clear in that context and will be clear to you once you &~le read the libretto which you should do &-uh it's in +//.
translated in the recording .
I've tried here &-uh to untangle a little bit of the &-uh &~cro chronological thicket of Beethoven's only opera for you .
&-uh the issue of which overture belongs with which production is especially confusing let's hop forward backward forward to eighteen seven .
(o)kay whoops no yeah there we go .
alright .
eighteen seven .
<&-uh the third &~Bee &-uh> the third overture that Beethoven wrote for this unrealized revival of Fidelio in Prague was not discovered until after Beethoven's death .
and it was presumed to be the original the earliest version .
so it was called number one and hence everything is misnumbered .
okay all of the &-uh Leonore overtures are misnumbered .
&-uh the earliest is Leonore number two but the one I'd like to focus on is Leonore number three for the &-uh second &~t the eighth of the March eighteen six &-uh revival and revision of this opera .
number three is rather like number two but I think a bit more skillfully focused ⌈ &-uh ⌉ .
⌊ is ⌋ number three the second one composed ?
yes +/.
⌈ thank you that's xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ number three is the second one composed .
so the ⌋ order is number ⌈ two ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ two ⌋ three one +/.
+, number three number one Fidelio .
+, right +/.
+, because that's what we call the overture that he wrote in eighteen fourteen .
okay ?
alright .
now .
Basil Dean I think rightly calls Leonore three the first and perhaps the greatest tone poem .
and this description of Leonore as tone poem reflects the descent the stylistic descent of the tone poem from a certain kind of opera overture .
not just an attention getter to shut up the audience in the days before dimmer switches did that job .
but an overture or &~no not an overture that bears no relationship to the opera that follows and hence is interchangeable from one opera to another but an overture that in the words of the eighteenth century reformer enlightened reformer he uses that particularly loaded term Francesco Algarotti an overture should according to Algarotti announce the business of the drama to follow .
now Gluck not in Orfeo but in the operas that came after Orfeo had written such overtures and in the case of Iphigenie_En_Tauride Gluck had made the overture lead Attaca into the first scene .
but there's a different model of dramatically motivated overture .
a model that Mozart had followed with the overture to Don Giovanni an overture that leads straight to the very heart of the drama .
and he does this in Don Giovanni as many of you know by quoting the music of the decisive encounter between Giovanni and the statue of the Commendatore .
the stone guest .
this was the option that Beethoven chose .
this was the model that Beethoven followed with his first two Leonore overtures numbers two and three .
&=laughs:multiple now from the standpoints of harmony and thematic allusion these two overtures are written from the point of view of which character in the opera +..?
Leonore ?
Fidelio &=makes_buzzer_sound:S1 .
Fidelio .
&=makes_buzzer_sound same answer .
Florestan .
Florestan .
they're written from the point of view of Florestan Mister_Froid ?
I'm sorry is she the one that descends down <into the> &-uh into the prison to save +//.
I'm not familiar with their names &=laughs:multiple but I I +//.
too well but &=laughs:S1 <this is all but> I'm sorry <I mean> I mean .

&=laughs:multiple .

he does it to me all the time +...
&=laughs:multiple no it's it it's &~i from the +/.

⌊ well ⌋ the reason why I said Leonore was because at the beginning &-uh the big descent at the very beginning it seems like descending down into the prison which can't be the perspective of the person in the prison but the person going down into the prison +/.
⌈ ah ⌉ +/.
⌊ xxx ⌋ but without learning what's taken place before the xxx he hadta get there somehow .
(0.6) .
I think you're on to the <you're you're> you're you're you're hearing it in the right way but just &-uh with a literalism that's is causing you to confuse &-uh Leonore with Florestan .
or with the audience's perspective which at the very beginning of this overture is taken down into the figurative pit for him to sing or his instrumental proxies in the orchestra to sing In_Des_Lebens_Fruehlingstagen .
okay ?
as we shall see .
&-uh Beethoven scored these overtures two and three for the biggest orchestra he required before the fifth symphony and sixth symphony .
we got &-uh two each of flutes oboes clarinets bassoons for the first time a second pair of horns horns in C and E major for reasons which obvious &-uh later on and three different flavors of trombone .
okay ?

but they're not pairs of alto trombones ?
I don't think so no .
that would be tromboni@s:fra .
that would be tromboni@s:fra .
oh that's &~t oh okay .
didn't I ask last time &~ho how many spoke Italian ?
did I is this is okay ?
alright +...
he prefaces the overture with the lengthiest most mysterious slow introduction he had written yet .
the supposed C major work opens on five the first triad tonicized is B minor +...
and then he moves straight to a@l flat .
and that's just for starters .
Cherubini himself is reported to have said quote well to be frank I must confess that I could not tell what key it was in from beginning to end .
we've seen procedures like this before .
&-uh but now I think the withholding of harmonic and thematic definition is taken to a new extreme .
now as Mister_Froid indicated this is music that invites programmatic interpretation at nearly every step .
the long scalar descent at the beginning not only gives us an important motive for further development but at the same time takes us figuratively down our perspective down into Florestan's dungeon cell .
I'm not saying that this is that these are the steps of Florestan taking to get there or these are this is Leonore going down after him or and Rocco following &-uh no but it's our perspective that is being shifted the the the opening gesture commands attention and then we are led downward into the pit and the groans of the bassoons tell us when we've gotten to our figurative destination .
&-uh the thematic fragment presented in a@l flat is none other than Florestan's despairing aria In_Des_Lebens_Fruehlingstagen .
the very key a@l flat was associated by Beethoven with death and dying .
there's a story &-uh of him saying he had &~r responding to the poetry of Klopstock .
a German poet popular in the seventeen seventies and eighties .
he said Klopstock he he always wants to die he's always in a@l flat major .
okay this is an association in Beethoven's mind but just not in Beethoven's mind because his &~contempor earlier contemporary JDC Schubart whom singers among you may know as the author to the text Die Forelle The Trout &-uh called this the Graebeton .
the key appropriate for graves &-um (0.14) I can't see these bands any more .
(0.8) &=musical_example_playing (0.28) five of D minor (0.28) and there's a move to a@l flat .
&-uh and here next a rumination on the xxx of the aria .
leading to a dominant preparation of E major again for reasons that will become clear and then a furious fortississimo outburst on a@l flat before finally dominant preparation of the tonic C major .
&-um did anybody want a score ?
<how many> how many brought scores with them +..?
&-uh we'll let the front of the room get it this time &-uh measure thirty two and thirty three I'll stepped on my shoe laces I'll try to &-uh signal your attention you're gonna hear a a a certain motive in the &-uh flutes and oboes the last motivic idea in the slow intro and of_course the question will be when does this thing come back ?

five of E (0.12) xxx +...
again xxx (0.47) xxx coming back (0.8) xxx very very xxx in the development section (0.17) no wonder Cherubini couldn't tell what key it was in xxx our first gesture toward the tonic comes at the beginning of the allegro as you just heard the allegro presents two motivic ideas &=singing pin that motivic butterfly to the wall call it a@l one .
&=singing we'll call a@l two okay ?
two motivic ideas presented at the outset without their gelling into anything yet quite like a theme .
in fact the first key area sounds very much like a passage of dominant preparation itself .
it sounds very much like a transition to the transition .
just as in the first movement of the so+called Tempest Sonata so+called Kreutzer Sonata so too here .
thematic definition is withheld until what seems like the beginning of the transition and the transition is huge .
if there's anything that we can say structurally about Leonore three it's that what we used to think of as key areas are just small episodic islands in the midst of a perpetual sense of transition .
&=musical_example_playing (0.17) this is a key area (0.7) &=laughing:multiple (0.4) (0.4) I xxx I put that nick in there before xxx sense of buildup +...
xxx &=musical_example_playing xxx (0.28) xxx transition (0.8) now we're at the first stage of dominant preparation (0.8) okay what key are we supposed to be in at this point ?
G major .
G major what key are we in ?
E major ?
E major right .
pianists who've played the Waldstein sonata another C major work with &=plays_piano with &=plays_piano that was sort_of contemporaneous with this hm I wonder if there's any connection well &-um but there's a dramatic significance here .
E major is the key of Leonore's aria Komm Hoffnung Lass_Den_Letzten_Stern a prayer to hope personified hope capital H .
just after she has overheard Pizzaro lay out his murderous plan .
Leonore's aria it turns out has a prominent part for three obbligato horns in E major .
and guess what ?
the E major horns have just brought us into the second key area of the overture .
but the thematic material paraphrases the same aria of Florestan's that the slow introduction had quoted in a@l flat &{l=SINGING in@s:fra des@s:fra Lebens@s:fra &~Fruehlings@s:fra &}l=SINGING only now the &=singing now that much more of that continuation is going to be included in the thematic statement here .
&-uh and do you note how important mediant relationships seem to be here ?
a@l flat C E major the tonic dominant polarity that is supposed to lie at the heart of sonata form is being stretched to the max for reasons that have to do with dramatic symbolism .
now probably the most thrilling moment in this overture comes towards the end of the development section which is long and turbulent and has a_lot_of &=singing okay ?
&-uh suddenly if you turn to page one seventy there &-uh the music pulls up short and a distant trumpet intones &=plays_piano this fanfare in b@l flat major .
and this of_course anticipates the show stopping moment of act two or act three depending on which version you're talking about .
Pizzaro has pulled his dagger to murder Florestan Leonore has pulled a pistol to protect her husband and the offstage trumpet announces the imminent arrival of Don Fernando .
a minister of state who's supposed to inspect the prison .
of_course everything comes to a screeching halt on stage and there's this wonderful slow motion reaction to the stunning turn of events during which Leonore sings Ach@s:fra Du@s:fra bist@s:fra gerettet@s:fra grosser@s:fra Gott@s:fra .
great God you've been saved .
rescued .
well Beethoven quotes this whole stretch of music in the overture .
so the overture has not only led us into the very heart of the drama it's also given away the climactic moment of the drama the peripeteia the reversal of fortunes .
the trumpet fanfare just like the tuba mirum@s:lat in the requiem mass symbolizes judgment day for Pizzaro and redemption for Florestan .
and again Beethoven seems to have been reckoning with long standing symbolic connotations of the key b@l flat .
Schubart describes b@l flat as symbolizing hope and yearning for a better world .
how appropriate .
now there's one last allusion to the opera that I'd like to point out to you after the recap which of_course begins with a transition +...
xxx the transition to the transition that's standing in the place of a first key area in the exposition comes back after this huge long quote from the opera comes back where ?
you've got the score you can answer the question .
take a look at measure thirty thirty .
(0.11) where does it come back ?
what key ?
G .
it comes back on the dominant .
whoa .
now commentators often write this off as a Haydnesque fausse_reprise@s:fra a false recapitulation .
but I think it was a faux first theme in the first place .
now its structural significance is thoroughly acknowledged .
it's a retransition retransition being the ugly translation of the German Rueckleitung@s:fra you know leading us back toward something .
it's in the dominant as a retransition to the recapitulation which begins with the real transition .
okay ?
now .
&-uh after the recap we get a frenzied stretta_di_finale@s:ita &=writing:board use a Verdiesque term for Beethoven pardon the incongruity but a stretta@s:ita a xxx final you know whipping &~whi frenzied close faster close which gives us or quotes a passage from the operatic finale .
an emphatically syncopated setting of the word &{l=SINGING <retterin@s:fra retterin@s:fra> retterin@s:fra retterin@s:fra &}l=SINGING &=singing and this is the final course of acclamation to Leonore as savior .
savioress retterin@s:fra of Florestan Mister_Sharon ?
&~wh what word was that ?
&~retro what ?
sorry .
retterin@s:fra &=making_trilling_noise I have my uvular roll &=writing:board that's the word you should be getting .
at the end of the &-uh at the end of the overture .
okay ?
&-um and speaking of fortississimo outbursts remember that first one in the slow introduction asserted what key ?
a@l flat right ?
we get its counterpoint in the stretta_di_finale@s:ita or <there there> there there asserts a@l flat and then it moves down to five .
to finally give us C major .
well in the stretta_di_finale@s:ita it's going to give us five seven and a@l flat simultaneously .
okay just throw them both into the pot .
&-uh let's see if I can catch the end of this .
heaven preserve us from any more skips &=musical_example_playing_next_2:45 (0.20) talk about theatrical (0.36) transition close (0.26) ah (0.21) of_course this absolutely thrilling piece of music is not the overture that Beethoven decided to use .
&=laughs for whatever reason he was dissatisfied .
course it's easy to say well he must have gone mad and really given it away .
well I +//.
duh .
&=laughs:multiple why write that version of the overture twice before coming to that recognition I don't think so .
but I don't know can't call him up and ask him .
so he set to work on yet another &~o overture for the projected eighteen eight revival in Prague and wrote a fourth .
in eighteen fourteen which as many of you will know gave Robert Schumann one of his most celebrated bon_mots comparing Beethoven with Rossini and by extension German industriousness with Italian slothfulness .
Beethoven had written four overtures for one opera .
whereas Rossini typically wrote one overture for four operas .
&=laughs:multiple (0.5) we credit or blame Gustav Mahler with initiating the curious practice of playing Leonore three to cover the last scene change in act two of Fidelio .
&-uh this is still done &-uh all too frequently and in my view gives us too much of a good thing .
I think it's probably better all around to enjoy Leonore three as a concert overture or as a proto@n tone poem which condenses and concentrates the crucial events of the opera into compelling symphonic form .
our next work up questions though before Mister_Arnhem ?
so who just opus one thirty eight the posthumous it you don't think it was the first one written is that +/.
third one +/.
+, okay .
but .
the posthumously discovered one yeah .
yeah +/.
+, it was judged to the be the first on the basis of &-uh of rather shaky stylistic analysis in which I don't think I'm doing too much disservice to the breakdown into the dumb argument gee it doesn't seem as good as to therefore it must be earlier than .
what would be the what would be the the Latin ?
peus@s:fra peus@s:fra hoc@s:fra propter@s:fra &-uh earlier hoc@s:fra or something &=laughs:multiple but yeah .
questions <over here> ?
alright next work up is opus fifty seven .
which is well just sort of start us off on .
please bring as many scores as you can next time and we will have at it with this sonata which is one of Beethoven's best known sonatas along with the Waldstein opus fifty three .
two sonatas &-uh both cast in Beethoven's heroic mold both showing massive massive proportions despite their three movement layout .
when you're writing movements this big &-uh you don't hafta put forth there of_course they don't tell the whole story of Beethoven's concern with the piano during the Eroica years I mean to round out the picture we really would need to consider &-uh and maybe next time we +//.
I I should really do this .
&-uh look at the two movement sonata in F major opus fifty four which is this &-uh tempo_di_minuetto@s:ita first movement and a very spare toccatalike allegretto .
this is the sonata that Beethoven himself prized a_lot more highly than subsequent commentators whose critical vision's all too often skewed by the big works .
but still the Waldstein and the Appassionata as we call them seem to reflect a kind_of a a spillover from the heroic symphonic vein approached in the Eroica back into the keyboard sonata .
&-uh the Waldstein was sketched in the same notebook as the Eroica probably starting the spring of eighteen four .
the Appassionata was probably composed in eighteen five more or less as a complementary pair with its modal opposite the diminutive F major opus fifty four .
pianists who want to consider programming both of them in a single recital might do well to consider it .
and of_course the designation Appassionata was not Beethoven's &-uh a publisher in Hamburg added this word to the title of an arrangement for piano four hands .
in eighteen thirty eight .
thinking that it was a way of opening up the Appassionata to a wider market .
give it a flashy title and arrange it for four hands so normal people +//.
but this is an apt qualifier .
and it testifies to the strong connection perceived between the expression of passion in the sense of suffering and the character usually attributed to the key F minor .
now when we look at this I'm not gonna proceed &-uh measure by measure through this sonata .
&-uh but I want to gather the observations I do make around &-uh two headings or under two headings .
I might as well put (th)em down here just to &-um suggest things for you to watch out for .
&=writes:board process and disruption which I'm going to disrupt because I don't have enough room to write .
&=laughs well xxx process and disruption will be two of the three key phrases to keep in mind through this .
because I think to an extent &-uh anticipated in the other sonatas but not so fully realized before .
this sonata deals with volcanic musical and emotional forces and such volcanic forces demand extraordinary means for continuity and containment if they are to constitute anything like an artistic whole +...
I said those were two of the phrases .
the third is Neapolitan antagonism .
(0.11) &=musical_example_playing (0.13) that was the first theme .
shadowy .
immaterial .
pianissimo in unison two octaves apart .
a ghoulish sonority if ever there was one .
&=laughs comprising two motivic elements an arpeggio and a half cadential trill .
the latter motive being as you heard openended harmonically .
and after an appropriately pregnant pause the same idea is heard one half step higher .
okay ?
it's not unlike what we heard at the beginning of the C minor piano trio .
&=plays_piano okay ?
but now elevated to the level of the phrase .
right ?
okay it's not just a local detail but a sharp harmonic conflict .
and intensified to include contrast of minor versus major mode and once again even more bluntly than before well about as bluntly as in the Kreutzer Beethoven is challenging the whole concept of what we understand to be a key area because he's giving us a <sharp harmonic> conflict .
&=musical_example_playing (0.19) well <which is it> which is it gonna be ?
oh (0.6) &=plays:piano a concise summary &=laughs:multiple of what the conflict is about .
right ?
Neapolitan antagonism .
you will find that that half step antagonism is carried out at every functionally important pitch level and indeed drives the entire movement .
I'm summarizing that knocking figure that I just played for you .
so have at opus fifty seven for next what's today ?
Thursday ?
for next Tuesday .
and bring a score if you can lay hands on one and we will look at process and disruption in all three movements of this work
