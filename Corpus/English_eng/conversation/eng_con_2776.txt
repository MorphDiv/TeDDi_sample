this is the Harry <A> Blackmun Supreme Court Oral History
my name is Harold Hongju Koh .
I'm a professor at Yale Law School and a former law clerk to
this is session number eight on June <two> , <nineteen
it's being held at the Federal Judicial Center in Washington ,
we had just discussed probably your most enjoyable case , which was
I wanted to ask you about a case that was very difficult for you at
what was your memory of that case ?
well , that was one of the early cases we had concerning the death
we didn't get into the death penalty in depth .
I wrote a dissent .
the case was well argued , rather excruciating at the time , and
it seemed to me the main argument was that the statute was vague .
I hope my memory is correct , but I think the Court reversed the
not an easy case .
in that case , the oral argument involved for the state a woman who
do you remember anything about the argument ?
yes , I do , generally .
I think the woman to whom you refer is Margie Pitts Hames , I
yes .
at least she defended in Doe against Bolton .
professor Amsterdam was always a very serious , earnest advocate .
there never was any humor in him when he argued , but one knew
I always welcomed him and have missed him .
it's been a long time since he's argued in the Court in my last
but is this the case where finally we came down to “death is
yes .
I don't know why there was some delay in getting to that statement
death is different .
whether he felt it weakened his position or not , I do not know ,
in your dissenting opinion , you said , +"/.
+" this case subjects me to an excruciating agony of the spirit .
and then later you said , +"/.
+" I yield to no one in the depth of my distaste , antipathy , and
but you still voted to uphold it in that circumstance .
did your personal feelings about the death penalty change at all
no , I think it remained the same .
I guess I was willing at that time to rely somewhat on legislative
do you think at the time you had more faith in the fair
yes , at least to the extent of letting the states have a try at it
that was obviously a mistaken position to take , because in later
when Furman <v@l> Georgia was decided , you had probably
do you think that that experience made a difference ?
oh , yes , I'm sure it did .
it is true that we were just in the beginning of the death penalty
how I would vote on that case today , of course , is an interesting
let me ask you about a couple of other things from that term .
this was the term when the “cert pool” began , the system of pooled
how did that get started ?
well , of course , this is recollection on my part , but it was
from then on , the so-called pool developed , and as I remember ,
into effect .
now , I believe , as each new justice has come on the court , the
I was not disturbed about the arguments against the pool at the
if a mistake is made in the pool , it is made for five justices ,
but I don't know of any disaster that ever developed from it .
what procedures did you put in place in your own chambers to
I don't recall that particularly , but the clerks always were able
so they annotated the pool memos for you ?
yes .
sure .
were those annotations lengthy ?
no .
very brief .
I think we made progress on it , saved a lot of time .
who were some of the justices who were not in the pool , and how
Douglas , of course , was one of those who were not on the pool ,
I hope this comment isn't misunderstood .
he often disagreed with Chief Justice Burger , I felt sometimes
here in this pile of papers is a letter from Douglas to the chief
+" I have your memorandum concerning the pooling of law clerk
that is , in forma pauperis cases .
+" I do not desire to be included in the project for the following
and he lists two or three .
number one , however , +"/.
+" I like to go over these petitions personally .
+" they are interesting and absorbing and , for me , much more
+" two , with all respect to the strong differing views which you
and he referred to a lecture he had given to that effect .
William <O> Douglas loved to work on that theme , because
justice Douglas always took the other position , said it was a job
but anything to disagree with the chief justice .
this brings me to another case of that term , Sierra Club <v@l>
at least initially , it would have seemed that you and Justice
what do you remember much about that case ?
as I recall , this is the case and I'd feel a little more
his thesis was that inanimate objects should be given standing
I wasn't entirely ready to go that far , but I was impressed with
I just wasn't ready to take that rather unusual step that he took
do you think he was surprised that on this point you would be a
no , I don't think so .
now , whether I was a supporter of his is something else .
at least we were on the same side of the case ; we were in dissent
do you remember much about the summer after that first term ?
you told the Eighth Circuit that it was even more tiring than your
how did you feel about being on the Court at that point ?
well , my comment to the Eighth Circuit was a sincere one , and I
I know in my notes is a comment to the effect near the end of the
said it was the roughest term that he had experienced .
there were just a lot of big cases .
I may have mistaken when I say Hugo Black .
anyway , someone in there fully agreed with me .
I think Hugo had departed by that time .
you've now established a kind of a holiday or vacation schedule
do you remember how you spent the time after the first full term on
well , I got home , as I call it , out to the Midwest after <O_T>
I never cut those off the way one or two of the justices did ,
+" don't send them to me .
+" I'll do them in September when I get back .
I wanted to do them currently , and that was , for me , the only
but the summer was a welcome time of “relaxation” .
I put that in quotations because the pool memos kept coming along ,
when you returned for October term in <nineteen seventy-two>
the case was United States <v@l> Kras , which involved
well , I wrote the opinion in <U_S> against Kras .
the government had appealed , or had applied for cert , anyway ,
the Court upheld it .
I wrote the opinion .
I probably wrote in language that was too strong .
as I remember , I thought the &=dollar <fifty> didn't amount
if they gave up a couple of packs a day , why , they'd have the
that was not well received in certain quarters .
potter Stewart wrote a dissent which he ended up , as I recall ,
+" some people are too poor even to go into bankruptcy .
this kind of thing .
but one interesting development afterwards is that Mister
another case of that term was Miller <v@l> California ,
how was the Court dealing with these cases during this time ?
well , the pornography cases gave us a lot of trouble , and the
so for the most part , seven of us , anyway , felt that if we were
justice Brennan and Justice Douglas didn't bother about it ,
so they didn't go to these viewings that we had .
I well remember they were usually shown in some room down on the
it was full of law clerks and everyone else who wanted to see this
but I remember one time Justice Harlan was there , sitting with his
of course , his eyesight was almost totally gone , and it was hard
I sat right behind him , and as the film moved on and they're
law clerk , +"/.
+" and what are they doing now ?
and the law clerk would describe it , and Justice Harlan would say
+" you don't say .
+" you don't say .
well , it was funny and difficult , but such was the Miller case .
chief Justice Burger , as I recall , wrote that case and felt that
in a separate writing , Potter Stewart said that he didn't know how
another Potter Stewart one-liner that he was so fond of and which
when is something obscene ?
I don't know .
do you think you adopted some of Potter Stewart's writing style ?
that I did ?
yes , later in your career you were known for some of these
“poor Joshua” and things like that .
I never thought of myself as adopting his style .
poor Joshua ?
poor Joshua .
it wasn't a final line , anyway .
it was the beginning , I think , of a last paragraph .
the beginning of the paragraph , not the end of it .
in Miller against California , did that involve a film ?
I thought it did .
I could be wrong , but I thought it did .
what happened with the exhibits in these cases ?
that was always a question , of course .
we'd call for the exhibits .
if we wanted to see the film , we had to get them .
then there was one case , I guess maybe it was the Miller case ,
but some of these exhibits were pretty juicy stuff .
I have here a letter from an assistant clerk to all the law .

this is dated February <nine> , <nineteen seventy-two>
it reads , +"/.

of course , some of them never did show up , and I think the Chief
<mister> Justice , this brings us now to the case for which
roe began in that term , but didn't conclude until the term after ,
when you were at the Mayo Clinic , did you have any contact there
very little , as I recall .
the clinic , of course , was not , and did not wish to be , an
all of that developed later with the cases preliminary to Roe
do you think that the doctors of the Mayo Clinic had a medical view
well , if they did , it was certainly not uniform , and they
as a matter of fact , some of the nastiest letters I received after
nearly all of them approved of Roe against Wade , but not all of
the first abortion case that you heard on the Court was a case
yes , rather a narrow case because it involved just the <D_C>
the lower court , as I recall , had said that the statute was
it didn't get into the substantive issue at all .
it was more of a procedural thing .
did you feel at the conference that as someone who had exposure to
on these kinds of issues ?
I didn't feel that way , no , and if I had , I wouldn't have been
did the Court know that these other abortion cases were coming up
was this something that was clearly foreshadowed ?
the Court knew when we were reduced to a seven-person court , after
but we were aware of that because in that fall , the chief justice
the chief justice appointed a screening committee , of which
our task was to review the list of cases that were ready for
that meant we had to set some aside .
on that list was Roe against Wade , and we didn't set it aside .
I don't know why we didn't set it aside .
I think probably the implication , the obvious implication , is
so Roe against Wade was initially heard by just seven of us .
the result of that screening committee's work , I suppose , was not
each time the clerk wondered whether we should note them for
I recall no great disturbance about it .
do you remember having any sort of feeling that this case was going
well , certainly not at the beginning and not at the first argument
it ended up I hope I'm correct in my recollection it ended
there were three that were firm .
justice White and Justice Rehnquist were firm in their feeling
but the rest of us , particularly the chief justice , Burger at the
the first argument was on December <thirteen> , <nineteen
just before the holidays , yes .
there were two cases , the Texas case , Roe against Wade , and then
correct .
do you remember much about the arguments ?
yes .
there were four oralists , of course , and it took an entire
of the oralists , three were women .
the sole male was an assistant attorney general of Texas defending
but the women were Sarah Weddington , who argued in opposition to
I felt at the time that the argument the first time around was not
one thing primarily disturbed me .
I asked Miss Hames , “What about the Hippocratic Oath” ?
and her response was , “Well , it's irrelevant” .
“why should it be relevant” ?
and I reminded her that the Hippocratic Oath , in most of its
+" shall not deliver a pessary to a woman .
and it seemed to me that was rather pertinent and not irrelevant .
the answer was that the Hippocratic Oath didn't mean a great deal .
but none of the briefs , as I recall , and certainly in none of the
what I got was what I just described ; that it was “irrelevant” .
as far as I was concerned , it wasn't irrelevant , because having
it is one of the traditions of the medical profession .
and also I had attended a number of medical school graduations
so as far as I was concerned , it had not reached the stage of
did any of the four arguments make a big impact on you ?
not the first time , no .
it's interesting that Sarah Weddington apparently was counting you
were you undecided , coming into the argument , or do you think you
no , I wasn't as firm as Brennan was , for example , and certainly
do you remember much about the first conference ?
I'm confused now .
rehnquist wasn't on the Court at that point .
right .
who was the other one that was oh , the chief justice , I think
how do you think you came to receive the assignment ?
well , that's a long story , I suppose , and I have a little speech
+" the Anatomy of Roe against Wade .
which takes it from the beginning to the decision itself , of how
my comments are largely speculative , but I think they're correct ,
after the first vote , the chief justice suggested that I write a
but it was assigned to me .
now , that's evading your question of why it was assigned to me .
again I'm speculating , but one can go down the list of the
I think at the conference , after the first argument , the chief
there were personal reasons also , family reasons , I think .
you go to Douglas , Bill Douglas , I think , wanted the case , and
I think Bill was in the waning years of his service , and was not
and furthermore , he was under attack in the House of
one goes down .
should Brennan write it ?
brennan at that time was the only Roman Catholic on the Court , and
do you think he wanted to write it ?
no , I don't think he did , but I think he was firm in his view .
one can go down the same way with Thurgood Marshall .
he was the only black African American , as we say now on
I think it would have been hard and a little unfair .
one can go all the way down the line .
some have speculated that you asked for the assignment .
did you ?
no .
I never asked for an opinion in my life , as I remember , my theory
there have been at least two accounts of this case , one by David
both of them report that Douglas thought that he was going to
have you ever heard this before , or does this ring true ?
say that again , Professor Koh .
the accounts say that at the first conference , it was confused as
Douglas , therefore , assumed that he would make the assignment as
so you would have gotten the assignment either way .
I can't vouch for the veracity of that .
the chief justice was uncertain in his vote , and there's no
if Douglas took the position that you've just described , it would
had you gotten good assignments from Douglas when he was the senior
well , I certainly can't remember of any disgruntlement with his
I don't have a positive feeling about whether they were good
I think Bill Douglas was always fair about it .
he didn't pay too much attention to assigning anyway .
if he wanted to write , he'd write , and if anybody else wanted to
justice Brennan later , Bill Brennan always immediately made his
bill Douglas never did .
he may get on the phone , but never otherwise .
from the point at which you were asked to write this initial memo ,
not a great deal of time .
I finally got around to circulating something , and then when I
I didn't delay on that motion .
that , of course , in itself provoked a good bit of controversy .
justice Douglas was very vehemently opposed to reargument .
I think he felt that well , we had seven persons that in
it was purely a pragmatic approach on his opposition .
do you think he read your call for reargument as suggesting that
maybe so .
it's hard for me to put myself in Bill Douglas's head and try to
did you , in fact , feel open to be persuaded differently at that
well , the memo indicated I had certainly made up my mind , but I
did you have a sense of how you wanted to pursue this research if
say that again .
did you have a sense of how you were going to go about doing this
I was going to do the research whether or not the case , on
of course , the ideal place , in my mind at the time , was to get
so how did you do the research ?
well , that summer after the vote was taken and the case was set
some commentators say I spent the whole summer ; well , they're
but I spent ten days there , and no one on the Mayo staff knew what
they knew I was there , and they knew I was in the library , but
they knew because of the books I was calling for .
what kind of books did you call for ?
anything that had to do with the Hippocratic Oath , mainly .
and that's a superb library .
it had everything I wanted .
it's all set out in the Roe against Wade opinion .
who was your clerk during this period ?
well , I had more than one , but George Frampton was the clerk , as
<mister> Frampton was the son of a professor of law at the
I think I'm correct in that .
he did a lot of good , solid work on the opinion .
this is quite an unusual situation , where you'd be working on an
how did you communicate back and forth with George Frampton about

when I'm away in the summertime , I'm on the phone in my office
it's a rare day that we're not in communication .
George did a yeoman piece of work in some parts of the opinion , as
people who have seen the first draft , the one that you presented
but when you returned from the summer , the new draft opinion was

I think the summer research was very worthwhile , as far as I was
of course , it fortified my own views .
I didn't know how the Court would go in reargument , and I
I suppose it was likely to be reassigned to me if I was on the

maybe discovering the monograph written by , I think , a Professor

well , I think the reargument was better than the first argument ,
but again , it was extraordinarily unhelpful as far as the

the men in each of the arguments were somewhat overwhelmed , I
in rating the advocates , who was the best ?
oh , I don't think I can do that , because and I hope , again ,
I think if one reads the opinion as finally evolved , it is
Sarah Weddington , of course , has made a lot of the argument .
she's written a book on it , as I recall , and has gone about the

I'm not certain of what I'm about to say , but I think the Texas
it was easy to pick Roe against Wade as an example .
I can't separate it particularly from some of the other cases , but
when you came back from the summer research , had you reduced your
how were you using the research at that point ?
had you written it up ?
I beefed it up , certainly .
I haven't looked in the file about it , but I'm sure I did a
did you talk to your wife about the case ?
+, no .
a lot of people think that because we have three daughters , and
but Dottie , <Mrs> Blackmun , and I seldom discuss issues
we might discuss certain arguments , because she's interested in
she didn't lobby you about this case ?
not at all .
very definitely not at all .
and your daughters also didn't lobby you ?
exactly .
when you came back and the reargument was held , then the

well , certainly not before the argument , and I don't recall any
of course , they went in opposite directions , so it didn't make

well , not any more with him at that time , than with any of the

why don't we pick up at this point with the start of the next tape
I want to ask you at the start of the next tape about whether
do you want me to answer that now ?
sure .
I think the answer , as with Justice Rehnquist , is in the negative
this was a very emotional , difficult issue , and that it would be

all right
