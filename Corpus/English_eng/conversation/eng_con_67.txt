they say the police was checking doors one night .
and he saw came across a man .
and they say that the man was wearing a long coat .
I think .
he went from door to door knocking to discover if a man was hurt .
and came to a conclusion .
his name was Jimmy .

you know my grandparents raised me .
I used to be real sick when I was young .
they use to take me to a doctor .
I used to have fever and chills .
but the doctor came to a conclusion that I had to have my
so the hospital in xxx South Carolina .
I went there and they took out my tonsils .
when I came out of the operation I coughed up quite a bit of blood .
