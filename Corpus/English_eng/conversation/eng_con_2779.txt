<mister> Justice , at Chief Justice Warren's funeral , a
I'm wondering if you could tell me more about that picture .
well , yes .
I'm not the only one that has that photograph .
it's a photograph of the justices standing on the steps of the main
because they were standing on the steps , it meant that .
each one was on a step higher than the next one .
they were all standing there , waiting for the hearse to arrive
it's interesting because they're lined up in protocol order , and
most unusual , really , to catch the Court in that kind of a
there it is .
in fact , on that day , that very day , the Court was in the middle
what do you remember about the chiefs initial circulations in the
well , we were all under time pressure for various personal reasons
here it was in the middle of the summer and an <eighth> of
there was desire , I think , on the part of all of us to get the

and he announced , as I recall , that because of this , he would
it might be that what he wanted as part three would come out before
so we sat around , and I suppose the clerks of the rest of us were
+" Joe , come on .
+" let's get this material out .
and it gradually began to emerge .
that's no way to write an opinion , of course .
everybody realizes it and knows it , and it's unfair to the writer
it was a very difficult period for the chief justice .
the opinion as it ultimately appeared had several different
the first part was the facts ; the second part was about whether
as all of these sections came out , how did the justices respond ?
did they join in the whole thing , or how did the process of
well , we did it piecemeal , I suppose , and what happened ,

+" I agree with it .
or , +"/.
+" why don't you add a few sentences here and there and the other
or , +"/.

but we did it with respect to each segment .
both The Brethren and John Jeffries' account report that there was
is this true ?
yes , I would say it was .
part of it due , I think , to the fact they were restless , wanted
one would say maybe there was a palace revolution at the time , but
which part were you responsible for ?
it so developed that , as I think the authors of The Brethren
as these various sections developed , were these being passed
the chief was continuing to work on his part of the opinion , or
well , I think he was upset , and understandably so , I think ,
it was the kind of a situation that was ready-made for resentment
do you ever recall a moment where you went and spoke to the chief
as I recall and my recollection is a little hazy I think he
+, what did he say , do you remember ?
he wasn't very happy about it .
what did you say ?
well , I said I thought the facts needed revision , and we did it .
they were assigned to me by the others .
it may have been a point of great distress to the chief justice .
do you think that he was upset with you about this ?
oh , yes , I'm sure he was .
did this become a lingering source of difference between the two of
I suppose so .
you'll have to ask the former chief about it , but I would assume
as I say , it was a situation that was built for resentments and
many people say that it was this period between Roe <v@l>
do you think that's true ?
oh , I think there's an element of truth in it , and I'm sure that
did you continue to see the chief every day at your workout at the
that's a hard one to answer , because we did see each other every
many times we were there together , but not always .
now while I still go down there , I never see him , and I guess he
did you ever harken back to your old grade-school days ?
oh , I'm sure we must have mentioned it once in a while .
that was a long time ago .
as the various sections of the opinion emerged with the chief's
as usual .
did people think that Douglas was going to write on his own ?
well , I suppose nobody knew exactly what Douglas was going to do ,
he must have been out there .
I don't recall whether he returned well , he returned , I'm
I shouldn't be misunderstood .
there were elements of the chief's writing in this case which were
the chief sent a memo to the conference , which is in the file ,

was there a tremendous pressure in the Court at this time to get
yes .
yes , there was , distinctly .
there were certain promises or intonations of promises , anyway ,
I'm sympathetic to the position of the chief justice .
it was certainly not an easy situation under which to try to get a
the others took over in large part , not entirely .
were other justices , in fact , meeting with each other , or was it
at which meeting ?
were there , in fact , face-to-face meetings among the justices to

I would say most of it by memo .
whether there were little private caucuses among two or three
I was never a party to any of that , but maybe there were some .
the Brethren , again , reports that on July <twenty-third>
I guess that in a memo by Justice White that's in the file , he
do you remember this ?
yes , I remember generally .
again , all of us wanted to have a unanimous opinion , and yet none
you said July <twenty-third> .
when did the opinion come down ?
I thought it was the <twenty-fourth> .
yes , the very next day .
I don't recall the details of that conference , but I'm sure some
I'm not sure it's a very good opinion .
one could hardly be written and be good under the circumstances as
another point which is mentioned was some concern about the chief
do you remember this issue corning up ?
oh , I remember some general talk about it , but nothing very
I can understand why he would be concerned .
did you expect that the impeachment would go forward and that the
well , it was touch and go at that time , generally .
touch and go .
and President Ford , of course , when he came along , gave the
when one looks at the file , again the final version of the opinion
do you think the chief justice was resentful of these changes ?
oh , I'm sure he didn't like it very well .
maybe it reached the point of resentment .
chief Justice Burger , understandably , is a very proud person , as
it must have been as difficult a summer as he's ever lived
did he ever talk about it afterwards ?
no , I don't think so .
was this , in your experience , unique , an opinion being drafted
yes .
yes , I would say .
all eight , I guess .
it's no way to write an opinion .
in the end , the core holding of the case is that there is a
I want to ask you about two parts of this .
many feel that Justice Powell's view was for a stronger executive
in later cases , Justice Powell wrote for the president on
do you think that Justice Powell was more pro-executive power on
yes , I think so .
he'd be the one to ask , but I think that's a fair assumption .
another strand was Justice White's insistence that the president be
do you think that this is something that was consistent with his
oh , I suppose .
you don't give me any room to answer that one , really .
I guess what I'm curious about is here Justice White was ; himself
yes , he was indeed .
he was indeed .
in these kinds of cases , he seemed to be pretty tough on the
that's correct .
one could almost say there was a little political overtone in Byron
Byron , of course , is an experienced politician , and not far back
what do you think he thinks of Nixon ?
what do I think +/.
Byron White thinks of Nixon .
+, thinks of Nixon ?
this is about third-hand speculation here , isn't it ?
third-level speculation .
that's right .
triple hearsay .
I think he didn't think very much of him .
of course , politically they were in opposite camps , of course .
shortly before the opinion issued , there was a story in the
do you have any idea of where this came from ?
do you remember this story ?
there are lots of stories in the Washington Post , and a lot of
but , no , I do not know where that came from .
some reporter probably got an idea .
do you remember the day that the case was announced and what the
I don't have any particularly distinct recollection of that day .
I can't say any more than that , I think .
the courtroom was crowded ; as it always is when there's something
+, did you feel awkward , as a Nixon appointee , as they called you
no .
I felt one has to call the shots as he sees them , and , of course
I suppose there were times when he wondered about it , maybe
the Jeffries' account of Powell's biography reports that Nixon
did you ever subsequently communicate with Nixon in any way , or
after what event ?
after the announcement of the <U_S> <v@l> Nixon
I don't think so .
I don't think so .
of course I think the answer to that is definitely no .
but you must bear in mind , I suppose , that John Jeffries , of
whether the book is slanted a little bit or not is not for me to .
say , but there are those who have said it .
I'm glad it was written , and there it is .
eight hours after the opinion appeared , the White House announced
yes .
+, and went home to San Clemente .
do you remember hearing that news , and your response to it ?
did it come as a surprise to you ?
oh , I suppose it came as a surprise , as it did to the entire
those were exciting , exciting days in some respects , and I
one looks back , I think it was Art Buchwald , in one of his
it just moved along without a show of militarism , and he did it in
do you remember anything about the swearing-in of Gerald Ford as
were you around at that point or were you away ?
I guess I it seems to me I can remember it on television ,
we haven't talked about your feelings about Gerald Ford .
had you known him at all ?
he's another Midwesterner .
no .
he's another Midwesterner , of course , but I don't know everybody
just everybody in Minnesota .
yes .
one could talk about the pardon that he gave Mister Nixon
I think it took a lot of courage to do that , to do it as early as
do you think that was a wise move , in retrospect ?
oh , I thought about it a good bit .
<one> think it saved the country from some convulsive
but on balance , I think it was the right move .
that's my personal reaction to it .
do you think Gerald Ford grew in the office of president and turned
yes , I think so .
and did you have any personal contact with him during his
no , other than maybe a state dinner or so here and there , and the
did you yourself ever listen to any of the Nixon tapes ?
no .
that is , not during that period , certainly .
now and then part of one has been played that I've listened to ,
do you think that Nixon would have been convicted , had he not been
your guess is as good as mine .
I guess I'd better not try to answer that question .
well , then I'll ask another one .
do you think he would have been impeached ?
yes , probably so .
he would have been impeached ?
I think so .
that doesn't mean convicted ; just impeached .
right .
what do you think of his legacy in the end Nixon ?
well , one can't overlook the history of the twentieth century of
he was a major figure for better or for worse , whatever it was .
he was president of the United States and was decisively elected at
there he was , a combination of the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket .
it always sort of amused me and made me wonder a little bit ,
what Ike thought of Richard Nixon , I do not know , but it was a
I guess there's an irony in that Nixon passed away the year that
do you ever wonder what he ended up thinking of your appointment ?
what Mister Nixon did ?
yes .
yes , I've wondered and a lot of other people have wondered , too ,
in your own conversations with Nixon , am I right that you only
I think that's correct .
did you have a sense of his personality ?
well , he certainly had a strong personality and knew it and
he , in some respects , was , I suppose , defensive .
he knew there were a lot of critics out there .
but the few times that I had to be with him , he was nice to me ,
he's been described as a clumsy person .
as a what ?
as a clumsy person or an awkward personality .
was that your experience ?
no , I wouldn't use those adjectives .
I think he gave the impression , when one was with him , of being ,
there would be people who would disagree with what I'm going to say
why do you think he participated in the whole Watergate cover-up ?
why do I think he what ?
participated in the whole cover-up .
I suppose there were deep considerations , far deeper than I'm able
another irony here was that Gerald Ford ended up appointing the
how do you think Justice Douglas felt about Gerald Ford becoming
did he ever comment on this ?
not that I recall .
there might have been a caustic comment here and there that I've
things were happening so fast and these were vitally important
I would suspect that other people were in the same boat .
the Court then came almost immediately to <O_T>
yes , that's right .
how do you think this all played out the next term , having had
well , as you say , we came almost immediately .
looking over my notes , I just noted a few here .
justice Douglas had declined in physical ability , and it became
he retired , as I remember , on November <twelve> ,
I remember it because it was my birthday .
to watch his physical and mental abilities decline was sad , and he
you may remember facilities had been made so long as he was on the
was anyone ever deputized to ask him to resign ?
oh , I don't think so , although he must have sensed it and it must
but there were other things that I've noted down here .
that term was the term of the chief justice's bicycle accident ,
thurgood Marshall was ill with pneumonia .
Douglas had his cerebral vascular accident .
it was also , as I recall , a term with a number of securities
there's always something that characterizes a term .
but the relationships , I think , among those of us on the Court
we kidded each other a good bit , sailed along , and it could not
I think we sailed along , knew that we had to get along together ,
while the disagreements were full blown , we got along all right .
I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about Justice
well , I've quoted it in a number of speeches and use it .
I think it is pure William <O> Douglas at his best .
I think it's a remarkable letter .
of course , the question is raised , how could he have written it
that raises the question , was it written beforehand ?
but I , for one , think it's a splendid letter .
I like to read it every once in a while .
it's in the <U_S> Reports .
what is the theme of the letter ?
well , I think one ought to read it before I comment on it .
it covers the duties of the Court , what a privilege it is to be
friendly letter as only he could write it when he wanted to .
coming when it did , did it have a healing quality from this person
I think I could say , yes , it had a healing quality to it , but
he had a lot of facets to his personality .
how are these farewell letters distributed ?
do you all read them at the same time or are they sent to your
I haven't the least idea .
with mine , I just wrote it and circulated it to the chambers , is
so do you remember when you first saw Justice Douglas's farewell
you weren't with the others ?
you just got it in your chambers ?
I think so .
I think that's been my experience with all of them .
of course , I'm not sure they're necessary , and yet I think one
yes .
a time to say thank you .
what did you know about John Paul Stevens , who was William <O>
I didn't know a great deal about him .
I had met him , it seemed to me , on at least one occasion when I
I was invited out to speak , and I remember meeting him at the time
I like a bow tie .
I have a long face that kind of cuts it off and helps , and I wear
but as I remember and I don't believe I'm mistaken as to this
I was not invited , the rest of us weren't invited , but I think at
of course , Stevens was there , along with others .
it turned out that he was selected .
whether the dinner party was something the president thought would
he is often considered to be a maverick , as well , maybe like or
what has been your experience with Justice Stevens ?
well , I think he's a little bit of a maverick .
of course , as with all of us , he votes and he calls the shots as
he'll vote in a way that one doesn't expect him to vote .
but that makes it exciting .
he's such a pleasant person , I can't be critical of his judicial
do you think he's moved , since he came on the Court , to the left
oh , one has to grow here one way or another , either the left or
of course , now he's senior associate and , I think , has a lot of
he asks a tremendous number of questions at oral argument .
do you find his questions to be illuminating or useful ?
how did he develop this style ?
well , , he asks a good number of questions .
he doesn't ask nearly so many as Justice Scalia asks or Justice
I think since they've come on the Court and have gone into the
justice Stevens is one of the only justices to join the Court who
do you know why , or did he ever explain his reasoning ?
no , other than I think it's well that we had some chambers that
I think it also is a mark of his independence .
he prepares cases for argument in his own way , and I think it's
I can't tell you why I say that particularly , but John Paul is
how well could you predict how he would vote ?
as you look back over the justices you've known , are there some
oh , yes .
sure .
nearly always I know how , or knew how , the chief justice , or
in the earlier years , less so with Justice Stevens , although in
one thing that he did quite quickly was to join on to your side of
is that something that you ever discussed one on one ?
no .
did you ever have any sort of conversations with Justice Stevens
no .
I remember when his nomination came along , he wrote and asked
+" these are .
+" the things maybe you should watch for and be prepared for .
and he wrote back a fairly long letter about it , saying he
it's not easy .
it wasn't anything like what Justice Thomas had to go through , but
<mister> Justice , I'm wondering if you could comment on
here it was coming up to <nineteen seventy-five> .
you had been on the Court for about five years .
the president who had appointed you had stepped down .
there were now three juniors to you in seniority .
you had been the author of Roe <v@l> Wade .
you had voted against the president who had appointed you , in the
did you feel in some way you were entering a different phase of
were you feeling more comfortable with yourself as a justice ?
well , the last part of your question is the easiest .
for some reason it has always taken me from three to five years to
this was true when I left the practice and went to Mayos , and when
it has always taken me that long to feel comfortable .
thus , in answer to your question , with five years behind , I was
as one tries to wind his way through these issues that were being
but as you're there for five years , I think that you're settled
at least it becomes more comfortable in that way .
did you ever think , during those first five years , about how long
you ended up sitting twenty-four years .
did you ever dream at that time that you would sit for twenty-four
well , I certainly didn't think I'd last that long .
it seems to me I was about sixty-one when I was appointed ,
I suppose the minimum age is in mid-forties , somewhere in there ,
usually go for a younger person because then their influence will
but , no , I never thought I'd be active that long .
how long do you think it takes for a justice to make his or her
do you think there's a minimum time of service that's necessary
yes , I suppose so , unless one is very obstreperous and makes a
there haven't been many instances of that kind .
I think it must take five to ten years to be regarded as a person
the members of the Court are always strong characters , they're
I was always surprised every time a new person came on , the
just one person .
and that's part of the interesting aspect of the Supreme Court .
+, with Justice Stevens' arrival , you now had two members of the
subsequently , other justices have come on who clerked Justice
do you think that justices who have been law clerks have some sort
I don't know about that , but I think they like to feel there's a
of course , nearly everybody else not everyone , but nearly
the ones you mentioned , of course , are ones who had a clerkship
I should have mentioned Justice Rehnquist as well , clerking for
yes .
yes .
and the ones I've known have never hesitated to speak , +"/.
+" well , when I was a clerk for Justice So-and-so , this happened
but I think it's well to have had that experience .
it can't do any harm ; you know how the Court operates .
I don't believe it's essential .
you've mentioned to me that <O_T> <nineteen seventy-four>
can you tell me a little bit about this ?
I don't know .
it was just one of those funny little things where when one justice
there were some others .
we worked up a nickname for Lewis Powell for a while , calling him
I suppose to lighten the atmosphere every now and then , why , we
were you ever teased ?
no , I don't think I was .
it didn't get down to me .
I was fairly junior and , I hope , not too consistent in my voting
you've also made reference to a case in the <fourteen> term
I'm wondering if you could tell us about that .
as I recall and my recollection is a little hazy , but the case
one of us asked it might have been I , I don't know +"/.
+" what about you , counsel ?
+" you're a citizen of Texas .
+" did you file a personal property tax return ?
+" yes , and I must concede that mine was not complete either .
it affected his case to a degree , but it showed that everybody
I thought it was really very funny that he admitted it in open
but those things happen .
do you find these moments of humor leaven the tension of these
I think they do , generally .
I remember one supposedly pornography case in which counsel was
and I couldn't help but look up at the frieze , the frieze around
I asked if he thought that frieze was pornographic .
he had no answer for it whatsoever .
he said , “I've never noticed it before” .
was he stunned to see it up there ?
oh , I suppose so , but I was aware of it because when I'd get
<mister> Justice , on that note , I think we ought to
we'll take up next time with some of the other cases of the term
