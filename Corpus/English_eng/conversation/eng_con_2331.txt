and &-um &=tsks just the way they look . 806028_809118

like ‡ I know when I was little I had thousands of barbie dolls . 812468_816018
but to you they mighta all looked the same and to me they didn't

I like watching people on tv . 863727_865477
I like to see interviews too, like on OWN, on a Oprah . 865707_868917
like ‡ when she's interviewing like people like John_Legend,
so ‡ that's my channel I go to when I really wanna learn somebody's
and everybody's different so it's good to +//. 882725_886085
&=tsks like ‡ if there's a person you don't like +//. 886169_889229
like okay like ‡ I wouldn't say I don't like her but (be)cause

agree „ okay . 918699_919679
mhm . 920078_920488

how much do you think family affect a person's you_know outcome,
I think <that's the biggest> <that's the biggest> &-um
what's the word I'm looking for ? 946292_947302
that's the place where you learn how to do everything and how the
and &-um sometimes if you come from a dangerous background, you so
you_know ‡ (be)cause you don't have that perspective . 966420_968760
you don't have that person telling you like +"/. 968782_970242

Atlanta is becoming like a melting pot of a_lot_of different types
tell me about growing up in neighborhoods in New_York . 1188994_1193054
what type of neighborhood <were you grow up> have you grown up
&-um when I was younger I was living in Redacted_address . 1196484_1199274
&-um that's part of Brooklyn . 1200216_1201716
&-um Redacted_address ‡ do or die . 1202192_1204322
home of Biggie_Smalls . 1205014_1206154
&=laughs yeah . 1207180_1207410
and Jay_Z down a couple blocks in Redacted_address projects
and it was really bad around that time „ so . 1211038_1213888
mm . 1213908_1214068
even_though my grandmother had a home, &-um my mom and her sisters
so ‡ make to make the long story short, we ended up leaving
I think we moved to +//. 1227820_1228960
no Redacted_address yeah ‡ we moved to Redacted_address
that's in Brooklyn too . 1231259_1231769
and I grew up in that area for like$co ten to twelve years,
but &-um it's different seeing as everything is around the corner,
I go outside, the corner store is there . 1246641_1249261
you got <your shop> your shoes stores . 1249622_1252162
you got your Duane_Reades, your Rite_Aids, &-um your CVSs . 1252300_1256560
it's just totally different, like everybody's always outside
&-um &=tsks it's just nice . 1261342_1264502
it's just different . 1264517_1265837
it's just a different feeling, like everything is right where you
and if you come out the area, all you gonna see is the woods unless
+< okay ‡ true that . 1280349_1280599
+< and &-um there's no corner stores . 1281136_1283616
yall have QTs . 1283635_1284465
mhm . 1285481_1285831
&-um you need your car to go past the outside of your your
and yeah ‡ everybody down here is about their home . 1293420_1295900
they not really more_so about fashion . 1295952_1297882
up there we about fashion . 1297898_1300358
like ‡ (be)cause you walking all the time, you gotta look fresh,
if you're a girl, your hair hafta be done, your nails gotta be done
and you not gonna be get caught dead going in certain stores . 1308827_1312117
I see people who going in and out here like it's nothing . 1312140_1316460
so yeah ‡ we more about our clothes . 1317498_1319148
yall more about like$co homes and stuff . 1319292_1321042
okay ‡ &-um ‡ &=tsks between I guess New_York and your experience
safer ? 1332938_1333498
yes . 1334474_1334574
mm ‡ I guess &-um I felt a little bit safer in New_York . 1335491_1344861
I think that's (be)cause I grew up there though . 1344879_1346629
like ‡ down here it was something I seen on tv . 1347594_1350194
and I feel like the houses are nice but they kind_of just right
whereas up there like$co everybody's connected . 1357964_1360334
the houses are connected . 1360671_1362111
so ‡ it's like <they're not> &+w they not gonna try you like
(be)cause we just so closeknitted up there . 1372858_1374778
even if we didn't want to be, that's just the way that it's built .
so ‡ yeah . 1377489_1379079
it's a_lot more crowded up there . 1379777_1383117
I think it's the same . 1386856_1387866
well &+f no yeah ‡ it's crowded . 1387886_1391066
it's crowded but <it doesn't> after &+fi I feel like it's
it's the same amount of people . 1397826_1399176
it's just that your neighbors are much closer . 1399191_1401821
like okay ‡ you step outside on your porch, they porch is right
like ‡ there's a gate dividing your porch and their porch . 1405836_1409216
but when you come out and they stand there, you're gonna say hey@q
versus out here we hafta wave across the street or wave next door .
there's space in between your houses so I don't know . 1416260_1419720
<I don't> I don't think it's more crowded . 1419737_1421117
I think it's the same amount of people actually . 1421135_1423915
it's just that everybody kind_of is on the go in they own cars and
okay so ‡ &+eh in your neighborhood, let's say back in New_York,
oh no ‡ my school was always in the vicinity . 1446419_1448379
okay . 1449122_1449652
&-um when I was in junior high my school was across the street . 1449667_1451987
<all I &+d I literally> all I hadta do was cross the street
I think my mom and my aunt did that on purpose . 1456323_1458513
and then when I got to high school &-um I just hadta walk up, let
and then we moved to another place so I was walking &-um just ten
but it was in the same type of zone area, like you hadta go to your
&-um I think in high school you could go to other schools but you
but we have zone schools just like out here . 1485689_1487959
&-um &=tsks they were always in the area . 1487978_1491668
only one time I think up from kindergarten to third grade I was in
but that was because I was in a catholic school and then she
and that's when I moved over to the Redacted_address school
they was just taking the money . 1517405_1518735
okay . 1519780_1520230
so ‡ &-um what was your favorite school I guess in particular that
I didn't like school . 1526913_1528583
mhm . 1528606_1529036
I think my whole experience in school +//. 1529245_1530985
I really loved &-um kindergarten . 1531709_1533909
mhm . 1533927_1534867
(be)cause we we didn't do anything . 1536702_1537212
we took naps . 1537573_1538343
that's awesome . 1538364_1539294
&-um colored . 1539316_1540256
and some people don't remember like$co kindergarten but I remember
mhm . 1545692_1546702
she was a helper for my +//. 1546791_1547851
my teacher was indian . 1547866_1549036
she looked like Pocahontas . 1549670_1550880
that's all I can remember . 1551384_1552114
and the special needs teacher, she was a little person . 1553065_1556025
mhm . 1556582_1557312
and her name was Miss_Redacted_name . 1558119_1558799
she was so nice . 1558817_1559427
she was like$co the height of probably my knee and I'm just five
she was up to like$co my thigh . 1564693_1566193
oh . 1566214_1566474
she was tiny . 1567448_1568158
mhm . 1568368_1568768
&=tsks she was so nice . 1569665_1570535
she useta bring me candy all the time so I really love kindergarten
and then let's see, I really loved &-um +... 1575168_1578478
I think that was fifth grade . 1578547_1580227
no ‡ sixth grade . 1580510_1581420
I met this guy, he was my teacher . 1581645_1583465
his name was Mister_Redacted_name . 1583482_1584132
really on the hefty side . 1585320_1585850
rest in peace „ Mister_Redacted_name . 1585872_1587742
but he really &-um motivated us to be good people . 1588524_1591724
mhm . 1592015_1592385
it wasn't just about singing with him . 1592924_1594564
it was more about like$co &-um you_know &+f getting to know you and
I really liked that class . 1602564_1603584
that was a music class . 1604102_1604812
and that made me have a love for music . 1604833_1606043
and then let's see, I don't think I had any favorites in high
what_about some teachers you just couldn't stand like ah . 1613868_1617558
oh . 1617606_1618036
there's there's teachers . 1618566_1619136
Mister_Redacted_name in Redacted_school two eleven .
couldn't stand his ass . 1624298_1625248
&=laughs .
oh ‡ my bad . 1626073_1626623
nah ‡ you good . 1627033_1627733
my mom ‡ &-um she hadta go up there and speak to him because he
my glasses ‡ I didn't have my glasses . 1632495_1634525
I wear glasses to see the board . 1634623_1636063
I would tell him every day +"/. 1636082_1636832
+" I can't see . 1637003_1637573
and then he'll be mad that I didn't turn in my work and stuff like
well ‡ it's like I can't see . 1640868_1642038
and then he told me he was not gonna put me in the front of the
so ‡ she came up there and gave him a little one two type of mama
&=laughs man „ ma . 1653309_1653959
&-um Misses_Redacted_name . 1654012_1655552
mhm . 1656649_1656959
I think that was her name . 1657190_1658100
she was a &+ra +//. 1658344_1659194
that was the first time I hadta deal with racism in NYC . 1659360_1662590
but she basically useta pick on certain people and tell us like
+" oh ‡ you're doing this and I'm 'a tell your parents
and you weren't doing it . 1669807_1671047
and I remember one time she told my mom I was in the class jumping
mhm . 1679319_1679499
and Mister_Redacted_name hadta come and help me out and
when she got her mind on you, she ain't gonna like you . 1688385_1690985
so ‡ those are two people I had an awful experience with in school
but school just +/. 1695334_1696374
it wasn't my thing . 1696590_1697230
I wanted to get out and do what I wanted to do but the crazy thing
did you have any &-um favorite subjects ? 1708770_1712030
english . 1713424_1713644
I could write a essay like nobody's business . 1713661_1715381
I useta help people write their essays (be)cause I was really good
it was just common sense to me . 1718767_1720397
okay . 1720450_1720570
mhm . 1721522_1722112
&-um social studies and then there was another class we useta take
mhm . 1728167_1728577
I can't remember the name of that class but it was really fun . 1729423_1732053
the teacher was really good . 1732077_1733077
I can't remember his name though . 1733130_1734260
that was a really good class . 1735086_1736366
what'd they call that <when you> with the weather ? 1736958_1739558
&-uh meteorology or something like that . 1740169_1742309
something like that . 1742354_1742924
yeah ‡ I really liked that . 1742942_1743772
xxx .
and then I took drama class in college . 1744967_1746727
that was fun and weird at the same time . 1747220_1749910
I think I wasn't ready for at that point . 1749961_1751841
mhm . 1752427_1752837
because I didn't know that like$co in acting class you hafta <act
and <I just> I was too concerned about how I was looking than
so ‡ that didn't last long . 1766516_1767726
mm . 1767745_1768325
so ‡ would that be considered +//? 1769251_1770501
I'm I know that's a course but it was there any other
&=tsks in high school, no . 1776530_1777730
okay . 1778051_1778321
I tried out for the track team but I had some issues with pain in
I guess that is genetics, I don't know . 1784284_1786774
oh . 1787069_1787429
and then &-um I wasn't really into like$co cheerleading because I'm
and the stuff that they were doing to the people who were
I was just not gonna pass that test „ like . 1800505_1802575
mhm . 1803151_1803291
so ‡ I kind_of just stayed to myself . 1803391_1805311
I didn't really do anything extracurricular in school . 1805416_1807656
didn't wanna do it even when I was younger and I would say +"/. 1809076_1812326
+" oh ‡ I wanna do tap dancing . 1812732_1813462
and my mom would take me to tap dance class and then when I
and then I just went home . 1819731_1822141
so ‡ I just never was interested in anything . 1822192_1824212
I'm a really clinger . 1824229_1825319
I cling to my mom . 1825546_1826536
mhm . 1826558_1827438
&=tsks and &-um I cling to anything that's that I feel
and if they're not with me I have a issue „ so &=tsks yeah . 1838444_1840504
definitely a clinger . 1841958_1842408
definitely a Klingon .
&=laughs .
&-um what you call again ? 1844549_1849369
let's see, go a little bit deeper . 1849891_1852901
(be)cause usually a_lot_of people, when they come to Atlanta for
I don't wanna adapt yall flavor and swag . 1863330_1865080
you really holding on to this NY you_know dialect and culture . 1865303_1870373
<I don't have> I don't know how to pick up yall dialect . 1870785_1873985
like ‡ I don't really hang out with Atlanta people like that . 1874047_1877307
not it's no offense to any person that's from Atlanta but I
mhm . 1889548_1889938
and so ‡ the few I have met, <I just> I don't mess with them
it's clashing . 1894298_1895408
like ‡ they views and my views . 1895453_1896793
so &-um . 1897930_1898520
go deeper . 1898573_1899423
like ‡ what's the difference ? 1899444_1900754
like ‡ you can tell somebody from New_York by the way they walk or
no ‡ because I don't know, like I'm picky with my friends in
mhm . 1913707_1913957
&-um when I came out here I met one girl . 1915368_1916908
she was from New_York and she lived out here for like$co over ten
but to me she was more into like$co the guys with the cars and if
and <I'm just> I'm not saying there's not girls like that in
mhm . 1936712_1937442
and I didn't hang out with them there either . 1937463_1938593
okay . 1939307_1939797
so ‡ it just depends on, for me, energy and where your &-um
like ‡ I'm not gonna not be your friend because you want a guy with
but if that's all you're concerned about and I see you not working
and I think that's the difference between me a New_York person and
I just haven't found that right Atlanta person that you_know I
true true . 1971392_1972692
and I can't lose this accent if &+d +/. 1973215_1974975
I feel like I was there my whole life . 1975165_1976895
I came out here and &+wi <in my> when I was like$co
so ‡ my accent is stuck . 1980680_1981880
it's not going nowhere . 1982025_1983125
I'm not trynna pick up no other accent unless I go to London or
okay nah nah nah ‡ it's that's fair . 1987789_1990059
