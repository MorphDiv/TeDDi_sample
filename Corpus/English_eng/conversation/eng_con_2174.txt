well you make the dough &=breath and you leave it in the bread
ye- kneading and raising and all that kind of stuff and then you
before it bakes . 156400_157410
mhm . 157820_158220
and you divide it into two and let it sit for a few minutes . 157960_161940
and then press into like a round &-um . 162480_165070
pizza pan . 165400_166040
oh . 166310_166720

So I made one with &-uh that on it . 176860_179830
and the other one I sliced peaches real thin and then you put
on the top and bake it and of course it's a real . 186420_188800
you know it's a yeast dough . 189200_190680
mhm . 190760_191260

yeah and good . 193060_194190
and boy they were and it it tells you . 193270_196170
the recipe actually calls &=breath for some kind_of a &-um . 197090_201070
on it it says either unflavored whipped cream or &-uh sour cream . 202170_206630
something like that . 206930_207720
so we just used Cool Whip and it was . 208120_210160
it was very good it was very nice I took one I coo- . 210400_213040

and he enjoy it . 219100_220050
I have no idea . 219980_220910
um as a matter of fact I keep meaning to ask him and we've been xxx

oh . 230500_231070
um &=exhale . 231600_232680

mhm . 241740_242210

basis and and raises a fuss . 244960_247250
mhm . 247430_248000
and &-um they finally said well then they'd be out . 248050_251490
and they &=exhale they &-um . 252170_254490
oh I don't know it was &-uh . 255320_257430
they it it just keeps get getting pushed back and back well finally
uh well no actually when we came home we noticed that they'd shaved
uh swale off across the road . 269620_271860
now they still have not fixed that pipe which is my big complaint
mhm . 277360_277940
It's still hanging up in the air and Everhart is beside himself
we asked them to sink that pipe so that people wouldn't get their
mhm . 286630_287110
well they never ha- they didn't do that but . 287160_289350
um &=exhale what they did wa- well now let me see first Monday . 290290_294240
they turned off the water here all &-uh all morning on Monday . 294620_298240
because the pipe had sprung a leak . 298520_300500
uhhuh . 300730_301140
so they had to fix that before they could do the road then they
they dug . 307420_308430
they put a pipe &-um sort of . 309450_311760
caddywampus@n under under the road just below . 313040_316560
our driveway and before the new peoples' driveway . 317050_320330
but the way they put it in mother . 321080_323250
and left it . 323890_324900
it blocked our pipe so that anything that would've gone . 325360_328900
through our pipe would've backed up immediately . 329270_332410
and and flooded our property . 333530_335400
&=exhale . 336780_337300
What kind of engineers do they have working down there . 337010_339650
oh Everhart said he doesn't think they have any idea at all you
well I went up to help &-um . 343450_345960
the band . 346520_347380
people help &-uh fit band uniforms . 347950_350580

&=lipsmack Now you know that in my day we got our uniforms fit but
this is all done by the parents . 357820_359420
oh . 359970_360440

and I got there at eight o'clock and around eleven I called home
uh you know as soon as the kids told him it was me he told them to
wha- that they'd made a colossal mess out of the road . 372910_376010
and &-um so I said to &~Virginia I've got to go I've got to go see
well the- i- they dug this deep trench and . 382110_385890
put these huge rocks . 386220_388580
in the road . 389090_389680
