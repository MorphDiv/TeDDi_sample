turn right one quarter diagonal flip that woulda
yeah . 9188_9881
you guys are getting very sophisticated in your thinking about
okay um Brittany you were right um I did have turn left one half
+< he he did the think of it and I +/. 34615_36031
he thought of it and you helped him put it into words because
+< there's more ways xxx . 47503_48351
you think there's more ways ? 48351_49305
good but can we go on to the rest of my two by two designs so you
and um for the ones we have left because you'll want your recess
let's see Brian Teddy Nathan Alex Dani slide in and put your full
with the things that we're talking about . 83048_84981
to look at your two by two designs and to write down what you did .
if you don't pay attention to us now that will be very challenging
+< isn't that the one that I did I was +/. 93801_96188
+< okay nobody's done this yet nobody's wrote down the moves they
but everybody should be ready to write down those moves later today
I don't mean you'll have all your designs done but I mean you'll
+< I already do . 116500_116826
okay here's my core square in it's beginning position could we
+< &=gasps oh ! 130728_130913
Jillian what do you think ? 130913_132736
um turn right one fourth . 132736_136013
and it made it . 136013_141385
do a diagonal flip . 141385_143385
wait wait wait wait I have to do that again turn right one fourth
yeah . 150456_151040
um is there a certain kind of diagonal flip you want . 151040_154528
oh I know a diagonal flip . 154528_156896
+< &~diag . 156896_157296
I think xxx . 157296_158701
+< across ! 158701_159455
&~acro all of (th)em have them go across ! 159520_162365
um . 162365_163165
you mean like this Jillian ? 163165_167303
tell me what corner to hold and where to flip it to and then I'll
+< the yellow square . 172415_173015
hold the yellow square . 173015_174815
and then flip it +... 174815_175640
to the bottom left ? 175640_176975
to the bottom left . 176975_180111
okay . 180111_180683
that's < good > . 180683_181710

yeah it did . 185095_186800
+< not exactly . 186800_187280
who can find me a way that doesn't have a diagonal turn in it &~s so
Jillian found me a way that works can someone find me a way that
diagonal turn ? 198371_199288
I mean a diagonal flip you're right you can't do a diagonal turn . 199288_202943
turn is not a flip very good . 202943_205610
hmm I'd really like someone to share who hasn't shared yet today
how do xxx . 214200_215185
+< this part hmm Vanessa you haven't shared in a long time what are
um turn a quarter to the um left . 220305_232980
a quarter turn to the left . 232980_234881
&=gasps no ! 234881_236531
+< ah no I mean right right right . 236531_237810
a quarter turn to the right . 237810_240545

hmm look at that one and see what I did . 249493_253790
xxx . 253790_256931
Alex I don't see you looking up at the core square or the two by
what do you think Katie ? 264363_266368
um turn it to the right one fourth . 266368_273536
we already did that and it didn't work . 273536_275485
< got an idea > turning it to the right one fourth got the
I think it's a up down flip . 285970_288688
so do I . 288688_289361
+< Kevin thinks it's an up down flip imagine what an up down flip
+< me too I think so too . 294010_294310
+< I think it's an up down flip xxx . 294310_295376
+< here goes . 295376_296296
+< I thought it was an up down flip xxx .296296_297501

the one right here we're thinking about . 324810_327543
&=gasps oh ! 327543_328193
oh my gosh two hands shot up I'd hate to think that Jillian and
Ashley what do you think ? 333411_334443

oh you have to say it's to the right or to the left . 339525_344545
nope no you don't . 344545_345028
oh . 345028_345336
sideways flip means right or left she did exactly right excellent
a sideways flip and I know you might've spotted another way that's
+< the next one's already in spot . 359430_359780
+< it's already in spot . 359780_360363
oh so how do you right that down ? 360363_362166
the same spot . 362166_363671

+< sideways flip . 365325_366846
+< it's the right way . 366846_367895
it's a silent flip ? 367895_368921
sideways . 368921_369940
sideways flip ? 369940_371021
oh is it does it have to be a sideways flip to fit in there . 371021_373858
+< but it's in position . 373858_374276
it's in position so what do you wanna +/. 374276_376458
+< it's in position . 376458_377010
but remember this is my core what do you need to do to the core to
um . 382533_383330
remember we built quilt families . 383330_385270
no . 385650_387253

+< copy copied it ! 400406_401725
+< copied it that's exactly what I did I made a copy I don't need
so I'm gonna copy the core . 410311_411948
copy . 411948_413281
copy the core you have to tell (th)em what to copy copy the core . 413281_416956
if I &~cuh made a copy of this core it would fit in there
yeah okay so . 420156_426808
shh . 426808_429260
looks like about seven minutes to recess will we make it or won't

why not ? 480500_480975
+< no one programmed it . 480975_481600
no one programmed it to think about diagonal flips ? 481600_484165
in Logo they don't know how to do diagonal flips . 484165_487235
what ? 487235_488036
+< how can they do it with the computer ? 488036_489140
