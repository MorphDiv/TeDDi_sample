and Emmett's mother, she was like worried that he would be in trouble there, but there's somewhere where it says, oh yeah, here.
it says +"/.
+" just a few weeks before Emmett's arrival in Money, a black teenage girl had been flogged for crowding a white woman in a store. 89194_106487
mm-hmm. 106487_107396
yeah. 107396_108288
mm-hmm. 108288_109046
so, that could have been one of the reasons. 109046_110517
they were also looking out for Emmett, too.
right? 110517_113350
wait, did Emmett go with his mom or his cousin? 113350_115433

Emmett and Bobo. 126148_126792
it's cool how they had McDonald's still back then. 126792_129013
who's Bobo? 129013_129368
Bobo?
oh that's his nickname. 129368_130382
yeah, because +... 130382_131058
Bobo? 131058_132134
“Emmett spent most of his” , why'd they nickname him Bobo? 132134_134360
I think it's just a name. 134360_135828
I don't know. 135828_136048
I think it's something that had to do with his uncle. 136048_138405
well what's his uncle's name? 138405_140132
no his dad, his dad. 140132_140853

on forty-one, but it +...151203_152346
I thought it said something about +...152346_154568
no, it's talking about Jackie Robinson. 154568_156910
chapter three is most about his life and how he liked, he said he loves jokes, he liked White Sox and he was mad because he didn't get to go to a White Sox game. 156910_170435
I think Emmett had more friends in Mississippi than in Chicago. 170435_175081
it also says he was different from the rest of the Chicago boys, he seemed more mature and he liked to talk a lot. 175081_183056
yeah. 183056_186121
yeah. 186121_186829
it says he would pay people to tell him jokes.
he liked jokes a lot. 186829_189654
yeah and also it says he had a stutter, too. 189654_193358
yeah.
the local girls found him attractive, too.
in Chicago. 193358_197335
it said he liked to help, it says that he liked to help his neighbors because he always would carry in groceries, he'd shovel the snow even if it was really cold, he'd work through it. 197335_210103
yeah, and he said one day to his , yeah, here.
+" mom, I think I want to go to work and make the money, I could take care of the home. 210103_215511
mm-hmm. 215511_216130

and his mom thought the person over-paid. 226822_232015
and so she went over there and it turns out it was +...232015_235753
yeah, he did so much. 235753_236945
I think he should be old enough because he was fourteen.
that's ninth grade. 236945_240662
but still, xxx think when you're around your cousins. 240662_241748
it's still not, he's not fully +...241748_242974

no, not like that.
you know how you are around your friends and stuff. 244452_247679
no, he's not fully educated, yeah. 247679_249881
it was a dare and he didn't think of the consequences. 249881_251942
oh. 251942_252402
he didn't think what would happen, because he wasn't prepared. 252402_254309
he shouldn't have had the consequences to die. 254309_257375
yeah. 257375_258034
think about it +...258034_258780
no, but I watched a video about him that the boys didn't dare him, they just pulled him out when he was trying to do that, he was trying to grab, he was trying to flirt with her, physically. 258780_269276
no +...269276_269558
it said in the book, chapter one +...269558_271172
yeah, chapter one, they were talking about how he got dared, they, he was, think, if you're with your cousins and friends, you're going to do stuff and forget about what your mom said and just do it for fun. 271172_279191
yeah. 279191_279510
you didn't, and like she said, he wasn't really prepared, he thought it was silly that he didn't believe in the consequences.
because he didn't live up like that like his mom did, so +...279510_287652
it says +...287652_289540
xxx. 289540_291477
he didn't believe it, I think. 291477_292132
yeah, on page forty-five it says +"/.
+" if you have to get on your knees and bow when a white person goes past, do it willingly. 292132_296310
oh yeah. 296310_296889
yeah, and he thought that was unbelievable or something.
xxx. 296889_299483
yeah, because rules were very strict back then. 299483_304223
oh wait, his mom +...304223_305805
I think one of these pages it actually says that he thought it was the craziest thing he ever heard. 305805_314022
also, it says Emmett Till's mom knew that the penalty would come, violating a Jim Crow law. 314022_318654
why did John Bell William, why did he make up the term Black Monday?
I think that's on chapter four.
no, it's on chapter two. 318654_328796
yeah xxx. 328796_329337
yeah, that is very racist, too. 329337_330931
yeah, who says that? 330931_333942
oh him?
the Brady guy? 333942_337400
yeah, he says, he says, he published a book Black Monday. 337400_344599
well what page is it on? 344599_347098
that was on page thirty. 347098_348334
thirty. 348334_349397
oh, this was really mean.
+" you cannot place little white negro children together in classrooms and not have interrogation.
+" they will sing together, dance together, eat together, play together.
+" they will grow up together and the sensitivity of white children will be dulled.
so mean. 349397_368505
yeah. 368505_369111
yeah, they say it like it's really bad. 369111_370590
like it's a bad thing. 370590_371352
oh page thirty-three, white people were really mean to the Negros because it says, there's a picture of a boy saying we won't go to school with Negros. 371352_380523
well, back then, that's their reaction to the +...380523_382305
we're in school with African Americans right now. 382305_384561
he's smiling about it, too. 384561_384933
we're not dulled.
I think we're all perfectly fine. 384933_390692
xxx. 390692_394745
yeah, just because they're older doesn't mean they're smarter and mature.
they could be +...
xxx.
a completely unrelated subject, gang members, they're old, but you'd think they're mature, but they're not. 394745_408035
I don't understand why when they had the public school, it said unfortunately violence increased.
+" like wouldn't that xxx the segregation? 408035_422864
I know why it increased, it was because when this guy, Brady, he made a book about Black Monday and it said all bad things, it was bad things about Black people.
how if they say something, what you're supposed to do, and that's why they were saying that they were just waiting for trouble because of what this guy made his book.
so, when Emmett came, they were going to show everyone what happens if you come across them. 422864_448783
yeah. 448783_449226
I remember I was looking it up last night. 449226_450912
yeah and then over here, they were being racist, too. 450912_454079
yeah, the sign said +"/.
+" waiting room for colored only. 454079_457040
yeah. 457040_457706
these people, it says these people, they were actually trying, they were like the opposite of the KKK, they were the good side of them. 457706_465384
yeah. 465384_465726
they were trying to put up signs that said colored people can go here and be with other people, too. 465726_471594
and Lamar Smith, he was trying to help them but he got shot. 471594_473599
yeah.
so they could get a more diverse +...473599_475700
if you search up the KKK people, it's really creepy because they're just +...475700_481661
yeah. 481661_483980
they set fire to a cross or something. 483980_488575
I think Abraham Lincoln should have added to the deal, not only slavery, but they have to stop treating them like animals. 488575_492254
I remember I saw a movie and it actually put Black people up on a cross and they were burning them on a cross.
that movie, I was like +...
xxx. 492254_500292
and they were holding torches and stuff. 500292_502419
yeah, they'd hold torches and then they'd be celebrating stuff after.
and they would burn down people's houses. 502419_506436
wait, wait.
Abraham Lincoln ended slavery, if I were him, I would add more to the deal, like stop slaving them and be nice to them. 506436_513266
but you have to think about it, about those times, there was really nothing you could do with the government. 513266_518121
yeah, but at the time, nice wasn't a powerful word, that meant nothing to them. 518121_522619
you're thinking differently, because in our days, it's like they could have did this, they could have did that.
but in those times, you have to think differently because this is how everyone, kids and stuff grown up since they were little, even their parents.
so you have to think about how the government was back then.
because now, from us, it's different, because they stopped all that and we can go to school with any culture. 522619_542487
I think Emmett's mom should have, because I don't know the risks, but his cousins might do something bad +...542487_548247
his mom thought he would be safe, but he made some poor decisions, but he also helped the civil rights movement a lot. 548247_557037
no, it was his mom. 557037_560019
it was his mother.
things must have been so different in Mississippi than Chicago.
on one of these pages it says that they were thirteen months ahead.
oh, right here.
+" Brady unknowingly foreshadowed the Emmett Till case thirteen months before it happened. 560019_584084
yeah. 584084_584851
and also, the Supreme Court made a decision of landmark desegregation.
Emmett and his friends thought that decision would have little effect, but it was pretty big. 584851_598843
well, I don't really understand on page forty-two, he said, why was he doing all that work with his mom to get money?
did they need more money? 598843_617113
I think they said something about, because the father leaving +...617113_620203
because it's over here.
+" mom, if you can go to work and make the money, I could take care the house.
+" so it's +...620203_624690
+" but why did they need to make all that money? 624690_625840
because they didn't have the dad, right?
so that probably would have been hard. 625840_632566
on page forty-four, it says, there's a quote, it says +"/.
+" and two of the boys that he grew up with, they were going back to Mississippi.
that's what Emmett wanted to do.
+" so maybe Emmett has been to Mississippi before because it says they were going back. 632566_650671
if he meets a white woman, he has to step off the street and lower his head and not look up. 650671_655901
