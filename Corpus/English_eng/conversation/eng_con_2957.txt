what were the decomposers we looked at below, with the cards on them ? 1355_5055
what were they ? 5155_6815
there's one started with an f . 7275_8115
go and call out . 8775_9295
fungus .
and then there's one with a b . 9455_11415
bacteria, invertebrates .
invertebrates .
oh .
xxx caught a leaf . 11955_17075
you caught a leaf ? 19295_20155
nice .
no .
it fell on my shoulder . 20735_22635
those are some decomposers . 26855_28435
can anybody think of anything else, besides, for fungi, bacteria and invertebrates, that might be a decomposer ? 29435_35555
something besides for those, that might break down things that used to be alive and their waste, into simpler parts and smaller parts that become part of soil . 35875_46435
is there anything else you can think of that might break things down besides for fungi, bacteria, and invertibrates ? 47495_54755
keep thinking . 56155_57035
okay, think quietly to yourself . 57295_59215
raise your hand if you have an idea of something besides, for fungi, bacteria and invertebrates, that might break things down into simpler stuff . 61675_76735
things that used to be alive or their wastes . 77095_78755
S_two, what do you have ? 79135_79815
hyenas . 79835_80135
hyenas ? 80795_81235
they're sometimes scavengers and they would pick up whatever's left +... 81655_84075
dead . 84195_84475
so what do you guys think of the hyena idea ? 84755_86735
you guys know what hyenas are, right ? 86895_87975
yeah . 88035_88295
okay . 88855_89095
so tell us more about hyenas that you know, S_two . 89275_91655
I watched this show . 91815_92955
people say they're scavengers and just pick up scraps that are there . 93115_96175
they do, do . 96395_97795
but sometimes they actually, they kill as well as just hunt . 98415_106135
so +... 106555_106875
plus they kill instead of just picking up scraps . 107675_110435
yeah .
so if a lion kills a gazelle, or something, and it's lying there ? 111005_115005
then the hyena comes over and +... 115305_116965
and comes afterwards +... 117185_118285
yeah . 118885_118965
and eats the scraps that are left over, or you're saying sometimes they actually kill the animal and they eat it ? 119045_123105
yeah . 123225_123245
okay, what do you guys think ? 123425_124305
would you call that a decomposer ? 124565_126285
are they breaking things that used to be alive down into simpler and smaller parts that become part of soil ? 126385_132525
what do you guys think ? 132585_133165
talk to the person next to you . 133325_134505
turn and talk . 134645_134985
yes .
yeah xxx .
oh . 135365_135505
see where I'm pointing with a stick ? 136105_138325
yeah . 138755_139015
it's a cricket .
watch .
see it jump ? 140935_141355
oh .
yeah . 141555_141735
jump right there .
it's a tiny little cricket . 142975_143795
right there .
where is it ? 143955_144175
it's right there . 144215_144555
it's on the stick . 145895_146795
it's on the stick ? 146895_147575
yeah .
I see it . 147635_148315
I see it . 148435_148915
oh that's +... 148975_149435
on the stick .
oh .
oh . 149975_151575
it's right there . 151815_152555
can we catch it and keep it ? 153055_153715
oh God !
where did it go ?
next discussion question . 153715_156115
I used to have crickets for .
right there .
do you think that that cricket is a decomposer ? 156215_160355
turn and talk to the same person . 160615_161675
do you think +... 161855_162115
yeah .
does it eat things that were dead and break them down into part things that are simpler and smaller, that could be part of soil ? 162315_168055
mm-hmm . 168315_168955
it does . 169455_169615
so let's do it with a talking stick . 169615_171135
always the same animal .
who's ready to talk with the whole group here ? 171255_172575
it's right there . 172835_173435
I found it .
let's talk about the cricket . 173835_174675
do you think the cricket's a decomposer ? 174835_176215
mm-hmm . 176455_176695
here you go . 176995_177355
no . 178795_180015
because I believe that crickets only eat grass . 180515_183655
okay . 184435_184715
so maybe crickets eat grass . 184855_185995
you'd say that it's not a decomposer if it eats grass ? 186115_187855
yeah . 187995_188255
okay . 188675_188995
it's a cricket right there .
if it eats grass, do you think it's breaking things that used to be alive down into simpler parts that might be part of soil ? 190885_195685
yeah . 195945_196205
oh, you do ? 196705_197185
no +... 197585_197925
no ?
oh . 198865_199985
sound like a little conflicted ? 200225_201965
that's okay . 202485_202785
let's take the talking stick . 203065_203925
all right, why don't you pass it to the next person ? 204285_205585
raise your hand if you want to add to the conversation . 205785_207845
you toss the stick to him gently . 208025_209205
S_seven .
ouch !
it's heavy . 209465_212245
all right, so . 212745_213405
I think the cricket is the decomposer . 214425_216405
and I think that everything that eats, is a decomposer, even if it's a vegetarian or a carnivore or meat eater it's because +... 216485_224445
he just says something really provocative . 224445_226865
he just said, I think anything that eats other things is a decomposer . 227565_233405
that eats anything . 233585_234365
that eats anything ? 234585_235245
okay, cool . 235505_236005
say more about that . 236105_236585
what makes you say that ? 236585_237225
it's because, even if you're a vegetarian, you're eating your veggies and plants, and plants can decompose and if you eat meat and that could decompose . 237205_251285
so you're saying that even if you eat meat or if you eat plants, anything that eats those things is a decomposer ? 252245_258405
anything that eats at all, is a decomposer . 258545_260505
anything that eats at all . 260625_261245
what do you guys think ? 261325_261945
agree ? 262125_262605
disagree ? 262785_263105
agree . 263505_263825
raise your hand if you've got something to say, to add to this conversation . 263815_266555
that's a pretty interesting idea he just brought up there . 266735_268895
right behind you . 269575_270275
pass the mic . 270395_270955
I agree . 272375_272915
say why you agree . 274255_276775
what's your evidence ? 276855_277555
because, technically, that is right, because everything has to eat to survive . 277995_281835
and no matter if they're just a little fish in the water, you still have to eat something . 283015_289055
but trees cannot decompose . 289415_290895
here it is .
but remember, the main question is, are you breaking things that used to be alive, down into something that's simpler and smaller parts, becoming part of the soil ? 291065_298785
the cricket's on your leg . 299345_300045
xxx yeah .
the cricket's on your leg . 300725_301745
where ? 302325_302885
catch it ! 303185_303585
where did it go ?
catch it . 304325_304865
catch it . 305065_305145
there it is . 305205_305665
it's going to jump . 305825_306465
catch it . 306865_307285
sir .
can we keep it as like a pet ? 308285_310225
class pet . 310405_310905
it lives here xxx . 311225_312865
oh !
oh I think I land on it . 312925_315785
can we keep it as a class pet ? 315945_317345
the cricket smells .
kid . 317825_318805
oh !
he caught it . 320225_320805
close your hand, but leave spaces so it could breathe . 321085_323705
here it is .
okay I'm going to take the cricket . 325485_330545
did you hear that ? 331265_332125
yes . 332285_332525
yeah .
what was it ? 332905_333365
yeah .
that's the one . 333365_333665
something fell . 334145_334945
a big thing . 335305_336465
so a +...
more a branch . 336565_337385
a branch ? 337625_337965
mm-hmm .
yeah .
I think branch . 338205_339285
oh ! 340205_340465
cricket flew . 340625_341045
so let's go back to his point . 341425_345485
he says anything that eats anything is a decomposer . 345625_349225
yeah .
please turn and talk to the person next to you, whether you agree with that statement or not . 350025_354485
and say why you agree or you disagree with +... 354685_356545
let's pick anything that eats things . 356725_359565
somebody name something that eats something . 359565_361145
cricket .
us . 361865_362105
S_seven .
we already talked about crickets . 362265_363225
S_seven .
us .
so, us, like people ? 363685_364905
yeah .
no . 365145_365325
S_seven .
S_seven .
you eats . 365425_366345
xxx .
okay . 366565_367105
let's talk about people . 367525_368325
sticks are down . 369065_369645
are people decomposers ? 371105_373345
anybody want to argue for why you think that people are decomposers . 373325_378365
and say what your reasoning and evidence are ? 379085_380425
yeah .
I think the +... 380985_381445
use your microphone ? 381445_381905
I think people are decomposers, because after something is dead, like a cow, we fry it and eat it like steak . 383345_394645
do we turn it into smaller and simpler parts that become part of soil ? 395405_399585
no . 400465_400965
our poop . 401715_402235
yeah . 402315_402335
oh .
our poop . 402335_403335
so, you eat a cow and then you go poop ? 403735_407355
yes . 407695_408035
so you think you're turning cows into soil ? 408335_410295
yes . 410995_411815
I know some people who, instead of using xxx, they use animal poop as soil and they use human poop too . 411935_423315
oh . 423775_423975
so you know of people taking poop and putting it into compost to make soil ? 424115_427855
mm-hmm . 428095_428415
and growing things out of it ? 428495_429215
so you're saying humans are decomposers because they eat things like cows and they poop them out . 429385_434925
and you can use that soil to grow things . 435125_436725
mm-hmm .
raise your hand if you want to respond to what he just said, or you want to add to it or do you want to disagree or agree . 436845_441985
I agree with xxx . 442945_444445
xxx, did you have something ? 446185_446745
you were about to say something earlier . 446945_448265
forget what it was ? 449045_450505
yeah . 451385_451805
I thought you were disagreeing, no ? 451965_452885
yeah .
well, I guess because +... 453705_456145
why don't you give him the mic ? 458525_458945
because, trees eat . 459965_462445
but xxx, do they actual poop ? 463985_465345
actually, do they poop ? 465765_466905
oh, this is interesting . 467305_468705
trees . 469065_469865
their little leaves . 469885_470065
are trees decomposers ? 470245_472365
what do trees eat ? 472765_476565
water . 476925_477325
raise your hand if you want to add to this . 477885_481005
what do trees eat ? 481065_482105
yeah . 482125_482405
so, trees are decomposers, just because they drink water and that makes them grow leaves, I think . 482865_491765
and then when they grow leaves and when it falls down, the leaves decompose . 492165_497485
so they turned the water into leaves, or the water helps the seeds . 498165_505085
so +...
not the leaves . 505365_506505
so . 506665_506745
it's kind of confusing when you talk about trees eating things . 506845_509425
so here's a few things about trees that I know . 510025_512205
trees, they take carbon dioxide from the air . 513785_517325
do you know what carbon dioxide is ? 517445_518525
yeah . 518745_518885
you breathe it out, right ? 519305_520105
yeah .
trees take in carbon dioxide from the air, and with sunlight, and with water in the leaves, they turn it into sugar . 520605_529625
sugar ? 530205_531225
glucose . 531645_532365
I don't want a tree . 532645_533665
and somebody just said glucose over there . 534065_535765
so they make it into sugar, and they make their own food . 536345_540285
and that's the food that the tree uses, is the sugar that it makes from carbon dioxide, water and sunlight . 540965_547625
does it poop it out ? 547865_548545
it's pretty weird, right . 548545_549325
it doesn't poop . 549805_551425
so you just asked, does it poop it out ? 551605_553365
do trees poop stuff out ? 553445_554845
you know what trees poop out ? 555125_556465
leaves . 556645_557045
no .
it's there that +...
pee and stuff . 557745_561145
just like humans do . 561285_562345
this is weird stuff . 562685_563445
trees +... 564255_564755
it's not poop . 565955_566695
xxx .
they give off oxygen . 567095_570095
that's a waste for them . 571315_572455
oxygen, don't need it . 572875_573995
they get rid of that oxygen . 574515_575555
and they go, oh, water . 575915_576775
don't need that . 577015_577595
they give off water . 578255_579075
so that's the waste they give off . 579755_581355
so +...
I thought trees do need water though . 582175_583475
they do need water, yes . 583735_584675
so to make their food, they use water, carbon dioxide and sunlight . 584895_588375
and then they give off oxygen and they give off some water . 588985_592865
that's how we can breathe . 593025_594185
because of oxygen . 594545_595385
oh the oxygen . 595925_596565
yeah, it's kind(of) cool because we take in the oxygen, like you're just saying, right ? 596765_600165
if they need the water +... 600205_600945
and we give off carbon dioxide . 600965_602205
it's a nice partnership . 602205_603125
if they need that water +... 603365_604785
stick down, please . 604785_605405
if they need that water, how come they put it out ? 605685_609785
so if they need water, how come they put it out ? 610485_613105
can you think of any other animals ? 613405_615425
do humans take in water and put out water ? 615805_617725
yeah . 617985_618605
yeah .
unless it's for brushing their teeth . 619645_620885
raise your hand if you put in water into yourself today . 621005_624205
raise your hand if you took water out of yourself today . 624445_626865
you all did because you sweated, at least . 627385_630245
we peed it xxx .
water goes through it . 630805_633325
so, so +... 634105_634445
what goes in must come out . 634485_635445
so knowing what we now know, when I just talked to you guys about trees, do you think trees are decomposers ? 635625_643145
yeah . 643305_643605
talk to the person next to you . 643595_644955
so +... 645735_645775
can I have the microphone please ? 646115_646935
okay . 647835_648895
who wants to say in the group what their thought about that was ? 649595_652395
do you think that trees are decomposers ? 653135_656175
I see two hands . 657575_659615
can I see more hands ? 660015_660915
can I see three hands ? 661795_662635
do I see four hands ? 662775_664295
I see four hands . 664355_664815
I see four, four, four, four . 664815_665295
do I see five hands ? 665355_666055
do I see five hands ? 666095_666815
this sounds like a bet . 668075_668795
xxx I got five hands +... 669675_670815
me and my partner were talking about it and we did agree that they're decomposers . 675425_679705
because, like you just said, that they give away oxygen and water . 679925_685545
so, that does make them like decomposers ? 687705_689845
so are the oxygen, water, things that become part of the soil ? 689925_693425
water, yeah . 694625_695625
mm-hmm .
because soil is wet . 696005_698445
you know what ? 699945_700385
you guys are pushing us a little bit . 700425_702025
sometimes when you come up with a definition in science, you realize, oh, that's a little too simple, we have to make it more complicated . 703805_710185
(be)cause if you start thinking about it, you go, oh, we've got to push on this . 710405_713205
I'm going to push on you guys a little bit too . 713925_715425
no . 715765_716005
because, check this out . 716705_717685
when things decompose, they don't just break things down into simpler parts that are part of soil . 718905_723225
they also break things down into +... 723885_726085
air . 727465_727965
stuff in the air . 728745_729525
I knew it .
I'm a genius . 731265_731805
oh my goodness, you should get a reward . 732845_734245
I want my college degree . 734725_736645
here's an award . 736805_737345
congratulations . 737625_738765
can I skip college now ? 739145_740185
yes . 740385_740665
yes . 741145_741205
PhD . 741885_742265
there you go . 742945_743385
I'm Dr . 744445_745145
S_seven now . 745265_745905
okay . 746745_747205
where's the microphone ? 747365_748225
somebody else want to say: do you think that trees are decomposers ? 748585_753765
we're changing our definition +... 754205_756065
we're evolving our definition of decomposers a little bit, aren't we ? 756565_759125
are trees decomposers ? 760185_761265
who's ready to talk ? 761305_761965
I saw five hands a minute ago . 762085_763245
S_two, go for it . 763765_765865
yes .
and ?
because they take in oxygen and water and they give it out . 768085_775765
which means they take stuff in and give stuff out . 776345_779025
which means they're decomposers . 779225_780705
so the stuff that they're giving out, is at smaller and simpler parts ? 781485_784865
yeah . 785205_785645
yeah, so oxygen and water, you think they're smaller and simpler parts than carbon dioxide and water . 786075_792895
I guess not . 793095_795415
it's hard to know that one . 796255_797435
it sounds to me +... 797675_800415
yeah, go ahead S_four . 800935_802855
wait, hold on . 802855_803515
microphone . 803615_803935
nobody's going to be able to hear you . 804395_805675
well, if the definition of decomposition is to break down into littler parts, do trees +... 809555_817455
because they eat nutrients and stuff, right ? 817695_819815
mm-hmm . 819895_820175
and water . 820435_820955
but do they really +... 821155_821775
so they take nutrients from the soil, which are like vitamins, it's not their food . 822055_825235
it's like vitamins are to us, they need it but it's not their food . 825615_828195
go ahead . 828255_828555
then, do they really break it down though ? 829275_832395
do we +... 832535_832815
so are they breaking down those minerals ? 833775_835335
yeah . 835535_835795
into littler parts ? 836155_837155
what do you guys think ? 838395_839335
yes . 839875_840355
yeah .
they can't . 841715_843815
they can't break the sun . 844095_845375
or they can't break water . 846315_847555
so you're saying, they're not breaking down sunlight, they can't, you're saying . 848995_853855
and they can't break down water into something else . 854415_856835
so you're saying you don't think they're decomposers ? 857255_859415
that's a hard choice, because I agree with both . 860915_865095
mm-hmm . 865355_865615
so it sounds like what we've talked about here is +... 867145_869165
the idea was, is everything that eats something else, a decomposer ? 870025_873585
and then somebody said, well, trees eat things . 873745_875965
and we had to talk about what trees eat, right ? 876045_877805
and we talked about how, what they eat comes from the air and then what they give off, goes into the air . 877905_884225
and when we talked about what decomposition really is, a more +... 885725_888965
it's not just breaking things down to soil, it's actually breaking things down into gas, like carbon dioxide . 889425_893765
and then it sounds like we got into some pretty tricky territory, because you're like, well is oxygen broken down from carbon dioxide ? 895465_902865
can minerals be broken down ? 903305_905065
you know what I love about what you guys just did in this discussion ? 905805_908365
you took me into territory that I have never talked about with anybody . 908585_913045
and I've talked about this with a lot of people . 913225_914545
