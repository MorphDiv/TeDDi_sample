got to be here and what she's doing and what she's done and
so why don't you tell us what you've been doing and how you got
<after> I &~f finished high school I went to a college which was
it was a girls school in Columbia Missouri which was renowned for
specifically uh that overtly <you are a woman therefore you> . 62624_64714
<yes uh huh yuh> this was in forty eight and the influx from
and &~af at Miami I majored in political science and biological
and the latter half of my senior year I was informed that I would
then I came to MWSU and was on the dean of student staff at that
are you the one who uh &~in invented the open door and one foot on
could have been . 131262_132307
uh and at that time they had hired in five new staff members all of
they selected the one who was to be promoted and I went on to
ultimately got moved into budgetary responsibilities within the
you mean it was a new field then Lee or . 174289_175682
for me my first course in sociology was your class
ah haven't you heard the story about my problem in Melby's course ?
I was told to do some reading for on Weber . 185179_187803
and I went to the library and a week later I
how do you spell it ? 195466_199576
but uh I had tried to get into graduate school when I finished my
I needed financial assistance and was denied it again because I was
well these experiences began to develop in me some kind of interest
and my experience at MWSU in the doctoral program was extremely
and then within the department I ran into discrimination in terms
and I was told by the chairman at that time that I could not teach
well subsequently the intrusion +/. 262294_264383
what year was this ? 264383_265173
&=laugh . 265173_265521
whoa whoa whoa uh uh uh what year uh uh ? 265521_266821
that was in nineteen sixty eight . 268400_272510
that locates it pretty specifically doesn't it . 272510_275551
yuh and then another faculty member
and through my performance there and a change of administrative
and uh one of the first questions I asked was you know are women
and is the apparent uh is it that women in fact run into obstacles
and I combined those two in my dissertation I was asking can the
now again pulling from my own experience uh my presumption that I
this was in fifty four . 354917_356379
uh made me wonder to what extent did the kind of socialization
and putting all those things together came up with my research
I since leaving MWSU I have been on the faculty in the
so Lee what di(d) what did you briefly what did you find out ? 395412_399592
in the dissertation ? 399592_400636
yuh why don't you tell us a little bit about what you did in the
in terms of the uh uh test of the three theories that I chose to
and I found that relative deprivation theory which was formulated
then in looking at the background factors I found that two aspects
Adam we have the uh . 461915_463053
and it is the uh the measured variable was whether the respondent
and a very personal variable then added to those four is the thing
and those five acting together account for I believe roughly forty
then radical attitude in conjunction with a value orientation which
when I went through it Lee I had a number of questions uhm and let
<in concern> my concern with the the method I noted two things
you do indicate that you tried to assign them to people on the
uh the in choosing the interviewers I was initially limited to
from among those who were available I tried to select a represented
uh I chose a graduate student who was in sociology . 578665_584238
uh and I chose a woman who was a graduate student in radio and
and there were two seniors one was a major in political science and
and there was a junior whose major was in uh health education and
and the other one was a graduate student too but not degree
<special degree student probably mm hm> . 618325_619718
I believe the major was history . 619718_621274
anybody black ? 621274_623550
pardon ? 623550_624502
was any of your interviewers black ? 624502_625988
no none of the interviewers were black . 625988_627892
okay . 627892_628333
I had made an effort to get a black interviewer she was a student I
do you think that had any impact on the kinds of results you got . 642148_647210
well I can only be partially objective on that . 647210_651041
I did most of the black the interviewing of the black students . 651041_654013
uh I have had considerable experience and training and interviewing
uhm hum . 675701_676119
but uh it could have been . 676119_680647
you had one interview <where she quit in the middle right> ? 680902_682295
<I had one interview where there was extreme anger> at not at
mm hm . 692675_693185
um hum and did she terminated the interview did she did she finish ?
No . 695437_695879
she refused to answer the set of questions on systems constraint
mh . 703193_703797
did you know before you got when you drew your sample now did you
so you don't do you you don't have any way of knowing do you then
that's right uh huh . 724184_725229
well I drew the sample and then I contacted each uh respondent
you contacted them personally ? 737164_738905
yes . 738905_739695
I see . 739695_740206
uh and uh uh I had we had absolutely no refusals from blacks
what was the percentage of refusals ? 748820_751096
what was the percentage of refusals from the whites ? 751096_753185
it varied by class the overall uhm &~acc acceptance rate for the
mm hm . 759896_760314
yuh, it was . 760314_761196
uh the master's group was the group that had the lowest they
yuh . 764935_765190
it was a very high acceptance rate willingness to go along the
I think the N was thirty+two but there were only thirty+two blacks
okay . 785925_786529
we we'd have one hundred per cent of the black respondent
so you did go ahead and use a portion of that one interview though
yes the interview was completed with just the one set of questions
was she an undergraduate woman or a graduate woman ? 813534_814927
she was a graduating senior . 814927_816413
she you know she was finishing at the end of summer and was
I take that back one of the blacks that was drawn in the sample I
oh, yuh . 834803_835221
oh yes yes . 835221_836011
and then she disappeared and I had tried she had been working over
uh hum okay another concern that I had uh Lee was that your use of
see you you've made so many comparisons around here that you
I I y'know I can't do anything more than say that I used the
uhm I felt that that was primarily a preliminary analysis to find
uh and I used those as some control on the very thing you mentioned
yuh the Duncan doesn't have much power basically Duncan
the the Sheff'e test is considerably better but the Tukey of course
uh do you uh uh ever considered a set of findings that you would
<yuh on that particular uhm yuh in that particular> theory I
I'd have to check it but it my my my sense was that the
you might you might also examine your findings to see whether the
uh that is th(ey) tend to fall within some particular domain of
so you might think of your results in those terms again as a check
<one thing which I did which I did not yuh one thing which> I
mm hm I was particularly concerned Lee with the &~th possible
well you did something like twenty+five F tests uh which are
four of those F tests were significant . 1134922_1137453
now of course there were a lot of correlational analyses too and
and yet of course you you go ahead and reject the null hypothesis
I I I really am am confused are you saying that
no I don't think so I don't think those I think the correlations
yes . 1177948_1178552
ooph I've got to find the paper with my notes I did notes on this .
so it wouldn't uh you really ought to have an index . 1182035_1183521
yuh . 1183521_1184055
yuh . 1184055_1185100
different colors for different . 1185100_1186400
yuh you . 1186400_1187259
well basically it it gets down to uh the same problem I think that
well I the uh analysis of variance tests were in examination
mm hm . 1212685_1213126
would the the the . 1213126_1214426
but many of the correlations <feeding into that> were not
<but the inferential> . 1215912_1217212
pardon ? 1217212_1217491
many of the correlations feeding into that were not significant to
the the inferential problem Lee I I'm not sure uh being
well uhm I I don't understand how the analysis of variance tests on
because it it contributes to your assessment of the support or the
I see because in other words because I rejected class as being the
well then are you not arguing that because I got four out of
I think you did accept them . 1325464_1328343
pardon ? 1328343_1329737
you did accept some of them because you you went on to . 1329737_1336633
well no what I understand the argument to be Lee is something like
and that given that you ran twenty+five tests and only a modest
which may been suspect it it's
now if you can point to a pattern if you can point to some reasons
yuh particularly for example if they were in that set of
well well they're pretty different . 1414397_1415349
or or whatever yuh I I don't recall every table in
well you know just as a matter of explanation . 1418808_1421664
yuh . 1421664_1423684
the analysis of the three possible categorical variables class age
now if those values were differentially distributed among age class
what it would have an effect on is raising the question of why is
but it would have no effect on an assessment of whether individuals
hm . 1475418_1476556
and that I that's why I didn't go ahead and do what you are
it was an attempt to explore the possibility that and in part in
hm well I don't pretend to to know a lot about these theories that
but from your presentation of them I got the impression that the
<not really> because if if the theory is saying people with
the only thing that matters is the relationship between the the
now I think in terms of the benefit of of expanding our knowledge
hmm it's not a confounding effect it's a an effect which would
not really because it would indicate that the theory as it stands
what if what if the uh a particular uh set of values or particular
now now admittedly that's an unlikely possibility but
well do that with class and then I'll answer your question on race .
be my guest . 1724708_1725312
okay uhm . 1725312_1727843
it's a logical point that's at issue here . 1727843_1732115
no I'm trying no I'm trying to think of the man's name he writes
I'm glad you have a hard time thinking of his name . 1737061_1738802
I think it it's his causal book but I
at the back of that book he coming at methodological thing but he
should be . 1753385_1754267
because race in essence he says stands for possible differential
or class for that matter an any categorical variable I quite agree
if you know if it overlapped you know if it
then what I think you would have is this category of people these
mm hm . 1793903_1794692
now taking Blalock's uh reasoning then I think what you have to ask
and I see I'm not in any way saying that your questions aren't
hm . 1839205_1840947
okay let's move on because I've been concerned about the
I wondered what your reaction would be to bringing them together in
with the exception of the one value and that is self expression I
theory as you had defined it in terms of the variables <you had
<that's right> . 1923973_1924321
I was trying to say that rather than in conceiving of a value as an
that to move it over into cognitive kind of framework where you
I think your suggestion that that the role of values vis+a+vis
mm, hm . 1977124_1977565
how would you ever find th a triggering mechanism I mean that's an
from the first time they're told that they can't teach a class
it's that may exactly that's a very good example . 2004314_2006590
but uh but how would you identify that I mean particularly . 2006590_2008424
ask a woman . 2008424_2008935
if you're into survey research ask a woman . 2008935_2010421
ask the person yuh well if you find behavior that is identified . 2010421_2013997
would people really know ? 2013997_2014600
oh sure I I suspect they would well at at least the class of people
well yuh but but as just one of the things Lee doesn't have you
mm hm . 2064337_2064871
and that's that's ya know ya call that a triggering mechanism well
yuh . 2078896_2080289
well . 2080289_2083586
in terms of the background variables Lee would do you think it
you certainly look at lots of them and uh . 2093246_2095870
I uh I think the main thing that came out of the analys the two
and that is that uh when in research people go in and take two or
uhm this is simply going to produce a proliferation of family
autonomy and independence dependence and possibly looking at the
now again I didn't think I could go into it in the dissertation but
bravo . 2183479_2185034
I di I think that's in there
mm hm . 2210808_2211598
you might you might get your new vice president for development in
yuh you see that to me was the was
and you see because I had designed
mm hm . 2237210_2237651
and I had not thought of introducing self concept at that point in
well there's been some very interesting work yours
and if you'll notice I did slip away from the variables a little
thank god you didn't think about it Lee we'd have four hundred more
that's right a few other little
well we can come back to em Sherm do you wanna . 2278936_2282605
yuh uh yeah let me pick up uh briefly uh on a sort of a a a prior
I the in the preface er the prefacing uh set of assertions in the
uh uh competing in what sense do you see them as logically
do you see them simply as having buil be been built in uh to
I see them as competing in the sense of a basic issue in role
uh whether the Lin Linton Parsons concept of role the passive
okay . 2365593_2366638
an and the cognitive or the Gurin theory really is coming out of
I see but but that also suggests the possibility of an integration .
if values are not conceived of as internalized parts of a
I mean I'm not suggesting the manner in which they are using them
now once you move them they are no longer competing . 2433883_2437204
okay okay . 2437204_2438666
Well Sh Sherm just out of curiousity th que one of the
uh no I I uh not really although given uh uh Lee's response . 2454525_2461584
it gets built back into uh uh the question I was asking . 2461584_2466042
no I simply struck by the the uh notion of a set of theories uh uh
I think as the theories are formulated in terms of their basic
the underlying <the underlying structures> within which these
<underlying assumptions> . 2511414_2512111
concepts part okay mm no
it would indeed seem strange if any kind of cognitive theory
yuh I had hoped to make that clear with my uh a approaching the
I've got a couple of uh particulars uh you go you read this and
awake or asleep ? 2554952_2556159
uh no no awake . 2556159_2557994
sometimes it's hard to uh see uh the forest for the trees and it
uh one is the uh the anomaly in your finding on differential
it's strange that uh juniors uh be uh comparatively radical . 2577498_2585695
it's strange in a sense or at least it seems to me to call for some
uh the the uh set of anomalies a lack of any uh uh continuous
I I can address myself to the PHD student I think somewhat
wi le let me get do you think it might well be a random
no I think there's probably a systematic ah phenomena with the
the junior women may well be random I'm not sure but with the PHD
I mean they were going to be able to get into college teaching or
they had been accepted into graduate school they had overcome the
okay . 2660277_2661670
and uh were not concerned about changing the structure or altering
every PHD woman that was mar I had them married and not married
now I just really think that they were not subject to in their own
been interesting if you'd a gone on . 2707042_2707924
what ? 2707924_2708272
I said it'd be been interesting if you'd gone on if you had
<not here not here> . 2716980_2718884
<if you'll notice> th that the one condition under which I
now I can't address myself to the question of their background
as to the junior women . 2765162_2767601
well what about something . 2767601_2769853
Sherm about the junior women do you remember Jim
Monroe ? 2773870_2774822
Monroe in social science . 2774822_2776053
no no . 2776053_2776912
he did a study of uh West Point . 2776912_2779280
and what he found was a uh uh very interesting distribution of
and that was that the freshmen were gung ho and became more cynical
this is true particularly for women in a time when there is some
I'm sure that junior women are similar to the men who are saying
<mm but> then why why the recovery by seniors from that . 2839119_2841487
I have no idea . 2841487_2842462
point of view uh one might add to that general line of explanation
<first year students> . 2853608_2855349
hm ? 2855349_2855697
first year students . 2855697_2856324
fresh persons first year students well I I
female first year students . 2864056_2865101
come in relatively naive vis_a_vis these things uh the first couple
uh being told they exist being told the the nature of the barriers
for the seniors . 2910914_2911518
for the seniors yuh . 2911518_2912470
but that's it they have they have to scale down their radicalism if
uh well the al the alternative is to say I'm going out there and by
that's not realistic though . 2922919_2924243
they're more likely to think I've got to come in terms with it's
i it was it was the realities of the marketplace quote unquote that
mm . 2943492_2943748
the response to the reality of the situation . 2943748_2945234
response to the realities right of the pressures . 2945234_2947161
cert one of the things that the seniors were interviewed in from
so I was not getting a spring . 2958400_2961256
I uh I me I mean then my question comes would you find more of a
yuh . 2971356_2971635
mm hm . 2971635_2972146
uh see I literally got them when they had only been seniors for a
but y you know Sherm there's one thing there is th I don't think
oh yes . 2995923_2996364
in the late sixties an(d) . 2996364_2997920
in the late sixties ? 2997920_2998617
and even in the seventies I mean I think th as a matter of fact
uh there's been a lot in the press since about seventy
ya know this phenomena of the doctoral woman is in part if you'll
well there's some women who never didn't know they had a problem
and then she discovered it with a vengeance .
&=laugh made up for it since . 3071852_3073593
yuh yuh . 3073593_3074290
no Clara's uh judging from Clara's personal experience uh was not
yuh but now she you know I read something that that she had done
and there might be some reconstruction of history in the process
yuh I'm sure . 3102177_3102943
there's another finding that I uh that a that's well it's uh it's
that they're out of line for the different ? 3143090_3144391
yuh yuh . 3144391_3145784
uh the only explanation I could offer is that there might be a
the more legitimate the issue appears to be although it may not be
because we found that on the Viet Nam and the race issue which I
mm . 3190924_3191620
ah they're just more willing to participate that's the only
hm uh I I think the <partic mm> . 3204089_3210266
<it'd be interesting to> know wh what triggered the violent
the Suffragettes in England who were very violent in contrast of
<I had not a great many> but I had some women that in
was it clear what was meant by violence ? 3230212_3232650
I mean it's one thing somebody would say
<the fence post> yes &=laugh . 3238571_3239546
they would call that violence but there's another thing to go out
they did that too . 3247209_3248950
my notes uh my notes are sketchy here but I I I think the point
my notes read and I quote as follows maybe you can reconstruct the
finding on lower r's for joining organizations in marching strikes
I don't remember at the moment precisely uh what the the the . 3273099_3278672
wha what it may be is that in Guttman scaling of behaviors they
there is a lower ranking . 3287472_3288796
they got they got the order on the have is quite
logically the order on the anticipate represents increasing risk . 3294369_3298386
mm hm . 3298386_3298897
and I would presume that availability of opportunity and the form
on the . 3314315_3314849
yuh . 3314849_3315545
have engaged in . 3315545_3316242
that they have participated in uh an i it it uh comes down to ease
mm . 3331311_3331845
going out and participating actively . 3331845_3333657
I think it's a pretty mundane type of explanation but I'm sure it
yuh as Pat says there there are hundreds of members of the AAUP
right &=laugh . 3345150_3346033
ther there's uh to shift gears a little bit uh your earlier comment
uh race is a a question uh uh that I think can be raised on a large
the particular form that I've raised my que raise the question out
a an from Flack's work you see it as a socialization into values
uh it's also however it seems to me an opportunity variable . 3404501_3410260
upper middle class family represents a an amount of resources
and at that point I the obvious question becomes uh y'know what
uh is it one is it the other is it both is it something else . 3433434_3439007
uh the y'know there's no there's no inherent connection between in
uh or in this case a class position and socialization uh no
uh I understand the question I I'm somewhat confused
I I don't think I'm really raising a question about the finding . 3472443_3475160
oh oh okay . 3475160_3476042
I'm simply raising the question about the the process by which one
well +/. 3485539_3486398
in this case again the assignment of a socialization meaning to a
I I I was I think I was directed permitted myself to be directed by
and uh in essence what he was doing is uh because he had taken the
and I I was attempting to address the question of is it unique to a
uh now I didn't introduce opportunity primarily because I was being
yuh but now if if we <go beyond that point> . 3537202_3539199
<but I y'know I think> your question was not answered by my
I think uh I I suppose my more general point is uh that uh uh given
so in effect what you ought to do at some point is to raise the
uh you run into these problems all the time when we use uh when we
SES that stands for background variables and that's
now that's one way of interpreting it uh but there are certainly
systems constraint variables
uh uh I was thinking of like why people who say take reports of
that's right &=laugh . 3630710_3631313
&=laugh . 3631313_3632103
I I didn't pursue that line since those particular variables were
then is it the uh I have a question and again it's abstracted from
rather are the proportions of variance these explain uh independent
<I didn't> directly uh I think maybe there's one sentence in
how high were they do you remember ? 3715091_3716670
two uh general kinds of things . 3722742_3727617
um one goes back to something that Pat was talking about before . 3727617_3731100
uhm and that is when you talked about these uh values theories what
uhm why it is you never uh chose some contemporary notions such as
y'know why you didn't intr introduce those notions because
I it wasn't brought into the initial framing of the uh research
uh now I then did not incorporate in an interpretation when I went
I mean this had be this was the common uh previous experience that
and I wasn't rejecting the exchange theory interpretation in in any
now the particular variables measured were not measuring
and since I was not measuring actual interaction between the
although uh . 3923431_3924476
I was getting recall data really of end states which is an
but in your interpretation though you talk about the uh part the
you know the act of going to your parent and asking for advice or
so in effect you were bordering y'know you did draw on some of the
uh d certainly I I was influenced by that kind of a theory but I I
I mean I felt that I was using questionable data using recall data
well if you were going to do it again y'know I said you indicated
what I think I would prefer to do is take bits and pieces of this
for example one area that I'm very interested in researching is
and I would see this as requiring a population of younger people in
now I'm just sitting here wondering James how would you uh I mean I
now it could be done but there's certainly
I mean it's just like saying well probably attribution theory or
uh yuh to some extent . 4103362_4105034
as I as I read read the ah especially the last part where y'know
uhm implicit in that discussion y'know reading between the lines so
like the great stress that Lee places on uhm the as I said before
so it seems to me that what's happening is that children are
and ah somehow as a process there of children picking and choosing
because a network of of exchanges is built up over time which uh
y'know wha so so what led them uhm to decide those were the
why couldn't they get them in traditional kinds of exchanges and
yuh I just felt that it required a different research setting than
<sure I agree I agree> that's why I asked you if you were doing
I wouldn't I think I as I said I would prefer to break
well that leads me onto my second kind of question if I may uhm
you don't mean the N of tables ? 4286475_4287799
no no . 4287799_4289796
you you mean the the N of black respondents ? 4289796_4291978
no no the the . 4291978_4292396
the overall N . 4292396_4293279
the overall N ? 4293279_4293790
it's it's not so small &=laugh come on &=laugh . 4293790_4296321
it depends on your field he deals with . 4296321_4297110
small by large by psychologists &~st standards of research
three hundred that's a very uh &=laugh sizable N &=laugh . 4301545_4303124
well to the level of generalization though that she see y'know
to develop or inhibit radicalism ? 4339069_4339696
which is it &=laugh ? 4339696_4340741
well creativity &=laugh uh could you really convince me uh how how
first I'd try to ascertain what kind of criteria you use for
I I mean if I spend uh a hundred thousand dollars to revise the
I don't think that's Lee's question James Lee's
she wants to know what do you need to have in order to have it
<okay> well I mean what are the scientific criteria that uh
uh the scientific criteria would almost have to restrict you either
I did not attempt to present or even do the statistical analysis of
I don't think you can go beyond the population . 4424286_4427073
I I would think that the the framework in which some convincing
I don't think it's to be found in this study alone by itself but
I think that's the only basis on which a practitioner can gain any
this simply is saying it holds for women too but that's all it's
well no I think there's an implicit claim beyond that Lee I think
I like . 4529728_4532166
well I I I think in terms of some of the kinds of criteria that y
I guess that's all I have to say but I hell I don't know James if I
I want also ask Lee how how she uh moved so far in working for Zeb
seen the truth . 4581903_4584341
I took a seminar in symbolic interaction . 4584341_4588521

that was a good class that time a lot of good people in that class .

uh huh . 4678753_4679171
I went to five thirty . 4679171_4679961
where you talk about firstly it is assumed that the mother does not

okay . 4689806_4690317
on the processes within the family but that she is accounting for

number one how uh what's behind your first statement and then how
uh many but not all of the studies that have looked at children's
and you're just accepting that then (..) ? 4765039_4766595
and they often do not ask the mother they simply ask the father . 4766595_4772167
I don't think you've heard Lee's er Lee I don't think you heard
no I'm rejecting it and saying the mother should be identified as
okay yuh that wasn't entirely clear as a matter of fact this is
<yuh I was in essence rejecting> uh the methodological
uh huh . 4809644_4810062
do you have any suggestions Lee for how you would modify that uh uh
I think that we simply have got to stop uh classifying families by
so how would you uh what would you substitute uh ? 4831494_4835766
I would I would simply if you want to use stratification variables
one possibility Lee uh would be rather than and as a matter of fact
I I I would agree and I think in a way it might mean setting up a
<yuh not many people have I just thought maybe you had> . 5012471_5015954
I was simply trying to find out if it was worth thinking about &~an
you talk about breaking down some of the work that you've done in

<not randomly> associated with with what structures are

I don't know serialize it in some journal

you have an article in this last point you were making

you'd better stop I'm sorry I asked . 5329472_5331840

I I don't think I'm on uh bad ground . 5332537_5334882

well don't they all ? 5344890_5345772
no . 5345772_5346190
well why have they never told us that . 5346190_5350021
but I just I really found it to be a fascinating &~ex experience . 5350021_5354294
would you advise other graduate students to collect their own data
absolutely . 5357962_5358473
do you think that's part of the problem on that is why some ? 5358473_5362490
using canned data out of the uh computer banks I think takes two
uh uh doesn't it really depend on what you find to be the
uh clearly for your kind of problem extant data they
no it didn't no it didn't . 5380323_5380950
and you you have had to resort to inferences ten miles long to
let me answer it this way if you frame your question independent of
yuh . 5423698_5423954
and you're still interested in this aren't you ? 5423954_5426485
oh yuh very much so . 5426485_5427344
I don't know how I felt the day after I finished
yuh but I think that's the key James it's it's the degree to which
mm hm . 5440672_5441276
&=sigh okay why don't you go get a drink and there's a room up here
I'll be in the room at the head of the stairs . 5456608_5458094

you told me that I should have been

whereas I was facing another direction and that explains why uh why
oah . 5482034_5482916
okay . 5482916_5483613
so how do you do you wanta make some uh
well uh I mean she's it's quite clear uh what she said that she
I mean she could not have written seven thousand pages &=laugh if
and uh in terms of what a dissertation should be <a> <a> a
uh this meets all those criteria and I would certainly be in favor
are you going to have some some some suggestions for her in
<more general> more oral kinds of things . 5534372_5536113
I mean there were a lot of <th> thing that Pat mentioned where
you know . 5542893_5543520
one had to read that three or four times before it became clear
and there's a lot of that uh +//. 5547955_5548814
of course sociologists are afflicted +... 5548814_5550556
when a number of them turn out to be negative and so that you're
I mean I talked to her about ways she could y'know I said can we
and it y'know I had this experience when I was doing my I started
I got into one chapter was two+hundred and twenty pages long and I
and I took the last page out of the typewriter and I said I'll come
so you say pass . 5590586_5592327
oh yuh . 5592327_5593117
and di ah di is that a uh uh that's a neutral term . 5593117_5597645
I'm not <sure> . 5597645_5600268
<I mean> I <know it's> . 5600268_5601917
<we don't need> no uh what are you looking for <Adam> ? 5601917_5604611
<well> I'm I'm I I I just I guess I have in the back of my mind
<of the committee's response> to the enterprise as a whole . 5611763_5614828
hm . 5614828_5615083
well I think my sense is that uh she has done a good job . 5615663_5620539
and she certainly has uh I mean th this project for her has been
and at the stage of her professional development I think this is
certainly she ought to be commended for the very thing th that Pat
I think in the future she'll have to develop some sense of what
<but> but that may just come come with ex obvious she can't she
problem with that in the dissertation James is that
right right yuh . 5658342_5659386
right but I think I think though she felt this
herself . 5661569_5662428
yuh her fell herself she wasn't really worried about us looking
and so she probably has to develop that sense but I think that'll
oh I I think part of it was that you know that the questions &~th
she got to thinking about kinds of questions . 5676267_5678891
not necessarily about specific things but I I mean I think she's
mm hm . 5687692_5688295
Sherm ? 5688295_5689085
uh it's a fine job by my lights uh I would have wished it were
I have some sympathy for the twenty+five page psych dissertations .
it's th d uh us the uh uh Lee &~th the one comment I'd
and that's &~f that that's fine . 5726515_5727746
uh but it's also uh a limit . 5727746_5730881
uh because it leads her uh for example not to ask such questions as
it is true that in this literature the class variable is
but that's not necessarily the case if you start from the more
rather than the more particular question of given the theories
uh uh uh she could I think write some of this stuff up within the
uh so that she's she's not necessarily limited although I I well
uh I reacted to that forty year old woman comment uh because I
well I can tell you what her view on that is and that
but I'm smarter &=laugh yuh yuh . 5839713_5840758
and I and I've really got to produce and I'm going to . 5840758_5843637
Adam along those lines does she see the length of time it took her
<actually it's> it's not all that long given the norm in
that I think that the uh the first draft of her proposal was less
and then she did collect you know a substantial amount of data
and I don't know that uh uh given that she did collect her own data
uh and a tremendous amount of analysis I don't know that it was
uh James may be thinking more of her total graduate
uh huh . 5895278_5895975
but I I do also yuh that's true and I and I think
<mm I would hope so> . 5908862_5910882
mm hm to what extent are these the three theories that
<they are indeed> . 5917662_5918196
<that's it> that's it . 5918196_5918359
yuh yuh <no more theories> . 5918359_5919241
<oh they are the theories> ? 5919241_5920797
that's about it . 5920797_5921842
<yuh yuh they are &~th> . 5921842_5922817
<they are not really representative then> ? 5922817_5923513

<xxx a sample of one> ? 5925510_5926903

there are variations on themes uh but cl uh but I don't know of any
no well except for the sense that . 5944341_5945549
so nobody nobody would attack her on that ground then if she . 5945549_5947732
no no no . 5947732_5947917
oh no I don't think so I think the only thing that would be

right Spilerman's stuff mm hm . 5973436_5974295
yuh . 5974295_5974643
