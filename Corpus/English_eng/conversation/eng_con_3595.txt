okay .
you can begin .
once there was a little boy who caught a frog .
nice start .
while he was sleeping the frog got out_of his <jar> jar and
when the boy woke up he was really sad about his frog not being
<he looked> he looked in his boots .
and the dog put his head in the frog's jar .
when the boy opened the window all the way the dog was on the
he fell out then and fell down head first .
<then he land> <then when he fell> when he landed <he>
the boy called out <for his dog> for his frog .
he looked down a gopher hole .
and then the gopher bit his nose .
hum .
the dog pushed on a hornets nest .
on a tree where a hornets nest was .
then knocked it down while the boy was looking in a tree .
and then an owl pushed the boy out_of the tree .
and the hornets started chasing the dog .
then the owl came out_of the tree .
and made the boy get up on a rock .
and the dog came back over to the rock where the boy was .
and caught him up .
and then a deer poked his head up .
<and the> while the dog stuck his head behind the rock .
then the <&-um deer> stag I should probably say ran with the
and the dog chasing the stag who dropped them both into a pond .
so you think it's a stag not a deer .
yeah .
it's a male .
umhum (be)cause it has antlers .
you're right .
and then the boy fell into a pond .
<he> behind a log he heard a sound .
he said +"/.
+" quiet !
to his dog and looked over the log .
and then there's a frog <with> with his mate .
and lots_of little froglings .
well <they> probably they'd be tadpoles .
hum .
not little baby frogs .
the boy walks back home with a baby frog .
the end .
wow !
that was a really good story .
wow !
that was a really good story .

www .
okay .
this story is called frog where are you ?
a boy is calling out to his frog probably saying frog where are you
umhum .
<and > <and then the dog> and his dog is probably feeling
and the frog is hiding right there .
that's great .
maybe if you wanted to sort of tell me sort of a why sentence .
like why something is happening .
you might say they can't see the frog because he's under the log .
something like that .
once there was a little boy who had a frog .
he's very happy he has a frog .
but his dog looks kind of worried because the frog probably looks
good .
while the boy was sleeping the frog climbs out_of the jar probably
when the boy wakes up and finds the frog is gone he's really very
he looks in his boots .
and the dog looks in the jar .
<he probably> he's probably feeling very bad right now .
when he opens the window he's calling probably where are you frog
and <the> the dog is sitting on the window sill .
<and falls out> and he falls out .
the boy looks even more worried now because his frog fell out_of
<and then> and now he looks mad <because the frog>
now he's probably calling frog where are you ?
again and the dog is +...
www .
and the dog looks pretty mad at some hornets .
&-um okay .
and <the dog's> the boy's yelling into the hole of a gopher .
and the dog is yipping at the hornets nest .
and the gopher comes out and bites his nose .
and the dog starts pushing on the tree .
is he saying anything there ?
he's saying where are you frog where are you ?
oh right .
then &-um the dog pushes the hornets nest down .
and they look pretty mad .
and then the boy is yelling into a hole in a tree where are you
then an owl pushes him out .
and the hornets start chasing the dog who looks pretty scared .
<and then the boy> and then the owl starts making the boy
and the boy doesn't look very happy about it .
no .
then the dog comes back looking sad .
and +...
is he +/.
and the boy's yelling where are you frog ?
where are you ?
mhm .
<and then> and some of the sticks turn out to be a stag's
<and the boy> and then the stag starts running with the boy on
and the dog is yipping at them .
how does the boy feel when he's up there on the stag's head ?
probably pretty scared .
yeah probably .
I've seen a moose .
<and I> when I was in New Hampshire I saw a moose on the trail

<and then> <and then the &-um> then the stag throws the
mhm .
the boy lands with the dog on top of him .
mhm .
and then the boy hears something .
he says ssh !
to his dog <and looks over> and looks over a log .
and there's his frog with his mate .
<and when> <and about> and about nine baby frogs .
