&~www .
there was this boy with a frog .
and the frog escaped while he was asleep .
&-um and the boy looked everywhere for it .
and &-um the dog got his head stuck in the &-er jar .
and &-um the dog fell out the window and broke the jar .
so there was nothing for the frog to live in .
<and he was looking in> so he went into the forest .
and he shouted down a hole .
and this like squirrel came out or something .
and &-um &-um the dog was barking at a bees' nest .
and the bees' nest fell down .
and the boy was up a tree trying to look <in a> <in the other>
but there was an owl .
the dog was being chased by some bees .
and the &-um owl tried to attack the little boy .
so he got onto a stone and shouted up there .
and he fell onto a deer .
and the deer took him and threw him off a cliff .
and &-um he fell into a pond .
and then he &-um &-er looked in the &-er <empty tree thing>
but they weren't .
and then he looked over the side of it .
and there were two frogs a male and a female .
and they had lots_of babies .
and he took one of babys home .
