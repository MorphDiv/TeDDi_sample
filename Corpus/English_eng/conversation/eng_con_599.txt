exactly The price is considerably better . 2078072_2083932
Two eighty a month . 2083962_2085772
Exactly much much better than any pokes in the eye with a sharp
So what does it did Philip pay up on time . 2089522_2092332
Always excellent on that yes he 's a toad in some ways but in other
What about Paul . 2098052_2098352

not wanting to sit in the conservatory . 2352882_2354652

winter and then you know you have to sort of use a plate to . 2356492_2358582
Yes . 2358582_2358622
and Dave said why do n't we . 2358802_2360502
Yes . 2360502_2360572
have a couple of trays and I know it 's so easy . 2360582_2362422

They are and I I think the whole trouble with Jenny was that not
I do n't . 2463452_2464112
And I think she found looking after tiny children a bit too much
Did n't like she was more the career girl was n't she I think . 2467962_2471012
She should have stayed in beauty therapy she 's a very gentle and
She 's very good at it was n't she . 2475932_2477392
