&~www .
&-um the there's a little boy and a f(rog) &-um dog who
and they go to sleep for the night .
and then the frog escapes .
and in the morning they find he's gone .
and then they are looking everywhere for him .
and then they look out the window .
and then &-um and the little boy is calling out to the frog .
and then &-um the dog falls out the window and breaks the glass jar
and then the boy is a bit annoyed with the dog .
okay .
and so they go into the woods .
and then the little boy carries on calling for him .
uhhuh .
and &-um there they look down holes .
and &-um they look by some bees' nest hive thing .
and then &-um the boy looks up the tree .
and the bees come out and try to sting the dog .
uhhuh .
and then an owl comes out .
and then the &-um boy get(s) falls off the tree .
and then the dog's chased being chased by bees .
okay .
and then the they &-um look round by some rocks and things .
then a deer comes up or a stag or whatever it is .
and then &-um they get chased off a little cliff edge sort of thing
they land in a pond .
and then &-um in the end they &-um look over this &-um log that's
like the boy's telling the dog to be quiet .
and then they &-um look over the log .
and then they find a little family of frogs .
and so &-um they decided to take one home with them .
