in itself . 0_710
could you &-um elaborate a little bit . 3570_6230
what are some developmental benchmarks that you look for in
well properties . 13040_14980
I'm go for that opportunity . 16730_17960
why . 19590_19740
but where do they come from . 19910_21790
what were you trying to get them . 22150_22860
to well instead_of trying to get them from the point where . 22970_27110
well no that's not a triangle that's like a witch's hat . 27200_31440
I'm like . 32070_32390
well isn't that a triangle . 32530_33830
no that's a witches' hat that very tall and triangle . 33910_37430
this is a triangle . 37520_38410
so trying to get them beyond like an equilateral triangle . 39040_42800
yep . 43070_43240
the kind that because I'm second if you were gonna have a test
that's the one they show you . 47310_48480
&-um so getting them first to just go beyond a very limited very
I mean they all come to second grade knowing circle triangle square
oh yeah I know my shapes . 63920_65470
&-um or what do you know about them . 66180_67370
&-um so trying to get them to bring other shapes into that
and then getting them to put into words what their definition
getting them to see it as a definition . 80370_82230
what do you look for when you look at a shape to decide whether
well I look for three sides . 87690_88790
okay . 89380_89480
what else do you look for . 89840_90390
I look for three corners . 90520_91240
anything else . 91770_92350
no . 92470_92600
well how_come then this one here that you said . 93440_95270
no that's not a triangle . 95290_96070
that's a witches hand . 96090_96920
I see one two three sides I see one two three corners is a triangle
well no no . 101940_103160
and that orientation that that determines when my kids come to
oh no that's now it's a square . 113340_114850
now it's a diamond . 116320_116900
wait . 117150_117280
make a very good square in my head . 117590_118860
<square diamond> square diamond because it's tilted up on its
especially if it's not flat on a base and pretty_much an
many of my kids will say . 132190_133150
nope not a triangle . 133300_134030
so that's what I want them to do to just see how far they'll go . 134700_139410
putting into words what it is . 139460_141040
they look for . 141060_141650
and then making differentiations between shapes that are kind of
like if a square is four sides and four corners and a rectangle is
how_come you never say rectangle when I point to this square . 151480_154720
how_come you've never call this a square . 155080_156520
how long skinny rectangle . 156800_157650
hmm . 158420_158540
but until someone makes them say that and put into words what it is
so and then getting them once they've cemented like square
and we can actually struggle through putting towards how I know
trap as it's parallelograms whatever hexagons . 182400_185980
&-um and getting them to try to see that this knowledge I have
can I use anything that I've figured out from talking about
stop . 204560_204660
it's okay . 210280_210710
<I have> I have probably eight or nine minutes before I have to
I think I've exhausted your questions . 215410_216870
yeah . 217430_217590
I think you have two . 217690_218270
okay . 218680_218920
&-uh we just need to &-um let's put a dummy question in that you
still not done . 233140_233590
&-um . 235950_236020
but that's because I put something . 236070_237150
how do you . 237510_237720
&-um I'm just curious about the the process you you were
&-um how do you decide which way to go from what they throw out to
I don't know . 255510_255980
you don't . 256240_256490
dunno .
we just do it . 256630_257180
&-um hold . 257730_259980
I mean I do like what we talked about . 260589_262490
but how do you tell someone else what to do . 262770_266380
&-um . 266970_267170
I don't know . 269700_269970
or maybe it's a question of how do you make them feel comfortable .
not necessarily knowing . 273050_274580
know make teachers that comfortable . 276490_277950
necessarily . 278630_278970
knowing what's gonna happen . 278990_279830
yeah . 280140_280380
is that part of it . 280630_281290
or you were talking about . 281470_282130
yeah . 282190_282380
well I mean I think . 282550_283170
well the first year I had a very specific plan . 283190_285660
you know I knew what . 285890_286520
I that's . 286590_286910
okay . 286990_287280
I'm sorry . 287370_287660
I think when you start out you have a very specific plan and it's
and it's day by day . 297490_298480
and it's I hope they're thinking about this by then . 298600_301600
but you know they're doing then they show you something . 302200_305080
you didn't even guess that they would do . 305100_306520
they start conjecturing . 306540_307720
they start saying . 308470_308800
gosh . 309320_309400
does that work with every core square . 310330_311720
if you do an up down Flip does it look exactly like if you do this
well how do you not go with that . 316110_317800
you're like . 317980_318210
okay . 318330_318570
we have to test . 318820_319450
&-um but I never thought ahead of time . 320040_322680
you know we'll start doing these these . 323210_324520
&-um we'll start manipulating these core squares . 325450_327040
and someone's going to you know make this hypothesis . 327060_330410
they're gonna conjecture they're gonna say . 330520_331930
is that a rule does that always happen . 332040_334090
but once you see that happen the first time then you're listening
you're watching for that . 338570_339400
and when that comes up you know we take time for this now . 339480_342800
and we see how ready they are to talk about this . 342880_345360
and if they're very ready you spend a_lot_of time . 345480_347450
and if they're not ready you keep listening for the next time it
and then you spend a little more time with that . 351570_353290
&-um I don't know how you get someone comfortable with that . 353880_358100
I think once you know if the emphasis all year is on kids and what
then by the time I get to this unit I know what something for me to
this before the quilt unit . 379960_381140
I think it would be much more lockstep . 381640_383270
and it would be it would go the way I had it planned . 383720_386190
and we would get about as much done in a day as I had planned . 386590_388960
and the next day we would do about what I had planned . 389120_390850
but all year these kids have gotten the message from me that I care
you know I want you to try new things . 397250_398420
I want you to talk about what you're thinking . 398590_400090
you know no idea is too wild . 401670_403020
no idea is too crazy . 403100_404180
so by this unit I mean that's just the way we do things . 405050_407270
&-um you know from day one they didn't look at me like . 408030_411470
what is she saying . 411790_412660
when I said . 412710_413300
well what do you think about that . 413320_414460
their hand shot up . 415250_416050
and they were ready to tell me what they were thinking about . 416160_418060
so that's just the way our classroom runs what what they're
and how they describe to someone else what it is . 425080_427980
they're thinking and defend their ideas or how they challenge
that's what we do all day every day . 435120_437380
so . 438260_438350
I I can just aren't you afraid that you would lose lose
and &-uh it would get disorganized . 443020_445510
and had to get them back to the right order . 445560_448590
and make sure that they learn what they're supposed to learn . 449300_452870
well I mean I for three days I don't think it's oh yeah that was
I mean a couple hours I go off on a tangent or an afternoon ends up
but I do have that that overall sequence in mind that scope and
I would like to expose you to <this and this and> this and
I mean we did get to a point where I said . 474280_475600
we have to begin final quilts today because otherwise we won't
and winter break is here . 479920_480820
so I mean I still am a teacher . 481170_482180
I still make decisions about timing and scheduling . 482480_485460
and when we simply have to say I'm sorry . 485540_488460
eight more of you are ready to share . 488480_489980
but we don't have time but I don't have to always be the person in
I think they realize that that they do have some control over
it's not just me up front talking and them listening . 501590_503970
it's me getting (th)em started and me listening and all of the rest
and if somebody says something neat . 508270_510210
I mean and I often let them know I had no idea we were gonna talk
&-um we have to keep talking about this or that idea intrigues me .
I wanna explore with that for . 519150_520299
well let's test that . 520350_521100
what do you think about that . 521409_522130
and that's a good way of capturing their attention too . 522900_524980
they're like . 525030_525340
hey this isn't what the teacher had planned for us today . 525390_527970
this must be good . 528020_528900
we're not doing what she thought we would be . 529410_530940
doing &-um . 530990_531840
are you aware though as you were going . 533410_534790
along keeping record of what they are learning . 535450_537630
&-um I have early like journal samples of your samples . 539800_543730
mean . 543980_544100
yeah . 544410_544520
yeah . 545410_545520
how do you do that . 545680_546320
well I'm like hell . 548740_549340
two days ago . 549740_550190
no one knew how to deal with me . 550350_551910
first between a flip and a turn . 552080_552990
and look they're all flipping and turning . 553090_554390
&-um just watching what they're doing . 555060_557870
talking to them about what they're doing . 557890_559590
reading their writings . 560390_561400
&-um going back and looking at earlier samples of you know thing
