so you're going to be measuring, for example, .
the doorway, again, with your measurement, .
with your unit of measure .
but today it will be different .
because, last time you measured the doorway, .
you just had a pile of units .
that you carried from place to place with you .
today when you measure with your unit, .
you'll have your own measuring tape, .
that you made from your units .
do you think it will be easier .
to measure these things in our classroom today .
with your unit or harder ?
harder .
easier .
let's hear, um, .
some justifications for both of those ideas .
who thinks it will be easier .
measuring with your own unit today .
or easier measuring with .
nicoles or Jennas or Ashleys or whatever .
and can you tell me why .
they think they might have an easier time today ?
ashley, why do you think .
it will be easier to measure with Ashleys today ?
well, cuz, um, before it was hard, well, .
it's going to be easier because .
it's on one strip and you can just put it there .
instead of spending all your time .
trying to get them straight and stuff .
okay, Ashley says it is going to be easier .
because she still has her Ashleys .
they're still the same size , .
but they are all connected, they're all laid down neat, .
and she can just slide them down .
xxx .
ashley, but yours is like, .
when you measure like the chalk board tray, .
you'll have to start all over, .
and you'll have to remember the number, .
and you have to go where the one is, .
and xxx .
brittany, when Ashley measured .
the chalkboard tray last time did she have .
enough units to go the whole way ?
no, Ashley's unit is about, about that big, .
right, Ashley ?
I mean it's not, it's not a very large unit of measurent .
when she, she had to lay each one of those down .
one at a time .
and then, Brittany, right, it didn't go the whole way .
she had to keep track of where that was .
and go and get them one at a time and bring them up .
what will Ashley be able to do today ?
but she'll, she'll have to keep her hand at the spot, .
and then she will have to bring it and move it .
but that's going to be a lot faster than .
taking her eleven other units at one at a time .
putting them ahead of that one, .
and then moving those eleven up .
they are a little harder .
a little harder ?
what, the part that will be harder is the, .
keeping track of the spot where your last unit left off .
like if Ashley's tape measure ends at ten Ashleys, .
and she, and wherever, she puts her finger there, .
and then lifts up the measuring tape to move it over, .
she's got to make sure that finger doesn't move, .
so she can start the Ashleys over again from there .
xxx in the way of the eraser .
no I mean the, um, .
no, you can't, the things won't be in the chalkboard tray .
as the people come up and measure, .
they'll do just what they did last time, .
and lay them down here on the floor .
you're going to be measuring .
each thing you measure two times .
once with the tape measure you made .
and once with a standard tape measure .
they marked the whole units .
they marked the whole inch units .
they did add extra lines like some of you did, .
when you made your own measuring tapes .
but, they didn't label any of them .
you'll need to know what those mean .
what's this one here .
in between the one inch and the two inch ?
half, half .
half of a what ?
half of an inch .
half of an inch, what about here ?
one fourth of an inch .
what if something goes from the beginning of the ruler, .
it doesn't go all the way to one inch, .
but it goes to right there ?
that would be three fourths .
three fourths what ?
two three fourths of an inch .
that's right, good job .
uh, does it mean, .
it doesn't matter that if you couldn't tell .
that by looking at this here .
but what I am saying to you, .
when you use this standard one, think the same way .
you thought about dividing your own units .
if it didn't end right on a whole unit, .
you had to look at the parts you divided, .
your unit into .
justin divided his Justin, Justins .
first he divided them in half .
and then he found out where he would .
have to divide to divide them into fourth .
right now, .
his tape measure that he made from Justins shows, .
whole Justins, half Justins, and fourths or fourths .
can you hold that ?
sure, uh, let, let's uh, okay .
now you're going to have to help me out .
show me how you measure, .
so I can understand what your question is ?
hold it right here .
hold, hold this right here ?
yeah .
okay .
so, I'm starting, this says twelve here ?
um hum .
twelve, uh, what, twelve .
uh, twelve Nicoles .
twelve nicoles .
so I'm going to start here at the end of the table .
uh, with twelve, okay .
no we're, no you're, .
it's right here .
are they the same length ?
oh oh .
am I starting in the right place here ?
I'll fold this back .
okay, so why don't you set this up for me, .
then I'll do it .
right there ?
okay, let's try again .
alright, now I started at twelve .
well, it is right there, now right there .
right there ?
well, how would we do this ?
I didn't mark that spot .
is that an eighth or a fourth ?
you didn't mark that spot, huh, okay .
well, let's take a look .
how many, uh, about how many, uh, Nicole units is it ?
is this half ?
that's, no, it's probably six .
probably six ?
Where do you, why do you think it's six ?
because that's the mark of the six .
the six goes back .
so six, six is there .
yep .
yeah, ok .
how come it starts out at the twelve ?
what does that mean ?
uh, I started backwards, that's why .
I started from there instead of from there .
so does it make any difference, Nicole ?
not to me it don't .
well, how many are on the table ?
six, that's six and a fourth ?
six and a fourth ?
danny, Danny, why are you, .
are you starting this with the one ?
yes .
why, why, why are you starting with the one ?
so, what happens to this piece from 0 to one, .
if you start with the one ?
um, because, um, if I start from here, .
then I know that I can count one, two, three, four .
so, Okay, so, if you start here, how many up to two ?
how many up to two ?
how long is it ?
how many Danny units ?
one .
one, but you, but the number what you see, is two ?
yeah, because there's two of them .
yeah, but you're not counting this one .
because you started here .
because then there is one right here, .
and then when you go right here there's two of them .
yeah, but if you, do I see ?
I'll put it here .
so start measuring here .
Is this, uh, is this part of the bookshelve's length ?
no, no, so where should you start measuring ?
uh, yeah, cuz I'm confused .
right here .
oh, you started measuring here .
uh, and so, so if you count from here, .
this is one Danny unit ?
right, one Danny unit ?
but it says two here .
I don't understand .
because, then, because then there's two of them .
when you, when you're on one, then, um, then it, .
that's only one of Danny long .
and when there's two, there's two Dannys long .
yeah, okay .
so, right .
so right, when there's two, there's two Dannys long, I see .
but, but, but, but here, here's the, uh, here .
here's one Danny unit, right ?
this, this, this is one Danny unit, right ?
so, when you say this is two ?
this is two Danny units ?
is that from, from the bookshelf or is that from here ?
that's from the bookshelf .
that's two .
so, one, I just get one if I start here .
why is that ?
I'm confused .
because it says two .
But when I count it, I only get one, .
if I start from here .
because then it's two Dannys long !
is it two again ?
when you get to the two, that's when when, it's up here on the
alright .
where, is that the one ?
the one is right here .
that's a half ?
this is the beginning .
uh oh .
it's two .
it's two .
and an eighth .
well, let's start it on this side .
will I get the same answer .
as I did starting from that side ?
let's see .
there, and, .
let's see, .
so it's ten ?
two and one eighth .
and an eighth ?
because one, two, and then one eighth .
but it says ten .
it says ten, but that doesn't mean its ten inches, .
doesn't mean that it's ten inches long .
it means, that it's two .
two .
if you count it from here, because, .
one and two, and here, it would be one eighth .
do you think it would have been easy to measure .
with this measuring tape if two weeks ago, .
if two weeks ago before we had any of our talk .
about measurement or did any thinking together, .
if I just handed you this, .
and handed you all of these things to measure, .
would it have been easy to use this ?
no, yes .
why ?
because we already knew, .
we already knew how to measure .
but we didn't know how to explain it .
you think you all did already know how to measure ?
no .
so Justin, I would have given you this last week, um, .
and asked you to measure, .
you would have known what all those little lines were ?
I distinctly remember .
we didn't know what the lines were, but we know .
oh, but then how could you measure with that ?
remember yesterday when you said, .
+" I didn't know what those lines used to be .
+" I just thought they were there .
I know you would understand .
the six and the seven and the eight and the nine inches, .
but I see a lot of other lines on there, .
and they are not labeled .
would you have been able to .
get accurate measurements with this ?
no .
no, probably not, because you didn't understand it .
but I like that you brought up the point .
that we did know a lot about measuring .
that no one had ever asked us to talk about before .
but did we, were we all sure about how to measure ?
no, yeah, no .
not exactly, no .
we thought we knew what you had to do .
you just stick something up .
against the side of something else .
and you read the number and that is it .
but, we found, what did we find out ?
is there more to measuring than that ?
yes .
yeah, you have to do a lot of thinking .
when you measure, right ?
it's not as easy as it sounds .
how did making your own measuring tape, .
help you understand this measuring tape ?
what if, .
we had talked about measurement that whole day .
you know, I gave you a lot of time to talk and think .
and then I gave you this .
and I sent you around the room to measure things .
instead what I did, .
is I talked to you a whole lot about measurement, .
to get you started talking, .
and then I let you talk to each other, .
and it made you think about .
what it is you really knew about measuring .
then, I had you measure with something .
you had never heard of before .
it wasn't an inch .
it wasn't a foot .
it wasn't a yard .
and then, and it wasn't a centimeter .
and, I made you measure .
with a Sara, and a Justin, and a Paul .
and then I made you make your own measuring tape .
I could have just given you one .
do you wish I would have just given you one ?
no, yeah .
why did making your own, .
even if making your own measuring tape was hard, .
well, actually, .
most of you seemed to kind of enjoy that .
it made you think, .
but it was something different .
how did that help you ?
I want to know if that is what I should do .
next year with my second graders ?
who can give me a reason .
why it was good that I made you .
make your own measuring tapes before I gave you one .
that was already made ?
nicole, why was it good to make your own first ?
because it makes you think about the lines, and, nicole says it was
she knows about those lines .
what else did .
making your own measuring tape show you ?
brittany, what is one thing it showed you ?
it was like, sort of easier to, um, to like, get, .
it was like easier, because .
before you had to like line, line uh the, um, .
the, like your Brittanys up ?
and, um, this time, all you that had to do was .
put your sheet of paper on .
yup, and that was one thing I wanted you to know .
I didn't just want you to know that you could just .
make your own measuring tapes .
so you would learn about the lines on rulers, .
I wanted you to understand .
why people have things like .
rulers and measuring tapes and yardsticks .
and why it's easier to measure .
when your units of measure are all connected .
and all straight and none are overlapping .
and none are too big or too small .
remember we talked about that .
it was harder to measure your units .
when they were just loose .
and you had to lay them out .
this was okay .
I mean, it shows that, just what it should have showed .
that even though this was a wonderful way .
to talk about measurement, .
and sort out what you know and what you don't know, .
there was still a whole lot that a lot of them .
don't know, or don't get, or whatever .
I mean, they got a much better idea .
of what measurement is all about .
one thing that, .
this was the first time to use .
that standard unit of measurement .
even though they knew that, .
did you see all those heads nodding when I said .
+" do you know what these lines are ?
because that standard one divides it into inches, .
a half inch and a fourth inch, and so forth, .
but they don't label any of them .
I wanted them to go back to those things .
they had measured when their units were loose, .
when Brittany just had a handful of Brittanys .
and you had, .
but, since many of those things were long things, .
there were a mixture of long or small things .
that was really challenging .
for the first time that someone .
is holding you accountable for a measurement in inches .
I mean, the chalkboard tray whether you used .
a yardstick or a meter stick was really long .
it took adding up thirty nine and thirty nine or thirty six and
and then another thirty six, .
and then whatever you had hanging over it .
you know, that was too challenging numerically .
not measurement wise, I mean .
but they had the concept and that is what I looked at .
so I mean, .
if we had one hured ninety three and we were like twelve inches
and you had done that, but I saw you with a partner .
holding your place and moving it forward .
I mean that's all that really counted .
they hadn't used the standard measurement before this at all .
Not at all .
And I noticed you didn't really tell them .
how to do it when you started either .
no, what I wanted to see if, .
that was going to make sense .
because of what they had done before .
and that, and that was good .
yeah, I didn't want to spend a lot of time .
talking inches and centimeters today .
but, I wanted them to use their own and then say, .
okay, now that I thought about you make, .
how I make my things work, .
do I use the standard unit the same way .
do I line it up in the beginning ?
do I see how far it goes ?
do I account for parts that hang over .
that aren't quite there ?
and I think they got a lot more out of .
making their own that they know for sure now .
I mean, they lose sight of things from day to day .
you know, they forgot some things today, .
they said +"/.
+" You're right, I didn't really know everything about measuring .
but the day we got to one sixteenth, .
and then today, since this seemed easier, .
they're like +"/.
+" Oh yeah, we could have measured if you just gave us that .
and I'm like +"/.
+" Oh yeah, you thought you could of .
uh, so we'll come back to that and we'll refine .
those skills in some different, you know, contexts .
uh, using the standard stuff .
but today was fine, .
because everybody measured accurately .
at least some of those things on the list .
and everybody understood what they needed to do .
most kids seemed to be starting at zero .
but Danny in particular, start, kept starting at one .
and I kept asking her about that, .
and she, uh, and she, .
I couldn't really get her to say why .
she kept telling me one thing, .
then counting another .
uh yeah .
it was interesting, .
but I don't know what to think about that .
yeah, keep coming back to .
and then, every year, I always have kids who .
every measurement they take, .
sometimes weeks after we introduce measurement, .
is exactly one inch off .
they started at the one and go from there .
well, we talked about Saad, .
and that clicked instantly .
as soon as I said to him, .
+" Have you gone one Saad when you're here ?
he goes No .
you know, it made perfect sense .
and I don't think he'll make that mistake again .
but with Danny, .
I think we're going to be asking her that several times .
yeah, I tried, I tried that with Danny .
she wouldn't, she wouldn't come on .
I think they have to get a whole bunch of measuring .
things in there and link that information with .
how far it goes not just how big it is, you know .
they don't always think of measurement in that sense .
it's where it stops .
it doesn't mean where it's started and gone this far .
it's kind of, measuring is where it stops .
so if you're only thinking about measurement as .
where it stops, where it starts isn't as important .
I mean, you gotta, if you think about how far it's gone, .
then were it starts matters and you pay attention .
if you think about it as the space between, .
instead of just how high it goes
