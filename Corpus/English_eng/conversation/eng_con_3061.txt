cutting them in half and coming up with &-uh that different kind of
and then more complex designs they can . 4630_6270
and they each design the most intricate two by two design . 6320_9780
they can using those new shapes and a range of three colors . 9800_13580
and then they get in their groups .
and the group has to choose one two by two design from the three
and then they make a finished two by two quilt from that . 20440_24550
&-um two by two design nine of those two by twos . 24820_27260
&-um and go through that whole process as a group . 27830_29850
I mean they design their two by twos separately . 30080_32299
and they don't know who's in their group . 32320_33500
so it can't be just one person does beautiful .
and the other two just put anything down and say we're picking hers
they don't know who's gonna be in their group until &-um until
but we still have discussions about core squares and symmetry and
lots_of that stuff . 49550_50340
so I have to see if we're really done by tomorrow see how much time
and still make sure that that gets done in time for us to have
so it's kind of looking at the days I have left and what's going on
we'll start that quote project right away . 72650_74780
and we're what to do about days that are left at the end . 74820_77420
like . 77750_77870
oh okay . 77920_78270
we do have two whole . 78340_79660
days left for area and perimeter instead_of on the day of the
mhm . 86380_86600
&-um so we will . 86870_87920
I don't know if Monday will be when we start that . 88600_90080
but before next week is over they'll definitely be doing that . 90100_92760
and then I'm gonna try to squeeze the other assessment things and
and lot's more number . 98120_99800
this year's fell way behind on the number things they were supposed
but we're . 105160_105630
well what do you think is still . 106420_107410
&-uh is there some things that are still weak for these in terms of
they've had a lot that that's just been brought up they haven't had
but when they start designing those two by twos that's when we get
does that ensure that you're gonna have a symmetrical two by two
if you start with an asymmetrical course square . 128919_130880
can you end up with a symmetrical two by two design . 131160_133960
and we'll get back into symmetry by classifying their the new two
&-um so I've been doing some computer activities . 140910_142890
&-um so symmetry's just begun . 143480_145240
we haven't had any talks about area or perimeter as it relates to
we need to do that . 149460_150120
mhm and they need &-um a chance to tie together a_lot_of the ideas
and that a_lot_of that comes out during that &-um final quilt
well how do you decide . 167350_168170
it's a two by two . 168730_169360
you like what do you look for that whole idea . 169380_171650
again . 171700_171930
what is it that makes a good quilt . 171980_173520
&-um so we still have lots &-um lots to go . 173940_177690
but they've learned a lot . 178250_179710
they just need a chance to to tie it all together and to talk
so mhm so we'll see I'm not worried that we're not going to that
I'm just worried &-um juggle it all around . 190980_194010
so that they actually get the time they need for the things that we
so . 198020_198190
we'll see how do you think they're talking about the the &-uh
all of them in a much more &-um sophisticated way than they were .
I can't wait to see how to do those booklets . 210650_212910
that's one thing we need to find out from Kathy about that has to
or it won't show what they really learned . 217600_219360
if we wait until we come back January third or whatever it'll be
and it won't be that they never learned it . 223590_225110
so sometime we should that with the booklets where . 225220_228740
yeah . 228900_229080
the booklets . 229130_229520
to Catherine yeah that'll have to happen before the twenty first .
I was totally locked that . 232330_233420
out to a second version of that . 233490_235590
first she's gonna do the exact same thing again was my
okay to see so probably that last week . 239590_242070
so yeah that would be important to do .
like the last day . 243360_244270
I know that the Uni University comes as slated as what the
yeah Monday the nineteenth or twentieth I dunno . 251210_253600
wow nineteenth right . 254110_255440
yeah . 255680_255860
so and the twentieth is the all like the morning of the twentieth
but it'll almost have to be the twentieth in the morning or the
okay to get that in . 267970_268850
and &-um I know that got off track for a minute .
but I was like . 271180_271810
oh after all that work she went to and all that time she spent if
they'll be out_of the school mode . 279260_280850
and I think they've all come a long long way . 281040_283440
and I remember those days when you know like the one that threw
I think they're all just gonna write copy the core or leave it the
I mean they understand that now . 290860_291920
and that was the one they thought was the hardest . 292040_293770
uhhuh . 294190_294260
or the ones who just said . 294950_295760
turn left or some who said . 295780_297640
flip it now will say sideways flip diagonal flip or &-um up down
so I'm anxious to see those . 302750_303880
I think they really do understand those motions when they're asked
uhhuh . 308900_309000
and think about them . 309280_309910
and &-um and we have some different assessment things one that they
square one segment of it . 316500_318160
they get a two-sided courseware pre-made for them . 318180_320370
and then are asked to record what will happen to it after a series
and to copy now so they can actually use it and just transfer that
and then &-um some more challenging ones where the courseware is
and the grid is blank at the bottom . 332860_334090
and they have to visualize it . 334200_335400
they can't move it around . 335420_336320
it's attached to the page . 336370_337440
it's not two sided . 337460_338410
they have to do it in their head and record what it is . 338460_341580
and I'm &-um I'm thinking that this year this group should have <an
they seem to take to that really well . 349210_353130
but and again we'll see . 353650_354770
it it's how did it compare to last last year . 354850_357200
<last year> last year all children were able to do it with the
you know like out_of the four I think we asked them to do four
just those basics no three quarter turns . 373260_375060
but there was a right turn . 375150_376100
there was a left turn and one of each kind of flipped . 376120_378420
and with a two-sided core square . 378860_380220
nobody in the room missed more than one . 380610_382460
you know sometimes a kid turned left instead_of right . 382970_385380
or he turned a quarter instead_of a half . 385690_387630
but or you know the sideways flip they made an error drawing one
you could tell it was almost there . 393420_394660
and then they they mis recorded something . 394680_397540
so that was it proved that like the whole class understood what
&-um and then some &-uh I think there were five different tasks and
and that was &-um that was hard . 411760_415460
the the let's see were the turns easier than the flips to
&-um it all depended on the complexity of the design . 421770_423940
some kids got all of those right with looking at nothing . 424040_426230
and some kids got one or none . 426820_429180
and we're still at a point . 429660_430780
but I'd say average was you know most kids got you know at_least
and they're much more complicated than the ones in the geometry
I mean they weren't just one square . 444880_446510
and . 446680_446930
one black square and three white ones . 447320_448420
they were &-um triangles and smaller squares and lots_of different
some asymmetrical . 455550_456420
and we they were challenging . 456460_457820
and they handled them very easily . 457840_460500
so we'll see how that goes this year too compared to . 460700_463260
just I don't like you wanna go . 464190_465910
we have to rush . 466660_467230
no they're they'll be coming . 469060_470210
I don't even hear him in the hall yet but they'll be coming up . 470480_472400
because we were asking Nathan and what I've noticed . 472510_475390
and I'm sure you too . 475940_476870
&-uh that once he was he started to talk about hash . 477380_480510
he made the strip . 480730_481460
mhm . 481480_481650
and he started to talk about what he did to the core square . 481840_484260
and all of the sudden he switched from the previous to the next one
and we were trying to &-uh ask him what I mean to see that there .
I mean it was really difficult because he couldn't give us the
mhm because &-uh Teddy was working on them . 497950_500150
mhm . 500570_500790
but it seems like &-uh at_least him there is a &-uh a mixed math
I think with all of them are they all still need guidance in terms
and then you ask them what you do to the core <here here> here
where unless it's one where you know you pull that one aside . 530440_533620
and you actually have the core sitting right here . 533640_535180
and then they they make that connection . 535300_536940
but with that guidance they're all able to do it . 536980_539100
but you're right . 539120_539620
they're still to the point where . 539640_540900
&-um but that's how the pat . 541460_543350
that's how they're thinking about the pattern though . 543530_545140
that's how they recognize it as a pattern . 545160_546660
isn't always going back to this one and doing one thing . 546830_548580
the reason it's a pattern is because turn this on . 548600_550900
then you flipped it . 550920_551540
turn this on and you flipped it . 552340_553260
turn it . 553280_553590
that's that linking together . 553820_555540
yeah . 555630_555870
as long as they talk about it it's fine . 556140_557630
it's just &-uh I guess it's they are two different things . 557910_561500
one is what you do to the course . 561800_563150
one is the other one is . 563650_564820
what you did compared to this one . 564870_566350
yeah . 566400_566530
it seems to depend a little . 566820_567620
