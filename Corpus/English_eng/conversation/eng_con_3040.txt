so that is symmetrical ? 8738_10113
yeah . 10113_10821
mine is not . 10821_11313
is there &~n any other way you could fold that so they would match ?

and I tried this way +... 66793_72693
folding doesn't mean tearing guys . 72693_74690
you need those core squares still be careful . 74690_75978
who found one that is symmetrical ? 75978_79740
was there anyone else before we go any further ? 79740_81411
mines not &~s +... 81411_82040
yours is not but it +/. 82040_83528
&~m mine is not symmetrical . 83528_84616
right I was wondering first if we had anyone else who happened to
first I need &~t +//. 88306_89383
I need let's see can you pass that back to Ashley ? 89383_92816

well I go like this . 124620_125681
for sure it's not <symmetrical> . 125681_127843
<wrong way> . 127843_128713
its the wrong way . 128713_129671
well +/. 129671_129884

if one &~of if that one green one was red it would be . 173975_177806
if if . 177806_178836
um Brittany just said to me um as we were looking at some of
she just said to me I know what symmetrical is . 182470_184203
what is it Brittany ? 184203_185518
it's um when you like um try folding different ways and um . 185518_190013
like mine is not symmetrical . 190013_191698
because if +/. 191698_192916
because . 192916_194350
if &~th if um this one just green then it would be symmetrical but
so what would the bedspread have looked like if it was symmetrical ?
look like both of the houses would look the same . 202285_205983
both the houses would be the same ? 205983_208116
two covers that would be the &~s that would match . 208116_210485
that would be touching each other . 210485_212030
if you folded it or something . 212030_214561
it would hafta +/. 214561_215785
yeah like +/. 215785_215998
so why &~wha why weren't their um why wasn't the bedspread
because Maude and Amelia both made the house they grew up in . 218095_221116
they lived in the same house when they were growing up right ? 221116_223775
but they imagined <different ways of making the house> . 223775_227493
<different colors xxx different colors> . 227493_228848
<they looked the same to me> . 228848_229615
and their houses were different shapes and stuff . 229615_231293
&~th they imagined differently . 231293_234376
they were um making it from different xxx xxx . 234376_240825
okay . 240825_241558
so because they used different shapes and they used different
and they imagined different things around their houses and stuff
I need at least +/. 252280_253891
because one had peacocks . 253891_254725
one had the different shape of a garden . 254725_257480
one had a different shape of a chimney . 257480_260188
one had a different shape <xxx one> had different xxx <one had
<oh that's sweet> . 265680_266040
Sara . 266040_266718
great Nicole . 266718_270846

good job . 271680_272595
excellent . 272595_273540
Sara please sum up for the group the word we talked about and
xxx . 282078_283431
what's symmetrical ? 283431_283785
it means things if you fold it over um on both sides it will
okay so you test for &~sym um for whether something is
now when I picked up um Asratu's core square and told all of you it
+^ please sit down Amanda . 312170_314043
did you see me fold it ? 314043_315603
no you folded it in your mind . 315603_317618
I folded it in my mind . 317618_318788
okay yeah I did have to test though right ? 318788_322295
yeah . 322295_322845
I didn't know before I looked at his core square whether it was
Alex have you changed your thinking at all about the word
I remember the two scarecrows and I remember the two quilt designs .
well no but I have a I think I know how +/. 332393_336243
wait you haven't changed your mind about symmetrical ? 336243_338483
right but I think I know how to um folded mine . 338483_341916
show me please if you know how . 341916_344383
well xxx . 344383_347131
I think that you folded it like this . 347131_352446
and why do you think that's the way I folded it ? 352446_355275
because the blue triangle touches the blue triangle xxx . 355275_362123
and what does that mean if all of those shapes that are the same
it's symmetrical . 376883_378910
it's symmetrical . 378910_379876
hmm . 379876_380645
did you need two core squares exactly the same to show that that
0 . 384613_386443
you did ? 386443_387443
two core squares ? 387443_388810
I only see one Alex . 388810_390186
whoops . 390186_391105
did you need two ? 391105_392508
0 . 392508_393810
do you think a scarecrow could be symmetrical if there were only
no . 397791_398923
yeah it could . 398923_400540
0 . 400540_401476
if um like if you could fold it over like this . 401476_404556
I'm symmetrical . 404556_405891
so that um +/. 405891_407156
are you Nicole ? 407156_407973
yeah . 407973_408506
<um like the gloves matched> . 408506_411901
<but I can't xxx> . 411901_413836
the sleeves matched . 413836_415203
um the shirt um matched if &~i if you so that you could
um if and his legs would match too +/. 423383_428476
Alex do you think one scarecrow could be symmetrical ? 428476_431606
you think so ? 431606_433596
0 . 433596_434283
do you think most scarecrows are symmetrical or are not
no . 438758_439443
not . 439443_440115
what makes you think that Alex ? 440115_442176
well . 442176_443660
what it about most scarecrows that makes them so they're not
to me in different states they in different places they will
but if you're only looking at one at a time . 460106_461345
(be)cause we just said that one &~s scarecrow by itself could be
&~mwha &~d and you told me that you think though that most
0 . 471206_471971
if it has +/. 471971_472705
why not ? 472705_473238
what about (th)em makes it so their not symmetrical ? 473238_475711
I think I'll need some time to think . 475711_482940
I think that would be fine . 482940_484220
it is recess time . 484220_485513
