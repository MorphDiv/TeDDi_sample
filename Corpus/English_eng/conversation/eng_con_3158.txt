two . 1100_1160
if you turn it or flip it then you can get different two by twos .
you don't you turn . 8220_9980
just by turning . 10230_11190
<you can't get> you can't get all different two by two . 11420_14590
so . 15070_15150
you think maybe I can get some two by twos just by copying that
yeah . 19320_19540
because all you do with turning is turn it right . 19600_22230
turn it left . 22950_23690
turn it forecast . 24030_25000
turn it . 25720_26020
wow . 26690_26750
I can turn it lots_of different ways though . 27000_28710
right . 28990_29100
yeah . 29650_29780
but you could only turn it from the outside corners or something .
so but you what_if you flip it you'll get the same exact pattern or
it'll give you a different place to put it . 45770_48260
yeah . 48950_49020
but so . 49140_49700
it'll still be the same core square . 49720_50910
but it'll look different . 50980_51980
and you could get different like two . 52220_53900
designs from it . 53920_54270
'cause if you flip one of them . 55630_57940
and &-um if the red would well if you'll be the same exact four
okay . 80140_80360
and why . 80740_81160
and just refresh my memory . 81320_82440
why would it be important to get that foursquare in different
<to make> to make a different to their two . 86960_89930
then the rest then the first one or second one fourth fifth and
okay . 97450_97690
alright . 98200_98360
let's &-um think about flips and turns for a while . 98710_101160
then because that's what you're going to be doing . 101270_103610
Amanda I I need you to tuck your feet in . 104070_105780
thanks .
'cause I need to stand right where your feet were . 106850_107950
&-um . 108400_108470
hmm . 110220_110500
good ideas about flipping and turning . 110930_112440
that's what you're gonna be doing with the two-sided four squares
to make them to make different &-um families . 123820_127560
different families . 128889_129830
two by two . 131540_132080
let's see . 133100_133430
I don't know . 133530_133790
are we making a quilt . 133840_134710
family or are we making two by two designs . 134760_136620
two . 136660_136730
by two design qui both family and quilt . 136880_141720
two by two . 142700_142980
so you're gonna be doing two things today . 143570_144740
you're gonna be making two by two designs and a quilt family . 144900_147620
we're two two designs . 149720_151070
but they're gonna be they're going be all the same quilt . 155840_159370
well how will I know for sure that they're all in the same quilt
they're all . 164000_164550
using the same square I'll you need to do is for core squares to
you could do that . 174820_175660
you could do you could than two I guess . 175820_180390
more than it has to be more than two to be a quilt family . 181890_184090
well it more than one . 184690_186300
more than one . 187410_187990
one is not qui three . 188740_190470
but I . 191060_191340
one is not a quilt . 191580_192590
family but two is a quilt . 193510_194540
family . 194560_195080
no . 195100_195170
almost two . 195940_196670
could qui two two by two designs . 197780_200350
be in the same quilt family . 200550_201550
yes . 202100_202130
but you have a two &-um two course script . 202620_205980
you just have to repeat those over . 206570_208070
no you can't . 209180_210020
because the quilt family like me and Danny we're different . 210330_215010
you just got the same inside . 216030_218310
okay . 219500_219740
so you and your dad are in the same family even_though you're
so the two by two designs in a quilt family are different . 224140_227900
but something about you and your dad is <the same> the same
what's the same about the two by two designs in the quilt family .
four squares . 236990_237840
four squares in city . 240430_241510
okay . 242310_242550
&-um look at Sarah's core squares is the foursquare Sarah design .
and today she's gonna be using that one core square in lots_of
okay . 255270_255460
that's Sarah's core square . 255480_256620
I put one of her core squares up here . 257029_258860
that's her &-um original core square . 258880_261220
that's how she designed it to look . 261240_262870
then I did something to her core square . 263350_266020
<don't don't> don't say your ideas out loud . 266370_268480
so everyone has to think . 268580_269650
done . 269760_269930
okay . 270070_270160
and it looks like this Sarah is this still your core square . 270620_273740
yeah . 274210_274350
okay . 274720_274860
it's just a different one but don't . 274880_276390
oh don't tell me what I did to it . 276440_277820
don't tell me what I did to it yet . 278170_279620
anyway I went some think time . 279980_281150
and then that's exactly what I do want you to do . 281890_283710
raise your hand . 283810_284500
if you can tell me what I did to Sarah's core square to make it
what could I do to that . 291750_292870
first one that would make it look exactly like the second one . 293000_296730
Alex what would you do to this . 297270_299740
first one . 299760_300190
well I would turn it to the right . 300590_303020
&-um how much how how far to the right or how much to the right
should I turn it what turn right one fourth . 309620_315810
okay . 316420_316650
I'm gonna do exactly that . 316890_318330
I'm gonna take Sarah's courseware and turn right one fourth . 318540_321970
and I'm gonna show Alex what it looks like . 322660_324330
what do you think . 324900_325530
Alex oops . 325660_327970
whoops . 328770_329030
here . 329700_329770
let me slide this one closer . 330090_330950
'cause it's easier for me to hold . 331490_332530
&-um I'm gonna put it back the way it was . 333040_335180
okay . 335450_335650
Alex and then I'm gonna let you rethink the movement you want me to
this is Sarah's original position for her core square . 339340_342300
what can I do to it to make it . 342620_344020
look like the one next_to it . 344070_346320
Alex is taking a little more think time if you already know . 346560_348890
that's great . 348910_349330
but I want him to have a second try at manipulating the foursquare
what else would you try to get it to look like that . 355060_357300
second one . 357320_357830
turn left . 358790_359630
one fourth turn . 360860_362190
left one fourth . 362310_363180
turn left . 366010_367210
one fourth one more time . 367690_368650
so if Alex turned left a fourth and then turned left another fourth
how far to the left did he turn from Sarah's original horseback . 378840_382320
two fourths . 382840_383370
two halves a half half . 383800_385880
yeah . 386410_386560
two fourths row . 386880_387600
one half . 387640_387910
okay . 388580_388690
and that didn't get you what you wanted though did it . 388740_390480
Alex I'm gonna put it back to the starting position . 390500_392840
and let you rethink your move . 393170_394610
this is how Sarah's four square began . 395540_397600
what would you like to try to get it to look like that . 398890_403520
second one you tried three different turns or one turn . 403540_407720
and then another combination of turns . 407740_409430
I think Alex needs some time to save . 414230_416410
I think that would be good . 416830_417690
what could Alex try besides turning . 418360_421050
what could he try . 421740_422440
&-um Matu what would you try . 423050_424540
flip . 425060_425290
it flip up down down . 425370_428640
an up down flip . 429050_429760
it looks like it's the same thing . 431230_434130
would that work . 434630_435050
Alex let's watch that one more time . 435070_437130
I'm gonna put it . 437700_438170
&-um I just need to give a reminder . 438310_439770
some of you aren't sitting flat on your bottoms anymore . 439840_442020
and then some people have a real hard time seeing . 442600_444770
okay . 445740_445960
so here's it's in its original position . 446460_448220
imagine that up down clip . 449280_451140
and then watch that up down clip . 451450_453140
that did it . 455280_455830
right . 456140_456300
okay . 456760_456920
let me put that back in its original position . 457100_459120
how did I know I'm not Sarah and I didn't design this four square .
how did I know what Sarah's original position or her starting
yeah . 469610_469670
there's an ax in the upper left hand corner on the front side . 469720_473150
and that helps me know how she thinks it'll course . 473480_475550
even see that . 476350_476770
should not on the back 'cause the back is the flip side . 477050_479070
can't even see the Xis . 479360_480110
from here . 480480_480780
but I could when I was holding it and using it as a tool . 481060_483460
this is Teddy's course square . 483850_485830
okay . 486640_486820
in two different positions . 486940_488070
this is the way Teddy designed his core square to look . 488310_491430
but I did something to Teddy's core square to get it to look
Kevin just one second I wanted to write down the move that you guys
&-um Kevin can you tell me what to do to Teddy's four square . 508060_511580
we went . 511600_511800
up down . 512270_512630
and then turn it to the left . 513780_517980
okay . 521880_522020
like . 522190_522380
okay . 525640_525840
Kevin you want me to do an up down flip . 526180_528670
and then turn it to the right right two fourths . 529210_532760
okay . 533200_533440
I need to move it over where you can watch me . 535800_537950
this is still the beginning position . 538000_539340
I'm gonna do an up down flip . 539580_540980
and then I'm gonna turn it to the right two fourths . 542220_544570
it's oh it looks different different . 549510_553480
why should have left it where it was . 554680_556290
well where it was was right here . 556530_557740
is that a match . 558310_558850
we shoulda left it . 558900_559410
<wait wait wait> wait <let's let Kevin> let's let Kevin
&-um the first part of your move was an up down flip . 564640_567120
