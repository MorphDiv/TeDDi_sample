Here's what I would like to do today . 0_2610
I think of the seminar as providing something like eight meetings
That's strictly a retrospective reading done as a part of the
Now I've been doing such a reading of materials in hand and I am
Now think of it this way, at the end of that year's leave, because
So they said we'll give you a year's leave and attached to the end
So if you can imagine, I have something like eighteen months of
And during that time, I mean to be putting together that work in
I mean now to be writing these materials, making them available, if
I think of our eight meetings, then, as occasions to work into the
What I would like to do today is to provide you with a précis of
Now, since it's at best a long-winded argument, I would like to run
That is to say, I would like to give you a kind of a short order
For today's meeting, at least I'll consider that the primary
So then to summarize, I mean at the outset to make the materials we
Let me introduce, then, what I'll speak of as the claim . 402644_419485
I want to start with the claim .
The claim, in short-order fashion, can be put as follows: Since
I mean, you might hear it any damn way you like . 508900_533013
Except for one thing: for the time being, I'm really paying
That isn't meant to shut you out, that's meant only for the time
That's to say, its days on the West coast might as well come to an
The stuff in hand could only thrive by persons finding some way
Besides, it has now turned into a political beast, a something
And who needs it ? 600799_603151
I accept those who need jobs and those who have friends and
So it's about to go the way of established work . 611678_617614
And I'm convinced that as it does, then we'll get the codification
So allow me the use of “ethnomethodologists” as a kind of practical
It's a very time-limited corpus since it's worth anything it will
Now with that explanation, and the work that's been done since
the psychosis in the work, the abiding interest, the preoccupation
If those studies are taken, as I indicated before, as a result in
That's a frank shop-work technique; that's exactly and all that
It's worth quite slot in the work . 755131_756677
And when the reading is done that way, then that bibliography can
The name for the phenomenon is naturally-organized activities . 774249_777100
It's a slogan . 777100_778057
Don't try to interpret 'naturally', it'll get you nowhere . 778057_781630
I mean, sure it'll get you somewhere and I don't want to get into
So we've been coming to that discovery . 789270_792269
The claim is this . 792269_794864
The claim consists of announcing the discovery of a phenomenon that
Now there exists a corpus that's part of the claim, that
But no, I don't want to provide for it as a literature, I want to
And I want to provide about that corpus, that there is such a thing
Now then, if you would in your notes, alongside of that claim,
That's the thing, by way of announcement, that I'm now obligated to
Having announced the claim, I now want to provide, in the following
That's to say, they compose the argument in the steps of it and
That is, as I see, the desideratum . 954525_959694
This manual, is this a manual of methods, how-to-do, or is it a
Yeah, it's a how-to-do . 976236_990582
I hear your question as a between one or the other, I really don't
But for the time being, hold off . 1043196_1045859
Okay, here are the steps . 1045859_1050913
The précis, if there's a précis, I mean it will give you the sense
I'm going to first specify what the discovery consists of by
In that it provides that there is something characterizable,
I'm going to speak of that thing that's not found in those studies,
Now, another way to speak of that is to speak of it as a missed
Missed ?
I don't want to say overlooked, it's not overlooked, it's missed . 1143294_1150560
It's not that it's ever been known better, it's that you will hear
it's not that it dis-attends the missed orderliness, it's that that
That's what we're talking about . 1198106_1200515
So we're not substantively looking for marbles that got dropped,
Nor are we talking about footnote to the corpus of conventional or
We're not talking about adding bright ideas to an otherwise bright
We're not talking about introducing “variables” that would serve
We're not talking about the thing that has been missing all along
So the thing missed, then, is instead completely missed and it's
By essentially, I mean the very practices whereby the thing missed
Every such remedial effort will preserve in specifics and in detail
So the completely and essentially is a serious completely and
It's a constituent feature of those practices, along with other
Now what we want to do with that missed orderliness is to take to
We want to turn it into issues . 1412909_1414754
That is to say, our task here, my task in the teaching, the
I'm going to speak of such phenomena as issues, I'm borrowing that
That is, you speak of an issue and mean by that it's a phenomenon
And you're not at all adverse to saying that in that it calls for
Whatever, the problem now is to take the missed orderliness and
Monday, I characterized the characteristic career of these various
Now I want to get further into that, I want to get further into
One way in which that topicalization can happen, a source no,
Candidate phenomena are pretty much what they sound like, they're
That is to say, further examination with respect to the great issue
What is it for them to be in situ productions ? 1608113_1612800
We're looking in effect for structures of ordinary practices .
We're looking for the structures of real world activites as in situ
We're looking for the structures of worldy activities as worldy
We're looking for the production of the real world of ordinary
Okay, so one thing is these case materials .
Now what about the case materials ? 1664835_1672078
You're going to find they're going to be roughly of two sorts, at
The whole collection of these things that come from God knows
I'll give you an example .
Dave Sudnow speaks of the Howard Becker Phenomenon in the study of
The Howard Becker Phenomenon if there are persons in here who
And those in fact who are into inquiries know that there are places
Now, in that sense, that there could be in fact that about our
Now, there are sources of candidate phenomena, there is a source of
Sudnow, in speaking about the Becker Phenomenon points out about
What we can't read and no interrogation of his work will yield
Not in principle, not in compliance with the rules, they're not
They're instead, in each others' company then and there making
Now, if you go looking, then, for the descriptive studies of
It's a specifically absent literature . 1898906_1911341
You can get endless appreciative accounts of musicians' work . 1911341_1915813
These are peculiar kinds of renderings of musicians' work . 1915813_1921284
No interrogation of those renderings, no interrogation of, I'll
So it's very peculiar, we have a vast literature on something
You can't find that, and now the question can arise, well if Sudnow
An issue, then, would be the candidate absence of a descriptive
That's the issue . 2037006_2039599
What would that look like ?
You're not talking about the music .
you're talking about their
Yes, no, we're talking about the production of musical sounds, yes .
And not any musical sounds, we're talking about the production of .
since Dave is into heavily the prdouction of improvised, the sounds
And they're not it's not that we'll assign them to the
But I don't want to get into that because when I to my précis, then
And I'll take up that issue . 2111534_2115200
Do you have in mind what the hell's happening to subjectivity ? 2115200_2118050
No ? 2118050_2119330
Well, if anything awful is happening to subjectivity, it deserves
But I mean only for the time being let's say as if I'm laying
What you just described is a reasoned conjecture that such a
I'm saying it's as a reasoned conjecture that you find the absence
In any case, one source of the issues will be reasoned conjecture .
There's another source of these issues that we're going to be
That's not altogether a play on words . 2180607_2187190
In that fifteen-year accumulation, stuff has been provided for in
In that literature, in that fifteen-year accumulation, candidate
Cicourel's writings are very rich with the suggested presence or
Persons say this and that you would have heard and written down . 2300485_2305224
He takes these, offers them together with a story-like provision of
Egon Bittner's early work provides for the possibly missed
If you want to know what ethnographic reports can really look like,
It still catches people in what John O'Neill and Ken Morrison speak
She comes on in that story with such credibility, via what can be
And of this it's made of that work, that it was done by her talking
And so on . 2413001_2415660
Okay, that's another case of a source of that missing what, in the
There are other sources of documented there are other ways of
They can be provided for as you'll find for example in that study
like, now if you'll read the essay, you'll for find it for
Now those items nevertheless can have the character of documented
They provide for issues, but they're not characteristically
They can provide for them, for example, via captioned photos, a
About this process of captioning +... 2617297_2620140
Now, what the students have time and wit to do in the time that's
By captioning, they're writing little characterizing phrases to
You see, then, how in the still it's to be read and to be examined
Rendered via the still . 2673953_2676332
In that it's a rendering, a rendition, issues of structure are
So that's a way to work . 2693453_2696944
Harrison White frequently says, look, where the enterprises of
That doesn't mean you can make it up, unless you need to make it
Then you make it up . 2704692_2714583
But you don't lose sight of the fact that something made up is
And where inquiries are concerned, if you're not making it up
You're not properly doing it . 2722147_2729562
You won't recognize it being done .
You'll feel brain injuryed, if you're not into making it up . 2729562_2737044
But now I'm talking, you know, in pronouncement, and that won't do .
The fact is though that there are the use of these documented
I'm just characterizing; when I go back I'll take it up with the
Now there's a third source of the missing what, it consists of what
And I said that the work of the conversational analysts', in bulk,
Now the source that we're talking about, the source for those
They have in common, these organizational items, a collection of
Social facticities you can hear it temporarily as an
They're not the social facts, they're the social facts with
That fundamental principle was to be understood, was to be
That the ordinary society in its orderliness, as an ongoing, in
That would be the paraphrase . 2977996_2980756
There's a collection, then, of properties that we'll call the
A second thing: these social facticities, what you might think of
You might think think of it another way: in the work that analytic
Those now are found . 3072690_3076829
those practical devices whereby, for the lived orderliness, they
They are not restricted in any way to the work of the members of
Those practical devices whereby the orderliness of ordinary action

that ethnomethodological model that in the way in which the
So it's itself in the way a part of a system of practical reasoning
Now the Mooresian catalogue is a system for showing that and how
The missing what consists of that system . 3664636_3675258
The stuff that I've been working on for many years, dealing with
Those are examples .
There are about a half dozen in the ethno literature . 3703387_3710785
Now, points to be made about that stuff: Of the systems that are
Since those identifying properties are in situ productions, since
So that if you can't get access to the practices of a system,
Which is to say you'll render the structures . 3781155_3791312
Where the idea of practical reasoning is concerned, if we have a
And if they're not available to us, then neither are the structures
Now the big property that I want to be discussing in the time that
These systems have the features that they're discovered topics . 3834885_3854951
The missing what consists of the Mooresian catalogue as a
The missed orderliness consists of the turn-taking organization of
I'll specify what that discovered topic consists of, in the
In any case, these properties are then going to be used, because of
The only way to get access then to what “naturally” could be would
Now then, the systems of naturally-organized activities are studies
That's the force of xxx . 3974032_3977523
Now a final part of the argument: thinking of the foregoing sources
You can also think of the maxims as outrageous claims .
I don't even have to tell you they're outrageous claims, you'll
But, you want to understand for the claims, that these claims are
They provide the grounds for talking like this . 4043671_4047411
Also, these maxims are very peculiar kinds of proposals, I think of
You can only come into the presence of the poem by reciting the
The lines don't describe the poem, in being spoken, they bring you
Speaking the poem is the poem . 4066530_4081226
And these maxims, then, for the work of ethnomethodological
Another way, and a simple way to think of it is you might as well
But if you don't take them up there's not a chance, and that is a
Okay, what's the first maxim ? 4132345_4136253
Well the first maxim was given to me by Harvey . 4136253_4139012
The first maxim goes: organizations of ordinary activities that are
They provide for the organization of ordinary activities with the
That's a maxim .
That's a work procedure . 4212160_4217280
It's also an achievement it's not that we're saying that to
The second maxim is that lay and professional theories of
They mis-conceive, without hope of repair, the phenomenon of
would you repeat that please ?
Lay and professional theories areessentially mis-conceived with
The third maxim is that lay and professional theories miss the
They also miss as natural phenomena that they're included . 4274168_4281400
And the way they miss as natural phenomena is that they're included
And they don't miss the phenomenon of organization in any which way
would you repeat that last part ?
They miss it .
Here's that orderliness, lay and professional theories miss it .
They don't miss it any which way, but they miss it via the
It's in the reading and writing that the missing of it occurs, and
Among these are the following: structures, as these are understood
Let me pin it down . 4380100_4396241
I know the practices in some parts of analytic sociology, so we'll
Second, another device consists of let me just refer to them in
Another device consists of the use of theories of social
Another device we'll find consists of the various uses of social

handing out guarantees .
I'm not a banker, with respect to my own affairs or sociology's
I wish I could be a banker about my own affairs I could look
Instead, it's a horror . 5014271_5018243
Sure, it's very easy why, I mean I can tell you why because
And some of them in fact want to see a pacific ocean for the first
And anyone that's really tough figures he'll have it for himself . 5051243_5058558
And that makes it very wearing on me, because they can barely wait
It's true, the most recent thing is called “the moral enterprise of

Now, can we start again and pick up your comments, xxx complaints,
xxx what you have to say about ethnomethodology and phenomenology
Could you say more are you talking about the rationalization of
some Jockeying . 5562794_5573782
I'm a gloomy fellow, and I don't trust my descendants, any more
And it could be that I'm telling a dolorous tale, that
Nevertheless, here's what I see . 5630837_5643487
If our work I'm talking now about the study of
Now my convictions are that if with respect to those when I
as these
It's not that they provide for the foundations of extant sciences,
I'll tell you what I'm talking about . 5744431_5748171
The logical properties of occasioned maps is nothing that interests
To get into an analytic cartographer it's not necessary to finally
So you sketch it and that's enough . 5778511_5790252
And that's what they'll do with those maps . 5790252_5792791
They'll also do things like compare these maps with the
Their features are thereby made elucidable, and their features are
You can get that kind of stuff . 5822633_5824577
The idea that there are logical properties that the occasioned
Now that it would have logical properties is not incorporatable
It's not an addendum to the corpus of cartography, it establishes
When you come to find things about maps, you come to find as well
That's not a trick, it turns out that the complaints about maps
In that, thereby what the complaint and the complainable could
Well, if you find that for maps, you find that's a very peculiar
That indeed they also exhibit this lovely defeating characteristic,
And not anyplace, but they always do it clearly, delicately, and
but these mistakes are relativized to the kind of thing that the
The issue is, well, how does a complainable arise via the
Now we're talking about the work of reading instructions with
It's not that we're taking an aspect of the work, or taking an
Just the way Sacks is talking about producing heard-greetings
The so and the what . 6039946_6043770
In that case, then, what these maps do is to establish that
I ought not to talk as if they establish a science, I ought to say
how's that ? 6051833_6072214
In fact I think I even prefer that rhetoric, because at least it
I mean, I really love my wife who's an analytic chemist, she's a
I am now beginning to dream of my lost youth I figure, well
I mean no one in his right mind would want to do it in sociology,
Just imagine, you take one long weekend and you learn the arts of
A handful of shibboleths, a way of putting them on the board, so
You mask the fact that you have such a device and you can go and
You start with the easiest .
You start with the topic-headings in the textbooks . 6153925_6160259
But then you can get accomplished, like introducing variations, you
So, what I want to say is that a device would be a handful of
And they would become what Melinda Baccus speaks of as an
See, when you lay out in your discourse, your confidence with
A definition as an ethnographic detailing device permits you,
So indeed it provides you a way of keeping the talk going, of
Well, look, you want to take a long weekend and read some theory,
Read a little bit of the stuff, try it out with friends, and you're
Now what the hell are you going to with thirty years ?
I mean what the devil are you going to do, teach ? 6280286_6287999
You'll die by the time you're thirty .
I mean you'd turn into a style-of-lifer, you'd be working merely .
Where do you want to live ? 6287999_6297925
I'm not kidding on that , I mean I really think sociology is for
I'm talking nov about the possibility of taking seriously the
In any case that's too much opinion . 6303360_6339369
Harold, I was interested in that business about captioning xxx
You can do an exercise for yourself, in fact I'd appreciate it if
There's a phenomenon that Howie Schwartz picked up when he was in
Woosh ? 6382239_6392460
Whoosh, yeah . 6392460_6393331
That's the caption to begin with . 6393331_6396257
That's the topic . 6396257_6398137
You're going to go around the city looking for whoosh . 6398137_6400247
Whoosh is a street corner where, in the downtown area, when the
Then the lights turn green, “walk”, and whoosh . 6413431_6417853
As they come together, and they get through these crowds . 6417853_6425150
I mean they simply make it to the other side and if you'll examine
Well, not never, that's too strong, right ? 6437720_6442300
But if you see a collision, it's a specifically noticeable event . 6442300_6447246
You'll go home saying “you know what, I saw a collision at whoosh
It's like you're walking down the street, you look up and see “my
and you say oh yeah, I forgot, I saw it .
You saw it ?
that would be a specific noticeable, having seen it, the seeing
Now whoosh, with collisions in them, are noticeables . 6500659_6511448
Now what you want to do is stand there with a camera and at
If you can get up on top of the thing even better . 6511448_6534500
Now the captioning consists in this: what you're going to be doing
You're going to be doing it via captioning procedures . 6541189_6544265
The captioning means this: you're going to say that there's a stage
There's another stage: “approaching” . 6553774_6559061
Another stage: “pre-merging” . 6559061_6563100
Another stage: “merging” . 6563100_6564846
Another stage: “separating” . 6564846_6567023
Another stage: “separated” . 6567023_6570348
Another stage: “stragglers” . 6570348_6572311
Now I know what I'm talking about because there are students who do
The big thing that's nice about captioning is that whatever you say
And it will remain indifferent entirely to what that work has to
So it's all very well that you can say that they're accumulating on
What you'll find that you're doing, however, is using the caption
If, however, you want to do conventional analysis, then you could
In that case, you might have the notion then that the events of it
But holy christ, suppose the phenomenon isn't that, that persons
Then in that case, the time line and that captioning procedure
It's what it is for you, as the observer .
It may not be what it is for those who are crossing the street . 6782825_6800929
Yeah, in a way .
You wouldn't believe it that way, though . 6800929_6814262
If you do that, and you take it and show it to a few kids as some
one guy's working on this thing, he's making this elaborate thing
And he says “do you recognize it” ?
and she's really pleased, “of course”, and she's instructed and she
So it's not really so that the big point of the thing that's
And you're providing as well that the issue of how those structures
So, for example, here's that clock time and the events are stuck on
You might say now, “see, we've located a parameter of the action” .
That's all very well, except that the accountable character of the
In which case then, you'd have to feel some mild discontent . 6927807_6943168
You've made a great, lucid, even professionally-speaking a kosher
The thing you're looking for is the street crossing “really” . 6961372_6964214
You're looking for the account of the street crossing with no and
The features that we have have to do with street crossing, if they
The analytic sociologists' stock in trade or brag is, when he
That's a very peculiar kind of fact, right ? 7005026_7008851
It's the facticity of the street crossing that you can have access
Sociological facts of organizational life are characteristically
Sociologists write off their marks and in fact they're embarrassed
They absolutely prefer to the looks of things, talk of thing . 7080054_7086259
And the very first thing they'll do in fact is to get these things
But then that's being too fussy . 7101481_7105704
We're just talking about the big issue which is whether, for the
Concreteness, by the way, has a really lovely, problematic status
He doesn't mean the looks of things, he seems to mean at least
It's as if, in the definiteness of a procedure, the assurance that
Now that's a conjecture of Baccus . 7188543_7194545
She thinks in fact that the last thing in the world that
They simply are going to get impatient with any proposal that
She's been into the survey thing and she finds there that, when she
And she encounters what she calls the “not here, not now”
The not here not now phenomenon is this: the structure will allow,
Now if you imagine that anytime you have a procedure of this sort
You raise that as a question and your instructor will then have to
Again, it's not that he's dumb, it's that he's not interested, it's
So what do you think then the issue of observation could look like,
They all like it to resound in claims this happens but
I once was on a committee to make a comprehensive exam for the
I can have anything I want as long as I ask for nothing . 7357414_7361886
So, but once in a while, I've been on three committees, since
And so I thought, well, we'll get a film and we'll show the film,
And I persuaded the other members of my committee, we even got a

Now, if that's an issue, the thing about the Agnes account is that

Everybody says no, not everybody, brain researchers don't any
They're instead split over this issue with a lot of people having a
There's a part of Lynch's procedure, which is beyond me

I have a paper by a student of mine, who's also named Lynch, no

He asked Lynch, is it going to happen in the next month or so, I
Lynch, now, was saying this in the course of an oral exam in

They have a staining technique that's a part of the lab procedure

In order for you even to get into an enterprise where that would be
That staining technique separates those that think Lynch is on to
Which is to say, if you believe that the staining technique works
And in fact if you're not in Lynch's lab, but in another lab,
If you're not in Lynch's lab, and you don't believe it, you're not
You're not a rival because you're not into a research enterprise
Now what Lynch says is: the truth of it is specifically in dispute .
He says he couldn't care less whether it's true or not . 9346724_9352060
We have to care at this point that, given the results it gives us
