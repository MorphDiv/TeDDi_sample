what did you hear about the different ways hurricanes can be destructive ? 127705_134105

I think this is what S_six said, that they can move slowly and they get more deadlier, I think . 153525_159965
S_one ?
the heavy rain can cause floods to flood into houses . 163225_169585
and yeah . 171665_171905
are there some new friends that haven't shared ? 173165_175205
S_fourteen .
I think it was Hurricane Hugo that costed over a billion dollars for just that one city . 176365_186585
okay S_one, can you repeat what you said ? 187785_189205
when it +... 189705_191885
hard rain can cause floods, it will flood into houses . 192385_195765

to add on to what S_one said +... 214545_220225
hurricanes can cause floods . 221985_226245
and I have a question . 227205_229325
can hurricanes cause earthquakes ? 229445_230925
that might be a post-it note question where we come back to that . 232835_236355
we might have to do a little more research . 236575_238115
S_fifteen ?
I want to add on to S_one and S_fourteen . 239295_242055
hurricanes can cost a lot of money and they cause a lot of deaths and floods . 242315_247775
S_two ?
some people can actually die in deadly floods . 249235_256115
S_three, did you hear what S_two had to say ? 257555_259475
no, not really . 259635_260575
remember, we have to be responsible for our own learning . 261605_263485
so when you don't hear what another friend says, how can you ask them ? 263705_266785
S_two, can you say that again ? 267165_268305
people can die in bad floods . 269645_274765
S_three, did you hear what S_two had to say ? 275465_277705
no . 277925_278165
S_three, you are responsible for understanding what your classmates are saying . 278865_282845
what can you ask S_two to help you understand ? 282945_286425
S_two, can you say that again ? 286925_288165
that floods can +... 290385_291185
can you turn to the group ? 291525_292645
that floods can make people die . 294245_297385
better ? 297665_299905
S_sixteen .
that toys outside +... 300725_303385
I think sometimes can be missiles to hurricanes because it's hit up in the air . 303785_309005
S_fifteen, did you understand what S_sixteen was trying to say ? 309345_312405
no, I did not . 312725_313385
S_sixteen, could you repeat that ? 313725_314685
yes . 314845_315085
that toys outside can be missiles to hurricanes . 319395_321795
I'm going to go back to I think what S_sixteen's trying to talk about, and I'm going to find it in our reading . 324675_333815
hurricanes are like missiles ?
xxx .
toys outside .
yeah, so right back here in our story, is this what you're talking about, S_sixteen ? 334075_344115
+" hurricane force winds rip pieces off roofs, tear the siding off houses and carry off toys, building materials, and other items left outside . 344035_353775
these become missiles during a hurricane, dangerous to people as well as property . 354295_359595
also, it was toys . 359775_360195
was that what you were referring to, S_sixteen ? 360195_361915
yes . 361915_361935
S_fifteen, did you have something to add ? 362375_365275
no, I was just confused because I didn't hear what he said, but now I know what he said now . 365495_368975
so when we reread it, does it make a little more sense ? 369215_371715
yeah . 371855_372735
it makes a lot more sense .
S_five, what can you add on to S_sixteen's ? 373145_376945
I can add onto S_two's, but that people said that more than one thousand people have died in a flood . 377405_387805
S_fourteen ?
I want to add on to my thing about what floods can do and hurricanes . 388705_394305
that also when it's a sloped area, it can cause landslides and mudslides . 394955_402155
so you're walking and you could slip really easily and probably break something . 402435_406695
did anyone have anything else to share for class discussion ? 407395_411395
S_twelve ?
to add onto what S_fourteen and S_sixteen said, if a hurricane hits a town it's very easy to get hurt . 415545_424145
you probably want to stay in New York, they have underground areas +... 424545_430805
subways . 431265_431625
underground basements, which are safe from hurricanes because hurricanes cannot go that deep sometimes . 432505_438785
and to be prepared for a hurricane, you should probably clean off your yard . 441625_446665
make sure there's nothing that can fly up into the sky or something . 448145_452425
so our +... 453605_453885
clean everything down . 454005_454625
yeah, our discussion did a great job . 454925_456625
you guys were recognizing effects that hurricanes have on human life and the natural world . 457025_462565
recognizing causes and effects really helps readers better understand what they are reading . 463345_469085
tomorrow, we're going to continue to think about what you are learning from Hurricanes . 470765_475325
now we're going to talk about group brainstorming . 477465_481305
