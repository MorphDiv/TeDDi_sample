okay okay ? 0_6770
all right . 6770_8052
bye bye . 8052_8489
okay . 8489_10569
so with this stupid class . 10569_13458
it is not fair . 13458_15111
so what gets moved to ten ? 15111_16718
⌈I don't get it⌉ . 16718_17090
⌊okay⌋ . 17090_17461
if we take . 17461_18659
you understand the fact that they're kicking us out of this ten o'clock section . 18659_22624
right, but what are they moving to ten ? 22624_24232
wait . 24232_24598
so the class is at one o'clock . 24598_26544
if they move ⁎our⁎ math class to ten . 26544_28773
which would be ten to twelve . 28773_29888
we would have an hour for lunch ? 29888_31291
which one's the math class ? 31291_32655
⌈the one the math class⌉ . 32655_33148
⌊eight o'clock⌋ ? 33148_33331
eight o'clock . 33331_34429
yeah . 34429_34717
that's what it is . 34717_35643
sorry . 35643_35915
if we move that eight o'clock to ten then we don't have an hour break . 35915_40950
which would be for lunch . 40950_41859
and we'd be in class just the five hour time . 41859_44915
and that'd be better . 44915_45491
it's ridiculous having I'm sorry but as long as it's only a select group of people in this one math class . 45491_53832
it affects no other students . 53832_55439
they're not going to move it though . 55439_57751
they might . 57751_59775
if we bitch enough they might . 59775_61178
seriously, because it's only the people that are really in ⁎our⁎ class . 61178_65719
yeah, but I don't think they're gonna change a class just because the students don't like it . 65719_70837
but it's still not fair that they are kicking us out of our class . 70837_74924
oh well no, but +/. 74924_76410

and David checked on Monday and they weren't available and they weren't ready . 143615_148445
so he they went this morning . 148445_149643
and it's just the same . 149643_151417
David is like +"/. 151417_152160

mhm . 155215_155875
and it's not fair . 155875_158809
and you can't get the ten . 158809_159757
and they they ⁎had⁎ the ten o'clock section . 159757_162070
David and Ross had the ten o'clock ? 162070_165042
yeah . 165042_165208
and the Chi Dev professor's calling them telling them that they had to be switched to the other <section> because of the English and History . 165208_173216
and there are more than twenty five English and History . 173216_175173
So what are they gonna do with them ? 175173_176438
give put Ross and David in the one o_clock class . 176438_179493
but xxx saying that there are more than twenty five ⌈students⌉ in English and History . 179493_182548
⌊yeah, I know⌋ . 182548_183291
there might be more than twenty five in History and English . 183291_186802
and therefore we cannot do this . 186802_188410
and I'm like +"/. 188410_189524
+" this class is required . 189524_190722
we're told by our major colleges to ⁎wait ⁎to take excuse me this stupid class and to wait before we students teach . 190722_198152
because it's a perfect time . 198152_199555
it's a six weeks class, it's perfect . 199555_201124
not only that . 201124_203066
the class goes till March ninth and we're supposed to be student teaching February twenty sixth I mean something is wrong . 203066_209875
⁎and⁎ I can't get my student teaching permit . 209875_213301
because the department hasn't approved it yet . 213301_214704
so my class schedule is just gonna be full . 214704_217184
like these bullshit hundred level classes . 217184_219003
just to have credit hours . 219003_220915
so that my financial aid doesn't get cancelled until I get my student teaching figured out . 220915_226183
how many credit hours is student teaching ? 226183_230742
xxx it can be up to twelve . 230742_232582
how many is yours ? 232582_233658
zip right now . 233658_235061
no but I mean ⌈nobody⌉ +/. 235061_236054
⌊seven⌋ . 236054_236176
+, it will be seven . 236176_237290
but mine will be ten . 237290_239769
because I'm gonna ask for three extra credit hours um so that I have extra hours . 239769_248314
I only need one +/. 248314_248973
+, yeah . 248973_249345
but why do you think you're gonna get it ? 249345_250559
oh because they have a class built in that will make it up to five extra credit hours that will make it up to twelve ⌈credit⌉ hours . 250559_258467
⌊oh⌋ . 258467_259004
for people that don't have to any classes to take and just have to student teach . 259004_264288
so that they are like full time students . 264288_265774
so that they can get financial aid . 265774_266906
yeah . 266906_267260
they have it so they you can get like the health insurance . 267260_269861
you can live in the residence house . 269861_271514
all that kind of stuff . 271514_272916
they have it built in . 272916_274115
so that student teaching is worth seven but if you need extra it can be worth xxx . 274115_279992
okay . 279992_281917
It's another class . 281917_282947
they just call it xxx . 282947_284805
so it's really nice of them . 284805_287034
I mean seriously . 287034_288027
cause otherwise I would have to pick another screwy gym class this semester . 288027_290999
&=laugh . 290999_292957
because what they're doing is they are offsetting the fact that you can't take any other classes when you student teach . 292957_299256
cause you can't . 299256_301114
I mean if I was student teaching like in Yorkville and the class didn't get out till four school didn't get out till four . 301114_307224
I'd have to stay to four thirty or whatever . 307224_308999
you wouldn't get back here any dinner until in time for the night class, really . 308999_313374
and there is such a limited number of classes offered at night ? 313374_317089
yeah . 317089_319030
you know that are not necessarily be the classes you needed . 319030_322002
you know what I have done with my schedule ? 322002_324148
my earliest class is at two on like Tuesday Thursday . 324148_329804
uhuh . 329804_330258

forty four . 349085_349578
three thirty . 349578_349628
three thirty to four forty four and then I have to rush back here, eat dinner and then rush to my six o'clock . 349628_354862
um . 354862_357008
that's not that much of a rush though . 357008_359237
you have an ho:ur . 359237_359942
no no but I don't like I don't like doing that . 359942_362831
I had enough with that this year . 362831_364688
uhhuh . 364688_365310
so then ? 365310_365969
I know I hate dinners . 365969_368010
and Tuesday Thursday my classes are from two to four thirty . 368010_370777
two to four thirty okay . 370777_372718
Tuesday Thursday . 372718_373833
that's it . 373833_374659
and then Wednesday . 374659_376062
one class that's from two to four thirty ? 376062_376926
yeah . 376926_377753

Wednesday and Friday . 387579_390196

are you sure ? 392425_393623
I'm positive . 393623_395192
because three thirty to four forty four is an hour fifteen . 395192_398741
yeah . 398741_399112
but you're talking honors courses here . 399112_400849

hold on . 404768_405966
who the hell knows about honors courses ? 405966_407619
I might have a two point five GPA . 407619_409309
that ain't even if you reversed the numbers it still wouldn't be honors . 409309_413850
even on a six point scale . 413850_415132
