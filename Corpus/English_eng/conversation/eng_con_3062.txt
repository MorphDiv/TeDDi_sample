little bit on on what &-uh pattern they had . 0_3260
mhm . 3280_3540
like for instance &-uh Nicole and Danielle had mhm had &-um a
and there was a copy core again . 16140_17350
so they were able to kind of say . 17710_18940
oh this is a copy core turn right . 19120_21020
so it really didn't make any difference . 21260_22710
whether they were referring to previous or not . 23110_25100
mhm and somehow I got the the idea that they really did think
mhm &-um but with with Nathan's and Teddy's there wasn't that
it's just because yeah . 39790_40630
and Nathan's actually the one who was able to do more talking and
but I think that's it too . 45460_46990
he's doing that . 47270_48260
and some of them it's harder because they didn't really make that
some of (th)em just pushed six together . 52920_54030
and you can tell 'cause there is no pattern anywhere in their
and the ones who actually arrived at a pattern . 57410_58800
once they knew what you were asking them could get there . 58990_61420
like by the end Kelly those last two she didn't have to move around
she just goes . 63920_64260
oh this is a copy core . 64280_65140
and this is turn left a quarter . 65160_66220
but those first four we had to go each through each one even the
and then she's like . 72640_73140
oh that was just a copy of the core . 73320_75020
and this one was . 75760_76500
but then those last two funds goes . 78490_79500
oh and this is copy core . 79520_80380
and this is turned left or quarter . 80400_81340
she was able to pick out . 81490_82380
I did have a pattern here . 82520_83620
I'm checking . 83900_84180
yep . 84300_84500
I followed the same pattern . 84560_85500
that's what it was . 85540_86220
right . 86250_86550
they . 86710_89540
can certainly recognize it . 86780_88420
reason about it after it . 88530_89530
but I think it was some of the kids . 89900_91350
yeah actually had a plan as they made that strip they did something
and some just arranged six . 95940_97580
and that was a strip . 97860_98860
&-um so it's easier for them to think about what they did in terms
if they actually use that beginning core square to create some kind
and I just stuck them together . 112740_113500
yep . 113580_113730
yep . 113860_113980
yep . 114030_114180
and colored that on graph paper . 114360_115620
so I think they're still at that point when they're forced to they
but they do lose track of that when they're designing . 122070_124310
and when they're doing something that becomes a hole then and it's
you know once it's a whole strip or a whole two by two design they
oh no . 145280_145500
now you're gonna turn that one to the radar .
but once it was a strip you see how it was even hard for them to
and the other didn't . 152220_152820
but as they were building it they were talking about what you would
but once it's together and it's a whole . 158220_160290
yeah decomposing that . 160940_161940
and talking about the individual emotions and stuff is harder
in that context of the strip . 170360_171740
what you did to it is so much harder to sort through . 172720_174860
okay . 176230_176330
ten forty . 176520_177100
thank you . 177210_177580
I'm glad that . 178020_178470
