we're &~talk can you talk about the top one please Brittany . 0_2798
+< that one ? 2798_4161
+< the top one . 4161_4391
+< I see four . 4391_5025
+< the one that uses blue green and blue green . 5025_6200
+< I see &~fa I see &~fa I see one in the I see two in the upper
okay how were those rectangles made ? 14298_16600
by just cutting um a square in half down the middle . 16600_21605
okay so if we took the two inch by two inch squares that we've been
how many rectangles that size would it take to cover an entire core
um . 35580_37381
how many rectangles this xxx +/. 37381_43393
+< eight . 43393_43645
+< eight (be)cause +/. 43645_44078
+< good girl . 44078_44528
Brittany thank you for complimenting Katie in such a nice way . 44528_49148
do you see anything else about that core square that none of you
that &~rec using rectangles that are the same size as half of a
that's a new thing to try . 59736_61568
um what else is there that hasn't been done before . 61568_64786
Dani look at that core square please and &~sh tell me something
um . 72513_74383
do you see any other shapes there that we haven't been able to use
oh let her scoot through there Vanessa and Jenna . 80815_82891
there's there's a smaller there's smaller squares well
+< those aren't squares . 90291_91306
there's rectangles in (th)em . 91306_93708
those are rectangles right that's what we just talked about . 93708_96796
Katie told us that we could get eight of eight rectangles that size
um do you see anything else up there that a shape that you
there's another smaller square right there . 107113_109581
okay . 109581_110270
xxx . 110270_112785
okay Dani says she sees smaller squares . 112785_115618
we've used squares in our core squares before haven't we ? 115618_118621
yeah but not that size . 118621_119888
not that size . 119888_120440
how do you get squares that size ? 120440_122230
cut through the middle and then cut through um you cut through the
or you could xxx . 130048_130690
+< okay so if I do that +//. 130690_133290
Brian are you watching good . 133290_135000
okay you gotta see . 135000_135898
I'm &~guh I can make the rectangles by cutting my square right in
if I use squares that big um to plan my core square how many of
+< sixteen . 155286_155706
but this is what I want you to think about how many do you think
and looking up here will help you it's this big . 161008_163660
sixteen . 163660_165010
sixteen . 165010_168771
thank you Brian . 168771_169615
Brian why do you think sixteen is the answer they were all um
because if if you hold up if you hold the little squares that um
okay so by looking at this one and knowing that there are four here
um what's happening in this core square that we haven't tried yet
+^ what's happening in there ? 240170_241383
Brian what do you see ? 241383_242191
I see a square up on the top corner . 242191_246945
yeah . 246945_248796
well this much of it . 248796_251215
what about what about +/. 251215_252540
you know I bet if we let Brian talk we would know what he was
what do you think Brian tell us about that part of the design . 258913_262363
there's a square up in that corner and then and then it goes down
+< well let's see um how many shapes did it take to make that core
how many paper shapes ? 286196_288265
guys and ladies everyone should be thinking about that . 288265_291701
how many paper shapes did it take to create this core square
Brian would you come up and count for us they're thinking but will
I think nine . 315060_316280
come up and count for us . 316280_317613
when you get closer and put your finger on each shape I wanna
Amanda ! 320381_321198
<I can't think> . 321198_323443
mmhm but I hope that you were trying to take it apart with your
can you touch each shape and count for us ? 327850_329528
one two three four five six is that +/. 329528_334850
is that a paper shape ? 334850_339290
yeah . 339290_340025
yeah . 340025_341070
but I think that xxx one is . 341070_344425
oh you mean you think they took an orange square and laid a
there's no overlapping . 348108_349633
if I ask you to think about making this design with no overlapping .
+< oh so then you cut that one xxx . 353720_356523
+< uhhuh uhhuh . 356523_356936
so if you can +//. 356936_358446
&=touches each shape . 358446_366530
sixteen . 366530_367361
sixteen pieces sixteen and you were able to take that apart with
good job . 374000_375350
+^ one thing when Brian looked at this segment of the core square
one . 393773_394158
from no four . 394158_395658
one an orange rectangle and then a red triangle and then two
xxx sort of an animal facing down and then on the bottom like an
okay um anything in this one we haven't used yet ? 413190_417975
yeah . 417975_420461
+< in that core square design . 420461_421310
+< yeah . 421310_421945
what do you see Sarah ? 421945_423746
um the +... 423746_426061
+< Paul it's hard to see when you don't sit up . 426061_427533
do you see any shapes in that core square that you haven't been
um a square . 437663_440950
a square ? 440950_441958
yeah . 441958_442308
you haven't been able to use squares yet ? 442308_444511
yeah we have . 444511_446861
+< or you have ? 446861_447263
you know she's right the um we have been able to use squares that
what about this shape here the yellow green shape ? 452903_456185
yeah . 456185_456720
okay that's the size triangles we've been using a lot of +/. 456720_460161
+< but the rectangles .460161_460800
the rectangles we haven't so this one just the only thing here we
+< xxx . 465076_466060
rectangles . 466060_466376
so look at those three core squares do you think +//. 466376_470446
Kevin please be thinking about this everyone else but give Kevin a
Kevin do you think these um core squares these three core squares
so think about the ones you made for your quilt family booklet and
+^ do you think they're more interesting that the ones you've been
um how about trying a different word . 509540_520515
are these more or less um complicated than the ones that you've
do you &~reme +/. 528471_529561
+< less . 529561_529611
less complicated ? 529611_530913
yeah . 530913_531581
more . 531581_532183
so these are which ones would it be easier to make Kevin the
a core square like +... 547691_548528
Kevin . 548528_549876
um now I think this one . 549876_560608
which one . 560608_561885
whatdya +/. 561885_562626
this one . 562626_565011
and um what do you think about this one ? 565011_568066
