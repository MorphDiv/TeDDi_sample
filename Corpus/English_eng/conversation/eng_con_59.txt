well years ago I think I was about maybe seven or eight .
we used to live in this house .
we had some people living upstairs .
and it was a man named Firstname_L and a lady named Firstname_A .
and they was going together .
and they was always arguing especially on weekends .
Friday and Saturday night .
and one Friday night +...
I think it was on a Friday or Saturday night .
I was young .
but anyway they was upstairs arguing .
I think she pulled a can opener on him .
and he shot her with a shotgun .
well anyway he killed her .
and that was really something for a young child to experience .
but I didn't see him kill her .
because we was downstairs .
but we heard it .
