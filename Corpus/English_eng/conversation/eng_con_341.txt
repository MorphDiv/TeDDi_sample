Right anybody else There should be a timetable at sometime . 813845_821605
Yeah there is . 821775_823375
Eh do . 824005_825025
Already Thursday . 825075_826175
It 's what this Thursday . 826625_828005
Next Thursday . 828005_828785
0 .
Alright . 828875_829035
If it 's if it 's the first Thursday . 829675_834585
Eh right if you 've got one of the the two plus three have we have
Oh . 908705_908955
Oh it is . 909935_910325
Yeah half . 910605_911265
It 's a half now if it 's a half of that And then the second says
0 .
Right the second one now I 'm gon na do is the one that 's equals
0 .
You could square that you could square that complex number right if
0 .
Yeah problems cos once you 've got one over Z squared if I work it
0 .
forty nine on the bottom is that No no not forty nine That 's not
0 .
What 's that So we get minus seven of six two five minus twenty
Yes . 1174625_1174735
Yes . 1174735_1174845
Yes . 1174845_1174955
a bit louder a just seven square minus seven minus seven gives me
Yeah . 1184275_1184335
The minus seven times that we could be . 1185535_1188205
0 .
plus something and an seven times that one would give you minus
0 .
Well what sort it out . 1309655_1310965
Twenty four divide by seven it 's three point six I mean it 's
0 .
one point nine degrees . 1329185_1330405
0 .
So we get the one point nine degrees now we 've got to interpret
0 .
Right then let's that 's what we was doing Now if well certainly
0 .
No all the complex numbers that you get on that on that maths are
Yeah . 1478555_1478905
No worries . 1480045_1480295
Yeah . 1480295_1480635
You 'll probably be able to that . 1481565_1482655
yeah probably . 1482685_1483185
Is the the difficult stuff . 1483185_1484085
Right next question is the one where you 're given these two
First way . 1634615_1634815
Go on it 's up to you . 1634815_1635745
Go on . 1635745_1636075
John said one . 1636075_1636815
working out a modules you have to find the . 1636815_1639315
Sorry did that one I 've got to accept it right find the find . 1640255_1649480
0 .
find the is up that way somewhere that 's fine that 's one argument
Three eight one seven . 1659760_1660180
Seventy eh . 1660210_1660660
forty five degrees . 1661080_1661580
One divided by five have you ever put one divided by five Must be
Yeah we 're waiting for a . 1682880_1701130
0 .
Good Z two is minus two plus three minus two plus three I . 1701130_1706100
0 .
So that 's two that 's three so three one forty five inverse time
0 .
So that 's R Z one Z two that 's two R's together and then what I
0 .
We came to find out .
Yeah . 2005740_2005970
Like you got I mean put the other side of the Cos what we 're going
Ca n't you do the main this way . 2071400_2074770
You ca n't evaporate it yeah It vaporises fairly easy . 2076020_2079940
Well I got . 2079940_2081070
Very very easily vaporises it but and then when I do that I get
Thirty six is it . 2102460_2104850
I do n't know Thirty four oh thirty four all over two All over two
Eh start off with cos you 've gone all the way through that
Yeah eh with the end you could have B equals minus fifteen over
0 .
Now if B is plus three then going back to me formula here is going
I suppose . 2295210_2295500
Three five and when you 've worked these square roots out they
Do we gets points then sir if the other one was twenty five
Yeah it 's just pure coincidence it 's just the way that trotting
Yeah . 2410970_2411510
Or like people come to you getting forty per cent and forty per
Pardon . 2478430_2478510
That 's but that is the hardest thing now the hard thing about that
One point one three four . 2605930_2613810
One point one three four right one point one three four right ok do
Sixty four point nine . 2638310_2640990
Sixty four point nine well sixty five point nought degrees so sixty
Sorry . 2670570_2670670
Do that do that on sixty five divide by one hundred and eighty
Multiple fifteen . 2706920_2707160
