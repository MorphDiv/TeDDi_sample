and deer designs &-um things like that because some of the things
they were triangles or not earlier in the year were what they
and nobody challenged at once . 14730_15750
so when we go back to . 16590_18070
okay what do triangles look like . 18740_20420
what can they look like . 20540_21240
and we look at this . 21970_22550
and they'll say . 22600_23070
oh I'm not sure . 23180_23700
that's a triangle . 23720_24270
well you spent four weeks calling it a triangle every day . 24850_27220
what makes you not sure now . 27670_28950
so that will be &-um an ex another extension that comes after moon
it's over because they use some of them three and four different
and some of those were things that two months ago . 38840_41470
there were heated debates in her classroom over whether they were
in some of the triangles with the right . 48570_50310
angles . 50330_50520
<mhm mhm> mhm . 50900_51280
how . 53270_53370
would you &-uh prepare others to teach in this . 53490_56080
way . 56430_56500
to help children learn . 58350_59370
the things . 60850_60980
&-um . 68550_68710
what advice would you give teacher educators . 71870_74890
district superintendents . 80180_81090
I well integrated thematic instruction makes this possible . 81420_85370
I mean if I was still locked into a different way of delivering
and we would get nowhere . 106440_107360
so these big blocks of time spent on a single project or on a
where are all day every day . 115690_117010
what we are exploring and thinking about and talking about and
that's one reason they're able to come as far as they are . 123800_126650
so just the way I set up my day and schedule and &-um set up my
there's a different theme in each content area . 135460_137560
&-um that's necessary . 138170_139530
and this emphasis on thinking not so much on each year . 140200_145320
my second graders accomplish in different things in the course of
and that doesn't depend on how long it is or what my goals are at
but they think every day all day throughout the unit . 154760_157960
and they talk about their thinking . 158190_159480
&-um they communicate their thinking to others . 160050_162240
and they whatever it is they're thinking about . 162640_165410
they're encouraged to take pride in that . 165860_166840
'cause they're thinking hard . 168420_169320
&-um so an emphasis more on the kinds of thinking I encourage in my
if I say well they were really thinking then usually I'm happy with
and my students &-um determine how this unit turns out each year .
I mean it's definitely what they are interested in what the
they go off on the questions . 198080_199870
they raise &-um the areas that they take interest in . 199990_204260
you know something they bring up that they want to talk about and
you know two hours can disappear . 209380_210820
and it will have been something that was never written in my plans
but it was about quilting . 214000_214740
it was about mathematics . 214760_215990
it was communication . 216660_218380
<it was> it was thinking . 218500_219780
and that's what we did that day . 220000_221030
and that's okay . 221080_221780
so &-um that teacher as a guide teacher as a facilitator . 222260_227900
&-um the teacher doesn't always know where the class is going . 229120_231370
they get (th)em started . 231390_232170
but then they're comfortable going to a point in a direction that
it doesn't matter what day seven was supposed to be . 245480_247560
if during day six in the clothing unit they came up with something
then day seven change up to the plans for day seven . 252530_255090
change to reflect what I saw and heard and watched &-um them do on
that's a remarkable degree of flexibility . 262110_264010
&-uh how are you able to accomplish it without &-uh watching the
and a_lot_of teachers say . 275960_278380
I think that's a recipe that you just prescribed is a recipe for
&-um well how what how do you avoid that . 285210_290820
well I don't just stand back and let them do whatever they want to
I I have each project in mind . 293960_295630
or I have &-um an idea I want to introduce for I'd like to be here
but there has to be some freedom in there for them to do . 301890_305230
so if what they wanna talk about and think about is accomplishing
and I was gonna start in a slightly different way . 312570_314540
I might as well do it . 315350_316150
then when they're ready and they're doing it . 316200_317790
and then I'll have that time in a couple days . 317920_320380
&-um the first year I did it it was different it was maybe more
I didn't know exactly where they ended up . 324680_326310
I had places . 326560_326990
but as you at the end of each week I can say . 327350_329250
well you know this was better than what I had thought we would do .
this was great . 332600_333220
and the second year you expect it to go kind of like it does the
but you know what you wanna do more of . 337940_339750
or I wanna make sure they do more of this . 339900_341340
or we have to introduce this earlier . 341380_342640
'cause then they can really develop in thinking about that item
I didn't plan the right kind of activity . 352680_354140
so each year I think the unit grows and changes or you add new
&-um and then and I I stick to a timeline . 360430_363220
I mean sometimes I have to say that's not gonna happen this year .
I I'd like . 366560_367180
it to I love doing that . 367200_368100
but this group spent a little more time on something else . 368120_371420
and that was a valuable use of of their time &-um . 371620_375290
so you have an image in mind of the way children's thinking in
mhm . 384450_384630
in each of these different &-um about each of these different
transfers lips and turns about the kinds of things that they'll
and if we start moving along toward that or whatever even if it's
I mean you get a feel for the group and a feel for individuals . 411280_414300
and somewhere you know that comment . 414400_415700
don't come up a hot . 415770_416630
so one finally said that they brought that up . 416750_419270
we've talked about that . 419380_420180
we're ready to roll with that now . 420320_421630
but it doesn't happen at exactly the same point each year . 421680_425780
&-um but by the end of you know the end of that week I mean maybe I
and maybe Thursday doesn't bring anything . 433710_435430
but yeah I kind of know what to look for . 435540_437740
and if it doesn't happen then I say to myself . 437760_439420
what do I have to do . 439440_440070
that's totally different . 440120_440860
obviously these kids are still here . 441040_443080
and I wanna take them there . 443300_445180
&-um so it's not just letting them dictate what we do all day every
it's more like giving them permission to continue thinking and
I mean if I say . 458880_459510
okay that you know that's valuable that relates to my goals for you
at the end of this unit I want you to talk about that . 463480_465460
I want you to think about that . 465670_466580
I don't wanna stop and say . 467870_468900
we're gonna think about that next Thursday I wanna think about that
where does where do these judgements of value come from . 473970_477430
well I mean if if someone &-um notices an interesting shape in
well what do you call that . 492210_493270
and we start having a debate about what the name for that
and start linking that to . 496570_497800
well first let's decide what it's not . 498600_500120
do you you know what are shapes that you know . 500170_501510
does it have the properties of that that might that would've
I had planned someone picking one shape out_of someone's design and
well you know what do we call that . 508770_509870
it's not a rectangle . 509920_510710
it's not a square . 510730_511350
it's not a triangle that would be valuable to me . 511400_514470
properties of shaped is what's is something I want them to think
and I want them to apply in different situations . 518970_520909
not just a shape that has shapes on that . 521340_522669
we talk about that shape that occurred in someone's design . 522960_526630
that's a meaningful instance to talk about properties of shapes . 527080_530350
that's not just any shape that's a shape that happened when Katie
they know how that shape came about . 536750_538740
that's a good time to talk about . 539840_540950
so what do we know about this shape . 541080_542330
and then go away . 542930_543430
now that wouldn't have been something I planned I wouldn't have
today we're gonna talk about a trapezoid shape the result . 546410_550540
and I'm gonna see what do they know . 550560_551820
it's a trapezoid do they know it's not a rectangle . 551840_554630
what do they know . 554710_555180
but if that came up that's I wouldn't just freeze the discussion on
oh oh we're not talking about shape today because this unit is
is about space . 564060_564750
and this unit is about all of those things
