we're going to do an explanation quiz . 295_1615
you've got here, one challenge problem where your goal is to sketch the graph based on the clues I'm giving you . 2435_10135
so we're doing a-plus today . 10855_11555
because we ran a little short on time, one of these challenge problems has to be complete . 12135_15915
your teammates will be expected to explain how you got it, anyone can be called on . 16995_20835
you know I have the spinner of death, I will bring it out in a moment . 20975_23515
no more hiding . 24415_27935
and then every teammate, when you know that your teammates are ready, call me over resource manager C, and I will bring you your spinner . 28585_36765
some of you may take a minute because there are eight teams here, I'm going to go around to every single team for an explanation . 37185_43625
please practice, do not just sit there and be like we got this . 44865_47105
because I want to come around once, not two or three times . 47305_50105
once and make sure you know you've got this down, you can explain it . 50545_54345
okay ? 54965_55165
can I get a volunteer to pass these out quickly, xxx and S_three, here . 55765_59185
S_three, you do that half of the class, so these three teams, xxx you do these three teams . 59885_64005
xxx .
you have about twenty minutes to explain, get to it . 64425_72525
okay S_five, I would love for you to spin it . 72945_75145
would you, please ? 75785_76025
oh yeah, you're on number two already ? 76425_77765
rude .
oh no, no, no .
oh that's cold .
xxx .
resource manager ? 78585_81145
oh S_three, let's go . 81425_83225
flip over to the backside, front side . 84765_86065
okay so before you start explaining anything, what was the strength that you said that you were going to bring to your team today ? 86565_93925
the number one: identify and explain the polynomial and what its factors are . 94505_100665
okay . 100825_101005
how did you use that when you and your team were trying to get this sketch of the graph ? 101365_105205
we use this . 106325_108505
okay, say one more sentence about that . 109005_111825
what do you mean you use that ? 111615_112895
so we use this in order to find the points . 113175_116295
this points so we can graph it . 117715_119275
so what did you do ? 121015_122215
what did you, when you brought it to the team, what did you notice about this x-squared ? 122395_126115
that this was a xxx . 127155_129015
so we have to do this and square it so we can get this points . 129315_134935
okay and then, how come when you found this x-squared +... 135855_139355
can I use the bathroom ?
yeah, five minutes please, be fast . 141005_142285
I forgot what I was +... 144725_148305
if this is x-squared and you factored it like you did here, how does that help you find the zeros ? 148645_155765
I don't know . 156685_162065
I just know that we have to factor it, I mean +... 163125_170845
that's funny, you all were so confident moving on to the second one . 169535_171915
I'm going to have to come back and make sure she really understands, how does that help us ? 174215_178655
how does that help us what ? 178915_180375
I don't know, maybe you should've been listening . 180475_182135
wait, what did she say ? 182275_183335
S_two, what did I say, help your team out . 183575_183855
yes, how can we find the zeros in this one ? 183855_185275
okay so basically, we have this right ? 205235_208455
we have this equation, so basically you plug it in, so we can solve for it . 208755_213655
so you know we have x-squared right ? 214455_217955
so we are going to put x and the x-squared is this one, and then from there you +... 220215_232395
he said we have to find the zeros in this one .
yeah I'm going to help you get there .
so you see how we have the seven .
so we put this over here and this point here so we put the x-squared here and the negative seven here .
x times x equals x-squared . 244405_248585
so we have to find two numbers so that when we multiply it together . 247875_249275
we get negative seven, so we have seven, positive seven and negative one . 249535_253675
because they can give us negative seven . 254075_255615
and we know it is going to be correct .
because when we multiply x times seven it gives us positive seven-x . 255955_263515
so then we are going to multiply x times negative one equals negative x, and when we combine these two together it gives us six-x . 263675_273075
do you understand ?
mmhmm . 273935_274895
okay so then, and then you take away the one from the seven and it gives us six . 275235_278835
so the zeros that we found was this one and this one . 279515_282935
so we write x minus one and x plus seven . 283415_289315
and since we have the extra one that he gave us .
and then it is going to be like this .
and then we are going to find the zeros by flipping it . 289755_298975
yeah ? 300735_300835
does it make sense now ?
yes ?
are you sure ?
yes, okay it's what you said, from here, after this, we put, let's say . 315665_333385
if it's positive here, we make it negative and that's how we are going to find the zeros .
oh it hurt . 333545_339205
okay, let's call him over . 339485_345645
TCH .
TCH .
TCH .
you are ready ?
yeah but we were waiting for +...
oh perfect, xxx .
xxx .
S_three, so once you knew to factor this, why does that help you make the sketch of the graph ? 343945_348625
xxx .
we plugged the x-squared here and the negative seven so in order to get the x-squared, we add these two x's . 349385_360725
so for this one, we have to multiply negative one plus the positive seven so we can get the negative seven here . 361145_371825
cool . 372195_372535
okay, then in order to get this, wait +... 372735_376515
the negative one and the seven so we can get the six-x . 377935_383075
so I see what you did +... 383335_384415
sorry, go ahead . 384795_385675
okay . 386015_386235
so we get the x and the negative one here and the x and the positive seven here, and as you gave us this one, we throw it in here . 386415_399835
and to get the zeros, we do the opposite . 399905_402345
give me one example . 403065_404845
so this one is negative one, we do it as positive one . 405085_410945
and for this one, it should be negative one but we do the opposite . 411225_415545
okay, I'm satisfied with that . 415885_417205
okay, so we get an a-plus now ? 417465_417725
yeah .
thank you
