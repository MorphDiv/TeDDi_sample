put those in plate . 830075_831055
Parliament everybody tells me . 842465_846015
oh I have a friend . 846075_847135
I have a brother . 847375_848455
I have my brother . 848695_849415
I have a sister . 849575_850255
I have a friend or not something that's called . 850415_854775
really . 856185_856605
I don't know anybody who's Covid yeah . 856765_858485
it's unbelievable . 858555_859525
in Germany Germany from Macedonia from Africa from I dunno . 859825_868075
not in Australia no I don't dunno . 868255_870795
any . 870795_870915
no . 871255_871475
I dunno . 871475_871755
any . 871755_871915
that's . 871935_872355
strange . 872355_872555
yeah . 877465_877755
they've been here nineteen years from Italy and he's very hard to understand . 877755_884195
his English is very difficult . 884455_886235
isn't it . 886245_886675
yeah . 892635_892925
we have a toast . 892925_893645
toast . 894055_894405
okay . 894555_894845
mhm . 894905_895325
say something . 896665_897205
your last night in Australia . 898715_900365
I hope the experience . 901925_902725
of your . 903105_903445
conference . 903895_904565
it was very worthwhile . 904565_905685
speaking of which . 909685_910285
tell us what you think of it . 910395_912485
are you happy with it . 912985_914205
the Parliament . 915825_916965
yeah . 917355_917645
Parliament it work the effort to fly all this way here . 917645_921885
you have Sydney there are some methodological mistakes . 928785_936685
people want to talk more about their experiences in their country . 939465_942965
their to do they seemed to be very busy too busy to I think you needed a bit . 943135_950765
they should have had more gaps for that sort of thing . 951195_954205
and for free time . 954945_955885
and the the space of the Masonic Center is very like opposite because there is no there are no windows . 958065_969845
you are always like . 970465_971565
so we become more tired than maybe you could be a place that have windows . 972265_978365
and you are not always in the air conditioner . 978585_981005
it was good . 985385_985965
did you talk at all or did you talk much . 986905_990445
did you suggest anything . 990585_991925
or did you just listen to things . 992105_994645
I didn't talk much . 994805_995565
I realized that my English is . 997445_998885
your English is fine . 999635_1000565
your . 1002195_1002485
English is . 1002485_1003005
is fine . 1003005_1003245
it's good . 1003245_1003525
yeah . 1003555_1003845
but not to express this . 1003845_1005125
now spread really . 1005225_1007165
but is there anything that you got from it that you'd take back to Germany and try and put into practice somehow . 1007825_1012445
or yeah . 1012585_1013125
what type of things we make . 1013355_1014565
these action plans . 1014565_1015325
and I got many . 1015625_1017445
yeah ideas . 1018995_1019405
but to do with what some things were poverty . 1019425_1021805
and poverty is not an issue in Germany so what sort of things would be applicable to Germany that would benefit . 1021905_1028725
you . 1028745_1028965
yeah . 1028965_1029245
environment . 1029245_1029725
Germany's so good with environment or it used to be . 1031035_1033605
well Germany's very Crossy isn't it . 1033795_1036205
yeah . 1036595_1036885
yeah . 1037915_1038205
but they produce much rubbish . 1038265_1042485
and they use much resources and . 1042705_1045965
huge factors in Germany . 1046355_1047525
that's very . 1048905_1049525
they'd have a lot of pollution control . 1049705_1051605
wouldn't they in Germany yeah . 1051605_1053565
but they should have even more because years ago when we went there you weren't allowed to wash your car . 1053625_1060445
you had to on the had to wash your car on a special place . 1061305_1065285
you couldn't wash the car on the grass because the chemicals would go into the world . 1065345_1071045
when here we they ask us to wash the car on the grass so that it disperses the chemicals . 1072075_1078205
do they care in Brazil what's the . 1080025_1084525
it's . 1090555_1090845
important that they start to think globally and not just and think about the future sustainability . 1090845_1100685
because they just gives everything but don't give anything back to the other countries or to the nature . 1100755_1109885
and they they're they bring rubbish to other countries . 1109985_1117525
gives them money for that for things like that . 1118695_1121965
because you've got countries around you . 1122685_1124085
what is it . 1124395_1124965
<Paul and> Paul and Czechoslovakia which would pay which would be happy to be paid . 1125435_1132685
wouldn't . 1132685_1133125
they . 1133125_1133245
yeah that's the problem . 1133245_1134725
and they just throw the rubbish anywhere or dunno . 1135225_1138645
what they do . 1138645_1139085
put into the sea . 1139265_1140565
and in the end it all comes back to . 1141905_1143885
you can just the next generation or the over the border . 1143885_1148325
and then it's away and it doesn't work so . 1148505_1151445
we say out of sight out of mind . 1152145_1154765
if you know that places like Lu Ludwig's har . 1155505_1161885
there's huge factories all through . 1163035_1164645
have you been through that that part of Germany lus har . 1164715_1168205
there's big factories like &-uh I think Bayer and these sorts of companies there . 1168995_1172925
and steam and pollution billowing out all the time . 1173065_1176925
oh but we every country has some . 1177385_1179725
yeah . 1179755_1180045
but Germany's the sort of manufacturing center of &-uh most of Europe it's . 1180045_1185045
huge . 1185045_1185285
really . 1185285_1185605
they do many stupid things like with the nuclear nuclear energy . 1196115_1203405
yeah . 1204115_1204405
and it doesn't make any sense because you have to put much more energy in producing this energy . 1205065_1215845
then you get out in the end . 1215875_1217285
and you have so much rubbish . 1217345_1219165
and you dunno what to do with it . 1219425_1220885
and they just keep on doing it . 1220985_1223005
we dunno much about nuclear energy . 1223785_1225605
there's a plant near us . 1227035_1228325
but . 1228345_1228565
it's not really used nuclear . 1228565_1229845
energy's a terrible lot of opposition to it . 1230525_1233965
isn't there . 1233975_1234445
but something they started doing here . 1234465_1237645
which I feel happy . 1237645_1239845
I'm helping with is &-um the electricity you have a choice if you where you get your electricity from . 1239985_1250005
yeah that's they started that in Germany now . 1250005_1252325
ah . 1252505_1252725
so you can choose which we've done to pay . 1252945_1255645
I wonder to swap with the salad one hundred percent from things like wind &-uh things that don't create more trouble than more pollution . 1256205_1271005
so wind and solar what's the other one . 1272225_1275325
I'm trying to think what's the other one for electricity that doesn't wind solar water water and time mess mess gas gas . 1275385_1286085
I don't think we have any gas natural gas much here it's from the cows and the oh <methane methane> methane . 1286685_1295365
I haven't heard anything about that . 1296085_1297365
the I went to a farmer who built it by himself . 1297865_1301885
I think he asked somebody from England I know to buy &-uh such a machine to produce an engine was so expensive . 1302565_1311725
so he built it by himself . 1312185_1313725
wow . 1314545_1314765
and he puts from the cows on the dining side and everything . 1315105_1318365
and he he produces so much energy that it's enough for the whole village . 1319425_1327165
yeah right . 1327915_1328725
yeah . 1328915_1329205
okay that's good . 1331035_1331845
and they started that in India I think because they are these villages where the people are used to collect the shit of the cows because they and they burn it for for the fields . 1334305_1349605
and now they bring it all evening to the machine that produces the electricity . 1351145_1359205
that's good . 1360065_1360685
and the next day they get it back and can put it on the fields because it's even better than when you get afterwards . 1360705_1369325
so they only take the gas out . 1369325_1370685
and they do anything else with it . 1370685_1372085
I've . 1373475_1373765
never heard of that . 1373765_1374325
have you . 1374325_1374725
no we don't . 1374905_1375365
and then you can get it back and put it on the p on it . 1375545_1378205
yeah . 1379395_1379685
it's very good . 1379685_1380205
I like that . 1381445_1381885
now the only thing here really is solar . 1384225_1387845
like they should use a lot more than they do . 1388115_1390205
they're now encouraging people with houses to put in solar heating for the hot water . 1390995_1397965
we've got sorry . 1399655_1401045
sorry . 1401135_1401485
we've got one our hot water . 1401735_1406245
but some in the country they've got a lot of wind ponds you know windmill type like the old fashioned windmills which work really well . 1409505_1417085
also sold stuff . 1417875_1418965
we also we have a big water tank at our house . 1418965_1420685
which was Heather's idea . 1420685_1422085
five thousand . 1422955_1423605
it's not that big but . 1423715_1424605
five thousand liter of water tank . 1424675_1426445
so all the excess rain that falls onto the roof instead of just going down the drains it goes into this . 1426585_1432005
tank for the garden . 1432435_1433125
five water . 1433235_1434045
the garden . 1434065_1434445
tank tank . 1434595_1435085
and that waters all our gardens and fills up the swimming pool . 1435085_1437925
it's quite . 1440315_1440725
because we get a lot of rain . 1440725_1441965
but then it goes into the rivers or into the salt . 1443345_1446165
and you can't use it . 1446185_1447005
so did you see the at the Olympics they had the big solar panels for all the lights . 1447305_1456885
I thought that was good . 1457005_1457765
probably cost an absolute fortune . 1459045_1460405
but it'll be around forever . 1460625_1462325
well twenty years at least I should think that works . 1462475_1464845
and another thing that's very it's incredible that they use drink water for the toilets and rain water or something . 1466985_1476925
so every last few use five liters or something in America in seven or ten . 1478105_1484005
yep . 1484345_1484565
such a waste isn't it . 1485475_1486605
they don't wanna change that . 1489435_1491045
there's a house in that was built in Sydney it was converted . 1492395_1496485
it was an old house . 1496485_1497325
and they converted it to run completely without &-uh town electricity without town water . 1498945_1505885
so it was self-sufficient and all the water that it collected from the roof went into . 1506065_1511005
&-um they purified their own for drinking . 1511065_1514205
but they also everything the sewer all the rubbish from the food . 1514425_1518965
everything went into a big big tank . 1518965_1521525
mhm . 1521785_1522205
and they adjusted it with had scientists from the university come . 1522505_1527005
and they adjusted all of the what you call like little animals and things microorganisms all the the whole environment . 1527225_1536645
so everything broke down the way it was supposed to . 1537145_1539605
and we ended up drinking that water all the rubbish including the sewage . 1540425_1544565
and they had yeah exactly . 1545465_1546925
but they tested it was tested all tested . 1547745_1549725
and it worked perfectly . 1549905_1551005
they had very small house but very small backyard . 1551475_1555725
and they had frogs coming in . 1555825_1557365
because they have they built a pond . 1557605_1559405
and all the frogs came in and all solar heating for the water and solar panels for electricity . 1559425_1565725
it was just wonderful . 1565785_1567485
this was in the center of Sydney wasn't it . 1567485_1569085
yeah . 1569085_1569285
it was around Utah somewhere like that near Michelle . 1569345_1571765
it was one of those terrace houses the old fashioned very well known . 1572865_1577605
so it can be done . 1578745_1579645
okay . 1580675_1580965
and the problem is that the government gives much more support to this nuclear energy than to the other . 1583425_1590965
yeah . 1591355_1591645
which creates problems . 1591645_1593045
yeah . 1593235_1593525
yeah . 1593595_1593885
and if they would support all these things they put the science and everything . 1594145_1600285
and they would be more effective . 1600945_1602805
yeah . 1603115_1603405
but as long as they don't do it it's too expensive . 1604995_1608455
we buy &-uh usings from Germany Organic . 1612155_1618615
is that correct . 1620435_1621135
trying to give it to me for that five times that they thought it in the garden . 1622915_1626455
I thank . 1632375_1632695
excuse . 1636755_1637175
you're doing too much to . 1637795_1638775
some growing in the garden . 1639085_1640415
and also they support all the airlines than the trains . 1646035_1650615
so it's cheaper to fly somewhere than to take the train the trains so expensive everybody takes the plane . 1651355_1658575
it's fast . 1659525_1660095
it's cheaper . 1660405_1661815
and but it creates more pollution and things . 1663315_1666015
so . 1668355_1668575
yeah that's silly because I thought Germany was really good with it's better than other countries . 1669645_1675655
but it's not good enough . 1675955_1677455
no not when you've got so many people they're very good with things like p v C though packaging and all that being out for . 1677955_1685735
but . 1688555_1688775
yeah a little bit of I question Heather doesn't need it . 1689365_1697375
if it's got any little bit of burns on it . 1697375_1699135
cancer . 1699875_1700295
oh yes . 1700715_1701215
that's not why but it's a good reason . 1701555_1703855
it's the same with barbecues . 1707045_1708415
now they're saying . 1708415_1709095
barbecued meat is not good for you . 1709895_1711415
it's a pity . 1713605_1714375
but they're the best bar . 1715035_1716135
do you have barbecues in Brazil yeah <we call it> we call it that sounds Asian it sounds like Chinese Suda there is in Spanish same words as they made or fish too anything whatever you want . 1717475_1744295
but we used to have like a stick . 1744355_1748615
and you fish like . 1749395_1752135
ish . 1752375_1752455
yeah not in Germany I shouldn't think you don't have barbecues . 1754645_1761335
do you I have . 1761335_1762055
oh there are these . 1762155_1765505
shava . 1767515_1767865
oh gardens . 1769325_1769865
special places . 1770135_1771185
yeah . 1771215_1771505
for . 1771765_1771985
people who don't have a garden at their house . 1771985_1774025
and some they're all there . 1774725_1776425
that's a nice idea . 1776685_1777625
is that attached to a pub . 1778645_1779985
like a an ale house . 1780295_1782845
a pub . 1783605_1783965
no . 1784985_1785205
it's just a place where food . 1785595_1786605
so they take . 1786605_1786925
their own food . 1786925_1787565
no no it's it's not it's for people who don't have garden . 1787705_1791485
so that they have a small like that side . 1792185_1795365
yeah yeah like a whole . 1795635_1798405
so they take their own mates . 1799345_1800645
they have their garden . 1800645_1801765

and the the skirts go out . 2181865_2183765
and they spin in circles . 2183785_2185005
and they write in books in English about people being a Whirling dervish . 2185745_2190005

and it still doesn't stop . 2228265_2230725
she didn't say much . 2234065_2235085
today . 2235175_2235525
it's funny . 2236035_2236525
she's probably too tired . 2237215_2238285
she's been had so many assignments . 2238455_2240525
maybe just the situation . 2241335_2243645

Michelle belongs to some women's thing at university . 2277365_2281125
she's . 2281255_2281605
she's one of the leaders of whatever . 2281775_2283805
she's one of these feminist type people . 2284135_2287245
wow . 2288145_2288365
don't quite understand why but . 2291375_2293205
oh I do . 2294025_2294485
you do of course I do . 2295025_2296245
why do you . 2296545_2297005
she just wants to be different . 2299465_2300645
I think . 2300725_2301005
no . 2302425_2302645
she's after equal rights in all ways . 2302645_2304725
yeah . 2305395_2305685
and that's fine . 2306475_2307095
yeah . 2308205_2308495
as long wants the men to be down there . 2308495_2311455
the women to . 2312555_2313215
be down there . 2313215_2313775
she might say that . 2314715_2315765
but inside she doesn't really she's active . 2315825_2319125
so what about Brazil what do you think Brazil needs to do to change &-um that because you have some people that are worried about environment issues . 2325385_2338045
but in fact you don't see many things happening . 2339745_2343285
you know like this . 2344025_2345085
there's just two I think that's because we have a lot . 2345395_2347885
so we have a lot of water . 2348465_2349965
we have a lot of . 2350425_2351245
and so you see people like doing water away . 2351545_2355165
and and they're making this . 2355665_2359765
we use we have some all the year . 2360985_2366365
and you don't have like political interesting or even &-uh social oppression that you have all housing solar energy . 2366425_2378805
so you do have solar energy or not . 2381505_2383365
yeah that's silly . 2385155_2385925
you should start like we are starting but yeah we have should be more here . 2385985_2391445
just I dunno . 2393755_2395205
how to call it . 2395205_2395925
hydroelectric . 2396195_2397045
I dunno . 2397245_2397605
we yeah the Hydroelectric hydro . 2397605_2399365
and for example now we have summertime one have one hour . 2402025_2408565
yep . 2408905_2409125
we call it daylight saving daylight . 2409505_2411685
and people even are always oh have days or you know you don't have this environment sens or people that are really terrorism around this . 2413185_2429525
and we have a cuter problem that you have safety safe things in life for oh to economy or people that . 2431105_2442485
oh people that sometimes to waste is sign of of wealth . 2443625_2450205
yeah . 2450435_2450725
so it's terrible to work with this mind . 2451545_2454685
so you have to waste like . 2457625_2459285
oh we're not controlling . 2459545_2461765
it's really I hope it's changing here . 2463195_2466485
but there's a lot of encouragement to &-um like to recycle all all your rubbish to make compost out of all your rubbish . 2466505_2475165
except I can't seem to get it to work . 2475225_2477845
the ants enjoyed it . 2478385_2479285
I bought worms you . 2480005_2482085
heard of worms that special worms that eat all your food . 2482085_2486645
scraps . 2486745_2487165
mhm . 2487305_2487725
&-um not . 2488265_2489245
yeah . 2489715_2490005
they even eat meat . 2490005_2490885
don't they they also eat meat . 2490935_2492405
so I got this special one last Christmas bought lots of worms . 2493505_2498165
I gave them lots of food . 2498925_2500125
they don't like much orange . 2500395_2501565
they don't like oranges or acid type food . 2501715_2505125
mhm . 2505125_2505485
except I had a problem because the ants got in and ate . 2506265_2509045
I haven't had much luck . 2512165_2513285
no . 2513465_2513685
yeah we have no food outside of the garden and tin metal . 2514875_2530605
we don't recycle anything pretty well we are . 2533705_2538845
but they say that they're not using the paper that we're recycling . 2538905_2542485
they can't use all of the paper . 2542555_2544205
so that's not working . 2545625_2546965
but now something's very good . 2547225_2549365
now they recycle we have a big bin a real big bin . 2549465_2553125
&-uh this big once a fortnight it's about this big round . 2553905_2558485
every two weeks they collect all the green rubbish which is from the garden . 2559055_2563805
so you cut down trees or whatever . 2564265_2567725
you you throw out flowers . 2568265_2569725
anything from the garden . 2570245_2571125
it goes in this bin . 2572745_2573805
and it goes to one special place . 2573945_2576405
and they make compost which they sell back to the community . 2576465_2580805
so that's a good idea . 2580905_2581845
yeah that works well . 2582155_2583525
I'm sure . 2583945_2584285
whatever we're doing here . 2584485_2585285
it started in probably Germany probably . 2585345_2587485
about ten years ago . 2587485_2588085
yeah . 2588355_2588645
Germany's and England is so far behind . 2588795_2592165
well . 2592635_2592925
England's so far behind in everything . 2592925_2594565
yeah . 2594635_2594925
only put seat belts in cars in England about five years ago . 2595395_2598085
I should have left your toilet paper . 2599005_2600525
but I bought you special toilet toilet paper . 2600545_2602485
I should have left it in the packet . 2604365_2605685

environmentally good toilet paper . 2607105_2610085
