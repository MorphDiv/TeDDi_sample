okay these two gangsters twenty years ago made a pact to be in this
and the cop that came through checking the doors was actually his
and he just wanted to make sure he was there .
you_know the guy didn't expect him to be a cop since he was a
and the guy set him up because he knew he was coming twenty years
and they was just trying to make sure he could catch him .
since I'm a cop now you_know .
so he sent the phony guy over to impersonate him .
and the guy finally figured it out .
but by the time he did he was under arrest .
he took all that time for questions I guess .
that was a pretty good story .
that's mostly the gist of it .
I guess you didn't say what happened .
in the end he just got arrested .
he really wasn't arrested .
yeah you did say he was arrested .
but it's supposed to be ten minutes from now .
he gave him the note .
the guy finally told him who he as .
said he was there the whole time .
okay one night I stayed out past curfew .
I was supposed to be in the house like twelve .
I must have came in maybe one or two o'clock that night .
you_know I was a teenager maybe fifteen seventeen years old .
maybe even younger .
I don't think I was maybe twelve or fourteen .
so I came in and +...
my mother slept on the second floor .
my room is on the third floor .
so I couldn't get upstairs to my room that night .
I stayed in the livingroom .
turned on the tv .
and I was acting like I got up in the morning to watch tv and fell
so in the morning +...
so about seven o'clock eight o'clock she was up cooking .
my mother was upstairs in the kitchen cooking breakfast .
I was still on the couch asleep though I must have been dreaming .
I actually physically in my dream got up .
went upstairs (be)cause the phone rang .
I answered the phone .
it was a lady from my church that said this woman had just passed .
so I said +"/.
+" okay I'll tell my mom .
so actually the phone did ring five minutes .
so I went upstairs .
in my dream I went upstairs and told her .
you_know I physically did get up (be)cause I heard the phone ring .
it must have woke me up or something .
I went upstairs and told her that the lady had passed .
so she told be +"/.
+" stop playing .
I shouldn't kid around like that .
the lady was real sick .
so on and so forth .
so soon as she told me that I'm not sure if <she hit>
she had called and told me to put my mother on the phone .
and she got on the phone and said the lady had just passed .
and <I never got> <I ask my mother>
I say +"/.
+" wow .
(be)cause it be buggin(g) me .
what was all that about ?
maybe because we just went the day before .
she was real sick .
and we prayed for her and everything .
