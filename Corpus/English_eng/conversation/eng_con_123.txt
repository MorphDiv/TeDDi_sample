0 .
the nearest one .
You mean it 's a fire exit so that 's the problem so you 're not
But ah so this it 's the actual fire exit for here int .
Mm .
it Yeah .
Mm .
That leads downstairs do n't it .
Yeah It goes out next to the cellar .
I suppose like you say at nine thirty once the music starts
Oh er if you put if you put if you put wrought iron gates gates
Yeah .
and then somebody stands there two fifty that 's what I were
Mm .
And and wrought iron it yeah you know .
Well wrought iron 'd look it 'd look quite good for the functions
Yeah .
the artificial plants up it .
Mm .
and whatever else .
Yeah .
when you do .
Get climbing plants .
Yeah .
You can get it it will soon cover .
Yeah .

Mm .
Get your wrought your gates there or something like that to be .
Yeah .
round the back which entrance would they come in They would n't
Well all you do right you have gates .
Well I mean .
then they 're open so that at half nine you close them
Yeah .
way or whatever .
Yeah I mean I I think you just have to but .
It 's something that you 've got ta be .
You 'd have to play it by ear I think Yes .
thinking ahead .
Yeah Yeah .
You know you 're thinking well .
Let's .
at first you could just wrought iron it round and and just
As you say if somebody 's been in there from bloody five o'clock
Well that 's it .
or twelve then fine let them I mean I th I would n't I would n't
No .
you know I mean .
So you could either come in half eight half nine or .
That 's right You know .
But really you know .
Yeah .
what you do At half nine you put someone on the door here
Mm .
anyone who 's been drinking all afternoon if you want to er
Yeah I mean what you what you 'd have to be careful of is is sooner
Yeah .
coming in at quarter past nine .
Yeah Yeah .
buying one extra drink and erm getting a you know cheaper than
pint they buy and if they buy five pints .
Yeah .
they can have a three er er a three pound voucher .
Can you imagine Polly organizing that all .
0 .
0 .
We 're getting complicated are n't we .
Why ca n't we do it to me cost effective .
0 .
0 .
Torture .
Complicating issues .
I remember at the Uni when we used to give we used to put stamps on
Yeah .
for pass outs and that or anything .
So does Broadway .
and er I bloody I said I said in the end I 've what we ought to do
0 .
eventually after about two years when you get this sort of armless
Oh oh .
body oh he 's a good customer We 'll let him in for free He gets a
Well it 's like like a all you want to do is .
0 .
0 .
That 's what you get you just got ta stand or you went
Yeah th the trouble is you 're .
and got a stamp .
you .
and they would .
you you 're doing it in the same room .
Yeah .
are n't you That 's the .
That is as well .
But I I du n no I see it 's not once you 're u actually up here
Yeah .
It 's not quite as cold and empty as .
If it got going you 'd probably use mo another another half
Yeah yeah you want .
you do n't wan na close it off But like you say maybe just
Yeah .
ironwork .
Yeah I think so .
to just .
I think you do I think that would look good anyway and .
Yeah .
and it would also enable you to quickly and easily do something on
Mm .
I mean I would n't suggest putting .
0 .
plants up and everything for our normal you know rock nights I mean
I mean with them sort of then .
Yeah .
once you got erm tied into these you can .
Oh yeah .
do whatever to the thing .
Yeah .
But it would give you affect .
That 's right I mean those are just we just went out and chucked a
They 're not real then Barry .
No the trees are the er things tied on to them are n't .
Oh .
But er .
Yeah I think it 's quite actually it needs a bit of
I mean that 'll cover .
Yeah .
if you did that in quite a few places .
Yeah .
throughout the room it would cover your cracks and your holes .
Ye 0 .
and your your .
I mean what we initially wanted to do with all this was cover this
Mm .
I mean again it 's ideas when you 're sat .
It 's ideas .
planning before you 've actually moved in and get .
It is Yeah yeah that 's right .
and get and then then you start .
0 .
that 's that 's the other thing when there 's only two of you
No I know that .
and expand it and whereas you know that that 's one area that 'd be
Yeah .
that you go in and say well you know .
It sounds like this sort of thing .
Yeah .
0 .
When did you paint all this green .
It was when I was working for Walt Disney so it 'll be two years
Yeah .
ago I was over in Belfast and I came back and it were green It was
Yeah .
for two years .
Yeah .
But again it was all done it was all literally done in a weekend .
Yeah .
It was like a virtually an all night blitz job and so bits of it
Something there Barry little bit in there look .
Just coming down a little bit They just need brushing back up .
It 's got a few you 've got the .
Not a problem .
roof repaired have n't you This .
Yeah The heating 's very efficient as well It 's very hot gas
Yes .
Erm .
They did do it like you say it was more or less just covering for
Mm .
you build up up and up do n't you .
Yeah .
So .
Yes .
Let us have a look at cellar and then we 'll d' ya wan na
Yeah .
then we can say we 've to looked at everything and then we
Yeah Okay .
and then we can er we can start you know we can at least we
Yeah .
But we need a full .
Yeah I mean we can we can start by we I mean we can get people set
Yeah .
The little bits and pieces that we talked about .
Well we well we we can start if you wan na start with the .
Or we can think about doing something about .
Yes .
this .
We can start giving it a lick of paint if you wan na start giving
You see now the more you think about it I mean the more you you do
No .
very much I mean you look at it if everybody was seated in this
I .
thirty people .
I do n't think it 's too bad actually I do n't think the carpet 's
Well th there 's areas I mean .
Yeah .
tha the licens .
Oh yeah .
the licensing people would pull us up on that .
Yeah .
if they came .
But maybe if you could cut it off from there .
That 's what I mean you got ta and then do it clear it and then
Mm .
and just left that area .
Clear all that .
and they 're obviously they 're gon na say .
Come right up to the right up to bar really are n't you .
Yeah I mean th th er the other thing psychologically is it 's you
Blue Rhapsody .
Blue Rhapsody If you wanted to cha if you want to change it
You know I think it I think it 's something that you can
Mm .
once we get it going but le .
Mm .
alright we we 've got .
Yeah .
a few bob in the kitty .
Right .
let's or we can go to brewery for another five grand we 'll
Mm .
now .
I reckon the first thing really is is get your salary .
Mm .
Get your salary that you feel that I 'm doing this and I 'm getting
Mm .
Is that the right sort of if our I mean from our objective is to
Yeah .
right now .
That 's right That 's right .
And we 've got ta .
That 's right .
manipulate people to say well how do we get them drink more And you
How bad 's the seating though .
Sit there till .
Is it is it that bad .
It 's it 's if it needs doing .
Oh it needs doing does it .
You know .
If you 've got a guy gathered I 'm not saying try but if you got
Oh yeah Yeah Yeah But it i .
An upholster .
It 's a perpetual patching up job at the moment .
Yeah Yeah .
Because because it is only patched up it 's .
Yeah .
it create more problems o you know cos people stand on it and .
Get an upholsterer just to come and tidy it up .
Yeah .
and fill in where there 's been .
Yeah .
some damage done .
Yeah that 's right I mean there 's .
Just just tart it up really .
There 's a bit of structural damage to the support .
Yeah .
and things like that that start the seating going and things .
Right Okay .
Oh this this actual stuff anyway we 'll go we 're putting that with
Oh yes .
the back 's have been .
Yeah .
alright .
Oh yeah .
0 .
There 's a few of them damaged but but erm I think we 've repaired
Yeah That 's right .
Well we we we know .
We knew .
about that .
about that .
0 .
How Did he .
Cos we .
owe you money .
we gone .
Well .
and got it actually .
Did you .
Bloody right .
God You must be one of the few people .
It were quite good cos what we had we had th the the other
He was called what was he called Ken .
No no .
No .
No that 's .
Yes .
that 's John .
But what do you call him That erm .
I know who you mean I met him yeah .
Cos the other guy was a was a bar manager Duncan or .
Mm .
Der summat like that and his wife had a baby at the same time as

be But er in the end they never got the license back Because what
Cos the .
Alex .
The Alex .
They tried to get behind there the catholic .
Yeah .
club .

about five grand at one stage and got it down to three and half and
0 .
and then they got .
He paid it .
Paid it through the court .

Because you get people like Ben who 's giving his money he
He do n't give a toss .
