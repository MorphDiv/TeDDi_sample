um when &~ran when &-uh &~ran .
is it Randy ?
is the boy named Randy ?
<Randy and Lisa> when Randy and Lisa came home their mother
and where do you wanna go to eat out ?
Mcdonalds they all shouted .
and they jumped into the car and rode to the nearest Mcdonalds .
<Lisa &~li &-um &~r> Ryan <he he ordered &-um a> he
<and Lisa> and Lisa <made &~u> finally made up her mind by
<&~wh> when she told the clerk that he said <it was &~thir>
except for one problem .
mother reached into her purse and found that it wasn't there .
that she had left it on the kitchen counter at home .
once upon a time there was a boy named +...
this goes with this picture .
there was a boy named Allen .
he was sleeping so long that <he was> he was late for school .
this is not the picture yet .
he got quickly dressed .
but <&~th but &~h> he missed the bus because he was so slow .
he gotta school very late .
and his teacher told him next time to catch the bus .
in gym he he sat down to tie his shoe .
but one of his shoelaces ripped off .
and he was really having a bad day .
when he came home he decided to put on his pajamas and decided to
and he worried about the clock about when mom was going to get home
what would he tell her ?
once upon a time a little girl and a little boy went to the park .
the little girl Sumie <saw &~som> saw some <spotted>
she thought they were might fun to play with .
look at that one holding the dog she said .
that one it looks like maybe I can play with it she said .
but the boy grabbed her .
or the girl grabbed his hand .
and she said come on .
let's go play with the doggy and <the &~g> the little person .
<but the &~f> but the boy said I don't know .
they could be from somewhere we don't know .
<and quite right> and quite now the boy was right .
it was a space alien ship that landed down .
it looked like some aliens were moving to this park .
one <was a &~mo> was a father alien coming out holding stuff .
looks like they were going to move here .
and <one was a> another was a mother alien who came down with
the child had had <a little dog> a little alien pet dog .
it seemed like that the boy was right .
come on sis he said .
let's get out_of here .
I think we might be imagining this .
but I wanna play with the doggy said the little girl .
but it was too late .
the boy had already grabbed her hand and took her <&~h> all
since the alien people did not spot them <they> the mother
so <is this> this park is also great for my little child to
and and <no wait> the boy and the girl ran home .
the girl shouted with relief and said mommy daddy there is new
they are really cool .
and they have a pet dog and a child almost like my age .
but the boy interrupted the girl's sentence and said <she's she's
she's lying .
it's at least I saw the whole thing .
the spaceship that they came down from and the father alien and the
you better come and see it he said .
but the mother and father did not believe the boy's sentence .
they only believed the girl's sentence .
and <they went down> they went down to the park .
but the <the> alien <&~s> people they were not there .
the boy looked around .
their ship had gone up .
it seemed like they had moved back to space <and> since this
so the mother and father did not even know <what the &~lit>
the end
