so the only part of this strip that you checked is just the first
so you mean if the first four square of this strip match and the
I'm looking at this strip here . 17660_18790
and I'm checking it the way you did . 19440_20780
let's see green square on the bottom . 20900_22310
and then above that one that's red on the bottom . 22860_24990
and then green on the top and on the bottom . 25060_26620
green on the top . 26640_27190
and then next_to that a red square . 27300_28900
and then under that &-um . 29700_30860
green on the top but the bottom one . 31450_32750
the same as this one . 32800_33420
but . 35020_35190
you just told me that you looked at this core square right . 35240_38180
and you looked at the first core square in that first strip . 38740_40940
and since this core square and that first core square there were
you said this strip might be the same . 44180_45540
but I just found out that this core square and the first one and
so this strip must be the same as that one . 51080_52700
well it isn't the same because it has a red . 53710_56350
first one has a red square . 57290_58700
but that this one has a red triangle at the bottom and not the
so I see why these two strips aren't the same . 65670_67780
but the rule you gave me for how you could tell if this strip
so when I tested this one I took the first core square . 75550_77780
and it was the same . 78420_79340
this one isn't the same . 90670_91890
oh I guess it's this . 94900_98890
these aren't the same what . 99010_101740
these aren't the same . 102050_103060
because I started with the one . 104060_105580
these four aren't the same which . 106250_108380
four . 108400_108500
these four . 109410_109980
which four . 112810_113380
this one the same this one . 113710_115190
&-um you know what . 115950_116500
but they're not part of the same core square . 116520_118140
so you gotta take just one core square at a time . 119660_121380
there's one two three four . 121400_123950
the ones you were just showing to me were half of one core square
so if you pay attention to which core square is which those two
'cause this is a core square . 135950_137060
here is that core square right there . 137080_138900
the same as this one here . 138980_140020
yes . 141820_141920
yeah . 142760_142840
how did . 143740_144140
how was this strip . 144400_145020
made what was done to the core square each time to make this strip
the first one that you and Jenna made . 148260_149750
it was <copy core> copy core copy copy . 150500_152800
is this one a copy core every time . 153700_155300
no . 163140_163310
how can you tell . 163870_164260
because I checked on this and then to second last . 164430_169210
mhm . 169300_169450
and then there's a red square there instead_of a a v with red
and then there's a red square at the end instead_of red green . 177020_181070
okay . 181430_181700
so if this strip wasn't made by going <copy core copy core copy
how was this strip . 186940_187940
made . 188070_188230
look at that for a minute and see if you can figure it out while I
yes . 191780_191810
sir . 192130_192320
go ahead . 192340_192620
how what was the pattern that this strip follows . 194080_196310
it does start with a copy core . 196540_198020
doesn't it . 198040_198380
I approved that a minute ago when I was checking it . 198600_200500
so it is a copy core in that first four square position . 200600_204620
but what_about there . 204660_205580
what was done to the core to get . 205630_207000
it to look like that . 207080_207590
flip . 207830_208070
what kind of flip . 208190_208980
hmm . 210710_210750
or a turn one of those . 212700_214230
it could be a flip or a turn . 215280_216500
well look at this one here and see what you think it was . 216590_219350
here's a copy of the core . 220260_221340
we can use these to remake this strip here . 221420_223230
