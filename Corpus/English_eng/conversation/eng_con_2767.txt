<mister> Justice , in listening to your recollections about
you love American history and love the sort of sweep of it .
do you remember where that began to grow ?
well , I liked history and probably a good bit of it was instilled
and elections , I was always interested in elections at every level
well , another theme that comes through in your discussion of the
is that something that you always had or that was fostered by that
well , I think it was fostered by that experience .
I think one has to learn in a way to like the outdoors and to enjoy
I was never a fisherman particularly , and I was never a hunter .
warren Burger often went hunting with his brothers and others .
I never did .
but there's so much to gain from outdoor experience and the beauty
another theme is the Native Americans you wrote about .
you wrote a number of well-known opinions about them .
did you have exposure to Native American culture or history in any
well , living in the Upper Midwest one is bound to be exposed to it
I was always interested in the battles from an historical point of
there's a place , it's a park nowadays , just south of <Saint>
of course , I'd always , the name Sioux always indicated to me a
but Native American culture was certainly present in the Midwest as
it wasn't dominant at all , but one was conscious of it , and I
another strand of your opinions is your solicitude or concern for
do you think that grew at all out of this period , this early
well , it might have , perhaps .
certainly a good body of the people in the Upper Midwest were not
so many of them , of course , were of Scandinavian origin and
those ties are pretty strong , I think , among the Scandinavian
they're good , hearty , cohesive people .
a little stubborn here around the edges but they were there and
did you see discrimination against immigrants ?
or , you spoke about the African-American community , did you
well , I saw it against the African-Americans and to some degree
I didn't see it too much against immigrants as such , there were
do you remember any specific cases of discrimination that you saw
well , they were pushed aside a little bit , but nothing outrageous
I was conscious of it .
another area that you're famous for , almost legendary for , is
how did that come about ?
when did you first get interested in the game and how did you
well , I like baseball , I suppose in part because it's
in those days while the Twin Cities didn't have any Major League
and I'm positive some of the teams in both of those leagues were
this is long before inter-ownership developed and the like .
but if I was lucky , why I could get out and watch the <Saint>
did any of those players go on to fame and fortune in the big
oh , yes , they did indeed , a lot of them .
but one good thing about the schedule in those days was that on
Paul and Minneapolis always played each other and usually a double
I used to think that the <Saint> Paul Saints were my heroes
but I had a had habit of examining the box scores and cutting them
if you had to name one favorite player , who would that be , of all
well , in those days there was a pitcher for <Saint> Paul
I thought he was pretty good ; he didn't lose many games .
and if I could sneak in , why , I'd go see Charlie Hall play .
can we talk about your parents a little bit more ?
your mother and father together and then your mother alone after
they're obviously a great source of values for you .
what kind of values did they emphasize in the home ?
well , Mother was a distinctly moral person , there's no question
she had no patience whatsoever in immorality or things associated
there had been some alcoholism in her family , which was
but she had high moral standards ; she didn't preach at me but she
and yet she was a practical person .
I think I got more of that from Mother than I did from my Father .
he was a little tougher and particularly when he took an interest
he'd take me out , and I'd learn to shoot a little bit .
those days , I can't imagine what the people in his regiment or
now you mentioned that you were interested in being a doctor .
was that something that you announced openly as a boy or as a high
sure .
I talked a good bit about it .
did you have any role models in that regard ?
well , this close friend , John Briggs , who wanted to do it and
I have to include among them an ophthalmologist named Harry Binger
I remember one time , I met him on the street , I was just a kid
in response he took his off .
I never forgot that .
but there were others and I of course , the University of
I think they still do although there are some problems up there .
but it was a way of life that appealed to me .
it seems to me that history would want to know when was the first
oh , I can't answer that question , I really don't know .
one didn't talk about that in those days .
maybe it wasn't experienced except by back-alley coat hanger
we didn't hear much about those at that time .
although every now and then of course , there'd be a girl in high
and I'm sure , while I didn't understand it much at the time , I'm
and how about homosexuality ?
was that something that you were aware of ?
no .
I would say almost un untalked about in those days .
certainly not the way we didn't begin to accept the recognition
we've reached a point where if two men , both unmarried , get an
and that certainly wasn't the case in my day , up through college
people have tried to identify in your history some event or set of
do you think there were any such events ?
no , I don't think so .
I can't put my finger on any anyway .
I think it's pretty important and I thought the two cases that were
when you +/.
including Justice Brandeis and his co-authored article in <four>
+, right , “The Right to Privacy” .
“the Right to Privacy” .
getting back to where we were , you're heading across country now
how far east had you been before that experience ?
well , I had been to Chicago because I had an aunt who lived there
she had a <daughter> who was born the same day I
I was close to her and there , as I indicated , was the time , I'm
but I had never been east of Chicago until I went off to Harvard
and just to get this on the record again , although you're a member
well , I'll take the Fifth on this .
okay , well , we'll keep going .
when you first arrived in Harvard Square , you arrived by train ,
yes .
of course , from the Twin Cities we took probably either the
and then transferred and caught a Michigan Central train called the
I was going out there , I didn't have a place to live and was
the reason I didn't have a place to live was because my decision to
the term , we were due to be out there on the <twenty-first>
but on the way , on that train , I ran into two brothers from Los
the Brothers Grimm .
the Brothers Grimm .
and they were in the same boat , they had matriculated late , they
I think I had twenty bucks in my pocket , and they didn't have much
and the three of us for two days wandered around Cambridge and
I well remember a woman who had a house on Mt .
auburn Street , I think it was .
when we showed up at five o'clock she said , +"/.
+" well , where are you boys going to stay tonight ?
well , we didn't know .
and , well , +"/.
+" you can lie on the floor in my spare room , I don't have a bed
+" and so we stayed there for two nights .
+" that floor was pretty hard but it was a place to stay .
+" and then the sun rose all of a sudden and the brothers were
+" and so I had a place to live and that housing condition was
you were only sixteen at that time .
yes , going on seventeen .
I was seventeen in November .
now later when you described coming to the Supreme Court you said
did you feel that same way ?
oh , I certainly did .
I certainly did .
and in retrospect , probably I would have been well advised if I'd
have you given thought to what kind of career path you would've
what do you think would have happened ?
hmm +...
well , the same old problem between a good medical school there at
I might well have gone to medical school , been a poor doctor in
now , did you have any famous classmates , undergraduate classmates
+, well , one was Telford Taylor who distinguished himself in war
our class was not so famous as the one immediately before it , but
Carl Pforzheimer gave a magnificent gift to Harvard recently of
they've done all right .
who was in the predecessor class ?
oh , among others , Nathan Pusey , later president of Harvard
when you first got there , these roommates of yours , did they
no , they didn't become my best friends .
they were kind of a scattered lot .
most of them poor kids but from all over the country .
one of them became a pretty good friend .
he was from Duxbury , Massachusetts .
right , the one you saw Miles Standish's grave with .
and later to my surprise went to divinity school and ended up as an
and whereas in my our younger days , he wasn't particularly
were you yourself an active Methodist all during this period ?
no , not at all during those years .
actually , during my Harvard years I was distinctly inactive .
were you supposed to support yourself and immediately start to find
was that the plan , or what was your plan ?
that was my plan , and that twenty bucks I had didn't go very far ,
I would've preferred not to work that first year until I got my
but one of my , well , the Reverend Canon came in one afternoon and
+" harry , I've just acquired a job to drive a launch for the crew
+" why don't you go down and look ?
so I went down and lo and behold I got that job .
and the two of us drove coaching launches for the Harvard crews as
I did it for six years , and he was gone before then .
he didn't go on to graduate school , there anyway .
what exactly did that entail ?
well , it entailed being out on the river .
he drove the varsity coach , I drove the freshman coach .
and I'd get down about <one thirty> and get my launch in
and then we'd go out with crews on the Charles River , be out there
it was a great job because it got me out of doors for one thing ,
it was fifteen bucks a week , which was a fair amount of money .
I could eat on that .
it led to a lot of things .
I think in some respects my assignment at the freshman crew was
and I well remember Jimmy Roosevelt who was in the class behind me
what do you remember about his speech ?
well , it was a good speech .
of course , the Depression hadn't hit us in <twenty-nine>
I viewed him with some suspicion because he was out of New York ,
but he had that seeming arrogance with the cigarette and the long
you can recognize it anywhere .
but he was an impressive guy , there's no question about it .
now I've read that you had other jobs as a handball court painter ,
are all these accurate ?
well , I worked for the Harvard Athletic Association , particularly
of course in the wintertime we also got the launches out of the
but then I worked for the Athletic Association cleaning handball
when people played handball , they always spat in the corner , they
we did that .
and then as the years .
went by I was able to tutor in mathematics , and the more math I
what was his name ?
his name was Morse , Marston Morse .
group theory was his specialty as I recall .
far beyond my intellectual capacity to manage , but of course , I
enjoyed that .
oh , there were other kinds of jobs you pick up here and there .
anything that paid a little bit I latched on to .
I must have had about ten different jobs .
did you feel constantly pressed for money during that period ?
yes .
but we made it all right .
and of course in the summertime I was tempted to stay in the Boston
in those days , in the early days that I did it , I had horses .
but then I was there just at the time they converted from horses
but those old horses were great because they knew the route we
but that paid fairly well for a summer job , and I accumulated a
again it was good because it got me out of doors .
in those days , we peddled milk in bottles , not in packs the way
I remember one time we had a special stop in the excavation site
the Eighth Circuit Courthouse ?
that you later sat in ?
no , the County Courthouse .
and my boss at the Minnesota Milk Company said , +"/.
+" you go down , you get there at ten o'clock and run wherever you
so I went down there one time and I had four quart bottles in one
I still have scars in my fingers from that , and well , the workers
, there's always something funny like that .
I guess I'm interested in two kinds of relationships .
it sounds like there were the rich kids and the scholarship kids at
how did you feel about that kind of social structure ?
well , it certainly was true at Harvard .
I suppose it's true at Yale and some of the other Ivy League
I felt it at first and then I didn't bother too much with it .
but it was perfectly natural because youngsters that would go to
one of those schools fed largely into Harvard and the other one
but those of us who came out alone were pretty much alone and of
well , it's interesting , because when you later faced the question
did you think back on that experience in any way ?
did you see many African-Americans around or Jews or any +/.
well , there were a lot of Jewish kids around and not many
I tutored two of them in later mathematics years .
they were having a terrible struggle , but we got them through ,
that was interesting to tutor them because it taught me a lot of
+, the other kind of relationship I'm interested in is when you
well , they thought I was pretty stuffy I suppose .
I always called on those four men who'd been on the scholarship
at least I didn't flunk out .
of course the real problem arose when I graduated from law school ,
I don't know whether he would have fulfilled that promise or not ,
I liked Boston , I think most people do .
but my father was ill then as he had been for a number of years ,
had you stayed in Boston you probably would have become a partner
I don't know .
Boston firms are Boston firms , and I think they demand a certain
but as I interviewed in those firms , they were always polite ,
but that was at least I didn't find that to be true when I went
you come in here and do the work and the business will come .
and it was just as true as could be .
I'm interested in your feelings about the old boy network versus an
in some ways , you started as someone with no ties but through your
did you think about that much ?
I don't think much about it , and if I was conscious of it , I'm
one certainly is going to run into that in the Ivy League schools .
no question about it .
how conscious were you of women and the kinds of education they
women ?
yes .
well , we were conscious of it to some degree because Radcliffe is
but you went to classes with women ?
women showed up in our classes , not many , but as we moved along ,
and so there were young women who'd come and be with us , maybe we
so they were treated pretty much the same ?
they were what ?
they were treated pretty much the same .
oh , yes .
certainly at that time , my senior year , there was no problem
at what point did you decide to major in math ?
almost from the beginning ?
almost from the beginning .
after that session with Abbott Lawrence Lowell , I thought if I
but I felt that maybe I had reached my intellectual limits of
on the other hand , I had to write a , I took my honors in math , I
well , I came across it the other day and looked at it and I
it looked pretty impressive to me but +...
could you talk about your experience with the Harvard Glee Club ?
you've been the “musical person” on the Court as well and I know
+, it's an experience I'm very grateful for having had .
another friend of mine who was a far better singer than I was ,
and you were a baritone ?
baritone .
but then he went on and tried out for the Harvard Glee Club which
and I got cold feet because I really wasn't very good at all .
but I well remember when we had that quartet trial Doe was there
I was perspiring but , he passed me with the lowest possible grade
you had to have a <seventy> , and if you made a <seventy>
my friend I think had an <eighty-two> or something like this
but I stayed with them for six years , and it was a great , for me
I think the Harvard Glee Club at that time was , people will
and I remember the thrill of sitting in behind the Boston Symphony
and who was the conductor of the Boston Symphony ?
+, koussevitzky most of the time .
but there were others .
bauer came up and Stokowski and some of the others , it was a great
but of course it detracted in a way from law school .
some of my law school companions said , what are you putting all
but you could stay in through the graduate years , which I did .
and you did a fair amount of traveling , or at least you went to
well , the Glee Club traveled a good bit , not the full club , we
and that was the first time I got to Washington , in the spring of
president Hoover was in the White House at that time , and I think
did you take a general tour of the city that day ?
oh yes , sure , I well remember that , yes .
was this current Supreme Court building built at that point ?
no , because the current Supreme Court building came into being in
do you have any recollections of your feelings about Washington the
well , I thought it was a beautiful city and a place that would be
it was a much sleepier place then than it is now .
we liked it , it was warm .
this was April , Cherry Blossom time , all those things .
did you take any classes in American History or Government at
yes .
took Government I with “Frisky” Merriman parading with his long
do you remember when you started to focus between being a
when did you finally sort of resolve that question ?
well , I think I resolved not to go into mathematics about my first
I saw my then-roommate going on and getting , doing extraordinarily
he'd go on at great length and explain group theory or something
so I abandoned it , but I always had my sympathy toward the medical
how did you apply to the law school ?
did you apply to other law schools or just Harvard ?
no , just Harvard .
I thought a little bit about Minnesota at the time but it wasn't so
and during that time , the college years in particular , did you
were any of the Justices in your consciousness ?
well , only as a distant body down there in Washington that kind of
as an undergraduate , I didn't think too much of it , I suppose ,
I remember once seeing Oliver Wendell Holmes , <Junior> who
he was pretty feeble at the time , this must have been oh ,
more revered there I think than any other place that I know of .
you know Yale , I don't believe he's as revered At New Haven as he
but it was a thrill to see him at the time .
and of course , the Court at that time was pretty well controlled
I don't name them in order of seniority but they were voting pretty
did you have any kind of public recollection or reaction to the
sure , I think everyone was basically against it .
they thought this was another <F_D_R> trick .
you know , with Roosevelt , a great president but , he had his
one was either for him or against him .
a lot of the media was very critical of some of these ideas , and
if he couldn't accomplish his ends one way , he'd come up with an
stir people up , and on balance it was probably just as well .
they thought about these governmental problems and the like .
of course , when that thing was advanced , I think that the idea
he must have been very persuasive .
do you remember any cases coming down during this period that stuck
well , that series of cases invalidating the New Deal legislation
schechter Poultry , Carter Coal +...
+, yes , right .
the poultry case that you name being maybe the most prominent of
I think it shocked the country , shocked the bar generally and
these were hard times economically and Roosevelt was an attractive
+, did you vote for Roosevelt ?
sure , at one time .
I had lots of opportunities you know , he ran four times .
but you consider yourself a Republican .
oh , sure .
at that time .
not much of a one but , Republican , I guess .
when you would go home during the summers , how did your parents
well , I suppose they were .
I was never criticized for it .
my father never said a great deal .
mother talked a good bit about it and fortunately the grades were
they went out for graduation , and I think went out proudly .
well , you're always modest , Mister Justice , but you
were you one of the first in your class in all of these years or do
well , I certainly wasn't the first , very far up in my class , and
I was working too hard outside .
and I think my outside work affected my grades to a degree .
my majoring in math was fairly , successful , concentrating in math
I guess I won the sympathy of two or three of the math professors
but I did not make Phi Beta Kappa my junior year when they have
but I did do it in my senior year .
well , they had to because when I got the Summa , which was
but I know I was surprised when I was advised that I'd get a Summa
and I think it was due to my thesis , it was pretty good , worked
+, did it change your vision of yourself ?
someone who could get a Summa at Harvard as opposed to someone from
well , it made me feel , I guess , that four years of hard work at
I hope I wasn't smug about it .
I don't think I was .
did you consider taking any time off between college and law school
thought about it a little bit , so many people did .
it was the custom in those days to go to Europe or go around the
if you were well equipped and had a wealthy family that's what you
and so I have good friends who were classmates of mine in college
I've got to ask this question , Justice <Mrs> Blackmun
seriously date others ?
oh , sure , I think that , yes , the answer is yes .
have you kept in touch with these people ?
well , one in particular , sure , she was a nice person .
she died recently .
but not from Minnesota ?
no , she was an easterner .
that was one of the problems , I wondered how an easterner would do
so you were pretty confident that you would go back to the Midwest
after I went back to check up on my father and was lucky to get a
we're going to start the next tape by focusing on your Harvard Law
when you started Harvard Law School did you have a sense of
yes , I had that same feeling , distinctly .
and , of course , well , you've been through it , I don't know
although there was some of it .
but it seemed to me almost from the first day in law school this
I felt it anyway .
well , we'll start the next tape with a discussion of the beginning
thank you very much , Mister Justice
