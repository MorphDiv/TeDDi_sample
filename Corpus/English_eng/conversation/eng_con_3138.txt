++ xxx arranged ? 0_4151
or how are they put together ? 4151_7051
if you have nine two by twos what do you do with them to make it a
lay it out um (be)cause when you &~ha um have um the quilt together
okay &~i that's ways I put all of mine in a row like one two three
+< no no you put three on the top three in the middle and three on
okay so they're an arrangement of three rows of three two by two
Vanessa can you tell me something else about a finished quilt or do
I have another suggestion . 45000_48828
okay go ahead . 48828_49496
what word were you thinking ? 49496_50503
I was thinking evening star . 50503_52648
evening star . 52648_54500
tell me why that &~sh belongs in the quilt word bank . 54500_58775
(be)cause um <it's a quilt> it's a quilt it's a core square . 58775_66960
no . 66960_67895
okay it's a core square um actually it's not a core square . 67895_72696
it's a two by two . 72696_73415
it's a two by two design yeah . 73415_75215
it's a name for a quilt design right ? 75215_77498
and then the whole quilt could have that name too because each two
let's see I have a copy of that one here . 86138_88465
there's one right there . 88465_88998
oh wait I have the one that I did on my quilt folder in blue and
that's the evening star design . 91966_93670
um that looks like a star doesn't it ? 93670_98440
but is that one core square ? 98440_99813
no . 99813_100956
no it's +/. 100956_102000
no that's four . 102000_102850
it's four . 102850_103700
you kind of have to visually divide it like this into four parts
I xxx see how it goes . 110798_112231
It looks sort of um it it in each core square it has um uh uh
+< yeah that would be the can you tell me what the parts are
now this is a two by two design . 125711_127326
it gives the quilt it's name evening star . 127326_129846
can you take it apart with your eyes and tell me what the pieces
&=gasp . 137718_139503
+< okay Sara go ahead . 139503_140273
+^ and then you see if you can help her out . 140273_141786
+^ be looking and see if she gets all the pieces . 141786_143680
in the &~co in one corner you have um three blue triangles . 143680_149760
okay . 149760_150378
and three orange triangles . 150378_154631
uhhuh . 154631_155385
and one orange square . 155385_156736
okay does that is there anyone who is disagreeing . 156736_159250
listen to Sara's idea . 159250_160153
she's saying that to make one core square you would need three
you disagree Alex ? 172895_175265
I disagree . 175265_177448
okay what do you think it takes to make one core square of the
well you take two orange squares . 182571_195145
two orange squares . 195145_196465
two orange triangles . 196465_202148
two orange triangles . 202148_203765
another two orange squares . 203765_206938
okay so that would be now you have three orange squares ? 206938_209605
(be)cause didn't you say two orange squares two orange triangles
would that give me a total of three orange squares ? 216908_219930
um I think did you want me to do the whole thing ? 219930_223230
nope just a core square . 223230_224785
oh . 224785_226473
oh so just one fourth of this . 226473_229170
we're saying that this is a two by two design . 229170_232020
and it was made you have to kind of divide it in your mind it was
and Sara is saying that she thinks that one core square contains
is there anyone who Alex is going to take some more time to
Nicole you don't agree ? 259338_260656
or you do agree ? 260656_263075
I don't agree . 263075_264411
okay tell me what you think the core square for the design evening
this is this is tricky . 268281_275816
with your eyes you have to separate just one core square by itself .
+< three blue squares +. 279770_281290
three blue squares ? 281290_283550
++ and one square one orange square . 283550_301021
mhmm . 301021_301570
so if I have three blue squares and one orange square I can put
three blue triangles and one orange square one half and two
two halves of two orange triangles . 340763_343155
what I'm gonna to help you out here is I'm gonna
okay so you need to be on your knees in your seat for a minute . 355211_358500
if I divide it in half this way and then divide it here I'm showing
just one core square . 372921_374621
+< oh I mean half half of two triangles . 374621_377790
um I don't see any halves of triangles there . 377790_381443
+^ Nicole come show me where you're seeing those . 381443_383250
and then Sara we'll um I remember your suggestions and we'll test
this was a whole triangle . 394535_397908
well how was it made though ? 397908_400633
so what's the shape that xxx you're right this orange part of
+< triangle . 410575_410856
so Sara's idea that you could make the core using three orange
do you think she's right ? 418900_420278
yeah . 420278_421348
yep because what did we just find out ? 421348_423596
this design is a good example sometimes triangles go together to
squares . 428416_429553
squares yeah there's a place . 429553_431835
how many triangles went together to make that blue square in the
four . 434971_435250
four . 435250_436000
but this triangle here that &~s that Nicole was talking about the
+< four too . 444901_445305
two triangles . 445305_445903
two triangles . 445903_446536
two triangles . 446536_446976
two orange triangles . 446976_448571
two smaller ones . 448571_449705
and you could make the square out that big square out of two
well yeah but &~d when we're quilting do we use triangles that size ?
like in our zip bag are there any ? 461616_463340
&=shakes her head no . 463348_463576
no . 463576_463873
no so it would be four of this size triangles were in there but is
+< but the square xxx . 472095_472345
yeah yeah but if you were making it as a quilt you have to use four
and um no but the squares xxx on our quilting bags +/. 480606_486010
+< or and or and we'll only need two triangles to make a square . 486010_489896
right but would it make a square this size or would it make a
that size . 495885_496585
yeah . 496585_497003
yeah so quilts don't always have squares the same size . 497003_500390
+< we could have eight to make one of those squares . 500390_501938
this one ? 501938_502541
yeah because um because um when we had those pieces of paper with
which pieces of paper with the quilt squares just so I know what
um the ones in the plastic bags . 515950_518168
yeah so the squares and triangles you had in your zip bags yeah . 518168_522721
yeah um we um we only got to use two colors of triangles and um one
yep to fill up the whole core square but do you think this blue
or the same size ? 543391_546043
smaller . 546043_549810
yeah so do you think we could fit eight of those triangles to cover
well you could give them xxx . 553696_555481
I have my zip bag right well I thought I had my zip bag right here
Paul could I have your zip bag please that has your shapes in it ? 561583_564836
my zip bag just has core squares in it it doesn't have shapes . 564836_568033
