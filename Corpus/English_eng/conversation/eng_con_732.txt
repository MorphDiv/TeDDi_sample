&~www .
&-um I caught a frog yesterday and put it in a glass bottle .
my dog seemed to be really interested in it .
&-um I went to sleep early that night , as I was really tired .
the next morning I woke up and my frog had gone .
how had he escaped ?
I put my clothes on and went out to look for him .
my dog jumped out the window .
I hadta get out and get him .
&~www .
that's cool keep going .
&-um &-um we went down to woods to look for him .
where could he be ?
my dog seemed to be more interested in other things , while I
&-um the dog started getting chased by bees .
uhhuh .
I looked high and low for the frog .
but couldn't find him anywhere .
okay .
then I found a reindeer .
that's fine .
the reindeer pushed me into the pond .
I was soaking but didn't really mind it .
uhhuh .
I told my dog to be quiet , as I looked for the frog .
I'd found him and his friend .
