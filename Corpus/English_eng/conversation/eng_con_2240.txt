be(cause) if we make it flat, the back leg is going to have to go
<yeah> . 7049_7606
<that's> that's why I ask . 7606_9474
that's the only thing is like, the way our structure works, like
so +..? 17090_19319
I think we could keep the <v@l shape> . 19319_22384
<ah> , I think the v@l is fine &=clear:throat . 22384_24242
okay . 24242_24975
<um:> . 24975_27492
<the one> thing we definitely have to do though is lower the
we could do that . 30557_33994
I think we definitely should do that . 33994_36409
<cause the> . 36409_37338
<so> brooms if it's the long brooms we're talking about
<yeah> . 43932_44675
<yeah> . 44675_44801
<they're only like that long> . 44801_45883
<so if they're only gonna touch> the ground, or like barely
two inches off the ground, maybe ? 50805_52384
at most . 52384_53499
I don't know . 53499_56378
<we can almost> we can probably almost get it down to like an
something like that . 59815_60919
I don't think we need it that . 60919_62508
but I don't think <I don't, I don't think we need it quite that
<something like two or three inches three inches maybe> . 63623_65666
three inches off the ground would be good . 65666_67421
I think the lower the better, just because that means they'll be
<does that mean we> . 74954_76997
<and it also means there's> we want our prototype to work on
<lower the better> . 81548_83592
<how> +/. 83592_84242
only on flat . 84242_85171
yeah, that's true . 85171_87019
how're we gonna tackle flat surfaces then ? 87019_90465
hmm ? 90465_91672
what do you mean ? 91672_92323
or, not uneven surfaces, sorry . 92323_94737
well (be)cause <the tines aren't gonna be touching> . 94737_96316
<like how're we gonna try> . 96316_96595
it's gonna be <like> . 96595_99474
<yeah> . 99474_99845
a centimeter or two off the ground . 99845_101146
yeah . 101146_101610
the brushes, like, it could conform to the surface . 101610_105604
yeah, the brush will catch anything . 105604_107183
<that's uneven> . 107183_107647
<so it'll just have the brushes> . 107647_108390
a little bit bent . 108390_109691
well yeah, it's gonna bend back because of the grass . 109691_112106
it's gonna bend back naturally but make it like prebent though .
oh . 117121_117585
is what I'm saying . 117585_118143
like so if it were flat even ground it would be bent back already a
and then like <if it> if it's like a little bit of a hill
I think it'll just bend back because, uh, it's going against the
mmhmm . 133282_133839
<it's gotta be some sort of> . 133839_134582
<like, I'm assuming it's soft bristle> . 134582_137090
yeah . 137090_138019
(be)cause hard bristle is gonna damage the grass so <we shouldn't>
yeah . 141641_142013
wanna use that anyway . 142013_142663
yeah . 142663_143127
but like yeah, even if it's straight down in the beginning,
but hopefully it won't curve back too much &=laugh . 150836_155945
so we need to get some brushes or brooms or whatever . 155945_159010
yeah &=sigh . 159010_160124
we need to look into materials that we could use for that too . 160124_163003
what do you mean materials ? 163003_164397
well, you can get brooms with all kinds of different stuff . 164397_167469
I mean +/. 167469_167823
<you can get like> . 167823_168288
<different kinds of bristles you mean> ? 168288_169134
<yeah> . 169134_169505
<yeah> . 169505_169784
you can get like, horsehair brooms . 169784_171177
<you can get like> . 171177_172013
<right, right> . 172013_172199
fake horsehair . 172199_173406
well +... 173406_174056
<ah, you can get like> . 174056_174520
<let's go with the cheapest> well something that's stiff
&=laugh . 179907_181950
well I don't know what's out there I don't know . 181950_183065
&=laugh so, balanceful . 183065_185944
I have, I have a broom that's made out of basically just straw,
so +... 198762_199690
okay . 199690_204334
alright, <so> what are we asking tomorrow Steif . 204334_205913
<so> . 205913_207956
frame <rigidity> . 207956_210000
<rigidity> . 210000_210743
what time is he available ? 210743_211300
one thirty to three . 211300_211857
one thirty to three ? 211857_212879
so we're going <straight after our classes> ? 212879_214541
<straight after classes> ? 214541_215573
I have a little thing, so I'll be a l:ittle late . 215573_219195
so I was thinking one forty five . 219195_220867
&=laugh . 220867_221888
I im'dyou one forty five, right ? 221888_223932
how about +..? 223932_224768
I guess so . 224768_225325
we just go at twelve then . 225325_227276
how about +..? 227276_227730
or +/. 227730_227916
we go . 227916_228473
two <at two> . 228473_228937
<yeah> . 228937_229588
okay . 229588_230238
yeah, how about we go to Newell Simon . 230238_232178
okay . 232178_232931
get food . 232931_233581
yeah . 233581_234232
&=laugh . 234232_234686
and we meet you there at two or something . 234686_236275
okay . 236275_236739
so does that sound good ? 236739_238411
do you have a lunch break at any time &=laugh during the day ? 238411_243705
&=nod:yes . 243705_245553
alright . 245553_245832
<um> . 245832_248256
<so what are we asking him> ? 248256_248999
uh: frame &~rig frame rigidity ? 248999_253829
uh: frame longevity I dunno . 253829_258380
do you think shocks would be good ? 258380_260424
&=laugh . 260424_261352
&=laugh . 261352_262374
<well:> . 262374_262653
<well> those are the things we would have to ask him about . 262653_265532
we, we'll tell him we should estimate how much weight there's
okay . 274355_276399
and probably ask him about sheer of the bolts, at the bottom, where
and then the other thing is bending of the uh the frame . 284294_290052
as it's pulling the net ? 290052_293117
<as the it> as the ropes are pulling the s:ides forward and
yeah . 299340_299897
slight will it go like this eventually sometime . 299897_302776
&=crunch crunch or something like that . 302776_305842
(be)cause I mean we're already like this &=gesture . 305842_308349
like &=gesture . 308349_308999
it's going like that kind of . 308999_311507
well I dunno, maybe I dunno . 311507_315687
so . 315687_316058
cause the bag is attached all around the frame . 316058_318287
the thing is, do we really need . 318287_319216
<well I think> . 319216_319681
<to ask him about> all of those things ? 319681_321260
well . 321260_322467
like we should be able to do that ourselves . 322467_324232
right ? 324232_324511
that stuff we should, but like if there's &=laugh any uncertainty .
no, but he, he can give us advise, like +/. 327947_330920
like a good way to estimate it ? 330920_332220
ah But yeah, like a good way to estimate . 332220_333427
or <a> a better equation to use, or +/. 333427_335285
we should +/. 335285_335749
something . 335749_336307
wait, we can't estimate that now ? 336307_337607
how heavy is our thing ? 337607_339372
twenty, thirty pounds maybe ? 339372_342623
uh: I guestimated <guess and estimated> twenty . 342623_343738
<that's> . 343738_344666
okay twenty . 344666_345038
but . 345038_345595
that's something we should do too, we should figure out how heavy
but, like if we have the weight, we have three points . 349217_351818
assuming each point has the same load on it, if it's a flat
then we could take the one in the back, which is a straight down
so we should be able to find the sheer stresses on it . 371509_375224
or we should as him if that is completely correct, I dunno . 375224_378382
(be)ause the bag isn't, you know, attached at the center, it'
