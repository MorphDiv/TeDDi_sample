dash sixty four portion of a telephone conversation between the
hello . 36040_36220
Peterson on the line . 36680_37150
sir . 37380_37670
yes sir . 37940_38300
hope . 38320_38530
I didn't wake you up . 38630_39070
no not at all . 39750_40470
I &-uh wanted to tell you . 41720_42900
first I have apparently I've got the president of Rotary
could you make it one thirty . 48090_48940
yes sir . 49260_49450
that won't &-uh interfere with your lunch or anything . 49750_51580
oh fine . 51820_52440
second I met with Dean I got him in finally and &-uh heard his
and I said . 58030_59370
&-uh put him directly to him . 59500_61740
now . 61980_62150
&-uh when do you wanna resign . 62320_64379
and &-uh he said . 65340_66910
well I'll resigning him . 67030_67830
but he said . 67920_68190
I I would prefer to wait until I have testified . 68320_71980
now I want to ask your judgment on that . 72680_74100
<I can> I can bring him in in the morning and tell him . 74240_76380
look I want your resignation . 76400_78900
but &-uh do you <what what> what do you want me to do . 79060_81020
I don't want to interfere with your process . 81080_82300
Mr . 82660_82720
President I don't think that we ought_to to &-um . 82950_85100
tip our hand . 85380_85940
act . 86460_86630
yet he's the first one who's really come in . 86820_89300
oh I see . 90200_90390
so he came . 90570_91020
in a week ago . 91040_91840
Sunday right . 92180_92540
well let me say this . 93190_93790
the Maining Henry we must not have any question now on this . 94420_97660
you know I'm in charge of this thing you are . 97740_99390
and I am about everything else . 99440_100700
and I'm following it every inch of the way . 101180_102660
and I don't want any any question that &-uh fact that I'm way
you know what I mean . 109360_109750
I understand . 109960_110380
so &-uh if you think &-uh on Dean . 110910_113350
I think we ought_to hold the line . 114240_115420
alright . 115890_116060
and you'll let me know . 116220_116980
yes sir indeed as_soon_as &-uh as_soon_as &-uh then I'll call him
naturally you'll have to resign . 121360_122420
yes sir . 122620_122850
now Hallman Erlichman I have informed both of them the charges that
and &-uh I have said if they stand up . 129500_131230
&-uh and they of_course I didn't have to say it . 131980_133910
they said . 134020_134190
well of_course we will we'll have to <we we> we don't wanna be
they're good guys . 137280_138110
but my feeling with both of them is I mean it's only a question . 138820_143420
and we talked today <of of> of &-uh of when I mean when oh not
well you you've got to hear &-uh strong . 152480_154620
and I think you've gotta hear Dean and &-uh then I suppose you
overnight . 164640_164940
we'd like . 165030_165350
to wait . 165400_165620
we'd like to wait . 165830_166450
Mr . 166820_166880
president . 167120_167380
because like today you were suggesting that we should call (th)em
you see . 171260_171550
so I just wanted to be sure you didn't think I should do that as
well you know I that's really your judgment . 175870_179100
I think ultimately that's gonna have to be done . 179360_181060
yeah . 181470_181540
but what but your point is that as far as the case is concerned
is that the point . 187100_187400
I . 187600_188830
and and guess and on Ehrlichman Hallman &-uh &-uh I suppose
all the others items . 201980_202630
into a pattern . 202870_203460
how soon would that be that . 203860_205050
you &-uh for my own planning . 205120_206710
about a week . 206890_207220
I don't think it's gonna be less than a week . 207520_209180
and I would say two weeks or more . 209330_210580
oh you think it might be two weeks . 213070_213860
&-uh I would say . 214930_215590
so . 215770_215830
yes sir . 216120_216470
take . 216800_216900
that long . 216960_217270
mhm . 217320_217670
I'm afraid so because it well . 218090_219540
by that time my view is the damn thing will leak out . 219560_221770
and I &-uh well be that as_in may we'll see . 222100_225100
well that's conceivable why don't you . 225120_226270
and I talk about that tomorrow we will . 226320_227860
and &-uh &-uh we'll look over the Holman Mann thing to see &-uh
and &-uh maybe you could give me a little sheet of paper on both
&-uh &-uh their vulnerabilities are so that I can could you do that
try . 245740_245890
indeed yes sir . 245960_246400
I mean not I mean just say for these reasons et cetera . 246840_249820
and then I'll &-uh be in a position to to act on him . 250500_254450
very good . 254710_255100
you understand they will &-uh there's <any any> any problem
&-uh but the only thing I'm concerned about is in the prosecution
it may be that <if you> if you have them moved it may have a an
you're trying to get . 280320_280870
that's I I know what you're trying to get to testify . 281070_282780
I don't know . 282840_283150
but &-uh that's . 283200_283830
certainly true with Dean . 283920_284780
certainly true with Dean yes sir . 285220_286420
mhm . 286440_286670
&-uh of . 289570_290020
course he's he's in a mood to resign right now . 290600_292510
but they'll see . 292580_293180
we I'll check him tomorrow . 293260_294860
for you . 295530_295830
alright . 296050_296180
mhm . 296200_296500
mhm . 296770_296950
and erman . 297420_298270
then you say we'll talk about it . 298320_299460
tomorrow . 299560_299810
you want to think you want think about it . 299860_301260
I want think about it some more . 301560_302660
yes sir . 302860_303150
because I said we're gonna have to weave all of the facts with
it's not going to come out neat and clean and and &-uh surgical
(be)cause in both cases they have a basically in both of their
and with the possibility of all of of knowledge . 321360_323340
although that that's questionable .
but we you have hear strong before you decide that . 324560_327700
but that that's that's a matter that &-uh which &-uh is going
you're hearing them to what they know I suppose as_well_as we're
well I think that's right . 337160_337940
and I think with respect to the obstruction of justice . 338190_340230
&-uh thing is concerned . 340540_341750
it's it's easy for me to see how they fell into that if you
yeah . 346240_346340
rather_than being directly conspirators . 347260_349550
that's right . 350140_350660
that's . 351060_351340
right . 351480_351640
and there's a difference in that respect . 351660_353140
I suppose that's . 353200_353580
right . 353800_353890
and a difference at_least in moral culpability . 354020_355860
sure . 356250_356340
motives in in terms of ultimate embarrassment . 356760_358860
I think <the the> the . 358960_359860
embarrassment is there . 359880_360580
but in terms of basically in terms of of motive which might be
yes sir . 366740_366950
&-uh . 367260_367270
they might be off . 367820_368540
but in terms of embarrassment they'd have to be out_of the
yes sir . 370740_371070
I I get your point . 371580_372060
and and frankly &-uh either one of us is enough . 372600_374530
I understand that totally . 374720_375540
because that was what was involved in the Adams case as you recall
yes <he was> he was not legally guilty a damn thing . 380240_383390
well he <might've been> might've been I suppose making the
but but because_of the possibility we had to move on him by any
&-uh glad to get your view on it . 392830_394220
I but I wanted you to know having talked to Dean and told him to
I wanted to be sure you know that I had told him to wait . 398850_400780
because &-uh but no I I had agreed with him that I would not
&-uh I would not do it until I heard from him . 406460_408260
but let me say I'm gonna wait a hear from you then on Dean is that
fine . 411510_411650
yes . 411960_412320
sir . 412000_412340
and you'll probably hear him Monday or Tuesday tomorrow . 412620_415140
oh you don't know yet . 415680_416340
we don't know yet . 416660_417260
no it's not gonna be that quick because might have Aran . 417340_420820
and . 422420_422590
Mcbrien . 422830_423180
tomorrow . 424640_425440
tomorrow . 425120_425440
yep . 425680_425780
mhm . 426010_426340
what what_about Magruder it's . 427470_428780
Monday and Tuesday what . 429430_430340
about Magruder you have to get him in there someplace . 430390_432260
don't you . 432280_432630
well &-uh we've had him in . 432870_434980
and &-uh we have to get his testimony in before the grand jury . 435060_437660
and we're trying to work out with his whether or not you know he
he'll come in and plead guilty . 441210_442220
so you can . 442430_442870
(be)cause it seems to me that your idea <of of of> of getting
he said . 453240_453450
every very good one . 453590_454380
otherwise you know some they're gonna say they forced you to do it
and that's very important . 456860_457820
if you're gonna don't you agree those . 458130_459580
negotiations are negotiations on the way with his counsel now . 459600_462220
and obviously &-uh they're very much afraid of Sarika they're
oh we have to see Sir Rick too . 467900_469340
no . 470530_470620
Sir Rick's gotta see the point of this . 470700_471820
my goodness . 471900_472290
because the people the point is that Sir Rick's gotta realize he's
that's right . 476500_477020
yes sir . 477340_477660
right . 477980_478220
that's . 478500_478650
it exactly . 478760_479160
okay . 479830_480020
alright . 480750_480910
