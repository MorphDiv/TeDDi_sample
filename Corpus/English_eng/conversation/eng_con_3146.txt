what makes a turn different . 0_2168
+^ since this is your idea Alex you start us out by telling us what
okay +/. 5385_6551
+< um Dani please listen to Alex . 6551_7906
sorry Alex . 7906_9886
+< well we don't lift um core squares we sort of just like do this .
okay so when I'm turning a core square I don't lift it I just kind
do you ever get to see the back side of the core square if you only
no . 31848_32931
no . 32931_33300
no but if you flip you do &~ne you do see the back side of it and
+< but it looks just when when you just had the thing um like that
right it's the same color . 46910_48493
+< could I have +/. 48493_49918
and the same arrangement . 49918_50736
and it's the same arrangement . 50736_52221
+^ do you think that matters ? 52221_53275
yes . 53275_54876
no . 54876_55611
+< that they're the same colors and the same arrangement on the
yes . 57541_58260
they do they do . 58260_60195
what do ? 60195_61281
the Polydrons do xxx +/. 61281_63545
the Polydrons are the same color on both sides right . 63545_65863
but if you use paper you have to color both sides in . 65863_70475
oh why would I have to color both sides in ? 70475_73243
&~be &~be +/. 73243_74870
because on paper only one side is one color unless you have it like
okay here's a core square that's someone's actually it's Justin's
this is the core square we thought about last week when we were
if I wanted to use this to create um two by two designs or to plan
I could I could turn it either direction any amount that I wanted
no problem . 108320_108951
this would be a good tool to use when planning my quilt . 108951_111951
what if I wanted to test out how my two by two designs would look
it'd look white but on the other side . 119436_123390
that side has a little bit of grey on it . 123390_125218
xxx color . 125218_126188
I could color on it ? 126188_127601
no there's color . 127601_128823
there's color . 128823_129446
but if this is my core square and I start like this and I want to
it's xxx . 135206_136798
+< xxx . 136798_137065
it's white on the other side . 137065_140133
if you like have it like this and then you like um it'd be the same
so an up down flip looks the same as before you flip it ? 162875_165018
well um just if you have it like this on the back it would be the
well on the back it would be but how's it going to look when I flip
no it'd be it would be different it'd be just just plain white . 179178_185533
right but that's not true though . 185533_188168
if I flip this core square it's not plain white one side I have to
if this is the way I want it to go when I do an up down flip where
right there . 199793_201595
okay and you know what ? 201595_203898
you're right there it is . 203898_205435
but it's really hard for you to tell that when you have to keep
and you were right you predicted very well you thought if I do an
no . 225980_226858
no . 226858_227091
and what did Brittany what did you say would make a better tool if
if you have if you had the same thing on the back . 233730_236251
if I had the same thing on the back . 236251_237971
you mean just like this . 237971_240685
I have an extra right here Justin made me more than one of these
but it's not the same . 248895_250225
yes it is . 250225_251393
on the back it's not the same . 251393_253795
two core squares are they the same ? 253795_254898
the yellow's supposed to be +/. 254898_256890
+< but the yellow see it's on the left it's on the left um side . 256890_261486
+< so you mean if I made sure I was getting the colors to match
+< and the shapes . 267073_267323
and the shapes . 267323_268213
so here when I turn that down do you see that one behind it is a
+< yeah . 276593_276785
yes . 276785_277725
+< I rearranged them so that now they're like this . 277725_279613
so now could we use this as a tool to predict ? 279613_281981
yes . 281981_283283
okay if you look at my core square starting like this and I'm going
on the bottom . 291856_292825
I'm going to do a sideways flip . 292825_295276
well it would the yellow would be the yellow triangle would be on
so really a left and a right flip will get you the same thing and
so if I do a sideways flip Jillian is saying the yellow is going to
instead of being here on your right Jillian is saying the yellow
do you think she's right ? 324785_325710
sideways flip . 325710_327943
where's the yellow ? 327943_329706
where the blue triangle was . 329706_331908
right and it's on the left . 331908_333310
left . 333310_333765
when it began when it started it was on the right . 333765_335711
so here is where it was and then watch the sideways flip . 335711_338461
the yellow's where the blue was . 338461_340816
there it is yep and it was it was there . 340816_342871
now that's kind of awkward though trying to hold those because what
then am I really gonna know what an up down flip looks
no . 356150_356783
no . 356783_357443
+< no . 357443_357895
(be)cause you have to arrange it in a you have to arrange it xxx
+< so instead of using two of those a handy way of doing that is
that was those +/. 377240_378000
+< my quilt family . 378000_378876
yeah . 378876_379498
your quilt family . 379498_380680
and it has evening star on it too . 380680_383431
um does it ? 383431_385415
which one are you thinking of Sara ? 385415_387015
this one ? 387015_388231
yeah that one it's evening star . 388231_391871
+< yep good thinking . 391871_392168
okay so I began by designing a core square that I liked . 392168_395986
I used shapes from my bag I planned it out and I decided that was
Paul with your desk top open it's really hard for you to hear and
no . 412936_413300
no . 413300_414033
okay so I designed my core square with the paper shapes and laid
+< you colored both sides . 436466_436871
but did just take the paper and color one side and flip it over and
no . 442688_443205
no . 443205_443900
+< no I had to make sure that where it was yellow on the front it
there is no front and there is no back . 451971_454021
+< why did you see me going like this ? 454021_455243
so that you can see through . 455243_456940
so that so you can see um how the shapes are arranged and like if
yeah that wouldn't work would it (be)cause then it wouldn't really
what you guys are gonna do today is just that um after
once you get a core design that you like then you have to make not
how come I didn't stop when I did just one I mean that took me
+< you have to xxx . 521486_521813
+< you needed more of them to make a two by two design . 521813_525198
+^ you needed more and more to make a &~r a whole quilt (be)cause
+< right but I was only using these to plan not to to make a whole
four . 536425_537625
four . 537625_538150
(be)cause you only had four space to do four . 538150_540345
right well I could have taken more of those sheets though . 540345_543435
yeah . 543435_544171
why did I why was four enough for me ? 544171_546198
oh . 546198_546971
+< (be)cause that you were just planning out the two by two and
I was planning all the different two by two that could come from
+< that's cool I like that . 558881_559190
+< so do I . 559190_559491
so I made myself four of (th)em and then I rearranged them +/. 559491_563395
+< it's an evening star . 563395_564160
uhhuh that was one design that as I moved them around +/. 564160_568066
