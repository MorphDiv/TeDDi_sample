so, what I've got right here is a ten by ten grid . 5575_9995
and what I'd like you to do mentally is figure out without counting one by one, how many squares are in the colored in portion . 11895_22935
how many unit squares ? 26775_28075
and without talking, without counting one by one without writing . 28315_36095
wow . 38875_49915
lots of people have an idea . 50175_51415
would you talk to each other just about what you got ? 51795_54095
in the middle . 58195_58955
does that make sense ? 60595_61235
can I have please have your attention back ? 61835_63535
who has +... 65655_75195
by the way, do we all want to say the answer ? 76235_78835
well, what is it ? 79495_81375
thirty-six .
thirty-six squares . 82235_83595
good . 83735_83855
did anybody think it was maybe forty at first ? 83875_86375
okay . 86495_88395
did anyone think it was maybe thirty-eight first ? 88715_90635
few people . 90895_92215
okay . 92595_92655
so when you talked it over in your group, those would be who thought forty, what were you thinking ? 93375_97615
all right, S_one, what were you thinking ? 98395_101595
I was thinking that one side is ten and then there's four sides, and what's ten by four is forty . 101795_107595
okay . 108055_108215
how many were thinking just like S_one ? 108255_109595
all right . 110175_111335
what about the thirty-eight people ? 111345_112625
what were you thinking ? 112845_113405
S_two .
I was thinking about the top two are ten and so ten plus ten equals twenty, and then the other two were nine each; together they make eighteen . 114525_121665
ah . 121905_122205
xxx .
okay . 122305_123545
all right .
so now let's just see how some different methods +... 124005_127265
you know how we like to gather different methods so let's see some different methods for getting the thirty-six . 127405_131645
so let's see . 132365_134345
let's have S_three . 134565_135325
S_three, what's your method ? 135625_136525
well, first I started out with forty, from ten times four, and then I subtracted four from that because there would be four squares overlapping . 136985_145105
and so that got thirty-six . 146165_147505
raise your hand if you understand how S_three did it . 148185_150625
and the four was for ? 151505_156865
the four squares that overlapped . 157305_159105
okay . 159365_159625
and this four was for ? 159905_161325
four sides . 161645_162745
and this ten was for ? 162985_163985
ten squares on each side . 164735_166035
okay .
another way to do it ? 167335_168055
how I did it was I just put one side was obviously going to be ten; so it's ten, and then I did the bottom one and that was +... 169135_179915
can you go up and show us ? 180095_180895
I think that might help us . 181335_182635
should I use a pointer thing or just a pen ? 183235_185575
the pointer's in the top drawer, if you want use it . 186055_188535
top, right in the center . 188775_190135
here it is .
there it is . 192395_193015
all right, I found it . 193255_193895
anyway .
so I know this side's ten, so I just did ten . 194735_198255
and then this one's the overlapping one so then this would be nine . 199035_203675
then this one would be nine too because this one's overlapping . 204355_207755
and then for this one, it'd be eight because these two +... 208495_211835
this one was being used by this one, and this one was being used by that one . 212895_216435
S_four, I really like the way you showed visually what you did . 218585_221085
how many understood S_fou'sr method ? 221285_222645
wow . 223245_224285
great . 224525_224705
okay . 224925_225085
thank you . 225465_225805
how about a different method ? 225885_226725
wow . 226945_227205
there's a lot . 227345_227905
all right . 228385_228785
let's see . 229005_231125
it's hard to choose . 233425_234845
S_five .
I added the top +... 234985_239065
want to go up like S_four did ? 240025_243865
okay .
I know that this one, this is ten and so is that, so I added those two . 247705_252825
and at first I thought this was like nine right there so I thought about it for a while and that's eight . 253525_258405
and so I added those two and that's sixteen, then I added it to twenty . 258785_261765
so S_five, look at this and tell me if you think that represents what you did . 262085_268485
yeah . 269485_269885
okay . 270425_270725
and the ten and the ten stand for ? 270865_272585
this one and this row right here . 273455_275995
how many blocks in that row ? 276475_277535
xxx .
okay . 277815_279035
how many unit squares are in the top and how many are in the bottom ? 279255_281475
and then where'd you get the eight ? 281595_282575
this row, except it didn't have these two . 283615_288375
oh .
how many understand S_five's method ? 289235_291855
all right .
are there any other methods ? 292215_293995
oh, lots of people . 294515_295435
how many had S_five's method that they wanted to explain ? 295595_297995
a lot of people . 298175_298795
can anybody think of another way to do it . 298895_300495
S_six ?
okay . 304415_304655
so it's about xxx square is one hundred units because ten times ten . 304775_315335
there's +... 318195_318955
okay, that, and then there's eight . 319575_322435
there's eight, probably eight, that aren't shaded so that's sixty-four . 322975_332675
and you subtract sixty-four from one hundred . 332965_335885
and you got thirty-six ? 337105_337945
yeah . 337945_338125
what do you think of that method ? 338925_340065
okay . 340245_341385
so S_six though, help me though . 341705_343845
you got ten times ten first ? 344065_346025
yeah . 346165_346425
and then you subtracted eight times eight . 347945_353625
okay . 354405_356765
any other methods . 357185_358745
S_eight ?
you know the answer, then it would be hard for you ? 364275_366295
all right .
good point . 366795_367895
any other methods that you think you could do it ? 368455_370695
because there's one more method that came up in period one . 370775_373455
I forgot whose method was exactly . 374175_375815
S_seven's method .
S_seven ?
yeah . 376855_377295
I know S_seven . 377835_380775
all right . 380955_381255
here's what I'm going to do . 381355_382155
this is the backwards . 382195_382995
rather than having you guess what S_seven's method is, which doesn't make any sense at all, I'm going to show you S_seven's method . 383815_390195
you see if you can see why it makes sense with the picture . 390715_393135
okay ? 393675_393935
here's what S_seven did . 394295_395875
and S_eight, I'll call on you in a minute . 396055_397235
four times eight plus four . 403555_405675
why does that make sense with the picture ? 405835_407575
S_nine ?
why does that make sense with the picture ? 427395_428895
because there are four sides +... 429635_432595
you want to go up ? 432635_433215
no . 433615_433915
okay .
there are four sides . 436095_437295
okay, I'll go up . 438175_439595
okay . 440035_443455
there's four sides and there's +... 446315_450935
wait . 452595_453135
okay . 453295_453475
and there's eight right here, eight right here and eight right here . 453755_457515
yeah . 457915_457995
and that becomes four . 458215_459975
then it'd be plus four because one, two, three, four . 460535_463215
yeah . 463595_463895
anybody want to comment to her ? 464595_470155
see if you agree with her ? 470235_471355
S_ten, you call on someone . 472095_473755
oh, S_one . 473955_474635
okay . 476015_476295
for the one side, if you said that they were eight there, so you have two left over in the corner . 477515_483195
and then if you put eight on each other's side, there'd be one in each of the three corners, or the two corners, two other corners . 483915_490335
so, well basically if do eight times four, (be)cause you're going to have four left, that's why you add xxx . 491275_495155
is that same thing you were saying ? 495455_498395
yeah . 498735_499335
what I was trying to say . 499515_500555
I thought you said it very well . 500895_502155
just show us again where the eight's coming from though, S_ten . 502395_504615
well, this comes from eight right here . 504805_509065
so this whole side length, but what's the part that you're leaving out ? 509605_512965
the corners .
all the corners . 514145_515965
okay .
just a second .
okay, so S_eleven wanted to comment on S_seven's method . 516345_530145
S_seven's method . 530345_531325
I think it's pretty much the same as S_eight's xxx eight times four and not nine times four . 531685_537665
what's the difference ? 538185_539005
I really like the fact that S_eleven is connecting two methods to each other . 539425_542685
how is S_eight and S_seven's method alike and how are they different ? 543325_546445
say it again then S_eleven, and then I'll call somebody else . 547125_549305
well, I think it's pretty much the same . 549345_551305
well S_seven's method is four times eight, I think pretty much, plus four . 551785_555565
pretty much the same as S_eight's method; nine times four . 555925_559225
all right .
and any other comments about the two methods ? 561365_563265
S_twelve ?
well, the only thing S_eight did was she, well, because four times eight plus four is the exact same thing as nine times four only you're saying instead of having the nine for +... 563485_580445
I don't know how to say it . 581145_584565
I'm distracted by your hand being up right now . 587405_589865
please listen to S_twelve . 590005_590965
okay . 592445_592725
instead of having the nine, four being multiplied with the other eight fours, times four, he added it after being multiplied four xxx . 594245_605165
so S_twelve's thinking about this numerically . 605525_608385
she knows that these two are equal and she's saying what the person did first or second . 608965_616285
so another way I'd like you to think about is what's S_seven doing that S_eight's not doing ? 616905_623465
and what's S_eight doing and S_seven's not doing ? 623645_625385
how would those look in the picture ? 625465_626965
so S_thirteen, go ahead . 628665_629745
well, I think what I was saying before, he just took the corner away . 629925_634645
and he took the corners away, I would've left . 635085_637085
okay, stop for just a second . 637825_638845
so S_seven took both of the corners off . 639085_640945
all four of the corners off and I've left and S_eight, she didn't take any . 641025_645885
she just kept the corners there but she counted the sides minus one corner for each side . 646045_651085
yeah . 651145_651285
we have S_eight here to defend herself . 651345_652745
is that right, S_eight ? 652785_653365
yeah . 653905_655805
kind of right . 656645_657445
all right . 657665_658465
I'm going to +... 658565_658865
oh boy . 659025_659465
S_three .
I think my method is also kind of like S_eight's and S_seven's because, well, I was counting the sides and then I subtracted four, but she didn't count the sides and then added four . 661465_673165
ah, okay . 673325_674425
other comments about how those methods are alike and different . 675105_677905
let's see . 678545_679765
here's what I'm going to ask you to do . 680225_681305
I'm going to turn that off and I want you to visualize a square in your mind and use whatever method you want . 681345_686825
do I want you to use whatever method you want ? 687485_689125
yeah . 689775_689975
I want you to use whatever methods you want, but I want you to shrink the square in your mind down to a six by six and then use one of those methods . 690215_700495
but instead of there being ten unit squares on one side, now there are six . 702315_706495
use one of those methods and see what you think the total number squares +... 707375_711315
and let's keep our hands down . 711675_713215
it's kind of intimidating to have people that think so fast . 713575_717075
six by six . 723145_724185
okay . 725425_734105
now let's just say that I don't care about how many there are . 734465_737705
let's say that what I care about is how people would do it . 738745_741645
so what I want to know is, and not S_three but someone else, if the big square was a six by six, what would S_three have done to get total number of unit squares in the border ? 743145_755145
