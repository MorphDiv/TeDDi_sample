it was about a policeman and a old friend .
at the time the policeman was on duty checking out the neighborhood
he ran into a guy that was lighting a cigar .
and that was waiting for someone with certain features in the face .
and he was holding a cigar .
and he told him something about who he was waiting for .
anyway the policeman evidently knew who he was but couldn't arrest
so he told him he was waiting for somebody he hadn't seen in twenty
somebody named Jimmy_Wells or something .
so as the guy was waiting there he told a friend of his to arrest
and when his old friend saw him they talked .
but he noticed that he wasn't the guy he thought he was .
and the guy arrested him .
and after he arrested him he gave him a note and told him that he
he was a hardened criminal that was wanted by the law .
he couldn't find it in his heart to arrest him .
so he got one of his boys in plain clothes to do it for him .
I remember me Ron Henry and I think it was one or two other children
and they turned us out because the pool was closed .
so as young children +...
we had to be be somewhere around eight or eleven .
I think we could have been thirteen .
anyway, we went to the Anacostia .
and of_course they said +"/.
+" you go first .
you_know I was like just one of those who went first .
but anyway I stepped into the Anacostia river .
and I stepped .
and I stepped .
and I stepped .
then I took another step .
and I went straight down .
and by the will and the grace of god I didn't get snagged on
and I came back up .
and I came out of there .
but I never forgot it .
because that year a_lot_of children died trying to swim in the
and it taught me a great lesson .
one that I didn't adhere to as much as I should have .
but it should have taught me patience .
now that I think about it it does .
