&~www .
yesterday I found a frog .
I put the frog in a jar to keep it safe .
my dog was very interested in this frog .
when I went to bed last night the frog got out the jar .
I woke up to find it had gone .
the dog put his head in the jar and got it stuck .
I quickly got dressed to look out the window to see if I could see
the dog jumped out the window .
I soon followed and told it it was naughty .
I went down the road and called the frog and looked in the woods .
but I could not find the frog anywhere .
I looked down a mole hole where there was a mole , but no frog .
I found a beehive and a tree , but still no frog .
I found an owl .
it made me jump , but still no frog .
then my dog saw something .
it went running down the road .
I found a stone and looked behind it , but no frog .
the a deer come around the corner .
and I got on its head .
and it chucked me off the side of a sort of cliff .
I fell into a pond .
I climbed up onto a log , followed by my dog .
and behind a log was two frogs .
I picked the frog up and saw a few more and went home again .
