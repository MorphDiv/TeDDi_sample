okay well just to &-um reiterate last time we agreed that we'd push back the paper due dates from this Wednesday to the Monday after break so that's Monday &-um March eighth due in class &-um and are there any questions about those the papers ?
<the next> papers that are due ?
they're gonna be a little bit longer than the ones from last time and I &~w I want to reiterate that I'm I'm glad to meet with people if you want to come to my office hours today after class or this week .
so I'm happy to make appointments .
&-um and I wanna thank you guys for filling out the survey it was really very helpful .
&-um a_couple_of things came out_of it &-um one was that pretty much everybody was in favor of doing more small groups .
&-um <that was> that was very popular .
so I'm gonna try and make sure that we do some of that at least once every time in in class .
and I think that's +//.
you know it's something I've been noticing too it's hard to get people to participate when we're all in a big group .
&-um and I as I said at the beginning of class a_couple_of people mentioned that it it might be easier to to speak up in the whole class setting if we actually &~m moved closer together .
I was just wondering if &-um if people thought that was a good idea we have some definite nos@n .
how about a how about a show of hands &-um how many people would be against moving yeah closer up to the front ?
couple &~a any people and how many +//.
you wanna wanna try that again ?
&=laughs like three +/.
nos@n +/.
+, nos@n yeah .
+, everybody in the class +/.
+, &=laughs:multiple okay what about yeses@n ?
+, nos@n xxx +/.
+, I know there are some yeses@n out there .
you don't hafta be shy .
&=laughs okay well we have looks like we have sort_of a &-um a sticking point .
people who want to say yes aren't aren't &-uh speaking out in favor of it .
so we're gonna stay in this format <for the> for the time being .
&-uh I might try and force you a little bit later on .
&-um &-uh another another thing that came out is a_lot_of people have said they appreciated having a summary of the lecture &-uh at the &~begi of the readings at the beginning of of class and so I'm gonna be trying to do some more of that make sure that we go over the structure of the readings for you .
&-um and also maybe I should emphasize you should try and interrupt me if you're &~i during the lecture <if you're> if you're &-um if there're some points of unclarity just jump in &~an and you know yell and let me know .
&-um other other points &-um as for the readings there was a_lot_of variation .
there were some people &~f speaking out in favor of just about everything .
&-um some people wanted less of the historical stuff and more modern stuff and some people wanted the reverse but overall there was a pretty good spread for &-uh what people liked in the readings .
so &-um &-um and homework most people seemed to &~s think that it was helping a bit .
so I &~th we'll keep on with that .
&-um we might try and tone down the the number of questions for later on .
so but if you have more suggestions later on please do get back to me okay ?
okay &-um I wanted to start out with just outlining what the Dennett reading was the structure of the Dennett reading for you and then we're gonna break &~u break down into small groups and discuss it in the second half of the class .
so (0.18) so Dennett the reason I was giving you this <this particular> &-um this particular reading now is it gives us a way of summing up some of the issues that we've been talking about in the past few weeks .
&-um issues about &-um &=writes:board &=writing:board under the heading of the unity of consciousness .
&=writing:board so &-uh on the unity of consciousness readings we were talking about Descartes Hume and Nagel &-um this also brings together a question about who I am through time +...
or over time &=writing:board which we've been discussing under the rubric of personal identity .
and they're &-uh the the people that we've been looking at are Nagel &-uh sorry Perry (0.6) Perry Williams and &-um &-um Parfit .
right +...
and both of these are &=trips_over_cord whoops excuse_me +/.
+, sorry +/.
+, &-uh both of these are being picked up by &-um both of these things are being picked up by Dennett who's asking the question who am I ?
and he's he's &~uni he's talking both about who you are at a particular time and who you are through time in his examples .
and just to give us a just to remind you the various kinds of theory that we've been looking at here both for the unity of consciousness and personal identity have some similar themes .
&-um similar sorts of theories have been proposed .
so some people have thought that we &~a what explains who you are what makes you the particular individual that you are at a particular time is that you have a distinctive immaterial soul which unifies your consciousness all your conscious experiences at a time and makes you the very person you are from the &~m moment that you are born to the moment that you cease to exist .
there's a body theory and a brain theory .
what makes you the very person that you are is that you have this particular ongoing body that continues from &~you from your birth until your death or this particular brain .
&-um and that might explain and particularly the brain might explain the unity of your consciousness at a particular time what makes all of your &~f thoughts and feelings belong to one particular person .
and finally &-um there's in each of these each of these themes where we looked at one thinker who was thinking that claiming that what unifies your consciousness in at a time and through time is not any of these particular items these particular objects that that last through time but rather the connections among your thoughts and feelings .
so &-um basically &=writing:board the final point the final theory that we've been looking at is that you what makes you the very person that you are is a particular point of view that is integrates various of your thoughts and &~theor feelings with each_other .
so for instance you remember Nagel that was his view about what makes you the very +//.
one person at a particular time is that your thoughts and feelings are integrated in a particular way .
they can be more or less integrated they could be more or less in communication with each_other but &-um <what makes> what makes for your personal identity at a particular time is just the relations among your thoughts and feelings .
and similarly Derek Parfit argued that through time there's no hard and fast yes or no fact about you who you are it's who you are depends on how well integrated your thoughts and feelings are over time .
the more psychological connections you have with a past or future person the more that +//.
the more you're you are quote unquote identical with that person or you're more the the more you are a survivor of that person .
but there's no hard and fast yes or no answer to the question of is that person you ?
if the in the past or the future .
so Nagel and Parfit are both taking a similar sort_of line on this .
and in fact Dennett is very sympathetic to that line in &-um what he does though is he he starts by giving us this &-um thought experiment .
well science fiction .
he says he tells us a story where he is he has been &-uh recruited by NASA for this supersonic tunnelling underground device test .
right ?
this +...
STUD is his acronym .
&-um and &~h what he's supposed to do is &~h he's supposed to participate in this experiment where he donates <his brain> his brain is separated from his body and then his body goes on this this mission to dismantle a missile underground .
right ?
&-um and so &=writing:board so our first the first thought experiment is where he asks us he tells us a story where his brain and his body are separated .
and we're supposed to ask okay where are you ?
where where is Dennett located ?
once his brain and his body are in separate locations where is Dennett ?
and this gives us a way a &~n a new way in to trying to decide among these various theories of personal identity .
&=writing:board sorry excuse_me +/.
+, sorry +/.
+, there's no +/.
+, ⌈ other &-um outlet &-um ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ no maybe if we let it ⌋ if we push it over this way yeah +/.
+, there we go .
+, &-um and the second stage of the of the experiment is he he loses contact with his body .
&=writing:board I'm actually in Houston right ?
I'm it he thinks he's in the +//.
at that point he no longer identifies with where he is at the &~i where his body is which is underground working on this missile .
but he identifies with &~hi with his brain back in Houston in this little &-um metallic tub full of electrodes .
and so at that point he's he's &-um he comes up with a &~n a new kind of view about where he is which influences should influence his view about who he is .
what kind_of a thing he is .
&-um finally &=writing:board and he gets at the same time a spare computer brain .
&=laughs okay and then and at the very end the brain &~in the two sort_of brains that are controlling this body become +//.
go out_of sync and &-um so it looks like &~w at that point he's got two brains and one body .
&=pause_while_writing to &-um and in each stage we're asked well where is he ?
where is Dennett ?
and he's trying to he's trying to &-uh pump our intuitions in this way get us thinking about this case from a new angle .
this question about where am I located is supposed to <help us> help us come to some sort of decision about what kind of thing Dennett is that individual thing .
&-um and he proposes a number of different solutions to this .
and this what I'd like to to discuss in small groups about how plausible each of these solutions is .
okay so around about page two twenty he says maybe <he is> he is located wherever his brain is located &-um +/.
+, huh ?
+, no no wherever his body is located .
his body he calls his body Hamlet and his brain Yorick .
&=laughs &-um so he says okay maybe I am where my body is .
in that case my body is me +...
&=writes:board and then he thinks well maybe maybe it's &~th it's the opposite maybe it's not my body that's me because &~f you know after all couldn't I get a body transplant .
&-um so maybe my +//.
and then he says suggests second suggestion's maybe my brain is me +...
wherever my brain is there am I .
but he finds this hard to believe because as he's sitting there you know he's got his brain in <in a> in a vat and his his body is walking all over and he thinks well I can't be where my brain is .
you put my brain in prison and I don't care .
I seem to be you you know it seems obvious that where I am is the place where I see feel hear touch talk you know where my body is .
so he's not very satisfied with the second solution either .
a third solution is &=writing:board I am wherever my point of view is .
that is wherever it seems to me that I &~s wherever seems like here to me is where I am .
so &-um if it seems to you that you're walking around the labs at Houston and it doesn't seem to you that you're in this tank of nutrients floating in a tank of &~r nutrients and that's the way it seems to Dennett when his brain is separated from his body .
well then it's just in virtue of the fact that it seems to you that you're walking around that that you are walking around you're located where it seems to you that you're located .
&-um he's not very satisfied with that one either .
&-um he's a little bit worried about it partly because he thinks well can't I be wrong about where I am ?
can't it be can't I make mistakes about this ?
and you could think about he mentions these illusions that you can have with &-um you know simulated mechanical arms and so on .
where you actually feel the tension <of the> &-um of the the resistance of the object you're trying to move and <you can> &~s you can feel the &-um &-um the drag and pull of of the mechanical devices that you're manipulating and you project yourself into the mechanical device .
but he says that would be just a seeming .
even if you identified fully with this mechanical these mechanical arms if you are in a body you know sitting on say a boat and you're manipulating mechanical arms undersea under the <in a> in a device that's crawling on the ocean floor it seems right to say that it may seem to you that you are that you're down on the ocean floor .
but in fact you really are up <on the> on the boat manipulating these things .
so he's worried that the wherever the view that your point of view is where you are must be wrong because you can be wrong about &-um you can have these illusions about where you are .
&-um so then around &-uh page two twenty one he comes up with a new idea .
this is as his &~b body is flying off to to go recover the &~m the missile .
he says okay .
I'm getting used to this now it's not such a great conundrum I don't hafta choose between the location of my body and the location of my brain .
I can just think of myself as composed of both body and brain .
so I'm you know part of me is in Houston .
and part of me is +//.
where was he flying off to Phoenix ?
someplace else .
so &~y and I'm in both places .
I'm partly in one place and partly in the other place .
so &=pause_while_writing so on this view I don't hafta choose .
I'm composed of both my body and my brain +...
it's like &-uh a great big scattered device .
we can we're familiar with various &-um machines that can be located in different places .
you have a power plant and &-um it might be connected up with some other power generating source and both of them together constitute the power generating machine .
or you can think of a one of those little &~s tiny sailboats that it's controlled by a remote control &-uh operator .
well the the device you know the sail the mechanical sailboat is located both in the hand of the person who's manipulating it and partly on &~th on the &~l &-um the pond where the sailboat is being &-uh driven around .
the device is in you know it's a scattered device it's in two places .
similarly he thinks okay I'm both brain and body .
so I don't hafta choose +...
but he's &~no he's fails to be satisfied with that after his body goes on the Fritz .
so around page two twenty four he says his his body starts losing contact with his brain .
and you know one by one the connections are severed .
and he's gets this feeling of complete panic and &-um and disorientation .
and he's thinks he's about to die .
and then he realizes +"/.
+" wait a second I'm not in Phoenix at all .
+" I'm back in Houston .
I am my brain in this little hermetic vat .
&-um that's where I'm located .
and then he he's not actually reverting to the brain theory at that point .
he thinks he's &=writing:board made a big philosophical discovery .
he thinks that he's his idea is that somehow he is a kind of immaterial soul .
but he's got a very special understanding of this soul .
he calls it &-um his &~s &-uh center of gravity .
&=writing:board and &~w what he seems to mean by that is that &~h &~h and he wants to espouse purely physicalistic principles here but so he thinks that he's located where one of his physical parts is .
remember Descartes who is who had a an immaterial conception of the soul thought that &-um souls didn't hafta be located anywhere in space +...
Dennett this lemme put this in sort_of quotation marks .
Dennett's idea of a soul is different .
he thinks of it as something like a point of view .
but not the kind of point of view that he he he mentioned &~a at the beginning at number three here his idea &~o of a center of gravity is like a point of view but you can be wrong about it .
so he thinks right after after his disconnections after his body starts getting disconnected from his brain he's still thinking that he's in Houston I mean no he's still thinking that he's in Phoenix underground .
but then he +//.
it occurs to him that he's wrong about that and he corrects himself .
he says no wait I can't be in Phoenix underground .
that body +//.
I don't have any sort_of &-um connection with that body anymore .
he remembers that his brain is back in Houston and then he sort_of &~i reidentifies himself with the brain .
he starts thinking okay I must be that brain .
and it's not just it's not just that he was that brain when he thinks it .
so as soon as the thought occurs to him oh I must be the brain I must be where the brain is that that sort of switches his location .
his idea is no as soon as the connections start being severed between the body and the brain he should have been locating himself and identifying with himself when as the brain in Houston .
so the center of gravity looks like something like a corrected point of view .
&=writing:board so it's like three except it's corrected for these possible errors that you can make about where you <identify yourself> &~w identify yourself .
so each of these options that he lays out presents one way of reacting to the brain and body separate brain and body scenario .
and what I'd like to do &-um is to break down into smaller groups and see if we can think of see if you can decide whether +//.
what you think of each of these scenarios which one is the most plausible .
for each one you get to a a different decision about where you are if you're Dennett .
the first one locates you with the with your body the second one locates you wherever your brain is the third one locates where you wherever you currently think you are the fourth one says that you are anyplace where any part of you is .
so if you're composed of two parts a body and a brain you're both places .
and the fifth one has locates you wherever your point of view should be .
and it's a little bit mysterious how exactly we're supposed to decide where your point of view should be .
but he thinks he has an answer in this kind of in this case .
so what I'd like to do now is do our habitual thing is to break down into groups of four or five at each of the corners and &-um discuss this .
before we go on to talking about the cases at the end which sort_of complicated matters where he's got +//.
because in those cases Dennett gets this extra body extra this new body with this extra spare brain .
but in those cases too we're gonna hafta we're gonna hafta take a look at these sorts of theories and figure out which one does best justice to that kind of case .
okay you wanna break down ?
&=noise_and_unintelligible_speech .
&-um <why don't> why don't you two groups break into two separate ones ?
alright we got our ⌈ four right here ⌉ .
⌊ just split ⌋ in the middle there .
&=simultaneous_small_group_discussions_follow xxx &=begin_first_group'S_DISCUSSION .
I thought this was <the best> the best reading .
yeah it is yeah .

it's xxx .
it's because it gave so many different things to think about instead of ⌈ <kind of you know> ⌉ .
⌊ I &~h it ⌋ was more like lifelike .

I agreed with him .
which one of those do you think ⌈ it is ⌉ ?
⌊ all five ⌋ but the fifth one <I think he> &~d I think he disproves all the others .
xxx .
the first one .
yeah I I don't agree with the ⌈ first two ⌉ .

yeah yeah .
the first one with the body thing you know I mean I think all the other people who've looked at it have kind of +/.
yeah +/.
+, disputed that maybe (be)cause the body's there and then like it loses attachment from the brain it's just gonna sit there so +/.
+, right +/.
+, that kind of proves xxx then the brain .
that was the one we always talk about was kinda like you need the brain and the &~bo like they work together .
uhuh at least without the body the brain's not gonna do very much either .
so .
yeah .
yeah &~i it won't do anything .
I don't know the last three +/.
yeah they all sorta +/.
+, I can't +//.
like they all seem somewhat &~plaus like you could work with that you could work with (th)em .
see the point of view one I think is good except for +/.
yeah +/.

you know that's basically ⌈ <is that> is that <all he said to> xxx ⌉ .
⌊ yeah like <I don't> I don't get like ⌋ between like three and five I don't <agree with> that .

&=laughs (0.11) .
I mean I I think you could ⌈ modify four and say ⌉ .
⌊ see the tough thing &~i the ⌋ tough thing is &-um like physically doesn't a brain only work if it's gonna have a body with it ?
not in the story .
right but &~i no I'm wondering like in real life like do you need a body for the brain to work ?
like will there still be like electrical transmissions or whatever going on ?
well there's no there would be no blood .

(be)cause I don't think even like with his movie theater example I mean yeah you xxx you +//.

like I &~st I think it &~r it's kinda hard to &~t draw the line between three and five .
+, yeah .

yeah I wish I knew more about the distinction between the two .
&=laughs like really .
how much time do we <have left> ?

(be)cause like <I don't know> no one's gonna be like <we're moving this stuff &~ar> you know ⌊ what I mean ⌋ ?
⌈ yeah ⌉ .
I guess I don't have enough experience ⌊ in the robotics field ⌋ .
⌈ I know yeah ⌉ .
maybe if you're doing it for like five hours in a row by the end you're just like .
one with the machine .
&=laughs:S3 so what we say the three or five ?
yeah it's &~re it's hard to tell I think between three and five .
mhm .
I don't understand like at the end when he like he woke up out_of the coma and he was &~li and .
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
⌈ the other ⌉ brain .

⌈ like ⌉ +/.

in another xxx .
it was like there were the two &~b (be)cause remember it was like you could &~s <he had> the two brains and you could switch back and forth between the two of (th)em +/.
right +/.
+, and he never knew which one was like his real brain and which one was the other one .

⌈ where ⌉ yeah where they where they ended up splitting kinda the two brains like ⌊ so <that it was like> xxx each_other ⌋ +/.

⌈ randomly ⌉ it like would randomly ⌊ kinda &~switch ⌋ .

⌈ &-uh huh they weren't marked it was this brain or this brain ⌉ .

⌊ &-uh huh ⌋ it kinda seemed like like one of the brains was telling the story .

+, but the one that was telling ⌈ everything ⌉ .
⌊ (be)cause then ⌋ remember the one at the end was like I know that you're in there and .
&-uh huh .
and the second one was thinking it's it's like I'm trapped and I wanna get out .

but did the first one know that they were different ?
the first ⌈ no ⌉ .

⌈ right I don't think he did ⌉ .
⌊ yeah (be)cause like the last ⌋ I think that like the &~chan the split happened since the last time he changed ⌈ the brain xxx ⌉ +/.
⌊ yeah it did ⌋ and then he switched it and then but then the new brain still had which was weird still had knowledge of the other brain .

I like that they call that STUD .
&=laughs yeah I was like where is he throwing this in from ?
(0.4) .

where do these people ⌈ come up with this stuff ⌉ ?
⌊ I know I was just ⌋ thinking that .
⌈ who ⌉ +/.

⌊ I think they &~co ⌋ try to come up with like they know they wanna split you somehow .

+, a week just trying to ⌈ come up with a situation ⌉ .
⌊ yeah and then &~an then ⌋ it flows from there .
&=laughs .
I think he has too much time on his hands .
it's interesting +...
that's that's weird just to like think about that remote controlled body ⌈ basically ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
it seems &~s so like possible in the future .
because everything &~i is basically like electrical impulses that take radio signals or whatever .
everyone could just have +/.

it's like stretching like the nerves like +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ a little bit ⌋ why can't you just do it <one more time> whenever they do anything like little by little it makes it so much more believable .
like for any of the things that we've read .
(0.4) everyone can just leave their brain at home and go about their daily business .
(0.7) .
I think making the computer program brain that was a pretty big jump from what they already did .
yeah that was (0.13) that just creates too many problems +/.
yeah +/.
+, to deal with .
(0.15) .
the only thing that could argue with like about trying to be would be like dreaming .
think about dreams .
are you actually ⌈ there then ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ like in a dream ⌋ like you're not gonna be like I'm really xxx but you're not &~ac obviously actually there .
(0.8) .
xxx .
yeah I don't know .
(be)cause like when you're dreaming obviously you're not <thinking of> yourself as lying <in bed> you know ?
(0.5) .
well isn't that like the difference between three and five ?
yeah <I think it> I think it is .
good call .
I think that's (0.6) so five we're going with five ?
I wanna know more about three five <I don't know about> the other two .
how you guys doing ?
pretty ⌈ good ⌉ +/.
+, yeah we're .
we need more distinction between three and ⌈ five ⌉ .
⌊ three and five ⌋ we're having trouble with .
ah yeah .
I think &~thr the difference between three and five is kind_of difficult .
I mean his &~i his idea though is that in &-um where your point of view three is you are wherever you think you are .
so if you think you're you know down the tunnel that's exactly where you are .
like she said &-uh what if you're dreaming ?
ah +/.
+, are you actually in the dream then ?
you're aware +//.
I think <that's a> that's a very good worry about the xxx for for three (be)cause I mean +/.
&-uh huh +/.
+, &-um ⌈ that's ⌉ .
⌊ (be)cause you're ⌋ gonna actually I mean when you're dreaming that's where you think you are .
⌈ right ⌉ .
⌊ right ⌋ .
but like the center of gravity like where you actually are that that's not in the dream .
right .
it's number five seems to &~en allow us sort_of to correct for that unless +//.
but it's ⌈ not clear exactly what the <connection to the> process is ⌉ .
⌊ so it's just like wherever ⌋ .
⌈ it's okay it's not exactly like ⌉ your opinion for five it's where you are based on .

okay +/.
+, but it's not exactly clear what the +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, what what criterion he's using in deciding <where you> where you should be identifying yourself &-um +...
so I mean it might be that he's &~re he's actually relying on something like number two that you're your brain to to be locating yourself back in Houston +...
in which case number five would be different .
yeah .

⌈ it's strange how they <just say things> xxx ⌉ .
seriously like I'm just gonna sit here and .
it's like a sci-fi story like basically .

like how she talked about how there was like an extra brain and body .
it was like reading science fiction but .
what exactly are we supposed to talk about ?
xxx (0.4) .
has anyone xxx this is ?
<I don't think> none of us could be recorded today .
(0.8) .

no I'm just thinking &=laughs:S10 (be)cause there's no homework so I haven't started reading .
am I the only one who read ?
⌊ I don't know if anyone xxx ⌋ +/.

&-um like just to go through the ⌊ the ⌋ +/.

I'm just wondering how plausible you think the the various options are .
okay .
<did you> did you guys <like the> like the the reading ?
I did personally I though it &~m &~l &~eas &~eas a little easier to grasp the concepts +/.
mhm +/.
+, and &~easy more enjoyable to read .
&~cu it was kind_of like &~ridin reading science fiction +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, slightly so &~i for me anyways it made it easier to grasp exactly what was going on (be)cause there's been some other ones where it was just like I read the whole thing and I was like &=laughs what was the point of ?
what did I miss ?
but I don't know I liked this one .
but okay &{l=READING Where Hamlet Goes There Goes Thine .
&}l=READING &-um <let's see> (0.32) okay so .
do you agree with the first one ?
(0.5) .
yeah .
I think so but +...
⌊ he needs a body ⌋ .
⌈ this this ⌉ no number one is kind_of like the whole Julia North type switching the brains and okay I don't think you're the body I think you're the +//.
I mean my opinion is you're the brain but that goes against his his theory in there .
which one you say ?
well with the first one +/.
⌊ the first one ?
oh ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ where he says ⌉ it's like the body is you I &~beli like if you hadta say &~i is the body me or is the brain me ?
I'd say the brain is .
+, yeah +/.
+, so <I don't> I don't like the first one but ⌊ I don't know ⌋ .
⌈ I think ⌉ I think I I'd go for the fifth one .
I mean &~tha I think &-um for the point of view one that it just depends on how you see it there's no one way of saying that this is me and either the body is me or the soul is me .
it's probably like how you <how you really see it> .
wait I don't understand the center of gravity thing +/.
mhm +/.
+, like what what exactly does that +//.
like how how is it the corrected point of view one ?
like I just got confused (be)cause like this xxx .
yeah well it's +//.
if you look on page two twenty four <where he's> where he's stored as where he's introducing the &-uh the idea that he is that he is &~t somehow this version of the immaterial soul .
it's I think it's actually kind of confusing <what he's> what he's getting at but in the scenario he's thinking okay your connection with your body is severed and &-um you've got this moment of &~s thinking oh well I'm in +//.
he's got this moment of thinking well basically I'm underground in this tunnel and I must be sort_of dead but but that can't be right I'm still thinking <I'm still> I'm still somewhere and he's he thinks well oh I've got +//.
it must be that I'm back in Houston and that I'm just the brain in that &-um tank that I saw covered with electrodes that's where I am .
and in that moment of saying oh I know I was wrong to think that I'm underground unconscious in &-um in Phoenix I think it is .
&-um he's he's saying look I can't be &~un identified with my point of view it seems to it seemed to me that I was underground just a minute ago &-um but underground <and not> and not in contact with anything not sensing anything but I was wrong .
actually at that moment when it seemed to me I was unconscious and I must be in &~Hou in Phoenix I was in fact back in Houston .
and it seems to be that somehow he's thinking that there's a correct +//.
he he should have been identifying with his brain .
&-um even so he was making a mistake his point of view wasn't wasn't correct .
but why was he making the mistake and why was he why should he identify with his brain is less clear exactly what what &-um what makes it correct to say he's &-uh located in one place or another .
<I think> I think that just proves that he's the brain (be)cause &~li like when he says that you know since there's something thinking +/.
mhm +/.
+, and since the probably I mean and since the body's not thinking and so I hafta be the brain so I mean if you just destroy the brain then nothing will think .
so &~do doesn't that just mean that he's the brain then .
&-uh does the fifth point &~i that with it being changeable that can account for like okay when they have the two like the brain and the machine and them being able to like +/.
mhm +/.
+, turn the brain off +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, so okay .
I don't know where I was going but &=laughs:multiple brain freeze .
okay .
so you wanted to say that the brain theory can't be right .
<you were> you were you were arguing you were saying that you &~we you thought the brain theory was probably the ⌊ the right way to look at it ⌋ .
⌈ well &~ov no ⌉ over the body +/.
mhm +/.
+, theory I if I hadta chose between brain or body I would choose brain but then if you introduced an artificial brain and you're still the body but it's not your <your real> body it just gets so confusing &=laughs:S7 (be)cause there're so many different levels .
I don't know .
I just think that I mean from these kind of extreme cases you just can't use your common sense of knowledge of everything .
like you just can't say well you know this is this and this is xxx .
<you have> &~t I I don't think a single answer can ever exist for xxx .
but <I mean> I mean the most most strongest one would probably be that the brain is you or something .
I mean I wouldn't I I don't see any reason for saying the body is me +/.
mhm +/.
+, except that it just looks like probably the person .
so what what &~ex what arguments does he give against thinking that the brain is you +..?
he's not very satisfied with that .
yeah (0.13) .
oh the whole robbery +/.
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ thing ⌉ is that +/.
+, mhm +...
+, that &~ma I mean it kinda makes sense like which one would you prosecute ?
the body or the brain ?
&=laughs and .
but you &~wo you wouldn't prosecute the brain (be)cause the people can't do anything to a brain .
it &~does it I mean it doesn't move by itself it you know ?
yeah I know +/.
+, and it it's not (be)cause if you charge a person you're basically charging a &~f like a fine on him or you're &~t you're you're trapping him in prison right ?
so you trap a brain that doesn't do anything +/.
+, yeah you can't +/.
+, you &~c like the brain can still like think and control the body to do something else outside +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, right ?
so it doesn't do anything different .
but but you can't really identify a person &~a as the body though because it's the brain that's doing the control right ?
so .
that's kinda hard .
no but if you had a choice between either defining the body <and the> and the brain or the brain as a person what would you define would you say that ⌊ your ⌋ .
⌈ <I would> ⌉ go for the brain yeah .
so his argument there hinges on what would you punish ?
would you punish the brain or would you punish the body ?
but how would you how I mean one thing I was thinking about how do you actually punish a brain ?
&=laughs:multiple .
yeah <that's what I was> that's what I was actually thinking about ⌊ yeah ⌋ .
⌈ (be)cause like ⌉ in here he said even if like they &~ha have it in like the state prison or whatever +/.
mhm +/.
+, his body would still be out there and like if it was still transmitting ⌊ signals he'd still feel like ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ yeah so they wouldn't do anything ⌉ +/.
+, he was free running ⌊ around ⌋ .
⌈ mhm ⌉ +...
so what would be punishment for the brain ?
I mean if the &~b the brain's happy in that kind of case right ?
&=laughs:multiple .
they're just storing it &~s someplace else in the prison .
so can you punish the brain and body separately ?
I don't think so .
it doesn't seem like it .
could you stop the brain from &~s thinking though ?
I mean that would be killing +/.
⌊ killing ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ it ⌉ though .
which is +/.
like +/.
+, capital punishment .
&~o or restricted it from &{l=SIC hafting@n$part &}l=SIC the connection between the brain to the body ?
yeah you could cut the connections ⌊ yeah ⌋ .
⌈ yeah ⌉ you could cut the connection that's that's sorta ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ then it would be ⌉ like when he lost his +/.
well ⌊ he &~co ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ connection ⌉ underground or ⌊ whatever ⌋ .
⌈ mhm ⌉ .
would you be able to keep it alive though without like if you cut all the connections ?
yeah he &~co like he could still think but he just couldn't connect with the body .
like he couldn't tell the body to do something .
he was still able to think .
but you need to keep the connection so that like the body like lives like the brain needs to be able to tell the body to breathe and ⌊ circulate ⌋ +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, blood and eat and drink .
that's true .
&=laughs so .
so if you put the body on life support someplace else ?
well ⌊ yeah I guess you could do that ⌋ .
⌈ yeah how about that ⌉ ?
&=laughs:multiple .
but this is more trouble than it's &~wo no &=laughs:multiple .
I don't know that poses an interesting question +...
so it's not <that the> that the argument he has given against the brain theory is actually a good one .
his argument is where do you who do you punish the brain or the body ?
who do you put in prison ?
well if that's the argument &-uh that doesn't show just because you don't put the brain in prison that the brain isn't the one isn't you as the one that's responsible .
mhm +/.
+, so that I think is is some support for your view that maybe his his argument against the brain theory isn't as strong as it looks at first sight .
yeah (0.5) .
&-um for the third one like I I didn't quite get it I mean but where he says that where the point of view is wherever xxx I mean I couldn't understand what he's saying .
⌊ the third point ⌋ ?
⌈ for the point of view ⌉ ?
&-um point of view is where it seems to you that you're located .
so wherever you know it <seems to> seems to you now that you're in this classroom on the second floor of Mason Hall and his &~o his view is the third view is well that can't be wrong .
wherever it seems to that you located you're that's where you are .
okay .
so I mean isn't &~a isn't that true for all practical purposes I mean even if I'm wrong I mean who cares whether I know I'm still here .
so .
well .
when you're dreaming though you think you're somewhere &~el like when &~yo your body is actually in your bed you think you could be in space and you know in xxx wherever your dream takes you +/.
mhm +/.
+, ⌊ so ⌋ .
⌈ &~w at that ⌉ point you're probably I mean so like you're like I I don't there's anything wrong with that I mean I don't know about that ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
I'm gonna go check on some of the other groups .
oh okay .
(0.5) I don't know point of view .
I don't understand that one ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ I don't ⌉ see the point of I mean have &~yo ⌊ did you see <the like> for the past five classes ⌋ ?
⌈ the <point of> point of view ⌉ ?
&=laughs:multiple .
for the past five classes we're just discussing like ⌊ I don't know weird cases ⌋ I mean it's just the same xxx .
so how is the &~o how does he disprove the point of view ?
I don't know +/.
+, ⌊ I couldn't tell where like the point of I love how like I love how I'm like the only one ⌋ who read it .
seeing how I usually never you know I usually do my homework just right before I come to class but no I had trouble like figuring out where he stopped arguing for point of view and where it was just like continuing his story .
I think he probably would have corrected it when he said the soul equaled the &~b on page two twenty four you +/.
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ know how ⌋ she said it's the corrected point of view +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, so probably ⌈ somewhere ⌉ .
⌊ so somewhere ⌋ I <&~s also> remember seeing that because like I knew she said it's like the corrected version of the point of view thing but I don't understand +/.

because ⌈ it would be ⌉ +/.
⌊ yeah and it's ⌋ +/.
+, it would just be another version of point of view like like you just thinking of us I mean just correcting yourself but it still be point of ⌈ view yeah ⌉ .
⌊ point of view yeah ⌋ .
like if point of view is just where you think you are at that moment then isn't it continuously corrected (be)cause like +/.
yeah exactly +/.
+, you're correcting where you are you're gonna +/.
+, mhm mhm +/.
+, ⌈ so ⌉ .
⌊ so ⌋ how could that be a different view ?
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ yeah or ⌋ I mean it might be totally different but she just it's not like stated like the way it's labeled as corrected point of view probably isn't the best but &~no I have no clue what his final point like this is what it is .
⌈ (be)cause ⌉ .
⌊ well he ⌋ he wants you to think about it .
yeah &=laughs:multiple .
well wait is he saying that the soul thing is what he think is &~cor what he thinks is correct ?
mm .
(be)cause he said like right here my mood was on like the top of two twenty five &{l=READING my mood then was chaotic on the one hand I was fired up with elation of my philosophical discovery and was racking my brain &}l=READING ⌈ you know so ⌉ &=end_of_second_simultaneous_conversation .

&=break_in_recording .
okay &-um +...
okay guys &-um like to get back back together .
and just to to poll where you guys got to in your deliberations <did you> did you guys come up <with a> <with a> with a best answer ?
<with like> five .
I think we came up with five .
five ?
that's our best .
how come ?
&-um &~beca well basically we looked at it as &~ki a_lot like three +/.
mhm +/.
+, but with a set kind of standard ?
but we didn't really know what that was so .
with what we could think of as being the best set standard we liked it ⌈ <I think> ⌉ .
⌊ mhm ⌋ so you think it's not just for the case where he's where the connections start fizzling out +/.
mhm +/.
+, but it works for all of the cases .
you are wherever sort_of the center of gravity for you is .
+, yeah .
+, <what about> what about other groups ?
&-uh we went with four more or less .
body plus brain ?
so <you're partly> you're partly where your body is +/.
right +/.
+, and partly what your ⌈ brain is ⌉ .
⌊ right ⌋ because when they were together &-uh like right in the beginning before any of the operations he knew exactly where he was he knew everything about himself .
but then when he got separated he still had a point of a a specific point of view .
mhm +/.
+, but he didn't know which one and that's when he started questioning it .
and then &-uh when everything got severed &~i he didn't really have a body .
you know ?
it was just like wow I don't have a body and he seemed just so like discontent because he didn't understand anything he was just like what's this what's that all he could do was think and it didn't seem like he really had any point of view he didn't really have much of an identity .
and then once the new body came it was like it's a new body .
and then he was kind_of complete but then it got all kinda jumbled ⌈ with the ⌉ +/.
+, two different brains .
okay so you thought his when the body starts losing contact the body just dies +/.
mhm +/.
+, and so he's only located in Houston where his brain is .
+, right .
+, &-um even even when the even when the connection even before the &~br body completely dies do you think that's right ?
if the connection is severed he &~lo he's located where the brain is ?
+, what do you ⌈ mean ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ so ⌋ well it might it probably takes his body a little a while to actually you know completely die +/.
+, right +/.
+, after the connections are severed .
+, right .
+, &-um so before the body completely dies but the connections are severed do you think do you think he's in both places or do you think he's in just in Houston ?
well he's partly in both &~pl I mean he's predominately like most of him the part of him where where everything goes on like everything +/.
mhm +/.
+, <that makes> I mean his body is alive and breathing so that's part of him that's alive in +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, I thought it was in Tulsa ?
is that where it was ?
⌈ I don't really remember ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ I don't remember it exactly +/.
+, so that's still alive so that's still there .
but once that dies and you know it doesn't know where it is then or when that point exactly comes then everything that's left of him is what's in Houston .
okay so you you're you're inclined to think that still before it dies it's located in two places .
yeah .
+, yeah .
and you guys would think in going for number five you're inclined to think <when the> &~se when the severing comes he's located actually where his brain is not not in both places .
and before the severing comes where would you say the center of gravity is ?
(0.7) .
I don't know .
before he loses communication with +/.
mhm +/.
+, with the body ?
okay so it just it travels back and forth depending on where +/.
yeah +/.
+, his point of view should be .
<what about> what about you guys ?
what did you come up with ?
we went with number five as well .
pretty much like the same reasons as them and how you said like the severing +/.
mhm +/.
+, was like with the body .
so when &~yo when it severs when the severing comes he's wholly with his brain not with not at all with the the living body that's just completely disconnected .
mhm .
+, <what about> what about you guys ?
I don't think we actually came up with one that we totally liked .
mhm +/.
+, there were +//.
like we had a_lot_of people I guess like five but we didn't totally understand five and <how it> how it varied from regular point of view so we couldn't really like accept that one but I don't know .
are you guys were also pretty tempted I &~kn I know you were +/.
+, by the &~bra just the straight brain theory .
I'm wondering whether there could be a comeback for the brain theory against this this intuition about your point of your point you are where your point of view is .
I don't know .
I felt like number five combined the two two and three like it's your brain but then it's I mean it's your point of view but then your brain is what is correcting itself .
I don't know if that that helps ⌈ with anything ⌉ .
⌊ so how is it ⌋ how does it combine the two ?
(be)cause it's your point of view like you said and then it's corrected like that's it's like logical thinking is what's correcting it and that's basically your brain and when the whole time the perspective perspective that we're getting is from the brain so I feel like that's what's actively correcting the point of view .
well your brain is doing <all of the> &~th all of the thinking right ?
yeah .
+, &-um but I'm wondering <how exactly> how exactly number five can be a combination of two and three .
+, I'm just I don't know .
+, ⌈ &~c could ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ if I didn't &~kn ⌋ if I didn't explain it then it's xxx +/.
+, &=laughs:multiple well it's just the thing is two says you are &~wha just identical to your brain .
your body is just this kind of it's like &~a having artificial limb .
it's no more you than an artificial limb are is or no more you than your clothes are .
so looks like number five the sort_of point of view corrected point of view &-um center of gravity view doesn't wanna take that kind of view about what you are .
they does they don't wanna say &~a advocate of number five doesn't wanna say you're wholly identified with your brain irrespective of where you think you are .
&~s so number three the advocate of +//.
sorry &~n the advocate of number two the brain theory would say it's just an illusion to think that you are walking around underground .
that's completely just as much an illusion as if you were in this &-um you were controlling this &-um this this &-um &-uh you're on this boat controlling this robot underseas with this virtual reality kind of &~m manipulation .
on that kind of case you really are up on the boat &~y however much it might seem virtual reality wise that you were &-um under on the sea floor .
and the advocate number two says it's the same thing with your brain .
you are wherever your brain is even though it may seem that you're completely &-um you're in completely another place altogether (0.7) so I think that it's hard to combine two and three .
&-um they've got really +//.
number the advocate of number three thinks well look you are wherever you think you are .
where you are who you are depends <on your> on your actual point of view .
what how it seems to you +...
a_couple_of people I think you &-um were saying a problem for number three would be that &-uh how can you be where it seems to you (be)cause in dreams for instance you're &-um you're clearly not is that ?
+, mhm .
yeah that was just what we said .
+, (0.5) <what do> what do people think ?
is it could you be is that a good objection to the number three ?
+, mhm .
+, (0.4) well and a_lot_o(f) people are are really tempted by by the idea that you are this sort_of immaterial thing this &~semi center of gravity .
how do how exactly do you think we should capture the idea of you know where your center of gravity should be ?
(0.6) how do you decide that you were wrong that your center of gravity how can you ever just you know decide that you're wrong about where your center of gravity is ?
+, wait could you say that again ?
+, I'm just wondering what the standard for sort_of correcting your yourself is .
so in the case of a dream <you know> you're dreaming that you're on Mars .
+, mhm +/.
+, and maybe it's a completely absolutely lifelike dream .
you're imagining it vividly and it's completely true that Mars is like that .
but you're actually we wanna say you're actually at home in bed under the covers asleep .
how is it +//.
why is that the right answer ?
why why does the center of gravity why is your center of gravity still here on earth even though you're dreaming about Mars ?
(be)cause it's not real it's not really happening .
your point of view doesn't isn't only like you looking at Mars .
it's what that point of view is is that your body's up there on Mars and you're interacting with things like feeling them looking at them +/.
mhm +/.
+, hearing them smelling them whatever .
but the fact is like that's not really happening .
that's not what's really going on .
what your where your body really is is under the covers and because of that you can't see and you can't hear and you can't do any of that stuff +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, (be)cause you're dreaming so it's not real and that's why you don't take it as real .
okay so maybe that's a a new a different way of understanding what a point of view is .
a point of view is where the place where all of the sensory information is coming in .
right .
+, so in the case of the the body ⌈ example ⌉ .
⌊ well ⌋ +/.
hm ?
+, that's that's not where you are but I'm saying in that particular case you can't take a dream as to be as in well you can't say that your your brain is up on Mars and you +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, can't say that your point of view is up on Mars because that's just an illusion you know ?
it's like if somebody +/.
+, I don't agree +/.
+, goes and like hypnotizes me or something that doesn't mean that that's the way things are it's just an illusion ⌈ <to see that> ⌉ .
⌊ but that's ⌋ your point of view though .
you'll still say I mean if &~s if you asked a dream person where they are they'll say wherever you're dreaming that you are whether or not your body's there .
well then you could go like the same thing that happened with &-uh Wira was it Perry's dialogues ?
mhm +/.
+, it's like is it is that your point of view is that caused the right way or the wrong way or is it your seeming point of view ?
you could go back to that sorta argument you know ?
but that's not really the argument .
all it's saying is that the number three's like wherever you're thinking you are that's where you are .
&-um right <I think that's> I think that's a good point .
I think actually both of these are really good points because &-um &=laughs:multiple yeah you could could be giving us a new way of trying to figure out where your real point of view is .
you point of view if the seeming point of view is actually coming from &~ac real sensory input in the case &~an and that is the case with the &-um with when your body is separated from your brain .
the body is gathering real sensory input .
it's got a real you know point of view on the world .
whereas in the dreaming case you've got you've just imagining input .
there isn't any real input .
so that might be a way of distinguishing number three from number five .
number five says look in_order_to have a a point of view you hafta have real input coming into you .
and &-um if there's &~n and in the case where the the the link got severed between the body and the brain you don't have any more real input going in to that distant body .
so you don't have an apparent point of view that's distinct from from where your &~th your actual &-um mental processing is taking place back in the brain .
yeah ?
I had a question that led up &-uh about how he he came about with number five .
once the body and the brain got severed and separated he was talking about a connection how he was losing the connection +/.
mhm +/.
+, but what type of connection did they have ?
I was wondering about that because in the examples that you gave like a a remote control +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and ⌋ then the car or whatever &-uh the remote control is &~c controlling the car just as a brain would control +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ a body ⌋ as it seems in that example so like what kind of connection &~wo did they have ?
it's supposed to be something just like that .
he says it's radio connection between ⌈ the the neurons ⌉ .
⌊ so like if ⌋ he was thinking to raise <the arm> the arm would raise .
yeah .
+, okay .
yeah so think whatever the you've got for all of your &~i it's kind_of an outrageously complex and and probably technologically impossible feat +/.
⌈ well I was just ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but the idea is that ⌋ for every of of your neurons coming output neurons you've got a little &-uh transmitter attached that would &~trama transmit it to the other end of the &~ne the nerve which would help control your muscles in the body .
and then vice versa <for every> for every nerve and &-um sensory &-uh neuron you have another transmitter going back to hooking it up to the right place in the brain .
so it's just like these these &-um remote control cars and so on +...
but this raises another I &~me this suggestion yeah your suggestion &-um that that you are wherever &~tha your real sensory input is being &-um channeled from .
+, I don't really +/.
+, well .
I mean I don't really believe in the whole point of view thing to begin with +/.
okay .
+, but I'm saying just like what I was saying was just kinda in response to your whole dream thing .
okay you know that's okay .
you don't hafta +//.
I'm not saying you know it's your final considered opinion it was just reaction to this point .
&-um but +/.
just relax alright &=laughs:S1 God +/.
+, one one thing one question it it raises for me at least is what do we say about the the person who's who's controlling the robot under under the sea ?
who's on the ship and has got these these connections with the robot undersea and it seems to that person in some ways that she is down on the sea floor .
that she can see things down there that she could move around to pick things up drag them and she's getting real sensory input from down there and real you know really manipulating &-uh a body down there .
should we should the advocate of the the point of view center of gravity view say that that person is partly on the sea floor and partly up on the ship ?
or wholly down on the sea floor ?
(0.15) .
what's on top of the ship ?
just a brain ?
no the whole body .
the person's there you know .
oh like a do it like a machine is down on the bottom .
yeah .
the machine is down on the bottom the person is up on top and she's got you know a whole &~ki all these levers <it's like a> it's like a really high tech video game .
mhm +/.
+, and you know she can she pulls and and pushes as if she were down on the bottom and &~i and starts to feel to her as if she's really down there .
she kind of identifies <with the> with the machine down there .
(0.7) it's &~ki it's like a virtual reality machine for her .
does that make her partly down there on the sea floor do you think ?
(0.4) .
I don't think so .
I &~thi I think for one thing like &~cert she'll have certain sensory inputs from down on the sea floor +/.
mhm +/.
+, but like if someone calls out her name up on the ship +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, she's gonna be like she'll respond to that if &~w when just the brain's sitting in the vat if someone calls your name to the brain +/.
+, mhm mhm +/.
+, there's gonna be no response whatsoever .
so she's the fact that she's already she's got a point of view a situated perspective up on the ship +/.
yeah +/.
+, and a situated perspective down on the sea floor do you wanna say that it's only the one on the ship that's that's that's really real ?
+, yeah .
+, does that seem right to other people ?
and you might think one +//.
you might think look you know she's probably in two places .
this center of gravity is is kind_of divided in this kind of case .
because you've got both the ability to respond &~an to things going on in the ship and the ability and readiness to respond to things down on the sea floor .
you've got this sort_of two two part consciousness .
or maybe it depends on where you're focusing your attention .
(0.5) .
I agree like temporarily like she feels that but +/.
mhm +/.
+, I don't know .
it's a machine .
and after &~sh you know it'll come up .
and she'll be herself .
and there's gotta you gotta say something about like you know &~pers I think she'd she'd feel like she's down there you know .
and she'd feel like a part .
and she'd feel physically she'd feel down there .
but I don't think I think if you asked her straight out like where are you ?
she'd be like on the boat .
I mean I +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, and if you asked a machine obviously the machine wouldn't answer anything <it didn't know> .
so she's always sort_of ⌈ somewhat aware ⌉ +/.
⌊ just physically ⌋ +/.
+, of her real ⌈ physical body ⌉ .
⌊ I mean she's just the ⌋ when you do virtual reality you're devoting your consciousness and all your physical energy towards moving a machine .
mhm .
would it make a difference do you think if you if she went into a sort_of a trance ?
you know you +//.
people can get so concentrated on what they're doing that you know &~y you you nudge them or <you you> you you you say something to them and they just they &~c completely ignore you .
if she was so bound up in in what was going on under under the sea would it make sense then ?
would it be like having a remote controlled body ?
can you I mean is temporarily a a an acceptable answer ?
yeah well I think with the I mean the the shifting center of gravity point of view &-um is something that that that can change that can move from one place to another in an instant .
I mean that's what &~Den Dennett's idea was is that at the at during this example where &~th the body is under underground in Tulsa &-um and also when the connections start &~shif start going on the Fritz he says well look it just it &~sh his center of gravity shifted in an instant <back to> &-um back to the vat .
it didn't take any time it doesn't you know there's no material transfer of anything that hasta take place +...
so looks like you know the the the time it takes or the time aspect doesn't and distance travel doesn't make any difference &~t for this kind of for this kind of view to to work .
(0.5) &-um <I wanna> I wanna take a few minutes just to talk about &-um &-um for next time I'd like to follow up next time to talk about the next stage of this thought experiment taking it on to the the stage where he's got a new spare brain which is actually a computer &-um and whether that's actually just one person or two people &-um and whether you can actually +//.
one one worry &~th you might have is whether the the computer is actually doing any thinking at all &-um and whether you can have one person with these two brains .
&-um so that's what I wanna concentrate on next time and I wanted to find out if there'd be some people willing to &-um volunteer to lead the discussion for that next time ?
I'll do it .
okay &-um also people &~su someone suggested that we might just give a sign up sheet and let you sign up beforehand for &-um the rest of the the presentations .
&-um would that be would people like to do that or would you like to continue doing it sort of on a &-um after we've had a chance to do the readings for the week ?
let's do a sign+up sheet .
<let me> let me take a vote .
for of how many people haven't done a presentation so far ?
okay of the people who haven't done a presentation so far how many would like to do sign+up sheet now in advance of the readings and versus how many people would like to wait until we do the readings so sign+up sheet now ?
how many people for a sign+up sheet now ?
one ?
two .
two ?
how many people for wait three .
three .
⌈ wait and see ⌉ ?
⌊ come on people ⌋ .
&=laughs:multiple you can't be voting for both .
oh whoops no I I'll go for the wait and see .
wait wait and see that was one two three four .
oh I think the wait and sees have it &-um .
can you send me around a sign up sheet please ?
I'd like to know xxx &=laughs:multiple &=background_noise_as_students_leave_class .
when would you like to ?
&-um I'd say mid March to late March .
&=unintelligible_speech_in_background_until_end .
no the no actually <we didn't do this> the last time but one thing to one thing to that I'd like to to go <through then> <is the> is the plausibility of the second scenario .
could you have could you have two <controlling centers> in one person &-um and secondly is it plausible to think that a computer could be a real xxx a real control <center the &~com> a computer would be a person .
&-uh because he's assuming that as he switches back from one one brain to another artificial brain it doesn't make any difference +...
did &~y do you two know each_other ?
I'm Pearl .
I'm Max .
&-um so we were just talking about what to concentrate on next time .
&-um &-um two things to to think about is to how plausible is this case as is it plausible to think a person could have two different control centers and still be one person ?
the spare brain idea is that even a &~s a starting point ?
&-um a second kind of idea .
one of these brains brains quote unquote is supposed to be a computer .
could a computer actually be a person ?
could it have thoughts and feelings and xxx could that even be part of +//.
could it be a person ?
could it be part of a person ?
&-um so that's another &-uh another worry .
&-um and then a final worry is well <what should> what should what kind_of a theory should we think is true in_order_to you know describe this person ?
is it if we take Dennett's word and it's one person two brains one artificial one real &-um is it the point of view number five that he's appealing to here ?
<are we> applying the the theory ⌈ <on Dennett's> okay ⌉ .
⌊ yeah .
I mean that's ⌋ that might be a harder ⌈ a harder ⌉ thing to get a grip on but that's that's another direction to take it .
how what &~cou what should the theory say about this ?
about this kind of case and you know <what seems> what seems plausible ?
&-um and &-um and then when <the two> the two come apart that's kind_of the case that &-um that Parfit was thinking about where you have you know two +//.
where you've got &-uh a consciousness that divides &-um and they're both okay just gonna be survivors of you and all of sudden you have two people in one body &-um this so that's &~a also kind_of a split brain case .
so that's another another place to to wonder about what should we say about that kind of case ?
are they really two people or one people .
so you I mean these are just sort of starting points to get you thinking about what you can <cull something out_of> just one or two points of this .
+, oh .
yes thank you .
okay okay .
and &-um Grace is sick today +/.
⌊ ah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so she ⌉ told me to tell you that .
okay thanks .
I hope she's feeling better .
it's a bad time to be sick .
so okay .
do you have my Parfit &-uh sheet <that I handed in> ?
oh &-um yes I do .
where is it ?
it should be in my bag .
