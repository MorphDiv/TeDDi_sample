the boy is looking at the frog with his dog .
the boy is sleeping with his dog .
and the frog gets out_of his cup .
in the morning boy is looking in the cup .
and the frog is gone .
and he looks all over his room .
and the dog is doing something very weird .
he opens the window and looks outside .
<cause the dog> then the dog falls out .
and the boy is yelling at the dog .
but the dog doesn't hear him .
then he goes outside and starts calling for the dog while the bees
and the dog looks at the bees .
and the boy's looking in a hole .
and then the dog's still barking at the bees .
and I think a skunk came out through the hole .
and then the dog's going at the hive .
and then all the bees are coming out .
and the boy's looking in a hole in a tree .
and all the bees start chasing after the dog .
<and the> and the boy fell down .
then the bird flew over the boy .

<then the boy> then the boy came on a moose head and was riding
the boy and the dog fell into a pond .
and then &-um <the> the boy heard &-um the frogs .
so he climbed over a broken log and saw two frogs .
and all these babies came hopping out_of the grass .
and then the boy's leaving with a frog I think one of the babies .
and that's it .
the boy is sad because he can't find the frog .
and what might they be saying ?
where are you frog ?
the boy with the dog is really happy about watching his pet &-um
and they're not really saying anything .
and the boy is feeling tired .
so is the dog .
and the frog feels &-um tired of being kept in a cage .
and the kid and the dog are really sad because the dog left .
and they're not really saying anything .
then they start looking for <the &-um kid> the frog in like
and &-um they're saying oh my what happened to the frog ?
then he opens the window .
and he's yelling out where are you ?
where are you ?

<and the dog> and they both feel really sad .
then the &-um dog feels hurt .
and so does the boy .
and &-um <the boy> the boy &-um is really angry at the dog .
and sad because he can't find his frog .
angry and sad and I'm wondering how that happened .
when the dog fell out the glass shattered .
and &-um they were yelling .
and the dog is thinking where are they going ?
they're both feeling sad .
and the boy's yelling come back !

and so then the &-um boy looks in <the> a hole .
and he's like finally I found it .
and the dog's &-um barking at some bees .
and <the and> in this picture they're both finally happy .
and in this picture the boy feels <sad> angry .
and the dog feels angry too .
and why does the boy have his hands on his nose ?
cause there was a skunk .
skunks <aren't> don't pleasure your nose that much .
and what might he be saying ?

then the dog <is> feels scared .
and the boy is checking the hole .
he thinks finally I found my frog .
and what might he be saying here ?
yes !
and here's he's like oh I forgot what bees look like .
he dropped out .
and then an owl comes out_of the hole .
and &-um he feels angry again .
all the bees come over him to snap at the dog .
and the dog feels really scared .
and the boy's saying darn it's not my frog .
and then &-um the boy &-um goes away .
and the owl starts leaving .
and the boy <climbs > is like get away !
get away !
then he climbs a rock .
and he's looking .
and he puts his hand up .
and he says come back !
where are you ?
where are you ?
and he's looking at the moose .
and then the dog's all grumpy .
and is the boy saying anything ?
yeah he is calling where are you ?
is that the owl ?
and when the moose picks his head up the boy falls on the head .
I wonder how the boy feels .
I hope he doesn't get poked .
scared .
and the dog gets scared and starts running .
and then the dog sticks his head in .
then he's chasing him back to the dog .
and he's like somebody catch me !
