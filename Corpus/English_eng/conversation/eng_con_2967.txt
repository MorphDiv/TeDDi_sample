I'll be handing positive post-its so, take it away . 2685_5445
okay . 7605_7825
me ?
okay . 9405_10305
how about two horses fight, xxx, you just think of other animals that fight to be the animal's leader, like the herd's leader . 12245_22165
that sounds +...
be serious . 23765_25925
I watched one video . 28045_29265
I was watching this National Geographic channel and it was talking about zebras . 30145_38445
yeah .
like zebras fight for their herds .
there is +... 38905_42785
exactly I don't know if it's a mammal or not, but honeybees actually do this . 43285_48465
really ? 48625_48885
the queen, the son that it has goes to war with the mother and either takes away the crown or something or kills its mother . 50625_61165
oh .
yeah . 62685_62985
happy Mother's Day . 63525_64105
and if the other bee wins it gets to be its leader . 64885_73645
and you can always tell which bee is its leader because it has only one stripe on its, back of its xxx . 74285_80605
lions maybe ?
we've watched a video before, and they were like fighting, I'm not sure if it was like for a herd or not . 83515_87775
but like the lions xxx . 88495_90135
based on actions and words, how would you describe the relationship between Warrior and Bob ? 90855_98915
I would do it, like it's like they want to adventure . 99355_105775
because they want to go like look out for land and look out for horses to be their leader . 107615_113275
before they even got the herd, so like when he was like a kid or something, he like knew all these other things to do . 113975_125815
so he was always out there helping out . 126115_128395
when he's older, like now in the book, he has a herd that he's herding or something like that . 129415_135795
I would say like they +... 136115_142755
because it said that Bob was an animal lover, so I think like +... 143415_148435
like he's a loving person . 149315_150595
yeah . 150835_150995
they both care for each other . 151275_153415
because like he would always take him out on like, what's it called ? 153805_162325
where he goes out and like spread the herds . 162545_165225
the herd .
yeah .
like xxx .
like character stuff I don't know . 166145_167485
he takes Warrior out all the time . 168205_170965
like wherever he goes Warrior's with him, so they have like that kind of bond . 171185_175405
okay . 176165_176845
this one just like popped in my head . 177125_179785
if you had a horse and you had a herd and another horse wanted to fight your horse, would you let your horse fight that horse ? 180185_188385
yeah, I agree with S_four, I wouldn't let the horse fight because you never know what would happen . 190505_195205
like if he'd get +... 195505_196485
like how that other horse lost . 196765_198385
yeah . 198785_198965
it could get killed, it could get severely injured . 199165_202485
or you could +...
now, what if you get another horse ? 203205_204825
yeah, but like +... 205465_206545
but like, if he was your xxx you wouldn't want to get another one . 206665_210165
I would say yes and no . 210015_211915
no because, same thing with S_four and S_two, I don't want to like, nah . 212435_218175
and yes because it shows that my horse can like be brave against other things . 218835_226535
that's probably what my horse would do if I like knew I was being fought or she did, like I knew they would win or something, I'd probably risk it . 226835_236415
what do you think, S_six ? 236915_237675
if I had a stallion I would let him fight, because I've never seen a wild animal fight each other before . 239965_246745
I have a connection to those two horses fighting . 247185_250925
when I was at my friend's birthday party, I wasn't expecting this . 251665_256785
apparently there was these two horses and apparently one of the horses kicked the back legs at the other horse's face . 257845_264005
oh . 264545_264785
yeah . 265185_265345
and I was like +... 267305_268565
and the next you know, the horses are mad and it starts making these weird noises and gets up on its front paws and I thought they were going into war . 269325_276645
I was so freaked out, I ran and I started playing on the playground like it was nothing . 277285_282005
I would have ran and got popcorn . 282725_283965
do you have a question, S_three ? 286105_288725
yeah, how did you feel when the colt died ? 288925_291825
do you think they could have had prevented it ? 292515_297075
how ?
I +...
I +... 298455_298835
go ahead . 299235_299895
go ahead . 300535_300795
no, you go ahead . 300975_301795
we both said I so I want to see what your I is . 301875_304115
okay .
I felt really bad because, first of all, it didn't do anything to that snake . 304275_312455
yeah . 312775_313115
like, the snake doesn't really, I don't think it really knows not to like bite other animals . 315605_322945
but in the story it said like, he didn't expect the horses, like it just popped out and he was afraid and spooked out and stuff like that . 323345_331165
but, I felt really bad because it reminds of, because my uncle had a horse and it apparently died because it was a baby and it reminds me of that . 331875_345095
and yeah, it's sad, but prevent it because I would like pick it up or do a surgery on it . 346955_354795
just take some sticks . 355115_356335
make it crutches . 356935_359215
I felt like, I flipped the page and I saw like, it just like hit me . 360125_369385
yeah .
I was like, aw . 369665_370245
like the way its neck was like in the ground . 370425_373445
yeah .
it was like +... 373905_374325
it looked like one of those animals that like stuck their heads in the ground or something . 374945_378565
ostriches ?
it looked that way . 379025_388185
it made me feel like I was, like I put myself in the horse's shoes and like +... 383385_392865
the horse does have shoes . 393645_394525
I felt like hurt, you know ? 395345_398945
I mean, you can't really prevent that from happening . 399745_404025
yeah, you can't . 404025_404805
yeah .
so, I mean xxx like a gun, I guess . 405245_408045
I could have prevented the vultures eating it . 411805_414105
I would have went like that +... 414485_415565
I would have stayed there and been like, back off . 415865_417745
I mean like, if you were their mom and dad, you would want to stay there . 418045_420805
like you would feel like really bad . 421225_422385
but horses don't like really know if they're dead or not . 422685_425185
mm-hmm . 425505_425725
so, xxx feel like sad .
that's kind of creepy . 425945_427585
like, what if it thinks it's still alive ? 428085_430345
just imagine it's galloping . 430545_431925
do you have a question, S_six ? 432205_433285
actually, we've answered my question . 433285_436365
I would feel bad for it, but there's nothing you can do . 438035_441675
there's poison in it, you can't get it out because you're in the middle of nowhere and xxx doctors . 441855_446455
I never actually thought of that . 447335_448595
it is kind of not really the snake's fault because like it can't really help not attacking and like +... 448715_456235
it's part of its life, like it was created that way . 456235_458595
yeah, and it thought like the horses were going to harm it or something like that . 458755_462155
I kind of disagree with that, because it was kind of like, I don't know . 463145_468045
like it was out of habit . 468225_469085
I know that . 469305_469665
like I understand that . 469865_470465
but, control your anger, like anger management . 470905_473545
here's a phrase, you can never train a wild animal . 474205_477365
just saying . 477985_478505
I guess .
I have anger issues . 479365_480225
no, you can't because I watched this movie and the story, it's based on a true story . 480305_486885
it's creepy, I know we're on camera, but there was this movie where there is this girl who had a tiger she found in the wild and raised it from the day it was a cub . 487895_497155
and apparently when she got older the tiger ate her . 497615_500055
I have that book . 500755_502555
I read it when I was in kindergarten . 503795_505595
you can never tame a wild animal . 505775_507115
sounds like xxx .
you should see your face right now . 510135_511575
S_five, do you have a question ? 513295_515015
yeah . 515615_515775
how would you track down the herd of horses ? 515995_520195
why ? 520795_521355
I would have looked closely at like +... 522015_524875
I have a horse so he could like sniff its feet . 525075_527335
and even if it takes a while, I would like feed the horse, give it apples or whatever it takes . 528255_536855
just be like, move along, keep walking . 537355_539935
I would like give it breaks though . 540395_542075
I would like, sniff its feet . 542285_544585
go .
my brother, he acts like our dog Daisy is a horse and he hits her a lot . 545085_552445
and he jumps on her back and then she walks and he falls off and hits his head and then he starts crying . 552725_558065
and we're like, it's your fault, don't get on the dog . 558205_560845
what do you think would have happened if the herd refused to go in the corral ? 562865_566925
I think what would happen is, if Warrior wasn't their leader, they would have went off somewhere to hide because they technically didn't know Warrior until they had that fight . 568285_580905
because it shows that Warrior is brave, he's tough, and I guess that's why they chose him to be the leader . 581185_588025
but like, when they were in there, it looked like they were like trying to get out a little bit because they had like all these dust and like horses running around a little bit . 588985_599745
