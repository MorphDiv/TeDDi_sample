number one . 2060_2430
okay . 4770_4870
and now watch how I make it look like number two . 5020_7230
now look like number two . 14190_14950
okay . 19050_19140
here . 20670_20740
number one . 20960_21580
don't this the same . 22420_23380
and now make number two . 24560_25500
I'm gonna do this . 26020_26750
okay . 29430_29600
now I think it . 30020_30620
now . 46820_46950
for the rest of this book there are four more pages on the booklet
and all of (th)em have nice colored pages as you've all been
right . 53250_53340
and what we want you to do is pretend that you and me and how would
I'm not gonna show you on these last ones . 63380_65250
all I'm gonna do is give you this booklet . 65770_67510
and you try and figure out what my movement was to make number one
and then write it down . 73650_74430
okay . 75150_75390
just the same you did before that . 75620_76980
you try and figure it out this time . 77000_78320
and you won't have drawing pictures this time . 79180_80810
right . 80920_81040
you the dumpster are there for you . 81160_82950
does whatever words or not words or drawings you wanna make . 83260_85940
no . 86470_86590
the other thing if you see any lines of symmetry some of you don't
and if you don't . 93140_93950
that's okay . 94000_94420
but if you know what symmetry is if you see the lines of symmetry
but the first thing we want you to do is to describe for us what we
and then you can keep going into H Nine and j . 108220_110370
two . 110580_110720
okay . 115230_115500
if you don't know how then you just you can go on to the next one .
and then go back to the just do the best you can see . 118400_126540
if you can figure your words to tell what someone would have to do
oh yeah . 137770_137950
pink . 149560_149740
my notebook . 154460_155110
probably . 156120_156400
I don't know . 156680_157030
I can't talk to you about that . 157600_158630
this . 162950_163150
was interesting . 163310_163790
what'd you notice . 165780_166470
well at first I thought they were doing much better than you had
&-um because that word could because flip and turn is something
but &-um there'll still be a whole lot of growth that's shown if we
because &-um most of them weren't putting any kinds of amounts with
even_though we had done all of that those activities with giving
they couldn't just say turn right 'cause the people would just hold
they wouldn't move it until you said . 204960_206380
turn right one quarter or turn right one eighth or one half so many
&-um and there'll be they recognized flips from turns a_lot_of them
but they didn't distinguish between &-um the what kind of flips . 220740_225820
so there wasn't a_lot_of those . 226340_227620
some were like you flip it right ways . 227640_229260
and really that that'll be it'll translate to a sign with Flip or
flip down . 235320_235830
they haven't done the thinking yet to realize that . 236340_238510
I think if you ask them now they would know that either way would
oh I . 241870_242000
remember from last year that was . 242240_243220
a big thing . 243320_243620
yeah . 243640_243750
right . 243800_243900
yeah . 244000_244370
for a while they were differentiating between . 244860_246470
up flips and down flips Ups and down flips . 246940_249220
so that will still be coming . 249710_250660
&-um and the combination those were still just as challenging for
once last year . 258240_258829
yeah I think they got to the end of it . 258880_260779
and instead_of being able to break that down . 261079_262860
uhhuh . 263050_263180
that moved down into two separate parts . 263620_265220
like first a turn and then a flip or first a flip . 265380_267850
and then a turn they &-um . 267920_270310
are they doing like they did last year picking the first one or the
actually I thought this group at this time still because we haven't
ugh . 282700_282870
she turned it or she booked it but not trying to think of any way
and I don't think even the one way they wrote necessarily was the
<it was> it was something . 292740_294390
and they were really confused by I guess . 294620_297460
slides is what you're seeing all the other years . 297540_299640
we've called just copying you know that was just copying that . 299730_302660
and what they wrote was you keep it the same . 302780_304340
or she didn't do nothing or right . 304360_306090
okay . 306710_306830
or things like that . 307680_308220
but that threw them . 308640_309170
'cause I think they were thinking they should have spotted and
and they simply couldn't . 314120_315220
uhhuh . 315480_315590
so I think at by the end those be writing half just copying the
so even_though they handled this really well and wrote a lot . 322800_325950
and didn't seem overwhelmed by the activity . 326000_328150
they're gonna still I think they'll be much more sophisticated in
what kinds of things are they saying about the good design and a
&-uh yesterday . 337510_338030
well you know they still began season . 339350_341150
it was the first time they're still it's big gets warm . 341510_343790
it's big enough for lots_of people . 343950_345720
bright colors . 346660_347300
lots_of colors many different shapes . 347990_350210
&-um not a_lot_of what design was . 350770_354820
they still don't exactly . 354840_355730
and I asked them some of them you know well what do you mean when
well it could be like trees or flowers or leaves or shapes . 360070_362810
and then they well it's design doesn't have to look like a tree or
but they're really not much more specific than that yet . 370260_372180
so the words shapes patterns colors came up a lot . 372830_376950
the word designs came up . 377100_378630
but they didn't have a_lot_of things to call the bear when they
and they still had to get those ideas out_of the way that a good
and they did some really interesting talking about three d quilts
more three d and if there more stopping in certain parts or adding
but what it is is they just don't know much yet . 406520_408190
I mean they quilt means comforter quilt means blanket quilt &-um
so I think that's that discussion . 414220_415810
had some interesting ideas in it . 416620_419220
you know . 419590_419790
and then they got into shapes . 420900_422740
and they I we talked about a little bit . 422810_424340
&-um what kind of shapes will you find a_lot_of . 424380_426910
if you're looking down a row of qui . 427100_428310
and you're gonna decide which one you . 428360_429500
liked the best or which one appeals to you most . 429560_431660
and what shapes are you gonna see . 432020_433500
and there were some different ideas about that . 433860_436100
and some of them talked about . 436370_437420
we'll go put these back . 437890_438870
thank you things like that . 439210_440540
so there are can you go put these two back . 440560_441890
okay . 442190_442460
let's go . 442480_442860
there are good ideas there . 443190_444500
oh . 444740_444910
but the reason I think it was so good that we got that on tape this
I think that that what do you anticipate . 458080_459340
&-um talking about . 459980_461300
if they talk about colors they'll talk about color schemes or
and if they talk about shapes they'll talk about more than one
and they'll like bugging that better instead_of just triangles if
you . 488580_488680
mean relating it to different kinds . 488800_490580
of motions . 490600_490910
mhm . 491300_491510
I think they'll be able to say if you have a courseware that's made
mhm . 496880_497090
when you take that course where and move it around . 497240_499420
it's gonna come together in different ways and make shapes . 499440_501540
it feels like it'll come together to make diamonds which are
&-um . 506220_506310
and so I think they'll talk about pillars and shapes . 506980_509100
and I think they'll talk more about pattern in a more specific way
mhm . 512280_512570
and I think the end at the end they'll very definitely be talking
they'll be talking about . 517789_518570
you mean you think symmetry would be one of their design . 519299_521070
criteria . 521559_521720
yep . 521740_521900
yep . 522419_522559
I think they'll talk about what they've come to find out for them .
so it'll be it was a good starting point . 526380_529100
I noticed that you gave them some problems . 529600_531500
&-uh based upon the &-um Sam Johnson or . 531880_534740
blue blue ribbon . 534760_535490
quote there . 535760_536100
mhm . 536120_536220
and what kind of problems did you give them . 536640_538220
and what's your intention in giving them . 538310_540060
let's see . 540610_541420
&-um well during this unit since we do so much geometry to keep the
we use a_lot_of those problems . 546860_548860
&-um for that this was just a simple &-um joint change unknown . 549140_553780
just so that problem keeps coming back up because I do have kids
so it keeps coming up . 559240_559980
and then why is why are you doing that . 560060_561820
tracking the join change on problem . 562880_564060
because I think that shows a real shift in their thinking of th
