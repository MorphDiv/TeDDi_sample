⌈ is that right ⌉ ?
⌊ &-um John ⌋ +/.

yeah xxx +/.
oh wow +/. 5785_8785
+, so I have to xxx yeah xxx . 8885_9505
okay mkay . 9505_10445
yeah xxx ⌈ so you ⌉ ?
⌊ can I have that back for a second ⌋ ? 11005_15525
⌈ sure ⌉ . 15525_15705
⌊ okay yes ⌋ +/. 16525_19965
alright +/. 20685_21225
+, I was working on this forever and I was getting all confused so I just hadta stop (be)cause .
okay Wien's Law which is &-uh what is it like one over lambda max equals or actually it's like zero point two nine isn't that what it is ? 26195_34415
something .
do you have your book ? 34695_35595
yes .
okay . 36015_36615
see I understand the concept but I don't understand xxx . 36975_42735
okay . 42875_43155
&=pause_while_reading here's your book do you want it ? 60795_62055
oh yeah +/.
+, xxx I'll leave it here . 62095_62815
see the real reason xxx they're recording us sometimes you get a little abusive of the tutors +/. 63355_69575
oh wow +/.
+, just smack (th)em around if they don't know the answers . 70355_72375
maybe I should step outside (be)cause I don't you know xxx .
so you know . 73375_75135
it's actually +//. 75755_76575
they're actually &-uh very &-uh blatantly bugging the office so &=laughs &-um okay so so Wien's Law (0.4) so &{l=READING the second radiation law's related xxx so hot stars look blue and cool stars look red Wien's Law tells us that things like wavelength xxx &~s star &}l=READING <it says that three thousand over T of N> so &{l=READING what is the wavelength based on radiation ? 76675_104255
&}l=READING &-um &{l=READING for example <Log Hayes> how do stars create these two laws xxx &}l=READING okay so now &-um so what does it ask ? 104385_115585
what .
okay the continuous structure +/.
mhm +/.
+, emission xxx and I was thinking first I was thinking that continuous yes +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, because xxx quasar extended +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, it's easier to do than xxx &=laughs &-um and I was also thinking that there's a line in the book that says xxx recognize xxx stars . 130705_139485
+, right +/.
+, but then it would also apply to this is where I get confused . 139965_146125
the emission ? 146625_147025
yeah because it seems like it would be all of (th)em if it's continuous <emission spectra> ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 147405_151725
⌊ I don't think that ⌋ &~ma might make sense . 151825_153365
okay what causes an emission spectra ? 153505_155565
it's the the spectrum's going through a fairly dense heat . 155905_160945
okay . 160945_161185
so it's going like the &-um +... 161465_163845
lambda max that's the that's the wavelength of the maximum on it that's our radius xxx T as far as temperature . 167665_177125
so well let's think though okay so what causes absorption again ? 179225_183225
we're in a continuous spectrum and it's going through some kinda gas I can't remember .
okay like hot dense gas +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ or something ⌋ ?
alright so we actually know these .
where are they back here somewhere ?
radio xxx &=pause_while_reading mm there's something there light and pulse strokes ?
&=pause_while_reading .
so okay .
the original is emitted by the gas okay ?
so is the absorption is emitted by (0.5) . 228745_231145
it's still emitted by the source ⌈ it's going through ⌉ .
⌊ so you're still seeing the source ⌋ but the whatever the &-um gas is is taking out a couple lines . 232505_243425
okay and that's the that's how you can tell which element it is ? 243425_258505
yeah yes .
because certain elements will absorb certain photons +/.
right +/.
+, or whatever lines xxx +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, it's the same for like ⌈ emission though ⌉ .
⌊ so that's +//.
⌋ but for emission you're actually viewing the &-um I think you're actually <given something that comes out> +/. 257975_262755
xxx the gas +/.
+, right so &-um I'm let's make sure understand page fifty let me show you one thirty one xxx (0.5) here's absorption okay &-um these bond <with that> &{l=READING <especially with neon sign> xxx &}l=READING +/. 264215_287375
+, this is where I get confused .
+, so the pinkish purple color <wait doesn't it question> something about the mercury vapor xxx . 293235_296215
yeah that's where I got it from xxx they're both emission lines . 296535_304655
xxx piece &-um for spectrum .
&-um I was saying I wanted to say yes +/.
mhm +/.
+, because that would be hotter than +/. 304875_316915
+, right +/.
+, &-um I don't know and this law with that law xxx . 316885_324265
mhm &-um &{l=READING by studying the spectral lines we can identify the elements &}l=READING &-uh-huh-huh-huh-huh I wanna say that it is all three of them . 325205_338545
okay do these xxx right here these two &-um &{l=READING emission spectra solaria@n gas will be excited xxx &}l=READING so that means it's hot +/. 339445_347645
mhm +/.
+, but if it's hot it's not gonna be red is it ? 348745_351885
&-um it depends how hot it is you know there's like different degrees of hot xxx . 352325_355385
<you see I was confused> xxx <red so then> .
okay so you said +//. 355525_360565
okay so the neon tube is red so it's cooler than the mercury tube . 360765_364865
but there'd still be an emission line so xxx .
yeah it's just different degrees of the emission . 365855_371675
and so I mean if you're +//. 371675_372415
okay so if this is emission and you're saying that even if you can say that this bright red is cooler than that and you're using Wien's Law . 372615_381895
you can tell the relative temperature . 382055_384095
yeah yeah .
which is xxx okay .
<I wanna deal with that first> .
mkay +...
why don't +//.
<lemme just> lemme just consult Charlie ? 396215_398295
wanna &-um okay if you've got &{l=SIC threes &}l=SIC types of absorption you got continuous or three types of emissions +/. 398295_406595
mm +/.
+, spectrum &=laughs:S1 +/. 407555_408535
+, yeah +/.
+, continuous absorption and emission +/. 409875_411015
+, uhuh +/.
+, and you've got <Wien's Law> Wien's Law +/. 411415_413875
+, uhuh +/.
+, does that apply to all of them or only a couple of (th)em ? 414515_417235
&-um Wien's Law only applies to continuous +/. 417235_422335
<does it> ?
+, spectra alright ? 422535_423475
+, okay +/.
+, &-um well that's not no no I'm sorry +/. 424145_427105
+, ⌊ I'm wrong ⌋ . 427485_427925
Wien's Law only applies to black bodies alright ? 428105_432025
+, okay &=laughs +/. 432925_433285
+, lemme lemme lemme give you this alright ? 433585_435525
let me say it like this a black body &~ba +/. 436385_437845
+, I hadta get up +/.
+, yes that's cool .
a black body is is is in a sense a perfect emitter okay ? 438205_445465
any energy that comes in it absorbs and any &~abs energy absorbs within the mass so basically &-um the +//. 446045_451905
I mean it's it's the perfect emitter okay ? 452465_454885
<you can't> you can't get &-uh more you can't get more protons from anything than a black body at a given <at a given> &-uh at a given time the the &-um so &~wha what happens is Wien's Law applies to a black body and it describes a black body . 455005_475265
now the thing about the only bad thing about a black body is there's no such thing physically you know . 475745_482405
however there are a_lot_of things that are very very close . 482135_484995
&-um they yeah it does give off a continuous spectra however things like &-um there's other types of &~thi there's &-uh things you haven't dealt with like xxx +/. 486555_494075
+, by xxx +/.
+, yeah &=laughs:S2 but they give off continuous spectra too but it's just not &-uh &~i &~i it's &-uh a different kind yeah so &-uh Wien's Law applies to a &~bla and where's our Wien's Law in here ? 494595_509755
it's a sigma t@l over four .
xxx one twenty six okay .
one twenty six ?
yeah +/.
+, yeah so this says the energy is equal the energy given off is equal yeah oh yeah okay this is the &-uh Wien's Law is the the maximum this is they're they're similar in the sense that this the energy of xxx is equal to the temperature to the fourth power . 519565_538065
so that means you increase something in temperature by two increase it two increase it <two times> <two times> two times two . 538365_544705
so &-uh you can see we're just giving off energy from &-uh &-uh with a black body &~in increased temperature increased energy xxx . 544705_550765
that's why xxx Wien's Law gives you the the maximum the wavelength the +//. 551105_560265
if you look at a &~s if you look at spectra basically what a spectra is is they say at this wavelength I got a hundred photons at this wavelength I got two hundred photons . 560675_569395
this is what it's saying right here . 569855_570755
+, oh okay +/.
+, so this is the &~sh this is a &~sh &-uh a longer wavelength so it's saying I have less photons here than I'm dealing with here . 571315_577915
so you know basically there's a little &~crou counter here . 578175_580255
it's going click every time a photon going <click click> click click . 580415_582755
and right here you're know you'll say I'll just say a hundred thousand photons right here at the at a blue wavelength which is you know about what is this four hundred fifty nanometers . 582865_591725
and you're getting say five thousand right here &-uh seven hundred nanometers . 591965_597085
and that's all a spectrum is . 597905_599145
it just gives you the amount of photons xxx . 599425_600785
I think it's only &-uh continuous .
hm +/.
+, because &-uh Wien's Law only applies to black body +/. 601185_609925
+, right +/.
+, which is continuous .
right yeah but yeah that's that's true but see Wien's Law doesn't apply to all types of continuous spectra . 611425_623665
yeah but for &~no .
well but <for her> for her purposes it'd probably be fine .
&-um let me just see . 623665_623705
but then I don't understand why it couldn't be applied to absorption and emission . 624745_633725
because the reason is is because . 634125_635865
<it's not> &~continu it's not continual ?
well what happens is you know what causes an emission law right ? 640305_644465
yeah it's through gas .
yeah so you have a a cloud of gas what happens is there's a star behind this cloud of gas right ? 645185_652125
lets off radiation this radiation and what happens in the gas actually &~y you have a little atom what causes an atom to emit radiation ? 652305_659005
it can't absorb it ?
it absorbs it first sure but after that (0.4) mkay +/. 659565_668025
+, yeah what happens is &-um you know atoms right ? 670305_673825
you have a you have a nucleus at the center you have electron +/. 674045_676225
+, mhm +/.
+, what happens as a photon comes in hits the electrons the electron just basically it &~jum it gets more energy okay ? 676545_682545
and just because of nature it gets pulled to the small center it just has all this energy and a little while later you get a few seconds at the most it jumps back down xxx . 683295_692855
maybe you it doesn't apply to the other ones . 694435_695655
(be)cause you're not getting the entire spectrum .
well if ⌈ &~thi if this xxx ⌉ +/. 697575_698975
+, ⌊ there's no way that you could ⌋ determine the max wavelength just (be)cause you don't have it it's not complete . 699075_703115
well &~y the thing is is in absorption and emission is &-uh comes in at one wavelength and that's why . 703715_709615
like like for instance here let me tell you this is a this is an emission line this is &-um &~absorb or emission spectrum absorption &~ste spectrum . 710775_720375
<I can't> I can't apply this here because when I when the the photon comes out from within the individual atoms there's no temperature associated with it . 721155_730535
there's just it just is it's pure energy . 730915_732575
those could just be used to show what element it is ?
right exactly . 733595_736095
that's not for temperature . 736115_737435
right I mean this these you can give off an emission spectrum at you know two degrees you know &-uh twenty three degrees Fahrenheit or a million degrees Fahrenheit . 738305_746725
you can have the same emission . 746965_747905
you know +/.
but it wouldn't be +/.
+, I mean well you yeah I mean you can give (th)em off in different temperatures like at you know five thousand degrees Fahrenheit or a million degrees Fahrenheit ⌈ you can give give (th)em off ⌉ . 749925_759605
⌊ so the reason why ⌋ it kinda attracted this one is because it has all of the colors and whatever it tends to be like if it's a higher intensity it could be considered higher so you can kinda tell ? 759605_770645
right but yeah yeah because the reason is just when you look at this spectrum what &~y what you're gonna see is thing you're gonna see this curve this is like this is called a black body it's like you look at the sun this is what it the spectra looks like okay ? 771385_785105
&-um but see the emission emission &-uh emission lines if you looked at a spectra of just emission lines what you see is you'd see something like this &=pause_while_writing straight +... 786115_797535
and this would be different wavelengths and that's all you'd see if it was just emission lines okay . 798535_804775
right +/.
+, and you can't associate a maximum wavelength to it because all all that's all that all an emission line tells you is it says hey there's hydrogen and something's making it kick out photons . 805445_817645
+, okay +/.
+, all absorption's spectra tells you is hey there's hydrogen there blocking &-uh there's a star behind that cloud of hydrogen and I can tell because I see these absorption lines . 817925_826705
+, okay +/.
+, do you understand that ? 827705_828325
okay +...
hm here okay let me just get this real quick so I can xxx &-um so that means can't use it to tell the relative temperature because these are emissions lines +/. 828685_845665
mhm +/.
+, and this just shows what kind of element it is and the temperature of whatever . 845885_850685
+, right +/.
+, alright okay I got that now so I'll leave that +//. 850685_855225
oh yeah .
this I don't get this calculating stuff .
I'm not good at calculating anything . 855845_862905
I don't <don't even have a calculator> . 863285_867385
I forgot about that part +/.
+, mkay +/.
+, so .
mkay well what do I wanna do first ? 867625_873045
we'll look at this and we say &{l=READING calculate lambda max for the following stars and estimate which color dominates the visual spectrum &}l=READING okay so what what do we wanna do here ? 873135_885915
compute ?
well wanna calculate the maximum wavelength at a given temperature okay and this is this kind of ties into the last problem now what kinds of spectra do you think these guys give off ? 886775_899455
in between the xxx and xxx . 900155_900975
hm okay .
(0.4) we just talked about this today too .
I have no idea . 901425_911205
okay &-um let me ask you this . 911845_915285
if it well it depends on the lithium string on it right ?
if you're looking right at it it's gonna be absorption and if you're looking not directly at it it's gonna be emission ? 915485_923145
not really &-um if if you lemme lemme put it like this you have a &~s you have the sun okay ? 923945_931905
mhm +/.
+, or sort some sort of star .
and you &-uh you have +//.
I mean you know how a star works right ? 931905_933305
fusion on +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <the inside> ⌋ +/. 934405_936065
+, mhm +/.
+, okay what you have is &-uh you start out with a star and it starts with you know hydrogen xxx you know hydrogen helium and all the sudden starts fusion fusion &~i these different elements you know fuses you &~hi put &=sound_effect two hydrogens together you get helium you put &=sound_effect two heliums together you get carbon &=sound_effect two carbons you get oxygen <and on> <and on> and on . 943055_961675
alright .
well you get all these different elements so what happened is you just see &-uh what you're gonna see is you're gonna see some sort of +//. 961935_972795
you're gonna see a spectrum that's going to be ⌈ associated ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but can ⌋ can you see them ?
<can you associate> xxx because &-um xxx more elements you can have ? 974585_985765
+, yeah &-um &~o okay well alright . 986445_992485
let me explain this to you you know okay you know I'm I'm I'm trying to think . 995285_1024845
<I've never> I've never been asked a question like this so that's why I'm kinda struggling I'm trying to get through here &-um what happened ? 1030695_1031795
let me put it like this inside a star at the center is like fifteen million times alright ?
it's really hot and &-uh in that center <you know> you know atoms how they each have their electron's outer shell ?
you know what ionization is ?
when you're using electrons ?
exactly .
exactly so you have a hydrogen atom if it gets ionized what is the photon comes in kicks that electron out so hard it just goes away .
it doesn't come back to the &-um so what happens is <you can> you can imagine can do that with hydrogen .
well you can do that with helium too . 1036305_1037505
all you gotta do is kick out two electrons . 1037865_1039005
and then you go <on and> on and on . 1039445_1040665
you know you can keep doing any element you want . 1041105_1042805
all you gotta do is basically kick you know kick out all the electrons in the the shell and absorb it . 1042965_1047765
so what happens is inside the sun there really isn't any elements okay ? 1049325_1055265
what this what you see in there is just you know a bunch of particles you know and this is why it kinda causes it and these particles are very hot (be)cause of the fusion xxx and what happens is is &-uh . 1055645_1066665
does anybody remember how to derive Wien's Law ? 1066685_1068905
Wien's Law ?
yeah +/. 1069645_1070665
+, is from .
oh isn't that in the thermo book ? 1071445_1073145
is it in the thermo book ? 1073965_1074805
oh probably is okay . 1074865_1075965
can I borrow your thermo book ⌈ Charlie ⌉ ?
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
I sent a nice letter to &-uh the publisher . 1078525_1080485
oh yeah I did too . 1081165_1082005
I need to too because my book &=laughs ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 1082685_1084105
⌊ I I actually sent it to the ⌋ sales ⌈ representative ⌉ . 1084105_1085505

⌊ mhm ⌋ .
you should just take this one and go &=sound_effect <when you're in there and just see if it would work> +/. 1089505_1092445
yeah +/. 1092445_1092785
+, you could I won't do that though .
yeah I got a new one but &-um so what happens is let me put it this way okay absorption spectra and emission spectra can only happen when you have atoms around and whole atoms okay ? 1096125_1107545
not +/.
⌈ not &~p xxx ⌉ +/. 1107765_1108165
+, ⌊ not xxx ⌋ continuous spectra happen when your temperatures &-uh are very hot and you have &-uh just you instead of having atoms you have like electrons and protons and neutrons all going around the +//. 1108865_1123445
in general what you have is electrons going around and these protons are just the the &~sh the nucleus are just sitting there (be)cause I mean electrons are very light you know . 1125485_1135025
it's just like you know the the nucleus is like a big rock these electrons are little ping+pong balls like no matter how hard those ping+pong balls against this big old rock like the rock it's not gonna move . 1135125_1145405
that's what it's like okay but these electrons xxx kick off they're bouncing around all this heat's being created and what's this what this is giving off is the continuous spectrum okay ? 1145505_1156985
and then what happens is you're gonn(a) seeing in a a spectrum of the sun . 1157305_1160565
did we xxx this is that's oh you said xxx is that ⌈ that's probably data ⌉ . 1160945_1168985
⌊ yeah &-um the what what ⌋ you'll see is what basically happens in like xxx what it is is <you get> you get some sort of continuum spectra continuous spectra and then on top of that you have like an emission line and maybe an absorption line . 1168985_1180805
then you get a fluorescent xxx +/.
a bulb ? 1180865_1184165

+, ⌊ yeah &~wha what ⌋ you get is something like this right ? 1195275_1198215
but what you'll get in &-uh yeah <in this one> what you'll get is like &-uh basically if you look at it like this say this is a continuous spectrum you'll see like right here this'll be really bright . 1198715_1207015
and this here will be really dark something like this and that's that's because of the emission and absorption +/. 1207475_1211855
+, mhm +/.
+, and that's usually due to some cloud or something around it well so what am I +//. 1212565_1219425
are you following me here ?
yeah it's just it takes me a while to get it +/.
⌈ that's okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ xxx ⌋ &-um I still don't understand that .
so what what we're looking for here we're looking for something like &~s &~s these are all stars okay ? 1221365_1231325
and these stars are red hot and <these are> these are this is the surface temperature of the star this isn't the xxx so what we have to look at here is you know well <these are things that are pretty well known> +... 1231805_1242105
pretty well missed &-um .
how do you calculate .
hm ?
wait just a sec .
well what kind of spectrum does a star give off ? 1245985_1256465
one point one four xxx I think that's +...
(be)cause they say what is the Wein's Law applied to continuous emission xxx .
<it would> be continuous wouldn't it ?
yeah I don't know if it applies to particles +/.
no +/.
+, I don't think it does .
⌈ but I was trying to find xxx ⌉ .
⌊ yeah they're supposed to ⌋ I think it comes from the the black body xxx .
yeah (be)cause it comes from the just the relation +... 1283675_1285595
okay .
that makes sense .
yeah okay I'm almost positive did you get beyond that ? 1286535_1295255
yeah because the relation itself comes from relating &-um lambda max and temperature of a black body . 1295375_1303135
so this relationship is just like if you take you know if you get a spectrum for a black body +/. 1303695_1309435
mhm +/.
+, and you find measure lambda max divided by the temperature then multiply by temperature you're always gonna get this one . 1309865_1314945
so I think it's only continuous . 1315165_1317405
that make sense ? 1318465_1319025
vaguely yeah .
I mean it's like just I mean are you confused about ? 1319745_1324585
no I kinda got it . 1324745_1325845
⌈ kind kinda kinda is better than none ⌉ .
⌊ where's where's the where's ⌋ the kinda now ?
okay .
mkay .
so that's just trying to figure out how to calculate the +/.
yeah so +/.
+, xxx .
yeah alright &~s stars give off what kind of &-uh this would be &-uh ? 1338405_1345165
they give off what kind of emission ? 1346065_1349445
yeah you've probably found xxx there ? 1349445_1350805
what kind of radiation was I talking about earlier ?

okay ?
same thing except lower temperature . 1366045_1370465
so you know xxx .
are you just trying to calculate .
yeah .
see it's just using that equation in the back . 1370465_1375645
what is it three xxx equation +/. 1376505_1377745

yeah yeah there's alright so .
you're whoa alright xxx oh_my_gosh they had this awesome laser pointer at &-um Costco &=laughs it &-um . 1398615_1410935
does it have a little arrow ? 1411375_1411895

does it like <columnate@n$v it> or is it like like when you go to the walls is it like <a big> blur ? 1437305_1442125
I don't know . 1442485_1443305

it looks about right . 1546305_1549025
so what's the xxx over there ?
xxx over there .

xxx so the &-uh xxx .
so what's this this is three times ten to the two that's about three that's what so how many nanometers in scientific notation . 1564145_1573445
not I can't see it in my head . 1574145_1575785

this is about six &~thou it's about the temperature of the sun we'll move this over a little xxx well if you take a look at this okay ? 1744635_1751875
this is &~mini green at the maximum but look at how much the yellow red blue a big conglomeration you know I mean it's I mean <if it> if it was like if it went like this and if +//. 1752195_1763795

but because it's emitting all these colors they mix together I mean just like you know you you've done that and like you've seen a red blue a red and blue light made +/. 1773415_1780115

that's okay this looks like xxx alright .
let's make a short one <look like this> . 4023945_4042365
&-um okay so you have xxx xxx .
this you have to use pi +...

this whole +/.
oh +/.
+, thing is one point four .
you hafta use half of that (0.10) .

you're doing it xxx okay so this is so okay &-um okay you know that this is what's this xxx point thirty one +... 4055775_4055915
this is +...

three point six arc minutes and this xxx .

so this one's wrong ?
one of (th)em is wrong xxx &=laughs &-um it doesn't hafta be xxx no (0.5) this one you use the whole xxx xxx . 4062315_4070735
xxx because like this is pretty close you know ? 4070735_4070755
&-um what did I switch ?
xxx I switched the angle .
right +/.
+, arc minutes xxx arc seconds .
mhm ?
so the xxx &-uh: &=laughs it would be six .
well for this one you wanna use xxx .
&-um sixteen ?
(0.28) .
times thirty point oh one ?
okay this is the number I get here .
xxx this one different ?
yeah I get &~s ⌊ the ⌋ . 4070755_4072375
⌈ to ⌉ the two ? 4072855_4073455
xxx yeah .
well what was I doing ?
I don't know .
xxx I just don't know how to &=laughs:multiple xxx so it's the same exact thing then . 4099625_4100545
yeah actually but this one you should redo using this +/. 4100545_4101605
the halves ?
+, the halves because that's actually more accurate than the triangle one you know . 4102785_4103605
okay .
so xxx .
yeah it's like a xxx .
okay good I was gonna do that later . 4118775_4119735
okay +/.
+, xxx what else ?
did you have another question ?
oh yeah I have lots_of questions xxx I don't know .
I missed the xxx one day and I don't know what's up . 4119735_4121955
&-um number two it's xxx remnants .
and I had something xxx neutrons that were &-uh (0.9) . 4121955_4122195
<have you studied> neutron stars ?
yeah (be)cause these are solar masses xxx is that wrong ?
what about black holes ?
oh well this one could be right ?
but what about that one ?
I thought it hadta be more than ten . 4162505_4162625
&-um technically more than three but &-um +/.
oh really ?
+, &=laughs yeah but &-um this is more likely to be the black hole because this is heavier and it's also younger +/. 4162625_4162745
+, ⌊ what is the ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ so it's xxx ⌉ .
it's younger ?
how do you know it's younger ?
well &~i because &-um it's more massive you know if it's more massive then &~i it's evolving more quickly .
oh okay it will be +/.
+, so younger one it gets its final xxx its final state .
and what does the temperature have to do xxx oh that's the hottest one xxx right ? 4165045_4167965
mhm +/.
+, does that mean it's gonna go quicker ?
yeah (be)cause it's burning things faster .
okay +/.
+, like higher higher temperatures equals higher .
so that would mean <it'll be a> black hole <instead of a neutron> . 4167965_4168665
probably I mean you know it's gonna be one or the other but since it is twenty four masses +/.
okay xxx +/.
+, you still like neutron stars can only be up to about three solar masses ?
⌊ oh ⌋ .
⌈ between ⌉ two and three .
yeah neutron stars can be between two and three .
the thing is like if you have a ten ten solar mass star it's gonna lose a_lot_of its mass at the end of its life you know when it goes through a giant and it like goes supernova and stuff . 4168665_4170145
and so if it loses you know seven solar masses it can be a neutron star . 4171385_4171745
but this one it's gotta lose seventeen solar masses at the least &=laughs +/.
⌊ oh okay ⌋ +/. 4171905_4172065
+, ⌈ so you know ⌉ it's probably not gonna lose that much +/.
+, okay +/.
+, so it's more likely to be a black hole .
okay and this one we don't know ? 4172065_4172605
I mean what does this have to do with it .
like does that help me tell ?
this one ?
yeah .
&-um well you know it's gonna be a little older we know it has <seven different> chemical composition (0.5) I would say based on the mass here I wouldn't worry as much +/. 4187835_4200455
okay +/.
+, about the classification you might wanna check with your TA about xxx .
I don't know what I did . 4200495_4200615
I took off the wrong part again +...
okay .
(0.5) .
so this one I don't know about ?
⌊ <I just guess> ⌋ ?
⌈ yeah ⌉ this one &~i well xxx what do you know about the evolution of stars ?
not much &=laughs:multiple .
well do you have your book ?
yeah where did it go ? 4231555_4237255
is this your book ?
yeah .
really ?
you guys still use the fourth edition ?
yeah <we still have that one> .
oh +...
&-um do you know which chapter it is ?
twenty three or four .
xxx look at earlier today but I still don't know +...
twenty three (0.6) .
&{l=READING the deaths of stars ?
&}l=READING .
twenty two <or whatever> +/.
let's see +/.
+, that's what I was looking through and that was not helping .
yeah this book has some sort_of like it doesn't lay things out so that xxx can &-um (0.11) &-um xxx have twenty four twenty five xxx is a neutron star +/. 4237255_4237275
okay +/.
+, so it &~ca like both of these could kinda go either way .
+, okay +/.
+, you know it's more likely to be one than the other but you know it hasta blow off a_lot_of mass +... 4237275_4237375
&-um (0.17) .
see why does it ask specifically ?
<do you> wanna know about the end of xxx &~s end of the lives well we're gonna also have a supernova and xxx like it's gonna xxx +/. 4237375_4238155
so I put just I don't +/. 4238175_4238255
+, like you know it's gonna be a supernova and in the center you're gonna either have a neutron star or a black hole it's kinda hard to say definitively this is going to be a neutron star .
so should I just say supernova xxx .
like you wanna say supernova but you also wanna say say what's left in the core which'll be a black hole or a neutron star .
so I ⌊ wanna say ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ you wanna mention ⌉ them both .
for both of those xxx (0.7) .
alright could that be +/.
hm ?
+, what's xxx xxx is that a sun ?
it's not it's referring to a different one but yeah it's the sun do you remember what happens to the sun ?
in all those years it's gonna turn into what is it gonna turn into ?
a black hole ?
it's not massive enough it needs to have at least three ⌊ solar masses ⌋ .
⌈ oh (be)cause ⌉ it's only one +/.
mhm +/.
+, so it'll be a neutron or a white dwarf .
it's a white dwarf right ?
mhm because a white dwarf is anything that's up to one point four four solar masses . 4238315_4240135
so like if it has more than that you get a supernova +/.
okay +/.
+, and you end up with a neutron star . 4240135_4240315
okay so since it's one to begin with it's not gonna be more than that right ?
mhm but you're also gonna hafta &~blo like it's gonna be a supergiant before it becomes a white dwarf and all that stuff from &~i from the supergiant is xxx . 4275985_4276025
<right there> ?
yeah but +/.
⌊ xxx the gases ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ what xxx what what ⌉ does it what does it leave behind ?
like what gas is it ?
yeah well you know what ?
what does the gas look like ?
what is that called ?
+, &-um it's actually a &-uh planetary nebula +/.
+, yeah like like it just kinda like the mass just kind_of floats away xxx it doesn't have a big explosion because it never starts xxx it just kinda gets cold and dark . 4276025_4276105
but that kinda blows off (be)cause there's solar wind and all that stuff and so you end up with planetary nebula just blows around like that xxx you know what it's (be)cause they all xxx .
okay +...
I know it's xxx xxx . 4276105_4276125
so it's like this is a cool star ? 4276965_4277005
yeah it's a cool star and you know it's not gonna be real massive . 4277005_4277085
so it'll probably be a white dwarf as well ?
most likely .
you're just guessing xxx and then &-um xxx the last one collision is between two dwarfs .
well you know there are the mass limit of white dwarf is one point four solar masses combined with one point the one point eight so you know that it &-um .
so that's a supernova ?
yeah you're gonna have see you're gonna like it's gonna it goes supernova xxx so you know you're gonna have xxx it's gonna have xxx more than one point four . 4277085_4278845
xxx since this is one point eight and it's gonna be less than three +/.
yeah +/.
+, more than one point four ?
yeah .
so this is gonna be &-uh xxx .
&-um I think you have my mass (be)cause it says xxx and then I get the G from the book and I got this from the book and I just plug them in and I +/. 4292615_4297335
mhm +/.
+, so &-um I would just do that with everything ?
+, yeah +/.
+, and then for the mass of the sun or the earth <and the> xxx where do I get all these from ? 4297335_4303075
⌊ like the book ⌋ .
⌈ those ⌉ are in the book (0.4) I can actually give you the one for the sun I don't remember xxx but I +/. 4303215_4305675
okay +/.
+, but I yeah but just put those in . 4347005_4365305
okay so that one I can xxx but what is this one ?
xxx .
it's asking about the universe like if it was all a black hole so you know you have +... 4365325_4370945
you know you'll you'll find the radius xxx you just want <the radius> the radius of the sun you assume it's xxx and so then you have to find the volume (be)cause density is mass per unit volume so +/.
okay +/.
+, and you know the mass (be)cause it gives you the mass and then you have the volume xxx .
okay (be)cause this is cubed right ?
what ?
+, length cubed is volume ?
&-um four thirds pi r@l &~cu cubed .
okay oh that's just for a square would be length ?
xxx <or something> +/.
yeah +/.
+, a cube ?
for a cube yeah +/.
cube right .
+, but if you &~wan it's probably xxx easier (be)cause things get xxx .
so four thirds-pi four thirds pi r@l cubed right ?
or is that wrong ?
xxx so that's all I do xxx . 4379445_4379585
yeah <well that's> well that's all you you know you have mass over volume +/. 4412795_4419455

do you have questions about those geosynchronous orbits ?

I'm usually <passed out at this point> (0.6) .
so you're gonna find alpha in terms of arc seconds okay ? 5296435_5309855
okay +/. 5310155_5310235

okay ?

so you want D as the distance okay ?
+, okay +/. 5344935_5345095
+, and the way to solve for that basically so you've got &-um you can pretend this is a right triangle opposite over hypotenuse so it's like so I don't know if you remember your trig so opposite over hypotenuse so that's R over D is equal to sine Theta but Theta's really small +/. 5345115_5362635
+, right +/. 5363395_5363435

+, so in other words D equals &-uh R over Theta does that make sense ? 5365925_5373765
the way I did that ? 5374825_5375405
kind_of refreshing me yeah (0.15) .

just to &~w well but I mean it wants to stay in the same place so what kind of an orbit is that ? 5679205_5684125
oh &-um so what kind of orbit the one the satellite's in . 5687205_5690665
let's see here .
let's go back to this geosynchronous stuff . 5690925_5693425

⌊ you don't ⌋ have xxx &=reading_throughout_utterance that's okay we'll find it light and telescopes what's this one about ?
yeah this is it (0.7) so what did we say again &-um well we don't really know if it's a geosynchronous orbit (be)cause +//. 5738055_5742555
although it is staying about the same point but &-um we can find let's find the period . 5742895_5749735
let's find a equation for period +/. 5750975_5752455
okay +/.
+, before we make any generalizations that may or may not be right .

orbital &=mumbling_while_reading so you know the distance and you wanna find the period (0.5) does that look like something you might xxx does that look like a bunch of &-uh +...
those equations might be &-um important ? 5814735_5816135
&-um we haven't used this this equation but we've used these first two . 5816795_5819975
okay this one is just &-um if you plug this one into here if you set these two equal ? 5820095_5826835
okay +/.
+, then square it ? 5827755_5828815

do you want me to show you . 5835255_5835555

so you got +//.
I'm just gonna skip the squaring part and just gonna skip the squaring part and xxx four pi &-uh r@l squared over p@l squared right ?
bring that R over so now you just rewrite this so P is brought over here .
this equals four pi r@l squared now times another R divided by xxx which is that +/. 5847645_5859425

it's right on the back cover xxx right there xxx .

&-um Lisa and I are going on Wednesday I think to a performance xxx . 5924485_5925365

is that rude to ask her like what's your name ?
you &~kn I don't nobody anybody I've talked to nobody knows .
