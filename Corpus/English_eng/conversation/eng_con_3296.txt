uh, today let's summarize the results of the experiment we did yesterday, such as what happened to iodine and what happened to the benedict's solution . 8070_20090
and then, things we understand from these results . 20090_27290
one is what is learned from the iodine reaction . 27290_33020
two is what is learned from the benedict's solution reaction . 33020_37150
I want you to summarize these two . 37150_48000
I want you to discuss it in a group, but, don't form groups yet .
uh, based on your results, we will eventually have a class summary . 48000_54150
since it will be written down in your notebooks, please write the title of the experiment in your notebook . 54150_59030
now you are going to form groups and discuss, but there is one thing I want to confirm before that . 109240_115060
that is benedict's solution . 115060_120230
benedict's solution .
if we say benedict's solution, I think you all have it written down in your notebook but, what is it ? 120230_127070
benedict's solution . 127070_131150
which one is it ?
what is it used for ? 131150_135240
makoto .
how about you ?
benedict's solution . 135240_137290
what do you think ?
it's not written in my notebook . 137290_139130
it's not written in your notebook . 139130_143090
I see .
how about you, tsuyoshi ?
it is used to detect sugar . 143090_145160
right . 145160_152060
yes .
it is used to detect sugar .
what do we do with it, tsuyoshi ?
heat it . 152060_153010
yes . 153010_157050
heat it .
and then ?
what happens when we can tell that there is sugar ?
it turns red . 157050_158050
it turns red . 158050_159160
&=laughs . 159160_160160
when it turns red . 160160_163140
that's all right .
it is red anyway .
the material we used this time was a substance called starch, and the other one which will be detected by the benedict's solution is sugar, right ? 163140_167090
I would like to touch on these two items just to explain something . 175170_181090
the substance called starch in the second year, science division one, which we studied in the first semester . 181090_187010
all substances are made up of molecules . 187010_198070
we talked about things like this, or like this, that are all made up of molecules .
but starch is well, starch is also made up of molecules, but the molecules of starch are like this, long molecules, like this . 198070_214180
longer and longer .
long molecules .
at a glance, starch is a huge thing . 214180_221170
the molecules are long .
that's how it looks .
but on the other hand, sugar's molecule is short . 221170_235090
its molecule is short .
at a glance, the molecule is small compared to starch .
when we include these issues in our consideration, the discussion will be easier . 235090_241280
so, today, you will form groups . 241280_245180
uh, this . 245180_251080
this needs to be focused .
uh .
yes .
this is same as your report sheet . 251080_253290
summarize the result of your group, how the iodine reacted from a to d and how the benedict's solution changed . 253290_265090
four of you will summarize the results of groups one, two, three, four, etc . 265090_273020
after that, summarize the results .
one what we can study from the iodine reaction .
two what we can study from the enedict's solution . 273020_278030
four of you, or maybe if you have five people, the five of you think together and summarize it . 278030_284090
I will let you present it later .
all right, I will let you form groups . 284090_298060
go ahead .
unless you move it in this way . 298060_315080
this one is .
oh, like this .
that's good .
very good .
what were the results in this group ? 315080_318080
I have them written here . 318080_325230
I see . 325230_345010
that's good, right ? 345010_352000
this group is almost all at a good position .
what can we say from this ? 352000_356190
a and c are . 356190_363990
what is this ?
black ?
iodine does not become black in a reaction .
it was blackish, right ? 363990_364170
yeah . 364170_365010
bluish purple . 366990_367230
yes . 367230_369290
this is a stage in which the bluish purple is very dark .
dark purple . 369290_370240
teacher . 370240_371140
yes . 371140_372120
do we write down the things to consider ? 372120_373010
yes . 373010_376090
think about the things to consider .
think about the things to consider .
and this part . 376090_387140
these are supposed to have starch but .
they are pale purple or white .
not white, rather transparent, I think .
why did they become like that ? 387140_391140
that's what you should consider . 391140_394100
maybe because it cooled down . 394100_396040
tsk . 396040_402040
if iodine reaction it reacts to iodine, does it mean it has starch or not ?
it has . 402040_403010
it means it has starch, right ? 403010_413210
that means, in a and c, there is only starch to begin with, so it is natural that they are bluish purple .
it is b and d you have to think about . 413210_416130
in b and d, what else is in there besides starch ? 416130_419150
saliva . 419150_420040
saliva is in there . 420040_426180
because saliva did something to the starch, they became like this, right ?
became like this, right ? 426180_427210
that's what I want you to think about . 427210_428240
yes . 428240_430110
and what are the conditional difference in the experiment between b and d ? 430110_436070
what was the conditional difference between b and d ? 436070_437240
ice water . 438990_439180
ice water . 439180_440010
ice water . 440010_451240
this one is warm .
this one is cold .
from these differences summarize your results .
yes . 451240_452010
the bluish purple is no longer bluish purple . 452010_456080
that means the starch is ?
gone . 456080_457010
that means the starch is gone . 457010_462000
how ?
by hot water . 462000_463010
by hot water ? 463010_465010
how about this group ? 465010_469200
this group also had a good result . 469200_473290
but teacher, this one became pale reddish brown . 473290_479080
well, pale reddish brown is sort of okay . 479080_489210
they became a somewhat similar color, right ?
but this one is orange . 489210_497050
let me see . 497050_508260
look, does the fact that they became bluish purple they are bluish purple mean they have starch or not ?
they have . 508260_509190
they have, right ? 509190_510180
a and c only have starch . 510180_519000
since they have nothing but starch, it is natural that they become bluish purple .
but in b and d, especially b, the bluish purple became pale . 519000_528190
the fact that the bluish purple became pale means what happened to the starch ?
it dissolved . 528190_529090
it dissolved or, in other words, the starch is disappearing, right ? 529090_534010
in b and d, especially in b, what did we add ? 534010_539160
what did we add ? 539160_541290
what did we add to b ? 541290_542990
benedict's solution . 542990_543100
what ? 543100_544260
saliva . 544260_545200
we put spit in b . 545200_547990
spit, right ?
slimy saliva .
saliva . 547990_548090
that's what we added, right ? 548090_550040
then saliva is doing something to the starch . 550040_556260
it's all right to say dissolved or some kind of expression like that . 556260_569110
from that, saliva does what to the starch ?
right ? 569110_571290
oh, one more thing . 571290_580110
b and d are the same .
they both contain saliva and starch .
what is the conditional difference in the experiment ?
hot water and cold water . 580110_581290
that's right . 581290_582170
hot water and cold water .
teacher, that part is xxx . 582170_585010
huh ? 585010_588290
does this have a hole here ?
work hard . 588290_596180
if you include that, I think you will have a good summary of the study .
well, well . 596180_600250
what is it ? 600250_603180
this group's results . 603180_609160
this group's results are super .
you mean xxx ? 616170_618100
did I say a thing like that ? 618100_620020
no, no . 620020_621110
well, so . 621110_625260
should we look at it from here ?
well, a and c became all bluish purple, right ? 625260_631100
does that mean that there is starch or not ? 631100_635080
there is . 635080_636010
there is, right ? 636010_639000
from the beginning to the end, there is always starch in these .
but in b and d, a difference appeared . 639000_648220
in b and d, although both have starch, we added something special .
what was that ?
saliva . 648220_649010
saliva . 649010_659290
only those test tubes which have saliva have such a result .
especially b has a distinct change .
it did not turn to bluish purple .
that means what happened to the starch ?
there is none . 659290_660110
yes . 660110_663270
the starch disappeared .
the starch disappeared .
saliva blah blah blah . 663270_669020
the one which we warmed up . 669020_670110
yes, that's it . 670110_672160
a, b . 672160_673010
this is the one which we cooled down . 673010_674090
well noticed . 674090_681250
the conditional difference between b and d in this experiment is this one is warm, this one is cold .
if you compare the speed in which the starch disappears, which is faster, b or d ? 681250_686200
b . 686200_687030
b is faster . 687030_692200
that means .
xxx .
you must be able to figure it out .
hm ? 692200_693250
almost . 693250_694270
one more push ? 694270_696250
if you can summarize this result, you are in perfect shape . 696250_699150
very good . 699150_702280
very good .
okay, this group . 702280_709020
looks good, looks good, looks good . 709020_727230
good .
good .
when we looked at it . 727230_731050
everyone look, all right ?
a and c got all bluish purple, right ? 731050_740020
does that mean that there is starch or not ?
there is . 740020_741010
there is, right ? 741010_748250
because they turned to bluish purple .
a and c have starch only, so it is natural to have an iodine reaction .
but b and d . 748250_754240
especially in b, a change has occurred .
b has starch plus, like it is written here, saliva . 754240_759070
b's test tube which contains saliva changed from bluish purple to not changed to bluish purple . 759070_767150
it no longer turned to bluish purple, that means starch disappeared due to the saliva, right ? 767150_780050
it will be good if you can write things like that in the summary of the study . 780050_783070
in addition to that, this group noticed that in comparing b and d, d did not turn pale around here, did it ? 783070_793990
it may have . 793990_794240
it may have ? 794240_796200
around here, only here became pale . 796200_798270
it became pale ? 798270_808280
the conditional difference between b and d is the temperature, right ?
you noticed the difference in the temperature, right ?
that's a good point . 808280_818150
that's good .
in addition to that .
which one had benedict's solution .
oh, they became the same color ?
in that case, it will be difficult to write the summary of the study, huh ? 818150_822030
well, well, well, well, well . 822030_826180
look . 826180_839250
look .
these are the results of one group . 839250_848110
both of yours got this color ? 848110_854010
well, if your results are like that, you cannot write the summary of the study . 854010_861050
since they turned to the same color, you cannot compare .
this other group got these results . 861050_864240
why don't you think about it from these ?
only b is reacting . 864240_886000
we cannot say from this that a has reacted .
from these results, think about parenthesis two of the study .
only b has reacted .
how about this group ? 886000_890090
oh, nothing .
what happened ?
we don't understand . 890090_893020
we don't understand .
you don't understand . 893020_896020
well then should we do it together ?
you have nice results, you know ? 896020_900100
here we go .
a and c all turned to bluish purple, right ? 900100_904200
yes . 904200_905280
does that mean they have starch or not ? 905280_909110
they have . 909110_910000
they have, right ? 910000_912200
from the beginning to the end, they all have starch .
however, b and d, especially b here, lost its bluish purple color . 912200_920000
b has starch in it just as a and c, but it has something plus starch . 920000_925990
what does it have ?
saliva . 925990_926170
yes, saliva . 926170_940240
in the one which contains saliva, the bluish purple is no longer bluish purple .
that means, the starch .
got eliminated . 940240_941010
yes, yes . 941010_942270
something like that .
it got eliminated . 942270_951110
starch has disappeared .
you can conclude like that .
can we write the starch is gone ? 951110_952010
right, right . 952010_954190
expressing it like that is fine .
hm, that's fine . 954190_960010
that's fine . 960010_961220
that's fine . 961220_963010
the guys have written nothing . 963010_966210
I'm not a man ! 966210_968030
oh, I'm sorry . 968030_969130
next, how about the benedict's solution ? 969130_975120
it didn't turn reddish brown .
oh, I see .
you put benedict's solution in a and b, you put benedict's solution in a and b, and when you heat it, only b has reacted . 975120_982010
that means, what's in b ? 982010_983080
sugar . 983080_984010
sugar is in it . 984010_991150
that means .
as I said before .
the starch in b has disappeared because of the saliva, and what is made ?
sugar . 991150_993180
ohh . 993180_994150
wonderful . 994150_995010
starch has disappeared . 995010_995011
thank you . 995010_996180
you are welcome . 999160_1002100
how about this group ? 1002100_1004080
we have summarized most of it, even though we have not written yet . 1004080_1009240
this sentence is wrong though . 1009240_1011170
whose answer is right ? 1011170_1012210
I don't know whether this is right or not, but we are summarizing by talking, and I did most of the summarizing . 1012210_1018060
we were summarizing by talking . 1018060_1020010
so, shall we check ? 1020010_1021010
yes . 1021010_1022160
ah ! 1022160_1028220
these are wonderful results as well .
if you cannot summarize these results, you are .
yes . 1028220_1029010
nothing . 1029010_1031150
well, when we look at this, a and c are all purple, that means that the starch has reacted . 1031150_1041060
that means that there is starch in a and c till the end, right ?
but in b and d, the circles are colored red, which means that the starch has not reacted, iodine has not reacted, right ? 1041060_1047140
this means that in b and d, we put starch and saliva, but due to the function of saliva, starch has blah blah blahed, has blah blah blahed . 1047140_1060110
what is it ?
dissolved . 1060110_1061010
yeah, dissolved . 1061010_1071000
in normal language, it has disappeared .
we can understand that starch has disappeared due to the function of saliva .
then, what is the difference in the experimental conditions of b@l and d@l ? 1071000_1074000
temperature . 1074000_1075070
temperature . 1075070_1076280
b@l is ?
uh, forty degrees . 1076280_1077010
body temperature . 1077010_1078000
close to the body temperature . 1078000_1078001
yes body temperature, and d@l is ? 1078000_1079070
ice water . 1079070_1079071
it's cold . 1079070_1080010
which has a faster rate of change in which starch becomes no longer starch, b or d ? 1080010_1086150
b . 1086150_1087000
b is faster . 1087000_1093000
that means that saliva's rate of effect on starch is .
the temperature ?
faster when it is closer to the body temperature . 1093000_1094160
ahh, wonderful . 1094160_1098070
that's perfect .
we said that before . 1098070_1099180
in addition to that, which one becomes red brown ? 1099180_1104220
b . 1104220_1105010
b . 1105010_1111170
that means that while saliva changed the starch, what other than starch was made ?
sugar . 1111170_1112030
ah . 1112030_1113990
kenji .
yes . 1113990_1114120
you have good friends . 1114120_1115230
yes . 1115230_1116990
are we friends ? 1116990_1117100
how about this group ? 1117100_1118270
I didn't know that we were friends . 1118270_1124240
are you writing now ? 1124240_1130110
let me check it . 1130110_1137990
let me see .
let me take a look at takashi's .
this one, too . 1137990_1138270
we did not do the first one . 1138270_1139220
oh, you didn't do the first one . 1139220_1140290
this one, too . 1140290_1144140
ohh, it became reverse . 1144140_1159250
umm, what I want to check with you is that when they are bluish purple, when they are bluish purple .
does this mean they have starch or not ?
they have . 1159250_1160090
they have, right ? 1160090_1164020
when they are not bluish purple, the starch is ?
not there . 1164020_1165010
not there . 1165010_1172000
consider that .
when we compare b and d, in both cases the starch disappears . 1172000_1175140
because of what ? 1175140_1179030
in b and d, there is starch plus what ?
saliva . 1179030_1180010
there is saliva . 1180010_1189280
you have to figure out what the saliva did .
in addition to that, what was the conditional difference between b and d ?
temperature . 1189280_1190120
temperature . 1190120_1191990
b is ?
forty degrees . 1191990_1192250
forty degrees . 1192250_1196180
d ?
cold . 1196180_1197130
cold . 1197130_1198020
that means that . 1198020_1207000
saliva works differently depending on the temperature .
what was that ?
you see that saliva works differently, right, depending on the temperature . 1207000_1210080
and then, reddish brown . 1210080_1219100
orange .
oh, both changed .
then it is hard to write the summary .
because you cannot proceed to the conclusion when you have the same reaction this is from a different group by the way only b has reacted . 1231130_1242270
only b became reddish brown .
a did not react . 1242270_1253070
I hope that you can come to a conclusion from this result .
right ?
what is it, nishi+kun ? 1253070_1254190
I don't understand it . 1254190_1256100
okay . 1256100_1257160
this group is left . 1257160_1259230
yes . 1259230_1262190
what should we write in number two ? 1262190_1264190
is it because starch is made, that sugar is made ? 1264190_1270120
no, is it because the starch has disappeared, that sugar is made ?
in the beginning of the class look at that the result of breaking up the long chain of starch is sugar . 1270120_1282190
is it sugar because the long chain has been broken up ? 1282190_1285020
sugar is the result of what was originally big becoming small . 1285020_1289110
sugar .
it is part of starch .
part of starch is sugar ? 1289110_1294050
because starch disappeared, sugar is made ?
well, you may say it in that way . 1294050_1296250
what is the best way to say it ? 1296250_1299170
well, we will summarize that at the end . 1299170_1304010
then, this group last . 1304010_1306240
how is it ?
sorry, sorry . 1307150_1316210
which one ?
okay, okay, you got the results . 1316210_1324290
in this group, a and c are all bluish purple .
that means, do these have starch or not ?
they do . 1324290_1325260
they all have starch, right ? 1325260_1329050
because they have only starch in them .
but b and d are no longer just bluish purple . 1329050_1340080
so when we look at it, as time passes, does the bluish purple get lighter or darker ?
lighter . 1340080_1341010
it gets lighter, right ? 1341010_1345130
what's in b and d besides the starch ?
what is it ?
sugar . 1345130_1346180
right . 1346180_1347060
what ?
sugar ?
not sugar . 1347060_1348010
saliva . 1348010_1349010
saliva . 1349010_1352100
hideki's saliva was real gooey .
gooey ? 1352100_1354130
that means, do b and d have or not have starch at one point ? 1354130_1359230
they do not . 1359230_1360070
they do not . 1360070_1365020
starch is .
because of what effect ?
saliva's effect . 1365020_1366010
that's right . 1366010_1382040
due to hideki's saliva, starch has .
disappeared .
that's what you should write .
let me see .
in addition to that, what is the conditional difference between b and d ? 1382040_1385990
ice . 1385990_1386260
right . 1386260_1387080
ice and hot water . 1387080_1388070
yes, hot water . 1388070_1389990
which one is hot water ?
b . 1389990_1390140
b . 1390140_1392240
what about d ?
ice . 1392240_1393270
yes . 1393270_1399000
are these the same ?
oh, these are exactly the same .
I see .
then it is hard to write about the different temperature . 1399000_1404050
okay, then you can write only this part .
you can summarize the part that due to saliva, starch became no longer starch . 1404050_1408200
lastly, benedict's solution . 1408200_1411200
it's good .
only in b, only in b, has benedict's solution reacted . 1411200_1422160
this means that in b the starch has disappeared and what was made instead ?
sugar . 1422160_1424130
it will be good if you can summarize that part . 1424130_1430010
okay ?
all right, since it has taken a long time, I would like to listen to each group's result now . 1430010_1441280
so, be ready to listen to everyone .
now, everyone's ayamoto+san, okay ? 1441280_1458000
I will ask the results of each group .
first, how the iodine reacted ?
for example, a was like this, b was like that .
or a and c were the same . 1458000_1461280
it will be good if you can present the results in that way .
rock, paper, scissors . 1461280_1468190
rock, paper, scissors will do .
and number two . 1468190_1475000
benedict's solution .
we added benedict's solution to a and b and heated them .
please describe what happened . 1475000_1477230
up to this point are the results .
the conclusion is next . 1477230_1484120
first, I will ask you about the results .
I think I first want to ask you about the results .
where should I start ? 1484120_1495040
the results .
shall we start here ? 1495040_1500040
there ?
there ?
over there ?
group four, shall we ? 1500040_1510220
okay .
I see .
let's start with group four .
it doesn't matter where we start .
all right, please tell us your results .
please listen . 1510220_1516990
hey, ayamoto, this is the second time .
please go ahead . 1516990_1517120
a, b . 1517120_1522030
oops .
a, c, and d were bluish purple the whole way through .
b became paler little by little .
yes . 1522030_1525090
from which point did it start getting pale ? 1525090_1526250
from about the third one, it started getting paler . 1526250_1530040
yes . 1530040_1544040
yes .
a, c and d are all bluish purple, but .
oh, please don't sit down yet .
b started getting paler from about the third one .
that was the report .
and how about the benedict's solution ? 1544040_1548150
the benedict's solution in test tube a did not turn to reddish brown . 1548150_1554130
yes . 1554130_1555240
b changed from blue to green, and when we kept heating it, it turned to reddish brown . 1555240_1561220
that was a wonderful way to say that . 1561220_1568000
it turned from blue to green, and when it kept being heating, it turned to reddish brown .
so, in other words, b reacted . 1568000_1571200
I see .
well then, group five . 1571200_1582040
please report your results .
go ahead . 1582040_1588210
you only have to say it . 1588210_1591070
a . 1591070_1606140
the first one was bluish purple .
did not change, does that mean that it was bluish purple ? 1606140_1608240
yes . 1608240_1609040
then ? 1609040_1611130
and the fifth one was xxx . 1611130_1614200
the fifth one ? 1614200_1621130
did you just jump to the fifth ?
huh ?
it became weaker and weaker . 1621130_1623200
a got weaker and weaker ? 1623200_1631030
huh ?
is it reversed ?
wait a minute . 1631030_1636090
in which ones did you put saliva and starch ?
b and d . 1636090_1637110
b and d . 1637110_1645260
you put saliva in b and d, but a's color changed from purple to a weak purple, is that right ?
I see .
and then ?
and b started losing its color after three minutes . 1645260_1651120
this one, too, started losing its color ? 1651120_1655070
yes . 1655070_1656010
I see . 1656010_1660090
then ?
c . 1660090_1667070
didn't change at all .
all bluish purple . 1667070_1670030
and ?
d . 1670030_1675210
the color got weaker after five minutes .
the rest did not change .
the rest of the part were bluish purple . 1677110_1686080
I see .
then what about the benedict's solution ?
a became dark green, and b was reddish brown . 1686080_1688180
yes . 1688180_1692040
ah, so only b reacted . 1692040_1705240
I see .
group five has reported that a seemed to become pale, too .
I see .
then, group six, please .
I see . 1717270_1719220
okay .
d was bluish purple for about three minutes, and after that it slowly turned pale . 1719220_1728040
I see . 1728040_1732030
then, what about the benedict's solution ?
a and b both became reddish brown . 1732030_1736000
I see, I see . 1736000_1746140
both of them became reddish brown .
I see .
okay, group seven, please .
a and c and d were all bluish purple, and b started off bluish purple and became lighter . 1746140_1756010
from what point did it start getting lighter ? 1756010_1757290
from the beginning . 1757290_1759120
oh, I see, it got lighter from the beginning . 1759120_1765290
I see .
then what about the benedict's solution ?
test tube a was pale reddish brown . 1765290_1770080
yes . 1770080_1771010
and b, dark reddish brown . 1771010_1774260
I see . 1774260_1794290
well .
which one is the closest ?
this one I believe .
please take a look at this .
this one is the same test results of students like you I wonder which class it was ? 1794290_1800000
class four, class five, or class three ?
the results of students like you in those classes . 1800000_1805240
although we heard slightly different test results in this class, basically a and c are all bluish purple . 1805240_1826210
the reason is that we put only starch in a and c, right ?
so there is only starch and although the temperature is different, the starch remains starch from beginning to end . 1826210_1835200
so, many of you have reported that the bluish purple continued all the way, although some have reported that it got pale around here . 1835200_1845280
the question is b and d . 1845280_1849000
the question is b and d .
there is saliva in the starch in b and d . 1849000_1861050
we see a reaction in both b and d; that is, their color eventually gets lighter .
does that mean there is starch or not ? 1861050_1865010
it's disappearing . 1865010_1866010
it's disappearing, right ? 1866010_1876280
it doesn't, right ?
it is disappearing .
the reason why is probably because we put saliva in them .
that leads to our conclusion .
in addition to that, when we look at b and d more carefully, the rate that saliva disappears, no, sorry, the rate that starch disappears, when we compare b and d, which is faster ? 1876280_1886290
b . 1886290_1887180
b is faster, right ? 1887180_1893260
b is faster .
what was the conditional difference between b and d ?
temperature . 1893260_1894230
temperature . 1894230_1901100
b is .
warm .
as warm as body temperature .
d is cold .
when we compare these, this one works the best, and I think that it will be good if you can include things like that in the conclusion . 1901100_1911270
and then there was such group . 1911270_1921010
not this one, this one .
this one also has similar results, right ? 1921010_1929080
a and c have only starch, so they are bluish purple all the way through .
they put saliva in b and d, but in b, after about two minutes there was already no reaction for starch . 1929080_1938040
there was no starch at this point . 1938040_1940150
in d, the reaction to starch got weaker and weaker, and there was no starch at this point, then it revived . 1940150_1952290
I don't get this .
I wish this one weren't here .
but we see the color got weaker and weaker . 1952290_1957290
then there is this one . 1957290_1962200
this one is amazing .
we discovered a new type of human .
do you see ? 1964290_1977270
a and c are okay .
in b, it suddenly disappeared here .
more over in d, the starch suddenly disappeared here .
I won't say whose it was . 1977270_1980090
it was hiroshi wakai's .
all right . 1982090_1991060
anyway, all you need to understand is in b and d, the starch has changed to something else .
in addition to that, we added benedict's solution . 1991060_1997190
we put benedict's solution in a and b .
look at this . 1997190_2002240
I think it should react and become something like this .
a has only starch in it . 2002240_2006080
from this color, we cannot say it has reacted, when we put this against a florescent light and look at it through the light . 2006080_2014050
this one did . 2014050_2021040
it got thicker and became reddish brown .
it is the color of carrot juice .
when it reacts like this, we can judge that there is sugar in it . 2021040_2030120
actually, there seems to be sugar in b .
I wish to include this content in our conclusion . 2030120_2036270
first, the conclusions from the results of the iodine reaction . 2036270_2055110
second, the conclusions from the results of the benedict's solution .
these two .
can you present them ?
we had eye contact . 2055110_2064140
group eight ?
please .
the iodine reaction: when saliva is mixed with starch, it becomes no longer starch . 2064140_2070090
yes . 2070090_2071010
and the rate in which starch disappears is faster when we heat it . 2071010_2074280
mm, mm, mm . 2074280_2076160
concerning the reaction to benedict's solution, when starch is mixed with saliva, sugar is formed . 2076160_2082010
mm . 2082010_2083250
that's it . 2083250_2084210
mm, that's it ? 2084210_2092260
I see .
that's good .
that's good .
that's good .
next, group one . 2092260_2101990
can you do it ?
ryuutaro ? 2101990_2102170
or takashi ?
is only the first point, okay ? 2102170_2103150
huh ? 2103150_2104010
the first point . 2104010_2105010
only the first point . 2105010_2108180
that's fine .
since the conclusion is difficult .
okay, go ahead .
the starch in b was dissolved by the saliva little by little . 2123180_2135110
yes .
yes .
that's fine .
when we compare a and b, we can see that in b, in which saliva was added, the starch has dissolved little by little .
okay .
that's fine .
okay, group two . 2135110_2138050
what do you mean by, “uh” ? 2141150_2143270
human's saliva has a function of dissolving starch . 2143270_2156200
and the closer its temperature is to body temperature, the faster the rate .
b oops the second point is that the human saliva has the function of changing starch into sugar . 2156200_2168190
haa . 2168190_2172130
I am amazed .
wonderful .
actually, I am the one who summarized it . 2172130_2173130
I see . 2177120_2184270
that was a nice presentation .
it was very logical, good conclusion .
then, how about the group three ?
yes . 2184270_2185010
yes . 2185010_2187040
in terms of the reaction with iodine, the one with saliva became less and less starchy . 2187040_2194040
yes . 2194040_2195010
then, in terms of the reaction with benedict's solution, by adding saliva, starch became sugar . 2195010_2206100
yes . 2206100_2211000
I think it's very good .
this was also a nice presentation, don't you think ?
I think it's good .
well then, I will summarize each group's presentation into sentences, so please write them down in your notebook . 2211000_2223120
I think we can summarize like this .
summary saliva has the function of dissolving starch into sugar . 2223120_2273020
saliva's function of dissolving the starch into sugar works best when the temperature is close to body temperature . 2273020_2352260
oh, maybe it is hard to see . 2352260_2360200
should I lower this ?
teacher, I think the ohp is not very useful . 2360200_2362220
what are you talking about ? 2362220_2365990
I pointed to them like this .
isn't it faster to use that one ? 2365990_2366080
rather than using the heavy ohp ?
no, you don't understand it . 2366080_2379140
because of this everyone understood well .
well, don't say that .
ok, did everyone finish writing ? 2379140_2382120
um, from this experiment, we can see these two things, as you all noticed . 2382120_2389170
the first one is that saliva seems to have the function of changing starch into something else . 2389170_2397020
saliva may have a function which changes starch into something else . 2397020_2403250
moreover, from the iodine reaction and benedict's solution's reaction, starch into something else so, what is it ? 2403250_2417000
sugar .
we wonder if there is a function of changing starch into sugar .
as I said in the beginning of the class, starch is a long chain . 2417000_2426230
a long molecule .
at a glance, it is a huge molecule .
but sugar is a small molecule . 2426230_2444010
a short chain .
from this, we understand that saliva has the function of breaking a big chain of starch into a small chain of sugar .
next, the second point . 2444010_2453100
I think we understand that saliva works best when the temperature is close to body temperature . 2453100_2464020
all right, please open your textbooks to page ninety four . 2464020_2476200
there will be a part you should underline .
so be prepared and listen .
all right, we will start . 2476200_2483260
page ninety four .
after “from experiment two” please underline . 2483260_2487120
+" starch is dissolved by saliva and changes into sugar . 2487120_2502140
+" please underline up to this point .
+" starch is dissolved by saliva and changes into sugar .
next you don't have to underline . 2502140_2512090
+" also, because this sugar's molecule is smaller than starch, it can go through cellophane membrane .
+" okay, underline after this .
+" other than saliva, such fluids as gastric juice and pancreatic juice, which have the function of digesting food, are called digestive fluid . 2512090_2523260
+" underline up to here .
next . 2523260_2526210
this will be a long one too .
+" in digestive fluid . 2526210_2532100
“underline here” in digestive fluid, there are different kinds of digestive enzymes .
+" under appropriate temperature it dissolves components in food and changes them into nourishment which is easily absorbed . 2532100_2542250
mm . 2542250_2546000
our textbooks are all marked with red now .
the next section too . 2546000_2550160
this is all important .
this page will be all marked with red .
sorry .
underline the next section .
+" digestive enzymes in gastric juice work on protein, and so on . 2555180_2567240
+" underline up to here .
it was a long explanation, but I will summarize for you to write in your notebooks . 2567240_2580220
since it is hard to understand otherwise .
digestive fluid . 2580220_2644190
fluid which has the function of digesting food .
example: saliva, gastric juice, etc .
digestive enzymes have specific food components to dissolve . 2644190_2768050
can you see it ? 2772080_2811190
I wonder whether people can see at the bottom . 2811190_2815130
chiho, can you see this ?
can you see this ? 2815130_2816990
can you see ? 2817190_2821080
sorry .
can you see this part, gastric juice ? 2821080_2822990
yes . 2822990_2823200
you can . 2823200_2842010
sorry .
this is very low .
are you all right ? 2842010_2861140
oh, I should underline here .
today's topic, saliva . 2861140_2868260
which has the function of dissolving starch into sugar .
saliva .
saliva is called digestive fluid . 2868260_2877240
digestive fluid .
fluid to dissolve starch into sugar .
saliva is digestive fluid .
fluid which digests food is called digestive fluid . 2877240_2887180
digestive fluid is not only saliva .
there is gastric juice which is in the stomach .
when you throw up, you have a sour taste in your mouth . 2887180_2900210
that's gastric juice .
go deeper down and we have pancreatic juice in the pancreas, or bile in the gallbladder, and so on .
we call these fluids, which digest food, “digestive fluids” . 2900210_2911230
+" in addition, in the digestive fluids, there are digestive enzymes .
we read this as “enzymes” . 2911230_2918050
you didn't write “oxygen” in your notebook, did you ?
are you okay ? 2918050_2925060
it's not oxygen .
it's enzymes .
okay ?
chinese characters ?
in digestive fluid, there are digestive enzymes . 2925060_2936230
these digestive enzymes are determined by the food components they dissolve .
for example, saliva works only on starch, which we experimented with this time . 2936230_2941200
you must have learned in home science .
five major nutrient categories . 2941200_2952060
protein, fat .
there are many nutrient categories, but saliva only works on starch .
and gastric juice in the stomach, which I mentioned before, works only on protein . 2952060_2959190
such digestive enzymes which have specific functions are included in digestive fluids . 2959190_2967240
this is a little bit difficult, so we will look at this in detail in the next lesson . 2967240_2975010
all right, we will finish today's lesson, but please turn in your report . 2975010_2983140
all right, that's it .
