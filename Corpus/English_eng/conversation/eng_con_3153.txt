these pages in your book . 22020_23140
you won't color . 23180_23830
you'll glue construction paper on in the right arrangement . 23880_26780
once you can show me what it's gonna look like with your colored
then you'll get to glue paper on to match your plan . 30750_32630
do you just draw . 33970_34530
all those little quote things that are on the cover . 34740_37190
