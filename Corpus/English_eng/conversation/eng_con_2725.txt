Okay folks 0_708
&=FOOTSTEPS_AND_AMBIENT_CROWD_NOISE . 4087_94800
Okay folks 94800_95277
(..) We got on the elevator right here 96340_98341
&=in And you're now standing over the second largest water pipe in
(..) More about that a little bit later . 112169_113829
&=in The Colorado River 113829_115576
&=in In order to build a dam here 116871_118334
&=in So they came up here above where the dam was to be built 121498_124062
&=in Two on either si:de 127057_128712
&=in Each one of these tunnels were drilled and blasted out at
&=in You're now standing in one of those old diversion tunnels . 139037_141740
(..) &=in They then came up here 141740_143063
&=in Came back down here 148081_149225
&=in They now had from he:re 155578_157284
&=in They pumped the water out of this area 159045_161085
&=in Okay folks 164614_165550
&=in Each one of those forms are exactly five feet high 174694_177381
(..) And it's called an arch gravity design dam . 186624_189457
&=in Where the force of the water 189457_190965
&=in It's a very strong design . 197085_199179
(..) They did build two concrete mixing plants here 199179_202265
&=in For two years 208020_209282
&=in Now every bit of that concrete came down in individual
&=in Eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms 215743_218384
&=in So there goes that story you may have hea:rd 224279_226543
Couldn't possibly happen . 228852_230385
&=in But what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete 230385_233313
&=in They came down here in this lower cofferda:m 235110_237513
Capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day . 239354_242284
&=in They used that ice 242284_243653
&=in As concrete ha:rdens 247705_249241
(..) The more you can control that heat 251867_254000
&=in So they used the chilled water method 256033_257910
&=in They felt if they did not use a method such as this 265191_268036
&=in So the system did work . 274952_276454
(..) And then it hardened 276454_277555
Vertically and horizontally these forms came together 280185_282380
Under high pressure . 284248_285215
(..) Grout being a mixture of concrete and water . 285215_287452
(..) &=in When this is done 287452_288601
(..) &{l=MRC Six point six million tons of concrete &}l=MRC . 305229_309063
(..) That's enough concrete to build a two-lane highway &=in from
(..) O:r 313871_314562
&=in Then they had to protect that concrete a little bit 318459_320785
&=in As you got out of your cars or your busses this afternoon 323728_326260
&=in Here they are 327816_328543
&=in What they did 329686_330808
&=in Underneath that lake out there 339126_340500
&=in But they did incorporate 341699_343281
&=in Now these spillways were built 349996_351582
&=in This assures us that n- any excess water coming down the
&=in Each one of these spillways is capable of handling &=in two
&=in That's the same amount of water that goes over Niagara
&=in &{l=X Falls &}l=X three times higher than Niagara Falls does 377856_380358
(..) &=in Okay we have protected the spillways 386764_389016
(..) What they did is they built four intake towers . 392095_394626
&=in Two on either side of the &=in river 394626_396714
(..) Each with two-eleven-by-thirty-two-foot gates in them 403271_406446
&=in The water then coming into the penstocks 410212_412273
(..) &=in This penstock 414182_415438
&=in Made in section twenty-two feet long . 422963_425360
Each section weighing approximately &=in a hundred and fifty
&=in Each of these twenty-two-foot sections is joined to the next
&=in The water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon 434021_436874
(..) &=in Okay we have the water this far 440220_442000
(..) &=in The force of the water turns the turbine 446814_449295
(..) The water then coming on the tailrace 452411_454564
&=in Good clean reusable nonpolluting source of energy . 461963_465736
(..) &=tsk &=in The cost of the project . 465736_468306
(..) A hundred and seventy-five million dollars . 468306_470889
(..) I say project 470889_472143
&=in This money was borrowed on a fifty-year term at three-percent
(..) The people who worked here 494174_496063
&=in The most they had at any one time was when they were pouring
(..) &=in The laborers on the job made fifty cents an hour . 506385_509793
&=in Highest paid man on the project was a power shovel operator 509793_513058
(..) &=in Out of each man's paycheck 515007_516603
&=in Because the contractor was feeding 520771_522825
(..) They did have ninety-six industrial deaths . 527524_531020
The biggest single category of death was classified as falling
&=in Basically falling rock . 534561_536187
(..) But they did have some killed by explosion 536187_538607
&=in On a job of this magnitude . 543769_545348
(..) They did complete the project 545348_547457
&=in Started in early nineteen thirty-one 549663_551606
&=in Just twelve days short of five years . 553783_556139
(..) &=in Do I have any questions . 556139_558082
(..) What's this overhead pipe here X . 558082_560585
&=in The overhead pipe . 560585_561630
&=in That's the fresh air pipe . 561630_562837
&=in (..) In the summerti:me 562837_564928
&=in So they bring that fresh air i:n 567904_569449
&=in It cools that air down to between sixty-eight and seventy-two
&=in So it's ʔair-conditioning without refrigeration . 580516_582699
Like a big evaporative cooler or swamp cooler . 582699_584650
(..) Any other questions . 584650_586590

(..) Yes . 595885_596524
W- v- we have several things . 596524_597836
First place we have three seismographs throughout the dam . 597836_600112
&=in We recorded those 600112_601070
&=in But we do have sensors 602219_603664
(..) And they had very little of it this morning . 607860_609850
Very little . 609850_610593
(..) Any other questions . 610593_612879
(..) How far are you sending electricity . 612879_614699
California ? 614699_615337
Okay . 615337_615836
Fifty-six percent of our power goes to southern California 615836_618470
&=in What the government did 622490_623682
&=in To allocate the power that would be generated here when this dam
&=in California was growing very fast at that time 630226_632697
&=in But by the same token 634359_635872
&=in No hotels 641474_642504
(..) But that's all they get today . 648466_650096
&=in Because that contract is good through the year two-th:ousand and
&=in So all those lights . 653777_655098
