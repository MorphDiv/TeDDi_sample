&~www .
&-um yesterday I found a frog .
so I brought it home .
<and it was> and I put it in a jar .
&-um but when I went to sleep the frog escaped .
when I woke up in the morning , I realized that the frog wasn't
and I searched everywhere .
and then my dog got his head stuck in the pot where it was in .
and I was calling out_of the window .
and my dog fell out the window .
and the jar smashed .
then me and my dog went looking for it .
so I was calling in the woods .
I went in the woods .
and I looked in a hole and a +/.
&~www .
+, like an animal like hit me on the nose .
and I carried on looking .
and I climbed in a tree .
&-um my dog got chased by some bees .
&-um I went near some rocks .
and I was looking up .
&-um <a deer> I got on a deer's head .
and it chased my dog .
and I fell down into a pond .
and I heard some noise .
so I climbed over a log and found a frog family .
where I found my frog and went home .
