&-um the tip of up to date . 58150_59510
I mean it's just it's . 59850_61650
just wait . 62460_62830
why is it on there you just . 62850_63880
entering a new tip . 64010_64530
down . 64610_64730
why is it in there . 64870_65400
twice . 65450_65710
what what go to dating tips . 66270_68030
why is tip the date in there . 68590_69640
because this is actually it's the same in sort of . 69990_73230
form . 73250_73580
is it in the same database . 73730_74720
yeah . 74880_75010
if that's why . 75510_76110
mhm . 76130_76290
&-uh . 76590_76600
it's sort of the same makes it easier for us . 77280_79110
plus it allows like users to sort of &-uh sort of check the
okay . 87300_87410
and find out is there way . 87840_89640
it's actually just 'cause we were lazy . 90560_91480
so you can't update the tip update on the life on . 92410_95700
yes you can see . 96160_97250
the only thing is we have edit the top . 97270_98680
we need to space . 99090_100580
do you wanna do update profiles . 101970_103320
okay . 103880_104060
okay . 104110_104260
do you wanna do that . 104850_105370
page together . 105390_106010
sure . 106480_106570
Tanvir and I will do this . 107960_108700
no . 110090_110260
no profile for that . 111020_111850
yeah . 112140_112240
we basically list we basically have to create a dynamic list of the
and then be able to just click on a and and then update . 117110_119210
yeah . 119340_119460
do that . 120210_120540
&-um I'll work with you guys . 121360_122500
no . 124210_124270
it's gonna be you might have . 124490_125760
fuck you . 126430_126710
you're doing something alone . 127430_128210
okay . 128500_128720
fine . 128789_128910
tell me what to do . 128990_129580
do the you . 129970_130470
guys might have to 'cause you're gonna have to play around with
otherwise you're gonna overwrite your own authorization . 136070_138010
and you &-uh oh do editing 'cause the way we have profiles &-um
is that it it basically when the members click on edit profile
right it just takes the session variable username . 148940_151820
and and make sure they're like authenticated . 152450_154690
and then find finds out their information . 154710_156970
yeah . 157260_157330
but then but once you're logged in as Admin Admin you don't
no session username is still the Admin's username . 160800_163460
so you can't use that variable when you're accessing the &-um the
yeah . 168660_168860
so we don't really need it . 168950_169620
so you probably will have to . 169810_170860
oh yeah I guess you can just pass . 171160_172500
yeah . 172690_172880
we can . 172950_173100
just yeah . 173150_173310
you can pass variables around <that that> that probably would
yeah yeah . 176260_177690
so that should be fine . 178110_178740
hello . 181040_181140
&-um
