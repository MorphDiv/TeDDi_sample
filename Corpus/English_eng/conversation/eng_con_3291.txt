yes . 17800_18990
of course you can .

tony, we need to get that test of yours done again too some time . 20910_28080
all right ?
when are you ready for it ?
um . 28080_30920
did you take the ah did you take something home last night to study ? 30920_36870
you didn't .
no, you've got to get yourself organised . 36870_43810
adam, that's not on .
all right . 43810_44820
mr . 44820_45930
brown .
can I please go get my book ?
yeah, hurry up ah, walter . 45930_51890
okay . 51890_62980
now let's just look at where we're at .
yesterday you know very well what we did .
okay, liam, how about you telling me what we did what we finished off doing yesterday .
keep going . 69070_70040
and we were doing, last lesson we were studying the layers of paint . 70040_75060
okay . 75060_76800
different colors and pigments . 76800_78800
and so what did you learn what did you learn from that ? 78800_82910
karen .
I don't know colors ? 82910_85910
sorry ? 85910_86980
lots of different colors . 86980_88880
oh, okay, fine . 88880_93860
lots of different colours .
all right .
do you agree daniel ?
yes, I agree . 93860_95800
okay . 95800_98860
stop being so formal by the way .
okay, so yesterday you had the microscope . 98860_105890
you looked at the paint chips .
the previous day you looked at the hairs under the microscope and you looked at the different fibers . 105890_109800
okay, but yesterday's class went very well because you in fact all of you were able to get very, very good microscope shots of the different layers of paint . 109800_120030
today, as I I talked to you yesterday, we are going to do an activity on fingerprinting . 120030_125820
all right .
um, fingerprinting, it's actually contained in the in this in this book here that both Mister Hathaway and Miss Moller are co+authors . 125820_134060
of um, the pages, we start on page &~er, page fourteen and &~er, page I'd better get the page right, haven't i . 134060_141060
page fourteen on fingerprints . 141060_147870
what we're going to do, we're going to do a couple of activities .
we're going to do you're going to make fingerprints, you're actually going to take your own fingerprints . 147870_152000
you are going to examine those fingerprints under a hand lens . 152000_157850
you'll actually then put them in your book, so you've got a permanent record in your own science book of your own fingerprints . 157850_164830
ah, there's soap and towels up the back there so you can wash your hands after doing that . 164830_174860
there are some questions .
I don't know if you'll have time to answer those questions today .
um, the next activity we've got a fair bit to do . 174860_180810
the second one will be dusting for fingerprints .
okay ? 180810_188010
now, in that we've got a whole series of different surfaces .
they're up behind liam and allison there .
there are different surfaces . 188010_200920
if you just turn around this way for a moment please .
the paper here is to stop getting ah, all the powder on the desk .
there are different surfaces . 200920_210900
you've got these porcelain, a nice hard porcelain surface that you can put a print on .
um, you've got paper, you can do a print with paper . 210900_217930
you can do a print put a print on this .
now, the point is that once once you touch something, what what happens when you ah, when you touch something ? 217930_222890
puts a fingerprint on it . 222890_223800
sorry, ally ? 223800_223809
puts a fingerprint on it . 223800_225090
okay . 225090_228000
why does it leave a fingerprint on it, ally ?
sweat ? 228000_233010
oil ?
everything ?
grease . 233010_236870
sorry, adam .
no, nothing . 236870_237970
I was just .
okay . 237970_239930
that's all right .
you can say it .
no . 239930_241020
all right, so, you leave grease and that oi oils behind . 241020_252020
and therefore, what we're going to do is try to get something to stick to those oils to make it visible .
well, we've got two types of ah powder . 252020_254060
we've got talcum powder there, like a salt shaker really . 254060_265820
and we've also got carbon powder there .
we've also got some brushes .
why would we use the ah why would I have why would I have two different sorts of powder ? 265820_271080
samuel ?
sorry ? 272010_272020
to see what the difference is . 272020_275870
yeah . 275870_277070
for different surfaces . 277070_278930
okay . 278930_282940
so for this for example, what am I going to use on this if I wanted to see the print ?
black . 282940_283810
yeah, exactly . 283810_287060
so to do with the the contrast .
and then when you've done that, hopefully that'll you've got a brush there so you can you can brush it very gently . 287060_292850
you can take the sticky tape, put it over the print, over the surface, put the sticky tape over it, then when you lift off the sticky tape what should happen ? 300020_308840
the print should come with it . 308840_310000
the print should come with it and you can ah, stick that into your book . 310000_313020
okay .
now, um, I want to do one other thing, I want to show you another technique that I don't want you to do, but in fact this one here is, if I've got a rough surface . 313020_327090
and for example um, a piece of rough paper, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to put a print on it like that, okay . 327090_338870
now, that's a rough surface . 338870_351820
it's not easy to get a print on it .
I'm going to show you another technique .
I'm going to put this in here .
I'm now going to go over to the fume wood because I'm going I'm using a compound, a chemical iodine . 351820_361930
and . 361930_369820
its vapours are a little bit ah unpleasant, so that's why I'm putting it in here .
I'm just putting a couple of things of iodine in there . 369820_379010
iodine is a solid, but just like dry ice, what did dry ice do when it ah ?
it melted . 379010_380950
did it melt ? 380950_383030
oh, it went away . 383030_384070
it let off gases . 384070_385060
it went straight from a solid to ? 385060_386880
gas . 386880_387050
yeah . 387050_392900
iodine is exactly the same .
it goes straight from a solid to a gas .
and so, what I'm going to do and as it turns into a gas, um, the iodine molecules will actually stick to the ah the paper, and should make them ah visible . 392900_404970
anyway, we'll see by the end of the period . 404970_407970
okay .
what I want you to do for just a a couple of minutes is look over what we have to do I know we looked over it a little bit yesterday . 407970_414990
look over what we have to do on, ah, pages fourteen through to seventeen . 414990_421030
ah, sorry, sixteen . 421030_433970
and ah, just for a moment, have a look over that then in a couple of minutes we'll actually get started on the activities .
okay .
don't read in detail, just just overview it . 433970_439060
you okay ? 439060_439980
yeah . 439980_440820
do you have to write anything up ? 440820_442820
um, yeah, you'll need to put a heading in your book, ron, yes . 442820_462830
ah, fingerprinting .
just under where we did the paint chips .
right .
and ron .
spit it in the bin please .
okay . 462830_479000
what's wrong ? 479000_482800
I'm just laughing at adam . 482800_483830
oh right . 483830_483980
can you read it for me ? 483980_487040
you read very well, adam . 487040_491800
heh ?
sir, xxx . 491800_498870
sorry ? 498870_499090
do you want us to write what you've got on the board ? 499090_501050
ah, no, I don't want you to write what I've got on the board there . 501050_508880
that's just for you to refer to .
it's pretty bad ! 508880_509010

up to you now .
how many can we work in ? 641030_642820

is there any more ink ? 733010_735880
ink ?
ah, oh there should be a whole heap of ink pads . 735880_740930
there should be enough between one ink pad between four people .
yeah, they're just there .
it won't take a moment . 740930_746080
oh, and soap and towels over here if you need to wash your hands . 746080_771000
you may want to you may care to put on a coat by the way if you don't want to get any ah don't want to get grubby . 771000_778990
excuse me, mr . 778990_782960
brown, Donald is being a ding+dong .
sorry ? 782960_784950
you were meant to draw up a table first .
look what he's got . 784950_785990
he's put xxx fingers everywhere .
who did that . 785990_786040
yeah, there's plenty of paper over there, gary .
can I have another piece of paper . 786040_789870
do we have to draw up the table ? 789870_790840
get get me one too . 790840_791820
adam just did all this . 791820_792920
yeah . 792920_793990
is that how we do it like that ? 793990_794980
yeah . 794980_795880
yeah .
let me see your finger . 795880_796960
the fingerprints work a little bit better if they're not quite so so heavy . 796960_804860
don't put too much ink on your hands .
get a new microphone thing . 804860_807000
like that ? 807000_808890
um well, yeah . 808890_819860
that's probably a touch heavy .
just a little bit lighter .
maybe, if you'd use that again, the second time around it'll probably work okay .
mr . 819860_822000
brown, is this good ?
it's terrific, ron . 822000_823980
that's actually good .
what about mine ? 823980_826070
because i, I did xxx . 826070_827840
fine, perfect . 827840_829910
give me five, larry . 829910_830800
maybe a touch heavy, but that's good . 830800_834900
all right .
no . 834900_841980
that's fantastic .
good .
not too heavy, that's all .
are you meant to just do one hand ? 841980_843840
no, you're meant to do both hands . 843840_847850
okay .
I just figured mine was a bit too heavy . 847850_849910
yeah, um, yeah . 849910_859910
sometimes, if you put one on there to to take a little bit off the second one .
that's much better, yes .
yeah .
because if you were leaving fingerprints, you wouldn't normally leave ah, ones like that would you ? 859910_865000
we do like ones like this . 865000_866840
yeah, okay . 866840_867830
are you going to get annoyed at us if we muck around in front of the camera ? 867830_871010
no . 871010_874050
it's a normal class .
so xxx . 874050_878050
christine's already told me off, don't worry . 878050_880000
is that better ? 880000_881000
that's perfect . 881000_886050
that's, yeah, that's much better .
that shows it much more clearly .
mr . 886050_888980
brown .
that's fantastic . 888980_890890
xxx right hand and then all the things xxx . 890890_897920
do we do both hands ? 897920_898990
it'll be the other way around won't it . 898990_913030
the thumb, and then it'll be index .
middle .
remember when you do the right hand it goes in reverse order to the left hand, doesn't it . 913030_917030
nah, it doesn't . 917030_918060
oh well . 918060_923850
okay, not too heavy, tony . 923850_927900

yeah . 1107990_1108880
so to try to make it visible you then use the the dust . 1108880_1112010
then you put sticky tape on xxx . 1112010_1113860
yeah . 1113860_1120850
just like you're a if you're a, if a police and you go into a room and ah you want to find out what's happened .

okay . 1201010_1202010
just+just try it . 1202010_1207890
it may not be that good .
I would have thought that surface would be okay .
try a ah a clear surface with either the talc or with the the glass surface with either the talc or the ah carbon powder . 1207890_1218990
allison, are you okay ?

mine . 1248910_1249850

it looks pretty good . 1250010_1250930
okay . 1250930_1251030
did you wash your hands ? 1251030_1252010

mr . 1253030_1254990
brown .
yeah . 1254990_1255030

mr . 1265800_1268040

I don't reckon you've got any ah oils ah leaking out . 1268040_1272930
look at that, mr . 1272930_1275040
brown frown .
well that's worked okay . 1275040_1279050
look at that .
arnold .
blow it, blow it . 1279050_1280950
mr . 1280950_1283980

um, mr . 1288880_1292020
brown .

I'd I'd try another one if I were you .
okay . 1295980_1296860
just get some paper . 1296860_1299970
how many how much do I put on it ? 1299970_1301900
um just enough to, to cover it all . 1301900_1310020
okay .
doesn't matter if you put a bit too much on, and then just gently brush it across .
so I go like . 1310020_1311010
well no, you've got those ah the brushes there . 1311010_1313820
what about xxx . 1313820_1314910
no, if you brush it very lightly it won't . 1314910_1318060
and if you brush too hard, yes it will .
mine didn't work probably because I washed my hands . 1318060_1319840
it's perfect . 1319840_1324090
yeah, but then why did ally's work so well ?
that's ally's . 1324090_1325010
my hands are probably oilier because I didn't wash them . 1325010_1326990
now how did you do that this time, arnold ? 1328990_1332090
put a little bit of ink on it . 1332090_1333010
sorry ? 1333010_1334010
put a little bit of ink on it . 1334010_1335010

brown .
mr .

I'm really disappointed in your attitude, ron . 1350870_1354870
really .
we talked about this yesterday and the day before, didn't we .
no, potential . 1354870_1356870
we talked about your maturity . 1356870_1367910
now just try and, now come on, get on with it .
ron, you really are at the moment, you're a big disappointment to me .
mr . 1367910_1369060
brown, look at this one .
this is my own personal xxx .
you made a big fuss yesterday, because your dad was coming up to the school to talk with ms . 1369060_1376890
riley .
right .
mr . 1376890_1377870
brown .
come on just calm down . 1377870_1378860
is that right ? 1378860_1383000
oh yeah, yeah, that's right . 1383000_1388990
probably a little bit heavy, but that's right if you just dust off a little bit more, but you can certainly see the fingerprints there, can't you ?
yeah . 1388990_1389080
and I think you maybe if you, if you could tape over that and lift it off it might be fine . 1389080_1392840
see the fingerprints . 1392840_1393850
ah, most of you are forgetting to put down paper so you don't make a mess of the benches . 1393850_1401900
when you do the dusting, put down the paper please .
where do you stick it, where do you stick it so that ? 1401900_1403080
in your in your book . 1403080_1404010
I put it, yeah, no, but you're not going to see it are you ? 1404010_1405930
oh aren't you ? 1405930_1406980
well it's white on white . 1406980_1408860
oh, okay . 1408860_1412800
yes, you're right .
the carbon xxx worked better . 1412800_1413850
that's perfect . 1413850_1415840
yeah, that's great .
yeah .
yeah . 1415840_1415910
I guess for putting in your book you're right . 1415910_1422990
the only thing christine, hang on, no, no, we have got some black paper here christine .
technically you could probably do that and then put that in your book . 1422990_1426910
oh, i'll just do it all on black paper . 1426910_1430040
um did yours work ? 1430040_1432800
ah, it worked a little bit . 1432800_1433800
it's angela's cause I washed my hands too thoroughly . 1433800_1435000
xxx .
but it didn't work on the sticky tape .
gee, I recognise those prints . 1435000_1442950
seen them somewhere before .
oh good . 1442950_1446970
perfect .
yeah .
you can see them quite clearly can't you .
yep . 1446970_1447810
okay . 1447810_1451900
anyway, try different surfaces please .
mr . 1451900_1452850
brown .
yes . 1452850_1453800
I can't get the talcum carbon powder working on the plastic . 1453800_1456040
I'm sorry . 1456040_1457010
I can't get the um, xxx . 1457010_1459960
no, well maybe it's not a good surface we're using . 1459960_1471090
I it's a while since I've done this .
I would have thought it would be a slightly rough surface, isn't it .
yeah . 1471090_1472010
yeah try just try another one, anyway, maybe another finger or something like that . 1472010_1476880
but, I think it might work .
xxx . 1476880_1479920
not working . 1479920_1481880
the purple stuff does . 1481880_1482960
sorry . 1482960_1483910
yeah, well glass should certainly work quite well with the black powder um . 1485050_1496000
please remember to put down paper, thank you .
jackie . 1496000_1500950
yep .
good .
that's what the newspaper is for .

ah, no use use ah . 1503060_1504990

stop . 1535980_1536910
stop .
should we wash these ? 1536910_1538830
I th no, I think just clean them off with some paper towel, annie . 1538830_1547880
I think ah, they'll probably need cleaning ah, with detergent or something like that .
i'll just check what ms . 1547880_1552910
moller wants to do, but just rub them down with paper towel I think .
did they work okay or not ? 1552910_1558890
did you use the .
the um, sticky tape to get that ?
no . 1558890_1560020
remember . 1560020_1564080
if you use the sticky tape to then put them in your book .
oh yeah, no we didn't . 1564080_1566840
okay, next one you dust try to try to the n if if it comes out okay, lift it off with sticky tape, put it in your book . 1566840_1573910
oh okay . 1573910_1574870
do it again .
okay . 1574870_1580030
xxx I think that's what I believe that's what they do .
mr . 1580030_1581970
brown .
when you get it on there . 1581970_1583940
yeah . 1583940_1584010
put the sticky tape over the print . 1584010_1590860
peel it off and hopefully the print the powder should now stay on the sticky tape .
ooh . 1590860_1591010
ooh . 1591010_1592010
ooh, jared . 1592010_1592930
the other one's straight up in there . 1592930_1593010

yeah . 1615880_1618880
okay .
all right . 1618880_1619040
is this ? 1620940_1622900
it's probably a bit too heavy . 1622900_1626870
you'll need to dust it off a bit more than that, won't you .
is it coming out or not ?
on the white one it came out but on this it's not . 1626870_1628860
it's not, okay . 1628860_1635860
see that should be a good surface for getting finger prints on .
okay .
is there like a special technique ? 1635860_1637030
no, there's not . 1637030_1639000
no .
I think you're brushing a bit too heavily, that's all .
xxx . 1639000_1642950
mr . 1642950_1645040
brown .
no, I can't ah . 1645040_1647010
no ? 1647010_1648080
no . 1648080_1659810
what I suggest you do, it might be better if you actually do it on the upper surface because that means that any ah er other powder will actually go off .
you with me ?
yeah . 1659810_1660090
try it again . 1660090_1668900
just brush it down with some tape and then whichever whichever sort of part of you might be the have the most grease on it .
okay . 1668900_1670830
see if you can make a decent print .
mr . 1670830_1671920

now have you done any on the hard surfaces and done any dusting, adam ?
no . 1743900_1744040
no . 1744040_1751030
it might be worth your while having a crack at that .
I didn't do that . 1751030_1752000
oh you didn't . 1752000_1753080
it was here . 1753080_1756060
so you can clean up the benches there . 1756060_1757010
I put talcum paper onto this, I think this one . 1757010_1762060
no . 1762060_1763010
I put that on that, and it sort of worked here, sort of did . 1763010_1764990
okay . 1764990_1765990
not visible . 1766990_1767970
it didn't really work . 1767970_1768060
no, okay . 1768060_1769820
no, that's fine .
should I do another one ? 1769820_1770860
okay . 1773960_1779880
the glass one with the black powder, the carbon powder, might be the best one for that to put in your book .
i did I think, oh no I didn't . 1779880_1781820
okay . 1781820_1784990
has anyone been able to lift prints off with the sticky tape ?
no . 1784990_1785990
yeah . 1785990_1786970
yep . 1786970_1787000

here's some . 1789010_1790010
here, here . 1790010_1793810
so can I do I have to do it again ? 1793810_1796910
certainly looks like it to me . 1796910_1798990
not very clear though is it ?
nah . 1798990_1799950
okay . 1799950_1806080
just try maybe try on the upper surface that might ah that might also be okay .
on that one ? 1806080_1807030
okay . 1807030_1815890
do I have to do that experiment again because it didn't really work . 1815890_1817970
yeah, of course . 1817970_1823080
plenty of time .
it won't take a moment .
I'd like you all to get at least one fingerprint lifted off so you can put that in your book please . 1823080_1829880
I washed my hands, that's why . 1829880_1831930
so it didn't work .
oh . 1831930_1837880
we've done all of them and none of them have worked for me . 1837880_1840000
oh, okay . 1840000_1841010
none of the black stuff has worked . 1841010_1842940
none has worked . 1842940_1844070
only the white . 1844070_1845050
has anyone got the carbon powder working or not ? 1845050_1848000
what this brown this black stuff ? 1848000_1849940
give us a look . 1849940_1852870
did that work ?
yeah .
yeah . 1852870_1853800
not really . 1853800_1854900
you can kind of see it . 1854900_1855980
yeah, I can, but can you lift that off with sticky tape is what I want to know . 1855980_1862000
mr . 1862000_1864930
brown, I need a new powder .
oh, arnold . 1864930_1869920
what have you got so much powder there for ?
xxx . 1869920_1871890
no, the idea is to dust very lightly . 1871890_1877050
if you make it too heavy ah, you won't be able to clean it .
xxx on the sticky tape . 1877050_1878890
oh good . 1878890_1880020
no, like I put the print on the sticky tape . 1880020_1882820
oh right . 1882820_1888840
I don't think that'll work actually in ah, the criminal ju justice system will it ?
why not ? 1888840_1890000
do you think the criminals are going to go around putting their prints on sticky tape for you ? 1890000_1902000
get out of here .
what do you think ?
I can't see it .
there is one . 1902000_1903990
it's cheating, jackie . 1903990_1908800
mr . 1908800_1911870
brown .
mr . 1911870_1913930
brown, can we pack up .
you see it ? 1913930_1914900
it's not time yet . 1914900_1915920
what are you doing mr . 1915920_1918990
brown xxx .
I can see it . 1918990_1919830

show me . 1922900_1930830
oh that's you shouldn't have that glass slide, it's broken isn't it .
the black stuff doesn't work here . 1930830_1932860
oh yuck . 1932860_1938840
okay, I can see it, but it doesn't seem quite clear enough, does it ?
it didn't work, yeah, xxx . 1938840_1939020
no . 1939020_1939940
something well I don't really have anything . 1939940_1940090
you wouldn't be able to tell . 1940090_1943990
it doesn't really work . 1943990_1944900
oh right . 1944900_1950070
shall I tape it ? 1950070_1952890
try taping it ?
well well only tape it if it'll come off properly . 1952890_1954020
do you just put your finger on like that and then pull the black stuff off . 1954020_1956000
xxx yeah, sort of . 1956000_1957950
xxx . 1957950_1959820
yeah, and now I just go . 1960970_1965840
and, yeah, just just sprinkle over it and just just lightly . 1965840_1978950
hopefully the the, the carbon powder will stick to the oils that you leave behind .
yeah . 1980870_1981090
and then you brush it . 1981090_1983050
every time you touch something with your fingers it leaves oil . 1983050_1985830
yes . 1985830_1986950
and then you brush it . 1986950_1988020
yeah, just brush it very lightly though . 1988020_1991000
oh good, christine .
one, two, three . 1991000_1992880
that's okay . 1992880_1993920
it's all right . 1993920_1994830
yeah . 1994830_1999830
it's okay .
yeah .
obviously we need to er, research this a little bit better .
xxx on the sticky tape . 1999830_2000990
yeah . 2000990_2001870
xxx . 2001870_2002950
yeah, no but you cover your benches with, you know, sticky tape . 2005060_2009980
so that's an effective system is it ? 2009980_2013840
have sticky tape over all your benches .
yeah . 2013840_2014090
oh that's good . 2014090_2016800
yeah .
stick it in my book ? 2016800_2017050
yes please . 2017050_2018010
mr . 2018010_2019010
brown .
what do um, with the white powder I can't open the lid because I've got a sore hand . 2019010_2022880
not meant to open the lid because it's a it's got the holes in it like a salt shaker . 2022880_2026030
oh . 2026030_2027010
oh, ron, ron . 2027010_2029800
mr . 2029800_2031050
brown, I did it .
oh great, that's perfect . 2031050_2039010
that's perfect .
now whether you can tape that and put it on some black paper and then put it in your book might be the way to go .
that time it didn't work . 2039010_2040850
kind of didn't work . 2040850_2042030
you can actually see it in that .
xxx the other ones . 2042030_2044830
oh okay, yeah, it's not bad . 2044830_2045840
xxx on it . 2045840_2048070

it did a little bit . 2067050_2069070
I can't see, yeah . 2069070_2077040
it's obviously not a good surface for lifting prints .
obviously we need a harder surface like glass or something like that .
okay . 2077040_2080980
mr . 2080980_2081930
