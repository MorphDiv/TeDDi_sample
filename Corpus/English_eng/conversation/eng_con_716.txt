&~www .
yesterday a little boy found a frog .
and he kept it in a jar .
and he went to sleep one night .
and the frog jumped out_of the jar .
and when the boy woke up in the morning he couldn't find him .
he looked everywhere and Dog helped him .
he even called for him out_of the window .
and the doggie fell out and smashed the jar that the frog was kept
and the boy was very mad .
he went out searching and was calling his name .
the dog got involved <with a bee> with a bees' nest .
and &-um the bees got angry .
and <the dog> the boy was looking in all the trees and
and the boy looked behind a rock .
and a deer popped its head up and was carrying him .
and the dog was chasing the deer to try and get the boy off .
but the deer chucked them into a pond .
and they heard froggy noises .
so the boy told the doggie to ssh .
so they looked over .
and they saw mummy and daddy frog and lots_of little baby ones !
and the boy took his frog home .
and they lived happily ever after !
