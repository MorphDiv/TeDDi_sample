yeah whe- when when when you going to court ? 428410_430270
but in a . 428920_429560
uh well it &-uh he thinks it's going to be postponed originally I
mhm . 434930_435360
now he thinks it . 435570_436390
more than likely it won't be till sometime in the middle of
oh jesus . 440140_440950
so try to keep a date open &=laughs we'll I'll we'll try to let you
yeah . 449030_449370
uh but now he's &-uh he's thinking it'll probably be delayed till .
I don't know he it's not delayed yet but the but he but the
does he is he still as confident as ever that there will be some
well he's no he's very confident that we'll win against Phil . 462280_465460
a meaningful settlement . 462650_463750
but he's not . 466020_466690
sure that we'll win against Index Futures because he said there's
mhm . 472870_473300
&~pe <in the next> for this particular case he there's no
but Phil's lawyer was probing around saying well what do you really
you know so he said . 480040_481120
see we don't want to settle with Phil's lawyer . 481680_483290
prior to settling with Index Futures . 484070_485960
you know what I mean . 486130_486580
oh it seems Index Futures is deep pocket . 486380_488600
yeah yeah so he doesn't want to settle with him first so he said to
get together with Index Futures though by the way they got a new
oh is that right . 499150_499720
they went outside to another firm in Chicago . 499350_501340
and so he said to him go get together with him and see what you
in the meantime they're bringing in two experts so we got to bring
jesus . 511890_512610
the expert is to say see their . 512539_514780
you have to p- do you have to pay that or does that come out of the
eh I pay the expenses . 517229_519130
hm . 519400_519760
so &-uh the expert . 519830_521010
Jesus how much you got in this thing already must be like ten
well not not much no not so much &-uh thirty five hundred for him .
the lawyer . 527300_527850
mm . 528020_528380
eh so far in expenses maybe . 528950_531450
maybe &-uh fifteen hundred so far . 532220_534250
oh that's not bad . 534160_535170
but the but the the big expense would be this &-uh expert . 534980_537800
the ex- we got to fly him in from Chicago probably . 538090_540160
put him up overnight and pay him . 541050_542460
how do you how do you find an expert like that Ani . 542280_544540
I don't know he's going to find him he asked me if I knew anyone I
uh because there's no commodity of experts in Philly . 547310_549990
most of them are in Chicago . 550660_551970
uh possibly New_York or Washington . 552200_555020
mhm . 555270_555740
but mostly Chicago . 555640_556830
eh anyway he said he'll try to find one and actually he wants
and there's a possibility they're all in_cahoots together you know
yeah that's that's I was just thinking the exact same . 566060_568140
that they don't testify against each other . 567940_569610
yeah that's what xxx had . 569590_571120
but . 570230_570470
but see they're bringing in two experts to say that it's common . 570920_573850
business practice to give those . 574070_575630
they admit that they gave Phil those internal printouts . 576420_579080
but they said it's common business practice to give them to
but on the one hand they're arguing that Phil . 584380_586040

most companies are making the employees pick up . 733040_734900
uh you know up to half of it for whatever . 735130_737060
and I just finished you know remember I I got a one time job with a
yeah Bernice was telling me . 740180_741250
stayed at Delaware . 740710_741580
and they were tr- real nice I enjoyed every every minute of it and
last Thursday . 748420_749140
great . 749670_750050
and then they're going to call in the . 750060_751700
they're going to call me in for a review . 752030_753810
uh . 754420_755180
and &-uh I I it depends how the review goes I don't know who's going
they so typically they make you redo some of it you know or
spend more time on it . 765260_766210
but that was ni- that was real nice I enjoyed it and . 766590_768750
and it was nice money for the time spent yeah . 768970_771070
so far I haven't received the money but I you know I think &-uh . 771710_774170
I think &-uh &-um I don't have any fears about that you know . 774640_777040
oh that's great yeah if that that if you get a few more of those
yeah . 778050_778330
yeah oh jeez a couple . 779860_781300
what you do it where did you work to do it . 780820_782610
at home . 782700_783280
at home . 783410_783980
I own my own computer . 783530_784510
eh it was real nice I mean I really well mostly it wasn't even
before at M C I and at Western Union . 791780_794050
and my friends eh . 794660_795890
that said that's what they wanted and &-uh so I you know it was
and I already did the &-uh . 800950_802660
&=lipsmack the project and I mean eh eh they just wanted the
oh about thirty four pages of very detailed flow charts . 809810_812330
hm . 812690_812900
which isn't exactly what he wanted but that's like old fashioned
the guy that I xxx ga- gave turned it over to he just had me spend
and he didn't seem opposed to the way I did it . 824100_825920
and my friend said he's the fussiest guy I'd have to worry about .
but he seemed okay . 829840_831010
so now it's &-um just a few other managers there they're going to
yeah . 837240_837420
tell me what's happened to Gary in his interviews . 838170_840180
xxx . 838310_838510
oh &-uh we're real hopeful he tomorrow we probably will find out
potential jo- potential teach- teaching jobs . 844770_847480
oh good . 847560_848180
One is &-um . 848080_849190
Pleasantville New Jersey which we're not too happy about because
but they're the ones who &-uh called him back . 854430_856990
for a second interview . 857680_858830
and they said it was narrowed down to four people . 859130_861430
mhm . 862050_862520
well so he has a one out of four chance I guess . 862510_864770
but &-uh . 865380_866450
the the town is all black you know it's near Atlantic City . 866740_869230
and it's no- . 869360_870110
what town is it . 869680_870470
it's Pleasantville New Jersey it's all . 870560_871980
oh yeah suresure that's black . 871690_873390
it's it's it's all black and it xxx . 872740_874820
is that right . 874510_874960
it's it's tough it's a tough school . 875010_876810
so &-uh . 877460_878290
It would be nice for him to get the experience you know he wouldn't
what we don't like about that is that's a nicer area probably but
he'd have to relocate either way . 893400_894910
but &-uh Edison &-uh . 895190_897150
the guy keeps changing his story at first he was talking about a
then he's saying well they're trying to get rid of one teacher they
he would be more of a long term sub on per diem . 909010_912120
hm . 912500_912870
so he changed the story from a first time to the second time . 912910_915490
anyway he's supposed to hear from both of them tomorrow . 916040_918200
and &-uh . 918350_919050
if he gets the . 920040_921320
I think if he gets the Pleasantville job he might take it . 921940_924240
because it is a regular . 924720_926290
fulltime job even though it might not be the great the great school
but it depends what they come back with at Edison too so tomorrow
but a- also it seems to me if you can survive the Pleasantville job
you'd certainly a great &-uh uh on your resume . 936880_939550
yeah eh yeah that he was a full that he was a fulltime teacher . 939840_942350
sure . 942460_942880
and anytime he can look for others everybody in the school is black
really . 947320_947750
eh yeah it's &-uh it's like a . 949050_950610
eh it's just about a totally black community now . 950920_953190
no kidding . 953130_953720
and anyway the more he hears about the community the more he hears
not as bad as the big city black areas but it's . 958400_961300
well you said he's not going to live in Pleasantville . 960700_962420
no no he could live . 962290_963400
you know live somewhere nearby you know maybe in Egg Harbor or uh .
you know it could be . 968080_969090
do we dr- do we drive through Pleasantville driving down to
yeah well if you take the Black Horse Pike you're passing righ
