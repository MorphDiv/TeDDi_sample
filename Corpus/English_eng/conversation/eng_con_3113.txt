I mean they hear like you know a_lot_of that you know amazing
you can do . 5600_6070
amazing things . 6630_7630
Taylor . 8130_8300
okay . 8770_8980
now . 9220_9390
we're ready to roll . 9440_10100
so if we can come back to this &-uh this idea about their &-um
and &-uh kinds of finding their mathematical voices almost . 17420_21970
mhm . 22320_22620
&-um how would you &-uh &-uh talk about this with someone who has
and often they self-esteem means . 31390_33170
well you want the kids to feel good about themselves . 33900_36430
and you know maybe every time they complete a math problem we
no . 43630_43800
&-um I want them to feel good about themselves as mathematicians .
I want them to have confidence in themselves as mathematicians so
they will attack it willingly and readily and with confidence you
it might not come easily . 62160_62910
it's going to take a while . 63120_64080
&-um and the way to do that isn't just nice job . 64269_67070
good job . 67310_67670
you worked hard . 67890_68470
today it's &-um doing all that I can do to make it clear to them by
they've learned what they can do . 82550_84610
and &-um by making a point to let them know that what they're able
they lose sight of how much they've learned or how far they've come
&-um right now they think flips and turns and designing . 95750_98810
so they think that's easy . 98890_99730
they think everybody can do that . 100060_101370
and everybody can't do that . 102140_103330
they need to be aware of the whole process of learning . 103480_106130
they've gone through each new piece of information . 106150_108250
they've added each new skill . 108270_109340
they've acquired knowledge about all kinds of things . 109550_112740
&-um symmetry and design and shapes and color sheets . 113320_116140
they need someone to say for them at first all the things you've
and by the end of the unit you see them making comments . 120210_122970
like we didn't even used to know about that . 123230_124830
or I used to think a courseware would just do this . 125200_127770
and now I do this or I used to just copy my courseware every time .
and I found that a better way to do that is to use what I know
flips intern &-um my message to them is you know a lot . 135520_140500
and you can use what you know to do a_lot_of things . 141010_144410
&-um they need me to help keep adding to that list that they're
and they need to learn to do that for for each_other . 152300_154990
so that's why sometimes I highlight or celebrate something that may
it's not a whole project or it's not the final product . 160760_163430
it might be just one piece . 163550_165270
but if all of us were noticing the day before or even if just that
this is almost impossible for me . 172360_174120
when it's not impossible anymore they need everyone's attention
but then I've I've come a long ways . 181340_183500
I've already &-uh better than I was yesterday or better than I was
I'm getting better at this . 188700_189660
so they're coming to see mathematics and learning as a progression
mhm . 195420_195670
&-uh keep talking about talking more than others . 196420_200120
so . 200230_200400
mhm . 200720_200880
as a language talking about things . 203500_205840
and thinking how far their thinking has come and how their thinking
lots_of times . 210160_210630
that's how we get it . 210650_211580
how has your thinking about this changed . 211930_214320
what did you used to think . 214800_215920
what do you think . 216000_216670
now . 216750_216920
what did we do that . 217600_218550
changed your thinking . 218610_219480
and what are you able to do now that you're thinking differently
can I just elaborate on that to ask her . 227270_229790
so how do you do that . 229960_230950
how do you make the the process visible . 231420_234290
and maybe we see go around the room or so one of the 'cause you
and you made the words . 241570_243290
&-uh &-uh the quilt . 243640_245680
words you keep on adding to the quilt were words if lots . 245760_250360
right . 250380_250580
lots_of things in progress . 250770_252210
and keeping them all up for us to see and encouraging them to refer
and the strip quilts are up along with the final quilt so that they
&-um right . 275320_277280
and if they don't refer to them lots_of times I do how was what you
like what you did last week or how will this final project be
and what parts will be the same . 289430_290620
what can you use from yesterday or last week to help you today or
&-um but you'll they get more and more skilled at that as time goes
they're the ones saying . 301220_302030
oh this is just like what we did for there or this will be kind of
but it will be better because we're going to do this . 306640_310250
but <they need> they need coaching in that they need to see all
not just each day we did something . 318880_320400
and that day was forgotten . 320420_321370
and the next day we'll do something different . 321440_322960
and then we'll forget it . 323530_324120
and we just keep something different each day . 324160_325880
they see this as a building and a growing and you know a massive
they really &-um they do see that from the things we do in here . 332740_338600
they'll be better at it by units toward the end of the year . 338620_341080
but they do they see that . 341220_342690
do you &-uh do things to tie this unit to other things . 345160_349250
&-uh literature . 351380_353090
art . 353480_353570
oh we &-um we do &-um we do use a_lot_of &-um excellent children's
&-um some years more makes it in than others . 367020_369140
but there's there's a lot out there . 369400_370870
and &-um gradually as the whole second grade has now made this unit
but quilting has become a major theme for second grade as our way
&-um we've purchased trade books in our grade level . 384080_387880
and &-um searched out resources for each of us to use it on good
&-um . 396640_396810
and in terms of art we do some we look at some existing quilts and
how some designs originated . 407520_408840
and how they got the names that they have . 409620_411810
&-um and this year we well we spent a little time a brief amount of
you don't just pick &-um two colors that you like . 425200_427840
you you put some thinking behind that . 428200_430240
and some of them have been really intrigued in that . 430840_433250
&-um so we do try to bring in some of that some social studies . 433560_437250
some of the stories we read about quilts deal with things like &-um
but the primary focus is geometry . 447410_449510
we do &-um leave a_lot_of other things in though as . 449930_453300
Carmen how would you &-uh characterize or describe the mathematics
what kind of what is the mathematics . 464340_465340
&-um shapes and their properties . 466310_469830
and &-um you know all of the flipping and turning and stuff that we
gets them to focus on &-um how that can change those shapes . 479250_484740
how you can without changing the shape . 484970_486620
how can you change the way it looks . 486700_488220
it's &-um zillion certain pulling it . 488310_490070
it's position . 490120_490700
it's still a square . 491210_491860
it's just in a different position . 491910_493150
or it's still a triangle . 493430_494190
it's just in a different position . 494350_495580
and then looking at how shape shapes go together to combine new
&-um this will extend into &-um explorations of area and perimeter
we haven't talked about those . 510300_512070
&-um specifically using those words yet . 512380_515630
they've done some talking about how much &-um a quote will cover
&-um but <that will> that will be extending . 526470_528830
&-um we also do . 529160_530070
symmetry . 531560_532070
we explore with &-um that notion of symmetry and what that means
and &-um I dunno a lot about shape . 537140_544150
we didn't talk about properties of shapes much as a whole class
and then when we come back to that I'll be interested in how their
you know what makes a triangle . 556110_557230
a triangle . 557370_557670
what makes <a square> a square . 557720_559070
how does combining triangles in your quote . 559830_561830
design different from combining squares . 561850_564120
you know what happens when you work rectangle
