&-um she makes a mountain out_of molehills <she'll like> you
and like the other week she said that she had a &-um a crisis
and I'm like no I don't think so .
and <she was> she was positive that she broke down all her life
and it was just like &-uh shut up !
&-um what else does she do ?
that's that's it .
and she lies as_well .
she'll she'll say something and I know it's not true .
and then she'll if you tell her a secret she'll go tell
someone tells her a secret like don't tell anyone .
and she'll come and tell me .
and I'm like well if you're not sposta tell me , don't tell me !
yeah .
so it's just little things you know .
and she smokes as_well which makes it worse .
whenever you're with her she's got a fag in her hand and it's just
mhm .
she stinks of fags all the time .
that's about it really .
she's just really annoying !
