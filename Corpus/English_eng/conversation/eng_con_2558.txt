&=unintelligible_conversation okay .
first I just do a xxx (0.4) okay so this is our last section . 64485_75645
you glad or are you sad ? 76965_77705
&=laughs okay the review session &=pause_while_writing in this room . 80655_89035
in your very own room . 90395_91455
&-um seven to nine PM Friday +... 92755_97195
the twenty third . 100515_101035
I emailed you guys already . 101715_102995
okay ? 103735_103995
and today's lecture gonna be the hardest one . 104795_107835
I can say because it hard for me this morning . 109305_111285
for my morning section so bear with me . 111985_113605
and if you have any questions just raise your hand . 114065_116685
it's okay . 117305_117625
alright ?
because I have to sign a consent form too . 118105_119785
okay ? 120865_121085
I'm gonna talk about solo growth model and &-uh if I have time I'm gonna go over question three and eight from the problem set and then I'll talk about discussion sections . 121705_134465
discussion problems . 134705_135525
okay ? 135825_136065
for solo growth model I listed down the components for you guys . 137405_142025
so you can just pick it up whenever you want to use it . 142625_144905
right ?
because we gonna do a_lot_of manipulation in the in this model . 146265_149605
we're not gonna have as many graphs . 150305_151665
as I'd like . 152225_152765
before . 153065_153325
so we're gonna hafta use all these equations to explain the movement of the model right now . 153865_159685
the first one it's the labor supply . 161145_164505
okay ? 165535_165795
we assume that everyone in the country . 165935_168755
the whole population . 169895_170755
are in the labor force is in the labor force . 171555_173675
okay ? 174235_174295
LT and the growth rate of this L is N . 175115_180915
which is the population growth . 181995_183375
right ? 183615_183975
so now I have to kind_of refresh your memory a little bit about the growth rate because what is a growth rate ? 184415_191615
suppose you want to find a growth rate for L DL over DT . 192475_197295
growth rate is how the labor the number of labor change over time . 197995_202855
right ? 203415_203435
Ricardo will call this L dot T . 203655_206395
okay ? 207075_207595
and I'll call it change in L over LT . 208195_213755
they're the same thing . 214475_215275
okay ? 216315_216635
in the review notes that you gonna get you're gonna see something very complicated . 218245_221865
that's why I was carefully writing these notes last night . 222465_226465
for you guys . 226865_227365
if you don't understand those fine . 227725_229305
understand my notes and you're gonna be able to do the final . 229965_232645
okay ? 233685_233985
because he he assume L equals to something and then he derive l@l dot . 234325_240565
but I already derived it for you . 240825_242305
you have to go through the revision . 242765_244165
so this is N . 244905_245925
the growth rate of the labor force is N . 246645_248645
second +... 249065_249965
the effectiveness of the labor augmenting technology and we call that E &=pause_while_writing okay ? 252685_260885
and the growth rate of E which shifts the change in E over ET is G . 261165_268045
these are given right ? 268985_270665
population growth technological growth they are given and constant too . 270105_276085
okay ? 276705_276805
the third one is production function we talked bout production function last time . 277345_280985
they have constant returns to scale the first derivative of production function which is the slope is gonna be positive . 281485_289645
with both respect to labor and capital . 290145_293505
right ? 294245_294405
increase capital increase output . 294465_296305
increase labor increase output . 296485_298005
this is Y equals to F K over L . 299815_302575
okay ? 303235_303675
what is the fourth one ? 304015_305955
okay ?
the saving function . 306435_307255
just regular saving these are all in the big letters . 307835_311575
saving function is the small s@l which is the saving rates times YT . 312155_318555
how much you save out_of the income . 318855_320715
(0.6) okay ? 328095_328215
&-uh why don't you put on the if it eh if it didn't pass on the slope on the production function you don't have E ? 328455_337255
(0.4) .
yeah sorry . 338455_341035
that's good . 341595_341835
I forgot to put E in because we just add this E into the model . 342135_345215
right we usually have L . 345835_346795
but I just wanted the full model . 347095_348535
so good question . 349075_349695
thanks . 350075_350335
for number five we have saving equals to investment in closed economy remember ? 352565_359045
in closed economy with no government . 359685_361525
savings is gonna &~incr equal to investment . 362365_364765
so . 365045_365985
(0.4) investment is gonna also equal to little s@l times big YT . 367225_374085
okay ? 375245_375925
the last component of solo growth model . 377045_379525
is capital accumulation . 380585_381785
remember the bathtub last time ? 382645_384205
the change in the total number of capital in the economy equal to investment which is the inflow of the water minus delta k@l which is the outflow of the water . 385025_396865
what's left in the tank is the change in capital . 398185_401025
or is the level of capital . 401885_403085
okay ? 403885_404145
now if you want to study the growth model we have to define some parameters because it's gonna be very easy for us . 406345_414305
if you specifying some parameters . 414765_416085
well let's define little k@l so now distinguish my both k@l-s big k@l and little k@l let's define it as big k@l over the effective unit of labor . 416705_429745
this is not only labor this is the effective unit of labor . 430985_434045
if you have ten labor . 434625_435765
doesn't mean that everyone works the same way right ? 436125_438885
someone can be more effective than the others . 439005_440945
so you you care for the effective unit of labor . 442165_444625
when you produce the &~pr the goods . 445265_447485
so we have to divide it by ET LT . 448145_451145
okay ? 451945_452345
and also we need to define output per effective unit of labor . 452745_460285
same thing .
okay ? 463795_464235
now to study growth we wanna find we wanna look at the behavior of the capital accumulation . 464415_472415
so we wanna see how this little k@l changes over time . 473075_478035
okay ?
so . 479515_480035
we gonna do K dot T for Ricardo or for me change in little KT over KT . 480535_488015
mkay +..?
when we &~ha when you wanna derive this the &~ri &~deri derivative of KT you have to do the quotient rule again . 493155_499815
remember ? 500355_500395
bottom multiplied by top minus top multiplied by the bottom . 500755_504435
so let's do that again +... 504815_506035
&=writing_throughout_utterance just enter the first derivation . 507495_510395
ET LT change in big k@l minus top change the bottom +... 510795_520055
over the bottom squared . 524785_525965
okay ? 527185_527565
and you plot the change in capital using the last equation here . 527945_533865
put it here and do some manipulation you gonna get the change in KT I did it in my notes so go through it okay ? 534685_544885
I'm just gonna skip that part it's gonna be equal to F FKT minus delta plus N plus G little KT +... 546145_557045
you have to understand the derivation of this . 557765_562745
but you don't hafta get it down like a hundred percent like you have to rewrite it . 563105_567065
but you have to memorize this one . 567665_569805
this is important . 571185_571865
okay ? 572605_572665
what exactly does that mean again ? 572665_573765
&~th .
this is the growth rate of the capital per effective unit of labor . 574795_579855
you wanna see how the change in effective unit of labor contribute to growth . 580575_587235
okay ? 588455_588475
so that's why you need this equation this is the whole solo model this equation . 588955_592935
tells you the whole thing . 593675_594555
okay ? 595675_595995
so last time we put this in graph already right ? 596895_600415
we have this graph production function scaled down by saving rate which gonna be the same just like lower because saving rate is gonna be less than one and you know this is the shape of production function . 600825_613745
okay ? 614785_614805
so we have this . 615205_616205
straight lines slope of delta plus N plus G KT . 616705_620205
this is KT . 621605_622445
in Mankiw book in the book they &~ju they did it in three steps . 622825_628065
they do it in three steps . 628275_629515
they do it first with fixed labor okay so you don't have any N . 630715_636575
N equals to zero G equals to zero for the first step . 636755_639635
remember ?
professor the professor went over this too . 640515_643015
so this equation you're not gonna have N plus G . 643535_646215
right the picture is gonna be the same . 646475_648975
the second version they're not including E yet . 649315_653015
they left E out . 653555_654895
you have only N and the &~f plus the first version . 655385_660365
so this what you have . 660985_661865
and the model we're doing right now is the final step so we have everything . 663345_666845
so if you wanna do the first two steps just take this out . 668365_671445
and you have the same picture still . 672885_674585
see that because this is just a slope . 675125_676665
right ?
it doesn't affect anything else . 677565_679265
so from this you get k@l star . 680365_682485
why ? 683865_684025
because in the steady state okay in the steady state K stop growing little k@l . 684205_689645
and little y@l too . 690065_690985
because Y equals to a function is a function of K if K stops growing . 691305_696905
the little y@l is gonna stop growing too . 697565_699125
see that ? 699905_700385
so in steady state this term is zero . 700625_703625
right ? 704145_704345
see that ? 704505_704965
so this term equals to this term as &~a the investment hasta equal to the depreciation . 705445_710585
that's when you don't get any change in capital . 710905_712965
you have just stable capital . 713225_714785
that's represent by this point this k@l star . 715625_719225
okay ? 720505_720785
we have that and if you away from k@l star you going back to it remember ? 720985_725945
if you are on on the right hand side on the left hand side your left hand side oh my left hand side . 726625_734345
your left hand side . 735065_736585
oh .
this is left hand side of k@l star . 738155_739655
you're gonna have an investment which is F SFK greater than the depreciation . 739975_746455
so you're gonna have a positive change in K so your K is going up . 747095_752395
if you're on the right hand side you're gonna have depreciation over investment . 753095_758695
right ?
these change gonna be negative and you're gonna have a fall in K . 760275_763055
this is the definition of steady state . 765035_766915
if you away from it you coming back to it . 767495_769315
if you at k@l star you're not gonna go anywhere you're gonna stay there because that's not gonna be any change in capital . 769695_774615
okay ? 775635_775895
now this is easy . 776215_779615
comes to the hardest the harder part . 780755_783555
which is the convergence rate . 784355_785895
okay ? 786515_786795
the convergence rate in this case is the convergence rate from any point in this line to k@l star . 788065_794225
we need to use the law of diminishing marginal product of capital again . 795065_799645
if you have small amount of capital adding one more unit of capital gives you a large output . 800905_807105
but if you keep adding more and more capital that extra output is gonna decrease . 807805_813405
right ? 813845_814145
even though you still have an increase in output that increase is &~to is smaller and smaller . 813845_818925
as you keep adding capital . 819505_820545
this is the same thing . 821205_822365
if you are here okay ? 823045_825285
if you are at this point you have very low level of capital . 825525_829025
<if you> &~av if you add one extra unit of capital you gonna have high unit of output . 829565_834325
high extra output . 834785_835465
this mean you have a high growth . 836105_837805
high convergence rate . 838805_839945
to k@l star . 840685_841045
but if you keep getting closer and closer to k@l star your increase in output is falling +... 841895_848835
right ?
so your convergence rate is falling and falling when you getting toward k@l star . 850635_856595
and when you get to k@l star what is your growth rate ? 857035_858975
zero . 859315_860575
right ? 860995_861835
at this point K stop growing . 862295_864875
little y@l stop growing . 865275_866235
same thing . 866835_867515
on this side if you further away if you decrease your capital by one unit you decrease output by a_lot . 868065_874805
so the convergence rate on this side is high too even though you have a decrease your convergence rate is negative . 875105_881845
but in absolute value . 882205_883245
it hasta be big . 884085_884725
and it's getting smaller smaller in absolute term . 885565_888125
until it gets to k@l star . 888665_889645
the further you goes from k@l star the bigger convergence rate . 890605_894485
okay ? 895345_895585
I know it gets hard it's hard for me to kind_of +... 898485_900865
I talk about Mankiw thing let's do the growth rate . 902225_907965
let's see whether if we in steady state what's gonna happen . 908585_912665
we know that little k@l and little y@l stop growing . 913125_915225
what happen to all these big y@l big k@l-s and savings and wage rental rate . 915585_921725
okay ? 922145_922305
I did a_lot_of example here . 923005_924685
I don't know if it's gonna be useful but I hope so because Ricardo is writing a final on this part . 924645_930425
and he's very mad . 930665_931425
so we must be ready for that . 932365_935125
&=laughs (0.5) okay . 937125_941085
first thing I wanna point out is that remember that the change in K the little k@l and little y@l stop growing in steady state . 942265_951505
so from now on from now the next ten minutes everything's gonna be in steady states . 951905_956725
okay +..? 957165_957265
what happened to big y@l ? 960725_962405
when we wanna look at the big y@l we have to track back to little y@l because we have to use that information . 962925_968605
we know that the growth rate of the little y@l is zero at the steady state . 969165_972385
right ? 972845_973305
so little y@l I'm gonna leave the subscript T off okay ? 973465_978245
it's gonna be equal to Y over LE . 978755_982215
right this is how we define it . 982635_984755
so if you wanna see what happen to big y@l we just multiply both side by LE and now we apply the growth rate . 985595_996195
formula . 996615_996995
(0.6) so the change in Y over Y equals to the change in little y@l over little y@l what is this ? 1004585_1010725
plus right ? 1011125_1012045
because when you have the multiplication . 1012205_1014725
the growth rate hasta be <added to> added to . 1015265_1017885
so change in L over L plus change in E over E . 1018485_1023325
what is the change in Y over Y what is the growth rate of little y@l in steady state ? 1023945_1029305
zero . 1029545_1030185
come on you can talk . 1031835_1032855
&=laughs you already said something . 1033835_1034935
what is the change in L over L ? 1035995_1037515
N . 1038055_1039255
N .
yes .
what is change in E over E ? 1039815_1043015
G . 1043315_1043635
G right ? 1044255_1044695
so . 1045135_1045955
the growth rate of the big y@l is N plus G . 1046255_1049195
okay ? 1050135_1050435
(0.6) .
on your notes it looks like <you have> &~m you have ⌈ minus ⌉ . 1054335_1059055
⌊ minus ⌋ right . 1059235_1061695
oh . 1062065_1062665
should that be plus ? 1062665_1063365
oh no no no because +/. 1063705_1064665
⌈ is that ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I changed ⌋ I I used the change the growth rate of little y@l equals to the growth rate of big y@l minus &~ch growth rate of L +/. 1065225_1072485
+, oh okay +/.
+, minus growth of B . 1072725_1073425
so I kind_of like change around . 1074205_1075745
+, okay +/. 1075885_1076005
+, mhm .
now I &~mug change change it first and then take loss . 1076665_1079925
but that's the same thing +... 1080265_1081345
okay +... 1082205_1084045
and also I wanna point out something too . 1089025_1092085
at the steady state one condition at the steady state that you need to know is from this one . 1092625_1097285
if you at the steady state this thing SFK equals to the depreciation . 1097885_1102945
so at the steady state SFK star is gonna equal to delta plus N plus G k@l star right ? 1103365_1111805
+, yeah +/.
+, if you know the functional form . 1112105_1114865
if you know the production function like you impose Cobb_Douglas production function . 1116545_1120505
right ?
you &~go suppose you have like K little k@l to the one half you can start from k@l star . 1122345_1128165
right ? 1128985_1129105
you can start from k@l star . 1129245_1130485
and the k@l star will be a function of delta plus N plus G and S . 1131025_1135585
and what are they ? 1136845_1137605
they're constant . 1137865_1138405
they're all constants see that ? 1138625_1139785
constant constant constant and constant +... 1140305_1142945
right ? 1144935_1145175
so +... 1145415_1145855
that's why k@l star is constant in the steady state . 1148395_1150555
because it's a function of constant . 1150835_1152035
these parameters not gonna change over time . 1152975_1154935
okay ?
that's why k@l star is constant and the growth rate of k@l star is zero . 1156515_1159475
the second thing . 1159755_1163035
the effective unit of labor . 1163655_1165055
LTET .
without peeking what is the growth rate +..? 1166175_1170355
come on what is the growth of L ? 1174875_1176515
⌈ &~N plus ⌉ G .
yeah it's N plus G because it's equal to +//. 1176575_1179195
the growth rate is equal to the greater of L plus the growth rate of E . 1179375_1182775
so it's N plus G . 1183675_1185015
okay you're getting better . 1185795_1186615
now this is the hard one . 1187855_1190215
this big k@l t@l . 1191595_1192475
are we doing the same thing ? 1193375_1194815
in here . 1195155_1195675
we define little KT I just leave it out big k@l or LE okay ? 1196195_1202215
so big k@l is gonna equal to little KLE . 1203705_1206485
right ? 1207345_1207765
what is the growth rate of big k@l ? 1208285_1210505
what is <the growth> &~ra the growth rate of little k@l . 1211605_1215065
zero +/.
+, in steady state ?
zero . 1215825_1216585
what if what is the growth rate of L ? 1217125_1219125
N .
N what is the growth rate of E ? 1219965_1221765
G .
G . 1222065_1222405
so it's N plus G . 1222685_1223825
know the trick now ? 1226125_1226885
okay good +... 1227465_1229005
number four +... 1231065_1231325
savings .
saving is S times big y@l +... 1235185_1237765
the growth rate of savings . 1241065_1242245
it's gonna be equal to the growth rate of little s@l plus the growth rate of little y@l +//. 1242865_1248025
big y@l . 1248425_1248765
sorry . 1249025_1249065
so what is the growth rate of little s@l ? 1249785_1252325
zero . 1253305_1253785
zero .
what is the growth rate of big y@l +..? 1254725_1256345
N plus G . 1258385_1259805
right ? 1260465_1260765
so saving grow at rate +//. 1261065_1262905
saving grows at rate N plus G . 1263335_1264915
okay ? 1266415_1266715
so the l@l dot equal to L &~e multiplied by exponential N T is Ricardo's way . 1269295_1278715
the growth rate thing is my way and this is Professor Basu's way . 1279695_1282955
so pick every one you want +//. 1284095_1285235
any one you want . 1285575_1286215
but don't do Ricardo I think it's too much &~t I mean he's too good . 1286835_1290575
we kind_of like this level . 1291565_1292145
I'm kind_of like this level . 1292865_1294045
okay .
well this is easy too but this is like the sure thing . 1295385_1298285
you're not gonna miss anything from here . 1298645_1300045
okay ? 1301185_1301245
I'm in between . 1302205_1303325
okay investment since investment equals to savings the growth rate of investment hasta equal to growth rate of savings too . 1304785_1311145
right ? 1311565_1312925
so growth rate of investment is just N plus G again . 1313385_1316765
okay ? 1317885_1320805
but don't try to guess in multiple choice . 1319585_1321565
like most of them are N plus G but you know . 1321825_1323965
try to figure it out +... 1324585_1325525
well the next couple of of this derivation is dealing with number eight . 1327745_1332145
so let's do number eight in the problem sets . 1332225_1334265
okay ? 1335025_1335345
I think it's more useful to you and to me . 1337145_1339005
&=pause_while_erasing_board for number one . 1351015_1351875
and these are all in steady state again . 1353095_1354655
right ?
for number one you having you have to prove K over Y to be constant . 1357215_1365215
what should be the starting point +..? 1366895_1368035
let's divide both numerator and denominator by LE okay ? 1372765_1379725
so what is it ? 1380405_1381985
it's gonna be little k@l over little y@l . 1383465_1386005
right ? 1386265_1386785
because K over L is l@l little k@l Y over LE is l@l little y@l . 1387525_1393045
since we are in the steady state just give them some stars . 1393805_1396185
okay ? 1397525_1397845
now . 1398165_1399565
let's let it sit for a while and look at our steady state condition . 1400845_1405225
the condition is +... 1406825_1407885
SFK star remember in steady state the two thing hasta be equal . 1410565_1415225
&=pause_while_writing what is this F of k@l star +..? 1416705_1420945
just y@l star . 1423405_1424865
right ? 1425365_1425425
now you can find k@l star over y@l star from this relationship . 1427985_1432485
k@l star over y@l star equal to S over delta plus N plus G . 1434105_1441405
saving rate depreciation rate population growth technological growth they all constant . 1442885_1450745
that's why k@l star over y@l star is constant . 1451525_1454345
proof . 1455325_1455845
okay ? 1457115_1457455
the second one . 1458915_1461975
remember capital share ? 1462795_1463535
from the very first ? 1463875_1465195
⌊ Lisa ⌋ ?
⌈ are you gonna ⌉ ask something like this like in proof in the short answer part in the &-uh . 1465795_1469835
no I don't think so . 1469835_1470855
okay . 1470935_1471115
I don't think so . 1471415_1472095
I hope not . 1472335_1473615
I'll fight for it . 1473875_1474615
+, well a little you know the easy ones are these ones are okay right ? 1475255_1478935
these probably a little bit tricky . 1479795_1481075
what is capital share ? 1482095_1484975
remember the capital this is what the capital income plus the labor income equal to the whole the total output in the economy . 1485605_1493585
remember this equation ? 1493965_1494725
right that's why we have zero economic profit . 1495085_1498205
because we have to &~d divide output to pay for capital and labor . 1498945_1505025
and we have no profit left . 1505365_1506745
so the capital share if you divide everything by Y and the labor share equals to one . 1507785_1514205
and this is our capital share that we wanna look at . 1515465_1517505
so RK over Y what is the growth rate of RK over Y ? 1518165_1523665
I'm gonna simplify it for you a little bit . 1523985_1526485
in the book it's given that R equal to MPK and then K over Y . 1527065_1534145
this K can be +//. 1535795_1538835
we can do the same thing over there divide both numerator and denominator by LE okay ? 1539935_1548335
what is the marginal product of capital +..? 1548535_1550415
+, marginal +/.
+, what +//. 1552175_1554515
how do you get marginal product of capital ? 1554975_1556535
you take production function and you do something with it . 1556815_1559915
+, ⌊ integrate it ⌋ +/. 1560275_1561195
+, ⌈ take derivative ⌉ .
yes right ? 1561515_1562575
so this is f@l prime little k@l and then this is little k@l this is little y@l and since we in the steady states everything's star . 1563105_1573865
f@l of k@l is the function of k@l star . 1574985_1577545
depend on k@l star only if k@l star constant f@l prime of K is gonna be constant I +//. 1578465_1585025
we already proved that k@l star over y@l star is constant . 1585285_1588325
right ?
so these whole thing are constant . 1589305_1591245
okay ? 1593225_1593305
so it's proved +... 1593625_1594545
you wanna see this ? 1597345_1598005
suppose F of k@l star equal to k@l star to the one half f@l prime of k@l star equal to one half k@l star minus one half . 1598585_1610205
right ? 1610425_1610645
and k@l star's constant ? 1610925_1612385
one half's constant minus one half's constant . 1612705_1615345
so f@l prime of k@l star's constant Lisa . 1616105_1618925
what's the difference between little r@l and big r@l like how ⌊ I thought that was always ⌋ . 1618925_1623685
⌈ little r@l ⌉ ?
and big r@l . 1624545_1625065
⌊ like the arrangement ⌋ .
⌈ big r@l is the ⌉ rental rate . 1625365_1626885
the total payment to capital . 1627085_1628525
if you subtract the depreciation rate you gonna get the interest rates . 1629265_1633265
this is big r@l this is small r@l . 1634185_1636325
it's the definition . 1637145_1638245
thing . 1638845_1638905
this is the total payment . 1639765_1640965
but once you subtract off depreciation this is the capital gain . 1641185_1644345
okay ? 1645885_1645925
that's why we call interest rate like capital gain +... 1646265_1648525
and I just thought of something . 1652525_1653545
<the big k@l over Y> the big k@l over Y . 1654825_1659765
what is the growth rate of K ? 1659985_1661325
we just had +/. 1661725_1662545
N plus G +/.
+, N plus G what is the growth rate of Y ? 1663485_1665025
+, ⌊ N plus G ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ N plus G ⌉ since they both have the same growth rate and they divide each_other they should be constant right ? 1666105_1672305
that's like the wording the wordy proof . 1674065_1676705
this is like a mathematical proof . 1677165_1679185
Tali ?
&-um when you divided K over L by LE +/. 1679625_1684265
mhm +/.
+, &-um you just do that .
like you don't need to do anything else to the equation ? 1686045_1688065
no you don't hafta why because it's the same thing as you multiply it by one . 1688125_1691765
this is one right ? 1692005_1692765
LE and LE's one . 1692865_1693725
okay . 1694095_1694435
okay +..? 1694855_1698975
that's number that's that's question B well since W +//. 1698975_1702615
this is <labor share> labor share is equal to one minus capital share . 1703015_1707315
so it's gonna be one minus this . 1708215_1709815
one is constant this is constant so the labor tax also gonna be constant . 1710995_1715695
right +..? 1716395_1717335
now for the total payment of labor . 1718275_1721135
I think you can do it better now . 1723425_1724805
let's see . 1725225_1725505
the &-uh total payment of capital . 1727245_1729205
sorry .
what is the growth rate of R ? 1730905_1732985
the growth rate of R is the R is MPK . 1734465_1740785
MPK is f@l prime K . 1741085_1742765
so the growth rate of R is zero right ? 1743085_1746845
and the growth rate of K is N plus G . 1747165_1751185
so there you have the growth rate of RK equals to N plus G . 1752965_1756165
okay ? 1758005_1758225
or if &~y I wanna do it my way RK is gonna be equal to constant I mean we already proved that RK over Y is constant on B . 1758725_1770105
in problem B right ? 1770405_1771545
so RK equal to constant times big y@l . 1771805_1776905
the growth rate in RK do it my way is gonna equal to the growth rate of the constant which is zero . 1778685_1786425
plus the growth rate of Y which is N plus G . 1787225_1790565
same thing . 1791465_1792865
taking like extra three minutes . 1793905_1795625
okay +..? 1796965_1797305
what about the payment to labor ? 1800165_1803025
in this case it hasta be WLE because we're paying by effective labor unit . 1804185_1808705
I should put LE here too +... 1809305_1810665
well but it's not gonna change any result anyways . 1812105_1816565
okay ? 1816885_1817225
so . 1817645_1818245
you'll be doing the same thing . 1818445_1820125
WLE over Y is gonna be constant right ? 1820345_1824605
so WLE equals to constant times Y the growth rate of WLE is gonna ⌊ be the equal to ⌋ +/. 1825585_1833665
⌈ I ⌉ appreciate it +/.
+, the the constant the growth rate of the constant plus the growth rate of Y . 1836645_1840365
which is n@l plus g@l again . 1841085_1842965
we looking for the growth rate of the whole thing . 1843365_1845845
see that ? 1846965_1847385
okay . 1848945_1849285
you have a question to raise ? 1850065_1851145
&-uh no . 1851545_1852965
no . 1852965_1855405
no ? 1854235_1854535
⌊ no ⌋ . 1855195_1855615
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +...
so any question on number eight ? 1860335_1861675
and now . 1863195_1864735
so I've done six seven eight nine . 1864915_1866475
like a little bit differently you can check the note that in my notes . 1866835_1872255
<six seven> &~li six seven eight nine okay ? 1872415_1876115
now . 1876335_1877655
oh . 1878015_1878255
you ready for this ? 1879015_1879735
for ten . 1880735_1881675
why we care about C over L . 1882035_1883655
consumption over L is the per capita consumption . 1883835_1888055
you don't care how effective you are but you you care about how much each of us . 1888855_1894335
can consume . 1894775_1895275
like per person right ? 1895755_1896735
you don't care how effective you are but it just how much you can consume . 1897335_1900495
so let's see what is the growth rate of C over L . 1900955_1903415
this is kinda complicated but it's not that hard so . 1903655_1908415
you wanna find the growth rate of this right ? 1908555_1910735
so consumption is equal to Y minus I right ? 1911095_1916635
if you divide the whole thing by LE you're gonna have CT equals little y@l T minus little IT . 1916955_1925355
little IT is just saving is close to investment right ? 1926395_1931515
so little &~s S and Y which is savings you're gonna have one minus S little YT . 1931955_1939935
is your little consumption . 1940455_1942115
little c@l . 1942575_1943195
see that ? 1943955_1945915
now . 1946455_1947215
little CT we got this little CT by dividing big CT by LE . 1948155_1953775
equals to little CT . 1954915_1956175
now . 1957535_1957835
since we care only about C over L we can have C over L equals to little c@l times E . 1957865_1965925
see that ? 1967085_1967685
now . 1968625_1969245
from that equation +... 1969845_1971905
little c@l we already figured out +... 1973845_1977585
C over L equals to E times little c@l . 1979925_1985925
little c@l is one minus S little YT . 1986085_1989645
okay ? 1990145_1991105
now . 1991385_1992065
in steady states . 1992845_1993565
the growth rate of C over L equal to the growth rate of E plus the growth rate of one minus S plus the growth rate of Y . 1995205_2004285
little y@l . 2005065_2005605
what is the growth rate of E ? 2005885_2007225
in steady state ?
G . 2010005_2010125
what is the growth rate of one minus S ? 2010325_2012445
zero .
zero .
zero . 2012885_2013985
what is the growth rate of little y@l ? 2014485_2015885
zero .
zero . 2016745_2018325
in steady state .
so the growth rate of C over L is just G . 2018865_2023645
okay ? 2024645_2024845
(0.5) okay . 2028505_2033345
now let's get to something more economic . 2035305_2039965
well &~w not much but a little . 2040525_2042385
the golden rule of steady states . 2043845_2045025
as you can see k@l star +... 2045685_2048305
can be written as a function of &~th all these parameter . 2049465_2053485
like &-uh well . 2055405_2056885
what else ? 2057305_2057625
delta N G and S right ? 2058585_2061505
so what it's +//. 2061945_2063105
I mean it's okay if you have different parameters . 2064405_2068905
but if you have different parameters in each state of your development you're gonna get different k@l star right ? 2070225_2077145
and sometimes you can manipulate these parameters too . 2077425_2081525
like the government can push up your saving rate or push down your saving rates &-um you know some country try to limit their population growth like China . 2082185_2089765
right ? 2090525_2090885
so +... 2091425_2091965
if you have if you can have different k@l star which one is your best k@l star ? 2095145_2100105
we don't talk about how to converge to steady state anymore . 2100605_2103265
we talking only +//. 2104905_2105605
okay let's see if we are at the steady state . 2106685_2108825
which steady state is the best for us ? 2109445_2111125
okay ? 2111565_2111845
so &~wha how do we care ? 2112345_2113665
why &~wha what what should be the criteria to decide a capital the k@l star . 2113785_2118465
that is the best for us ? 2119505_2120725
c@l star .
yeah . 2121465_2122565
because we care about consumption so whichever steady state that give you the maximum consumption . 2122485_2128085
you go for it . 2128705_2130045
okay ?
so . 2131045_2131445
I &~der I think I derived the condition of the steady state Professor Basu did it once in lecture I did here again it's just the maximum +//. 2132445_2144165
the maximization thing you have CT equal to YT minus little IT . 2144785_2150445
okay ?
and this little i@l is SYT . 2152035_2157875
what is SYT ? 2158115_2159715
I erased it again . 2160235_2161055
oh .
SYT at the steady state . 2161995_2163275
now we talking about steady state now . 2163435_2165035
&~s Y is equal to this term . 2165555_2168355
so we can substitute y@l star I'm gonna change it to star now minus N plus G plus delta k@l star . 2169215_2178495
and these little y@l stars we can substitute in F of k@l star right because they're equal . 2179545_2186745
why ?
we wanna find the k@l star that maximize consumption so we have to change the parameters in this equation to be k@l star so we can maximize over it . 2187425_2196025
so now maximize consumption function . 2197105_2198865
you take derivative of this function set it equal to zero . 2199465_2204225
right ?
so . 2205745_2206105
take derivative f@l prime k@l star equal to well minus N plus G &~mi plus delta equal to zero . 2206995_2216095
you have f@l prime k@l star equal to N plus G plus delta . 2217015_2223635
this is the condition for golden rule steady states . 2224815_2227035
it is the k@l star where your f@l prime k@l star at that point equal to the slope of the straight line . 2228585_2235645
so let's see which point is this ? 2237305_2239125
it is over there . 2239665_2241525
okay suppose now you care only about k@l star . 2242245_2246325
this is all you care about . 2247405_2248445
k@l star .
you in steady state . 2248685_2251065
this is still your production function F k@l star and you can draw the line N plus G plus delta k@l star . 2253355_2263215
okay ?
now . 2264895_2266235
the condition is the slope of this production function . 2267875_2270695
hasta equal to the slope of this line . 2271495_2273315
that mean the golden rule steady state hasta be where the slope &~whe when you draw the line touches the slope of production function it hasta be parallel . 2274665_2285165
to the straight line . 2286105_2286965
something like over here right ? 2287485_2292345
because the slope here equal to the slope here . 2292485_2295085
satisfy the condition . 2295805_2296785
so this is your k@l star golden rule . 2297805_2300445
at this k@l star you maximize the consumption in the economy . 2301655_2305635
okay ?
if you away &~f if you are away from this you're gonna have less consumption either way . 2308535_2314995
if you come toward this point toward the right hand side it's gonna be this is the consumption . 2315575_2321815
right ? 2322815_2323215
why ? 2323655_2324375
because consumption where is it ? 2324575_2326395
equal to FK star minus the depreciation . 2326695_2331255
this is Y this is F of k@l star this is depreciation . 2332035_2335975
so the difference &~be between the two is your consumption . 2336415_2339875
this is the maximized consumption maximum consumption if you go further to the right it's falling . 2341035_2347135
if you go further to the left it's falling . 2347435_2348835
okay +..? 2349915_2350495
any question on the golden rule of steady states ? 2354665_2357185
okay . 2358065_2359825
&=pause_while_erasing_board now . 2361485_2366865
&=pause_while_erasing_board is it number three too ? 2373605_2376345
yeah . 2376545_2376825
so I'm gonna do number three . 2377285_2378585
and try to use this picture to explain number three . 2378985_2381285
this is the only two I'm gonna do today sorry three and eight . 2381435_2384095
okay ?
probably we do something later if we have time . 2385835_2387875
like seven seven's good . 2388155_2389475
seven gets me . 2389715_2390335
I can't do seven at the first time I'm like aw +... 2390755_2392855
okay . 2393535_2396495
number three . 2396815_2398075
if you have a higher saving proportion to income which is a higher saving rates basically . 2398855_2406215
what's gonna happen ? 2406755_2407615
okay ? 2408015_2408415
the high saving rates . 2410265_2411525
now we're back to regular case . 2412705_2414365
we're not gonna be in all steady states . 2414685_2416365
we're gonna be in regular case and our goal is to go for a steady state now . 2416565_2420325
okay ?
this is now back to the scaled down production function by savings . 2422965_2427805
N this is just N plus G plus delta K . 2428925_2433745
okay ? 2434385_2434765
now I've got my board line as my steady state +... 2435825_2437985
now if you have a lower . 2441355_2442755
no .
here you have a a larger savings rate . 2443555_2446255
bad picture +... 2446435_2448095
I'll leave that line +... 2450775_2451755
okay let's do this +... 2453815_2454655
okay . 2456515_2458575
this is your original level . 2458835_2460875
you at the steady state . 2461295_2462175
and then saving rate goes up . 2462815_2465175
what would happen ? 2465915_2466675
this is just a constant right ? 2469485_2471685
if saving rate goes up it pushes up this curve the production function the saving function . 2471885_2476405
so this curve is going to be like that it's got pushed up s@l prime f@l k@l star . 2477425_2484945
okay now . 2486285_2486965
I'm getting back to my board line k@l star . 2487985_2491385
you have a higher k@l star . 2492265_2494265
<when you> &~cha when you increase saving rates . 2494725_2496745
you ending up having a higher capital a growth in capital and a higher level of Y . 2497785_2504285
since Y is a function of little k@l little y@l it's a function of little k@l . 2504525_2508005
okay ? 2508985_2509005
I'm talking about all little now . 2509105_2510985
so +... 2512365_2512745
what happened to consumption can you see in this picture ? 2513105_2517065
no you can't . 2518485_2520245
right ? 2520245_2521185
so . 2521785_2522505
let's look at this . 2522845_2524325
it matters where you start . 2525305_2527965
when you change saving rates . 2528785_2529845
if you are +... 2531445_2532205
here . 2533165_2534505
okay . 2536265_2536925
if you original at k@l star this is k@l star in this picture and if you have a higher k@l star . 2537105_2543865
suppose you move up to here +... 2544965_2546785
what would happen ? 2548245_2550485
you have a fall in consumption . 2550965_2552485
right ? 2555015_2555275
why ? 2555475_2556575
why is it ? 2557435_2558555
it's weird right ? 2558915_2559695
you have a higher K . 2560235_2561955
that's mean you have capital accumulation and why you have a lower consumption can be ? 2563115_2566835
because this is +//. 2567995_2569035
this k@l star golden rule is your optimum k@l star . 2569775_2572835
if you beyond that point this point you're gonna have too much k@l star . 2573335_2578315
if you have too much capital in the economy you know when you have +//. 2578815_2582215
you gonna have very low marginal product output . 2583005_2585125
&-uh marginal product capital . 2585725_2586825
and also . 2587245_2588245
you have too much K and you know that too much K means too much depreciation . 2589745_2593885
it's gonna eat up your investment . 2594585_2595805
if you have to invest more you have to save more and when you have to save more you have to consume less . 2597005_2602045
right ? 2602925_2604085
that's why it's bad . 2604205_2605445
but if you over this side you're fine right ? 2607045_2610245
if you are &~y if you have too little k@l star if you have too little capital in the economy and you have a saving rate goes up +... 2610705_2618425
I mean this is gonna make your consumption goes up . 2620145_2623725
what I'm doing is not exactly three . 2625005_2626345
I'm trying to use &~s three to relate to this . 2626685_2629045
if you don't have the same answer don't be panic . 2629605_2631885
well for number three it's just like if you are here right ? 2633165_2638265
and savings savings rates goes down goes up the immediate effect is just you have to consume +/. 2638445_2644305
less +/.
+, less because you save more . 2645885_2647085
right ?
but you know that K is increasing . 2648485_2650625
you have capital accumulation capital growth . 2651465_2653605
then you gonna have productivity growth because you can produce more . 2654045_2656905
and that's the gain . 2657905_2658865
the immediate gain . 2659525_2660345
and at the end I mean the transition at the transition you accumulate more more and more capital and once you get here . 2660805_2670465
your capital growth rate is going back to zero again the little k@l . 2671305_2674585
right ? 2675625_2675945
so you go from zero here positive positive and it's zero here again . 2676085_2680185
so you enjoy what's in between transition rate . 2680865_2684865
and what's &~ana what's &~th the other good thing is you end up at a higher level K . 2685185_2689545
higher level Y . 2690345_2691005
and your consumption's gonna increase later . 2691685_2693765
because Y increases . 2694365_2695185
you were gonna ask that ? 2696245_2697405
+, mhm +/.
+, mhm Lisa ?
so how can you like if you want oh you can't +//. 2698385_2701705
I'm just trying to bring them ⌊ together ⌋ . 2702765_2705125
⌈ don't ⌉ .
don't .
&=laughs:multiple don't try . 2705485_2707825
oh okay . 2708305_2709465
see that ? 2709925_2710745
so if you are a policy maker . 2711145_2712705
you're our policy maker what would you do ? 2714685_2715425
if you know which side you're on which side you're on . 2715885_2722125
on this picture . 2724005_2724565
if you're on the if you're on your right hand side if you're the policy maker would you encourage the saving rate to go up or down ? 2725125_2731865
down .
down because you're gonna increase consumption forever . 2732105_2735025
right ? 2736045_2736065
and that's a picture that we did yesterday in class too . 2736225_2738325
your &~consum your consumption's gonna jump up and stay there forever . 2738825_2741785
and if you on the left hand side you want saving rate to go up or down ? 2743185_2748085
⌊ up ⌋ .
⌈ up ⌉ because you wanna save more you have &~s so little too little capital you need to increase more capital so you need to save more . 2748485_2756065
right ? 2757085_2757145
so that will increase your consumption again . 2757305_2760745
so it depends on where you are . 2761445_2763705
okay ? 2764145_2764425
on the exam I'll make sure that it's specified which side you are on k@l star if we dealing with saving rates . 2764665_2771145
or you can ask . 2771745_2772565
me . 2773325_2773505
I'm gonna proctor your you guys . 2773865_2775505
so I hope that it's better this time +... 2775785_2779325
and &-uh what else I'm gonna +//. 2783205_2784445
&-um I have to do this thing . 2784945_2786165
this discussion Ryan ? 2787385_2788305

⌈ I'm gonna talk about it ⌉ right now .
oh you're gonna talk about that ?
yeah . 2793565_2794485
yeah . 2794485_2795425
definitely . 2795485_2795785
&-um only question I have is like like if &-uh you have &-uh people moving out +/. 2796755_2802315
mhm +/.
+, like your end growth rate's gonna drop . 2802915_2804895
right ?
no . 2805395_2805735
let's let's look at it as one time moving now see what I'm saying ? 2806215_2809795
like you have just +... 2810195_2811855
the population growth is just like when <they calculate> they calculate over years right ? 2814655_2818995
but <for this> &-uh for this part it just like well let's what if they migrate for a month ? 2821025_2828985
like for this month ten thousand people came in . 2829385_2831705
so it's not gonna well we not gonna have them affect a_lot_of population growth . 2832125_2837785
let's let's make it that simple . 2838945_2840185
okay ? 2840925_2841265
so let's make it that L change but N is not changing . 2841625_2844585
because N is just the growth rate right ? 2845325_2848085
so hm in &~th the average growth rate of every year . 2849465_2853365
suppose this year you have three percent next year you have two percent . 2853725_2856445
you can have &~fo four percent this year and one percent next year and you have the same average amount of N . 2856985_2861925
we assume N to be constant right now . 2862505_2864465
I mean we can change N but if you change N it's gonna tilt if +//. 2864745_2869405
I think it's number seven . 2869905_2870745
that you have to do . 2871285_2872025
but for immigration . 2872505_2873285
I don't think it's gonna affect that much . 2874125_2876125
like in case of West and East Germany . 2876475_2878315
right ? 2879075_2879095
they're not really +//. 2880115_2880835
I don't know if they really migrate they can just still go back and forth . 2881035_2884115
like they probably cross the border and come +//. 2884915_2886735
and work and then go back . 2887115_2888235
but try to keep it simple that N is not changing because otherwise your analysis gonna go crazy . 2888695_2894175
like .
because you have you know Y goes down and you have N shift your straight line again . 2895255_2900895
see what I'm saying ? 2901275_2901575
if you have a migration an immigration if you let N change you have to let this change too . 2901905_2908245
you can't just do a simple analysis anymore . 2908445_2910285
it's not that complicated but you know it's a little bit +... 2911025_2914285
not easy okay ? 2916445_2919185
but you can put it in your analysis too if you already put it there . 2919305_2921745
it's fine . 2922045_2922485
it's fine . 2923145_2923965
just make assumptions . 2924285_2925505
if it's gonna change or not but I'm not gonna let it change in this case . 2927385_2930545
until +//.
unless you are told you know that N is changing from zero to ten percent something like that . 2932945_2939405
if not just immigration just let N to be like quite constant . 2940785_2946425
because we're not gonna go this far we're just gonna look at the production function . 2947165_2949945
to see what happened to Y and per capita Y . 2950385_2952585
okay ? 2953345_2953565
well let's see if I can apply that too +... 2954395_2956095
hm .
okay let's let's start with number two . 2958995_2960855
I'm gonna start with number two first . 2961115_2962215
and then we'll come back to the immigration problem when we get to number number three . 2963035_2967275
you have to <I didn't> I didn't put down I don't wanna kill more trees . 2968995_2972295
&=laughs:SUm but if well you do you have do you have the everyone has the problems ? 2972955_2976235
well you must have it in front of you right ? 2976895_2978475
okay . 2978855_2979235
I'm gonna go for the second one first . 2981235_2982635
under what circumstances would you expect countries to converge ? 2982875_2985435
in this case there are two convergence now . 2985755_2988655
the first convergence is the country converged to k@l star the second convergent is the two countries converged to the same point . 2989515_2997435
so now we talking about what is the condition that the two countries converge to the same point . 2998455_3003735
what makes them converge to the same point ? 3004295_3006175
any thoughts ? 3008475_3010175
Lisa ?
they have similar saving rates population growth depreciation rate and GDP . 3010495_3016035
yes exactly . 3016335_3017215
because you know that k@l star is a function of those parameters . 3017775_3021035
G N delta and S . 3021615_3023735
right ? 3024235_3024475
if they +//. 3024935_3025375
if the two countries has the same &~lev level of those rates or when do &~th when you do some manipulation and those rates . 3025875_3033375
give you exact same k@l star . 3033735_3035155
as the other countries . 3036665_3037725
then definitely in the long run you know in the long run you have to get to k@l star . 3038805_3042125
and if you have the same k@l star you gonna converge right ? 3042625_3046345
so first you must have the same k@l star to be able to converge to the same point first . 3046605_3051085
okay ? 3051585_3051945
so that's the condition . 3052885_3054885
any other comments ? 3055665_3056865
questions +..? 3058085_3058525
Jenny ?
would +//. 3061225_3061885
I don't know this just eh this is another idea that struck me is like natural resource endowments like how would that affect that like if say one part of the country had like a_lot more &-um goods . 3062605_3072745
where they ever like oil for example . 3073265_3075265
like oil natural resource ? 3076045_3077085
would that affect +/. 3077145_3077585
⌊ well but this ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ the k@l star ⌉ ?
that would . 3078485_3078685
this probably affect the convergence rates . 3080585_3082505
like +/. 3082785_3082805
okay +/.
+, how you accumulate capital but not the k@l star . 3083025_3085285
+, okay +/.
+, because k@l star we already proved that it's only for saving +/. 3085665_3088725
+, okay +/.
+, and it can reflect on the saving already because if you have oil you gonna be like you know you gonna have a_lot_of money and you're probably not gonna spend all of it so you're gonna save a_lot . 3089385_3097605
right ? 3097985_3098165
so it's already show in S and definitely you know always counting as capital like in some +/. 3098385_3103825
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ sense ⌉ . 3104265_3104645

+, definitely . 3107645_3108005
good . 3108965_3109405
okay . 3109925_3110385
any other comments ? 3110685_3112065
okay let's go back to number one . 3113085_3114485
in case of Germany East and West Germany . 3114665_3118565
will it eventually converge to the same &~ca per capita income ? 3120025_3123105
do you think ? 3123505_3123905
+, mhm +/.
+, well let's you know look at the condition and see whether it's converging +... 3124365_3129365
who think it's a yes ? 3132125_3133625
no . 3133925_3135145
who think it's a no ? 3136785_3137685
oh +/.
+, no one thinks it's a no ? 3138785_3140645
Lisa ?
you think it's a no it's a yes you said no . 3141225_3142925
I said yes . 3143225_3143765
okay &=laughs okay it's a yes . 3143865_3146165
because why ? 3146385_3146905
I mean it can be yes or no it depends on your reasons . 3147105_3149065
it's a yes because right now they're like practically one country . 3149605_3153505
they're in the &~s under the same government . 3154265_3155885
right ?
same policies same monetary policy fiscal policies right ? 3157085_3162925
so . 3163545_3164585
they're probably gonna converge the saving rate's gonna change a little bit &~deprecionsh depreciation rate might change a little bit and &~ha in the long run they're gonna converge for sure . 3165035_3175815
but I don't know how long because you know when you read the article it's very long to see a convergence right ? 3176575_3182415
&-um what's the effect on total output ? 3182615_3184055
like I know like the the like . 3184555_3185975
the total output ? 3186435_3187235
yeah like like the poor country's total output like I know like that its per capita income would like catch up like will increase +/. 3187355_3194515
mhm +/.
+, but &-um like does that necessarily mean that its &~ac its total output will increase ? 3195195_3198975
let's see . 3199615_3200315
total +//. 3200875_3201035
<what is> &~to what is the little y@l ? 3201215_3202835
okay the per capita income . 3203095_3204895
per capita not per &~effecti unit of labor I lost my chalk . 3205255_3208135
Y over L is your per capita income but if you have E here you're gonna have little y@l here . 3210365_3216925
or you can look at this even . 3217925_3219285
if this is going up and given that labor is not falling what happen to output ? 3221125_3227065
it'd ⌊ rise ⌋ .
⌈ output ⌉ hasta go up yeah . 3227565_3229305
but I thought the reason why per capita like (be)cause labor actually fell . 3229905_3233105
why ⌊ actually ⌋ . 3234125_3235445
⌈ (be)cause like ⌉ people moved out . 3235565_3236345
oh <no no> no no no . 3237125_3237985
<no no> no no no we not +... 3238865_3240185
we we look at the immigration on the West Germany side . 3242125_3244985
okay +/.
+, see what I'm saying ? 3245925_3246305
so what happened in West Germany but this is in East Germany . 3246625_3249385
you don't know whether well the labor force it's let's assume it's not changing . 3250005_3256065
okay in this case . 3257125_3257965
I don't want you to kind_of going back and forth . 3258385_3262605
it depends on you can include this and say that &~out total output falls but <I don't> I don't wanna see that because even though labor falls it still can be &~to the total output has increased but maybe not you know it's still gonna be able to increase right ? 3262985_3277885
to make this thing increase . 3279125_3280205
it doesn't hafta be only out fall . 3280625_3282505
so we don't know . 3282945_3283805
and it it's most likely to go up why because we have more capital coming in East East Germany . 3284205_3290105
right ? 3291055_3291315
if you have more capital since Y equal to FKL maybe E if K goes up Y goes up too . 3291795_3300015
so we not looking at only labor right ? 3301175_3303475
we looking at both labor and capital . 3303775_3305495
okay is that clear ? 3307255_3308095
is that okay ? 3309055_3309595
yeah .
okay well I stress more when we go to three and four . 3310375_3312975
okay +/. 3313595_3320395
+, Olivia ?
doesn't that undo xxx the capital that they had before they when they &~ha were separated countries ? 3315175_3323115
because it said now they are &-uh they have the same government and the same policies . 3323795_3328015
but it's now . 3328815_3330175
what about before ? 3330675_3331295
before we knew that West Germany had less capital than +/. 3331435_3335475
yes +/. 3335575_3335875
+, East ⌊ Germany ⌋ .
⌈ East Germany ⌉ has less . 3336615_3337495
yes . 3337775_3338075
policy &=laughs .
eh East less +//. 3338735_3339675
East ⌊ Germany has &-uh yeah ⌋ . 3340175_3340855
⌈ yeah yeah yeah ⌉ yeah . 3341035_3341795
so it doesn't matter this ? 3342155_3343435
it doesn't matter where you start . 3343445_3344645
right ?
it doesn't matter where you start . 3345365_3346485
you gonna go +//. 3346685_3347125
you gonna converge . 3347465_3348085
to each_other . 3348865_3349425
maybe +//. 3349805_3350025
why ? 3350445_3350865
you know why ? 3351025_3351505
because when you look at this okay look at this . 3351605_3353865
look at this picture &=pauses the West Germany can start here . 3354345_3363545
right ? 3363985_3364205
East Germany can start here . 3364525_3365785
this is West this is East this is K this is your k@l star . 3366185_3370125
what is the convergence rate here ? 3371755_3373395
is it higher or lower than West Germany ? 3373695_3375695
higher . 3376235_3377195
higher .
right ? 3377835_3378015
once you get nearer to k@l star your convergence rate falls right ? 3378135_3383095
so here hasta be slower the convergence rate for West Germany hasta be slower than East Germany anyways . 3383235_3390055
so it's gonna catch up in the long run . 3390215_3392235
see what I'm saying ? 3392415_3392855
and and even though it's not gonna catch up by the time West Germany get there but if &~German West Germany are at k@l star they stop growing . 3394825_3403105
they just gonna be there . 3403585_3404405
and finally East Germany's gonna be able to catch up anyways . 3404945_3407505
right ? 3407985_3408885
because West Germany's gonna start here at k@l star . 3409105_3411305
and East Germany's gonna come . 3412045_3413165
and catch up later anyways . 3414025_3415225
okay ?
so finally they have to converge . 3416425_3417985
seven hundred years you can say . 3418485_3420025
&=laughs:multiple something like that . 3420765_3421465
well this no offense . 3421525_3422465
I was just like throwing the numbers out because you know that a convergence rate is very low . 3423165_3426545
okay number three . 3427625_3428205
the article notes that the regional income difference usually cause migration from poor to rich regions . 3429525_3435305
okay now it comes to Ryan's &-uh question . 3436285_3438745
So let's let's look at just production function first . 3440065_3443945
okay ? 3444765_3445345
what happened to total output ? 3445545_3446865
what's gonna happen ? 3447445_3448405
total output in West Germany . 3449485_3450685
it will go +... 3453105_3453725
come on you have more labor in West ⌊ Germany ⌋ +/. 3456145_3458205
⌈ up ⌉ +/.
+, what ⌊ will ⌋ +/. 3458425_3458565
+, ⌈ up ⌉ +/.
+, happen to the total output ? 3458725_3459645
goes up . 3459825_3460225
goes up yes . 3460325_3461045
Y equals to FKL if L goes up +... 3461445_3465585
definitely . 3466465_3467565
Y's gonna go up . 3468105_3469045
because of what because we have the &~f fourth derivative &~e it's greater than zero . 3469525_3474505
so increase in L increase Y . 3475305_3477525
increase in K increase Y . 3477665_3478865
but if we divide it by L L L we can do that because we have constant returns to scale function right ? 3479615_3487835
it's gonna be Y equals to f@l of k@l . 3488155_3492555
right ? 3493055_3494735
now what is this small k@l ? 3495255_3498095
&=pause_while_writing we have migration labor force is going up in West Germany . 3499435_3506375
K is constant pretty much little k@l fall . 3508955_3514455
so little y@l fall . 3515115_3517255
think about it what is little y@l ? 3517915_3519495
little y@l is per capita per effective unit of labor . 3520175_3524175
if you have more labor and not producing as you know much more you're gonna have a fall in output per effective unit of labor for sure . 3524755_3533575
even though you have an increase in Y . 3534335_3536075
like Y over LE equal to little y@l even though you have this increase this can increase more and make this fall . 3536265_3543705
right ? 3544925_3545105
so that's the case +... 3545725_3547805
is that better ? 3549785_3554005
okay . 3554365_3554605
let's see if we let's see if we can say something . 3554885_3561225
&=pause_while_writing this is for you Ryan +... 3564915_3565895
if a an increase in West Germany you have a smaller k@l star and you have a smaller smaller Y . 3568055_3581315
little y@l too . 3581915_3582495
so same thing . 3583055_3583775
okay ? 3584395_3584815
and since well but this is the steady state so this is like you know in a month . 3585695_3590375
this is the steady state though . 3591195_3592375
but you still have the same answer . 3592465_3593965
see that ? 3594205_3594465
so K falls little y@l falls . 3594725_3598045
right ? 3598625_3598705
what happened to big y@l ? 3599085_3600525
if N increase +/. 3601265_3603105
it went up +/.
+, what if the +//. 3604285_3605205
what is the growth rate of big y@l ? 3605385_3606665
N plus G .
N plus G good . 3606965_3609285
so if N goes up the growth rate is going up . 3610125_3613545
so big y@l is going up . 3613845_3615065
so same result +... 3616165_3616965
okay ? 3617585_3619445
so if you can just well you know if this immigration is large enough to change the population growth you still have the same result +... 3620715_3627055
okay . 3628255_3631175
that's for labor . 3631895_3632755
let's do it for capital . 3633735_3634855
well wait . 3636375_3637615
now what does it mean it means that in West Germany +... 3638215_3642235
you have a fall in output . 3644575_3646335
so you have a slower growth right ? 3646595_3649295
if +... 3649715_3649855
if West Germany is going to k@l star and East Germany is catching up if West Germany is slowing down the two countries gonna converge faster right . 3650155_3662195
so the immigration actually speed up the convergence of the two countries too . 3662395_3667495
see that because it's slowed down the growth rate of West Germany a little bit okay ? 3668575_3672135
that's one thing . 3672875_3673495
that's for labor . 3673755_3674295
let's look at the capital what happened ? 3674385_3675905
if West Germany lend the money or capital to East Germany . 3676725_3682265
to finance their investment so they can invest more and have more capital accumulation +... 3682785_3686405
when they have more capital accumulation okay +..? 3689305_3692585
I don't know why I erased that picture &=pause_while_writing here . 3694785_3700745
&=pause_while_writing right ? 3709505_3709805
if you have higher capital East Germany is gonna catch up faster right ? 3710265_3718145
it's gonna catch up West Germany faster because they now have extra money to accumulate that capital . 3719225_3724665
see that ? 3726185_3726325
so both the immigration of labor from East Germany to West Germany and the lending the ability to borrow &~f of East Germany to West Germany will speed up the convergence rate between the two so East Germany can catch up faster . 3726825_3743265
Jenny ?
what about when they have to pay (th)em back . 3744245_3745865
I ⌊ mean is there like ⌋ . 3746505_3748285
⌈ well ⌉ but if you are at the k@l star if you have the same growth rate it's expected that you gonna have money to pay back anyways . 3748305_3756545
but right now <you need it> you need it for capital accumulation . 3756685_3758965
but when you have enough capital . 3759525_3760545
you know you can just do anything . 3761525_3763285
right ?
but right now you need capital that's why the developing country the underdeveloped country they borrow a_lot because they expect that they their capital accumulation will help them to pay back the debt later . 3764425_3776025
that's what my country is doing and now since we devalue we can't pay back the debt anymore even though we have more capital . 3777865_3783485
right ? 3785005_3785025
so that's the same thing . 3785305_3787545
okay ? 3787805_3789425
so as you +//. 3790745_3791425
and you can tell . 3791725_3792465
which way the directions is . 3792705_3794865
for labor . 3795225_3795685
the labor flow from the poor &~coun poor region to the rich region . 3796145_3800565
but the capital flow from the rich region to the poor region . 3802105_3808145
and both things speed up the convergence rate of the two countries . 3808725_3812005
okay ? 3812485_3813265
any other comments ? 3813945_3816785
