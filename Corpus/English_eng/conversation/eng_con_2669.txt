so well any more questions ? 188025_191045
no okay well the first person to go is actually John on the list so (0.12) . 192065_197665
&-um I'm gonna present my own own selection today and &-uh what I did &-uh the title of my project or paper is called &{l=READING multicultural identity formation and the effects of xxx advertising . 210105_222165
&}l=READING and what I did basically is I looked at kinda like what Ben did in a way I looked at Sports Illustrated and Rolling Stone . 223565_229825
&-um two magazines that I feel &-um kind_of tell who I am I like sports and I like music rock and roll . 230425_238645
&-um and what I did was I looked through about eight years of Sports Illustrated I read magazines that I've kept (be)cause I've been reading it for about eight years . 239065_248885
and about two years of Rolling Stone . 249585_251205
and what I did was I looked through &-um looked at the ads and looked for &-um &-um looked at the images of the the the advertisements were &-um showing me &-um to see what their assumptions of &-um of what my identity is as a person someone who might wanna buy their product and and how that conflicted with the own &~s my own sense of identity and who I thought I was &-um as someone reading these magazines buying these products . 251305_281285
&-um &-um I'm gonna just start &~pass I'm gonna pass around +//. 282105_287125
what I did I &-uh the &-uh the advertisements I cut out and I put this little &-um collection here and what I looked at was alcohol &-uh clothing and cologne . 287385_298405
&-um and I'll just start passing this around . 299585_301785
I looked mainly at &-um gender and &-uh sexuality messages that came out_of these &-um these three &-um types of advertising and how they &-uh were used to sell the products that they were trying to sell &-um some of the questions I asked myself was &-um &~wh what are these images telling me ? 304965_326385
&-um type of person I am that would wanna buy these products and how do I +//. 327165_331625
do I see myself that same way ? 331645_333005
&-um and do I conform ? 333885_336505
so their expectations of me . 337125_338885
like do I buy their products ? 339325_340465
&-um does my identity change in a way from &-um &-uh reading these magazines &-um looking at the &-um advertisements ? 341465_348825
and I'm just gonna go through one that &-uh one that I looked at was one of the first ones and there's the Budweiser advertisement for Sports Illustrated . 349485_358065
and what the picture &-um it's a picture of a guy &-uh man he's catching a football diving and <on the> on the left side on the panel on the left side says &-um &-um &{l=READING three things you never drop a touchdown pass a beautiful woman a cold Bud . 359785_376705
&}l=READING &-um and it's obvious from just those three things what they're trying &~t they're they're &-um I mean they're associating &-um women female sexuality even &-uh sports and &-um alcohol . 377705_392665
&-um and while I while it seems simplistic I think the ad combines a_lot_of gender and sexuality messages in an interesting way . 393485_401445
&-um to me it seems like by associating sports and women &-um with beer &-um they're trying to attract the consumers that they feel will buy that's reading the magazine that's gonna buy their product a male heterosexual &-um who likes sports . 401905_416685
&-um and &~i or by associating those all together and putting them in a group it seems to me that <they were> they were trying to put all those things together things that I should necessarily have or want as a as an individual . 417585_432225
&-um and I thought that that kind of conflicted &~wh of the assumptions that I have of myself in my own the way I looked at my lifestyle . 433045_442765
it seemed to me &-uh like a &~presh +//. 443025_444925
&-uh I saw the ad as like a pressure on my my social lifestyle in a way because it reinforced like these things that I should necessarily have like female companionship maybe . 445385_457065
and and maybe when I don't if I didn't that'd be &-um I could feel incomplete because they're listing these things all together . 457245_467165
&-um and I also thought that in a way it degraded women in a way by just lumping them into this category as being possessions maybe because sports beer those are things that well they feel that men &-um want or like . 466705_486385
&-um and I thought it put it was telling me what all men have these three things &-um and I thought that it was kind_of lumping me into this category of all men &-um and that's how I that's how I saw that . 487305_501225
and then I won't go through the rest but I looked at &-um clothing ads like &-um +... 501925_509245
Abercrombie and Fitch Tommy Hilfiger Calvin Klein Benneton there was an interesting ad for Benneton in there with the &-uh you've seen it the two horses ? 512615_520475
&-um you just you'll see it it's it's it's interesting . 522455_525015
&-um then I did cologne and that that that used a_lot_of &-um &-uh sexuality and gender to &-um sell their product . 526895_538255
basically <what I> what I came &~t what my analysis was of the whole thing was that I mean &-um &-um these businesses are trying to sell a product and the way they're gonna do that is by attracting &-um this certain type of consumer who &~th they &~w +//. 539755_554055
they're gonna wanna determine who their buyer is and what shapes their identity of who they are . 554335_558215
and &-uh I thought they &~the the extent to which advertising messages affect our sense of self is debatable in itself . 558695_565715
&-um but from what I've seen from looking at these &-um gender sexuality race they play out in very deliberate patterns in here to sell &-um products . 565945_574825
&-um I couldn't determine if I actually &-um conform to their what they thought the person I thought &-um the person they thought I was but I buy a_lot_of those things so I guess it works . 576505_588885
but .
so . 590605_590725
that's it . 591445_591845
John I know you told me a while ago &-um when you were doing this that you're +//. 593095_596995
you've <been a> &~mem been a subscriber or a member ? 597315_599475
subscriber since eighty nine eighty eight I think you said ? 599855_603575
yeah about ninety . 603915_604695
⌈ eighty nine ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ for &-um Sports Illustrated . 605075_606995
yeah .
do you feel that there's been a change in image of Sports Illustrated ? 607515_611535
&-um . 612195_613475
like are they being more +//. 614655_615515
are they putting more in terms of alcohol are they doing more in terms of swimsuit issues are they doing more . 615795_620935
oh yeah this &~tha I thought that was &-um the swimsuit issue . 621315_625495
in fact &-uh each year they've put in more swimsuits and it's been less the &~magaz the actual issue has been less less sports the swimsuit issue has been less sports each year . 625695_637335
and to this year to my surprise I got the issue and I'm looking through it I looked &~fo I'm looking for the looking I'm looking for the &~s the articles to read &-um &=laughs:multiple and I I didn't find any . 637835_652675
and I was really confused . 652975_653935
it was just literally I was <flipping through> even the ads were just women in swimsuits and I come to find that the whole ad the whole swimsuit ad &~wh issue is which is really thick it's just pure swimsuits . 654715_664875
and then they released a different issue that was all sports . 664895_668595
just the regular issue for the week just regular . 668895_671555
so I mean there is obviously a a moving trend towards I mean <I don't know> &~w I don't know what that says but that's that's one thing . 672155_682455
(0.5) is that it ? 686955_687515
alright .
alright thank you . 688295_690215
thank you &=applause:multiple . 694715_694775
our next victim is Mary . 694995_696495
(0.7) .
okay &-um I'm gonna be doing my curriculum guide and I'm gonna go through it &-um first I'm gonna go &-um go over how I approached choosing my topic and then why I chose it and then I'm gonna go through my lesson plan and some of my resources . 703555_717655
&-um first off &-um I wanted to do a topic related to science because I'm in the elementary education program and I'm majoring in science so I wanted something that I could you know hopefully use in the future . 718745_731285
so &-um I didn't know exactly specifically what topic in science I wanted to do . 732265_736845
so I went to the Ann Arbor library and I I looked through books like toward the reference area and then I came across a debate . 737165_743925
I wasn't even aware that they had this . 744125_745465
but they have like &-um set of curriculum &-um like the standard curriculums for like science and math for the Ann Arbor Public Schools . 745445_754585
so I looked through them and then I looked under like &-um the elementary grades of and it was like required like they listed the science topics that &-um were required in their science curriculum . 755005_766785
and I chose environment because I figured that it would be a good topic to use for science and to like bring multicultural issues in too . 766825_775765
and &-um let's see I chose environment because &-um (0.10) I chose environment because I saw that like multicultural issues can be <far across> because I could go through like the different types of environments &~acro &~a around the world and like how that affects &-um the people who live in them . 776785_804925
and then &-um basically when I went +//. 805625_809105
when I started looking through my current research &-um articles +... 809425_813505
there's one passage that I got out_of a book &~ca called The Future of Science in Elementary Schools and it lists &-um a number of ways teachers are proficient . 814305_823445
and it lists as &{l=READING ensuring fairness in student teacher interactions finding bias and stereotyping in texts and &~instruc instructional materials providing a wide range of role models to students identifying school policies or practices that negatively impact on students because of this &~g of their gender race or ethnicity and establishing the kind of learning environment where all students learn science and understand its importance in their lives &}l=READING . 823865_850065
and the last one &-um having +//. 850785_853245
establishing the kind of learning environment so that the kids understand the importance in their lives I saw the environment I could bring like environmental issues where they could &-um relate it back to their own lives how they could help out the environment . 854125_867725
so I thought that was a good way of &-um bringing it into my lesson . 868605_872465
and &-um basically &-um my lesson plan is a twelve it's like a twelve day lesson plan and I made it &-um &~base I based it on &-um having it close to Earth Day which is on April twenty second so I planned it out to have it like &~g starting the week of Earth Day so it's sort_of like it sort of kicks off my lesson . 873545_897205
and &-um my first &-um day's lesson is going to be &-um just a general lecture on like the different biomes of the world and I wasn't gonna go &~t too into detail because I'm planning for the kids to &-um form small groups and like presenting on each biome so it was just like a general introduction to the biomes . 898145_921565
and then &-um then afterwards for day two I was gonna go through the different kind of animals in each biome . 922585_931805
and then &-um on day three which would be like planned out to be Earth Day if it was this year I was gonna &-um take (th)em on a nature walk and then show them like different &~pl have them like collect leaves and stuff for plants and then later on like go back to the classroom and like classify them in charts . 932785_953065
and then for day four to five I have set for research days which I'm gonna have them form into their small groups for their biome presentation and then have them research . 953385_964345
and then I have &-um a list of resources &-um list in my curriculum guide of what they can use like I listed websites and books and magazines that they can use for their research . 964805_976625
and then for day six would be the presentation day . 977585_980525
and then &-um day seven would be &-um an introduction to earth cycles and I mainly used this book called Earth Watch and it brings +//. 981385_991025
it &-um introduces like the earth cycle which &-um includes like air water and soil cycles and &-um there were some activities that I used from this book also . 991465_1003285
and then for day eight +//. 1004425_1005785
then &-uh well for day seven after introducing the earth cycle I was gonna go into the air cycle and then the following day would be just water cycle with an activity . 1006115_1016895
then day nine would be the soil cycle with an activity on erosion . 1017315_1021375
and then on the tenth day I was gonna show the movie &-um Fern Gully The Last Rain Forest which is a movie that &-um Fox put out . 1022135_1029915
&-um then for day eleven I was gonna have &-um go over recycling and other methods to save the earth and then for the last day day twelve I was +//. 1030465_1041805
they were +//.
we were gonna &-um go on a mini field trip to a recycling station and then afterwards we would come back to the classroom and discuss like what they saw . 1042245_1050725
and then I also planned out like daily things that we +//. 1051605_1054145
daily activities we would do every day . 1054365_1056185
&-um one would be I would give them on the first day of my lesson &-um a sheet of the &~s fifty simple things that they can do to save the &~ear this &=holds_up_book the book Fifty Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth I was gonna list the fifty things on just like one sheet and like pass it out . 1056825_1073245
and then &-um go over like five of these things each day with them . 1073945_1078125
and then &-um another book which I have as a teacher resource is &-um called Dear World and it's like a list of &-um letter passages from children around the world and how they feel about the environment . 1078825_1091365
and I was gonna read like three passages a day from like three different kids from different countries and that was like another daily event <and then> &-um and then pretty much the rest of my curriculum guide are just +//. 1092065_1107325
what sort of +//.
I found like a &~l a_lot_of resources for &-um the environment and &~i it goes across from videos to like CDs and and books and there was tons of websites so it was there was a_lot_of resources . 1108245_1123645
what did you think of the Ann Arbor curriculum for science ? 1125305_1128385
&-um it &~w it was pretty it was pretty similar to what I had as an elementary student and so it was pretty on target I guess . 1129165_1140005
I mean &~i like the whole curriculum guide was like a huge binder and it listed +//. 1140325_1143845
it was pretty much like a package of like activities and like day to day lessons and stuff so I pretty much used it sort of like a model because I mean it had like a concept map and everything so it was pretty well organized <I thought> . 1144045_1158425
(0.5) .
thank you &=applause:multiple . 1161195_1161855
our next contestant is Julia . 1162795_1169875
(0.6) oh and keep passing around the candy please (be)cause I don't want to take it back to my office &=laughs (0.7) . 1172535_1179375
&-um I'm gonna do my own selection . 1180675_1188675
I for my own selection I just kind_of grabbed a bunch of random pictures and told a bunch of random stories that hadta do with multiculturalism from my life so this is probably gonna be kind of random as well just kind_of shouting stuff out . 1189835_1202215
I &-um +... 1202835_1203295
when I was younger I never really had very much exposure to anything multicultural . 1204415_1208775
I I've always kind_of been in the majority in a very homogeneous society it feels like . 1209235_1214215
and I never really thought about anything that we've discussed in this class . 1214175_1220055
I_mean I'm sure I did at some point . 1220155_1221315
you hear things on the news and the radio but it's not like it was ever a big issue in my life . 1221455_1224695
but &-um one thing that's kind_of brought me into this whole multicultural train of thought is the fact that I really really loved France for no apparent reason . 1225815_1233475
really really wanted to go to France knew no French people knew no one having to do with France . 1233675_1237595
so when I graduated from high school I went there for a year and &-um and all kinds of crazy things happened you guys may have heard me mention a couple in this class before but there are a few I mentioned in my own selection and a few I didn't that &-um that I wanted to tell you about . 1238375_1253755
there was one time and &~i this is one of the most distinct memories I have it was really well I'll tell you what happened first I guess <I was> I was in this class this senior year class &-um and in France you go to the same classes with all the same people all the time and one of the classes that we had was history and geography . 1253725_1269265
and I was all psyched to be studying about like Napoleon and Louis the fourteenth and all this stuff and I walk in and they're talking about Woodrow Wilson . 1270905_1277725
&=laughs which was huge shock for me right because you don't study that stuff here I mean you don't study other people's stuff <I should say> &~i unless you take a world history elective or your high school happens to require it . 1279255_1290635
&-um so I was kind_of bummed about that and a few days after the first day of class we watched this video about this battle in Vietnam now I can't remember what it was called but it was the one and I don't know if you should call it a battle the one where the American soldiers went in and just killed everybody all these kids and and +/. 1292505_1308705
My Lai ?
+, women and all this stuff &~wh . 1309525_1310365
My Lai was it ?
My Lai .
yeah is that what it was ? 1310525_1312665
okay so we watch this video on this right . 1312745_1314985
and of_course I knew about it . 1315085_1316065
but I'm sitting in this room with thirty other students my age like friends of mine French kids watching this movie . 1316345_1323205
and it was so tense . 1323485_1325465
and I don't know if I was overinterpreting . 1325645_1327285
I think I was to a certain extent . 1328805_1330025
but (be)cause it's something that will make you tense anyway watching something like that . 1330525_1333905
but of_course I'm American in this room and I remember people kind of turning around looking at me and and having this feeling that that I was the one responsible for this to a certain extent or &=laughs:multiple at least <that I hadta> &=laughs that I hadta not justify it but apologize or or something . 1334065_1353965
and I remember getting really angry thinking well what the heck French France is why we were in Vietnam in the first place and all this kind of crazy stuff and do these people ever study that and do they study Algeria no one ever wants to talk about Algeria which is this big you know France colonization awful stuff going on comparable to that situation in Vietnam . 1354105_1372085
and I just I remember it very vividly (be)cause it was the first time I remember ever having to be representative of a group that wasn't looked upon very well . 1372145_1383965
if that makes any sense . 1385165_1386005
and I really didn't know what to do . 1386485_1387805
so that was just one random story . 1388265_1389625
I remember this other story that I just think is kind_of funny I was in +//. 1390205_1394205
this is last year and <I was in> &-um I was in Rome and I'd never been to Rome before and it had totally +... 1394365_1398705
impressed me <I can't> I can't even explain it . 1400795_1402815
a_lot_of people say it's dirty . 1402855_1403675
they don't like it . 1403855_1404355
I don't know if anyone's ever been there . 1404435_1405315
but it was just very very impressive to me . 1405435_1407095
now I'm Catholic . 1407175_1407695
but it wasn't because of any you know Catholic revelations or anything . 1407915_1412255
it's just (be)cause it was so huge and beautiful . 1412335_1414315
and there were so many people . 1414475_1415355
and we were at the Vatican and we were climbing for like five hours not really to get to the top . 1415475_1420515
and there's this xxx you know you can step outside there's this round dome on the top and you step outside and look out all over the Vatican and it's gorgeous but of_course there's a fence so that you don't fall off . 1421525_1431065
and you +//. 1432025_1432205
I couldn't take a picture over the fence (be)cause it was taller than I was . 1432325_1434845
and I saw these these guys who were I don't know how to explain it like the the side you know . 1434905_1440745
there's this dome behind you . 1440825_1441905
and there was this piece that stuck out like this &=demonstrating . 1442285_1444665
and then it swerved up like that so you could stand on that little piece right there and reach over . 1445705_1450305
now one thing I noticed about Rome is that I don't know how many people have been to Europe I can only say Europe (be)cause that's the only place I've ever been but there're people who speak different languages everywhere and you get to be able to recognize them Italian Spanish and all this kind of stuff . 1450825_1460885
but &-um but in Rome it was amazing because there were so many people from so many different places that I had no clue what language these people were speaking or where they were from and half of them I probably hadn't ever heard of the country &-um that they were from which is pathetic too . 1461305_1475785
but anyway &-um and these guys were talking this language I couldn't understand what they were saying . 1475945_1481285
but I saw them <do this> do this take this picture so I went to get up there . 1481385_1486045
and I realized that that you couldn't do it by yourself . 1487065_1489605
like you needed the &~g the one guy to stay in front of the other guy to hold him up because the piece of &=demonstrating standing up top would knock you over if you were standing on this one &=demonstrating . 1489805_1495485
so I'm standing up there trying to take this picture and &-um and they saw me and the one person came up and kind of held me up and it was really nice we went like ha ha ha and not making any sense to each_other . 1495525_1504825
and I took my picture . 1505305_1506345
<they were> they were older they were in their fifties I would say and +... 1506745_1509925
and the one guy asked I I don't know he oh <I said> I said thank_you in French . 1512305_1517065
(be)cause I don't know if any of you've had this phenomenon where when someone's speaking to you in a foreign language I automatically speak in French (be)cause that's the language that I'm always messing up and confused in not in English . 1517205_1526425
so it was kind_of a reaction and the guy asked me if I was French and I was like no no no and I told him I was American . 1526725_1531205
and the two guys like paused and looked at each_other and started laughing and were saying something . 1531325_1536005
I could tell that this was a weird situation +... 1536125_1537805
so I tried to ask them where they were from and they told me that they were from Iran . 1540185_1544045
and my first reaction was like &=shudder it was awful . 1544705_1547885
I was so mad at myself . 1548065_1549065
I was on top of the Vatican like in the middle of Rome with all these great people . 1549185_1552565
and these people tell me that &~th they're from Iran . 1552705_1554825
and my reaction is &=shudder . 1554945_1555665
and I tried to cover it up . 1555885_1557405
and I don't know how well it worked . 1557825_1558865
but <it was> it was really just a strange experience this like fear or oh no I'm not supposed to +//. 1558985_1564445
I don't know what it was I don't even know that much about Iran but I just knew that that wasn't &=hand_gesture:_PUSHING_AWAY something it wasn't &~th you know &=hand_gesture back I I don't know it was really bizarre . 1564765_1573305
so anyway I have all these random stories there's a_lot_of &-um tension with Arabs and French in France and &-um kind_of comparable to white black issues in the United States I guess . 1574325_1585825
and I have all kinds of stories about that but it's funny (be)cause I try to think about this multicultural stuff in this class and &-um and I feel like I'm really lucky because I've been exposed to a_lot_o(f) things in the past few years because I've travelled and because I've met people from different cultures . 1586425_1603285
and &-um I don't know what I would be like if that hadn't happened to me . 1604485_1608345
&-um but at the same time the more I think about it it's not all these crazy random stories that that help me realize what's going on it's really the people that I meet that I care about and I &~m I &~th know I've mentioned this before &-um so I'm not trying to sound too repetitive but &-um +... 1609185_1628825
but I think about the first year I was in Grenoble and I spent most of the year with five American people not with French people . 1631105_1638065
and I was stressing out the whole time saying I hafta be meeting different people and speaking different languages and doing different things (be)cause I hafta be more openminded and more all of this stuff and I need to learn French . 1638245_1646405
which I think is true but when I look back on it it's funny because these five people were American and came from totally random different backgrounds small towns you know big cities different &~socioecon economic status all that kind of stuff . 1646735_1663435
and I know that I would not have been friends with a single one of them if I'd met them here . 1664595_1668555
I know it +//. 1669075_1669355
one of them was from this little town of two hundred people and no stoplight and she was a cheerleader and was not at all the kind of person that I would've gotten along with in high school (be)cause ugh cheerleaders . 1669405_1677425
and &=laughs:multiple and and like I can't &~r one guy was just a skater person . 1677765_1684045
I I still couldn't understand what he was saying in English by the end of the year and he wore these little horns on his hat . 1684265_1688165
and it was just not not something that I was used to but I really really became so close to these people because of all the issues I hadta deal with being in a foreign country and being in a place where I was thrown off guard and where I needed someone and the same way for them . 1688565_1702685
and I guess that's really really just my big spiel about multiculturalism in my own life is just that +... 1703405_1709885
you can really learn things from individual people . 1710585_1715205
and I think that it really comes from where you don't expect it and I really think that with kids if you want to have them understand that you can't talk to them in these really broad terms and give (th)em these things that mean nothing to them really and these stories you hafta somehow find a way to get them +... 1716105_1731785
to feel it through someone that they care about . 1733825_1735785
so anyway . 1736925_1737265
that's what my selection was about . 1737965_1739225
&=applause &=sound_deleted_from_original_file_for_confidentiality .
thank you &-um . 1764705_1766005
Melissa xxx (0.9) .
okay I'm losing my voice so <so talk up> but I'm gonna share my &-um curriculum lesson plan with you guys . 1767025_1785405
&-um and the theme I picked &-um I'm an &~el elementary school major and the theme I picked was multicultural education in the elementary school I wanted it a very broad base because &-um +... 1786305_1799245
I believe that multicultural education should be integrated into every subject area that I'm gonna teach . 1800425_1805965
and so it was really hard for me to limit it <to &-um> to &-um three weeks and let alone to one subject area . 1806825_1815665
so I wanted to just make some broad activities to help children &-um learn about themselves because I believe that &-um people who &~underth understand themselves and where they come &~fro +//. 1815965_1827525
I'm sorry I know I sound funny . 1827665_1829145
&=laughs &-um people who understand themselves &-um and their culture where they come from I think that they're more apt to understand other people and other people's cultures . 1830705_1840745
and &-um +... 1841785_1842205
and I also wanted &-um this lesson plan to &-um help my students learn that &-um that it hurts when you're the one being discriminated against . 1842665_1854605
and &-um I wanted to try and disintegrate some already existing stereotypes that like we've all already talked about coming from our own backgrounds . 1855665_1865905
but I wanted to help &~dis &-um disintegrate some of my students' stereotypes . 1866305_1872125
and I also wanted to expose them to &-um a broad spectrum of cultures and backgrounds and things because I also believe that knowledge is power . 1872765_1882185
and if you don't if you understand something then you won't fear it . 1882375_1886255
and so &-um I chose third grade for three weeks . 1886815_1890755
&-um and my opening activity was probably one that I know we all know as the blue eyed brown eyed experiment . 1891795_1898815
and I'd divide the class into kids who have blue eyes or green eyes and kids who have brown eyes or hazel eyes . 1899155_1904955
and I would make the blue eyed children &-um like a &~se second class citizen like I would try +//. 1905375_1911495
I mean obviously these are like third graders . 1911675_1913875
I'm not gonna be like harsh to them . 1914095_1915535
I'm gonna be very careful of everyone's feelings . 1915655_1917295
but &-um I would say you know if someone with blue eyes answered a question I'd be like oh no . 1917595_1923695
and if someone with brown eyes I'd be like +"/. 1924075_1925875
+" yeah that's great . 1926155_1926875
+" it's perfect . 1927015_1927455
I mean even if it wasn't like even close to the answer or whatever . 1927715_1930755
and I would make it obvious that it was a discrimination issue here . 1931335_1935275
and then I would have my children go back to their journals and reflect in it how they felt when they were the one being discriminated against and how they felt when they were the one being &~benefit or when they benefitted from the discrimination so to speak . 1936175_1952755
&-um I &~wante I also want to know &-um +... 1953395_1956415
if eye color is a valid excuse to treat people differently . 1958215_1963735
&-um and I would have them write in their journals about that . 1964955_1967215
and then after that &-um I would like them us to come together and have a discussion . 1967415_1972535
and I want to know like how they felt throughout the whole activity . 1973315_1977495
and I would relate &-um eye &~cla &-um the like randomness of judging people on eye color to the randomness of judging people by the color of their skin . 1977745_1989305
and &-um I also would like to have them define words like racism discrimination respect and prejudice . 1989965_1996765
and then I'm gonna do a similar activity like maybe the next day or so &-um with women versus men and you know and voting issues kind_of like that . 1998465_2009905
and then &-um the second part oh that was in the first part and that was like the intro to discrimination and in the second part of my activity is &-um self-acceptance . 2010525_2021485
and &-um the first thing I would have them do is talk with their family &-um +... 2022225_2027865
and &-um oh the &~fir oh sorry I would have a discussion or lead an activity or read a book or show them a video and tell them that there are many different kinds of families . 2029585_2039505
you could have both parents living in your home one parent no parent foster parents grandparents guardians etcetera etcetera . 2039905_2046205
and &-um I wanted my children to become comfortable with the family that they belong to . 2046505_2052105
and &-um I wanna make sure that I'm not gonna alienate everybody so I'd definitely include every kind of family I have in my &-um every kind of family my children come from in my lesson . 2052965_2063385
&-um I also want I would also would like my children to make a list of &-um what they like about who they are &-um their family ethnic background relatives &-um any kind of ambitions they have &-um the neighborhood they come from anything that they like about themselves &-um and &-um I wanted +//. 2064145_2088005
the reason why I did this is because &-um I wanted my children to become proud of who they are and I want them to display it to the whole class and &-um +... 2088185_2097485
and then the third activity I would have them do is &-um interview family members and to find out +//. 2098685_2106585
&-um and obviously family is like a very broad term to me . 2107205_2109925
&-um if like one of my kids is an orphan I would obviously have them interview like anyone they consider to be family friends whatever . 2110185_2117245
and &-um I would like them to interview people ask them where they &~co &~wh like where in the world they've come from &-um what their family values are if that's like a a term that third graders could understand and &-um bring in pictures of the people they interviewed . 2118165_2135645
and I &~wou I wanna have like a huge map in my room and <put the> put the pictures of the people where they said that they came from so_that everybody can see that . 2136105_2146085
you know we're not all from one place . 2146665_2148605
like our relatives came from all over (be)cause we're from America . 2148885_2152005
and I wanted &-um the children to start associating to their culture and expose children to different cultures in different parts of the world . 2152725_2161025
and I also thought that that might help them with geography . 2161285_2163505
but &=laughs &-um and then this this is just something I wanna do like throughout the three weeks of my lesson &-um I wanna have guest speakers maybe one or two per week and ask parents volunteers friends &-um family members whatever to give lectures in the classroom about what it's like to be an American from all different backgrounds . 2163745_2185685
&-um and I would ask my students to prepare questions for the visitor and &-um +... 2186425_2192305
then try and compare cultures if they feel qualified to do so and the reason why I chose that activity is because &-um obviously I want them to become exposed to &-um to different things and &-um I also wanted to expose all my students to music from all over the world in every genre &-um +... 2194265_2216185
I also wanna expose them to foods clothing entertainments &-um values holidays I'm not really one to do the ethnicity of the month thing so I've like this is obviously something I would do all the time . 2218285_2233285
and &-um I want them to learn about holidays and &~wha where holidays originated from and what the meaning is behind them and how they're important to a_lot_of people and they should never be knocked or whatever . 2234345_2245605
and then I also wanted to do once a day present the students with an exceptional person from various backgrounds &-um maybe a person from history or present day and &-um definitely students that +//. 2246065_2259785
or definitely people that my students could identify with and &-um admire for their accomplishments . 2260065_2265565
and I've listed some . 2266285_2267945
but obviously you don't need to know that . 2268245_2269565
but &-um and I also &-um I wanted them I wanted to do this because I don't want my students to grow up with the knowledge of just like typical white history . 2269705_2281085
I want them to know like like &-uh see themselves represented in history basically . 2281285_2286865
and &-um and the last thing I had planned was to &-um read stories that represent nonstereotypical portrayals of people in plots and &-um I have a list of books in the back some of them are called &-um +... 2287665_2309885
&-um In a Circle a Long Time Ago a Treasury of <Native Lore it's> Native American stories Two Hot Tamales it's Hispanic stories whatever . 2308945_2318005
&-um this is again to give my students exposure . 2318845_2322765
and the way I would assess them is I would want them to prepare an overview of a person who they are interested in just like I had done throughout the unit . 2323145_2331325
and I also wanted to check their learning logs to see &-um how they reflected on the two experiments and also to write a letter to one of our guests thanking them for sharing their knowledge and comparing the guest's lifestyle to their own . 2331945_2346325
and finally &-um I would grade them on the interview that they &-um the interview and the portrait that they provided from their family +... 2346685_2356305
so that's it &=laughs &=applause:multiple . 2359665_2361765

uhuh +/.
+, I did a unit on &-um self-esteem and stuff like that and I kinda like struggled with that that was gonna be my opening project and then I thought wow like what if I have a kid who just sits there and says I'm not proud of anything ? 2380375_2392295
and I like I battled with that for pretty much all week and ended up I did put it in but what +//. 2392985_2397605
have you guys ever experienced something like that in the classroom or do you guys know what I'm talking about like just having a kid that's like I'm not proud of anything and just flat out is not proud of anything and how you kind_of deal with that or . 2397845_2407345
I think if you know your students and if you think that the child is well liked among his peers you could ask the class for help and say like okay what are some of I mean obviously depending on their age you wouldn't do this in high school I don't think but +/. 2408725_2421105

and I talked about Escalante and Stand and Deliver but everyone's just letting everything out so screw that . 2794345_2800685
&=laughs:multiple &-uh I guess I mean I'm from Grand Rapids &-uh Grandville to be exact . 2801785_2809085
it's pretty much white . 2809925_2811165
&-uh the biggest discrepancy is are you Catholic or Christian Reform pretty much &-uh white middle+class &-um one or two african americans are at my school . 2811885_2821945
I remember there was it &~w was just horrible too (be)cause the one african american was a member of the gang from downtown so that was like the representative of of black in my school with +//. 2822885_2833465
and &-um &-uh no other religions . 2833705_2836685
and &-um and &~everyo as everyone was talking I was thinking back and &-uh how like just how racist like the white supremacy that exists in my high school or even just the Christian supremacy &-um like I wrote in here I remember my junior year was the last year we were allowed to dress up for Halloween in my high school (be)cause &-uh five students showed up in KKK outfits for Halloween . 2837345_2863065

they were just on the outsides but &-uh but they what what was shocking is they didn't have to take off their costumes until third hour they made it three hours without having to take off these costumes and I think back and I'm like how could these teachers let these KKK garbs last for three hours and and it just makes me really think &-uh like wow and &-um +... 2873275_2896855
and I remember myself I &-uh we used to +... 2898535_2900515
the the &~fr the &~c &-uh the &~f the words we used I didn't realize like I used to say &-uh he jewed@n$v me . 2902705_2909545
&-uh I used to say that &-uh &-uh people would always say oh that's so Jewish . 2909985_2912665
and I don't even think I put it together with a Jewish person it was just a word . 2912985_2917845
&-um like I didn't put together kosher like oh that's all kosher it didn't make &~s I didn't even put those that word together until last year like it just like a separate different word and &-um and &-uh <&~m &~m &~m my> junior or senior year I started to realize +//. 2918425_2931805
I was like Jewish wait minute you know like we're talking about people <this is> <this is> this is prejudice this is bad . 2932025_2938065
so I I &-um I think &-uh the Robert Frost poem the two roads diverge in a wood and I took the one less traveled by ? 2938745_2945805
that really got an impact to me and I started I wanted I &~w I was reaching for the different . 2946395_2951335
I wanted to be different I didn't like the to be in the norm . 2951955_2955015
so I started to defend like &-uh I think my junior and senior year I'd when someone said oh that's so Jewish I started defending this . 2955735_2961175
I'm like shut up I'm Jewish . 2961535_2963035
and that was my way of doing it and so I got called Hooperstein for like a year by a bunch of people but &-um I just . 2963515_2971015
wait what ?
&~Hoop my last name's Hooper and see they're like okay Hooperstein like the people <who were> &~s who were prejudiced or who'd use this this term . 2973225_2981585
whatever . 2982365_2982565
I and I was just really reaching for the different like there was a foreign exchange student in my class and from Germany and I was like a different kid you know he's so I I he ended up living with me . 2983365_2994065
that's how close he got to my +//. 2994245_2995265
I got really close with him and he didn't like the family he lived with I had him move in with me got really close I was just really &-uh chasing the different and just +... 2995365_3003785
that the community &-uh the Grandville community just wasn't multicultural I &~r most people over there like were raised all their parents were raised in Grandville a_lot_of (th)em and their grandparents lived in Grandville and a_lot_of my friends went to Grand Valley which is right near Grandville got married to someone from Grandville have kids in Grandville it just they just don't get out_of this little bubble . 3005275_3028535
they're all talking about the bubble . 3029055_3029835
and &-uh +... 3030555_3030875
so then I came to Ann Arbor . 3032265_3033305
I think that was a big deal &-uh I remember the first week before classes I was walking around with a girl from she didn't go to Grandville from Grand Rapids and &-uh and there was several students walking around with yarmulkes on and she asked me what fraternity that what fraternity wears those hats ? 3033545_3048485
and I'm like you know &=laughs:multiple don't you watch TV even ? 3048765_3052305
like like well &~th it just goes to show like how blind people are where I'm from like just like I &~don I +//. 3052955_3061215
there's there's no such thing as a homosexual in Grand Rapids . 3061555_3064235
sure there are . 3064355_3064955
but in &~w in the world I saw when I grew up you wouldn't dare &-uh come out_of the closet . 3065635_3071195
&-um actually my freshman year here I admit when I was still into this different I wanted to shock my hometown . 3071535_3076955
and me and my friend went to the fireworks big fireworks . 3077175_3079295
and we &~w we had all our friends follow us . 3079285_3081745
and we just held hands me and my guy friend &=laughs:multiple the whole way back to our car . 3081865_3085285
and &~y we almost caused like three accidents &-um like people would just go &=shocked_expression . 3086205_3090945
like you would not believe the triple takes we got like people would be driving like &-uh: and &~the &+ert &=pretends_to_swerve_car &=laughs:multiple . 3091345_3095825
you know I mean it was amazing the effect we like how much we shocked that town and and like I I became a homosexual like people who didn't don't know me anymore I'm not close to +//. 3096005_3107045
I don't have ties back to friends . 3107085_3108425
like my sister told me you know everyone &~th thought I was gay and all these things and it's just I'm out_of there . 3109285_3115065
so I came to Ann Arbor and I was thinking alright here's here's &-uh I I I was &~look I was looking for change I was looking for diversity . 3115585_3124065
remember &-um I don't know if you remember orientation they had a a diversity group thing they had a line and they &~ha they said questions and how comfortable are you with this ? 3124785_3132825
I remember one of the questions was &-uh your roommate is &-uh is gay . 3133275_3136735
and I was like I want my roommate to be gay and everyone's like what ? 3137295_3140215
and I'm like you know I &~w I want I was for some reason I just wanted change I wanted to to experience everything I &~w and &-uh so I I moved in my roommate we didn't get along it turned out . 3140555_3150635
he was gay &-um . 3151235_3152375
&=laughs:multiple &-uh so <we actually> we actually started getting along well the &~fir like we didn't get along when I didn't know he was gay I actually <(be)cause I'm like> man he's &~g I'm like he's gonna come out_of the closet . 3155695_3166695
I'm like I know it he's he's gonna come out_of the closet he's gonna find a comfortable niche and he's out_of the closet . 3167035_3171915
little did I know he was out_of the closet for a few years just not to me . 3173115_3175795
&=laughs:multiple &-um so he &~fi so we finally had a late night talk you know laying in bed lights off don't wanna go to sleep . 3176395_3182275
so I learned that and that was +//. 3182735_3183975
I liked that that was I I've I got a I I learned a_lot about what it was like to be a homosexual and what pressures there are &-um +... 3184355_3193075
it &~w <it was> it was interesting I mean like &~y he was the only guy who would yell at the hockey players to put their clothes back on on our hall . 3194195_3200575
and I &~di I and I I &~do I like before that like (be)cause the hockey players I don't know they they we lived with a bunch of hockey players on the hall and they'd get out_of the shower with their towel and you know walk back to their room or whatever . 3200655_3212215
and everyone was just like oh well you know +... 3212915_3215255
&~tha they're that's just hockey players . 3216355_3217575
and &~the &~th &~li &~the only &~g the one gay guy on the hall is the one who says put your clothes on like and like I think in high school if I would've envisioned that same situation I'd have been like the gay guy'd been the one peeking around the corner . 3218065_3229765
but it's not that way at all &-um . 3230485_3232105
so I I started to just I got a I I I became more comfortable with more things &-uh +... 3232865_3237845
I came home and there's a thirty five year+old guy kissing my roommate and I'm just you know at first it's like +... 3238565_3244585
you know whoa you know what the heck is going on . 3246025_3249345
but it became ordinary . 3249725_3251825
it it wasn't different . 3252445_3253145
&-uh and that's what we've been talking about a_lot is how &-um people who different cultures different colors different whatever just at first they're just different like you say . 3253585_3262865
you're talking to &-uh lesbian bisexual . 3262945_3265665
I don't know . 3265865_3265985
and you're like I don't <&~i &~ch> like you just have these thoughts going through your head like you're like you have a manufactured conversation like you're &=laughs:multiple <trying to> you're thinking . 3266045_3273665
your like all of a sudden okay different now <I don't> I don't want to be prejudiced so you're just thinking okay what am I saying . 3274565_3279965
and &~tha that's just that's not a way to talk to someone and and that's what you find yourself doing &-um +... 3280465_3284825
so I've really learned that &-uh like in the in this paper I kind of analyzed what affects &-uh how I view multiculturalism and pretty much it came down to my everyday actions media and academia . 3286125_3299265
and everyday life and surroundings is the biggest aspect &-uh who my friends are and &-um +... 3299745_3304965
and I found I really need to &-uh the only way for me to get a better understanding of &-uh of a person is to get to know them really well . 3306385_3314745
&-um how'd I put it in here ? 3315485_3316925
&=looks_at_paper <kind of> built a platform for conversation and makes me &-um +... 3317285_3322905
<it makes> it makes the different and not ordinary become ordinary . 3324505_3328565
like a gay guy he's different you're talking to a a gay guy . 3329125_3332305
but once you get to know him you're talking to Brian . 3333025_3334825
I mean it just doesn't +//. 3335225_3336185
and that's what I've I've really learned . 3336805_3339245
but &-uh so I started <to find> that I I'm +//. 3339545_3342165
and I don't want to be prejudiced . 3342605_3343705
and don't want to be ignorant . 3343765_3344545
I want to get to know all these people for who they are . 3345085_3347325
but in_order_to do that I have to understand if some +//. 3347845_3349605
&~i if I have a black friend I have to understand what pressures are it means to what it means to be black for me to &~unders understand this person . 3350015_3356975
so I find myself +... 3357915_3359295
being prejudiced and ignorant in trying to get rid of my prejudice and ignorance . 3361135_3364555
does that make any sense at all ? 3365175_3366335
&-um with these manufactured conversations oh black man okay . 3367155_3370315
&-uh yeah hi you know I'm I'm +... 3370915_3378235
I'm comfortable it's I I know you <here &~y> &~let let's talk &=indicates:back_of_head <black man> black man I mean I +//. 3373455_3379055
and I have black friends but +... 3379095_3381535
like it's still not there &-uh I I talk a <a new> a new person comes along that's different and different different different hi &-uh let's get to know you <they're different> they're different and unless you really know someone I &~i &~i I find it's really difficult to do &-um I I've tried to go to much less categorizing and more just questioning . 3382525_3405245
trying to erase clean slate with every person I meet . 3405885_3409465
I don't know anything about anybody . 3409965_3411345
and &-uh that that's helped me a_lot in dealing with different people and getting to understand different cultures &-um +... 3412165_3418085

you're black you're white I can't even tell . 3443085_3444605
it's hard to do though &-um +... 3445105_3446225
I don't know what else I talked about in here &-um +... 3447545_3449945
I started to talk about how Ann Arbor is &-uh how I I was all happy to get in Ann Arbor with this multicultural environment . 3452065_3459185
I'm outta this bubble of Grand Rapids but I I'm I'm in a bubble of Ann Arbor now too and I'm starting to really realize that &-uh how Ann Arbor's just it's +//. 3459285_3469965
you can't be prejudiced in in Ann Arbor . 3470425_3472345
you're +//. 3472645_3472785

everyone's got this little caution button you know everyone they talk to and &-uh and it's just not representative of the rest of the world . 3480905_3488145
&-uh Ann Arbor's this closer to utopia kind of multicultural town and &-uh it's really skewing my view of of different cultures I'm I'm getting everyone that goes to University of Michigan from this culture . 3489045_3503445
there's +//. 3503605_3503705
I don't think it's very representative . 3503865_3504885
I'm not representative of Grandville . 3505545_3506705
&-uh I don't think so &-um so I'm really I'm looking forward to getting outta here almost now to establish another multicultural view (be)cause right now it's really skewed by academia . 3507765_3520305
&-um I just pretty much saw my opportunity I really think for me to have a better understanding of different cultures and people I have to &-uh better understand the forces that drive the way I see things if I understand how media affects me how academia affects me and how my surroundings affect me I can better wipe the slate clean when I meet people and interact I guess . 3521285_3549105
and I kinda I I push that to how Escalante does this xxx than that but &=makes_raspberry_noise that's about it . 3550605_3556525

&-um Sheila . 3557225_3564205
&-um I'm I'm in the School of Library Science . 3565125_3576045
and some of the projects I've hadta do I've hadta interview a media specialist . 3577065_3582745
and one of the things they always say is nobody knows what I do . 3583385_3586205
nobody thinks I do anything around here so &-um I'm gonna tell you about my my &-uh curriculum guide here so that I can let you know kinda what we do . 3587045_3595565
&-um in fact my project has something to do about holidays I forget who it was mentioned holidays . 3596445_3601925
xxx .
the basic premise of the project we're &~go it's for ninth graders &-um who have just come into the high school and so it's kind_of an introduction to &-um media center and all that . 3606105_3615225
we're going to &-um develop a permanent resource for the media center on holidays . 3615425_3620465
&-um they're gonna be divided into groups and the groups are gonna go and develop the history of a holiday . 3621545_3628305
we'll have six different holidays and then each person in the group will have a &-um personal paper on what it feels like to celebrate that holiday and then we're gonna have pictures &-um that represent the holiday . 3628365_3641425
and all this is gonna go on the web and we're doing this in conjunction with &-um schools around the world &-um Southeast Asia +... 3641605_3648685
&-um I forgot where I said I was gonna do it . 3649805_3651225
South Africa Japan India and one other one . 3651445_3655585
can't remember what it was . 3656325_3657245
&-um so we could get &~th what the holidays they celebrate what ones we celebrate the same and what the differences are the similarities . 3658245_3665245
&-um one of the things I think (wi)ll be interesting is that there are holidays we all celebrate like New Year's &-um what do they think the history of that holiday is as compared to what you know we think the history of that holiday is ? 3666365_3677165
and that probably comes from back when I was in school when we were in the middle of the cold war &-um they used to tell us about how Russia had rewritten history to make it go their way . 3677935_3688135
you_know which probably was a mistake because &-um I'm a part of the hippie generation and as soon as they told us that , we started wondering what our government was telling us . 3689035_3697555
(be)cause you can't tell somebody a government can rewrite history and then not make (th)em think twice about their own government . 3698055_3702555
so it'll be interesting to find out &-um if we all view the history of these holidays the same . 3703255_3707735
now &-um the library teacher doesn't do a_lot_of instruction and the instruction that she does works better if she does it in conjunction with other &~ar subject areas . 3708595_3719035
&-um it used to be you'd go into the library and she'd hand you a sheet . 3719995_3722675
and she'd go +"/. 3723275_3723735
+" go find the Dewey numbers on these . 3723935_3725655
or she'd hand you some authors and say +"/. 3725775_3727435

it had nothing to do with what you were doing in your life or your classroom . 3729275_3731895

for my part they have to come to the library they have to use at least three different types of reference book sources we've got handbooks almanacs encyclopedias regular books dictionaries on holidays &-um and in working in conjunction with the English teacher because they're writing the &-uh +//. 3740195_3757535
I +//. 3758205_3758565
you know if I have an English teacher to actually work with I could do this better I hadta make up all this (be)cause I'm working by myself and I don't really know what you guys do or what you'd call it but they're gonna hafta write this informative or factual paper with a bibliography on the histories . 3758565_3771465
and then when they come back in to do their &-um personal &-um observances of the celebration &-um what we're gonna do is work on word processing the computer lab is in the library so I'm gonna teach (th)em word processing and in the English +//. 3772355_3788835
it's tied in with the English teacher who's teaching (th)em how to do a descriptive paper . 3789195_3792255
and then we're gonna &-um I hafta have (th)em come in and teach (th)em how to turn all this into HTML to put it on the web I'm gonna have (th)em come in and use different references to find pictures and how to scan (th)em onto the web . 3794395_3806955
I have to teach (th)em that then at the end when all this is done and all the schools have everything up on the web it's a nice web resource but we wanted something permanent for our library . 3807055_3816095
so we're gonna work with the art teacher . 3816715_3818095
and I'll go in there and I'll bring books in and explain how the cover of the book and the end papers of the book and the design of the pages reflect the content of the book . 3819075_3827855
and then in their art class they're all gonna design a cover and everything for our holiday book . 3828515_3833115
and then <we'll have> &-um in the display cases we'll set up all their projects . 3833855_3838395
and then a couple weeks later we'll have a vote on whose gets to be the cover of our permanent book in our library . 3838655_3843795
so the kind of library skills that they're learning are &-um use of different information resources the ability to make a bibliography use of equipment computers printers scanners word processing and HTML software gathering analyzing and synthesizing information and then presenting information to others because we've got a couple group projects going on . 3844995_3863555
&-um for me they're gonna hafta present to others what resources they used &-um how much &~inf what type of information they had how useful they were for this project . 3864115_3873575
&-um for the English teacher they're doing informative descriptive papers bibliographies &-um and for the art teacher they've got an art project . 3874475_3882395
eventually this resource will probably be used &-um in the social studies &-um either when they're looking at a &~s a country in particular or just looking at societies compare and contrast the kind of holidays we do and that kind of stuff . 3882785_3899485
&-um it has multicultural implications because they're working in diverse local groups . 3900425_3905685
they're establishing contact with global groups . 3906285_3908825
they're collaborating with others . 3909275_3910995
&-um it's making a concrete experience of this abstract notion that we want them to get of a unified whole coming out_of diverse pieces and perspectives coming together . 3912315_3921115
&-um they're making a book from diverse groups . 3921875_3923935
&-um a unit plan has been made from diverse &-um subject areas . 3924575_3927775
&-um and they'll be comparing and contrasting their perspectives on how xxx similarities and differences . 3928135_3934155
so &-um in conclusion &-uh &~th your school librarian would like to hear from you the stuff that she hasta teach works better if she &~teach teaches it with you she needs to know what your &-um unit plans are for the year what your subjects are this would also help her to have the right resources ready in that library helps her with collection development . 3936905_3957245
&-um if if the social studies department's coming to me and the English department's coming to me I might see where those two could work together on something maybe they didn't know they were both doing the same thing . 3958345_3969565
&-um it happens sometimes . 3970765_3971985
the teacher will design an assignment which really is almost unworkable because of maybe we don't have the resources for it or it's too narrow . 3972065_3981205
and if he leaves it like that he's gonna get thirty papers that all sound the same &-um so we can help you redesign it to make it bigger . 3981665_3987185
maybe it's too big . 3987385_3987885
you need to make it smaller . 3987965_3988845
&-um when I did this curriculum guide for the &-um first part they have to do the histories and they have to use a_lot_of those different kind of resources . 3989865_3998065
I got together with the public librarian to find out what resources were there (be)cause a great percentage of your kids are gonna be going to the public library and her and I put the list together so &-um they can find things in my library or her library . 3998885_4012425
and that's an important thing for you to remember too &-um public librarian would love to hear from you also &-um if she knows what's going on in the schools they can do their collection development better they can have the resources necessary . 4013485_4025585
&-um maybe she's only got five or ten books on this &-uh project that you want to do if you don't tell her you're doing it the first ten kids come in and take those books next fifteen kids have nothing to work with . 4026345_4038025
so she can put (th)em on reserve she can do interlibrary loan &-um if she knows ahead of time what the assignment is she understands what it is . 4038165_4046965
&-um in one of my other classes I I I did a project on this and I used the anecdote of the little boy who waited to the last minute to do his homework of_course and he runs to dad and goes dad dad I gotta go to the library &-um I'm supposed supposed to find pictures of what the &{l=PRON__PHONseltiks Celtics &}l=PRON__PHONseltiks used to wear . 4047225_4062885
so he and dad went to the library and they asked the librarian for pictures of old &{l=PRON__PHONseltik Celtic &}l=PRON__PHONseltik uniforms the basketball team and it turns out that the project was he was supposed to find &{l=PRON__PHONkeltik Celtic &}l=PRON__PHONkeltik costumes . 4063585_4073345
&=laughs:multiple so if the librarian knew this she could have helped this little boy . 4074625_4077265
so &-um communicate with your lonely librarian . 4077945_4081225
it'll make it easier for everybody . 4081985_4083405
thank you &=applause:multiple . 4084245_4084685

does someone just come in and erase like certain websites if you create (th)em ? 4111855_4114475
no no one else can erase (th)em but the school may not keep (th)em . 4114795_4117955
there's +//. 4118755_4119035

+, ⌊ maybe the server address ⌋ was moved . 4127095_4128955
and the address for that particular page was never changed so now it's in limbo out there . 4129065_4134245
can't be found . 4134805_4135325
&-um this project is tied in with five other countries . 4135985_4139065
and they're all there this year . 4140585_4142245
we'll have that resource this year . 4142385_4143705
but next year maybe it won't be there so we'd like a hard copy in our library to always have this resource . 4143805_4148165
and <this is actually> &-um this is actually &-um an expansion of a project that I found on the web . 4148885_4156765
and this project was for elementary students . 4156765_4158665
and they were making a &-um calendar . 4159665_4161505
and they would send in what they thought about holidays . 4162125_4164345
and so this is the kinda stuff you might get back when you're working with other countries which is kind_of interesting . 4164485_4168385
now these are little kids . 4168825_4169705
&-um and their project wasn't as big . 4170385_4172585
but for the New Year holiday &=READING in Denmark &-um at six o'clock we hear the New Year speech from the queen . 4172805_4180325

&-uh the period called and I don't know how to say this if anybody else does S H O U G A T S shougats or something like that . 4202665_4208745
shougats originally referred to the whole of January which made me wonder did they not work for the whole of January ? 4210245_4214545
I don't know .
&-uh but now it just refers to those three days . 4214905_4218165
