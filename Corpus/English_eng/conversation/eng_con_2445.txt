two uh general kinds of things . 1_5854
um one goes back to something that Pat was talking about before . 5854_9534
uhm and that is when you talked about these uh values theories what
uhm why it is you never uh chose some contemporary notions such as
y'know why you didn't intr introduce those notions because
<I> it wasn't brought into the initial framing of the uh
uh now I then did not incorporate in an interpretation when I went
I mean this had be this was the common uh previous experience that
and I wasn't rejecting the exchange theory interpretation in in any
relationships between the individual and other people with the
and since I was not measuring actual interaction between the
<although uh> . 203839_204909
<I was getting> recall data really of end states which is an
but in your interpretation though you talk about the uh part the
you know the act of going to your parent and asking for advice or
so in effect you were bordering y'know you did draw on some of the
uh d certainly I I was influenced by that kind of a theory but I I
I mean I felt that I was using questionable data using recall data
well if you were going to do it again y'know I said you indicated
what I think I would prefer to do is take bits and pieces of this
for example one area that I'm very interested in researching is
and I would see this as requiring a population of younger people in
now I'm just sitting here wondering James how would you uh I mean I
now it could be done but there's certainly
exchange theory I mean it's just like saying . 364021_366026
well probably attribution theory or any one of a variety of things
uh yuh to some extent . 385572_387262
as I as I read read the ah especially the last part where y'know
uhm implicit in that discussion y'know reading between the lines so
like the great stress that Lee places on uhm the as I said before
so it seems to me that what's happening is that children are
and ah somehow as a process there of children picking and choosing
because a network of of exchanges is built up over time which uh
y'know wha so so what led them uhm to decide those were the
why couldn't they get them in traditional kinds of exchanges and
to assert power to try and get them through nonlegitimate quote
yuh I just felt that it required a different research setting than
<sure I agree I agree> that's why I asked you if you were doing
I wouldn't I think I as I said I would prefer to break
research in which pieces of this process which I was guessing at to
well that leads me onto my second kind of question if I may uhm
you don't mean the N of tables ? 570814_571890
no no . 571890_573551
you you mean the the N of black respondents ? 573551_576364
no no the the . 576364_577140
the overall N . 577140_577600
the overall N ? 577600_578134
it's it's not so small &=laugh come on &=laugh . 578134_580370
it depends on your field he deals with . 580370_581710
small by large by psychologists &~st standards of research
three hundred that's a very uh &=laugh sizable N &=laugh . 585964_587662
well to the level of generalization though that she see y'know
to develop or inhibit radicalism ? 623350_624104
which is it &=laugh ? 624104_624968
well creativity &=laugh uh could you really convince me uh how how
first I'd try to ascertain what kind of criteria you use for
I I mean if I spend uh a hundred thousand dollars to revise the
I don't think that's Lee's question James Lee's
she wants to know what do you need to have in order to have it
<okay> well I mean what are the scientific criteria that uh
uh the scientific criteria would almost have to restrict you either
I did not attempt to present or even do the statistical analysis of
I don't think you can go beyond the population . 708399_710992
I I would think that the the framework in which some convincing
I don't think it's to be found in this study alone by itself but
I think that's the only basis on which a practitioner can gain any
this simply is saying it holds for women too but that's all it's
well no I think there's an implicit claim beyond that Lee I think
I like . 815757_819186
well I I I think in terms of some of the kinds of criteria that y
I guess that's all I have to say but I hell I don't know James if I
I want also ask Lee how how she uh moved so far in working for Zeb
seen the truth . 868118_868864
I took a seminar in symbolic interaction . 868864_874407
I see . 874407_874880
that was a good class that time a lot of good people in that class .
which really intrigued me . 878387_879303
uh huh . 879303_880411
I'd the uh . 880411_884153
see it was a critical incident . 884153_885198
it was a critical incident . 885198_886605
someday we'll get over the notion that these are opposing views
<I see> don't see them as
mm . 897376_899572
I don't see what the xxx . 899572_900019
I think they're intimately related and interact and effect each
I obviously am more interested in the connecting link huh than I am
mm . 914651_915641
no I think that it's quite clear that social psychological
no that's it . 928385_928882
Sherm ? 928882_929376
no no xxx . 929376_930664
Pat ? 930664_931163
well yuh I was little bothered by a statement you make in Chapter
&=laugh . 952542_953022
&=laugh . 953022_953431
I'm curious go ahead &=laugh . 953431_956678
what page are we on ? 956678_957735
what page is that ? 957735_958395
I'm on page four thirty middle of the page
four thirty . 964282_966578
four thirty . 966578_966887
uh huh . 966887_967471
I went to five thirty . 967471_968284
where you talk about firstly it is assumed that the mother does not
hm . 976928_977916
okay . 977916_978554
on the processes within the family but that she is accounting for
well uh . 996666_998478
number one how uh what's behind your first statement and then how
uh many but not all of the studies that have looked at children's
and you're just accepting that then ? 1052857_1054334
and they often do not ask the mother they simply ask the father . 1054334_1060198
I don't think you've heard Lee's er Lee I don't think you heard
no I'm rejecting it and saying the mother should be identified as
okay yuh that wasn't entirely clear as a matter of fact this is
<yuh I was in essence rejecting> uh the methodological
uh huh . 1099657_1100162
do you have any suggestions Lee for how you would modify that uh uh
I think that we simply have got to stop uh classifying families by
so how would you uh what would you substitute uh ? 1121424_1125280
I would I would simply if you want to use stratification variables
and look at their relationship to the particular factors which
and as I indicated at one point it would seem to me that uh that it
now when I ran the regressions I did not follow the Burke Jackson
uhm I did not do that because I did not think that was a major
I was really doing it in exploration of the possibility that the
one possibility Lee uh would be rather than and as a matter of fact
now clearly it makes a difference uh uh the distance between say
I I I would agree and I think in a way it might mean setting up a
the consistency being at high medium or low status or high and low
<yuh not many people have I just thought maybe you had> . 1305348_1307918
I was simply trying to find out if it was worth thinking about &~an
you talk about breaking down some of the work that you've done in
I think one of the things you've done here Lee that I like is to
yuh but perceptions uh may be closely related with
but that you'd want to investigate <too certainly> . 1367980_1369298
<not randomly> associated with with what structures are . 1369298_1372046
right . 1372046_1372479
I mean this is one one of the with these really y'know you ask how
but there is a possibility that the two are not synonymous on that .
yuh I'm sure they're not do you have anything you want to
uh in rather specific way do you any of you see anything in here
oh my god . 1448505_1449972
you put that in the singular ? 1450921_1452956
pardon ? 1452956_1453780
&=laugh . 1453780_1454259
you put that in the singular &=laugh . 1456221_1457099
uh . 1457099_1457737
I would hope that I would have multiple answers . 1457737_1461030
I don't know serialize it in some journal
well you have different different things in here you have the uh
you have an article in this last point you were making
but I don't really have an answer to your question my my problem
<let me frame> it an let me frame it another way uh in your
there's no question about that Lee uh when one thinks of the well
I certainly don't or analytic techniques certainly not no I I
although you better think about Tukey . 1565732_1566765
&=chuckle . 1566765_1567323
I personally don't have any don't have any question about that
&=sigh well shall we uh . 1570332_1574081
send her out . 1574081_1576294
I'd like to say something else before I step out and that is I have
I would never have known . 1596704_1597145
huh ? 1597145_1597724
I'd never have known . 1597724_1599397
well I . 1599397_1600782
not the enjoyment &=laugh <what the hell limitations are> . 1600782_1604007
<heh heh but of all the experiences I've ever had> this has
I want to know what the hell is it that you've never known Sherm ? 1608569_1610620
&=laugh . 1610620_1611181
I would never have known that there were limitations from a forty
&=chuckle . 1617559_1618076
but y'know I just have . 1618076_1619359
that was the implic(ations) . 1619359_1620030
&=laugh . 1620030_1620483
yuh I just have . 1620483_1621359
in responding to the implications of her research go ahead . 1621359_1623023
you'd better stop I'm sorry I asked . 1623023_1625543
&=laugh . 1625543_1625913
I I don't think I'm on uh bad ground . 1625913_1628592
but I I find myself being atypical when I talk to graduate students
I kept saying well y'know I'm really having a great time . 1638231_1640750
well don't they all ? 1640750_1641420
no . 1641420_1641966
well why have they never told us that . 1641966_1644763
but I just I really found it to be a fascinating &~ex experience . 1644763_1649984
would you advise other graduate students to collect their own data
absolutely . 1653469_1654409
do you think that's part of the problem on that is why some ? 1654409_1658254
using canned data out of the uh computer banks I think takes two
uh uh doesn't it really depend on what you find to be the
uh clearly for your kind of problem extant data they
no it didn't no it didn't . 1676002_1677168
and you you have had to resort to inferences ten miles long to
let me answer it this way if you frame your question independent of
yuh . 1719401_1719648
and you're still interested in this aren't you ? 1719648_1722260
oh yuh very much so . 1722260_1722966
I don't know how I felt the day after I finished
yuh but I think that's the key James it's it's the degree to which
mm hm . 1736375_1737890
&=sigh okay why don't you go get a drink and there's a room up here
I'll be in the room at the head of the stairs . 1752312_1753645
it's it's a maze but there's a there's a drink down there where
good then . 1758521_1758952
&=laugh . 1758952_1759420
where have I told you to go Adam ? 1759420_1762103
&=laugh . 1762103_1762574
you told me that I should have been
that's xxxx right . 1772638_1773463
whereas I was facing another direction and that explains why uh why
oah . 1777596_1778084
okay . 1778084_1778836
so how do you do you wanta make some uh
well uh I mean she's it's quite clear uh what she said that she
I mean she could not have written seven thousand pages &=laugh if
and uh in terms of what a dissertation should be <a> <a> a
uh this meets all those criteria and I would certainly be in favor
are you going to have <some> <some> some suggestions for
<more general> more oral kinds of things . 1832117_1833722
I mean there were a lot of <th> thing that Pat mentioned where
you know . 1840162_1840674
one had to read that three or four times before it became clear
and there's a lot of that uh +//. 1845448_1846850
of course sociologists are afflicted +... 1846850_1848478
when a number of them turn out to be negative and so that you're
I mean I talked to her about ways she could y'know I said can we
and it y'know I had this experience when I was doing my
I got into one chapter was two+hundred and twenty pages long and I
and I took the last page out of the typewriter and I said I'll come
so you say pass . 1915086_1916643
oh yuh . 1916643_1917540
and di ah di is that a uh uh that's a neutral term . 1917522_1921927
I'm not <sure> . 1921927_1924076
<I mean> I <know it's> . 1924076_1925469
<we don't need> no uh what are you looking for <Adam> ? 1925469_1928955
<well> I'm I'm I I I just I guess I have in the back of my mind
<of the committee's response> to the enterprise as a whole . 1936630_1939418
hm . 1939418_1939845
well I think my sense is that uh she has done a good job . 1939845_1945070
and she certainly has uh I mean th this project for her has been
and at the stage of her professional development I think this is
certainly she ought to be commended for the very thing th that Pat
I think in the future she'll have to develop some sense of what
<but> but that may just come come with ex obvious she can't she
problem with that in the dissertation James is that
right right yuh . 1982988_1983408
right but I think I think though she felt this
herself . 1986158_1987179
yuh her fell herself she wasn't really worried about us looking
and so she probably has to develop that sense but I think that'll
oh I I think part of it was that you know that the questions &~th
I raised she got to thinking about kinds of questions . 2002321_2005560
not necessarily about specific things but I I mean I think she's
mm hm . 2014211_2014836
Sherm ? 2014836_2015670
uh it's a fine job by my lights uh I would have wished it were
I have some sympathy for the twenty+five page psych dissertations .
it's th d uh us the uh uh Lee &~th the one comment I'd
and that's &~f that that's fine . 2051920_2054518
uh but it's also uh a limit . 2054518_2057836
uh because it leads her uh for example not to ask such questions as
it is true that in this literature the class variable is
but that's not necessarily the case if you start from the more
rather than the more particular question of given the theories
uh uh uh she could I think write some of this stuff up within the
uh so that she's she's not necessarily limited although I I well
uh I reacted to that forty year old woman comment uh because I
well I can tell you what her view on that is and that
but I'm smarter &=laugh yuh yuh . 2166927_2167756
and I and I've really got to produce and I'm going to . 2167756_2170885
Adam along those lines does she see the length of time it took her
<actually it's> it's not all that long given . 2178536_2182072
the norm in sociology . 2184331_2187162
that I think that the uh the first draft of her proposal was less
and then she did collect you know a substantial amount of data
and I don't know that uh uh given that she did collect her own data
uh and a tremendous amount of analysis I don't know that it was
⌊yuh yuh⌋ .
uh James may be thinking .
mmhm .
more of her total graduate career . 2222877_2225942
but I I do also yuh that's true and I and I think
<mm I would hope so> . 2237775_2239809
mm hm to what extent are these the three theories that
<they are indeed> . 2247111_2247727
<that's it> that's it . 2247727_2248446
yuh yuh <no more theories> . 2248446_2249319
<oh they are the theories> ? 2249319_2250384
that's about it . 2250384_2251339
<yuh yuh they are &~th> . 2251339_2251830
<they are not really representative then> ? 2251830_2252886
<uh well they there are there are variations> . 2252886_2253638
<ah well th yuh> . 2253638_2254491
<xxx a sample of one> ? 2254491_2255365
<in each ok> . 2255365_2256127
there are variations on themes uh but cl uh but I don't know of any
<no well except for the sense that> . 2273780_2274877
so nobody nobody would attack her on that ground then if she . 2274877_2277459
no no no . 2277459_2277852
oh no I don't think so . 2277852_2278658
I think the only thing that would be substantially different would
and that hasn't been tested uh except in very gross
right Spilerman's stuff mm hm . 2303234_2303960
yuh . 2303960_2304325
so I can tell her that I I yuh . 2304325_2309178
she's won . 2309178_2309824
&=laugh she's overcome . 2309824_2312367

figure out how to get out of here . 2341032_2341968

yuh she has they teach I think nine hours . 2353179_2355027
mm . 2355027_2356483
for awhile she was in danger of losing her slot wasn't she ? 2356483_2359534
or wasn't the position originally just a one year position ? 2359534_2361968
yuh it wasn't it wasn't that she was in danger of loosing the
<position yuh yuh> . 2369338_2370014
and uh in point of fact I think it was opened on the basis of an
really very very good . 2381060_2383303
