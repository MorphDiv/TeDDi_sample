what happened to the boy and the girl in the story .
&-um they &-um got happy meals .
and &-um they gotta go to Mcdonalds .
that's all I guess .
&-um when a little boy woke up in the morning &-um he saw his clock
and rubbed his head .
and &-um he looked up at the clock while he was pouring his milk .
and his milk spilled all over .
and &-um when he was trying to tie his shoe <his shoe went through
and then he couldn't get to school &~s +...
he hadta walk to school because the school bus went away without
and he was late .
and the teacher pointed to her watch .
&-um there was this kids .
they were looking behind a bush .
and <they found> they saw a family of &-um aliens .
and they had a weird looking little girl dog mother and father .
and a plain &-um person because they &-um had lots_of feet .
and <um umumumum> when the little girl saw them she started to
and they didn't see them .
but her brother said stop .
I think .
can you think of anything else to put in your story ?
<mm> and they flew on a &-um little spacethip .
but it didn't look much like one .
it was more of an alien spaceship
