&=laughs:multiple they might be so xxx so anyway &-um finished ? 3685_5165
the real item of business for today is &-uh for Rob to give his &-uh practice for his thesis proposal . 5405_12445
this isn't a &-um a straight group meeting either this is &-uh &-uh to be a practice event for &-uh for Rob's defense . 12805_22305
but what we're +//. 23465_24105
the protocol of_course is that we interrupt Rob on any point on either content or &-uh presentation style suggestions or anything because &-um this this committee definitely will interrupt him those of you who have been through this know . 24495_42775
who's on his committee ? 43975_45975
&-um oh it isn't up there . 46895_48315
&-um so Matt of_course and Jim Dimmitt &-um Steve Baker and Dave Sutep who's a professor in physics . 48415_55095
so .
so you have two outside professors ? 55815_57715
mhm .
right .
&-uh although calling Steve an outsider is +/. 58455_62035
yeah ⌈ that's true ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so so ⌋ he's so it's it's good to know your committee just strategically for your defense &-um and &-uh Steve is gonna be already very familiar with this material and is gonna be pretty familiar with it +/. 63455_77495
+, mhm +/.
+, and &-uh &-uh Dave Sutep is gonna be &-uh completely comfortable here . 78155_83215
so &~f for those of you who don't know Dave is the director of the program in complex systems so that that's how you know it makes sense to have a physics professor on this committee . 84015_94295
okay so &-um thank you for coming and I I look forward to your comments however &~sca however scathing they may be . 96435_102815
&-um my talk my proposal is called a market protocol for decentralized task allocation and scheduling . 103695_109635
I would like to start with a concrete example to really motivate the problem I am addressing here . 111835_117995
so this is a a stylized &-um air combat domain . 119055_123155
and what we have here is some commander who wants us to perform an air attack . 123875_127655
and there are various resources &~an and agents that can help the &-um commander accomplish this task . 128555_135655
&-um in this case the commander simply wants to use a bomber squad and a fighter squad for &~th for the air attack and &-um the bomber squad and the fighter squad in turn need &-um each need &~t to take off from an airfield . 137095_150715
&-um for this particular problem there are &~b excess resources there are plenty of airfields to satisfy the demand so we can actually accomplish all the tasks and satisfy this commander without really much difficulty . 151215_162935
now the tricky thing comes in if we actually bring in another commander . 164255_167835
&-um this the second commander wants you &-um perform a ground attack which involves a bomber squad a paratrooper squad and a fighter squad and it can be any of these &-um squads but it &~i he does need all three of those squads . 169235_183015
now the problem is these squads in turn need airfields &~i each one needs an airfield and but we can't satisfy both of these commanders at the same time because they need a total of five &-um squads but there are only four four units of the airfield available . 183325_197265
so &~i if we need to somehow decide what the more valuable task is what the best cost+benefit tradeoff is and &~alloc and in this case reallocate the goods to &-um meet the highest value task . 198425_212165
&-uh in this case if we assume <the commander> the commander two has a +/. 212645_215385
⌈ what's ⌉ +/.
+, higher value we want to reallocate the &-um resources in such a way to satisfy him . 215645_220465
what's the concept of value ? 220925_222325
value I'll I'll get to that &~le let's let's just kind_of leave that a little bit vague right now we'll we'll just say there there's some value to the &-um commanders for accomplishing you know &-um tasks and there may be some costs in providing some of the resources and I'll I'll formally define what what those costs and values look like later . 222935_243335
you know I I think &-uh of_course the reallocation is interesting . 244655_247655
but I wouldn't necessarily &-um trivialize the initial allocation in the first place . 247685_253785
you might wanna just say you know how we come up with this original solution . 253925_257725
&~th in this case it's easy to find one . 258205_260405
but that's part of the work is how to find solutions in these networks . 261265_267105
you know the style of your presentation &~i it says okay you know where &~th I'm really where I'm really starting is this reallocation problem that's not +... 267325_272565
okay &~w &~s so so yes so the the &~fir that first resource allocation was part of the whole allocation problem that wasn't a particularly difficult one &-um it it becomes a really more challenging problem when you have the limited resources . 272955_285475
right . 286955_286995
right so here's for example how <to make it> more difficult . 287395_289335
but also in just mentioning the problem &-um you might want to suggest to them that that the the details of this are really &~ar it's just completely contrived for a DARPA site visitor &=laughs:multiple and &-um &-uh and what you're really after is a general model of &-uh +... 289545_306485
you know these kinds of networks . 308645_309625
okay +... 309985_310205
so what we &~a what I do then so I wanna formalize this model &-um &-um a bit and I do that <in a> in a task dependence network what I call a task dependence network . 314505_326165
that's a very there's a general model for how we can do these &-um these task allocation problems when we have these sort_of hierarchical dependencies and we have to form a supply chain . 326885_337085
&-um so let me explain the portions of the task dependence network . 338385_341625
now these circles throughout the network represent the tasks or the resources . 342065_347505
&-um in in either case I I actually treat them &~i in exactly the same fashion . 348625_353325
I assume that a task is performed by one agent on behalf of another and that the results can't be replicated for can't be directly replicated for other agents . 353465_363065
&~y if you want to have if you wanna have this task performed for say <you know> &~an any this task performed for two agents you would hafta have two agents performing it . 363345_371245
so in that sense the tasks are really the same as any resource any discrete resource these are all discrete so I &-um basically call them goods . 371885_381805
so all these circles represent goods which can be either you know a task or a resource . 382125_385945
&-um on this end I have ⌊ these box ⌋ . 386765_390905
⌈ so ⌉ &-uh you might <another way> &-uh another way to rephrase that might be that tasks are resources that are supplied by other agents and &-uh &~ma might need another word but tasks are resources that are supplied by other agents and then there's some base resources that are supplied in the environment . 390585_412825
&~you that that isn't &~e even necessarily quite the correct characterization you +//. 414515_419335
&~the some of these &~prod &~s well ⌊ I'll &~ge some some agents ⌋ . 419795_421875
⌈ there sometimes there really ⌉ is no definition of task as opposed to resources . 422055_424195
⌊ &~th &~th that's the whole point ⌋ . 424655_425575
⌈ right ⌉ .
⌊ it's just that ⌋ sometimes we think of them as tasks and +/. 425575_426995
+, ⌊ sometimes ⌋ we think of them +/. 427195_427815
+, &~i it's +/.
+, as resources but there's no distinction . 428355_430255
it may be more natural in some problems or another to call it task or resource when you're actually characterizing ⌈ a specific problem ⌉ . 430555_435335
⌊ and some things ⌋ they might actually really be production chains when <I they> should be things that really are thought of as resources . 435335_440235
you know &-uh a supply chain you know producing automobiles or a job shop the intermediate &-um goods may be physical resources that +/. 440705_449465
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ are ⌋ produced . 449585_449965
so on this end the boxes are consumers . 451005_454485
and a consumer simply wants to &-um acquire some good some some good and get some value from doing so . 455425_462965
&-um on the other hand on the other end of the supply chain we have suppliers . 463985_468885
and these suppliers are able to supply a &-um a good &-um and perhaps at some cost . 469385_475985
the interesting agents in the system are really these ones in the middle . 477245_480365
all these boxes in the middle are what I call producers . 480725_482845
and a producer &-um has some set of inputs and a single output so it it &~require it must &-um acquire all of its inputs in_order_to produce its output . 483345_493065
it cannot &-um do anything with a with only a subset of its &-um inputs . 493725_499065
so in this case we say that the if that the inputs are complementary &~whe when you have to &~r acquire all of them to produce . 499625_506185
&-um for the &~pre first example &-um this is a solution allocation for the problem and what a solution is is okay &~fir first let me back up and say what <an allocation is> an allocation is just a subset <of the> of the task dependence network that indicates which agents bought and sold which goods . 508625_527025
&-um and in this case &-um the &-um the green circles are the goods that are bought or &~sol that are bought and sold and the green agents are the agents that bought or sold something <and the> and the dark &~arro +//. 527985_543125
actually I didn't explain what these arcs are &-um in the previous thing the &-um the arcs let me go back in in +//. 543665_552645
the arcs indicate input output relationships so if an arc from an agent to a good indicates that the agent can &-um &~pr &~s supply that good in some sense and an arc from a good to an agent indicates that the agent &~ca wants to acquire &-um one unit of that good as input or for consumption . 553385_574965
so going back to the &~s to an allocation a dark arrow indicates that the agent &-um either bought or sold the good and the grey arrows are &-um are failed attempts to acquire or sell goods . 576825_589765
you said this was the first example ? 590265_591805
yes . 593025_593425
this +//. 594045_594145
&~s so +/.
⌈ &~th this ⌉ +/.
+, basically I don't +/. 594705_595125
+, ⌊ this ⌋ +/.
+, have this commander two here . 595285_596305
oh . 596425_596665
but you have the ground attack there . 597185_598885
well we could say that this this agent exists here but is is not accomplishing anything . 599025_604165
it might be more clear to people if you don't have that ground attack <thing there> if you claim this as the first example . 605265_612725
but actually in a way it might be clearer if you do because +/. 614485_617145
⌈ well but &~thi but it looks like ⌉ +/. 617405_618545
+, ⌊ it shows that that's the way ⌋ you can &~ha that you can accommodate having these things that are just not useful +/. 618565_622545
+, right +/.
+, and it doesn't wreck anything . 622965_623805
that's right ⌈ &-um ⌉ . 625605_626365
⌊ so ⌋ these are all the +/. 626365_626985
⌈ but ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ capabilities ⌋ in the system +/. 627105_628105
+, ⌈ just ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &~tha ⌋ those don't change what's &~c what you're capable of doesn't change the only thing that changes is what's what's wanted . 628715_633935
so you might wanna so if you wanna make that point then and keep it this way then you have to point out see the just the graph makes it look a_lot more like the second example than the first example . 636235_645375
so you have to point out that the thing on the bottom isn't commander it's just the capability . 646235_651695
okay mkay +... 653275_658195
&-um so sorta explain what the allocation is now a solution allocation is one where one or more of the consumers actually acquire their goods and there's basically a complete supply chain all the way back to the suppliers . 658245_672045
what that means is well there's two things to have a complete supply chain one is that for any good the number of input arcs equals the number of &~arc output arcs or in other words supply equals demand . 672805_682705
&-um another requirement is any producer that is selling its output good must also acquire all of its input goods so that is we &~r require that the producers be feasible . 683485_693865
and again here's another example of a ⌈ of a &~s ⌉ . 695505_698385
⌊ you gonna ⌋ explain the light green ? 698385_699265
yeah I'll &~d I'll do that right now . 699985_701645
&-um well maybe I'll &~d I'll do it in a minute . 701865_704185
so also I do have I wanna point out there's this producer here that is colored light green &-um what I've I've done that to distinguish it from the other producers &-um this producer did acquire its input but didn't sell its output . 704845_719565
now that is allowed in a solution it's not &-uh &~es the most &~i it's a little bit kind of wasteful to use some resources that &-um really don't you know that are that the producer doesn't want because it's not producing an output . 720505_733825
but we we need to consider this possibility in in these &-um solutions . 734665_739745
and again I showed here here's the example again with the second commander coming in and shows how the &-um <how the> how the links change to feed the supply chain into the second commander . 740705_752285
&-um I wanna talk a little go back a little bit to the costs and values I that I hinted at . 753585_761645
&-um I assume that each consumer is interested in potentially a you know some set of goods but the consumer only wants to acquire one unit of one of the goods . 761985_773905
&-um so basically <you know> it can acquire some value for any particular good but its total value is just the maximum of all those values of the goods that it obtains . 774845_783485
the suppliers &-um have some opportunity costs for supplying the goods this can either be some real costs for you know &~t real monetary costs for &-um supplying the good or maybe some lost value from some other use it could have put the &-um good to . 783985_799645
so in this case I just say each supplier its its total &-um opportunity cost is the sum of of the individual opportunity costs for each good . 800265_808285
&-um . 809665_809725
so &-um +... 810525_811285
&-uh you said you have a a the quantifier of G and X in the second bullet you probably should have it in the first bullet too . 812965_820045
so the max over G should be G and X . 820305_824185
here ? 824965_825225
yeah . 825565_825985
oh yes you're right . 826245_827045
you're right . 827185_842845
(0.4) now although this this may seem like a somewhat limiting &-um &-um set of utility functions.
it turns out that actually &~w &-um with the consumer value you can model quite a a large number of problems by playing some tricks with the suppliers .
⌈ &-um ⌉ . 849905_849945
⌊ producers ⌋ . 851305_851425
&~w yes with the producers . 851425_852005
and with the producers or with multiple consumers . 852325_854945
if we wanted to actually model &-um additive &-um value with the consumers we can simply simply replicate the consumers and have each different consumer &-um want some different inputs and then and look at the you know the the total the sum value of them . 855245_870205
&-um another &~op possibility is maybe a consumer wants to acquire multiple goods &-um rather than just a single good . 870405_877245
well we can do that if we look at here . 877785_879125
one way to look at you know this &-uh commander two is we can see that what it what the commander really wants is these three separate goods . 880325_887525
and this producer is basically defining this good to be the combination of these goods . 887925_893925
<so we can> &-um so we can actually have a a large range model a large range of problems and value functions with this simple &-um &-um setup . 894365_903805
&-um now I wanna talk about the value of the overall solution . 904445_907525
excuse_me &-uh &-uh is the second bullet is there a typo to have a CO on the left hand side and a OC on the right hand side ? 908785_914745
yep . 915045_915205
(0.5) so first I'll say that the the empty allocation where no agent where there's no agent buys or sells anything I just applied that &~val the value of that to be zero . 916065_929565
now the value of a solution is just the sum of all the the values of all that the consumers get minus the sum of the opportunity costs of all the suppliers in the solution . 930625_941905
and then I define a globally efficient which you can also call optimal &-um efficient is basically the economic term for optimal allocation is &-um simply maximizes &-um is is either a solution or a empty allocation which maximizes the total value . 942825_960625
let me just stop you for a minute Rob +/. 962925_965785
+, so just as a check I mean I I I can't judge it because I'm too familiar does this make sense to those those of you who are not so familiar ? 964155_970875
xxx .
I think that's a good point and even &~i even whether there's a slide or not it I mean part of what we're referring to is that you started so quickly jumping into something that it wasn't +/. 988235_997795
⌈ &~s &~s &~s <giving some room> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <it wasn't> clear ⌋ so so so we're actually you know maybe it's an introduction with that first thing what I'm gonna give is an account of how these chains get formed how to formalize what they mean you know +/. 998595_1009175
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ just what you're doing ⌋ .
⌈ why you're interested ⌉ in this ? 1009755_1011135
yeah you don't want to bog down you don't want to bog it down +/. 1012115_1014635
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, down too much with the complete thing but I think you know that Stacy's point is that &~a at least have some sense of what the ⌈ the heading is ⌉ . 1014595_1023235
⌊ &~s &~s ⌋ so say you know I'm looking at these task allocation problems where you form supply chains I'm going to start by giving some &~e motivating examples then I'll get more into the &~actu the the detail of how how I model and formalize the problem and then and later talk about some of the mechanisms for achieving that ? 1023375_1038415
&~s something like ⌈ that <at least> ⌉ . 1039015_1039795
⌊ &~y yes ⌋ yes if you express that content I think you would +//. 1039795_1041815
&~i is that right Stacy would that help it ? 1042215_1044615
xxx .
okay . 1044615_1044995
&~s so getting back to your question about this slide ? 1046615_1048595
I'm pretty familiar with this but I'm &~h having trouble understanding the math . 1049395_1053195
I mean &~th there's hardly any math there but I think if maybe the symbols or +... 1054135_1058375
or maybe just if you had a picture for each of those two . 1059075_1063155
yeah &~i I ⌈ kind of ⌉ +... 1064375_1065275
⌊ I dunno ⌋ I don't know but I I'm +/. 1065695_1067155

I went kind of back and forth on that myself &-um yeah I could I mean I could +//. 1068835_1073815
this is a pretty simple concept I could just say you know say this is the sum this this is a little nicer way to represent this +... 1074255_1081375
I I don't but &~in &~may maybe someone can give me some suggestions I +... 1082155_1086455
&~how is is is it ⌈ the &~equ ⌉ . 1088895_1091035
⌊ well I mean ⌋ in those two examples those two equations X is not the same thing right ? 1091035_1095555
we're not looking at . 1096295_1097215
no that's well I mean I can use some different letter to indicate it . 1097635_1103295
yeah ⌈ but that would ⌉ .
⌊ but suppliers ⌋ only supply one thing . 1103475_1106635
no .
not necessarily . 1107675_1108555
so it's so he has changed the model since the last time I saw it I think (0.4) . 1109395_1112815
it it &~do I mean it turns out it doesn't really matter whether they supply one thing or a multiple things because +/. 1115115_1121055
right +/.
+, it the the value is added the cost is additive across suppliers &~an &~i within a supplier and across suppliers it it's really just a it's just a matter of convenience in modeling some particular problem . 1121505_1134165
&~sh can you say again why it's the max ? 1136365_1138085
the max ? 1138885_1139365
I'm just +/. 1139525_1140045
good +/.
+, &~a what what I'm assuming here is that a consumer only wants to acquire one good . 1140265_1144805
okay .
or ⌈ if that ⌉ . 1146305_1149725
⌊ &~o &~o ⌋ &~o only gets value from one good and and we assume that &-uh &~i if it ends up with some set of goods &~i well &~i it gets the value of the maximum good and <all the> all the extra goods don't &~acqui provide any further value . 1149325_1161425
(0.4) .
okay . 1162765_1165565
but +... 1167185_1167545

well &-um well they're not special cases of producers because see a producer I mean &~i I'll get into this later but a &~produ consumers and suppliers can get away with really really &~s like really simple bidding policies and it's a little more complex for the producers because they have hafta they hafta get apart all their inputs in_order_to sell their output . 1353635_1375555

and whether it's you know what the combination rule is inherent in the type of &-uh (0.6) . 1474975_1480175
so let me go on &~t &-uh I wanna spend a &~l I mentioned that this is task allocation and scheduling . 1487025_1492365
and I wanna &~sh &-um &~su suggest how we can actually use this model to &~d perform scheduling . 1492905_1497265
now there are &~m this is not necessarily the only way we would do scheduling but it it's certainly I think that it's a fairly general approach . 1497725_1504405
&-um I'm assuming that &-uh we're &~h we have discrete time scheduling where we have some &~hori some some range of of discrete time slots that we would want to schedule the &-um the goods over . 1504905_1517065
&-um the key point here is that we multiply the goods times the number of time slots so we +//. 1518245_1523965
the airfield output it can be available at time one two three or four . 1524285_1528185
and now there are certain times where we may want to make use of multiple units of an airfield maybe two consecutive time units of an airfield in which case we have arbitrageurs &-um which will &-um an arbitrageur will take some number of consecutive &~inpu &-uh consecutive &-um time units for some good and produce a &~temp what I call a temporal bundle good . 1529705_1554785
so this good represents two time units of of &~airf of an airfield &-um ending at time two . 1555305_1563085
and this one represents two time units ending at time three and so on . 1564085_1567065
&-uh in this model I assume that the fighters wanna acquire wanna acquire &~the one of these these bundles they don't care which airfield they use but they wanna acquire both of the units from the same airfield which is why I've split them off in this particular model . 1567745_1581905
&-um ⌊ I'll ⌋ . 1582705_1583565
⌈ &-uh ⌉ quick question couldn't you combine T equals two T equals four &~to together to make a to make a bundle for two units ending at time four ? 1585625_1594345
it depends on how &~y what how ⌊ you're putting it's ⌋ . 1594485_1597105

let the fighters get stuff from either airfield now when they were kinda stationed at an airfield before . 1611625_1617325
well I'm <I'm just> &~as I'm just saying well &~l say for this problem they can &~i &~i &~pr &~prev previously they could get it from actually from either one a@l or two b@l that was the case before ⌊ if ⌋ . 1617685_1627205

oh right +/. 1631145_1631585

okay . 1639645_1639925
&-um what's that little box ? 1640125_1641865

it can be hard to read . 1702695_1703615
I'll I'll play with that to make it better might put the at back up up here . 1704135_1708075
write an at sign or something instead of AT . 1708315_1710235
mkay .
now I also wanna mention that sometimes when we &~w go into scheduling we don't want to make all the goods we don't wanna make them all temporal goods like this . 1710735_1718655
&-um I'm assuming in in this problem &-um that the fighters &~we we're just scheduling the airfield over some short period of time . 1719195_1726295
but once the fighters go out they take several hours to perform their their attack and that's beyond the scheduling horizon . 1726595_1732715
so I assume that actually the &~f using the fighter squad &~tha &~tha I &~s say that that's actually consumed and you can't use the same fighter squad over multiple time periods . 1732915_1741695
so I don't multiply this time four times I can just have a single unit of it and to perform a fighter attack you have to acquire one unit of it and this guarantees that you +//. 1742115_1751135
only one of these time slots can can actually be active . 1751515_1755595
for the fighter attack . 1756795_1757575
&~w why do you have a another good at the very end ? 1758395_1760795

I don't know if this would work but if you could like take the previous network in a little box up in the corner and and draw put you know some color on the part that you exploding that might ⌊ help place it ⌋ &=laughs . 1796745_1810265

I don't know if that would work but it would help &~u help us transition to this chunk . 1821945_1826925
I certainly should explain up front that this is only a portion of the network . 1827065_1830405
that's something I &~f I neglected to do . 1830825_1832585
&-um now this is at the other end of the network a portion of the other end with with commander one &-um actually yeah this's commander one and &~i and it wants an air attack and &~w it's &~happeni it can have the air attack at time two three or four . 1833285_1846685
and we might assume that the commander has a different value for acquiring the air attack at the different times maybe earlier is better or maybe we could even say that you know &~aft at time four is too late and we might have a zero value there for instance . 1847485_1861345
so &-um and then this is where I go and talk about the values again . 1862925_1867925

not again but ⌊ for the first time ⌋ .
⌈ &~or or I instead ⌉ &=laughs:multiple so I just talked about values now you know . 1871085_1876765

so any result I prove about the general task allocation model will by definition apply to the scheduling also . 1894285_1901105
so &-um this is &~an this &~is this shows that I have a very general model and and I can simultaneously do the scheduling and the task allocation . 1902465_1911445
so I'm going +//. 1913045_1913705
&~g in general I'll be focusing on the basic task allocation model without looking at a any particular scheduling problems generally because it takes too much space . 1913965_1922065
&-um so I've talked about the you know what a a &~va you know a a an efficient solution is in terms of the value to the agents &-um what we want to do is to somehow &~form you know construct these solution supply chains and we want we &~wa want and and and preferably we'd like to have very high &~v value &-um efficient solutions . 1923445_1945945
&-um the question is how do we do that ? 1946845_1948045
we can certainly do this in a centralized system using various . 1948405_1951605

+, so &-um so we can certainly do this in a centralized solution using various and or search techniques . 1966085_1972485
but I'm assuming that we actually are working in a distributed system of &~s &-um where you know &~p these agents are actually you know autonomous units that have their own local information and we they they aren't aware necessarily aware of the whole system and their maybe don't want to reveal all their information to the whole system &-um directly . 1973065_1993785

<what is> what is kind_of the extreme decentralized approach to this ? 2056245_2059485
&-um and the economic answer to that is to introduce a price system . 2060865_2065705
and what a price system is is it just &-um a &~p &-um assigns a nonnegative number to all the goods in the system here are just these numbers with the dollar signs next to the goods indicate prices . 2066305_2077625
&-um what these what the agents do +//. 2078765_2081045
what these prices do is indicate the relative global value of the various goods &-um <as compared to the> as compared to the other goods . 2081365_2089185
and the agents then will use the this local information of their goods of interest and the prices thereof to guide their decision making process and determining the final allocation . 2089865_2101205

that's a good idea . 2188265_2188845

what is the &~fron yes &~tha that's a bug that's not green . 2205335_2208895
thank you . 2210315_2210655
so what's going on here ? 2211015_2212795
well the &~s so how these agents use these prices &~t to guide their decision making ? 2212935_2218215
well these these consumers want to &-um acquire their &~in acquire a good at a price below their value . 2218715_2227715
so you can see that this commander's &-um &~ha &~i is a is acquiring its its input good for twenty two dollars which is less than its value of thirty . 2228035_2236095
and the suppliers on the other end are willing to sell their good if they can &-um recoup their costs &~a at least recoup their costs . 2237015_2244695
now the producers in the middle don't have any intrinsic value for the goods so what they're looking for is just strictly profit they they're willing &~t they they'd be willing to be active in the solution if the &-um sum of their &~i if their output &~co &-um value their output price is greater than or equal to the sum of their input prices . 2245705_2264605
and this is just &-um a formal statement of that &-um the agents are +//. 2264905_2269585
ideally the agents would want to maximize their surplus where the surplus is defined as I specified . 2269755_2274875
it's basically the difference between the value they get and the costs incurred . 2275395_2279695
(0.5) so the in the journal equilibrium approach &-um the kind of the ideal situation is to end up with a competitive equilibrium <through some &~m you know somehow> to get a &~c competitive equilibrium . 2281375_2295855
what this means is simply that &-um there's a set of prices such that the +//. 2295925_2300625
&~an and an allocation such that the agents get an optimal surplus allocation at the equilibrium prices . 2301025_2306725
&-um what this means is the consumer will get the single good that maximizes its surplus the different +//. 2308125_2313205
so the the the maximizes the difference between the value of the good it gets and the price of that good . 2313605_2318225
if it gets any other goods in this model those the prices better be zero because they're not any +//. 2318545_2323725
adding any extra value . 2323765_2325045
&-um a supplier will simply sell each good that +//. 2326105_2329465
for which it can &-um get acquire &-uh work +//. 2329745_2332765
that it can sell for a price higher than the value for that good . 2332985_2335305
and the producers will buy all their inputs and sell their output if they're profitable &-um otherwise they wanna trade nothing . 2336065_2343725
and so &~tha that's so this includes both the &-um the optimal the optimality constraint and also the &~fe the feasibility constraint I talked about before . 2344985_2354765
and also would require that supply and demand be balanced . 2355285_2357845
but &~i &-uh &~someo some producers are at a negative value +/. 2358705_2361865
that +/.
+, ⌈ they can't have that ⌉ . 2362785_2363025
⌊ then that's ⌋ not an equilibrium by this definition . 2363105_2364985
oh . 2365265_2365645
so ⌈ lemme talk ⌉ . 2367425_2368885
⌊ do you need ⌋ to explain the &-uh competitiveness assumption ? 2369005_2372565
are you making a competitiveness assumption ? 2372945_2374565
it's kinda well it's implicit in this &~i I'm I'm not talking about any +//. 2375525_2379765
I'm not talking about +//. 2379945_2380385
competitiveness is &~be &~whe is when you're talking about behavior I'm not talking about behavior the only assumption is here is that they're optimizing with respect to prices only . 2380725_2387645
the current prices ⌈ so ⌉ . 2387745_2388805
⌊ right ⌋ &+wi with respect to some set of prices . 2388805_2391065
I'm not I'm I'm &-uh sidestepping the issue of how you would get a competitive equilibrium right now . 2391825_2396965
right but &~di but what makes it a competitive equilibrium is that everything is relative to given prices and that's stated +/. 2397395_2403795
yeah +/.
+, you know ⌈ there ⌉ . 2404475_2404695
⌊ right ⌋ .
so what are the +//. 2405975_2407075
so here's an example of a competitive equilibrium . 2407515_2409755
&-um &-um in this case &-um you notice that for all the green agents they're making a positive surplus or a nonnegative surplus at least . 2410935_2420475
so for instance this agent &-um its its output is six dollars and fifty cents and its inputs are six dollars so it's making a sixty cent profit a fifty cent profit and it's willing to be active . 2420575_2431475
so &~tho those are A B to E . 2431815_2433555
A B to E ⌈ yes that's ⌉ . 2433995_2435295
⌊ and same with ⌋ B C to .
yep .
B D .
&=laughs B &~s B C D to E . 2435535_2443455
yep .
and then just E to F . 2445075_2446455
yeah ⌈ I guess you could xxx ⌉ . 2447055_2449835
⌊ no D E no no it's it's the D E to F ⌋ . 2447495_2449935
⌈ why oh yeah ⌉ .
⌊ just go through all those bullets ⌋ and make sure they have the right labels . 2449955_2452055
yep yep . 2452075_2452475
yeah &=laughs:multiple .
okay &-um so so &~thi so for instance this agent is profitable . 2452875_2457675
&=laughs:S2 this agent &-um has the input costs &~i input prices are totalled to seven but its output is only six fifty so it wouldn't want to take part in the solution so therefore you can see that it's excluded . 2458175_2469015
(0.4) now just by definition the equilibrium is stable with respect to prices . 2473615_2477775
&-um another important ⌈ aspect ⌉ . 2479215_2480735
⌊ &~wa &~wa wait ⌋ what does that mean ? 2481035_2481495
&~i it's stable with respect to prices meaning the agent no agent would want to &-um do anything differently at the current prices . 2482355_2489215
unilaterally . 2489895_2490355
&-um unilaterally &~actu &~actua yes . 2491115_2493355
no individual agent would want to deviate from the allocation it receives it it couldn't do any better at the current prices . 2494195_2500855
the &-um equilibrium is globally efficient so what this means &~i &-um &~i in &~thi for this model when the agents optimize locally we're also optimizing globally . 2502515_2512875
and this is due to the fact that they have this &~qua what we call this quasilinear value which means they they value goods in their value is &~l linear in the money the amount of money they acquire . 2513135_2523715
and that means they can transfer the utility on a common scale . 2524235_2526535
so so you know that only the only competitive &~e equilibrium prices that exist are are the efficient prices or support the efficient allocation there's no inefficient &~c equilibrium ? 2527075_2541295
equilibrium is globally efficient . 2541675_2544635
&~i it any +/. 2544795_2545175
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ there ⌋ may be multiple equilibria but any equilibria you can you come up with hasta be globally efficient . 2545495_2550455
but that's not necessarily true for all discrete resource ⌈ allocations ⌉ . 2550635_2557055
⌊ no ⌋ it's true for this ⌈ model you want to point out that you've ⌉ +/. 2557055_2559375
⌊ it's true for this model &~y ⌋ +/.
+, proved it in your proposal +/. 2559695_2560835
+, yep +/.
+, there's a proof of this . 2561355_2562095
⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ &~y &~y ⌋ yeah I I proved it for this particular &~m model <you could> you could come up with different value functions for which that may not hold true . 2562555_2569515
okay .
and and and &~a as you know bundle pricing schemes . 2569595_2574035
&-um &~als but unfortunately an equilibrium actually may not exist when you have the discrete goods in complementarities which we do have in this problem . 2574975_2585155
I'll show you a particular example of &~ho where you may not have equilibrium . 2585955_2589935
&-um basically what what I showed here are the constraints on the prices for all the goods &-um this ⌈ constraint ⌉ . 2591135_2596895
⌊ so so first ⌋ of all what's different from this and the previous example ? 2597095_2599355
okay the the only difference here is that the consumer has a lower value . 2599585_2604045
&-um yes I'll maybe explain that so this is showing . 2605265_2608845
what was it before ? 2609105_2609685
&-uh I think it was fifteen . 2610405_2611725
&-um now the the key to &~h here is that the total cost for the solution is &-um is seven and the consumer has a value of nine . 2612885_2622405
so it +//. 2622825_2623105
I &~me if we were to have an equilibrium it should be this solution because that's efficient . 2623325_2628245
however I'm going to show that we can't have an equilibrium if the consumer has a &~pr value this low . 2629865_2634245
and the reason it +//. 2635425_2636025
so if we have we look at this &-um &-um constraint this is to ensure that that this agent is profitable . 2636205_2643965
on the other hand this constraint is to ensure that this agent is not profitable because if we raise this sufficiently high &-um then this agent can't make a profit on there . 2645285_2657385
well what that means that if you take these two constraints and keep them together we have that price the price of F hasta be greater than or equal to eleven . 2657985_2665185
so even though &-um we +//. 2666405_2667885
the &-um &~thi this solution would be &~e this particular solution would be efficient for the consumer having a value range from seven +//. 2668555_2676735
from anywhere above seven we actually can't have an equilibrium if its value is below eleven . 2677115_2682055
well the the consumer shouldn't be green I don't think . 2683195_2685895
no I'm just showing I'm saying this is what the allocation would be . 2686555_2691975
oh the green is the +/. 2692335_2693275
⌈ I'm I'm just ⌉ +/. 2693395_2693755
+, ⌊ is the ⌋ optimal allocation but . 2693795_2695195
so that . 2695375_2695695
oh it's just a solution . 2695835_2696655
it's just some it's it's &~so it's a solution allocation that that it happens to be the optimal one . 2696935_2702015
so the +/. 2702055_2702835
⌈ <yeah but> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ minimum ⌋ cost of the solution is really seven . 2703315_2705275
&~ye yes +/. 2706195_2706875
⌈ I don't know if that's your right the terminology ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ the if the consumer ⌋ had a value as low as seven we would still have +//. 2707575_2711175
it would still be efficient to +//. 2711315_2712615
this solution would still be efficient . 2713015_2714135
however we +//. 2715255_2715695
for for &~c for a certain range of consumer values we can't get an equilibrium . 2716235_2719815
and the way you explained it was you know that price hasta be high enough &~su such that the supply +//. 2720945_2727145
&-um the producer was not active +/. 2728645_2730825
correct +/. 2731185_2731345
+, but &-um why is it the case that we don't want him to be active ? 2731465_2735085
because if ⌈ this ⌉ +/. 2735525_2736545
⌊ I mean ⌋ why do you want to force ⌈ him to be ⌉ +/. 2736545_2737185
+, ⌊ &~w &~w well first ⌋ thing we have to remember this this producer hasta acquire this input . 2737185_2742385
+, right +/.
+, so that means that this this producer cannot +//. 2742865_2746765
should not be allowed to +/. 2747225_2748165
+, ⌊ so that ⌋ therefore this producer hasta supply this input since this +//. 2748665_2751925
and therefore this producer shouldn't end up buying anything it <since it> since it can't buy this it shouldn't do anything at all by the equilibrium conditions it &~sh either sell its output and buy &~th all its inputs or else do nothing . 2752485_2763925
that's the only way to have a solution here . 2766065_2767965
I get it .
the constraint on &-uh price of C should that be greater than or equal to one ? 2769585_2774145
no less than or equal to one because we don't want this supplier +/. 2774715_2777715
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to be ⌋ active . 2777935_2778355
you might +//. 2779235_2782295
you could put for the consumer's value V between seven and eleven . 2782735_2787475
or I don't +//. 2788935_2790055
I mean &~f so what you're saying is for any value in that range there's no equilibrium . 2790415_2794655
yeah &~y that might be clearer just to say well . 2794835_2797135
so actually &~w I'm not sure why it's the the &-uh constraint why is it greater than five because the price of C can be as high as one ⌈ in each case ⌉ ? 2798465_2805625
⌊ well it can be ⌋ okay but the higher that this is the higher &-um let me see (0.6) you're right so this ⌈ could be ⌉ . 2805625_2814825
⌊ so D ⌋ can be as low as four really ⌈ and still exclude ⌉ . 2814945_2816565
⌊ it could be ⌋ as low as four . 2816565_2817565
it could be as low as four you're right . 2817965_2820285
so it's really only ten now I mean still (0.13) . 2820385_2822505
yep .
though though I'm &~ac yes . 2839145_2840425
so so &~s equilibria don't always exist . 2841565_2845105
now now I have &~b sometimes they do and sometimes they don't . 2845905_2849105
the question is when they do exist how can we reach them and &~wha you know what do we do when we don't have equilibria in or can we even always each reach equilibria when they exist ? 2849545_2859945
&-um in the auction theory literature there's been a_lot_of work looking at price based auction mechanisms that try and reach equilibria or some approximation of equilibria sometimes you can't reach it exactly or &~o and <when they> when they don't each reach equilibria the idea is to hopefully have produce an allocation with a sufficiently high &-um &~wi with a fairly high efficiency . 2860665_2882245
&-um one common approach to this &-um using these priced based methods is the simultaneous &-um ascending m@l plus first price auction . 2883185_2892345
and this was actually used for the &-um FCC &-um radio spectrum auctions a few years ago . 2893365_2898945
&-um .
really was it m@l plus first product ? 2901045_2902205
&=laughs:multiple .
I'm &~s okay I I there was +//. 2902645_2903805
you're right it was a simultaneous ascending auction this this is a variant of the type of auctions that were used for the FCC auctions . 2904045_2909445
they had a_lot_of other rules in there too ⌈ right ⌉ ? 2910195_2912335
right . 2912855_2913095
so this is a variant it's not exactly the same . 2913095_2915275
so when you say often used say &~simul just simultaneous +/. 2915335_2917555
yeah +/.

+, ⌊ we're using a &~parti ⌋ +/. 2919695_2920235
+, ⌈ then that's commonly ⌉ used and here's our . 2920415_2921535
yep .
we're using a particular variant with a an m@l plus first price auction rule . 2921735_2925515
so there's an auction for each good . 2925895_2927335
&-um to &~kee one important point is these &~auct this auction is two sided . 2928455_2931695
both the buyers and the sellers will bid in the auction . 2932015_2935195
and as an iterative asynchronous auction that runs &-um you know according to this &~bi you know high level structure . 2936295_2943155
&-um first some agents bid and whenever an auction receives a bid it issues a price quote . 2943875_2949755
and then &-um then maybe some agents when they receive that price quote will decide to change their bid in which case the auction will submit a new price quote and &~re repeats this continuously until the agents stop bidding . 2951015_2964255
at which point we've reached quiescence . 2964635_2965995
so that's kind_of weird but what is it what is the bid this is supposed to be the program for the auction ? 2966595_2972115
&=laughs:SUm .
&-um this is really the protocol for the agents and the &~auc the interaction between the agents and the auction . 2972815_2978635
I mean &~i I could say a received bid . 2979035_2980615
⌊ &~y yeah you could say received it ⌋ . 2981055_2981215
⌈ so how about ⌉ how about just instead of repeating anything how about you have a loop that says something like until quiescence on bid issue price quote . 2981395_2990115
&=laughs:multiple &-uh and then clear . 2990995_2993855
<on bid> . 2995135_2995795
<well but wait> the point is it's event driven . 2996255_2997755
the auction +/. 2998335_2998635
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ from the &-uh ⌉ the auction is completely event driven . 2999055_3000455
it receives bid when it receives bid it's &-uh does something +/. 3001455_3003775
+, right right right +/. 3004095_3004535
+, and then when quiescence is reached it exits that event driven mode and just does something . 3004895_3010475
okay . 3011055_3011255
I'll agree to that . 3012015_3013355
so &~tha that continues until the agents stop bidding at which point the auction's &~e the auctions will clear . 3013955_3020055
and the clearings determines the final prices for the goods and actually I should explain what the price quotes are I think I glossed +/. 3020615_3027115
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.

so the &~auct &~th the &~whene whenever an auction receives a bid it will issue a new price quote . 3036315_3043135
and a price quote basically provides some intermediate information which &-um specifies the &-um &~w what the prices would be now based on the current state of bids . 3043355_3053995
now of_course this is subject to change because once the agents receive these price quotes they may want to submit new bids . 3054665_3060505
so &-um every time so every time the agents do submit a new bid the auction then submits a new you know releases a new price quote . 3061045_3067445
and this continues until all the agents stop bidding at which point we're at quiescence &~w what I call quiescence . 3067785_3073565
when this is finished the &-um auctions will clear . 3074265_3077565
and a clearing &~ba it determines the final prices it determines an allocation which specifies which agents get what . 3078505_3085485
now throughout this bidding process the auctions &-um require that both the buy bids and the sell bids must &~i increase . 3086885_3094005
now this is a little bit different from standard auction &~au much of the auction literature &-um where only the buy bids must increase but we do find that &-um requiring both buy and sell bids to increase &-um is is important for &~pr &-um proving some of the conversions properties we achieve . 3095085_3111085
it's different mainly because most most ascending mechanisms &~ther are only one sided . 3111385_3116025
that's true . 3116185_3116445
so +/.
+, well <there are> there are some some there are some two sided options where the sells must go down and the buys must go up but . 3117455_3125075
&-um &~anoth I don't wanna go into too much detail about what's involved &~volved in the clearing but the important point is that the auctions balance the reported supply and demand at &~unif at a uniform price so each auction &~ha specifies a single price at which all the agents trade at at that auction . 3125275_3143955
now this is a very complicated problem to analyze &-um you know the ideal &~s &-um &~sit you &~kn &~tr &~tr traditional &~s approach would be to &-um calculate a Bayes_Nash equilibrium on behalf of the +//. 3147075_3158995
for each of the agents and assume that the agents behave rationally &~a according to a Bayes_Nash equilibrium . 3159355_3164475
unfortunately doing so is &~k is kind_of beyond the state of the art and and for something this complex so we are simply assume that the &-um the agents use some very simple bidding policies that do obey the ascending restriction and also can obey the &~decentral &~tr decentralization constraint in that the agents only consider the goods of direct interest to them . 3164645_3188585
so the suppliers &-um simply bid their fixed I should change that to cost they they simply bid what their costs are for their goods . 3190035_3197975
and &-um and a consumer will &-um start by bidding zero for all the its goods of interest and whenever it's losing whenever it's not winning a bid it will raise its bid on on one of its goods of interest that &~wi would maximize its surplus at the current prices and it increments it by a small amount . 3199075_3221255
&-um the producer is is the the interesting agent here as I mentioned for its output ⌊ &~i ⌋ . 3222425_3229865
⌈ I'm ⌉ sorry it it increments beyond the current quote . 3229985_3232185
&~y yes a small amount beyond the current price quote . 3232485_3234825
okay +/.
+, the producer will bid for its output the sum of its current of of the current prices of its inputs . 3236405_3242245
and it will also add in a small increment for each input that it's currently losing . 3243365_3247285
and that's under the assumption that if it's losing an input it could actually win it if it bid a little bit higher than the current price . 3247705_3254025
&-um for the inputs a producer will start by bidding zero and then will increment its a bid on an input whenever it's infeasible that is when it's winning its output but losing that particular input . 3255825_3268045
now &~sh I'll give you a concrete example of the producer here . 3268905_3271185
now this is a producer &-um the prices are specified here in the current bids the green arrows indicate bids that it's currently winning and this red arrow indicates the bid that it's currently losing . 3271545_3281745
so the producer has no reason to raise its input bid on A because it's winning it . 3283245_3289305
however since so it holds that &~pr bid at two . 3290945_3293305
however the producer is winning its output but losing this input . 3294225_3298985
so it would raise its bid on B to two . 3299605_3302605
&-um for its output it will bid the sum of its input prices two plus one and it will also add an increment on &~f for this bid for this bid because it's losing it so it will bid a total of four . 3304405_3316425
here &~i I'm I'm assuming that it it has an we have an increment of one dollar . 3317225_3320045
then why is it that the suppliers and the &~consume the suppliers and the producers when they're selling things they're not doing anything strategic they're just bidding their top valuation . 3322645_3335385

no we we shouldn't expect any sort_of incentive compatibility . 3454885_3457905
yeah it only makes it worse when things are iterative . 3458425_3460045
&~w well another thing is it's really hard to talk about &~ince you can't talk about incentive compatibility for the &~pruc producers anyways you can only talk about incentive compatibility when you have a a a set value for a good . 3460595_3470595

&-um I was wondering is there some way you could describe the producer's &-um bid on his output as a function of the price quote ? 3535915_3545795
like it can only raise it if if its you can imagine that if its &~ha if its costs are greater than the current &-um &-uh bid price I mean than any buyer's willing to pay then it might choose to just raise it as little as possible . 3547125_3566925
but &~i if it's actually less than some buyer's willing to pay it could raise it up to that that price and that would be profit maximizing a simple profit maximizing bid . 3567855_3578155
and it probably turns out that as the network progresses the consumers never bid any more than they have to so that it stays at this lower the lower bound . 3578715_3588155
so the . 3590375_3590675
can you repeat I &~did I didn't get the proposal ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 3591275_3593115
⌊ yeah ⌋ . 3593155_3593395
so an explanation for why this might be a reasonable strategy could be that you could +//. 3594375_3599275
a simple bidding policy for the producer would be to bid as much as anybody's willing to pay . 3599755_3605755
but you +/.
⌈ but just ⌉ +/.

well there's a price quote . 3608775_3609635
but no no &-um but &-um what anybody's willing to pay it comes from the consumers way down here . 3610535_3615875

so it's +//. 3621935_3622235
at some intermediate point there is a price quote that says that someone has offered effectively someone's offered to pay this ⌈ buy it for this much ⌉ . 3622235_3628955

when you bid for your output it you're you're assuming that you want to at least cover the cost of your inputs . 3691775_3697375
right so but if the if it so happened that the bid price was much more than that than the cost of your inputs then a reasonable strategy would just be to bid that . 3698255_3708595
&~n well no you could say a reasonable strategy is to stop bidding on your inputs maybe ⌈ but you don't you won't ⌉ . 3710375_3717235

⌈ mm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ right ⌋ ? 3751805_3751845
but I and I think it's also true that it turns out that these bidding policies make it so that you're almost always in the &~c situation where you're placing your bid where you're above you have to +//. 3752275_3766475
because your inputs have increased your new bid hasta be greater than what someone's willing to buy so you just do ⌈ <as minimally> above ⌉ . 3766995_3772235
⌊ no not &~necessar ⌋ not necessarily . 3772235_3773635

it may or may not be higher than that . 3779995_3781415
alright you're winning all you &~kn you know that you're winning this at some price if you bid above that current &~pr the current bid price that's because your costs your current costs are are too high . 3782415_3793395
<if you bid> &~bel if you bid below it then your costs are less than that and you're still gonna stay in the game . 3794615_3799475
so look at it this way suppose that &-uh Dave and I are sellers and you're a buyer . 3800435_3804955
we know that there you you've offered to buy at ten . 3805295_3807315
and it costs me three . 3808425_3810165
right +/.
+, so I say I know I'm gonna offer to sell at nine let's try to get more than <almost in> surplus . 3811465_3815865

+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I'm ⌋ I'm screwed +... 3822585_3823365
so that's one reason why I shouldn't have gone right to nine I should have stayed at three and raise it to nine later maybe . 3824085_3834445
but if you were the only ⌈ supplier ⌉ . 3834565_3835685
⌊ well ⌋ but I have no way of knowing that . 3836615_3837955

but if you're somewhere in the middle of the chain you bid up too high on on multiple ends then . 3849835_3855455
well yeah so I'm I think that there's there's some way <to help> &~explai to help raise the intuition about why you might not wanna raise your bid . 3855775_3866355

for sellers to raise their bids (be)cause that decreases their chances . 3945195_3947695

so &~i it's it's it's suboptimal by by some bounded amount which &~w you know in proportion to these parameters . 4048595_4055215
&-um and it turns out that this ⌈ this ⌉ . 4056135_4057695
⌊ what ⌋ are the bid parameters ?
&-uh I don't +/. 4058455_4059975
⌈ just the increment ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ the the &~increm ⌋ basically <the increment> the increment and the loss &~a and the input the increment on your output and your input for the producers . 4060675_4067235
and also consumers . 4067795_4069955
&-um and it turns out that this this bidding policy and the auction mechanism if that results in no dead ends on the producer and a dead end <is a> is a producer that buys some inputs but not its output . 4071215_4082555
so if we have no no no producers like that then we have this lambda delta competitive equilibrium and it is an if_and_only_if@q statement . 4083155_4091195
now even when we generalize this &~n notion of equilibria we're not guaranteed to reach that equilibria even when one exists &-um for two general reasons &-um one is we may overshoot the equilibrium prices &-um some of these you know this +//. 4092015_4107375
the price of this good goes higher than the minimum equilibrium price &-um this agent is bidding &~hi actually higher than eleven here because of of the that increment on its inputs . 4107735_4119215
so we can overshoot it and also as I mentioned we have we can have dead ends where this is what happens when you actually run the system where &~y you'd have a producer like this that that buys an input but doesn't sell its output so that's how we can miss the equilibrium . 4120105_4134145
so since since the equilibria &-um some &~i is since we we can't always get an equilibria I defined a somewhat weaker notion on prices called the valid solution where basically all the agents in the solution have a nonnegative surplus except for some producers may may I do allow that some producers may buy some inputs but not sell their output . 4135785_4158025
word you have the word surplus twice <and not just once> . 4158925_4160845
yep thanks . 4160945_4162125
so when we define this we can talk about some properties <of this> of this bidding policy and auction mechanism . 4163825_4170945
&-um because of the ascending auction rule the bidding does always stop we always reach quiescence . 4172085_4176465
&-um if we reach a valid solution and the price of the goods for any losing consumer is higher than their value then we've then we'll reach quiescence with a valid solution . 4177205_4189725
on the other hand if we reach quiescence in at least some consumer +//. 4190955_4194755
at least one consumer's winning we have a valid solution . 4195035_4197275
&-um empirically I've also &-um based on &-uh many thousands of experiments I I I find that if at least some consumer in the system values its &-uh good high enough that's relative to the other values in the ⌈ system ⌉ . 4199075_4211735
⌊ so let's ⌋ say thousands of experiments it's really thousands of randomly generated examples +/. 4211935_4215955

+, randomly generated instances I find find that &~i if the consumer values a good highly enough then the then a valid solution will form for that consumer +... 4220645_4227925
&-um now I'm I talked about this problem of these dead end producers that buy their inputs but not their outputs . 4228705_4236225
we can improve the efficiency of the system by allowing decommitment on those producers . 4237005_4242305
and what that &-um basically means is any producer that that buys some inputs but not its output can decommit from those input contracts and then we recursively go back to the suppliers and basically cut off that portion of the supply chain . 4242675_4256395
and as an example what we do in this what we do here is we basically let this producer and this supplier decommit from their contracts . 4257395_4265035
and that would increase the efficiency &-um actually increase the value of solution by one dollar in this case . 4265715_4271935
and and in this case we would have the optimal solution . 4273635_4276735
with the decommitment . 4278175_4279255
and an equilibrium . 4279835_4280275
&-um no it would not +//. 4281195_4282115

&-um <I've done> &-um I've done some more empirical analysis based on &-um over three thousand randomly generated trials with a range of goods and and and agents &-uh I measured the fraction of optimal surplus and I &~compare I compared the economy run with an a@l star &~so &-um search and the this protocol with with the bidding policies in in the auctions I specified give a mean of efficiency of eighty three percent . 4295275_4323415
but when we include the decommitment the efficiency rises to ninety seven percent . 4324355_4328415
&-uh I found that ⌈ &~ninety about &-uh ⌉ . 4329895_4331355
⌊ yeah you really need ⌋ to qualify those numbers to point out ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 4331435_4336215
⌊ <I was> I was ⌋ gonna do that at the end or or I I . 4336475_4339075
I think right when you mention those numbers you've got to the &~o the the next ones are &~l are much less arbitrary so I think it's worth pointing making a point with respect to these ⌈ numbers ⌉ . 4339275_4347015
⌊ mkay ⌋ so one thing you do have to +//. 4347235_4348215
we hafta be a little bit wary of is remember that &-um you know I &~ha I have this conjecture that if you if some consumer &~i &~ha &~s values its goods sufficiently highly will reach a solution . 4348725_4359465
well <we could> we could set some consumer's value to an arbitrarily high number and know that we're gonna reach a &~n &-uh a a solution . 4359785_4367225
and there we could get arbitrarily high values &~i because &~i you know we &~ar get arbitrarily close to optimum efficiency if if the if that consumer's value dominates all other values in the system . 4367725_4379345
&-um .
okay could you explain that ⌈ so <if the> if the ⌉ +/. 4381325_4382825
⌊ <and you did it> ⌋ ?

+, ⌊ you ⌋ know that's there's not &~go you're not gonna be able to measure much difference in that fraction whereas nine versus ten is a you know could be significant actually it's not nine but a billion minus ten versus a billion minus one &-uh they're pretty much the same whereas +/. 4393455_4409335
+, right +/.
+, the cost ratio is still much more . 4410795_4411895
yeah so so we have to +//. 4412395_4413515
yeah I tried to design this experiment so that that isn't a &~s a strong artifact but we you know we have to keep that in mind . 4414215_4420435
&-um I I did find that thirty seven percent of the trials converged to the approximate equilibrium I talked about . 4421255_4428215
and of those that did not converge to an equilibrium the remaining seventy three &~perce the the remaining ones had seventy three percent efficiency and when we include the decommitment we had a ninety five percent efficiency . 4428895_4439955
so what this suggests is that this protocol is you know it sometimes reaches equilibrium but it &~st it produces good results on average even when it doesn't &~e reach equilibrium . 4440415_4451735
so do you have any sense of &-uh what fraction can actually have an approximate equilibrium ? 4451895_4456455
&-um I do not have that I I haven't tried to measure that that that would ⌈ that's ⌉ . 4458195_4463275
⌊ pretty ⌋ hard I know .
yeah .
so I I don't have that sense . 4464895_4466135
somewhere between thirty seven and a hundred percent &=laughs:multiple . 4467895_4469815
right well we &~ce yeah . 4470055_4471835
now we certainly know that well you know a &~li you know a little more &~wo &~th &-um I guess <I don't have> I don't have the actual statistics here &-um of of how many were improved by the decommitment but &~the there there was a a good chunk of them were improved by decommitment and so we we at least anything that's improved by decommitment could have maybe had an equilibrium but we know we definitely missed it . 4472365_4495905
well actually I <I wanna> I <I don't> I'm not gonna go there so so I don't know how many actually have an equilibrium . 4496995_4503935
so yeah that thirty seven percent could +//. 4505675_4507255
you know includes both the protocol and you know areas in the protocol and also just nonexistence of equilibrium in yeah . 4507595_4518515
the sixty three percent . 4518555_4519235
yeah yes . 4520055_4520735
&-uh those are the means do you have &-uh what's the distribution like is it like almost all ⌈ a hundred percents and then a bunch of really bad ones ⌉ ? 4522295_4528515
⌊ it's &~i it's heavily weighted ⌋ <in in> in in in the ninety percent and above region very heavily weighted . 4528515_4534475
&-um basically over ninety percent are of of the trials had ninety percent or greater efficiency . 4535155_4543415
the &-um part of the reason why why these numbers are as low as they are is because there there's a good chunk of of of results &~o of runs that had negative value . 4544235_4555955
because so &~mo there are more there so basically the cost overwhelmed the value to the consumers . 4556715_4561495
and <&~tha and> &~tha and that's why the decommitment was so useful because it got rid of a_lot_of wasted &~resource you know decommitted from a_lot_of wasted resources . 4563075_4572295
do you have any feel for how the <number of> number of trials that converged to equilibrium varies as the size of the economy grows ? 4573095_4580275
⌈ is ⌉ .
⌊ no ⌋ I don't . 4581095_4581695
okay . 4582075_4582175
I I it's really hard to measure the size of the economy you know I mean you can talk about the number of goods the number of consumers number of agents then the interconnectedness some +//. 4583975_4592595
you know I showed you a very simple you know small economy with no equilibria &-um &~i it's I I &~w I &~thi I I I didn't do that measure because I think <it would> it would be misleading . 4592855_4603975
a simple simple &~m such a simple measure . 4605175_4606775
but wait I I would expect you know now reading the committee Professor Dimmitt to to push you a bit on the empirical trial part of things . 4607115_4615075
&~s push me in terms of +..? 4615295_4616995
why did you do this instead of that you know what could you have measured what will you be measuring +/. 4618355_4622895
okay +/. 4625275_4625535
+, xxx so +/.
+, okay +/. 4625535_4626355
+, xxx .
okay so I've talked about &-um <you know> &~w you know the results of this protocol . 4626395_4635055
one there's one thing I've sidestepped is how &~d how do we know when when this when we've reached quiescence ? 4635105_4640165
that's a straightforward thing to do if we're simulating this on a centralized system where we know what the state of all the agents in the auctions . 4640845_4646925
it's a much more difficult problem when we have decentralized auctions and agents running on you know separate processes in a on an asynchronous system . 4647545_4655385
&-um the &~tr the problem is that local quiescence at one auction does not imply global quiescence . 4656395_4663575
so agents may have stopped bidding at one auction but there may be still activity going on in other parts in the economy and if there's still activity elsewhere prices could propagate back to that auction and there would be later activity . 4664215_4674715
so so actually it's not even clear what local quiescence means . 4675415_4678115
mm so I &~gue so local quiescence meaning <if a> if a a particular auction hasn't received bids for <you know> you know five seconds or whatever time period . 4678955_4687475
well it doesn't mean that <when they say quiescence> it means I mean actually literally it means that no one wants to bid at the current price +/. 4688335_4694455
right +/. 4694655_4694835
+, at the current state no one even wants to . 4694975_4696415
+, right +/. 4696495_4696735
+, but they may but the point you made is that they may want to later +/. 4697415_4700035
+, right +/. 4700315_4700675
+, based on a change in another . 4700735_4702095
+, correct +/. 4702455_4702615
+, see what +//.
maybe something like &-um you know current +//. 4703305_4710365
quiescence at a certain time which you'll define you know later does not mean that it's gonna stay quiescent that there's other auctions that are still active . 4711005_4719205
well you could say inactivity at one auction ⌈ instead of quiescence ⌉ . 4719505_4722585
⌊ inactivity at one ⌋ . 4722665_4723525
⌈ yeah ⌉ .
yeah I like that . 4723905_4724745
what about local stability ? 4725585_4726725
I think inactivity ⌊ is ⌋ . 4729125_4731385
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
so you know we could have timeouts and say you know &~a the auction could ask all its bidders you know do you want you &~kn there are a_lot_of ways you could you know check for inactivity but the point is that's not a good measure of global quiescence . 4731845_4746265
&-uh the trick is we want to have all the auctions reach &~con <where they basically> reach consensus on quiescence in a and do it in a decentralized manner we don't want to have some centralized agent orchestrating all this we want to have the &~mes the messages following the natural flow in the task dependency network . 4746945_4762925
I was gonna to give a high level view of how we can do this . 4763785_4765785
&-um one thing I do is when we have multiple consumers I kind of there is some sort_of metaconsumer that that I introduce that that is used to coordinate the consumer's activity so so we do hafta have some control over we hafta have some knowledge about what's going on with the consumers . 4767315_4784535
but we don't hafta look at the rest of the economy . 4784735_4786515
&-um basically there +//. 4787295_4788055
when when the &~con ⌊ when ⌋ we have consumers not &~me wanting to change their bids they &~s pass &~messa &-uh a message called that &~s says I'm quiescent . 4788595_4798175
and &-uh and and if if the rest of the network is really quiescent also it will propagate back to the suppliers . 4798715_4805315
&-um but if at any point new bids come about &-um the that message will not be propagated back and the auctions will wake up and continue their bidding . 4806775_4815215
oh I mean the auctions will continue the price quotes and the agents will continue their bidding . 4816205_4818925
&-um one step those messages reach the suppliers <if the> if the suppliers are really you know are &~ar agree that they are quiescent they don't have anything they want to change they will say &~o they'll send a &~f a message firm which &~sa basically says I am firm you know I'm certain that that I'm quiescent key locally . 4819745_4836325
and agents and auctions will propagate that message back to the consumers if they agree with that message if if there haven't been any price changes or new bids . 4836905_4845125
and <once this> once this information propagates to <the metaconsumer> the metaconsumer will send a signal saying a clear signal basically which will propagate to the network and all the auctions will close down and clear . 4845745_4858385
you could +//. 4860165_4860785
does that consumer bid or anything &~ma the metaconsumer ? 4861185_4863445
all it does all it serves is to pass these ⌈ messages ⌉ . 4863825_4866305
⌊ maybe ⌋ you could just call it a quiescence detector or something like that . 4866525_4871045
using the word ⌈ consumer ⌉ . 4871045_4871925
⌊ yeah ⌋ metaconsumer ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 4871945_4872925
⌊ yeah ⌋ (0.6) now &~the there are some &~restric &~oop a few restrictions on on on how this operates I assume that messages always get delivered in some finite period of time in order between two agents however I don't place there's I don't place any arbitrary time bound on them on the messages . 4872925_4896785
also I assume that the auctions know who their bidders are . 4897485_4899705
so that they they know &~whe if they've received messages from every agent . 4900295_4904115
how do you know if you've got all the firms ? 4904615_4906095
how do you know ? 4907295_4907695
basically &~y &~y an auction will pass a message only if &~on if it receives a firm from all of its bidders . 4907895_4914415
that's why you have to know who your bidders are . 4915355_4916975
and the same with the quiescent basically the messages an auction passes on a message only if it receives it . 4918015_4922775
it passes a quiescence only if it receives it from all its buyers it'll pass on a firm only if it receives it from all its sellers . 4922755_4928555
and turns out &-uh given these assumptions with this protocol &-um auctions will clear if and only if we have global quiescence . 4929395_4938515
there's a certain incentive for the agents who are you know buying something but they're not able to sell it that may not want to send off a firm message you know . 4940255_4950895
so &~the so there's another issue do agents &~wa want to actually participate in this protocol . 4950715_4956615
right +/.
+, and that's something that I need to look at in in combination with the incentives for the bidding policy . 4957355_4963995
&-um we can &~prob &-uh what I'd like to do is perhaps we can combine this quiescence detection protocol with with the decommitment protocol and if we can somehow combine the signals so agents can signal you know okay I'm detecting quiescence but you gotta let me decommit because I'm not ready here . 4965555_4981835
&-um briefly touch on some &~oth some related work &-um a_lot_of work has been done in a for task allocation and task oriented domains here there aren't these &-um <they don't> they don't have these test dependence networks they they have kind of they have ⌈ tasks ⌉ . 4983635_4999475

⌊ &~y yes that ⌋ Rosenschein's Law can have defined and others such as Sandholm have also pursued work in that general area domain and the idea is that to reallocate tasks among agents &-um basically any reallocation of tasks is feasible but &~bec but &~the there are different costs depending on what combination of tasks that agents have . 5003105_5023225
&-um Anderson and Sandholm have looked at contract decommitment and in in a task oriented type domain and they found also that decommitment can greatly improve the efficiency . 5024265_5035425
&-um Davis and Smith &-um &~in invented a protocol called Contract Net which actually does look at these hierarchical dependencies in the supply chain formation . 5036665_5046005
&-um it doesn't &-um &~i basically &~ta &~does it takes a different approach it does a top+down allocation starting from the consumer &-um which means that if there are &-um resource limitations in the system it there would hafta be some sort of backtracking to account for that and &-um &~u usually you don't really &~u to my knowledge that +//. 5046785_5066865

xxx adductivity properties in advance to that &=laughs:multiple . 5205165_5206565
and over the long term I'd also really like to develop a model of &~an &~an model and analyze the strategic incentives for these various portions of the protocol . 5207645_5215665
and &-um two years from now I'd like to complete the thesis . 5216425_5218725
and my contributions are I've &-um by the time I'm done I will have a decentralized solution method that combines a task allocation and scheduling &-um and what's really new about this is it includes both the supply chain dependencies and strictly limited resources . 5219905_5234125
also this &~quite quiescence detection protocol is is to my knowledge is &~f quite novel in the field of computational economics and it's very important for the &~imp for to implement these computational market systems and decentralize . 5235185_5247505
so I mean I don't disagree with that but I think those two bullets are just really not equal +/. 5248985_5253365
okay +/.
+, the first one is much more significant than the second +/. 5254365_5256665
+, okay +/. 5256925_5257205
+, but what what I might suggest is just getting rid of the subbullets under the second and &~mayb maybe add another +... 5257265_5263525
<set of> &~quo set of you know of things at that level so the main thing is you've got this decentralized ⌈ solution method ⌉ +/. 5265065_5271705
+, ⌊ right right ⌋ +/.
+, right ?
+, mhm +/.
+, and it's sort_of on the side you've got quiescence detection efficiency analysis &-um you know activity properties &~a all those things that go with it +/. 5272245_5282785
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ they're all ⌋ sort_of there's equal things about that but they're sort_of enhance the the main show which is the the method itself . 5283005_5289985
mhm so so what you're saying is so add more bullets under this at this level ? 5290485_5295705
or I'm I'm a little bit xxx . 5296285_5297985
yeah &~actu actually . 5298705_5299085
at the same level as quiescence +..? 5300365_5301905
yeah or maybe group them under something else like &-um &-uh analysis and &-um implementation . 5304325_5315525
(0.5) so ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ so this under ⌋ analysis and implementation ? 5316545_5322385
right . 5322625_5322885
(be)cause quiescence I mean by by implementation I don't mean actually writing code but I mean how to realize the protocol +/. 5323465_5328185
quiescence detection decommitment you know all the other issues that you've raised +/. 5329045_5333665
+, &-um <I wouldn't> I wouldn't raise quiescence detection &~a &~a &~a above those other ones and I and they really are all about the first thing . 5334645_5343085
do you have any plans to say anything about the computational cost of <the method> ? 5343965_5350305
&-um so the computational costs &-um I I wasn't planning on it I can say that the bidding policies in the auctions require nominal computation locally &~be the real time loss here is in &~tr is communication . 5351425_5365465
there there could be a_lot_of messages sent depending on +/. 5366425_5369665
⌈ and ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ depending ⌋ on a_lot_of factors &-um I do have a bound on the number on the number of bids in the system and we would expect that &-um so the &~re so the number of bids &~spec really determines the &~com the communication cost and and so . 5370435_5386635
that's a good question to be prepared for . 5387455_5393335
and also the number and taking some &-um problem statement and converting it to your model could be that the number of nodes explodes exponentially . 5389305_5399465
that's a little &-um +/. 5401245_5403745
I realize that it may not in other formulations +/. 5403745_5405445
+, if if we had agents that were potentially interested in any combination of goods yes &-um we would have an exponential explosion . 5405825_5415045
actually yeah right what is the looking at the centralized solution what is complexity of this problem . 5417245_5422065
well &~the yeah this is I I haven't proven this but I strongly believe it's this the problem is MP complete to do centrally because it very closely resembles a &~an minimum and_or it could be in a minimum and_or graph certainly ⌈ took ⌉ . 5422585_5436125
⌊ and is ⌋ that is that known to be MP complete ? 5436345_5437505
yes computing a minimum weight and_or graph is MP complete . 5437685_5441345
this is a little bit ⌈ different ⌉ . 5441945_5442945
⌊ it's ⌋ restricted so you could check that might be worth knowing . 5442955_5445855
&-um yeah I haven't put the effort into doing the the translation &-um certainly when I try and compute efficiency using you know the a@l star takes a long time &=laughs:multiple . 5446855_5457375
right but if +/. 5458255_5459635
yeah so +/.
+, I mean but yours could be doubly +... 5460975_5462355
I doubt that . 5464035_5465615
well it shouldn't be better but ⌈ but ⌉ +/. 5466315_5468015
+, it's not obvious it should be you know worse by any particular you know . 5468005_5473845
it looks a_lot like a minimum weight and_or graph problem +... 5474425_5477985
&-um I to &~re to return to the the analogy with or the connection with the minimum weight &~an and_or problem I mean that's a computationally burdensome problem which &-uh one might want to parallelize . 5480825_5495505
if you have multiple processors you might wanna exploit them . 5493705_5496485
and what you're presenting is a method for parallelizing as_well_as decentralizing the solution of a related problem is that interesting from a I can imagine people ⌈ in parallel computing <thinking that was really> interesting ⌉ . 5496645_5507245
⌊ I &~w I would I I would ⌋ be hesitant to argue that this is the &~b that if you have all the information centrally I wouldn't be hesitant to argue that this is the best way to go about it . 5507425_5516685
even the best way to parallelize it ? 5517905_5519265
well you have it all centrally and then you break it up and parallelize it . 5520355_5524375
okay .
yeah generally when you parallelize an algorithm the best not the best thing to do is like have one processor in each node and only look at your closest neighbor that's not the best way . 5525635_5537055
right .
&-um since we've gone over &-um quite a_lot &-uh probably should end it but thanks for all for your patience and I think we've raised a bunch of things that will come up again in time and of_course the committee's gonna raise just all sorts of other considerably comfortable things that you can anticipate . 5540475_5558015
but I think you've got a_lot to &~sh to defend yourself I don't &-uh anticipate any difficulties . 5558375_5565435
so I know we started late I &~f can't remember when we started am I &~o roughly okay on time here ? 5565915_5570395
&~y yes . 5570595_5571775
okay .
but I think you'll need to monitor that dynamically . 5572435_5575195
because there's gonna be a &~l you know &~res shock events you know +/. 5575795_5579855
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ digressions ⌋ and you may need to &~f think ahead of time about where you might recover time if if you fall behind . 5580175_5586655
you can skip stuff that you couldn't skip with us because they'll have read the paper so . 5587275_5592915
&-uh that's that's a risky assumption &=laughs:multiple . 5594395_5596335
well I mean if you wanna if you need to make up time you might be able to ⌈ say ⌉ . 5597095_5601155
⌊ so so ⌋ alright they they are supposed to have read the paper +/. 5601275_5603415

anybody want to set one ? 5629115_5630935

you want us to &~m can you meet sometime today ? 5649395_5650735
yeah . 5651755_5655315
why don't we say +... 5656515_5657175

so so you said you'll be around ? 5668855_5670075
will you have any time ? 5670275_5671335
&-um I got a proposal to get out this afternoon +/. 5672475_5674975
