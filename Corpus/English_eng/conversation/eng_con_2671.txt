I think it was one monday monday morning .
after Lisa and Clark got off of school their mother said that they
and Lisa and Clark said Mcdonalds .
I think it was together or something like that .
then they both hoped into the car .
and they went to Mcdonalds .
and <um when they> they went into the restaurant .
and Lisa didn't know what to buy .
but Lisa's mom and Clark knew .
so <she is a> when she gotta the counter she knew .
she ordered a happy meal .
and the mother ordered a salad .
and Clark ordered a Big_Mac with a milkshake .
and then the owner said it would be <two &~fif six> two fifty
and &-um the mother just realized that she didn't have her purse
she left it on the kitchen counter .
one thursday morning a little boy named (5.) Jan got up and made
but <&~sh> he poured too much <water I mean> milk .
and then he was mad .
he changed out_of his pajamas .
and put on his &-um shirts .
and it was almost time for school .
<&~sho> so he got on his shoes .
and he was trying to tie his shoes .
but a <&~s uh> shoelace snapped .

one friday morning everyone was having a picnic in the park .

but they can hold the leash .
and then they were going to stay for ten days .
and then the next day they came back .
and then <they &~chan> the aliens changed their mind .
then they went back home .
the end
