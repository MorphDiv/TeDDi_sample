&-um well thank you for being present for our presentation and &-um &-um our project is about is a combination of crosssectional studies and pragmatics and well through this class we all know that there are excuse_me there are many kinds of speech acts such as &-uh requests complaints &~di disagreements apologies corrections and refusals . 201775_231755
and what we're gonna do today is about refusals . 232655_235455
and &-uh just to let you know what &~kin what kind of studies there have been &-um (un)til now &-um I think there hasn't been a_lot_of studies on refusals which is I don't know why . 236295_253535
but maybe it's because it's such a complex area . 253795_256055
but anyway I found two studies that are quite related to what we're going to do today . 256775_263255
and one of them is by Beebe Takahashi and Uliss_Weltz . 263635_269815
and it was done in nineteen ninety . 270355_271935
and &-uh they compared Japanese and American refusal strategies in_order_to present evidence of pragmatic transfer in Japanese ESL learners' refusals . 273135_283895
and the result was that they had evidence of transfer in both Japanese and American xxx okay sorry about that okay they found evidence of transfer and &-um what they found was that both Japanese and Americans favored the strategy of using an &~ex an excuse and showed a tendency to begin the refusal with refusal adjuncts such as positive opinion . 284655_314075
and &-uh the second one is the second study is by Tree I think he's Chinese and &-um he did a study on English refusal strategies in business situations and it was based on mainland Chinese and Taiwanese ESL learners and native speakers of American English . 315095_339895
and &~s the results were similar to the former study by &-um Beebe Takahashi and Uliss_Weltz and excuse was the most frequently employed strategy by all three groups and &-um all three groups preferred specific excuses but both Chinese groups were more familiar +//. 340775_361275
family oriented oriented when making excuses so &-um that's &-uh studies that been done on refusals . 361865_391845
for the hypothesis we took as a starting point the Beebe study which was actually mentioned in our book and &-uh it's on page one &~f one eighty five but I'll just read what his bottom line was . 377745_391205
he was studying &-um as she said semantic formulas for examples excuses expressions of regret apologies we've redefined those terms a little bit and in a few minutes we'll show you what terms we came up with . 391765_404905
his conclusion though was that the range of formulas that are available is the same for all speakers the difference is that the order of the formulas is different between nonnative speakers and native speakers . 405705_420185
so we we didn't really we weren't very convinced about that so we decided to test a different hypothesis . 421165_428005
which is that in our our situation which was refusing an invitation &-um the range of formulas that are actually available to nonnative speakers is much more limited than the range of formulas available to native speakers . 429605_442605
with a consequence that nonnative speakers will frequently respond inappropriately in status governed interactions . 443285_451305
when we discuss the test you'll see that we were controlling for status in the two tests that we used +... 452585_459425
&-um I'm gonna tell you a little bit about the population that we studied . 460865_467325
&-um we had ten native speakers which they were all undergraduate students here at the University of Michigan and then we had seven nonnative speakers two of which were Korean two of which were Spanish Spanish and three of which were Chinese . 468095_482795
and &-um among them they had all been in the US between three months and a year approximately . 483775_489455
and it was a mixture of graduate and undergraduate students and they were all &-um between the ages of twenty and thirty and we also had a mixture of males and females . 490175_500075

okay (0.13) .
&-um well this is (0.7) . 614785_615505
&-uh put out the other light let's just . 619885_624585
okay what we did was &-um send out emails (0.8) . 625605_630585
okay what we did was &-um we sent out emails to the native American English speakers and the nonnative speakers &-um (be)cause we thought that it would make a more natural setting and they won't be pressured to &-um &{l=SIC response &}l=SIC in the way they should &{l=SIC response &}l=SIC . 639505_657225
and we thought it'd be better than tape recording them . 657605_659945
and &-um this is what we sent out &-um +... 661285_669305
we had two scenarios and one was +... 666965_669805
one &~w one goes &-um &{l=READING your &~pro your professor makes a point of &~per periodically inviting four or five students out to lunch in_order_to get to know her students better . 672805_684665
you receive an email asking &~y asking you to attend a lunch next week but you really don't want to go how would you respond to this email ? 685285_693825
&}l=READING and the second one is &-um &{l=READING a classmate of yours sends you an email inviting you out for lunch next week but you don't want to go how would you respond to this email ? 694405_704785
&}l=READING so we sent this out and we got the responses +... 705285_709285
&-um and what we did is &-um we didn't send &~th both two scenarios to all of them we +... 710685_719265
what we did was oh good we sent both of the scenarios to the native speakers but to the nonnative speakers we divided into three groups and to two of them we sent only the one that concerns the professor and to two of them we sent the one that concerns the classmate and the other one &~th the rest of them we sent both of the scenarios . 721355_746655
and &-um that was because &-um Professor Johnson said that if we sent two of them to all of them they would be aware about the status differences and they would kind_of &{l=SIC response &}l=SIC in the way they should &{l=SIC response &}l=SIC . 747345_762365
so we did that but well later you'll know but it didn't really work out that way . 763445_769165
but anyway we did it and &-um let's see +... 769805_773425
and +... 775845_776145
&-um after we got the response we &-uh tried to make a chart out_of we tried to categorize the responses and &-um we made six categories and +... 778365_793365
and +... 797365_805705
we tried to &-um define the terms +... 804645_807865
by ourselves and (0.19) &-um +... 810465_821685
well first you see there are six <not yet> six categories . 837335_843455
and the first one is acceptance . 844315_845575
and we &~s defined it as accepting the offer even though you don't want to and justification which is citing a specific obligation that precludes accepting the precludes accepting the invitation an excuse giving a vague reason or reasons for not accepting . 846125_867545
for example sorry I'm busy and concession which is saying it's not possible for you to accept the invitation without offering an explanation or reason or expressing an interest in meeting at some future time . 867925_884625
for example I can't make it or I can't make it but why don't we meet some other time . 885105_889945
and the next one is avoidance &-um not responding to the invitation or delaying response and the last one is refusal direct rejection of the invitation citing lack of interest for example I don't wanna go . 890595_904775
so &-um it's kind_of confusing I guess (be)cause it was confusing for us so we'll &-um +... 905795_915875
well that one comes out I mean maybe if we . 921305_923085
mhm +...
well I'll just move it as I read it +... 923945_928105
so &-um here are the actual email responses we got and we picked out some of the good examples that represented each of the categories and for acceptance &-um this person says I would definitely go if even if I didn't want to various reasons &-uh blah blah blah &{l=READING one good suck up opportunity two free meal three good opportunity to figure out the professor . 928585_958445
in conclusion I feel that anyone that would not go would hafta be extremely unattentive to the opportunities that this meal would present . 959555_967055
&}l=READING so <this is> this is the best &~exp &-um this was a good example of acceptance . 967855_975055
and the second one is justification . 975815_977755
&-um &=READING I received your message about lunch next week . 979195_982635
I would really like to go and meet with you and the other classmates . 982835_986175
but my class schedule just does not allow me to be able to make it . 986315_990995
I have class that Tuesday from eleven to one . 991095_993295
however I really appreciate the invitation . 993695_995595
and hopefully I could make a get together at another future date &=READING . 996495_1000495
so ⌈ this is ⌉ . 1001235_1001855
⌊ are these ⌋ native speaker proposals or nonnative speaker responses ? 1002195_1004515
there's a mix . 1004835_1005695
so all you're doing here is picking out ⌈ the best ⌉ . 1006395_1009855
⌊ yeah just ⌋ an example example to . 1009855_1012035
the most clear+cut yeah . 1012335_1016135
to ⌈ clarify the terms ⌉ . 1013665_1013785
⌊ to clarify ⌋ that you have an idea . 1013785_1015305
&-um so this person has a specific reason to justify his unattendance and &-uh for excuse . 1015825_1026925
&-um &{l=READING dear Jane thanks so much for the invite . 1027525_1031365
lunch would sound great but I am super busy that week and I have two exams and a paper and I need to go to the accounting office hours and get extra help . 1031605_1040625
I am getting a C . 1040845_1041785
so needless to say things will be pretty hectic . 1042585_1044945
thanks for asking though . 1045245_1046225
have a nice weekend &}l=READING . 1046405_1047165
so this person just babbles about like what what she hasta do this that week or whatever but it's not really specific as to why in before like the justification . 1047885_1059725
she said I I have class at Tuesday from eleven to one but this person is just generally just narrating excuses . 1060125_1069425
&-um next one is concession &-um this one's by a &~non nonnative speaker . 1070425_1078245
&{l=READING &-uh hi how's your plan going on I wish you good luck with your companion but I just want to let you know that I will be unable to participate your picnic . 1079345_1088185
I feel sorry and I hope you have a great time xxx see next next &-um class on Monday bye &}l=READING so this one &-um he lets us know that he can't attend but he doesn't have a specific excuse or justification . 1088925_1107405
and the last one is avoidance and this person says I say I probably wouldn't respond . 1109865_1115105
so that's the point he wouldn't respond that's what the point is +... 1116865_1122465
can I just clarify something ?
sure go ahead .
sure .
&-um I just wanted to clarify that &~s sorry when we began we didn't anticipate all of these categories we didn't anticipate acceptance &-uh the email was worded it didn't say that they hadta refuse it just said you don't want to go . 1130185_1145765
so we did have some people accept for varying reasons &-uh we didn't anticipate avoidance which later surprised us because it's a pretty common tactic this &~ch I never got your email sort_of thing and we had expected to see some straight refusals from nonnative speakers thinking that limited &~l language or pragmatic knowledge might lead them to be more blunt . 1146425_1168805
but we didn't have that result so there were two things we got that we didn't expect and one thing we expected that we didn't . 1169665_1178905
okay now we're gonna talk about the results a little bit of what we ended up seeing +... 1178905_1184465
(0.6) back to the overhead +... 1190045_1191125
this one's larger +... 1198675_1199895
let's see if this takes +... 1202075_1204755
half of it's clear and half of it's not . 1210735_1216355
so <was it> was it clearer up there ? 1216775_1219495
can we ⌈ make it smaller for this one ⌉ ?
⌊ toward the bottom it seems to get ⌋ clearer doesn't it ?
make it smaller but +... 1222095_1223515
<it's gonna need to be higher> (0.4) don't know why it's so blurry on this &~s . 1231925_1233145
I think it's the overhead .
why ? 1233705_1235105
I think that we had this problem earlier in the term I think it's ⌈ the overhead ⌉ .
⌊ with this one ⌋ yeah I will bring for the others +/. 1235585_1240505
great +/.
+, I'll bring the overhead from &-uh maybe you can almost see it . 1240645_1246045
okay . 1246285_1246825
yeah +//. 1247785_1248125
oh well they're locked but I'll bring the linguistics one okay ? 1248525_1253725
let's see how do I do this ?
(0.4) this got rubbed off anything else xxx . 1267775_1268095
okay this is just the chart of what we ended up getting as far as our results . 1268675_1274535
&-um one thing that we had expected to get in the first place that we ended up getting which was kind_of nice is that &-um for the native speakers which is this side &-um we expected that &-um for the professor that most people would give a justification . 1275275_1294935
because &-um pragmatically when you respond to a professor you wouldn't tell them I'm busy I can't make it or I have so much homework to do . 1294985_1302985
you hafta have a specific reason I'm busy at this time so I can't be there . 1303405_1307065
so we expected that to happen and then with the classmate we expected more excuses that &-um possibly you might justify your reasons but a_lot_of the times you you can come up with excuses I'm busy my mom's gonna be in town something silly you know I just can't be there . 1307645_1323585
and so &-um we had a hundred percent for the professor justification or actually acceptance which is what we didn't expect so that's even stronger . 1325065_1334785
they're not even gonna justify the reasons . 1334765_1336345
they're gonna go anyways . 1336505_1337265
so we had very strong results on that . 1337885_1339845
and then for the nonnative speakers &-um <we weren't> we weren't quite sure what we were gonna see with that but we expected it to be a little bit more mixed up and which is exactly what we got . 1340045_1349685
we got a a_lot_of excuses for the the professor which we thought was interesting and definitely &-um excuses for the classmate as well . 1349845_1358665
&-um but the most interesting results is when you look at the actual percentages that people used +... 1359705_1370665
&-um for the native speakers there was &-um sixty nine percent justifications overall and only twenty seven percent for the nonnative speakers and then at the other end the excuses the nonnative speakers had seventy three percent whereas the native speakers only used fifteen percent so on the whole &-um the native speakers definitely justified why they can't be there more often than the nonnative speakers did . 1375545_1405525
and then the I think the most interesting fact is that for the professor we used eighty three percent justifications and if it wasn't a justification they accepted but for the nonnative speakers they only used forty percent . 1407545_1422265
no one accepted no one avoided and the majority just used excuses . 1423505_1427625
which I thought was very interesting . 1428805_1429765
and then as far as &-um what really supported our hypothesis I think was that &-um we expected the native speakers to have a wider range of use of their pragmatic knowledge and have more &-um types of responses available to them than the nonnative speakers . 1430455_1448235
and as you can see the people who did come in with different types of responses were the native speakers . 1448735_1454895
and none of the nonnative speakers thought to even accept it or avoid it . 1455335_1458695
they they basically had you know three types of responses that they could draw from whereas the native speakers have a much wider range . 1459375_1467095
is there anything you'd like to add ? 1468715_1469895
I don't think so . 1472075_1472775
can I ask a +/. 1472855_1473695
⌈ sure ⌉ +/. 1473855_1473995
+, ⌊ quick ⌋ question ?
&-um are the percentages what are +//. 1475035_1478835
can you just explain the percentages +/. 1479095_1481335
+, sure +/.
+, again to me ? 1481375_1482055
yeah one thing I'd like to clarify that actually I didn't even think of is they don't add up to a hundred percent I don't +//. 1482195_1486975
is that what ⌈ confused you ⌉ ? 1487155_1488415
⌊ yeah I was ⌋ just wondering .
&-um a_lot_of the speakers and you can see from this used &-um more than one type +/. 1488875_1495455
oh +/.
+, &-um so like this person is double counted they used a justification and a concession . 1496115_1500115
so out_of &-um these six people they're counted twice so they don't all add up to a hundred percent so what they actually mean is that of all the native speakers who responded to the professor email eighty three percent of (th)em used a justification in their response . 1500895_1519055
and then the same with each +... 1519835_1520855
is that better ? 1522455_1522955

⌊ I'll ⌋ I'll try to be if I could grab one of those pens though <that would be good> +/. 1533885_1536445
oh sure +/.
+, I'll try to be quick (be)cause I realize we're getting near the time . 1536725_1539265
&-um I we just wanted to provide two examples of things that might point out areas for future research for different projects &-uh let's do this . 1539865_1551385
this response from a nonnative speaker to a friend says &{l=READING I'm sorry I cannot make it I think it would be good to have lunch with you however the time is not available for me . 1551755_1561555
&}l=READING we couldn't decide if this phrase was an excuse I'm not available or a justification I'm busy at that time so we thought it was interesting that we had an example where linguistic knowledge overlaps with pragmatic knowledge . 1562595_1579555
<we think that> we think that would be something very interesting to investigate in the future . 1580585_1583785
another interesting thing was this excuse this person responded the same way to a professor and to the classmate by saying &{l=READING I have a diarrhea these days so I have special diet of my own &}l=READING now &-um I don't know &=laughs:multiple you might consider that a +//. 1584465_1602565
most people probably won't ask for anymore information &=laughs but we felt that &~th the content of this justification was pragmatically inappropriate <at least> at least with a professor . 1602715_1617795
and it was a nonnative speaker <we're assuming> ? 1618015_1620355
it was a nonnative speaker . 1620355_1621655
yeah .
oh but the thing is I mean she's Korean . 1622535_1624675
and I don't think even if I I mean even if she was responding to a Korean professor and friend she &~w I wouldn't use a &~re excuse like this . 1625105_1635445
I mean it's really embarrassing to tell anybody that I have diarrhea . 1635565_1638145
and well I was trying to get hold of her and ask why she had such a xxx response . 1639185_1644345
<but I couldn't> &~s but I couldn't contact her so I don't know . 1644705_1649305
it just remains a mystery . 1649545_1650865
it is good though it's great to sorta you know pick up on something like that do you know her is she a joker ? 1652345_1657425
yeah and the thing is she does have diarrhea very often &=laughs:multiple . 1658365_1662345
so she had it planned for next week already +... 1663145_1667765
this poor woman +/. 1669805_1670505
+, we've edited out all the names in the email +... 1671225_1673005
okay so we just thought that &-um those two things we didn't take into consideration that the content is much +//. 1675475_1682195
would be overlapping of pragmatic and linguistic knowledge but we thought that those were possible directions for future research just briefly to relate this to current &-um SLA research &-um especially in the Kaspar and the Bardovi_Harlig and Hartford articles &-um they were saying that most +//. 1682725_1704385
there hasn't been that much done on pragmatics most of it is focused on usage which is what we hadta do given the limited time frame for our experiment . 1704375_1711935
what was interesting though is that &-um they were focusing a_lot . 1713035_1718755
research has been focusing a_lot on politeness markers and status preserving strategies . 1718875_1723635
and we think that our research might show that not only linguistic form but the actual semantic formula itself may be a status preserving strategy . 1724185_1734825
for example the fact that a justification saying that giving a specific time conflict to a professor would be considered a valid excuse whereas a vague excuse or saying I have a hockey game would not be appropriate . 1735105_1750785
so it's not only the politeness markers such as I'm sorry please forgive me it's it's also &-um whether they choose a justification or an excuse . 1751275_1760515
and our research showed that a_lot_of nonnative speakers used excuses in all situations and that is a little similar to the research on &-um the rejections of suggestions made by nonnative speakers in the academic advising session &-um a_lot_of their suggestions were &~t rejected because they didn't use the correct justification or the correct reasoning . 1761395_1785455
for their rejections . 1786155_1786915
so we're seeing overlap there given &-um what is considered by the interlocutor to be an &~acceptab acceptable rationalization . 1787705_1796785
that's in relation to the the status &-um the same explanation isn't valid for both your friend and for your professor . 1797965_1806325
okay . 1808965_1809025
well &-um if we were to do this experiment again had a couple things that we would change . 1809705_1814125
&-um the first thing that we would make different is the &-um the letter format itself . 1814665_1820185
we we had some problems with that &-um we tried to make it clear that we wanted them to respond as if they were responding to a professor and not tell us how they would respond but a_lot_of people did that . 1820905_1832425
if I were to respond to this I would tell them this instead of just saying I can't make it or whatnot . 1832785_1839205
&-um so we thought one thing that we would change is we would make it a specific date and time and say that you don't wanna go or you can't make it we would say dear so and so <blah blah> blah blah blah blah blah this time this day sincerely your friend or your professor instead of saying please respond if you had received it . 1839665_1860405
so that's one thing we woulda changed and then the other thing we would've changed is we would've ended up sending the scenario to both &-um or both scenarios to everyone &-um the reason that we did that as Mir_Soo said in the first place was &-um we were afraid that people would &-um see what we were doing . 1860665_1879365
they would see oh here's a professor . 1879625_1880945
here's a classmate . 1881185_1881905
I'm supposed to do a different response here instead of controlling for that variable . 1882265_1886805
but we ended up &-uh &-uh two people I believe &-um responded that they would say the same thing to the professor and a classmate . 1887185_1895405
they said this is what I would say either way . 1895565_1897205
and no one seemed to catch on to what we were doing so we we might as well send both scenarios to everyone and have more data . 1897685_1904505
sure .
did you get native speakers saying that they would respond the same way ? 1905025_1908165
yeah . 1908265_1908405
was one native and +/. 1909685_1910525
⌈ one ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ one ⌋ nonnative ? 1910525_1911105
one native and one nonnative which is actually yeah very surprising but the person who said that she would say the same thing to both actually &-um she was the one that lied right ? 1911345_1922305
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ oh okay ⌋ .
yeah &-um she she said that she would wait she would say she would go up until the last day and then she would email and say some plans came up &=laughs:multiple yeah and so that would be avoidance that was one of the people who avoided responding or avoided rejecting someone so yeah that that was interesting . 1923875_1945535
anything else ? 1945935_1947715
yeah .
did you find a difference between males and females or did you look at ⌈ that ⌉ ? 1949025_1952065
⌊ no ⌋ we didn't that's one thing that we did &-um we controlled for in the beginning and separated the males and females and we found that there was no difference really very negligible so . 1952065_1960865
did you look at all at &-um the amount of time they had spent in the States and what kind of responses they used ? 1962845_1969245
yeah &-um that was +//. 1969885_1971745
in the population everyone had been here about three months to a year so they were all basically in the beginning of learning pragmatics no one was extremely advanced so that was basically controlled for . 1971825_1983465
do you think that the appropriacy or inappropriacy of responses or <basically just> how they the candidates responded do you think that was due to a lack of pragmatic knowledge or do you think it was more maybe due to a lack of &-uh language knowledge . 1985825_2003085
<like &-uh> they wanted let's say they wanted to make a justification . 2003305_2007265
but they didn't have all the vocab down so they went with &-uh what they could say with vocab they did have . 2007465_2015125
well we talked about that a little bit didn't we and I think we decided that it didn't constrain ⌈ very much ⌉ ? 2015605_2022065
⌊ yeah ⌋ because I I was saying with my Spanish I don't know much Spanish . 2022065_2025825
but I could just as easily say I have plans from eleven to one so I can't be there as I could say I'm really busy this week . 2026485_2035385
they're both simple sentences . 2035555_2037095
it's just a matter of stating this time is busy for me or I'm just busy all week . 2037375_2042695
so yeah we we considered that . 2043275_2045815
okay . 2046255_2046315
how do you think your results would've changed if this was a spoken situation ? 2047395_2050815
spoken situation it's interesting because a_lot_of the research that was done has actually been on speaking . 2051615_2057295
and they focus . 2057875_2058475
&-um that's where the bulge theory comes that there is a_lot more negotiation between people that &-um don't know each_other very well . 2058705_2065665
that's it &-um so if the status is not as unclear it takes several conversational turns before you get anywhere so partially because of the scope of the study we chose to do it as a written thing so we we wouldn't have all that variation +... 2066525_2079065
I mean &-uh do you think would've been more limited in their responses to nonnative speakers if they would've had a spoken situation where they hadta come up with it quicker ? 2081685_2089305
that would be interesting to see my reaction would be yeah I think . 2090085_2107585
that's a very good point although it is still interesting even in that modality that you used you got a real limited &-uh scope of the kind of answer or more limited not real limited but &-um you know you might get more limitation you know in that but it is an interesting question . 2094905_2112785
and even at that issue of sending something someone else in the ELI just did a a task where she wanted the students to write down what they would say it just it's so difficult for all of us not just nonnative speakers but you know to get into that mode and really just do it that way it's it's a very difficult task . 2113265_2132025
that's initially one reason why we chose email because we that it was a naturalistic situation you really might get an invitation you really might respond through writing but I think as as Lindsay mentioned &-uh we we +//. 2132865_2145465
perhaps should directly just given (th)em the letter . 2145685_2147145
okay I think very nice &=applause:multiple . 2148505_2150705
&-uh can we have some more evaluation sheets around ? 2170385_2173165
we seem to be out_of them . 2173425_2175645
a little hard for me to believe that .
I know usually it's <overmade things> &=movement:_UNINTELLIGIBLE_CONVERSATION .
extra evaluation forms . 2176045_2197405
(0.42) everybody get one of these ?
(0.19) .
our names are here you can Portia Leah and Marta and &-um +... 2260945_2266485
&-um the use of closures by native speakers and nonnative speakers and we're trying to say how &~th how are they alike or different . 2268765_2279705
&-um our project design &-um basically we collected data on the pragmatic element of closures the end of conversations and the task was to complete the questionnaire that you have in front of you and we were wondering +//. 2281145_2296205
well we wanted you complete in maybe three minutes try to go through it and see <what would you> what would you answer some of the questions and before you start . 2296485_2305365
from Professor Johnson this side do the third and fourth question first and you guys can do it in the order that it was given . 2306595_2314655
&=pause_while_filling_out_questionnaire .
okay so we have eight native speakers and eight ⌈ non ⌉ . 2449585_2453145
⌊ if you guys ⌋ didn't finish it . 2453145_2454085
yeah &~jus +/. 2454285_2454545
just to give you a taste +/. 2455225_2455405
+, so you have an idea of how we we wanted to go through this so you had an idea what we got and maybe you can compare to what your answers were . 2455405_2463885
&-um eight native speakers and eight nonnative speakers and the nonnative speakers were students in &~th at the ELI from a pronunciation class that the teacher &-um thought they were advanced they've been here less than a year but in the questionnaires most of them marked &-um intermediate . 2464345_2481965
&-um there was two Cantonese Japanese one Thai one German one Russian and one Chinese . 2483085_2490285
so pretty good variety of languages . 2491265_2493785
&-um what we used to design the questionnaire was a &~f I called it a framework and it's one of the &{l=SIC Pardovi &}l=SIC and Harlig Hartford and a_lot_of people +/. 2494705_2507845
+, et_al +/.
+, &-um thing and their focus was more on guidelines and examples for pragmatic lessons on the use of closing in American English so it was more for teaching of pragmatics . 2508785_2518825
but for that they provided a description of closings that have been previously identified by other researchers . 2519305_2525785
and those were the forms that we used for the questionnaires and the forms of questionnaire questionnaire templates where xxx in your first question &-um answer A is what they identified as a terminal exchange . 2526265_2549605
it's just two little short bye and the other person bye . 2550145_2553905
the form two which has a preclosing and a terminal exchange it's your answer C so there's actually a little bit of preclosing first a little bye see you later and then another okay bye . 2555025_2569725
and then form three will be your B answer in the first page . 2571285_2575505
and in the middle there's like an arrangement component . 2576225_2580585
it gives you the preclosing . 2581445_2582345
and then there's an arrangement that &~kin kind of trying to summarize what the conversation was about or what was going on before and then an actual closing . 2582245_2592425
and then the most &-uh complicated one which is shutting down the topic is answer D . 2593865_2600365
and once again they are kind of summarizing &-um what happened before . 2600865_2605385
and then there's actually two preclosing a closing and a terminal exchange . 2605385_2610245
so what we were &~h hoping for +... 2611305_2613745
and what they said &-um in their paper was that some cultures have minimal or no closing requirements while in others like in American English have fairly elaborate ones and that the closings are related to the context of the conversation and the context of the situation and for that +... 2616825_2635965
you want to go over it ? 2638245_2639385
sure . 2639745_2639925
so from this &-um basic knowledge we got from their paper we hypothesized that for question number one the first page we would expect more native speakers to choose closing form four which is D on your questionnaire more often than nonnative speakers . 2640955_2657415
&-um yeah . 2658235_2659755
so what we actually found was that &-um native speakers compared to nonnative speakers did choose form four &-um more frequently than nonnative speakers twenty five percent of them did . 2661595_2676095
&-um and then the other five or sixty two percent chose &-uh form one which answer A . 2676975_2684075
now because &-uh we expected that more &~n native speakers would choose form four . 2684385_2690785
an explanation as to possibly why they didn't is because of the instructions . 2691205_2695665
it says &~ab &-uh you're saying goodbye to <a close friend> a close friend on the telephone . 2695965_2699725
so native speakers might assume because it is a close friend that they probably often see them in person enough whereas it's not necessary to actually make lunch arrangements or set aside a special time to see them because it's a close friend you know probably talk often . 2700105_2714785
they might have class with them or something like that . 2715305_2717225
that could be an explanation <as to why> &~no as to why native not more native speakers chose form four the &-um the the the elaborate terminal exchange making &~arran arrangements to the preclosings . 2718205_2731225
&-um and as to a reason why they chose form one which is like the &~ve the very short one just a goodbye goodbye is because they're like okay you know just see you in class bye . 2732045_2739445
&-um what was interesting was that the nonnative speakers who we expected would choose forms &-um one and two because they &~d would not have this &-uh pragmatic knowledge that English is you know very elaborate in closure systems &-um we thought they would choose form one and two . 2740355_2756295
but they chose it's split evenly between form one and three which is the &-um one being the just goodbye goodbye and then form form three being &~th having the &-uh terminal the preclosing the arrangement and the terminal exchange . 2756315_2771135
&-um a &-uh perhaps it's just perhaps they they picked the shorter forms is because &-um in their native &~lang +//. 2772175_2782575
okay wait a minute . 2782915_2783515
perhaps they picked these forms &-uh because their native languages maybe have a shorter closing ritual also or they may also just have been here enough to realize that you know you &~t to just +//. 2783535_2796515
oh they they might also have realized that they see their these close friends in class or something like that . 2796735_2802115
so that was a bit of a surprise . 2802535_2803455
&-um but &~t &-um to support our hypothesis &-uh more native speakers did choose form four . 2804315_2809175
xxx .
yeah ? 2809935_2810395
you have one three two but you have A B C D . 2811785_2814825
right &~tha these are the answers on the questionnaire answer A B C and D for question number one so if you look at your questionnaire answer A corresponds to form one of the &~Bardovi_Harli +/. 2815085_2825725
+, ⌊ &~Harli ⌋ Harlig article yeah gets a little confusing and form B of that . 2826325_2831105
yeah we mixed them up because then you will have two lines three lines four lines and we thought they may kind_of be given out the answers if you put it that way . 2831875_2842175
&-um okay as for question number two that's the &-uh waitress question our hypothesis was +... 2843095_2850795
(0.5) &=searching_for_papers our hypothesis was that we would expect okay read that okay +//. 2856345_2860325
expect more native speakers to prefer the closing form two and three more often than nonnative speakers and form two and three two is answer A +//. 2860705_2871285
D on your questionnaire and &-um form three is question +//. 2871285_2875705
answer A on your questionnaire . 2876205_2877485
&-um what we found +... 2878785_2880645
was that +... 2881205_2884245
&-um sixty three percent or sixty two percent here of &-uh native speakers chose form two and twenty five percent of the native speakers chose form three as was expected . 2885345_2897985
the one native speaker who chose form four does that type of stuff in restaurants I I know her and she's very friendly very outgoing and just likes to make friends with everybody . 2898645_2909365
now what was the surprising factor was that the nonnative speakers also picked forms two two and three as often as the native speakers . 2912425_2923085
&-um whereas you know supporting the &-uh article we would expect them to pick the &-um the shorter &~t the shorter exchanges such as &-uh form one and two whereas they did pick form two but they didn't +//. 2924305_2936325
nobody +//. 2936685_2936705
none of the &~nati nonnative speakers picked form one . 2936985_2939285
&-um an explanation as to why the nonnative speakers might have also chosen the same forms as the native speakers would be perhaps the &-um the &~gr the testing group of nonnative speakers had a clearer understanding of this &~prag particular pragmatic context . 2940505_2954225
&-um perhaps here in Ann Arbor there's an opportunity to dine out more frequently . 2954985_2958905
and as students they you know go to coffee shops and go to area diners and have more experience in that pragmatic world . 2959745_2967265
&-um yes and that's it for questions one and two so there you go +... 2968945_2975405
as for questions three through four +... 2976545_2978485
well actually can I get I just want to get a show of hands <how many> &-um how many of all of you picked &-uh forms how many native speakers of English picked &-uh question picked answer number A for question number one ? 2981445_2994845
(0.7) nobody ? 3001685_3002205
okay xxx okay who picked for +//. 3002685_3006585
who picked answer A &-er answer B for question number one ? 3007065_3009805
okay who picked C ? 3011145_3012485
okay who picked D native speakers ? 3013965_3016165
one .
okay and what about nonnative speakers who picked answer A +..? 3016445_3020865
B +..? 3022745_3023205
C +..? 3024765_3025345
D +..?
from the distribution of hands it looks like it follows almost the same . 3032035_3035295
except those nonnative speakers . 3035295_3036675
yeah . 3037275_3037575
(be)cause no one picked A right ? 3038575_3040375
<native speakers> .
oh I did .
he did one person +... 3041535_3043995
alright <three and four> .
okay for questions three and four we tried to set up a context that &-um both native speakers and nonnative speakers (woul)d be familiar with . 3045235_3053155
for question three we talked about meeting with a professor for office hours and for question four it was about saying goodbye when &-um a friend is leaving at the airport and &-um for question three we tried tried to find some generalizations about &-um some of the ways that native speakers and nonnative speakers close . 3053185_3071565
&-um for nonnative speakers it was a_lot more common for them to avoid the closing like &-um the professor would say well if it'll just take a few minutes then we can do it now so then they never even hadta say goodbye or deal with that at all . 3072585_3085645
&-um see_you@q seems to be <pretty universal> pretty universal native speakers and nonnative speakers alike used that one a_lot <see you> see you later see you tomorrow but only the native speakers used see you tomorrow . 3086625_3097465
&-um they were more specific about time in general like three of the native speakers &-um said I'll see you at one o'clock set a specific time for the meeting . 3098265_3107885
&-um thank you and okay were basically only used by native speakers I'm not sure why nonnative speakers weren't as familiar with those expressions . 3108665_3115385
for question four +... 3116765_3119925
our hypothesis would be to expect the dialogue of the form four and that it would be produced more often by the native speakers than by the nonnative speakers and we definitely found that to be true +... 3122545_3132145
&-um this chart right here &-um you can see that the &~non &-er the native speakers used form four fifty percent of the time which made sense because this was with the close friend who's leaving at the airport . 3133385_3147885
and you'd expect it to be a longer dialogue where they're talking and saying goodbye for a longer period of time . 3148195_3154015
although native speakers did in a couple cases use the shorter forms &-um but those were a_lot more common with the nonnative speakers . 3154515_3160795
&-uh we don't know if it's just because +//. 3161795_3163055
&-um it doesn't seem like a cultural thing . 3164475_3166755
it seems like in most cultures you would have a long goodbye with a close friend . 3166875_3169515
so we figured it was just more simple for them to have a shorter closing when they were writing that . 3169875_3174215
&-um and a couple other things we found were appear that the native speakers used a_lot more nonverbal . 3174805_3182965
when they were writing it down they would use exclamation marks or underlining for emphasis or &-um they would allude to physical contact . 3183625_3189845
like in parentheses it would say they hugged they waved they kissed goodbye . 3190045_3193365
and &-um the nonnative speakers those would be expected of concentrated on the verbal . 3194105_3198305
probably that's as much as you know they could handle . 3198725_3201065
they didn't want to go into further nonverbal things . 3201115_3204715
&-um this was something interesting we found was that &-um in a couple cases the nonnative speakers and in one case the native speaker , instead of writing a dialogue format as we had asked in the instructions , they wrote it in narrative format like only one person spoke . 3204915_3220535
it was just a couple lines of one person speaking &-um but this only happened in cases where they answered the open ended before the multiple choice . 3220485_3230165
&-um when the multiple choice occurred first they would always use dialogue because it's like they had an example beforehand . 3231205_3236925
when they read the multiple choice it's like here's some examples of dialogues and they kind_of followed that when they &-um wrote the &~mul &-er the open ended question . 3237685_3244885
that's what the OM MO stands for . 3246895_3249015
yeah open +/. 3249235_3249675
open ended +/.
+, ended and multiple choice that's why we had half of you do it in one order and half of you do it in the other . 3249855_3254035
&-uh we're gonna read a couple examples of +... 3254695_3257715
what they wrote for the open ended questions . 3259595_3261155
&-um I'm gonna read nonnative speakers one case of form one the simplest form and one case of form four . 3261615_3270635
for the form one it was very simple it says &{l=READING me have a good time &}l=READING then the friend just leaving just said thanks it was very simple that's all they wrote &-um +... 3271255_3281135
but then for a form four the writer says bon_voyage which is interesting a whole different language thrown in there make sure to write to me then the friend says &{l=READING sure I will call you when I arrive there . 3283515_3294435
&}l=READING the writer &{l=READING if you need something please call me I'll send it to you . 3295235_3298035
&}l=READING the friend &{l=READING okay oh I have to go take care &}l=READING the writer &{l=READING you too &}l=READING so they talk about leaving they talk about writing they talk about having &~s them sent something so it's a little more in depth . 3298595_3308235
and I'm gonna read the native speakers' responses to question number four &-um one that we categorized as a form one the shortest just a terminal &~excha exchange she wrote &{l=READING hope you enjoy yourself and take care &}l=READING that was it . 3309755_3322935
&-um and the &~mo this is a form four the most lengthy kind &-uh the friend &{l=READING well you're going to have a great time &}l=READING her the writer &{l=READING yeah I really am excited &}l=READING &-um oh no you you is the person who's writing . 3323775_3338355
the writer &{l=READING well you are going to have a great time &}l=READING the friend &{l=READING yeah I'm really am excited . 3338855_3342675
&}l=READING you &{l=READING take a_lot_of pictures and when you get back we'll get together and you can tell me all about your trip &}l=READING her &{l=READING okay well it's about that time &}l=READING &-um you &{l=READING parentheses give her a hug have a safe trip and I'll see you when you get home . 3343245_3356205
okay &}l=READING well her &{l=READING okay bye . 3356685_3358385
bye . 3358705_3358865
&}l=READING so as you can see it's very kind of okay this is how I see myself in that situation she puts the hug in you know and it's very kind of &-uh casual and really she pictures herself and her friend in that situation . 3359045_3370045
versus the nonnative speaker where they did a good job but it &~j just doesn't have that quite same quality feel <as the> as the native speaker . 3370765_3379385
and that takes us to the conclusions which we reached two one for the &~no native speakers and one for nonnative speakers . 3379745_3387705
for native speakers we said that in general they used closures appropriate with the context of the situation and &-uh with nonnative speakers . 3388205_3397085
and we kinda base our conclusions more on the open ended questions than on the multiple choice questions just because the results were not that different . 3397385_3407185
and we thought that by writing it it took them a little bit longer to come up with a form . 3407885_3412465
so by &~th by the writing part we concluded that in general nonnative &~s &-uh speakers did not use the appropriate pragmatic form in the open ended questions especially those that completed the multiple choice open ended questionnaire . 3413045_3427285
<are there> ?
no . 3428525_3429645
multiple choice . 3430405_3430685
⌈ yeah ⌉ . 3431305_3431525
⌊ yeah ⌋ . 3431785_3431945
and &-um then relation to our findings &-uh to current second language acquisition research &-uh we said we're in favor of the formal teaching of pragmatics and we are suggesting some methods on the next transparency and &-uh we said that nonnative speakers seem to understand that closures exist but do not have the language forms to perform them like native speakers . 3433615_3460755
we feel that this seems to be evidence that the native language is interfering with the production of this pragmatic element &-um because maybe closings is something that happens in the culture and they may be taking that form and putting it into English and that's why it may not work and in terms of this we we kind of described their closings as more bookish . 3461695_3484535
<kind of dull> . 3484915_3485955
right . 3486475_3486895
thank you see you okay +/. 3487255_3488795
⌈ okay bye ⌉ +/. 3489935_3491515
+, ⌊ bye ⌋ and &-um that's why it lacked some of the language that native speakers were +/. 3490015_3494575
+, ⌈ one ⌉ +/. 3494995_3495015
+, ⌊ using ⌋ .
I just wanna say one thing about &-um the &-uh about the &~o other conclusion about the interference of the native language . 3495355_3504595
I know personally when I went &-uh to Italy I I knew that I just sounded kind of awkward . 3505075_3511915
I just didn't really sound like a native speaker because I was missing some of those little like key words that kind_of lead you into a sentence kind_of like when we say +"/. 3512075_3518715
+" okay look this is how I feel . 3518935_3520295
or +"/.
+" listen you know I don't feel well today . 3520995_3523395
and I know that I'm like so what's that word I need to just launch me into a a more fluent &~soundi sounding sentence ? 3523755_3529035
and finally after like &-um actually I'm &~tak currently taking a conversation class right now and we finally the teacher taught us this word senti@s:fra which means like listen . 3529595_3538215
and I'm telling you I feel so much better speaking in Italian now (be)cause I have this kind_of I feel very cultural very you know widely used word that can you know let me feel comfortable in my you know launching into the introduction of a sentence . 3538575_3551315
so I felt that related pretty well to you know the the nonnative speakers and to the teaching of pragmatics and &-um classes but we'll come back to that in a minute . 3551715_3562775
but right so our study &~con confirmed the finding that Bardovi_Harlig in terms of the four different closing forms identified by them . 3562865_3570745
and that they &-um found that &-um nonnative speakers &-uh frequently choose the shorter forms and native speakers sometimes choose the longer forms or have access to that in their pragmatics . 3571765_3584285
and also that there are these such four forms in the &-um in the language in the American language &-er English language . 3584985_3592265
&-um and as some suggested methods of instruction we kind_of thought of for the classroom was making the nonnative speakers aware of their own closures through appropriate and inappropriate role play . 3592745_3605065
&-um like I said before just if you become aware of +//. 3605625_3609305
okay if there's a bunch of nonnative speakers in a classroom and the teacher says +"/. 3609565_3612325
+" okay today we're going to you know learn about closures . 3612305_3615325
and what they do is they the teacher asks them to perform a role play and &~m perhaps their native language and make them pay particular attention to the closing of the conversation . 3615725_3624845
and then students become aware of +"/. 3625405_3626765
+" oh I say you_know bye and then goodbye again . 3627045_3630465
and this awareness helps them start thinking about how they would how their &-uh pragmatic &~conver closure conversation can &-uh transfer into the nonnative language . 3630955_3640635
&-um so then after the instructor does the native &~lang &~n language closure &-uh move on to a nonnative language type of closure say +"/. 3641455_3649435
+" okay I would like you to role play in English how you would say goodbye to you know your friends . 3649595_3655055
and just actually do these role plays . 3655195_3657315
although people might think a little embarrassed at first a little funny . 3657535_3660215
but yeah I think the awareness also Bardovi and Harlig spoke about it xxx the +//. 3660475_3665415
kind of affects people's cognitive awareness as to how they can become more comfortable in it . 3665795_3687355
&-um also listening to native speakers' closure in natural settings and just &-uh just &~l actually listening to the closure as opposed to the &-uh you know meaning of the &~co conversation and just kind_of listening to it in a in like in a coffee shop of maybe &-uh an assignment from &-uh nonnative speakers to just go to a coffee shop and just listen to people and how they're ending the conversation would make them more aware and perhaps help them in their fluidity of the language +... 3672555_3698275
and one other thing . 3700055_3701815
okay I'm gonna talk about how our project could be improved &-um in the instructions +... 3702755_3707055
it said in this part you will write a dialogue for each of the scenarios and as I said before some people did not write dialogues they just wrote a small kind of narrative form so maybe it +//. 3708715_3718395
phrasing it differently like saying &-um please do this instead of you will do this just ⌈ somehow suggest that ⌉ . 3718655_3726435
⌊ we we we said ⌋ that that was an &~ex I wrote that part so it was an example of of my own pragmatic thing to do <I guess> so I wrote you will and we think it should be please . 3725215_3735215
it's not a huge thing but +...
okay in terms of the format of the questions we thought we could provide more informational context . 3735775_3742595
the reason for that is we had one Russian subject who was a visiting professor who was a little bit upset with the way we phrased this for him +//. 3743155_3750035
he didn't answer almost all the questions he kept writing that we didn't have enough informational context &-um for example on question two the multiple choice he says &{l=READING maybe it would be D &}l=READING and he said &{l=READING as far as this is a business situation I would use polite neutral . 3750145_3764065
again it depends how frequently I visit this place and how long I've known this server . 3764605_3767945
depending on this I would consider it to be a different option &}l=READING so maybe for people who like it really specific we could &-uh include that in the &-uh ⌈ setup for each question ⌉ . 3768505_3777005
⌊ we we ⌋ we didn't ask ourselves open ended questions and he said that the topic and the context needs to be provided . 3777645_3784825
which we thought we did but maybe it wasn't specific ⌈ enough ⌉ . 3785985_3787985
⌊ I I ⌋ had like a five minute conversation with him . 3788205_3790245
&=laughs:S11 he he seems to be his line of research seems to be questionnaires . 3790585_3795665
questionnaires .
well taken . 3796045_3799565
and we thought maybe we could task we could alternate open ended and multiple choice questions or to do surveys which is all open ended on one and all multiple choice on the other because it did affect it when we did it one way or the other . 3801255_3812935
some people didn't write in dialogue form if they hadn't seen it an example of it first so maybe we'd take that into consideration the next time . 3813555_3831235
and the other one we had that I just noticed is not there is &-uh using three different levels of proficiency because &-um in the article that we read &-um it says that even very proficient second language learners still have problems with pragmatic concepts so we would like to see how they are really different . 3819935_3838575
any questions ? 3839555_3842935
yeah ?
did you take sex into account with your results ? 3848495_3851315
no . 3851675_3851855
which might also be interesting to see because most of our native speakers were female so that might account for the hugs and kisses goodbye but &-um +/. 3852655_3864915
think so ? 3865135_3865795
+, yeah +... 3865915_3866175
but &-um so no we didn't take sex into account . 3867775_3869595
so that would be a good thing or be an interesting thing to do next time if this experiment was done again to look at the differences between sexes . 3870695_3877875
this because intuitively I've I've I've no basis for this but I think that women probably draw things out more +/. 3878335_3884095

I was just thinking another thing you might look at is if there +//. 3907975_3912115
if they choose short answers all across the board it might &~h have something to do with personality +/. 3912555_3917735

⌊ yeah in a &~quest &~no ⌋ not in the actual setting just in the questionnaire form ⌈ so ⌉ . 3929365_3932805
⌊ yeah ⌋ that's what +//. 3932805_3933305
that would be an idea as to +//. 3933465_3934585
(be)cause we first we wanted to do like verbal like actually naturalistic setting and listening to people and how they would close &~th close the conversation but that no that's fairly difficult so of_course I think you know as relating back to your question earlier &-um oral I think information research will always give you a different answer than written because people are in a hurry . 3934965_3954065
and I did the &-um nonnative speakers surveys but &-um and it was after a class and they were really into it and they they wanted all of them to finish so I could say what was the purpose of it they +//. 3954825_3968145
you know they were not in a hurry to finish it and actually the because when when they saw the the surveys we were concerned that the Russian student didn't write anything but he was the last one to turn it in so it was not even lack of interest he was really into it so . 3968145_3987665
xxx yeah ?
did you find any difference with the &-um modality as far as whether they were talking face to face or the telephone (be)cause I know there's some cultures you don't say goodbye on the telephone . 3990625_3996465
like Russians &~wou don't say goodbye on the telephone but yet they'll stand there for four hours and say goodbye at the train station . 3996825_4002245
no that would be the multiple choice &-um no because only one person +... 4003065_4009425
said &~any said +//. 4011205_4012845
did the long form for the multiple choice and &-um for the long form for question number two with the waitress ⌈ no I ⌉ . 4012105_4019065
⌊ you mean ⌋ it didn't vary within the individual xxx . 4019065_4021105
no that that really didn't vary it was more how I think it was more focusing on how <you know> you know quickly they either could say get off or finish the conversation &~vers you know we'll make it a more drawn out thing I don't think it ⌈ would have to do with ⌉ . 4021365_4039565
⌊ it it ⌋ seemed that their answers especially to a multiple choice question had more to do with which part of the survey they did first because for the first question three of the four people that did open ended first answered A on the first question so it was and then +//. 4035725_4052545
it was the same way in terms of the dialogue &-uh in the open ended if &~y they did the multiple choice first they would write a dialogue in the second part but if they were doing the open ended it was more of a narrative answer and then they would still <do the multiple choice> . 4052665_4066405
that's why we want to alternate next time we do it . 4066425_4068605
but I I think that sort of what people are feeling what Magdalene was talking about and related to Philip and xxx and I'm trying to think did we ever talk about doing a telephone I mean rather the longitudinal thing some some pragmatics really it doesn't seem that it it takes on a paper pencil . 4069855_4086375
now the other one because we do do invitations on a &-um email at times there's some reality to that situation but closure that the kind of closure you're looking for is I think very difficult to come by on a printed page +/. 4086815_4102335
yeah +/.
+, and it's sort_of like refusals apologies too although we do do apologies there so I I think that really until you could get a little bit of information from an oral &~r some real data it's gonna be hard to do to imagine what it is <and I> and I think that there's a_lot_of interference in terms of using a written task for some of these things then . 4102705_4123525
you know closure seems like one of them I don't know . 4123925_4125985
marriage proposal might be another &=laughs:multiple . 4126485_4127545
yeah I don't know . 4127545_4128205
I mean it just seems like some of them are more you know have to look at the modality . 4128305_4132805
and and I think that's an interesting thing too that there's been a_lot_of change across that kind of thing . 4133045_4138765
