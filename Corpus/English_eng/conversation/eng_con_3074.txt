okay . 4100_4190
now could I continue designing two by twos with these the same
but these four that I did so far represent a full family . 9850_14280
well today when you get to the computer what I want you to do is
though . 18830_19060
you'll pro you'll probably design a much more complex courseware
I I just did this as a sample . 23670_25300
so what you're gonna be ready to do now though is to save your work
I want to be able to see all of your quilt families anytime I want
and I want you to be able to show them to other people . 33490_35970
and if we just logged out now or whatever we save any of this . 36240_39000
so to save and geometry and design see the picture of the little
you move your picture up and click through your mouse on that . 45250_48100
and then you keep holding the mouse down . 48630_50050
and you go yep down until save is highlighted . 50130_53050
and then let up . 53130_53940
okay . 54550_54640
now you have to wait . 54840_55460
okay . 55630_55750
now now you know you're ready to save files . 56040_58220
well this is the yellow box is where we wanna name this &-um this
so I'm gonna click up here . 66500_67820
and then I'm gonna use my backspace to erase that . 68450_71140
I don't wanna call it family . 71200_72110
I wanna call it family one . 72480_74260
(be)cause that was the first family that I designed family one . 74600_79060
I don't leave a space . 79240_80030
remember your name for your file . 80520_81340
has to be one big long word even if it's there . 81420_84140
so family one . 84220_85190
and now that's the name I want for it . 85490_87140
I click on . 87280_87870
okay . 88590_88860
all right . 90860_91100
and now so you can tell it named it family one (be)cause . 91140_93430
see if there by the Coer it says . 93600_94980
family one . 95590_96070
then what I can do is I can &-um we're gonna be going through that
they'll give me a new and now let's just see if it's there . 111880_113620
(be)cause if you came back another time if you went to explore if
if you click on that little computer icon again you wanna well that
gonna open that up . 132080_133100
and there it is . 134300_134810
these are the files that are in there so far family one . 134830_137020
and plan did we put that in there sometime . 137070_139490
no . 140250_140360
let's see what that is . 140810_141560
that's the one we'll say that we wanna open then . 142410_144280
but family one is still there that must be part of their
(be)cause I did not save that . 150670_151650
okay . 152480_152650
so we want to open a different file . 153450_156340
we wanna open family one . 157020_158460
okay . 159660_159930
that's okay . 160590_161010
that's the one we wanna open . 161030_161970
yeah . 165760_165930
and there it is the one . 166550_167290
so it's still there saved . 167480_168210
if you save it correctly it'll be there . 168320_169690
then what you would do is . 169710_171230
yes you would just &-um it's saved . 171970_174780
no it's already saved . 175220_176220
that's still saved it'll never unsave it . 176770_178970
once you've got it saved . 179170_179980
so if you save it the correctly it'll always be there . 180090_181860
and we looked just to show you it was really there . 181880_183900
I'm gonna click on explore again and design family . 184320_186580
two . 186780_186980
and once I've got it designed I'll click on the little computer
name that one family two . 190270_191510
okay . 192890_193020
and then . 193090_193350
okay . 193430_193530
once I've type in the name and that's okay . 193760_195130
that's the name I wanna save it under . 195240_196620
so in the time you get at the computer station today . 197130_199660
mhm . 199820_200110
I want you to make as many different quilt families as you can . 200960_204940
might be June might be three might be five . 205570_207440
I don't know . 207800_208150
(be)cause you might get to cycle back through the the computer
okay . 212910_213040
and this first time that you're there only quilt families later
but for today we're just gonna do quilt families . 220700_222540
so you get to add Amanda already has &-um two quilt families saved
she'll just then the first one you do today you'll just name it
(be)cause it'll be your third one . 230240_231100

and it would be hard to know what to put like the triangles . 529080_532530
uhhuh . 532950_533180
that's what you happened with your first design . 533370_535800
