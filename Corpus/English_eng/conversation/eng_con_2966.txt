what's volume ? 7325_8065
S_one ?
volume is the space inside of objects, like if you're using a rectangular prism you can put cubes in it to measure the volume . 9725_18985
okay .
can someone repeat what S_one said ? 19705_21905
S_two ?
S_one said that volume is the space inside of something that you can measure with squares or +... 26375_36575
okay .
S_one, is that what you said ? 38255_39175
yeah .
yes, okay . 39635_41115
how do we measure the space inside something ? 41315_43355
S_two said we use squares . 43495_44815
is that how we measure the space inside a rectangular prism ? 45295_48135
S_three ?
cubes . 49175_50095
you use cubes . 51335_52635
you use cubes . 52635_53415
why would we use cubes to measure the space inside ? 53805_55845
because they have a top, a side, and a back, and a front, and a side, and a bottom . 56165_64185
and a square just has +... 65045_66145
just flat . 66965_67565
it's not like a big cube, so a cube's easier to measure the space inside . 67765_75165
okay . 75385_75625
would anyone like to agree or disagree with S_three ? 75905_77665
S_four, go ahead . 77905_80105
I agree with S_three because cubes would be easier to do it with because if you use squares because they're two-d +... 80905_89105
like to make a cube you'd have to make about like five or six layers of a flat +... 89465_97705
probably lots more to make actually one cube so that it would just take less cubes to fill up a room than squares . 98625_107365
so you would use cubes rather than squares to fill up ? 107425_109805
okay . 110245_110325
so volume is the amount of space that it takes to fill up a three-dimensional object . 111145_115925
right ?
and we're going to measure that object in cubic units today . 116545_120325
and that's how you would always measure volume . 121025_122465
you can measure volume by using cubic units . 122605_124665
okay ? 125385_125645
all right . 126205_126945
