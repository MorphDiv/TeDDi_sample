I know well and I mean okay Emory wants to get his doctorate so
mm . 365820_366380
+, you know and then then there's four or five years doing the damn

although we like the place we're in no hurry to leave it . 375500_377370
yeah . 377710_378170

I mean you have to like look at like both ad- I mean they both
in what oth- ever place you're in +/. 446980_448500
mhm . 448610_449100
+, and think about the disadvantages of the place that you're not
yeah . 452340_452750
Otherwise you go nuts right ? 452620_453820

you know remember how crowded the transportation is and &-uh what
mm . 463300_463660
how expensive everything is . 464450_466470
&=breath and &-uh &=breath I- you know I remember those things of
And you work you know possibilities were a_lot more limited . 469700_472720
True . 472540_473080
and the language you know . 473570_474990
yeah . 475090_475480
constantly like kind of like I mean those could be p- considered
yeah . 479410_479700
but I mean you mind as well think of them in a negative vie- rather
mhm sure . 481990_482800
They just like &=breath worrying over them . 482250_484350
Well you know . 483510_484210
and that's why I'm I I . 484660_485600
it helps to have . 485800_486780
kind_of a glimpse into the future right ?
And that's how that's how we got to +/. 486880_489870
mm . 489200_489480
+, Spain in the first place is we said we wanted to live abroad and
mm . 495490_495910
+, we had this idea of and I I really feel that that's important
so what I'm having an idea of now is . 499110_500590
okay you know Emory works on his doctorate it takes about five or
we have the kid probably . 505070_506490
we he gets a research position . 506890_508630
somewhere in France or in Spain &-um . 508690_511760
and then we move over there and you know . 512380_514450
I take care of the kid and and . 514729_516530
do some you know little day labor whatever you know we'll see
mm . 520240_520550
um and we have relatively mellow life for who knows five or ten
&=lipsmack yeah because even like you know I mean all that stuff
whatever change in the weather &=laughs that happens to be right ? 531000_533850
mhm .
oh I know I know . 532770_534700
And and it's like . 534570_535690
you know what I think because I get like the same I get the same as
you know what the hell am I doing not not with my life but ge- but
yeah . 543980_544080
you know like what like where do I get the animal to to just you
to do anything you know xxx I just lay in bed and dream for for the
yeah . 548990_549270
I know . 550790_551280
Well . 551910_552180
I I know I know what you're saying I I feel there's sort of a . 552460_555070
a line to cross too between really planning it out and worry and
for a while a couple months back there I was thinking in terms of
mm . 566580_566900
and then we sat down and sort of looked at it financially and said
is this what we really want to be worrying about right now and you
yeah absolutely . 571900_572980
and and so you know you can sort of focus too much on the future or
And miss the present completely I mean miss like you know the smell
yeah . 580590_581000
yeah yeah . 584650_585360
you know and e- each little &=breath I mean i-it's like as far as
