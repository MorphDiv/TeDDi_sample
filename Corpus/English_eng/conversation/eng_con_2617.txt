&=slides_used_throughout I truly appreciate it I have to say that I am allergic to citrus fruits .
oh .
⌈ you're kidding .
that's the worst thing I've ever heard ⌉ .
⌊ so I am I know ⌋ .
⌈ I'll have it ⌉ .
⌊ oh no no over here ⌋ .
it's so mine .
&=laughs:multiple it is &~s +/.

+, it is so mine .
you already got one .
this is like the Lord of the Flies why don't you just ⌈ share it ⌉ ?
⌊ I bought one ⌋ .
I bought it .
⌈ there's plenty for everybody ⌉ .
⌊ <he's got> he's got one he's got a box of Thin Mints over there ⌋ .
that's true .
you have a box of Thin Mints ?
where'd you find Thin Mints ?
none of the girl scouts ⌈ that we found had Thin Mints ⌉ .
⌊ he he gave (th)em to me for a grapefruit ⌋ .
⌈ right down the street ⌉ .
⌊ they have (th)em right down there ⌋ .
alright ⌈ so you get xxx ⌉ .
⌊ no you share them come on children Jesus ⌋ .
⌈ we have Caramel Delights we have Peanut Butter Patties ⌉ +/.
⌊ you traded one grapefruit for a box of cookies ⌋ ?
+, but we have not found Thin Mints .

I'll I'll get look I'll get you the Thin Mints if you ⌈ get the grapefruit ⌉ .
⌊ that doesn't even sound like a healthy habit man ⌋ .
do you realize this is what they're taking down ?
⌈ I don't care ⌉ .
+, ⌊ I want Thin Mints ⌋ .
I want grapefruit .
I want this .
alright so I think you should &~spun maybe have it split between all of you .
yeah share it xxx ⌈ come on xxx ⌉ .
⌊ share it ⌋ &~n maybe we'll do that after the class (be)cause I don't know how you'd do it .
I I can cut it up .
&=laughs can you cut it up so that everybody gets a piece ?
you're gonna get thrown out_of school waving that thing around like that .
sure .
okay .
there you are .
voila .
actually as long as I don't bring some kind of chemical explosive device on campus +/.
yeah ?
+, it's pretty hard for me to get kicked out for a &~we on a weapons charge .
that's only +//.
what is that ?
I mean I xxx thought it was something a_lot longer than a xxx .
doesn't everybody have a Swiss army knife ?
no no not in the University of Michigan +/.
⌈ I mean everybody +//.
my husband carries a Swiss army knife ⌉ .
+, ⌊ is explicitly excepted from the state law because the ⌋ Chinese department complained about having the huge swords on campus .
oh_my_gosh .
I'm sorry .
that's cool .
they complained about that ?
yeah they did .
or because the Japanese has the swords and the Chinese department was complaining ?
what ?
no I don't think so .
(be)cause Japan kept invading China .
no .
no ?
⌈ I don't think so ⌉ .
⌊ no ⌋ .
okay can I explain to you why I was late ?
(be)cause I feel really bad about it .
one thing about this class is that I use slides but &~s the times that I use slides well the problem is is that a_lot_of times the slides I wanna use are already being used by another class .
so I hafta I have a meeting just before this class I hafta hotfoot it over to Tappan get the slides and wrench them sometimes from the people who have them which means I have to run around upstairs &=laughs and say do you have this ?
do you have that ?
and then I grab them .
so this today was really awful .
but you have the slides I want you to know you've got them .
I pried them away .
do you feel special ?
that's the pirate .
in fact Kathy you probably saw something this morning that I pried away from .
no +/.
⌈ no ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ I took a ⌋ big fat exam this morning and .
oh you did ?
&~ho how'd it go ?
it went .
&=laughs:multiple .
going going .
<it was> it was good .
it was good .
that's a good example of xxx .
yeah .
alright today we're going +/.
⌈ us native speakers ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to &~ta I really wish ⌋ <we could> we could have class outside but we can't .
sure we can .
(be)cause I've gotta ⌈ I know we've gotta have slides ⌉ .
⌊ you can put it on like the ⌋ wall or something .
no .
no way Jose .
and especially after I've ⌈ done all this xxx ⌉ +/.
⌊ we'll all hold up our notebooks and ⌋ +/.
+, after I've gone to all this trouble guys you've gotta so what I need you to do is make your little O like just widen the circle a little bit and pay attention to the screen and we'll talk through this .
today we're gonna talk about &~sculp the medium of sculpture .
do you know what this class +//.
I'm sorry tell me your name again .
Janine Ovens .
Janine Ovens <this is a> this is a kind of an introduction to theories of &~ar of art in the Renaissance .
whoops .
I'm like where's my new folder ?
and we've been doing +//.
we've been talking about each individual medium we've done painting we've done graphics &=background_conversation ⌈ and now we're going to do sculpture ⌉ .
so we're gonna see some ⌊ really beautiful things ⌋ today I have to say .
I really wish that we could +//.
oh no .
⌈ you're gonna be the closest to the microphone you're not gonna <even say> anything ⌉ .
no .
⌊ you're gonna be on the web ⌋ .
<you really wish that we could> oh no what ?
holy Moses .
<what is this> ?
what'd you do Beth ?
I thought I forgot <some slides> .
bye Beth .
bye .
alright now okay so today we're going to talk about sculpture and unfortunately as I said we have to use slides we can't be in front of the objects but we do have some nice slides so it's not gonna be too bad .
and hopefully you've done although I know it's midterm week so my guess is you haven't done your reading from Taylor is that right ?
I did it all like two weeks ago .
who's done the reading from Taylor ?
&=laughs:multiple whoa .
wait say that again .
I read part of it .
+, let me see Taylor readers ?
excellent .
&~midter no I +//.
this week I expect everyone's taking midterms .
I read it all of it like last week .
I've read stuff but I didn't read Taylor .
not the right one .
so how are you finding Taylor anyway ?
&-um subpar .
what ?
sub par .
sub far ?
par .
sub par .
hard ?
par like golf .
sub par oh oh under par .
mkay yeah no he's not a thrilling writer I would say .
but it's very useful information and I don't know of another one that does that .
yeah .
+, unfortunately .
I really don't .
well the best part is that list in the back .
&=laughs:S1 it's awesome .
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to be able to ⌋ cross all the the music and the lit .
yeah <that is nice> that is nice .
and the art .
I agree .
alright .
you were all making so much noise about wanting some of this grapefruit .
it was mostly me and him .
we don't want all that mess .
you all &=laughs xxx .
this is the grapefruit class .
Zack was too .
what ?
you said you wanted some .
no I don't want any .
I said it was a bad addiction that he was getting into .
oh .
I'll take the rest of it .
no come on .
okay .
this is a one characteristic of sculpture that is completely different from any other media we've had so far is kind_of illustrated on the screen .
do you know what that is ?
different perspectives ?
three dimensionality ?
say that again .
being able to see it from various perspectives .
yeah .
but you have to see yeah it's three dimensional .
and the thing is that with a three dimensional object that alters your analysis of it considerably and that really makes it a bit it's a huge difference in the way you approach sculpture than the way you approach painting or graphic &~architec &-um <or the> or the graphic arts .
we're really moving <into the> into the round and in order really to deal with sculpture you hafta be able to see it from all the angles that it's meant to be seen from .
which means &-um that your analysis it's it kind of compounds the problem &~y you look at it from the front but then you really have only done half of it &-um you gotta go around the back and take a look at what is there unless the sculpture is frontally meant to be frontal and frontally placed .
now early most of the sculpture that we looked at <in the> in the Greek &~peri in the ancient period when I showed you the Parthenon sculptures were actually meant to be seen only from the front .
but things like the Venus of Willendorf which is actually held in the hand is meant to be not only seen from all angles but handled .
you know what I mean ?
so you have to really take that into consideration .
I'm just showing you one classical example you should have this &~sh that's shown in every art history class or I think you do Katie have you seen this yet ?
I think so but .
this is the Rape of the &~S this is &~you &~n the second part of your midterm .
&=laughs this is by Giovanni Da_Bologna which is really John from Bologna so that is Giovanni do you do I need to &~sp it's D A B O L .
O G N A .
Bologna like not like baloney but like .
it's spelled the same way .
that's what it that's ⌈ that's where bologna comes from ⌉ .
⌊ how do you &~sp I thought ⌋ how do you spell Bologna baloney ?
isn't it .
same way .
B O L O G N A .
I thought you spelled baloney in a in American B A L O N E Y ?
⌈ no nobody spells it like that ⌉ .
⌊ there is an American way of spelling it but that's not how ⌋ like a butcher shop would spell it .
&{l=SINGING my baloney has a first name it's O S C A R &}l=SINGING &=pauses .
and the <the name of the piece is> the name of the piece is The Rape of the Sabines and it's &-um +...
&=writes:board The Rape of the Sabines .
The Rape of the Sabines is not a biblical story it is a anybody know ?
how would you figure out the iconography of this ?
it's hard I think if you have never heard of The Rape of the Sabines .
Greek ?
is it Greek ?
Greek .
⌈ is it like an old Greek fable ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ &-uh no but close ⌋ .
Roman .
Roman .
it's Roman yeah .
it's it's an ancient &-um Roman &~top &-um ancient Roman subject it actually is a historical event .
&-um in which &-uh two tribes one of which was called the Sabines and I don't know what the other one was called &=laughs but anyway &-um they were invaded &=cough:SUm and the &-um +/.
bless you .
+, that was a cough thanks though .
+, the &-um the Sabine women were all taken by their <by the> &-um by the the other tribe .
they were raped &-um and they were brought back to live with &-um <with those> with that tribe and they had children .
&-um and <when the> &~neigh <when the> &~t <when the tribe> <when their> when the Sabine tribe attacked the other tribe to get &-um their women back &-um the women stood between the warring factions &-um because <their children> because they wanted to protect their children .
so the the notion is <that you> that that these women are protecting their children even though they've been raped by the other race .
quite a nice story anyway I mean the rape part isn't but what the women did is very nice anyway .
well look how they're dressed .
what ?
I said well look how they're dressed they were asking for it .
they're not wearing any clothes .
what ?
are you just trying to start a fire ?
yeah he's just trying to start a little thingy .
yeah yeah .
be quiet .
but she's naked .
okay .
alright .
so &~th but the but we're not actually going to concentrate on this because we don't have that many good slides of it .
&-um and it's but what's important about it again is that if you +//.
<here's the> &~f here's the back view and here's the front view and you really can't tell what's going on until you've actually circumviewed@n$part the sculpture .
here's &-um a Sabine woman being taken away by the attacking tribe and a Sabine man being pushed down &-um by the attacker .
weak effort right there .
yeah .
what ?
don't &=laughs don't take me &=laughs:multiple .
alright .
so the point is the point I just wanna make is that that that always you &~n the first thing you need to think about is to look at it from multiple &-um angles .
okay &-um now we're gonna go on and talk about the materials of sculpture and again remember when we talked about painting we divided it into water based paint and oil based &-um pigment oil mixed pigment we're gonna divide sculpture equally into these two huge categories .
&-um one is what &-um Taylor calls &-um additive that is sculpture that's made up with a building up of forms so additive A D D I T I V E and the other is +..?
subtractive .
excellent .
&=laughs you got it .
subtractive .
additive and subtractive which means sculpture that's made by the taking away of of forms okay ?
and you can &~r you really pretty much can divide sculpture into these two &-um categories but each of them depending on whether you you are an additive sculptor or a subtractive sculptor <I think> &~Te I think what's his name &-um Taylor uses the term glyptic glyptic and haptic which I think is kind_of unnecessarily complex additive and subtractive is pretty reasonable should I spell glyptic for you ?
no that's ⌈ unnecessary ⌉ .
⌊ sure ⌋ .
no let's ⌈ just pretend we never learned it ⌉ .
⌊ it's in the reading ⌋ .
okay .
+, it's in the reading .
+, okay .
+, anyway .
&=laughs so &-um what we're gonna do is we're going to look at subtractive and then we're gonna look at we're gonna look at carving and we're gonna start out with a really spectacular example .
(0.6) .
do you have a knife <that I can cut it> ?
I was just doing it with my xxx (0.6) .
it's like everybody's got a pen out but nobody has paper .
now it's gonna take you a while to figure this out but look at it there are two different views of something .
is that Poseidon ?
<look at> look at it carefully .
(0.12) this is a &~s &-um a sculpture by Michelango and it's called the Bearded Boboli Slave and you just don't +/.
what ?
+, now let me tell you why it's called the Bearded well it's bearded the slave is bearded &-um it is an unfinished sculpture by Michelangelo and lemme write this name on the board .
and I'm pretty sure you can &=writes:board Michelangelo .
and you can just call it a Boboli slave and the reason is +/.
+, oh Boboli +/.
+, yeah Boboli .
the reason is because the slaves &~ar &~wer are owned by the Boboli family .
that's &~w they're an Italian family rich family the Bobolis there's a Boboli <if you go to> &-um if you go to Florence there's a Boboli Gardens also in association with that family .
now the thing about this this wonderful &-um Boboli slave is that <it is> it is unfinished .
and so what we get to do is we get to actually see Michelangelo at work .
this is a way of really getting into the process of how this &~in extraordinary sculpture works .
but it also illustrates a real problem of &-um of subtractive sculpture of of the use of carving .
and that is that when the sculptor gets a block of marble which this material is or a block of stone they have to gauge exactly the proportions they have to kind_of understand how they're going to work not only &-um from top to bottom but in three dimensions .
and if you have a figure that's not like this right ?
if you have a figure that's that's twisted or turned or whatever &-um you &~ca you you can't be absolutely sure that you've got it right .
&~d can you imagine that ?
can you imagine what he's having to do what he's trying to do ?
well he abandoned work on The Boboli Slaves because he really felt that it just didn't &~wor it he <he couldn't> he couldn't get that figure out_of this the &~s the marble he hadta take away things from the marble but he just he couldn't imagine actually finishing it .
can you see how the proportions would be a problem here if he were to continue on with this carving ?
Olivia you had your hand up .
I was gonna ask the medium .
⌈ but you said it ⌉ .
⌊ the medium ⌋ it's marble .
so I mean yeah &~i subtractive sculpture is can &~incl &~i involves carving and you can work in wood you can work in stone you can use metal you can use ivory you can use bone you can even use plastics .
some people use plastics .
but the whole notion is that you cut away from the original block of material .
it's a real test of skill and it involves real risk as we've been seeing because it's impossible to replace the portions that once have been &~cu &-uh cut away .
in this way there's a very close analogy to what ?
another medium that we've been talking about Rose ?
temporal .
I'm not sure .
I bet you &~t <I bet> I bet you were right .
try it .
I was gonna say when you paint on the wall but I just forgot what it was called .
yeah <it could be like> &~fres it could be like fresco which Taylor talks about in a way but try something else <it's even more> it's even more analogous .
remember what we just saw ?
printing ?
the engraving stone ?
the etching stuff ?
yeah engraving .
the etchings well but even more if you're cutting away something .
wood cuts .
⌈ wood cuts ⌉ .
⌊ wood ⌋ cuts yeah .
the Durer flagellation that we looked at last time .
it's really analogous to that .
you've gotta have it on the ball .
you really have to because once you slip or make a mistake you're in deep doo_doo .
no but if you don't if you can't &-um finish it up and even such artists as Michelangelo did screw+up .
&-um what happens is that &-um what usually happens in the first stage though of carving on stone which is really difficult .
I_mean we we talked about how difficult it is to get that little detail &-um in <when you're doing wood> &~c when you're doing wood carving and then also when you're doing engraving .
well here you've got to imagine that you need to have +...
at least with with with Durer he had a little knife .
you know what I mean ?
he had a little knife and he was managing it with his hand right ?
and and and when he did etchings he was managing it again with his hand and his fingers he had control over this part of his arm .
now this is heavy labor .
so &-um to carve stone especially stone of this size we're not talking about a Venus of Willendorf size stone which is &-uh you can hold in your hand here we're talking about a block of marble that's bigger than the artist .
right ?
so <these are> these are more than life size .
and in_order_to get down &~i you_know down into it you've gotta do this really heavy labor , you've gotta do a_lot_of chipping and &-um hammering .
&-um wait lemme make sure I've told you all the different +//.
so the first thing that you hafta do is you hafta kind_of hew out a rough shape .
and what you can see is that here's the rough shape that he's worked at but you can also see how he's done it .
you know it's a really labor intensive process because you can't just cut away you know what I mean ?
think of a block of marble you have to kind_of take &-um you have to take tools and hammer and chip away the marble .
you see it ?
and you can what you can do is you can actually see Michelangelo working here on the marble &-um in various ways and you can see how this is the this was the original very rough hewn block right ?
and then he goes in closer and he starts doing detail and then then his strokes have to become finer and finer .
now what I'd like you to do is to all come up to see this because you need to see <the different> &-um the different kinds of textures that come when you're doing rough labor and &~hi and fine chipping .
you know what I mean ?
and you can see that right here .
you can see all this stuff right around here look look in here and &~wha get get in close and take a look at the &-um detail now and then take a look at this area so you can get a sense of what's going on .
so just come on up .
come on either side and don't block the light and xxx (0.7) did you see it ?
yeah I did and you can see the xxx .
and <you can> you can <see and> see and see the two different ones actually there are a bunch of different kinds .
do you see ?
this is one right here see all those little &-uh thingys those lines ?
right .
+, that's the detail this is the heavier chipping out .
you can actually you just see that he just put a you know a tool up here and went <bang bang> bang bang &=laughs:SUm .
yeah and <look at> look at these little lines right here .
see the little all that stuff ?
what did he use for that ?
there are all sorts of different tools and Taylor &-um &~ge illustrates them actually .
he shows you all the different tools in his book and how it's handled .
but you know you realize that you hafta have this incredible combination of strength and delicacy .
you know what I mean ?
you've gotta have the kind of &-um the the the attention to &~det you hafta have the attention to detail that you saw in that Durer engraving but the power you know <of a> <of a> of a you know +/.
a bull ?
+, a heavy laborer I mean someone who's doing things like breaking up stones in the sidewalk it's really really difficult work .
&-um so (0.5) &-um once you get into this stage &-um what happens is that your tools get <smaller and> smaller and finally at the end you're working with a kind of abrasive like a pumice stone or a sandpaper or something like that getting things down to polish level .
so it is really +//.
I but I think it's incredibly exciting because you can get &-um you get a real sense of how Michelangelo worked how Michelangelo worked at something .
okay .
so be sure to take a look at the Taylor section on tools on the various tools and imagine them being used on this stuff .
lemme show you some more &~Michelangel unfinished Michelangelo sculptures .
(0.15) here's another one in this same series +...
and this is nice because it's in color .
(0.13) .
doesn't look like Michelangelo .
xxx Michelangelo .
why was this left unfinished ?
what ?
did he die or ?
same &~reas it was left unfinished for the same reason .
was it just unrealistic ?
what ?
it doesn't look like his regular stuff .
this was going to be for the tomb of &-um Julius yeah .
yeah that's cool .
some of these were calculated okay &-um but but Julius did not want to &-um Julius decide or decided that he would abandon work on the tomb for a while and he set Michelangelo to painting the Sistine ceiling .
Michelangelo really wanted to finish this thing .
he likes carving much better than painting but he got stuck for forty eight doing the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .
so here again you can get it can you see the detail here ?
mhm +/.
+, here's the detail of a head and you can really see that kind of fine chipping away +...
Michelangelo said that <he when> he when he looked at blocks of stone he really &-um he hadta choose a block of stone and then discover the figure inside of it .
but these guys didn't get discovered .
or they kinda got half discovered .
you can see these if you go to Florence in Italy and see them they're at the Academia which is the sculpture one of the places where you can see sculpture in Florence .
okay let's look at a finished Michelangelo sculpture so that we can make the comparison between an unfinished and finished and see how refined his surfaces became .
(0.7) .
you know it's in Rome xxx .
hm no that wasn't what I was thinking of .
xxx .
this is &-um The Pieta of Michelangelo .
which is &-um spelled .
P I E T A .
and it's one of the standard subjects like the flagellation put .
do you know what that means ?
yes .
do you know what that means ?
I mean not &~th I mean do you know what that means ?
it means mercy .
yes it means mercy that's right or pity .
I just learned that yesterday .
let's see okay .
so it's the Pieta .
&=writes:board like that .
&-um and it's the moment after Christ is pulled down from the cross and his mother Mary cradles him in her arms cradles the body of the dead Christ .
I'm gonna give you a &~lon I'm gonna give you just I want you to see the whole sculpture before I show you a close up .
so you can see the the texture .
it's really gorgeous gorgeous work +...
Beth is that one in Florence also ?
that's true .
that is true .
yeah .
here's the face of the Virgin of the Virgin Mary and let's put it up against the face of the Boboli slave +...
so that you can see what the Boboli slave would've looked like if it had been finished .
now probably he wouldn't have had as refined a surface &-um <for a> for a a male slave figure as he does for the Virgin Mary but it would be pretty close .
but you can see now and what I'd like you to do is come up really close and <look at the> &-um look at the surface of this .
you can see that he's really gotten to the point where &~i you you almost can't see it but if you get in close you can see you can still see the texture you can see the tools at work .
from a distance it's hard for you to see but if you come up close you can see that &-um but you can also see the incredible detail that he gets .
look at her when you get up here look at the eyelids they're really extraordinary .
look at the &-um the fold in the lip look at the bones underneath the &-um the neck and the collarbone where he gives you the suggestion of of bones underneath the flesh look at the folds of the cloak around her how with and remember this is marble right ?
this is material that's like this where you really to you're &~sti you know you're still working really hard &-um and yet he gets a sense of cloth the texture of cloth the folds of the cloth it's really a stunning performance .
this is like you know this is like Durer on the Melancholia this is really an amazing guy .
&-um who's not a bad painter too .
so why don't you come on up and again take get in real &~clo I mean stand on the side don't stand in front of the light but so that you can see &-um the the texture because <it's there> it's there you can see the stone there +...
I know she's gonna xxx .
xxx .
what is that ?
and then compare it with this .
xxx what happens ?
can you see it if you don't yeah don't stand in front of the light .
that's okay you just have to stand to the side if you can .
right .
right .
can you see what I'm talking about it ?
this &-um can you see the &~c actually I can even see it from here but you kinda have to get in there .
I'd go sit on the floor over xxx +/.
+, yeah get in there on the floor and you can see it .
do you see that the the striations there on the face ?
and that's not just the screen ?
yeah are you sure that's not just the screen ?
yeah .
no it's not the screen .
maybe it's the &~f photo .
it could be the photo but I don't think so .
(be)cause look they they're different .
you know what I mean ?
they're slightly different .
but look how he suggests her eyebrows +/.
+, and then her forehead .
why is there a line xxx .
I think that's supposed to be the a band a suggestion of a &-um a band &=laughs around her head .
oh okay .
that's not gonna be good .
is there a graph on the end ?
no .
then that's just the &~s .
yeah that's the skull .
now do you notice what happened with the Pieta &-uh &-um not long well not long &~a probably a long time ago now eight ten years ago ?
someone walked into Saint Peter's where it is now in the Vatican &-um and had a hammer +/.
ooh no .
+, and and smashed the foot .
I mean at least it was up &~i <on a> on a pedestal so that he couldn't she wasn't xxx .
why ?
I don't know .
people are stupid and do things like that .
just the foot ?
⌈ (be)cause when you see things that are beautiful you have an inherent desire to destroy them ⌉ .
⌊ so now this is very &-um it's very difficult to &-uh ⌋ it's difficult to get close to they now have a big kind of bulletproof box around it .
xxx beautiful people .
xxx you know ?
some people are like psycho you know ?
yeah it is psycho .
so (0.11) we'll give you some more details so that you can see &-um how &-um how refined and detailed and suggestive you can get in sculpture .
this is the head of Christ (0.4) .
looks like a swashbuckler .
and again notice the area around the neck and this time take a look <at the> &-um at the hair .
the detail in the hair and again the eyebrows and Christ has a little goatee +...
you know get &~i in even closer here's the left hand of the Virgin +...
and there you can see the joint to a &-um there is a part that he hadta kind of &-um solder on I &~don not solder on I don't know how they did it they probably had some kind_of a strut ⌈ an iron strut ⌉ .
⌊ I think they &-uh they drill ⌋ .
a piece of metal .
they drill a ⌈ hole into it ⌉ .
⌊ a strut yeah .
yeah and then stick it in ⌋ .
⌈ and then there's a metal ⌉ rod and &~s sorta stick it on .
is that the only piece that one thumb is the only piece that ⌊ <was an unusual block> ⌋ ?
⌈ I think there are other places ⌉ .
I think there are other places but but I mean look at &~wha the other &~thin this what's so extraordinary about that hand is &-um how alive it is you know and then take a look at the pads of flesh on the palm it's really amazing <and the> &~j and the joints underneath the thumb <and the> &~thum and the fingernails .
it's really an extraordinary achievement and the wrist how the wrist &-um the delicacy of the wrist and how he suggests the veins <and the> and the &-um the small bones of the wrist underneath it .
it's really amazing .
is that Mary's hand ?
yeah that's the Virgin's hand that's Mary's hand .
(be)cause the it's a nice hand but the thumb is kind_of masculine .
maybe I'm just crazy .
⌊ no it's ⌋ .
⌈ <it looks pretty> it looks pretty big ⌉ .
⌊ no ⌋ it is big .
she's a big lady .
she's not that big .
yeah well she hasta &~ha she's got she's taken +/.
yeah +/.
+, this is a big guy in her lap but &=laughs .
but that one thumb is kind_of anachronistic xxx .
well I think all the fingers look kind of big .
really ?
well maybe .
yeah well I mean I'm not .
there's like a callous on her thumb ?
you know I got big hands .
wait what do you mean that the ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ is that a callous ⌋ on her thumb or is that the bone ?
no but do <you see that> you see that ridge ?
kind_of ?
show me on the slide just get up and show me on the .
you're right .
<he shouldn't have> he shouldn't have finished this .
&=laughs:SUm xxx started over .
see ?
it's a reflection .
he should've started all over .
I think it's a reflection .
it looks like a reflection .
⌈ he should have ⌉ +/.
⌊ piece of crap ⌋ +/.
+, never finished this one either .
nah this wasn't very good .
we'll send a letter to the Vatican .
we'll send a letter to the Vatican .
&-um and and the other thing that you have to understand too is that Michelangelo did &~s like well most of the Renaissance artists study anatomy he studied anatomy by dissecting corpses &-um and so <he knew> &-um he knew very well what was underneath the flesh and he works very hard to represent that .
it's quite &~ana what's what what it's analogous to is &-um you know when when Berger talks about the rise of illusionism again with with oil painting and people tried very hard artists tried very hard to to create the textures of things and the the &-um exact color of things and deep space a real illusion of of the real world on the surface on the canvas .
&-um here Michelangelo is attempting to do that same kind of mimicking but in sculpture .
and he develops all sorts of techniques to do it .
he's someone who brings it along in an incredible way I mean he's really a a a person who begins to &-um kind_of explain in stone what the human body is is all about .
so (0.8) anyway the texture of marble is really special in that you can &-um if you're good at it you can really mimic those effects .
&-um but it still has a quality that's all its own .
&-um you can kinda feel the coldness of it &-um in a way .
&-um you can get a very highly polished surface .
I wanna show you another &-um subtractive work by a Renaissance artist that's done not in marble but in stone .
I'm sorry not in marble but in wood .
(0.8) and here it is .
this is &-um Mary Magdalene .
ooh .
that is gross .
⌈ ooh .
God dang ⌉ .
⌊ another Christian ⌋ figure .
⌈ she looks like zombie ⌉ .
⌊ does anyone &~d ⌋ anybody wanna explain who Mary Magdalene is ?
does anybody know who Mary Magdalene is ?
she's a .
prostitute .
she's a whore .
yeah .
that Christ redeemed .
tell tell the story someone .
she washed Jesus' feet with her hair .
and then with her tears .
she was what ?
and her tears .
she was a she was like a you know like a dirty old prostitute and &-uh .
a very old prostitute ?
well that's not what I said .
I don't think she was an old prostitute when ⌈ she met him ⌉ .
⌊ xxx ⌋ .
what ?
she just saw Jesus and wanted to be redeemed and cried and washed his &~f his feet with her tears and her hair .
and he redeemed her .
alright .
+, ⌈ she repented ⌉ .
⌊ so she's ⌋ she's the prostitute that that &-um Mary that that's why she has long hair .
and she the so anyway she is the she's the prostitute who becomes a saint &-um through &-uh contact with Christ and through a long period of repentance in the wilderness and what you see is Donatello's image of Mary Magdalene after her years of &~rependan repentance .
and he uses not marble but wood so that he can get a kind_of a craggy quality that you can't get with sculpture .
let's see if I can .
did Michelangelo do any wood sculptures ?
what ?
I don't know .
I don't know .
there they did discover a wooden cross that some people claimed was by Michelangelo but I don't know .
I mean I don't know of any one that's kind_of standard you know what I mean ?
we just don't know +...
there are a_lot_of works that like there are a_lot_of Renaissance works that are lost .
that we just don't know anything about .
⌈ do you know <where she lives> ⌉ ?
she's gonna give me nightmares .
⌊ lemme ⌋ shut this down so you can see this better .
⌈ doesn't she look kind of undead ⌉ ?
⌊ yes definitely .
xxx eyes or lack of ⌋ .
⌈ and what you can see here ⌉ ⌊ especially if you look at the eyes the hollow of the eyes ⌋ <and the> &-um and the way the skin .
⌈ looks like she stood ⌉ up out_of a swamp .
is depicted .
and the way her hair she's wearing a hair shirt in addition to her hair to her long hair .
but that can you see how the texture of the wood really affects the quality of the sculpture the kind of effect of the sculpture .
the arm is so bizarre .
⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ so you really need when you're writing about sculpture ⌉ and when you're doing sculptural analysis you have to take into &-um account the medium .
okay let's take a look now at the additive process which is totally different it's take a look .
&-um the additive process actually begins to to get used &-um really becomes popular .
what did she say was popular ?
⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ alright .
sorry ⌉ .
<in the> in the nineteenth century although there were lots there were lots_of additive sculptures sculptures before that .
but I'm gonna show you the example an example from the nineteenth century (0.17) take the xxx this is by the nineteenth century sculptor Rodin R O D I N (0.4) and let's talk a little bit about how this demonstrates &~a the additive process .
first of all you start &-um by not taking away but by what's called modelling .
&-um you add to rather than take away you use malleable plastic material such as clay wax or plasticine which is clay mixed with wax and mineral oil &-um and that allows the artist really great freedom in building up and modifying the form .
modelling is a_lot is really in some ways analogous to oil painting .
you &-uh have a chance to fuss around with it you can change it you can you know you can <you've got> you've got time to work with this stuff &-um and mold it .
&-um it takes another kind of strength but it doesn't have it doesn't you know one thing about the modelling process actually I'll ask you if you can figure this out .
one what is the difference between the tools that you would use for modelling and the tools that you would use for carving and how does that affect how the artist does things ?
what do you get to do when you model ?
you've all modeled clay right ?
yeah .
using softer tools .
yeah <you use> you use well use softer tools what what +/.
hands +/.
+, what's your main tool in the beginning ?
your hands .
hands .
your hands yeah .
and that makes a huge difference .
the hands and what the hands &-um can do in fact if you look closely on this you can actually see the way you can on some oil painting when we looked at the Monet you can see the hands of the artist imprinted in what used to be the clay and let's see if we can ⌊ get you to come up close ⌋ .
⌈ like around the right eye it looks ⌉ like +/.
yeah you can +/.
+, the right eye and cheek .
yeah you can see you know you can see him doing something like that .
why don't you come up close closer ?
or look at the lip there's another place where you can kind_of see so guys come on +...
get in there .
you stay there and sit +...
do you see xxx .
yes .
&=laughs:multiple .
can you see him just taking his thumb and doing some of those things ?
or his little finger ?
&=laughs:multiple pressing it down can you see ?
and can you see the things that are added on ?
like &-um a beard yeah the beard and the hair you can see little patches of things that are just were kind_of placed on .
and you can see the like that for the (0.6) or I'll put another book here guys go up there .
do we just sit here ?
yeah just stay there if you want .
just &~g actually why don't you ⌊ just stay there ⌋ ?
⌈ just chill here on the floor right here ⌉ .
you know what you could sit on the floor if you want to move the table .
does anybody wanna move the table ?
what &~do it's not I don't think it's a problem .
it isn't ?
okay xxx just sit up here and don't go back .
isn't this like sitting too close to the television screen .
no it isn't .
&=background_conversation lemme show you another one .
(0.9) &=laughs:multiple okay so what happens is that you get this clay wax or plasticine and you make this &-um figure in clay alright ?
and the hands themselves are the primary tool right ?
for big works like this one this is &-um a portrait of Balzac B A L Z A K Z A C the &~scul the &-uh sorry the writer the nineteenth century writer by Rodin .
and for big things like this you need what's called an armature should I spell that for you ?
A R M A T U R E an armature which means that you have some kind_of a support system on which you can build the clay and lemme show you I'll show you an armature here .
here's a sculpture that you &~co where you actually can see the armature .
there .
this is a sculpture by Degas which is Degas the French impressionist painter which never got finished but you can see that he had &-um that he was building up his clay around this armature .
do you see that ?
and then there's the the strut .
so he would've had one &-um he would've had <one in the leg and> one in the leg and this would've probably had an armature as well .
so <would he> <would he> &-uh would he have have ended up cutting that hole that's sticking into her hip away ?
I think so but it looks like &~sh it's the it's at the point where +/.
⌊ Beth xxx ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ where he certainly couldn't ⌉ .
what ?
oh &~n nothing nothing .
I was just it's a big mean cat .
that is a big mean cat .
⌊ oh_my_god I didn't see that xxx that's vicious ⌋ .
⌈ but see you can see the thing is that that you have to make the sculpture ⌉ so it can be free standing .
that's a kind_of a problem .
you've gotta get it balanced right .
so the armature helps .
I mean I likely he would have it cut away .
what's going on behind it ?
what's that white stuff ?
oh I think it's the slide .
don't you think ?
I don't know I'm not sure .
yeah it looks like it's xxx .
I think it's the slide .
it's glue +/.
+, but can you also see on the Degas the the &-um the kind &-um of fingerprints of the artist ?
on the Degas this one ?
yeah on the Degas The Dancer .
you can see the fingerprints of the artist and how he's ⌊ molding ⌋ .
⌈ what is ⌉ that medium there ?
is that clay ?
what ?
no this is actually bronze .
we're gonna talk about it .
what happens is that the clay of_course isn't gonna last right ?
so you have to cast it you have to do something with it and I'll show something in just a minute wait .
aren't almost all these hollow ?
hollow ?
a ⌊ bronze ⌋ ?
⌈ yeah shouldn't ⌉ they be hollowed so that .
yeah you have to hollow it so it doesn't blow up .
yeah .
yeah .
the bronze .
now this isn't .
this is not bronze this is plaster and we're &~gon I'll let me explain that that how that works .
I'll be damned if that's hollow .
you're a wise guy .
that thing's massive .
xxx .
why there could be like a wire frame underneath .
xxx .
okay .
so the &~fa <after you've modeled the> &-um after you've modeled the wax or the whatever it is the clay you're gonna do .
the next thing that you do is you're gonna cast the sculpture in plaster .
that's the first step .
and that's what you're seeing up on the board on the board on the screen over on the right +...
so it's and the plaster cast &-um is going to be used to make the final work in bronze .
a plaster cast is a_lot more durable and easier to handle than clay or wax .
so what happens is that when the clay or wax or plasticine model is ready plaster of Paris is used to form a mold the mold is then cast in bronze or some other durable material .
so what you're seeing there is the plaster mold on the right side or left side .
where where ?
+, on your your &~ri left .
you're seeing the plaster mold that Rodin used to cast &-uh his final bronze project his final bronze sculpture .
so and you know what casting is .
do you know what casting is ?
+, mhm +/.
+, Taylor explains it it's you give shape to a substance by pouring in in a liquid or plastic form into a mold and letting it harden .
so molten bronze is poured <into this> into this mold and then it's left to harden and then the plaster is chipped away and you have &-um <you have your> you have your sculpture .
so lemme show you the the finished product here .
this is stupid &=laughs:multiple .
get over the cat .
I don't see the cat .
show me the cat .
I see the cat .
⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ yeah ⌉ xxx .
show me the cat .
little funny nose of cat mouth of cat chin is open +/.
⌊ he's smiling ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ that's like little ⌉ eye of cat .
that's a smile ?
I see a totally ⌊ different cat ⌋ .
⌈ I don't know ⌉ .
xxx ⌊ there's multiple cats ⌋ .
⌈ okay here's the final product in bronze ⌉ .
looks pretty hungry to me .
man that's the ⌊ ugliest thing ⌋ .
⌈ does anybody know where this is ⌉ ?
oh that's bad .
yeah <it just looks> really awful .
is that that in +/.
guys +/.
+, Amsterdam ?
does anybody know where this is ?
Amsterdam .
no .
Germany .
nope .
no .
not Michigan .
no not Michigan .
do you recognize you don't recognize the background ?
is it New York ?
yes .
&=singing and that brings up the next thing that you have to consider with sculpture .
you not only have to consider that sculpture is three dimensional and that you have to go all around it but the other thing that you have to consider about sculpture is site .
the site of it where is it ?
because the site makes a huge difference in the impact of the sculpture .
this is the Balzac &-um cast bronze Balzac in New York .
&-um in the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art .
and what's around him makes him look &-um I don't know rather heroic I think .
or like a very &-um eccentric sight seer .
&-um .
well see in the picture on the left it's such an ugly sculpture .
yeah ?
+, while in the picture on the right compared to like the drab skyline and like the the scraggly trees +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, it doesn't look quite so so terrible .
okay .
how how tall is this ?
how tall is this ?
life size .
a little bit more than life size actually .
now <the thing> the thing of how the &-um casting is that you can actually cast a whole bunch of things .
I mean you can once <you've got> you've got a mold you can cast a whole number of things .
and so there're more than one bronze Balzacs all around +/.
ah +/.
+, there's one in Paris in the middle of &-uh in at the Place_De_La_Republique .
there's one &-um on the terrace of Rodin's old house and I'm gonna show that to you oops I just dropped this .
(0.19) .
I can't see the cat .
I can't describe it to you .
it's okay .
it's scary .
well there's two cats .
yeah there are two cats .
I see another cat that's facing the other direction .
that's like .
that's like tuna &~o with on his cheek .
yeah that's the big scary cat .
I can't see .
whatever she's trying to find something .
oh .
guys you're like this is like camp .
I'm telling you &=laughs:multiple they should you know like a I oughta light a fire up there we could all sing songs .
&=laughs so there is &-um there's there's <there's the> &-um there's the Balzac sculpture standing overlooking the terrace of &-um .
Rodin's house ?
Rodin's house yeah in Meudon which is in in France M E U D O N so you can go visit it there too .
in addition to the Sculpture Garden .
so site is really important .
and site participates in what comes to be the iconography of the sculpture .
I'm gonna ask you now a question .
do any of you know the &-um I don't have a slide of it but <do any> do any of you know the sculpture that's on the grounds of Rackham ?
sorry ?
+, of the Rackham Grad School ?
the thing the &~fre the one on the building on the side ?
no .
well yeah the one on the side .
the Holocaust one ?
the Holocaust one .
right .
yeah +/.
+, do you know the Holocaust one ?
yeah .
yeah .
+, where he's holding his hand ?
yeah where he's holding his hand so <it's a> <it's a> it's a monument to the Holocaust and it's on the grounds of Rackham .
now why why do you think that site was chosen ?
was Rackham Jewish ?
no .
&-uh (0.5) .
where is it ?
next to Rackham +/.
⌊ it's on the grounds of Rackham ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ across the street from the Power Center ⌉ .
the <Rackham Center> .
oh okay (0.5) .
why would they put it there ?
most people would see it .
it's a nice place for a cemetery .
space .
&-um so a high viewing ⌊ like xxx ⌋ .
⌈ (be)cause like ⌉ the garden that it's in is &-uh I don't know .
something to do with the garden ?
mhm .
think .
light ?
no .
well &~part I mean partly .
think of what what what do you think that ground what do you think that ground could've been ?
dirt .
dirt is good .
&-uh maybe it was &-uh well you know East Quad was used for by the army during World War Two for Japanese language training so maybe they did something over there <the army> .
could be yeah that could be .
⌊ that could be ⌋ .
⌈ was it a grave ⌉ ?
what about ground though ?
think about ground .
are there people ⌊ buried there ⌋ ?
⌈ maybe I'm ⌉ maybe I'm not giving you enough hints .
what ?
was it a grave ?
like yeah graves like a burial ground .
what ?
and flowers grow up out_of graves .
that's not mean you can't just bury people wherever you want .
<what kind_of a> &~gr what kind_of a graveyard do you think it would be have been ?
unmarked ?
is it a mass grave ?
no .
&=laughs:multiple no they didn't have .
they just found it and they're like ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ well we killed all those Indians ⌉ .
⌊ not that I ⌋ know of +...
what kind_of a cemetery might it have been ?
a Jewish cemetery ?
excellent .
it was a Jewish cemetery ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
it's the old Jewish &~ceme it's the site of the old &~Jew &=background_conversation it's the site of the old Jewish cemetery in Ann Arbor .
okay .
okay so +/.
weird +/.
+, what happened to the bodies ?
what ?
⌈ are they still there ⌉ ?
⌊ are they still there ⌋ ?
&~wh say that again .
did they move the bodies or are they still there ?
they just like took out the graves or something ?
I don't I really don't know .
I think it's built over I mean &~y all well you know I think xxx .
&~tha that's the kind of information like you could go your whole life without knowing .
&=laughs .
that's true .
but now once I tell you that though <doesn't that> doesn't that affect your perception of the sculpture or no ?
or when you walk past the sculpture are you not gonna feel different about it or no ?
actually probably .
yeah I'll probably feel different about it and .
I don't think I will .
&=laughs .
okay .
what ?
what did Zack say ?
no because it's in either case it's still a chilling reminder of tragedy .
yeah +/.
+, grave or or +...
I mean because it's &~kin in a way it's kind_of a tombstone +/.
+, yeah .
+, for Raoul Wallenberg .
yeah .
yeah it's a and that's the other connection too .
you wanna talk about that Raoul Wallenberg ?
hm ?
Raoul Wallenberg .
&-um I don't know briefly he was an architecture student at the University of Michigan from was it Hungary ?
I forget where but regardless he was from Europe ⌈ and his ⌉ .
⌊ I think it's Sweden ⌋ .
huh ?
wasn't it Sweden ?
it might've been Sweden I I completely can't ⌈ remember ⌉ .
⌊ yeah okay well ⌋ whatever .
anyways so &-um he was called back to Europe to be at some kind of administrative assistant in the embassy .
and he used that position to help funnel Jews out_of Europe into the United States .
yes .
+, and it's believed that he died in a &-uh Russian prison camp but they don't know .
yeah but he got thousands of Jews out .
all the Scandinavians were doing stuff like that the Swedish and the &-uh Finnish I think .
weren't they all smuggling Jews ?
they were taking (th)em in yeah and they were taking (th)em in ⌈ and hiding them ⌉ .
⌊ the Norwegians that's it ⌋ .
it was the Danish .
and the Danish .
and hiding them .
+, okay .
so <it's important to know> it's important to know when you're considering the meaning of a sculpture that is the iconography of a sculpture you need to &~n not only know what the sculpture is of or about but where it's placed and why it's placed there .
because usually there's a reason for why a sculpture is put in a certain place .
there's usually a pretty good reason for why .
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you a little &-um test case here +/.
+, ⌈ test ⌉ ?
+, &=laughs:multiple ⌊ I'm gonna give you some hints ⌋ and I &=laughs I'm gonna give you some hints about this okay ?
I'm gonna give you some hints about it and what I'm hoping to do is that if I give you I'm trying to give you just enough hints and show you just enough so that you can figure out what the site why the site is what it is .
+, okay .
+, okay ?
alright .
so what I'm gonna show you is if &~anybod this is a sculpture by an &~Ital an Italian it's done in the seventeenth century .
it is a sculpture for a fountain .
and the fountain is called the fountain of the four rivers .
so and it's in this place in Italy called the Piazza Navona .
Piazza Devona ?
Piazza Navona +/.
oh Navona .
+, I'm gonna put it on the board so that if you go there +//.
also there's this great restaurant right near it called the Tre Scalini and they serve these fabulous things called chocolate tartufo@s:ita .
Scalini .
are we supposed to be doing that ?
⌈ Scalini ⌉ .
⌊ it's really good ⌋ .
so I'll also put the restaurant down .
&~Navon oops &=writing:board the restaurant is Tre Scalini .
okay .
<so I'm gonna strip> to New York .
okay so lemme show you God this is gonna make a_lot_o(f) noise .
(0.14) okay here's a long view of this fountain called the fountain of the four rivers .
and this is just the piazza or plaza where it's located but take it in okay ?
oh I've seen that .
we're twins .
xxx .
no wait a minute .
yeah isn't that McDonald's right behind is that across the street from the Parthenon ?
okay so it's in this piazza and just notice can you just try to notice the buildings around it ?
and notice also that it is a fountain .
okay ?
oh yeah .
I haven't seen this one .
here's another view of the piazza .
I'm not sure I understand this xxx .
perversion .

sexual immortality (0.7) .
okay four major rivers of the world .
four rivers of the world are represented on this fountain .
here's the first one this is the Nile .
they're personifications of each of the rivers .
whoa that's awesome .
this is Nile .
okay ?
(0.4) then you have hold on (0.7) .

yeah seriously .
yup .
this is the Ganges .
