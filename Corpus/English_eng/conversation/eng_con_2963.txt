so let's make sure we identify that what we're going to do today is discuss and write . 225_5325
which one came first ? 5685_6785
discuss . 7325_8565
discuss but you know, we're going to do first is the opposite . 8885_10705
write !
right ! 12145_12405
now this is a completely silent activity and I'm going to give you about two minutes to think about this . 12785_18725
this is an interesting question . 19205_20385
I'm not sure, really, what you think the answer is on this . 21225_24945
there are no right or wrong answers . 25225_27085
right now, it's just what you believe . 27255_29175
remember yesterday, we talked about fact and opinion . 30415_32915
right now, this is your opinion . 33655_34955
later on, we'll find the facts to either prove our opinion or disprove our opinion . 35875_40655
so here we go, boys and girls, get those pencils ready . 41095_43615
let's copy down this prompt: is, a, seed, double-E, alive ? 44335_59475
is a seed alive ? 61115_67395
how do you know ? 68235_69735
what's the proof that it is ? 70455_74195
xxx .
completely silent . 75135_76595
is a seed alive ? 77315_78375
think, think, think, think, think, think . 80335_83635
now, if you say yes or no, I want to know some evidence behind that . 83635_87935
what proof do you have ? 88175_89115
either it's alive or it's dead . 89515_90815
you need some proof . 91295_92055
all right, ladies and gentlemen, get those pencils . 92395_93555
this is a quick write, two minutes . 94395_95655
on your mark, is a seed alive ? 96095_97755
get set . 97835_98175
go .
just really quickly, as I walked around, I found it really interesting, a lot of you seem to have similar ideas but you may be on different ends of what we call a continuum . 99515_109815
a continuum is basically like a line . 110615_113395
it's like your synonym ladders . 114275_115915
you feel weak about something, or you feel really strong about something . 116755_120695
you can be anywhere on the continuum . 120915_122755
now, where I'm standing right here, this spot right here, if I imagine there's a line going from here all the way past xxx, almost all the way up to S_five . 123945_133405
this line right here, where it starts means seeds are absolutely dead . 133565_138585
there is no life to seeds, they are dead . 139165_141645
but then as you start moving up the continuum, well, I don't know . 141905_146585
maybe seeds might be kind of alive ? 147505_149925
maybe they need something . 150385_151445
you keep moving up the continuum . 152385_154045
no, no, no, I think seeds are more alive than they are dead . 155005_158165
you keep moving up the continuum, seeds are definitely alive ! 158625_165085
so, the end right there is dead . 165405_168185
the end right here is alive, completely alive . 168785_171445
anywhere in between, you might be in between . 171705_173765
I'm not sure if the seed's really alive or dead, so I'm going to go over here . 174445_177685
oh no, seeds are dead . 180025_180865
I'm going to go here . 181445_181985
well maybe if I add water they might grow ? 184265_185885
but I'm not sure . 186125_187405
nope . 188845_189025
seeds are alive, all the way here . 189165_192345
where would you be on this line ? 193265_196125
think about it, think about it . 198045_200605
xxx .
oh, have a seat, dear . 200805_203185
let's see how we do this . 203265_204305
we're going to start team by team . 204405_206245
let me see who's ready, who's ready ? 206325_207645
my first team, my first team that's ready . 207705_209185
let's start with team one . 209565_210705
all right .
team one, put yourself on the continuum from completely alive to completely dead or somewhere in between . 211145_216965
interesting . 219365_220025
how about team five ? 221305_222325
where would you put yourself on the continuum ? 222385_224045
this is completely dead . 225685_226925
that's completely alive . 227085_227945
you're a little far, xxx, xxx would be the end of the line . 228085_231025
so, if you agree with xxx completely live . 232365_234605
okay, team five, put yourself on the continuum . 234595_236335
where would you be ? 236635_237215
interesting . 239535_240875
all right, team three and team two, where would you be ? 241695_244455
oh my goodness . 245915_249895
I'm starting to see no one over here . 250035_252195
I think as a class, we have an idea . 252335_253675
how about teams four and team six . 254015_255875
where would you be ? 255955_256555
oh, oh, okay . 262145_262345
okay .
okay .
okay . 264085_264205
looking around right now . 264825_266685
what can you say as a generalization, that most of our class probably thinks about seeds ? 268405_274985
tell it to someone next to you . 275285_276265
xxx .
what do you think, xxx ? 280125_280825
completely alive ?
seeds are alive . 281005_284265
completely alive ? 284465_285005
oh, unless you cut them ? 285145_287645
xxx .
but look there's some people down there . 287965_289785
three, two, one, zip ! 293775_295635
if you can hear my voice, touch your nose . 295735_296935
point at someone who's talking . 297755_298735
show me that you're ready . 299955_300675
they are in the middle !
they are kind of in the middle . 301495_304175
xxx did something really interesting . 304455_305895
he saw some kids who were standing where he wasn't standing . 306455_309635
he's like, you know what ? 309775_310915
I'm going to find out why they're standing over there . 310935_312455
and he went and asked the question . 313115_315375
now that's what good scientists do . 315455_317135
he said he wasn't sure . 317235_318515
he wasn't sure . 318755_319755
so, he's kind of in the middle . 319855_320855
xxx .
shh, shh, good listeners . 323515_324175
yeah . 324475_325415
same thing . 326615_326875
they should be around here but not back here, that means they're dead . 327175_330895
do you think they're more dead than alive or are you just not sure ? 331535_334095
I think that, when the seeds grow they get more living because, I think the plant is inside the seed . 334235_340235
oh but the seed itself, we're not sure whether to call that alive or dead . 340755_344655
more like a shell . 344915_345075
I don't think it's really alive that much but like the inside part is more alive than dead . 347325_353005
it's this thing that it creates is alive, then it has to be alive because say, I just planted a seed . 353045_362285
here's my seed . 363005_363865
well, plant it in my hand, honey and we will do it that way . 365965_368605
okay . 370245_370725
it's planted . 370825_371005
now if you water it, it needs water . 371385_376685
and then it might grow, you're saying ? 378725_380505
and then it turns into a plant . 381205_382325
so, is that your evidence for it being alive ? 382325_384085
adding water makes it grow . 384165_385305
yes because if it creates a living thing then it has to be living . 385345_387865
huh ? 388265_388705
let me hang on to that, cutie . 388965_390545
I see some hands . 390805_391945
Ms .
xxx, who do you know, like in the book or something, made the seeds, in science, because at my old school we used to get to the parts where they have the seeds separate and it's the families ? 400285_415845
do you know how you would know if the families are together or are they separated families ? 416205_425605
you're talking about the families of seeds ? 425885_427905
yes . 428585_428885
we will be getting into that, S_six . 428905_430665
S_six, go ahead and pick a quiet hand to either to add on or maybe someone who disagrees with the concept . 430665_435325
boys usually try to pick girls . 436465_440185
girls usually try to pick boys . 440405_441645
that's S_seven and that's xxx . 442125_443645
one, two, three, pick ! 443885_450285
S_seven .
I also agree with +... 450365_453605
boys and girls, tracking the talk, your bodies are still . 454545_456525
xxx .
also, maybe it might not even grow, maybe it needs more things to grow except for water because maybe it needs sun and you're not, you're just giving it water . 458155_474035
you keep on giving it water and there's no sun there that it might not grow . 474275_478735
yeah . 479375_479455
but the thing that I mean, just say it's going to die . 479555_482415
you don't need a realia right now . 482435_484375
go ahead, use your words . 484495_484975
so when I said water specifically, I meant water and sun but I didn't really get to that part . 486825_499425
does that change it for you, S_seven, if there's water and sun ? 500325_504445
S_seven, pass it off . 504625_505905
I see some people agreeing and some people wanting to add on . 505985_508945
I wonder if anybody disagrees, I have the two boys on the end there . 509685_512745
xxx answer S_five's question because was it like how the seeds are made ? 515845_520985
well, a lot of people, they get two kinds of plants and then they make one kind of plant with both . 522025_531305
they create some formulas and other plants and stuff . 532065_537725
have you guys heard about that before ? 537985_539165
yeah, that's a really interesting thing . 539405_541285
now what I find interesting and let's go ahead and get back into our line, our continuum . 541505_545785
remember completely alive over here, not sure: probably in the middle, completely dead on the other side . 546465_551685
we still have a decent spread . 553145_556245
now boys and girls, show me you're listening . 556485_557745
square ourselves up . 558325_559945
S_four has an idea . 560425_561305
I think we need to talk amongst ourselves . 561425_563005
so the person right next to you, find out what they really think and why . 563465_567045
if someone's out of your group, if you see someone just standing there ? 567225_570845
what should you do ? 570925_571605
xxx .
I can't hear you . 572005_574365
xxx .
ask them, what is their question ? 574945_580125
what's their answer ? 581005_581725
be proactive . 581905_583025
like xxx what was like, why are they over there ? 583325_585865
I am interested ! 586065_587105
and he walked right over to ask them . 587525_589385
that's what I want to see . 589485_590325
so ladies and gentlemen, just in your groups right here, you need to talk to someone next to you . 590565_594265
brief conversation . 595055_595955
what do you believe about seeds ? 596355_597655
are they alive ? 597655_598215
are they dead or are they somewhere in between and why ? 598295_600455
go ! 600795_600935
xxx .
I believe seeds are alive because you need them to grow because xxx so they can grow up . 601395_613175
a living things gets bigger and bigger inside the seed and then it cracks . 613895_619495
so the seed is more than a container . 620825_623665
it's also part of the living thing . 624125_625725
yeah .
kind of . 627205_628325
I'm confused . 628785_629485
explain this to us . 629725_632045
if a thing can grow, it's pretty much living . 632265_635765
I mean, we're human . 637145_639465
oh !
give me an example that's something that doesn't grow that we know that isn't alive . 639685_642825
your coffee cup is not going to get bigger . 643145_646625
so this is not alive because it doesn't grow . 648705_652005
that would be nice . 653085_654685
it would be nice, wouldn't it ? 654785_655005
but that's beside the point . 655265_656645
xxx .
those aren't growing, the leaves . 657305_660285
they are coming off a plant that is growing . 661445_663545
so when I take a leaf off, is it dead ? 664285_666345
if you take a leaf off and put it in water, well, if you take it off it's pretty much dead but if it's on the plant +... 666685_676065
interesting . 677205_677305
is that watercress ? 677545_679365
these are water plants . 679805_680845
is it watercress ? 681205_682505
no, it's Elodea, I forget exactly what it's called . 682725_687285
so interesting, I want to find out what these boys are thinking . 687945_690505
oh, I like what's happening over here . 690745_692945
well what do you guys think because I like how you boys came over here . 693065_701445
I think it's alive because a human being grows . 701465_705465
like if it's dead, it doesn't grow . 706745_708565
you know, S_twelve said that too . 709105_710905
to grow, it has to be alive . 711505_716225
if it won't eat anything or drink anything, it would just stay the same height or probably die . 716585_721085
to be alive, it has to grow . 722305_728045
to be alive, it has to grow . 728685_730865
so something's not growing, it's probably not alive . 731345_734925
but a seed can grow . 735325_738105
well do seeds grow, if I just hold my seed in my hand it won't grow ? 740425_744225
no .
it has to have the components .
see, I'm starting to wonder now . 744605_751425
will it grow by itself ? 751785_754005
but then again, will we grow by ourselves ? 754385_756465
if we waited forever, it wouldn't grow . 758465_763285
it probably, would eventually break open and become a plant but the plant wouldn't really survive . 764165_772745
interesting . 773685_774065
back on our line in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, four, two . 774425_784785
hurry up xxx . 784965_785125
now, ladies and gentlemen, xxx . 787545_788685
still in our line, not in our seats . 789425_791405
we're starting to get a slight shift I've noticed . 793605_796785
I have a couple more people who are kind of moving down a little bit and then a whole bunch of people who went, all right, it's completely alive . 797185_804005
so now people are shifting even more . 804825_808665
where exactly do you fall ? 809105_810845
now, here's my question and if I could have all eyes on me in three, two, one . 813065_817925
now, we're in our scientist position . 818665_819745
are you ready ? 819905_820185
scientists are like this . 820445_821485
okay, scientists have a lot of knowledge . 823185_825305
they're ready to think . 825485_826165
they're relaxed but they're quick . 826305_828105
so you're in a comfortable position . 828565_830065
why did you change positions ? 830885_833145
what made some folks change their minds ? 833685_836725
what happened ? 837225_838385
xxx tracking the talker . 838785_839785
xxx, stand up, dear . 841185_841625
I kind of thought about it and it has to have things to grow, it has to have components . 842705_849145
it has to have water and you can't just say here, seed, grow . 849525_856185
it won't grow . 856725_857505
you have to water it . 857725_858505
you have to give it what it needs . 858585_860165
it has to have different components . 860325_861845
just like if I sat a baby right there, it wouldn't grow, it would have to have food and it would have to have other things . 861995_871115
xxx went from here to there, listen to S_twelve . 871535_875955
I disagree and agree the seed will probably break open and form a plant but the plant may not do as well as it could have with water and sun . 875955_889075
pass it off dear . 890955_891735
I see some disagree . 893155_894455
I see some agree . 894615_895175
some people want to add on . 895395_896195
good listeners . 896815_897315
I both agree and disagree with what xxx said because we need water and food stuff like that to stay alive . 898115_911735
it's like a plant would need that too . 916915_919415
so, it makes sense that it would need water and sun . 920135_924735
that's a good point too . 925215_927395
now ladies and gentlemen, remember their hand signals, hold them to yourself until they're done talking . 927515_931715
sometimes it's hard to concentrate when xxx, xxx you're making hand signals while someone is talking . 931855_937515
wait until they're done and then let them know, hey, I agree, I want to talk more . 937555_942955
I want to add onto what you're saying or I disagree . 942965_945285
that way the person speaking can pick the right person to either challenge the argument, which is the intellectual risk-taking-thing to do, I think that's the best thing to do, or to add on to what you're saying . 945765_957505
so, S_fourteen made a point where I'm going to paraphrase you . 957905_961325
tell me if you're right but still hold your hand signals . 961425_963505
S_fourteen said that it makes sense that living things need stuff to grow . 963925_967605
things can't just grow by themselves . 968005_969665
so, just like a seed . 970105_971525
yeah .
come on over, dear . 972565_973025
just like a seed, if we add soil and water that doesn't mean that it's not alive . 973345_977365
okay, so let's see who can add on or disagree . 978225_980925
I like how she's looking around . 985125_988145
well, I agree because a seed can't grow when it's just on the ground but when it grows up into a flower, it gets more sunlight . 989475_998235
but when it's a seed it doesn't really get that much water and sunlight . 998435_1002595
interesting . 1003335_1003795
now looking around, I would pick someone who either wants to add on or disagree . 1004035_1007635
I agree, xxx because we are alive when we're born but we still need food and water, like seeds need sun and water because everyone needs some things to be able to live because we can't live without food and water . 1010205_1032045
wow . 1033745_1034005
pass that off, S_sixteen . 1034145_1035005
wow . 1035205_1040045
that changes how I'm thinking about it now, because I was with you . 1037445_1039965
if we have the seed inside the xxx thing inside the seed, it's keeping on growing and growing . 1040465_1049285
if it's growing, it's alive . 1049565_1052685
so, that's what helps the seed crack so it can continue growing . 1052945_1056845
if the seed never cracked, it will stay where it is and may never grow . 1057565_1061505
what about a seed ? 1061845_1064125
because I have a whole bunch of seeds in my cupboard at home that I've had for years and they're not growing . 1064685_1069605
it depends on the +... 1070705_1071705
they're in a bag in my cupboard . 1072785_1074185
do they need something ? 1074325_1080185
so are those seeds in my bag alive or dead ? 1080345_1086365
what do you think over here ? 1086585_1090745
are they alive or dead ? 1090825_1091605
the seeds of my bag . 1091765_1092405
xxx .
all right ladies and gentlemen . 1099685_1100365
hear my voice, clap two times, clap three times, clap two times . 1100725_1105445
ready, scientist pose . 1108825_1110085
so, in thinking about our science, whether seeds are alive or dead . 1111305_1115485
I want you to think about those seeds I have in my cupboard at home in a bag that are not growing . 1115685_1120905
go back to your seats and tell me if those seeds are alive or dead and why, go . 1121605_1126185
