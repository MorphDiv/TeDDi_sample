copy flip copy copy . 8700_10070
you just three more than six strips . 12440_14260
I mean &-um copy copy flip flip copy copy . 15360_19910
copy copy flip flip copy . 21590_25500
copy . 26260_26430
yep . 27220_27350
let's see . 28530_29060
okay . 29550_29780
so here after we did the copy copy . 29860_31530
and then we put the flip next_to what . 33020_34100
we got these green diamonds here . 34250_35630
and then we did copy . 35820_36890
happy kiss like me . 37210_38660
and have these look like house shapes . 38680_40890
they do look like house shapes . 41920_43110
so you get the house shapes . 43980_45230
and then you get kind of diamonds and squares . 45860_47740
and then you get house shapes diamonds and squares . 47760_50300
house shapes . 50870_51470
and . 51520_54450
then the half squares . 51600_52910
mhm . 53320_53450
very nice . 54710_55260
two ladies know what your next step is . 55780_57390
yeah . 58110_58170
but am Amanda is . 58400_59230
oh okay . 60890_61200
she's still filling . 61370_62020
in this . 62060_62300
what could you . 62950_63490
start doing while she's finishing &-um . 63560_65510
the plan for the finished book . 65780_66990
&-um start cutting this . 67220_68810
mhm . 69220_69380
big pile . 70110_70380
of right there . 70560_70990
so once . 71900_72140
you need to make the strips . 72160_73160
Kelly get it all done . 73460_74260
let's . 74410_74530
walk them . 74920_75170
strips that came from . 83460_84540
Core Square one . 85150_86710
two . 87220_87390
three four . 88130_88850
okay . 90300_90430
and there's that checker . 90660_91950
I could make one . 92400_92910
oh . 93940_93980
that's okay . 94400_94780
four is all the different ones that you needed to see . 94910_97100
now which one of these strips do you think . 97260_100060
will make . 101350_102840
the best design for a finished quilt . 103420_105980
which one of these designs are you leaning toward right now . 106330_108670
which strip . 108790_109140
do you like that one . 109600_111350
what do you like about that one . 111750_113190
it has like red squares . 114540_117100
and some of them just have like &-um some red squares and some
well yeah . 129470_129740
the same number of red squares in every strip . 129759_132220
right . 132390_132580
because each of your core squares has how many red squares in it .
if I put your core square by itself . 136780_138430
one one . 138620_139350
so every one of your strips has how many red squares . 139820_142550
one . 143380_143550
every one of your strips . 144440_145420
four &-um six mhm . 147010_151360
because how many core squares did you use to make every strip . 155710_158740
six . 159060_159230
six six core squares to make every strip . 159860_161620
so if this core square you designed has one red square every one of
six . 169140_169270
okay . 169830_170100
let's see if that's true . 170130_170950
one two three four five six . 172020_175720
Astro pet six . 176410_177180
squares . 177200_177430
how_about how many red squares are in this strip . 177860_180340
here . 180450_180590
one two three four six . 183520_188420
okay . 189390_189630
what_about in this strip . 189950_191420
one two three four five six . 192980_195310
what_about in this strip . 195630_196580
one two three four . 198300_201100
okay . 203830_204100
so they all have six red squares . 204300_206420
how many green squares do you think are in every strip . 207620_210500
six .
why do . 211620_211780
how'd you figure that out so quickly . 212130_213020
'cause okay . 215220_215360
one one &-um course . 216660_218870
where is has at_least one red square . 219210_223860
then when you put &-um five there's like one or one green square
and you put (th)em together . 238920_239990
and it equals six of each . 240180_241950
okay . 242600_242740
and all your strips used the same number of four squares . 242760_245350
right . 245400_245800
that equals twelve . 245590_246990
putting the red square twelve . 247870_248950
right . 249000_249180
twelve squares . 249470_250030
mhm . 250180_250440
but six red ones in six green ones . 250680_252710
so when I first asked <you what> you what was making you think
you said . 259839_260110
well it has like more red and green squares . 260160_261829
does it have more red and green squares than any of the other
no . 264540_264700
so take another look at it and think what could it be about that
what do you like about that strip . 273320_275060
it goes flip turns flip . 276060_279020
no flip . 279340_280620
no copy four flip is . 281420_283720
oh . 284380_284500
wait . 284600_284830
that's okay . 285040_285460
we have to . 285510_285750
is this a copy of your four . 286140_287460
no . 287900_287960
flip . 288670_288910
let's see . 290490_290910
this is how your core originally started . 290960_293430
and this is . 294900_295470
okay . 298750_299020
well actually that does copy your core . 299040_300820
but in the position we had it laid down in . 300860_302820
that type core foot . 303710_305070
that core foot . 305830_306480
what . 306710_306890
kind of foot . 307000_307460
up down sideways foot . 308660_311500
we need a sideways foot . 311980_313030
this . 316190_316400
is a copy of your core for the first position . 316480_319180
but to get the second position . 319220_320520
let's put this . 320930_321390
one what do you have to do to get it looking like . 321460_323860
math . 324800_324910
what do you have to do to this . 326470_327500
does that do it . 330560_331220
no . 333860_333920
no . 334940_335110
let's see the turn . 336030_340280
turn . 345920_346450
so if we can't do it by flipping we must have to do it by turning .
how can we turn your core so that it looks like there . 351340_355620
this . 358110_358320
is how your core square starts . 358400_359630
and . 360010_360140
you want it to look like turn right and that x . 360160_366540
that's right . 366740_367260
the way you're turning it . 367340_368220
there is right . 368240_368650
'cause I can tell 'cause I watched which direction that little x
right . 371850_371950
two four try . 373280_374340
okay . 376310_376580
yep . 376890_377030
so turning right . 377460_378310
two fourths . 378620_379270
that is that position . 380190_381300
isn't it if I turn this right . 381320_382820
two fourths . 382980_383580
oh . 384860_385030
nope it's not . 385700_386340
wait . 387790_387940
that isn't is that the design we planned with the bow ties there .
&-um . 393100_393160
and the green up in the upper corner . 394400_395900
yes it's how_come that didn't work when I did it . 397660_400060
with this one . 400080_400630
oh it did . 403160_403590
I just didn't I just I must have turned . 403760_407350
it another way . 407400_408460
okay . 409470_409630
so the pattern you found is that you copied the core . 409950_411750
and then you turn it right . 412520_413380
one half you copy the core . 413420_415310
you turn it right . 416060_416740
one half on this . 416820_417870
one it was the flip . 417960_418800
side of it first . 419550_420620
but really you took the core and turned it to the right . 420880_423380
one half does our design still work out . 423460_425180
yep . 426700_426830
and then copy of the core . 427100_428220
and turn it right . 428820_429900
one half . 430310_430740
okay . 432510_432750
&-um . 433420_433480
so what makes you . 434740_435910
what do you like about this . 436070_437020
design for this strip . 437110_437920
you've just told me how it was made . 438120_439460
you did a_lot_of really good thinking just to explain that to me .
I know it's a copy of your . 442410_443300
core . 443470_443630
I like it when they when each strip has a copy for . 443680_447380
and then we have to try out another one . 448160_450630
and when we find out one then we sometimes me and Jim go flip
sometimes we go copy flip flip . 459150_462110
okay .
what . 464630_464820
&-um did you guys ever try a strip that was just a copy of your
no . 469380_469520
never did that . 470160_470740
why why not . 471180_472300
'cause it would like look each core grade would look the same . 474570_478860
and it went look that way . 478980_480420
because if I had it the way it was now then we would have to &-um
and then when we're done we would look at it . 497060_499940
and we would probably would look that . 499980_501710
well let's see . 503230_503630
let's put it . 504370_504660
together and see what it . 505120_505990
looks like . 506040_506340
okay . 513780_513900
Ashley and Vanessa what do . 514480_515590
you need . 515640_515789
oh . 516059_516210
yeah . 517230_517340
you both have your two-sided yeah . 517580_518970
okay . 519350_519490
more graph papers right over there on that shelf . 520270_522710
a big stack of it . 522960_523740
hmm . 524520_524570
look at that strip that we created from just copying this for each
do you see a strip like that on your graph paper . 529180_531110
I think so . 536360_536910
which one do you think it might be . 537090_538230
first one makes you think that it might be that one . 538410_540790
because I took these two . 541480_543700
and then these two together they looked as the one . 543860_548830
and . 549740_549870
okay . 551410_551550
there's red on kind of the bottom . 552510_556590
green on the top . 557370_558320
and then there's a red square . 559300_561020
mhm . 561300_561420
and then green square . 562180_564950
and then there's a red on the bottom . 565720_567030
and
