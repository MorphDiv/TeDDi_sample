than one operation . 0_1376
use the order of operations . 1376_4361
what does that mean ? 4361_5278
order of operations . 5278_8558
Alex ? 8558_9526
uh, says sub well take substitute words and change them into numbers . 9526_20303
well kind of, but I mean here . 20303_24555
do you remember back what order of operations means Jen ? 24555_27325
Pemdas . 27325_28171
what's that mean ? 28171_28921
parenthesis, exponent, multiplication, division and addition and subtraction . 28921_32995
very good . 32995_33795
and what's the saying that goes along with that ? 33795_35898
I know . 35898_36176
I know . 36176_36515
Jen ? 36515_38298
please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally . 38298_40138
Aubrey what's please mean ? 40138_41443
oh, parenthesis . 41443_43980
no, not actually please, but I mean parenthesis . 43980_46526
class . 46526_47605
excuse . 47605_49316
what's that mean ? 49316_50750
exponent . 50750_51803
my ? 51803_52388
multiplication . 52388_53860
dear ? 53860_54923
division . 54923_56188
aunt . 56188_57085
addition . 57085_58858
sally . 58858_60395
subtraction . 60395_61795
okay . 61795_62148
good . 62148_62586
so that's what we do here . 62586_64008
an example, evaluate one point five plus two n@l for n@l equals twelve . 64008_71176
how do I do that ? 71176_71993
Patrick ? 71993_74865
you do the multiplication first . 74865_78271
but put the you put twelve in for n@l and then you do the multiplication and then you add . 78271_83288
good . 83288_83768
Alex ? 83768_84320
or you could substitute n@l for twelve and put quotations around +... 84320_90591
parenthesis . 90591_91081
yeah, parenthesis around n@l twelve so you know how to do those first . 91081_94425
good . 94425_94926
Jen ? 94926_95671
what about for us in the example that says, uh, a number plus a negative three . 95671_101031
wouldn't you have to do something with those parenthesis though, 'cause that's the order of operations . 101031_105568
right . 105568_106735
so you would you would have to take it out of there . 106735_109406
so, next week we haven't gotten to this yet, but plus a negative, depending on what this is . 109406_114126
that's a good point . 114126_115086
yes . 115086_115440
Marcus ? 115440_116343
I have a question . 116343_117221
is that one point five ? 117221_119053
yes . 119053_119285
one point five plus two n@l . 119285_121880
so Patrick said put twelve n@l for n@l . 121880_126276
class what's two times twelve ? 126276_127748
twenty four . 127748_128598
plus one point five gives us twenty five point five . 128598_132540
is this all in our notes ? 132540_134268
yes, Brandon . 134268_135808

good . 199550_201830
page one_o_seven . 201830_202678
so we're going to write a variable and then explain what it is . 202678_207245
look at number seven . 207245_208935

what would a variable expression be ? 213005_216341
steve ? 216341_217876
like n@l +... 217876_223508
n@l minus negative six ? 223508_227463
no, just n@l minus six . 227463_228913
n@l minus six . 228913_229290
good . 229290_229665

three x@l . 260176_260936
no . 260936_263001
that would be multiply . 263001_264098
wouldn't it ? 264098_264553
think think about that one again . 264553_266601
plus x@l . 266601_267496
so what would it be ? 267496_268275
three plus x@l . 268275_269350
okay, good . 269350_270240

I'll tell you . 326550_327180
okay class, quiet please . 327180_332011
where do you think we use variable expressions in real life ? 332011_341645
Patrick ? 341645_344788
when you're trying to figure out all the problems . 344788_349278

uh +... 350891_353560
how many of you have science this semester ? 353560_356761
where do you use variable expressions in science ? 356761_360396
formulas . 360396_363678
steve ? 363678_365165
when you're trying to figure out like, how much something weighs . 365165_368668

please do a couple and then I'll have you pack up . 423251_428558
yes ? 428558_428980
for number one through sixteen, you don't have to write the answer ? 428980_431803
I'm not sure what you mean . 431803_435366
write a variable expression Oh . 435366_438093
it doesn't say evaluate . 438093_439591
oh yeah . 439591_439938
yeah, just write the expression . 439938_441171
there's an extra xxx . 441171_442515
could you pass it forward, John ? 442515_444453

thank you John . 445790_446476
Brandon ? 446476_448973
on, uh, on number one do you have to have do you have to put the number before you, uh, subtraction ? 448973_453990
no . 453990_454601
that one has to be accurate . 454601_455885
so like +... 455885_456765
so it would be like five subtract, uh, any number you any letter you want to ? 456765_461158
thank you . 461158_462578
yes . 462578_462923

yes . 463340_463771
yes ? 463771_464641
on number two it says, the absolute value do you have to put the lines in ? 464641_470436
what do you think ? 470436_471113
yes . 471113_471788
yes . 471788_472161
but do you like put an n@l ? 472161_473835
yeah . 473835_474370
you put it around n@l . 474370_475656
good question Michelle . 475656_476588
yes ? 476588_490908
for number five do you have to put two expressions because it says, uh, says three more than the product . 490908_497928
yes . 497928_498593
yes . 498593_499480
no, into one expression but use so three more than the product . 499480_505415
what would the product of eight and a number be ? 505415_507623
so wouldn't it be like x@l +... 507623_509065
well, use a times because that looks like a variable . 509065_511120
okay ? 511120_512385
so +... 512385_513103
What should I use ? 513103_514700
shh . 514700_515306
please John, please work . 515306_517005
so then eight n@l equals +... 517005_521250
no plus +... 521250_522031
plus +... 522031_522976
plus three, right ? 522976_523888
because that's three more than . 523888_525320
okay . 525320_527046
okay . 527046_527465
Marcus ? 527465_528263
I have a question on, like, number three . 528263_532305
okay, I'll be right there . 532305_533640
Josh what's your question ? 533640_534486
how do you solve this ? 534486_536941
what's the product of the number and negative eight ? 536941_539255
what does product mean ? 539255_540348
multiplication . 540348_541886
okay, so how would you do that ? 541886_542910
uh +... 542910_544151
I don't know . 544151_546301
what are you multiplying here ? 546301_547430
negative eight . 547430_549133
and ? 549133_549575
a number . 549575_550381
okay, so how would we do that ? 550381_552001
negative eight n@l . 552001_554021
good . 554021_554385
all right . 554385_554860
very good . 554860_555261

all right, I have no clue what to put first . 560268_563173
all right . 563173_563660
what does product mean ? 563660_564308
like the answer to a number . 564308_566615
what kind of operation . 566615_568131
