&~www .
last week I was in my room .
and I had a new pet frog .
and my dog liked it very much .
later I went to bed .
I had a nap .
and I left my frog on the floor .
uhhuh .
but &-um I didn't realize until I woke up but my frog had escaped .
so I started looking everywhere , in my boots , under my bed .
and even my dog put his head in the bowl .
but it got a bit stuck .
<I was calling it> his name was Freddie .
I was calling it all the time .
but he didn't come .
my dog was leaning out the window .
and he fell out .
and there was a bang .
he's smashed a glass .
so I picked him up .
but I was rather cross because he's just been a big pain !
so but so I held onto him .
and we went for a walk .
we were looking down the woodlands to see if if he was there
then my dog 0 just looking at all the bees in the air while I
and then I found a hole in the ground .
and I thought +"/.
+" oh he might be there .
so I was calling down it .
and suddenly this beaver type thing looked up .
and it bit my nose .
+< that's great .
my dog was jumping against the tree , looking at all the bees and
and then he knocked the bees' nest down .
and they started to to chase him .
I just ignored him though because he was being a pain .
so then I climbed up a tree and there was a hole .
so I was calling in the hole , calling Freddie .
but there was no reply or movement .
<so then I got down and hadta quick no> then a bird come
and it scared me .
and I fell back .
then a load of bees flew over my head , chasing my dog round the
then I gave up on that idea .
so I started climbing a rock rock , looking over and about to
but there was no luck still .
and suddenly I lent right over , leaning on a tree .
well I thought it was a tree , until this big deer caught me and
+< uhhuh .
and my dog was chasing in front of it , trying to stop it .
but that didn't work .
suddenly the deer made a sudden stop at the end of like a steep
and me and my dog went flying off .
so then we fell in this big pond with lilies and everything .
I sat with my dog on my head .
and I heard something .
I lent behind a log , telling the dog to be quiet .
and then on the count of three , we lent over .
and I saw a group of frogs .
there was <big one> two big ones and lots_of little ones .
then suddenly my frog Freddie come and jumped at me .
it jumped into my hand .
and then me and my dog set off and waved goodbye to the other frogs
