my father wasn't really around to be honest .

&-um I grew up a mama's boy .
&-um as but as you know, she kept me in church .
&-uh my mom was a single parent &+f so for a long time all I knew was my mom .
my mom was my mom and my dad „ you_know .
know what I'm saying, she's a very strong woman .
mhm .
&-um she she raised me, I feel like, the best way she could at the time .
I don't know exactly what age she had me at, but she did have me at a young age .
mhm .
&-um you_know so ‡ now pretty_much I grew up like I said .
she did whatever she hadta do to put food on the table .
nothing illegal „ you_know .
but she just worked really really hard .
so ‡ my work ethic definitely comes from my mom .
+< mm okay .
&-um you_know ‡ the way I treat a woman .
things of that nature .
you_know ‡ I &+g I those are the little nuggets I got from my mom, coming up .
+< mm mm .
so ‡ we're pretty close, to answer your question .

&-uh my dad's mom, I definitely had a relationship prior to her passing as_well .

+< &-um considering me and my brother grew up in two different households, &-um I can't really answer that question you_know effectively .
+< mhm okay .
mhm .
you_know .

nah ‡ I definitely understand that .
what_about &-um aunts and uncles, cousins ?
&-um I_mean ‡ we were all pretty close coming up .
&-um <I was> funny thing is I was probably more closer to my dad's side of the family than I was my mom's side .
mhm .
you_know ‡ but but <you know> &-um you_know we allow life to be life „ you_know hm .
and <I just> I pretty_much dealt with &+wha what was given to me .

I guess like$co we can say just maybe high school, middle schoolish .
mm .
two of the best years of my life „ mm .
the best years „ okay okay .
absolutely .
tell me about it .
&-um middle school, high school is kind_of when I came into who I was .
&-um .
okay .
I discovered music .
&-um I always grew up in church, grew up in music .
you_know ‡ everybody in my family &+pl played, preached, or they sung .
mhm .
so ‡ I was always around music .
&-um but I didn't really get into music until maybe seventh, eighth grade .
mhm .
&-uh right before middle school, &-um you_know middle school, high school wave .
&-um there was a teacher by the name of Mister_Redacted_name I'll never forget .
Mister_Redacted_name .
yeah ‡ Mister_Redacted_name &-uh Redacted_school now Redacted_school in &-uh off Redacted_address road in camp springs Maryland I believe .
mhm .
&-um he I I don't know what it was about him but he may &+s maybe saw something in me at a very young age .
because <I would come> &+t I promise you, I will <come to> &+cl come to school, go to home room .
mhm .
right after home room, I was in his class all day .
I would literally skip class .
mhm .
&-um I would do everything possible to just stay in his class all day til til it became a point where I was getting put out_of my scheduled classes and they would send me to Mister_Redacted_name because they knew that was the only place I would work you_know or do do what I hadta do .
+< mhm .
because I was so geek to play music at the time .
wow .
so ‡ he had a little beat-up drum set <in the &-um band room> in &-uh in the band closet .
I useta go in there, &-uh put pieces together .
it it may be like a actual bass drum that you play in the marching band and he'd have a drum pedal .
it might be a piece of a high hat stand .
&-um if not, I was using two cymbals and I would just put (th)em on like$co you_know cymbal stands little flimsy cheap-ass cymbal stands .
this little drum throne would be broke as fuck .
the snare would be broke as fuck .
and I would just sit there and make make rhythms .
&-um .
woah .
you know what I'm saying, to the point where he put me in the talent show .
and I I vaguely remember it, but you_know the few middle school friends I have talked to about it, they've they've reminded me .
they never forget the story so it must have been like$co a epic moment for me .
hey ‡ &+fu +/.
you know what I'm saying, at the time .
&+ha yeah .
and from there I just kind_of kept that mo@n through high school .
+< mm .
and I did the same thing in high school .
I &-um I &+f I <what is my> I forgot my high school &-uh music teacher's name, you know what I'm saying .
but I did the same thing „ man .
like ‡ the marching band would be in there practicing choral and orchestra music and I'm sitting in there .
I'm the only nigga playing the piano .
at this time I discovered I wanted to play piano, you know what I'm saying .
and then just started vibing out man and just I would sit there and just play .
I knew I wasn't gonna play their actual concert but I would just sit there and learn music and come up with different melodies and things .
man ‡ it just kind_of stuck with me &-um out_of high school and I realized I could make honest money doing it „ man .
I been doing it ever since .
ah ‡ that's what's up .
that's all the way what's up .
&-um so ‡ was there any other extracurricular activities you got into while you was in school ?
+< I played baseball for a minute .
okay .
I played basketball for a minute but when I realized those &+w <though were> though sports was the way out .
at &+m <at my> at my time of school, sports was the way out the hood .
yeah .
I wanted to be different .
you just wanted to be different .
yeah ‡ I didn't wanna catch a football, didn't wanna shoot a basketball to get out .
+< mhm .
that was too typical .
that was too easy .
nah ‡ I feel you .
I felt that way too .
know what I'm saying, so at that point I started just doing my own thing .
I I left home when I was fifteen .
never came back, never .
&-um .
wow okay .
yeah .
so ‡ that's a story in itself, you know what I'm saying .
but I got tired of just moving around and being unstable .
+< mhm .
I kind_of grew up in an unstable household .
okay .
you_know ‡ from the darker side of things „ you_know .
but my &+mo again my mother did what she hadta do .
and I don't regret anything I went through to get to where I am, you know what I'm saying „ so .
okay .
nah ‡ definitely .
my mother taught me how to survive .
<if I> &+di if I didn't get anything from her, I learned how to survive .
wow ‡ that's the greatest trait a mother can give somebody to a child .
yeah .
definitely .
absolutely .
so ‡ &-um can you tell me about your best teacher ?
I guess you that was one of (th)em that you was telling me .
what_about your worst teacher ?

math or science .
yeah man ‡ history .
I <I just hated> I didn't really enjoy school .
I felt like the things in school were +//.
not to be like a black panther or anything but I felt like the knowledge that they was giving us <was man> you_know was was written by man but it technically wasn't +//.
+< &=laughs mhm .
I wanted to know more, you know what I'm saying .
and and I would aks questions and challenge the teacher and you_know it would get me put out most times „ you_know .
but in actuality, as I got older, I realized challenging was just them not knowing knowing how to respond to a fifteen year-old kid you_know aksing (th)em real deep-ass questions „ you_know so .
+< dang .
mhm .
they get stumped sometime .
yeah ‡ they didn't understand it, so instead_of trying to understand it at the time, they just put me out_of class „ you_know .
somehow I always ended up in the music room, you know what I'm saying, and never looked back .
okay okay .
&+s music is your calling, your passion .
yeah ‡ music's my life .
music is your life .
yeah .
in your life is there a group of people you hang around with in particular ?

okay ‡ that's true .

mm mm .
realizing we owe fucking +//.
our royalties and publishing been depleted because_of us wanting to live the lifestyle to get to the &+gar the grande status, as they say, or the a@l list celebrity, you know what I'm saying .
+< mhm mhm .
they don't take time to look into their paperwork .

I'm not even saying I've arrived (be)cause I yall talking to me right now as a nobody, but I promise you, the next time we do a interview, I'll be a somebody .
you know what I'm saying „ so .
and I mean that in the most humble way, you know what I'm saying .

oh fuck .
it's cool .
you know I'm +//.
Common .
so ‡ what_about Common though ?
&+co +/.
we was just mentioning Common in the acting shit .
we was .
I think, for me, Common, man, it's it's his message .
it's conscious relevant message music, you know what I'm saying .
like ‡ I think he just did a record if I'm not mistaken for that &-uh that slave movie that was out, &-um &=tsks &-uh Birth_Of_A_Nation .
he did a record and I think I got the record on my phone .
mhm .
but it was just crazy, man, how him speaking the truth and speaking +//.
he's speaking shit that's really relevantly going on in the world today .
you know what I'm saying, he was hip, you_know because he &+s sought further knowledge .
you_know ‡ and from that perspective I respect him because it reflects in his lyrical content .
you can tell that nigga's level &+b of education through his lyrical delivery .
a_lot_of these niggas play themselves down for the industry, you know what I'm saying .
but a_lot_of these niggas is really intelligent .
and I use the &+nig the nigga@q term as embracing my fellow you_know brethren, for the record, because I know that's a conversation in itself, you know what I'm saying, the meaning behind it .
but I hafta state that because this is going on a public record .
yeah yeah yeah definitely .
and I don't want my image to be tainted or reflected, you know what I'm saying, in such a way .
so ‡ I mean it <as a> as a gesture of endearment, you know what I'm saying „ like .
yeah ‡ this is unedited .
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hell yeah .
no edits all the way through .
if you play a &+l piece of it, play all of it .
don't play it out_of context .
exactly, you know what I'm saying .
so ‡ <that's why I> that comes from just watching other niggas put their foot in they mouth saying shit socially via breakfast club or you know sway in the morning .
mm .
&-uh everyday struggle .
yeah ‡ the +/.
syndicated record shows <of that> of that nature, you know what I'm saying .
my thought personally in that +//.
I'll be straight, if you had your own platform, big enough that like +"/.
+" ay okay ‡ I see what yall saying .
+" make sure yall hear me when I say this .
+" this is how I feel about the situation .
some people got that .
exactly .
exactly .
yeah ‡ like I respect the guy Vince_Mensa for going up there and telling Akademiks that he smack the shit out_of (th)em because that's some real nigga shit .
but at the end of the day he told (th)em in such a intellectual way and he had a dialogue that was crazy to back up his reasoning for why .
+< yeah ‡ he did .
yeah ‡ he did .
he made that statement, you know what I'm saying .
he had no choice but to respect him .
but that was still on camera and that's a on camera threat .
like ‡ if anybody is smart they'll say +"/.
+< yeah ‡ it definitely is .
+" nah ‡ we ain't doing it .
lawsuit .
yeah .
I_mean yeah ‡ lawsuit, all that different type of stuff .
<I met you> at my job I can get fired .
I can lose money .
but I don't think Akademiks would take it that far because it's it's the culture, you know what I'm saying .
you can't deny the culture .
now ‡ if I was in Akademik's situation personally, I woulda reacted in a way like he did on camera but then yall &+prob +/.
+< you mighta reacted different .
behind +/.
yall woulda heard in the blog somewhere like +"/.
+" oh shit ‡ after the set, god_damn that nigga Slay and Vic_Mensa really went at it .
+" he really hadta stomp that nigga .
&=laughs yeah yeah .
+" (be)cause Slay fucked around .
yeah .
&=laughs .
it woulda &=laughs definitely woulda been one of them situations .
but I don't know „ man .
it's a different world out here .
it's just a different time and you gotta navigate accordingly .
+< yeah .
the thing is they want us to be monkeys and they want us +/.
they want that shit .
like movies .
like ‡ I don't know if you've ever seen the movie Bamboozled .
unhunh ‡ but that sound like something xxx .
but it the you &+kn if not, you needta watch it „ bro .
it depicts the way the black man, in my opinion, to a certain extent, is viewed via entertainment .
+< yeah .
let it be music, you know what I'm saying, movies, whatever .
+< mhm .
it it shows how we are used as pawns to get to a bigger plateau .
we create a revenue and then they take it from under us .
so ‡ it's all these loopholes because again we're blinded by the now, what's in front of us .
but me ‡ I'm thinking when I get money or people throw money at me +"/.
+" where am I gonna be ten years from now ?
+" where am I gonna be twenty years from now ?
where &+d you know what I'm saying, the +/.
damn .
and these +/.
okay .
and that's where financial literacy and all that stuff comes into play .
and niggas don't share that type of knowledge with each_other .
+< niggas don't even talk about that in the hood .
+< we talking about sports .
niggas all +//.
we yeah ‡ we talking about who got the hottest car or the baddest bitch or who fucking the bitch that your mans just fucked with a year ago, you know what I'm saying, on IG .
+< yeah yeah .
mhm &=laughs .
and now you hit her and now yall niggas bouta start beefing (be)cause she gonna start telling both of yall secrets, you know what I'm saying, (be)cause yall tell her everything type shit .
yeah yeah yeah .
oh yeah ‡ pillow talking and shit .
you feel it, you feel me .
so ‡ it's like, you know what I'm saying, I +/.
oh_man .
I'm I'm more concerned about where my accounts gonna be, where I'm making investments .
&=laughs .
how how can I further myself where, if music doesn't work out for me, what other lanes can I operate in effectively, you know what I'm saying, and still prevail ?
xxx .
<as a> as a entrepreneur, you know what I'm saying, as a young black man, you know what I'm saying, that comes from adversity .
you_know you_know so you_know ‡ it's why I work the way I do „ man .
that's why I don't sleep .
and you know what I'm saying, shouts out to Redacted_name Redacted_name , you know what I'm saying .
+< &=laughs .
you_know ‡ it's <the movement> <the movement like> the movement is real „ you_know .
I'm not just saying that (be)cause I'm the homie „ but .
yeah .
real shit man .
I I appreciate this opportunity first and foremost, know what I'm saying, before we go any further in the interview .
nah ‡ I'm done „ man .
you know what I'm saying, you're a very &+du cool brother, man, cool brother .
appreciate that „ man .
appreciate that .
yeah .
I know &-um I was thinking about dropping that &-um volume in the back with the music a little bit just off for a little bit .
yeah .
that joint is riding so much right now .
xxx .
and I really think they can really hear you .
Tyler ‡ you let me know in the next interview .
but this is sounding really good though .
yeah hell yeah .
<we in a> we in a good place with it .
&=laughs good place ‡ I think this ended out on a pretty high note „ man .
if there's anything else you wanna just say, just to say, you more than welcome .
we pretty_much done hit our threshold mark .
oh ‡ facts .
mhm .
well ‡ I'll I'll say this first and foremost .
man ‡ you know what I'm saying, this is is &+r the realest shit I could ever probably say out my mouth on the record .
okay .
at my age, at the age of thirty, you know what I'm saying, for the record .
yeah .
mhm .
for all who don't know, April six Aries nation, you know what I'm saying „ fuck yeah .
you know what I'm saying, but real nigga shit, always take care of the ones around you .
make sure they eat <just as> &+m just as much as you if not more .
with that, you'll you'll grow in your success a_lot further and a_lot faster versus trynna do everything for self .
or you eating and you giving (th)em nuggets, because at that point when everybody's eating around you, everybody's happy, everybody's working, everybody's moving .
but the moment somebody feels inadequate, that's when all hell breaks loose .
so ‡ I say this to any mogul or anybody coming up that's building a team and trynna build their brand and branding themselves and they career „ man .
build a team of people that you know you don't mind investing in .
and make sure they all do something different .
<like &+m you_know> like my man said .
and &-uh you_know ‡ a earlier quote that I heard a few minutes ago .
make sure everybody does something different because it brings a different entity .
it brings a different way of thinking .
and respect your peers, you_know respect them for they craft .
&-um put them <at a> in a place where they're always challenged because always leave room to grow .
because when you become comfortable you &+c become stagnant and you become reprobate in your mindset .
so ‡ you know what I'm saying, you definitely don't wanna wanna do that „ man .
and just you_know I just encourage, you know what I'm saying, just everybody, man, to keep going, keep grinding „ you_know .
your time is now .
again next time you talk to me, and we may have a interview, may be me teaching a master class on production, you know what I'm saying .
it may be you_know me writing a book and I'm I'm coming to talk about the book and promote the book .
you know what I'm saying, book tour type stuff .
you never know what god has in store, you know what I'm saying, the almighty creator .
and I'm not even the most religious person .
I love god, you know what I'm saying, but again that's another conversation .
<you don't hafta be physically attached to it> &+fo you don't hafta be physically attached to a church you_know to to have a relationship and always know that man „ you_know .
so ‡ I just say man god bless, you_know what I'm saying, the almighty creator .
again thank_you for this interview .
know what I'm saying, Redacted_name on the rise .
socially awkward, slay that shit, you know what I'm saying .
slayer stamp .
yeah ‡ you know what I'm saying .
we we up next .
&-um yall just support us .
&=laughs .
you know what I'm saying .
<the movement> the movement has already begun .
facts
