so this handout that I've given you is going to be your record sheet for all your matches . 415_6535
and as a class, we did the first two together . 7115_9355
okay ? 9855_9895
so I'm going to project the directions, and while I'm passing them out, I'm going to ask different volunteers to read different parts of it, okay ? 9955_16715
so I'm going to ask, S_one, can you read the first three directions up at the top ? 16855_21955
can you read it out loud ? 22075_22855
the graphs represent the flow of liquid either out of the top prism or into the bottom prism of the container . 24335_31815
take turns to match two cards that represent the movement of water in one container . 33715_39155
place the three cards next to each other, not on the top, so everyone can see . 39835_45155
okay, good . 45535_45915
thank you, S_one . 46035_46615
okay . 46715_47015
S_two, the other S_two, can you read the next three ? 47375_49995
when you match two cards, explain how you came to your decision . 52085_55985
five, your partner should either explain that reasoning again in his or her own words or challenge the reasons you gave . 56665_63305
six, some graphs are missing information, such as a scale along an axis . 63965_68725
you will need to add this scale . 69505_71025
can you read that last phrase ? 72025_73325
you both need to be able to agree on and explain the match of every card . 73645_78405
okay . 78685_78885
so what I've just passed out while people were reading, thank you S_one and S_two, is a stack of twelve graphs, and these graphs either represent the flow of liquid out of the top of the prism, or the flow of liquid into the bottom . 79095_93175
and you have to match the two that represent that movement for the same container . 93795_98915
okay ?
now parts of it +... 99695_100895
parts of it are missing information . 102475_106615
so you might see some tick marks that don't have numbers . 106815_109955
you might see one that might be blank, and you're going to have to fill that in . 110675_113595
so I'd recommend you do the ones that are first filled in and then go from there . 113915_117415
okay ? 117795_117855
now this is the part I really want to encourage, because we're trying to build an argument . 118015_123275
so when you put a match together, you have to explain to your partner why it's a match, and your partner has to say, yes, they agree with you, and why, or no, I disagree with you, and why . 123775_137495
so you're really re-explaining what each other's saying before you put a match together . 137875_142295
I don't want you to put the cards on top of each other . 142755_145795
I want you to put the cards just like this on your paper . 146215_149275
not on your paper, but on your desk, where I see a top prism and a bottom prism and you can even label it . 149695_155015
sorry, I'm hearing a side conversation right now . 156035_158275
I hear a top prism, and I hear a bottom prism and I want to make sure that they're on top of each other . 158635_163175
does everybody understand that ? 163575_165235
are there any questions ? 165535_166575
okay, now if you don't know what to say, do you have language up there to help you get started ? 167415_172015
yeah . 172335_172795
yeah .
you also want to consider these things: starting, rate of change, constraint . 172975_177175
is there anything else that you think you'd want to consider when you're looking at it, that we could add ? 177235_182315
is anybody looking at time ? 183555_187455
is anybody looking at the time factor ? 187895_189935
okay, if you are, that might be something that we could add also . 190155_192555
if you think of things, let me know, and we'll add to that list, okay ? 192835_195275
all right, I'll give you ten minutes and then we're going to check in ten minutes . 195495_198495
go for it . 198735_199715
good luck . 199755_200175
okay, you can do it . 200415_201175
so which one do you want to do first ? 202905_205345
let's start off with the one that's already filled in . 206045_209245
okay .
so this one will cancel out, and then +... 210185_214945
this will be +...
so let's start with this .
and one of them will be like negative, decreasing . 215785_224265
so we need to find a relationship like, this one's decreasing by like two . 224745_232865
yeah, and that one's decreasing by four . 233685_235265
so that's not a match . 235665_236965
that one's ?
this one ? 238725_244645
yeah . 244925_245945
okay . 246325_247125
that one increased by six, right ? 251205_255485
isn't that a match ? 256725_257845
how ? 259305_259525
isn't he going by six ? 262645_264265
so +...
oh, wait, we're not doing xxx . 265945_267465
it is wrong . 267725_273445
this one +... 279915_280355
how about the second ? 281955_284175
it doesn't +... 285975_286295
sorry . 286835_289055
sorry .
because this one increased and it +... 289515_294675
I think this one matches because it's six up here and it's decreasing slowly . 295235_299875
and then this one has none, which means it's going to have zero . 300195_304035
so the bottom one is zero and the one is six . 304655_306955
two to one . 306995_307415
the constants . 311745_312165
constant ? 314105_314305
yes . 314685_315125
sorry . 315545_317125
height .
so it means six . 318145_319905
and then this is three . 320365_321145
three seconds . 321405_321725
what do you think it's going at ? 322305_323185
like how much centimeters are decreasing per one second ? 323665_331845
point five . 332485_333005
no .
wait, six and three . 333845_338005
yes . 338285_338765
two . 340105_340325
it's going two centimeters over one second . 340425_345165
yeah .
okay, I get it now . 347145_348465
this one increased by four +... 349105_352265
so this one's increasing by four, which means the other one has to start at two . 353605_357905
it has to decrease by two . 359105_360445
so it's like that one . 360625_361205
so which one are you talking about ? 361745_366925
this one and this one . 367675_368555
put them on top of each other . 369095_370415
I don't know if it's right yet . 370975_372175
fine .
it's because of this one's at four increasing, so this one would be in on the bottom . 373115_378655
this one's at two decreasing, so that would equal six . 378895_381635
yeah . 381875_382115
so that's one pair .
this one's a pair . 384175_385015
this is two . 385555_387535
or is g-two ? 389935_390795
what ? 391375_391735
oh, I already went through this one . 392515_395215
and why do you think that ? 398025_398785
I talked about it earlier . 399285_400965
should we put +... 402745_410045
this is already four, starting at four . 410165_411985
so should we put two here or like, in the middle ? 412205_414345
two here and four . 415145_416525
then, there zero . 417425_418685
and then xxx . 420485_421025
can you write it ? 421205_422305
because you're confusing me . 422505_424005
so it's six, four, two . 425825_426465
so should the line go up ? 427285_439845
because it's increasing when this goes down ? 440105_443145
the line should go up where ? 446625_448225
so it should go up that way . 448605_449945
because if this is the top, then this has to go up . 451665_454005
yeah .
yeah .
so you could just draw a line that way . 454985_457045
can I stop ? 458265_459705
I'm going stop everybody . 459885_460785
I forgot to tell you to record your matches on your record sheet because that's what you're going to be using when we travel around the room to check our other answers with other people and check our justifications with other people . 461145_474245
so as you're matching them, when you're very confident with a match and you can explain and your partner can explain it, you could take the match and write it on your record sheet and then write a justification . 474305_484645
your justification can be bullet points right now . 484925_487225
okay ?
does everybody understand that ? 487885_489565
okay, there are six matches . 489605_491705
so if you're on your second match, you want to keep going . 492105_494545
okay ? 494825_494965
we'll check in in five minutes . 495005_496225
so ? 496405_497185
g-eight is up top . 497685_499505
so this one starts at four centimeters at zero and it increases, so this must be the bottom because then it goes down . 502465_516605
so this one starts at six and goes down . 519025_523385
I don't know .
those come out of zero . 524825_526025
this one might go +... 532475_536515
let's see, six . 539355_543395
this one's six, two . 544775_546755
but this one goes down, this one goes up . 547415_549675
so this can be top and that one bottom . 550215_553515
alright ?
which one would start at two +... 554535_557835
this one starts at +... 558075_558495
and somehow decrease all the way to one second . 558665_561625
wait, for top or bottom or does it matter ? 562265_565405
oh, this one starts at two . 565705_566465
this one starts at two . 567065_568885
no, that's not two . 569145_570025
oh yeah . 570365_570965
sorry . 571345_571625
I was looking at my line . 572005_572825
so this one starts at two +... 573325_575565
and then this one +... 576905_578225
this one does too, or that one ? 578385_581265
this one goes down from two seconds to one . 582505_584645
this one goes down . 585565_586665
we need to find out these numbers . 586985_588345
don't get nervous . 589485_592365
wait, two . 593705_595485
did we find out these numbers ? 599705_603765
I'm guessing they could go by two seconds, like two, four, six . 604365_611445
let's see . 614615_615215
so if this, wait, let's see which ones don't have it on the bottom . 615375_625715
these don't have a bottom . 626395_627275
these don't have bottom . 627415_628195
and what has numbers ? 628555_630115
these have numbers .
on the bottom . 631795_636855
so these have to let you know what these are . 638055_640975
this we have to stake up because we don't know anything about it, it's blank . 642475_646855
I think these are a match, because they go by threes here . 668125_671425
okay . 672785_673105
those are threes and these go by threes . 673265_675325
but these don't go down . 675985_677385
0 +...
have four . 679245_681625
let's see one, two, three, four . 681825_683625
so could I start with four up here and for the bottom also start with four ? 684025_689225
no .
okay . 689645_690725
why not ? 690785_691205
because it has to equal six . 691785_692985
why does it have to equal six ? 693065_694165
because there's six lines . 695595_696835
yeah . 697735_698335
that's how much liquid it is . 698455_699475
it's our constraint . 699555_700155
that's all . 700335_700535
I can't take it out . 700655_702035
I sealed up this hole, so that's all I have in there . 702255_705175
so when I look at these matches, even though I like what you're saying with the top and bottom, because the lines looks like they're decreasing for the top and increasing for the bottom . 705335_714375
what are you finding that you might be reconsidering ? 714835_717475
what part kind of throws a wrench in your match ? 718195_722515
the time . 723625_724225
what was that ? 724225_724505
the time . 724685_725085
the time or what +... 725345_726265
I mean, what's this right here ? 726525_727565
oh, the height . 727725_728205
the height . 728305_728745
okay . 729105_729265
so is this going to be a match ? 729565_730805
no .
okay . 730985_731305
so I'm going to move this . 731605_732505
and what would be a better match for g-eleven, knowing that there's four to start out with in the top . 732945_738545
how many would I need to have in the bottom ? 738985_741465
two .
what is it ? 741945_743805
two ? 744185_744285
why two ? 744365_744745
because that's how much +... 745045_747785
yeah, because why +... 748025_748945
so if there's four in the top, why would I have two in the bottom ? 749105_752125
so it can be even to get six ? 753045_755205
so I can get to six, right ? 755265_756565
okay, so we need to find a graph that is +... 756665_759305
whose start situation is two and looks like they're going upward . 759765_762965
do you see how I'm matching that ? 763465_765065
yeah . 765405_765685
okay . 765865_766005
so I'm going to leave you and I'll come back, but you want to start with the starting situation to help guide you . 766165_771385
okay ? 771525_771645
but I do like what you said about the increasing and decreasing line . 771785_774765
that's good . 774925_775125
okay .
I'll give you guys two more minutes . 778245_779685
if you're not done in two minutes, it's okay . 779865_781445
but all the ones you know, can you please match up ? 781825_783825
