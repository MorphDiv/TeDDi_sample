so please get those ready +... 272325_277145
the group who's presenting number one will they please come up ? 280965_283465
and if you haven't already will you please pass in your labs ? 284505_286985
(0.5) this looks like a really short <pile up there> .
very short .
xxx quite a number of people xxx .
xxx .
xxx .
xxx .
yep +...
&-um we had number one &-um the first part of our question asked us to &-um xxx some <class data> &-uh does xxx acidity vary from family to family on the periodic table and so basically made a a print test out_of we made a a diagram of like how &-um you gotta show that from family one to heavy metals the acidity increase &-um with heavy metal +//. 309025_335825
family one being PH of five point four nine the average PH . 335805_339085
family two being five point seven transition metals being five point one nine and then the most acidic heavy metals being two point five two . 339605_346705
so we concluded that basically acidity increase is going to the right on the periodic table and then &-um for the second part we were asked &-um NA plus or MG two plus which one would be more acidic and basically why and looking on the periodic table MG two plus is more to the right than &~N NA plus so &-um we said that MG two plus would be more acidic . 347665_370205
and then the third part was asking &-um would it be preferable to apply &-um LI and then <go over> to CA sulfate to the solid ground . 371225_381245
until the solid ground is acid living so &~y &~sa &-um <that the> most acidic would be the best one which would be and then since it's also more to your right than <you would choose aluminum> . 381805_391925
&-um . 393625_395485
&-uh for the last one &-um <we spoke> xxx about the the formation of the acid mutually . 399585_405665
so basically what happened is like as &-um xxx &-uh as it moved to the right of the periodic table it become more acidic &-uh and it also increases the electronegativity as you can see from here that as you move to the right it will increase . 406425_426225
there are some exceptions but xxx so &-uh the main xxx is like because like the more electronegativity is likely to attract more electrons so that the proton will be more positive with respect to xxx . 427685_441885
so you tend to lose xxx . 442105_444865
you tend to get <out_of the> molecules and form with &~a with another xxx water molecules to form the hydronium xxx the ions with the &~H h@l three o@l plus . 445705_456665
it basically explain why we increase the activity of the solution . 457625_461125
and for the last one we are asked to to explain the relationship between the charge density with the acidity so basically &-uh we defined &-um &-uh okay the density as &-um positive &-uh the positive charge divided by the ion radius which is given here zero point eight one something like that so &~i as you can see that as we move &-uh from left to right the radius decreases . 462905_492885
&-uh I mean excluding the &~th +/. 495505_497905
<the ruse> +/.
+, I mean excluding the halogens . 498785_499985
so the charge stays basically the same but &-uh as radius decreases so it will increase so tentative &-uh explanation is the same as the electronegativity +... 500765_511265
any question ? 512125_513585
(0.15) no &=laughs .
thank you .
(0.21) &-um oh <one and two> &-uh question two . 548955_553395
please come forward . 554655_555195
there is no question two .
yes there is .
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ xxx oh that's right ⌋ xxx (0.5) .
xxx copy .
xxx .
here +...
xxx fold xxx (0.6) .
alright &-uh the first part of the question is &-uh what kinds of observation or changes in properties allow you to infer that a complexation reaction has occurred . 582325_591225
so &-uh this first part (0.7) <I picked for> the one that I had the <orbit difference so> ignore the first word . 592185_605305
so our color change is an indication of complexation for our transition metals post transition metals &-um excluding zinc and &~a aluminum . 605595_616455
and <I have> an example down here xxx our copper reaction &-um including complexation . 618415_635575
yeah the reason that we excluded &-uh zinc from this &-uh manipulous@n$adj xxx zinc originally has a full +//. 626445_633785
the zinc two class originally has a two full E shells no it's &-uh itself it's colorless so &-uh there won't be any color change even if we &-uh have any <compact form> xxx (be)cause there will be no shift of color or wavelength . 634485_648885
okay he's actually talking about the second question here which is &-uh &{l=READING ZN two plus exists in aqueous solution of &-uh &-uh complex ZNH zero four . 651925_660885
&-uh zinc will complex with &-uh ammonia based on your answer predict what changes would be observed if you performed procedure one with ZN two plus instead of &-uh <carbides which you have> xxx &}l=READING for zinc it's the nitrate at base form precipitate which &~dis disappears upon adding more base may be inferred that complexation has occurred . 661735_687155
this is confirmed by a reappearance of precipitate when strong acid . 687785_692585
&-uh then we would use a nitric acid it's &-uh added to the mixture +... 693565_696765
xxx .
question ?
yeah +...
yeah &-um so don't go away yet . 701745_713865
&-um you said that you can infer color change for post transition also ? 714145_719945
+, I think that's what you have written down ? 721085_722945
yeah we had for our transition metals and post transition metals excluding ⌈ xxx solution xxx ⌉ . 723365_728785
⌊ xxx ⌋ yeah but .
⌈ I thought post ⌉ transition metals don't have color . 728985_731625
I mean our +//. 732005_732565
actually we are saying &-uh we are including those without color xxx . 733125_735665
like &-uh aluminum zinc &-um . 736525_740165
yeah . 740525_740725
actually there are more more than that more than those two . 741885_744585
which are colored as ice . 745245_746205
yeah so how do you infer that &-uh what are the two ways you infer <that a> infer a complexation reaction with ? 746745_752305
post transition metals if they're colorless ? 752505_754625
if we add base to cations +/. 755365_760685
mhm +/.
+, and it goes to +//. 761285_763485
the charge &~go goes to zero and xxx <then when we &~act ax it back> so charge will come back the positive charge will come back . 763545_772905
so &~i it will xxx . 773485_774025
that doesn't necessarily imply that it complexed@n$v one it means that you're just reversing the precipitation reaction right ? 775505_781905
+, ⌈ so ⌉ how do you the way that you would infer the post transition metal from the complexes by the addition of excess base . 782245_788425
in seeing it start with a precipitate and then going to the precipitate disappearing with the addition of the same base . 789365_794945
⌊ okay ⌋ ?
⌈ &~w &~w ⌉ &~w we know that about the zinc ⌊ <which is> xxx ⌋ .
⌈ yeah remember going over the charge ⌉ <and since> charging the opposite way ? 796025_801265
we talked about that .
+, ⌈ xxx ⌉ yeah .
xxx .
yeah but you wanna make it more general for the +//. 803045_809185
all post transitions &-um because they are colorless +/. 809665_812665
mhm +/.
+, right .
so then the acid actually is a way to test if something has already complexed@n$v . 814225_820665
right ? 820665_820725
if you can put acid into it and see a precipitate come back it must have been complex for that to occur right ? 821325_827785
(0.7) yes .
yes +... 832605_834725
okay xxx what ?
how can you tell if NH three complexes with transitions isn't the only way to like precipitate like xxx OH xxx .
what ?
I &~di didn't ⌊ understand your question ⌋ .
⌈ how can you tell if ⌉ how can you tell if it was through complex xxx post transitions if xxx <is it just> xxx at the OH chemistry xxx . 860835_862335
you haven't seen xxx <in the way that they can> ⌊ xxx ⌋ . 862935_865215
⌈ you haven't ⌉ you haven't measured any way to do that . 865215_868575
okay . 868855_869035
⌊ so where xxx ⌋ .
⌈ don't be you +//.
you don't know ⌉ how to &-um for the +/. 869255_873075
+, oh for this you don't be concerned with NH three complexes and post transition necessarily &-um especially about making inferences &-um as to whether they complex or not &-uh because we haven't really tested that in lab &-um the post transitions are very easy because you see or I'm sorry the transitions are very easy because &-um you see a change in color right ? 875065_899965
and if you remember from spectral analysis of solutions that when you added NH three to any &-um any solution &-uh that contains transition metals you get a shift of the absorbance peak toward the the lower wavelengths and a corresponding &-um deeper color of solution than beforehand or a complete change in color of solution alright ? 900505_924485
so that's how you infer NH three complexation . 924765_927765
you could also if you added OH &-uh we've learned that OH is a stronger &-um xxx well I mean as as far as heavy metals dissolving +/. 928545_940785
oh right +/.
+, or whatever &-um you <you could> you could see if NH three &-um complex with a heavy metal or a post transition metal &-uh or element if you had a charged item on +//. 941745_954405
in forming precipitate you add NH three and it dissolved again . 955565_958185
that would prove it but you guys didn't systematically study that kind of thing I mean you did some experiments like it but you know if it doesn't dissolve it doesn't tell you whether or not it was complexed@n$v or not areas so don't worry about it . 959045_985405
xxx .
part three on this experiment was intended to specifically show you that certain things can and cannot complex &-um but predicting whether a complex is formed with post transitions we haven't done xxx +/. 974555_986755
okay .
+, so questions oh +//.
⌊ sorry ⌋ .
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
I xxx <whether or not it complexes> ?
like for xxx .
oh I I think I know what you're getting to .
are you speaking in reference to like aluminum plus three ? 988035_995475
⌊ <how you continuously> add base <to sue> precipitate then see a complex ⌋ ?
⌈ xxx <talking about> xxx potassium oxalate xxx ⌉ .
⌊ no I'm talking about ⌋ the &-um potassium carbonate and xxx ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 995475_1001635
⌊ xxx potassium oxalate ⌋ .
yeah .
+, she's talking about when we precipitate up and we added a complex xxx <dissolve and you dissolve> . 1003415_1004535
yeah &-um actually those two are really good precipitating agents xxx this the first place . 1017945_1022785
but Lewis base acidity is dependent on the species and it doesn't necessarily imply that it'll <form a> precipitate if it's a good Lewis base . 1023405_1030825
so NH three is an extremely good Lewis base so it can displace that precipitating agent &-um pretty readily for most things &-um and as you as we'll see further in this discussion of you'll notice that in part three actually there's a a preference <for which> for which metals on the periodic table will show that tendency to &~precip or &-uh to &-um complex with NH three or OH . 1031265_1055865
or OH right .
so if like the the precipitating agent doesn't really affect the results <or of the> right but it sorta does like <we saw> the difference between ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 1057825_1066465
⌊ it's kinda like a marker ⌋ . 1066465_1067385
it's +/. 1067965_1068045
+, kinda like it's kinda like a way for you to see what affects what metals . 1068285_1071585
+, right . 1071905_1072145
+, what will complex with what metals . 1072165_1073565
for instance you you &~b you do a precipitate reaction you have a layer of precipitate there now in_order_to dissolve that precipitate it has a charge of zero . 1073725_1081165
in_order_to dissolve that precipitate you're gonna hafta put something on there that's noncharged that's gonna let the charge come back to the things so it can go back in the solution . 1082405_1089325
so it'll displace the precipitating agent right ? 1089985_1091885
that thing that's going to displace it will be whatever Lewis base is gonna be most favored for that metal ion that's precipitated . 1093565_1100825
whatever it wants to complex with will will make it go back in solution . 1101465_1106625
alright xxx .
yeah I think the best way to think about it is if you have a precipitate and you pour base on it and that precipitate disappears then you know that whatever you poured on it was a better Lewis base . 1108075_1117655
okay so if you were given a list of Lewis bases &-um in +//. 1118315_1122995
from greatest to to weakest &-uh <you would> you would say okay well the greatest one would dissolve a precipitate form with a a weaker one . 1123435_1130875
right ? 1131295_1131375
&-um it's you probably won't see anything like that on a test right now because it that concept's kinda vague from this experiment but &-um that's just the way it happens . 1131985_1142725
so should we have seen different results with the precipitating agents and the same metal and same &-um make ? 1144005_1149445
&-uh could you repeat that question ⌈ please ⌉ ? 1149785_1151285
⌊ like ⌋ if we have like aluminum thirty plus and NH three and a different precipitating agent should we have seen a different result ? 1151285_1156885
probably not . 1157185_1158225
unless the precipitating agent was a stronger Lewis base than &-uh what precipitated aluminum . 1158675_1167135
do you see what I mean ? 1169635_1170235
yeah &-um NH three is actually one of the best Lewis bases . 1171375_1174195
so . 1174895_1175515
and OH minus actually if you recall from I think procedure one or two from &-um part two &~y you can infer that NH three is a better Lewis base than the OH minus . 1177155_1191375
for the transition metals .
⌈ <I believe> xxx ⌉ .
⌊ for ⌋ the transition metals . 1192475_1194015
yep .
+, right .
that doesn't hold for every single bond <that appears to do that> .
+, right . 1194695_1196475
+, xxx see that xxx anyways . 1197895_1201715
&-um does anyone else have a question ? 1202255_1204195
okay part three question three . 1236025_1236145
xxx .
what ?
xxx .
I don't know .
xxx xxx .
okay so the first part is &-um is there a link between a cation's tendency to complex with OH or NH three and the acidity of the cation ?
&-um and and basically what we've what we think is that the more acidic or the lower the PH &-um the more likely it is to complex . 1243305_1248945
&-um and what we did &-um <for the> for the charge for both of the charges we combined the precipitate to complex and the complex the +//. 1250205_1258945
we combined those two <&-um &-uh> &-um &-uh areas &-um and so you can kind_of by doing that you can kind_of see the trend &-um since we we ordered the &-um the areas that xxx to be &-um least reactive to the more reactive . 1259385_1276425
&-uh no reaction obviously no reaction precipitate there's somewhat of a reaction and in the precipitate the complex on the complex &-um both of the the data was a little weird so we were having trouble finding the trends and that's why we combined the two so you can kind_of see the trends &-um in both &-um +... 1276805_1294145
now +/.
I guess it's heavy +/. 1295685_1299785
+, &-uh the only thing that was that the one to find out was that between the heavy and the transition &-um just the way the data was laid out &-um you can definitely say that that the conclusion is true for the NAOH however you can't necessarily say it for the NH three just because of the because of this one right here (be)cause +//. 1299205_1317345
&-uh this one actually did form a precipitate so it doesn't quite follow but that's more or less true . 1317905_1323065
I have a question . 1324885_1325445
yep .
+, &-um so &~a as a general rule could you say that &-uh heavy metals and transition metals together &-um complex more often than family one and two together ? 1327605_1336785
yes . 1337705_1340145
+, yes .
okay . 1340885_1340985
good .
&=laughs yeah .
xxx .
&-um actually I would like to make a quick note . 1341505_1345405
&-uh transition NAOH . 1345805_1347145
&-uh you see that some people reported it precipitates complex ? 1347665_1350885
only true for zinc . 1351585_1353025
not true for any of the others that we tested . 1353545_1355485
it's impossible it was a misinterpretation of the experiment that led to that that data point . 1356095_1362475
so bear that in mind . 1363055_1365695
(0.7) .
I was maybe if you I don't know if <&~s &~y &-uh> do you understand like what this chart is showing or not . 1367355_1379075
like I don't know .
(be)cause like with these X's are correspond to these two here and that means transitions and family twos for recorded precipitate and this is the transitions and heavies were the only ones that formed complex xxx . 1380915_1392995
yeah the X is just the &~mo it's the most predominant ⌈ <thing we saw> ⌉ . 1393255_1396275
⌊ the predominant thing ⌋ that we found on the chart xxx the majority xxx and so there's +//. 1396295_1400115
tends to be this general trend increasing acidity . 1400495_1403175
yeah . 1403495_1403835
<just quick> .
okay .
the next part of the question was &-um based on your answer predict if palladium two plus will complex and palladium is can you see that ? 1408285_1421865
you might wanna lift it up a little higher . 1422705_1423925
okay this . 1424165_1424705
ignore the stuff on the bottom . 1425625_1426525
yeah . 1426565_1426745
that can be dealt with .
okay palladium is a transition metal it's number forty six there so we predicted that +... 1429155_1437615

xxx .
xxx got the head goal xxx .
okay well &-um +... 1449395_1453855
if it follows the trend then most likely in sodium hydroxide since it's a transition metal it's gonna &-um it's going to form a complexation reaction and +/. 1456305_1468445
or +/.

it's either gonna form a precipitate or a precipitate to complex with NAOH as you see there . 1470345_1476705
and +... 1477925_1479925
we didn't get any results that it just formed a precipitate with ammonia so xxx <complex before> xxx ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 1481865_1487925

cladding +/.
+, cladding agents substance that can form stable complex and ions and offer an explanation for why this is effective . 1515825_1521465
because &-um if you add these the cladding agents then the lead is stable and it doesn't react with any of the chemicals that are in the human body and then it can be excreted through the body without harming you if it is done soon enough . 1523025_1541445
give the explanation for why they do that . 1543665_1545285

I cannot emphasize how important it is for you to realize that only zinc can go from precipitate to complex none of the other transition metals will . 1566285_1575085
okay ?
xxx NOH . 1577145_1577985

⌊ alright ⌋ our question was <can you predict> &~th can you predict the salt solubility in base if you know the cation's acidity . 1632595_1640015
okay &-um we're also supposed to summarize the class data from part three +... 1640075_1645135
&-um and basically what we're doing in part three was considering whether &-um the process of &-um converting insoluble metal compound to soluble complex is more related to the cation's acidity or to its ability to complex with NH three or OH minus . 1647425_1664605
and so we hadta take our information from our first and second part of the lab to make our hypothesis xxx &-um which basically found that the PH is going to increase from the left side of the periodic table and also and break +//. 1665705_1681265
xxx in this part xxx see xxx one has the higher PH average and then &-um it decreases to the right . 1682745_1689805
and then also we &-um as was just discussed with the recent groups &-um the reactions with NAOH or NH thirty plus . 1690225_1700105
so then in part three what we did was we kinda we &~com we kinda compared the both of them &-um come up with how when it's combined with an insoluble metal compound if it's going +//. 1700965_1713945
if the precipitate would then be soluble . 1714225_1716585
and we found that in family one it was very soluble . 1717065_1720645
and we never even had a precipitate when we mixed it so that that was plenty . 1720805_1723805
and then in family number two it never dissolved . 1724105_1727365
and there was no precipitate . 1727625_1728705
and then in the transitions in the heavy metals it depended on whether it was mixed with NH three or NAOH . 1728905_1734305
but it didn't necessarily matter what the the metal compound was because in all cases NH three it +//. 1734905_1741885
the precipitate was dissolved for the transition metals and for the heavy metals so in all cases of NAOH the precipitate was dissolved . 1741985_1748185
&-um so based on this information we would +//. 1749185_1752745
&-um as far as predicting salt solubility &-um if we know the cation's acidity we would say if we know the cation's acidity then we could place it into an area on the periodic table . 1753885_1765005
as we've seen if it's a higher PH then we're gonna assume that it's gonna be in the family one area which then we would predict would be very soluble . 1765065_1774285
whereas if it's got a &-um low PH then we would assume that it's towards the heavy metals heavy end and then we would think that it would be soluble in NAOH . 1774825_1785785
or if it's a little higher then we'd think it would be transition then <it would> be soluble in NH three . 1786425_1791085
and that would also be fairly easy to test because that's you remember in the lab when you just kinda mixed the two together and see which one it is . 1791305_1798685
so it'd also be useful for identifying whatever it is that you're trying to make soluble . 1799265_1804145
second part of the question is it says that &{l=READING <NI two> NI two plus is acidic and forms complexes with NH three . 1804945_1811605
so can you +//. 1812105_1812345
can you draw a a picture depicting the Lewis acid base reaction between and &~reac reaction between an NI two plus and NH three . 1812545_1823245
&}l=READING and it says MG two plus is slightly acidic in water and does not complex with OH minus or NH three does this <fact accordingly> . 1824165_1831905
okay . 1833205_1833305
the first part . 1833605_1834165
drawing the reaction . 1835005_1836605
look at our nickel two plus combining with NH three which is a Lewis base and has two electrons that it can share with this Lewis acid which wants some and the result of this reaction is nickel and the NH three . 1837245_1853345
we think there's still gonna be the two plus charge there and &{l=SIC supposably &}l=SIC depending on the number of waters that were originally complexed@n$v with the nickel will have that same number within NH three . 1854265_1867425
⌈ but ⌉ .
⌊ six ⌋ .
⌈ six ⌉ ?
⌊ same ⌋ number of molecules xxx . 1868345_1870065
yeah but we didn't get that information for the question so whatever it is would be ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 1870465_1875445
⌊ six ⌋ .
six . 1876345_1876725
+, <plus six yeah> . 1876765_1877285
okay .
so &-uh if it's six then in that case it's gonna be it's gonna be NI . 1877765_1881045
and then it's gonna have you're gonna have six water molecule attached to that . 1881265_1884605
and then the &-uh NH three is gonna react with that . 1885205_1888125
and then this is gonna replace right here <so we get> NI . 1888565_1890605
and it's gonna be NH thirty subscript six with a charge of plus two . 1890765_1894785
and then you're gonna have those six waters added on to the peroxide . 1894965_1899085
indeed . 1899345_1900765
the second part of the question was about magnesium two plus . 1901545_1905645
and it said that it was slightly acidic and our average was five point seven three and it should not complex . 1906265_1911825
so we gathered a little more information on it it's from family two and when combined with NH three we get no reaction . 1913065_1919765
and when combined with NAOH we get a precipitate and then a complex . 1920605_1924645
and this right here the combination with a NAOH does not support this conclusion +... 1925585_1931405
so we got a a yes and a no . 1932785_1934785
so we don't know what to make of that +... 1935545_1936505
and <this is> this is from the data +... 1938525_1939685
okay ?
do you have &~s copy of the data +..? 1941145_1945425
<&-um all we used was &-um> &~t to determine this (be)cause it wasn't mixed with an insoluble xxx . 1948185_1953365
we used part two when we were just mixing it with NH three and NAOH which &~bas +//. 1953545_1958565
&-um I don't know if the group before probably has better data . 1959585_1961905
does depicting that but with +//? 1962825_1964025
we had right here it's family two with NAOH xxx precipitate complex with no reaction NH xxx and . 1964225_1969745
that's why we got xxx (0.8) . 1973385_1974285
okay +... 1974605_1983045
any questions ? 1984165_1986645
(0.46) .
okay we have question five and it's like can you predict the salt solubility in a base if you know the cation's tendency to form complexes ? 2035445_2041985
what we did was we looked at the data from part three &~t or part two to see what the tendency of each cation was to form a complex in either NAOH or NH three . 2042805_2054225
and we saw that family ones didn't form complexes in either base because there was no precipitate at all . 2055125_2061385
family two didn't form a complex on either one . 2061915_2064735
transition cations formed complexes in NH three and heavy metals formed complexes in NH four . 2065635_2070695
in NH three we also noticed that there in the family three cations we noticed that there was &-um split in the <pass A to a change in> precipitate and precipitate to complex in the NAOH solution . 2072615_2082315
and we think this error was probably because a_lot_of like the things that know the difference between what a precipitate was versus what a precipitate to complex was where it should've been just a precipitate and the same thing for the heavy metals in NH three . 2082875_2096375
and then knowing the cation's tendency to form complex as well allowed us predict its salt solubility because if a cation forms a complex in a certain base it's <&~oft and> salt will dissolve in that base . 2097255_2108215
so since family one's cations didn't form a complex in anything they didn't precipitate xxx nothing to dissolve xxx dissolve in either base . 2109235_2119095
family two cations form precipitates in both k@l two CO three and k@l two c@l two o@l four but because they didn't form a complex in either NAOH or NH three neither of the two precipitates dissolved . 2120135_2130895
and in family three elements form precipitates again with both of the precipitating reagents and since we know that they form complexes in NH three we know that +//. 2132995_2141955
the salts were soluble in NH three and for the heavy metals we had a precipitate with both precipitating reagents and formed <a compounds> xxx NAOH therefore it was soluble in the NAOH +... 2142375_2162975
&-uh okay the second part says &{l=READING the lead two plus ion has a pronounced tendency to react with proteins and and interferes with the biosynthesis of hemoglobin in humans . 2156465_2167425
compare the likelihood of finding lead ions rather than the precipitating lead compounds in water below xxx high PH &}l=READING okay &-uh lead is a heavy metal and heavy metals were found to be highly acidic so you would probably find lead ions in acidic solution and you would find the lead compounds in basic solution +... 2168245_2184025
okay +..? 2188155_2188495
actually xxx basic solutions xxx . 2192755_2195395
well <&~n it> xxx acidic I mean if you add acid to acid nothing would happen right ? 2195875_2217595
hm (0.5) yeah ?

&-um .

well see the thing is is in basic solutions you have an abundance of like negative charges that &-um when &~y when you add a base <right from the> acid +//. 2224305_2232205

alright ?

which is a base +/. 2258265_2258765
+, yeah . 2259065_2259265
+, right ? 2259665_2259765
so that's a basic solution . 2259985_2261265
&-um so an acidic solution is just the opposite . 2262065_2263985
&~y &~y you it's gonna form compounds with the leftover conjugate bases from the acids . 2264405_2270365
+, okay .
+, sorry that's the best I can do . 2272245_2276525
yeah but it's it's just that &~j &-uh definition of the base right ? 2277875_2281635
base is high concentration of OH minus which means that post transition are soluble and that's key so did everyone understand that ? 2281915_2290235
no . 2290655_2290775
okay . 2291535_2291775
so PB two plus where is it ? 2292095_2295415
post transition or transition ? 2295495_2296875
post transition .
post transition . 2297235_2298915
so what is it more soluble in ? 2299275_2301775
from your experiment . 2302155_2303495
what is it more soluble in ?
NAOH right ? 2304855_2305815
sodium hydroxide . 2306555_2307015
what defines a basic solution ? 2307595_2310635
what is the definition of a base ? 2312315_2313655
⌈ xxx ⌉ .

high concentration of OH minus ions right ? 2316575_2319135
so +/. 2319395_2319835
right +/.
+, therefore with an increased concentration of OH minus ions it can &~s form stable complexes with lead right ? 2320455_2328415
because lead's more soluble in NAOH +... 2328555_2330995
is that clear ? 2334445_2335285
no ?
yes ? 2336985_2338185
so what happens to the xxx .

&=laughs if you chose I think &-uh h@l two SO four it would precipitate I think &-um but nitric acid nitrates are always soluble so you don't really have an anion that can be precipitated out . 2365685_2379065
right .
+, okay +... 2379965_2381545
+, but is that clear ?
yeah .
alright .
and my groups three and four are doing question six right ? 2389695_2396735
come on down .
come on down (0.20) .
okay the first part of our question was to present our interpretation of the direction of copper sulfate and potassium iodide . 2420705_2427765
okay &-uh we believe that okay first of all we observed that white PPT in brown solution was observed then after that we believe that the iodide was oxidized from &~I i@l minus to i@l two and copper was reduced from CU two plus to CU plus . 2428545_2447305
&-um and we checked from referring to the CRC handbook we found that the only possible PPT between copper two plus and iodine minus is copper iodine . 2449455_2458335
which is CUI . 2458875_2460455
okay in_order_to confirm our observation &-uh we we give two experiment <to the test> which is copper sulfate plus potassium nitrate &-uh to prove that iodide is needed to form the PPT and sodium sulfate plus potassium iodide to show that CU two plus is needed to form the PPT . 2461065_2484265
when we add &~h &~h hexane to <the solution> the solution forms two layer a purple layer which we assume that is hexane plus iodide and a brown layer which is &-uh water and copper iodine . 2485965_2498445
and when we check again from the CRC handbook we found that &-uh CUI is brownish insoluble and soluble in ammonia . 2499185_2507845
which matches our prediction +... 2508805_2510865
that's it +... 2513505_2514025
alright the second part of our question &-uh it states it is a fact when NH three is added to a +//. 2516025_2524185
a precipitate of &-uh CUCL three the precipitate dissolves . 2524505_2528885
and they want us to offer an explanation based on our investigation of the reaction and the knowledge gained from the class results in part three . 2529225_2535265
alright there's a few things to &-uh keep in mind when we think about the reaction and that is that Lewis acids want to join with the best possible Lewis base that they're &-uh in solution with . 2536715_2547175
&-uh in this reaction CU plus two is a Lewis acid and NH three is a much better Lewis base than the &-uh carbonate . 2548295_2557155
&-uh so therefore the CU plus two will &-uh break away from the carbonate in_order_to join with the NH three to form the &-uh complex ion &-uh shown there which happens to be soluble . 2558165_2569665
and that will cause the precipitate to break up and disappear because the copper's no longer joined with the carbonate . 2570605_2576705
can you raise that up xxx with the bottom . 2577225_2579905
okay . 2580145_2580325
&-uh then we rechecked our data in part three to confirm this . 2581565_2586045
and it's a little hard to read . 2586825_2588245
but &-uh it's a &~ch &=laughs it's a chart &-uh in the left box . 2588565_2592205
it's just saying that we're using a transition cation copper plus two . 2592325_2595265
and in our reference test we &-uh precipitated it . 2596185_2598885
we got a cloudy brew or a cloudy blue precipitate . 2599085_2602065
&-uh the addition of NAOH did not cause the precipitate to go away . 2602825_2606685
but when we added the &-uh NH three the precipitate did indeed go away . 2607265_2611065
any questions +..? 2612285_2613225
could you put your &-uh transparency up from &-uh reaction part four &-um could you explain &-um what role the NH three plays ? 2617285_2627665
(0.5) .

&-uh we basically <processed a reverse reduct@u> . 2630165_2637445

xxx &~i in doing that what what's your observation for the hexane layer ? 2643015_2646095
