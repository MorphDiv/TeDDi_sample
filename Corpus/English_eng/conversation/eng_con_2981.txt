all right, who has the first argument ? 505_1885
was the Crosstown Expressway plan racist or not ? 2065_6185
all right S_three, I saw your hand first . 7425_12005
first of all, state what team you're on and what you're arguing for . 12525_16805
okay, so +... 18925_19065
what are you arguing for, racist or not racist ? 21365_24185
not racist . 24225_24805
okay, go ahead . 24985_25705
we have a statement from document A, it says first line, the Crosstown Expressway was supposed to be for transportation to the north, south, east, and west . 28465_41845
therefore, they're basically trying to make it a easier way of life, not really trying to be racist or classist because they could go to anywhere . 42505_53605
a big point was just, it was easier access to the center of the city, which Edmund Bacon was pushing for . 55405_63605
this is the main part of Philly . 64085_66725
this is what I want you to see, and again during that time, what were they saying about expressways ? 66845_71385
that it's a good way to travel . 72485_75345
it's a good way to travel in and out of the city . 75765_78305
it's easy access for people that weren't living in Philly, so they can come visit, make it commercially attractive, right ? 78685_88085
that was the best spot for them to go there . 88405_91865
that was the best spot . 92265_92905
the expressway ? 93345_94285
yeah . 94385_94665
okay . 95085_95325
where they were trying to build it at . 95665_98125
okay, does anyone have something to support S_one ? 98545_101645
S_two, you're also on the pink team ? 102085_104425
mm-hmm . 104625_105025
all right . 105085_105325
doing so, parks and open spaces also provided appropriate xxx settings for public buildings xxx and squares for public gatherings and quiet spaces for relaxation and places for enjoying the excitement of the crowd . 113335_135615
basically they created places for everybody . 136095_140875
there is no racist or classist into that or intended to be in that . 141815_147655
what you just read from the article, in your own words, translate it a little bit . 148255_153015
basically they created a place where everyone could stay together, have fun or they wanted to go somewhere or host an event . 153155_162455
what place are you talking about ? 163635_165895
parks, open spaces and buildings and stuff . 168415_171955
that were in Center City ? 172275_173495
yes .
okay, so easy access to parks . 174615_179275
people from outside of Philly can enjoy them as well, not just the people living in Philly . 179915_184995
plus with celebration that comes with cultures that basically allowing anyone from out of Philly to celebrate their culture where they came from . 185315_193615
okay, what do you think about what S_two just said, S_three ? 194445_200165
I want to add on it . 200365_203005
you're going to add on to it ? 203305_204025
add on to that and then we'll go to the orange team after this, go ahead . 204105_208105
well, during the process, they're actually trying to enhance the city by actually we can +... 208545_216565
easy transportation from anywhere, like you said how, if someone was from New Jersey, they're just coming to visit, they can actually travel to the north, and if someone that they know that lives in the north and they're trying to get there, easy access to all to get there and stuff . 217525_231225
so how is easy access enhancing Philadelphia ? 231445_235825
making it faster . 237165_238325
making it faster, making Philly faster . 239325_243405
all right, orange team will go after that, S_two . 246505_248225
anybody from anywhere can come in whenever they want without any restrictions or past . 248225_255165
if that doesn't say, hey guys, we're not racist, I don't know what will . 255405_259905
we're going to the orange team now . 260605_264605
S_four, I saw your hand, then S_five . 266085_267525
so again, your argument is for that, the Crosstown Expressway was racist, right ? 269245_273045
okay, go ahead . 273205_274285
this one was the +... 274595_275415
hey guys be quiet . 276395_277395
classist .
what's the article saying ? 277735_282275
the article is saying that this actually facilitates approximately six thousand, five hundred people, and most of them low income families according to the citizen committee to preserve and develop the cost . 282295_299295
if you didn't hear her +... 299975_302075
wait . 302795_303115
does anyone have the same +... 303415_304235
girls I know you did, do you want to add onto it or she kind of said it all ? 304635_307715
okay . 308075_308095
if you didn't hear her, this crosstown expressway would dislocate, push away six thousand, five hundred people that were of what ? 308695_317975
low income . 318895_320515
low income, so again, this would be your argument for that it was a classist plan, right ? 321115_328715
S_five you have something to add to that ? 328775_329815
no, I got a different one . 331305_333145
okay, go ahead . 333985_334405
it was racist because it said it would be making a modern Dixon line, separating the white downtown community from the increasing black community in south Philadelphia . 335605_346465
okay . 348385_350045
are you going to explain it further or ? 351985_356985
I was, but you didn't finish explaining what the Dixon line was . 357725_360165
I think just +... 360605_361345
does anyone know what the Mason-Dixon line is ? 362705_365245
because it's important to know that in context, if you're going to try to use this argument, the Mason-Dixon line . 365585_377945
you separate on the north from the west or south . 378425_384725
it's kind of an imaginary line, right ? 385115_386675
the south is pro-slavery and the north was free . 387115_391415
they're saying that this expressway is creating its own Mason-Dixon line . 391895_398715
it's again, creating one side is for Center City, which is predominantly, what does it say in the article ? 400155_406975
I got to counter that . 407655_413035
counter it ? 413275_414035
yeah .
let's stick with this one . 414835_415795
it's creating a Mason-Dixon line, an imaginary line through Philadelphia . 417095_421695
we got to focus on that argument . 422215_424295
what is it saying though ? 424475_425335
what the argument is saying that they're doing this on purpose, because they want to separate them, so the violence can stay on the black people side and xxx people would xxx tea because they were on their side . 427155_441795
okay, that would be argument for that it was racist, right ? 442435_446255
S_four, do you have anything to add to that ? 446555_448155
you said you had the same thing . 448355_449355
that's it, but it was another one . 451295_452495
you can go ahead . 452695_453635
it was a document piece and said I of course to make xxx . 454145_458525
the argument is for that these houses are going to be destroyed and they're owned predominantly by African Americans . 458925_474005
let's go to the pink team . 474785_477625
S_six, what do you have to say ? 477905_478565
let's remember the Mason-Dixon line was an imaginary line, so even though it did separate the north and the south, that doesn't mean that doesn't mean it was racist . 479815_490295
let him finish . 490295_490795
it doesn't mean it was racist . 491275_492315
it just said it separated north and south . 492675_495175
it never said blacks and whites, because let's remember in civil war, African Americans came above the major Dixon line and lived there, and it's still the same thing . 495355_507695
let's remember in the video, not only African Americans were protesting . 508935_512735
white people were protesting . 513535_514815
hold on, one second . 515355_517495
if there was more, I did not hear anything . 517855_519855
the building of this expressway would essentially do what ? 520515_526155
it would just separate north from south, not blacks and white, not classes +... 526715_530055
the people living in the South Street area were predominantly African American and immigrants, right ? 537105_542685
so it's separating that and Center City was predominantly white . 542965_548565
it's creating a separation there . 549145_550585
if you know, this is during the nineteen-sixties, the definition of segregation is what ? 551065_556785
separation . 557085_558265
separation .
it's a good argument that S_five made . 559785_562465
I had another one . 563305_564385
one second . 564445_564745
alright, go ahead . 564915_565675
can I go to the bathroom ? 567155_568355
yeah, sure . 568615_569135
it said I agree that this is just another attempt at Negro removal xxx . 569795_575455
hey boys, come on . 575575_576455
by saying attempt, it means that building this will be just like trying to +... 576995_581815
I really can't explain it, I can't explain it . 582875_586835
I know what I'm trying to say, I just can't +... 587195_588395
it's all right, I can come back to you if you want . 588535_592015
all right, S_six you had something to say . 592765_593525
it says on document B that the Crosstown Express, which would've linked the Schulykill and Delaware Expressway by cutting down dot, dot, dot only what was necessary to preserve and enhance the city . 594205_608965
that's a argument that it's not doing much to, it's just going to enhance the city . 609225_615185
if they made that hot, if they made that expressway +... 615585_619485
let's say you want to go to Center City and it's probably twelve and it's lunchtime . 620655_629275
you try to go there because it's time for your work again, and all of a sudden you're stuck in traffic because why ? 630035_636135
because a lot of cars are in the way . 636495_640555
we're going to bring it together as a group . 641275_646575
you can abandon your positions and we'll just go +... 647025_651385
how do you feel this Crosstown Expressway ? 652405_655645
what's up ? 655725_656625
hold on, raise your hand . 657265_659105
we'll have everyone's final say, little argument . 659725_663825
S_eight, I haven't heard from you . 664285_665725
racist because in article C, it clearly says +... 666625_669625
it just said they separated the white community from the black community . 670365_674405
how is that not racist ? 675265_675705
S_three, go ahead . 676025_678625
that's not even racist because if you think of it . 679085_684925
remember the map that we saw from Greenglass, how it showed how most people, people lived there, it was their decision . 685945_695365
it was not the city's decision . 695965_697605
so you're going to stick with your views . 697845_701645
S_two, go . 704585_704765
it may not be racist as much, because think about it, as a comparison to modern times, they always separate the boys from the girls and people doesn't see that as racist . 705545_718805
but if people really thought about it +... 719385_721805
no, people don't think it's wrong, but they don't think it's sexist . 721965_725005
they don't think it's sexist, but wouldn't people actually think it is sexist though, to separate the boys from the girls, just as it's not racist to separate the blacks from the whites . 725315_734635
S_six, what do you have to say ? 736995_739395
it's, I have to agree with S_eight . 740135_743415
it is pretty racist because +... 743595_747435
I'm sorry, I mean I'm on the non-racist team, but I still think it's racist because if you think about it, most of the buildings in Center City cost more than what, probably all of us here, most of our parents combined can make in a year . 748225_770745
if you think about it's pretty classist and racist, because most immigrants during that time, they barely could get a college degree . 772465_779905
why ? 780205_780225
because it was pretty racist . 780485_781565
they said okay, anyway +... 781985_785545
we're going to stop it there . 786265_787925
let's do it a little final vote, class vote . 788245_790405
raise your hand, if you feel that this Crosstown Parkway was racist, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten . 791215_801315
we have twelve people out of how many said that it wasn't racist . 802395_808535
one, two, three +... 809175_809875
the people who's on our team . 811055_811875
three, the vote was twelve to three that the Crosstown Parkway, Crosstown Expressway was racist and classist . 813965_821025
with the sweat side it was controversial . 821705_824825
let's get back to your seats, good job guys . 826805_828565
