yeah . 2760_3160
okay . 5060_48620
so, the reason &=breath why we're here is in hopes you guys
&=breath which is all part of my thesis, which will be presented
&=breath so, &=breath just to say that hes@fp I kinda know what I'm
&=laugh <but I haven't r@i> like this is all the material I've
<so &=breath some things> I I didn't practice for this or
&=breath so, when I do the thesis, it'll be much better than this .
but, &=breath <I just> <there is> there is one specific
&=smack &=breath so, &=swallow but please stop me at any time
mhm . 25860_26460
oh . 47120_47590
so so, y@i you you're gonna give a presentation
so +//. 48840_49340
yes . 54290_67160
s@i ask questions whenever you want . 54290_67160
&=breath <I'm not> I'm not really presenting something, I'm
and then I want you guys to sort of tell me what you think
so, hes@fp <I'm not> it is not a lecture or a presentation
oh . 54890_55460
good . 56460_57120
mhm . 59140_59730
it is a seminar . 66250_68090
a +//. 66250_68090
yes, let us put it that way . 67750_69270
a uh@fp &=breath symposium . 68820_71410
&=laugh an interactive symposium . 71670_74880
well uh@fp &=breath +//. 72280_72920
yes, very interactive . 74200_76580
as interactive as possible . 74200_76580
well, t@i t@i technically speaking symposium means
uh@fp . 75470_79580
&=laugh . 75530_76710
does it really ? 79440_80300
a@i uh@fp according to the philosophy department here . 80340_82090
&=laugh . 82450_83570
hm . 82580_82980
oh . 82930_85340
&=laugh . 82930_85340
&=smack hm@fp they used to have wine at their symposia but they
oh . 86290_87790
well, that is nice . 86290_87790
&=throat . 87400_87950
&=swallow does anyone know who this is ? 88020_89410
well, it looks like Dennis Tito . 89200_90810
I thought it was Michael Fou@i Foucault . 91400_94100
&=laugh . 91400_94100
oh, it is not . 91480_92540
Foucault . 93430_94430
&=laugh . 93610_94570
&=laugh . 93650_94350
Foucault . 94390_95190
Foucault . 94480_95100
n@i no, I don't . 95920_96680
nah . 96540_163570
hm@fp Foucault is a French philosopher . 96540_163570
&=breath uh@fp he died in the nineteen eighties, so he he is
&=breath uh@fp and he wrote The_History_of_Sexuality &=breath along
&=breath and, basically his ideas are that &=breath you can take
&=breath and, he &=breath has this three series volume, which I've
&=breath and uh@fp &=breath well, I'll take you to the next slide .
&=breath I think . 96540_163570
okay . 96540_163570
&=smack &=breath his idea is based on genealogy . 96540_163570
so, &=smack if you say that this is sort of like a family tree,
&=breath so, if you say that this is like a great great grand
&=breath he applies this idea to thinking . 96540_163570
&=breath so, if we today think one of four things, &=breath we can
hm . 105270_105660
mhm . 119380_119980
yes . 121880_122390
mhm . 143690_144300
mhm . 162780_167910
hes@fp this is sort of like the proto+science of
don't know what that is . 168340_169480
that what ? 168700_169970
&=laugh . 168700_169970
oh, uh@fp hes@fp I I'm this is very exciting because the
&=smack yeah . 177380_193940
&=smack Foucault i@i is sort of like <the f@i> the father
there is another guy, whose named I can't remember, &=breath who
good . 178290_178840
mhm . 181150_181740
&=smack yeah . 189480_190080
mhm . 193750_194290
uhm@fp so, Foucault has &=breath all of our modern thinking and
&=breath uhm@fp &=smack it goes all the way back to ancient times .
so, each of these boxes is like religion or sexuality or ? 203760_207240
<so each o@i> so, let us say today <we think of> a lot of
&=breath but, in ancient times, it was something good . 206220_227240
&=breath so, if you think of something good &=breath and then this
&=breath and they each are influenced by something different
&=breath throughout all the centuries, &=breath 'till we get to
o@i +//. 206220_227240
oh . 211010_211540
uh+huh . 223830_224250
yeah . 226920_227460
but, I don't even know how to go back now . 227820_229470
understood . 228290_228940
I I see a a tool^box with an arrow button . 229770_232770
I don't know . 231820_232610
yeah . 234570_235100
oh . 234860_235340
no . 235910_237230
that is the whole show . 235910_237230
I shouldn't have mentioned it . 236870_240450
oh . 236870_240450
well, shouldn't have mentioned it . 236870_240450
&=laugh . 236870_240450
oh, let us just do it this way . 240240_255790
&=breath uhm@fp &=laugh yeah . 240240_255790
so, i@i hes@fp in ancient times, homosexuality was something
&=breath and then today, not everyone does this . 240240_255790
everyone has different ideas on it . 240240_255790
&=breath so, he is saying that you can take it from here and
&=laugh . 241250_242960
good . 241370_241770
mhm . 251110_251680
so, each of these boxes represents what one person thinks about
not just a person, but &=breath <it is> it is an idea . 258920_261570
one hes@fp school of thought about something . 260190_262580
right, right . 262030_292470
&=breath so, hes@fp it is always influenced . 262030_292470
so, wh@i &=breath <in this> <this is not i@i> this
&=breath uhm@fp but if you say this is sexuality <or
&=breath but then you have i@i in German, hes@fp in German,
&=breath so, there is even one extreme part of Stoicism that said
not even procreation . 262030_292470
&=breath but then there is other people over here . 262030_292470
school of thought, good term . 262690_263990
mhm . 270090_270610
yeah . 275920_276270
but they died out . 291370_296320
&=laugh . 291370_296320
&=laugh yes . 292520_293370
&=laugh . 292910_293660
that they did . 293390_313440
&=breath uhm@fp &=breath or even the Shakers, you could say it was
they had the same idea . 293390_313440
&=breath they died out . 293390_313440
so, they're no longer there, right ? 293390_313440
&=breath and &=noise hm@fp you had this other idea which continued
&=breath you can also use uhm@fp Darwin's Theory_of_Evolution for
&=breath saying you have species A &=breath and they evolve
&=laugh . 294480_295880
&=laugh . 294530_295030
yeah . 296750_297300
mhm . 307590_308100
mhm . 310820_311540
and and s@i so w@i there will be environmental
hm@fp right . 315800_316510
right . 318540_319180
right . 320020_347010
but, hes@fp <most people> I mean, I think Darwin's theory
uhm@fp because it is just like for species and &=breath <you ca@i>
&=breath but what Foucault is saying is that &=breath hes@fp
<that each gener@i> hes@fp I mean, &=breath in the past, it
&=breath every generation something different happens, &=breath so
mhm . 325910_326420
so, evoluntionism would be <an a> kind of a a
<it is> it is ano@i &=breath &=noise +//. 349080_349950
not so much contradictory . 351120_355360
it works but &=breath &=smack it only to a point . 351120_355360
oh . 354320_358370
so, but this is one . 354320_358370
<and the> genealogy is one way of looking at it and
right . 357220_373180
genealogy is one way of looking at it, evolution is another way of
&=breath but I'm saying &=breath for now we'll just look at
but, &=breath evolution will play a role in a minute . 357220_373180
&=breath all right . 357220_373180
well, you guys know what my whole th@i thesis is about . 357220_373180
you guys have been helping me out for the past &=breath year and
yeah . 363120_363410
hm . 370870_371400
just bits and pieces . 372580_374500
not the +//. 372580_374500
so, the reason why I'm doing the research is not so much to
&=smack &=breath saying that advertising is a reflection of the
so, in the States, &=breath we don't use nudity in advertising
&=breath whereas in Europe, they use it in different areas . 375030_429160
it is more widespread . 375030_429160
&=breath <it is> there is a higher tolerance in Europe
&=breath so, &=breath basically this genealogy idea &=breath will
does everyone buy that ? 375030_429160
&=laugh . 375030_429160
mhm . 422010_422710
sure . 429080_448290
&=breath &=smack I <I know that> I know the Germans
and uh@fp A@i Americans &=breath tend to have r@i r@i
any cr@i +//. 430690_431510
&=smack yeah . 438890_439400
right . 448520_453430
&=breath does anyone else want to add anything at this point ?
Michael, you look perplexed . 448520_453430
nope . 453560_454010
no ? 454240_454760
it makes sense . 454610_455310
well, it just seems awfully specific . 454850_462570
you know, you're looking you specifically at Germany, right ?
Germany and England ? 454850_462570
but all of it ? 454850_462570
oh, okay . 454850_462570
oh, okay . 454850_462570
no, Europe . 458870_459880
oh, no . 459320_460540
that was me . 459320_460540
all of Europe . 460940_461680
I the England is sort of different . 462220_464470
&=breath . 462220_464470
mhm . 464290_464830
uhm@fp <I'll s@i> I'll show later &=breath <one e@i>
&=breath uhm@fp but basically, the US is s@i very, very
<all the European> some Europeans came here &=breath and they
&=breath so . 464760_481120
mhm . 480130_480640
<what percentage of the people in the United_States now are
<I guess you can> hes@fp but I I mean I guess +//. 480960_487780
are descended . 485580_489980
&=breath <you can't> you can't really say . 485580_489980
there is really no way to say . 485580_489980
yeah . 488180_498500
&=breath <it just s@i> seems &=breath uh@fp well, I
but I'm just wondering how, th@i you know . 488180_498500
what was the subject ? 488510_490760
or actually +//. 488510_490760
mhm . 495650_496200
yeah . 496260_497710
you're saying how many . 496260_497710
oh . 497150_501430
I wouldn't necessarily use the word corrupted, but changed . 497150_501430
&=breath okay . 497150_501430
&=laugh well . 499550_502310
&=laugh . 499550_502310
well, let me take you <to this> &=breath &=noise <to this>
&=breath . 501010_504680
okay . 504550_505040
&=noise what I'm concentrating on is who settled <the Un@i>
&=breath and the United_States was settled, I mean, this area, by
&=breath &=swallow other &=breath uh@fp ethnic groups came in in
&=breath most of the middle part wasn't really settled up until
&=breath <I think it was> &=breath I wanna say Oklahoma
I think it was even that late . 505580_536280
&=breath uhm@fp . 505580_536280
&=smack oh . 509210_510110
&=smack yeah . 515160_515640
mhm . 522870_523580
mhm . 529030_529810
what was that late ? 535780_537240
sorry . 535780_537240
the statehood . 537440_540970
I think it was of Oklahoma . 537440_540970
it was the early twentieth century . 537440_540970
&=smack yeah . 538890_539350
hm@fp . 539890_540270
m@i my ancestors went to the uh@fp hes@fp th@i the
it is great, trust me . 540840_550730
&=breath . 540840_550730
yeah . 551510_552090
&=laugh . 551760_552530
'cause that was th@i th@i the leftover places . 552290_554290
&=laugh . 552480_553000
right . 554140_554600
yeah . 554540_554970
well, &=breath this is what I'm concentrating on, but uhm@fp
so, people from Europe came over here and they settled here and
&=breath uhm@fp down around here you have the Spanish and
so, primarily looking at the eighteenth century when all the
&=breath and they're the ones that founded +//. 555260_582510
mhm . 567750_568460
who can I'm I'm just having trouble hearing you
oh . 584150_613110
&=breath so, the Quakers and the Puritans came from Europe to the
and they're the ones that started the United_States_of_America . 584150_613110
&=breath it wasn't really anyone else . 584150_613110
they're the ones that developed the government, they developed the
&=breath uhm@fp they are the ones that started the culture as
they laid the foundation . 584150_613110
&=breath and these people were very religious . 584150_613110
&=breath uhm@fp there is plenty of &=breath v@i uh@fp
mhm . 588260_588710
mhm . 600620_601230
yes . 611580_612150
th@i th@i there is a theory that our form of government
there is <it is> a lot of theories, yeah, that the
Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson were all &=breath <very religious>
uhm@fp &=smack and the United_States is very based in tradition
&=breath and we see that today really &=breath with the government
&=breath where things don't really change in the government . 618770_718880
maybe they change as a society, but not so much in the government
&=smack &=breath uhm@fp &=smack &=breath so, as hes@fp here
so, we know the Puritans and the Quakers settled here . 618770_718880
&=breath and, <the Amer@i> the United_States was founded in
&=breath uhm@fp at this hm@fp &=breath same time, France is going
the French_Revolution . 618770_718880
&=breath after the French_Revolution &=swallow there is another
no guns or cannons . 618770_718880
&=breath and most people don't know this, but there was sort of a
&=breath and at this time people pretty much said, we're gonna do
&=breath and, &=smack <you can read> oh, I've read lots of
&=breath and they sit in the back and they drink and make jokes . 618770_718880
&=breath and then they take all the women to the pub &=breath
and they drink all day . 618770_718880
&=breath and &=breath the man that wrote a book on it, uhm@fp
so, this is like eighteen twenty to eighteen fifty . 618770_718880
&=breath where illegitimate birth rates just soared . 618770_718880
they just really went high . 618770_718880
pla@i +//. 696030_696540
hm . 705010_705660
&=smack yeah . 714760_715240
oh, I didn't know that . 717430_718410
that was in France and Germany ? 718930_720790
sorry . 718930_720790
<now we> <we had> well, we had Victoria Woodhall at
&=breath Victoria Wood uh@fp Hall ran for president on the free
France and Germany . 720230_721230
hm ? 723100_723680
right . 724480_725110
oh, yeah . 725760_726730
&=laugh really ? 727290_728750
yeah, yeah . 727610_781110
<there were> there were some some free love things going
<and that continued until> &=breath so, hes@fp you look here
&=breath they were saying, &=breath hey, we're gonna have free love
and then, here in &=breath the States here and England
&=breath so, hes@fp you have these two really contradictory
&=breath and there is one story that I <like to say> &=laugh
&=breath because +//. 727610_781110
yeah . 734780_735200
mhm . 741960_742610
&=laugh . 753220_754590
&=laugh . 755940_756700
&=smack yes . 764440_765060
oh, yes . 779780_782450
that is Ruskin, I believe . 779780_782450
hes@fp I can't remember the man's name . 782540_801800
&=breath and apparently he never had sex his entire life because he
&=breath so, he was under the impression that &=breath a a
&=breath so, sh@i they they +//. 782540_801800
yes . 787440_787900
&=laugh . 790610_791180
sure . 790730_791250
hm@fp yes . 793650_794330
&=smack yeah . 800830_803330
well, the perfection would be . 800830_803330
&=smack yes . 800830_803330
right . 802340_931590
so, they eventually uh@fp got their marriage annulled and she went
had nine kids . 802340_931590
&=breath but uh@fp he remained single after that . 802340_931590
&=breath so, hes@fp you have these this these very
&=swallow uhm@fp at the same time, &=breath you have the
&=breath so, this is just right after the sexual revolution in
<and then die@i> and then sort of went its own way . 802340_931590
&=breath and the Victorian_Era . 802340_931590
&=breath and during the Famine, &=smack almost the entire
&=breath and Ireland &=breath &=noise &=breath <when they>
and they populate like like rabbits . 802340_931590
and my family, I think, is a good example of that, where &=breath I
&=breath my mom has nine brothers and sisters . 802340_931590
&=breath my great+uncle, at the time of his death, had fifty four
&=breath uhm@fp so, &=breath the Irish and really all of
&=breath whereas, <in the> the lower regions of Europe, in the
they don't really take it &=breath you know exactly what they
they they just use it as guidelines for their lifestyle . 802340_931590
&=breath but Ireland hes@fp if the Church says no birth control,
if the Church says, &=breath no sex unless you're married, no sex

&=swallow so, the Irish all came over here . 802340_931590
and the figure &=breath that I've read, and I don't know if it is

I I I like the nineteenth century very much . 938150_984670
I just finished a nineteenth century operetta . 938150_984670

uh@fp th@i well, y@i y@i you had suggested hm@fp

yeah . 998670_1018250
&=breath I mean, th@i th@i there are so many
&=breath uhm@fp this is the religion &=breath idea is one that I
and &=breath unfortunately there is really not a lot of literature
it is really something &=breath where the whole study of history in

I I find of Americans seem to think it is forbidden to

&=breath yeah . 1024930_1062410
uhm@fp &=smack well, not just sexuality but I mean just the study
&=breath uhm@fp but to go back to what I said earlier about uhm@fp
&=breath so, you can alone say that that influences it . 1024930_1062410
&=breath but I really think the religion is something which really

mhm . 1054780_1055330
yes . 1062680_1063230
and it got ki@i kind of solidified really quickly . 1063090_1109590
I mean, we had only what like a hundred years or so between the

&=breath it is pretty common in Japan to think of the United_States
&=breath uhm@fp but I had a lot of people ask me, oh, yeah, you
and it took me a really long time to kind of &=breath acknowledge
&=laugh because &=breath &=noise I did +//. 1063090_1109590

i@i i@i hes@fp +//. 1083220_1084160

we we yeah . 1104200_1105680
yo@i +//. 1107820_1108300
the the I mean, there is a hes@fp &=noise &=breath hes@fp
<that the Pur@i> and the Puritans had very strong ideals on
&=breath and American government is really strong with tradition .
where, you know, your father did this and &=breath your grandfather
&=breath and that is not something that is really dying out . 1109100_1141180
I mean, &=breath in some ways it has died out in the last twenty
&=breath uhm@fp when I think the sixties and the seventies did
&=breath what do guys think about that ? 1109100_1141180
&=breath . 1109100_1141180
mhm . 1114200_1114780
hm@fp . 1114680_1115180
I think that is a constant . 1142000_1148290
things constantly go in cycles of twenty, twenty five years here .
so <it is> that is +//. 1142000_1148290
mhm . 1144960_1145500
but, that has just in been in the past hundred years or so . 1147570_1152520
it wasn't always that way . 1147570_1152520
maybe . 1152060_1153310
I don't know . 1152060_1153310
uh+huh . 1153230_1153900
okay . 1154750_1175560
&=breath uhm@fp well, the other &=breath c@i concept here
&=breath and, to do that &=breath I'm looking at the population
&=breath these maps are unfortunately not drawn to scale so I can't
can you blow that up ? 1175450_1182100
<it is> it is really hard to see as &=breath or or,
well . 1179760_1180290
oh . 1182290_1182820
I think the answer would be no . 1190450_1191660
&=laugh . 1191870_1192650
or not, okay . 1194300_1196100
oh, there he comes . 1194300_1196100
yeah . 1199900_1203730
<it is a little bi@i> yeah, it is better . 1199900_1203730
population of major cities . 1199900_1203730
<that is a little> that is a little better . 1199950_1201110
is that better ? 1200690_1201560
yeah . 1201050_1201630
oh . 1202550_1202960
&=throat . 1202910_1203550
right . 1203850_1252840
&=breath well, these are all the cities with population
&=breath if you look at England, &=laugh England is just a great
I know that they have a very very dense population, but &=breath
&=breath uhm@fp this is I believe two thousand . 1203850_1252840
it is from the UN . 1203850_1252840
I got this off the UN web page . 1203850_1252840
&=breath uhm@fp now you can see hes@fp how many people are
<it d@i> it doesn't look like it is so compact, &=breath but
&=breath i@i g@i in uh@fp geographical size . 1203850_1252840
&=breath there are three hundred and ninety million people in
there is two hundred and seventy million people here in the States

oh . 1209370_1209840
oh . 1210710_1211410

mhm . 1245540_1246290
hm . 1252340_1252780
what is that big blob near Cologne ? 1253230_1258520
I mean, I'm just curious . 1253230_1258520
what in Europe . 1253230_1258520
I don't know . 1259260_1259930
oh . 1260900_1261380
uh@fp Amsterdam . 1261280_1263270
Hanover . 1261280_1263270
<so it is not h@i> it is Germany . 1263460_1266230
is that just a +//. 1263460_1266230
is that the Ruhr, perhaps ? 1264740_1271610
the Ruhr_Valley ? 1264740_1271610
I'm not very good at that . 1264740_1271610
where is it ? 1270830_1271470
I mean +//. 1270990_1271780
this this they're pointing to this big dot here . 1271820_1274820
yeah . 1273830_1274630
that +//. 1273830_1274630
yeah . 1275370_1277570
i@i i@i i@i <it is> it is a a +//. 1275370_1277570
<I mean it doesn't say> 'cause here is Frankfurt down here and
hes@fp the big cities that you think of are in other places . 1275740_1281550
so I'm just wondering +//. 1275740_1281550
yeah . 1280580_1288670
s@i so, there &=smack there is one chunk of hes@fp
hm . 1286750_1287200
hm . 1288860_1289360
<I was thinking> you keep this in mind how how many
that they're really close together . 1289890_1329600
there're lots of universities . 1289890_1329600
lots and lots of people together in a very small space . 1289890_1329600
&=breath but now &=breath here is the US . 1289890_1329600
&=smack &=breath now, hes@fp think about it to scale, where
and you have &=smack &=breath all of those people &=breath
granted, there're mountains here, but &=breath <there is>
I mean, look at all of mant@i Montana . 1289890_1329600
&=smack yeah . 1293940_1294470
hm . 1306650_1307070
hm . 1307100_1308630
mhm . 1307100_1308630
oops . 1313370_1314160
yeah . 1313890_1314380
mhm . 1325250_1325850
that that would explain the cultural differences between us
there is a hes@fp a physical gulf between us . 1329540_1337850
or, &=smack not gulf . 1329540_1337850
but +//. 1329540_1337850
yeah . 1336740_1337360
but it also kind of relates to the whole tradition idea where
&=breath and the people that are living in cities, &=breath
'cause they're +//. 1338280_1349240
<that is> that is not true . 1348610_1355860
all right . 1348610_1355860
what is the percentage of the population that lives hes@fp uh@fp
yeah, maybe not that they don't live in cities, but they don't live
because there are so many cities . 1355770_1364660
and &=breath I mean there is only +//. 1355770_1364660
I don't know . 1356170_1357100
hes@fp yeah . 1359340_1360760
a hundred and fif@i +//. 1359730_1360580
no, I I +//. 1361140_1362170
I mean, look look at that from Philadelphia to uh@fp +//. 1364560_1367640
right . 1367190_1371390
hm@fp really that that hes@fp that one s@i area
&=breath but +//. 1367190_1371390
yeah . 1367540_1368110
okay . 1367590_1369650
well, that is one super city af@i +//. 1367590_1369650
<but that is a> hes@fp <there is> I think, wi@i
so, and <it is not> uhm@fp &=breath &=smack it is not very far
so, I think that is not &=breath not necessarily true that
well +//. 1388260_1388720
so hes@fp s@i +//. 1390080_1390900
now, <I have s@i> I have statistics on how large cities are .
&=breath Pittsburgh has got a little more than two million people .
is that what you're &=breath +//. 1390170_1397360
no, that is not my point . 1395820_1403180
<that Pittsburgh> no . 1395820_1403180
<I'm saying that they're> <is concentrated> right,
okay . 1397160_1398010
s@i +//. 1397160_1398010
but that most of the population is condensed here . 1398120_1401140
that is where major cities are . 1402260_1403240
where all the major cities are . 1403480_1412720
and California, right . 1403480_1412720
<I agree> I agree with that . 1403480_1412720
&=breath but as a country, &=breath you have to think of how
right . 1403730_1404080
yeah . 1403780_1404140
so i@i s@i hes@fp +//. 1404780_1405480
you're not . 1411990_1422330
I mean, if the bulk of the population isn't living there, then
as a country, you're &=breath the bulk of the population is
but what about the government where we have representation <from
<that is> <that is> I mean, we have been . 1425680_1435510
Congress is by population and &=breath everybody has two
so, wh@i I mean, wh@i I don't see your point . 1425680_1435510
I don't think that +//. 1425680_1435510
mhm . 1431750_1432370
well, but I mean , everybody in the country is influenced by
what &=breath and by thought j@i that comes out of there
you know, that is where the advertising is ? 1434890_1444000
I mean, isn't that what +//. 1434890_1444000
yeah, right . 1440010_1442410
so +//. 1440010_1442410
no . 1446030_1464350
I well, I'm trying hes@fp to say more or less that like
y@i uhm@fp +//. 1446280_1446900
hm@fp . 1450910_1451280
I think that is wrong . 1463990_1467950
I think y@i you need to check that . 1463990_1467950
I'm pretty sure that is wrong . 1463990_1467950
okay . 1468020_1468430
well, hes@fp we we might say that in Europe you can't escape
and we have a very different idea, I think, <of wh@i> hes@fp
I mean, &=breath in Japan, their idea of a small city is four
they call this a small town . 1479840_1505210
&=breath and, I mean, it just t@i t@i completely affects
&=breath uhm@fp &=breath and here, you can say that you live in a
&=breath and I think that &=breath you know +//. 1479840_1505210
mhm . 1491100_1491590
mhm . 1495460_1495940
mhm . 1497300_1497800
well, I don't think you would say that you're living in a city . 1504650_1520190
I mean, these are areas where there is more than a hundred and
&=breath <according to the U@i> according to the U_S_Census .
but, &=breath hes@fp I would say that there is only maybe
and you're talking like Philadelphia, New_York, &=breath
&=smack well +//. 1506850_1507570
right . 1508590_1509150
<a dozen citi@i> no, they're they're +//. 1518330_1520390
but you're talking huge metropolis areas . 1520420_1522820
<what are you> define that . 1522530_1527010
huge is not a quanti@i quantitative amount . 1522530_1527010
what . 1528210_1532240
&=breath if you're talking about like where everything is happening
density . 1529920_1530650
so, I mean <you have to define you're> hes@fp you have to
&=breath but, I <I think that is the> well, you'll
uh+huh . 1539980_1547960
well, what I mean what do you guys think about applying
well, yeah . 1546070_1547050
I think +//. 1546070_1547050
th@i yeah, the idea of whether or not <how e@i> <in what>
uhm@fp &=breath but I'm I'm just not sure that what you're
mhm . 1552700_1553370
why ? 1557250_1557850
yeah . 1561200_1561660
okay . 1562070_1562550
yeah . 1562250_1563640
uh@fp e@i I +//. 1562250_1563640
okay . 1562450_1571140
&=breath uhm@fp I I guess I have two things . 1562450_1571140
uh@fp why why uhm@fp well, one thing . 1562450_1571140
why uh@fp why do you think the density affects your how
uhm@fp well, I mean, I can tell you from mo@i having moved
&=breath uhm@fp and ho@i just being, you know, <you look out>
and after a while you kind of stop worrying about whether your
and just things like that . 1571940_1609300
&=breath uhm@fp &=breath &=smack and the necessity for, you know,
and so, you know, the idea of being naked &=breath in front of
&=breath uhm@fp so, I <I th@i> <that is> that is
I don't know if it is the same in Europe . 1571940_1609300
uhm@fp &=breath but +//. 1571940_1609300
okay . 1576660_1577210
mhm . 1584390_1584950

mhm . 1605210_1605650
mhm . 1605370_1605980
so, I hes@fp I I I see that there is a geographical
hes@fp <how to tie it in> or, no . 1609550_1641190
no . 1609550_1641190
hes@fp h@i how to lock it in firmly to your thesis, to to
&=breath but uhm@fp &=smack I I in the &=smack areas
you know, o@i one hour's drive north of here . 1609550_1641190
and and there is a cultural difference, and &=breath uhm@fp
uh+huh . 1621540_1622090
mhm . 1641180_1641730
now, hes@fp when I was in Germany I visited the h@i hicks who
and &=breath and they I think they had to make an an
they had to work at it . 1641650_1667220
&=breath wh@i whereas in here <it is> <it is> it is
if if you're not &=breath near a city, you're going to
unless you worked at uh@fp watching WQED and things like
mhm . 1660720_1661320
okay . 1667850_1698460
well, I know being from Philadelphia and coming here, it is
and even then it is really different . 1667850_1698460
I know . 1667850_1698460
I have &=breath a friend who is gay who left Pittsburgh because he
and he went to Philadelphia where we have a gay population and
whereas here, &=breath you don't really . 1667850_1698460
it is not as strong . 1667850_1698460
&=breath but, I think Pittsburgh is a very unique place because so

if +//. 2013650_2014540
<you don't> no, you don't need to track peop@i individual

wait . 2026430_2031520
but . 2026430_2031520
<so y@i> hes@fp so, you need to draw circles around which data

e@i essentially, that is right . 2031390_2036910
<you draw a sim@i> hes@fp <it is> <it is> hes@fp it

if if if you become a a kind of sociologist that

&=laugh . 2077390_2078420
could be . 2078450_2080150

right, right . 2102530_2112760
yeah , this is slides I did an hour ago . 2102530_2112760
I I <I &=breath seriously uhm@fp don't have> I've

okay . 2110360_2110960
all right . 2111770_2114160

right . 2114200_2114740
&=breath . 2114200_2114740
okay . 2114820_2115360
n@i the next step would be for me to go through the data and
what I don't wanna see the data . 2121050_2126150
I wanna see the idea, and then the data supports the idea . 2121050_2126150
right . 2125710_2147250
&=breath uhm@fp but, as I said, I only did this because we needed a

very much true . 2163710_2164660
&=smack yeah . 2164720_2165100
it might help to just have some sort of number . 2165770_2185580
I mean, because you're right . 2165770_2185580
it is sort of a problem that <the slides aren't to scale> the

wel@i +//. 2179860_2180320
right . 2183710_2184390
or +//. 2184220_2184660
well, no . 2184730_2188010
I I think it is more important is the number of people who

yeah . 2188670_2189210
well . 2189360_2190610
or what +//. 2189360_2190610
yeah, or per@i percent of population actually is really the

you don't have to be a &=breath +//. 2244300_2254820
