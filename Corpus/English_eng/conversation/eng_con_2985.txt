okay . 755_915
all right, S_one, let's start us off . 1135_3315
okay, so we're going to look at document C . 3815_5035
it's okay if you don't have the rest of the chart filled out, but I know you've all read it and you've annotated . 5215_9195
so, let's chat about document C, we're going to add another layer to this . 9395_13295
all right, S_one, what did you write down ? 13415_14635
how did Islam spread so quickly ? 15075_17075
according to document C ? 17115_18055
I wrote down that it expanded violently at first, but then it started to think of more peaceful solutions to conquering land . 18845_29305
okay, so let's be specific . 30365_31825
so what in document C lead you to believe that ? 32265_34485
it said most of the nobles or of Iraq negotiated ways to have a peaceful solution to converting to Muslim . 36145_58305
okay, so where does it say that they're converting to Islam ? 58945_62085
where the nobles would, if they cooperated with the Muslims that they would get paid . 63415_71475
okay . 72255_72375
what lines are you looking at ? 72535_73375
it says that in line +... 74095_78615
how many from the bottom, or whatever ? 79715_81095
the seventh line it said stipends were granted to Persian or Armenian nobles who cooperated with the Muslims in Iraq . 82945_96105
okay . 96645_96745
and what's a stipend ? 96925_97585
it was a payment . 98325_99405
okay, so S_one is saying they're getting paid and you said, are they converting to, yeah, they're going to be converting to Islam . 99925_107085
okay, where's your proof of that ? 107505_108625
who can help them out ? 108845_109505
where is their proof that they're converting to Islam and they're getting paid ? 109805_112745
okay, S_two . 113345_114065
it says pretty much the last line the individuals were required to embrace Islam in order to receive their stipend, and the stipend is their money . 114185_122685
okay . 123425_125605
S_three .
I can also support that with document B going back to the thing about the food and stuff, which is a type of payment . 125605_137685
okay . 138755_138995
but in this case, in document B, who's doing the paying ? 139195_145955
the Greeks . 149095_150035
okay, right, or the Christians is that right ? 150955_154595
they're paying he and each of his men shall also pay one dinar every year . 154775_159575
is that right ? 160035_160395
yes . 160775_161415
okay . 161555_161775
and then in document C, they're receiving some money . 162985_167505
okay .
did you kind of see that ? 169665_170345
so, yeah there's definitely cash . 171405_173125
there's economics involved in both of these documents, right ? 173285_175985
maybe some differences between who's exchanging the money though, okay ? 176225_180445
S_four ?
I don't think document C could be trusted enough to develop a platform . 181285_187605
why ? 187965_188545
well, because first off the time period, and then a person who wrote it Fred, he was a part of a book . 191275_203455
and the whole point of a book is to like, say stuff that is away from what people, what most people think . 204315_213135
so really, he could just be doing it to make his book more interesting . 213955_217515
oh, who has some response to S_four ? 219425_221405
okay, so now we're talking about the source of this, all right ? 221465_225025
S_nine ?
it doesn't show, I'm agreeing with S_four, it doesn't show where he got his information from, or anything . 225145_233205
okay, but what are his, he's got some street cred . 233485_235665
what's his credentials ? 235805_236925
S_five ?
he specializes in early Islam, and early Islamic expansion . 238165_243525
okay, and what else ? 243985_245665
S_two ?
he's a historian at the University of Colorado . 248875_251175
Chicago . 251755_252795
Chicago, right ? 253935_254355
that's a big university . 254495_255615
okay .
it's accredited . 256875_257615
okay . 258295_258375
but so who's like S_four and S_nine ? 259195_261795
nope, not going to trust him . 261875_263415
he's just writing stuff that goes against traditional thought . 263635_267255
oh . 267535_267935
who says, come on, this guy knows his stuff . 268635_271535
he teaches . 271655_271955
he's a professor . 272195_272735
oh, so we're split . 273995_275435
oh, okay . 276745_276865
so if let's say, if you think this document is pretty reliable, how is Islam spreading ? 278585_284925
according to this document ? 285025_286045
kind of go back to what S_one is saying . 286265_287705
and then we'll talk about you doubters out there . 287905_289965
yeah, S_six . 291005_291405
they are in a way bribing people . 291705_293405
oh, okay . 293725_294905
tell me how this is a bribe . 295305_296465
because if they convert, then they get money . 296645_300125
okay . 300425_300665
and prove that . 300785_302265
where does it say that ? 303685_304785
we kind of looked at the bottom, where towards the top of the document, are they also talking about this ? 305065_310445
when do they get money ? 313005_316505
let's look at the third line . 317025_318485
it says there is an established system of stipends or direct salary payments . 320345_327985
okay . 329385_329625
to people who practice the granting of gifts . 329985_332645
uh-huh . 333615_334015
and it says to who ? 334175_335375
after that . 336655_337275
to warriors in the Islamic Army . 337535_339975
oh, okay . 340055_340775
all right .
S_seven ?
so, they could have more people joining the army because they're like, well, if I serve in the army, they can get paid so they can, so they have money . 341155_354035
yeah, all right . 354335_355235
does that sound good ? 355255_355895
I don't know, it sounds good to me . 356335_357995
okay, so what are some similarities between all three of these documents ? 358435_362075
just because S_six and S_seven hit on this, I want to make sure we get this . 362335_365355
what do we, what do we see ? 366355_367175
what's the theme potentially ? 367375_368735
S_eight ?
in document C ? 369335_371935
yeah, so what do they all have in common ? 372395_374415
what are they getting stipends for ? 374915_377555
what did S_seven mention ? 377895_378775
for converting to Islam . 378855_380235
and if they serve in what ? 380475_382375
the military . 382475_382755
ah, okay . 383075_383855
so if you're a warrior, what do you do for your living ? 384115_386295
okay, you fight . 387515_388235
right ? 388515_388535
so we have some similarities there . 388615_390095
good .
okay .
what else ? 392015_393195
if we think this is reliable . 393455_394875
so basically what is this guy saying ? 395275_397215
what is the reason why these people, why Islam is spreading ? 397455_401235
right, if we're looking at the map, it's okay you can leave it . 401355_404155
so what is Fred saying ? 404895_407395
what are we, what are we trying to say here ? 410535_414295
what is a stipend ? 414915_415895
a direct payment . 416355_418955
so what is his basic argument ? 419295_420835
what's a big reason why Islam is spreading ? 421035_423615
S_nine, and then S_seven . 424135_425915
you pay people to convert . 425915_427155
ah, okay . 427415_427995
so what do we call that ? 428275_429715
when we got money ? 429855_430815
what ? 432135_432335
bribing .
okay, but I'm thinking of a word that starts with an e, an e reason . 432715_437395
aha, I hear whispers . 439035_440215
okay, good it's an economic reason, right ? 441875_444175
kind of connected to these warriors . 444395_446215
all right, so who believes Fred ? 446595_449055
who says Fred, I think the University of Chicago is pretty good, and I think it was economic . 449535_455655
it sounds good to me . 455895_456935
all right, xxx . 457455_458935
oh, S_eight what's this mean ? 459135_462135
it's just the year after Islam expansion, just kind of like, wow, what's up ? 464475_473335
it's almost +... 473575_474015
what are you talking about ? 475155_477015
what year after Islam expansion ? 477075_478295
it's written in nineteen-eighty-one . 478455_480035
and the end of the expansion is around seven-fifty, eight hundred . 480435_484135
yeah . 484415_484695
so how many years has it been ? 484895_485935
at least twelve-hundred, eleven-hundred . 486015_488555
sure .
okay . 488955_489215
so you're saying it's too much time . 489475_490835
so your team S_four, Fred doesn't know what he's talking about . 491385_494525
okay .
what could be good about nineteen-eighty-one ? 497185_499065
yeah ? 499905_500025
you would have more access to more documents . 500685_503425
right ? 504085_504105
potentially . 504265_504765
okay . 505245_505425
and his background, S_ten ? 505785_507345
all I was going to say was, all the technology to add to +... 507465_513365
okay . 513425_514245
oh, so what do we think, who would include document C in their reason how Islam expanded ? 515705_521105
clearly not S_four . 521605_523485
I love it . 523485_525065
really, xxx ? 525645_525785
okay, no, you're fine . 526045_527145
oh, but S_eight, you are going to include him ? 527645_529025
okay, who's S_four, he's like, nope . 529585_533565
oh, okay xxx . 534105_534765
S_nine .
S_nine .
yeah . 534845_535805
all right . 538085_538805
S_eleven, why ? 538925_540345
because it's common knowledge known about the Islamic conquest had to be coming for a reason . 543345_547405
oh, okay . 548985_549145
but then let's look at document A, could it be common for a reason that they were maybe hyping themselves up ? 550225_556845
ooh, I don't know . 557105_559045
but S_eleven's like no, had to be common for a reason . 559765_562105
it had to be true . 562245_562905
I don't know, what do you guys think ? 564105_565265
ah, I just don't know . 566565_570605
what do you think S_twelve ? 571075_572135
how do you think Islam spread so quickly ? 572135_574455
what's your final answer ? 575055_576275
I said, Islam spread because of their trade routes, they were access to most part of the populated world back then . 579295_591095
also the missionaries . 591715_593055
they sent a lot of missionaries throughout their trade routes . 593215_596535
but according to the documents, if you're just using the documents, how do you think Islam spread so quickly ? 596945_604005
all those things could definitely be true, but we specifically didn't talk about missionaries in the docs . 604245_609265
well also Muhammad's influence over the people, (be)cause he started the payment for the military and with that more people joined it and more people will have more reason to join it, so it's probably going to logically be the most powerful military at that time . 609595_628295
and they'll conquest, more land than anyone, in the Roman Empire . 628475_632715
so do you think they were super violent, like document A and brutal ? 633655_637455
or do you trust document B, or do you think people only fought to get the dollars ? 637585_642365
I don't really +... 642985_644845
I don't really trust documents A and C, just because I don't know, I feel like document B was trustworthy because it was an actual document, but A and C is just, I don't know . 645505_659845
what don't you like about C ? 660165_661125
the way he does doesn't give any, how did he find this information ? 666665_670825
did he go places around the world to ask people how did Muhammad do all this stuff ? 671385_679345
how did the Islamic Empire do all this stuff ? 679405_681025
so it doesn't really give me any information how he found this . 681325_683605
okay . 683985_684165
but at least he was a historian, right . 684405_686965
and he specializes in early Islam and early Islamic expansion, right . 687005_690545
if you kind of believe his credentials, yeah . 690545_692425
