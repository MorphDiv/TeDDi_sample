But +... 38950_40325

Right . 54000_54200
And then, he'll say, he'll be like, like +"/.

Maybe things are different there . 92546_94583
A little bit, haha . 94583_96909
yea you know he comes across kind of normal too the first time . 96909_101700
Kind of normal ? 101700_103000
Well, the first time I met him, he was like normal . 103000_104858
No, I think, so like, I don't know where it comes from, because
He he acts like . 109937_116746
he acts very like +... 116746_119513
He acts very respectable in front of other people and like +... 119513_124714
I feel like . 124714_126943
Do I just bring out the worst of people or something ? 126943_132145
No, It's just that like +... 132145_133176
With all the stuff that he's saying, there's no way you could bring
haha, I don't know, it's just , uh I guess it's just the way he is,
I mean like, Zander like . 149000_152838
Oh yeah . 152838_155514
Naw, but I mean, you didn't bring that out . 155514_158485
That's very hard, it was already there . 158485_160901
maybe it's just +... 160901_165000
Maybe it's a European thing . 165000_167000
Well, where's Zander, where's zander from ? 167000_170146
Well, from America . 170146_172000
But he was in Europe so he gets +... 172000_173500
Yea, hehehe +... 173500_174000
Oh ok . 174000_175507
Somehow, by like diffusion . 175507_178000
Daha ! 178000_179900
I don't know if that's how it works, but yea, I, I think that they
mmhmm . 189000_190000
yea . 190000_192000
I think that they're similar and that +/. 192000_193150
why +... 193150_193450
+, and you should stop hanging out with them . 193450_195064
I don't think so, no, but +... 195064_201800
hhmhhmm . 201800_203000
You can't just cut off a tie with a person like that, I mean +... 203000_208000
When's the last time you talked to zander ? 208000_210782
Okay, that's a different scenario +... 210782_214500
yea +... 214500_215608
Well, that was very much a mutual thing, like, if this was with
I just don't like, uh, like what he's trying to do . 225500_230351
I question like his, intentions . 230351_235212
His motives . 235212_236592
Cause like, is he really your friend, or is he trying to get in
I just uh, it just seems, a little odd . 243231_251762
I mean, most friends don't act like that . 251762_254000
Maybe Kushtrim doesn't know how to be friends to a girl . 254000_258942
mmnnn +... 258942_263195
But like, what am I supposed to do with that ? 263195_265757
Like, you can't just be like +"/. 265757_271080
+" You don't know how to be a friend . 271080_272733
I can't . 272733_273764
yea, well, maybe when he says something, that's inappropriate for
+" I want to sleep with you . 282680_284372
or +"/. 284372_285115
+" are you good in bed ? 285115_285652
or something like that, then I'd say it's uh, you know, it seems
+" Kushtrim, that's not something one friend would say to another
Maybe not like that, but something similar . 295312_301461
I don't think friends should, mnnnmnhhh . 301461_304145
He's just uh, I'd say comes off as a different guy, than he
Well, that's cuz you're a guy . 315662_319544
That's true . 319544_321895
So when he met you, he treats you like he probably would treat
How many times have you hung out with him when it was just like you
You and Kushtrim . 331926_335436
Like this semester ? 335436_337460
No, till now . 337460_340637
I don't know . 340637_342373
Four ? 342373_344064
Not a lot . 344064_346210
More than five ? 346210_347946
I would say about five . 347946_350462
About five ? 350462_351206
Okay . 351206_352692
But then, I think there's been an equal amount where I, I spent
Ok . 367719_368628
Well, when you guys are alone, has it always been wierd, or have
that time he tried to kiss you, that count as one ? 376719_387697
No, it doesn't actually . 387697_390670
Okay +... 390670_391951
Are you okay about that ? 391951_394923
I didn't say anything . 394923_396159
Well, if that's when it was wierd then +... 396159_402354
No I don't, I didn't feel +... 402354_404294
I feel like since I came back from Spain, like, it's become like
mmm +... 414985_415744
Like, do you know, the first thing that Kushtrim said to me, was,
+" Europe's made me, like, like so much more beautiful . 429558_434426
or something like that, like since I came back +... 434426_437277
hmmm . 437277_438020
and I was like, oh, thanks Kushtrim, I missed you ! 438020_440908
But, it was still awkward . 440908_445921
It's better than taking that approach he took last night . 445921_449841
to get in your pants . 449841_452713
Well, he did have a girlfriend, didn't he ? 452713_458286
Yea, maybe that's why it helped to keep him full . 458286_463033
(be)cause he had her to focus on . 463033_467120
I think that he needs someone . 467120_469449
He claims he doesn't though . 469449_474073
Yea, well, nobody's going to claim that they need someone . 474073_476862
Why would want to need someone . 476862_481420
I think he would say . 481420_483261
That you need someone ? 483261_484831
Yea . 484831_485324
Kushtrim, yea, he would be like +"/. 485324_487886
+" Man, I'm craving someone . 487886_490487
like . 490487_491518
i mean, I know he's up front, but that's kinda like . 491000_493024
a knock against his like, I don't know, his manhood, like his
he needs someone, like he's like, he needs to be dependent on
he feels alone and he can't handle himself, he has to have a girl ?506770_513086
I mean, i don't know what a relationship does to him so +... 513086_521425
I'm uncertain, although it really might really help him out, i
That's it, how long had he been going out with her ? 531373_540744
I think it was a couple months, i'm sure . 540744_545052
Is that longer than you pictured ? 545052_551602
What ? 551602_554119
Shorter than you would think, or Longer ? 554119_555894
What do you think with Kushtrim ? 555894_560352
Well, like, Kushtrim talks a lot about, like, marriage, and stuff,
So, I've told you about this stuff, right ? 569535_574265
Yea, I think so . 574265_575956
Briefly . 575956_577692
How old is he ? 577692_582188
I think twenty four . 582188_582726
Uh huh . 582726_584501
And like I understand where he's coming from, but I don't know +...
What do you feel ? 589990_591188
Like maybe he feels that his clock's ticking . 591188_591931
Yea . 591931_593212
He needs to find someone . 593212_594260
Spread the seed, like evolutionary psych . 594260_597958
Oh God +... 597958_598551
