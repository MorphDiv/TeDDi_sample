what we are going to do today is to try .
to make those units of measure you were using .
and by the end of the day, you were all .
using them very skillfully .
they were making sense to you, .
and you were getting very accurate measurements .
but, I don't think the way we were measuring, .
is exactly the way that most people measure .
in the everyday world .
do you see carpenters walking around .
and they're wearing their tool belts .
and then right next to them, .
+" oh, yah, my little bag of inches when they want .
to measure something, they pull out their little .
inches and they lay them down .
and then when they are done measuring, .
+" oh, yup, I wanted that board eighteen inches long .
+" Yup, eighteen inches, and they mark the difference .
and scoop those inches up .
and tuck them back in their tool belt .
no, they use uh um they use a um .
rule ruler .
okay, they might use a ruler .
what else might they use ?
um um a tape measure .
a tape measure .
that is what I mean .
well, could they use a ruler also ?
yeah .
yeah, Vanessa ?
a yardstick .
they might use a yardstick .
why do they use a ruler, a tape measure, .
or a yardstick instead of like we were doing ?
we were getting very accurate measurements .
we each had our little unit of measurement .
why don't they just carry around a .
little pocket of inches ?
where you know, .
they could lay them out just like you did ?
they would use a +...
and have to keep on laying them out, and um .
and they don't have enough well .
um them over and over and over .
right, now that strategy was successful, it made sense .
if you ran out of units, you went back and you .
got the ones behind it and you kept putting them ahead .
but, do you think that was the fastest way to measure ?
we have a wide variety of measurement tools up there .
and that is just what I want to talk to you about .
I want to know why people use something like this .
instead of the things I gave you last week ?
it's easier ?
why is it easier ?
sara said one reason it is easier, .
is cuz they are all connected together .
do you think it would have been easier .
for you to measure .
kevin, if your Kevins were all connected together ?
yeah, it would .
yup, it would be easier because um like um .
they're all connected together .
and um, if they were like um like how, .
if they went through like the process of .
how they made those things, um, .
it could, it would work good, because +...
those things, um, like, um, the things that .
we're using, um, tho, um those are, um, .
those aren't very good .
because, sometimes .
we don't really get the right answer .
because sometimes one of them may be under one of them .
or maybe on top .
so maybe if we were laying our strips, .
even if we were trying to be very very careful, .
maybe part of a Justin might overlap the next .
justin that you laid down next to it .
or maybe, when Alex was laying down his Alexs, .
maybe just a little bit of space .
would end up between the first and second Alex .
and maybe you wouldn't notice .
so not only is this easier, um .
it's more accurate is what I hear Nathan saying .
it would be harder to make a mistake because, .
do these inches slide apart or wiggle or overlap ?
no .
nope, they're all ?
um, connected .
they are all connected together and they are all even .
you said that was important .
something like right here ?
well, what if we um were going to tell Brittany .
how um how wide the, the height chart is ?
um, what would you do with this ?
to tell her that even though we can't fold it or bend it .
what will we get ?
probably go like this .
and then since it is right here on this one, .
like it's um, it's seven inches and one sixteenth .
nathan is using something that he knew about .
measurement tools like rulers and yardsticks and stuff .
and he's saying well usually those .
real little lines on there are sixteenths .
so when he saw that this ah growth chart .
went to that first little line past the seven, .
he thought it was seven and one sixteenth .
but we checked, and there aren't sixteen of those .
spaces in an inch, there are eight of those little spaces .
so, if it went one of those little spaces past the seven, .
it would be seven and ?
two probably .
two what ?
two um, two sixteenths .
does this uh, does this ruler show marks that show .
where a sixteenth is ?
no .
no, but what are the marks on here mean ?
it does show you where .
well, like uh half and then a half of a half .
those two would be a half of a half .
and then these ones would be a half of a half of a half .
and what would we call that ?
a half of a half of a half ?
how many pieces would that give you .
if you took the half .
three pieces .
um , no .
four .
what I am going to do is, .
I am going to make a big drawing of what .
we were seeing on just part of the yardstick, okay ?
here is um the line that has the number seven by it .
okay, and then there is, I want to make sure .
that I made this exactly like this ruler .
and then Okay .
cuz why are we making all these lines .
all these different sizes, Nathan ?
these two lines mean where the inch stops and starts .
then the second one is just where it's half .
then the two other longs, then the two other ones .
that the are long, but are the third longest, .
they are that, they're, they're showing where the half .
on this side would be, um where a half of this half, .
um on this half of the side it would be, .
and where the half of the half would be on this side .
and then these would show where the half of um .
this would be on this side and this one would show .
the half of where this one would be on this side .
and this one would show the half of this one .
on this side, and this one would show the half on um, .
this side this one .
so everyone of these lines is a half ?
um, a half of the one that was before it .
hmm, are you, so the only ?
are going to say is half, .
can I call all of these a half ?
no .
they must have other names, right, so .
this would be probably the half .
okay .
probably the half .
okay .
do you see what um, Nathan is saying to you ?
he's saying that that these long lines are the inch lines .
everybody's eyes should be up here .
these are, so this, these longer lines .
are where an inch would begin and end .
so if something was exactly from here to here long, .
it would be an inch long .
nathan says that, he thinks that if it goes .
from seven to eight it is an inch, .
but I'm looking at the ruler, and it says to me, eight .
so how come it is not eight inches ?
see, like this, if, let's say you are going like this .
it is even the same .
but it would be only one inch .
this time what Nathan did, .
I don't know if you can see with his fingers, .
he started the beginning of the metal clip at the six .
on the ruler and it stopped at the seven .
and he's saying, well, .
just because it stops at the seven there, .
it is not seven inches long, .
it is one inches, one inch long Nathan says, .
because it started at the six and went to the seven .
every, every, everywhere where um, everywhere .
if you like measure it where it goes to the um, .
the next number, is one inch .
do you think Nathan is right ?
if it starts anywhere on the ruler, .
anywhere on the ruler, um, where, where you start, .
and it goes to the next number, .
and that's where you, and that's where it stops .
that's a inch .
because um, because you um, if it goes to here, .
it goes like from here to here ?
you can't that um, you can't say that is thirty one inches long .
because that means that you have to go from .
here all the way to here .
do you believe Nathan, do you think he's right ?
yeah .
let's just ah, for a minute, .
going back to Nathan's trying to sort out .
for himself and for you, .
katy, come in close and sit still .
um, what all those little lines are whatever .
because remember the very first day, .
we talked about measurement and I said, .
+" what if I didn't have a ruler ?
you said +"/.
+" Ijust make a homemade ruler .
and I said +"/.
+" Well, how would I do that ?
+" Well, you need some stiff paper or cardboard .
+" And then you would have to put the numbers on .
+" And all those little lines .
and you would have to get them in the right order .
so lots of you knew before we started .
talking about measurement at all that rulers .
had numbers and rulers had lots of little lines .
and they have a special order .
but what we need to figure out is, .
what that special order is .
what Nathan is saying is, .
that the reason that you look at a ruler, .
you see all different sizes of little lines ?
nathan is saying, imagine this: .
imagine the ruler, have of seven, and have of the eight, .
and all the little lines dividing that inch .
up into smaller parts, .
were the same size and the same length, he says, .
how could you tell where half of that inch was ?
who could show me where a half inch is ?
the seven and a half .
between the seven and the eight .
who can show me where it would be, Jillian ?
come up and show us .
okay, can you show me where half an inch would be ?
right here .
on which of those lines ?
this one .
okay, Jillian is suggesting to you, .
that this line right here is half way .
do you think she is right ?
yes .
ok .
four from the inside .
four, okay .
I was saying if, if they had it um .
jillian kind of did it um, fast .
but um, if you had to like um, do it a lot of times ?
then it would be kind of hard, .
because you would have to um, keep on, .
like counting, like doing that, and then um .
and keep on marking it and stuff .
okay, how, how quickly can you find that half .
way point there ?
it is easy because, um, you just have to look for, um, .
the second biggest line and it is usually right here .
nathan is suggesting to you that this .
one, two, and then three, so this would be the mark .
that would make it three eighths .
and then this , this would be five eighths .
because one, two, three, four five, and then six, seven .
so the seven would be seven eighths .
this is confusing for me .
this is confusing for me .
why do we need all those little marks .
on a ruler or a yardstick ?
don't most things we measure just stop on a number .
I think it will stop at just the .
seven or the eight or the nine or the ten ?
so you've measured things before that didn't .
start right at the inch mark, .
they stopped somewhere in between ?
what did you guys find out last week .
when you measured with your units ?
did most things you measure stop .
right at the end of the unit ?
or did most things stop somewhere in between ?
somewhere in between .
yeah, yeah, remember a lot of them you guys said .
were the easiest to measure and I asked you .
why they were easier, and you go like : .
+" Well my unit ended right there like it only took .
two, exactly two, it was easy to think about .
but, some of the things that were hardest to measure .
or when you had to figure out that part of a unit .
danny Justin, what would you tell me ?
I have something to was ask about .
okay .
what if something stops, .
in the middle of like here or here ?
it's a sixteenth .
well, if you took one of those eighths and said divide it, .
if we took all of our eighths and divided them in half, .
remember, did we do this with you strip ?
did we have to do this with your strip, .
eight was small enough for you ?
well, some people I worked with, they had to do this .
they had to divide all the eighths in half and if you took .
every eight and divided it by half, you would have .
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
what if it stops in the middle of one .
of the sixteenths ?
what if it stopped in one of the middle .
of the sixteenths ?
ahhh, it would be thirty-, thirty six something .
thirty fourths .
that would be uh, that would probably be a half .
of one of the sixteenths .
right, what is a half of a sixteenth ?
um .
so, what's ?
I'd say it would be pretty hard .
because usually, um, on a real ruler, .
they just make it into sixteenths .
because if you have that, .
it's gonna be pretty hard to figure out where it stops .
you're saying that maybe +...
because um like, let's say it makes, .
like a, um, let's say it stopped going, .
like maybe right here ?
it is pretty crowded .
so it is going to be pretty hard to figure out .
justin, tell everybody what happens if .
you take sixteenths and split them in half .
thirty seconds .
thirty seconds .
not like you have thirty seconds to get to the dinner table .
thirty seconds meaning, .
how would I write one thirty second ?
so half of a sixteenth is thirty seconds .
you would go thirty, um, thirty over .
if I want to talk about just one of them .
what number is down here, .
so they will understand quicker ?
um thirty two .
thirty two .
this is what he took out .
one thirty second .
meaning it took one inch, .
and divided it into thirty two equal parts .
let's get this back to what you're gonna do .
with your unit to measurement .
as Nathan and some of the rest of you clearly told me, .
if I am going to use normal measuring tools, .
like, a ruler, like a tape measure, like a yardstick, .
think it would be kind of confusing, .
all those little lines, all those numbers .
you have to think about what they mean .
and Nathan said to me, well, if you don't understand .
what they mean you're going to get confused .
well, that is what we are doing all this talking .
and thinking about so that you will understand .
what all of those little lines mean .
and what you are going to do today is .
make your own measuring tape, .
your own measuring tool, using your units .
but instead of, let's see, let's take some Carmens here .
okay, if I, um, start doing that, .
and I put my, my Carmens on the adding machine tapes, .
so I can get them all connected, like a yardstick, .
I get them all in a straight line, then, .
will I have a measuring tape ?
if I just glue them all on there ?
no .
you have to lines on .
you have to have inches or lines .
inches or centimeters .
am I gonna have inches ?
well , No .
what am I gonna have ?
you're gonna have Carmens .
I'm gonna have Carmens, right .
and you're gonna have Nicoles .
and you're going to have Justins .
we're not going to make a measuring tape that like, .
you would go and give to your uncle the carpenter .
and he would use it to build a house .
but by using your own unit of measurement, .
that you understand pretty well, I'm thinking .
if you can learn how to measure Justins, .
you can learn how to measure with inches .
I see .
I have a question .
I wondered why, um, we couldn't, .
hand Let's say that we made it out of metal ?
why we couldn't hand the Carmens to the builder .
or the carpenter and say: .
+" Here, use this as a tool for your measurement .
I mean, you all seem to agree, .
that that wouldn't be a good idea, .
but I didn't hear your thinking .
I don't know why, why you think .
so, when the measuring tape is finished, .
and all the Carmens are marked or whatever, .
could I give it to a builder, you know, someone .
I had hired to build my house or whatever, and say +"/.
+" No, here you go, this is my special unit of measurement .
justin, explain why you think, no, I couldn't ?
because he, he wouldn't know how to use it .
tell him .
because, um, .
why does my carpenter have to know inches ?
he knows Carmens .
I am giving him this measuring tape .
because Carmens are different than he means, he means his boss, may
maybe twelve inches long, like to space a board .
let's say, with his, maybe um, let's say his boss .
wanted it, um, twelve inches long, .
he couldn't use your Carmens, use the Carmens .
because it might be like in between .
ok, but what if I say did you hear what Nicole said ?
I think many of you didn't .
I think you need to tune it .
Nicole said +"/.
+" Fine, give him that Carmen tape .
tell him you want your windows forty eight Carmens wide .
but then after he builds them, .
and he goes to the place to order windows for my house, .
and he walks up to that man selling glass and says, .
I need some sheets of glass .
that are all forty eight Carmens wide .
he wouldn't know what the heck Carmens are .
you'd have to show him what a Carmen was .
yeah, do you think the man selling the glass .
would be very happy about that ?
do you think the glass when it was finally cut .
would fit my windows as closely .
as I wanted to fit them ?
no .
no, probably not .
so why, why doesn't everybody measure .
in anything they want to measure in ?
I mean, once you know the rules for measuring .
everything won't work .
vannesa's saying that, .
if we all measured any way we wanted to measure .
and we all picked our own unit and used it, .
whatever we wanted, she said, .
somebody might not understand what you're measuring .
yeah, like if +...
so why do you think we have inches and feet and yards ?
um , cuz it's easier to measure .
so it would be easier to measure ?
so everybody knows what they are talking about .
so everybody knows what they are talking about .
yeah, I can go to any carpet store and tell them .
how many feet of carpet I wanted, right ?
but if I walked into Carpetland and said, .
I really like the beige carpet over there, .
give me seventy five Carmens of that .
they wouldn't know what a Carmen is .
you'd have show it, and explain it .
yeah, they probably wouldn't get it right, right ?
what's a Carmen ?
cuz, they've had lots of practice .
measuring in feet, and yards, and inches .
and do they know anything about .
measuring in Carmens ?
no .
carmens aren't different sizes, so I mean, .
I did follow the rules of measurement, right ?
I kept all my units the same size .
and I didn't leave space between them .
and I didn't forget about parts that were left over .
and I um, what were our other rules for measuring ?
so even if I am following the rules, .
because I tried very hard .
to follow the rules for measuring when I um Okay .
I did use numbers or counting .
I counted them up .
I did keep careful track of my numbers .
when I measured with Carmens .
the things you are measuring would have to be even, .
equal, and all the same size .
my Carmens are all the same size, um .
you keep on doing the same size over and over .
okay, I didn't change the size of my Carmen once I started .
And you can't leave spaces in between .
I followed all of those rules for measuring .
so, why am I having you measure in .
brians and Ashleys and Sarahs at all ?
do you think inches and feet .
are going to make sense to you, after using Justins .
and Brittanys and Jillians and Katys ?
yes, cuz it helped me with learning .
do you know more about what inches and feet .
um mean and how they go together .
than you did two weeks ago ?
yes .
yeah, I think you do .
cuz I think you +...
I didn't know what all those lines meant on there .
I always, I didn't know what they were .
I just thought that they were lines or something .
yup, yeah .
you just thought there were lines or something .
yeah .
they were just on there for decoration .
right, just on there for decoration .
do you think they are on there for decoration ?
no .
no, do you think next week sometime, .
or by the end of this week when we are actually .
measuring stuff in inches and feet and yards and stuff .
that you are going to be able to use the marks that are .
on those measuring tools and make sense of them ?
yes .
