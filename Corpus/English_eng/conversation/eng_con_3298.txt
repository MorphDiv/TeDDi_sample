good morning ! 51090_58030
fine, how are you ?
sorry . 58030_67120
go away, jeffrey . 67120_97190
yes, I think that would be a wise idea . 97190_196220
okay .
if I were you I'd kinda go over your notes a little bit, too . 200130_205010
okay ?
jason ?
I was absent tuesday, so I need to make what I need to make up . 205010_208110
okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay ? 208110_213100
because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers . 213100_220290
and I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that . 220290_277990
what I know about polymers . 277990_287110
xxx have something xxx ? 287110_290100
no, those are your notes, right ?
those are hers . 290100_291000
oh, those are hers, xxx lesson ? 291000_292000
i &~was no, I xxx . 292000_293000
that's right, you xxx studying . 293000_299020
okay .
and who did you borrow those from, ginger ? 299020_301010
okay . 302110_317020
two things about polymers . 317020_320100
do you remember ?
yeah . 320100_321010
okay . 321010_326120
okay guys, about thirty seconds to finish your thoughts . 326120_350260
okay, ladies and gents somebody in here raise your hand and tell me something that you've learned about polymers . 350260_357070
something that you know about polymers, based on last class period . 357070_365290
something that you know about polymers .
jim ?
yeah, that uh manmade polymers are stronger than natural ones ? 365290_369040
could be . 369040_376080
so, um, you learned about manmade versus natural polymers ?
yeah . 376080_382000
so they come in two kinds, manmade and natural . 382000_385230
somebody else ?
charlotte ?
doesn't poly mean many, many ? 385230_388070
poly means many . 388070_396270
to try to get as much information as you can about polymers because what can you do with this sheet of paper, that i'll let you do ? 402270_409070
cheat . 409070_410000
yeah, yeah . 410000_413260
you can use this for a test .
okay, sam, uh, terrence ?
they're gigantic molecules ? 413260_414290
they're gigantic molecules . 414290_425170
okay . 425170_427290
um, daphne ?
mono means one . 427290_429010
mono means one . 429010_435040
and what's so important about mono ?
it takes three mono's to make a polymer . 435040_437010
oh, okay . 440290_441210
but give me kind of a definition of a monomer ? 441210_444010
you kind of gave it to me, but kind of rephrase that . 446190_450150
in other words, daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me ? 450150_454040
a chain ? 454040_465010
anybody ? 465010_468280
what is a monomer ?
uh, aimee .
are they simple molecules ? 468280_470150
yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created ? 470150_479010
a polymer . 479010_480000
bingo ! 480000_482020
so mono means what ?
one . 482020_483000
one . 483000_487200
okay, good .
anybody else ?
crystal ?
polymers are molecules joined together . 487200_490110
mono okay, polymers are molecules joined together . 490110_497160
and they're joined together, how are they joined together ?
I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me ? 497160_506230
xxx, I don't know, like, they're just around each other . 506230_510040
they're around one another and they're linked together . 510040_515050
what are they linked together in, samantha ?
but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created ? 519190_527270
a chain ? 527270_528050
bingo ! 528050_536060
thank you, a chain .
okay .
but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay ? 536060_541290
anything else you want to add to this ?
“mer” means molecules ? 541290_543050
okay, we can write: mer@k . 543050_547290
I was trying to kinda remember, &~gi, remember “molecule” okay ? 547290_553290
samantha ?
they can be all scrunched together ? 553290_557150
okay . 557150_558000
up and down and side to side . 558000_560280
and we're gonna take this one step further today in class . 565250_569100
samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains can kinda be arranged two different ways . 569100_575140
she said, “side to side” and we'll call that “parallel” today . 575140_581170
and then how's the other one ?
do you remember ?
scrunched together . 581170_582240
scrunched together kinda like ? 582240_584290
crisscross ? 584290_585130
kinda like crisscrossed . 585130_591030
okay .
okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay ? 591030_595160
we're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer . 595160_600290
you guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that ? 600290_605210
mm+hm . 605210_606050
do you guys remember that ? 606050_612280
can somebody here tell me how were the chains arranged in the newspaper ?
how were the chains arranged ?
dave ? 612280_613180
were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross ? 615190_618170
parallel . 618170_619000
they were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper ? 619000_623120
rip it easy . 623120_624000
you could rip it very, very easily . 624000_630220
okay, what was the other thing that we used in class ?
does anybody remember ?
aimee ? 630220_631160
tyvek . 631160_632080
tyvek . 632080_635260
and how were the molecules arranged in the tyvek ?
crisscross . 635260_636230
they're crisscross, and what did the crisscross molecules do to the tyvek ? 636230_640180
made it hard to tear . 640180_641180
made it very, very hard to tear . 641180_647190
okay ?
and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave ? 653030_659290
okay ?
and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper . 664140_696290
okay, I'm going to go over here on the overhead, guys; I'm not gonna turn the lights off because I'm not gonna be up here for very long, okay ? 696290_705200
kind of a r kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today . 728040_752000
okay . 752000_755070
this is “monomers” . 755070_762010
you guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period ?
okay ?
this is actually polystyrene, which is up here; it's a plastic container . 762010_765290
and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the of the chemical names of the polymers ? 770080_777280
poly . 777280_778260
p+o+l+y, poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p+o+l+y on it . 778260_789210
that's your monomeer, you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created ? 798000_803260
polymer . 803260_804000
a polymer . 804000_805000
a polymer . 805000_810080
okay, good .
okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today .
the arrangement of chains can influence the behavior of the polymers . 810080_826090
whose properties are different from the original elements . 832140_835190
here you have a whole bunch of elements, you put them together and you've created something brand new . 835190_876290
okay . 876290_883160
and how they were arranged in the tyvek . 889220_895280
can we draw it ? 895280_896290
you may draw it . 896290_933220
absolutely .
what how did that newspaper behave ? 939240_947050
how did the newspaper behave as far as tearing is concerned ? 947050_1014150
okay . 1014150_1020010
questions so far ?
questions ?
questions ?
okay .
excellent !
all righty .
is investigating polymers activity part one . 1026000_1033270
and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group . 1037220_1077260
okay . 1077260_1085000
all righty . 1085000_1092210
the first polymer jim, you want to share something ?
uh, no . 1092210_1093100
okay . 1093100_1099070
it's this one right up in here . 1099070_1104090
it's called plumber's tape .
I don't know if you guys can see it from here .
if you go into home depot and you say, “i need plumber's tape” they know exactly what you're talking about . 1112130_1117060
but if you go into home depot and say, “i need poly tetra fluoro ethylene” they may not know what you're talking about . 1117060_1131050
here you've got the “poly” which means the many . 1131050_1136250
does anybody here know what tetra means ?
“tetra” means a number . 1139010_1140090
yeah . 1140090_1143220
it means, like hold on, no, I thought xxx .
anybody here know what “tetra” means ? 1143220_1147080
okay, tetra is a number .
usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together . 1147080_1155000
fluoro is probably fluorine off of the, uh, element table and then ethylene is also another couple of different elements off of the periodic table . 1155000_1163080
so you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape . 1163080_1168230
has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before ? 1168230_1172260
do you guys know what I'm talking about ?
duct tape ? 1172260_1173250
this stuff . 1173250_1175130
not duct tape, plumber's tape .
oh . 1175130_1176050
yeah . 1176050_1177000
that's plumber's tape in here . 1177000_1180280
jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape .
yeah, its not sticky but it's like it's when you wrap it, it squeezes really tight around things, it's like teflon tape . 1180280_1188050
you can fix gas leaks with it . 1188050_1191020
that's what I used it for .
okay . 1191020_1200180
and, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too .
as a matter of fact, yeah, also known as teflon, so you're correct in that assumption . 1200180_1205220
yes, charlotte ?
I wrapped it around my finger and it turned my finger all purple . 1205220_1208000
well, yeah I think so . 1208000_1214270
if you wrap anything around your finger it's gonna turn your finger all purple .
anybody else ?
is that I'm going to pass some plumber's tape around to some volunteers in the audience . 1219210_1225080
does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape ? 1225080_1228110
and I kinda dispersed it around that way you people around you can take a look at it, too . 1228110_1233210
the only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk . 1233210_1238130
don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk . 1238130_1249110
nice and flat if you possibly can .
let's see . 1249110_1259090
jessica, i'll give you some .
okay, can everybody samantha, I'm going to give you some since you guys can take a look at that . 1259090_1263210
what about over here on this side of the room ? 1263210_1269040
okay, jason, I'm gonna get you a piece, too, I think I have another piece up here . 1269040_1280120
okay .
yeah .
you can't touch it ? 1280120_1281000
yes, you can . 1281000_1282010
you just leave it flat . 1282010_1286190
touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too .
and actually they'll make another type, this is more for, pipes and there is another one that's a little bit more flimsier . 1286190_1295020
that's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that . 1295020_1298260
how does it stick under the pipe ? 1298260_1300230
actually, it just does it by, whe eh, you're gonna figure that out . 1300230_1307260
okay ?
I'm not gonna tell you, you're gonna figure that one out .
okay .
see whether or not your ink pen or pencil, whatever that you're using on it right now, that you can write your initials on it . 1313200_1320000
see if you can do that . 1320000_1322250
with the plumber's tape .
if you guys want to feel it, who doesn't have any, you guys can actually see what that feels like . 1322250_1329140
it's kinda really smooth; it kinda feels good . 1329140_1332010
mine won't work . 1332010_1333020
huh ? 1333020_1334000
it ripped through . 1334000_1335030
me too . 1335030_1336010
that's okay, it ripped through ? 1336010_1338260
okay then maybe you don't want to go in too deep, then .
then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing . 1338260_1345090
oh good .
miss ? 1345090_1348040
cool . 1348040_1350010
okay, good .
all right, ladies and gents, we know this is a polymer because I told you that . 1350010_1355070
the job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged . 1355070_1362260
we know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways .
they can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross . 1362260_1368180
so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the teflon or inside the plumber's tape . 1377080_1385110
so what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk everybody, jason, got it ? 1385110_1393200
okay .
now, do you see the tape ? 1393200_1400140
you see the top part of the tape and you see the bottom part of the tape ?
top and the bottom part of the tape ?
I want you to ever so gently stretch it out . 1400140_1406150
just ever so gently stretch it out .
don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out . 1406150_1416090
from top to bottom .
okay ? 1416090_1424210
and, other people in the classroom, if you want to take a look at what they're doing, make sure they're doing it right ?
see, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon . 1424210_1428080
okay ? 1428080_1429020
I didn't make a cute little ribbon . 1429020_1430160
you didn't make a cute little ribbon ? 1430160_1432060
okay . 1433280_1434240
it looks like yellow bacon . 1434240_1435240
looks like yellow bacon, okay . 1435240_1442260
so, that's something that I could do with this .
okay, can you guys see that ?
all right .
now, I stretched it this way . 1442260_1449290
did that tell me anything about how the chains were ?
in the in the tape ?
yeah . 1449290_1450170
no . 1450170_1451090
did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape ? 1451090_1455020
no you didn't .
okay .
now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way . 1455020_1465260
and tell me what happens . 1465260_1469290
the chains . 1469290_1472000
go back to normal .
back to normal . 1472000_1473000
it goes back to normal . 1473000_1480230
okay ?
and if you want to have your other partners or somebody who didn't have a chance to do this, do this again .
my name would be real distorted . 1486180_1487160
but if I were to pull like this I would have my name &~nice nice and original again; normal again . 1487160_1494270
what does this tell you ? 1494270_1495270
someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged . 1495270_1502060
do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed ? 1502060_1510240
based on what this can do .
do you think they're parallel to one another or do you think that they're crisscrossed ? 1510240_1524240
depending on what I can do with this .
I see some hands going up . 1524240_1532100
some hands going up .
jessica . 1532100_1533020
parallel . 1533020_1534020
they're parallel . 1534020_1536010
and why do you think they're parallel ?
because you can stretch it from side to side and it's kind of easy to do, and if it was crisscrossed it would be harder . 1536010_1544280
yeah . 1544280_1548110
I agree with that .
just by pulling it this way, its giving you an indication that the chains are parallel . 1555170_1559220
if the chains were crisscrossed do you think we'd be able to get it back to its original way real quick ? 1559220_1565190
no, we don't .
okay .
how were the chains arranged ? 1580120_1593220
that the chains were arranged in that certain way ? 1600230_1602280
then tell me what evidence did you see that gives you an indication that the chains were arranged parallel . 1605250_1633080
xxx, well you really got yours stretched out, huh ? 1633080_1636080
xxx I had I got carried away with it . 1636080_1637210
you got carried away with it, so what do you think happened to your poor chains ? 1637210_1640290
I ripped it . 1640290_1641190
yeah . 1641190_1642110
you ripped it, too . 1642110_1643000
and I ripped it too . 1643000_1647240
this brings up a point . 1647240_1653250
jason's poor plumber's tape, he really got it really stretched out .
but I supported my scientific thing . 1653250_1658120
you okay . 1658120_1665250
you took it one step further .
what do you think happened to these poor polymer chains ?
from what jason did to them ?
what do you think happened ? 1665250_1666240
they got broken . 1666240_1667060
they got stretched too far so they ripped . 1667060_1669230
yeah . 1669230_1674000
stretched too far so they ripped, very good .
or do they actually get more like do they all get thinner ? 1679110_1682180
they will actually stretch out and get thinner . 1682180_1691260
well, I shouldn't and sometimes that all depends, too .
okay ? 1691260_1695120
all right .
and I hope I'm going to be successful with it today . 1702020_1710140
I was semi+successful with it yesterday .
jim ? 1710140_1711060
but still, if you got, like, your arm cut off or something, then all your polymer chains will be cut and everything ? 1711060_1715170
oh, absolutely . 1715170_1716150
oh . 1716150_1719030
oh .
absolutely . 1719030_1720000
then how do you have polymer chains in your blood, dna, and everything ? 1720000_1722220
well that's because you got to consider all polymers as a gigantic molecule . 1722220_1728290
it's smaller molecules put together .
and all they are just smaller molecules that are hooked up together . 1733180_1736220
so whenever, like, you find a piece of dna that's not like your entire dna string, it's just a little piece . 1736220_1742010
no it's not . 1742010_1743000
it's a little piece .
so is your entire dna string, like, going up and down through your body all the way ? 1743000_1747160
no . 1747160_1753120
that big old gigantic molecule is really, really, coiled inside the nucleus . 1753120_1760040
do you guys, do remember that ?
okay .
and, yeah, and you can actually stretch that molecule out its very, very long . 1760040_1765180
but it's not all up and down your arm . 1765180_1773180
it's compacted inside of every single cell inside of your body, that has a nucleus .
how are polymers arranged inside the body ? 1773180_1776140
it all depends . 1776140_1785100
all depends .
um, some could be arranged parallel, some could be arranged crisscross, some could be cross+linked together .
all depends on what they're what they're needed for, what they're used for . 1785100_1791230
okay ?
any questions ?
any other questions ?
this will be the last demo that I do and them I'm gonna break you up into your lab groups for you to investigate your own polymer . 1798150_1804100
did somebody in here know how to blow up a balloon really, really well and tie it off ? 1804100_1808010
I do ! 1808010_1809020
I do . 1809020_1811030
jason pulled xxx . 1812030_1813250
do me a favor, when you blow the balloons up, don't blow them up all the way . 1817280_1822050
okay, xxx . 1822050_1828140
no, &~ta, that's that's cool, right there . 1828140_1841040
that's good .
thank you . 1842130_1844160
thank you . 1844160_1850130
and jason is dying over there, huh ?
I like balloons . 1850130_1853040
thank you . 1853040_1859030
okay .
all right, we've got another problem .
we have found another polymer and we want to investigate again how the polymer the chains in this polymer are arranged, okay ? 1859030_1867040
so we're gonna do a couple of things to the balloon to figure it out . 1867040_1873180
uh, what I'm going to do I'm gonna take a skewer .
i'll dip it in some oil just to be on the safe side to make it go in a little bit, how should I say, a little smoother . 1873180_1879230
okay ?
easy ? 1879230_1880290
where should I put the skewer ? 1880290_1886000
somebody in here tell me .
like we did with the plumber's tape we stretched it different ways to see whether or not we could figure out how the chains are going . 1886000_1891260
uh, same thing with the balloon . 1891260_1893200
jim, what do you think ?
poke it right on top . 1894220_1895210
poke it on the top ? 1895210_1896220
yeah, right there . 1896220_1897070
okay . 1897070_1900130
anybody want to go in the side ?
ah, stuart wants to go on the side . 1900130_1905180
okay, stuart doesn't want to go on the side, all right .
stuart, we're gonna go on the side, for you, okay ? 1905180_1908280
we're gonna go on the side . 1908280_1910290
what do you think's gonna happen ?
pop ! 1910290_1911210
pop . 1911210_1912050
it's gonna pop . 1912050_1913000
why ? 1913000_1914000
I think it'll go through . 1914000_1915000
I think .
you think it'll go through ? 1915000_1916000
yeah . 1916000_1917080
okay, let's see what happens . 1917080_1921210
okay, ready ?
oh golly, that popped . 1921210_1922010
that popped; that was a big one . 1922010_1923140
okay . 1923140_1927250
now do it right in the bottom; right where all the thick stuff is . 1927250_1929280
right where all the thick stuff is, huh ? 1929280_1931240
yeah, might not pop there . 1931240_1932270
do you think the, the, the thick stuff is not on the side ? 1932270_1937160
no . 1937160_1938030
no ? 1938030_1939000
cause it's stretched out inside there on the top, but down where the bottom is it's not blown up all the way, so it's thicker on the bottom . 1940000_1943290
okay . 1943290_1945150
let's find out .
okay .
okay . 1946170_1948010
xxx popped . 1948010_1954190
just to be on the safe side . 1954190_1958080
oh, it still popped ! 1958080_1960100
that's because I haven't been successful with this all day long . 1960100_1961170
try the bottom, the bottom . 1961170_1964260
where the little tie thing is .
at the bottom . 1965270_1966190
where it's tied . 1966190_1967100
tie thing ? 1967100_1968050
yeah . 1968050_1969010
okay . 1969010_1972190
I don't like that one . 1972190_1974160
yeah, get a new one . 1974160_1975170
okay . 1975170_1976000
I wanna see that one xxx . 1976000_1979000
you're sure, huh ? 1979000_1981280
oh ! 1981280_1982040
there we go ! 1982040_1983280
now the other side . 1983280_1984200
ah ! 1984200_1986270
xxx too long . 1986270_1987080
here i'll blow one up again . 1987080_1988000
okay . 1988000_1994110
well whatev give me two more, cause I told you: sometimes I'm this is working and sometimes its not .
but so far we got one part of it working, right ? 1994110_1996240
xxx yes, sure . 1996240_1998190
and don't blow them up really too don't stretch them out too much . 1998190_2001270
I want the long one . 2001270_2003080
here, try that one . 2003080_2004220
oh, yes . 2004220_2006140
okay, good . 2006140_2013140
thank you . 2013140_2017290
perfect .
I'm gonna be successful with this . 2018180_2020120
yes . 2020120_2022080
use the force . 2022080_2023020
use the force . 2023020_2029090
okay .
all righty . 2029090_2032240
here I go !
should I try a different skewer ?
yeah, they're bad luck . 2032240_2033180
okay . 2033180_2038270
okay .
here we go !
I'm gonna go from this end first .
it's gonna pop . 2038270_2039170
it's gonna pop . 2039170_2040140
don't say that ! 2040140_2041200
oh well . 2041200_2043070
pop . 2043070_2044010
there we go ! 2044010_2045230
ah ! 2045230_2046290
success .
this is my balloon ! 2046290_2048230
it's my xxx .
okay, okay . 2048230_2051080
all righty .
but when I put the skewer I this way, it didn't pop . 2056280_2060000
what's the difference between the chains here and the chains here ? 2060000_2065150
what's the difference ? 2065150_2068060
what's the difference ?
crystal ?
it's parallel . 2068060_2069080
well, don't know if it's parallel . 2069080_2073260
what's the difference between the way the chains are arranged here ?
not so much whether their parallel or crisscross right now, but jim had said this before . 2073260_2079010
jason ?
it just, like, makes it pop cause it won't stretch into where you xxx to go inside . 2084190_2088200
okay, and then what about the top ? 2088200_2090010
they're so loose so you can just stick something in it and it will pop right away . 2094090_2097040
okay, excellent . 2097040_2101270
so how do you think the polymer chains are arranged ?
do you think they're parallel or you think they're crisscrossed ?
ones on the top are parallel and the ones on the side are crisscrossed ? 2101270_2106100
okay . 2106100_2108270
anybody else has anything different, jim ?
so when you stick something in they just like xxx . 2123160_2126010
okay . 2126010_2127020
question . 2127020_2127280
okay . 2127280_2135110
I like that explanation .
and what jim said was, he felt that the polymer chains are crisscrossed .
the ones at the top are crisscrossed, they're not stretched out, so when you poke something through it, the chains just kind of what was the word that you used ? 2135110_2143170
squeezed around it . 2143170_2144100
and so when you try to put a skewer through it, are you really getting you don't they can't squeeze together . 2151100_2156040
I think that's the word that he used . 2156040_2159290
the polymer chains can't squeeze together .
okay ?
so, we learned that the balloon is what type of polymer ? 2159290_2164280
parallel or crisscrossed ?
crisscrossed . 2164280_2165030
crisscrossed . 2165030_2175140
and this is a little bit more compacted than this over here .
so what what can you tell me about polymers ?
think about this . 2175140_2184110
according to the balloon, what can polymers do ?
what could we do to them ?
somebody's saying it, I can hear it . 2184110_2185190
they can stretch out . 2185190_2186140
yeah, they can stretch out, so polymers can stretch out . 2186140_2189060
what I want you to do here now: same thing, same question . 2189060_2196080
and what evidence do you have if the chains are arranged that way ? 2196080_2203180
and if you guys want to draw a picture, you can go for it and draw a picture, it's not a problem . 2203180_2225280
okay . 2225280_2268090
chains compacted together at the top: I can put a skewer through it and it's not going to pop . 2287270_2295180
okay, so the way the chains are arranged, tells me something about the behavior of the material . 2295180_2310040
xxx is not here . 2310040_2316260
are you understanding this all okay ?
okay .
he hasn't been here for a while . 2316260_2327100
was he on vacation ?
he is ?
okay .
okay, it looks like pencils are down . 2327100_2330060
all right, somebody now: tell me something else I can write on this paper, what I just know about polymers . 2330060_2337050
what did you learn about polymers today ? 2337050_2341290
what could you write down on there ?
cedrick ? 2341290_2342280
polymers can expand . 2342280_2344150
oh yes, polymers can expand . 2344150_2352000
or you can use the word we can stretch the polymers out . 2352000_2355100
anything else ? 2355100_2364050
how's bingo ?
bingo, bingo .
okay, nothing else ?
nothing else .
okay, please go ahead and take this paper, now flip it over to the back, because now I'm going to let you investigate one on your own . 2364050_2371180
okay ? 2371180_2375140
all righty .
and the one I'm going to have you investigate on your own, is this one here . 2375140_2380180
so that there's not going to be any questions you won't have any questions when you go into a lab, hopefully . 2387190_2391280
okay, investigating polymers . 2391280_2399040
we investigated the balloon and we investigated the plumber's tape .
I'm gonna have you go out and investigate the a plastic container, or the polystyrene . 2399040_2407020
and that's what you're going to investigate right there . 2407020_2411000
again, we have this question in our head, we have to figure out how these chains are arranged . 2411000_2417020
you're gonna do a couple of things to this plastic container to see whether or not you can figure out how the chains are arranged . 2417020_2428240
okay . 2445260_2455190
and, as you're writing this I'm gonna go ahead and share with you, you guys can go into your lab group, three to a lab group . 2455190_2463150
“okay guys, you have a minute to fi or actually thirty seconds to find the partners and a lab station” okay ? 2469230_2477140
okay, so I know you're all looking around at one another going “yeah, yeah, yeah” okay ? 2477140_2485260
okay .
but let me have your eyeballs back up here because we gotta go through this . 2485260_2488240
and I'm gonna show you what the plastic containers look like . 2493230_2499040
plastic containers look like this .
you guys all recognize these plastic containers . 2499040_2506200
where do you see these ?
look ! 2506200_2507010
yeah, the cheesy hamburgers are in there . 2509010_2512280
yeah, okay ?
in the cafeteria .
all right, what you're gonna do is that you're going to take this plastic container and you're going to cut into a shape . 2512280_2520190
and you guys can choose whether you want to cut it into a square, rectangle, or triangle . 2520190_2525090
the only reason why I'm asking you for those three particular shapes is because they're kinda easier to measure . 2525090_2530270
I don't care how big you cut this out; I don't care how small you cut this out, that's your choice . 2530270_2537050
there's a very, very flat part to the container . 2545170_2548290
do you guys see the flat part ?
okay, so when you get into your lab groups, you just need to make sure that you're cutting off those ripply edge stuff . 2548290_2555280
okay ? 2555280_2558220
and I'm not doing a very good job . 2558220_2567250
I cut the flat part out . 2567250_2572070
from the flat part then you can cut your triangle, you can cut your square, you can cut your rectangle and you guys can cut it any size . 2572070_2579160
just remember you have two flat sections here for three people . 2579160_2584240
so you're gonna have to figure out how you're going to divvy up two sections for three people, okay ? 2584240_2589200
all right, so that's the first thing you're gonna do . 2589200_2594030
you're going to trace the figure . 2598080_2600100
so once you cut the figure out, I want you to trace it, and then I want you to take measurements . 2600100_2608190
and I'm gonna tell you how I want you to take these measurements . 2608190_2615150
you have rulers, in your containers back there at your lab station . 2615150_2627080
what you need to do, is that you need to measure the sides .
okay ?
or if you have a triangle then you have three sides, okay ? 2638240_2644160
you're gonna take these measurements in ?
centimeters . 2644160_2645000
centimeters . 2645000_2658120
then, you are going to go and you're going to give me a measurement of mass .
now, what is in the classroom that's going to help you figure out how the mass of the little piece of plastic ? 2658120_2664170
what's hanging around here ? 2664170_2666230
daphne ?
the triple beam balance . 2666230_2667150
the triple beam balance . 2667150_2673120
so you're gonna use the triple beam balance to help you figure out the mass .
and how do you measure mass ?
in ?
grams . 2673120_2674080
grams, okay . 2674080_2676080
and then, give me some characteristics of the plastic . 2676080_2685220
in other words, after you've cut your little shape out, tell me, what does it look like ?
tell me something about the physical characteristics of that piece of plastic . 2685220_2692140
what does it feel like ? 2692140_2705260
what does it smell like ?
don't taste it .
and you're going to do all of this two times . 2705260_2715280
you're going to do this yeah, watch, before you heat it and then after you heat it .
with this piece of plastic we're gonna put it in the toaster oven and we're gonna see what happens . 2720290_2725220
so I've got the toaster oven up here . 2725220_2733180
I'm gonna man the toaster oven .
so, once it's been heated you're gonna take it back to your lab station and you're gonna do all this all over again . 2733180_2740170
question ?
what if what if whenever we heat it, it like melts and we can't touch it ? 2740170_2744190
oh, I don't know we'll have to see . 2744190_2749190
okay ?
we'll have to see .
you have to put all this information, the before and the after heating into a data table . 2749190_2757260
you guys remember what your data tables looked like from before in the past, right ? 2757260_2764020
I want you and your partners to figure out what your data table is going to look like . 2764020_2768010
and you have to have all of this for all three of you lab partners on one data table . 2774110_2780110
we'd all cut out figure out our own different measurements, but we would share them with one another . 2787210_2793200
so by the time I'm done, I have samantha's, terrence's, and my own all on the data table . 2793200_2802070
before and after .
is that clear ?
yes . 2802070_2803010
is that clear ? 2803010_2809160
because there was some confusion about that this morning in class .
so you're gonna put everybody's data on here .
you are going to trace everybody's figure on your paper . 2809160_2813010
so when you create your data table you need to keep that in mind, okay ? 2813010_2818280
cedrick ?
question ?
no, I just xxx . 2818280_2820120
okay . 2820120_2824080
all righty .
no questions ? 2824080_2831250
I think I've covered everything .
tuh+duh, tuh+duh .
yep, I have .
okay .
and then I will call you, group by group, to the toaster oven . 2838280_2847280
I'm gonna man it and then you can take your plastic back to the lab, okay ?
so when you're ready just raise your hand and i'll let you come up here and we'll put it in the toaster oven . 2847280_2854010
there are some conclusion questions that are on the board behind this board over here . 2862270_2868060
and somewhere in the middle of the lab, i'll push that board over so that you actually can see those conclusion questions, okay ? 2868060_2875060
ladies and gents, this is a lab today that you need to make sure that you are taking very careful measurements . 2875060_2885100
what did I just say ?
very careful measurements . 2885100_2887040
okay, very careful measurements, because I'm not gonna tell you, but yeah, just go ahead and take very careful measurements, okay ? 2887040_2895190
okay, thirty seconds, find your partner and lab station . 2895190_2934150
do you type those ? 2934150_2937080

mm . 3121050_3124280
yeah ?
yes, what do you need ? 3124280_3127020

math . 3137050_3138010
okay, that's a good idea, too . 3138010_3140120

xxx kind of make a small one . 3191270_3195250
okay, I've got one over here . 3195250_3199080
how are we supposed to measure it, like . 3199080_3204220
are we supposed to just put all the measurements in order ?
+" measure in centimeters . 3204220_3206010
you should have paid attention .
actually, it's pretty much clean; I cleaned them all yesterday so you should be okay . 3214000_3215000
okay . 3215000_3217190
it's at seven and a half .
you want to double check and make sure it's aligned correctly . 3217190_3219140
okay ?
we have to check . 3219140_3224050

hey gentlemen, before you start, xxx think about let me you look at your data table . 3246270_3250270
how did you pull that, how did you arrange that data table ? 3250270_3253270
what data table ? 3253270_3254270
yeah . 3255290_3257110
xxx you have to have a data table xxx . 3257110_3261290
or not ?
all of you have to make a data table . 3261290_3264250
remember ?
yeah, but xxx paper . 3264250_3265280
xxx . 3275010_3277150
and you were correct, okay ?
but, you guys need to talk about how you're gonna put that data table together before you do anything . 3277150_3281190
oh, okay . 3281190_3282030
okay ? 3282030_3283250
you just make a square, and then xxx before and after . 3283250_3286210
why not do a triangle ? 3286210_3290040
triangles are cooler .
ladies . 3295190_3305010
oh yes, you do have a data table .
let me take a look at that .
is this yours ? 3305010_3306130
yeah . 3306130_3307000
xxx table .
oh, we have to trim . 3308290_3309270
yeah . 3309270_3314010
so how is that gonna fit in there ?
um, mine could fit . 3314010_3316030
so maybe you need to expand them . 3316030_3321240
but they're good, just make them a little bit bigger .
I need like another piece of paper or something . 3321240_3324060
yeah . 3324060_3327070
um, woo . 3327070_3330150
do I like fractions ?
no . 3330150_3331010
no, I don't . 3331010_3333130
anyone got paper ? 3333130_3334170
and, have you guys figured out how you're gonna put your data table ? 3336200_3339040
yeah . 3339040_3340000
fourteen sixteenths .
yeah . 3340000_3343060
you know what, if I were you I'd re+measure that, and it will give you a decimal .
how do you do it with a decimal ? 3343060_3344130
watch . 3344130_3345040
oh, you get a decimal ? 3345040_3346240
yeah . 3346240_3355040
point two . 3356040_3357260
yeah, so you have to do it in centimeters .
okay, I try . 3357260_3364280
so I'm concerned you got a before and you got an after, but where is the room on the data table for his info and his info ? 3364280_3375080
uh, I'm gonna do that later . 3375080_3377180
ah, we wanna try, like, now . 3377180_3379170
okay . 3379170_3380000
okay ? 3380000_3381000
go get a go get another piece of paper if you need it . 3382020_3384120
I don't have enough paper . 3384120_3385000
okay . 3386210_3395200
and how is your data table coming along, ladies ? 3395200_3407110
gentlemen, let me see your data table . 3407110_3416130
let's re+group here, okay ? 3416130_3421260
you have to get is this your figure ?
yeah, it's my figure . 3421260_3422030
okay . 3422030_3431010
you have to get all the &~xxx let me see your piece of plastic .
your piece of plastic .
where is the other ?
okay, you gotta get all three of these somehow traced on your paper because that needs to be included in your data table, okay ? 3431010_3443080
this one looks like its chipped and you're going to just give me a measurement here, this looks to be about four point nine ? 3443080_3452260
mm+hm . 3455130_3456000
so when you trace it, you can put down on this side “four point nine centimeters” okay ? 3456000_3459190
oh, okay . 3459190_3461280
xxx ?
yeah, yeah and you know what ? 3461280_3469090
sometimes an easier way is just to put all your data inside of it .
does that make sense ?
oh, xxx . 3469090_3470010
okay . 3470010_3473280
yeah, okay . 3475000_3479010
and how are you guys coming along here ?
good, we got our data table . 3479010_3480200
you got your data table ? 3480200_3481240
yep . 3481240_3482040
almost . 3482040_3483050
almost ? 3483050_3485000
he stole my ruler . 3485000_3486140
okay, so you got before and after . 3486140_3490200
so share with me what's gonna go in here .
the characteristics ? 3494200_3495160
yeah . 3495160_3497020
before and then after you heat it up .
okay, now do you have enough time to trace it ? 3497020_3500290
yeah . 3500290_3501030
let me give you a hint here . 3501030_3505050
information inside of it ! 3505050_3506280
bingo ! 3506280_3507290
yes ! 3507290_3508240

why didn't you tell me before ? 3509010_3510030
well, that's an easy way . 3510030_3511290
I could poke an eye on it . 3511290_3512120
so now I have to make my data table out of my whole piece of paper . 3512120_3513040
yeah you can, be careful . 3513040_3515190
no, not necessarily . 3515190_3520150
just erase these little lines and just kinda extend the data table down longer .
oh . 3520150_3521080
right . 3521080_3522000
what was I gonna ask ? 3522000_3523000

I think we forgot xxx . 3554030_3555280
well, let's double+check . 3555280_3559240
I need to copy xxx . 3559240_3565020
so, you have to tell me is this before heating or after heating . 3565020_3568010
before . 3568010_3569000
okay, somehow you need to let me know that . 3569000_3570140
okay . 3570140_3571100
okay ? 3571100_3572000
all right . 3572000_3573000
and you ladies, how are you coming along ? 3573000_3575160
let's see it . 3580000_3581250
okay, that's smart . 3581250_3588260
and then you can put all your measurements on the inside, okay ?
that's good .
of each one ? 3588260_3590030
yeah . 3590030_3592130
gentlemen, xxx done ? 3597090_3601290

okay, your measuring . 3603040_3605150
stuart, what are you doing ?
waiting for the ruler . 3605150_3607000

yeah . 3622190_3625020
all right . 3631000_3633200
so, I don't have to make a xxx table, right ?
you got to get carpet in here because carpet cleans your erasers . 3633200_3636270
no, no carpet in a science room . 3636270_3638210
xxx erase the ground . 3638210_3643240
now how do I make the graph ? 3643240_3646010
you don't have to make a graph, dude . 3646010_3649190
do you want me to xxx all the sides of the others ? 3649190_3651130
no, you're not going to give me xxx, you're not going to give me a parameter or an area; all you've got to do is give me the measurements . 3651130_3656070
oh . 3656070_3657010
okay ? 3657010_3659190
your not going to do any type of math calculation today .
awesome . 3659190_3660160
awesome, huh ? 3660160_3673050
yes . 3673050_3675160
are you guys ready to heat ? 3675160_3676290
yeah . 3676290_3683080
if I were you, I would somehow put this block this off and put a title up here before heating . 3683080_3690020
okay . 3690020_3691000
okay, that way you can tell the difference . 3693230_3699160
okay ?
so, daphne, you're almost done ?
okay . 3700010_3705000
now, what are we tracing ? 3705000_3707020
you're tracing, like, on your thing, on your data table . 3707020_3711290
I'm writing the atom ? 3711290_3714010

i'll do mine, you do yours . 3732210_3741260
just like we don't know it .
do we have to graph it ? 3741260_3743270
did I say anything about graphing ? 3743270_3745280
no . 3746210_3747090
yes, the data table, and this looks to me like you've got one coming here, okay ? 3747090_3752040
so you're all right . 3752040_3756290
so do you have everybody's data ?
yeah . 3756290_3757180
okay, do you have all the masses ? 3757180_3759040
yeah . 3759040_3760060
okay, let me double+check your masses here . 3760060_3766200
where am I gonna find that on your data table ?
right here . 3766200_3769120
inside the little xxx shape .
well then you're going to need to identify how it's being massed . 3769120_3772290
shall I put “mass” above it ? 3772290_3773290
okay that's fine, as long as I know what the mass is . 3773290_3778120
oh, it did it perfect . 3778120_3780140
I know, I changed it . 3780140_3781290
no, I changed it . 3781290_3783080
I changed this little knot . 3783080_3784060

but see ? 3799240_3801150
now what do you do ?
so, my suggestion to you is am I looking at data here for before heating or after heating ? 3804090_3812230
before . 3812230_3813100
okay, so make sure I know that . 3813100_3818270
you gotta how do how do I know that ?
you make another thing; you xxx down here ? 3818270_3821020
you can't do that, so if I were you I'd scratch that out so that I know that you're doing yeah . 3821020_3826170
xxx do that . 3826170_3827120
that's fine . 3827120_3834030
maybe you wan want to block the whole thing off so I know that's all before heating .
here . 3834030_3836000
right here .
okay, good . 3836000_3840070

as soon as I get the rest of the class situated, i'll pass out the tape . 4874000_4876270
it smells like muffins now . 4876270_4881100
before it smelled like gingerbread and now it smells like muffins .
bart . 4881100_4882070
and it tastes like glass . 4882070_4889270
before it tasted like rubber xxx .
what are you doing, benny ? 4889270_4891190
I'm, um, answering number two . 4891190_4893010
okay, then we need to answer number two and not talk to charlotte . 4893010_4895260
all right . 4895260_4897080
dude, your square doesn't even look like a square . 4897080_4899260
that's not his . 4899260_4900000
xxx mine . 4900000_4901140
I cut the wrong one . 4901140_4902230
has anything happened yet ? 4902230_4904120
yeah . 4904120_4905000
yeah, you're done . 4905000_4911220
good .
it's hot . 4911220_4915050
so you want to be careful, okay ?
can I fold it ? 4915050_4916170
hm ? 4916170_4917000
can I fold it ? 4917000_4918280
okay, good . 4918280_4922260
jim, no more . 4922260_4926280
miss xxx, can I answer xxx ? 4926280_4928240
absolutely . 4928240_4930280
miss xxx, I can write xxx . 4930280_4935240
miss xxx, I was born to terrorize myself . 4935240_4938140
mm . 4938140_4942070
xxx those fractions . 4942070_4943260
huh ? 4943260_4944000
get rid of the fractions . 4944000_4945170
xxx two grams, after . 4945170_4948090
two grams . 4948090_4950170
how big is yours ? 4950170_4951290
I don't know, let me measure . 4951290_4954050
what's cedrick's ? 4954050_4957280
three point four grams . 4957280_4960210
cedrick's is three point four grams ? 4960210_4961290
three point two grams . 4961290_4962290
you mean centimeters . 4962290_4966270
three point four I mean, centimeters . 4966270_4969290
okay . 4969290_4970250
xxx this one there ? 4971290_4974270
yes . 4974270_4976150
this is yours ?
yeah, that's mine and that's my small one . 4976150_4979070
okay . 4979070_4983080
okay, yes, you need to put that on your paper .
okay . 4983080_4987150
okay . 4987150_4989240
I have a question for you .
all right . 4989240_4990190
before heating you had point nine grams, after heating you had point six grams ? 4990190_4994120
uh+huh . 4994120_4996050
hm . 4996050_5003260
what happened when you did some of the molecules go away ?
what happened to the molecules ? 5003260_5005250
they reduced . 5005250_5007050
they reduced ? 5007050_5009280
where did they go ?
uh, they melted ? 5009280_5011270
mm+hm, I don't know if they melted . 5011270_5015100
disintegrated . 5015100_5016080
disintegrated ? 5016080_5018270
the characteristics before: this was thin, right ? 5018270_5021200
wasn't this thin before ? 5021200_5022020
yeah . 5022020_5023080
it's only a physical change, not a chemical change . 5023080_5024040
and flexible ? 5024040_5025040
yeah, and now it's thick and not very flexible . 5025040_5027150
it's not very flexible, but it's still thick . 5027150_5032100
so do you still have the same amount of molecules in there ?
um, yes . 5032100_5033010
yes . 5033010_5036220
so what should these answers be ?
the same ? 5036220_5037140
bingo ! 5037140_5044250
oh no, miss xxx ? 5044250_5045170
yes ? 5045170_5046210
do we write the questions ? 5046210_5048180
what is going on gentlemen ? 5048180_5054230
benny, what going on ?
nothing . 5054230_5056230
charlotte, question ? 5056230_5058200
I haven't . 5058200_5059060
okay . 5059060_5061090
do we write the questions ? 5061090_5063000
you never need to write the questions . 5063000_5066130
you guys should know that .
there's no room for it xxx . 5066130_5068190
right . 5068190_5070190
if you're at your desk, you need to be working on the questions by yourself . 5070190_5090080
okay, I'm gonna go ahead and pass around some tape . 5090080_5101050
to what ? 5101050_5102020
to your paper . 5102020_5104230
I knew that . 5104230_5105260
you knew that ? 5105260_5111010
gentlemen, follow my instructions . 5111010_5115260
I've got, um, a few questions . 5115260_5119210
xxx, this is very brittle . 5119210_5122220
yes it is . 5122220_5124040
I broke it . 5124040_5125150
it's not as flexible as it was before, was it ? 5125150_5127290
so you can say, before, it was more flexible than afterwards ? 5127290_5129220
yeah . 5129220_5149150
that's good .
good, good, good .
jason ? 5149150_5151170
yes ? 5151170_5152060
not this jason, that jason . 5152060_5158170
watch for the tape, the tape is going up and down the aisles .
okay . 5158170_5164160
because I know that there's probably a question here for number two . 5169140_5176160
okay . 5183040_5184180
question one, it said +"/.
+" what happened to the polymer when it was heated ? 5184180_5188180
why do you think it happened, explain what you saw inside the toaster oven . 5193040_5197110
number two . 5197110_5203230
your polymer should have had the same mass before and after heating .
this is what we call a conservation of mass, because the root word is “to conserve” . 5203230_5209210
some of you in here when I was walking around the room a lot of you hit this right on target, man, you got the same mass . 5209210_5216240
good job ! 5216240_5218250
good job of measurement .
some of you in here, however, didn't get the same mass and jason, jason, were you the one I had the conversation with ? 5218250_5225270
yeah . 5225270_5226080
where where did the molecules go anywhere ? 5226080_5234120
did you still have the same amount of stuff that you had when you started ?
yeah ! 5234120_5240290
so what did you just do to the mass, what did that mass look like at the beginning ?
what did your piece of plastic look like at the beginning, before you put it in the oven ? 5240290_5243250
bigger . 5243250_5245030
and thinner .
it was maybe a lot bigger and thinner . 5245030_5249270
what happened to you after you heated it ?
it shrunk and got really thick and not as flexible . 5249270_5253010
yeah, it just kinda shrunk, but it got thicker . 5253010_5261140
so you just kinda changed the volume, but the mass is still there .
okay ?
and put that in your own words . 5267260_5269110
number three +"/.
+" how do you think the polymer chains are arranged ? 5269110_5273170
about the polymers and the polymer chains being arranged . 5277070_5279280
how do you think they're arranged, and how do you think the arrangement of the chains influenced the behavior of the plastic container ? 5279280_5289050
uh, for example, prior to heating, your plastic looked one way, after heating the plastic looked another way . 5300010_5309280
what happened to the chains ? 5309280_5317000
were they parallel, were they crisscross, what happened to them ?
tape is coming around too, make sure that you tape your little piece of plastic on your paper . 5317000_5333110
xxx piece of plastic ? 5333110_5335260
what happened to your plastic ? 5335260_5337130
it's at Benny's . 5337130_5338230
go get it . 5338230_5367130
okay . 5367130_5371220
thank you . 5371220_5376280
jason ? 5376280_5377280
yeah . 5377280_5378200
is this yours ? 5378200_5380170
okay . 5381150_5403290
okay, good . 5403290_5414170
you need to tape that on there . 5414170_5418020
with tape .
tape it on ? 5418020_5419000
tape it on there . 5419000_5442220
not tape it around, tape it on .
stuart, you're totally done ? 5442220_5451070
okay, good .
xxx question xxx . 5451070_5454080
okay . 5454080_5458190
okay, good . 5458190_5467220
can we sit there ? 5467220_5468040
just make sure that your names are on both papers, if you have more than one . 5472270_5516230
when you're done, I want you to think about what you want to add to your, um, cheat sheet over here . 5516230_5533010
charlotte ? 5533010_5536100
I didn't get this other question . 5536100_5538000
okay, it says +"/.
+" how do you think polymer chains are arranged ? 5538000_5540280
well, you know that we talked about polymer chains being arranged two different ways, remember that ? 5540280_5548080
parallel and crisscrossed, remember ? 5548080_5556160
how did the arrangement so how do you think the chains are arranged in a plastic ?
um, I think parallel, because you see the xxx . 5556160_5561020
okay, then how do the arrangement of the chains influence the behavior of the plastic container ? 5561020_5566090
in other words the chains were arranged in a certain way based on what you said . 5566090_5571280
when you heated it, how did that what did that to the plastic container ? 5571280_5577130
mm+hm . 5577130_5580110
I know . 5580110_5677150
mm+hm . 5678230_5687260
that's right .
tell me, how do you know that ?
what did you observe happening in the toaster oven ?
it went up . 5687260_5688150
mm, yeah . 5688150_5694030
okay, guys, jim you have a question ? 5694030_5696230
no . 5696230_5697120
okay, bell is gonna be ringing in about two minutes . 5697120_5704180
let me share with you before the bell rings what I want you to do with these papers .
if they're not done, finish them for homework, I see you again tomorrow . 5704180_5709150
because I have to tell you something at the end of the class period . 5717030_5744180
okay .
yes ? 5744180_5745010
xxx for the last time ? 5745010_5747000
no, I didn't . 5747000_5748010
that happened with escondido, huh, a boy in escondido ? 5749150_5755010
yeah, no, I didn't see that .
guys, quickly, quickly and quietly, I have a couple of things I need to share with you about what's gonna happen in class tomorrow . 5755010_5764060
so while you're packing up, you guys can listen . 5764060_5767270
I think I mentioned to you at the beginning of class period today, that when you come into class tomorrow, you're going to take a test . 5767270_5775040
you're going to take a science assessment test tomorrow . 5775040_5779090
this is a test that, uh see the two boxes over there, the test is in the box . 5779090_5783270
you guys remember like your sat nine test that you took last year ? 5783270_5788220
remember, you bubbled everything in ?
yeah . 5788220_5789050
and it's going to take us the entire class period . 5796260_5799180
and come in and like I said you can leave your science notebooks at home because you're not gonna need them tomorrow . 5806020_5811230
okay ? 5811230_5815080
uh, let's see .
I told you about your assignment .
and we're going to go ahead and we're going to add it to the piece of paper over there, okay ? 5828010_5833050
okay, are they're any questions ? 5833050_5838130
questions ? 5838130_5841090
questions ?
okay, let me double+check . 5841090_5847250
let's see, actually, yeah . 5847250_5853050
no . 5853050_5859030
the bell should have rung by now, or do we have one more minute ?
it's eleven forty eight . 5859030_5860200
oh . 5860200_5865150
okay, we have one more minute .
okay .
all right, well then i'll ask you this .
what can we add to this, real quick ? 5865150_5868060
does anybody in here want to put raise their hand up and tell me what I can add to the piece of paper ? 5868060_5873010
what did you learn about polymers from this lab today ? 5873010_5879260
what did you learn that they can do ?
aha ! 5879260_5881010
what did you learn ? 5881010_5883040
dave ?
they can change . 5883040_5885040
how can they change ? 5885040_5887000
uh, criss from parallel to crisscross . 5887000_5890060
they really can't change from a parallel to a crisscross, we'll talk about that, we'll talk about that next class period . 5890060_5897060
uh, let's see, samantha ? 5897060_5900220
they could become smaller when you heat them . 5900220_5904250
when you heat them what can we do to those long polymer chains ? 5904250_5908000
we can ?
shrink them . 5908000_5909000
we can shrink them, yeah . 5909000_5916290
so polymer chains can expand, and polymer chains can ?
but you know when they shrink, they get stronger ? 5919250_5922290
yes, they do . 5922290_5930170
good and we'll talk about that also next class period .
good . 5930170_5932230
i'm just bringing this, okay ? 5932230_5935060
since I was such a good kid ?
and what are you gonna do with the balloon ? 5935060_5936280
I won't blow it up here in class, i'll wait till you're home . 5936280_5939000
because if you blow the balloon and you get in trouble here at school . 5939000_5943020
i'll be good . 5943020_5944020
okay, you gotta promise . 5944020_5945290
i'll I and even if I xxx, i'll say it wasn't you . 5945290_5948220
oh yeah . 5948220_5949000
i'll say I found it on the ground . 5949000_5950220
oh yeah, thanks . 5950220_5952270
have a nice day . 5952270_5953280
