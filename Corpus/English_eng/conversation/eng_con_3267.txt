so, you need my help, or do you want to try it on your own first ? 0_2616
so +... 2616_2936
to input this x@l do I have to put this number ? 2936_3393
all right, you ready ? 3393_4046
well, if you want, we don't have to do the negative . 4046_10490
you want to do the negative ? 10490_12921
yeah . 12921_13888
okay, here we go . 13888_14968
put a little negative three above there . 14968_17046
now you know I'm going to do two times negative three +... 17046_21718
is ? 21718_22675
negative six . 22675_23408
divide by three is ? 23408_24895
&~neg negative two . 24895_26640
good . 26640_27055
plus eight . 27055_27751
six . 27751_29415
positive six . 29415_30808
oh . 30808_32240
right ? 32240_32655
now you're going to put in a zero and do the same thing, right ? 32655_34838
all right ? 34838_43645
there you go . 43645_44543
see, with zero you don't even have to bother putting it in . 44543_46853
right ? 46853_47196
you &~alr you should already know that is your y@l intercept . 47196_49573
all right, try three . 49573_51038
now just make that a positive three . 51038_53036
that's it . 53036_53613
you got it . 53613_54173
you got it . 54173_55436
ben, see what Chris did there . 55436_58335
all right . 58335_58781
all right ? 58781_59301
okay . 59301_61703
all right sir, it looks like you're being left out here, aren't you ? 61703_67311
no . 67311_68060
okay, you understand what they're doing ? 68060_69830
we're using slope . 69830_71301
okay . 71301_73061
so all right, let me let me test you here . 73061_75581
let's try number four . 75581_76796
all right ? 76796_77430
okay, number four . 77430_78030
okay . 78030_78645
oh by the way guys, I like how you labeled them, like that . 78645_82420
thanks . 82420_82915
excellent job . 82915_83938
x@l minus nine, right ? 83938_87403
minus nine, okay . 87403_89076
so tell me how you would graph that ? 89076_90501
I would +... 90501_92490
here we go . 92490_94096
I would go +... 94096_96130
negative nine . 96130_98186
so, one, two, three, four, five . 98186_103001
now that's negative nine for x@l . 103001_103786
uh huh . 103786_104938
right ? 104938_105298
mm hm . 105298_105785
that negative nine really is my y@l intercept . 105785_109096
so then +... 109096_110993
I go down . 110993_112113
ah ha . 112113_112770
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten . 112770_117073
good . 117073_117375
now we only want to go nine . 117375_119160
here you go . 119160_119655
hey, you guys taught him pretty well then, huh ? 119655_123321
xxx . 123321_125758
and now my slope is one fourth . 125758_126845
uh huh . 126845_127790
so that means ? 127790_128678
one one, two, three, four . 128678_131820
good job . 131820_135085
excellent job . 135085_138543
oh +... 138543_138893
all right . 138893_143901
xxx times two is six . 143901_144186
negative six . 144186_144491
all right this is seven, ten, , and sixteen this time . 144491_145435
okay . 145435_146090
is this right ? 146090_147276
what's your question, Brandon ? 147276_148363
I don't even know how to do this . 148363_149578
I don't get it . 149578_151635
what about your partner here ? 151635_153268
she's doing an excellent job here . 153268_155323
oh . 155323_156565
what, are you shy or something ? 156565_157348
no, I just asked this guy and he said +... 157348_158955
I'm trying to do it too . 158955_160241
I'm trying to figure this one out . 160241_161675
yeah, how do you do this ? 161675_162570
okay, let me go to this other group, guys . 162570_166251
Brandon . 166251_167460
Brandon . 167460_168330
do me a favor, all right ? 168330_170786
I'll give you a choice, all right ? 170786_174738
you can pick either Ashley or Nick . 174738_176866
either way, I want I want them to teach it to you . 176866_181025
all right ? 181025_182136
it's called teamwork here . 182136_184018
okay ? 184018_184726
all right . 184726_186070
and if they can't do it, I'll be back in a few minutes to help you . 186070_188775
all right ? 188775_189643
Mister Ormsby, this is like the same thing as I did that one, right ? 189643_192321
that . 192321_192698
okay . 192698_194258
let's take a look here . 194258_195258
I mean, I know how to do this, but I don't know how to do the fractions . 195258_197771
I mean, a lot of these tables look great, now let's get them plotted here . 197771_201025
okay . 201025_201896
and we can see what it comes out to be . 201896_203340
so after we write them all down, we plot them on here ? 203340_205810
right . 205810_206321
every single one ? 206321_206945
right . 206945_207348
and then you're going to label them . 207348_208875
now if you +... 208875_209978
if you don't mind, since this is equation one, just put a little one at the end of it . 209978_213720
and equation two put a two at it at the end of it . 213720_216761
okay ? 216761_217090
all right . 217090_218160
brandon, you had a comment ? 218160_218641
question ? 218641_219036
I know how to do the regular ones . 219036_220941
I don't know how to do the one with fractions . 220941_222685
that's confusing . 222685_223725
those are the ones that I have trouble with . 223725_224461
was he were you listening when Mister Ormsby was saying this ? 224461_226750
well, okay . 226750_228211
well maybe you ought to go to Nick . 228211_230621
sounds like Nick knows what he's doing . 230621_232055
no, I said that I have trouble on it . 232055_232813
okay, then maybe we ought to go to Ashley . 232813_234595
nah, I could xxx . 234595_235746
okay . 235746_237425
so you want put +... 237425_238601
okay . 238601_238976
what do we got going on here ? 238976_239991
we're done . 239991_240776
sir ? 240776_242368
well, we got done with all the xxx . 242368_244420
we were going to call you but you were talking to them . 244420_245828
trying to embarrass me here or something ? 245828_246986
of course not . 246986_247370
uh huh . 247370_247811
you're really slow . 247811_249083
for these ones here +... 249083_250058
you're such a character, Nick . 250058_250923
for these for the fractions we did the slope and then we made a table, and we're done . 250923_254811
and everybody &~agr here agrees, right ? 254811_256858
uh huh . 256858_258140
okay . 258140_258570
so let me just check them real quick . 258570_260076
I like how you numbered them one, and so on . 260076_263090
this one you didn't number . 263090_264698
what number is that one ? 264698_265435
uh, I think that was five . 265435_267410
that was five . 267410_267796
that one's correct, so put a five there . 267796_269986
okay, I can safely assume that this one must be the four, right ? 269986_275365
that was five . 275365_276876
uh +... 276876_277140
or is this one the four ? 277140_277851
which one's the four ? 277851_278805
this one's two . 278805_279738
which one's two ? 279738_281525
four is this . 281525_281915
four four is negative nine, and up one is four . 281915_285068
this one . 285068_285540
so that yeah, this is four . 285540_286443
are you sure about that ? 286443_288843
yeah . 288843_289083
because this one +... 289083_290268
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine . 290268_293260
oh no . 293260_293986
this is four . 293986_294563
ah . 294563_294883
right . 294883_296018
this one's two . 296018_296576
so let do me a favor . 296576_297713
erase the two, right, and label them right near the ends of the lines . 297713_304635
how's that ? 304635_305260
(be)cause right there I can't tell which line you're talking about, right ? 305260_309315
right . 309315_309921
there I know . 309921_310888
hey two, that's that line . 310888_312151
so this is the four line . 312151_313233
put the four right there . 313233_314376
okay ? 314376_315721
so both of those look excellent . 315721_317795
six minus xxx . 317795_318340
slope of three fifths and number four, slope of one fourth . 318340_322523
that's good . 322523_323315
number one, slope with two thirds starting at eight and this one is seven, right ? 323315_331058
mm hm . 331058_331555
uh oh . 331555_332113
I don't like equation three because look, it's going down . 332113_336835
that's a positive three x@l . 336835_339201
oh . 339201_341168
it should be going +... 341168_342393
up . 342393_343471
it should be angling up . 343471_344561
so correct number three, and then you guys as soon as you get that corrected just move on . 344561_348140
I'll check that one later . 348140_349121
okay ? 349121_349625
Mister Ormsby ? 349625_351501
here we go . 351501_355413
yeah ? 355413_356813
we don't get number five . 356813_357390
number five . 357390_358676
all right, first of all, you know the y@l intercept is what ? 358676_362395
negative five . 362395_363068
all right . 363068_363588
so put a dot on negative five . 363588_365083
one, two, three, four, five . 365083_368130
good . 368130_369323
we all agree on that ? 369323_370465
yes . 370465_371155
now, this is something so simple but very important . 371155_374298
see in Algebra we get lazy sometimes, right ? 374298_376740
guess what number is in front of that x@l . 376740_378906
one . 378906_382093
a one . 382093_382445
a one, right Robert ? 382445_383215
so therefore put a one there . 383215_385901
if the slope is one, what am I going to do ? 385901_390196
all right, you ready Sir ? 390196_395020
make that one a a fraction . 395020_396941
how do I make one a fraction ? 396941_398725
one over one . 398725_400235
one over one . 400235_400883
write it write like let's just put it underneath there . 400883_403390
one over one . 403390_403915
something to look at . 403915_404548
all right, that's fine . 404548_405283
now remember slope is rise over one, right ? 405283_407928
mm hm . 407928_408311
so one over one means I rise one and I go across one . 408311_413013
there . 413013_414431
that's it . 414431_415230
that's the slope of one . 415230_416261
all right ? 416261_418071
just let me check them real quick . 418071_421895
all right . 421895_425095
now do me a favor, guys . 425095_427015
you labeled these really nice . 427015_428758
as a matter of fact, this is a way an ideal way of labeling it . 428758_432431
write the whole equation, but like for example, equation one right here, put a one next to it also . 432431_438365
and this one's equation three, right ? 438365_440701
so put a three next to that . 440701_441861
okay . 441861_442460
so number them, in other words, okay ? 442460_444046
okay . 444046_444526
because what that's going to do, that's going to help you when I ask these questions about each of the equations . 444526_450973
okay ? 450973_451406
because that's how I label them . 451406_453596
I label them by numbers . 453596_454471
does that make sense ? 454471_455355
all right . 455355_456853
so as soon as you get that done, which you're almost done, you get them numbered, just move on to the next set of five . 456853_465115
okay . 465115_466076
all right ? 466076_466523
yeah . 466523_467930
all right . 467930_468701
so y@l is three fifths, x@l negative ten ? 468701_474851
okay . 474851_476035
so wait a minute . 476035_477251
you try you're doing negative five, right ? 477251_479165
yeah . 479165_479603
three times negative five is <negative fifteen> . 479603_481875
<negative fifteen> . 481875_482505
divided by five . 482505_483448
negative three . 483448_484103
minus ten ? 484103_485816
is, um, negative, um, seven oh, minus ten ? 485816_490521
negative three and a negative ten . 490521_492176
oh, um, thirteen . 492176_493873
negative thirteen . 493873_494695
so let's change that . 494695_496406
mm hm . 496406_497673
well negative five is going to be, not five, but negative ? 497673_502750
thirteen . 502750_503278
thirteen . 503278_503776
all right ? 503776_505673
Ben, you look like you're not you're just coasting here, man . 505673_509301
what's going on ? 509301_509803
xxx . 509803_510853
Chris, make sure you help Ben out here, man . 510853_517331
Ben I just sense Ben's getting a little lost here . 517331_520888
all right, this is your chance to ask not only Chris, but also Raymond here . 520888_526406
get some help from them . 526406_529368
okay . 529368_530071
you think you got it ? 530071_532495
now zero of course is going to be what ? 532495_534110
if I put in zero here what am I going to get ? 534110_536520
uh zero . 536520_537526
wait a minute, what's three fifths times zero ? 537526_541446
three fifths times zero ? 541446_543023
zero . 543023_543743
minus ten would be ? 543743_546078
ten . 546078_546781
no . 546781_547935
zero minus ten would be ? 547935_549493
ten . 549493_551285
not positive ten . 551285_552796
negative ten . 552796_553735
negative ten . 553735_554133
so you want to put a negative ten there . 554133_556255
okay ? 556255_557445
okay . 557445_557820
so, oh . 557820_559158
now try at least one more of five . 559158_561611
okay ? 561611_562691
uh, Isn't that, uh +... 562691_565230
now it's a positive five . 565230_567300
