ok . 0_1281
and ah we'll talk a little bit about relationships between
ok . 6149_7102
why don't you draw for me a negative linear relationship . 7102_12085
negative ? 12085_12933
sure . 12933_13434
ok . 13434_15462
ok my left and right brain whatever . 15462_21040
ok Negative is like for instance ah here's an example that was in
high low <xxx> . 26540_50835
and ah a negative correlation would be let's say um people wanting
and ah this would be a negative correletion here because it's
xxx um the high level, the correlation here is that the this low
this would be the probability that they would help . 92602_95521
this is the probability that they would help and this is ah and
ok . 103312_103815
ok so that's negative . 103815_104992
a positive correlation . 104992_107316
ah would go like this . 107316_109270
ya know this is the frequency and this would be like where the
so you get a positive correlation going up the scale . 118750_122301
umhm how bout a curvilinear ? 122301_125335
um a curvilinear ? 125335_127446
start off with a good feeling about something and then to a certain
ok . 134577_135479
ok ? 135479_136012
that'll work . 136012_136563
and no relationship ? 136563_137794
no relationship is um I think it would go something like straight
right because as one variable changes it has not effect on the
right . 146306_146721
um . 146721_147274
what I'm trying to say the higher the ah higher the probability the
the higher the +... 154003_154946
<I would> I would phrase the other axis first . 154946_157846
ok, the higher the variable the what is that ? 157846_165358
as the variable increases the: something or other decreases . 165358_171382
yeah as this axis increases that one decreases . 171226_174690
ok that's a better way of putting it ok . 174690_177374
yeah mumble . 177374_179186
um do you know about scatter plots ? 179186_180669
yeah scatter plot is um when you graph xxx . 180611_185578
so a no relationship scatter plot, right . 185578_189343
it would just be random . 189343_190702
usually actually in an actual circle kind of thing they they like
whereas these linear relationships tend to cluster around the y . 194470_198453
yeah . 198453_201945
right . 201945_202692
ok alright . 202692_204965
got that . 204965_206156
alright, we'll talk about now the scales of measurement . 206156_210565
and the book talked about four different scales used for
want to tell me a little bit about um I guess we'll start out with
nominal, I kinda remember that one because it's like names when you
ok ratio is um I guess like the degree or something like that or ah
mhym . 253374_254180
ok uhm let's see intervals, um that's ya know grouping ya know your
let's say you have intervals of two classification . 269420_275416
you you have that look on your face ! 275416_278154
yeah, I'm not sure I understand you . 278154_279856
intervals is ah when you break ah you categories down into groups .
just give me an example <of an interval scale> . 285061_286984
<an example> of an interval scale, let's see um I keep thinking
it's four groups of twenty five . 297488_299624
yeah ok . 299624_300607
the way I uh well I'll go back and start with nominal . 300607_304423
I'll just go in and ah say a little bit more what the book talked
but a nominal scale has no numerical or quantifiable . 309399_313672
oh ok . 313672_314762
um property and would include like ah sex you know male and female
you can't say males one females zero . 320431_322665
I know . 322665_323705
you know cause one's not higher or better than the other . 323705_326000
can't do the same thing with your marital status . 326000_329021
yeah . 329021_329773
your married, single . 329773_330587
you can't really do that . 330587_331953
um, ordinal scales is a is a very primitive way and it does have
and <the> the example that I like best is the one in the book
it talks about a movie rating systems . 346808_348760
ya know, one movie might get five stars, one might get four, three
and the big problem with an ordinal scale is you can only say
yes . 368755_369577
all you know is it's better or not quite as good . 369577_372881
ah, an interval scale is probably the most common or one of the
ok . 386747_387548
it's along an interval scale because ah the difference between five
it's still five degrees . 397239_398020
but um you can't say something like well ten degrees is twice as
and the reason you can't do that is because on an interval scale um
you um, a thermometer you have a zero but it's just arbitrary . 411132_413940
oh, ok . 413940_415024
it happens to be where water freezes but it's not just an arbitrary
so um you wouldn't be able to say um something is twice as much as
it tells you nothing about ah the ratios between numbers . 425524_428324
and that leads us right into ratio which ah lets you say it does
there's such a thing as no length . 435332_436545
right . 436545_437651
and no weight, and no volume and the difference between one number
you can make that kind of distinction . 447644_449179
and as far as psychology research, uses most nominal, ordinal, and
and really the only time you see um ratio scales is in like
<right> . 463875_464295
<that's> that's ah I think cause there's no such thing as no
there's just one per minute, two per minute . 468111_470319
that would be ratio scale . 470319_472648
ok . 472648_474616
ok ? 474616_475704
that clarified that a little bit . 475704_478239
ok, um I'm just gonna go ahead and ask you some questions and if
ok . 489831_490638
to see if you got it . 490638_491671
I'm pretty sure you will . 491671_492534
um Give me a operational definition for self esteem . 492534_498440
ok appearance, ah: let's see taking a self esteem you can
ok yeah, you can give a test . 527236_529060
a test . 529060_530147
ok, yeah alright . 530147_531375
that makes it easier . 531375_532580
your thinking scientific . 532580_533589
ok a test . 533589_535421
ah these are just different ways to ah measure self esteem ? 535421_539714
umh . 539714_540281
ok your saying to give them a test I guess . 540281_542882
so that after you've done all of these things, you would define
oh I see . 549859_550511
ok . 550511_551031
so a person with high self esteem we'd say +/. 551031_554896
will score high . 554896_555645
we'd say, ya know if you had a test that has ah zero one hundred,
ok . 562981_563894
we'll call that person with medium self esteem ya know sitxy to
low self esteem below that . 566975_568493
ok . 568493_569525
does that make sense ? 569525_571214
umhm . 571214_571647
alright .
how bout an operational definition for depression ? 571647_574866
well the same ah depression um I'm trying to think of something
um task performances . 611287_615042
ok . 615042_615473
ok ? 615473_616146
you define the criteria . 616146_618427
right . 618427_618735
ok . 618735_619160
I'm gonna tell you about um a hypothetical study . 619160_622597
ok I'm working with a young children who ah who wet the bed still .
and there about eight years old and I've got this therapy for them .
it's a behavioral therapy . 631709_633549
and what I want to say is ah at a certain point I'm gonna call
mhm . 641316_642395
how would I op, just give me any way I could operationally define
how can I, how can I call a kid cured ? 647488_649409
the fact that they aren't bedwetting anymore . 649409_651879
ok . 651879_652093
maybe more specifically +... 652093_654363
um That they get up in the middle of the night . 654363_657648
I guess bed wet at a certain time or whatever during the night . 657648_661472
or you'd feel as though they were cured if they got up during the
not is that what you're asking ? 669144_672617
yeah . 672617_672915
I was looking for something like that . 672915_673883
I I was more thinking ah you know a certain amount of time without
yeah, I guess they're cured once they completely stop . 677833_683609
that's what I was thinking . 683609_684537
but you know the they're being cured you know when you're measure
umhm . 689432_689731
you know . 689731_690488
if it's less . 690488_691249
so at one point I'm gonna have to be able to say just for my study .
aha . 694145_694688
that this child is cured and he's not going to be in treatment
aha, because after such amount of time you know like for he that
ummhmm . 709156_709570
once or twice a week or something like that . 709570_711953
well it's been six month and he hasn't so you know . 711953_715179
right . 715179_715594
that that be perfect . 715594_717098
six month trial would be cured . 717098_719042
