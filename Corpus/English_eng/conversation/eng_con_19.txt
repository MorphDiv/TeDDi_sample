this is a story about two guys who knew each other at one time .
they went their separate ways .
I believe one became a detective .
and they had made a deal to meet each other back at this place in
one went into detective work, I believe .
and when he came back to the place where they agreed to meet, he
and so he had another policeman to arrest him .
growing up in Virginia, we had to walk like three miles to the
and my sister, my oldest brother, myself, and actually two other
and back in the day, a quarter was a whole lot of money .
and we were on our way walking in the hot summer sun .
and the roads weren't paved back then, a rural area .
and he lost the quarter .
when we got almost half way to the store .
and we were so disappointed .
and up until the time he died, we used to tease him about it .
we called it sanding for the quarter because he was scooping dirt
and we never did find the quarter .
luckily we had a few pennies .
so we continued on to the store .
but everytime <it was> I think of him, in loving memory of him .
I think about the time that we were walking to the store .
and he lost his quarter .
