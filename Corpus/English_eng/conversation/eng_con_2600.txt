okay let's get started +... 2065_2745
couple of &-uh quick announcements . 6045_9665
just to repeat &-uh the announcement that I made last day . 10025_13525
which concerns a change in the lecture schedule as you see up there . 14505_18225
so after the the exam on Tuesday that's a reminder that the next exam is on this coming Tuesday . 20275_28275
&-uh after that we're going to go on and &-uh talk about opiates . 29535_33115
so you wanna print out the &-uh lecture notes for opiates next . 33315_36255
then there'll be four four lectures on opiates followed by two &-uh periods of addiction and then we'll finish up with sedative hypnotics@n . 37815_44735
okay ? 45175_45415
just make sure you get that down so you have the right lecture notes when you come . 45565_49105
the again the format for the next exam on Tuesday will be exactly the same as the format for the last exam . 51085_58345
any questions about the lecture schedule or the exam ? 59385_63285
when is the question and answer session ? 66145_70105
oh right right right . 70345_71325
so there will be a question and answer session Monday four o'clock &-uh on the terrace on the fourth floor of this building . 71545_80025
there's a terrace there . 80205_82105
Monday four o'clock an open question and answer session . 82225_85405
anything else ?
(0.4) okay .
yup .
+, okay . 86985_87485
so today we're ready to go on to have the last lecture on hallucinogens . 89645_99205
and last day we had talked about the two major families of hallucinogens the LSD family . 99825_107965
all of which have a a common structure similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin . 109745_114665
and the phenylethylamine family . 115285_116485
the prototypical &-uh phenylethylamine hallucinogen being mescaline . 117545_120885
and all of the phenylethylamine family of hallucinogens has structural similarity to catecholamine neurotransmitters . 121365_127385
so what we're gonna talk about today then is what's known about the neural biological mechanism of action of the hallucinogen . 128355_135835
okay that is how or by what mechanisms do these classes of compounds influence neural biological activity brain activity to produce specifically their hallucinatory effects . 136475_148075
but don't forget those two classes the LSD family and the phenylethylamine family have effects that are different . 148795_154015
&-uh the phenylethylamines for example have this &~stimula stimulant component presumably because of their structural similarity to &-uh the catecholamine transmitters &-uh that's not shared by the LSD family who are really pure hallucinogens without this without really this this stimulant component . 154585_172285
so what we're talking about here aren't isn't those kinds of effects but specifically their &~hallucinoge &~hal hallucinogenic effects that is what actions in the brain mediate the hallucinogenic effects . 172785_185105
and it's thought that both the LSD family and the phenylethylamines all of those compounds and we talked a whole about a whole bunch of them the other day share a common action at least in terms of their ability to produce hallucinogenic effects . 185705_200985
and the reason that they're thought to share a common action comes from early pharmacological studies primarily having to do with crosstolerance +... 202305_211265
I told you that with LSD for example if you if it's taken in a number of days in succession you get very rapid and large tolerance to the hallucinogenic effects so you get less and less hallucinogenic effect &-uh with repeated administration . 213605_227625
and you also however see crosstolerance both within drug families so crosstolerance between different drugs within the LSD family but you also see crosstolerance across the LSD and phenylethylamine families so if you repeatedly expose or if a person's repeatedly takes LSD becomes tolerant to LSD and they now try mescaline they'll be crosstolerant to mescaline they'll also be tolerant to &~mecanin to to mescaline . 228625_257805
so you get crosstolerance both within and between the LSD and phenylethylamine families . 258185_263325
and the fact that there is crosstolerance is pharmacological evidence to suggest that their hallucinogenic effects at least are being mediated by some sort of common neurobiological mechanism presumably even due to some action on a common receptor site that's that's mediating the tolerance . 263805_284605
now most of the research on the mechanisms of action of the hallucinogens has focused on serotonin systems . 286265_295245
and that of_course is because of their structural similarity to the neurotransmitters serotonin . 296285_303505
then even with the phenylethylamines who have a structure that's more similar to catecholamine transmitters &-uh that structure is also relatively similar and they're all monoamines . 303985_313765
so the catecholamines and the &-uh and serotonin share this basic monoamine structure . 314345_321025
so most of the research has focused on the possibility of serotonergic systems mediating hallucinogenic effects . 323345_329745
and what I'm gonna tell you today is sort_of a story and it's an evolving story of &-uh the +//. 329885_336565
it's basically a chronological story of how ideas have changed over the years about what LSD and the phenylethylamines are doing neurobiologically to mediate hallucinogenic effects . 336195_348755
and as you'll see data has been collected . 348895_351955
the data's all true but the interpretation of those data in terms of hallucinogenic effects has changed quite dramatically over time . 352135_358995
so it's an interesting story of how with accumulating data you can reach you know even though the data's all true you can reach very very different conclusions of in in terms what these are these drugs are doing . 359345_371265
so it's sort_of a lesson in &-uh in a progression of thinking in in the field of &-uh &~o &~o of these effects . 371465_379165
now just we're gonna concentrate on serotonin so we've already talked a little bit about serotonin I've got a few extra slides thrown in here so you won't have like this one's not on your handout I don't think . 380195_389555
this one's on your handout when we talked about &-uh monoamine neurotransmitters . 390135_394235
and +//. 395375_395435
but this is just to remind you about serotonergic systems which we already talked about just to to jog memories . 395635_402815
&-uh and you should all remember &~i &~i serotonin neurons are located primarily in the raphe nuclei so the cell bodies for these cells are down in a a series of nuclei in the brain stem called raphe nuclei collectively . 403985_418505
and they send their axons up to a whole variety of forebrain structures . 419285_423345
so the serotonin &-uh axons innervate the entire neocortex the hippocampus the hypothalamus &-uh with the cell bodies located down <in the> <in the> in the midbrain . 423825_432625
and so what you have here then is a serotonin terminal let's say that's in the cortex and the hippocampus then this just outlines the synthesis of serotonin with the precursor being &-uh tryptophan which is it came from dietary sources . 433305_447685
you have a simple enzymatic step &-uh tryptophan hydroxylates an intermediate five hydroxy tryptophan and then &~th then serotonin . 448505_457945
so serotonin is the final product . 458665_460025
so it's a very simple synthesis . 460185_461385
&-uh serotonin's metabolized primarily by monoamine oxidates into its major metabolite which is this compound five HIAA . 462665_470545
five hydroxy indoleacetic acid . 470985_473105
okay ? 473645_473865
you all should remember that right ? 473965_475145
&=laughs:multiple the other thing I wanna emphasize here &-uh hasta do with receptors . 475465_478885
there are a_lot_of known serotonin receptors . 479965_483265
right now there's at least fourteen different serotonin receptors that have been identified and cloned . 484045_489925
so this and they're all they're called five HT one two three four five six seven and then they have subtypes like five HT two one a@l one b@l . 490245_501205
two a@l two b@l . 501825_502865
so that's basically the terminology . 503145_504905
we don't hafta I I don't expect you to know all of these various types but we will be talking about specific serotonin subtypes . 505465_512325
the main thing to keep in mind is that there's a_lot_of them . 512705_514765
and what serotonin does in the brain when it's released here into the synaptic cleft depends on what type of serotonin receptor the serotonin is interacting with . 515665_525545
it's the receptor that confers specificity in the system and there's a_lot_of different serotonin receptors . 525645_530025
it's a very very confusing field pharmacologically because there's just so many receptor subtypes . 530715_536075
okay . 537555_537815
so little bit about the sort_of progression of research on how serotonin is influencing or how LSD is influencing or thought to influence serotonergic neurotransmission to produce hallucinatory effects . 538775_553375
now the very very first studies that were done on this back in the fifties and sixties . 554075_557795
were primarily done in peripheral tissues . 558755_560975
and you should all remember that serotonin is very rich in a variety of peripheral tissues like smooth muscles . 562015_568935
&-uh and when serotonin's released onto smooth muscles it causes smooth muscle contractions +... 569695_575155
and that's how LSD remember was discovered they were looking for &-uh different kinds of lysergic &-uh acid &-uh derivatives . 578185_587285
that could be used therapeutically as smooth muscle &+a and to contract smooth muscles and treatment of things like &-uh postpartum &-uh hemorrhage and so on . 589405_597405
and so peripheral tissues provided a very nice assay system in these early studies to look at the the neurochemistry of LSD . 598065_606445
(be)cause you take things like a guinea pig ileum piece of smooth muscle &-uh put it in a bath . 606925_612825
you put a little serotonin on it and it causes smooth muscle contractions and that kind_of a bio assay was very very common in in &-uh the development of early neurochemical studies and the study of neurotransmitters . 613405_624605
so you have a little stretch of smooth muscle wash a little serotonin on it and get a contraction and then you could do things like what &~as what happens if you pretreat the tissue with S something like LSD to the ability of serotonin to cause smooth muscle contractions . 624265_640425
and it was noted very early on that what LSD does is block the action of serotonin or these peripheral tissues . 640745_648845
so if you treat the tissue with LSD serotonin no longer causes contraction of the muscle . 648985_657365
which suggests of_course that what LSD is doing is antagonizing the action of serotonin . 658765_665585
and so the very first sort_of neurochemical hypothesis of hallucinogen action was that hallucinogens were acting as serotonin receptor antagonists . 666145_678165
and it came from these studies on peripheral tissues . 678665_680645
that hypothesis however didn't last very long . 681605_684265
because very early on they started to look at other kinds of compounds that were similar in structure to LSD . 685145_696125
&-uh and one of the first of these was a compound called Brom LSD . 694825_698545
and what it was discovered was Brom LSD acted just like LSD in peripheral tissues so Brom LSD prevented the action of serotonin in &-uh in producing these smooth muscle contractions . 699045_714005
but when given to humans Brom LSD's not hallucinogenic . 715025_718585
it doesn't have any hallucinogenic properties . 718985_720805
and so that sort of killed the hypothesis that the mechanism by which LSD produces its hallucinogenic effects is by antagonizing serotonergic reactions because here's another drug structurally very similar to LSD does the same thing in terms of antagonizing serotonergic actions on on peripheral tissues but it's not hallucinogenic . 721405_743345
now of_course one &~hyp hypothesis is is that what LSD is doing in peripheral tissues on a strip of guinea pig ileum has very little to do with what it's doing in your brain to produce hallucinations . 745355_759295
&-uh it must be doing something different in the brain . 759855_761975
which then led to a whole series of studies obviously on the brain itself on the actions of LSD on the brain itself trying to figure out what it's doing on the brain itself . 762775_771255
to initiate hallucinogenic actions . 771835_774075
and &~there then begun now this is in the sixties seventies a whole series of studies that led to eventually what I'm calling here a presynaptic hypothesis . 775195_785455
and what I'm gonna do is just give you a_couple_of the kinds just to give you a flavor of the the kinds of research that was done a_couple_of the kinds of experiments that are done to suggest that LSD's acting presynaptically . 786535_798075
now the first kind of experiment is is a neurochemical one . 799435_803275
and at that time sixties seventies the standard way to look at neuropharmicology neurochemically was give a drug and then after the drug &~a &~a &~a &~w &~ha had been absorbed and was having its effect say an hour or so later &-uh take out the brain and then look at the tissue content of various transmitters . 804135_826755
so you can assay various brain regions for how much serotonin there was how much serotonin metabolite there was then you can look at lots_of &~n &~l &~or or norepinephrine or dopamine or acetylcholine or whatever it was . 826955_840895
I mean that's a classic technique so what you're asking here in this kind of neurochemical study is give a drug and can you detect any kind of neurochemical change in transmitter content or transmitter metabolite content . 840995_853395
and then try to make some kind of inferences from those kinds of changes what the drug might be doing to the neurotransmitter . 854315_859975
and so there're a number of studies of that type . 860355_862935
and they find these were very consistent . 863755_865375
if you give hallucinogens like LSD what you find is you get an increase in serotonin content in serotonin rich regions like the neocortex . 865635_876515
so the you know an hour after LSD the amount of serotonin that you measure in the tissue is increased . 876955_883235
and the amount of the serotonin metabolite five hydroxy indoleacetic acid decreases +... 885595_891155
and so LSD in the brain is increasing serotonin content but decreasing serotonin metabolism . 891975_900995
that pattern of effects on the transmitter itself and the transmitter metabolite are classically interpreted as a decrease in transmitter turnover . 901995_912715
in this case serotonin what's called serotonin turnover . 912875_915415
and the logic of that is as follows . 916535_920775
if you give a drug and it decreases say the firing rate with a release of a transmitter like serotonin then content goes up simply because less is being released and since less is being released you're not depleting the tissue store and so you see content rise . 921505_940985
presumably because release has gone down and the metabolite's consistent with that . 941285_945665
if you were releasing a whole bunch more transmitter then you should have more transmitter metabolized and &~metabol and the levels of metabolite should go up . 945985_956045
but if the levels of the metabolite go down that's suggesting that there's less transmitter being metabolized why is there less transmitter being metabolized ? 956585_964525
well because there's less being released . 964645_966245
okay ?
so this is interpreted as a decrease in activity in serotonergic neurons . 967125_971845
higher content because you're using a_lot less . 972825_975205
lower metabolism because you're losing &~ye using less and therefore metabolizing less . 976005_981785
so that kind of neurochemical finding now in brain not peripheral tissue suggests that when you give a compound like LSD what's happening is you're toning down or shutting down serotonergic systems . 982265_993665
(0.6) the second kind of experiments that started around the same time as these neurochemical studies were going on were electrophysiological experiments . 999025_1006745
and they were some of the first experiments that were done &-uh with the development of new microelectrodes that allowed you to record the activity of single neurons so you put a a very small microelectrode into the brain and you could record from single cells and then give a drug and ask what happens to the firing rate of specific cell populations when you give a drug . 1007025_1029985
and it just so happens that the serotonergic system's very nice to study in this because all of the serotonin cell bodies are clustered together in a very tight &-uh &-uh structure the raphe nuclei . 1030585_1042785
so if you stick an electrode in there you can record very easily from neurons that are almost exclusively serotonergic neurons . 1043325_1049685
you can be pretty confident that the neurons that you're recording from were in fact serotonin neurons . 1050305_1054345
and there's a fellow by the name of Aghajanian who was at Yale who then did a whole series of studies looking at a range of of of &-uh hallucinogenic compounds . 1054625_1065105
and their ability to influence the firing rate of serotonergic neurons . 1065825_1069545
and what he found in all these studies was is that if you gave LSD drugs like LSD you decrease the firing rate of serotonergic neurons . 1070785_1083625
that is LSD seemed to inhibit +... 1084425_1086505
serotonin neurons from firing . 1090445_1091525
and he got that effect whether you gave the LSD systemically that is just injected intravenously or or intraperitoneally and you also got that effect if you used a technique &-uh called iontophoresis to squirt LSD just directly <on to the> &~c on to the cell on to the single cell . 1092625_1112645
so you didn't have to give the LSD so it acted everywhere in the brain . 1113265_1116025
if you squirted a little LSD just on to the cell body of the serotonin cell you're recording from it would also inhibit &-uh serotonin cell fiber . 1116265_1126285
and that's what's shown in these two histograms here . 1126725_1128665
or two experiments one with the with systemic administration the others with iontophoretic administration directly <on to the> on to the cell bodies themselves . 1129945_1137725
and so the way you read these kinds of things these are called &-uh rate event histograms it's the standard way electrophysiologists often display data . 1137945_1145565
so what you have here are spikes per second . 1146025_1148425
that is how many times that neuron you're recording fom &-uh from discharges an action potential . 1149205_1154705
and usually in these kinds of experiments while you're recording you actually have the the output of the amplifier hooked up to a speaker and so you whenever you go into an electrophysiology lab like that you'll hear a speaker going making sounds like <pop pop> pop pop <pop pop> pop pop and each pop is an action potential discharge that's recorded from the speaker . 1155505_1172685
and you can record these action potential discharges through some time bin . 1173885_1177785
so we have time here . 1177845_1178545
and so each of these time bins might be I don't know what these are right here but let's say each each line up is a minute . 1178825_1186325
and so what you record is in a minute bin how many times the cell fires and so maybe in this period here before the animal gets LSD you can see the cell is firing at approximately I don't know forty &~fif fifty action potentials per second . 1187765_1203785
so it's &~dis &~dis discharging away pretty quick +... 1204525_1206345
&~w within this time window . 1209745_1210805
then at this point the animal's given LSD intravenously . 1211405_1214125
you just give the animal an injection of LSD and just keep recording . 1214485_1217185
and what you find is is after a short period of time you get this inhibition of unit firing . 1217765_1223025
and so you see +... 1223405_1224065
the decrease in in in unit firing that after ten fifteen minutes or so is starting to come back and if you wait &-uh you_know fifteen twenty thirty minutes it'll then come back to normal . 1226385_1236045
okay ? 1236565_1236685
so LSD given intravenously turns off basically serotonin neurons . 1237105_1243705
this just shows the same kind of data but &~in instead of injecting LSD intravenously you're just squirting a little puff of LSD a little tiny amount directly on to the single cell you're recording from and that's shown here . 1244145_1256265
so in this case the LSD is applied where that little bar is . 1256625_1261005
it's just applied very very briefly . 1261125_1262545
and &-uh this is just showing the application of serotonin itself and you get a little bit of inhibition for a short period of time . 1263185_1271565
and then the drug is very quickly washed away when you do this kind of stuff . 1271945_1274625
and then here's an application of a certain amount of LSD and it also produces inhibition . 1275065_1279305
so this is showing two things . 1279705_1280925
one it's showing that serotonin itself the effect of serotonin injected onto serotonin cell bodies is to inhibit those cells . 1281065_1291125
that's presumably &-uh an effect that's mediated through the action of serotonin on &{l=SIC hibitory@n$adj &}l=SIC autoreceptors located on the cell bodies or the dendrites of those cells . 1292545_1302185
and that LSD mimics the action of serotonin . 1303385_1307285
on those cells . 1307585_1309285
just like serotonin it inhibits the firing rate of serotonin cells . 1309625_1314865
and so the electrophysiology here of_course is completely consistent with the neurochemistry . 1316295_1321575
in fact the electrophysiology suggests why you get this neurochemical profile . 1322515_1327135
you give LSD serotonin cells stop firing they're discharging less . 1327555_1333235
if they're discharging less they're releasing less neurotransmitter if they're releasing less neurotransmitter you would see &~de increased content decrease metabolism . 1333595_1342415
so the electrophysiology the neurochemistry both suggest what's going on here is that LSD is acting presynaptically . 1343615_1352555
and &~s it's from those kinds of data and there's a_lot other examples of those kinds of data . 1353015_1357775
but it's those kinds of data that led to the hypothesis at that time that what LSD and other hallucinogens are doing is acting as agonists remember in the peripheral tissue the hypothesis was that LSD's acting as an antagonist . 1358095_1374075
now you get completely switched a hundred and eighty degrees to the hypothesis that LSD is acting as an &~an agonist . 1374935_1381535
that is it's mimicking the action of serotonin at inhibitory autoreceptors located on serotonin cell bodies . 1382745_1390085
okay ? 1391005_1392485
so the idea here is here's the serotonin cell body down in the raphe nucleus . 1392545_1396865
those serotonin cell bodies send their axons up to neocortical regions . 1397865_1402245
the red things &~re are supposed to represent serotonin receptors . 1402785_1406105
so this would be a serotonin autoreceptor . 1406525_1408305
this would be a postsynaptic serotonin receptor on a postsynaptic cell in the neocortex . 1408945_1413305
and the idea is is that where LSD is acting is at these autoreceptors located on the serotonin cell bodies . 1414045_1422185
and the effect of a transmitter serotonin itself on an autoreceptor like that we already you already know from the very first lectures in this class is usually to to mediate a negative feedback . 1423485_1435705
&-uh loop that results in decreased cell fiber . 1436945_1439865
okay ? 1441665_1441825
so it makes sense . 1441905_1443305
so LSD is simply acting as a serotonin agonist . 1443605_1447045
it's mimicking the action serotonin . 1447165_1448645
the site that is primarily acting is at autoreceptors on the cell bodies shutting the serotonin cells down and then the idea was in terms of explaining hallucinatory kinds of effects . 1448945_1461265
is what that would do is result in disinhibition of cortical regions . 1461745_1465485
now people assume that hallucinogens hafta have &~s hafta be influencing neocortical activity to produce the hallucinogenic effects . 1465985_1474005
which makes sense if you think about it for a while . 1474485_1476165
because what are hallucinations ? 1476385_1477725
it's seeing things out there or hearing things . 1477865_1480265
I mean you have very complex sensory perceptual phenomenon that are created by these drugs . 1480505_1485765
and it's hard to imagine that one creates de_novo objects out there in the world that look for all intents and purposes like they're real through brain stem things . 1486625_1496265
I mean those are cortical phenomenon . 1496345_1497645
those are cortical level sensory perceptual phenomenon . 1497745_1500405
and so it's always been assumed that at some level hallucinogens hafta be influencing higher order sensory perceptual cortical kinds of systems . 1501205_1511745
and but how do you how do you get to the neocortex if what LSD's doing is acting down here in the brain stem on serotonin neurons ? 1512705_1521685
the idea is that these serotonin neurons project diffusely to the cortex serotonin's primarily an inhibitory transmitter . 1522025_1528745
so when serotonin's released up here it causes inhibition . 1529325_1533205
and so the effect of LSD is to inhibit an inhibitory neuron the serotonin neuron . 1534445_1540125
which will lead to disinhibition of the cortex and these cortical cells &~nar now starting to fire away on their own . 1540285_1549805
that's disinhibition . 1551085_1552085
and sure you can imagine the scenario you know if your visual cortex cells just start firing away when there's I mean there's usually your visual cortex is supposed to fire when there's sensory input from your eyes and you &~s actually see something . 1552845_1564685
you see that because it's being represented in in in sensory &-uh visual sensory cortical &-uh firing &-uh but if those cells start firing on their own you will see things . 1565165_1576725
&-uh and that's what LSD might be doing is disinhibiting the cortex so that the cortex basically is running away . 1578145_1583665
and people think that kind of thing could then mediate dreams for example . 1584625_1588325
dreams are an example where you are in fact having these sensory perceptual experiences in the absence of any input any sensory input and that's presumably due to the fact that whatever neural systems &~m &-uh that that generate these kind of sensory &-uh sensory perceptual experiences are running on their own . 1588285_1606785
and when they run on their own you get dreams you get things like dreams or you get things like hallucinations if you're awake . 1607405_1613125
so this was the hypothesis . 1613745_1614945
so this was the dominant hypothesis for a number of years . 1617425_1620385
but people then continued to work on this and what you're going to see in the the next few &-um examples of how it very quickly became well it actually not all that quickly but over a number of years many years it became apparent that this can't be true . 1620985_1636265
this presynaptic hypothesis has gotta be wrong . 1636465_1638325
and so what I'm gonna do is run through how evidence continued to accumulate to suggest that this kind of interpretation for the actions of of LSD must be wrong . 1639625_1649045
and (0.5) that is a number of problems started to appear . 1649825_1659185
concerning this presynaptic kind of hypothesis . 1660125_1663505
(0.5) now the first problem came when people actually started studying the behavioral actions of LSD in animal models . 1668705_1678585
now this is a hard thing to do if you think about it for a while . 1679705_1681925
it's how do you study hallucinations in a rabbit or cat or or whatever species you wanna look at . 1682545_1688845
I mean hallucinations are these sensory perceptual events . 1689245_1691825
&-uh and to some extent <you could> you could make the strong form of the argument is it's actually impossible . 1692465_1697445
you can't study hallucinations in anything but humans . 1697705_1700045
because only humans can tell you if they're hallucinating . 1700385_1702445
that can be problematic too because people tell you all kinds of strange stuff . 1703345_1706705
you have no way of knowing if they're really hallucinating or they're just telling you they're hallucinating and that's a problem with human research . 1707445_1712565
&-um but there was a &~wh a whole series of &~s of experiments most of them in cats by a guy named Barry Jacobs at Princeton at this time so this is getting into the seventies early eighties now . 1714545_1725265
where basically what he did was characterize the behavioral profile of a whole variety of &~hallucinogen hallucinogenic agents in cats as as_well_as a bunch of studies in rats . 1726285_1736865
okay so he he just looked at the behavior of the animals very carefully when they were given mescaline or LSD or &-uh &-uh psilocybin and a whole variety of hallucinogens . 1738245_1747525
and what he found was is that animals show very characteristic changes in their patterns of behavior under hallucinogens that are unique that is they're different than the patterns of behaviors you see under psychostimulants or under opiates under amphetamine under cocaine under PCP . 1748365_1766045
and he described what's called sometimes it's called sort_of the hall the hallucinogenic syndrome or sometimes it's called the serotonin syndrome . 1767065_1775225
&-um (be)cause you can get it by manipulating serotonergic systems in other ways . 1775305_1780785
and it's quite vivid in a cat . 1781945_1784485
I mean what you get is this sort_of array of behaviors . 1784665_1789045
and they tend to be things like animals will show excessive grooming sometimes . 1789725_1794025
cats will show funny behaviors where they'll show staring into space and then eye movements that look like eye movements following an object but there's no object there . 1794555_1805995
they'll show paw flicks I mean they'll flick their paws they'll just sort of be sitting there you know do this sort_of stuff . 1806695_1812835
&=laughs:multiple &-uh so there's this whole series of behaviors like that that're tactile grooming away at things on their body looking at things that appearing to look at things that aren't out there . 1813625_1826605
&-uh flipping their limbs . 1827465_1828865
what other kinds of things ? 1829125_1831985
head shakes shaking their head . 1832985_1835125
and this cluster of behaviors is seen with hallucinogens now the interpretation then is is these behaviors are the the overt manifestation of some sort of hallucinatory phenomena going on in their head so it's not hard to imagine you know a cat's sitting there and sees the bird fly in front of them that's not really there and so they follow it . 1836775_1856975
sometimes they'll grasp out at things . 1857635_1859215
&-uh one can imagine tactile kinds of hallucinations where you think there's something on your paw so you go like that . 1859735_1864395
they look like that . 1865065_1865945
now the trouble with all studies of_course is there's no way to know that the cat's really following a bird that's not there or it's trying to shake off something on its paw but that's what it looks like . 1866105_1873885
&-uh so &~the and that's how it's typically interpreted . 1874965_1877925
that is these behaviors are somehow reflecting the the hallucinatory phenomenon . 1878125_1882525
but there's no way ever that that can be proved . 1883645_1886025
at the very least you can say hallucinogens share the ability to produce this behavioral syndrome in in nonhuman animals . 1886775_1895775
I mean that is they all do this and other drugs don't . 1896835_1899115
so it's it is at least a behavioral signature of hallucinatory &~ac actions . 1899255_1903635
so &~given so knowing that you can never prove it but <let's just> let's just assume that in fact this behavioral syndrome is giving you some sort of index in a nonhuman animal of the hallucinatory episode . 1905215_1916755
well if you buy that assumption then you can start studying the &~b behavior the hallucinatory syndrome in animals and the neurochemistry of the electrophysiology or <so on> so on . 1917575_1929895
and the first thing that was noted was the time course of the behavioral effects of &~LS of a a compound like LSD . 1930335_1938395
and the time course of the electrophysiological effects that I already told you about don't match . 1938975_1944195
that is when you give a an animal like a cat or a rat LSD they show this behavior for a long time just like in humans . 1946075_1952575
&~the the &-uh the duration of action of LSD's quite long . 1953035_1955975
so animals will show these kinds of behaviors for many many many hours . 1956205_1960345
just like people &~wi will report hallucinations for many many hours . 1961105_1964265
but if you record from the serotonin cell bodies electrophysiologically you get this inhibition that I told you about you get LSD you get inhibition of &-uh of serotonin neurons . 1965525_1976505
but that doesn't last very long it only lasts for thirty minutes or an hour at most . 1976805_1979805
&~serotermin serotonin cell firing activity comes back to normal so it's completely back to normal but the animals are still showing for many hours later this hallucinatory behavior . 1981205_1990785
well if the hallucinatory behavior is caused by LSD shutting down these cells . 1991545_1996045
then the shell the time course of the inhibition of serotonin neurons should match the time course of the behavior . 1997065_2003225
and it doesn't . 2003605_2004085
so that's doesn't bode well for the idea that there's a direct causal relationship between ability of LSD to shut off serotonin neurons and produce hallucinations . 2005665_2015105
okay this is the kind of study that it's impossible to do this kind thing in a human of_course . 2015905_2018745
you'd hafta have a human you'd hafta put an electrode in their brain record from the cells and you can't do these kind of things . 2019445_2026465
so that was the one of the first problems . 2027645_2029225
one of the next problems that came up is that people started studying tolerance and crosstolerance . 2030505_2036785
of the behavior the behavioral syndrome in relation to the electrophysiological syndrome . 2036985_2044385
and that didn't match either . 2044965_2046165
I already told you if you give LSD repeatedly you get marked tolerance in humans . 2047145_2052645
that is that you &~ge you after a few administrations you don't get very you don't get a much of a hallucinatory syndrome in humans and that's also true in the animals . 2054105_2061485
so this whole syndrome of flicking things off and and looking at apparently looking at objects flying through space in front of them &-uh if you give the drug daily that phenomena disappears there's tolerance to that hallucinatory syndrome . 2062245_2076805
but there isn't tolerance to the electrophysiological effects . 2079385_2082865
(0.8) &~th the other thing I should mention that I've &~been forgot to mention here as we went from the early studies academia studies showing inhibition of the cells all of his original studies there was no behavior &~th there was no behavior being measured because in those studies all the animals were anesthetized during the &-uh recording procedures . 2091865_2110565
the big &~ad advantage here is when people started looking at the behavior is techniques were developed so that you could record the electrophysiology in an animal that was awake and and moving . 2111065_2122065
so you could record the behavior now simultaneously with the electrophysiology . 2122645_2126805
and it's only when you start doing the behavior and the electrophysiology at the same time in a in in a in an awake preparation that you &~s would ever see these mismatches because of_course in an anesthetized animal there is no behavior . 2127305_2140465
and so there's no way to know whether the time course of the drug effect behaviorally is matching the time course of the electrophysiological effect . 2141525_2148585
so these these studies now are all in awake preparations . 2148885_2152505
and that's true of the tolerant studies as well . 2153105_2154665
so you give the drug a number of times the behavioral syndrome goes away but the electrophysiological effect decreasing serotonin cell firing isn't going away . 2154745_2164845
it's not showing any tolerance . 2165085_2166225
<day after> day after day you get as big an effect as ever for the unit activity but the behavior's disappearing . 2166845_2184225
how can the inhibition of the unit firing account for the behavior when the behavior is changing over time the function of tolerance and the electrophysiological effects aren't . 2174905_2186385
another one hasta do with crosstolerance . 2187085_2188925
I told you that there was crosstolerance between all of these hallucinogens . 2188985_2193845
between &~s drugs like escaline and or escaline &=laughs mescaline and LSD . 2194005_2199905
&-uh and that's also true for this behavioral phenomenon . 2201065_2204025
if you give animals repeated LSD and then give them mescaline they're tolerant in terms of the ability of mescaline to produce this hallucinatory behavioral syndrome . 2204525_2213765
but there's no crosstolerance for the unit effect . 2215205_2217465
so if you give animals LSD and you get inhibition &~you first of all you don't get inhibition to &~L or &-uh tolerance to LSD itself . 2217625_2225485
and you don't get crosstolerance to mescaline . 2225785_2230405
and we know in humans the hallucinatory effects show crosstolerance we know now in the animals that the behavioral effects show crosstolerance but the electrophysiological effects don't show crosstolerance . 2228865_2238365
it's like this ability to inhibit serotonin you know firing is not going with the behavioral syndrome +... 2239605_2245425
and one of the final pieces of evidence that completely killed the presynaptic hypothesis this put it to death with these ones you can come up with convoluted explanations as to how it can still work but there were a series of lesion studies that that just killed the presynaptic hypothesis . 2249215_2269415
and these studies became possible +... 2270495_2272095
&-uh when specific neurotoxins were developed that allowed people to selectively destroy the serotonin cells . 2275415_2284275
so you use +//. 2285095_2286835
&~i &~th these are toxins like six hydroxy dopamine which is used to destroy dopamine neurons this is a different one . 2287115_2291795
it's five seven dihydroxytryptamine or something like that . 2291935_2294495
you inject it down into the region of the serotonin cell bodies and it kills the serotonin cells . 2294775_2300155
now of_course if it kills the serotonin cells there is no autoreceptor down here anymore because these are gone these cells are just gone . 2300935_2309035
okay so now you have an animal that doesn't have any serotonin neurons . 2311415_2315035
what happens if you give it LSD ? 2316295_2317695
it shows the full hallucinatory syndrome . 2318175_2322015
(0.5) in fact it shows even enhanced &~hallucina an enhanced hallucinatory syndrome which I'll get to in a little while what that might be . 2326345_2334425
now that absolutely kills a presynaptic hypothesis (be)cause remember the presynaptic hypothesis was serotonin's acting at this receptor right here . 2334545_2344965
you take away the cell the receptor's not there anymore and you &~d and the animals seem to be hallucinating better under LSD . 2346145_2352985
suggesting that the serotonin cells aren't at all necessary for hallucinogens to have their hallucinogenic effect at least in these animal models &-uh and it's not acting here now have to keep in mind is these serotonin receptors are still there . 2354325_2372865
there're still serotonin receptors located postsynaptically on these cells in the neocortex and hippocampus . 2373665_2379945
all you've done is remove the serotonin cell itself and the autoreceptors but there're still serotonin receptors in the brain . 2380215_2386995
which is gonna take you obviously to the next hypothesis . 2388175_2390955
(be)cause the only thing that's left are postsynaptic serotonin receptors . 2391875_2395415
(0.4) what else did I wanna tell you about this +..? 2398975_2401415
okay is everyone clear on this so far ? 2405375_2407995
it's a nice story all fits together makes sense and then it starts to shift . 2409185_2412665
(0.7) so this lesion study did away with the presynaptic hypothesis . 2414585_2424205
there's absolutely no way well +... 2426145_2428885
absolutely no way's too strong . 2430345_2432525
see the the caveat that you still have to keep in the back of your mind is this whole series of sort_of logical steps is based on an assumption and the assumption is animals going like this is telling you something about hallucinations . 2433695_2448735
and this is always the assumption that's in the back of these studies . 2449675_2452175
what you really wanna do is take some people knock out their serotonin neurons give them LSD and see if they +//. 2452795_2459815
and ask them if they hallucinate . 2459955_2460855
&=laughs:multiple it might be interesting for example to look at people that have had a_lot_of use of MDMA where you might lose serotonin terminals and one would predict in chronic MDMA &~u users that serotonin &-uh <that &-uh> that &-uh that you might get &~ef effects equivalent to these kinds of lesions . 2462815_2484055
on the other hand if you take &~pe if you could take people that didn't have these cells and now they didn't hallucinate to LSD anymore the hypothesis I'm going to tell you about now would be dead . 2487175_2495775
that's probably not gonna be tested . 2497675_2498875
very easily anyway . 2499375_2500755
so the postsynaptic hypothesis what in &~the where does it come from ? 2501435_2504875
well first of all now we're getting into the late eighties and nineties with the discovery of all of these different serotonin receptors . 2505695_2513255
fourteen different kinds of serotonin receptors and with the discovery of all these different serotonin receptors the development of a whole variety of serotonin receptor agonists that &~were are very specific . 2513685_2526325
serotonin receptor agonists that are specific for serotonin you know five HT one five HT two five HT one a@l two a@l and so on . 2526505_2535645
so there's drugs that are becoming available now for the first time that allow researchers to probe the function of specific serotonin receptor populations . 2535705_2544605
there's a serotonin receptor pharmacology developing . 2545365_2547885
and that really is still developing there's still not one of the problems with the whole serotonin field is there are some drugs available for &~ac &~f that act on some serotonin receptor subtypes but it's you know there's cross talk they're not great they're all a little dirty . 2548285_2563345
there isn't a really really good &~s &-uh sort_of &-uh armamentarium of pharmacological agents that allows people to study synergistic systems . 2563415_2572455
but it &~ju there's quite a few . 2572715_2574255
and one of the first things &~w as these serotonin selective drugs were discovered was the was with the development of serotonin specifically five HT two a@l receptor antagonist kinds of drugs was that these kinds of drugs five HT two a@l antagonists antagonize the effect of LSD . 2575105_2599445
(0.5) so if you pretreat animals with a five HT two a@l receptor antagonist and now give it LSD the animals don't show these hallucinatory behaviors . 2605585_2618125
so it antagonizes this hallucinatory behavioral syndrome . 2618905_2621385
and by the way it doesn't antagonize the effects of LSD on unit firing . 2622865_2629865
so in the presence of the five HT two a@l receptor antagonist you give LSD and you record from those serotonin cells they decrease their firing rate so that effect does not antagonize . 2630665_2642645
this is more evidence against the presynaptic hypothesis +... 2642925_2645625
but the animals don't show this hallucinatory syndrome . 2649785_2652025
again dissociating those two events . 2652725_2654205
and suggesting that LSD hasta be able to get access to a specific subtype serotonin receptor a five HT two a@l receptor for it to have its effects . 2654515_2666915
five HT two a@l serotonin receptors are thought to be primarily postsynaptic receptors . 2667555_2671975
the presynaptic receptors are &~n thought not to be five HT two type receptors and that fits . 2672555_2677955
because it doesn't antagonize the unit effects and it the five HT two a@l antagonist shouldn't antagonize the unit effects if this receptor down here is not a five HT two receptor . 2679675_2690335
so that's one thing . 2690895_2692975
that's suggesting a postsynaptic action because an antagonist at a receptor that's located postsynaptically antagonizes hallucinatory effects . 2693415_2700415
the second kind of evidence came from these &~lesi these kinds of lesion studies that are demonstrated here . 2701985_2709545
and I told you that if you take animals that have these serotonin neurons depleted or or destroyed so serotonin is depleted up here in the cortex that the animals actually show hypersensitivity to LSD . 2710305_2724005
they show bigger apparently hallucinatory effects to LSD than animals who don't have a lesion . 2724585_2729785
why why would that be ? 2731595_2732815
well it seems as if the reason that is is a phenomena called denervation supersensitivity . 2733495_2738675
how many people know what denervation supersensitivity is ? 2739495_2741635
you should've had that in thirty thirty . 2742155_2743435
I don't see a whole lot o(f) hands going up . 2744575_2746235
&=laughs:multiple okay . 2747755_2748095
lemme explain denervation supersensitivity is sort_of a phenomena that you see in pretty much all neurotransmitter systems . 2748375_2754575
it's been very very well studied in neuromuscular junction . 2754855_2757255
you see it in all neurotransmitter systems . 2757615_2759175
and it's sorta +//. 2759675_2760495
I've illustrated it here . 2760695_2761695
it's called denervation supersensitivity and and this is called innervation . 2762875_2766535
that is this cell is usually denervated by the serotonin neuron . 2767415_2771475
if you kill the serotonin neuron you denervate this cell . 2772295_2777455
or if you cut the peripheral nerves going to a muscle you denervate the muscle . 2779335_2784695
you denervate the muscle and of_course you paralyze it if you do that . 2785515_2789035
that's denervation . 2789475_2790235
if you &~d denervate excitable tissues whether they be muscles or your heart muscle or neurons if you denervate them of their normal input they tend to compensate . 2791355_2803435
that's the supersensitivity part of it . 2805235_2806975
and the one +//. 2807615_2808155
the way they compensate primarily is to make more receptors for whatever input is lost . 2808275_2813435
so in this case you've taken away serotonin input here . 2813755_2816695
and you remember on the previous drawing I only had one receptor showing now there are two . 2817435_2821555
and you can measure this receptor supersensitivity in many many many tissues following denervation . 2822435_2828275
so if you denervate a muscle for example of its acetylcholine input at the neuromuscular junction and then measure how many acetylcholine receptors are in the muscle they increase dramatically . 2828615_2837055
you just make a_lot more receptors . 2837215_2838495
if you denervate a serotonin cell and now you go in and measure the number of receptors on these cells there's a_lot more receptors . 2840135_2845315
if you denervate the &~st striatum of its dopamine input you get a whole bunch more dopamine receptors on cells that have dopamine receptors . 2845795_2853035
okay ? 2853455_2853535
so it's denervation supersensitivity . 2853535_2855615
you denervate and you get supersensitivity and &~this and the nature of the supersensitivity is to upgrade delayed receptors . 2856135_2861555
I mean it's a compensatory response so you just you lose an input and the postsynaptic cell is literally trying to compensate for the last lost input by generating a whole bunch more receptors so &~th there's at least a little bit of transmitter left around you will still get an effect there because of this phenomenon of denervation supersensitivity . 2862285_2879965
and so the concept of denervation supersensitivity is what's used to explain the enhanced hallucinatory effects of LSD in an animal that has a lesion . 2881145_2890365
that is if serotonin or &~a if LSD is acting at some postsynaptic receptors here and you denervate and you now have &~po more postsynaptic receptors you should shift the dose effect curve for the hallucinatory effects of LSD to the left . 2890885_2906265
and that's exactly what happens . 2906645_2907685
and not only that if you do if you relate the behavior to the chemistry what you find is is that there's a very strong correlation between the degree of receptor supersensitivity and specifically of five HT two a@l type receptor supersensitivity . 2908305_2924245
and the hallucinatory syndrome produced by LSD . 2925545_2927905
so presumedly what's happening is your building more five HT two a@l receptors in a denervated animal . 2928865_2934285
you give LSD if LSD is acting here LSD has a bigger effect (be)cause there's more receptors for it to act on . 2934465_2939985
that's a piece of evidence to suggest that LSD is acting postsynaptically on these receptors . 2940285_2946005
and what you're doing by denervating is &+upreg +//. 2946405_2947965
it's a way to up regulate the receptor population so you up regulate the receptor population the behavioral hallucinatory syndrome goes up . 2948285_2955705
the two are going together . 2956025_2956765
now you go back to the presynaptic hypothesis for tolerance crosstolerance and they don't change together you dissociate . 2958405_2963305
<do I have> xxx +/.
+, yeah .
+, they're going together here that's good for this hypothesis . 2964145_2966765
you see the same thing with tolerance . 2968325_2969885
you give a drug like LSD repeatedly you get tolerance to the behavioral effects . 2972165_2975965
if you give LSD repeatedly and then go in and do the chemistry and measure how many five HT two a@l receptors there are they go down . 2977085_2984405
so there's two manipulations where you manipulate the number of five HT two a@l receptors . 2985345_2990585
one down regulate them with tolerance and the behavior down regulates . 2991045_2996905
up regulate them with denervation supersensitivity and the behavior up regulates . 2997225_3001085
so the behavioral syndrome the hallucinatory syndrome is covarying with the number of of five HT two a@l receptors . 3001485_3010925
(0.5) third kind of evidence are purely correlational from binding studies . 3016895_3020975
or fourth kind of evidence . 3022515_3023395
and in these kinds of studies <I don't> I'm showing it here this is sort_of +//. 3024335_3030815
just look at the &-uh the top panel just ignore the bottom panel I'm not gonna talk about it . 3031015_3035235
this is sort_of a standard way to look at these kind of things and I've showed you examples of this in other systems where we've talked about you ask a simple question . 3036075_3043135
if the ability of hallucinogens is related to their ability to bind to five HT two a@l receptors then there should be a good correlation between the ability of different &~drug drugs to bind with those receptors and the ability of different drugs to produce hallucinations . 3043945_3062405
and this is the one kind of evidence where you can actually go to humans now . 3062605_3066085
because what you can ask about is you can give different drugs and this is human dose and you can ask of all of these in every dot here one two three four five six seven eight nine ten &~elev all of these dots are a different drug . 3066635_3079595
so here's LSD . 3080295_3081115
here's DMA . 3081955_3082575
here's DOM . 3083115_3083695
and all of these are different hallucinogens . 3083935_3085975
&-uh and you can ask how potent they are in humans . 3087095_3090375
that's how big a dose do you need to give a human to get a certain level of hallucinatory activity . 3091405_3095865
you see LSD's way up here on the dose effect curve . 3096465_3098845
and I told you LSD's by far the most potent hallucinogen . 3099205_3101745
and that's +//. 3102285_3102625
LSD stands out by itself and all these other guys are down here . 3102805_3105265
so these drugs are relatively not potent . 3105565_3108545
you need high doses to get good hallucinations . 3108925_3111145
LSD's very potent you need relatively low doses . 3111625_3114165
so here you have human hallucinatory potency rather than limb flicks and and eye movements . 3114585_3120785
and you relate that to the ability of these different drugs to bind specifically to five HT two receptors &~an and this has been done specifically to five HT two a@l receptors . 3121785_3130525
and what you get is a very strong correlation . 3131025_3132985
correlation &~i &-uh our value's point nine . 3133505_3135805
perfect correlation's one . 3136025_3137085
so it's extremely high correlation . 3137345_3139045
so if you look across a range of different hallucinatory or &~hallucin hallucinogenic drugs there's a very good correlation between their ability to bind to the five HT two a@l receptor and their ability to produce real hallucinations in people . 3139745_3152905
which provides strong support for all of the animal literature here that I've been showing you . 3153205_3159065
it's also suggesting that this limb flick syndrome really is telling you something about hallucinations it's it's fitting together . 3159265_3166525
(0.4) any questions so far ? 3171105_3172125
this all just crystal clear ? 3173925_3175025
(0.4) you know you have an exam on Tuesday and this stuff's covered . 3177585_3181725
okay +... 3182125_3183765
I have a question . 3186445_3187285
&=laughs:multiple can you go over the effects of tolerance again ? 3187625_3201085
okay the effect of tolerance was just <you can> &~act you can think of both of these this and this as just being two ways where you form some manipulation that causes receptors five HT two a@l receptors to down regulate so you have fewer of them or you have more of them . 3192065_3209865
okay so with tolerance if you give LSD repeatedly what happens is if you go in and look and measure just assay with a binding assay the number of five HT two receptors in animals that have been made tolerant given repeated injection of LSD you get down regulation you get fewer five HT two a@l receptors . 3210525_3228445
and you get behavioral tolerance . 3229445_3231925
that is the behavioral syndrome that you get in the animal is decreased . 3232185_3236865
so if receptors go down behavior goes down . 3237185_3239405
and then there's the loose connection to humans (be)cause you know with humans &~n when you you you get good tolerance as well . 3241945_3247225
with the other one with the denervation supersensitivity you do the lesions receptor populations go up and behavioral potency goes up they show greater potency . 3248625_3258725
so as you &~man as you manipulate the receptor population up or down the behavior follows . 3259325_3264245
(0.4) anything else about &~an any of these ? 3269085_3270325
(0.4) .
I have a question +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so ⌋ the main difference between &~the this hypothesis and the other one is that the action of the serotonin is either presynaptic or postsynaptic ? 3274605_3283065
yeah . 3284185_3284365
I actually haven't given you this hypothesis yet . 3284525_3286665
I'm just giving you the data so far . 3286925_3288245
but I'll I'll state it very clearly in a couple slides . 3288385_3290645
but yeah . 3291165_3292205
that's gonna be the difference . 3292305_3292905
the previous one was that it was acting the previous hypothesis was it was acting at this receptor the presynaptic mechanism . 3292885_3300805
and I'm obviously leading up to it's acting at these guys . 3301405_3303665
and that +//. 3304265_3304465
not only that but these guys are five HT two a@l receptors specifically . 3304805_3308745
and &~th this kind of data suggests that . 3310625_3312645
so if you do this kind_of a correlation with other types of serotonin receptors it doesn't work &~o out as well . 3312765_3317985
and I'll give you another another piece of evidence I mean I told you there are fourteen different kinds of serotonin receptors so you should be asking how do you know it's the five HT two a@l one specifically ? 3318145_3328465
(be)cause there's lots_of other serotonin receptors we've found postsynaptically . 3328965_3332425
and I haven't actually given you good evidence for that yet but that's coming . 3332965_3335525
yeah ? 3336465_3338085
&-um you said that the effect of the antagonist was to decrease the effects of LSD +/. 3338785_3343805
yeah +/.
+, but also <does it> does it decrease also just the overall five HT cell firing ? 3344585_3349825
is that what you said ? 3350425_3351225
no it doesn't have any effect on the cell firing . 3352745_3354685
so if you give a five HT two receptor antagonist you have an electrode in an animal (be)cause you can record serotonin cell firing okay ? 3355325_3365585
&-uh and you give LSD cell firing goes down and the animal show these hallucinatory behavior . 3366305_3373805
now you can experiment where you in your experimental group you give (th)em the five HT two receptor antagonist and do the same experiment now give (th)em LSD what happens ? 3374965_3383945
cell firing still goes down that's not changed but they don't hallucinate they don't show this hallucinatory behavior anymore . 3384025_3390405
it's another dissociation between cell firing . 3391825_3393645
presumably this is not &~t five HT two a@l antagonist is antagonizing the action of serotonin justify these two A receptors there's fourteen other ones there . 3394015_3403195
presumably this is not a five HT two a@l receptor . 3403895_3406355
but some other one is . 3406995_3409655
and it's probably postsynaptic . 3410235_3411595
(be)cause with this there are presynaptic receptors . 3412135_3414115
(0.5) okay . 3416455_3419575
so then there's &~an anything else then on these ? 3419795_3421675
(0.8) the last kind of evidence and this is the kind of pharmacology now that suggests that it's really five HT two a@l receptors and not one of the other fourteen subtypes of receptor . 3430825_3441445
at which LSD must be active to produce its hallucinatory effects . 3443565_3446445
and I think +//. 3448185_3448565
these are pharmacological studies basically looking at the differential affinity of different hallucinogens for different serotonin receptors . 3448695_3459415
so I show you this correlation I'll show you here that there's a very good correlation between binding the five HT two a@l receptor and the ability of drugs to produce hallucinations . 3459995_3468035
but there are there're fourteen other kinds of receptors . 3468415_3470875
you need to do a_lot more pharmacology to convince yourself that it's really the two a@l subtype of of the fourteen that's critical . 3471405_3478865
okay ? 3479905_3482745
and the pharmacology is very complex because there's so many bloody serotonin receptors . 3483065_3487465
this this is sort_of not experimental kind of so much as it is logical . 3489605_3495925
what you do is take this this kind of tactic . 3496305_3498325
you take a whole bunch of hallucinogens mescaline LSD DOM &~PM &-uh DMT psilocybin and so on . 3498365_3506405
and you ask well for all these different drugs they all have different spectrum of activities they influence &~d none of these drugs like LSD is not a clean drug LSD has actions on all kinds of serotonin receptors . 3507465_3518585
so LSD for example if you look for its affinity its ability to bind to different serotonin receptors LSD is promiscuous . 3518685_3526565
LSD binds to five HT type one two five seven six and seven types . 3527365_3532365
so it binds to a whole bunch of different serotonin receptors . 3533065_3535065
the question is which receptors is it binding is it does it bind to to produce this hallucinatory effects +..? 3537165_3546485
it binds to many different kinds . 3549305_3550905
it has many different effects . 3551845_3552805
it has effects on smooth muscle contractions . 3552925_3554605
it has effects on those autoreceptors . 3554765_3557405
it has lots_of different effects . 3557805_3559105
unrelated to its hallucinatory effects . 3561205_3563245
the &~k &~k key question here is which effect is related to its hallucinatory effects ? 3563425_3569525
so LSD's &~very very promiscuous it binds to all kind_of serotonin receptors so that that doesn't tell you . 3570025_3575445
but now you start to look at other &~ki other hallucinogens . 3576065_3578745
so if you look at something like mescaline . 3579105_3581005
you see mescaline which is a hallucinogen shows crosstolerance and LSD doesn't bind to the one five or seven family . 3581865_3588785
well if LSD and mescaline are sharing common actions which &~you everything suggests they are then you can eliminate the one the five and the seven families . 3589945_3599945
which leaves you with the six and the two . 3600905_3603525
and you run through that logic with all the different hallucinogens and what you find is is although different hallucinogens have different spectrums of actions across different serotonin receptor subtypes the one thing that they all share in common is the ability to bind with this five HT two family of receptors . 3604945_3622825
so one may bind to the one . 3623945_3626465
but not the three another one the three and not the one . 3627005_3629805
<and so on> and so on and so on . 3630265_3631165
but you run through twenty drugs and the one thing they all end up +//. 3631705_3634965
that share hallucinatory actions but don't share other actions the one thing you come up with is they share an affinity for the five HT two family . 3636065_3642845
and now it gets a little dicy in terms of the logic in terms of narrowing it down to five HT two a@l receptors . 3644245_3650365
but &~th the logic goes for example that five HT two &~r A receptors are the the type of two receptors that show the greatest discretion in in regions like the neocortex . 3650505_3661705
and now we go back to the idea of hallucinogens hafta be acting on the neocortex to produce hallucinatory effects . 3662205_3666965
you can't make up pictures of tigers in your mind without your cortex . 3667445_3671085
and most of these other subtypes aren't found highly as highly expressed in the neocortex . 3671625_3678325
it's the two a@l type of two receptors . 3678755_3681335
not the two b@l or the two c@l or the two d@l that are highly expressed in neocortex . 3681795_3686955
that's one . 3687475_3687955
and then the other line of evidence of_course is that it's the five HT two a@l antagonist that antagonizes LSD's actions . 3688575_3696455
so you put those kind &~of that kind of pharmacology together and what you end up with is the prevailing hypothesis this is now the prevailing hypothesis on how hallucinogens work is what they're doing is acting as five HT two a@l receptor agonists . 3696905_3715045
they're acting at five HT two a@l serotonin receptors and they're mimicking the action of serotonin at those receptors . 3716065_3721705
they're acting as agonists . 3722605_3723465
okay .
and so this is the &~m this is what people now think &-uh all of the hallucinogens are doing to produce a hallucinatory effect . 3727105_3738025
they're doing other things to produce their other effects but this is what they're doing to produce the hallucinatory effects . 3738505_3742305
but one lesson you should also take away here of_course is is we've ran through some data that was pretty convincing for a hypothesis at that time &-uh you_know what kind of data's gonna come up over the next ten years ? 3743065_3758345
&-uh and will this kinda hypothesis be action . 3758925_3760885
but make the hypothesis the postsynaptic hypothesis very clear now . 3761245_3765065
it's the idea then you have postsynaptic receptors . 3765505_3767565
up here in the neocortex presumably LSD is binding to that receptor presumably because its structural similarity to serotonin . 3768225_3778125
the reason it binds to a serotonin receptor is remember it's structurally similar to a &~ser to to to serotonin itself . 3778185_3784165
and it's not acting as an antagonist there it's acting as an agonist and &-uh mimicking the action of serotonin . 3784825_3791225
why do you think it's acting as an agonist instead of an antagonist ? 3792165_3795965
the &~m main kind of evidence there is that an antagonist antagonizes its actions . 3796445_3800785
which is actually isn't all that strong evidence . 3801685_3803625
(0.5) so the second &~win the &-uh &~s the &-uh let's back up a little bit . 3804765_3813725
&~different this is a an example of differentiating whether a compound is an agonist or antagonist in producing these kinds of effects can be pretty tricky . 3814285_3821205
so &~LS the evidence I've &~pu suggested that LSD's binding to a five HT two a@l receptor and it is &-uh producing this hallucinatory effects from the from binding to that other receptor . 3821665_3833005
but is it mimicking the action of serotonin at this receptor or is it antagonizing the action of serotonin at this receptor ? 3833305_3837885
it's &~ha it's from what I've told you it's actually hard to tell . 3838765_3841625
&-uh one reason people think that it's acting as an agonist and probably one of the strongest reasons is is that five HT two receptor antagonists are not hallucinatory +... 3842785_3854245
so that suggests that it's it's <it's an> &~a it's an agonist . 3857785_3861065
(0.4) now let's see there were a couple +... 3861825_3868425
okay there are two other things that I wanted to say . 3871485_3873285
one of them is is &~a again just to stress this caveat that a_lot_of this sort_of logic was built up in terms of how &~hallucinato hallucinogens act is based on this assumption that animals going like this and showing xxx movements are really having hallucinations . 3874245_3892945
and that's &~ve I mean that's impossible to prove . 3893965_3895805
the evidence is all consistent with it so it's reasonable &-uh but that's pretty hard to prove . 3896395_3901055
to really really test a hypothesis what you wanna be able to do and these are the studies that have never been done is take someone like one of you guys give you LSD get you hallucinating and then do the pharmacology . 3901935_3915275
give you a five HT two a@l receptor antagonist give you a five HT one receptor and do the pharmacology and see whether or not you can in fact do simple &~question do five HT two antagonists prevent hallucinations in real people . 3915445_3929105
never been done . 3929605_3930025
can't do it . 3930325_3931185
not allowed . 3931565_3931985
that probably will never be &~as answered unless some pharmacologist in some lab someplace has probably actually done the experiment on themselves but they can't publish it . 3932905_3941265
&=laughs:multiple the other thing I should mention here is sort_of a mystery in this field is what the endogenous ligand is at this five HT two A receptor . 3944585_3955565
it's called the serotonin receptor it's a five HT two a@l receptor . 3956305_3959845
but in actual fact serotonin has very low affinity for that receptor . 3961045_3966365
it's don't know if I wrote it down +... 3967485_3968885
yeah so serotonin if you look at the affinity of serotonin for the five HT two a@l receptor it's in the micromolar range . 3972635_3981415
just to give you &~a a comparison at the five HT two one receptor &~tha &~th those types of receptors serotonin has nanomolar affinity . 3983215_3991115
okay ?
thousand fold greater affinity . 3991875_3993415
so serotonin itself is actually not a very good ligand at the five HT two a@l receptor . 3993945_4000925
these hallucinogens are better ligands than serotonin . 4002065_4005285
which has led people to raise the possibility that maybe serotonin's not the endogenous ligand at five HT two a@l receptor . 4006065_4013405
maybe it's not really a serotonin receptor at all . 4013705_4016005
okay .
serotonin has affinity for it but not very good affinity . 4017345_4020125
which raises the possibility that in your brain some place is in this yet undiscovered endogenous ligand for the five HT two receptor that is your brain's own LSD . 4020695_4032775
and it just simply hasn't been discovered yet . 4034635_4036395
and that's no one knows if that <might be> might be the case . 4036735_4040055
but that is a mystery I mean why does serotonin have such low affinity for this receptor ? 4040355_4043355
&-um if like someone reported to an emergency room with a bad acid trip would they give him a a compound to pull him out_of it ? 4043705_4051945
no .
they they couldn't do anything you know &~could in that setting could they try ? 4053385_4058185
put him in a safe place talk to him nicely and &=laughs:multiple it'll wear off . 4058345_4062645
it's not that dangerous . 4063005_4063785
could that be a setting where they could try the serotonin antagonist ? 4064125_4067665
well these are not yet &~the these compounds have lots_of other effects they're not the kind of things that that you would do to antagonize &-uh a bad trip . 4068035_4078255
okay exam on Tuesday don't forget . 4080535_4097915
