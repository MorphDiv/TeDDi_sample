could &~y could you email it to her or something ? 117945_119485
I was thinking about that . 119825_121005
I'm +//.
the thing I'm most worried about is that I want a letter of recommendation from her and I feel like she's gonna be like you know she didn't really turn in a very good paper for me last semester and now she's not even doing this one I only &~kn I know she's only taking a couple classes like +/. 121165_134725

+, yeah I might not be able to or I need to see if like someone else could like kinda just take it on right now or if Frank if I could be like oh Frank will you just write it ? 174505_182805
or something like that you know . 182885_183765
uhuh mhm +/.
+, yeah . 184165_184605
well so I got the extension from him and then I finally just ended up talking to my professor on North Campus about it . 187275_193995
and I told her what I was interested in doing and then I was like could I use the research ? 194155_197995
and she was like +//. 198155_198655
(be)cause there's several different parcels of research like there's like five different communities I think in Detroit that they did interviews with and like &~s like <peer &~g> the &~diff there're different characteristics for all of (th)em . 198915_209955
some of (th)em are like industrial areas . 210015_211495
some of (th)em are retail areas . 211655_212435
and so some of them &~a &-um all of them are gonna be going into the research that she does at the end of the year and stuff . 213025_219445
but also like she went to like different neighborhood organizations like maybe like &-um employment organizations and things in the area and was like +"/. 219765_227705
+" do you guys want some of the information that we get from this stuff ? 227885_230485

+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ helpful to ⌉ them . 231785_232345
so that's what I've been working on a_lot for her last year was doing that for a couple &-um like &-uh industrial organizations around the area and some of them haven't been done at all . 232945_243305
so she wanted me to do some of those &-um for my project . 243885_249065
<so then> &=laughs:multiple so then I would do them and I would put that in my project . 249445_253785
like I would have a part that was like this is empowerment zones in Detroit . 253985_257165
+, yeah +/. 257685_257725
+, this is &-um like what local labor market theory is and then like this is one specific thing so I would &~on also get I would paid for it . 257995_267635
&=laughs ⌊ which is kind_of cool ⌋ .

+, yeah +/. 292545_292645
+, I don't know . 293025_293365
and then I got &-um some good articles so I'm still reading some articles about theory but my plan is to read these articles about theory and then &-um read the rough draft that someone made +/. 293805_307045
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.

or oh you mean the people who were interviewed ? 334225_336025
yeah . 336805_336865
&-um I think that when they went around and did the interviews &~o the one of the questions was like would you be interested in seeing our results ? 337445_343365
or something +/. 343465_343765
