okay . 875_1135
so, your first question is basically why did some colonists oppose independence and do their arguments seem reasonable ? 1175_10175
okay .
so, if you have an answer to why some colonists opposed independence, and if it's reasonable, raise your hand . 11195_16875
does anybody want to take this one on right away ? 16995_19275
xxx .
can you repeat the question ? 20875_22615
yeah, it's right at the front screen . 23095_24455
okay . 24615_24755
so, how about we start with the first one ? 24895_27475
why did some colonists oppose independence ? 27745_29845
so, you guys just did this . 30205_31125
you guys just gave me like four or five different reasons of why someone might oppose independence . 31265_39105
S_two .
can you give me one reason ? 39485_40805
xxx .
I'm sorry . 43425_47785
can you say that again ? 47965_48505
ports would be destroyed . 48985_50205
okay . 50645_50845
so, ports would be destroyed . 51145_52745
all right . 52865_55965
let's see . 55695_56195
is there another reason ? 56755_58835
why did some colonists oppose independence ? 59035_61015
S_three .
xxx .
giving them what they need . 61115_66035
what people would do that ? 67895_68735
like Great Britain would stop giving them what they need . 69275_71875
okay . 72475_72835
so, Great Britain would stop supporting them . 73015_75455
okay . 75875_77315
let's see . 77935_80075
are there any other reasons of why we should oppose independence ? 81345_84225
S_four .
they're going to destroy land . 84825_86325
they're going to destroy land . 87005_88305
okay .
so, not just ports, but S_four is also saying, land would be destroyed . 89665_96965
okay . 97585_98205
is there any other reasons that we could have ? 98365_100765
S_five .
they're scared to fight . 102165_103605
okay . 104965_105305
that's an interesting one . 106805_107985
so some colonists might oppose independence because they're scared to fight . 108385_113325
all right .
S_six, give me one more . 115305_117425
people will die . 117965_118725
okay . 119425_119665
so, we're going to, there's a risk of casualties . 120305_122645
all right .
so, you guys just gave me a couple of really good reasons that some colonists would oppose independence . 124925_132085
now that we have a couple of reasons up there, I want to know, do these arguments seem reasonable ? 134305_139605
okay . 140925_141285
so, look at what some of your classmates said . 141585_143405
does it seem reasonable to be a loyalist ? 143925_148025
because if there's independence, ports would be destroyed or Great Britain would stop supporting them . 148165_154265
xxx .
so, I guess what I want you to do is maybe turn and talk to a neighbor and decide if there are any of those reasons that you think, okay . 156865_166345
yes .
that totally makes sense to be a loyalist, or are there any reasons that say no, that doesn't seem reasonable . 166845_172605
so, I'm going to give you a minute, turn and talk to a neighbor . 172825_174845
xxx .
talk to S_seven . 176625_177765
xxx .
which ones though ? 177965_180845
all of them . 181005_181945
xxx .
all of them seem reasonable ? 182065_183445
you can't think of anything that was, that doesn't really make sense to be a loyalist ? 183665_186985
the thing that don't makes sense to me is that the ports were destroyed . 187045_189145
the rest makes sense to me . 189445_190505
if the ports are destroyed, then the colonies can't trade and can't get the items that they need . 190685_196065
oh yeah, then that makes sense . 196205_197445
okay . 197445_197725
so, everything makes sense ? 197985_199025
xxx .
all right . 199045_200025
xxx .
what do you guys think ? 200825_203165
are those reasonable reasons to be a loyalist ? 203185_206245
xxx .
it's up to you . 211315_212175
you're free to make your own opinion . 212475_214235
xxx .
all right, class . 215775_223975
xxx .
yes ma'am .
xxx .
okay . 225735_226375
now, does anybody want to share maybe which reason they think or which reason would be maybe the most reasonable ? 227095_235655
which reason makes the most sense to be a loyalist ? 235915_238375
what would made the most sense to be a loyalist ? 238915_241015
S_three, what do you guys say ? 241795_242535
they're scared to fight . 242915_243655
so, that would make the most sense to be a loyalist ? 244035_246675
I wouldn't fight anybody, just saying . 246795_249335
I would . 249695_249915
xxx .
xxx .
okay . 252635_254535
all right .
so, okay . 257175_258735
so, S_three is saying that being scared to fight is the most reasonable reason to be . 258955_264475
oh, okay . 264595_264995
so S_two's disagreeing what you're saying . 265095_266695
so, S_three is saying yes . 267025_268285
scared to fight . 268525_269325
that just makes sense . 269525_270385
you should be a loyalist . 270605_271425
okay . 271645_271745
S_two, you're saying no . 272065_273005
why ? 273085_273285
because in all the wars everyone was scared, but they still fought . 273645_277525
okay . 278465_278785
so, S_two is saying war is scary, no matter what, but you still have to fight . 279085_285085
okay, S_nine . 285265_286545
it says land will be destroyed, right ? 286865_289485
but if there is some people that are still on Great Britain's side, that means they're destroying the people that stuck up for them . 289685_294365
okay . 296235_296455
so, that was kind of one issue that they did have, is that kind of if they do declare independence, almost everybody has to be kind of lumped together in the colonies and everybody's at risk . 296575_306635
xxx other side . 307655_309255
so, yeah . 309475_309615
even if you, sometimes they might've maybe not burned your farm or something like that, but yeah . 309815_315195
you're going to still be kind of suffering right along with everyone else, S_nine . 315275_319055
I think Great Britain was xxx . 319155_324475
they would not have most of the stuff they need .
okay .
they would have not what multiple stuff to eat ? 327235_329395
they would not have most of the stuff they need . 329835_331635
oh, what they need . 332055_332875
okay . 333115_333195
so, S_nine is saying that S_three is reason of Great Britain would stop supporting them would be pretty good because they need a lot of different things to survive in the colonies . 333555_343215
and they wouldn't have access to those . 343335_345075
are there any other reasons ? 345755_347975
cause S_two kind of got in an argument, I think with S_three, a disagreement with S_three, basically that being scared to fight is not a good enough reason . 348805_358165
what do you guys think ? 358365_359365
what do you guys think about that ? 359805_361285
xxx .
no, women did not usually fight . 362345_364645
so, technically I wouldn't be fighting anyway . 365145_366725
okay, but I'm more so concerned . 367145_368965
xxx .
okay .
shh .
I'm more so thinking about you saying that, if you're scared, that is a good enough reason to not fight a war for example . 370945_380605
I mean, sometimes if you want to, if you want to fight for your country, but I'm talking about me personally, I'm not doing that because if you're trying to, this is what I think, if you're trying to fight for something, but then you end up dying, then you don't even get to feel it . 381585_398045
then you don't even get to feel freedom . 398235_399515
so, you would rather die than fight in the war ? 399735_401395
no . 401895_402175
xxx .
no, she's saying that she wouldn't get any benefit out of the end result . 402315_407815
so then why were you over there in the beginning of class ? 408035_410815
well, I don't want to fight . 411115_413375
you just want somebody else to do it for you ? 413375_415415
yes . 415615_415935
okay . 416135_419615
all right .
I totally disagree with S_three . 420175_424975
I mean, back in the day it was either you fight or you go get xxx or it's no point of you even being alive . 425725_433325
okay .
you either just go stay, (be)cause if the person that you fighting with, that's the leader that you fighting with, he, he or she, yeah, he is there to make all the same . 434865_445165
so, you either fight or you get hung . 445285_446725
well, would you +... 447045_447665
I would rather fight . 448445_449505
I, my +... 449785_450225
that's what you might rather do, but we still wouldn't be doing it in the first place because women didn't fight . 450685_453285
xxx .
no, I'm saying if you were a man +... 453705_456405
all right .
