this man was standing at the corner waiting for his friend to come
the policeman was coming down the street trying doors .
and he spoke to him .
and he talked to him .
and he told him that he was waiting for his friend .
they were just like two brothers .
they've been friends for twenty years .
and he said it was a restaurant there .
and they usually would meet there .
and they chatted for a bit .
and he told him, well, he had to move on .
but he hoped that his friend wouldn't be too long coming .
said you're going to wait ?
he said +"/.
+" oh yes .
and I guess about twenty minutes later this tall man shows up .
+" is that you ?
I can't think what his name was .
yes, and he said +"/.
+" is that you Bob ?
whatever .
and he says +"/.
+" yeah .
so they went down the street talking .
says +"/.
+" sorry the restaurant is closed down .
+" we could have had dinner like we did twenty years ago .
and then he somebody lit a cigar .
and the light shone in his face .
and when that happened he realized that that wasn't who he was
it was a policeman .
and he told him he had been under arrest for the last fifteen
while he was .
he noticed that when he lit the cigar .
said he could tell somebody was .
when he knew him twenty years ago he didn't have a Roman nose, a
anyway, so then he went to take him in .
and he handed him a note .
and the note said I was there at the appointed time .
then he found out who he was .
so he couldn't stand to turn him in himself .
but <he had> he went around the corner .
and got somebody else to come and do it .
I went to this program at a church .
and it was called special needs .
it was most interesting because they did so many interesting things
and with people with special needs .
they had some people that they had had since they were eight or
and they had trained them to be ushers in the church .
and various you_know other places in the church .
then it became gift giving time .
and they had this young man come .
and you didn't understand him too well .
but he was presenting a gift to a lady .
and she was standing there beaming .
looked like she wanted to cry .
you didn't know what he was saying .
but anyway, he said whatever he said .
and then he gave her the gift .
come to find out the gift +//.
that was his mother .
he was presenting her with a gift .
and he was thanking her for rearing him up .
and doing so many good things for him .
and then he moved aside .
and she went to thank him .
but she wanted to thank the person in the church that trained him .
and this the young lady that trained him is a professor at
she took him under her wing when he was about eight years old .
and worked with him .
then finally when he became a teenager, she said to his mother +"/.
+" I want to work with him with the usher board .
and the mother said, she told her +"/.
+" now Mrs Smith .
+" you know that he wouldn't be suitable .
+" he couldn't be an usher .
she said +"/.
+" if you just give me permission .
+" let me work with him .
and that was so many years ago .
now he's an adult in his thirties .
and he is an usher .
and he was just so proud .
she was just so proud you_know .
and she had to cry about this you_know .
but it was just a heartbreaking story you_know that she told .
and he told .
there were other people there .
an instructor from sign language that did sign language .
and he had some of his students that he had taught to do sign
and they put on a little show you_know with doing the sign language
which was very interesting .
he had all of us doing sign language for a few minutes .
and then they did an exercise program .
one of the professors from out to Bowie was there to do exercise
and they did that in sign language because the others you_know they
so everybody got a gift .
and it was a most interesting evening .
and then they served dinner to everybody .
so I think that was a beautiful thing .
