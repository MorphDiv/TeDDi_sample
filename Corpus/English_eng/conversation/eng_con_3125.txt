kind of problem . 310_830
it's not just you give me everything to start with . 1190_3380
and I give you what's at the end . 3400_4550
mhm . 4600_4950
and &-um and and then I'm adjusting the number types for each
everybody had different numbers . 9760_10990
so kids who are still having a hard time modeling that problem
have much lower numbers than kids who have handled that easily from
if that was their way of thinking about it . 30540_31940
their problem also required them to to borrow so I could see if
uhhuh . 39830_39930
&-um and then there's just one in here about about half . 40300_43920
mhm . 44100_44470
we keep coming up to those and then numbers of different sizes . 44600_47030
how do you act . 47080_47670
what does that actually mean . 47720_48700
you divide something in half . 48720_50470
&-um and that's as we work on fractions and stuff . 51020_54200
that's something that keeps coming up . 54280_55700
but at this point we yourself them don still have very haphazard
they know what it is . 60710_61500
but their strategies for finding that are still very varied . 61600_64349
you know . 64400_64670
&-um here's my sixty four if I'm printed to find half of sixty four
take this pile and count it . 71430_72660
you out . 73100_73220
it's twenty five . 73240_73940
then I check this one . 74510_75590
and once I get to twenty five I realize . 75640_77510
okay now this twenty five and this twenty five mesh . 77750_79810
but I have some leftover uhhuh . 79880_81270
<twenty six> twenty six <twenty seven> twenty seven <twenty
uhhuh . 84520_84710
or the person . 85120_85510
who even with a number into I think it was one hundred and sixty
but gives that long hundred seventy eight . 93900_95420
uhhuh . 95440_95540
uhhuh . 95720_95790
and then kept matching it and holding two parts to Sarah Sarah
and was ready to go over the deep end because because she
and I said . 110260_110620
no what think about it is 'cause she got one hundred now it was one
and I said . 117940_118310
okay well if the one hundred thirty four is half let's take let's
see what we get . 123560_124020
one one hundred is two hundred thirty thirty sixty four and
did she do that . 128220_128639
yes . 129539_129680
she did that through . 129759_130220
well I said . 130350_131070
what will that be . 131120_131850
and she was able to all that . 132100_133430
I said . 133600_133790
well a hundred sixty eight . 133840_135500
you have you found half of a hundred sixty eight . 135520_137510
you wanted half of a hundred seventy eight . 137670_139100
what are we gonna do . 139120_139640
alright . 140590_140900
let's see . 141080_141420
count of hundred that was ten different . 141600_143700
and I said . 144020_144500
oh well that five goes here and five goes there . 144520_146070
I go . 146200_146390
what does that mean . 146440_146740
she goes well really done a hundred thirty nine of seventy eight .
so that was the process . 151340_152060
she went a hundred and thirty nine is half of a hundred <seventy
sorry . 159860_159980
sorry two hundred seventy eight . 160360_161300
okay . 161510_161600
so she had seventy two hundred seventy eight . 162010_163540
she out . 163780_164080
I'm sorry . 164300_164510
that was hundred thirty four . 164560_165750
okay . 165990_166190
I I was off by one because we . 166400_167580
were doing the <one hundred> one hundred the thirty and thirty
other kids were using numbers in a hundreds . 174410_176380
hers was a number in the two hundred . 176400_177460
and some kids were using numbers like forty six to find out what
is to actually strategize how do you do that . 182320_184340
if you use the ten rods . 184360_185590
and then you have to end up breaking them up . 185640_187020
what do you do or if you do something like that other girl who's
feel I think that's about right . 194120_195500
but then she knew what to do to check . 195960_197830
first I was worried because help this wanna take twenty five . 197930_201630
&-um but she didn't as_soon_as she got twenty five in that other
then she knew exactly what she had to do . 207190_208670
who who was that . 208720_208920
Amanda was Amanda and she was that was her first day solving word
'cause I know this is not the kind of . 213320_214410
so Amanda yeah she . 214930_215750
and she was very unsure of how to even go about this . 216940_219510
so she sat right next_to me while she did this . 219700_221490
and I &-um looked for her . 222220_223620
but she was just don't even know what you want me to do . 223740_226940
and I'm like I want you to do whatever you think will help me solve
so &-um and what else is there . 231660_233020
I think there's one about the stitches . 233120_235470
now that's the muddy and the cleanness system . 236020_237630
but . 237980_238150
yeah . 239630_239700
I . 240200_240390
don't see it in there . 240320_241070
actually one that the one on stitches was that other . 241320_243540
it's in the patchwork coat one . 243710_244790
we haven't done that book yet . 245080_246020
that's always an interesting one too . 246380_247680
because what that . 248140_248660
&-um because it's about sewing the certain number of stitches on
and some kids recognize as that it's a square . 254090_256620
I just have to take four of those . 257360_258540
and some draw every stitch all the way around . 258899_260990
or make a model that looks like a square . 261170_262900
uhhuh . 263050_263150
that they they're actually using those ideas of what they found . 263400_265780
oh so there's a number space reflection . 265980_267980
mhm . 268040_268300
'cause that was our last addition . 269530_270700
the properties of a square is that they really do need to be equal
and that took several discussions before this class would go to add
they had reached consensus . 279790_280750
they agreed it belongs there . 280950_282180
but I think some of them are more shaky in their acceptance than
some of them will where . 286430_289210
are those consensus &-uh . 289280_291330
lists . 291770_291950
we had to use the whiteboard last week . 293500_295060
they're right there . 295080_295550
that chart is full . 295600_296390
that's our chart . 296440_296860
we can flip . 297060_297400
there that's your consensus . 297640_298590
chart . 298740_298910
in there . 298960_299220
yeah . 299390_299550
that's everything we've done from the beginning . 299600_301420
and that one's full . 301460_302410
I mean that we've done and recorded on chart paper . 303010_304620
it's all there . 304770_305080
we've tried not to tear anything off this year to hang it up or to
because then it gets left around or out_of order . 309920_312180
and this way we can just flip back during this unit as we start to
that's what we'll start coming back to . 319200_320500
you say you just created a triangle . 320950_322280
how do you know it's a triangle . 322460_323460
or you say you made a blue square with your shapes . 323700_326980
she says she made a blue rectangle . 327090_328420
what's the difference . 328460_329090
uhhuh . 329520_329700
so we'll come back to that . 330290_331230
we've been away from them for quite a while . 331290_333670
but now we'll come back and see if they're ready especially for
and then you're gonna start you say tomorrow with Poly and motions
mhm . 345940_346310
I think so because and that was interesting because even Brian by
he said . 353540_353950
oh well if you could imagine that these were the were colored on
mhm . 359140_359510
and I'm like . 360010_360440
well yes they are he goes well then you could just go this one over
so I mean he's already seen the need for that . 366400_369520
he's thinking that way but wasn't going I hope you're on your way
got brought to &-um . 375700_376870
so you're gonna have to make a core square tool again front and
mhm . 383240_383410
whatcha gonna do that . 383810_384500
a front and back one . 385680_386630
not today . 387860_388460
uhhuh . 388570_388870
&-um that comes after they've done it with poly drums . 389320_392180
they've made core squares with Poly Johnsons and this year I'm
we can do more than just the checkerboard or the half and half we
that's where they make their two-sided core squares . 409180_411580
they plan each two by two design and then record the motions that
why do you think the 'cause they're they're really two sided .
they're perfect . 426520_426920
I mean they don't have anything . 427200_427950
and they can do it so easily . 428280_429100
they can pick up that thing in and turn it and arrange them and
&-um and they're big enough that if we do something in . 433740_435820
the center they can all see it and understand it . 435840_437620
and I'm using a little horse for this big and trying to flip it and
they lose track <of what> of what I'm doing . 441950_444470
so the c and they're gonna work in are you . 444760_447830
yes we'll be to that point today . 448860_450990
I think we'll just do some vocabulary building . 451160_454180
talk about what a core is . 454400_455750
what that means . 455800_456300
we'll be coloring in some four square designs . 456580_458600
uhhuh . 459050_459110
I just have paper one sided and making our bullet cord . 459480_462190
<yeah yeah> yeah . 462530_463270
they won't be designing . 463440_464140
they though we might get to the part where we use our things . 464350_467420
just like the blue and green squares . 467770_469070
what are all the arrangements that come up to get that recorded . 469120_471990
but we won't be doing anything where they build a core . 472340_476420
and then copy that core and being two by two designs or done until
and we'll begin doing that with the poly drone . 480100_482300
so that when we lay them all out everybody can watch what they're
and they can talk about if they're turning or if they're flipping
nice . 490460_490550
&-um and then next week we're gonna begin we'll get to that their
and for each one they record the movements that they went through
and that's that's a full week's worth of work . 508540_510610
I mean it'll be a lot . 511090_511870
so then we'll see if that comes easier this year after what they
I mean someone's already asked them to look at something and use
make it look like this . 520659_521179
so that might even make sense to them . 522309_524750
I dunno . 526160_526490
that's where we're going . 526820_527590
cognize right in that conversation . 535120_540220
yes . 543770_543880
yes . 544630_544740
if we talk . 544850_545330
yeah . 545650_545780
well I was gonna that if they write in their journal I suppose . 546340_548890
yeah we would talk about that . 549220_550190
&-um but one of the neatest things that came outta &-um the video
and were able to so to to describe so accurately that last
yeah . 561110_561170
even_though they noticed it it took like four or five doings of
one core . 567230_567410
