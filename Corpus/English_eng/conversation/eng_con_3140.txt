well what I'm going to do I'm going to send a group of kids to each
I'm only going to give directions once though now so if you listen
but your groups first job when you know which spot to go to will be
okay . 434420_436006
so Brian will you be able to make the square you make look any way
yes . 439826_440556
no how will you have to make it look ? 440556_442093
exactly like the one in the group . 442093_444360
exactly like the core square that your group is using . 444360_446950
Brian if you're in this group here will your the square you build

no nope . 454875_455571
+< it'd have to be that one . 455571_457305
right okay so whichever space you're at your group is going to have
then we're then your group is going to be able to do things with
but our first job is going to be working together to make as many
okay there's enough pieces there to make several core squares like
many . 484876_486325

yes . 539965_540498
yes . 540498_540835
no . 540835_541435
why would it matter Justin if some people in the group make their
because they wouldn't be the same core squares and you would put
