do you think that Ellsworth agrees or disagrees with Rutledge ? 145_3365
S_one ?
disagrees . 4105_7765
disagrees ?
why ? 7925_8385
because he's saying he wanted to be an in-between but Rutledge, he still wants slavery to go on . 9565_18485
okay . 18805_28985
so we said that Rutledge is arguing that the South might leave if they abolish slavery, right ? 20225_28065
do you think Ellsworth feels the same ? 28525_30445
yes . 30865_31265
probably right . 31745_32385
S_two, what do you think ? 32505_33245
I think that Ellsworth is saying that it's not really our problem, it's the states' problem . 33285_39205
oh yeah, so it's not really our problem, the federal government, the state should be doing all that . 39325_44245
who agrees with S_two ? 44325_45225
raise your hand . 45605_46845
do you agree that that's what Ellsworth is saying ? 46845_48705
that it's not the federal government's problem ? 48825_50505
okay . 51865_52085
who did we learn about that might argue that same thing ? 52585_55325
who believed in really powerful states rather than a powerful central government ? 56145_61225
S_three ?
Thomas Jefferson . 61685_63765
Thomas Jefferson .
so we're back to him now . 64045_65345
he's believed the same thing . 65485_66745
it should be the states deciding the issue of slavery, according to Ellsworth . 66865_71965
how about Williamson ? 72225_73465
which side would Williamson go on ? 77255_79075
it is a problem or not a problem . 79235_80695
S_two ?
it's not a problem . 81775_90155
not a problem . 90235_91055
so we think he's here too . 91255_92435
can anyone point something out in his argument ? 92555_94935
S_four ?
it says Southern states cannot be xxx if the slave trade ended . 95775_101635
so what does that mean, S_four ? 101755_102755
it means that if you want the Southern states to stay, you have to keep slavery . 103105_108745
we want the Southern states to stay, we have to keep slavery . 108885_111765
so we're getting a lot of the same ideas, right ? 112185_114925
Rutledge and Ellsworth and Williamson are kind of corroborating each other . 115085_119125
they're all agreeing on the same idea that the issue is that the South might leave if the constitution tries to abolish slavery . 119245_127765
do you agree ? 128025_128485
mm-hmm . 129185_129465
okay . 129645_129785
what about Mr . 130915_132015
Franklin down here ? 132335_133155
what does he think ? 133295_134035
is it a problem or is it not a problem ? 134135_136715
should we look at his one more time ? 140175_145435
he says, I agree to this constitution with all its problems, because I think a federal national government is necessary for us . 146175_154995
when a large group of men gather together, you will certainly find that they will disagree with each other about their local interests and their selfish views . 155515_166215
we have to accept some of these disagreements in order to build a national government . 166795_171395
+" so what does Ben Franklin think ? 171935_173595
is slavery a problem or is it not a problem ? 173615_176875
S_five, what do you think ? 178115_179835
which side should we put him on ? 187495_188895
it is a problem or not a problem ? 189515_190775
it is ?
yeah . 191795_195795
I agree with you . 195995_196575
it is a problem . 196695_197195
raise your hand if you agree with S_five that he thinks it is a problem . 197315_199675
yeah . 200395_214955
so he says it is a problem, but then if you look a little bit further down, he says, when a large group of men gather together, you will certainly find that they will disagree with each other about their local interests and their selfish views . 202425_217525
what are those local interests ? 217705_219345
S_one ?
farming . 222265_224105
farming . 225045_225565
and who farms ? 225865_226545
slaves .
in what region of the United States ? 228745_230805
the South .
the South . 231225_231985
so I think he's calling the South out there right now that there's going to be people that disagree with the South because the South wants to keep slavery, but who might not want to keep slavery ? 232265_241665
the North . 242385_242925
the North .
okay .
so Ben Franklin saying it is the problem . 244445_247025
Ellsworth is kind of in the middle, but Rutledge and Williamson are saying it's not a problem . 247225_252045
so for those people that did think it was a problem, Franklin and maybe Ellsworth, why didn't they do anything about it ? 252945_262925
why didn't they fight harder to abolish slavery ? 263665_266245
I'm going to wait for some more hands up . 267725_271425
if they believe so strongly that it was a problem, or even if they thought a little bit that it was a problem, why didn't they do anything about it ? 273645_280225
S_six ?
maybe because they didn't have all the control . 283655_287715
what do you mean by that ? 288675_289555
power . 289935_291355
so those delegates didn't have enough power . 292015_294355
okay .
so maybe they couldn't sway the rest of the people there . 295455_298375
okay . 298995_299275
so S_seven, you had your hand up . 299655_301675
what were you going to say ? 301675_302455
because if they try and in the South +... 302855_305875
maybe if they try too hard and everybody knows the country would separate . 306735_310075
okay . 310675_311095
I think you guys are kind of agreeing here, right ? 311885_313925
S_six thinks that maybe they weren't powerful enough and maybe the reason they weren't that powerful is that there were people that really disagreed with abolishing slavery, and like you said, they might leave or try to end this union if they try to abolish slavery . 313985_327945
yeah . 328605_328765
who else has ideas ? 329025_329925
S_two .
okay . 330045_330765
so you agree with S_seven that if they abolish slavery, the South is going to leave . 336785_340865
okay . 341545_341625
so I'll take a poll real quick . 341845_344305
who agrees with that ? 344965_346125
that the reason that they didn't try to do anything to abolish slavery was that they were afraid that the South would leave the Union . 346305_352185
raise your hand . 353105_354025
do I need to repeat it ? 355545_356745
so raise your hand . 357005_358365
if you think that the reason that Ben Franklin and maybe Ellsworth and any other delegate there that did think slavery was a problem +... 358825_367225
did they not try to abolish slavery because they were afraid the South was going to leave . 368745_372565
raise your hand if you agree with that . 372685_374005
I know S_eight, you just came in, so it's okay if you don't want to raise your hand yet . 374765_378825
S_nine, do you agree ? 378885_379625
or do you think it was something different ? 380505_382025
I don't know . 382745_383245
okay . 384565_384765
so do you need me to repeat it ? 384885_385745
okay . 385905_386445
so do you think that the reason that the delegates that thought slavery was a problem, the reason they didn't do anything about it was because they were afraid the Southern states would leave . 386665_395265
yeah ? 396625_396645
okay . 397165_397705
what's the reason that the Southern states would try to leave in the first place ? 398345_403525
xxx .
what's the reason that the Southern states would leave, S_four ? 406905_414925
because they have to farm a lot and they need slaves to do the farming . 416485_419785
okay . 419805_419945
so slavery was something important to their economy . 420165_422925
okay . 423445_423465
so my question now is, is that okay ? 424065_430425
is it +... 431205_432265
well, hang on . 432365_433065
is it okay ? 433685_434765
that because they were afraid the South was going to leave, is it okay that they decided to do nothing about slavery ? 436075_445355
so I want to see what side everybody's on and I'm going to try my best because I want to see +... 446035_450755
I'm going to put your initials on the board . 451455_453475
so on this side, we've got +... 453875_454955
if you were them, if you were at seventeen-eighty-seven, we're back in that hot room and you're a delegate, are you going to fight to get rid of slavery, even if it means the South is going to leave, or are you going to give in and keep slavery because it means that the union will stay together ? 455385_473465
so raise your hand if you're on this side, get rid of slavery no matter what . 473925_477905
okay . 478485_478565
keep your hands up so I can +... 478705_480445
when I put your initial, you can put down . 482605_484565
no, I'm going to put xxx . 486265_486905
okay . 487185_488285
S_eight, S_three .
I know that's not your last name, I'm sorry I did that . 491845_498165
S_ten, S_eleven, S_seven, S_six, S_twelve, S_one, S_thirteen .
I got you up there, S_fourteen . 516645_517825
anybody else that I missed ? 517825_518905
okay . 519345_519545
so who's going to be on this side, then ? 519945_521605
keep the Southern states in the Union . 521965_524005
what ? 524105_524205
oh, you were, I didn't see it . 525065_526785
that's (be)cause you put your hand up so small . 526845_528425
and S_sixteen too . 529545_530185
and S_sixteen too ? 530345_531125
I think no one is xxx . 531905_533425
do we have anyone on this side ? 533565_535365
S_seventeen ?
you're going to be a brave soul ? 535725_537265
S_seventeen .
who else ? 537865_539805
S_two, what side were you on ? 540305_541605
I don't know which side to pick . 541925_543105
you don't know what side to pick ? 543385_545025
okay . 545125_545365
well, then we've got a really good solution to that because you guys are going to tell me why you picked that side and then S_two, you're going to be able to tell us where you are at the end of this discussion . 545965_555085
okay ?
so let's start with all of you guys . 555645_559165
why are you on this side ? 559685_563805
we're going to start with S_ten . 564505_566565
because it's unfair and you wouldn't like it if you were a slave and people think it was wrong but did nothing . 567125_573265
okay .
so you think that slavery, no matter what, is unfair and you're willing to risk the end of the United States to get rid of it ? 574185_581105
yeah ? 581725_581925
okay . 582225_582745
S_four .
I'm saying that if you don't like slavery, then why do you even care about the people who like slavery ? 582965_590785
okay . 591105_596965
so they should just ignore them because they're bad people because they like slavery . 591485_595885
yes .
so you don't care if they leave . 596445_597665
yeah .
okay . 598865_599085
S_one ?
because who wants this people, human beings working for them even though they're equal as you and plus, where would the Southern states go after that ? 599265_612765
well, they would create their own country so they would have their own country . 612885_617245
so let's talk about that for a second . 617665_619645
so everybody, but particularly S_ten, S_four, and S_one because you just made good arguments . 619945_624785
imagine that it's now . 625605_627305
and in seventeen-eighty-seven, they decided that they're all on your side . 627825_631245
they're going to get rid of it and the South leaves, so Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and a few other states . 631325_637725
they're their own country . 638085_639385
they're gone . 639885_640505
they're a separate union . 640745_641765
are you guys okay with that ? 641865_643025
yes . 643405_643925
you are ? 644125_644285
so you would be okay with that being a whole separate country ? 645265_648625
yeah .
S_nine, how about you ? 649645_650205
I was going to say that don't the Southern states make more food ? 650345_653925
they do make a lot of food . 654625_655865
so what is S_nine saying ? 656545_658385
what's the problem with the South leaving ? 658545_660185
then they won't have that much food . 660845_662725
okay . 662985_663165
so you think it would be difficult for the North to survive without the South ? 663345_666965
the North makes food but mostly, the South had lots of plants . 667265_671565
so who wants to comment on what S_nine just said ? 673505_676585
that there's going to be a problem with the South leaving or who still doesn't agree ? 676705_681505
S_ten ?
I think you have to do it yourself . 681945_685805
get your own food . 686065_686685
you don't need people to do it for you . 686785_688025
okay .
so they just need to become very independent, stop trading . 688565_691325
yeah . 691645_691865
okay . 692025_692305
if they take away slavery and the South +... 692445_695445
say they abolish slavery and the South leaves, and then the South doesn't have any slaves, so they have to do their own stuff . 699345_711205
the reason why we took away slavery is so the slaves can't do stuff, so yeah they could do it on the other +... 711805_718745
the North ? 721185_724565
yes, the North . 724805_725645
there you can do it on their own because that's the reason why they xxx . 726905_728945
so long story short, you agree with S_ten that the North should just learn to do it by themselves ? 729225_733465
yeah . 733545_733625
okay . 734065_734285
S_one .
can't more people move to the South and just have people leave ? 734565_740045
can people move there ? 740585_741505
yeah and the slaves can move there and they can work ? 741745_744645
well, the slaves are already there, or at least the slaves that were already living in the South . 744745_749065
yeah . 749725_749845
okay . 750325_750765
so lonely S_seventeen over here . 751185_753325
so you think that the Southern states should stay in the Union and you're willing to let slavery continue to keep that . 756345_763665
why ? 764265_764545
if they're both different countries, they might fight for the land . 764885_769705
okay . 769925_770245
so S_nine said they're not going to be able to survive without the South and now you're saying that they might fight ? 770725_776065
what do you got to say about that, left side ? 776585_779085
xxx .
fight for land, fight for resources +... 783975_786075
if the South won the war, xxx . 787155_790755
S_twelve .
but don't the Northern states have more weapons than the South ? 791135_802775
why would they have more weapons than the South ? 802935_806455
that's a really good point . 807215_809075
and you're right . 809255_809615
why might they have more ? 809695_810675
they've got more industry . 811555_812715
they've got more industry in the North . 813095_814655
he doesn't believe you . 814895_817595
he doesn't think that they're going to fight . 817695_818675
do you still agree with your point, S_seventeen ? 819235_821135
maybe the North is getting hungry and they want to attack the South +... 821135_826795
xxx .
so you think war is going to be inevitable . 826995_830595
if there's two separate countries, it's done . 830775_832855
we can't deal with it ? 833015_834015
does anyone want to disagree or agree with that ? 834015_837195
S_four ?
I disagree . 837495_838835
King George go to the Southern states when they're apart . 839475_842275
King George is gone already, it's seventeen-eighty-seven . 842475_844495
he's dead ? 844995_845635
no, but he's not +... 845895_846795
America is independent . 847095_848295
they won a war . 848475_849075
he could come back . 849175_850095
we spent like two months talking about it . 850155_851735
he can come back and go there . 851755_853215
oh, you think King George is going to come back to the South . 853675_855975
yeah, and then rule that . 855975_856895
well, we've talked about how there was a lot of people that were supportive of England in the South, so that could happen . 857035_864115
so we're running out of time and I wish we could have more time to talk about this . 864665_869425
would anyone switch their opinion based on your discussion here ? 869545_873145
S_nine, you're changing ? 873485_876065
no, I was in the middle . 876285_877285
well, you can't be in the middle, you've got to pick a side . 877565_880165
okay . 881025_881165
anybody want to change their opinion ? 883325_885585
oh yes, S_two, where are you ? 886205_887745
who convinced you ? 888025_888965
to keep slaves . 893825_895065
you're going to keep slaves . 895325_896325
all right . 896885_897265
you got a convert . 897645_898405
