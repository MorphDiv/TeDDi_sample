<um> a(n) elephant is dribbling a ball near water I think .
the ball falls in the water .
<the> the giraffe goes to get it .
and the giraffe gives it back to the elephant .
and now the elephant is happy .
<um> they see the pool again .
and there (i)s a sign that says no running .
and they see a diving board .
and they wanna go to the diving board .
but they start to run .
and the elephant slips and hurts her <uh> knee .
and then a lifeguard comes (..) and puts a bandaid on it .
and then it (i)s fine .
and then the lifeguard points to a no running sign .
<um> they (a)re back at the pool .
and the giraffe has a plane .
and the elephant grabs it from the giraffe's hand .
and it falls in the water .
and it (i)s sinking .
now the lifeguard sees it .
and the elephant is <um> asking what he can do about it .
the lifeguard tries to reach it .
but he can n(o)t .
so a lady got a net (..) and gets it out .
and then the giraffe is happy again .
and now I guess he is playing with it again .
two rabbits are making a sandcastle .
<um> (..) I guess they (a)re just making it better .
<um> one rabbit dumps the sand on the sandcastle .
and it wrecks it .
and the other rabbit (i)s sad .
that (i)s it .
the two rabbits are going for a picnic .
<um> (..) I guess one has lots .
and the other one has hardly any .
<the> the bunny gets fat .
he gets dizzy .
<um> he calls for help .
<um> (..) the rabbit is pulling her <um> (..) because maybe
(...) <um> she (i)s making him <feel> feeling better .
I do n(o)t know .
<um> and he walks away when she (i)s better again .
<um> the rabbits are back again .
and one (i)s pulling a wagon with a balloon on it .
<um> the other rabbit notices <that> the balloon I
<um> the other rabbit (i)s trying to pull it off .
and it goes up into the air .
and now the other rabbit is mad .
and then they see a different rabbit that (i)s selling balloons
so the rabbit goes up and buys one .
and they (a)re five cents .
but he does n(o)t have any five cents .
<um uh> (...) so I guess he (i)s mad or something .
then he goes to a lady (..) to ask <if> if she has five cents .
and she does .
so they both get a balloon
