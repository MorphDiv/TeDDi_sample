&~www .
I found a frog .
and I put it &-um in a glass container .
uhhuh that's cool .
&-um I hadta go to sleep quite early that night , as I hadta get up
when I woke up &-um I found that my frog had disappeared got
I looked everywhere everywhere .
and my dog even helped me .
&-um my dog put his head in the container and got it stuck .
I went to the window and started making noises out the window to
the dog jumped out the window and broke the glass container that
I jumped out after him .
I was quite angry .
we went down to the bottom of the field by my garden and started
but I still couldn't find him .
we looked in a badger's hole .
and &-um my dog looked up a tree where there was a wasps' hive .
he knocked it down .
but I didn't see him do this .
I just saw the &-um bees after him .
and I climbed the tree .
the bees &-um chased my dog .
&-um I went over by a rock .
and there was an owl that tried to attack me .
I climbed up and started calling out for him .
but there was a deer .
and he scooped me on to his &-um .
&~www .
antlers .
anklers and ran off with me on him .
he came to &-um the edge of the cliff .
and he threw me off .
and I fell off him and landed in &-um <some water> a pond .
and I thought that the &-um frog might be here .
I heard something .
and I crept over to the log .
and I peered over it .
and I saw my frog with his girlfriend and his little baby frogs .
&~www .
that's all right you're doing fine .
and &-um <I took> I took him home and said +"/.
+" thank you .
