<they're all the same size> . 59052_61218
they are just different shapes . 61218_62835
how can they be all the same size ? 62694_64532
who agrees with Nicole that B and C are the same size . 64532_72188
and they can help us think some more about how could we
if you can use C and cover up all of B they're the same size . 80571_84208
right . 84208_84838
okay Ashley's idea was to fold this one . 85084_89619
into what Ashley ? 89619_91906
yeah . 91906_103163
it's not the same . 103163_104852
you need two of (th)em . 104852_106082
actually it is . 106082_107705
it is ? 107705_109047
see well Justin said you need two of them . 109047_112038
that is two of them . 113610_116348
we have two of them . 116348_148528
the other one is right here . 148406_150340
so let's see +... 150340_151554
Ashley and I draw +... 151725_152935
yeah you hold your finger right at the bottom of it and I'll move
and I'll hold my thumb nail here . 157804_159306
okay . 159306_164873
they're the same size . 164873_166361
so what does that mean ? 166361_168163
then it will be the same size as this . 168163_172434
but we already folded it in half and it doesn't look like xxx . 172660_174975
the other way . 174975_175510
again . 175510_176022
oh: yes you're doing it my way . 176022_179552
so Sarah were you thinking like Jenna ? 179552_181775
alright talk to me about this wait let Jenna . 181812_199780
what am I going to do with this Jenna ? 199780_201908
that clip's kind of in the way . 201908_209707
do the best you can . 209707_210514
what did we find out ? 210514_230986
almost right to the end . 230986_233160
so +... 233160_235168
it's the same size . 235168_236726
they don't look the same size to me . 236726_240119
it's only the same size (be)cause you folded this one in half and
but they are the same size . 244237_247472
it would seem to me that she knows that B is the same size as
because because because C because C is the same
B is the same size as C . 280376_282173
C is the same size as A, so since B is the same size as C
B should be the same size as A too . 290591_292877
Sarah says that we found out that C was the same size as B . 292877_298156
do you remember that ? 298156_299445
yeah . 299461_300332
when we folded C in half like this and Ashley layed half here and
and she's saying so that means that C is the same size as B . 305309_308531
B is the same size as C . 308531_309972
and then she said then we found out that C was the same size as
that's what Jenna and Alex helped me to show . 315822_319355
so she is saying if you know that B and C are the same and you
xxx . 327123_329088
I want to know if we know that without testing . 329088_333313
I do . 333313_333935
and A and B are equal . 333935_345749
tell me about xxx . 345749_346816
if C and B are equal, and C and A are equal, it has to be
are they the same length ? 358967_361510
no . 361510_362134
okay . 369371_370648
so if B and C have the same amount of cloth and A and C
yeah . 375992_377864
if we divided C into four equal parts . 377864_408308
we could lays those +... 408308_410858
if I fold them like this, you can see that they're equal . 410858_418490
fold it this three um strips . 419837_439672
the long ways . 439672_440688
so I need to divide this into three long strips . 441110_444288
can they be a ny size ? 444288_445602
no . 445862_446327
they have to be the same size . 446327_448025
alright . 448205_449412
yes it will work . 449412_455926
it'll take three . 455926_456947
but, it'll take three and a half . 457180_458914
maybe we need to maybe, I'll put my finger where this one
now how could that be . 469390_470393
like Stephanie said it took Micheal four strips to cover xxx . 470393_476186
xxx . 476186_478795
do that again . 478795_497522
one two three four five six . 497146_498983

are they all the same size ? 509320_523079
yeah . 523079_523606
Ben says that twelve of (th)em would fit in a strip . 523606_531253
six, six in each row . 531253_533507
like on here . 533507_535995
and six would fit in here . 535995_537564
okay . 537564_538242
well then if you are so smart . 538242_540299
how many core squares could I fit into shape B ? 540299_543453
twelve ? 543453_545924
yes . 545924_547445
how many core squares would fit here ? 547445_550325
two . 550325_551228
and how many would fit this way ? 551228_553046
six . 553046_555635
twelve . 555635_556788
how did you know that so quickly ? 556788_557873
because you can make B into A and there's and in the
C has twelve squares and you and then and that's the same and you
three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve . 575930_613847
