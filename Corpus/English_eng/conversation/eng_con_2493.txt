good morning . 2870_3340
Mr John brought me on the way out and asked me about why Gray was
and that &-uh <it wasn't> it wasn't &-uh it was instructing so
and that was the extent of it . 33630_34510
then Greg himself is the one who reached the conclusion that no
he turned over enough . 39200_40190
&-uh so this is again Pat Gray making decisions on his own as_to
he has been totally unwilling all along to take any guidance . 47500_50020
any instruction . 50260_51140
we don't know what he is going to do . 51160_52110
he is not gonna talk about it . 52220_53350
he won't review it to . 53400_54590
and I don't think he does it to harm you in any way . 57180_59080
sir . 59210_59320
he's just quite stubborn . 59560_60470
and he's quite stubborn . 62190_63150
and also he's very smart . 63270_65040
he's headed he's smart his own way . 66600_68190
he's got that it that's why he thinks he'll be confirmed because he
he's being forthright honest . 78600_80150
he feels he's turned over too much . 80870_82550
and so it's a conscious decision that he is harming the bureau by
and so he's not going to because the White and also I don't see why
Sam Irvin has made that point himself &-uh in fact in reading the
&-uh thought it was very unwise . 124710_125720
I . 126130_126140
don't think that anyone is criticizing your position's . 126400_129639
make the point . 129729_129960
let's make point all files cannot well I need that point . 130490_136480
we're saying rights of an individual . 137870_139430
the Americans against against traditional all are get a chance
yeah . 164450_164520
well he's going to be over to see me today this morning . 164810_167040
hopefully sometime &-um you get that I'll be available . 167140_171090
alright . 171720_171880
everything he has . 179080_179830
so he got something . 180150_180770
but I'd like to just see what it's . 180840_182110
&-uh the reason I thought we ought_to talk this morning is because
and it makes it very difficult for you to make judgements that &-uh
and I thought that you got in other words I've gotta know why you
well let me that we should unravel something . 206890_208710
lemme give you my overall first your your judgment where it
<I think> I think that &-uh there's no doubt about the
work . 219600_219710
we've got we have a cancer within close to the presidency that's
it is growing daily . 226920_227850
it's compounded . 228430_229250
it grows geometrically now because it compounds itself . 229270_232600
&-uh that'll be clear as I explained . 233980_236410
you know some of the details &-uh of why it is . 236670_240260
and basically it's because one we're being blackmailed . 240330_243380
two &-uh people are going to start perjury themselves very quickly
two protect other people . 251310_252650
and like and that is just . 252830_254250
and there's no assurance that bus that that won't bust . 254700_258339
so let me give you the sort of basic facts talking first about the
and then . 263280_263450
about Segretti and about some of the peripheral items that &-uh
where did it start . 272110_272890
it . 273910_274010
started with instruction to me from Bob Holman to see if we
mhm . 286730_286950
not being in this business . 288730_289610
I turned to somebody who had done this business . 289810_292190
Jack Caulfield who was . 292830_293980
I don't know if you remember Jack or not . 294070_295340
he was your original bodyguard before they had candidate
an old New York City policeman . 298790_300530
right . 300550_300820
&-uh Jack had worked for John and was transferred to my office . 302320_305220
and I said . 305850_306290
Jack come up with a plan that you know the normal infiltration . 306480_309370
and you know buying information from secretaries and all that sort
he did he put together a plan just kicked around . 313550_316810
and &-uh I went to Ehrlichman with it and went to Mitchell with it
and the consensus was that Caulfield wasn't the man to do this . 320770_323770
&-uh in retrospect . 325290_326170
that might have been a bad call (be)cause he is an incredibly
today . 334430_334660
right after rejecting that I said . 335590_337850
we still need something . 337870_338890
so I was told to look around for somebody that could go over to
and that's when I came up with Gordon Liddy who they needed a
I was aware of the fact that he had done some extremely sensitive
doctor's office and things like this . 363670_365340
he'd worked with Lee he you know tracked these things down . 366400_369180
&-uh and so the report that I got from Crow Club but he was a hell
so we talked to Liddy Liddy was interested in doing it . 381910_384290
took &-uh Liddy over to meet Mitchell Mitchell saw highly of
then Liddy was told to put together his plan . 401430_403580
you know how he would run an intelligence operation . 403950_406180
and this was after he was hired over there at the &-uh the
I'd like to have you come over and see Liddy plan June January of
like you come over to Mitchell's office and sit in on me where
I said . 425880_426070
well I don't really know if I'm the man but if you want me there
so I came over . 430560_431060
and Liddy laid out a million dollar plan . 432110_434430
that was the most incredible thing I have ever laid my eyes on all
kidnapping providing prostitutes . 442410_444740
&-uh that weakened the opposition bugging &-uh mugging teams . 445360_450120
it was just an incredible thing . 450930_452420
and <no no> no . 453740_457230
and and Mitchell Mitchell just virtually sat there puffing
and I could tell (be)cause after he after Liddy left the office I
that's the most incredible thing I've ever seen . 464600_465900
he said . 465920_466150
I agree . 466240_466550
and so they was told to go back to the . 468390_469550
drawing boards and come up with something realistic . 469600_471190
so there was a second meeting . 472040_472950
&-uh and they asked me to come over that I came into the tail end
I wasn't there for the first part of . 477190_478460
I don't know how long the meeting lasted . 478480_479790
&-uh at this point they were discussing again bugging kidnapping
and at this point I said right in front of everybody . 486250_489020
very clearly . 489550_490140
I said . 490520_490820
these are not the sort of things one that are ever to be discussed
and I'm personally in sense I'm trying to get Mitchell off the hook
&-uh because <he's a> he's a nice person . 501070_502790
doesn't like to say no under when people he is not to work with . 502840_505700
that's right . 505740_506140
so <I let> I let it be known . 506660_508540
and I said . 508560_508870
you_all pack that stuff up and get the hell out_of here because we
and you shouldn't you should reexamine your whole thinking came
it was <Mcgruder Mcgruder> Mcgruder &-uh Mitchell Liddy and
Bob we got a growing disaster on our hands if they're thinking this
and I said . 532250_532510
the White House has gotta stay out_of this . 532560_534060
and I frankly am not gonna be involved in it . 534210_536120
he said . 536880_537070
I agree John and I thought at that point the thing was turned off
okay . 549190_549310
Libby I did have dealings with him afterwards . 551320_553310
we never talked about it now that would . 553470_555190
be hard to believe for some people . 555250_556430
but &-uh we never did just the fact of the matter . 556590_558830
well you were talking about other things other . 559150_560430
we had so many other things . 560470_561260
we had some legal now . 561430_563240
but you were advisor . 563790_564760
I understand campaign go ahead now . 565490_573130
so Liddy went back after that and was over over to seventeen oh
and I this is where I come into having put the pieces together
Liddy sat over there and tried to come up with another plan that he
they were talking saying he was asking for too much money . 594770_596830
and I don't think they were discounting the illegal points at this
and he didn't know whether this was the way the game was played or
and what it was all about . 605830_606590
they came up with apparently another plan . 607940_609380
&-uh but they couldn't get it approved by anybody over there . 610680_613910
so Liddy and Hunt apparently came to see Chuck Olsson and Chuck
you_all either fish or cut bait . 622280_625220
&-uh this is absurd to have these guys over there and not using
and if you're not gonna use (th)em I may use them things of this
I can only assume because_of his close relationship with Hunt he
a damn good idea . 650770_651510
he would probably deny deny it today and probably get away with
but I &-uh I still and . 655080_657320
that's hunt &-uh blows on it . 657340_659200
but that is not case too good probably probably . 659590_664240
but Liddy was there also . 664260_665290
and if if Liddy were to blow okay I'll go back over that the
<I think he> I think he helped to get the push get the thing
now something else occurred though . 685700_686840
have you talked to anybody . 688050_688800
no I think this is an independent . 689600_690760
no I don't think so now . 691470_692430
but here's the other thing where the next thing comes in the chain
I think that Bob was assuming that they had something that was
some intelligence gathering operation that Liddy was operating . 700760_703400
and through Strong &-uh who was his tickler . 704080_707190
&-uh he started pushing them to get something to get some
and they took that as a signal . 712300_713420
Magrid took that as a signal to probably go to Mitchell and say
go ahead and never really reflected on what it was all about . 724460_727660
so they had some plan that obviously had I gathered different
they were gonna go after they were gonna infiltrate and bug and do
a_lot_of these targets knowledge I have after the fact . 738840_741780
and apparently <they they> they had they had after they had
the information was coming over here . 755960_757540
too strong . 757780_758350
some of it was given to Holden &-uh there's no doubt about it . 759000_762300
&-uh do you know what it was . 763240_764550
I don't really know if he would've not necessarily that's not
Str knew strong no doubt about it and whether strong . 773620_776380
I've never wanted to press these people on these points because it
so I had to piece things together . 783180_784180
alright . 785090_785290
so Str was aware of receiving information reporting to Bob at one
they'd done preliminary . 807420_808570
they no they hadn't . 808690_811120
but they had to stay . 811140_811920
&-uh they had infiltrated it by a they had a secretary and a
so the information was coming over here . 821400_822780
and then &-uh I finally after the next point in time where I became
oh my god that I can only you know initially putting the pieces
I knew what it was . 846750_847190
so I called Liddy &-uh on that Monday morning I said . 848560_852100
Gordon I said . 852120_852700
first I wanna know if anybody in the White House was involved in
he said . 855180_855500
no they weren't I said . 855560_856780
well I wanna know how in god's name this happened . 857980_860190
and he said . 861220_861430
well I was pushed without mercy by Magruder to get in there get
Magruder said the White House was not happy with what we're getting
White House no . 873240_873750
&-uh well I think it was probably strong thinking that Bob wanted
and because I've seen that happen on other occasions where things
I'm just trying to think as_to why . 892020_893500
then we just finished the trip . 893520_895190
I mean we were that's right Democrats I mean for Christ's sake . 895600_901140
what the hell . 901470_902220
I see I the pressure . 903440_905620
but I don't see why all the pressure . 907870_908980
I don't know other_than the fact that &-uh they might have been
&-um so &-uh Liddy told me that &-uh you know this is what had
and and this is why it happened was from beg pardon from a
yeah Magruder is totally knowledge on the whole thing . 942940_945230
yeah . 945980_946150
alright . 947260_947470
now we've gone through the trial . 947900_949470
we I don't know if Mitchell has perjured himself in the grand jury
I've never Mitchell I don't know how much knowledge he actually had
I know that Magruder has perjured himself in the grand jury . 957230_959900
I know that Porter has perjured himself . 960650_961900
&-uh in the grand jury Porter he's one of Mag's deputies . 963190_967530
&-uh that they set up this scenario which they ran by me . 968660_971360
they said . 971710_971920
how_about this . 971960_972400
I said . 972580_972700
look I don't know . 972820_973610
I you know if this is what you're gonna hang on . 973820_975920
fine . 976090_976330
&-uh but what did they say . 977330_979480
court grand jury . 979510_980080
<they said that> they said that as they said before the trial
and we knew he had these capacities to . 988840_990850
you know to do legitimate intelligence . 991180_992680
we had no idea what he was doing . 992770_994280
he was given an authorization of two hundred fifty thousand dollars
they had no protection . 1002300_1003210
we had information that there were gonna be demonstrations against
that . 1006670_1006850
&-uh &-uh we had to have a plan to get information as_to what
and Lydia was charged with doing this . 1013150_1014520
we had no knowledge that he was gonna bug the d n c &-uh point is
that's right . 1019780_1020410
Magrid did know Magrid specifically instructed him to go back in
yes you know . 1026920_1027839
okay . 1029700_1029940
&-um I honestly believe that no one overhear knew that I know &-uh
I had no knowledge that they were gonna do this . 1042240_1043670
&-uh but they don't Bob he Bob I don't believe specifically knew
I don't think he did . 1053150_1053780
I think he knew there was a capacity to do this . 1054420_1056060
but he wasn't wasn't giving it specific direction . 1056100_1058140
thanks . 1059180_1059420
Strong did know know . 1059710_1060350
alright . 1065830_1066060
so &-uh those people are in trouble as a result of the grand jury
Mitchell of_course has never called during the trial . 1072520_1074060
now Rachel was a sworn state . 1075900_1078580
yes sir to the jury to the grand jury . 1079440_1083060
did he go for it . 1083850_1084380
he had we had an arrangement whereby he went down to with several
we made an arrangement where they could quietly go into the
testimony and then read it before the grand jury . 1099200_1100740
although I that's right . 1103320_1104300
Mitchell was actually called before the grand jury . 1104920_1106700
the grand jury would not settle for less . 1106720_1108310
the jurors wanted him . 1108660_1109780
<and he went> and he went . 1110300_1111180
&-uh I don't know what he said . 1113150_1115350
so I've never seen a transcript of the grand jury . 1115970_1117640
now what what has happened post June seventeenth . 1119430_1124590
well it was I was under pretty clear instructions not really to
but this is something that just could have been disastrous on the
if it have all hella broken loose . 1133600_1135420
and I worked on a period of containment . 1135500_1137860
sure to try to hold it right where it was right . 1138410_1140840
there's no doubt . 1141410_1141780
I I &-uh that &-uh I was totally aware what the bureau was
I was totally aware what the grand jury was doing . 1147150_1148980
I knew what witnesses were gonna be called . 1149680_1151140
I knew what they were gonna be asked . 1151280_1152390
and I had to it was just why did Peterson play play the games
(be)cause Peterson's a soldier . 1157760_1158480
he played he kept me informed . 1159250_1160330
he told me when we had problems where we had problems . 1160540_1162700
and the like &-uh he believes <in in> in you . 1162720_1166860
he believes in this administration . 1166980_1168260
this administration has made him . 1168370_1169590
&-uh I don't think he's done anything improper . 1170670_1172510
but he did make sure the investigation was narrowed down to the
there's no doubt about it . 1181320_1181980
he honest he was he did medical job . 1182100_1184190
he they ran that investigation out to the fullest extent . 1184900_1188540
they could follow a lead . 1188560_1189710
and and that was it . 1190340_1192490
but why I suppose why he call all . 1192620_1197010
why didn't he get the statement Colson Or . 1199220_1201360
they didn't get col that's right . 1201600_1202940
but the thing is based on their F B I interviews . 1202960_1205300
there was no reason to follow up . 1205320_1206580
there were no leads there . 1206670_1207420
Colson said . 1207580_1208100
I have no knowledge of this to the F B I &-uh Str said . 1208160_1212450
I have no knowledge of you know they didn't ask Str any Watergate
they asked him about Segretti &-uh just said . 1215640_1219140
what's your connection with Lidian he just said . 1219160_1220900
well you know I just met him over there . 1220920_1222820
and they never really pressed him . 1222840_1223980
they didn't you know they looked Sean appeared &-uh as a result of
post June seventeenth . 1235980_1237310
these guys immediately very very interesting Liddy for example
another member of my staff on campaign compliance problems . 1253560_1256500
&-uh joking after the incident he went he ran &-uh cls down at
which was kind of a that you get the hell out_of here . 1267970_1270660
kid . 1270740_1270910
&-uh whatever you gotta say . 1271060_1272860
just say to somebody else . 1272880_1273900
don't bother me . 1274130_1274780
and but this has never come up . 1274820_1276940
&-uh Liddy said said that you know that they all got counsel
alright . 1287370_1287540
then they started making demands . 1287760_1289040
and we gotta have attorney's fees . 1289920_1291070
&-uh we don't have any money ourselves . 1292020_1293540
and this you're asking us to take this through the election . 1293580_1296510
alright . 1297040_1297200
so arrangements were made through Mitchell &-uh initiating it and
I was present that these guys had to be taken care of their
had to be done . 1307220_1308350
Kaba was brought in . 1309310_1310150
&-uh Kabat raised some cash . 1311050_1312670
&-uh they were you know they put that under the cover committee . 1313730_1317870
yeah they they had a Cuban committee . 1318720_1320150
and they had some of it was given to Hunt's lawyer who in turn
I could certainly keep that that covered whatever it's worth .
oh after well that that's that's the most troublesome post
&-uh because one Bob is involved in that John is involved in that
Mitchell is involved in that . 1358600_1359470
and that's an obstruction of justice in other words the fact that
&-uh I was involved . 1369140_1370910
well they ran out_of money over that . 1372070_1373820
Bob had three hundred fifty thousand dollars in a safe over here
&-uh and there was no other source of money . 1381780_1384560
so they came over here and said . 1384680_1386120
you_all gotta give us some money . 1386140_1387360
I had to go to Bob and say . 1388170_1389360
Bob you know you gotta have some I need some money over there . 1389400_1392960
he said . 1393640_1394000
what for . 1394020_1394360
and so I had to tell him what it was for . 1394460_1395800
(be)cause he wasn't about to just send money over there Willy-nilly
and we decided you know that you know there was no price too high
in front of the election I think we <I think> I think we can .
that's right . 1413980_1414190
I think we can too . 1414480_1415370
but now here's here's what's happening right now . 1416700_1418990
what sort of brings matters to the . 1420000_1421790
this is one . 1422500_1423020
this is gonna be a continual blackmail operation by Hunt and Liddy
and Mccord who who was another one involved Mccord had asked
&-uh Mccord did ask to meet with somebody . 1435250_1437510
and it was Jack Cofield who was his old friend who gotten him hired
and when when Cofield had hired he was a perfectly legitimate
and he wanted to know . 1447670_1448800
well you know we can't wanna talk about commutation and things like
and as you know Colson has talked to indirectly to hunt about
all these things are bad . 1459050_1459880
<and and> and that their problems their promises their
I don't think they can find frankly <pretty hard> pretty hard
it's all cash . 1470570_1471200
&-uh well pretty hard . 1471560_1473640
explain that's right now . 1473690_1476520
the blackmail is continuing . 1478150_1479260
Hunt called one of the lawyers from the reelection committee on
the guy came in to me to see me to get a message directly from Hunt
pardon . 1493150_1493300
someone on bail . 1493320_1494140
Hunt is on bail . 1494750_1495500
correct . 1495870_1496020
&-uh Hunt now is demanding another seventy two thousand dollars for
another fifty thousand dollars to pay his attorney's fees . 1502400_1504550
a hundred twenty some thousand dollars . 1504840_1506220
once wanted it by the close of business yesterday because he says .
I'm gonna be sentenced on Friday and I've . 1509860_1511470
gotta be able to get my financial affairs in order . 1511560_1513260
I told this fellow O'brien I think you came to the wrong man until
&-uh don't know a thing about it . 1518410_1519760
can't help you said . 1519840_1520630
you better scramble around elsewhere . 1521080_1522300
now <O'brien is> O'brien is is a ball player . 1523270_1526230
he's been he carried tremendous water for us . 1526710_1529390
&-uh he's a lawyer . 1529810_1530990
no <he is> he is our lawyer at the reelection Committee I see .
so he is safe . 1535670_1536060
there's no problem there . 1536300_1537030
but it raises the whole question of Hunt now has made a direct
this is his blackmail . 1543150_1544230
he says . 1544500_1544690
I will bring John Erlichman down to his knees and put him in jail .
&-uh I have done enoughs things for he and Crow &-uh but they'll
Berg Ellberg and apparently some other things . 1556460_1558350
I don't know the full extent of it . 1558580_1559980
&-uh what anything else . 1560750_1563350
I don't either . 1563890_1564240
and I hate to learn some of these things . 1564290_1566650
so that's that's that situation . 1568010_1569400
now . 1569450_1569510
where are the soft points .
how many people know about this . 1571510_1572840
well &-uh well let me go one step further in this this whole
the Cubans that were used in the Watergate were also the same
so they're they're aware of that . 1589200_1590190
how high their knowledge is . 1591000_1592070
there's something else . 1592290_1592910
Lydia course you're totally aware <of of> of it . 1593410_1595990
and the fact that &-uh it was right out_of the White House I dunno
what I don't either . 1599890_1602070
Mr President there've been a couple things around here that I've
&-uh there was a one time a desire to do . 1607120_1609550
a second story job in the Brookings Institute where they had
I flew California because I was told that John had instructed it .
and he said . 1618800_1619670
I really hadn't a misimpression but for Christ's sake turn it off .
and I did I came back and turned it off because you know the when
<and the> and the cane is fantastic . 1629100_1630590
it's something else but with a low risk and &-uh no gain . 1630920_1633620
&-uh hey it's just &-uh it's not worth it . 1633780_1636520
but who knows about this . 1637600_1638310
all now right . 1638840_1639450
you've got the Cuban's lawyers a man by the name of Brock Blatt who
he's had to be turned down and tuned off . 1650400_1652260
he was canned by his own people . 1652380_1654180
(be)cause they didn't trust him . 1654360_1655020
they were trying to run a different route . 1655040_1656300
and he wanted to run . 1656540_1657590
he didn't want him to plead guilty . 1658450_1659460
he wants to represent him before the senate . 1659540_1661220
so F Lee Bailey who was the partner of <one of the> one of the
so F Lee Bailey has got knowledge . 1671570_1673020
&-uh Hunt's lawyer a member the name of Pitton who's an excellent
&-um do <you think> you think he's got some well not only <all
they have . 1694310_1694710
&-um you've got the two lawyers over at the reelection committee
slowly they got the whole picture . 1702670_1703900
they're they're solid but they're but they know but . 1704280_1706740
they know &-uh you've got then an awful lot of all the principles
no . 1714060_1714230
&-uh some people's wives . 1715980_1717410
no . 1717700_1717860
sure . 1718810_1718940
&-uh there's no doubt about that . 1719220_1720380
Mrs Hunt was the savviest woman in the world . 1720700_1723260
she had the whole picture together . 1723340_1724670
did she . 1725300_1725540
yeah it's &-uh apparently she was the pillar of strength in that
and &-uh greatest sadness . 1729500_1730550
the basis of matter that would be there was a discussion on
that's the only discussion I ever had that . 1743530_1745220
right . 1745700_1745940
&-um so that's that's it . 1748120_1749930
that's the the extent of the knowledge . 1750150_1751910
now where where are the soft spots on this . 1752020_1754310
well first of all there's a there's the problem of the continued
and it will compound the obstruction of justice situation . 1764670_1767510
it'll cost money . 1768420_1769090
it's dangerous . 1769330_1769890
nobody . 1770010_1770690
people around here are not pros at this sort of thing . 1770900_1772850
this sort of thing . 1772870_1773340
mafiaa people can do washing money getting clean money and things
&-uh we just don't know about those things . 1778740_1781150
we're not used you know we're not criminals . 1781510_1782860
we're not used to dealing in that business . 1782880_1784220
<it's a it's a> it's a tough thing to know how to do . 1784310_1787020
that's right . 1788260_1788650
it's a real problem as_to whether we could even do it . 1788900_1790550
plus there's a real problem in raising money . 1790910_1792420
&-uh Mitchell has been working on raising some money . 1793070_1794780
&-uh feeling that he's got you know he's got one he's one of the
&-uh but there's no benign the fact that the White House and &-uh
money decisions . 1806980_1808260
I would say . 1810890_1811220
these people are gonna cost &-uh a million dollars over the next
mhm . 1822960_1823130
you on the money if you need the money . 1824150_1826130
I mean &-uh you can get the money . 1827180_1828910
well I think that's where you you could get dollars . 1829890_1832940
you could get . 1833520_1833970
I know where you got . 1835670_1836610
mhm . 1836800_1837170
again it's not easy but it could be done but the question is that's
&-uh idea . 1844420_1845440
well I would think that would be something that Mitchell ought_to
I think so too . 1850110_1850640
and <get some> get some pros to help him . 1851120_1853440
let me say there shouldn't be a_lot_of people running around . 1855070_1857200
well he's got one person doing it who I'm not sure is he's got Fred
now Fred started out going out trying to solicit money from all
and I've learned about that . 1868920_1869640
and I said . 1869680_1870000
my god it's just awful . 1870310_1871500
don't do it . 1871710_1872150
&-uh people are gonna ask what the money's for . 1873280_1875040
he's working . 1877300_1877640
he's apparently talked to Tom Paps I know . 1877690_1880370
and Paps has &-uh agreed to come up with amount I can gather from
that's right . 1893850_1894160
if you want to put that through would you put that through a
the Cuban construction of justice . 1914130_1915970
well they've got a they got a precinct . 1917570_1919620
would you like to put I mean <would that> would that give a
yeah . 1926900_1926960
&-uh then you've got Liddy and Mccord is not not accepting any
so he's he's not a bought land right now . 1932490_1934620
okay . 1939200_1939370
alright . 1940410_1940510
let let me &-uh go ahead . 1940650_1941720
continue a little bit here . 1942290_1942840
now the &-uh I when I say this is a a growing cancer . 1942890_1949600
&-uh I say it for reasons like this . 1951080_1952630
Buddy Crow in his testimony before the grand jury before of perjury
&-uh Bud said . 1962770_1963390
I haven't had a pleasant day on a job . 1963450_1964800
huh . 1965350_1965520
he said . 1966580_1966670
I have not had a pleasant day on my job . 1966730_1968680
&-uh he talked to said . 1969890_1971000
do these days . 1971050_1971560
I told my wife all about this . 1971730_1972760
the the curtain may ring down one of these days . 1973270_1975350
and &-uh I may have to face the music which I'm perfectly willing
&-uh what'd he purchase himself on . 1981510_1983920
then his did did he know the Cubans he did &-uh he said he did
that's right . 1995580_1996340
they didn't press him hard . 1997530_1998500
he might be able to I'm just trying to think per yourself a hard to
say . 2003340_2003430
well so that's that's the first . 2010340_2011630
that's one perjury . 2011680_2012740
now . 2012860_2013000
Mitchell and and &-uh Magruder are potential Perries there's
Liddy Liddy's in jail right now . 2025990_2027690
he's serving his trying to get good time right now . 2028410_2030920
I think Lydia is probably in his own bizarre way the strongest of
&-uh . 2038200_2038210
so there's there's that . 2041490_2042240
well <your major> your major guy . 2042490_2045030
that's right . 2047910_2048110
I think <he knows> he knows so much . 2048920_2053350
he knows so much . 2054370_2054989
you're right . 2055130_2055469
&-uh he could sink Chuck Cosson apparently apparently he's
&-uh Cosson was to meet with him when he was out there . 2062420_2064870
after now he had left the White House he met with him through his
Hunt raised the question . 2069199_2070560
he wanted money . 2070610_2071310
Colson's lawyer told him that Colson wasn't doing anything with
and Hunt took fenced that immediately that &-uh &-uh that Colson
&-uh just looking at . 2082139_2084750
financial . 2088889_2089250
situation I I think that's that is &-uh I talked to Mitchell
and and &-uh you gotta keep the cabinet about eleven . 2095320_2099550
that's right . 2100450_2100900
that's right . 2100950_2101350
have any options . 2101780_2102500
that's right . 2102920_2103210
either that at all right now . 2103670_2105020
well that's you know that's that's the question . 2105830_2107380
&-uh I go ahead the other . 2108800_2110370
alright . 2111510_2111730
<now we've got> now we've got Kba Kba received at the close
came down from New York it was placed in safe deposit boxes here .
&-uh some other people were on the boxes . 2141070_2143310
and ultimately the money was taken out to California alright . 2143500_2147380
there is knowledge of the fact that he did start with a million
now since six nine he spent a good deal of this money . 2154040_2156900
and and &-uh accounting for it it is gonna be very
for example he spent oh close to five hundred thousand dollars on
you know that just opens up a whole new thing . 2166840_2168670
it's not the illegal but &-uh it's more of the same sort of thing .
proposal . 2173920_2174690
no I don't think so . 2175380_2176200
&-uh everybody does that's right . 2176730_2178590
it's not there's nothing criminal about it . 2178910_2180500
it was private poll . 2180660_2181740
it was proper money sold all through the years . 2181900_2186100
that's right . 2186260_2186720
&-uh he sent four hundred thousand dollars as he's described to me
I assume this was four hundred &-uh that went to Wallace right . 2194480_2197870
Wallace &-uh he has maintained &-uh a a man who I only know by
Chappaquidick study and other other odd jobs like that . 2212580_2216440
nothing illegal . 2216570_2217160
&-uh but explosive . 2218200_2221160
&-uh I don't know of anything that Herb has done that is illegal .
other_than the fact that he doesn't want to blow the whistle on
well he he because he will be asked about that money he will
&-uh they'll say . 2242630_2243430
how did you have . 2243560_2244000
how did you pay Mr Sti well I had cash on him . 2244200_2247320
well how much cash did you have on hand . 2247410_2249040
right &-uh where'd he go from there . 2250320_2251280
where'd you get the cash . 2251300_2252250
a whole series of questions . 2253980_2255080
his bank records indicate he had cash on hand because some of these
how would you handle . 2260520_2261120
for example you just I don't think I mean I don't mind the five
and I don't mind the four hundred dollars . 2269920_2271880
correct that that . 2272070_2273100
&-uh that doesn't bother me either . 2273200_2274960
there's as I say her problems are politically embarrassing but not
well embarrassing . 2281010_2281750
sure . 2281930_2282040
he he just handled matters that were between campaign before we
no law requires him to account for that . 2291430_2292840
right . 2293360_2293530
&-um now source of the money . 2295180_2299400
there's no illegality in having a surplus . 2299420_2301570
no the money there's always been argued by came from pre-convention
yes sir . 2316300_2316670
&-uh that that all can be explained . 2317360_2319020
I think that the vulnerability the other vulnerabilities we've got
up in the southern district . 2327190_2328200
yeah &-uh thereafter Mitchell and stands on some sort of bribe or
apparently Quin had some meetings with Vesco also &-uh Don Nixon Jr
&-uh problem not about but there's fact of matter . 2350590_2355230
that's right . 2356070_2356590
<and and> and &-uh yeah well I think no one has done anything .
prosecutor . 2365140_2365740
no the &-um would earth have appear there for that grand jury . 2366300_2373750
yes he could very well we could presume there not really &-uh
yeah charges might right . 2381840_2383870
that's a little different . 2384200_2384830
I think that would be dynamite . 2386260_2387390
defend &-uh against that . 2387710_2388890
he extinguishes he says a criminal charge if you quote use the
right . 2397690_2397890
&-um well that's that's pretty_much the overall picture and
thing . 2405690_2405880
well the Segretti thing . 2407290_2408070
let's get down to that . 2408440_2409150
I think Bob has indicated to me . 2409250_2410870
he told you a_lot_of of it that he indeed did authorize it . 2410890_2414710
he didn't authorize anything like ultimately evolved . 2415230_2417750
he was aware of it . 2418380_2419040
he was aware that Chapin and Strong were looking for somebody again
this is one that &-uh his potential that Dwight Chapkin should have
the negative is that he didn't control and direct Egret the felony
why isn't it under the civil rights . 2459250_2460410
Statute pick up any of these clowns or demonstrate against us . 2460430_2464960
then well I I I've argued that they use that for that very
&-uh really yes I have . 2469010_2470610
and &-uh we were were unbearing that's exactly right . 2471010_2475450
that's exactly right . 2476740_2477370
but they I I'm not as concerned about that because it's so bad the
<what really> what really bothers me is if this this
they've got . 2508960_2509210
that's right . 2509620_2509860
and the need for some people to purchase themselves as they go down
&-uh if this thing ever blows and we're in a coverup situation . 2514970_2518580
I think it'd be extremely damaging to you . 2519520_2521740
and the &-uh &-uh concept of administration justice . 2522420_2526650
that's right . 2527100_2527350
it cannot that's what really troubles me . 2528180_2530750
for example what happens if it start breaking . 2530950_2532700
and they do find a criminal case against a Haldeman a Dean a
we cannot maybe we have to the that's right . 2543100_2547400
I'm coming down to the value really think is that that Bob <and
so it does not damage you or the presidency because it just can't .
and it is not something you're not involved in it . 2565290_2567980
and it's something you shouldn't true . 2568140_2569650
I know sir it is well I just tell from our conversations that you
I can be aware of . 2578720_2579780
all investigation . 2581540_2584210
but they all very well they were supposed to comply with the law .
that's right . 2588260_2588780
&-uh he was one he was just in the chain . 2591040_2598380
he would he helped push the thing . 2598940_2600010
oh I know about that was the time of I tt . 2600090_2608570
he was trying to get something going there because I giving us I
I didn't know I knew there was was something going on there . 2619290_2622280
I didn't know . 2622670_2623180
right . 2624030_2624220
&-um that's what what really troubles me is . 2625410_2629220
you know one will this thing not break someday . 2629290_2632210
and the whole thing the domino situation you know I think it starts
and &-uh Bob will be accused of things he's never heard of . 2637270_2640410
he have to disprove it . 2640680_2641770
and it'll just get nasty . 2641850_2642970
and it'll be a real &-uh real bad situation . 2643250_2646140
and the person that will be hurt by it most will be you in the
and I just don't think first because I accept it . 2651640_2654180
I'm supposed to check these things . 2654730_2657050
that's right . 2657170_2657590
so but <let's let's> let's come say I'm not confident that &-uh
<I think there> I think there are soft stops . 2674080_2675820
<I felt> I felt comfortable for this reason . 2677800_2679700
I've noticed of reason since the publicity has increased on on
&-um right . 2691460_2692300
everyone's pulling in they're getting their own counsel . 2692680_2694350
more counsel are getting involved . 2694630_2696080
right . 2696290_2696450
&-uh you know how do I protect my ass . 2696810_2698630
they're scared . 2698680_2699070
they're scared . 2699480_2699940
and that's just you know that's bad . 2700060_2701670
we were able to hold it for a long time . 2701870_2703340
I know . 2703800_2703990
&-uh another thing is you know . 2704660_2706270
my facility now to deal with a multitude of people I've been
that's right . 2715820_2716230
and it was so . 2716750_2718690
so so when you come down to you and we can't say put on
well one way to do it is to that would be my view . 2733220_2735910
one way to do it is for you to tell the Attorney General that you
&-uh ask another grand jury . 2744260_2746230
ask another grand jury . 2746460_2747390
the way it should be done though is a way that for example I think
and the ones that did get it it could be minimal . 2760910_2763960
well I think just by thinking it all through first as_to how you
&-uh you know come forward &-uh but some people are gonna have to
that's the long story but also who talking about that . 2785150_2788360
alright . 2789010_2789230
&-uh I think I could for what you that's right . 2790110_2794830
I can't say I can't <it'll be> it'll be tough but you know &-uh
put me in the impossible position . 2809400_2810710
just negative counsel jail obstruction of the only one's not me . 2810920_2828040
well <I I> I you don't that's why sometimes it's something they
I think that &-uh I think that with proper coordination with
together . 2863360_2863480
so it it is maximum to carve it away with a minimum damage to
I'm sorry . 2872660_2872950
no I know he doesn't now I know he doesn't . 2874210_2876500
now I'm talking about somebody who I have over have enough faith in
<we have to> we have to put him in a very difficult situation .
head of the division the United Department of Justice I don't I've
oh you mean like the &-uh <the Black male> the Black male right
well I wonder if that part I wonder if <that doesn't> that
I suppose you the proper way to you that worth a problem . 2928790_2941700
that's right . 2954320_2954580
and you're gonna have a cy problem with the others . 2954800_2956190
they all would expect to be out . 2956470_2957940
and that may put you in a position that's just untenable at some
you know the Watergate hearing is just over hunt now demanding
and politically it'd be impossible for you you to do it . 2969460_2972270
you know after everyone I'm not sure that you'll ever be able to
it may be just too hot . 2977700_2978580
you can't do it much . 2978820_2980790
that's for sure . 2980860_2981540
but even your point is that's right . 2982100_2985710
it may further involve you in a way you shouldn't be involved in .
yes no it's wrong . 2989670_2992140
that's for sure . 2992310_2992790
what you know there have been some bad judgment made . 2994390_2996670
there've been some necessary judgments made <before the election>
and in the way the necessary ones you know before the election . 3002460_3006390
you know this was to me there was no way that to but the burden
it is something that . 3014060_3014660
is not gonna go away . 3014680_3015430
no it isn't it is not gonna go away sir not gonna go away the idea
well and people are gonna get tired and all that sort of thing . 3023950_3029670
anything will spark it back into life . 3030760_3032100
it's gotta be &-uh it's gotta be it's and think the only who else I
but <who else> who else . 3055420_3057020
who else potential criminal liability . 3057260_3059550
I know I think that &-uh because_of this conspiracy that
well the funny . 3074830_3075360
lemme tell you something interesting about that within the file . 3075530_3077900
oh I saw the picture . 3078270_3078860
yeah . 3079390_3079510
the picture that see that's not all that buried . 3079740_3081740
and while we can we I think we've got great . 3081940_3084380
tell when it's gonna pop up &-uh the Cubans &-uh construct this
&-uh when the urban committee starts running down why this
one of these some these secretaries have a little idea about this .
and they can be broken down just . 3101380_3103350
so that's another thing I missed missed in the cycle in the
&-uh Liddy's secretary for example is knowledgeable Mcgruder
sure . 3112600_3112790
&-uh so but what I'm coming here today with is I don't have a plan
but I think it is at the juncture that we should begin to think in
how to minimize the further growth of this thing rather_than
I think we've gotta look . 3141360_3142190
that's where the that's where buying time on right time . 3145340_3148890
&-uh that the grand jury is gonna reconvene next week after sar
&-uh &-um but that's why I think that you know that John and Bob
have never met with Mitchell on this . 3163310_3164670
we've never had a real down out with everybody that &-uh has the
and it is the most danger for you to have them have criminal
I think Bob has a potential criminal liability . 3177080_3179030
frankly I think a_lot_of these people could be indicted . 3179220_3183190
they <might never> might never &-uh be convicted . 3183240_3187550
but just Adic I think that'd be devastating . 3188420_3193600
we for example our or say . 3198340_3204200
well let's cut our losses . 3205520_3206430
and we're going go down the road cut our losses and no more black
that's right . 3215610_3215910
you better it you that's the other thing . 3216410_3218590
better not let people testify and so_forth . 3218980_3223190
and so on on the other hand we realize that we have these
what you know two routes you know one is to figure out how to cut
and get you up and out and away from it in any way . 3243610_3247230
&-uh in in a way that would never come back to haunt . 3248250_3250910
&-um that's one one general from the other is to go down the
just hunker down fight it at every corner every turn . 3257510_3261350
&-uh don't let people testify . 3262140_3264390
cover it up is what we're really talking about . 3265380_3266980
just keep it very and just hope that we can do it . 3267240_3270380
hope that we make good decisions at the right time . 3270630_3272350
we keep our head cool . 3272500_3273780
&-uh we . 3274710_3274760
make the right moves . 3275000_3275700
&-uh <and just> and just hit the heat line of we discuss this .
want to still consider my scheme . 3284110_3288960
you a very general statement regarding my investigation after
basically the question what they told you not what you right . 3304120_3307280
well I can you know if we go that route sir <I can> I can give
you know we could selling we on our possession . 3314590_3317000
there's no the problem you have for these down the road . 3317050_3321280
I think the most difficult problem now . 3322250_3326890
and also the fact we're not gonna be able to . 3335460_3337290
that's right . 3340430_3340920
how long will they take . 3341790_3342630
how long will they sit there . 3343080_3343840
I don't know . 3344170_3344480
we don't know what they'll be sentenced to . 3344530_3345840
there's always a you know they haven't announced yet . 3346600_3350390
&-uh it's even higher than that about fifty years so ridiculous . 3354470_3359520
oh well you know what's so incredible is these people get two years
well the other no have no weapons no results . 3366370_3368600
but they the individuals who are charged with shooting John Dennis
they were given you know one was put out on his personal
they got all stuff with hundred thousand dollars bonds . 3383830_3386580
the same judge who had one guy who actually shooting the United
right . 3392700_3392870
yeah it's just it's phenomenal . 3393190_3394990
<he is> he is just a a peculiar animal . 3398300_3401990
and the set the bond for one of the other . 3404310_3404610
I don't have all the fact set the bond for one of the other
some you I the essence . 3416630_3419630
so Mitchell isn't here <might be> might be worth it having him
and I think that Bob and John did not wanting to talk to to
I told him . 3446160_3446550
I thought you should have the facts . 3446640_3447830
he agrees because we got some tough calls down the road . 3448620_3453680
if we you know on the other side you always charge with
and you know Sarah stuff there saying . 3471250_3473240
see the way this situation get away from right . 3479850_3498630
&-uh recommending that there be very first possible time John
I don't think so . 3521450_3521860
I was suggesting a meeting with yourself . 3522050_3525590
that's all there &-uh involved . 3525990_3531170
and &-uh we're trying to keep . 3533150_3534750
we've gotta see <how we> how we handle . 3535380_3538110
Premier on we crossroad which way to go . 3538130_3541520
and &-uh I I don't want by being with me has more bits and
he's making judgments . 3553720_3554680
well the you get down to the pr once you decide kind of thing I
me . 3570360_3570630
five five . 3573950_3574630
he knows John &-uh knows about everything and also <what all>
are you justice . 3583380_3584980
and &-uh . 3592300_3592590
I I think that's . 3595300_3596460
and then we've got to &-uh see what the mind is . 3597460_3599750
whether the line is one of the of &-uh . 3600060_3603590
continuing to . 3604250_3604790
run a run stone wall having vulnerable points there first
one of the well &-um Mitchell lawyer . 3623460_3634270
and and who's Cole you know who . 3647740_3651920
the other day he came up and co spoke . 3659060_3661310
yep . 3662260_3662430
I got hands . 3662680_3663150
&-uh the other thing that bothered me about that is he a chatter .
he came up to Fred Field at my office . 3667000_3668390
Coles was going away party . 3669280_3669940
I didn't go over there . 3670070_3670620
so was the Blair House the other night . 3670900_3672300
who said to &-uh Fred he said . 3672860_3674530
I hope Chuck has had some money . 3675820_3676980
serious words with &-uh his his friend Howard and had some
know . 3683590_3683820
how did he know what knows because knows actually nothing . 3684580_3686990
that's that's where your danger lies . 3691780_3693390
and all these stupid human errors . 3693460_3695750
secretaries and all . 3699510_3700390
no . 3711260_3711400
&-uh and that I did not Cole sit in this meeting . 3712100_3716060
you agree . 3716140_3716340
no I would agree . 3716620_3717980
okay . 3718510_3718750
&-uh how then who does sit . 3719860_3722190
<I I> I like Chuck but &-uh I don't want Chuck doing anything
alright . 3735670_3736080
I think that's right . 3737600_3738180
I think you want to be careful not to give Chuck any more knowledge
I wouldn't want Chuck at the meeting . 3743040_3744310
frankly . 3744360_3744660
fortunately Chuck very I'm rather surprised what you told me . 3745510_3761040
today . 3766150_3766280
you said . 3769130_3769570
and of_course your your analysis does not for sure indicate
that's correct . 3784490_3785010
I don't have side conversations with Chuck they were very close .
they talked too much &-uh about too many things sort of . 3801340_3806440
Chuck loves he loves what he does . 3810760_3813420
and he left to talk about it . 3813530_3814700
he also name Chuck gone around and talked and said .
well I talked to the president President get information about
and I talked talked that I never talked . 3824910_3828970
I'm sure that Chuck may Chuck might along those lines . 3832290_3835460
I would well anything could I would doubt that I would doubt that
I don't think he would Chuck knee sense but not in sense . 3839910_3843260
I think he's very carefully except when he's doing it when he's
and he called Magruder and said . 3879160_3881090
let's pick cut bait on this operation . 3881150_3882690
let's get it going . 3882710_3883170
this is Mcgruder helping this course that Chuck Chuck also told
he made a call . 3895630_3896100
oh okay . 3896730_3896880
was corroborated by that . 3897690_3898660
the principal . 3899090_3899660
and Dy ever told . 3900280_3901020
no you ever talked to I talked Tody once right after the incident .
alright . 3907900_3908050
<the point is> the point is that amount . 3908370_3911860
you see John's concern you know about a deal because this is the
so why I was gonna say . 3928440_3932560
how do you keep that out . 3941820_3942710
can't keep you put it on a security grant basis . 3944250_3950800
and you say that &-uh you know that this is not you know this was C
we had to get information for National security . 3961460_3963860
but then the question is why didn't the C I a do it or why didn't
because we were checking them . 3977110_3978510
I think we could probably get . 3990320_3991270
get by on that . 3991320_3991770
I think that I think this is a national security investigation that
he said there was treason about the country . 4010220_4012380
and it could have threatened the way the war was handled . 4013100_4015190
&-uh and by god . 4015700_4016830
but but John's right . 4016980_4023930
there <must be> must be a four part here . 4034710_4038990
not something . 4042780_4043310
you two you either decide to hold problems with potential criminal
I'm serious . 4068730_4071170
we talked about yesterday . 4083330_4084260
<you got> you got a question where your cutoff point is . 4084490_4087300
there's a possibility of cutting where you're now . 4088020_4091500
which that <requires requires> requires perjury . 4095330_4099859
yeah that requires total control . 4101609_4104149
total control over all of the defendants . 4104490_4106510
which &-uh no I'm the practice that Liddy hearsay . 4107720_4114979
we dunno about eighty hunt . 4116020_4117260
we dunno that . 4118490_4119100
no I do what . 4120180_4123380
I'm afraid you're right . 4125920_4126580
but we don't know that I think we better playing hard ball . 4126620_4132340
and he's playing hardball .
and <he wouldn't play> he wouldn't play hardball unless he were
right . 4138500_4138620
yeah he like hardball ball in regard thing . 4139010_4144270
he knows what he's got . 4144910_4145580
he money money . 4145859_4146859
oh yeah he twenty I mean it's not easy to &-uh now &-uh . 4148260_4159270
and then if that is the case it was just that way . 4168740_4170830
then the thing to do . 4170950_4172350
if if the thing all cracks up . 4172779_4175180
if for example you said . 4176260_4177149
look or not . 4177200_4177750
we're not gonna continue to unless they cut our losses . 4178370_4181819
that's one way on the assumption . 4183319_4185340
we we by continue to cut our losses . 4185810_4188260
we're not gonna win . 4188750_4189470
then the end we're gonna be blessed to death . 4190189_4191910
and it's all gonna come out . 4192020_4193229
anyway . 4193390_4193550
and then you got the worst vote for we're gonna lose . 4193620_4195830
and people are gonna and look back . 4195940_4197830
look . 4198710_4198800
so that now <the other the other> the other line . 4200090_4204140
however <if you> if you take that line then we're not gonna
that means . 4211750_4212270
then we have to look squarely on as_to what the hell those losses
and see which people can . 4218600_4219860
so we can avoid from reliability . 4220460_4221530
right . 4221600_4221690
and that means obstruction justice center off . 4223850_4233550
right . 4244850_4245150
mhm . 4245660_4245780
now you can't . 4246060_4252230
that's goes around . 4253260_4256760
that's my view . 4261480_4262030
yep . 4263450_4263590
I think Jeff I don't think he wants to . 4264560_4266550
and I think he even would try not to . 4266980_4269420
but I don't think he's able not to . 4270060_4271600
I don't think he's strong enough another . 4271920_4275040
is to require approximately million dollars to take care of Jack in
but you realize that after we're gone and all people that's right .
so that's but the second thing is we're not talking in terms of
&-uh he was told by O'brien who is my conveyor of doom back and
yeah . 4338080_4338220
&-uh that &-uh hell he'd be lucky if he were out a year from now
how in Lord's name could you be commuted . 4347160_4349110
that quickly said . 4349160_4351030
well that's my commitment close_by Christmas of this year . 4352080_4355820
yeah . 4355920_4356030
see that that really that's very believable because <is in>
and he will pay at the time and where he is whatever he has to
and that's . 4375220_4375720
I I would believe that he's made that . 4378750_4380230
I would believe he's capable of saying that . 4382240_4383630
have anything to do with parole situation . 4385310_4389840
no . 4391740_4391910
I &-uh client has now got control of the parole board . 4392660_4395710
and he said that <we can> we can pull paroles off now where we
so he says that parole parole and so_forth is something that I
well so much sentences he can sentence in a way that makes parole
yeah . 4423160_4423270
sure . 4423550_4423710
he can do all kinds of conversations . 4423980_4425620
yeah . 4426530_4426670
he can be just a son of a bitch . 4426860_4428670
as far as the whole thing that the judge review it . 4429260_4441820
there's Noell review of sentences . 4442890_4444380
only the sentencing judge review . 4447890_4449270
so you got the &-uh now if &-uh you at all or is your I think
<Mitchell says> Mitchell says that &-uh well Mitch you know
the same way because they're developed self-interest what John's
well you better get something done about it . 4508760_4510260
that's right . 4510300_4510780
and Mitchell was hanging out none of us . 4511120_4514430
well maybe we're doing the same thing for you . 4514970_4516590
but I let say that that . 4517260_4518660
I don't see how . 4518800_4519510
there's any way that you can have a White House or anybody
we're already deeply enough in there . 4527990_4529110
that's the problem though . 4529130_4530030
I thought you said that they . 4532290_4533240
well and the fact that &-uh when well it was no . 4534040_4540220
but when they ran out_of that money as you know they came out the
and they and I had to explain what it was for . 4545630_4548240
&-uh before I could get the money now they <that was> that was
it belonged . 4560060_4560440
it wasn't all returned in a lump sum was put back in pieces . 4561360_4563950
that's right . 4564150_4564670
and had a r for this other purpose . 4566590_4568280
that's right . 4569310_4569800
and the balance was all returned receipt for . 4572670_4576510
and <I think> I think that was because you know self interest
take it at all . 4588290_4588800
that's right . 4589150_4589470
is what you told me . 4589750_4590480
that's right . 4590530_4590870
and then don't give mercy . 4590890_4591760
well sent back to we just couldn't continue piecemeal giving you
I have to tell Bob I needed some or something like that to get
it was just a forever operation . 4609290_4610680
understand we trying <to get> to get that money back outta here
and what this was supposed to be was loans . 4617600_4619460
this was immediate cash that was gonna be replenished . 4619760_4623590
and Mitchell was arguing . 4624190_4625240
you can't take the three fifty back until it's all replenished is
that's right right . 4628510_4629060
well so we just gave it all back . 4629190_4632220
anyway I a hell of time proving it . 4632240_4637270
&-uh that's one thing . 4637820_4638550
&-uh I the point is what would you do on that's . 4639290_4654190
let's look at the been thus far the most difficult problem they
that's why these fellows have been on or off the reservation all
you're you're million dollars I would just say to these folks .
I'm sorry . 4671260_4671550
it's all right . 4671630_4672780
well that that's the way it was . 4673230_4674860
you want to claim . 4675900_4676710
that's the way you can live with because the problem with the
and that's the thing we kept raising with you when you said . 4680920_4682930
there's a money problem when we need twenty thousand or a hundred
yeah that's what you need today . 4686790_4687980
but what do you need tomorrow . 4688020_4688900
and next year <November seventh> November seventh there's no
well yeah we can put that together . 4714550_4717460
that isn't of court quite the way it happened . 4717480_4719200
but &-uh it's it's gonna have to happen . 4719300_4721870
so you let it go . 4724260_4724910
so . 4725310_4725420
what happens is then they go out and then they'll start going the
mhm . 4731160_4731470
so that that would be the clean way . 4733710_4735990
right . 4736050_4736290
&-um that really you would far recommend that that . 4738200_4743750
no I wouldn't <I don't think> I don't think that's the cleanest
one of the things that that we all need to discuss is there
and so that they can had really investigated the White House on
<I must> I must be I haven't really thought through that
we've been you've been so busy on the other containment situation .
I that would . 4776110_4778710
and so I understand this . 4783500_4785230
but I think another grand jury make a difference . 4785300_4795630
I want everybody to my house call and that that's issue a reason .
not it puts it in a in an executive session in a sense right .
well and there are some rules of evidence . 4809750_4811650
aren't there . 4811720_4811920
there are evidence evidence . 4812120_4813430
you have lawyers . 4814210_4814670
you're in a hell of a lot better position than you're you can't
okay . 4821150_4821280
<but you> but you do have rules of evidence . 4821440_4823590
you can refuse to talk . 4824030_4825340
that's right . 4826620_4827080
say you forgot . 4828140_4828790
sure . 4829350_4829470
but you can't very high risk situation . 4830500_4833260
I can't recall . 4836400_4837020
that's right lot to deal with . 4843140_4847470
that's right . 4848880_4849180
the grand jury has its supposedly have a grand jury <that that>
we have run by that . 4865230_4867260
you do that on the grand jury . 4867830_4868950
we could then have a much better cause in terms of saying . 4869100_4873300
look this is a grand jury prosecutor . 4873320_4876200
how_about a special prosecutor . 4876400_4876750
he's probably a suspect . 4881550_4882660
would you call another prosecutor . 4882900_4884110
I not have . 4884500_4884950
Peterson on our side frankly frankly does anybody not be
no no . 4891140_4891900
but he'll get a barrage when &-uh the Watergate security start . 4891920_4895180
but he can go out and say he's told to go further grand jury and go
I want them to come . 4905360_4906070
I want to go the grand jury . 4906240_4908580
this may happen even without our calling for it . 4909430_4911230
when when these &-uh no well that's one possible . 4911280_4914850
also when these people go back forth the grand jury here they're
they they're be hunt . 4937010_4939510
that's why that opportunity that ought be given some signal . 4940120_4950040
anyway that &-uh says way who's doesn't any money though . 4956660_4971880
that's the thing one of the real problems . 4971930_4975400
they haven't been unable to rave any money a million dollars in
we've discussed before . 4982360_4983070
Eric Mitchell had talked to Pappas and I called him last John after
and after you'd met with John to see where that was . 4991120_4993140
and I I said . 4994170_4994800
if you talked to to Pappas he was at home . 4994920_4996900
and Mark picked up the phone . 4996920_4998100
so it was all in code . 4998120_4999380
he talked to the Greek and he said . 4999940_5001460
&-uh yes I have . 5001890_5002380
and I said . 5003510_5003780
it is the great . 5003840_5004260
very gift . 5004280_5004670
he said . 5004860_5005090
well I want to call you tomorrow I'm gonna . 5005240_5006710
well look what is it that you need on that &-uh to to do
and that's where our breakdown is has come every time . 5024350_5026570
well if you had it you get it to somebody . 5026660_5028890
well I gather Larue just leave it in the mailboxes and things like
help hunt to go pick it up . 5033500_5035450
someone hunting and tell to pick it up . 5035470_5036940
I say we're a bunch of amateurs in that business . 5040810_5042610
that was the thing that we thought Mitchell ought_to be able to
because none of us know how to . 5050350_5051500
you gotta watch money and all that stuff . 5052930_5054610
you know how you got a hundred thousand bank . 5054630_5056210
and it all comes with serialized bills . 5056230_5058020
and you have to go to Vegas with it or a bookmaker in New York City
great shape . 5069400_5069970
the next time around . 5070130_5070840
what_about what_about the money . 5084780_5086120
we moved back out the here . 5086190_5087860
apparently there's some there that might be what they can use . 5088510_5090500
I don't know how much three fifty that we moved out was all we say
that's the we're so squared . 5102470_5105140
could I go back &-uh be careful the &-uh . 5110460_5118360
the grand jury says . 5130610_5137820
we aren't cooperating with <once we> once we start down
yeah we got a full appreciation of there is really no control over
&-uh while we did a we had an amazing job of keeping this thing on
and that was the grand jury the new grand jury would call Mcgruder
for example what happens if Dean goes in and gives a story you know
here was the way it all came about was supposed to be a legitimate
I heard these horrible told Haldeman that we shouldn't be involved
then called him and questioned about all those meetings again . 5184300_5187110
and the like . 5187180_5187670
and it begins to again begin to change his story as_to what he told
the perjury situation . 5195300_5196120
except that's the best leverage you got . 5196780_5198180
he's gotta keep his story straight or he's in trouble . 5201590_5203830
right unless they get . 5203930_5205550
wouldn't we we have control . 5217620_5219660
we have control who immunized you . 5219820_5222260
I think they wouldn't do that without our . 5222840_5224310
but you're saying the grand jury proceed cooperative jury . 5226020_5237620
everybody that is the proper way to do this . 5238020_5240350
should be true grand jury . 5240700_5241910
not there the committee true . 5242340_5244760
nobody's questioning grand jury . 5245120_5246830
so so and then we would assist executive privilege for the
we're matter grand jury . 5254010_5255420
and that would . 5256100_5257560
alright . 5258590_5259010
then you go to the next step . 5259200_5260150
would we then <the grand> the grand jury be executive session .
yeah . 5263950_5264080
so there <secret secret> secret session . 5264240_5266230
alright . 5266790_5267200
then would we agree to release our state our grand jury . 5267590_5271130
that's not . 5272340_5272780
we don't have the authority to do that . 5272980_5273870
that's up to the court . 5274120_5274780
and the court thus far has not release the ones from the last grand
they usually are not it'd be highly unusual for grand jury to come
what would happen is a_lot_of the stuff from the grand jury came
well it came outta the attorney's office more than the grand jury .
we don't some the grand jurors may . 5289280_5290510
but they were not so bad going other way there . 5291020_5297630
I was going might be more interest certain . 5297800_5302910
you just said . 5311350_5311750
help you can't raise the money . 5311800_5313260
sorry . 5313550_5313710
say what you want <right right> right if that happens then that
yeah I don't think get Mitchell Hunt got a_lot_of hearsay . 5327750_5342310
he Crow would go down and smoke . 5344380_5348660
&-uh Crow says the national security that won't sell ultimately in
it may be mitigating on sentences but it won't . 5362730_5366060
&-uh I've tried we have no choice . 5366080_5370670
right now . 5372710_5372980
we have no choice . 5373000_5373590
but my point is do you ever have any choice on no matter what we do
so if a hunt blows so what's new . 5398530_5401820
you know it is already been told to a grand jury .
and they found no criminal liability . 5404270_5405910
and they've conducted it in full . 5406370_5407730
we're sorry fella . 5408430_5409180
&-uh we don't it doesn't on the that's right . 5409530_5413050
you throw that . 5413780_5414220
&-uh well hunt we'll go to jail for that too . 5415690_5418300
you've gotta understand that that's the point too . 5418780_5420740
I don't think that I would that I think I was limited .
I don't think that go in there without done some the national
we've already anyway I mean we but here's client . 5431470_5436730
so you go let's go to <the other> the other decide the grand
and then you'll grand jury the grand jury president move all the
the best thing to do is I asked the grand jury to look at any
all charges have been raised . 5462860_5463930
that's the to do it . 5464620_5465570
and not the board right that . 5466060_5469470
however we may say campus there that that the third thing is
it's very high risk . 5491410_5492060
your view what will happen that it's gonna come out . 5492700_5495380
somebody's something's gonna break loose . 5496230_5498140
something's gonna break and look like the president covering up . 5498190_5502620
that's correct . 5506850_5507310
but I've moved to the point that we've certainly gotta make a a
would you say matter . 5527810_5528870
middle ground of Rancher the ground of a public statement . 5531180_5541660
but we need also also we make the public statement . 5545460_5549480
yeah . 5549710_5549770
we talked this morning . 5550550_5551680
the thing we talked about outside of us . 5552300_5553900
he says that will immediately lead to a jury bond since we make
state jury . 5562320_5563310
so it looks like we're trying to do it over . 5565670_5566990
alright . 5567040_5567310
so here's public statement . 5567820_5568900
and <we want> we want &-uh full grand jury investigation . 5568920_5572580
but the Us Attorney's office . 5572620_5573470
and we said that the reason we delay is until after the sentence .
you see the point is the reason the timing of the evidence . 5581540_5583950
we can't around sentence on Friday we're gonna move the pretty fast
so we've got we really have our time . 5593170_5594670
the the other thing is that the attorney general could call
would you hold sentencing for two weeks if we set Ourself on a
yeah yeah that sentencing may be in the wrong perspective right
I don't know if we're certain . 5609840_5610790
but I just think there's some things that &-uh I'm not willing to
so then the story is delay sentencing . 5623260_5625760
<I think> I think that could be handled in the way between Sar
tells me . 5632410_5632820
I mean apparent does have good rapport with Cere he's never talked
would say he I take a week I person that I you know I feel that . 5641530_5650600
we we could use his counsel on this because he understands the
anybody over here does is Peterson it it is awkward for
but to discuss some of these things with him we may well want to
&-uh related to this case . 5668940_5670270
you'll have no relation . 5670490_5671430
&-uh and to give him on some special assignment over here where he
yes this isn't this is an obstruction . 5676280_5677900
but it couldn't be proved or so on and so_forth . 5677920_5679620
we almost need him out_of there to take his counsel . 5680400_5682670
and that would &-uh I don't think he'd wants that . 5683120_5684500
but &-uh he is the most knowledgeable your honor . 5684540_5688180
I think an appeal directly to Henry . 5691600_5694860
&-uh . 5696220_5696230
&-uh why could the President call him in the special counsel <the
I thought of that I thought of that the special counsel to represen
