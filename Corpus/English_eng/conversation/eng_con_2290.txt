So, do you like California in general ? 0_2679
I don't know, it would have been better without the whole driving
Did you actually though ? 16763_18093
No, but I was close, the whole time, so it was unpleasant . 18093_21974
Ok, and then, then you got to San Francisco and, you hung out ? 21974_26721
Uh huh, with that Katya girl, and, then one day, she didn't go
I don't know, I guess it was interesting for her, but we'd already
I see, And then, so, then you drove back ? 55123_60529
Then we drove back, on one day . 60529_62841
It was, long . 62841_64327
And then we got back, and oh oh oh, ok, Mom got a hotel on
But we got there, there was two beds, everything was really nice,
And it's this really nice hotel and everyone was looking at her
And, so, we checked in and whatever, and we get in there, and the
When I went to New York, also, for my interview, also, they all
A bunch of like, official business people with their official
I walked in at night, you know, late . 115060_117000
Yeah, that's what we did too . 117000_119889
But it's nice, when you get to stay at a nice hotel . 119889_124430
Yeah, except, I don't know, it was decorated, I supposed it was
like lots of bright colors that clashed . 133718_137023
Maybe it's just left over from the eighties . 137023_139457
Maybe . 139457_140405
No, the hotel where I was, it was really nice, and they had really
Our breakfast wasn't included, and it was twelve dollars, so we
That's typical our style, see it's nice when the company paid for
That's nice . 163068_163811
I was like yeah, whatever . 163811_165463
And then the hotel made a mistake and charged my credit card for
So I called them and I'm like “guys, guys, this is not normal” and
That'd be hilarious . 180324_184223
Yeah, I was getting a little nervous . 184223_184578
What was I going to say ? 184578_186490
Um, no, the hotel . 186490_188786
My favorite part I think, was, there was this little rubix cube in
+" do you think you can make this rubix cube ? 194526_197414
+" If you can, bring it down to the bar and the bartender will give
+" Or, you can take it home, and we'll just add fifteen dollars to
And I was like, that's a lot for a rubix cube . 205793_208476
Yeah . 208476_209219
It was really random, too . 209219_210622
So did you make it, and get a free drink ? 210622_212935
You should have . 212935_214792
Mom was really tempted to . 214792_216074
Mom was looking at it, and she was like +"/. 216074_218053
+" hmmm +... 218053_219433
You should have made it, and gotten one of them a free drink . 219433_221358
You know there are people who actually have formulas ? 221358_223792
Like Bor has this really nerdy friend who knows how to make it . 223792_226848
He's like, ok, so then I turn it one half turn to the right, and
He has this whole, like, formula, and he can make any rubix cube
We're not cool enough for that, we couldn't figure it out . 234566_241830

But they played two Beatles songs, and they played just in
And then there was, like, requests, and +... 276464_279520
Well, you can tell them, like, what you want them to play . 279520_282326

Probably, but I don't know . 284062_287777
So did you request anything ? 287777_289263
