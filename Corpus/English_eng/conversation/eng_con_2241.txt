and what's the other thing I remember ? 181636_184877
in the first few days in the nursery we had some <visitors>
but when you weren't with me and you were in the nursery and
more than most babies most babies don't do that right away . 203181_206422
and just trying to see as much as you could because you were
and you wanted to see as much of it as you could . 214781_218022
and it was just a very exciting thing meeting you at that time
as an infant ! 224998_226670
and it was amazing . 226670_228156
so lets see . 228156_232140
what else . 232140_233254
you wanna know what you were like when you were little ? 233254_237630
and you were growing up . 237630_238930
you were easy in some ways . 239170_242597
you were really easy because you didn't cry very much .242597_247158
<you just> you had a <melodious> melodious and sweet voice
and then you would quiet down and look peaceful and happy
hugging you hugging was always wonderful . 267488_271678
<I remember> I remember you being draped over my shoulder a
because that was the position <that we thought was> that we
you enjoyed it and I enjoyed it . 283327_285267
and so you'd have <y> y <your> your tummy against my
for <a few years> a few years .297242_301130
and I think those are times when we both felt very peaceful
and I know it was for me some of the most beautiful days of
okay . 315516_322473
you want me to move on here with what was happening little
sure I'll do that . 328520_329634
um well there are some things I feel a little bad about
but whatever was not quite good maybe it had good things <to>
you see I didn't drive a car you remember that . 349533_352502
you remember that ? 352502_354074
sure . 354074_354528
of course . 354528_355086
I didn't drive the car until you were in kindergarten . 355086_357603
so: we were sorta stuck in the house . 357603_360844
more than most people and just sort of dependent on who was in our
and um yeah we met a few neighbors with children, and
and after the stroller and you got walking we did a lot of
and it was nice days and pretty days and enjoying the nature . 393318_398520
tryin' ta think . 398520_401017
but we couldn't do a lot of things because we didn't have the car
so um ok anyway in that time period that was when
you were smart anyway .429162_432680
we found a way to go to the gym school . 432680_435447
finally when you were getting almost old enough to get to
because you had never had nursery school you never had preschool or
and it was good at first ! 450679_453651
you were so enthusiastic . 453651_455118
you loved doing everything that they had you do . 455118_458193
until there was this boy who was nasty . 458193_461805
and the school wanted to separate the two of you . 461805_466449
and we couldn't do it because there was only one time slot when I
boy . 477492_478523
<I was so> <I was> <it was> <it was> <it was so>
and I was <wishing> wishing that I could drive and I could have
and then guess what, you were a little too smart for kindergarten .
by that time kindergarten into first grade and then of course
which in itself was a good thing and a bad thing all at the same
and right at that period of time Grampy also died . 519886_525645
so a lot of things were happening . 525645_527771
and you had a little bit of a hard time but you got through it .
you managed . 532043_533798
<you were> <it was> you were amazing . 533798_536399
you were amazing . 536399_539640
and you conquered what needed to be conquered with all the emotions
and eventually you really made some good friends . 549959_555532
you really did . 555532_558875
<it> it took a while but one by one you picked up good
remember Allison ? 564634_566017
your friend Allison she started way back there in first and
and then you picked up more friends as you went along and they're
so many years later and I think its wonderful and I hope they stay
a(l)right can you still hear me ? 588218_590242
I feel my voice is like +... 590242_592285
0 . 592285_594803
I need a breath . 594803_595731
&=cough . 595731_597672
okay here I am back ! 597672_599715
okay um okay . 599715_604730
well anyway my point is sometimes that if I had to do
wouldn't I want to get you more lessons wouldn't I want to get you
on the other hand maybe we can look back and we can say alright
and we could <we we we> we did other things <that> and
closeness with each other that wouldn't have happened otherwise . 667380_671838
maybe you wouldn't have ended up able to be who you are as
maybe you would have become a slightly different person . 689114_691529
so who knows . 691529_692355
and so I would like to think that whenever anything happens that's
and all I know is this +... 700528_705172
&=sigh . 705172_709444
all I know is that <you have turned into> Courtney you
you're pretty independent now . 722179_726823
