whose hand in this classroom, .
of the students, not mine, .
would cover the most space ?
and whose hand would cover the least space .
we didn't want to just think about the biggest hand .
as some people would call it, and the smallest, .
we wanted to think about everybody's hands, .
and find a way that we could arrange them in order from .
the hand that took up the least amount of space, .
to the hand that took up the greatest amount of space .
um, let's just do some remembering .
back to the ideas that we had last Thursday .
and what we tried to get out and figured out .
who can remember something that we decided .
or something that we tried, .
or something, an idea that somebody had .
and we're just going to talk for a couple of minutes .
and remember .
and then we're going to go on .
and try to do some new thinking .
and see if we can solve that problem today .
holly, what do you remember ?
we were going to try putting our hands together .
and see whose is the biggest, but it would take too long .
okay, so we came up first with the idea .
of putting our hands palm to palm .
and comparing them and then, um, .
doing that over and over again .
to find out who had the biggest hand .
and Tony found out who had the smallest hand .
but the biggest drawback we had was .
that we thought that might take too long .
okay, Becky, do you remember about our discussion ?
um, um, we traced Theresa's hand, .
and we tried to fill it up with beans, .
but it didn't work .
okay, well I traced Ben's hand .
and we tried to fill that hand shape with beans .
and Becky says it didn't work .
why didn't it work ?
why weren't we happy with that as a way .
of measuring how much space that his hand took up ?
ben, please keep your hands still .
um, Tim, why weren't we happy with ?
because the beans weren't all the same .
okay, the beans weren't all the same size ?
was there anything else about using the beans to cover .
uh Ben's hands space that we didn't like, Craig ?
it didn't cover the whole hand .
okay, it didn't why didn't it cover the whole hand ?
because, um, it left out, um, the little +...
because, it's like that, there's um, .
that little space left .
okay, so there wasn't a way we could find .
that put the beans so tightly or perfectly together .
that they didn't leave spaces .
and some people last week .
were calling them cracks or whatever, .
places that weren't covered by beans, .
but they were still inside the shape of Ben's hand .
okay, who remembers ?
um, let's see .
stephanie, is this a reason why we didn't like beans .
or something else that you remember about ?
something else .
great, what else do you remember about ?
um, Katy's , .
there was Katy's idea about laying your fingernails .
okay, we tried like a fingernail shape to fill it up .
but that didn't work because there's little holes .
okay that left little holes .
or little extra spaces or cracks .
and you, and we found out .
that we just have to use one fingernail .
okay .
after all we said that somebody would have to just +...
we wanted them to be what ?
the same size and the same shape, okay .
but even when we tried real hard .
to draw the same size and the same shape, .
they left extra spaces .
who remembers anything else .
that we were thinking about or trying or considering .
as we talked about how can we find out .
how much hands how much space our hands covered ?
do you remember anything from last week Kelly ?
I think so .
what do you remember ?
spaghetti .
spaghetti .
we talked about filling the space of each person's hands with
why did spaghetti seem like a good idea ?
what made us think of spaghetti ?
what is it about the spaghetti .
that people thought is would work well ?
um, you could cook it, then twist it, um, turn it, um, .
twist it, twist all different ways .
okay, after it would be cooked, .
we could twist it and turn it all ways .
and it would be nice for filling a shape like our hand, .
that has lots of twists and turns .
what problem did we decide we would have then, .
besides the fact that .
Missus Curtis would have to cook a lot of spaghetti ?
what were the not so goods .
about using spaghetti to fill our hand print ?
Christopher, what problems do you remember ?
that um, after you cook them, .
some of the spaghetti noodles are longer than others .
okay, after they are cooked .
some of the spaghetti noodles are longer than others .
was there another problem, Kelly ?
um, if you don't cook it, then, .
you would have to break it .
okay, if we tried to use uncooked spaghetti .
and filled the shape of a hand, um .
kelly said you'd end up breaking the pieces .
to make them fit inside the outline of your hand .
and then when Missus Curtis asks you a question like .
how many pieces of spaghetti filled your handprint ?
we would all have different size pieces .
and we wouldn't be able to tell for sure .
last week when we talked about this .
you guys decided that, .
thanks for helping .
um, that graph paper .
didn't seem like a tool that would really help you .
you found problems with using that, too .
but the reason .
I traced your hands on the graph paper yesterday, .
is to save us time .
if we decided today that this would, .
that this would help us .
the reason it is on two kinds of graph paper .
is because this graph paper has larger squares .
and this has smaller squares .
and last week we talked a little bit, .
some people had ideas about .
why this would be better .
and some ideas, some people liked larger squares .
but we never really talked long enough to .
decide which one was better for any reason .
um, so I traced them on here .
and maybe now today we can talk .
once we really see all your handprints on the squares .
and we can decide .
if these papers will help us or if they won't .
okay, so that, that is the thing .
that graph paper has .
that construction paper doesn't is squares .
and Tim said he thinks that looking at a shape, .
if you could figure out how many squares .
kelly's hand took up, .
and on Kyle's we figure out .
how many squares Kyle's hand covered, .
we could tell if Kyle's or Kelly's hand was bigger ?
okay, but Stephanie sees a problem .
with counting the squares inside the hand .
there's a problem !
because, if it just took up a little space like that .
and you wouldn't know .
if it was like a quarter or how much space .
and you couldn't count it as a square .
yeah, because it's split in half !
because you didn't have the whole square in .
okay, so Stephanie is saying it would be easy .
to count some of the squares .
like, Stephanie, show me some squares .
that would be easy to count inside Kelly's hand .
right there .
okay, and what makes those squares easy to count ?
because they're not cut uh like in a half, or like, .
okay .
so they're whole squares inside Kelly's hand print .
and show me again, .
which was the spot that you saw that might .
cause problems when we were counting squares ?
right here .
okay .
right here .
all the ones .
and why would they be hard to count ?
because they are, the whole, .
the whole finger wouldn't be around, um, the square .
okay, so look at that little part right here .
I know it is not a whole square, .
but to use Stephanie's words, .
you don't know if it is a quarter or a half or a third .
you don't really know how much of a square it is .
okay, so that's the challenge, um .
think for a minute, what is good about the squares ?
what's good about, .
what's better about these squares than beans ?
they're all the same size .
they're all the same size .
that's one thing .
is there anything else .
that's better about these squares than beans ?
cuz we tried beans .
we tried filling this shape with beans .
they're not round like the problem we had with .
why's that good ?
why is it ?
what's, what would be a problem if they were round ?
what problem would that ?
they're like, there at the beginning and end .
where a new bean would start, and the last bean was, .
there'd be cracks in it .
okay, are there any cracks between these squares ?
no .
no, and all the squares are the same size ?
those are two things .
you told me last week that mattered to you .
you wanted something that was the same size .
for everybody and you didn't like to leave cracks .
well, it doesn't need cracks, does it ?
good thinking .
what if, because now that we have noticed .
there are things about graph paper that we like, .
um, what was it some people liked .
about this different kind of graph paper ?
it's smaller .
it's smaller .
why was that good ?
smaller squares .
why is that good ?
because it doesn't use, .
use up little space most of the time .
it's like, you see, they're all cut .
well some of these are cut too, right ?
somebody's idea last week was .
there would be more whole squares .
see how you can see more whole squares inside there ?
see, this one is fatter .
these squares are fatter than these ones .
right .
now this thing on your palm, this, .
these are more whole squares, .
and these are not whole squares .
right .
but um, .
because if it was like, um, big or little or medium, .
then, um, mostly all this time .
when you traced your hand .
you always have like spaces on the, um, these sides .
stephanie is saying .
that no matter what size squares we use .
we are always going to have those leftovers .
is she right ?
yes .
any kind of graph paper you can't use .
well, well it doesn't mean we can't use it .
but Stephanie is saying .
that no matter what sized squares .
we use on graph paper .
we are going to have some parts .
that don't fill a whole square, okay .
think about this for a minute .
how could we trace our hands differently than we did ?
is there a way that we can trace our hands differently ?
that would make .
grid paper .
on graph paper, okay ?
if we use graph paper, .
is there a way that we could trace our hands differently .
that would make this assignment easier ?
yes .
what ?
we could trace it right, we could put the bottom, .
the bottom of our hand right on a line .
okay, you know, I looked around, and I have some kids .
whose hand ended up .
being right on the bottom of the line .
where is that one, Professor Lehrer, is that one ?
yeah, look at that .
katy's hand ends right on the bottom of the line .
of this type graph paper .
how does that help, Tim ?
tell me why that helps ?
um, because it is more, um, closer, .
to the tip of a line line, .
like that's just a centimenter .
okay, it's a little bit over because +...
but there's a space over here, too, right ?
I'm thinking that's one suggestion .
who has another idea about something we could, .
a different way to trace our hand on graph paper .
might make it easier for you ?
inches ?
beck, we're going to trace your hand onto graph paper .
I want to know if there is a better way we could trace it .
on to graph paper that might make it easier for you ?
because the part that seems tricky to you right now .
is how in the heck are we going to count .
those little pieces that aren't a whole square .
if your, .
if your hand didn't go up and down like that .
ooh !
so, did you hear what Becky just said ?
becky said this would be easier if your hand didn't go .
up and down and up and down and up and down like that .
that would .
that would be .
so how do we do it ?
close your hands together .
put your hands together .
can we do that ?
yeah .
yeah, but Stephanie, if we put hands together, .
it would make sense than just using paper .
okay .
yes it does !
it's still using your hand .
would that be easier or harder than counting the squares ?
harder .
two three four five six seven eight nine ten .
there's some halves and stuff .
there is !
but are there more tricky parts or less tricky parts ?
less .
so this is easier, right ?
yup, but there are still halves, you couldn't count that .
that's right .
there's still +...
I couldn't ?
you couldn't because +...
yes you could Becky !
yes you could .
what Becky said, Becky you're right .
I couldn't say one when I counted that part here .
I'm going to shade in the part that I'm talking about .
I don't know what that would be, .
because we don't, maybe a, I don't think it's a one sixth .
okay, so you are saying you maybe don't know a small .
enough fraction to talk about that much of a square ?
you couldn't .
tim said this is a half .
this is a big part, cut off like that .
okay, what I want us to do, .
we haven't found a perfect way to do this, right ?
and do you know what ?
there is no super, simple way to do this .
this is the simplest way I can think of right now .
you told me I had to find a way that everybody .
could use something the same size, right ?
and you told me I would have to find a way .
you could do it without leaving cracks .
in between whatever they use .
and you agree the squares do that .
and Ben, when you thought doing it this way .
that left a lot more weird spaces, right ?
I know what we can do +...
we're going to try this and see how it goes .
all right ?
I am going to give you a blank piece of paper like this .
we have to trace it ?
you have to trace it .
okay, we're rejoining the group, .
and Tim has suggested that one way .
of counting, ah, the squares that aren't complete, .
is to find the halves, .
and then add the halves together to make a whole .
what about that one ?
that's closer than the one we picked before isn't it ?
but where's another half going to .
stephanie and Beck, .
I need you to, uh, yeah join us up here .
well, look at your own hand for a minute, .
and see if you can see, .
tim's idea is that if you can find two parts .
of a square somewhere on your sheet .
that are very close to being a half .
if you could put those two halves .
if you thought about pushing them together, .
it would be like counting a whole square .
does anybody think from trying Tim's suggestion, .
which is, can you find .
two places that aren't colored in yet on your hand .
that if you put them together they would make a whole ?
okay, can I use yours as a sample for a minute ?
this is what Christopher's saying .
christopher's saying he didn't find two halves, um .
I can use this orange color but Christopher used blue .
christopher says that this piece here, .
which he noticed almost filled a square, .
if he matched it with this little piece, .
that just filled a teeny tiny piece of a square, .
he thinks that he can count that as a square .
do you agree with Christopher ?
he thinks that is very close to being one whole square .
yeah, yes .
okay, so then Christopher now has found out that .
he has one two three four five six seven eight nine then eleven
whole squares, the blue .
and one more .
so far he's found twelve whole squares .
did anybody else looking at your hand .
find a spot that you're pretty sure .
that those two pieces together .
or those two parts together, .
would make a full square if you put them both together ?
which parts are you looking at ?
okay .
just a second .
I'm coloring this in .
so you can see the areas she's talking about .
kelly is looking at this space here on her hand print .
and she is noticing that the only place, .
it didn't fill the square is a very tiny space .
right there it goes over the line a very tiny bit .
there like let me show you .
do you notice how right there, .
it goes over the line a little, .
and here it is a little under the line ?
here, take a closer look .
she thinks she can count that as a square .
because in one place it goes outside the square, .
just a small amount, and in another place, .
it's a little bit missing .
do you think Kelly would count that as a square ?
well, it isn't perfect .
nobody's is .
right, but do you see how .
she sees this piece sticking out .
and she thinks that it would just about fill .
that little bit that's empty ?
good noticing Kelly .
guys and ladies, .
what I'd like you to do for the next few minutes .
is to, um, sit down at your seat and try to do, .
wait just a second .
wait, wait, wait, wait .
come as close as you can putting it with other pieces .
to make whole squares so you can tell us about .
how many whole squares are inside your handprint .
okay, Carmen and I have been talking about, um, .
what she noticed and where she is going to go with this .
the first thing that she said was that she noticed about .
three different, ah, approaches, um, .
to counting these, uh, this area .
some children are able to, uh, abstract, and uh, .
not worry too much about the exact, uh, uh, region .
um, and they just, uh, .
merge and say well that's about one .
other kids are, uh, at the other end of the spectrum, .
are concerned unless they fit exactly, and uh, .
and they said a similar shape like, uh, .
let's say two halves of a square, that uh, .
they don't want to do that .
because they don't know how to count it .
and some are, uh, in between, um, .
as long as they were pretty certain it is one, fine .
but if they have to combine both of the regions, .
in more than two than they have difficulty .
carmen also talks about how she's uh, .
going to come back to this in the, um, .
pirates and flags unit .
and how she believes that this is a good grounding .
so in the Pirates and flags unit, .
they are going to revisit idea .
and Carmen has decided that, um, .
that she is going to try and get them to estimate, .
the uh, that, .
she finds it interesting how reluctant some .
of them are, to uh, to approximate
