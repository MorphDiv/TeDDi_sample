what was the right way to put it . 470_1990
&-um . 3100_3270
like this . 6790_8180
and then you could like put like a triangle up here and a triangle
that's how it was . 13140_13990
no . 15080_15170
but this was like this . 15240_16770
uhhuh . 17570_17730
I don't have any clue . 20050_20990
so this one is going to be easier . 22730_24010
mhm . 24660_24910
okay . 25590_25830
thanks . 26060_26430
I just left her . 33790_34390
Danny come back for a second . 34810_37360
yeah . 42750_42870
I wanna see you with your finished design . 44080_47100
and &-uh that's . 48450_49240
why .
today . 50730_50970
so how did you come up with this design side . 53810_55950
the . 57340_57430
oh you were coughing . 58520_59300
the one that is on the four . 59360_61110
uhhuh . 61370_61430
why did you pick that one . 62100_63130
'cause &-um I I what did you like in it . 65150_72810
'cause &-um there's little tiny squares . 80000_82830
and there's try &-um rectangles . 82880_84680
so you liked that . 88970_89460
mhm . 89480_89720
you used different colors . 90180_91020
didn't you . 91140_91630
I mhm . 92600_94360
you like these colors better . 95030_96070
thank you . 98220_98550
nice design . 100090_100820
do you already have a plan for &-um . 102250_103860
how this . 104720_104940
one is gonna look like what's gonna be happening in the middle . 105040_106780
of it . 106800_106950
oh the yellows are gonna be on the . 107180_108470
this one which yellow the yellow . 109030_110660
okay . 111390_111540
so this yellow triangle that's by itself is gonna be in the corners
okay . 117530_117740
do that or be in the middle all . 119220_121720
right . 121960_122050
that will make a very neat design . 122330_123810
I need need . 126480_127380
that's interesting . 136660_137390
where's your core square . 137440_138470
is that the core square you're moving in . 139970_141220
that's the first . 141240_142020
one . 142290_142350
this is the first first one . 144660_145830
this here . 146490_146830
okay . 147580_147670
and how did you get this . 148100_149110
&-uh how'd you get this design . 149220_151470
looks like you got a diamond in the . 151740_152960
middle I put all of three triangles in the middle . 153120_155950
uhhuh . 156910_157000
see . 158370_158470
like . 158520_158780
well here's the tri see triangle . 159700_161110
here . 161390_161540
where's the core square from here . 163250_164430
that's it . 165700_166220
that's uhhuh . 166950_168150
where's . 168660_168960
where's the core square . 170550_171500
do you see the core square on this one where . 172040_173630
I'll go around it with an arrow . 179390_180790
go around it with an arrow . 182210_183100
okay . 183590_183860
so this is the core square . 187260_188460
mhm . 188790_189020
but this looks like . 189340_190190
here's four little pieces of the core square . 191770_193510
yeah . 193830_193920
where pieces that's a core square . 194260_195770
yeah . 197070_197310
and then I uhhuh . 199700_202250
well I see here . 203120_203740
lemme shoot the arrow . 203960_204630
I see these pieces . 204880_205510
so the cord . 206580_206870
square all the yellow . 207100_207840
all the yellow triangles are gonna go in the corner . 208380_210150
oh so that's how you're deciding . 211650_212630
you're gonna decide to put the yellow triangles up in the corner as
so how how are you doing that . 218260_219500
how did this come . 222700_223710
oh you &-uh . 224710_225430
I just press I wanted to this way . 228360_230350
well but it had &-um . 230440_231250
clicked up on here square . 231660_233110
and whatever it's outlined . 233440_234340
heavy dark is what the computer's thinking about . 234360_236660
so if you pick a movement it always does it on that . 236980_238900
so we'll just &-um turn it back the way you need it . 239020_241620
it's still thinking about that shape . 241730_243220
so what do we need to do to that shape to fit it back back into
square the way you where you have it . 245840_247120
just picked it up . 247550_248270
what is that called . 248670_249340
picking it up . 250640_251180
picking it up . 251820_252190
that's okay . 252240_252740
how_about is it also called copy . 253500_255390
okay . 255440_255570
here it's a select an object you've worth looking . 255850_257829
button . 257880_258140
if you read the message . 258380_259110
click down . 259250_259610
okay . 259910_260149
it means before you tell it you do something . 260640_262300
it has to show . 262320_262830
okay . 262960_263070
you rotated rotated right huh . 263460_266510
how did you decide that . 267700_268460
I . 270940_271410
don't fit . 271400_272230
and if I . 273260_274500
where right where it's . 278890_281580
that one back huh . 281790_282740
I'd say . 284020_284350
I'm taking this one out . 284950_285820
this this is the way you have it . 286550_287630
or you could take that up you want change . 288080_289180
it there . 295540_296030
and then I'll get it back out . 296300_297990
twice like where it was . 298480_299300
okay . 299830_299980
that's like the core square . 300000_301380
okay . 302540_302780
and then you decided . 303290_303970
oh . 304980_305070
it'd be like that . 305510_306450
oh I see it in the corner . 307160_308220
blue in the corner . 308830_309540
so you decided you had to move the core square . 310130_312220
rotating it right . 315210_315980
I see . 316360_316600
and then it's like the windmill part . 320980_322400
oh . 323300_323330
look at that windmill . 324290_324940
uhhuh . 325090_325310
and there's yellow . 325520_326550
it doesn't know what to think about by itself . 327020_328740
so you know you're still thinking about this blue shape . 329020_330900
all of these were squares . 331220_333470
the yellow squares in the middle . 334380_335700
all squares . 336580_337310
square . 338140_338280
okay . 338560_338700
that looks good . 341070_341700
put belt on it . 345220_346070
okay . 346750_346990
whatcha going do now . 347130_347670
the . 347720_348450
place you're working in right now . 347920_348750
always gets covered up by the message of what it's doing . 348800_351020
you should slide this up . 351140_352270
so then &-um it doesn't the message doesn't cover it . 352380_355410
okay . 355750_355870
is it in position yet . 356020_357020
now it is it's . 359020_360580
okay . 361750_361990
where are you . 362250_362550
can you point at the arrow and show me where you're trying to
that's a flip flip <up down> up down flip . 367580_373980
this time . 375430_375900
Brian are you going to make a different design now now . 378920_382390
yeah . 383300_383510
we have to make (th)em all different . 384060_385620
uhhuh . 386290_386370
and how are you deciding now . 387190_388300
okay . 388470_388570
oh why that . 391960_393180
okay . 401090_401270
<what are> what are you &-uh trying to do now . 401430_403700
turn the . 408710_409010
how did you decide on that one . 409500_410660
I don't know . 412060_412550
you don't know . 413120_413550
which is that . 423630_424220
okay . 435150_435420
now what is this . 440740_441300
now . 441340_441510
what did you do to this one . 442170_443040
I don't know . 443880_444310
you don't know . 444920_445180
mhm . 445620_445830
that's like the shade and the yellow . 446950_449860
shape . 451060_451270
hmm .
that's like the yellow . 456590_457340
get my arrow . 461180_461900
now I'm taking my . 464590_465510
you can't just cut . 467920_468500
and let me go over . 470820_472420
we have to use shakes that will fit in here so evenly that someone
you go . 480000_480230
this size square square . 483630_485840
what was that that you just did . 499750_500990
what . 515150_515340
did you want to do . 515440_516020
what . 529270_529490
did I do wrong . 529560_530300
huh . 530580_530750
you wanna do the yellows . 531690_532940
and what what yellow in the middle . 533050_534610
the yellow triangle . 535260_535980
yeah . 536580_536690
okay . 537950_538190
oh god . 543100_543800
what . 557980_558060
oh no . 558140_558550
what would you have to do to move that one back there . 559950_561610
back . 562350_562580
no . 562940_563110
what did you do . 563710_564300
you rotated it left . 564340_565310
