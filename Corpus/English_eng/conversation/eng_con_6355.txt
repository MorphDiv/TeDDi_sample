I being too rough .
what's out in the garden ?
let's watch a movie .
I forgot the kitty cat .
I swinging from my knees .
what's I smell ?
it's a seesaw .
I need a box .
I will be right back .
I get dinner for you .
hide and seek .
this is my brand new fork .
I got something .
don't go anywhere .
you're right .
he's my friend
