there was this guy standing by the store .
and waiting for a friend which he had know for twenty years .
while he was there waiting a policeman walked up to him .
and was asking him questions why he was there .
he explained to him that twenty years ago .
when he was a teenager he had this friend .
who he had dinner with one night twenty years ago .
the exact date right here .
and they were supposed to meet here at the same time twenty years
now policeman went on his way .
and he was still there waiting .
he walked to some corner .
and there was some stores .
that were brick .
that were brightly lit up .
while he was there .
I think he lit a cigar .
when he lit his cigar he saw a silhouette on the other side of the
a man that was tall in a trench coat which had its collar
and the man walked across to him .
and he called his name .
or if it was Bob or something like that .
and the guy responded to him .
and said if it was Billy “hi” .
+" you are late, twenty minutes late .
and so forth .
and said +"/.
+" at least we are here .
then he mentioned that the restaurant they had dinner twenty year
it was all closed down .
so he said to him +"/.
+" okay let's go to this place around the corner
but before that on their way they were discussing what their future
what they did over the twenty years .
and when they did that I think it was .
they were almost to the restaurant .
or where ever they were going to eat .
and the place was all lighted up .
and so he could see his face .
he said to him +"/.
+" you're not Bob .
+" (be)cause you have grown so tall .
+" and somehow your nose has changed .
he said to him +"/.
+" well I am a policeman .
or something like that .
+" and I was sent to give you this note .
+" and when I saw you back .
and the note said to him .
+" when I saw you from across the street you looked like a wanted man
so I sent a plainclothes policeman to do my job for me .
my name is Firstname_s .
and I was involved with this lady .
her name was Firstname_d .
we have a son by the name of Firstname_b .
put it together for about eleven years .
we had our ups and downs .
on my son's tenth birthday .
which was February eighteenth .
no before that .
it was my birthday February twelfth .
yeah the week of February twelfth .
I gave her thousand dollars to have dinner .
and we have a party for me and Firstname_b put together .
he was born on February eighteen, .
I'm February twelfth .
so on February twelfth which was a Wednesday I asked .
I came home from work .
and when I came home I did not see no dinner .
and she was sitting on the bed with her back turned to me and
so I asked her +"/.
+" Honey what's wrong with you ?
and right away <she said> she was sobbing and saying +"/.
+" I lost a thousand dollars .
so I didn't bother query her .
or get into it much .
because it's just money .
we can as long as we have health and strength everything is
okay, on Friday morning I went to work, .
went to the bank after work .
took out eight hundred more dollars .
and gave to this woman .
okay .
Friday evening I think were we going after I give her the money .
I thought we were going to have a dinner, .
go out .
and make love afterwards .
nothing happened .
we went to bed as normal .
nothing strange I see happening inside the house .
or anything like that .
but on Saturday morning .
which was Feb(ruary) fourteen Valentine's day .
I got up .
and I went to the store .
bought her flower, card and a gift .
and when I came back home, .
I saw a Uhaul truck parked in front of my place .
so I was looking around to see who was moving .
so I didn't see anybody moving .
so I went back up stairs .
actually I was going back upstairs to tell her that .
give her the flowers .
and tell her that somebody is moving from out of the neighborhood .
but to my surprise .
when I opened the front door, .
it was my place .
furniture was all packed up .
and she had her friend in there .
and her friend's boyfriend helping her pack up .
this was in about a matter of an hour, hour and a half .
since I left the house to buy her, her flowers .
when I came back .
and saw all this .
I was utterly upset .
I still gave her the flower .
and gave her the card .
and she was not in the mood for no lovey_dovey action .
or anything like that .
she was about business of moving out on me without telling me .
to my surprise .
I didn't notice anything .
I didn't see was anything was packed from the night before .
or in the course of the week if it was it was hidden from
I did not see it .
I was in anger .
I wasn't abusive to her verbally .
or anything like that .
I just wanted to know why she was doing it .
and her response was she needed more space .
okay .
I was sobbing .
damn .
(be)cause I know I didn't do anything wrong .
I wasn't cheating .
I was a faithful man .
she continued packing and moving .
all I could do was help her move out .
the only thing she left me with was a bed, a tv and my stereo
she took everything .
the eighteen hundred I gave her .
she used it to pay on a house .
she told me .
she lost a thousand dollars .
she lied to me .
and I gave her more money like a fool .
like most men are .
after that she moved out .
and we've separate since .
I have now been married .
I when I told her I was getting married .
she asked me how come I never asked her .
she forgot I asked her twice .
and she turned me down .
so after that I had to support my son for the next eight years .
while he was in school .
now he nineteen years of age .
working two jobs .
and doing a part time college course .
so that's about it .
the end of story .
the lady was in the supermarket shopping .
as she was picking up a <few stuff> few items .
while she was doing that her purse fell out of her +...
or her wallet fell out of her purse without her knowing that .
so she went out to the register to <check in> check out .
she realized that she had lost her wallet .
she did not tend to look back for it because I did not hear that in
but she went on home .
and when she got home she got a phone call from a young girl who
the lady was in a shopping supermarket .
she was picking up a few items .
and on her way to the register her wallet fell out of her purse .
and when she got the register to pay for it she did not see her
when she did not go back to look for it but she went on home .
when she got on home her phone rang and she answered .
it was a little girl who told her that she had found her wallet .
and she was quite relieved
