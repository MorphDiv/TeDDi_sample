(..) As we read in +/. 349430_350665
(..) actually as we get to: the second chapter 351465_353700
(..) Uh for his part in God's mission . 359290_361415
We have to go to chapter one to get a little background . 361580_364030
(..) Read with me in verse six of chapter one . 365285_367645
(..) &=in &{l=READ Now Joseph and all his brothers 368635_370770
&=in But the Israelites were fruitful 372675_374700
&=in so that the land was filled with them . 377745_380095
&=in Then a new king 380095_381990
(..) Look 386025_386675
the Israelites have become much too numerous for us . 387795_391900
(..) Come 392160_392800
or they will become even more numerous 394410_396525
(..) fight against us 399730_400745
(..) &=in So they put the slave masters over them . 402085_404875
to oppress them and f- +/. 404875_406010
with forced labor . 406010_407575
&=in And they built (..) Python 407575_409890
(..) As store cities . 411710_412795
(..) For Pharaoh . 412835_413845
(..) But the more they were oppressed 415000_416635
So the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites . 418355_420805
And worked them ruthlessly . 420805_422160
(..) &=in They made their lives bitter 422160_424100
&=in And with a:ll kinds of work in the fields . 425880_428225
&=in In all their hard labor 428500_430520
(..) The king 435230_435955
Because 439190_439850
who were their servants . 442400_443770
(..) As they took a census 445280_447015
(..) With their own . 452465_453455
Of the Egyptians . 453455_454585
And this was upsetting 454810_455860
(..) &=in (..) From his perspective 459825_461665
they r- +/. 462060_462565
you know 462595_462950
You know 468720_469200
&=in (..) So the next part of the chapter 482880_484999
he works the men very hard . 487480_489305
He said man if I work these guys ha:rd 489305_490840
⌈ &=laugh &=laugh ⌉ . 496065_496600
⌊ You know 496250_496510
That's his first ⌈ strategy . 497890_498920
⌊ &=laugh &=laugh ⌋ . 498380_499055
so ⌉ let's make it hard for them . 498945_500435
Let's really work 500430_501250
&=laugh &=laugh ⌈ &=laugh ⌉ . 502000_502625
⌊ so that ⌋ they're too tired to go home 502570_504210

procreate . 504970_505765
&=LAUGHTER ⌈ &=lengthened ⌉ &=lengthened . 505765_508315
⌊ We'll use that word ⌋ . 507210_508225
&=in But that didn't work . 510780_512185
Cause they st- +/. 512185_512530
They continued ⌈ to +... 512530_513585
⌊ &=LAUGHTER ⌋ . 513285_516775
They Continued +/. 514070_514970
&=ex &=in They continued to d- +/. 514970_516120

And they ⌈ continued to ⌉ multiply . 517695_519255
⌊ &=laugh &=laugh ⌋ . 517725_518265
(..) So he g- devises another plan . 520530_523085
He goes to the midwives . 523085_524850
(..) You know the Israelites had midwives . 524850_526695
They didn't have doctors 526695_527600
(..) &=in (..) Or in the birthing process . 537395_539545
(..) And so he goes to the midwives and says 541130_543350
Here's what I want you to do . 543820_544895
(..) you go 545015_545835
(..) If it's a girl 553070_553860
(..) And that was his plan . 556220_557290
(..) Well the midwives 558160_559375
(..) Because they feared God 565695_566890
&=in And when uh he calls em 568080_570050
They're still multiplying . 570895_571999
&=laugh &=laugh ⌈ There's still boys being born here ⌉ . 571999_574360
⌊ &=laugh &=laugh &=laugh &=laugh &=laugh &=laugh
&=in (..) what is going on . 575320_577220
(..) The midwives said 578860_580120
You know 584370_584730
And they're just going ahead and having em . 585750_586850
They're s- +/. 586850_587180
&=in sturdy women . 587180_588780
(..) &=LAUGHTER ⌈ &=lengthened ⌉ &=lengthened . 588780_593075
⌊ It says 590550_590970
And so Pharaoh comes up with another plan . 593540_595565
It ends up in the (..) final verse of this chapter . 595565_598415
&=in (..) Verse twenty-two . 598595_601480
&{l=READ Then Pharaoh gave this order 601480_602905
Every boy that is born 603885_605435
(..) you must throw into the Nile . 606010_608075
&=in But let every girl live &}l=READ . 608075_610310
(..) So he's ordering his people to go . 611195_613235
And every boy that is born to the Israelites 613235_615550
Throw em in the river . 616535_617550
(..) Well Moses was born about this time . 622070_624030
(..) And this is how God preserved (..) Moses . 630275_632845
(..) Now Moses's mother (..) loved her child . 634930_637475
(..) And she didn't want to throw him in . 638510_639735
I don't think any of the mothers did . 639735_641350
(..) And she wasn't gonna do it herself 641350_643145
&=in (..) And Moses already 648320_650515
(..) And the mother 657615_658600
And that's where she was hiding him . 664180_665255
But it says for three months 665255_666420
in the river 669835_670540
&=in Uh 672240_673080
she was assuming that she was gonna get caught pretty soon 674999_677680
And it doesn't say here that she devised a plan 679950_682050
(..) She b- she m- got a basket . 686930_688875
(..) She perhaps made the basket . 688875_690625
(..) Probably did . 690625_691410
&=in and then she put 691410_692660
(..) So that water wouldn't come up through it . 698410_700305
&=in And she put a blanket 700305_702285
she brought it down to the river . 705750_706999
Now she didn't just go anywhere in the river 706999_709075
Not just because there were reeds there 711335_713635
(..) And this was a selected place . 718960_720750
&=in The mother took the baby 720835_722440
(..) And told her sister to keep an eye on it . 726345_728585
(..) To keep an eye on him so that 729370_730775
(..) &=in So the w- +/. 737145_738185
so Moses was floating along in the water . 738185_740360
(..) The Pharaoh's daughter came down to +/. 741930_743805
to take her bath &=ex ? 743805_745195
(..) And she sees the basket . 745195_747180
And she sends her servant out to get the basket and bring it to
&=in And she opens it up 750445_752285
(..) And she just decided to keep him . 758705_760600
(..) It said 761150_761535
(..) &=in &{l=VOX Aw- aw 763925_765785
&=laugh &=laugh &=laugh &=laugh . 766815_767730
&=in (..) And so she 767730_769505
We:ll . 770910_771870
(..) Here's what pha- +/. 772185_773260
uh 773260_773565
(..) That was her cue . 774680_775930
&=in She comes out from hiding 776385_778335
⌊ &=LAUGHTER ⌋ . 782865_784600
says ⌉ 784155_784555
(..) Allow me: 788400_789760
(..) I know of an Israelite nurse 792100_794100
(..) Guess who . 797050_797970
(..) &=in &{l=SM Her mother &}l=SM . 798725_800160
(..) So she goes and gets: the mother . 801150_803075
&=in Now . 803075_804310
(..) Why do I think this is something that (..) the mother knew
(..) Cause it ends up that 809700_810955
&=in (..) But she also 816770_819005
&=LAUGHTER . 821735_827285
So God not only spared his life 829040_830800
(..) for that whole family . 832935_833990
&=tsk &=in But especially for Moses . 833990_836110
(..) &=in So we see how 836110_838015
(..) We also see how God prepared Moses 843920_846630
(..) Moses's life is kinda divided into three &=in stages . 849665_853340
Each being forty years . 853340_854660
The first forty years he was in Egypt . 854660_856390
(..) &=in The second forty years he was a shepherd . 856390_859895
&=in (..) And the third forty years he was l:eading the people
(..) And in this first forty years . 867695_869545
(..) Moses got the best training 870245_873155
(..) &=in His foundational training came from his mother . 877850_881850
(..) Cause as the nanny 882605_884070
(..) Taught him the foundational belief (..) in the true God 902775_906510
(..) &=in Probably the first four or five years 921215_923960
(..) And he 927485_928300
(..) But not only did he get this religious training 940855_943180
Exposed to the wisest teachers 953130_954970
(..) And he was trained well . 976050_977480
(..) And he had great knowledge . 978155_979780
(..) A lot of knowledge . 980530_981775
(..) That he was uh 982325_983395
(..) And then for the next forty years . 988800_990700
he was exiled . 990700_991715
(..) From Egypt . 991715_992865
(..) Because 993760_994500
(..) thinking 996250_997040
&=in He tries to help 1021845_1023490
(..) And he realized if these- +/. 1042605_1043840
if these men knew 1043840_1044890
He fled . 1048290_1049040
&=in He ran . 1049040_1050260
(..) He went out into the wilderness . 1051270_1052835
(..) After a few days of uh walking 1062670_1064740
(..) And saved their lives . 1092585_1094100
and saved their livestock . 1094100_1095920
&=in And so they invited him to come with them 1095920_1098655
(..) uh 1105270_1105850
As Ken (..) shared with us the other day 1107300_1109645
&=in (..) So for the next forty years . 1113685_1123755
(..) he becomes a sheep herder 1123755_1125375
(..) Who was a a Midian priest . 1126655_1128745
(..) And during that forty years 1131815_1133250
First of all he became an outdoorsman . 1135345_1136905
He became used to being out in the wilderness . 1136905_1139420
(..) And that's gonna be important for him 1139420_1141000
&=in (..) Another thing he's 1142915_1145165
(..) And uh he got to know the terrain 1150695_1152700
And that was important because he was gonna spend his final forty
and it was important that he knew where there- 1158675_1160065
&=in (..) Uh 1164310_1165505
(..) &=in God also: has prepared us 1170885_1173655
for our part 1175455_1176420
(..) God is continually building character . 1180335_1182585
And I think 1182585_1183205
Cause he no longer had everything he wanted 1189775_1191885
He had to learn . 1195705_1196330
He had to &=in learn how to depend on God . 1196330_1198990
(..) ON this God that he had learned about . 1198990_1201090
(..) From his mother . 1201500_1202520
(..) And God is interested in building character in us . 1207975_1210660
as individuals . 1210660_1211925
(..) In fact 1213625_1214110
(..) And how we do it . 1218880_1219980
(..) And so a_lot_of what we experience 1221585_1223195
(..) And so when we're trying to decide w- which we should do or not
(..) I believe that God has created 1248315_1250220
(..) To be involved in His mission . 1253730_1255460
(..) To be involved in reaching out to the unloved and the hurting . 1258225_1261170
(..) To be an influence . 1263830_1265385
(..) to the community of Uptown 1266400_1268105
(..) To be a beacon of light 1273640_1275437
(..) God has also created and prepared Uptown Baptist Church 1289670_1292615
(..) And that wasn't our reasoning 1307540_1309393
&=in And this is not for our pride 1321145_1323490
(..) I'm amazed at how (..) people from all over the world 1328525_1331805
(..) or they read a book 1338670_1339825
(..) God has crea- +/. 1350330_1351365
also: created an prepared you and me 1351365_1354595
(..) First of all He's called us each to a love relationship with
(..) Some of us have accepted that call 1362630_1364805
(..) But still 1367565_1368550
(..) He's brought us together from many backgrounds 1382090_1384661
to be a family . 1386501_1387785
&=in A family of followers (..) of Christ . 1387785_1390967
(..) A family to be involved in God's mission . 1393660_1396515
(..) Building the Kingdom of God . 1398095_1399765
