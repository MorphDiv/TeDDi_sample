so Alex's isn't always symmetrical when it is next to Paul's . 0_4311
Alex's core square will always be symmetrical . 4311_7686
because Alex designed a core square that is symmetrical . 7686_11108
xxx . 11108_11496
for this project and for this project Paul designed one that was
so we know that it's okay to have core squares that are symmetrical
I was just showing you samples . 23726_25628
how would flipping and turning <have to> help you test for
what kind of flip should I try Justin ? 30010_32808
up . 32808_33393
up down flip ? 33393_34193
okay we'll do an up down flip on Alex's and it looks like that . 34193_37631
we'll do an up down flip on Paul's and it looks like that . 37631_40216
do both of them look different then when they started ? 40216_43591
no (be)cause um I think it means opposite . 43591_48373
you think symmetrical means opposite ? 48373_49991
yeah because they're not +/. 49991_52028
shh . 52028_52456
tell me more about that ? 52456_53360
(be)cause when Justin did an up down flip . 53360_55243
the green . 55243_56778
the green right there . 56778_58711
was down here . 58711_59855
and the red right here was up there . 59855_60878
and um Paul's squares like that the squares were upside down . 60878_67876
(o)kay I did an up down flip on both of them right ? 67876_71306
and did they both look different ? 71306_74313
the top came to the bottom and the bottom came to the top right ? 74313_77140
the blue . 77140_78306
so did anything different happen to Alex's that happened to Paul's
here they both are back in the starting position . 85386_87490
and here they both are after and up down flip . 87490_90731
they both look different ? 90731_92598
they both look different . 92598_93581
but um um here um . 93581_95306
these two right here . 95306_97706
um +/. 97706_99348
but that's that's the way Alex's design is . 99348_101598
yeah I know . 101598_102453
on these two right here um it was the opposite because both sides
but Paul's is the opposite too though . 110753_111786
both of these sides on this one are the same . 111786_115063
what do you mean when you say that Brittany ? 115063_116981
well like um there's a there's a green and red, there's a green and
then there's a blue and red then there's a blue and red . 122181_124416
so Alex has a design that has two sides the same ? 124416_128411
yeah . 128411_129116
what about Paul's ? 129116_131626
yes . 131626_132586
no . 132586_132778
0 . 132778_134295
Paul's isn't . 134295_135078
yeah . 135078_136228
yeah it is . 136228_137081
be(cause) orange here . 137081_138611
and or blue here . 138611_140710
and orange here and blue there . 140710_141978
what did Brittany say ? 141978_143675
Brittany said she saw that Alex's design had <two sides that are
<but I went up> . 147926_148708
but I went up on Alex's . 148708_149508
not not sideways . 149508_151740
well I could turn his like this (be)cause we found out it's still
now does he have two sides that are the same ? 157325_160423
yeah yeah . 160423_166345
tell me how uh the two sides are the same Brittany . 166345_171073
well um because if you just cut it like right there +/. 171073_177673
uhhuh . 177673_178686
the um the orange triangle will always be on the uh left . 178686_183380
it's always on the left . 183380_186556
upper left . 186556_186773
okay so look um she's <looking> asking you to look at the
she's saying if you cut in half right here . 192673_194410
if you cut right here with your scissors the orange triangle would
(o)kay but then let's look at Alex's for a minute and imagine doing
um . 203535_204701
here the red triangle is on the right and here the red triangle's
I think Brittany has an interesting idea going there . 210586_224398
look let's use the other two examples and see if they help us . 224398_228696
put the same kind of thinkings you're doing together .
hey ! 232046_232798
you two used the same colors . 232798_233820
we used the same colors but you know and we used the same kinds
we each used one square +/. 238513_240108
xxx you're holding Ashley's the wrong way . 240108_241013
<I'm not holding them the right way yet> . 241013_243210
<xxx triangles> . 243210_244108
I used one square and six triangles . 244108_246461
and Ashley used one square and six triangles . 246461_248341
but you know what ? 248341_249331
hers is symmetrical and mine is not . 249331_251248
so let's look at them . 251248_252528
and see why that is . 252528_255511
Ashley and I used the same colors . 255511_257641
Ashley and I used the same kinds of shapes . 257641_260769
and the same number of shapes . 260769_262603
one square . 262603_264418
six triangles . 264418_265568
Ashley's core square is symmetrical . 265568_269168
my core square is not . 269168_272486
0 . 272486_273535
waddya think ? 273535_274801
Justin . 274801_275250
They are arranged in different ways in different shapes in
right but why is her's symmetrical and mine isn't ? 278353_281635
because if we put the two symmetrical ones together . 281635_287246
Alex's and Ashley's . 287246_290585
these are two symmetrical ones that we have . 290585_294120
they're not the same are they ? 294120_297808
but they are both symmetrical . 297808_300025
<I'm not> . 300025_301020
<so they are identical> . 301020_302305
I'm not trying to I'm not trying to trick you . 302305_304318
they really are symmetrical . 304318_305785
what makes them symmetrical ? 305785_306996
what can I do to Ashley's that I can do to Alex's . 306996_311980
but I can't do to mine and I can't do to Paul's . 311980_314996
no matter how hard I try . 314996_317250
hmm . 317250_321945
go back to thinking about that idea that Vanessa and Justin and
I need you come sit right up in front of Justin . 331178_334551
and I need your eyes up front and I need you thinking about what we
uh right in front of Justin . 338158_340890
exactly in front of him . 340890_342508
thank you . 342508_343280
um what makes these two symmetrical . 343280_347743
there's something I can do Alex's and I could do it to Ashley's and
I couldn't do it . 353478_354713
can I flip and turn mine ? 354713_356923
yes . 356923_357513
can I flip and turn Alex and Ashley's ? 357513_360286
yes . 360286_361003
so it can't be flipping and turning . 361003_362906
um . 362906_363873
are they the and all of them are the same size right ? 363873_366101
even the one that is not symmetrical . 366101_367098
yes . 367098_367483
so it's not that these two are bigger . 367483_370393
or smaller . 370393_372045
or smaller . 372045_372810
but there is something about them that makes them symmetrical . 372810_375745
let's see . 375745_377645
what about a couple of different samples . 377645_378948
Asratu could I have your core square and Kevin could I have yours ?
thank you . 382210_383946
Asratu's core square is symmetrical . 383946_391008
Kevin's core square is not symmetrical . 391008_396690
ah ! 396690_400108
what are you thinking Brittany ? 400108_401891
um I think that symmetrical means that um . 401891_404413
well like on um Kevin's um . 404413_407740
he made like an arrow going up there . 407740_411405
I think I know why his isn't symmetrical because he has half of it
so if something is has half of it blue and half of it green it
this one it's all blue and on the top it's all green . 422245_425571
um okay well test that against somebody else's . 425571_431208
like Ashley's . 431208_432498
Ashley's is symmetrical also . 432498_435790
how does your thinking work when you look at Ashley's design ? 435790_438578
Amanda sit xxx ! 438578_440610
yeah you have to sit flat thanks Amanda . 440160_441950
uh um the upper two corners there's always yellow ? 441950_446265
xxx yellow . 446265_447785
hmm . 447785_451621
on the upper corner there's yellow . 451621_453111
Kevin's ? 453111_458995
Kevin's is not symmetrical . 458995_461111
but Ashley's is . 461111_463610
they both did use yellow but they used yellow in a different way . 463610_468093
um Asratu's is and Ashley's is so +... 468093_473658
uh . 473658_475178
I dunno . 475178_476260
they both have +... 476260_481230
well there's one has all triangles and one has one &~s +... 481230_489665
right we already said that it can't depend on how any squares and
hmm . 492830_493980
because we found some that +/. 493980_496750
they both have colors ? 496750_499945
it can't have to do with color though either . 499945_502526
Teddy I would love to hear your idea . 502526_504326
do you know what we could do to both of these ? 504326_507210
or why are they symmetrical . 507210_510591
and this one that Kevin did is not ? 510591_513413
getting back to that idea we started talking about this before
Maude and Amelia had to find the center of the bedspread and mark
Vanessa described to use how you would find the center of a piece
and Justin talked about finding the center of something . 541213_545510
um . 545510_546151
I dunno does that idea help you at all when you look at these two
Nicole I need you to scoot out a little more . 551671_553883
does thinking about the center or the middle help you figure out +.
++ because their um Vanessa and Justin were right . 559098_562165
the reason they marked the middle +. 562165_564070
Nathan please don't make me stop again to ask you to sit up . 564070_566615
++ the reason they found the middle of +/. 566615_567755
