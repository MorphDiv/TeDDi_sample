okay, the title of the story is O'Henry .
it was about a guy .
I'm sorry .
I'm not going to remember his name, I guess .
but anyway, he was supposed to meet one of his old friends .
he was supposed to meet one of his old friends at a pub, I guess .
I don't know .
and he knew for sure that that friend would not basically let him
that that person would be there regardless to what .
when while he was waiting there on the corner for the friend, he
at which time the policeman walked up to him .
and asked if he was okay .
and he responded back to the policeman .
and they began to converse .
and then the policeman went about his own, his way .
shortly then after that, he was approached by another gentleman in
and he assumed that it was his friend that he had been waiting for .
basically, although he assumed that it was his friend after
and they walked on to the pub, I guess .
he took another look .
and realized that you_know there was something different,
and one of the features was his nose, okay .
and that made him somewhat curious .
although people change, there are some things that don't change on
and at which time the gentleman identified who he was, which I'm
because this person that was waiting on the other person was
and at the time that he had lit the cigarette or lit the lighter,
and because he didn't have the heart to confront him he went around
after he had been arrested by this gentleman, he was given a note
and in the note his friend Jimmy wrote to him, he told him what he
and that's it .
that's all I remember .
the characters would be myself, my grandmother, and my aunt .
I remember a story my grandmother told me about when I was a baby .
because she's the one who had to raise me because of my mother's
and how she would dress me .
and place me on the porch .
and people would come pass and always compliment .
but she and my aunt were the sole people that brought me up .
I had a very good childhood .
very good childhood .
we played basic games that kids now don't know how to do .
we played jump rope .
we did Chinese jump rope .
we did jacks .
we did all of those things .
played dodge ball .
and then we knew also that there was a rule in our family that when
nobody had better come find you .
you had better be in the house .
so we always knew that .
in my neighborhood where I grew up there was a doowop group that we
which we were allowed to come back out on the porch .
and listen to .
they would stand on the corner by the mailbox .
and sing almost all the way up until eleven o'clock .
and in the summertime, we were allowed to stay out with my
we could sit on the porch .
but we always hear these men singing .
and it was so wonderful to hear them sing .
and as a result, I love singing .
I sing in my choir at church .
and I enjoy what I do .
