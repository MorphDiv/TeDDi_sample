&~www .
there was a little boy who had got a new frog pet .
&-um he went to sleep .
and the frog got out the jar .
when he woke up the frog wasn't there anymore .
&-um he searched the room looking in shoes and under the bed .
he called out the window .
the dog fell out .
so he got down and was a bit angry at the dog .
&-um he went out and was calling for the frog .
he called down a little hole .
and the dog was barking at some bees .
something came out the hole and bit him on the nose .
&-um he climbed up a tree .
the bees got angry .
&-um the bees started chasing the dog .
and he fell out the tree .
an owl popped out .
so he fell out .
uhhuh .
&-um the owl flew over to another tree .
he climbed up a rock and was calling for the frog still .
and then a little antelope reindeer jumped up .
and he fell on the head .
+< that's cool .
it was running away .
and then he fell off that animal's head and fell down a little hill
&-um he fell into some water and heard some frogs .
he told the dog to be quiet , looked over the little log .
and there was his frog who had found a new girlfriend .
and they'd had some babies .
<no &-um> &-um he went back to his mum and dad got his frog
