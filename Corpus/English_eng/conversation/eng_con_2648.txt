okay Jeff why don't &-uh try to start here by bringing us up to date on what you've been thinking about since our last conversations . 25835_35255
okay . 35875_35935
&-um we were talking about &-uh you &~kn you and I'd had a a series of conversations about thinking about the different cultures that &-uh +//. 37275_46195
and particularly the bridging or you know looking for the right word or at least I'm still looking for the right word . 46315_51295
but but very interested in in the idea that you've suggested about thinking about the work that the +//. 51345_56385
I'm thinking now about the poetry mentors in particular are doing with regard to &-um thinking about in certain senses conveying aspects of the academic culture that they're very steeped in to the students that they're working with out &-uh in the high schools . 57225_72765
&-um and we had a_couple_of +//. 73445_76245
we had a +//. 76525_77125
I wish you coulda been there &-um we had a very very interesting conversation today in in seminar and &-uh it touched on several issues that we've talked about . 77565_88025
but in some intriguing ways so I wanted to share a_couple_of those with you ⌈ and maybe ⌉ . 88765_92085
⌊ so now ⌋ &-uh the seminar setting being you leading the team in a sense of mentors who are trying to help the secondary students think &~thr through issues of poetry +/. 92025_107105
yeah +/.
+, but in another sense they're more than just a team helping us out . 107805_112005
they're very much our students . 113085_115425
and they know that . 116465_117725
and the focal point that we're giving it right now the spin we're giving it &-uh for potential research purposes is how do the academic considerations in what we call the academic culture &-uh translate across or bridge between &-uh the popular culture which is what we're thinking &-uh is +/. 118345_141585
+, ⌈ yeah and I'm I'm still &~s ⌉ +/. 142165_142845
+, ⌊ the dominant ⌋ the dominant culture . 142845_143665
course then there's the school culture . 144105_145385
yeah I was just gonna say yeah you're you're you're one ahead of me again . 145245_148005
I you know I think there is and in fact and today there was a very direct sort of popular culture component . 148485_153165
but it's more than that and you &~kn and I mean I know you know ⌈ that I'm still looking ⌉ . 154025_156285
⌊ so we really may ⌋ have three right ? 156285_157685
yeah +/.
+, we have an academic culture &-uh maybe four . 157865_161465
well lemme try this on you +/. 161725_162985
⌈ good .
okay good good good ⌉ .
+, ⌊ and then let's come back to this okay because ⌋ alright so &-um we have a &~s &~w a student okay I have to back up one more step . 163005_170305
&-um as is my habit I I ask these undergraduates who as you said are you know <who are> who are doing doing this course &-um work with us where they're taking <what they> what they know and care about poetry as a means of expression and &-um conversations about those means of expression &-um and trying to make sense of of &-um sort_of all that they bring in terms of their background experience knowledge . 170865_200845
&-um given &-uh we've now made the move from the abstract &~w it'd be really nice to talk with some poets about their poetry to now . 202105_212885
we have actual poets with poetry and some of the poetry is problematic in very interesting ways . 213025_218205
and so now what the heck do we do . 219005_220285
because &~bef without my even having to raise the issue &-um they very naturally very instinctively think in terms of +//. 220795_232275
most of them think in terms of the impact of what they say to the poets and how they say it as being &-uh vital in ways that I don't know that you just you you can talk about it but until you're there and you're +/. 233115_248675
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ seeing ⌋ that it's Noleen posting a poem +/. 248675_250635
+, mhm +/.
+, and you have to deal with her who becomes something of a at least &-uh in a &~w in an odd way a presence for you . 251195_257075
that's &~ju you just can't I don't think <you can> you can't abstract that past a certain point &~s . 257695_261755
in a sense what's called &~i &-uh audience and it's you know &~y &~y you know we're asking them they know to take audience into consideration . 262175_268915
but you're feeling that they're taking that audience in as a with a vengeance . 269635_273255
it's .
they're taking it in with a vengeance . 273775_274975
yeah +/.
+, you know I think &-uh we touched on this a little bit last time the the student who'd reacted who maybe I don't wanna say that I don't wanna think about it as a continuum I think that's that's misleading but he's in a different place . 275735_288295
and he'd read a poem and sort_of said now how do I how do I go about telling this person that their means of &~ex that the way they've expressed themselves or their sentiments about love here are just horribly cliched ? 288475_299015
+, mhm mhm +/.
+, &-um and all of the folks around the table have already encountered poems where they feel precisely that . 300455_307235
+, mhm +/.
+, that what's being <that the way> that the way that the the words being chosen the means of expressing these feelings they feel as though they've been there <many many> many many times . 307995_317655
⌈ &~an ⌉ .
⌊ and have ⌋ been embarrassed over the last half of the times &=laughs ⌈ yeah ? 318055_320755
right yeah yeah yeah yeah ⌉ .
⌊ &~y yeah yeah (be)cause they &~r exactly because they've also been there in terms of holding the pen as_well_as you know holding the paper ⌋ that someone else has written ⌈ on ⌉ +/. 320875_327395
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, exactly . 327515_327795
so so &-um so even as the one &~y young man was saying <how do we> how do we do this ? 328335_334815
other people were saying well you know &~withou <I didn't> I didn't have to do the the Garden City story which you know about &-uh but just just as a I I I I need to say it again if just only just to orient myself . 335035_347615
I went out with mentors one time to meet with a group of very active poets at this at at the high school there . 348815_354735
and &-um &~unus you know a a particularly engaged active group of mentors who really were keeping up with things and were +//. 355455_364455
you know almost all the poems had been responded to . 365235_367355
and I thought many of them quite well . 367455_368615
and I was really feeling you know had my thumbs in my lapels +/. 368715_372055
+, ⌈ mhm mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I was a happy boy coming out there ⌋ we're gonna have this talk with these poets +/. 372135_374875
+, mhm +/.
+, and they're gonna tell us about all the you know my interests in sort_of how they how folks maybe see themselves a little differently and <that they were gonna> that they were gonna tell us a_lot_o(f) stories about how they &~b come to see themselves a little differently and and think about poetry a little differently . 375165_388165
+, mhm +/.
+, and so I &-uh you know I asked them to tell tell a little about some of the you know <what's been> what's been noteworthy for you about participating in this ? 389385_399265
what's been what's kept you continuing to do this after school ? 399385_402405
and a &~yo one of the young women said you know &-um &-uh it's been a great way for me to express sad feelings . 403505_413345
you know I like the fact that there are people out there who kind of understand . 413625_417825
and maybe if I you know I I'm &~see I'm getting to a point where maybe I could imagine writing about happy things . 419305_424365
and I don't know if anybody else actually if anyone else's jaw actually dropped +/. 425525_430985
+, yeah +/.
+, I think I I you know no matter how I imagined myself being able +/. 431325_434505
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to restrain ⌋ myself I'm sure it did . 434605_435845
+, yeah +/.
+, and so I I I I have to always be thinking about that because we talk about poetics and +/. 436825_443165
+, yeah +/.
+, you know even the conversation you know here about the different cultures . 443705_446525
and then you think well there there's this other component of it . 447685_451685
which is this very human component of it . 452005_453825
and how the heck to manage that not manage but to be cognizant of that +/. 454185_459525
+, mhm +/.
+, to keep it to keep your sort_of your brain sort_of allowing for those kind of considerations at the same time as you're thinking you know this language is is cliched . 460205_469765
now how am I gonna convey to this young woman that these feelings which are heartfelt +/. 469905_475445
+, mhm +/.
+, heartfelt +/. 476365_477085
+, mhm +/.
+, are could be expressed in a way that as as audience that I might be able to relate to better if you could give me some more details or if you could you know if the language were fresher or if you pushed yourself +/. 477785_489765
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to express ⌋ it in a way that didn't seem like +/. 489945_491765

+, ⌈ okay ⌉ . 494205_494425
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ alright . 494865_495005
so all of that is backdrop . 495225_496125
so &-um so &-uh +... 496365_499005
&-uh one of the poets &-um posts a poem today +//. 502385_506805
now I you know you and I have had these kinda conversations too where Jeff the civil libertarian and Jeff the project director are kind of at war in in the middle somewhere somewhere in the midst of my corpus here . 507005_516305
&-um so &-uh this kid from a &~c high school in Spain posts a poem called called Pimperoni . 517365_523205
+, &=laughs okay +/. 523585_524125
+, alright ?
so here's the idea of so &~i basically it's (0.4) it's &-um in sort_of set in this context where he's talking about pizza <but it's> but it's about &-uh &-uh prostitution . 525545_542825
&=laughs and this comes out_of &~S &-uh Spain . 543185_549245
yeah a school in Spain . 549665_550725
&-uh American independent ⌈ school type place ⌉ ? 551205_553145
⌊ yeah ⌋ yeah &~DO +/. 553365_553505
⌈ DOD &~s ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ Department of ⌋ Defense . 553475_554435
yeah .
okay .
okay +/.
alright +/.
+, as &~i &~i &~s suppose he's from New York City ? 559855_561895
&-uh we have any basis for that ? 562395_564235
I don't know . 564435_564855
⌈ we haven't &~a we &~w we wouldn't have the slightest idea ⌉ . 564975_565395
+, ⌊ I I didn't think to check ⌋ . 565395_566295
we might be able to know . 566715_567415
but I don't know . 567775_568175
+, okay . 568395_568495
+, okay so the the backdrop to this Fred is that &-uh in addition to the the poem is that the teacher there in a somewhat unusual for IPG kinda way which +/. 568775_578475
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you see already ⌋ is interacting with her poets where it isn't just great you know love the poem Steve love the poem Corey +/. 578515_586735
+, ⌈ oh_my_god ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ or he goes ⌋ it's Catman here . 587075_588195
+, yeah .
+, so you see here she +//. 589075_590775
in in the public forum he she's &-um talking about his you know lack of maturity and and I was hoping you'd be able to show some class . 591095_600435
⌈ this isn't worthy ⌉ .
⌊ this poem is ⌋ really not worthy of you ⌈ signed Mrs W ⌉ . 600955_604235
⌊ it's not worthy of you ⌋ .
yeah right out there for everybody . 604395_605775
right +/. 605955_606075
+, okay ? 606235_606355
so what I didn't include in this you know &~th (be)cause there was a_couple_of other pieces you see in the interaction he comes back Corey comes back and says well so and so wrote a poem called I'm a pimp and he didn't get this kinda disrespect . 606375_616975
+, yeah ?
+, and she says well basically &~r repeating I I sort_of expected more of you . 617695_622535
+, yeah +/.
+, you know I mean you've done other things I expected you to be able to rise above this . 623395_628115
okay ? 628355_628475
so my students you know for the last couple weeks &=laughs:S2 all we've been talking about is Mrs W +/. 628895_633035
+, yeah +/. 633635_633755
+, you know what's what's the story here ? 633735_635375
and so you see here Erica you know debating back and forth what do we say ? 636095_641115
do we say something to her ? 641235_642275
how do we handle it ? 642315_643115
and so Erica kind of did a a sort_of a a nice little finesse . 643375_647535
you know it was Erica didn't participate in the directly . 648695_652855
okay ? 653975_655375
+, ⌈ so this xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <so then> so then the other thing ⌋ the other thing which I gotta tell you one more thing and I I'm sorry to interrupt +/. 656435_660295
+, no +/.
+, &-um so the teacher comes back and says &-um after reading Erica's response this morning the teacher comes back and says &-um &{l=READING you see that's why I don't approve of censorship Corey . 660665_671505
because this way there's space for people to disagree . 671965_674965
&}l=READING meaning she the teacher and the mentor . 676285_679445
&=laughs:multiple .
now wait a minute let's track this . 679445_684045
&=laughs:S1 the teacher takes a fairly <stodgard teacher> stodgy teacherly &-uh response . 685345_690125
yeah .
+, our U_Of_M undergrad says . 690405_694045
right she says this ⌈ &~p Corey this &~p ⌉ . 694745_696005
&=reading ⌊ this poem ⌋ cracked me up . 696245_697005
yeah .
+, I really like it . 697245_698885
you got some some very clever rhymes and a great rhythm . 699125_701205
keep it coming . 701465_701925
+, yeah yeah +/.
+, living perhaps potentially you living perhaps &~poten oh dear now what ? 703885_708785
+, &=laughs yeah . 708865_709045
+, and Mrs W says . 709785_711085
and Mrs W says &-um &=reading see Corey ? 711665_714685
this proves what I was trying to tell you about censorship . 714865_717385
I I don't approve of it because &~i &~i &~i &~i we hafta have place for people to disagree . 718385_722605
jeez &=laughs .
&=laughs okay okay ? 722865_726865
oh oh . 727005_729025
&=laughs so alright . 729445_730425
so &-um &=laughs &-um what was I gonna say ? 730985_735705
&-um I (be)cause I don't wanna segue into the next thing yet (be)cause we haven't really left +//. 736405_738965
I don't wanna leave this just yet . 739125_740405
so the issue for the mentors becomes &-um as it emerged in the conversation +//. 741225_746745
I tried really hard today <not to> not to you know I I think &~m more successfully than other times not to kind_of overly guide the conversation . 746985_756525
I really wanted to let them push it in the direction that felt like it made sense to them . 756705_761385
I feel like I've got a group that's really thoughtful about +/. 761485_763545
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ these things ⌋ . 763805_764005
and I want them to &~ha you know the more we talk about this the more important it is to me to let that process unfold as much as I can . 764345_770785
so <I wanna> I wanna hold back from sort_of offering suggestions . 771045_774845
if I can . 775005_776005
until I kind of let them sort_of define the problem . 776765_779045
&-um and so &-uh &-um you know one of the students says well &-um you know we should get out there and say &~som you know we need to get out there and say something to her . 780585_794045
+, uhuh +/.
+, and you know to say something you know in &~res direct response to this conversation because there's a concern which I echo wholeheartedly about the safe environment of this of IPG . 795105_805285
+, mhm +/.
+, right ? 805945_806445
+, mhm +/.
+, I mean <one of the> one of the ways of looking at that is is if a kid's gone out there and his teacher is is dissing him . 806525_812985

or at least perceived to be . 814505_815565

exactly exactly . 826325_827505
and the other &~thi well yeah . 828085_828985
so &~th I mean there's there's that concern yeah I mean &~th those two &~th (be)cause Erica's also looking at me and saying she's sensitive enough to &~s remember that Jeff also directs this project +/. 829005_838185
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and works ⌋ with these teachers . 838445_839565
+, yeah .
+, and we could say something to Mrs W but what if she got really mad ? 839965_844525
this is enough &~t you could easily predict that this would be &-uh well I've had it . 845605_851085
if my if these young whippersnappers in Ann Arbor you know the what's the line sixteen square miles surrounded by reality &=laughs:S1 <if they're> if they're gonna put this &-uh out in front of my kids then &-uh we're we're outta here . 852425_867765
yup +/.

+, yup +/.
+, on the contrary she turns around and says &=laughs see ? 869625_874445
&=laughs:S1 this is what I said to you . 876565_877605
you can't get +//. 877725_878105
&-uh that's amazing . 878365_879045

+, ⌊ <you know> now you gotta ⌋ say something back to her . 881455_882735
right because it becomes a matter of how much are we willing to trust if that's the word I'll use that word . 883235_889215
how much are we willing to trust that Mrs W even though she may not speak to it directly kinda got the message here ? 889475_895355
mhm .

+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.

so how much are we willing to trust that Mrs W got the message here ? 904455_906815
&-um how much are we willing to trust that &-um that &-uh this young man here was &~v you know got enough validation so that he's gonna maybe more nearly hang into this with &~ha hang in with IPG sort_of with his whole self +/. 907405_924105

who's the messenger ? 933265_933965
and depending on all those things what kind of impact might it have and would there be consequences for our safe environment ? 934565_941165
or for Jeff the program director who who they're they +//. 941725_945185
again I mean they they they jumped to this concern before I did . 945605_948145
my my &~f as I thought about it kind of on the fly but as I thought about it it really felt to me that if there was a way that I could justify it in my mind I wanted whatever message went to Mrs W to come from the mentors . 950245_963185
&-um I feel as though &-uh they are more talented than they give themselves credit for in terms of being able to articulate +//. 964325_971965

&~b it's bad enough &~a as it is to wrap your head around it . 1181105_1185405

+, now since the whole goal of our research without priding by me to you or you to me is to get a well well as Merrill Flood used to say if you asked somebody +//. 1186025_1203265
his whole pedagogical approach was if you ask somebody to do something that's hard enough they might even learn something . 1203585_1209705
well &=laughs:multiple I would say the odds here are that we're gonna learn something because this is an extremely difficult situation without adding the layer of what role does such a thing play in a dissertation ? 1210745_1224605
and we can't say it has nothing to do with the dissertation I'm doing my dissertation on something else because there's that's just not what the dissertation is all about . 1225735_1237315
it's not what the research is all about . 1237795_1239115
so at stake is what constitutes research . 1240335_1242895
would we be better off if this if we weren't using the R word research and were somehow allowed to do something which we might not be allowed to do as readily in the Ed School as we should be in my opinion to talk about scholarship or something do you think it would be ⌈ &-uh ⌉ . 1244125_1261925

you're not &~g guided by what somebody in the state thinks or the university thinks we oughta be doing you know in teacher education . 2117015_2123955

and we know that there's good reason to want to do quality work to standards . 2132975_2138375
well now we're &~th here we are at the dissertation . 2139815_2141535
you've got to live up to certain academic standards or it's not called a PhD . 2142435_2146295
and yet the essence of this is the ad_hoc positioning of yourself smack dab in the middle of one of the better teacher education programs in the country &~so some people would argue armed with all of the tortured &-uh difficulties there and trying to make sense &-uh &-uh within the same day sometimes within hours of each_other those two things . 2148075_2174595
and then then step back and say and now I'm gonna write &=laughs:S1 a dissertation about this . 2176395_2181315
+, yeah yeah yeah . 2182135_2184075

yeah lemme lemme &~tr &~s &~s lemme say one +//. 2232125_2235845
give you &~o one of the other things I wanted to share with +//. 2236105_2238305
this is just a small one but to see if maybe it maps back onto what you were saying in a way that makes sense (be)cause I'm seeing a connection when you talk about the formalizing process and what happens to that . 2238405_2249005
&-um and I maybe <and I> and I I didn't think <when I> when I used the word process but I I do wanna use that word very mindfully . 2250185_2256705
&-um because in the course of the conversation as things flowed people started talking about well +... 2257555_2263375
there're pieces in the course pack and I mighta been able to talk to them on the first day about sort_of what the mission of IPG was if I dared to do that . 2267315_2274015
&-um it might've had little or no meaning to them probably little or no +/. 2274655_2279415
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.

they would've sat and listened nicely to me . 2280935_2282695

+, today they were talking they were saying you know what we we know what we oughta do is try to articulate &=laughs:S2 what it is that IPG is about . 2283465_2291125
+, isn't that yeah . 2291985_2293625
+, maybe we could craft a kind_of a mission statement . 2294325_2296405
collaboratively . 2297805_2298445
+, mhm +/.
+, we were trying to think +//. 2298805_2299465
I I told them that I we you know I'd had Roger reopen this mentor space where we talk just among you know our group . 2300005_2306385
and I had some ideas about what I wanted to do in there but I would get to them later . 2307145_2310285
and this came up . 2311435_2312535
and this whole conversation emerged . 2313195_2314435
and so they said well you know &~w and one of them Alex bless his heart <he had> he had a half a page written just while we were talking . 2315595_2323655
+, hm .
+, he said I'll start it . 2324215_2325115
so we're gonna take that in and we're gonna &~tr you know and we're gonna try to hash that out . 2326555_2332455
and I'm thinking to myself it's funny (be)cause I started thinking about the the process product thing again . 2333055_2337355
(be)cause I started thinking about &-um like the way we would talk about the constitution simulation and say well yeah you know <the the> the the quote goal might've been in some way viewing it to refashion the constitution but of_course that wasn't the goal . 2337655_2349795
just like the goal of the Arab Israeli conflict simulation is not to solve the Arab Israeli conflict but to somehow feel what it's like to be dealing with some of those issues that are you know that you know at some level are thorny and complex . 2351115_2364015
but you don't really know how just how thorny and complex they are until you muck around with (th)em a little bit and realize that those fools in Syria don't understand &~wha you know +/. 2364075_2371715
+, mhm +/.
+, if they saw it the way I saw it we'd have it all solved . 2372035_2374075
+, mhm +/.
+, here in Israel or vice versa you know all that stuff . 2374735_2376675
so I'm thinking to myself that that yeah let's let's let's hammer out a mission statement and if we finish the mission statement or not I could care less . 2377095_2387335
in some level . 2388215_2388655
+, yup +/.
+, but &~l what <what would> &~i what would it mean for these folks who now feel it a little bit in their gut +/. 2389435_2394835
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ that this ⌉ is something important to them it feels important to them to hash around with what we include or what we don't include in this mission statement ? 2395015_2402495
is this is it too pretentious to say that &-uh we're dealing with something that people might call irony ? 2402875_2410515
where it is but it isn't you know &-uh &-uh &~i &~w they're they're doing that but you know that's not what they're really doing . 2412755_2421555
yeah yeah +/. 2421935_2423155
+, &-um this may be a a kind_of a a fancy word &-uh it's it's not far from what I think people are doing when they're dealing with irony . 2423915_2433695
yeah that's interesting . 2434235_2435935
&-um I was in a conversation earlier this week with the chair of a doctoral committee that I'm a member of and I was very close to the &-uh graduate student doing the work and helped set it up +/. 2436935_2453455
okay +/.
+, but not the chair . 2454395_2455095
so the chair was asking me &~wha how involved I wanted just how I wanted my involvement as we wind this thing down . 2455695_2461555
and he was describing the dissertation as a this portion of it as a case study . 2463375_2468995
and I having just been tutored by Jeff Kaufmann's &-uh prospectus +/. 2471155_2478515
+, yeah +/.
+, &-uh on the distinction between a case history and a case study I flaunted my knowledge of this distinction to the committee chair who is ten times the researcher that I am . 2479545_2492185
and he wanted to know where I got that distinction . 2493545_2496925
and I initially until I could look it up said the you know the &~t two of the big guys . 2497325_2502265
and then I gave the &-uh academic reference to it . 2502385_2504905
and he said well what is the distinction ? 2506355_2507775
I mean (be)cause it's relevant I think to what we're talking about here . 2508375_2510275
and &-uh &-uh Glasser and Strauss referred to a case history as just telling the story and all its rich nuances for the sake of any edification that comes from understanding the story . 2511415_2527215
whereas a case study &-uh we're giving the stipulated meaning &-uh you_know that it is a story in the service of the evolution of a theory or a confirming or disconfirming contribution to &-uh an evolving theory . 2527925_2550445

who could read a case history &-uh an autobiography of &-uh Jeff's &-uh years at ICS and MAC &-um and incidentally that would fit very nicely with the traditions that MAC A was originally borne in (be)cause of Gary Knowles the study of beginning &-uh teachers that's how Gary set his sights on his scholarly career . 2581995_2611975
