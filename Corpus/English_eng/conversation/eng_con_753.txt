&~www .
the boy had a pet frog .
and he kept in a jar at the end of his bed .
and one night , the frog escaped .
in the morning the boy realized that the frog had escaped .
and he was upset .
he looked everywhere for him .
and the dog got his head stuck in the jar .
they looked out the window and called for him .
and the dog fell off the windowsill onto the path below .
and the boy jumped out the window to get the frog .
<the boy is> he kept on calling for him over by the woods .
and he looked in every hole and everywhere he could .
and then a little animal poked his head out the hole and bit him on
the dog looked everywhere for him and almost got stung by the bees
and the boy looked in every tree that he could .
the boy fell over .
and the dog got chased by bees .
&-um the boy got attacked by an owl and climbed a rock and still
and then the boy got caught by a deer .
and the deer pushed him off the hill with the dog into a swamp .
and as the boy fell in the swamp , he heard a noise behind a log .
the boy told the dog to be quiet , while he could see what was
and behind a log his frog had had a girlfriend .
