hhh Nick you're gonna have to come up off the floor 1545_6829
(..) oh you're ↑recording ? 12691_16860
ihhh yes, I'm recording . 16860_19915
(..) so what do you have to do this weekend ? 19915_29409
well, too much . 29409_32919
but focusing on tonight, I don't know if you heard . 32919_36346
I was talking to Nicole . 36346_38370
and I'm picking her up around six forty five . 38370_42540
then we're going to see a movie . 42540_45224
and then we're going out for dessert or coffee 45224_48568
which one are you seeing ? 52737_55421
I don't know yet . 55421_56536
I am hoping for the duchess so I might just be like . 56536_59630
we're going to see this movie 59630_61737
also becau:se the duchess is playing around the corner so I could
that'd be nice . 70115_72733
where's she live ? 72733_74202
New_House . 74202_75400
oh that's right . 75400_77341
so what are you doing tonight ? 77341_81799
I dunno . 81799_84688
maybe I'll watch tv or a movie 84688_89434
play the ↑news ? 94554_94719
ihhh probably play the news . 94719_96576
there's still a few games I have to do . 96576_99837
do you ever get any extra credit for ↑that ? 99837_102233
no . 102233_103552
just do it for fun now ? 103552_106031
yeah . 106031_106813
I got extra credit first time . 106813_109375
does your professor know you still play it ? 109375_111892
no, hhh . 111892_113295
hhh I told her once but I don't think she plays it . 113295_117215
so sh I don't think she cares hhh . 117215_119323
hhh That company only made two games . 119323_124357
and one is that one and one is the other one I got extra credit
weird . 129354_130756
are they from around here, or are they ? 130756_132698
yeah . 132698_133645
and they're CMU based or they graduate graduates of CMU . 133645_138392
mmhmm . 138392_139772
I dunno where they are now . 139772_143472
probably California where all those video game people are . 143472_149044
although, I think they might be on Craig_Street actually . 149044_152759
and I think about it . 152759_154328
because I think you used to have to go down there to take the test .
oh . 158209_158869
⌈or to play the other⌉ game . 158869_160605
⌊that's where ⌋ all of those paid experiments are now and I find
because I used to be able to do paid ones in the bottom of Baker . 163836_166892
you know, through that website ? 166892_169121
and I just don't feel like walking over to Craig Street 169121_172481
mhmm . 175536_176075
and then run back . 176075_177022
where do they do the MRI ones ? 177022_179623
I thi:nk somewhere in the South Side . 179623_182474
cuz someone I talked to went 182474_184803
wow . 186272_187303
(...) but yeah . 187303_194484
and those are like a hundred fifty bucks, right ? 194484_199108
I think so . 199108_201171
it depends . 201171_201997
um some paid more than others . 202102_206439
someone I ↑thought got paid almost four hundred dollars 206439_209290
yeah . 211723_213004
whereas I think the one time ones are 213004_215150
hmm, that's still a lot of money . 216349_218457
speaking of which, I heard back from that guy about the 218457_222998
and he said that you only get gift cards ? 224688_229518
although then everyone's entered into a raffle 229518_232136
but he didn't say how long it would go on for . 233233_236001
which made me suspicious . 236001_237237
gift cards for where ? 237237_239549
gift cards . 239549_241241
he didn't say . 241241_242317
he said like ten to twenty dollar gift cards max . 242317_245661
but he also didn't indicate if it was per couple who went 245661_248344
he's sneaky . 250490_251233
mhm . 251233_252226
you should e-mail him back and ask specific questions . 252895_254714
I would like to know more about compensation please ? 254714_256822
although, oh, there's free dinner though too, 256822_262561
I know ⌈once a week . 264585_266897
⌊that is so long for twenty bucks ? 266897_267723
that's what I was thinking . 267723_268838
unless they have really good dinner . 268838_270574
⌈cuz I hate cooking⌉ . 270574_272903
⌊it has to be a ⌋ really good dinner . 271938_273053
hhh but it also means no dishes . 272803_275775
so what is it ? 275775_278376
they just record or that <you have to> we have to do the same
⌊he didn't say⌋ . 283084_284320
we'd have to do a phone interview . 284320_285313
and then possibly be qualified or eligible I guess . 285313_290598
that sounds like more work work than it's worth . 290598_293403
yeah . 293524_294889
I know I shouldn't care about science but . 294889_297368
not this semester . 297368_299513
no . 299513_300173
there are easier experiments that you can make money with . 300173_304427
from . 304427_305663
yeah, maybe I'll look into some of those . 305663_310204
you hardly ever have time during the day though . 310204_313715
well if I do stuff after three I have time . 313715_316687
three to five . 316687_317635
but I don't think they have that many then . 317635_319288
the ones I see are always like in the middle of the day . 319288_321804
hmm . 321804_322381
I do have a lot to do . 322381_328492
although when I write down the actual assignments . 328492_331176
I guess there aren't that many of them numerically to finish . 331176_335756
but they're huge . 335756_338728
mhmm . 338728_339554
so I'm really glad at least I'm done with the NSF . 339554_341783
mm yeah . 341783_342776
that should be a load off . 342776_343891
the Russian thesis is still really hard 343891_346985
which I can't believe how much of our grade it's worth . 353550_358419
well, it's like twenty-four points out of a hundred . 358419_362960
so, a hundred being the whole class grade ? 362960_366470
yeah . 366470_367130
that's quite a bit . 367130_368904
°yeah° . 368904_370390
what time do you register on Monday ? 370390_374727
I think around ten to noon . 374727_377904
I'll have to double check that . 377904_379468
I register at one but I got an email . 379468_382734
today from my linguistics advisor saying for a two English classes
because . 390043_391279
you can do that ? 391279_392188
I don't know . 392188_392848
she just wants us to go there and do that so that we can get in . 392848_395615
but, to me that completely undermines the whole seniors go first .
yeah . 400528_401437
so I know I'll end up getting in to them . 401437_403378
so I'm not even going to worry about it 403378_405031
because it's my last semester . 406600_407836
but it's just annoying that now instead of registering online . 407792_410931
which I'm going to try to do anyway . 410931_412705
that I should have to go to the English Department . 412705_415101
well your linguistics advisor doesn't seem to be on top of things
no . 418816_420052
she's not . 420052_421045
it still irritates me about all of the stuff with my research 421045_426079
well at least it counts for your thesis . 427444_431941
she hasn't done any of that yet though . 431941_434253
that makes me nervous . 434253_435285
because I got an e-mail the other day from the dean . 435285_439166
and by the other day I mean a week or two ago . 439166_441850
saying that 441850_443336
I don't know how he knows this but 452130_453821
am I doing a Russian one, a linguistics one and an honors thesis ? 457082_460880
and I said no . 460880_461585
my professor's supposed to have talked to you about 461585_464185
because that's what it is . 468560_469469
and he said well she had mentioned it in passing 469469_472525
and that she needs to do that soon . 474233_476612
which means it's not going to get done . 476612_479213
and I don't think it should be my place to have to remind her . 479213_482306
yeah but you might have to . 482306_483875
well I will . 483875_485444
like if I can't register next semester or something . 485444_488045
but +... 488046_489243
I still have to find out about if I can do research . 489243_492215
at least with Borzutsky . 492215_494156
I have a feeling I won't be able to because she's very busy . 494156_497007
<and has> and teaches in Heinz . 497128_499236
but she likes you and I don't think supervising you would be that
Goldman only meets with me like once a month . 502662_504520
yeah I know . 504520_505096
and that's for my entire Russian thesis . 505096_506211
but I also think if I did research it'd probably have to be
or something . 515582_516242
you mean like your book ? 516242_517811
yeah, like two of my books have the same name . 517811_520373
because, uh +/. 520373_522064
very creative . 522064_523012
I know . 523012_523755
someone else is uh doing Georgia versus Russia conflict . 523755_529661
but we'll see . 529661_533126
plus I dunno if I would be able to do independent research in the
don't use that excuse . 541095_542088
I'll ask her and we'll see . 542088_545432
because if I don't, 545432_547001
maybe I'll ask my Middle East professor 550223_553567
I need to focus on applying to grad school too . 554598_558479
xxx . 558479_560542
because I was thinking next semester 560542_562111
which I still think it's sad 566819_569298
and what I have least time for 573756_577388
yeah . 581391_582134
I dunno I think that once you're in the field . 582134_588244
you can change interests . 588244_589730
well, maybe not in psych . 589730_592537
well I wouldn't want to change interests . 592537_594645
not once I've started . 594645_598647
well I don't mean once you start 598647_601082
yeah, a lot of history professors, like Miller, he's Irish History
that's true . 610824_611939
and we're nowhere near the Protestant Reformation . 611939_614994
so I dunno where the hell he's coming from Ire-Ireland . 614994_619619
ancient Galilee . 619619_622592
I really like the learning mechanisms though . 622592_625768
and I like that that's so broad . 625768_627997
but at the same time you can look at it in a very narrow focus 627997_631341
I dunno anything about those so . 636459_640918
didn't you read my essays ? 640918_643313
I did . 643313_644056
anyway . 644056_648969
I should probably start getting ready . 648969_651569
yeah . 651569_653344
for my girls' night out . 653344_655202
I thought you were going in like an hour . 655202_656854
yeah . 656854_658711
but I need to dry my hair, put contacts in, put my makeup on . 658711_663169
I'll never understand . 663169_665854
