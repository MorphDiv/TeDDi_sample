I can't turn this one . 10400_11420
are you sure . 14180_14820
that way . 19110_19520
no . 20100_20240
right . 20500_20750
you're right . 20800_21090
that four square is not symmetrical . 21160_23220
Danny but that wasn't what you're trying . 23240_25500
to test for . 25520_26060
it started with that four square . 26580_29020
that's not . 29040_29510
symmetrical . 29680_30160
you're supposed to figure . 30780_33270
out if it would be possible . 33340_34470
you . 38140_38310
what . 38790_38990
you . 44180_44280
made Atric yes . 44400_48300
she needs to show me a she'll give it back . 57120_59300
she's not gonna keep it but she needs it to . 59320_60730
show that's . 61610_63850
okay . 64200_64340
<you can't> you can't use that one . 64360_65940
make Sarah lay that down again . 66420_68510
guys ladies . 100110_100630
I need to sit in a circle inside the space here so we can use the
the big . 108800_109040
we were trying to test for this idea . 109340_111110
my idea was is it true that you can start with an asymmetric core
a core square that is not symmetrical . 120000_122090
you can't fold it any way so that the two Hals would match . 122740_126040
can you start with a four square . 126610_127790
like that . 128130_128509
and make a two by design that is symmetric . 129370_132990
okay . 135950_136190
let's have some of you share who . 136330_138270
oh no . 138380_138710
hands up . 138920_139180
we'll just go around the circle . 139200_140110
everybody . 140440_140750
get a chance . 140860_141190
to show us what they found . 141420_142540
out . 142580_142680
okay . 143340_143500
Kevin first we're gonna slide your design into the center a little
okay . 146750_146950
I need you to stay back in your spot in the circle though so that
great . 152140_152300
are you able to do with that . 152740_153870
four square . 153920_154380
well I made so that like x shape in the middle . 155390_160980
and you can probably tell because you can see like if you it up you
okay . 179830_179930
why . 180000_184730
don't you flip it up the way you're talking about . 180160_181740
and show them what you need . 181760_182750
see you saying . 183290_183790
if you did that you could flip it up and it would be symmetrical .
well that's just one part of your design . 186800_188550
I thought symmetrical meant it had to have a whole half that match
and you can do this too like this . 193710_195490
okay . 196680_196860
well I see how that's how this part of it is . 197670_200070
what_about for the whole design . 200280_201720
can you show them where the lines would be where the lines would be
okay . 207560_207830
did you see what Kevin just showed you . 207870_209350
Katie . 210710_210990
you can't be talking right now . 211480_212690
you have to be watching and be polite . 213220_215150
you'll want us all watching you when you share . 216630_218760
so you need to give him the same courtesy . 219250_220870
Kevin showed you these two lines where he's saying . 221860_224870
you could pull or peck his design in half . 224890_227550
and the hass would match . 227850_228860
okay . 229560_229830
and he started with an asymmetric four square Vanessa what happened
test . 235760_236370
well that shows me on the bottom part of your two by two is
okay . 261360_261630
so &-um where would the . 261829_263530
put it back to here . 264110_264920
show us with your finger where the line is that divides your design
okay . 271180_271320
&-um does it is this a line that denied to his in house . 272070_275040
place . 275540_275690
yes . 276870_276990
no we can't . 278180_278750
here . 281920_281990
no . 282310_282470
why and why do I say that . 283870_285260
you can't watch . 285330_285830
see <that doesn't> that doesn't line up . 286940_288990
you do have just . 292470_293240
yeah . 293380_293560
just that one is something symmetrical . 293640_296130
if it only has one line of symmetry . 296270_298760
yes . 299630_299710
yes . 300390_300490
so and Vanessa created a symmetrical two by two design . 301350_305440
and so did Kevin but the difference is Vanessa's is symmetrical . 305550_309750
one way . 309870_310280
there's one way you can fold hers . 310760_312290
she showed you that way first . 312590_314030
but with cabins there would actually be two ways he could fold his
it just has two lines of symmetry in hers . 319520_321640
has one line . 321690_322280
so there's still both symmetrical two by two design . 322480_324920
Jillian and Jenna your time for testing your ideas is all done . 325850_329870
now now you're listening to other people share what they found
okay . 333370_333590
what'd you find out . 333610_334360
Sarah . 334540_334670
&-um that symmetrical . 335470_337410
okay . 355150_355320
and then with your finger can you just show those lines of symmetry
what_about a diagonal line of symmetry . 361200_363290
no one's showed us one of those yet today . 363380_364910
okay . 375870_376110
no you're right because_of those yellow triangles . 376220_378670
can't they didn't line up . 379170_380340
good job . 380970_381310
Sarah thank you . 381580_382580
okay . 383290_383500
guys and ladies before . 383830_384840
&-um Amanda shows us what she thought you know what Amanda I think
it was when you when we moved into the circle I think your design
you put that back together . 394910_395780
counsel ladies . 396120_396500
your fingers &-um enhanced should be in your lap . 396550_398710
Brian you don't have any more time left to test your course grades
I need your eyes and your ears on Amanda okay . 402760_406560
thank you so much . 408890_409860
okay . 410270_410450
Amanda did you start with a four square that was symmetrical or not
not symmetrical . 414840_415470
not symmetrical . 415820_416480
and what were you able to do . 416690_417550
I was able to go like this . 418400_419910
and . 420010_420110
can she do it that way . 439260_440290
I can do it like this . 440640_441490
can you . 441900_442220
no . 442660_442770
I can do it . 443360_443750
can you add exactly one way . 444820_449590
but is it a symmetrical two by two . 450130_451710
design . 451760_451950
yes . 452340_452370
yes . 453060_453160
yes . 453540_453570
it just says one line of summary . 453780_455180
like Vanessa's there's one special way that someone would've to
can you show (th)em with your finger again where that line is . 459610_461670
yep . 463460_463580
right there . 463600_464070
if you folded your design right there . 464140_465860
symmetrical . 466670_467150
&-um nope . 470260_471420
goes like . 471990_472470
this . 472520_472660
oh goes like this . 472780_474550
&-um Katie tell us what you began with . 475420_478270
I began with symmetrical . 479160_480380
a symmetrical horse . 481240_481990
and not symmetrical . 482500_483030
not symmetrical asymmetric it is . 483440_485600
you're right . 486040_486500
and what happened . 487410_488030
well I just fold it this way and symmetrical . 488390_492350
uhhuh . 492600_492700
and this way . 493180_495320
okay . 499150_499390
what_about &-um a diagonal . 500110_502020
&-um . 502540_502630
why does symmetry . 502820_503740
okay . 517419_517549
Brian and Alex were you able to make a two by two design . 518250_521330
no . 522340_522400
okay . 528270_528500
so they did have &-um they had asymmetric courseware . 528620_533240
they had a courseware that was not &-um not symmetrical . 534680_539300
but they only had three of them . 539340_540830
so the problem that Alex and Brian ran into I think they could
so it would be symmetrical . 555800_556940
can you give a that that would only be a way to like that . 558530_561350
symmetrical . 562630_563210
the other one . 564020_564540
Brian the people who are way back there can't see . 570170_573470
I'm just gonna move exactly what you have here to more into the
and then this one . 579450_580710
okay . 581150_581290
now what Brian's asking you to imagine is that he would put another
he would put another one there . 590270_591550
&-um just like this one . 592020_593790
right . 593950_594120
and that would be symmetrical . 594140_595190
it would be symmetrical right down there . 595460_597460
&-um Nathan were you looking at his course where . 598240_599820
