right . 78140_78291
so this is um moving_units@g . 78338_80671
okay so they are settlers right ? 80671_82204
<yeah> . 82204_82448
<that's> what you start with . 82204_83016
so you are just a band a tribe or something . 83005_84839
and basically what you've got to do is find somewhere to start
okay . 89602_89997
or something . 90156_90632
so u:h . 90678_91421
so what's the strategic <place> +. 91692_94420
<so> . 93305_93654
+, to build <a city> ?
<the best thing> usually is to start building a city
like <u:m> moving these settlers in ? 97497_100585
<uhm> . 97729_98356
uh so they are here now . 100642_102372
so you have to decide then if you want to explore a bit more and
or if you think that's a good place to build a city . 108179_109898
okay . 110246_110676
how do I explore <then> ? 110780_111825
<so> right . 111616_112115
well you can just use the the keys then to move left or right .
okay . 115559_115849
and then zoom in <somehow> ? 116116_117742
<ehm> you can't zoom in because this is the extend of your
ah ! 126790_127033
<so basically> and every time you move , every go that goes
so you got t:o (..) uh start building a city as quickly as
<okay> . 138193_138553
so how do I do that ? 138692_139447
s:o . 139610_140065
<what so> do you wanna build city there ? 140065_142582
<yea:h> . 142582_142954
<okay> . 143591_143880
<near water> .
<so then you can> . 143880_144690
if you click on orders@g . 144690_146380
then you can say build new city <for him> . 147675_149881
<okay> . 149486_149741
and you can give it a name or just leave it as that . 150728_152354
okay . 152951_153578
i'll call it um . 153555_155157
Wackaville . 158518_159551
okay &=laugh . 159330_159609
&=laugh . 160282_161617
u:h . 162569_163812
<xxx> . 164299_165925
<right> . 165135_165263
so that's basically +//. 165274_165948
so you can decide then what your city does . 166424_169024
what it produces and stuff like tha(t) . 169125_171029
so (i)f you click ok@g . 171134_172841
okay . 173943_174269
right . 174327_174524
so at the moment <it's uh> they are producing some defence
<m hm> . 179556_179963
<a little soldier> guy . 179557_180450
so you can decide you want to build a soldier, some defense, or you
if you click change@g . 185070_185906
m hm . 186005_186330
this shows all the things that you can construct . 186951_188983
so if you (..) go for settlers that means that you will produce
or you can produce warriors to go and attack people . 195683_198028
or uh barracks, you know, to defend yourself . 198609_201430
<okay> . 202354_202610
or you can start building something like the Colossus, which is
but uh +... 210937_211390
<okay> . 211993_212388
<as> +/. 212028_212283
s:o can settlers disagree and like become rival fractions <or>
uhm <if they> if they become dissatisfied with your governing
&=laugh . 224153_224733
but uh generally , i+mean , cities is what you want . 224797_227421
you want as many cities as possible . 227421_228942
<alright> . 229240_229983
