we have to use every minute of it to work too . 3520_5880
because by tomorrow by the time you leave which is early two hours
okay . 16470_16600
plus we have some nutcracker things that need to get done .
Sarah and Katie I need you to listen . 19150_20770
I'd like you to hand me your stuff now 'cause I'm gonna use this
and then I'm gonna give you as much time as I can for you to work .
so I'd like &-um by eight thirty how many minutes does that mean .
I'd like to take four it's eight twenty five now . 36080_38520
well let's say it's eight <five five> five . 38580_40970
okay . 41450_41640
maybe it is getting closer to eight twenty six . 41660_43730
Brittany you're right . 44060_44530
I would like to just use four or five minutes for directions and
and then give you the whole next hour or so for work time . 49220_52780
so we could actually get some things accomplished on our strip
okay . 56530_56690
by the end of tomorrow all nine of them should be finished all the
okay . 64330_64489
so you and your partner need to really use your time . 64959_68050
well let's look at &-um the steps over on the the whiteboard to
Katie and Sarah you may not talk . 80190_82250
you may not this is true . 83000_85720
important . 85740_86120
okay . 86930_87090
guys always the first step was to make your six core squares your
you and your partner designed a core square together . 92910_94800
and then you made six two-sided core squares . 95780_99330
making sure that that top left corner on the front . 99680_104640
side but not the flip side was marked so that we could check to see
they all match exactly . 114130_114960
and they all have a front side and a flip side color . 115080_118060
&-um Alex and Kevin do you have that step complete yet . 118960_121730
well I have all six of yours ready . 123030_124360
but does does your group have your pair have all six ready . 124480_127570
Alex says . 127730_127970
but I have my but does your pair have all six ready . 128080_130720
no that means you and Alex really need to get going . 131880_134480
okay . 135420_135560
so you need to help him finish his because it doesn't they're not
you can't do anything without them all six being finished . 141500_144220
so it doesn't matter if your three are finished or not . 144340_146390
it matters if all six are finished . 146550_148030
and if they're not that means you and Alex really need to work
then after you have your six done then you can &-um design the
there are more than four different ways you could arrange your six
but you just four but you have to find at_least four . 164360_166580
and you don't just lay (th)em out on the carpet . 167370_168540
and then switch to another strip . 168660_170020
and then switch to another . 170100_171020
you on graph tape . 171360_172030
another strip . 172250_172820
right . 172890_173030
we need a record of the strips that you were thinking about . 173140_176100
and on the graph paper . 177870_178980
that's exactly what you do . 179100_180670
you record how the strips look . 181730_184100
so here you can see . 184210_185180
Sarah and Katie got way ahead on the first page . 185400_187180
so they actually showed five . 187200_188350
you can still see four left on their graph paper is each strip . 188590_192300
they recorded different . 192320_193340
mhm . 193580_193790
okay . 194730_194820
they found a different way each time . 194880_196370
yep . 196620_196780
they are hopefully you can see that . 197170_199860
oh there it's just that one mark there . 200700_202100
okay . 202470_202700
so and this one is series . 202740_204140
it doesn't have her name on the . 204180_205110
it would be really good idea to put your name on your graph paper
but &-um we'll know who this one is . 208900_210460
'cause it matches Katie so they designed five strips . 211010_212910
you have to design four different ones and record (th)em on graph
then the next step is to pick your favorite . 217750_220500
they did that already . 220890_221900
and cut it out your favorite that you and your partner agree on . 222600_226110
now Alex will you be able to pick a different favorite one than
today I'm gonna make a whole quilt make a whole quilt . 238080_240900
and if Alex picked a different strip than Kevin would they be able
no . 246210_246380
so Kevin and Alex and everybody else's working together Jillian and
'cause they all have to cut out the same one . 259959_261769
once you've cut out that strip you know you're gonna use it to make
so this is the one that they decided on . 268150_269570
but they had to color the flip side of it too . 269730_272570
the one you cut out you have to color the flip side also so that
I'm looking for Katie's two-sided strip . 280050_282090
and here it is . 282370_283060
okay . 283730_283850
so they each had the same strip that they had chosen . 283870_287570
okay . 289170_289260
now <but it's> but it's the same arrangement of shapes and
and then they each had to color the flip side . 292930_295100
they couldn't help the tools because this will . 296170_297930
yeah this will help them plan their quilt together . 298860_301730
these strips will allow them to plan the entire quilt design . 302300_305450
and what they have decided on is they tried putting (th)em together
I need to check a course where to see . 311670_313580
okay . 314410_314530
which way . 315980_316590
&-um hmm . 316830_319590
which way does your strip begin . 320690_322430
ladies like this or like . 322450_324670
no get it begin the other way . 325400_327820
they both have to begin the same way though . 328530_330750
is it like this &-um way way as before it . 331200_335510
no that wasn't the same way as before . 335940_337260
this is the way I showed you before . 337280_338430
and this is this way is different which is the beginning way for
actually I know which way it is because your first one is but no .
but that's not your original strip . 348560_350060
sit down . 351450_351740
that's the flip of your strip . 351760_353060
I remember it . 353280_353820
now their their pattern for their finished quilt is . 353840_356660
&-um flip strip and then the strip . 356700_360580
so their original strip is like this . 360820_363030
they should have that mark so they could remember the top left
and they they just didn't do that yet . 367300_369260
but they have their whole quilt plan . 369280_370620
they found out that that by taking a flip of their strip and
but that got them a design that they liked . 380260_382190
it's hard to see how the design goes together . 382680_384350
flip the bottom way . 387350_389280
no you mean like this . 390100_391580
yeah that's turn it that way . 392620_393990
yep . 394700_394830
okay .
'cause then the diamonds and the rectangles line up and the way you
so what they did they kept trying these two strips out until they
and they planned their whole quilt . 404090_405630
then so their pattern for their quilt is a flip of <their strip>
there's a copy of their strip a flip of their strip and a copy of
okay . 419930_420030
which is sort of lots_of times . 420280_421250
the video started copying the strip . 421340_423220
and then then did a flip the design . 423320_425340
they liked . 425390_425990
the first strip in their quilt is a flip of the strip . 426790_429770
they began with their favorite strip that they cut out . 429840_432380
they started by flipping that in the first copy they didn't you
oh so they can just keep on copying it . 442390_444080
but you but you've gotta try it with your partners by flipping it
and see how they look and see what kind of designs happened . 447660_449590
do you think Sarah and Katie's quilt would've looked the same if
each time no it wouldn't have they wouldn't have got this kind of
what they like is where the top strip meets the second strip by
they got a different kind of design . 465070_466970
here they let the orange ones put together to make orange . 466990_469220
you have to we halfway . 469410_471150
no you have to try it different ways and decide which way makes the
you only color down the way you finally decide on . 478610_480940
they did some experimenting with their strips . 481310_483320
first they saw that . 483730_485500
&-um so I have to get a copy of their strip back down . 486290_489770
this is how their strip begins . 489790_491380
like this . 492790_493180
this is what kind of pattern they would get if they just copied
okay . 498980_499070
and you can see for some of you're going . 499270_500530
that's the same . 500590_501180
but it's not because instead_of getting a blue rectangle next_to an
they still get blue diamonds from four blue triangles going
but this part is different . 518450_519400
and they decided they liked it better like that like this where the
and the orange matches up with the orange every time going across
they could have designed a quilt that was a copy each time . 531700_536540
or they could have done copy copy and then a flip under that
and then copy copy flip that could have done what what they
they could have been flip flip copy flip flip copy they
have done any combination that they decided on use their two strips
could they just look at one strip . 563620_565980
and imagine what a whole qui . 566620_567420
