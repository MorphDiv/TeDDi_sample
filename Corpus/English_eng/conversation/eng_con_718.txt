&~www .
one day I found a frog .
and I kept it in a jar .
and then that night I fell asleep .
and somehow the frog got out .
I woke up the next morning and the jar was empty .
I was looking for him all over my room .
and I made it a mess .
I opened my window and shouted out .
and the dog's head was in the jar .
<the dog> my dog fell out the window .
so I hadta go and pick him up .
I went down to the woods .
and ca(lled) I was calling for him .
then I shouted down a hole .
and an animal came out .
I climbed <up t(o)> up a tree to see if it was in there .
then an owl jumped out .
and I fell off .
and the dog was being chased by a couple of bees .
the owl was flying over .
and I was climbing up a rock .
I climbed up to the top and was shouting the frog .
I climbed onto a deer .
and the deer was chasing after the dog .
I fell off the deer and landed in the river .
an(d) I saw a log and looked over it .
an(d) I found two frogs .
and then loads of baby ones came out .
so I took one home and said goodbye to all the others .
