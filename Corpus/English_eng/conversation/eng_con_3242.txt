that's what I'm doing, I'm just not writing I'm just not writing it out with the times . 0_31840
I'm doing the times in my head . 31840_33131
can you make sure that you are xxx good person ? 33131_43006
yes . 43006_43580
finish question one and two . 43580_72805
it's about seven questions . 72805_87485
it will take you that long to do if you're quiet . 87485_90408
do we have to write out the question Miss ? 90408_98535
no . 98535_99913
do we do every every question ? 99913_102278
in fact, I would excuse you from writing the story in question one, if if you wanted to just say, divide sixty in the ratio of five to three, you could just write it as a ratio . 102278_115543
the way I've used here . 115543_119406
you could just write, five to three equals I would do your working . 119406_123813
no . 123813_130014
that's I don't want you to write five to three is sixty . 130014_132661
you've really got to write eight shares in sixty . 132661_135803
all right ? 135803_137045
because five to three is two separate numbers, so it can't equal one number . 137045_142293
the five share would be ten . 142293_152763
and the three share would be ? 152763_154656
right . 154656_155418
six . 155418_156888
that's the radio . 156888_160736
this one's ten to six . 160736_162073
Chris +... 162073_168628
is not well . 168628_169820
he was away yesterday, too, wasn't he ? 169820_173178

me . 196106_197113
yeah, I told her you xxx . 197113_201835
don't encourage him . 201835_202528
go on, get on with your work . 202528_203651
because we were going to do Smarties with the other stuff, so I thought, well I got them, I might as well use them . 203651_234936
finished ? 234936_255710
xxx . 255710_257988
he has three . 257988_270213
I'm handing around a sheet for the next activity . 270213_280601
should you work fast enough and well enough to get there . 280601_283340
otherwise, I might take the Smarties . 283340_286970
on the back of it the back of it is not important . 286970_296100
it's using up scrap paper . 296100_298745
instead of slash we use dot dot . 298745_331233
oh, he told me to use the slash xxx . 331233_333018
oh, dot dot was right . 333018_335913
let's say you move back a little bit so, you're out of reach . 335913_339246
xxx so you don't xxx ? 339246_340640
yes, that's right . 340640_349791
that's right . 349791_350303
I'd have to do xxx . 350303_352431
and ? 352431_353006
and no xxx . 353006_355448
four of them . 355448_355950
four of them . 355950_356863
which question is it ? 356863_366621
four twenty +... 366621_367486
divide four hundred and twenty in the ratio of seven to one . 367486_370591
okay . 370591_370918
so how many lots do you have ? 370918_372943
four . 372943_373508
so what's in one lot ? 373508_377028
one share ? 377028_377951
thirty four . 377951_380003
how did you work that out ? 380003_381898
four twenty divided by twelve . 381898_384490
thirty five . 384490_384786
four twenty divided by twelve ? 384786_386040
okay . 386040_387425
so, you've written down twelve shares equals four hundred and twenty . 387425_392090
one share equals thirty five, so then you'd have to just do seven times thirty five and five times thirty five . 392090_399513
three forty five xxx . 399513_403905
they got the answer . 403905_410056
you right now then ? 410056_410530
yeah . 410530_410976
xxx how come you have to get that microphone xxx . 410976_418656
so they can listen to me talking to you . 418656_420745
so they can't hear us but they can hear you . 420745_422418
probably . 422418_423561
yes . 423561_424431
how can I use this to bribe my mom to get me some Smarties ? 424431_455848
okay, there's only ten or so minutes to go . 455848_461213
so what you can do is finish question one and two for homework . 461213_467171
we'll do question three next class . 467171_469893
you can start on the Smarties sheet and that can be completed for homework as well . 469893_479148
all right ? 479148_479873
I'll need I'll need a few +... 479873_487483
