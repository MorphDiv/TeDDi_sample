+, in common not even the spectrometer . 213825_215105
so so then the question is what are the capabilities of the new thing ? 215825_220125
so for example how far out in the IR can it go ? 220365_222845
how far out in the UV can it go ? 223065_224645
&-uh the what I told (th)em we wanted &-um is it's gonna be thirty fifty to ten fifty nanometers all at once . 225485_232165

you can't he said you can go below three fifty but it's gonna hafta be a different grating than this one . 242545_248145

⌈ &-uh: mm ⌉ if it's only the grating then I'm not worried at all because we can always replace the grating . 251245_255625

and he said he didn't know . 275985_276645
+, okay . 277245_277325

right so I'll ask on that . 285725_287125
&-um and it's gonna have point six nanometer resolution all the way across get C and c@l plus plus digital library drivers for it +/. 287605_297245

it's slit or fiber coupling and I need to talk to the guy on Monday about &-uh the xxx issues . 316085_323505

should I do that ? 396915_397475
you should only do that if you're trying to solve some problem . 398235_402515
if ⌊ you're happy with ⌋ . 403535_404315
⌈ it would make the ⌉ focal length I mean focal size smaller . 404315_406535

I'm I'm concerned that you'll run into some problem that you don't have now if you make the focal length too short . 413965_419785
I mean &~th you know ideally you want the focal length very short so you can make the interaction volume small . 420125_424145
mhm +/.
+, but you don't have any problem running down the counts right now . 425445_429205
if you have a higher efficiency detector you would you run into a problem ? 429385_433065
or . 433225_433285
yes I think I have a_lot_of atoms in the focal volume right now . 433905_437985
what if you filled the whole mirror which you can't do right now but will be able to do in the new chain setup ? 438745_442725
if you fill the whole mirror you'll get a tighter focus even with +//. 443345_445645
⌊ you know what I mean ⌋ ?
⌈ yeah that would ⌉ I &~s I think that would increase my diameter almost a factor of two . 445765_450605
okay . 451165_451885
so that'll cut down your area &~wha so to one quarter +/. 452445_455425
yeah +/. 456265_456285

⌊ <which would> which would ⌋ . 457845_458525
⌈ &~s so maybe ⌉ maybe I don't have any problem . 458545_459665
yeah . 459845_460005
so that's what I'm a little concerned about that because you you know you kind_of limit your your range on the other end . 460545_465925
⌊ if you have a xxx yeah you were remember ⌋ . 466145_468005
⌈ if I change right ⌉ cut focal length shorter ?
remember when we were first doing when we you know the first &~ste thing we were doing with the high order electrons that you worked on for years remember ? 468825_475105
&=laughs .
oh yeah those . 475625_476365
so the big problem there was we could somehow never get the intensity low enough to get into the right regime it was always too high . 476845_483365
and that's why we couldn't use that mirror . 483485_484725
ultimately we never did use it . 484925_486205
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ we used the ⌉ external focusing . 486305_488185
yeah and and I guess for that for Mark's trying to get enough atoms to see anything . 489835_495975
you need a larger he needed ⌊ a larger volume ⌋ . 497355_498535
⌈ he that he ⌉ needed more atoms in the focal volume . 498535_500335
yeah .
so so there's there's that kind of tradeoff so I unless unless you're &~re there's really a problem that you're up against ⌊ I'd keep it the same ⌋ . 501395_508135
⌈ I don't think ⌉ there is . 508155_508655
I'm I'm keeping the focal width the same . 508775_510315
my only other question +... 512075_512915
do I need special BNC connectors to go inside a high vacuum environment ? 514855_518975
mhm .
and where do I get them from ? 519555_521755
BNC you say . 522035_522975
&=laughs well we usually +//. 524035_524655
hm .
where is this for ? 525315_526195
&-um connecting conical anodes to the outside . 527115_531595
(be)cause ⌊ I &~ga ⌋ . 532955_533235
⌈ that's done ⌉ with take a look at how it's done now . 533415_535755
it's now done with a &-uh general radio connector . 535915_539915
⌊ well actually there's a combination ⌋ . 541615_542455
⌈ see there're there're ⌉ two types of &~cone connectors +/. 542445_543725
⌊ but it's ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ there's ⌉ the conical anode the &-um forty millimeter one that I'm looking at has a BNT coming off the back . 544105_551905
the thing that I took off of your chamber has that androgynous I'm not sure what type of ⌊ thing it is &~a ⌋ . 552745_558685
⌈ right &~h hermaphrodite ⌉ &=laughs no the the &-uh hermaphrodite connector is a kind of general radio connector . 558705_565645
okay . 565905_566105
+, the other kind of connector which is also called a general radio connector &-uh &~i which is sort_of like a type N connector if you know what that is . 566345_575345
&-um we hadta change . 575645_579885
so okay so this is what I was getting at . 580145_582025
if you look inside that connector or inside a BNC connector you'll see that there's plastic (be)cause after all it's dielectric there's gotta be plastic somewhere . 582345_588385
the most important thing is that that plastic hasta be able to &~s withstand &-uh say two hundred and fifty degrees C . 588945_596405
so that it will melt &=laughs &=laughs:S8 and burn and cause a big smoke in your chamber as soon as you xxx right ? 596805_600745
if you just take them off the shelf they they have a kind of plastic that won't take the high temperatures . 601285_607565
and so what we did was we we bought the &~ki those kinds of connectors particularly that the the hermaphrodite one +/. 608065_614325
+, mhm +/.
+, that kind of connector we specifically are using that because we can get at the plastic and pull it out and replace it with Teflon . 614915_621575
+, mkay .
+, and &-uh you know you've got that already . 622955_625035
so I would just use the same thing we don't hafta do that twice . 625315_627415
except that at this point the anode has a BNC connector on it and there might be one other hermaphrodite connector is buried before the BNC connector but I can't get that part open so I'm not convinced that it actually does open . 628635_641675
I really worry if you're using BNC <that you> that you have to make sure that you can bake it . 643325_647485
it might be possible . 647645_648625

we'd still have the multipass at ten hertz . 918985_922185

the Clark is a pain because it's it's somewhat unstable . 930225_933345

I don't think we'll ever replace the back end the high energy end . 1305835_1309515

&-uh the the &-uh sort_of gradual transition that we're making to a kilohertz is going to mean that a_lot_of our important experiments particularly the atomic beam experiments will be sort_of designed to work at a kilohertz . 1424315_1436135

&~i I I'm more looking at just a general upgrade you really don't want laser equipment to be twenty years old in in <in a> in a lab . 1447605_1453885

+, mhm +/.
+, and &-uh so that means that you have to budget these things and so we're budgeting this upgrade and and and now we have to do it . 1462145_1469065

⌈ right ⌉ . 1473025_1473285
I I guess but there's the issue of which order do you do it in ? 1473445_1475785
⌊ <which is the oscillator> ⌋ .
⌈ &-um based on ⌉ based on this discussion I'm I'm I'm leaning towards replacing the oscillator first because it seems like everybody's had some trouble with the oscillator . 1476385_1483845

&-uh huh +/.

<that's why> I just picked that up from the abstract so &=laughs . 1520685_1522165
I just know the title which is the world in eleven dimensions . 1522165_1524065
&=laughs:multiple .
so so before we have to break up for that I really wanted to to have you guys describe this cost functional . 1524365_1530165
do you wanna do it ? 1531695_1532315
sure . 1532555_1532895
okay .
&-um so I guess the idea is that we'll we run the GA to optimize some pulse shape or to optimize some feedback . 1533815_1541195
and &-uh and we get different different shapes you know &~di different runs of the GA you you know conversion of different shapes and and especially when you look at like a &~m a minimization where it spreads the pulse out . 1542175_1555775
and &-uh and the &~sh the shapes that you end up with are sort_of &-uh qualitatively similar . 1556215_1561695
but you couldn't you can't really &-uh tell just by looking at (th)em what what's doing what . 1561955_1566395
and and so the idea is that well maybe there's just a few things in that pulse shape that that are actually you know that're actually controlling the &-uh the liquid but the rest of that stuff is just &~i it doesn't matter . 1566955_1581695
but +/.
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ the GA ⌉ just you know you just &-uh . 1582315_1584115
so &~no non non fatal family traits . 1584055_1586275
right +/.
+, but they're not really ⌊ important ⌋ . 1586815_1588175
⌈ mhm ⌉ .
and so the deal is that well maybe we can find a way to to sort_of filter all that stuff out &-uh so that all we're left with is the important stuff . 1588595_1596495
and so the cost functional &-uh compares the pulse shape that we have to a transform limited pulse and <it punishes> it punishes the pulse shapes for how much they differ from the transform limited pulse shapes . 1597115_1611375
so the idea is that you start off with a transform limited pulse and then you shape it . 1611985_1617485
and and &-uh and the ones that you . 1618765_1621685
so the ones that &~d how do you +/. 1622665_1624185
⌊ so ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ how do ⌉ you evaluate how far you are from transform limited ? 1624385_1626825
well that's that's the trick +/. 1627045_1628825
okay +/.
+, that we've &~b that's what the cost functional is . 1629165_1630405
but basically <if you> if you have two pulse shapes that that &-uh that do the same thing that you get the same fitness out_of and one looks like a transform limited pulse with a few modifications and one looks completely different the one that looks completely different will be punished and the one that &~th looks more like the transform limited won't so the one that looks like the transform limited pulse will get a much better fitness for it . 1630405_1652345
and +/.
+, I think +//.
⌊ that's like ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ ?
+, that's kind_of +/.
+, sure . 1655025_1655665
and so I guess we can just look at +//. 1655965_1657505
so this is the formula that Tom sent basically &=writes:board:S3 &-uh what he's using and so what we do is &-uh we compare +//. 1657625_1666045
so the gene string is <just the> &-uh just the phase at each each pixel and we compare pixel by pixel to what the phase would be for the transform limited pulse and &-uh and so we add up all those differences and that's actually squared right ? 1667065_1682025
that's just the &-uh . 1682265_1683585
oh it's either squared or +/. 1683765_1684805

⌈ sure and that's ⌉ I mean we've talked about that a_lot too . 1708125_1710285
&-um . 1711185_1711625

+, Tom I think &~To this is what Tom uses I'm pretty sure . 1713105_1715845
+, ⌊ really ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ and ⌉ <I think> I think their issue is that they're just program voltages on the pixels and they don't have these I think I &~m I would also guess the the operators tend not to put in the linear sweep . 1716305_1728105
and you know some of our times some of +//. 1728585_1729985
sometimes we get these straight linear phases and I think they I don't think they do and so I don't think it's much of an issue . 1730125_1735685
so we asked Tom and he's like oh it really hasn't been a problem . 1735785_1738445
yeah &=background_conversation .
yeah if you if I understand &~tha that your resolution was <just &-uh> just &-uh extending the pulses to get some some kind of minimum minimization right ? 1739785_1747765
and two ways of doing it one &~w way is just &~le linearly choking it to make the pulse longer and also same way the the the clipping of bandwidth is then making the same <curve shaped> pulses plus the long pauses . 1748025_1760345
<this is> this is for &~t only looking at the phases . 1760965_1764065
&~o &~o this is only +//. 1765265_1766225
so . 1766505_1769605
then how would you maintain the Gaussian pulse &~on only xxx the phase +/. 1766865_1770085
+, ⌈ things ⌉ without clipping out those . 1770905_1772245
&-uh we don't look at the amplitudes at all here . 1772605_1774025
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so this ⌉ is this is phase only shaping ? 1774885_1776465
&-um I guess I don't understand what you're asking . 1777365_1780545
I mean the +//.
how do you maintain the Gaussian shape without &~cl and and and extending the pulse width ⌊ without changing the frequency ⌋ ? 1780565_1789025
⌈ the &~pul the pulse ⌉ &-um the &~pul the &~pul it's arbitrary phase shaping so the pulse is not gonna be Gaussian any more . 1789805_1793965
so &~th . 1795815_1796055
when you +//. 1796275_1796775
so .
you're you're asking about the transform limited pulse that you compare things to ? 1798195_1801455
I thought I mean probably I misunderstood but you wanted to maintain the transform limited pulse Gaussian pulse ? 1801975_1808075
no no they don't want to maintain it . 1808535_1811155
they simply want to &-um get rid of extraneous garbage and their their hypothesis about the extraneous garbage which I guess is something you didn't state but their hypothesis about how how to differentiate garbage you don't want from stuff that you might want is by looking at the deviation of the phase from the phase that you'd get for transform limited pulse . 1811465_1837965
so of_course the the there there's a bunch of problems with that that all come to mind I &~me in a kind_of a jumble . 1838935_1846035
one is the one we just talked about that a Gaussian pulse in a different place doesn't have zero phase and so you have to worry about that . 1846395_1853415
but &-uh &~an another one is that you know consider a solution which is a beautiful looking solution just from a kind of aesthetic point of view of two Gaussian pulses displaced from one another in time . 1853975_1865975
so it's just like a pump probe thing you're driving a wave packet and the best solution is you just drive it once drive it again . 1866335_1871895
okay ? 1872675_1872695
there's gonna be a heavy cost here for that pulse even though that's a perfectly good wonderful solution so &~i it seems like &~th the lack of sophistication in evaluating cost functional could really be hurting you in some cases . 1873095_1884635
oh .
&-um yeah ? 1885275_1885755
&~w would you run everything with cost functional or would you like run +/. 1885975_1888975
⌊ it was I think ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ it and see what it gave ⌉ you and then just like try it with cost functional . 1889135_1890935
it's designed to be a general tool for <any of> any of the experiments in any form . 1891665_1895705
so basically it you know we can run some experiments and then we can also try (th)em with the cost functional and we can try (th)em with different weights on the cost functional . 1895985_1902045
mhm +/.
+, and you just it just goes into the fitness like on the bottom . 1902665_1904665
so the new fitness is just the original fitness times like one plus the cost . 1905425_1909065
and we we adjust the weighting such that you know the cost is somewhere between zero and one basically . 1909425_1915325
+, yeah ⌊ mkay ⌋ +/. 1915925_1916445
+, ⌈ and ⌉ &-uh and so you know . 1916445_1919165
so so &~thi this is an alternative to something that was what you guys tried sometimes in the past which is having a smoothing operator that would that you could just evaluate whether it was a good thing or not (be)cause of whether it increased the fitness but the smoothing operator would get rid of extraneous high frequency stuff &~hi phase noise for example mostly +/. 1919535_1941595
mhm +/.
+, mostly that's what it got rid of . 1942235_1943075
that's right it gets rid of the ⌊ phase noise ⌋ . 1943235_1945915
⌈ so you could just ⌉ damp out out phase noise by having the children always have less phase noise than the parents in the GA and the the trouble is that &~i &~i &~i because that doesn't that's not a cost functional approach . 1943755_1955895
that isn't just +//. 1956395_1957055
that that's a &-uh in in a sense it's &-um it's not allowing &-uh rapid phase variations that might be very helpful from making their importance understood . 1957625_1971945
putting it into a cost functional means that it'll cost a little more but if it makes things that much better you still do it . 1972905_1978805
smoothing it means you get rid of it whether it was good for you or not . 1979325_1982725
so +/. 1983785_1984285
+, maybe this is better . 1985085_1985845
alright so the basic idea is that you know &~de depending on what the weighting is we're gonna tell it how strong it should punish anything that deviates from an unshaped pulse . 1986885_1995545
and if if &-uh something that deviates drastically has a much better fitness that'll outweigh the cost . 1996065_2001385
&-um so . 2001825_2003165
and that's the trick to adjust the weighting I guess so &-um you know you you like you know you like the the weighting factor to be set so that if you do have a &~r a very good pulse shape but it doesn't look anything like a transform limited pulse that'll still be the pulse that you end up with I guess . 2003415_2022795
unless +/. 2023455_2023495
⌊ right ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ you have ⌉ really really high weighting on the cost function in which case ⌊ <it's a> <it's a> it's a different matter ⌋ . 2023755_2033395
⌈ right .
well <if you> if you crank ⌉ up W high enough then supposedly you should always get a transform limited pulse . 2026475_2032555
⌊ okay yeah ⌋ +/. 2033475_2034035
+, ⌈ right ⌉ ?
because it'll like whatever your &~pul your pulse shape is &-uh that that'll just get it'll &~t totally drown it out so like whatever the &~actua the sum of the the ⌊ phases ⌋ . 2034675_2044775
yeah +/.
so +/. 2045415_2045735
+, okay .
so Tom has then used this &-um and and Jilla and they he's had some good success with it . 2046015_2050835
basically he had a data analysis that involved <looking at> &-um looking at the nominater frequency spectrum basically looking at I guess you know kinda frequency differences in these Rotmann experiments and &-um and whether you get these or whether they're present in the beam or not and and ⌈ I mean ⌉ . 2051025_2069445
⌊ I'm ⌋ just afraid that the &~f . 2069545_2070205
the analysis was cleaned up . 2070705_2071825
⌈ the +//.
basically the analysis was cleaned up a_lot by using the cost functional ⌉ . 2071985_2076865
⌊ yeah .
I I wouldn't wanna ⌋ I wouldn't wanna &~s say this &~t because it criticizes you know &-uh too too &-uh too strongly because it criticizes his paper . 2074395_2083895
but I have a feeling that the cost functional in Tom's case is kind_of a self-fulfilling prophecy . 2084495_2091495
I mean he says is the cost functional a good thing ? 2091795_2093475
well the cost functional is a good thing because it produces the solutions that your preconception about what a good solution is &=laughs +/. 2093895_2101335
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you know ⌋ what what you wanted . 2102535_2103955
&-uh &~b but it's it's not it's it's going away from the &-uh real notion of the GA as a learning machine where it's finding for you the best solution independent of your preconceptions . 2104975_2117475
(be)cause it's kind_of introducing a preconception bias . 2118295_2120655
and in this case it really came out with Tom because his preconception bias was that he was looking for simple spectral signatures . 2121295_2127735
it was in the non linear spectrum but nonetheless he was looking for simple spectral signatures things that could be easily wiped out by phase noise . 2127935_2133775
and so he had something in there that would make all of the solutions not have much phase noise and by golly he could see his simple spectral signatures it doesn't really mean that that's the best solution . 2134575_2143435
well we've also yet to craft a GA that that &~ha eliminates nonfatal mutations too . 2144655_2151475
so . 2151895_2151975
yeah we don't have a better way to eliminate nonfatal mutations &~a apart from just going in &-uh to the +//. 2152755_2160675
looking at a solution and just feature by feature modifying it just &~l you know that's +//. 2161095_2167595
course that also defeats the purpose of the GA you're not optimizing things &-uh you're not letting it optimize things for you if you can do that . 2168435_2176195
yeah &~i &~i it gets into a validation issue really and &-um and &~i I've seen the same thing in medical imaging with iterative &~r approaches how much side information can you stick in the &~e the image &~pr process without biasing the image you end up with ? 2178635_2194175
right +/. 2194335_2194515
+, &-um and so I mean for a particular problem I think it makes a_lot_of sense to you know use a cost functional and then maybe compare it to a non cost &~f cost functional approach and make sure there's some kind of convergence +/. 2194785_2209165
+, mhm +/.
+, going on but as a general rule you're not necessarily gonna be able to do that it you if you work with a system that you don't know much about you know and where you said maybe something that looks like a series of pulses might be the best solution . 2209805_2220965
+, mhm +/.
+, you know a_priori there's no reason to say oh the Gaussian is the best or the transform limited is the model we should use . 2222195_2228415
I mean as long as we're able to run them back to back I think we can avoid those sort_of problems just because you can run it without and you can run it with and you can compare what the pulse shapes look like +/. 2228995_2236875
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and you can also ⌋ compare what the best fitness was and if if you seriously degrade the fitness in_order_to change the pulse shape then you know you're you're in trouble . 2236955_2244255
but .
the reason I I guess it seems like if you get a pulse shape without the cost functional that looks nothing like the Gaussian that's huh ⌈ so so I I if you get one ⌉ . 2245955_2257855
⌊ but but there's there's always a chance ⌋ that you could have just as good a fitness with something that looks much more &-uh smooth +... 2257855_2263875
there's always a chance that . 2266315_2267335
and when you use the how much it looks like a Gaussian is that what's f@l zero . 2267915_2274375
f@l zero's like the original fitness . 2275455_2276815
without so the new +/. 2277755_2278835
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.

+, ⌊ what ⌋ its fitness is and then you add on this mathematical cost . 2280695_2283175
so the more cost there is the higher fitness it has ? 2283355_2285515
&-uh &~i the minus sign is I should put plus or minus . 2285775_2288955
yeah ⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 2289195_2289535
+, ⌊ the minus ⌋ sign depends on on what the sign of your fitness and your cost are . 2289535_2292695

⌈ so ⌉ +/. 2294295_2294535
+, ⌊ but ⌋ you're right +... 2294875_2295055
&-uh so if the fitness is positive and the cost is positive it should be a minus . 2298595_2301155
I I ⌈ guess it would be nice if we had a problem +//. 2301375_2302675
oh ⌉ .
⌊ so it seems like ⌋ it seems like the absolute number of the fitness of something with or without the cost functional would completely depend on how much weight you put on it . 2302695_2310055
mhm +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so ⌋ I'm not sure how you can compare something without . 2310855_2313535
like when you go through you get a pulse rate without the cost functional and it has a fitness of two point seven or whatever and I am not sure +/. 2314135_2323935
+, I mean +/. 2324275_2324435
+, how &~c how can you compare the two numbers you get for the fitness with the cost functional if it's not like it doesn't seem like it would be a comparable number scale so how can you say +/. 2324615_2332375

and so you know <you could> you could you know let's say you get a fitness of two point seven just just the fitness let's say you evaluate the pulse and you get two point seven . 2342855_2349895
and then let's say you evaluate you could evaluate another pulse shape that looks almost like a transform limit and you also might get two point six five or something . 2350255_2358415
