okay .
you feel &~th as though you're in a lab or +/. 4835_9575
⌈ yeah almost ⌉ +/.
+, &=laughs ⌊ it's a little ⌋ <a little bit> a little bit odd .
okay .
&-uh the reason I asked you to come in is that &~i I'm looking at the grades and I'm looking at at this paper and you're at the point where I don't want you to fall off the edge . 87755_88435
&-uh and and get a grade that's not gonna be supportive . 108315_108415
it seems to me that you know that you've been in touch with things in the class and that I I liked what you did with your poem to change it which wasn't +//. 108415_116275
which must have involved a fair amount of work . 116275_116495
+, <I don't know> +/.
+, to you know to get that in a different order and to get the system &~ba was it a_lot_of work ? 120505_133285
mm it wasn't too much it didn't take me too long to just use the same word I just I'd say the hardest part yeah was changing the sentences . 132625_150965
trying to make (th)em all fit again .
okay +/.
+, but it wasn't too bad .
okay .
but the rhythm seemed to work right and +/.
mhm +/.
+, it it really did come out to be a &~sus sestina and one of the effects of the sestina is that since you're using those words over and over again they they tend to acquire different meanings they tend to to just they sound different in different combinations +/. 177025_178925
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and ⌋ and they mean something .
but let's look at this +/.
+, ⌈ (o)kay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-um ⌋ because I think that that part of what's happening here <is that> is that you're using a_lot_of words where few words would work . 180365_187765
where you don't really need that that many words to say what you want to to say . 216165_220465
and there are some cases <where you're> where you're looking or where you seem to be saying something &-um and I think <I know what> I know what you want to say but because you've sort_of you've given me more than than I need you're really disguising the meaning +/. 220465_228505
+, ⌈ mkay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ rather ⌋ than bringing the meaning out . 284425_295085
so that if &~y if you look at this sentence and if you just &~r read that sentence aloud . 295205_295685
&{l=READING poetry is the best representation of the elegy for the fact that in times of mourning everyone needs <a way to> &~es a way to escape when the burden of loss becomes too huge to manage . 332185_332325
&}l=READING .
okay .
now <part of> part of what you need to do is to look back at the beginning of this and say &~w how are you using the word elegy ?
and how can poetry be a +/. 354285_355305
⌈ representation ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ representation ⌋ of the elegy ?
it we can talk about the feelings that are associated with an elegy or we can talk about mourning or we can talk about a lament for for the dead . 355705_384165
but by definition an elegy is +/.
+, ⌈ is a poetry form of poetry .
yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ a poetry <is a> is a &~p a form of poetry right ⌋ . 384165_384265
&-um and so &-um <what do you> what do you think you were trying to get at there ? 423585_449405
I was figuring I mean it's a form of it (be)cause I mean it represents it because it is I mean it's not a short story it's not a novel +/. 449165_456805
right +/.
+, it's poetry .
mkay but but again if by definition an elegy is a kind of poem then it can't then poetry can't be a +/. 477545_477625
⌈ representation ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ representation ⌋ of the elegy .
and if anything the the relationship goes the other way .
+, ⌈ elegy would be ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ where elegy ⌋ is a kind of poem .
&-uh and and and maybe so +//.
I think what's happened here is that you've got too much compressed for +//. 477625_477725
into this one sentence you're trying to say two or three different things and the the one sentence just won't do it . 493665_502745
the what what you're really looking for is the notion that the elegy <is a> is a form of poetry &-uh that's used in time of mourning because okay ? 543725_556825
<so that> so that instead of for the fact that something like since or because could could come in later in the sentence and <it would just> it would just clarify what you're trying to to get at there . 591425_621405
&-um .
mkay (0.7) and this had me confused I was fighting with that thing all night .
the semicolon right there ? 680785_682725
(be)cause I kind of felt like I was explaining . 682725_682825
oh okay where's that ?
⌈ <right there> right there . 733415_737915
yeah ⌉ +/. 737915_739715
+, ⌊ that's here ?
semicolon ?
yeah ⌋ .
but if <if you're> if you're using a mark of punctuation to say alright I'm making a statement and then I want to explain what's in in what follows I want to explain that statement the convention is to use a colon a full stop +/. 752925_770565
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ colon ⌋ and not a +/.
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ semicolon ⌋ .
what what this does this mark of punctuation &-um &~alm almost always says that what's here and what's there are equivalent sentence elements . 840855_847355
<that's a full sentence> that's a full sentence .
<that's a clause> that's a clause .
sometimes even smaller sentence elements could could come into play here .
but almost almost invariably that says this on this side this on that side are equivalent .
this signals okay I've made my formal statement now I'm gonna explain it a little bit I'm gonna clarify it for you . 904605_910145
so you &~ca and if you do that if you do a colon to say alright now what follows is an explanation this hasta be lower case . 926785_938305
it can't be +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, because that's always signalling the beginning of a new sentence .
<and it> and it's it's different .
&-um mkay do you understand (0.5) this this sentence that begins with while +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, do you understand why that's not a sentence ?
because the while would make it need more <kind of the> . 991585_993505
okay the &~wh the while makes it dependent . 993525_995385
yeah +/. 1041395_1042915
+, so it's got to come it's got to be attached to something else or the the suggestion of the while &-um the way it's pointing points back to this . 1045415_1049155
and so it can't start a sentence because it's not it's never going to be a complete sentence . 1049155_1049675
&-um (0.4) mkay here again there's a case where the words aren't aren't really necessary you've given us more words than we need so it's not a matter of people using the concept of poetry +/. 1049675_1056695
+, just poetry +/.
+, it's poetry .
you don't so you don't need that at all . 1086505_1087485
&-um .
xxx again huh ?
right .
now &~th that's perfectly alright .
because because what you've done is to make this dependent this part is is dependent and the comma here makes a difference but when you say while poems are used to release this pain they can also be used for paying respect to the dead . 1087485_1093105
&-um <you can> you can imagine some people work &-uh with the principle that's called sentence combining . 1093145_1095065
<when they want to> when they want to get students to learn how to to get variety into their language and into their sentences they do sentence combining which will give them the opportunity to reshape sentences almost endlessly . 1133545_1142785
and so you could reshape this one but <this is a> this is a fine sentence because you've you've said while this is true this is also true . 1170175_1180155
&-um that's that's not a difficult xxx (0.6) mkay and here of_course the respect paid through poetry for death does not only hafta be represented by +//. 1197075_1215595
you're really not talking about a representation you're talking about &-um &~f how it's focused on the the +//. 1221135_1251115
you're talking about the respect and it's not the respect that's being presented by the human form but addressed to &-um a human subject or focused on a human subject something something like that . 1269835_1289055
because <what you're> what you're moving then &~in from here you're moving into to grass and what Philip Larkin does with with that poem when he's talking about these two horses . 1289135_1289495
mhm +/.
+, so (0.36) what do you mean by that word ?
I means it's +/.
+, ⌈ sound ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &~n ⌋ oh okay okay .
it's not +//.
so you just mean it you just want it to mean sound ? 1291825_1308565
+, mhm +/.
+, okay .
and there I think <I would> I would take there out and say poets can use the sounds of the poem .
because <this is> this is a word that has a very different &-uh different meaning it &-uh sort_of like the the continuing sound or the +/. 1362305_1376925
+, mm +/.
+, the reverberations of the sound .
it's not the sound itself and you're really talking about just the sounds themselves . 1376925_1376965
<you could> you could say &-um +...
you could talk about the resonance of sounds in poetry the the the ways in in which they use &-um they aim for a resonant effect <something like> something like that . 1387975_1389715
&-um what about that one ?
I'm I'm really just calling attention here to to words that are whenever I &~s just say DIC I mean that's not the best word +/. 1422925_1433525
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ choice ⌋ .
so what do you think here you you meant ?
it's just &-um taken away not as much emphasized on if the reader could really make &-uh I mean if the writer could really make the reader feel what they saying . 1478835_1479135
okay &-uh can you think of another way of saying that ? 1479135_1479475
can you think of another word a single word that would do that ?
taken away by the writer's ability &~t . 1532405_1548005
okay taken away by +/. 1548005_1551345
⌈ maybe ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ perhaps ⌋ &-um .
mm hm ⌈ deemphasized ⌉ ?
⌊ can +//.
⌋ okay that's maybe the direction you need to to go in because again you've got one of these sentences that goes on too long for what it's saying . 1551345_1552065
and I think what what you mean &~t if if I were to rephrase this I would say something like <the rhyme> &~s the rhyme scheme or rhyme isn't a key to the elegy &-uh because the &~m any mood created by the rhyme scheme is secondary to is less important is secondary . 1573225_1585365
&-uh to to not the writer's ability to make the writer feel what it she is feeling but to the creation of feeling .
(be)cause &~i everything you're saying here can be summed up in <in that> in that phrase to the creation of feeling . 1636825_1647545
so you don't need all of that but so it's secondary to that . 1647545_1647785
that's the relationship to that . 1647885_1647925
&-um and here this is a just a a case there will be some times when you wouldn't use a comma here but you need it here just to to make the logic clear . 1647925_1648025
&-um but also you've got this introductory prepositional phrase with the use of line breakage and punctuation comma poets . 1676325_1695965
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ because ⌋ otherwise you're talking about punctuation poets .
+, okay +/.
+, right .
+, yeah +/.
+, so it's it's you want a separate +//.
you don't want anyone +//.
and there would be cases where depending on that word that would be even a more outlandish kind of of connection . 1748965_1749565
(0.23) probably here this is just a matter of &~n not wanting to be repetitious .
I mean you've already said for the reader so we don't need to say which gives the reader . 1749565_1750045
and and if there you can just cut that that phrase out altogether .
+, okay +/.
+, &-um (0.9) yeah I didn't understand what you meant by connotation . 1762405_1774645
&~wh what is the connotation for you of of the word grass here ? 1780345_1785925
mm because I I took it as +//. 1794045_1808425
I mean he was using just grass but it was mainly about horses and I figure horses eat the grass so +/. 1823165_1832605
mhm +/.
+, that musta been what he was talking about .
but but what do you mean by connotation +..?
+, ⌊ why why ⌋ is it +//.
I mean if if we ordinarily say &-um here is &-uh here's a direct meaning or an explicit meaning of &~th of the word . 1874145_1874505
&-um and we &~t we would talk about that &~a as denotation .
+, mhm +/.
+, and then the connotation of the word is something that that gives us other suggestions that brings in other kinds of of meanings . 1874525_1875145
so is that what you were thinking of there or were you thinking of something else ?
yeah I mean that's what I was thinking a implied meaning right ?
mhm +/.
+, almost almost +/.
+, ⌈ and and what are &~th ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but I mean ⌋ horses don't even eat grass do they ?
mhm +/.
okay +/.
+, they could .
but but what would you think of as +... 1875145_1875225
as the connotation there of of grass . 1896425_1902505
is &~i is it just &-uh +... 1902505_1908965
probably at at the title itself of of this means something like in retirement .
so that that I suppose you could argue that that grass here doesn't mean just that green stuff out there growing <in a> in a field but it's it's a symbol of the attitudes that we bring to retirement the kinds of feelings that are associated with not having pressure anymore . 1948465_1968125
hm ?
from grass ?
I didn't get that .
okay &=laughs:multiple okay but but it might be +/. 1975825_1989665
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ a ⌋ a part of of that . 1989665_1994705
did you get anything other than that out_of it ? 2014185_2017485
I mainly just got the animals eat the grass that's what I was thinking so +/. 2017485_2018165
okay +/.
+, I figured he was using the grass to to &-um just make you think about the animals . 2045805_2052585
okay .
okay .
and here where where you're talking about the simile and you see that as the major figure then I would then I would put the quotation in there and +/. 2052585_2061925
okay +/.
+, and do that right .
&-um here's a case where I think that that to begin with with that move into into the Housman poem it's a little too &-um +... 2087415_2096655
informal and casual for the rest of the writing &-um here . 2096655_2096755
&-uh that that maybe what you could do +//.
I mean here's another instance where you could use a while transition and say while in Larkin's poem this happens in To an Athlete Dying Young Housman uses mkay .
that that you wanna make a distinction and you need to to do that . 2123485_2135645
and again &-uh <you're using> you're using more words than you need to .
the poem is structured by seven four line stanzas with a rhyme scheme . 2168145_2179265
rather being represented by they're not really being represented by anything they're &~j they're just +/.
+, ⌈ there ⌉ &=laughs +/.
+, ⌊ there ⌋ .
you know <that's what> that's what he's &-uh using .
&-um probably wouldn't wouldn't use that word &-um to to talk about recognition &-uh maybe highly <would be> would be one that you could substitute for it . 2189085_2196145
just well recognized you could say everywhere recognized &-um by his town's people &-um and so on . 2196145_2198125
and here you're always +//.
I mean that's the part of the verb that you want that that's not may of been may have been is what you wanted +/.
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to use there ⌋ . 2201705_2207105
&-um (0.12) can you think of a way of of just &~s &-um how can I say this ? 2207105_2221045
of making that sentence a little more pointed ? 2242555_2242575
what what happens is that &~i it gets to be too long and it sort of runs out_of gas .
and and we need (0.4) and you also need to put this in the past tense . 2251125_2277865
&~ins have chose rather than choose .
mkay (0.8) xxx okay now do this then put the colon here and explain it ? 2305575_2316775
yeah that's fine .
I mean that that really does break that down otherwise it'd just +//.
so that <if you> if you put the colon in there and say this is what I mean by what I've just said . 2328305_2341865
it just sharpens it .
it gets you it seems like there's a point . 2393625_2398145
whereas the sentence that you had before just drags on .
and we can't really see <where the> where the point is is coming . 2398145_2398165
&-um (0.17) mkay and here again this is not a long sentence but once you see words falling one after another I mean <where you're> where you're getting two words that are the same in a single sentence and those they're not doing very much work . 2398165_2400245
⌈ mkay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I think ⌋ that you need to say alright this hasta be shortened . 2406825_2411845
so that this the reader is given a scenario and told to go with it .
what &-um what xxx do you need ? 2441365_2441445
right .
&-uh or he's given a scenario that doesn't require much in in the way of extensive analysis . 2508125_2516765
I mean &~jus get it that that short . 2516785_2518265
because that's the point that that you're making .
okay .
I think when I be trying to stretch the paper +/. 2545865_2548605
uhuh +/.
+, trying to make sure it's long enough +/.
+, oh okay +/.
+, that's when I really get too much stuff that I don't need . 2576945_2583485
&=laughs .
right right . 2612545_2612765
and the way +//. 2612785_2614145
it seems to me that that the one thing that this paper lacks that where you could've lengthened it without any kind of padding at all would would have been through the use of quotations .
that there're there're places here where I'm sort_of looking for the example you've given me the general description +/. 2632805_2644405
⌈ but I didn't put the example in there ⌉ +/. 2644405_2644525
+, ⌊ but then you need to say ⌋ this is what pins it down .
okay . 2675355_2675855
<is that> is that helpful at all ? 2675855_2689815
xxx .
yeah concrete detail .
out_of the text pretty much huh ?
right +/.
+, okay .
and and then just that that connection between poetry and THE elegy or the relation between poetry and elegiac poetry is the one that just needs to be clear <all the way> all the way through . 2689815_2705335
mkay +/.
+, so we know that we're talking about a particular form of poetry that does some some useful things . 2763685_2765005
I thought that in looking back over this <what I> what I see is that in that list of why I chose to do this where you say I why I took this kind of poem and I took these two poems together I wanted to illustrate this and I wanted to illustrate <that and> that and that . 2765185_2765765
that's a I think a very solid part of this paper . 2875425_2877205
+, okay +/. 2904605_2905145
+, &-uh I'm not sure that that's the best place to have those as there might've been a way of putting those up in front to say the poet +//.
the poems I'm writing about I've chosen for a variety of reasons .
to to do this to illustrate that principle to raise that question whatever it is . 2956885_2970565
and then go back to to that and show us in detail how those things +/. 2981185_2993925
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ how those ⌋ things meet .
but I think <part of> part of what you need to do is is find yourself a way of getting getting back and being a little harder on yourself as a reader . 3017465_3017965
(be)cause I think you're &~l you're letting some things slide I don't know how much time you put in on this but I think that that it would have benefitted from a hard hard rereading and did you do that ? 3035345_3048625
mhm .
yeah .
this must of been the hardest I worked on a paper in a while . 3077565_3078325
is it ?
yeah +/.

I've got to do some some work in getting all of you ready for the final and trying to get through the poems that we've got set for the next little while . 3503465_3505565
I don't know how we're gonna even &=laughs:S1 finish what we have ahead of us . 3586365_3586505

a review session .
okay .
alright well +...
work away and &-uh we'll see how how things go on the final . 3661625_3667125
<but I> but I just wanted to let you know in a more explicit way what I was troubled with here and why I wasn't why the grade wasn't maybe where you would want it to be . 3667125_3678685
okay what I could try this again ?
if you'd like that'd be great .
okay +/.
+, I I don't ordinarily do that (be)cause I +//.
my belief usually is that it's better to look to the future and just take the past and say alright that's gone and now let's use those lessons but in this case +/. 3704605_3704645

+, ⌊ and ⌋ <give me> give me more details give me at those places where I'm wondering about why you've done something either +... 3704645_3713505
don't do it I mean there're a_couple_of things there that you could leave out or give me a clearer sense of what you have in mind so that I would really want to know why the title of of Larkin's poem +/. 3730865_3760845
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ works ⌋ the way it does .
why what grass signifies what being at grass signifies and <how that> how that works for you .
&-um and then just &-um I &~th I think that that at one of the things that you could touch on that you didn't touch on in in either of these cases in an explicit way is just how these poems come to an end . 3784175_3786215
because it seems to me that that since we're talking about loss and since we're talking about this this sort_of elegiac note &-uh and endings that the ways in which the poem &~them poems themselves end &-uh can be really key to to understanding . 3820465_3830265
+, okay +/.
+, so just +//.
and both of these have &-uh have very strong end resonant moments I think that that is that the the close of the Larkin poem with the groom and the groom's boy &-um entering into the picture and we haven't heard of of them before . 3830265_3830725
but it's almost like +//. 3863965_3865485
well you tell me what it's almost like &=laughs <when you> when you work it through again .
but try to bring those two endings in . 3865565_3866045
and I think that would be a help .
okay .
good .
would you have &-um any suggestion on how I can make this better ?
(0.8) mm (0.14) forgot what page that was on . 3918445_3921505

and you were reading this back in this section on sounds ?
&-um yep +...
same type of thing .
(0.5) mm (0.8) I shoulda marked the page I don't know why I didn't . 3921585_3921665

mhm +/.
+, (0.6) where we're talking about off rhyme and &-um (0.4) and this you're talking about here where those change and then <the vowels> the vowels are different .
and &-um in in this case &-um the the vowels <really aren't> really aren't different because they're &-uh if if these are the examples then the A in race and place <they do> &~s they do stress that that ending . 3952885_3982865
&-uh oh but I see .

+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but ⌋ one way of of doing that is just to find a formal way of of giving us letting us see this in the poem . 4020945_4021605
so &~ins <instead of> &-um instead of just using the words here and generally when we talk about sounds or words as sounds or words we put (th)em in quotations like that to &~in to indicate that we're talking about +//. 4033285_4035105
but what I +/.
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ would ⌋ do here <is to> is to set this up with a colon and and use the quotation . 4034645_4064545
so give us the whole stanza or give us the parts of the stanzas that are important to you and then say &-um in maybe in parentheses underlining for emphasis . 4088865_4094725
and then just give the &~s quotation with these sounds underlined .
so we know that you're marking them I mean <it's just like you're> it's just like you're a teacher at the board and you're saying look at this line &~im this perfect iambic pentameter and then you'd mark out the &~iam iambic pentameter . 4135165_4165145
but here <you would> you would say I'm gonna call attention to this instance or these instances of consonants which is defined as and then give me the quotation and and say underlined for emphasis . 4186505_4196185

anyway but part of what's happening in in your papers is not doesn't have much to do with how you're reading poetry . 5129865_5135905

one of the great helps of understanding Acquainted with the Night was the time we spent discussing symbolism .

that's not a very good sentence itself but at least it's it's a &~li it's a_lot clearer than than what you're saying . 5246945_5247425
&-uh and I think that <you're just> you're just forgetting where you're going . 5247425_5247625
now one of the things you can do to to help yourself in this +... 5247825_5248025
do you proofread ?
yeah +/.
do you +/.
+, see &~y you know what I think my problem is ?
is <when I> when I wrote these papers I think I was trying to I I don't want to say like I was trying to hide anything but I think I was trying to maybe sound like I knew more than maybe like I actually did . 5296325_5296505
I'm not saying I didn't know it but just saying I wanted to sound like I +/. 5296525_5308685
+, sure +/.

+, ⌊ understand ⌋ or <that are> that are a little bit off base .
&-um and so &~th so this is happening fairly fairly regularly I think in in this .
if you look at a sentence like this one +...
okay (0.4) &{l=READING and in this poem yet unpleasant was very soothing to me . 5350805_5352725
&}l=READING now we don't know what was +/. 5352765_5353205
+, ⌈ right I see what you're saying ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ unpleasant and it's not the ⌋ whole poem it's an effect of the poem or a dimension of the poem and in this case I think <you're making> you're making a good point <that the> that the rain itself &-uh is meant to to be oppressive it's meant to be &-um distorting at least in in the poet's or in the speaker's eyes . 5377825_5400785
but <when you> when you talk about &-uh +... 5419435_5424015
when you say it made me feel like this gloom this stink this rain +... 5424015_5440115
and then you &~h you have a period and then you say the kind of rain that just soaks you and makes you feel miserable . 5447295_5448855
&-uh why not bring those +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ together ⌋ ?
since &~y since that still is functioning it's functioning to define the rain it's functioning to define it <in a> in a particular way and so <you need> &-uh you need to bring that together you need to show us the logic .
and the logic just disappears here . 5504595_5504635
+, mkay +/.

&{l=READING another poem I felt greatly influenced in poetry &}l=READING and I &~f where's the by ?
+, ⌈ right right right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you know what I mean ⌋ so +//.
now one thing I I was gonna say a minute ago one thing that you might do to help yourself out here is proofread the way you proofread now . 5507835_5537235
&~f for one move <through the> through the paper going through the whole paper from beginning to end . 5560705_5590105
and then start from the back . 5590025_5619425
and don't proofread with any kind of logic in your mind that's gonna control the way you see things . 5619465_5619965
just read sentence by sentence from the back to the front . 5619965_5620005
and what that does for you is &~f focus your attention on that sentence .
it hasta stand alone it hasta make sense on its own .
&~i you can't be reading <you can't> you can't have a lapse and think oh that's logical because it follows from what I said +/. 5638935_5668915
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ before ⌋ .
because it's not following from anything and and you wanna just isolate that because part of your part of what's happening here is that sentence by sentence your prose is breaking down . 5668875_5681235
it's not breaking down at the paragraph level &-uh it's not breaking down in terms of &-um your not having anything to say you've got something to say but you're not saying it in a way &-uh that &~al that allows us to register that . 5683195_5713175
because the prose is just +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ wandering ⌋ and and unfocused .
&-um so &~le let's look at at this one .
+, okay +/.
+, I think +...
this is a good &~ch choice and some people hurt themselves in this assignment by making a bad choice .
and they brought together poems that that &-um that don't work together . 5713135_5718135
okay so you introduce the poems <and then> and then you say they're poems that are similar and they are poems <that are> that are different . 5718155_5735795
&-uh why not something that says that in about half the words ?
like +/.
+, right +/.
+, they're both alike and different . 5779365_5779405
their similarities give us <this and> this and this &-uh their differences we can find primarily here .
+, mhm +/.
+, so <you've set> you've set something up .
now is that enough for a thesis ?
probably not .
+, ⌈ right right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ is that enough ⌋ to control something ? 5788485_5796465
but you could move on from from that to to make a kind of point and one one you might make is &~th is that we're not talking &-um &~we we're talking about someone reporting an experience here so the the aim is to to represent an attitude toward death .
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to ⌋ to give us some sense of &-uh some imagined sense of &~h what death might in fact be and the very fact that that Dickinson gives you this sort_of courtly gentleman who stops &-um because I could not stop for death he kindly stopped for me . 5838025_5868005
so there's a there's this &~v very striking and and surprising relationship to to death that she's she's describing . 5870345_5899685
in Felix Randall on the other hand you're looking at someone <who is> who is trying to come to to terms with death with the death of someone else . 5899685_5899745
and what what he sees in Felix Randall what the speaker sees in in Felix Randall &-uh is this grey sort_of heroic figure who's been cut down +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, by death who's been diminished .
and and +//.
so <that's where> that's where I would put put the emphasis here .
&-uh (0.8) can you see what's wrong with that sentence ?
yeah .
I could've easily just said the rhyme scheme +//. 5899745_5899825
are you talking about this one right here ?
mhm ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.

yeah avoid due to ⌈ but ⌉ &=laughs .
⌊ well ⌋ okay .
&-um poem written for herself .
&-um what I could pretty much say is because of the fact that she wrote in her journal &-um that that leads to the fact that her rhyme schemes can be unusual . 5955325_5955425
because she really wasn't meaning to write for anybody or for a specific +//. 5955445_5955965
you know if she had like an English class or poetry class I'm sure she'd hafta follow a certain +/.
⌈ right ⌉ +/.

and I think that's that's kind_of what I tried to say but but in too many words xxx . 5955965_5956005
okay most of someone once pointed out that that almost all of Emily Dickinson's poems <can be> &-um can be &-uh sung to the tune of The Yellow Rose of Texas .
that that the rhyme scheme is is does duplicate itself so much that that you could just sing it to that &~tu sing all of them to that tune .
&-um okay &-um it it's not logical to say that something is both unique and almost nonexistent . 5982045_5995865

so so I think you're you're off base there . 5999685_6003145
&-um okay here is just a classic &-uh error where where you're saying you open this up open the sentence up with as assigned well what was assigned ? 6003145_6005985
we were not assigned okay ? 6005985_6007985
as assigned we we were to compare .
it's the assignment asked us to compare or the &~as the assignment asked that we compare and so on . 6011505_6041485
⌈ &-um ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ we're not the assignment .
⌈ right ⌉ .
⌊ right ⌋ (0.5) and again &~th this is just wasted space if you say as the poem comes to a close the last line says . 6056415_6086395
well the last line is the +/.
⌈ mhm yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ close so ⌋ why do you need to say that twice ?
&~th &~th the much &-uh more precise way of of saying it . 6115275_6115795
but I think that you just I think that you almost have to to read aloud to yourself .
maybe paragraph by paragraph and then do that proofreading from the back because you need to catch these sentences that just &-uh go off in random directions that <that don't> that don't show us the logic of what you're doing . 6155585_6155645
and <you should think of> you should think of punctuation <if you> &~th if you're thinking of punctuation at all it's probably not you know the first thing on your mind morning and night .
but if you're thinking about it at all you should think of it as a system of of signs and pointers to your reader that that allows that person to see your logic and to anticipate your logic . 6163765_6186485
so if if you're setting up a sentence &-uh <and it's> and it's going to go on for more than a line or two you've probably got a number of phrases in it possibly one or two two or three &-uh &~m clauses +/. 6189765_6219705
+, mhm +/.
+, that might be independent they need to be balanced .
so if you're talking about Dickinson here and Hopkins there one way to to do that is to to make an assertion about Dickinson separate that assertion from what you're gonna say about Hopkins with a semicolon which signals same thing on both sides same grammatical structure on both sides and then put that in and strive for the kind of balance . 6223545_6244145
and someone was asking me for for a project that she's doing the other day &-uh why I believe that that poetry is a good means for teaching writing and why writing is a good means for teaching poetry . 6244145_6244465
and I think that poetry is a good means for teaching writing because I think if we see the structures that poets use if we look at the way in which they design things &-uh it can help us to be +/. 6244465_6245665

do you want me to like redo it ? 6298405_6312405
well <I wouldn't> I wouldn't mind your sharpening the Dickinson and Hopkins and maybe rather than redo it I'd I'm not a &-uh I think that much of the time when we ask students to go back and and do something over again &-um they would be better off moving forward . 6319845_6349825

but I think there is some utility <in just> in just doing a bit of a rewrite here . 6350065_6356365
I wouldn't rewrite the whole paper but maybe <I would> <I would take> &-um I would take &~th this first page and the first paragraph on the second page and and I'd begin by saying what do +//. 6356365_6379925

+, <what do> &~i what do I wanna do here ?
I I wanna state my intention .
do I want the thesis right up here in this first paragraph or can it wait until the second paragraph ? 6380805_6388005
whatever I &~ch I choose there is gonna determine and shape what comes after and so what do I want to do in that second paragraph ? 6388005_6397125
you might even tell me that .
you might even rewrite these and tell me in the margin <after you've> after you've printed them off &-um do those three paragraphs and scribble in the margin my intention here was X .
what I wanted to do here was Y .
&-uh this third paragraph is intended to do whatever . 6420165_6420205
and just move through them in that way .
<and then> and then <I can> I can see how clearly you're understanding what your logic is where you're going . 6435665_6442345
and then if you wanted to say &~a if you wanted to say for the rest of the paper and you could just use what's here or you can simply put that in in a kind of outline form .
in my fourth paragraph this is going to happen fifth sixth seventh my conclusion is gonna go here . 6473085_6502405
and &~n no great need to to write that out but do write out <so I can> so I can get a sense . 6502525_6532465

and the context might be match the following line from the poem from which it's taken . 7555645_7585625

&=laughs I think that &=laughs:S4 &~th I think the weakest section is the last one . 8761465_8791445
&=laughs:S4 that that that somehow &-um the you need to find a way of getting back to that tone of of really strong personal feeling that that came earlier because it seems to me that &-um that to end on on that note of just chomping . 8791285_8821225
the humor &=laughs +/.

that yeah this this series of stories has is more than just a disconnected number of stories but that they they come together in a significant way .
now <this is> this is my &-uh I suppose obsession &=laughs <that I> that I need that kind of order I need that final shaping not everybody does . 8840725_8860845
and not everybody would probably fasten on on just that . 8860845_8864665
but there're a_lot_of good things in in what you've done there .
&-uh and one of the ways that that it was clear to me that that things were working well is that +... 8866525_8895925
I was waiting for the next story as I was waiting to hear what the next story would be and how you would open it up and how how that connected with the stories <that you> that you told before .
the other thing that you do really well on a couple maybe more than a_couple_of of occasions <is to> is to use words in surprising ways so that they they really are new for us . 8921905_8951885
and to bring together matters that are usually not brought together . 8951905_8981885
so that there's this collision &-uh of that I don't know that we even have an expectation that's a settled &~expec expectation but but there's something about bringing unlike things together that surprises us and and tells us that that you're looking at the world in a way that not everybody looks at the world .
and I think for me that's one of the things that that I think poets people who who have a creative streak really have and and they don't +//. 9005925_9035905
I don't think it's something that's learned I don't think that you can teach it but I remember years ago a a student &-uh <who was> who was someone I liked a great deal and who who really had &-um <who was> who was sort_of cynical I think her her main attitude was a cynical attitude .
but she had this this gift for metaphor where she could just bring things together <in a> in a surprising way . 9046005_9075985
and <it wasn't> it wasn't anything that that you would ever have read before in a poem or in a piece of fiction it was just her own vision of the world that <let her> &~s let her see things .
so I &~th I think that's an impressive part of what's what's going on . 9107945_9137325
I also think that that you do +//.
maybe there's one point where this doesn't quite work .
but I think you do a wonderful job of of giving us some things that are relatively &-um abstract and sometimes &~u universal and then rooting all that in a particular place and a particular +//. 9137325_9137745
<and the> and the place names work well here in <what you're> what you're doing so that there's something really really solid &-um that allows you to anchor what you're saying in in something that +//. 9137745_9137925
and it doesn't seem to &~mat I I probably don't know the geography of the Detroit area as_well_as I should after all the years that I've spent here . 9152105_9182045
but I don't think it particularly matters whether you know that geography in detail or not .
for someone who does know it probably &-um there's a greater resonance from &-um you know street names and park names and <that kind of> that kind of thing . 9209335_9227135
but this is good I like +//.
