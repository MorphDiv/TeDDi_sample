<so this> . 232_476
<so just> single player yeah ? 255_1033
yeah . 1521_1672
single player . 1881_2334
uh random map . 3030_3878
s:o . 5793_6478
you're gonna have three competitors . 6676_8267
and it's a pretty standard game . 8604_9997
so that's fine now . 10101_10914
okay . 11111_11413
“start game” . 11703_12179
so this is a bit different from Civilization . 14629_17195
eh everything happens in real time so there are no turns . 17437_20003
so . 20897_21291
you've gotta get used to doing everything at once . 21489_23521
so first of all that's your town centre you can see smack in the
okay . 27470_27772
<hmh> ? 27761_28190
<now everybody's> deciding they don't like you . 27854_29502
and you are an enemy . 29502_30942
0 &=laugh .
which is gr:ant . 30942_31975
ehm . 32532_33101
the idea is you have to gather resources and bring them to your
once you have lots of resources you can start building <things like
<okay> . 40846_41554
you can see your resources up at the top left . 42941_45066
there's wood food gold and stone . 45309_47817
wood basically for base buildings . 48535_50788
uh food for creating villagers and so on . 51473_53876
so if you left click on <a> a villager . 54690_56826
okay . 57964_58312
and y:ou tell him where to go by right clicking somewhere else . 58978_62078
<okay> . 62459_62749
<so> . 62460_62763
<so> . 62763_63030
<get him> to have a wonder . 62786_63668
and see <what he can find> . 63928_65379
<so if you'll> +//. 64288_64718
so anywhere like ? 64729_65333
<can we> <would you go off> +. 65403_67492
<yeah> . 65855_66227
+, the map or just anywhere <or> ?
<of> course . 67191_67562
yeah . 67585_67690
the map is shown bottom right . 67829_69037
see <that big> black square . 69109_70584
<okay> . 69365_69760
and as you go around you get to see more of it . 71292_72825
okay . 73332_73622
and you just more or less explore for some of these things
yeah well we need to find some trees and we need to find some food
okay . 80937_81100
<and> +/. 81227_81460
<so> if +/. 81228_81692
<can you> keep on going ? 81912_82632
<yeah> . 81982_82144
you can keep going as much as you want . 82962_84459
but you'll have to keep clicking . 84784_85632
so it's good idea to click each of the villagers and send them off
<all right> . 88783_89816
and the map move at you as well ? 93600_95307
yeah . 95582_95721
so you wanna explore and find some trees . 96313_98183
there's a tree . 98194_98728
<okay> . 99413_99762
<right> ? 99611_99855
so if you pick your villager and you right click the tree . 100235_102487
yeah . 104577_104983
that's <right> . 106268_106605
<m> . 106512_106640
he's now gonna start chopping down the tree . 107336_108822
and he'll carry <the t(ree)> <the wood> back to your
<he'll carry> . 110268_110697
<all right> . 112474_112892
<okay> . 112474_112752
<I see> . 112897_113257
<so he is happy> . 112938_113484
so you go off and do something else then ? 113714_114840
yeah . 114933_115083
you tell him to go somewhere ? 116430_117220
yeah . 117614_117800
and is there a boundary of the map like ? 118102_119519
<see the way i'm to> go any further or ? 119519_120854
<what you see> +/. 119520_120065
you see this black thing <down the bottom> corner ? 121075_122735
<alright> . 121957_122375
yeah . 122874_123048
that's the entire map . 123136_124367
so you can see you are up in the north corner of the map . 124355_126735
and you can kind of explore the rest of it . 127304_128999
and the other bad guys are somewhere . 129978_131290
so there's another tree . 131417_132149
<mhm> . 132393_133252
<and> some stone . 132404_133263
so what's a good idea now is to start building some buildings .
okay ? 138941_139185
<m hm> . 139475_139858
you've got <one guy> chopping down the tree . 139476_140706
a:nd one of the buildings that's useful is uh . 141294_144278
you can have buildings to live in , buildings to get food ,
so uh if you click . 148571_149790
you see there is a hammer at the bottom <left> ? 149975_151949
<yeah> . 151833_152030
this one ? 152332_152541
if you click that . 152553_153006
yeah . 153075_153191
that gives you the options you <can build> . 153586_154945
<oh what> you want to build ? 154538_155432
yeah . 155392_155590
yeah . 155624_155833
so one by one you have a house you have a barracks for soldiers
uh what's the next one ? 159537_160222
<granar:y> . 160222_160744
<granary> . 160338_160698
uh a wood pit . 161237_162479
and a fishery . 163060_163965
<okay> . 164546_164825
<dock> . 164653_164932
so if you build a <vish> fishery dock . 165164_166941
yeah . 167581_167662
<a:nd> click <on it> . 168115_169044
<oh> . 168138_168301
<okay> . 168928_169160
and then click in the water in front of him . 169636_171366
<all right> . 172232_172615
<actually> in the water . 172313_173138

<so he goes and builds that> . 181797_182691
<yeah> . 182807_183016
<all right> . 182830_183179
<come back> to your town centre . 183378_184365
<and then> . 183379_183657
why this guy is going <back> ? 184598_185759
<he> is fine . 185526_186130
<pick the other guy> . 186327_186931
<so the other> . 186328_186954
ah . 187314_187558
that's a berry bush . 187709_188464
do you see it there ? 188475_188963
oh here ? 189905_190195
yeah . 190300_190439

<alright> . 190845_191205
+, click that he'll go and pick <berries> .
<and there's> more of them so . 192231_193056
yeah . 193195_193369
but you got them to do like sorta sequentially or ? 193381_195285
can he <just> ? 195343_195796
<he> he'll search himself and <he'll> he'll go off and
but one of the problems is that it's a long walk back to the town
so we're gonna build a granary at some point . 201439_203378
closer to the bushes . 203900_205375
<does that make> sense ? 205607_206199
<okay> . 205642_206002
yeah . 206269_206431
so we can get a few more villagers . 206814_208056
and the way you get villagers . 208056_208997
by going to your town centre . 209031_210227
which is back in the middle . 210959_211876
<yeah> . 212062_212247
<scroll> down . 212062_212619
yeah . 212665_212863
there ! 213083_213304
and if you click it . 213745_214535
you get two options , one is to make a new villager , and the other
before you can do that you see all the requirements ? 220796_222549
there's <food> fifty , food five hundred <and> and two
<yeah> . 222746_223025
yeah . 226020_226206
so get a couple more villagers . 226364_227676
you can only do one at a time so . 227931_229289
just click . 229347_229835
just click one yeah ? 229823_230601
yeah ? 230636_230764
and he goes off and he's building . 230903_231995
okay . 232449_232739
so . 233378_233622
check up on the guy (..) building the fishery place . 234063_237244
he is <done> . 237407_237743
<yeah> ? 237604_237778
okay . 238125_238404
so if you click on the dock . 238636_239902
looks all new . 240157_240621
you can get it to build different type of boats . 241017_243083
there's a fishing boat . 243002_243896
which is the first one . 244024_244592
which is <useful> . 244743_245312
<yeah> . 244976_245196
goes off and collects food . 245510_246450
and a trade <boat> . 246498_247693
<yeah> . 247473_247659
okay . 247891_248030
so maybe a <fishing> boat yeah ? 248062_249292
<yeah> . 248820_248994
m hm . 249435_249632
meanwhile . 251160_251682
let's get uh the builder who is standing there doing nothing . 252077_254573
yeah ? 255421_255618
this guy ? 255641_255955
yeah . 256280_256570
to build something else . 257243_258335
we could do with some more houses . 258673_260078
there's population limit . 260566_261854
the more people you have the more houses you <have to build> .
<you need> . 263898_264350
okay . 264500_264825
so at the moment they're living in the town centre . 265046_267031
<so> +/. 267637_267846
<so> spread them out somewhere yeah ? 267638_268705
well keep it as close to the town centre as you can because the
kinda waste time in food and stuff like that yeah ? 275506_277027
all right . 277138_277463
so just click . 277457_278211
there . 278560_278827
<and> . 278943_279361
<just> . 278944_279036
perfect yeah . 279535_279999
oh . 280197_280406
okay . 280626_280870
just make sure you actually leave enough room to walk around them .
<okay> . 283471_283959
<that's the only> restriction . 283506_284806
okay . 285932_286211
so what about the guy up by the dock ? 286269_287534
he is coming now . 288173_288718
oh . 288834_289020
<okay> . 289779_290023
<this> guy ? 289826_290093
it's the dock that builds the fishing boat not the man . 290255_292461
all right . 292577_292925
so you can send the fishing boat off to look for fish . 293297_295444
see this fish jumping <down> ? 296664_298301
<alright> . 297964_298231
yeah . 298753_299032
you have to right click it remember ? 300562_301827
so <pick> click on the boat . 302303_303569
left <click> . 303778_304312
<oh yeah> . 303921_304153
<right> . 304370_304555
<right> click tells it to <go there> . 304371_305658
<all right> . 305357_305833
so the man can go do something else . 306526_308059
so why don't you get him to explore a bit more ? 309104_310926
so just ? 311635_311971
yeah . 312180_312459
<right click> . 312738_313248
<go somewhere else> ? 312739_313527
yeah . 313492_313608
so you see the boat is fishing away . 313969_315222
and it'll go back to the dock and <come back> +. 315211_317452
<when it> . 316407_316778
and <fish and> +/.
when it has its thing done yeah ? 316976_318102
yeah . 318213_318352
so . 320430_320953
uhm perhaps another villager would be useful . 321080_322752
where it ends ? 324419_324953
and now the guy stopped building the house you can get him to build
what do you think will be useful now ? 330029_331132
perhaps a <barracks> +. 331434_333001
<uh> . 331794_332038
+, to build <soldiers> .
<yeah> . 332607_332932
cause if you are attacked you need soldiers . 333062_334699
so . 334803_335012
click on the barracks . 335473_336367
<not enough wood> . 336506_337168
<where to put it> ? 336692_337319
so you have to go and cut more . 337319_338190
yeah . 338445_338619
so send him to go cut wood . 338794_340094
so . 340930_341313
we need to find out a tree more or less . 341337_343380
m hm . 343542_343798
try at that way . 344746_345314
yeah . 345372_345558
right click remember ? 345953_346731
and you have another idle villager standing there . 347811_349552
so i've sent him off in a different direction . 350418_351927
and the other villager stopped walking . 355505_357142
see it to your right ? 357467_358570
so or . 359766_360207
so you send them a(ll) ? 360218_360810
ops . 360857_361182
so i'm after switching all <directions> . 361773_363154
<that's okay> . 362701_363189
it's one of these games where <you> you have to do twenty
okay . 367520_367926
yeah . 367914_368100
