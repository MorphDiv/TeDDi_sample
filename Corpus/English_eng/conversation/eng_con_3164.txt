I don't want area to just be rectangles or have it be +...
I want to push on that idea a little bit .
you've thought about how much space this covers, but +...
but oh it was, it was an orange paper quilt .
and quilts do cover things, that notion of cover +.
understanding what that means, that whole .
concept there, understanding what that means .
to think about that's much trickier .
to think about when it's your hand .
and I know that kids are going to same thing, like .
I want to lay this one on top, .
I know their first notion is going to start with yeah, .
if I put his up to mine, mine's bigger, .
and then I want them to wrestle with though is, .
okay, you're going to get to two hands that .
you're going to think maybe are close but not sure .
you know, maybe in a group of four, .
they would do it and they would feel comfortable .
and they'd really feel they were right, .
we got them in order .
but with twenty or twenty four, there's just no way .
right, so at first that seems a cinch to them .
we'll be able to do this no problem .
and we won't need math to do it either .
but, then they do need it .
what what kind of big ideas about measurement .
do you get to see ?
okay, well, once they've decided, .
we can't just put our hands next to each other, .
and there's things like that, .
that we're going to have to talk about .
well, how are we going to measure ?
what are the tool we're going to use ?
and that whole notion of the tools we're going to use .
which eventually get down to I know what .
kind of unit of measure we're going to use here .
um, but first they wrestle with .
if we trace them on paper, .
does one person have to do all the tracing ?
or, you know, does it matter if we .
do everybody's right hand or everybody's left hand ?
and then, so dealing with that, .
but then getting to the point .
okay, you've figured out how to trace them, .
or who's going to trace them, or which hand .
and how to lay it on the paper .
now, what do you fill it with, .
or what do you cover it with ?
first they, there's always the the side road, .
with um, .
I think if we just measure from like, .
if I held hand out like this with my fingers splayed .
if you measured from the tip of my pinky .
to the tip of my thumb, kind of across there .
and mine is longer or wider than his, .
my hand covers more space .
or that measuring the height of that hand, .
or the hand tracing .
so they try to use length as a surrogate .
yes .
and what seems, uh, to put the kabosh on that ?
um, the same way like, when you put, uh, .
your hand up against mine and I notice, .
well my middle finger and the tops of them .
are above yours, but your thumb sticks out more .
they realize, well, .
you know somebody says for instance, .
+" well, maybe she had the tallest hand, .
+" but maybe mine is the fattest hand .
so then they start to realize, well, .
it's all of the space under there .
and, you don't come right and say it, .
but that line from there to there, .
or that line that goes the height of the hand .
that's not getting it all .
I mean that's not .
so, they think of, how much the hand covers, .
then they think about .
covering that handprint with something .
alright, so after they establish that, .
unfortunately we are going to have to .
measure the space that this thing covers .
then sometimes it depends upon what's laying around .
or what they've used before .
so what kind of things do you usually .
make sure are laying around ?
um, .
well the beans seem good at first, .
because somebody will come up and start filling in .
the outline of their hand, .
whoever the guinea pig is then .
yeah, they're curved because they look at .
especially if the first one you start to fill .
is a splayed finger handprint .
they're nice because they fit down the fingers .
I mean, you can put a row of beans down, .
they don't go outside of the lines, .
and that's important .
and they're curved and they're .
curved just like the .
yeah, and then they fill them in nicely .
you can keep them all in those boundaries .
and they do pretty well, good job but then .
they ask what's not so good about this, hmm .
usually the fact that the beans aren't the same size .
so that whole notion of the spaces between the beans, .
the beans are good because they fit nicely, .
but the beans are not so good .
they don't cover the whole space, .
and those cracks are part of the hand .
and if you don't find a way to figure out .
how much space was cracks, and how much space wasn't, .
you really don't know for sure .
if two hands are very close which one was bigger .
uh huh .
um, so beans, and then somebody says, .
well something that would curve better .
string is a good one , going around the outside .
I think they want to fill it in like a, .
one of those yarn paintings where you just keep .
following the shape of it .
and getting it down until you're in the center .
and glue down the end .
and spaghetti, so, we've had different years .
some want the spaghetti cooked so that .
it's very flexible and pliable and .
could lay in there and almost tile it in a .
curvilinear way, right .
but others are thinking more noodles and macaroni .
because those are often there with the dried beans .
but, the same problems come up with those .
no second grade has ever asked .
for squares, or grid paper, or graph paper .
it always has to be me who says .
+" what if you used this ?
and then usually .
they say .
+" no, that won't work !
+" no, no .
um, because you trace a handprint on there, .
and, they say, there's those, look at those .
places where the finger, you know, doesn't .
it goes over the boundaries .
what gets them to accept the idea of squares finally ?
so, they like that the squares are all the same size, .
and there are no cracks, no spaces in between .
they cover that paper completely .
so they like that, and you trace hand, .
and then they look for the whole squares .
they find those, and that's easy, .
and they can see that they do compare .
because they get different numbers .
but, and it's I never need to say this: .
+" What about those leftovers ?
+" What about that space ?
+" You can't just forget that space, .
that's part of the hand .
but, how do you know how much is there ?
um, and usually, usually again, it's a kid who says: .
+" Well this one here is almost a whole square, .
maybe we could count it as a whole square .
and then the class says .
+" no, no no, you can't count it .
as a whole square if it's not a whole square .
but, sometimes if somebody goes looking, .
or sometimes it has to be me .
+" well, it is only missing this little corner, .
but look over here on her handprint, there's .
this little corner of a square that was a leftover .
what if those two were pushed together, .
about how much space do you think that would be ?
+" Oh, that's a square's worth of space .
and then, we color those two the same color, .
so that visually kids can see, .
I'm imagining putting this little piece .
with that almost whole square .
and then I'll count that as a whole square .
do you see, uh, a range of strategies .
when the kids are combining these things ?
or is that generally .
um, well, the easiest ones to find .
are the ones that look about a half of a square .
so whether it's the diagonal, along the diagonal, .
or a vertical or a horizontal .
those are easiest for them to match .
and some kids cop out right about there .
and even, um, two pieces where, like what we said, .
this one's almost the whole square, .
and here's the little bit that would make it whole .
those come easiest and then there's .
some kids can't get past that .
they go .
+" there's all these parts left, but I just don't .
know how they go together to make a square .
because they're looking more for a fit .
that would be like a jigsaw puzzle, .
like these, I could im like they would fit exactly .
but then there are other kids who can say: .
+" I know this is about a quarter, .
and this one's about a quarter, .
even though it's the long and skinny way .
different configurations .
right, and I know they're about a half, .
and then they'll say, and I put it with .
this other piece that's about a half, so, I'd say, .
the kids are willing to put more than two pieces together
