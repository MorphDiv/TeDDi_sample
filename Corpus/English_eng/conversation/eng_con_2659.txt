far you got in the readings and what readings you did .
&-uh I read the first &-uh just up to transparency on phenomenal illusions and actually finished reading ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ like the first four &~f ⌋ five pages or something like +/.
yeah .
+, that ?
+, yeah +/.
+, and you .
finished reading the one from ⌈ last time so ⌉ .
⌊ <oh okay> ⌋ .
did we have a miscommunication about what or you just ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ no I I I I &~wa I I I ⌋ read that shortly thus &~th +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &~th ⌋ the day after the class and thought I would have more time as time went on .
how far (di)d you get ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ yeah I read ⌋ I read the Tye thing yeah but I didn't get too far into ⌈ your paper ⌉ .
⌊ ah okay ⌋ .
and you didn't read the Tye ?
no I haven't read Tye .
okay so we don't have any overlap alright +/.
+, that's interesting .
+, ⌈ you said that ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you said ⌋ that the the the couple pages from Tye +/.
+, yeah .
+, about Pecant alright ?
yeah .
those are the sort_of the cases that we presented on the first day right the the case of the .
two trees .
with the two trees .
we already talked about that ?
first day ⌈ of this seminar ⌉ .
⌊ well we &~s yeah we sort_of xxx mentioned it ⌋ .
⌈ we've mentioned it a couple times ⌉ .
alright .
okay .
so we talked about and also &~y &~y &~y you've raised it in another thing that you wrote &-uh talking about the &-um +...
I forget exactly exactly how you'd how you worked it out but we did talk about some .
okay .
then &-um then I I I I figured with the shorter shortened week we might be like this so I brought some stuff to +...
to do .
not so we weren't driven just by your questions .
&-um but if you have stuff you wanna raise about what you read I +//.
what I would do left to my own devices is to tell you what I'm trying to do in this phenomenal illusions paper .
summary form and stuff like that .
&-um if you have questions about Tye &~u &~i if you say we'd already discussed it then it might not be hard if you +...
if you ⌊ got already questions xxx ⌋ +/.
⌈ I <I do> I do I do have one question <on the> on the beginning ⌉ +/.
+, if they're not highly detailed then you might very easily be able to raise (th)em as I go .
so that we don't leave John behind xxx .
yeah this this was just the very beginning .
that &-uh talks about &-uh &-uh Sartre's contention &-uh that we are under the illusion that we have an image .
&-uh &-uh the the statement on on on this account &-uh I'll read the sentence before this &{l=READING was posed in the speaking of color shapes and mental images people are trying to express their imaginative experiences or perhaps their most natural beliefs about their experience &}l=READING sincerely strictly literally &{l=READING on this account the experiences or beliefs represent that there are images with color and shape although there are no such things .
&-uh this takes more seriously Sartre's idea that we are under an illusion which I call the image illusion .
&}l=READING &-uh <which he> which he which +//.
that's I guess &-um that would well ⌊ xxx expression ⌋ +/.
⌈ xxx a quote ⌉ from Sartre that's not +/.
+, the last there's I was looking for the image illusion as a quote that's his expression .
no .
the illusion of eminence .
you see from like the first page or second page <or so> this is the only quote .
yeah .
right right .
whatever .
you may have .
right okay .
the illusion of eminence .
but it doesn't matter the words <you use> .
uhuh .
it's what's what's what's puzzling me about <is that> is that suppose I have an image in my mind <of a> of a red fire truck &=laughs which I can you know form in my mind and and and xxx got an image of a red fire truck or said close your eyes and and and think of that .
&-um is is Sartre's contention that you only have a &-uh &-um that you have a a something that represents &-uh the color red ?
rather than really having the color red ?
and when you're imagining it that way ?
that's what he says that's what I think too that's what almost everyone thinks but you know does that surprise you ?
&~w .
you know that there's nothing red ⌊ in ⌋ in your mind .
⌈ &~w &~w it's it's ⌉ yeah it comes comes across in in what &-um &-um &-uh Daniel Dennett seems to assume and maybe this is a a wider held assumption but it's a surprisingly fairly <wide held> assumption .
is that if there's nothing which is literally red in my brain &-um then I can't be genuinely having experience of red .
&-um but that's gonna be true of &-uh &-uh when I'm looking at a red book .
I'm not +//.
there's nothing red in my head .
&-uh &-uh and to ⌊ say ⌋ .
⌈ &~i &~i ⌉ no one is denying you have &~exp we'll hafta back up on this xxx +/.
alright .
+, it is a kind of &~s it's it's not just a hey what did this word mean sort_of thing .
but &~be &-uh &-uh &-um but &-uh but the denial is not that you're having experience of red it's it's the denial that you have an experience made of red .
+, right +/.
+, you know .
&-uh &-uh &-um that you literally have an &~i a likeness of red things in your head .
that you you know &~i in other words you have red things in your mind .
I mean of_course you have red things in your brain blood xxx .
yeah you don't an experience made of red &-um ⌊ if if one was thinking about ⌋ .
⌈ yeah okay that's that's even though it ⌉ seems like you do when you say I have a red image and now I'm rotating it now it's coming closer so that's the &-um that that's the only illusion being claimed .
it's &~b being claimed that xxx there but but I don't wanna go into it (un)til we get to it .
okay .
so ⌊ let's do ⌋ .
⌈ let's hold off ⌉ on this then that that discussion ⌊ (un)til xxx ⌋ .
⌈ yeah xxx ⌉ <as soon> as soon as I see something that triggers it .
okay .
alright .
okay .
&-um &-uh alright so &-um what I'm trying to do is <is a> is a bunch of things at once &-um &~i one of +//.
that paper that we did last time I'm trying to argue for the inner perception model from a_priori considerations right ?
mhm +/.
+, this is more like an attempt to reach the same theory from xxx explanation .
and &-um so we need some data to explain and the data's gonna be introspective and and so in in that respect I'm at the mercy of other people saying yeah it's like that for me too or no no you're weird right and &-um and &-uh &-um and I'm not sure I I can <get away with it> but but <what I> what I +//.
the first half of the paper is trying without building in theory it doesn't mention except in an introduction inner perceptions just trying to say what there is to be explained I think .
and it's this pair of illusions .
then the second half is trying to explain it .
but &-uh &-uh &-uh okay so so there's an so there's this other argument for inner perception based on the claim that it's the best unified explanation of this pair of illusions .
+, mhm .
+, &-um &-uh well why is this pair of illusions relevant to consciousness (be)cause I also think that I try to argue this sorta case by case that every last &~exper conscious experience you have suffers or has one or other of the illusions are &~c combined in weird ways .
&-um and that nothing that's not +//.
no mental state of yours that's not a conscious experience has either one so the two together this and that in actual cases are you know track consciousness and &-um and it doesn't look like a coincidence .
&-um so &-um .
are the two mistakes of thinking that you have through the the red that's out there on the the transparency or the diaphanous of +/.
+, ⌈ &~tr ⌉ transparency illusion and the other the the illusion that I have something red in here &-uh that's actually red .
yeah <the the> the the the the two illusions one I should start calling it the likeness illusion rather than the image illusion but the the one is roughly +//.
I'm gonna hafta modify this later but roughly the one illusion the image illusion is that you have mental objects with nonmental properties .
&-um so a thing in your head a an image a visual image that's +//.
has shape .
&-uh &-um or color or size something motion or &-uh &-um <or a> &-uh or a sound in your head a song in your head &-uh kinda sound rhythm pitch and so forth .
when there's nothing in your head with &~a any of that stuff .
&-um or in your mind or soul or whatever .
&-um so that's mental objects with nonmental properties and nicely sort_of the transparency illusion is that there's nonmental objects environmental objects bodily objects &~nonben nonmental objects with mental properties some kind of &-uh &-uh weird dependent on your mind properties so so &-um the idea that &-um +...
that &-uh &-um you know the wall there not only has &-um &-uh shape location &-um &-uh mass reflectance but also has &-um &-uh a particular kinda shape look that can vary as you move or or or reflectance look that can vary according to your sense organs some some or or &~o &~o &~o &-um &-uh the the transparency illusion's harder to make out but it's but the the best kind of examples I have is when you have a shapes a curved shape .
and you &~a &~a &~s and mathematically or physically there's a a a a be some account of curvature .
and that's a property I'm not saying there's an illusion there .
xxx nonmental object really has that nonmental property .
but in perception it seems like it's got more properties than that shape related property so not only does it &~s so you you look at +//.
<you can> you can be sensitive to the look of a curve or the feel of a curve a blind person could .
like you detect the feel of a curve .
and and &-uh a curve look and a curve feel the chair also seems to have the those properties stuck on it objectively it doesn't seem <even though> even though +...
what a curve looks like and what a curve feels like are different from one another and they're but even though they're detecting the same feature they &-um curvature &-uh they &-um &-uh &~a &-uh and those differences so I I we try to argue do most likely depend on the constitution of your sense organs and brain and so forth .
&-uh &-uh &-uh &-um it doesn't seem like they do it doesn't seem like you help create the look of the chair or the curve or or the feel of it it seems like you just passively discover it &-um and so that's the sense in which a property feature that really is dependent on you seems not to be .
and that's the transparency illusion .
&-uh but but so so ⌊ so ⌋ .
⌈ so ⌉ that the illusion isn't that it's curved but the illusion ⌊ is that it has ⌋ +/.
⌈ no no no ⌉ .
+, a curved feel +/.
+, right .
+, or that it has a ⌊ curved look ⌋ .
⌈ that it's got ⌉ some extra weirder properties yeah &-uh &-um but +...
⌊ and ⌋ .
⌈ can ⌉ you say something about it is is that &-um +...
does that correlate with &-uh Lockean primary secondary +/.
unhunh no +/.
+, no ?
okay .
alright but yeah I discuss that too xxx that's a good question I'll keep it xxx .
&~h sorry how would you classify &-uh these properties that Tye uses in the paper to talk about the illusions like looking ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ xxx ⌉ no no overlap (be)cause I didn't look back ⌊ xxx that's that's ⌋ .
oh looking bigger from here ⌈ it's wherever you xxx in the paper +...
looking ⌉ .
you should xxx yeah .
there is one little &~c self-contained section of my paper where I talk about I talk about that and what he says is so weird +/.
yeah .
+, that I thought I should assign it &=laughs:SUm so you didn't think I had mispresented &=s1_looks_through_s3's_copy_of_the_paper &-um what &-uh &-um oh you printed it off the Internet ?
yeah .
xxx .
it's not long after this here's Peacock's case abbreviated and and this is +/.
ah right .
+, response of xxx +/.
+, yeah that's it +/.
+, and there's a footnote probably the footnotes didn't print did they .
+, oh man I stuff everything in the footnotes <I should> &~g I should give you originals .
but +...
yeah .
even I I I I like when he came and gave a talk everyone's complaining about larger from here +/.
+, yes .
+, right ?
okay .
&-uh I don't understand what that's supposed to mean it's not him it's it's Harmon's +//.
Gilbert Harmon's +//.
original +...
<take reaction> and it &-uh it doesn't &-uh doesn't make sense .
&~a &-uh &-uh &-um &-um and in fact they don't linger on it .
they just he just throws out +/.
+, yeah .
+, a few things in a row and combines them .
+, right +/.
+, &-um &-um the let's see &-uh &-uh &-uh let's let's +//.
but let's hold off <on the> on the +/.
+, sure .
+, transparency stuff .
just see if we can at least get the image stuff done .
&-um (0.7) &-uh so I'm saying the image illusion is the illusion that there are mental objects with nonmental features .
and &-uh &~a and +//.
but that's just the first pass &-uh &-uh &-uh a substitute for what I mean by mental here .
because by +//.
in the end I'm gonna try to argue that these are perceptual illusions or inner perceptual illusions .
and it's very doubtful that a perceptual layer of representation could could say could represent mentality or nonmentality <there's no> there's no way that looks or smells right so I need to refashion the so+called data in the direction of something perception can do .
&-um &-uh <and here's> one step in that direction but not the final step .
for &-um for mental think what I call &~monom monomodal .
&-uh &-um representable by just one perceptual modality color vision versus shape vision or eye eye vision versus hearing &-uh in one perceiver .
so &-uh &-um so so the substitute for the concept of mental xxx will reappear .
it's it's something will seem mental to you if it seems like just one perceiver detects it with just one +...
&-uh modality .
<I have to> say something about what separates one modality from another versus polymodal which is gonna substitute for nonmental .
&-uh &-uh &-um &-um a polymodal feature would be one that &-uh seems representable by either by one individual with with more &~th more than one faculty so like the primary feature of shape and <feel you can> feel you can touch you can maybe conceivably hear it or something .
&-uh &-uh &-um &-uh or in <in the case> &~l in the case of color even though you can only do colors with your vision many people can do the same color .
can do colors right so there's more than one +//.
so if you just in effect forget about the &~jus just imagine that there's all this free floating &~per modalities so like in this room there'd be about what five times six or so thirty thirty or so modalities floating around don't worry about who they're lumped with .
and &-uh and if if more than one of those can detect a feature <or if> or if it seems like one xxx it seems to be a polymodal feature .
and so so so in the image case <what seems weird> what seems weird about an image &-uh so what seems ghostly about it <is that> <is that> &-um is that it seems monomodal .
&-uh &-uh this is a surprising kinda hm robust &-uh claim that when you try to express what +...
&-uh when you try to say what what <when you> when you imagine something when you form an image or do what we call that &-um and ask what seems weird about this thing why doesn't it seem like a physical object in my head ?
&-uh &-uh &-um &-uh you can try a bunch of things that seem kinda strange locations does it seem to be faded ?
and none of those I don't think work .
what what what does best for expressing what's weird is that your +//.
it seems that you can see it and it seems that only you can see it and it seems that you can only see it .
it doesn't seem to have a sound doesn't seem to have a feel you know you can't right .
and similarly when you &~h <when you> when you &-uh &-uh when you &-uh have a song in your head it doesn't seem you can see it and so forth .
contrast that with you know a car zooming by it seems that you can both see and hear it .
&-um &-uh and sort_of +//.
each kind of test case well what if you imagine a loud car roaring by .
and &-uh &-uh &-uh you visually imagine and auditorally imagine .
still in that case I wanna say <that the> &-uh that the images you get don't relate to one another the way that don't cohere the way the car does (be)cause (be)cause if you do it I'll let +//.
give you a chance to do it if you do it then then the I wanna say the sound seems to come from the top of your head and &-uh &=laughs and &-uh and the sound image it seems it's got a location .
all seems to be up here .
and the visual image seems to be sort_of somewhere right you know between your eyelids you know just behind your eyelids or something .
so just close your eyes and imagine a &-um you know start on one side of your head xxx you can imagine a car xxx going &=sound_effect xxx and now <don't make the sound> don't make the sound yourself now just imagine the sound .
and and it's hard to make (th)em seem to come it's hard to make the sound seem to emanate from the visual image .
it seems to me .
&-uh &-uh but I mean nothing I'm gonna say hangs on that but it's just a &-uh &-uh &-um: (be)cause this is (be)cause even the distinction &~m monomodal and polymodal features is just also a substitute to to for something to come later .

oh you +/.

+, &-uh the person who &-uh has a traumatic experience and the event flashes through their minds right ?
with the crash and the the sight and the sound .

+, &-um at least the the sound <and and> and and and and and the the visual images .
&-uh and I don't know if there's anything sort_of peculiar about memory +/.
+, if there's any difference if if if &-uh a vivid memory might have a a different way of connecting thing and &-uh just bringing together what's an imaginary imaginary scene .
well an explosion all around you is just gonna be &~loc hard to locate it's gonna seem like you're gonna be when you try to imagine it .
&-uh imagine especially if you imagine shards entering your body from all directions or you're imagining it all around you .
<I don't know if> it would be quite right to say although how it might be tempting to say that you were visually imagining it from all directions (be)cause you know your visual field doesn't go all around your body your head .
but ⌊ <I will argue> ⌋ .
⌈ <well in this case its the> ⌉ &=laughs debris flying by .
so particularly your +//.
you were there in a car or something and the windshield ⌊ shattered ⌋ ?
⌈ yeah ⌉ and and that one obviously is +//.
the sound is all around you so it's not +/.
yeah .
+, &-uh &-uh but I I can think of instances where &-uh actually I'm not quite sure what I think of one where I xxx remember plenty of instances where you hear the the the screech of the tire skidding and then the crash .
although I don't recall an instance where I've actually turned around and seen the cars collide .
&-um but sort of my my query is whether in a memory like that whether it be the the same element of sort_of dislocation or &-um <as in> &~a and +/.
+, and .
because it's a memory of a +//.
an episodic memory of a specific event ?
or +...
⌊ cause everything you imagine is going to be based in your memory ⌋ .
⌈ it's more the form of a question I'm I'm suggesting that there may be a difference ⌉ the way in which &-uh the degree to which &~m &~m modalities seem to be formed it may be related to whether or not you're &-uh recalling something from memory .
or whether you're imagining something you haven't seen and then you sort_of add on the sound to it it it seems that <there's a> there's a certain amount of artificiality .
<in the> in the that was just sort of a question of mine .
I I I yeah it it it might be that this conjecture that &-uh that monomodality captures what seems ghostly about +...
alleged phenomenal objects like images is wrong .
<that could be> that could be said <that could be> that could be right .
&-uh &-um but &-um &-um the the &-uh I don't mean it's yet shown to be right by a particular case like this because &-um because &-um &-um the question +...
see yeah ?
yeah .
<in the> in the original car going by going zoom case I was just asking you to think about where is the car image where is the visual car image and where is the auditory car image and are they in the same place ?
that's a crude way to ask what really matters which is does the visual does the picture of the car seem loud ?
&-um &-uh &-um <does the> &~ca does the alleged car image seem to be making noise ?
&-uh &-uh &-uh and this this question about where they are is just proxy because if the sound is completely somewhere else it +//.

&-um and and and &-um &-um this is just that the &-uh +...
reason I detour both through mental nonmental and monomodal polymodal is because I have so much trouble getting people to see what I mean about the transparency illusion .
&-um &-um so <I don't wanna> &~i I don't wanna return to that quite yet &-uh &-um those difficulties will come .
&-um &-um the the .
can I just say +/.
yeah .

sort_of theoretically it's clear to me that when I think I see sort_of a milky white green &-uh sort_of the blackboard &-uh green board &-uh up there .

well I'm convinced by the sort_of what I know about how sight works that in fact &-uh I'm I'm not reaching out and grabbing it but the experience is taking place in here in a similar kind of way in which the experience is taking place in here when I imagine something green .
&-um so it's it's it's not as though my &~ex my experience reaches out &-uh but my experience hasta be in here <of the> of the green .
though it doesn't seem to be in here it seems to be out there .
⌊ the projection ⌋ .
⌈ your experience seems to be out there ⌉ ?
no no .

regular old perception case .
alright .
+, it doesn't it it it doesn't seem as though something is happening in my head which is &-uh sort_of the experience of greenness .
I mean talk about when ordinary perception I'm having &~exp the the the distinction between ⌈ the color out there and and my subjective awareness of ⌉ .
⌊ well I can see where you'd be +//.

I agree this much that it doesn't seem to you like there is both a green blackboard and a green image .
but it does quite easily seem that there is both a green blackboard and an experience of the green blackboard .
so you can have an experience that wasn't made of an image .
&-uh &-um and and well <if you> if you do sometime turn to the initial part of the discussion of transparency &-um &-uh &-um sometime +//.
you see sometimes people like Harmon and Tye who &-uh will quote GE Moore saying &-um &-um &-um when we try to introspect our experience all we get are the outside <or the> or the the environmental &~feat &-uh objects .
features +/.
right .
+, we try to &~i &~i &~intr we try to someone &~s &~s someone says you know focus on the &-um blackboard now focus on your experience of the blackboard and you don't do anything different .
&=laughs:SUm you just keep looking at the blackboard it seems like there's nothing +//.
it can seem initially anyway like there's nothing but the blackboard .
&-uh &-uh &-um certainly nothing you can focus on or attend to .
it's just to say there's unlike a case where someone can say it's different from a nontransparent case with something +//.
you you look out a window pane someone says you know now focus on the tree now focus on the windowpane and you can do something different especially if there's +//.
if it's not quite transparent there's a screen or smudge or something like that .
but you can't do that the claim is with experience +...
but Moore says and and people drop this part of it says &~w &~s &~s experience is not quite transparent you can at least detect introspectively that you are representing the tree or that you are experiencing the tree and I would add you know &~y you could detect the way you're experiencing the tree like that you're seeing it rather than smelling it feeling it ⌈ and so forth ⌉ .
+, ⌊ right right right ⌋ +/.
+, or that you're seeing it blurrily rather than or double &{l=SIC doublededly@n$adv &}l=SIC rather than &-uh &-um rather than clearly and undoubledly &-um .
&~y you could you can be aware that you're having the experience of green .
right .
⌈ by introspection ⌉ .

+, right right right +/.
+, on <on the> on the ⌈ second remove ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yes yes ⌋ +/.
+, on the second remove you're simply aware that you are having this experience of green not that you .
in a perceptual case what this book's saying is that the only &~f when you +//.
when you try to introspect the normal case of perception you only detect the two +//.
the following two kinds of features .
&-um either features that &-um &-um seem stuck on objects .
they seem to be &-uh independent of your perception and not sort of floating in the air between you and the object you're focusing on and they seem to be something you don't &-uh you you don't create or participate in in any way .
<it seems> to be &~ou &~ou outside so <you detect> you detect those kind of features and you detect the property &-uh that you have of representing them .
okay ?
&-uh and that's it .
so when people say you know when when when people say if you like Peacock maybe <if you> if you attend to your visual experience you will notice it has certain intrinsic features or something like that that's what they say doesn't happen .
&-uh .
the two +//.
maybe you already mentioned before the blurriness .
we're not tempted to attribute the blurriness to the object .
right .
+, and for those of us who wear glasses have nearsighted take the glasses off things distant seem seem seem blurry .
but it's not as though there I'm tempted to say that the blurriness is out there .
there was a joke once &~o on David Letterman did a a monologue joke once where he says you know &-uh &-uh this new reports from NASA about the Hubble telescope you know say that you know what they've discovered is that space is really blurry .
&=laughs:multiple .
so &-um .
our best telescopes confirm .
right .
so it wasn't a waste of money .
&-um okay the the yeah &-um (0.5) blibliblibli@o .
so are people willing to grant that that say clarity or doubled a double image or or blurriness that ⌈ that is different than the ⌉ .
⌊ they don't they ⌋ Tye will say +...
mm Tye wants to say about &-um blurriness doubledness or and even the difference between &~de detecting the modality with which you are representing these pure object side features .
&-uh &-uh &-uh like being able to tell whether you're seeing it or feeling it &~th all of those have to +//.
he wants to reduce all those cases to +//.
to explain all those cases in terms of just pure &-uh object properties and the bare relation of representing them .
so in a +//.
so <he says> he says you so you &~a if you ask him what's your account of how we know whether we're seeing a curve or feeling a curve ?
he's gonna say well you know that in sight you detect not just shape but color .
or reflectance or whatever .
and and in feeling you detect not just shape but temperature or something like this .
and so and you know that well if you're if you have an experience that's dew in shape and temperature it must be &~feel feeling .
and that's what looks like the indirect way how you tell whether you're feeling something or seeing something .
&-um or you have some pressure or sensation so you detect sort of rigidity in shape <and so forth> but you don't see rigidity or see temperature .
in the case of blurriness or doubleness he says some things like that but I don't remember exactly what it's something like &-um &-uh in +//.
well in the case of doubleness <you see> you see &-um &-uh an object as having location one and as having location two .
&-um they can &~contr that can be a contradictory property on your +//.
nobody says your xxx suggestion <hasta be> accurate .
but &-uh especially not what's a graded case to begin with .
but &-um &-uh you're not detecting that you have two images or even two experiences I guess .
you're just the entire content of your introspection &~every is there's something that that there's something there and there .
and I am representing that it is there .
and I am representing that it is also there .
so and that's what's going on <when you> <when you> when you detect that that you're seeing double .
&-uh blurriness it's it's like you're you &~y .
&~s &~s so what what's being represented <when you> when you &~s &~s I mean there's the ⌈ you occasionally see the tissue ⌉ .

&~inter interesting case &~al along that line is the the the sweatshirts that are intentionally printed so it looks like it's blurred .

mhm +/.

there's some kind of representation xxx like that going on .
&-uh as opposed to when you put pressure on your eyes and you have .
he's incredibly ingenious <did you> did you go to his talk ⌈ xxx few weeks ago ⌉ ?
⌊ I didn't ⌋ I was in there for the q@l and a@l afterwards .
yeah (be)cause I mean +...
I don't remember all the details but &-uh you have objections from xxx saying things like well exactly this kind of thing can't can't +//.
it's childish saying that Tye can't recapture the apparent difference between having a blurry vision of a clear object and a clear image a clear vision of a blurry object or something .
and Tye said well you know I do xxx I don't remember his xxx but yeah that's relevant <and it> and it may come up in the I gave you a whole stack of Tye stuff last time .
mhm +/.
+, you can read more of that but &-uh &-um I don't know if that stuff about blurriness is is in the exchange between Block and Tye or where he's xxx all that .
but &-um yeah you might +...
at least when we try to read when we read him we might try to &~th think about whether that's an objection .
&-um well +...
&=sighs &-um (0.11) well .
earlier I diverted the conversations to say a little bit about transparency and you were gonna talk about &-uh image .
if you wanna go back ⌈ to the image a little bit ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ I'm looking at what I have written down on the images and thinking that we probably have that all covered .
the &-um +...
&-um there are people who say we don't have an image illusion .
who say that all we have is a &-um a loose way of talking .
so both Tye and Block say this &~th they they both +//.
we all wanna ask the question why is it +//.
why do we talk as if we have red images loud noises in our head .
&-uh &-uh &-um you know &-uh warm feelings sharp pains and things like that .
&-uh &-uh &-uh &-uh and they their their account is &-um is well is that it's kinda loose talk .
this this talk what we have and what we realize we have or &-um states that represent redness loudness sharpness warmth .
but &~i there's a sort_of very general +...
respect in which we say we we we talk of a representation of f_ness@n as being an F representation .
f@l ish@n$adj representation .
so &-uh Block gives a good example of a &-um nude painting .
which is really a painting of nudity .
or a &-uh or &-um some other thing I've looked at nude paintings but I've never heard of loud oscilloscope reading .
that's another one he gives as a xxx some kind of xxx puts puts &-uh marks on the page and the technicians and so forth reading the thing will say oh that was a &~l there was a loud one now it's a quiet one .
you know &-uh &-uh where and if you walked in and said but they're they're all equally humming at the same volume xxx they +//.
they'd you know they'd say come on stop joking .
but so so Block and Tye thinks that's what's going on and Tye even says you know we we save breath by talking of a yellow image rather than an image of yellowness .
save the the of@q and the ness@q .
longer lives .
the &-uh &-uh &-uh but but &-um &-um but there really do seem to be perceptuallike@n$adj illusions rather than loose talk because <we say> we say the image &~y &~y &~vis we say our visual images look red .
&-uh &-uh &-um and we say you know the sounds in our head sound +...
you know &-uh &-uh high pitched or whatever &-uh &-uh &-um but we don't say the oscilloscope reading sounds loud .
we say we call it a loud oscilloscope reading sure .
but I assume .
but but but I also assume we don't really say it sounds loud .
&-uh &-uh &-um that's one thing .
a more telling thing is this if we really +...
were interested in saving breath then we'd say oh say take your belief that bananas are yellow you'd you'd you'd be tempted to call that a yellow belief .
or a yellow banana belief or something .
but you don't .
&-uh &-uh &-um <or your> &-uh or your &-um &-uh &-um yeah .
it doesn't seem to be <that you're> that you're not what I in that other paper called the nonphenomenal ⌈ state ⌉ .
⌊ yeah economy ⌋ economy can't be the explanation +/.
right +/.

(0.6) .
right well I'm glad it doesn't seem plausible to you but I don't know if that would be a good response .
I mean +...
well what seems seems least plausible xxx when you talk about &-uh the loud oscilloscope &-uh reading &-uh &-uh there &~i it's <when we> when we draw our attention to the oscilloscope we're not tempted to say that it itself is loud .
but if we draw our attention to ⌈ whatever ⌉ +/.
+, the image is there the the the the desire to say no it really does look red &-uh remains .
right .
yeah that's so that's why I think what's going on is really an illusion case .
mkay .
I &-um ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ does ⌋ does an illusion as you use the term illusion need to have any phenomenal character to it ?
it's not built into the notion of illusion that it's phenomenal .
no &-uh &-uh &-uh &-um &-um all I &~i and I don't +//.
actually you don't even care whether the appearance is false and &-uh that's for the larger aim of arguing for inner perception you're gonna need inner perception even if there really are red images &-uh in your head .
&-um .
you wouldn't be able to see them so you'd hafta &=laughs +/.
<have inner> +/.
+, right .
but &-um &-um but &-uh and there's also some funny stuff about calling it an illusion rather than a hallucination properly speaking it's +//.
these are hallucinations on the same view it's not that there's it's not like where where the hallucination like an oasis case there's nothing there dominantly responsible for the experience +/.
right +/.
+, you're cooking the whole object up as well and in the illusion case there is you know the magician's hand or whatever and you think it's a dove or whatever .
now &~y &~y &~y or you see there's an object causing the experience you get its properties <from it> that's an illusion case that's typically distinguished when there's no object there at all the dagger the nondagger &-uh &-uh &-uh that's a &~hallu a hallucination case .
it's not like Macbeth wasn't under an illusion that there was a dagger there in one sense of the word right not like he saw the vase as a dagger .
&=laughs &-uh &-uh &-um he was hallucinating from scratch you know .
and in that &~s these are &~pr probably hallucinations rather than illusions but that's also just terminology that ⌈ <it &~doe doesn't matter> ⌉ .
⌊ what what ⌋ what's an example of of an illusion say that wouldn't have phenomenal character to it ?
oh oh &-um &-um &-uh +...
I I I'm happy to say there could be subliminal illusions &-uh &-uh &-uh &-um or that a robot can suffer from illusion I mean &~i &~i &~i if there was a robot or a pigeon or something that some +//.
suppose we somehow knew it didn't have phenomenal consciousness .
it could still be under an illusion that &~there the Mueller Lire illusion and so forth .
&-uh &-uh &-uh or .
so in one sense of it being being under an illusion is ⌈ <to be mistaken> ⌉ .
⌊ <it's a illusion is to say a false> ⌋ it's a false representation .
that's all I mean .
xxx .
but part again there there there are illusions I mean part of what's okay if illusion can sometimes be used <to mean> xxx you're you're mistaken you thought something was the case but it wasn't the case &-um but &-um there is another sense of what &~i visual illusion .
something seems to you to be something or to be some way it's not in fact .
&-um the the usual way <in which> you talk about that is the things out there aren't the way in which they seem to us .
you think you see water and it's in fact the the the heat rising off the the desert that gives this &-uh illusion to you of of water .
there's something outside which is giving giving rise to it but you're you're you're misinterpreting it .
&-um but in that case you still have the the phenomenal +//.
there's a phenomenal experience .
yeah +/.
yeah +/.
+, in most cases when +//.
but that's just to say in most cases when you visually represent there's there's phenomenal there but but some cases not .

yeah right suppose xxx apart from whether or not you can have &~nonphenon nonphenomenal &-uh sorta perceptual &-uh when when I think of the &-uh &-uh &-uh I imagine a red fire truck or a red object a red ball or something like that &-um &-uh the to say that it's an illusion that it's red &-um &-uh the +...
I mean regardless of whether there's anything red it's not a matter of my being wrong about whether there was something red .
if I thought there was something red in my head that would be an illusion <in the> in the sort_of objective reference sense .
but to say it didn't +//.
it wasn't really red it just seemed red seems to be &~a an impossible turn of speech .
that <if it> if it seems red than it seems red and I may be mistaken about &-uh it referring to anything .
but if it &~i at least <there's a> there's a a prima_facie@s:lat &-uh I think needs to be overthrown that in fact &-uh when you seem to &-uh have an &~ex an inner experience of &-uh a red image a red ball &-uh if it seems red the the phenomenal part of it isn't just an illusion .
I mean you really did have in other words you you're not mistaken that you did have that phenomenal experience .
&-uh you're mistaken if you thought that it applied some objective object out there that actually had the the property of being red such that someone looked at it &-uh they would see something red .
&-um I didn't follow all that are you saying there's a certain &-um common sense view that you you you are daring to argue out_of ?

&=laughs you know when he's trying to bullshit you when he's xxx &=laughs:S2 okay do again ?
sorry .
do it again .
it does seem that there is a &-uh &-uh a reality to the subjective experience that I have .
that means it does seem that the experience exists .
the experience exists +/.
⌈ we agree on that ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ now ⌋ is it the experience of something else other than just the experience there it doesn't seem to me that it is of something else other than the experience .
so .
all I wanna know is does the experience seem red ?
does the experience seem red .
all you've told me so far about this experience is that it exists .
does it seem to have any other features ?
like having a color ?
⌈ if it does ⌉ .
⌊ yeah I'm not quite sure ⌋ how to ferret out whether the experience is red or it's an experience of red and it's not as though .
but if you say it's an experience of &~s red you gotta suppose it's an experience of a red patch or something .
I mean you don't hafta suppose that there really is a patch but it's but all I want is that you got an experience and according to that experience there is something red .
⌈ so if you go that route you can see it ⌉ .
⌊ yeah yeah &~ph phenomenally ⌋ right right &~ph phenomenally &-uh +/.
even +/.
+, it's an experience of something red .
yeah that's all I'm saying .
but there's nothing red there really so it's an illusion .
well there's nothing physically red .
I don't understand nonphysically red what do you mean physically red .
⌈ I only said the word redness ⌉ .
⌊ I +//.
I'm not sure <I understand> I understand ⌋ what to make of an experience &-uh but there +//.
<when I have> when I have &-uh an image of a red ball &-um there is the subjective state that I'm in the experience that I'm having at that moment .
which &-uh the part of the the the mystery of how mind relates to to matter is that it's not connected to things in the way in which you +//.
a red ball and I'm looking at a red ball I could you know if other people look at it we can do light waves and all that kind of thing (be)cause <when I'm> when I'm forming an image in my mind I have the experience of a red ball .
&-uh it's it seems disconnected which is part of what makes the whole quandary of images and conscious experiences &-uh so puzzling .
but when one says you don't really have it you just seem to it it &-uh it seems to be using &-uh it's either using seem in a &~non nonphenomenological sense within which I'm just making a faulty judgment .
&-uh and there I can +//.
it doesn't seem that I'm making a faulty judgment that that it seems red .
&-uh it really does seem red .
&-um &-uh the other would be to say that somehow I'm using seem in a phenomenological sense of seem rather than just a judgment sense &-uh but then you still have the the phenomenological qualities at least some sort of phenomenological qualities &-uh &-uh of red &-uh shape the the spherical shape .
so &~th xxx it seems that we have two options of saying that it's an illusion either you say it's an illusion <in a> in a judgment sense where it doesn't represent something else but that the other one saying that it doesn't even have a seeming to it it doesn't even have &-uh &-uh the phenomenal sense of an illusion to it .
&-um &-um what's the conclusion ?
again ?
or .
the conclusion is that the the fact that it seems a certain way sort_of Thomas Nagel's &-uh there's a fact of subjective experience which is a fact about the real world and how we incorporate it into &-uh into our metaphysical scheme .
&-uh that's another question but he contends and it it seems undeniable to me that there are facts of subjective experience that I have a the the there's a fact about my experience that it seems to be of a red sphere when I form the image .
(0.6) .
okay I don't know what you're +//.
if that's your conclusion we we +//.
<if that> if that really is your conclusion we don't disagree because all I'm saying is &=laughs all I'm saying so far there is when you imagine when you visually when you visualize you visually imagine red ball .

okay &-um &-uh but now so all I'm saying <is that> these two facts about that case and &-um and that's enough for me to say this state is an illusory state what it says is false .
which one of these claims then if either are you denying ?
(0.6) maybe you .
I think I'm very much inclined to say that there is something straight in my mind .
alright alright +/.
+, what what that image is &-uh as long as mind doesn't get pressed into saying there's something in my you know brain with a physical characteristic that someone or some neurosurgeon could look at it .
then it seems though there's a reality to the mind within which you could say there is a &-uh &-uh red sphere ⌊ in my mind ⌋ .
⌈ I &~comm I commend ⌉ you for having a proof of the existence of the soul .
you know you have just discovered you're just +//.
you've discovered what I think is the coolest argument for dualism in the world <it's a> &~v it's a very simple argument you just imagine &-uh you_know so you know you imagine step one you imagine or you've probably read this this before in &~earl you imagine a a banana .
you detect that you just in other words you form a banana image you detect the image that is curved or yellow you &~f just step two you find that there's nothing exhaustively search your body and brain and light cone and the physical &~real surroundings and discover that there's nothing causally relevant that's curved yellow etcetera .
and so you include +//.
conclude that that image can't be anything physical in your neighborhood including yourself .
so it's gotta be in some other realm of existence and so forth .
<if you> if you wanna say there is something straight in your mind and you also as it sounds are happy to deny that there is anything straight in your brain and body and environment and so forth .
then you've got to say that that thing that you've claimed there is your mind is somewhere else or nowhere or something like that right and so and it so so so you know ⌊ that's close enough to saying that xxx ⌋ .
⌈ I don't see <I don't> I don't ⌉ I don't see why I have to say it's it's it's somewhere else .
&-uh I mean I I'm not a I'm not totally closed to a substance dualism view .
&-uh but I'm I'm not inclined towards a substance dualism view .
well then where is this thing that's straight .
is isn't what's behind that some kind_of a property sharing view of representation ?
that you got it .
right so you have genuine properties <of of> of of ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ yeah ⌉ that that that whatever whatever thing in your head represents a yellow banana is itself yellow .
and it's only by virtue of that only by virtue of sharing the properties .

I mean that's my way of making sense of what's going on ⌊ about that ⌋ .
⌈ it ⌉ doesn't even share the property +//.
I mean take a color xxx whether primary secondary it doesn't seem to make ⌊ xxx ⌋ +/.

⌈ &-uh I mean +...
xxx <I think you just confuse yourself by switching to color> ⌉ .
if you're gonna make &~a if you stick stick with .
I think the same lessons can be drawn from both primary and alleged secondary but &~be because there's there's straightness and there's how straightness seems just like there's reflectance .
and there's how reflectance seems and you may wanna call that latter thing color red and so forth rather than the former thing and you may wanna call curvature .
it's just <you know> <there's there's> there's there's you know &-uh &-um shape and there's reflectance and then there's you know the various looks or whatever of these things .
and it just so happens that a word like red might apply to this rather than that maybe and a word like &~s round might apply to this rather than that but that's just accidental .
&-uh you_know it's &-uh it doesn't show that that that there's a difference .
<in the> in the two kinda cases .
but &-um but and and and .

I agree I &~a this this I I add this third claim you know &-uh &-uh &-um &-um &=writes:board I am imagining straightness .
that's true according to me .
that's true because of this .
this is irrelevant right that's true just when you have certain constrained kinds of states so it's not just you know I guess or something <like that> .
you know there is a visual &~imagina it comes from a certain faculty of the mind or the visual imaginative state that says something is straight then that's good enough for you to &~imag to be imagining straightness .
but what I deny is that &=writes:board I have a straight +...
image I wanna say that's false so I'm distinguishing these two things .
⌈ maybe that wasn't clear ⌉ .
⌊ okay what ⌋ what is to have an imaginative state .

saying that there is &~wh <when I> when I &-uh imagine a straight when I have a straight line in my head .

&-um that doesn't seem to me to be captured by saying there is a visual imaginative state unless I'm sneaking back in with imaginative the content of what ⌈ I wanna xxx ⌉ .
⌊ visual means ⌋ visual means if you do it with you know &-uh &-uh &-um with your visual system .
it needn't be phenomenal or anything imaginative means that it's not perceptual but it's endogenous or something like this alright .
so &-uh &-uh &-um &-um a dream I would count as an imaginative ⌈ state xxx ⌉ .
⌊ okay ⌋ let's let's take visual internal state +/.
⌈ alright alright alright ⌉ +/.

yeah now X I just did as a shorthand but I I we ⌈ haven't talked about ⌉ .

or .
I just meant X to mean something is straight .
but it's actually true that something is straight in the universe I mean that I am &~exp that +...
&-uh &-uh &-uh and and &-uh but roughly I mean that you know that &-uh I have an image in &~h you know in here that is straight .
that's what I really mean for X .
so I have a visual internal state affirming I have an image ⌈ of that which is straight ⌉ .
⌊ <there is some straight> ⌋ there is some straight in here I'm experiencing straight .
or that there is some straight in here .
yeah &~i &~i &~i &~i it the I is probably also misleading it should be you know &-uh an image is straight or something like that .
okay so there is a state which &-uh &-uh is affirming that there is a straight image .
yeah that's what I think (i)s going on even when there is no straight image .
yeah and it seems that what's happened there is that the phenomena has the phenomenal &-uh feel one might say has dropped out .
well that's your theory but I'm gonna claim that this explains phenomenal .
&-uh &-uh &-uh &-um <I'm sorry> if you think see if you think that this hasta be &~tru tell me &~whe at what &~poi &-um I'm gonna point to things you tell me at what point has the has +//.
have I denied that there's phenomenality .
here ?
it can't be that already right here I've denied that there's &~phenome ⌈ it can't be here ⌉ .
⌊ it looks like it ⌋ .
it &~l &~l &~l looks like that one .
all I've said is that there is a state <there could be> &~an there could be any number of other things in addition .
let let's start here .
certainly this claim is compatible with there being phenomenal consciousness .
I'm imagining straightness that that doesn't deny yet .
add this claim .
it just says a little more about this it doesn't say what there isn't it's down here where I &~s or up here where I say where &~wh that there isn't something .
so if you're gonna say that it's this part this denial of this that says (be)cause see this &~pa this claim here doesn't say that this state is false or anything .
it's this part that together with this says the state is false .
so now &~wh when I'm down here I'm starting to deny stuff .
if you think that this denial means denying that there's phenomenality then you're thinking that phenomenality requires images with these kind of features .
and you're +//.
and then &~s so there's your &~arg you can do a +//.
you can write your own book other than &~Chalmer like to the same effect as Chalmers and get from taking phenomenal consciousness seriously straight to dualism .
yeah it's it's the there is a +//.
there is a visual internal state +...
that affirms a proposition &~inste the proposition &-uh it doesn't gonna have any phenomenal quality in that brackets is there ?
or does it get snuck in in the brackets that you have visual state affirms +/.
+, the the the phenomenal content .
okay yeah but the state doesn't deny that there's something it just says there's this .
⌈ but certainly there's <more than what> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but you're right yeah ⌋ nothing here says I don't think anything here says this just says there's a certain object with certain a feature .
no but <I can> I can say affirm that there is a &-uh red spherical ball and &-uh do it quickly enough or in a way in which I don't form an image of a red spherical ball .
and it seems as though all that statement is saying is there's an internal state that's affirming the proposition of a red spherical ball which doesn't seem to include the phenomenal character of what in fact is going on and what I'm imagining .
okay I I I I hear that claim .
uhuh +/.
+, &-um &-uh I I &-um I understand that it's not that it doesn't seem to include phenomena I have to argue and did a little bit last week +/.
+, right right +/.
+, and would have a little bit today argued that this explains &-um phenomenality .
but you don't yet have a reason to deny this claim .
+, ⌈ <yeah but I &~wi I &~wi> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ if all you've said all you're saying ⌋ now is that that this is not +//.
&~e even if you're right I don't think you are from what you're suspecting but even if you're right this claim is not &-um all your your complaint is that this claim is not the whole truth about the universe fine .
I just wanna know whether it's true .
if it's true and if <and if> and if this is true then this is a false claim .
whatever else is true .
(be)cause you know &~th not +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, not that this is a false claim but this state is false .
⌈ that's fine this state is false <these states> xxx ⌉ .
⌊ &~p part of the issue &~p part part of the issue ⌋ is what what is in fact the content of that second statement .
and if if if you're right that that phenomenality is present there even though it doesn't seem to be at first glance .
this state says something is straight in my brain or mind or soul or body .
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that's ⌋ what this state says .
yeah and you you're suggesting that that constitutes phenomenality .
I haven't argued for that yet +/.
right +/.
+, all I want is that there is such a state and what you may deny but only on pain of why I think incoherence &~bu because I &~s I was charitably saying you got a proof of the existence of the soul but it's it's incredible that there be something with a spatial property in this nonspatial &~ob I mean that doesn't make +//.
a soul doesn't help you here either so I think it really is incoherent to say that there's in the case of describe something straight in my soul or brain or something you know <&-uh &-uh> &-uh &-uh &-um I mean not incoherent (be)cause we could have found something straight in one's brain or on Alpha Centauri that through unknown channels is affecting you .
but given that it's not in the physical world and now the physical world not even help .
&-uh &-uh &-um so &-uh &-um &-um &-um but given just that point which is easy to secure and the claim that it seems to you ⌈ xxx straight xxx ⌉ .
⌊ yeah what's easy to secure is is is the straight ⌋ the straightness is not a physical straight and it +/.
what ?
where ?
+, that this this now that one +/.
+, where ?
+, the the the first one +/.
+, this one +/.
+, nothing is straight it's in either in my brain or Alpha Centauri .
this is shape this means shape man .
&-uh &-uh &-um and I know nothing +//.
&~i &~o if we <we could> <we could> we could I can demonstrate some straight things to you but I'm not making a distinction between phenomenal and nonphenomenal physical and nonphysical straightness .
straight means you know an edge that lies along the shortest path between two points and so forth you know .
&-um that's one thing .
yeah &~i &~i &~i <an extent> ⌈ that xxx me that the ⌉ +/.
⌊ and there's nothing with that feature ⌋ +/.
+, straight and &~th and the straight that exists in my mind is an edge that lies along the the the shortest line between .
okay then then give me my words straight if you want me to choose a different noise for that feature I will .
all I care about is that it seems to you like there's something with that feature .
but there's nothing with that feature .
if you wanna take every word I use and give it a second meaning and deny the claims in those other meanings fine but &~y then we're not arguing .
&-uh &-uh &-uh &-um okay ?
so so &-um &-um I mean that was sorta the whole point of trying to do +//.
go to this to stick with shape was that it was something we could hold fixed if you switch to color then you're swapping between too easily &~betwe reflectance and disposition and you know &~th it's up in the air what the word red means what &~sh part of the world it carves .
that's why I wanna stick &~w part of why I wanted to stick with shape talk .
&-um and and yeah yeah absolutely I mean these two words to mean the same thing in the two claims .
so you know there's another word I mean if I'm gay then you know there's &~some <if I'm> if I'm I'm sorry if I'm heterosexual then there's something you know straight about me but that's just a pun right ?
and in the same way some kind of phenomenal straightness or whatever you wanna say is also just a pun +...
well &~pa &~pa part of what <makes it> makes it hard to to say that there's something straight <is that> is that straight it's it's it's it's a boundary to some area &-uh &-uh so you measure black and white with a straight sort of line between so you go from from one to the next or &~y you can imagine sort_of a black line in a white space &-uh &-uh those those kinds of things .
&-uh &-uh but if you try to have straight just by itself I mean it have to has +//.
you have to &~ha have some width to the line to be able to imagine it so it's +...
that's alright but +/.
uhuh +/.
+, now you're really reaching &~bec I mean does that really seem relevant to the claims I'm making ?
&~i I ⌈ didn't &~sa ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ it's ⌋ +/.
+, this state doesn't say the thing isn't thick let it be thick .
and straight and thick .
there's nothing straight or thick .
you know <in the world> .
so I don't understand where you're +...
yeah <when I> when I have +//.
<when I> when I imagine +//.
close my eyes and imagine a black line &-uh with some red to it +/.
okay ?
+, &-uh the experience <that I> that I'm having is not simply a mental state that is &~fir affirming &-uh &-uh something that that &~i if if I'm gonna have a mental state affirming something that in fact captures what was going on when I was ⌈ imagining xxx ⌉ .
the entire ⌊ xxx ⌋ I didn't mean I am not +//.
at no point did I mean what goes between these dinky little parentheses to capture the entire content of this state or all it's kinfolk &~kin kindred states .
but did you mean &~th &~th that it captures or you want it to capture in any way the phenomenal ?
no no no +/.
no +/.
+, all I'm trying to say is you're under an illusion .
what do I need in_order_to establish you're under an illusion ?
you are you have a state that's false .
here is the state that's false whatever other states are around it or whatever else this state says .
if you conjoin other things if you say the state says this plus more it's not gonna make it true all of a sudden <if at> if at one conjunct is false it's false .
so &~th so so so right ?

that state's gonna be false even if it doesn't mention physicality .

anything that's analogous in any sense to space ?
&=laughs or &-uh or by analogue you mean what the the mental &-um &-um representation of space ?
because if &~y if that's what you're really analogue talk is doing duty for then all you're telling me after all that is that &=laughs:S3 this mental picture part represents straightness .

that would be fine I can even imagine that .
&-uh &-uh &-uh &-um so so whereas a fold would be at a particular point of place &~a and not elsewhere it would be spatially related to the nonfolded part but if if what you you +//.
take your pick .
you can have it .
I'll give you this much if you wanna say there's that all this is a demonstration from you know from this from the &~intuit from introspection that you know there must be a &-uh an extra realm of space that's if if if this is the way you wanna go not neither here nor there &=laughs:multiple that it &~ri &~ri &~ri it's somewhere it's it's it's .
yeah it &~s seems that you you're ⌊ resist ⌋ +/.
⌈ and ⌉ +/.
+, very strongly the notion that you can have a mental analogue to something physical without actually being the physical .
oh I no I don't resist the idea that there is this mental analogue .
I insist that there are just way too many mental analogues you know .
&-uh &-uh &-um so I mean any thirty dimensional if you're talking about thirty dimensional space any thirty dimensional mental any three mental dimensions so you know how much I love someone how much how how how &-uh how confident I am in their in in in their you know in their reliability you know how how much I think they owe me you know will be analogous to physical space .
not very analogous .
&=laughs:multiple ⌊ I mean xxx &~expe ⌋ +/.
⌈ okay I'm asking you ⌉ +/.
+, experientially it's not difficult at all to say no the the the visual image <of a> <of a> of a straight line is a &-uh close &~analog &-uh &-uh &-uh a mental analogue to a straight line that I might draw on this piece of paper whereas to say hot and cold ⌊ is a ⌋ .
⌈ why ⌉ why even talk about analogues if you're &~loo look if you're .
because I don't wanna create some sort of mystery space there that's off in some .
<then then> then then do you &~wa but you do wanna create straightness there and not ⌊ mere analogous to straightness ⌋ .
⌈ an analogue of ⌉ straightness .
yeah ⌊ are you +//.

+, you know ⌈ I mean is it straightness or is it &~anal ⌉ something that's ⌊ analogous to straightness ⌋ .
⌈ yeah if you if &~y ⌉ if if if &~ana if &~someth <if if> if if the analogy hasta be so tight that it literally has the same feature straightness then we have a disagreement if not I don't care what you say about it .
&=laughs you see the you gotta &~b I think you have an impossible line to walk .
&-uh &-uh &-uh and you will creatively when &~y when necessary introduce a new fudge &=laughs:multiple each time it's &~no well it's analogous it's &~nonphenom phenomenal straightness it was you_know nonphysical straightness it was you know &~a and but the pattern the overall pattern is ⌊ either it's either straight or it ain't ⌋ .
⌈ okay there's &~s &~s sort_of two two two ways ⌉ &~t two ways in which I I I I I'd sorta go at this one is is that there's some reality to the image that I have .
&-um now the question is what do I make of that alright &-um the the &-uh the visual analogue kinda spatial analogue kinda thing is a way of my trying to talk about that .
but the other part is <when I> when I look at sort of an explanation and say well what's really happening is there's a state that affirms that there is a straight line .
&-um that sounds like sort_of the proposition &-uh &-uh but doesn't capture the phenomenal character to it .
I understand that that's why you're complaining &~bu &~bu <that that's> that that's why you're complaining but that complaint is really misplaced because I wasn't at this state of the argument trying to say if you have and in fact I don't believe that I would that if this is true there is consciousness .
I'm &~i &~i &~i I wasn't trying to say that all I was trying to establish was we have a certain illusion .
and it seems that you could grant that .
&-uh &-uh &-uh (be)cause I'm not saying you know consciousness is an illusion +/.
yeah yeah yeah +/.
+, okay so we really got onto this (be)cause (be)cause it's I made it perhaps sound maybe like I was already trying .
no I know you're +//.
what you wanna &~a &~ad add some stuff by you know <the the> the the paper we were looking at last time the add enough things into it then none of the parts have any phenomenal character when you put (th)em all together +/.
right +/.
+, the claim is presto you've got it &-uh +/.
+, uhuh +/.
+, &-uh and &~a I may need to think more about that +/.
+, uhuh +/.
+, but it doesn't seem to me that you put these nonphenomenal things together and presto you got anything other than a conglomerate of &~non nonphenomenal things .
+, uhuh +/.
+, so in looking at this it's true that that your argument that you hafta have more in terms of the conditions to actually have &-uh &-uh phenomenality coming out_of it .
okay you're objecting to &-uh +/.
⌊ more presentational xxx ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ you're my objecting to my ⌉ theory which is not even as far as this paper concerns on &~th on the table for discussion yet .
I it's fine (be)cause we're loose and we can talk about it in any order I mean we are .
but &-um but but it matters to me for other reasons that I have a way of &-um convincing people that there's that certain what I'm calling data this &-uh has some reality to it .
&-uh &-um &~a &~a exists .
and &-um and and then you can talk about explaining it .
so so so just you can have the last word &-um &~ho what I promised not to do is to say ahhah you've conceded you know my entire world view or something &-uh &-uh do you see what I mean by saying there's an image illusion and do you ⌊ still disagree that there is one .
where where an image illusion is ⌋ .
⌈ does &~tha if if if in fact ⌉ my my &-um &-um &-uh spatial analogue this is in as dire straits as &-uh as you say it is .
&-uh &-uh I think my next move on that would be to say when I say it's an analogue to a straight line is that when I draw a line on this piece of paper with a magic marker &-uh &-uh and I compare the the the &-uh image that I have of this black line is that the experiential &-uh &-um state is &-uh &~i very closely analogous .
and there may be whether this has the same &~cr crispness or distinctness to it .
&-uh I'm not gonna say it's exactly the same but to say well you don't have a &~g any any content analogue &-uh it seems that it's precisely that that gives the content to it .
and when you say okay this piece of paper has spatial you know you can measure it this way .
but you can't measure the the thing you've done in your head .
&-uh I can't take a ruler to it .
but the experiential state when I'm imagining it is very closely analogous to this .
and part of what was characteristic of my looking at the line on the piece of paper was that it has <it's a> it's a spatial image <that I'm> that I'm that I'm having when I'm looking at the line on the paper and when I have +//.
when I formulate the image in my mind it also has that spatial characteristic to it .
now you start asking well okay where is it ?
&-um that &-uh raises the whole conundrum of well what exactly is it to have an image in your mind and the the notion that you say that it's it's an illusion &-uh .

there it's it's analogous to the kind of characteristics of when something &-uh &-uh looking something in a salient <and it> <and it> <and it's> and it's far away .
&-uh ⌈ <when I> when I ⌉ +/.
⌊ I have xxx ⌋ +/.
+, <when I> when I visualize a distance mountain a distant mountain in my head &-um I call it distant not because I think there's some far point inside my head &=laughs ⌈ <nothing can go very> ⌉ far inside my head .
⌊ okay xxx ⌋ but you might think that about your mind <for all I know> .
that my mind could extend ?
&-uh I &~d I &~d why you would find that silly but not the earlier stuff silly I I haven't &=laughs latched on to that yet .
&-um .
yeah <it's because> it's because whenever I think of the spatial characteristics of of my &-uh &-uh of my &-uh image it's not +//.
there's not literal &-uh &-uh spatial in the images <it's not> it's not .
but straightness is a literal spatial property what are you saying ?
I'm saying that the experience that I have &-uh when I'm imagining is the same experience I have when I'm looking at the line on the the piece of paper .
and that the &-uh I'm enough of a physicalist to think that what's taking place is really taking place in my brain and that somehow I project and through some projection have this this this sense that the line is out there when I'm looking at the line on the piece of paper .
but you're not enough of a physicalist to to &~conc you're &~let you let beliefs you have about the brain talk you out_of the idea that if you've ever <were attended> to it that part of your experience is far away .
but you don't let facts +//.
beliefs you have about the brain talk you out_of the idea that part of experience is say straight .
or purple .
or polka dotted or whatever .
but you make this decision .
that the brain is equally +//.
&~i the brain is as unpolkadotted@n and as unstraight as it is unfar away .
⌈ in exactly the same way ⌉ .
yeah right .
⌊ the the <&~bot the> &~bot the bottom line ⌋ the bottom line I think <in terms of> in terms of the the &-uh the very strong intuition I have <is that> is that the experiential state &-um &-uh &-uh can't be sort_of explained away as &-uh a representation I know you don't take Daniel Denett's sort_of &-uh &-uh approach where qualia just don't exist &-um &-uh you wanna say they they they do exist but then the latter part they're nothing but &-um &-uh .
well their not right if that's what's at the root of all this then I really suggest you consider &-uh trying to find a way to believe in qualia without believing that straightness hasta be a qualae@u .
that's a good challenge to end on I think .
&=laughs .
alright alright +...
yeah yeah I mean I believe in qualia but I think they are features other than distance away straightness reflectance and so forth they're just some other features .
&-uh &-uh okay .
whoo .
&=laughs:S2 I knew sooner or later you'd come out_of &-uh come out with these things I've been &~he all summer and now we've been ⌈ I've been waiting ⌉ .
⌊ well we did it ⌋ we did it <a a> a a little bit when we talked during the summer about <&-uh &-uh> &-uh &-uh Denett's &-uh qualia whether they exist or they just seem to .
yeah +/.
+, and the qualia are the seemings@n &~tha which means the seemings@n don't really exist they just seem to +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, which just doesn't fly .
and your suggestion is that that's a that may be a good critique of &-uh of Denett &-uh but the the qualia really exist when I wanna give it some &-uh the the properties that &-uh I wanna ascribe to different mental states the f@l like those &~th &~th those things .
&-uh that I I can't do so without &-uh abusing language or using language in ways that simply &-uh ⌈ not gonna work ⌉ .
⌊ this is not the fault ⌋ of &~lang this &~isn the pickle you're in with this is not English's fault .
it's it's it's &=laughs logic's fault .
&=laughs:S2 you know I think .
&~l ⌈ well logic plus ⌉ .
⌊ I I I I'm ⌋ open to being persuaded ⌈ I mean that that certainly ⌉ +/.
⌊ logic plus &-um ⌋ +/.
+, read carefully the arguments that it's a logical mistake .
well it's not &~c &~cr xxx not only logic there's also the empirical bad luck that there's nothing straight in the brain .
you coulda lucked out .
eh if there were straight things in my brain that wouldn't help me .
⌈ I think that's &~f ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ unless I unless ⌋ I think there's some sort of eye in the brain looking at this straight thing in my brain .
so even if there were straight things in my brain that's not gonna help at all .
yeah so it's it's just mysterious why that would be at all tempting to to go that way .
when I think about what actually goes on in my brain &~i it seems to me that that &-uh &-uh &-uh it's conceivable we could be recording the information in our brain in zeros and ones or xxx not really but +/.
⌈ yeah yeah xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but using sorta &~tha the ⌋ computer analogue .
&-uh and that &-uh you have zeros and ones that &~wou that that that reflect the different sort of like &-uh light frequencies .
and physically all that's going on within your brain is zeros and ones +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, &-uh but out_of that we have the subjective experience of a straight line or ⌈ <&-uh yeah> ⌉ .
⌊ I agree with all that ⌋ .
but that's of talk .
experience represents straightness .
I already got that .
&-uh I have &~to &~t represents is &~w we'll wrestle ⌈ with that some more ⌉ .
⌊ that's what we're ⌋ +/.
+, &=laughs .
yeah yeah yeah you want something in_between representing straightness and having straightness .
yeah actually I'm &~i enough of of what Searle says about information and &~ref &~re referring &-uh that I'm not sure something really &~ref one thing refers to another &-um &-uh without there being some &-uh referring for a subject or bringing in in in the
