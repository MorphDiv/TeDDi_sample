the top one two black squares . 340_1570
but over here &-um there would be a red to match on that one . 2100_6940
and then there would be a &-um or here a black to match the red . 7230_10550
okay . 11680_11820
do you see what Nathan just described with words . 12130_14540
you hopefully you were making a picture in your mind . 14580_16820
he was thinking about a core square that would have two squares of
not right next_to each_other or one above the other but kitty
two squares of black . 25740_26750
and then two squares of red . 27480_29450
making like a checkerboard pattern . 30230_31830
so his core square would be made up of four squares two black and
and then what he described for you is taking four of those core
the checkerboard . 44860_45740
the four of (th)em together would be a two by two design . 46700_51380
and they would keep that checkerboard design . 51950_53740
yeah . 53760_53990
he described for you how when the core squares went together a
and a red square would be a black square . 60280_61990
which way he picked up . 62570_63480
together you wouldn't have to like turn them and do all that stuff
you could just &-um put them in all in place . 66630_69550
okay . 70500_70590
so Nathan just found another example of how it's possible as up
so if we've just seen this way and the way Nathan talked to us
then why did we go to all that trouble yesterday . 90260_92580
instead_of just using four squares like this . 93700_95660
we took all the time and effort to make ours two sided . 96850_99940
we we colored on both sides . 100360_101860
we made sure as Jillian put it that the shapes matched and that the
we took a_lot_of time to make two sided four squares . 106840_109390
and now I'm wondering did we waste our time . 109440_111950
no . 112420_112520
so what theater are what good are these two-sided course first to
can what what good is that gonna do us . 118340_120980
Katie what do you think . 121200_121900
well &-um 'cause we'd be able to like if we needed to them
didn't if we didn't them anything . 132940_135210
&-um &-um two sided whisper . 137340_140460
so we . 141090_141250
okay . 142930_143140
so we're back to two sided ones . 143600_145320
we'll let us flip them and turn (th)em why will we wanna flip
'cause we could because we wanted be make a_lot_of two by . 150110_153010
designs . 153430_153710
why do we wanna make a_lot_of two by two designs . 154100_156410
'cause we &-um we six and five . 159570_168110
okay . 169350_169540
so we're gonna try to make five or six different two by two designs
and that's &-uh for a quilt family booklet . 174560_177140
I heard Katie say it says . 177360_178820
if we're gonna make five or six of them we'll lead to flip and turn
we made this one without flipping and turning . 185780_187510
yeah . 188090_188220
but we would've been able to make a lot . 188260_189950
we wouldn't make four or five more . 190500_192740
yeah we could . 193610_193830
without flipping or turning . 194950_196900
yeah . 197820_197910
we can make without flipping . 198060_199590
we can't make a quote . 200340_201180
&-um without flipping or turning . 201460_202780
how can I make a different course . 202940_204220
&-uh different to my two design than this one . 204520_206270
he when we picked the up he made . 207540_209820
&-um can you tell that I put how could the yamo told me right away
the yellow corner . 217820_218590
can anyone tell me how to use those four pieces a different way
I can't flip (th)em and I can't turn (th)em Jillian you can tell me
&-um mhm . 233700_236550
want step on these blue triangles . 242050_244230
be up . 244340_244580
you could these blue triangles would be up where these yellow
how could I get that blue triangle here up to where this yellow
you can't make a quote . 264670_265680
family . 265990_266280
you can't . 266930_267350
that would be a different two by two design . 269770_271180
wouldn't it . 271530_272000
&-um Jillian wants this blue triangle up where the yellow triangle
if all the yellow ones were in the middle would be same designers
yeah . 286440_286550
could I get all the yellow ones in the middle with without clicking
no . 289910_290020
could I get turn . 291580_292170
could I get all the yellow ones in the middle in like a diamond
you're thinking . 296650_297150
yeah . 297320_297380
without flipping . 297810_298560
yes . 299790_299910
yes yes definitely . 301260_302700
de . 303270_303440
why do you think . 303510_303990
definitely . 304010_304320
you're so sure about that . 304370_305270
turn this one in . 307800_308880
and then turn that one there . 309190_310510
and then turn again turn . 310790_312520
oh turn <that one> that one . 312910_314580
right if I'm gonna start with this one Sarah if I'm gonna use this
where would you want me to put that in the two by two design
I want . 328670_328830
I just wanna copy this one . 328890_329990
I don't wanna turn this one or flip it . 330090_331680
where would it go in the two by two design or trying to make a
we'll go on the top . 339730_340440
top . 342430_342550
where would I put it . 342740_343520
<let me> let me draw a frame for a two by two design . 346830_349150
so they know the space we're thinking about this is bigger than our
but if we wanna make a two by two design with the yellow diamond in
where would I put this one there right here . 357600_360830
no here there . 361420_362320
okay . 363030_363270
now all of these are still like that . 364340_366020
Sarah what would I do with this one . 366040_367710
&-um to get it in the right position . 369020_371180
here . 371230_371460
you don't want it like that . 372880_373540
do you . 373700_373990
no . 374580_374640
so do I flip it . 375270_376420
&-um no . 377540_377680
turn it . 378590_379100
&-um right . 379340_380870
two fourths . 381180_381770
turn it right . 382270_382980
two fourths one fourth two fourths . 383300_387220
you said . 387710_388070
does that look okay to you . 390270_390910
Nicole . 390960_391190
yeah . 391840_391900
but I need the other two pieces . 391920_393270
yep . 393970_394060
and I also need another piece of tape . 394140_395700
Julian's okay . 398360_400460
how_about this one . 401020_402980
it does is that how we want it . 405700_407140
no . 407740_407830
turn it . 408350_408540
black . 409090_409390
yeah yeah . 415990_416240
what_about this one . 417750_418870
turn right to four <one one one> one . 419790_424020
so what did we make . 432420_433260
<we we> we made it two by . 434530_438860
and we exactly the one up there . 440600_442330
okay . 443630_443900
so we made it two by two design . 443920_445380
like the one we used for our finished quilt . 445470_447460
is this the same two by two design that was up here before . 447700_450020
no no different . 450360_451620
it's a different one because . 451870_452830
the triangles used to be in the one used to be . 452880_455790
they all used to be black on yellow corner . 456190_458660
okay . 459470_459680
so the yellow triangles used to be in the top left corner of each
right . 466370_466580
this one right . 467160_468110
&-um Elise I didn't have any problem using these course squares to
'cause you gave guys gave me such wonderful directions . 478470_480590
so I still don't get it . 481180_482900
why did we color on the backs of those of the coursewares designed
if we flip . 487100_487420
(th)em then we can still see them on the back . 488450_490540
and we know if it looks different . 490700_494170
and if it looks the same . 494700_496100
why would we need to flip (th)em we just made a different two by
and we didn't flip it at all . 500120_501100
but <if we> if we couldn't turn it we had we you would have to
and then and &-um if you put it on the back then &-um you can see
if you flip it you can still make a different while without turning
why wouldn't I be able to turn it . 522940_524710
well like we had to do we couldn't put it on . 525990_529240
on this one . 530650_531100
why did I say . 532470_533150
we should try to do this one with only turning only . 533240_535180
see if we could &-um . 536100_537290
what would've happened if you . 538110_539020
on map on the map . 539660_541060
right . 541570_541740
so if we proved we can do it with only turning . 541860_543820
why would we need to flip . 544780_545860
what do you think . 546870_547420
Nicole Nathan I need you to sit up . 547440_550080
'cause a if you don't it you'll always you'll pretty_much almost
time . 561990_562130
what would I get . 562630_563300
the same one all the time . 563430_564310
