okay &-um the midterm is a week from today +/.
⌈ whoo ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ as hard ⌋ as that is to believe woohoo &=laughs &=laughs so &-um we will &~pu &~i in the &-uh undergraduate library Science Library reserves are the old exams both the midterm and the final that you can check out .
&-um but just to be nice &=laughs we will also post a midterm in the lab here .
you can take it away to copy it but that's all you can take it away for so get it back as soon as you can if you do take it out .
&-um and I am gonna have a review session tomorrow night Wednesday night from six thirty to eight at Eberwhite Woods .
there's a sign+up sheet in the lab so you have to sign up and there's directions how to get there it's a probably about a mile and a half away if you wanna walk or ride your bike or something it's pretty close .
&-um and we'll meet in the parking lot there at six thirty .
and then Dulcy .
&-uh I'm not sure what I'm gonna do yet .
&~i I wanted to &-uh take a vote on I have to change my review session for extenuating circumstances like I can't control them so it could either be Sunday at five or Monday maybe at four or five .
now I don't like to take away a_lot_of the weekend time so I wanted to ask you would you rather have it Sunday or Monday ?
Sunday .
fine Sunday at five it is .
&=laughs:multiple so at Bird Hill I'll put up &-uh directions and everything .
okay that was easy .
&=laughs:multiple .
alright great .
the topic for today's lecture is river floodplains and what we're gonna be doing is +//.
first I wanna talk about the larger picture what it means a watershed is and what drainage basins are .
and then we'll look at some specific drainage patterns which are actually on page ninety five I think yeah in your course pack .
and then we'll talk about the different processes that are that go on surrounding a river followed by the specific landforms of the floodplain the climate of the floodplain soils and vegetation of the floodplain .
and then if we have time we'll look at slides of &-um last week's lab when we went to Sharon Hollow .
okay so the first thing is talking about this idea of a watershed and what that means .
and so up here on the board I wrote this definition there .
there're a variety of definitions about of watersheds or of a drainage basin but this one seems to be pretty inclusive saying that +"/.
+" &{l=READING it's the area of land that drains to a single outlet and it is separated from other watersheds by a divide .
&}l=READING and you've heard you know of the Continental Divide that is the the largest watershed that we can think about in North America and if water falls if a drop of water falls to the west of the continental divide it eventually makes it out to the Pacific Ocean and then if it falls to the east of the continental divide it makes it out to the Atlantic Ocean .
so that's a broad scale watershed &-um with that divide being the Continental Divide .
and I'll show a_couple_of pictures of other +//.
of the Huron watershed and &-um so you can see what those different flow &~wa flow pathways are into the watershed and what's draining .
but what it amounts to is a system of channels which is also referred to as a drainage network .
and I kind_of like this this quote out_of this &-um article I was reading that said that this system of channels represents nature's most effective means of getting water off of the land .
okay so we really +//.
it's important that we understand the processes that are going on in floodplains and understand that this is a natural process in the landscape and that &-um you know it's not good for vegetation to be sitting in all this water and so this is just a series of networks that allows &-um the water to get removed from the landscape .
so (0.15) okay this is a picture showing the traditional watershed divide and this &~c this picture only shows the deep groundwater flow pathways that are coming .
so you can see that the groundwater here is all flowing into the stream and this is a separate this is a separate watershed or a separate drainage basin so here's the divide that separates the two right there +...
now it's important to understand though that not only does ground water which is called base flow does +//.
not only does ground water flow into &-um this stream and get carried away but also the &~r &~s more surface flow or runoff that's either just very &-um not very far beneath the surface or it runs across the top of the surface .
and so those are both important elements contributing to how a particular drainage basin gets drained into the channels that are draining it .
(0.7) okay this shows a picture of the Huron watershed and all of these other divisions are actually just subbasins within this larger drainage basin called the Huron watershed .
and I have another picture showing the particular outlet +...
so here we have you know a bunch +//.
everything every drop of water that falls within this area gets drained out to this outlet right here .
that eventually goes out to Lake Erie .
(0.5) so are there any questions about what a watershed &~i what a watershed is what a drainage basin is ?
the way that the water flows out_of a particular drainage area into the different channels that eventually get carried away the way that that water moves is really dependent on the the physiography on the bedrock of the material that's present there and so it depends the the drainage will look differently depending on if it's extremely &-um corrodible and erosive material versus if it's more +//.
it's it's very resistant to weathering and erosion and sometimes it's very homogeneous meaning that &-um you know you have one type of bedrock over the entire area and other times when you have differential types of bedrock some will be extremely &-um easily weathered and others won't be and so you'll get different patterns that way .
and that's what I wanna talk about next .
so if you turn to your course pack on page ninety five you'll see these basic drainage patterns these pictures .
and these can be this &~i these are just eight different very basic drainage patterns there's a_lot_of variation in the real world and there are differences in between &-um some of these can be altered but this will show you what the basic patterns look like .
the first one is dendritic and this is actually the most common .
it's found in very uniform homogeneous bedrock areas .
and so what happens is it &~a it ends up branching a_lot and it looks &~s very it's called dendritic like tree like .
and it's characterized by if you can see the one two and three .
first order channels which are ephemeral they don't last throughout the year they're there when there's a_lot_of water to be drained and &-um what happens is when two first order streams tributaries when they come together they make a second order stream .
and it takes two second order streams to come together before you get a third order stream .
and it's these higher ordered streams the second third even fourth ordered stream those are permanent rivers that are present in the landscape .
so the first order streams are typically only there during spring runoff +...
okay for parallel which is the next one you can see that these are formed they're extremely parallel ridges formed in linear landforms and again this would be material that's very homogeneous very alike .
the bedrock can either be sedimentary it could be metamorphic but it's all similar in a given area .
and that varies from this trellis one which has differential material .
oftentimes this was formed on a slanted bed and so you might have extremely &-uh &~ve very resistant rock located at the top of the ridges and getting drained down into valleys that are more corrodible .
and so you have &-um a &~different difference in the rock &~ma maybe going from metamorphic rock to sedimentary rock which would be &-um weathered more easily and so you get these different gaps between the ridges forming .
and you have similar sized tributaries coming in to another branch and then into the main trough .
section D shows a rectangular drainage pattern and this one's really easy because it's all made up of these right angles .
so the main drainage is a right angle and then the tributaries to those come in mostly at right angles and this is found where it's very strongly jointed rocky terrain .
and it sort of guides the it guides the water in those along those joints .
and &-um so the way that you tell that from this one this these just are broken up there's they're divided there's gaps in between the ridges and it it just looks like there's there's more tributaries coming into it on the trellis .
radial is when it's &-uh if you think of a volcano it's one peak and everything is draining down from this one point .
so here's the center water's getting carried downward from this one point and and it ends up goes off radially .
and that varies from this annular drainage pattern which is also found when you have a dome .
however this again occurs when there's differences in the material .
&~different differences in the weathering of the material and and the the drainage path will seek out the &-um least resistant path .
and so when you have these areas that are coming in it's because it was able to break through very easily weathered rock surfaces .
and so you get this circular appearance to it +...
and the last two are &-uh ones that we'll talk about that kind_of a combination of the last two are what glacial drift what the kind of drainage that glacial drift has .
but the first one is multibasinal and that's any &~ti any time that you have very hummocky topography .
and sometimes we have specific names for it like when it's limestone topography it's called karst and what happens is &-um it gets dissolved the limestone gets dissolved differentially and you get sinkholes and caves and rivers underground .
&-um but anytime you have <really hummocky> &~mat really hummocky surface like this and you don't necessarily know where it came from it's also called multibasinal .
and then contorted &~i is what happens +//.
the difference in contorted is that it's very it's just not very specific and it it forms when there's glacial drift and it's very messy there's not very &~or there +//.
it's not very orderly the pattern of it's not very orderly and so the rivers are are taking whichever route that they can because the underlying rock surface the structure is not there .
so it's just flowing around the glacial drift .
and and the way that it looks it it's just looks strange contorted .
so glacial drift is kind_of a combination of both .
multibasinal can occur we've talked about how the glaciers could depress the land in the bedrock and &-um and depending on how the drift was laid when the glaciers were retreating would have maybe allowed it to be multibasinal as_well .
so it's kind_of a combination of the two .
are there any questions +..?
okay then what I want to talk about is &-um a little bit about the processes of rivers <and understanding> and understanding more about what the purpose of a river is .
and so rivers are basically they're great levellers that transport material from high in the landscape and they wash it out to lower in the landscape .
so they're moving this material from upward down to lower grounds and water basins and then they get deposited there .
and they carry a large amount of material with them this material is called alluvium any material transported by a river is called alluvium .
and this diagram here the one up here shows that there are different types of materials that the river carries .
one type is this bed load which is just located in the bottom it moves very slowly it kind of rolls with the river but it's it's along the bottom and those are where the coarsest materials are found .
so they kinda roll and tumble along the lower surface of the river .
and then you also have suspended load which are the finer particles that get carried with the flow of water .
and &-uh we talked about this before that depending on how fast the water is moving would depend on &~wh what size of particles settle out .
so those clays which are the finest materials they will say &~s stay suspended in that flow until it it almost comes to a complete stop .
and then the clays &~with would &-um settle out .
but if the river's moving faster it'll be able to carry larger particles .
and over here this term saltation is what is referred to when the river's moving much larger particles .
and it's actually just it's sort_of a bouncing leaps and tumbles of larger particles that occur when they get picked up by either wind or by water .
so if you think of how sand dunes we'll talk about dunal formation that's how sand dunes get formed too .
it's the the tumbling of these particles by saltation and this happens either through wind or through water .
(0.9) okay and then there's two other terms that I wanna talk about related to what types of materials that the river carries and one relates to the size of the particles carried .
okay and this the term referring to this is called competence how competent is the river in carrying larger particles .
and so if there's a_lot more of the larger particles mixed in the flow then it has a &~high it's said to have high competence .
versus low competence if there were more smaller particles .
and then also it relates to the number of particles that are carried .
this term is capacity .
so <if the> if the river has the ability to carry a very large quantity of &~mat of material then it has a high capacity .
versus a low capacity if it doesn't carry very much through there .
and while both of these relate to &~wa to the velocity of water this one relates more &~me &~we mentioned that before the velocity how fast it's going it'll be able to &~c if it's flowing faster it'll be able to carry larger particles .
and although this one does relate to velocity it is much more dependent on a discharge the volume of water that's going through a particular river .
larger volume it'll be able to carry more particles with it .
(0.8) are there questions about that ?
(0.8) okay then the next thing I wanna talk about is the flow of water and what happens just as a natural process of of &~me of rivers .
and the natural tendency of a river if you think of a river starting out completely straight the natural tendency is over time we're talking you know hundreds thousands of years but over time this river will meander .
there'll be different things that block it up in one area have to go around maybe a log or maybe a rock or something and so what happens is it'll start to go one way .
so if the river's flowing and over time it starts to go this way it's cutting this bank .
as it goes it's taking material away from that bank .
it's directly cutting into it .
but there's a slower flow on the inside of the meander .
and this is where material gets deposited .
it's a little bit slower &~f flowing and so it's almost it's removing material from here but then eventually downstream it'll deposit those materials <that it's> that it's removing .
so we have a cut bank and the point of that position which is called a point bar .
and that's just the natural process of rivers over time you can get +//.
not only do rivers migrate from like left to right but they also can migrate the bends can start to migrate south in the direction that the river's flowing .
I have a different diagram to illustrate that +...
which is this one right here at the top .
so you can see that the river's flowing and this is a much more dynamic bend &~wi of the meander but you can see how it shows where the original path of the river was and that over time from cutting away and depositing you get these big point bar deposits .
and it's still +//.
it's cutting away from the direction that it's flowing and so the the river it's <migrating that way> migrating that way but also here it was and it starts to migrate away from where it was originally .
and it migrates in the direction of the flow .
so you have &~d two different modes of migration on the river and it's due to this meandering motion .
okay so this flow that you see in a river this is just you know rivers are flowing that's a normal that's a continuous process that occurs daily yearly &~s every century .
but then we have this other process that occurs on river floodplains why they're called floodplains and that's flooding .
and this although it's a regular process it is infrequent .
so and we can have different we can have different sizes of floods very major ones that are called hundred year floods that are typically said well once a century you'll get a large flood on this border versus smaller floods .
and what happens when there's a flood is that here's the &~f here's normal before <the flood> the flood stage water okay so the water's has risen onto the banks adjacent to the &~f &~ad adjacent to the filling channel .
and you get these different deposits right adjacent to it .
so during a flood the thick coarse materials will be deposited right here right adjacent to this channel .
and then as waters still keep toppling over that they start to flow a little bit their velocity slows down as they splash on top of where these coarse materials are and some of the finer materials settle out over here on outside of that .
and so this is what's called a levee .
over time it keeps building up by many different floods and you know even &~s even smaller floods keep splashing up and you get very thick amount of coarse material sands and gravels there and finer silts and clays further out .
and we'll be talking more about the the other formations <of the> of the land forms of the floodplain but that's that's a big one that occurs from directly from that flooding effect .
so two processes just the normal flow of the river which is very continuous and the rivers meander over time compared to another type it's a regular process but it's it's more infrequent .
it it +...
and then this diagram just shows how &~i if we looked at a cross section of the river how it would flow and how it that depends on what other obstacles are in the way .
so for example the profile would be like this if there was a lake because the river actually adjusts to whatever the the base flow is at that local level .
so for example we have a lake here whether it's a reservoir because there's a dam there or it's just a natural lake the river's adjusted to this level right here .
and then further down it's adjusted to the level where the ocean is .
but over time if something &~hap if that lake got drained what would happen is the river level would just be adjusted to this ocean level right here .
(be)cause that would be <the base> the base level at that river .
so that's how usually it's this concave upward profile but it does get altered by some local some different local physiographic differences that might might change over time and therefore it would be like this other this ocean base level +...
is that confusing ?
kind_of okay well let it soak in &=laughs and then &=laughs:multiple let me know if you have questions about it .
alright so those are a_couple_of the processes and now I wanna talk about the other features that we have and this is in your course pack on page ninety six .
so we're gonna look at xxx different features that are formed within the floodplain and then we'll look at a cross section so that you can see what we'll be walking on over today when we get out on the actual floodplain .
okay so the first one we already started talking about the point bar and these again they're formed on the inside of these meanders +...
<cut bank> opposite on the outside where the river is cutting .
I drew I kinda colored in blue on the one side the levee okay we already talked about the levee .
and then we have a_couple_of other features the &~o an oxbow lake is one they actually have a really nice diagram down lower showing how this forms .
and what happens I already mentioned that we have this natural meander over time .
but during a flooding event water always seeks the shortest route .
so during a flooding event it might actually get channelized to go straight down <the main> the main channel .
and it kinda leaves this other channel that's out_of the way it kinda leaves it stagnant and over time &{l=SIC as waters just kind_of sitting there pools up &}l=SIC there's &~coar there's very fine clays that +//.
and &~s and silts that get deposited right there adjacent to the main channel and it actually cuts this oxbow lake off from the main channel .
so you have just this other it always looks <like a> like a u@l shape like that .
okay so that's a oxbow lake and you can see up here showing the oxbow lake and how there's that clay plug which is blocking it off from the main channel .
meander scrolls are are evidence of where the channel used to be .
and so you can tell that the channel was migrating from over here over and finally you can see here's meander scrolls in there but then once that channel +//.
once the meander got cut off formed the oxbow lake you can still see where where it was and now it'll probably migrate in a different it'll just keep migrating this way but further south .
where &~the before compared to where the oxbow lake was before .
swales are areas in between these meander scrolls where very silty &-um materials are ponded up in between there it's because water was left to settle there very fine particles settled out +...
and then sloughs are over here and up high maybe you can see that those are areas that are very they're very wet and sometimes depending on the flooding event they can be sort_of reconnected and and they can have active drainage ways through there .
but for the most part there's a_lot_of just organic matter deposited back there and &-um just they're wet areas where a &~lo vegetation gets able to build up over time .
and that so much of the backswamp backswamp deposits are very fine organic matter deposits very rich deposits that &-um there's actually and I'll show this a little bit in the profile but there's actually a slight decrease in the elevation going away from the main channel over towards these terraces .
and because of that decrease in elevation water is able when water gets splashed over there during the flood event water remains there and then water returns back to the channel or seeps down but it stays ponded up in those backswamps .
and it's very &~s it's it's very easy to identify we'll be seeing a really great backswamp today .
the active floodplain you can see the line up at the top the active floodplain is called &-um the &~fir usually the first bottom in between the levee and the other terraces we have the first bottom .
not including that's called the first bottom backswamp (be)cause it's a backswamp located on the first bottom .
so this whole area would be the first bottom and then up from the first &~botto <that's the> that's the active floodplain that's the one that's flooding currently .
and up from there we have different terraces you can have second bottom third bottom those are all different terraces and &-um second bottom can flood sometimes .
currently the third bottom &~rare rarely ever &~f floods .
although we'll talk in a little bit about how human disturbances in the landscape are starting to alter them a little bit .
&-um but eventually what will happen is the second bottom will no longer it will be replaced it will become the third bottom if this channel gets lower .
over time there's incision and and the channel gets <smaller and> smaller and smaller .
and so what'll happen is that current +//.
the second bottom will become or the first bottom will become the second bottom and then you'll get a new first bottom that will occur there .
so it's a constantly changing process .
are there any questions +..?
xxx alright .
&~f and before we look at a cross section of this I have this diagram which shows how humans are kind of starting to alter these areas and and flooding is a natural disturbance in these &~in in a floodplain .
&-um and what happens in &~the as &~i I said before is the way that the &~land the landscape gets rid of excess water .
and it really depends on the type of material you have if it's impervious or pervious .
and so because we're doing things like agriculture housing people wanna live adjacent to the river but they don't want their &~hou their homes to be flooded .
and so you have channelization of of streams .
also dams built for for power .
so we have problems there're many disturbances to the floodplain and these lands &~form these landforms &-um were &~b were alternate landforms in changing the flooding regime .
and so what happens is in an effort to decrease flooding because people don't want their homes to be affected or &~th agriculture to be affected there are fewer floods but these floods are more devastating .
and one of the best ways to understand this is to understand the tradeoff between having surface water runoff and groundwater filtration and it being discharged that way .
so if you look at that top figure we have a forest .
it shows that eighty to a hundred percent of the water that comes in is going into the groundwater .
and only ten to twenty percent is going over into the channel .
and that's because there's vegetation there the vegetation kind of slows down the water if there's a really &~h a large rainstorm and it gets a chance to seep back down into the water (be)cause it's very pervious .
but still about ten to twenty percent will will drain into the channels over land .
if it's cultivated you have only about forty to fifty percent actually getting drained down .
fifty to sixty percent is making it to the channel so we still have some vegetation that might kind of slow the pathway down and it's still pervious but not nearly the amount to block it like canopy &~tree canopy vegetation would .
residential areas where we have a_lot_of sidewalks where we have lawns so fifty to sixty percent is gonna make it down forty &~fif to fifty percent is going to go off into the channel .
and if you look at urban cities zero to ten percent actually gets down into the groundwater to drain .
it's all concrete so ninety to a hundred percent actually gets drained into the channels .
and so in altering the &~land I mean it's important it's looking at the land use around a particular area and how we've altered these river channels and it's important for +//.
that's why it's important for us to understand the processes that go on there .
because to be sustainable with the environment and to have agriculture in residential areas but to understand that flooding is a natural process and this is how water is transported away and that's how we get rid of it and and to alter that as much as we have has really damaged the areas around us the &~f the floodplain landform .
and so it's important for us to try and mimic natural the way that natural floodplains would work .
and so that's what we're talking about today .
are there any questions about this +..?
here's a picture showing some of this doesn't show it that well .
&=laughs showing the effect of flooding in a residential area .
and you can see the cars and devastation .
(0.7) okay (0.16) alright this will be repetition on what we just talked about most of what we just talked about but it's looking at it in a different way looking at a cross section of a floodplain and so we can look at the topography and how that will be different in these different regions .
so we've got the river here the active river .
and then the first bottom extends up to the second bottom showing that is the active flooding .
the area that's actively flooding this <I screwed up> .
&=laughs:multiple okay .
this shows the levee which has sands and gravels and again how those finer silts and clays get deposited on the other side of the levee .
and then the slough which has the very fine materials in between in the middle and then on the other sides of the sloughs often these are found &-um these have more sand and gravel deposits more coarser sediments in there .
and sloughs are actually more typical in very large river channels .
so we don't really tend to see those that much &-um like on the Huron River which isn't quite as big of a channel .
and then you can see that this goes down in elevation and so it actually the water will settle down back here when all the other water gets &~r back into the channel or seeps down .
the backswamp will be left and this is where gets water's able to settle out &~w the &~fine very fine materials are settling out and then you'll have characteristic vegetation back there swampy areas .
and &-um yeah let's see what else .
okay so did somebody have a question ?
okay and silts and clays then up here we have the second bottom third bottom terraces you can even have more terraces than that .
but again those will be coarser material and they're very infrequently flooded .
however because of these increased human disturbances and we have less frequency of flooding but there are they're more disastrous we are tending to see nowadays that these third bottoms are getting flooded where they would have never gotten flooded in a natural floodplain situation .
we have +//.
and there's &~an there's another diagram we'll talk about that more in a minute but there's a diagram showing a cross section of this in your course pack also .
on page ninety seven +...
okay +...
so the next thing is to talk a little bit about how the climate is different in these floodplain areas and how that affects the vegetation growth .
(0.11) okay so one thing that we've hit on a little bit when we talked about the lake plain is how &-um the the types of species that are growing there the lake plain is one of the warmest areas in Michigan climactically .
and so we have a_lot_of species growing there that are seen further to the south and they're able to to grow there because of this difference in climate and so on the floodplains that are located within the lake plain the hardiness zone mimics that of one just further to the south .
so we see a species that are growing there &-uh like Redbud and Kentucky Coffee Tree other species that are very much typical of the South but they're naturally growing there because of a difference &-um .
and this relates to +...
to the vegetation and it's important to understand looking at you wanna look at climate how the physiography in the floodplain is different and how that affects the vegetation but it's important to understand something that triggers the vegetation to flush out and what that is is heat sum .
okay and so heat sum is just the accumulation of heat that allows &-um plants to to flush out .
and plants will flush out depending on &-um once they reach a certain threshold of this accumulated heat .
and what this means is that metabolically plants will be active if they accumulate so many hours above either five degrees &~Celsiu Celsius or forty degrees Fahrenheit .
okay actually I kind of forget I <would put> it on the board .
let me do that .
it's easier to understand +...
okay .
so the heat sum is accumulated heat over a certain threshold +...
and if you look at for example a mean temperature if plants are experiencing a mean temperature of sixty degrees for five hours on a particular day then sixty degrees Fahrenheit that's twenty degrees Fahrenheit over forty degrees .
okay so they have to at least reach forty degrees to become metabolically active .
and this is twenty degrees Fahrenheit over that for five hours .
so you multiply twenty degrees Fahrenheit greater than forty times five hours which is &~h a hundred degree hours .
and different plants have different degree &~r degree hour requirements before they will flush out .
but it's important to understand that that is what triggers flushing in the spring .
is that confusing are there questions about that +..?
okay yes .
why did you subtract the forty from the sixty ?
is that the forty is like the threshold ?
forty is the &-uh forty is a threshold where plants won't really be &~meta they won't be metabolically active until it's forty degrees Fahrenheit .
and then once it starts getting warmer then it's like well it can't just be you know a really nice day in February for &~f for plants to flush out but they have to accumulate so much heat over a particular you know time period .
so then they know that well it &~s it's safe enough in this region that I'm not gonna be susceptible to late spring frost .
I'm putting human vocabulary &=laughs on these plants .
but basically they're adapted to the environment where they grow and so they know &~th that if they can reach so many heat hours that depending in this climate that's when they'll be able to flush out with very low risk of getting frosted out .
so yeah it hasta be above forty degrees Fahrenheit and then they accumulate these hours over time .
so one day they might have you know sixty degrees for five hours another day it might only be fifty degrees for for five or ten hours or something so that'd only be ten &~hou ten degrees above the threshold .
and you'd multiply ten degrees times however many hours that were and so then that would be added to the hundred degree hours from before .
okay does that make sense yeah .
and then if it gets cold does that so I guess looking at the heat sum they're accumulating but then if it gets cold does it subtract from that or ⌈ does it just stay ?
(un)til it gets warm again ⌉ .
⌊ no &-uh &~i it just ⌋ it just stays .
they've got it .
you know and it's a couple +//.
exactly that's why a couple weeks may go by and they're like oh good thing we didn't flush out .
so &-um yeah it just stays a part of them and &-um they have to reach so many degree hours and I think it's probably you know in a very safe zone the &~deg the number of hours that they are required to reach is high enough such_that it typically won't &~h won't occur unless it's springtime .
(0.14) okay so it's important to understand the heat sum and how that relates to seasonal differences and how the physiography affects that in the river floodplain .
so this top diagram shows here's the sun in early April not a_lot_of direct sunlight right into the bottomland right into the channel you know direct sun is hitting over here and so the upland species are receiving six hours at fifty degrees .
okay fifty degrees is ten &~hou ten degrees above that threshold so on a &~partic you know a given day in April they might &~accu start to accumulate sixty degree hours on a particular day .
you compare that to the bottomland species though right adjacent to the river they're at five hours only at forty seven degrees .
so it's cooler down there seven degrees above the threshold so at five hours times seven degrees &-um thirty five degree hours .
so in early April those plants that are right adjacent to the river aren't accumulating as much heat as those plants that are upland .
where they're getting the direct sunlight +...
then if we compare this to May .
so what happens is these upland species will flush out sooner than the species that are present in the bottomland but those upland species might be more susceptible if there is a late spring frost .
so these species down here are kind of buffered by risk of a late spring frost because they don't flush out as soon .
now if we look here's in May when more overhead direct sunlight the upland species averaging fifty degrees for thirteen hours so thirteen times ten degrees above that threshold that's a hundred and thirty degree hours .
if you compare that to the bottomland where now we have direct sunlight but we also have what's called reradiation because of the physiography and because of these terraces there actually the sun is able to reradiate off of these terraces and so twelve hours at fifty five degrees Fahrenheit that's a hundred and seventy degree hours .
so now they're receiving more .
and this is something that's very advantageous to plants because early in the spring they're not gonna flush out as soon but later into the fall these plants will actually be stay active it'll stay warm down there and they'll be able to be really active much longer .
yeah .
what about like cold air flowing down into the valley .
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ does that ⌋ affect (th)em at all ?
well it does but the difference is that when you're adjacent to a river so the channel's really open it's not windy down there and cold air is able to be you know breezed out_of there .
and also because we're adjacent to water it's more humid and there are site conditions that during the day it's not as hot because you're adjacent to the water and there's cool cool air that stays adjacent &~to above +//.
cool air masses above the water it stays adjacent there but then over the &~d the day the water takes a long time to warm up but eventually it does and at night it's actually warmer air masses over that water .
okay so it's it's moderated in that sense too not only is it a seasonal &~moderat seasonally moderated but daily &~it's the days aren't as hot and the nights aren't as cold .
so it's sort_of a double double whammy there .
plants are have you know there's &~a this is great climatically for plants down in this bottomland .
are there other questions about that ?
so everybody understand the concept of accumulated heat for flushing out +..?
did you have a question Norman +..?
okay so that is just looking at the climate and because of this we have a_lot_of different microclimates located in the river floodplain .
&-uh looking at that profile you notice &~th it's very much there's a_lot_of ups and downs in there .
so we have a little microclimate similar to what we saw in the lake plain but even more on a larger scale .
(0.5) okay so that's looking at the climate .
next I wanna talk about the soils that are present in the floodplain but we haven't really talked about soils very much in this class as of yet and I had you read pages ninety and ninety one in your course pack for today so I'm going to start and kinda +//.
we'll give a brief talk about that page and then talk about how that relates to the soils that are present in the river floodplain (0.9) okay so looking at this we have this &~o this over here people have probably seen or talked about before the horizons of the soil or this is also called the soil profile .
and this occurs because there's downward movement of water through the substrate okay through the parent material .
and one thing I think that is confusing is that people tend to think that these layers are getting added to the the top of the parent material that was there so if you think about after the glaciers left and there was an outwash plain or something .
well whatever that outwash plain this down here is called parent material but this whole thing at one point was the parent material .
it's all the mineral what's now called the mineral horizons .
and it's not that these horizons are getting added on top it's because of this downward &~mo movement of water through the parent material it actually brings different things it it chemically alters it can chemically weather the soil and it can add if the vegetation is there it can add organic material humus and it can push these materials through there .
so it's a downward movement and different processes that we'll talk about and the only thing that gets added is up at the top these organic layers are are literally from the litter of vegetation .
but you have &~s there are soil profile there's soil profile development even if vegetation wasn't there .
when the glaciers left there's chemical weathering there's acid present naturally in rain water and as this percolates through through what that parent material was it starts to alter it and creates these different horizons .
so up on top we have the organic horizons which are OI OE OA and they're differentiated based on their amount of decomposition .
so OI is very much you can see it it's litter you can almost you can usually identify what it is .
OEs you can't really identify it but it's kind_of gritty and OA is extremely decomposed matter that's often almost oftentimes greasy in nature .
so those are the organic materials and that is because they're it's material getting deposited on top .
but all all the rest of this was parent material at one point and it creates these different horizons now called mineral horizons based on different processes .
so the A horizon has &~a it's dark often and because it has a large amount of of humus coming from these organic layers so it's discoloring the very top part of the parent material and the the big thing here is the zone of mixing this is considered the zone of mixing .
earthworms often present in the A horizon so stuff is being mixed from the organic material getting mixed in so that's why it has this dark appearance .
the next one is the E horizon which stands for eluvial .
that's another way of saying it's the zone of leeching .
materials are getting leeched from this area and they're getting deposited in this B horizon which is the zone of deposition .
so it often has a reddish color where clays are accumulated there because this downward motion this percolation through there is &-um allowing different oxides to accumulate in this B horizon .
get leeched from the E so it's often very light colored whitish down into B this zone of accumulation .
and then the C horizon is just what's called parent material .
that's unaltered parent material .
so it hasn't been affected by any of these other processes .
that's what you would've seen all the way up to this top here .
we could've seen it after the glaciers left .
okay so that's a little bit about how the soil profiles how they get formed .
and then there's six major soil orders +...
and &-um there's other ones too but these are the major ones that we'll talk about .
so entisols are ones that have very little profile development .
they're new soils so there's not much of this development yet in entisols .
and you see these on dunes and also alluvials so river floodplains +//.
the direct river floodplain that's very new will have an entisol .
the next one is an inceptisol and that is a recent soil profile development but it's not quite as new as entisol .
so we have &-um very very little accumulation in the B horizon but we have a little bit more development up higher in the A and the E and this is characteristic of older alluvium .
so if you think of the second bottom and third bottom those old river terraces those would be inceptisols .
(be)cause they're not quite as fresh as the current floodplain but they're still they're alluvial soils haven't had that much time to develop .
another type of soil is a mollisol and this is characterized by very very rich very black soil .
and you see this a_lot in prairie vegetation very thick masses of of grass &-um are stuck down in that vegetation .
so it has very thick A horizons and they're very dark .
and so in the &~prairie in areas that would've been prairie around here we do have &-um mollisols but this is like the characteristic one over like out in the &-um central United States .
alfisols are very common in southeastern Michigan and these occur where there's warm site conditions very rapid decomposition and mixing &~s medium to high nutrients and that's very typical of a forest in temperate climates so a_lot_of the forests around here have alfisols .
and in spodosols that's a order that's typical of northern Michigan often it's coniferous forests dominated by conifers and these have characteristically a thick OE and OA layers because there's very limited decomposition so there's a_lot_of buildup of the organic layers .
those are typical of spodosols .
and then finally histosols are organic soils and they develop when there's water saturated ecosystems such as marshes bogs and swamps .
and that's a very different the keyword here is saturated .
these sites are saturated compared to flooded and there is a difference .
saturated means stagnant water just sitting there pooling up where flooding &-uh &~th is the periodic process of water coming on to the floodplain and then leaving again .
and so these histosols are typically more than thirty five percent organic matter .
just it's just sitting stagnant in the water .
and another thing about alluvial soils &-um these two especially they're very rich .
and oftentimes the soils can be either circumneutral or or basic .
they're very calcareous .
and that's &-um because of those clays that are abundant in the river floodplain in those areas where they're able to settle out the clay's is pulled up in the nutrient colorways@n .
(0.5) okay so we've talked about the climate of the river floodplain and how great that is for plants .
looking at the soils these are very rich soils present on the first bottom and the second bottom so the soils are really good for plants too .
so this is pretty much win win except we have to talk about the vegetation growing there and how the only thing that they have to really worry about is the flooding and that the vegetation that's growing there is actually hasta be adapted to this flooding regime .
because everything else is there so great so of_course the vegetation would want &=laughs to be able to grow there .
okay so &~th here I've drawn just so you can mark on that page xxx what page +...
page ninety seven you can write that first bottom entisol is very new inceptisols second and third bottoms is the older of the alluvial soil and then alfisols mollisols .
&-um this is pointing upward because that's what would be present in southeastern Michigan but if we were along the river floodplain in northern Michigan &~i it might be a spodosol because that's what the surrounding area order would be like .
so what's adjacent to this is all dependent on where the river is located .
so this just refers to southeastern Michigan .
and then the other thing I wrote on here were some of the characteristic species that are found here .
and &-um like I said the vegetation that grows here hasta be adapted to this very high level of water when there's flooding stages .
and so one of the things you'll see oftentimes is buttressing the base .
there's like these little knees and we'll get to see it today that the &-uh the vegetation kind of grows on stilts because of high water levels .
and &-um also there's a &~l another &-um disadvantage to living here is that for a_lot_of the time very low oxygen concentration because it's flooded .
and so that's another thing that a vegetation's adapted to low oxygen concentrations .
and an interesting thing is that because this is a highly disturbed site lots_of water very low oxygen the the species that are growing here are oftentimes ones that you see around town characteristically for landscaping because they can tolerate a_lot_of stress , they can tolerate low oxygen .
so they'll plant them where there's a_lot_of cement because they know that they can tolerate urban stresses and &-um some of the smog and different pollution that goes along .
they're adapted now to grow in cities and &-um low oxygen because they're growing in cement as_well .
so some of these species talking about the the trees that are present there in the first bottom there's three characteristic species that are typically seen on the first bottom .
one is Ulmus@s:fra americana@s:fra the other one Fraxinus@s:fra pennsylvanica@s:fra and Acer@s:fra saccharinum@s:fra .
so Acer@s:fra saccharinum@s:fra is the Silver Maple and Fraxinus@s:fra penn@s:fra is the Red Ash and then we have the American Elm .
so those are three dominant species of the river floodplain on the first bottom .
and looking at the &-um levee a_lot_of times you'll see Platanus@s:fra sycamore@s:fra growing on the levee .
and then we have in the slough different Salix different species of Salix can grow there .
and also out on the point bar Populus@s:fra deltoides@s:fra cottonwoods and oftentimes it's it's Black Willow growing out on the point bars where you have that deposition in the meandering river .
so those are some of the typical overstory species .
in terms of the shrubs that are present there there aren't as many shrubs present right in the floodplain because of <the &-uh> the &-uh large amount of stress there .
so sometimes right on the levee you'll see different cornuses different dogwoods &-um but for the most part the shrubs don't have the ability to withstand such as as large amount of flooding as the trees do .
so another thing that we see here instead is a_lot_of vines .
(be)cause they don't have as much competition from shrubs it's very open and so we'll see things like Poison Ivy and Riverbank Grape and Virginia Creeper and even different types of Smilax species of Smilax growing &-um in the river floodplain .
and there are sometimes characteristic lower understory &-um species but not as many shrubs .
sometimes in the backswamp you'll get &-um it's more open there aren't as many trees or they're not as dense growing back there so buttonbush can often grow back in the back swamp .
and then today what we'll be doing is looking at a_lot_of the herbaceous vegetation that is adapted to this and some of the &-um vegetationally a_lot_of the plants that are growing here are adapted to grow and vegetate will reproduce vegetatively .
so &-um a_lot_of these plants have their water dispersed and if parts fall off from like fragmentation of the willows and also the cottonwood if parts fall into the water they can get washed downstream and have the ability to grow just from that one part if there's &-um primordia present <in that> in that stem or in that branch that fell off .
and for the herbaceous species there's a_lot_of bulbs and corms and underground stems rhizomes that have the same thing because they're dormant in the spring when it floods so they're not really affected by that and if they get washed away then they'll just grow somewhere else .
so we'll see those today like the green dragon and you'll see ginger and &-um and Matteuccia@s:fra struthiopteris@s:fra you'll see a_lot_of vegetation that's characteristic here .
and &-um at the same time though you hafta be careful about vegetation that is characteristic of floodplains and vegetation that you just it's growing there but it grows a_lot_of other places .
so it's kind_of like the lake thing there're some things that're always found there but a_lot_of things that're just growing there because it's very suitable the site's very suitable +...
anyone have any questions about that ?
any of the vegetation ?
okay .
then I just finally wanted to show you this diagram I put up before about the areas that we've gone in lab and where we're going .
so &-um we talked about the first two already number three was down at the glacial lake plain which is off this map .
and &-um then last Thursday we went to Sharon Hollow which is a combination of ground moraine and outwash .
and then today this shows the location of the lower Huron River floodplain where we'll be be going .
and I think we even have slides to review some of the plants that we saw at Sharon Hollow .
so before we start the slides does anyone have any questions ?

it's the poppy family .
so &~i you know opium comes from the &-um the latex of the poppy of the poppy plant .
same stuff I don't know if you <you've heard> enough of this <on &~Fri> &=laughs:multiple this is it this is so great so we're taking you to the back a little in time here because you don't get to see it flower because it flowers really like the first week of April almost &-um it's very early .
and when it comes up this is a nice little patch .
I think I explained to my group that when it comes up the leaves even more so than this are curled around the flower and the flower comes out in between basically and then it's this beautiful white flower with yellow pretty showy yellow stamens and it dies back to form the fruit .
so &~it it is often in these nice little clumps .
Hydrophyllum ?
what's that ?
Hydrophyllum ?
&~n oh this is still Bloodroot sorry .
