xxx please turn off the air . 55203_67398
I'll make it a bit warmer . 67398_69503
well not really, but if you really have to I suppose . 69503_81878
okay . 81878_82283
xxx go out to my locker and get my maths book ? 82283_93228
oh, you won't need it today . 93228_94451
oh, okay . 94451_95445
are you going to be sitting down ? 95445_110500
I haven't xxx . 110500_112836
oh, then you've got to go outside then . 112836_114660
xxx books xxx . 114660_118258
there'll be some books out there . 118258_119266
oh . 119266_147706
they they can't come in now . 147706_149256
they're not supposed to be coming in here . 149256_151625
oh, okay . 151625_152833
what +/. 152833_153400
(be)cause we're doing this filming . 153400_155041
xxx . 155041_155376
no . 155376_157425
it doesn't anymore . 157425_158378
but um They'll have to +/. 158378_160561
oh okay, so what should we do ? 160561_162128
well they can sit outside there, I suppose . 162128_164208
you'll need to just sit over there . 164208_167328
people can you start by taking out this +... 167328_179186
sheet that we were looking at the other day . 179186_181368
we're going to be looking at something a bit similar, uh, today . 181368_210713
just have a look at the +... 210713_214045
bit down here for a moment where it says +"/. 214045_216548
+" present your findings . 216548_218421
I did print out a few of the things that you've been doing on the computer that's sitting over there . 218421_232020
there's a few, uh, snow men or snow people . 232020_235645
there's a Herb the circle . 235645_237681
there's a smiley face that's reflected . 237681_242010
and there's two or three of the things that you've been doing with the star in the circle . 242010_251353
and it actually doesn't print out in a way that you can read it from very far away . 251353_256490
it's all right to look at in front of you . 256490_258491
uh, and it doesn't print out in color either . 258491_261880
but, this one has firstly, the diagram . 261880_267968
up here it has the measurements of the angles plus the formula . 267968_271785
and that person and also the one next to it has written some sort of a conclusion which is what is being talked about here . 271785_282886
that's one of them . 282886_290105
now this actually is quite easy to read, but it doesn't project all that well . 290105_295383
so let me read it for you +"/. 295383_297588
+" the sum of the angles don't change when you move the points around the circle . 297588_302886
+" when you change the radius of the circle, the size of the circle changes and moves in and out . 302886_308830
+" no matter what the size of the angles are, if you have a five pointed star inscribed in a circle it will be one hundred and eighty degrees . 308830_317341
so there's actually a few things mentioned in there . 317341_320538
there's the fact that it's one hundred and eighty degrees . 320538_323273
there's the fact that it doesn't change if you move the points around the circle . 323273_328058
there's the fact that it doesn't change if you change the radius of the circle . 328058_332536
so this person has put in a conclusion, uh, to do with several of the things that were mentioned on there . 332536_340735
quite a lot of you haven't yet got to that stage of writing all of those things onto your page . 340735_346730
what I want to do now is, if you can pass these back +... 346730_351726
spares ? 351726_384025
firstly, everyone just individually read through the page please . 384025_390996
okay, that's enough for just a quick read through . 390996_453883
now I'd like you together with the person next to you to read through it and have a look at any words in there that you think we might need to know the meaning of . 453883_466083
just underline them with a pencil or something like that . 466083_468585
they could be words that you're not sure of the meaning of . 468585_471145
uh, or they could be words that maybe you do know, but you think that's a pretty important word for us to do . 471145_477631
just do this with a brief discussion with the person next to you please . 477631_532716
xxx . 532716_536628
oh, well, we'll cover that later, but what it would mean would be that if these rays instead of going in that direction if they went in the opposite direction . 536628_544761
okay . 544761_551626
people have found a few words . 551626_552941
they seem to be the same words . 552941_553986
can someone give me a word or two that you need ? 553986_556668
convex . 556668_558020
okay, convex . 558020_559948
um, where is that ? 559948_562875
okay, it's in several places, but there's there's one of them . 562875_566048
