&-uh I thought to bring these &-uh these sessions to &-uh to &-uh
&-um &-um by speaking of the natural availability water . 9220_15700
&-um &-uh because &-um it makes up one of the systems of naturally
&-uh it makes up a system of naturally organized activities which
the it consists of the missing . 44410_46780
why . 47050_47180
&-um and in that respect &-um is part of a collection of such
&-um now &-um when we came to examine what there was to to lay
okay . 105050_105140
I got cold feet because &-um . 105910_109500
&-um I've taken two quarters at a time to go through that system .
and here I've thought to put it together as something other_than a
&-um and within the practices of constructive analytic the there's
has for example the use of the difference between common sense
whatever that would be to transform that or say to render that in a
now the idea that I could hope to go through that presentation of
and so &-um there'll be another time when that will be I'm sure
what I want to do instead is to tell you about the territory ahead
we've been in the course so far . 238560_240590
as I say I want to talk about &-um not only about &-uh what this
now what this manual now consists of in one of its large topics
it's waiting for us . 281120_281980
&-um &-uh what there is for Ethno studies that yet remain would
now let me introduce . 298630_299590
so let me introduce the thing I'm gonna be talking about like
what I proposed was that the discovery of naturally organized
and I even said that those issues those collections made up the
said one collection of Ians considered consisted of studies
&-uh and we spent time with that . 383690_385300
and then we talked about another set of issues that they provided
and it was in connection with that then that we considered &-um
then the quarters where the the summer's work has been
now these issues then are concerned to specify the work of what I
two large collections of studies still remain one collection is
&-um formatting in queues would be such an organizational item . 465890_473940
&-um the performance features of lectures would be an an
&-um &-um Harvey's work insofar as it doesn't bear on or isn't in
now there's a fourth collection of studies . 528450_530650
and that's what I want to be concerned with . 530900_532370
today . 532590_532730
&-uh these are provided in what I'm gonna speak of now is studies
and I want to announce the theme <of the> of the studies and
&-um whereas the issues the let's say issues being located via
recommend possibilities as they recommend candidate phenomena for
the documented conjecture also offers &-um these these
and insofar as ethnography is involved . 603780_606020
then what they offer in these say for the missing wa is the sense
what there consists of the properties of the socialities . 634990_639090
these were gone through in the previous meeting . 641020_643620
&-uh &-um but where a system of naturally organized activities are
there the missing what consists of these systems in their
and I want to do two things . 668620_670380
I want first to tell you what discovered topics are about . 670680_673120
and then I want to go through and lay out some of the common
so what I'm doing then in laying out the territory ahead is giving
they give you some idea of what that corpus studies of naturally
so I'm giving you a kind of topical characterization of the the
let me tell you what I mean by discovery topics . 767480_769460
the notion was motivated by Trent Eggland's article . 776740_779860
&-uh the introduction to the an introduction to the hermeneutics of
&-uh we've already gone through &-um &-uh &-uh the article . 786990_792590
&-uh when I and I spoke about his having provided for the big
what was it that accounted for . 803230_804370
how_come laboratory alchemy that would've flourished for thousands
&-um the alchemy that analytic chemists as historians are providing
and he reads it back then along that that series defined in the
a new rival of an old &-uh and weak version of laboratory chemistry
what Und proposes however is that &-um . 877710_884180
that it wasn't that the two were in a rivalry in their claims for
but that instead the new chemistry was subject to the support work
and that thereby an accounting procedure was instituted at that
&-um &-uh subject to &-uh these accounts that told how the
Nasa says Alan laboratory Alchemy was itself concerned with the
and it was of this concern for the institute discovery of &-uh &-uh
&-um that laboratory Chem chemist that laboratory ache lost out to
now he said then that laboratory Chem that laboratory alchemy
it was simply driven into the shop into the lab as the daily shop .
concerns of investigative of persons acting in the shop for each
effective achievement . 1059230_1061340
then and there with just these materials with this stopping hand to
the promised discoveries in as I that &-uh were become of it . 1069660_1073790
so that in that sense we come on the first property of a discovered
I was to say that laboratory alchemy is a discovered topic with
let's say it becomes a discovered topic with respect to &-um the
and it's hidden with respect to the practices that take it . 1123690_1129990
take laboratory alchemy into account . 1130390_1132460
or not laboratory that take the shop work into account . 1132970_1135870
&-um in established terms . 1136940_1138870
so in the very character we have the first property of a discovered
as_of which the the local embodied lived auditors of practices
they're ignored &-uh accompaniments . 1209590_1213630
so the first property then of a discovered topic is that it's
and it's hidden . 1231020_1231580
not in any which way . 1232730_1233820
and hidden doesn't mean . 1233980_1235060
hidden . 1235980_1236150
in the sense of hide_and_go_seek it says it's instead its meaning
its features are obtained as the discovery of as a discovery
it's in the character it's in the presence of the established
we're talking not of shop work obviously but of the lived ors of
just so justice . 1329730_1331010
so the first property then would be that property hidden . 1334260_1338410
&-um now we don't have to confine ourself to the Eggland thing . 1341520_1346160
we can thank that in for these for the materials that we've been
so the varieties of organ of objects that we made the rec to say we
like for example in kids talk in the work on formatting in queues
and in the search for what blindness could be as practice &-uh via
&-uh in the concern for the performance features of lectures . 1381660_1384710
and there are concerns with the question . 1384840_1387400
what's holding up the traffic as an inquiry that was part of the
&-um in the problems we discussed that were proposed by &-uh
&-um in order or in this attempt there to lucid day the the
in our concerns with those there our concerns were a in a search
let me go through then some further features I've already touched
I've already touched as well on the second feature . 1451810_1453860
and that is that they're not imaginable . 1453940_1455710
they're discoverables . 1455800_1456820
they're only available as discoverables . 1457850_1460450
you of_course you can imagine them in which case you get what you
and we already know &-uh that that those successes are waiting
we want to pick them up . 1475480_1476460
a third feature is that they're real worldy . 1479050_1482250
they don't wait around for us to find a definition of what real
they provide . 1492590_1493270
&-uh the the identifying features Nevermind identifying
&-uh what the really what or what the really &-uh what the real
they provide for &-uh real world as &-uh a thematic and practical
a fourth feature is that they're found via methods that are
they're vast in what it is . 1581230_1585580
when we'll find when you find them you don't have to go looking to
if you look closely enough with a magnifying glass you'll there see
so their vastness has to do with &-um Omni prevalence . 1601860_1607890
another way to think of it is that their common as dirt cheap as
&-um and they're available to every vulgar competence . 1618860_1626620
there's nothing educated about them in the first place . 1629590_1631860
and one doesn't need to be educated right to do them although . 1635250_1641020
you might have to have something happen to the university to get
&-um for our inquiries they they provide a logically acute
they have a very peculiar character in that they're also they're
for example the logical properties of occasion maps which is a
&-um turns out to be topically salient for the Defense Department
so that what we're talking about is not that these topics will get
kids talk for example is topically sad for families . 1752700_1756650
nevermind for linguists . 1757660_1758870
&-um now the way to think of that topic of salient is to think that
it brings us into the company of populations of natural experts . 1781940_1787550
and that turns out to be an inevitable accompaniment of the
when you begin even to to find what it is that's hidden with
mothers of kids are such a pop make up such a population of natural
&-um I would like to mention two further properties three &-um two
now what it does is to establish an infinite domain a phenomenon .
but establishes that domain as a corpus as say it establishes that
not only then the discover of science or founder of science but
&-uh for which it say the discovered topic say stands as its
maps are discovered topics for analytic cartography or the way in
what the discovered topic does then is to radicalize the science
it radicalizes by providing for the practical sciences . 1990270_1998380
transcendental objects . 1998840_2000030
it's transcendent objects . 2000110_2001950
what it does with those objects is to relativize those objects to
and that holds not only for the practices of Analytic sociology . 2021220_2024980
it holds for the methodologies of the sciences wherever they're
since the methodologies are thereby available to us now as
so what it does then is to radicalize these these practical
and &-uh <refers it> refers it it fix it positions those
the practicing chemist or the practicing hospital administrator
but those that live doing this is now provided for in shop practice
not in any which way and not for any kind of shop practices but
&-uh their temporal organization and temporal delivery . 2118220_2121270
now let me just quickly go through &-uh and propose &-um that is
topics occur relative to ordinary activities whose organization
topics with respect to analytic sociology . 2173330_2175620
and indeed these structures of practical action are discovered . 2178020_2181460
topics with respect to all the arts and analytic sciences of
and further the analytic sciences of practical action . 2186620_2188780
include all methodologies of science . 2188800_2190670
&-um as another example the properties of manuals of instructions
topics with respect to collections of instructions as accountably
so the Penny manual of instructions offers them the opportunity to
for which the manual stands as an occasion to bring under
&-uh I've given a_lot_of work to what I speak of as the a Sian
and provides a discovered topic with respect to the formal logic of
and to do it as uniform methods across observant particular
action . 2290720_2290870
so that's another case . 2292500_2294400
&-um personal troublemakers and bodily troublemakers . 2296630_2303270
&-uh their uses find and elucidate topics in logic and methodology
okay . 2329390_2329550
that's now to get some idea what discovered topics could be about .
now I want to return to the consideration of what's meant by the
and I've introduced that stuff on discover topics in_order_to make
sketch what these studies are concerned with . 2349560_2352700
and what they deal with to begin with . 2353310_2361530
when I speak of sy several systems of natural organized activities
we did not discuss in this in the in this in the course of our
any other system except by illusion . 2392810_2395850
had we done so then we would've concerned or could have been
the so-called natural availability of the problem of order is a
&-um some part of which is sketched in the formal structures . 2415010_2418180
paper is another . 2418230_2419500
&-um &-um &-um in games with rules the collection of instructions .
all the basic rules of a game in a play of that game is a Marsian
and that's another system formatting in queues is a strong
it's in that collection that I've just listed the weakest member
now these systems exhibit the following common properties . 2480620_2485820
and in fact I want to speak of their common properties by
I've touched on some of the properties of discovered topics . 2497300_2499780
I want now to to speak of them further each of these as a
&-uh &-um &-um let's say of a conversational greeting that in the
done locally . 2570510_2571120
&-uh and &-um consisting interchangeably as between the lived
yeah the lived orderliness of the action or the lived orderness of
which is to say the embodied character of the objects . 2594860_2598190
work on the one hand the existence of the object is a worldly
on the other those being &-uh polar notions specifying one is
sure I'm saying that the lived orderedness of the action . 2619730_2623790
the lived ordinance of the work of the greeting . 2624190_2625930
right is the same as the embodied work of the greeting . 2627030_2635210
and that's &-uh &-uh stands in a polar relationship too . 2636470_2644720
the existence <of the> of the greeting as a real world greeting
that specifying one provides entirely for the specifics of the oven
further each system being done is unwittingly done . 2668400_2671320
it's done so to speak &-um in specific disrespect for the cutest
at_least as these instrumental versions are available in the &-uh
&-uh they're not done in Machi Veian fashion . 2708740_2710990
although they're subject to Machi Veian versions of how they get
they're not done in Goff Mening fashion . 2718380_2720860
although they're subject without endless they're subject endlessly
all gok I love Esque I love their Goman game . 2727020_2730020
&-um now each system in that <it's a> it's a discovered topic
practical action which provides for its own organization in &-uh
done in established terms greetings done to provide over the course
then each system now relative to the phenomenal practical action
but in doing so essentially misconceive its own organization as an
and in that it misconceive it it does that as an achievement it
&-uh greetings cues formatting in cues &-uh shop practices
alright . 2867630_2867780
and we're not preparing appendices to incorporate in the annual
&-um it's much more serious than that . 2882260_2885910
I mean to see what the serious could be you have to understand then
now that's being overlooked . 2897870_2899670
that &-um these the formulated organizations the formulations of
&-uh is not the professional sociology dis discovery . 2914530_2919050
<it's the> it's the skill in hand . 2920660_2922290
it's the unavoidable practice in hand . 2923590_2925540
&-um and &-um that it gets done to misconceive its organization
whereby these practices &-uh in and as the interior course of
which is say the genealogy of the organization is specifically
&-um &-um Merla Punty is the theorist par excellence . 3001970_3008280
he's the theorist without whom that proposal must remain &-uh
I remember as the retrospective illusion in the prejudices of the
now as organizational objects each of these systems is possesses
and we've already touched on that in our discussions of the
also restores that what to the natural accounts of the org of the
organizational farm phenomena as_of which these they're they're
&-uh omit the what please so that the system in specifying the what
and in that sense restores not only to the phenomenon but restores
it restores to to the study of the structure of practical
&-um restores that wa to the legitimate status of a studyable . 3117660_3126300
the the Wa is remember the so and what the just so and what . 3126660_3130310
the account of the production the in the Ici of production of
provides for the greetings done . 3139200_3141870
just so just what that greeting here . 3143590_3147060
now it being that greeting really and not a similac or something
not the as_if greeting and not the greeting in principle but the
now I want to consider what is meant by speaking of naturally
what's meant by naturally each of these systems in the ways
I keep to keep reminding of that in its specific properties as it
thereby specifies its practical objectivity and its practical
it provides a pr that explanation by explaining as the meaning of
&-um &-um in the in addressing and specifying these systems and
has technical phenomenon . 3299410_3300560
that's what's meant then by the claim . 3302690_3304700
naturally that is it's these properties that have gone through just
&-um that explain the meaning of naturally . 3319090_3324180
the usage is inspired and and takes its continual &-uh
the radical grounds for this proposal that I'm making the
&-um but with the type recordable character of materials in hand or
&-uh but with the these unbelievable incredible practices like
okay or grabbing the wrong street car and finding himself then in a
so and so now I want to site one further feature of these . 3448220_3459470
systems . 3461320_3461530
my hunch is though my colleagues don't agree with me that these
studies of naturally organized activities and that have been up to
I don't mean thereby to credit that methodology . 3510970_3512910
I do mean however to say that these are available to as technical
and they're concerned with these structures &-uh of the practical
okay . 3549390_3549480
&-um are engaged in studying &-um in the discovery . 3551100_3560620
we'll call it that a radical phenomenon that is say of those
&-um in the analytic sciences further than that it would be that I
although again my colleagues are not the same in agreement with me
and the analytic studies of them . 3599060_3600460
the as the asymmetry resides in this that whereas the Ethno can
the reverse is not . 3613440_3614140
so . 3614310_3614390
&-uh there's one other claim to make . 3618500_3620020
and that is that the two stand to each_other as rivals at_least in
until in fact they come to place where they might take each_other
in which case . 3638260_3638860
then &-um the resources of the practices of practical psychological
&-um &-um part are available the way in which the air's available
&-um that doesn't mean nevertheless that &-um <that that> that
not only that that analytics . 3680580_3682240
Sociology does not have a monopoly on good work in the study of
there's some reason to think that to the extent that these systems
and indeed they're already available enough . 3696840_3699610
then the claims to of the analytic sciences of practical action . 3701200_3705760
the analytic arts of science . 3705780_3706930
practical action that is the claims to be detecting and
and can be taken with that little seriousness hence . 3721200_3725930
oh it's on those grounds that I feel the absurdity of answering or
has shop work . 3739580_3740460
which is to say occasionally you can get a bright idea . 3741450_3745220
Christ knows where it comes from . 3745500_3746700
how he Schwartz for example likes to read that criticism because he
and he finds when he reads someone who's dumb his own thoughts flow
that's a way in which you can read this stuff . 3759500_3762780
well you could also say dream it I mean if you can dream it or you
&-um okay . 3775220_3779270
that's can I think of that then as as &-uh as <what the>
it reports to make those arguments unavailable as something
yeah . 3822680_3822790
at the same time same that it's essentially different activities
right . 3840850_3841030
well I'm talking about it as a r in that if their claims have if
right would then be made decidable by the work of Analytic
I'm proposing in that sense that their rivalry consists in this
not only demonstrably so but but that that &-um &-uh that
that's number one the other is that the rivalry would consist of
let's say that an organization of activities could look like as
gives it . 3940090_3940350
the claim . 3940710_3940940
gives it the force of an historical episode can be taken with just
that's a safe for the investigation . 3948450_3950260
and what makes it work . 3950280_3951260
that doesn't mean however that you don't have to take it seriously
there's a way in which you sweat . 3961330_3962510
&-uh but I take that to be a different kind of like a different
&-um as a matter of fact the whole &-uh I think I've already told
&-um the literature in that it doesn't know the work of the studies
&-um &-um &-uh forgets that it's written in the presence of &-um an
so that in that case you might say that when the then the when the
and insist that they must have some rules of evidence . 4042940_4045760
won't they then lay them out to satisfy the requirements I would
&-uh that in no no circumstances &-um it's it's &-um it's a
okay . 4075710_4075850
this as far as I'm concerned . 4076370_4078050
&-um . 4080080_4080140
<has its> has its cogency as a departmentally based practice
and therefore you have the phenomenon by reason of the character of
this is the you get a course of generations . 4112640_4116180
each of which encounters its version of methodology from its
but then finds when it moves out_of the setting that its practices
so they look back to the home place and that dynamic itself as well
provides a motive for the that pedagogical writing in none of that
however is there any reason . 4140850_4142770
<is there> is there anything that bears on these structure of
I mean is that discoverables . 4149000_4149910
nor can it be interrogated to find it . 4151460_4153460
&-uh and so it's in that sense absurd I mean by absurd . 4155220_4159380
I mean it needn't be taken more seriously or seriously in any dif .
it need not be taken more seriously than the that version of it
you can in fact last a professional lifetime and not write any of
that's quite so . 4183950_4184700
and the persons <who have who have> who have adhered most
is absolutely rare . 4196340_4197100
you might auto get someone one of them to autograph it for you if
&-uh Harold &-uh until the manual appears . 4207000_4209410
&-uh is there a good source for us for the looking at this matter
well <the the the> the most the most prolific source of
what is the simplest systematics of turn taking organization of
Park Salons Um . 4246650_4250480
it's going to look a little different . 4254140_5733270
well you'll be in writing instead_of it being taught . 4260340_4264120
mhm . 4264480_4264850
&-uh yeah it'll be in writing instead_of it being taught . 4267210_4269410
I'm embarrassed because this that's &-um I've been teaching it for
but it's &-um in transcription . 4277900_4280710
and I'm thinking that now my life coming to an end . 4280910_4283140
I better god damn well get it written in the year ahead <or else>
enough enough . 4292770_4293460
sorry . 4294990_4295110
I asked the question . 4295200_4295790
it's your must it's absolutely a legitimate question . 4296260_4298190
it's absolutely a legitimate question . 4301360_4302670
&-um I'm taking it really seriously that I wouldn't have taught for
that's a ten week course of lectures and practices . 4314420_4318430
otherwise the arguments come on in a crazy way . 4318720_4321830
okay . 4324480_4324580
there's to begin with a matter of taking the trust paper where the
taking it through one going through that once more . 4332270_4334340
it takes three weeks just to lay out with full detail what is so
how do you play . 4359780_4360470
whatever . 4361160_4361320
how do you play chess . 4361380_4362220
how do you play golf . 4362570_4363020
how do you play this or that . 4363900_4364420
and then get literally . 4365060_4366390
now I'm talking about collecting these documents where they list
and then there are the things to do with that catalog . 4372460_4374530
alright . 4376030_4376140
the things to do with that catalog are the things doable with that
this this tripartite distinction between analytic right rules
then developing the consequences of that which is the society
the fact that you can now have the where all the basic rules stand
okay . 4413040_4413260
and then generalizing that so that you can get into really gorgeous
all of that then is developed in about three weeks . 4426620_4429350
okay . 4430600_4430780
when that's done then comes to work of showing the fleas in the
then it's given freely . 4438060_4438980
look you wanna make a reputation . 4439450_4440700
I'll . 4440750_4440820
give you work in hand . 4441040_4441790
you can from now on write analytic studies of games and every
okay . 4458260_4458380
so whatever it is then we can elucidate out_of the properties of
alright . 4471310_4471420
strong modeled accounts &-uh what the structures of action are that
that model now permits the modeling of all right . 4476590_4481300
well as now starts the fleas . 4482280_4484220
yeah . 4484470_4484530
okay . 4485110_4485200
the fleas in the ointment are those properties that the collect to
all the basic rules of a game . 4490860_4492160
have &-um given that its completeness is not furnished by the by
then you what you find is that the collection all the basic rules
that's taken from Escher right . 4517710_4520450
it's not that it's it's goofy . 4521610_4522700
that's not what's being said . 4523100_4523930
it's that what you see with an Asher drawing is for example the
and you've all seen that &-uh is that &-uh it intends a real
right . 4538050_4538210
the thing that's interesting about it intending a real triangle
and examined that makes of it a specific lunacy . 4550750_4554700
well the thing that makes it a lunacy . 4555560_4556870
is not that he draws things . 4557070_4558190
let's say he draws these volumes or say that don't satisfy the
of of &-uh plain geometry . 4565130_4565880
it's rather that it's because <he's drawing> he's drawing
and thereby is exploiting the paper and writings waves that he can
and in the exploitation of paper and pencils ways you can now then
so that's an Asurian model . 4606590_4608080
then of of say &-uh this triangles . 4608280_4613050
well the collection all the basic rules of the game is an Asurian
all the basic rules of play as a complete collection for persons .
it turns on talkings ways in fact much more definitely . 4626810_4631660
it turns on the properties of the natural language dependent
which is to say doing it between us doing it with the resources of
and this which not is never brought under examination but is itself
that would be a flee . 4678270_4678950
okay . 4680750_4680860
there's the matter of not only claiming it but in the work that you
subjected them to this this three weeks of making the best you
and then proceeding then to use as get into the work of actually
&-uh wherein are the Airbus and the Airbus are are take away
I mean it's not that they take them away . 4726030_4727340
it's that they trivialize as was I say they turn (th)em into
okay . 4735850_4735980
but they turn (th)em into accounts of practices . 4736370_4739280
they're themselves unfaithful in the kind of counts that the those
they're the counter counts that they that you could find with them
not done in the way they provide . 4753670_4755020
but they're already you like conceits . 4757190_4760260
right . 4761090_4761220
they're available for those who use them who know that they're
similarly when you get to a system like when I'm called the natural
&-um . 4778820_4778910
&-uh you can begin with what sociologists provide for as the
social order and their understanding of it in the fashion of the
that .
this is being done presumably in these established terms . 4825950_4830220
and in that way then provision is made even for reconstructing the
such order understood in that way . 4836170_4837710
&-um the outcomes the big right where the big flee is that the
&-uh don't analyze the the work of cons <of of> of
but they're part of the work . 4862510_4863710
and in fact that part they are of the work is that being done . 4864150_4867550
they provide that there will be the living work of the lived order
alright . 4882270_4882420
and provide for itself as reason discourse in these established
namely it will show itself with respect to a practical distinction
common sense knowledge of what one will be doing in inquiry and
and it will show itself as between and with the use of that
always . 4905240_4905510
however it does it with that . 4905670_4906740
irony does it right . 4907090_4909580
so &-uh that sociological inquiry and this course can be proceeding
and there the work would be such_as to provide for its
indeed the work conceived consists of that . 4945170_4946800
and the problem is to detect and elucidate if that works . 4948100_4951070
okay . 4953270_4953360
doing that to laying out the work then would would be the
then discovered a discovered topic that work is specifically hidden
I wonder if we can take about a ten minute break . 4990280_4991780
and then we'll come back to . 4991950_4992950
wonder . 4995220_4995390
but . 5002860_5002990
you sound so sorry . 5004030_5004770
you should be so . 5008010_5008730
oh I should . 5009010_5009380
okay . 5023940_5024160
I take it that we now coming to the end of things . 5024220_5026830
and then the sorts &-um . 5028550_5031270
&-uh I'm impressed with the amount of work that's been started . 5046180_5048360
I'm impressed with the amount of work and the varieties of work
&-um and I'm hoping that before our party ends tomorrow night that
and if at all possible include me in that circle . 5072090_5074050
and of_course include others in that circle . 5075410_5076540
but I surely have an interest in that &-um in the time that remains
and there'll be time enough then because I want there to be time
&-um I consider that to be absolutely a prize a very precious thing
so I really would like I hope that those of you who have have
and I'll be firstly calling arranging to me person . 5132220_5135330
so whose work I have come to know something about in order that
what the further apparatus would be with which . 5142930_5145570
&-um now that it's I think possible to see that that doing
&-uh can have <a a> a practice course to it . 5158980_5162850
and that there may be something in fact to find out . 5164820_5166390
&-um <and that it> and that it requires that you help
I think that's really clear . 5175520_5176540
&-um and I should think that some of those things might be
but I'm sure informal inform occasion of of our celebrating the
so hello . 5201530_5202260
I'll be very happy to entertain any suggestions at this point or
because when I was listening to it I didn't understand what the
natural . 5225790_5226020
using that term . 5227040_5228340
&-um because it's characteristic . 5229290_5233550
yeah &-um . 5237140_5237690
ten months . 5238250_5238620
well <I'm trying> I'm trying frankly to buy into the the
particularly in the concerns for elicit the the attitude of
it's that concern that I have in mind rather_than say the biologist
isn't philosophically problematic . 5269220_5275760
oh I couldn't care less . 5277860_5278800
so this sure <of_course it's> of_course it's problematic . 5278870_5281400
but then I don't intend to find I don't intend to find anything
find I find more than that I find companions out_of that . 5290740_5293550
usage was suggested to me by John O'neill last year when he
and he thought <that that> that panel would consist of persons
he spoke of it as anout group for the study of natural orders . 5308750_5311700
alright . 5313240_5313370
&-uh his usage was drawn directly from neurologist usage . 5315540_5319060
okay . 5321540_5321650
and with that . 5323240_5323380
and I found it a very cogent way to speak . 5324310_5326570
and it's now Harvey's been speaking for years about about
&-um and &-uh what I find is the other compatibility . 5336690_5342430
this it's not a corrective . 5343470_5345940
it's a deepening if there are some really lovely relationships that
&-uh I mean to make available a certain way of doing and reading
and the natural gets me access to that . 5369950_5371700
and the idea of the discover topics those properties are the
I take that to be an of also around naturalistic what's meant by
constructions better . 5388280_5388870
it does than . 5390080_5390830
yeah . 5392670_5392730
natural .
well think of natural being in contrast to what_if chronological
since natural poses for us the the possibility of &-uh ordinary
take it for granted . 5417020_5417550
right . 5418160_5418260
caring with it all its sciences all its matters of fact that the
alright . 5425310_5425490
we we remain utterly respectful of but bringing it under
it's not the reduction methodology &-uh with respect then to all
we could remain competent scientists to that . 5452060_5453830
we're all indifferent . 5454470_5455310
right . 5456930_5457050
yeah . 5457670_5457730
I think it's the conflict between production and natural . 5458030_5460120
I mean you're natural synthetic . 5462680_5465640
which is almost exactly the opposite . 5472380_5474010
would be a more appropriate term . 5474950_5476560
well I'm not thinking of it as synthetic . 5481270_5484620
I'm not a constructionist I don't have a mindful of I don't have a
and not only the order . 5515660_5516290
I'm talking about the orderness of the lays of the lived action of
not even the lived action of the action known as an embodied course
the action in hand for the rest of . 5529810_5531430
&-um . 5537300_5537420
I think that answers satisfactory . 5556220_5558880
given the satisfaction . 5559250_5560430
yeah . 5563120_5563180
think . 5563410_5563530
own . 5563940_5564000
well don't back off . 5564300_5564980
no . 5565560_5565680
don't back off . 5565730_5566350
no no . 5566860_5567120
this is I mean this in a sense my understanding problem that
well I'll tell you . 5576320_5576890
&-um if it's troublesome given now that <I didn't I didn't> I
<there were there were> there were the features were recited
therefore &-uh the discussion of natural would have to look as_if
and which case I would say . 5612930_5613760
look for the time being any natural will do that . 5613810_5618000
&-uh that &-um &-uh we don't have to justify even the features of
alright . 5634140_5634270
&-um so that &-uh &-um and those remain . 5636070_5646760
I say they're they're waiting for us to get taught and show
at the break I was thinking . 5660900_5661710
well did I make a mistake in not teaching the stuff on say on &-um
and I'm convinced that I did not make a mistake that what I that
that instead I showed you a variety of things . 5693070_5695540
I'm just as happy that that it worked out that way . 5697580_5701300
&-um I didn't give you a methodology as a principled coherent
I tried to show it as a a collection of studies you could get
&-uh then the rest of it is thrust will wait . 5721510_5724570
<we'll we'll we'll> we'll be together again sometime . 5724850_5727450
&-uh there'll be other stuff written or stuff written . 5729220_5731020
and then it'll be available in a different way . 5732270_5733330
and in the meantime &-um there's this gorgeous stuff with the of
well &-um so I'm not at all . 5744030_5753620
I'm sorry . 5759050_5759290
I can't . 5759450_5759730
I can't pin it down cause unless you want to get a principal
okay . 5764010_5764220
we might . 5765020_5765130
yeah . 5768140_5768200
&-uh on the same issue &-uh it seems to me that &-uh what you
and that the word production is to be understood as produced by
let us say but not certainly not by yeah . 5786450_5788660
constructive analysis in producing either the version or the very
yes . 5804690_5804720
yes . 5804910_5805030
I will do . 5805230_5805540
yes . 5806270_5806340
okay . 5807380_5807490
then within that is it that those that are engaged in those
&-um not . 5823450_5824090
yeah . 5824110_5824250
you can say they're operating within the natural attitude . 5824390_5826060
you can say that the rec . 5826860_5829860
the official recognition of it that was given to activities of that
actually provided for it as the act as the natural attitude . 5841800_5843240
&-um . 5846940_5847000
okay . 5848910_5849150
so then &-um Schutz would then be a resource of which you might
I'm very cagey on that . 5856500_5857950
I don't want that . 5858610_5858950
I don't want to go that route . 5859280_5860020
and I'm not gonna go that route . 5860420_5861220
and nobody's gonna make me go that route . 5861620_5862840
so I'd rather dump the whole business of natural rather_than go
cause I think it's a rosy trail . 5868520_5869860
I think it <it's a it's a> it's a reconciliation that route
and &-um I think it's nowhere . 5882560_5886580
and in fact if it turns out that say what I've been doing or
okay . 5907400_5907550
if they found her and we're left then to turn to the constructions
well it's a life misspent . 5915470_5917000
I mean I I could I was Parson's local agent very quick shortly
but it may be that in as as I become inevitably fat headed that
cause they'll require more arrest than I than they had to do . 5954520_5958140
in which case then I might find that . 5959750_5961030
well yes Carsons was right after Ralph and &-uh find very good
pardon I think he . 5973110_5973820
become talk about altruism . 5973990_5976160
oh he when he was talking about altruism . 5976770_5978370
he was now in nowhere inside of being fathead . 5978430_5980780
he was one thing he was under such attack . 5981110_5983530
continued that &-uh they kept him sharpened up . 5983790_5989130
and then he had confidence in his work . 5992130_5993460
so that kept him sharpened up . 5994010_5995100
yeah . 5996110_5996180
yeah I I don't mean to &-uh embrace under that heading of &-uh
and what Schutz was doing after methodology I think was a
&-uh and in that respect &-um the only way they seems to me that
yes those differences which <you can't> you can't really . 6020850_6025570
&-uh provide . 6026790_6026990
just by talking about it exactly and making those comparisons . 6027220_6029690
exactly yes . 6029710_6030420
exactly even the notion of hidden for example has altogether a
if you're talking about the practices if you're talking about what
the hidden of kids talk in conjecture at_least in conjecture . 6046780_6049260
cause . 6049310_6049460
now it's available in conjecture . 6049540_6051170
consists of the use by parents of that development scheme to locate
say kids talk as the talk of children . 6057060_6059260
right . 6060430_6060580
&-uh well when it finds it it finds them there are sped
and the witnesses are hidden means would come into specification
they wouldn't look at all like hidden for let's say the &-uh for
let's say respect to what it is about that collection or basic
alright . 6104270_6104420
let alone available let's say to an analyst who takes takes
and then to operate that collection by all the lovely kinds of
once it's for example become available <as an> as an article
&-um so I mean hidden then stands in in anticipated
so to speak in fact it it remains only as a specification . 6137660_6141410
okay . 6142520_6142620
as something specified with respect to studies that make it
now the thing that's . 6147220_6148190
that's &-um &-um it's to be done with the notion of natural is in
all the rest of this business takes on its specifics &-uh with
now that we're we'd be particularly concerned with then we would've
okay . 6187250_6187400
yeah . 6187840_6187920
that &-uh it's in that sense . 6190070_6190710
&-um my my way of trying to think about it is . 6191270_6193420
that because we're not offering a de general definition of natural
no . 6197290_6197430
right . 6197450_6197600
it's that in a sense which is already there and organized but which
yeah . 6205970_6206080
well remember the idea what I'm proposing . 6206130_6207560
the thing that's common to these systems is that in the ways
they're discovered topics relative to the ordinariness of ordinary
and it's accompanying official accounts of itself as the most
mhm . 6226740_6226880
that's the common thing . 6227390_6228360
I mean the natural then will take off once we've been able to lay
alright . 6238490_6238620
radicalizing and present practice of respect to the shop as_of
&-um so I figured that &-uh it's that relationship that say it's
it finds its standing preoccupation in the the search for and
right and finding then these features as they become specific to
thereby &-uh &-uh &-uh specifies these objects with respect to the
&-um I used to propose to sociologist look I never sociologist say
&-uh long_ago I abandoned taken seriously for my work or for the
general issues of . 6340900_6341550
&-um sociological theory . 6342890_6344040
&-um well there's a way in which the work of Fm methodologists now
I mean it's carried on in increasingly respectable academic
but &-um there's a way in which persons even in the work are
reflexivity has taken on a commanding tone as_if it pose posed a
generally speaking that they could exhibit a reflexive
and that in reflexive accountability as a phenomenon . 6390260_6391550
so to speak in its own right . 6393050_6394040
index account was another invented general phenomenal . 6394970_6399050
I mean it came straight out_of an impatience of some of the people
then you could have index was I say you could have a notion of
can we now find over a range <of the> of the variety of say of
they're so in place over a course of action that these the features
right and what it is that speaking in context . 6461410_6464460
what a context then would look like regardless of wherever that
so it looked like indexical expressions was a way of finally
now . 6475660_6475730
&-um &-um my way of providing for that was to say . 6478540_6485870
no hell that's that's a route that was abandoned . 6486100_6490790
years ago . 6491000_6491390
it was abandoned when it was . 6492200_6493710
clear that Kurt Lewin didn't have the last thirty . 6493760_6496040
it was not possible to go back to field theory and thereby get all
there was no notion of context that was worth a goddamn in the
it was a just a it had merely an logical life metaphoric life . 6513440_6517460
and you couldn't get to the world . 6518880_6519580
you couldn't get to the actual world of the in the looks of things
you hadn't said to be constructing it all over again . 6523180_6524990
you were dealing with structures as they were needed . 6525800_6528140
meaning <that a> that a con that a model of it was a thing that
so you put it together in_order_to get keep the work going . 6535180_6537990
okay . 6540190_6540380
I'm putting that aside . 6540400_6541230
and I'm putting aside just as I put aside issues . 6541860_6543910
I I've refusing any longer take is seriously issues in study of
similarly in the general study of practical action . 6551870_6554230
right . 6555410_6555540
so I've put aside say at methodology . 6557220_6559750
then there's no more &-um to be taken seriously on that score . 6559830_6565060
and in putting that aside I told the students look my cause . 6565490_6568720
I think you change your intellectual life . 6569360_6570700
I figured what I want to be getting a look at from now on are these
my kids talk and cues right and playing games &-uh and traffic flow
&-um and &-um in the search for discovered topics . 6583620_6591870
okay . 6593550_6593710
and I think if I needed to talk in principle once more then I would
well what the hell is that . 6604860_6605420
the methodology I'd say . 6605760_6606620
well it's a search work and the most ordinary things in the world .
it's a search for discovery topics . 6610540_6611710
okay . 6613960_6614050
but then what the hell . 6614130_6614900
I mean that only postpones the work . 6615920_6618250
I mean it postpones the issue you still have to unless you're going
then you're attempting to elucidate that claim by by &-uh
well who's natural . 6635530_6637590
who's who . 6642210_6643000
notion of discovery . 6643430_6644180
alright . 6644980_6645200
oh whose notion of demonstration . 6646300_6647650
whose notion of signs so on . 6647670_6649970
it's exactly in that sense . 6654610_6655540
but I don't like it . 6655610_6656300
but you don't like what . 6657480_6658090
I don't like natural . 6658590_6658800
the more you talk the don't like it . 6659990_6661100
I mean I like ordinary a lot better . 6661370_6662810
&-um and I think maybe there's a difference between the two that
but the other thing about it it seems like something like . 6670440_6673400
I mean it's something that people will pick up and carry you know
the wrong . 6679320_6679520
wrong kinds of ways . 6680350_6681450
okay . 6681970_6682110
if you're looking for something new you don't need this . 6682800_6684540
right you know . 6684960_6685490
yeah . 6685890_6686010
right . 6686530_6686650
you can pet . 6687260_6687890
yeah . 6688250_6688370
so in in the simplicity and the ordinary . 6688730_6691520
you would suggestions just going direct just speaking instead_of
yeah . 6696450_6696510
I like that . 6696830_6697120
it just seems to me that that's what those heavy words . 6698200_6700880
yeah . 6701090_6701220
that sociologists take on to look important . 6701630_6703950
fair enough fair . 6705170_6706090
enough . 6706140_6706260
I don't like it . 6706570_6706980
I might be conjured the generality of it . 6714690_6716410
absolutely . 6717310_6717930
okay . 6718350_6718450
you don't need that's . 6718630_6719410
okay . 6720970_6721180
maybe we can dump assistance . 6723770_6724770
I'm serious . 6727680_6728060
absolutely . 6728390_6729010
it's a crummy word . 6729530_6729890
crum word crummy word . 6730210_6731570
but I don't know what the hell else to do . 6731680_6732770
I didn't wanna call it civil ordinary activities . 6737390_6738550
cause I'm I'm out for something more . 6738980_6741800
I'm out for the co <for the> for the the deliverable work
say coherence . 6754700_6755210
yeah . 6755390_6755450
studies of coherence ordinary objects . 6756680_6758170
yes . 6758220_6758250
I mean avoiding activities . 6758600_6759060
thank you except that coherence is not beyond not the last word . 6760270_6766490
I mean what's coherence . 6768570_6769460
we have to speak for other things like consistency and cogency . 6769530_6772330
right . 6772870_6772980
and they're all to be found again . 6773650_6774710
although the coherence is that's there's no question that the big
that's really nice . 6783210_6783580
I like that better than systems make that substitution unique
not only that but if I use coherence I can get a_lot_of adjectives
whereas systems looks like I'm down I'm not take serious . 6800570_6808040
yes . 6808360_6808390
I can get rid of the systems stair huh . 6808840_6810660
I can get rid of the systems can get rid of the system stairs
I mean get rid of the buddies I'll assigned . 6820440_6823130
yes that's . 6828730_6829120
yeah . 6840590_6840690
I didn't quite understand what you refer to . 6841540_6843560
quite in the closing moment of your with the . 6844320_6847990
break . 6848060_6848270
yeah I wonder . 6848550_6849210
you could run that by again . 6849350_6850190
what qualities of your presentation . 6850490_6855230
which what in nature presentation was lost . 6856080_6860170
or was that last the last references . 6860560_6865410
the point I was making was that &-um providing for the the
all the basic rules of the gang . 6894090_6895160
alright . 6896650_6896760
provided for the property of the completeness of that collection by
you can read it there . 6906800_6907360
alright . 6908180_6908320
is to provide for what completeness in that collection could
by using &-um that we'll call it . 6916940_6920980
we'll call it the the analytic machinery as an Asurian model of
it's because it is the Cherian character of that analytic version
&-um is providing for that by the peculiar thing that you can do by
and the kind things that're drawing will permit you to show as a
okay . 6997880_6997980
it's that sense of the Asurian character of &-uh that collection .
what I'm saying is that social science models are have Asurian
that's what blends in the cogency that's not even that lens . 7013300_7024700
that's for users . 7025040_7025820
&-uh what grounds them in a sense of &-uh whatever the sense of
the structures they're depicting . 7034560_7035490
I don't think that that's all I hear the notion of system to be a
where what the notion of a system does is to provide you &-uh an
the co the thing being proved is in fact the coherence of that
okay . 7100320_7100520
so I see in fact that the substitution easily met and preserves
and the work of the conversational analysis . 7109310_7110650
&-um you might think of the uses of social systems in social
where what you find . 7123890_7124780
for example whether you're dealing with either Parsons or you're
&-uh &-uh diagramming of box . 7131620_7133940
you know link boxes with the idea of <they're sequentially>
so . 7156700_7156800
and the device permits you to do that given the exigencies that
so you must do that proving right within the fact that it's a
&-um it's the natural language dependent depictions <that you're>
show it as as provable define what provable could be all right
find the proof . 7187670_7188350
show the proof . 7188650_7189140
so the systems are really neat for being able to demonstrate that
so for example functional analysis is an un diagram Mable but
okay . 7211200_7211300
it's also thereby a practical device for demonstrating the
and the co it's a principle to count of the coherence of the
alright . 7235040_7235190
&-um so on . 7237420_7238910
very similar spoken even if . 7250910_7257630
so that's the problem that . 7259390_7322460
yeah . 7271720_7271930
well will a footnote do it . 7277900_7279090
we've come to the end . 7296030_7296930
I speak can I speak to the organizational questions asked about . 7299410_7301750
before . 7301800_7301970
yeah . 7302380_7302510
sure . 7302660_7302780
&-um on on the question of organization and and continuity
&-um we we do expect there will be some continuing meetings by
and &-um through the coming year at Bu and I hope also that &-uh
so &-um for those of you that &-um have hopes of continuing some of
&-uh this summer or work that you may have started even earlier . 7342230_7344140
&-um I certainly hope that we'll be successful in in getting
&-uh lemme before we break up . 7358690_7359700
let me &-uh lemme &-um let me say something nice to you . 7359720_7363870
&-um &-um in all seriousness . 7365940_7371470
&-uh it's as you are as good a group of novices that I've ever
I'm when I'm talking about the seriousness in my life of counting
and the thing that I'm I'm impressed with was how easy it was
I mean to hear you hearing it . 7395730_7396860
&-uh I'm thinking that that's because_of the strong preparation in
&-uh that's not present at Ucla and &-um I'm thinking as a first
&-uh so that would be one thing then the other is that for the
&-um I'm absolutely persuaded that &-um you're within two years of
and &-um I really think that &-um if you can find a way to come
right . 7471060_7471200
you must not write critical essays . 7471610_7473320
<no no> no don't do that . 7473500_7474870
don't you do that . 7475790_7476290
but if you stay with the studies then really there's the Boston New
&-uh absolutely must take over . 7487800_7488620
I mean you have the resources that are strong enough to produce
it's really impressive . 7497400_7497940
yeah . 7498990_7499080
sheet copies . 7501860_7502770
yes . 7504820_7504960
that was given to to Georgia's secretary who's supposed to put
and then type them and distribute them . 7514420_7515820
if you'd like we could make the copy . 7517120_7518440
I think what we'll do . 7518850_7519280
simply get them typed up . 7519590_7520740
and then simply mail them out to to person so that there's n
