it was a man .
he walked into the store .
and he asked the man that owned the store .
he said the place had changed in years .
and he was talking to the man .
the man said that the place he was looking for had been torn down .
and he said he was looking for this fellow name Bob .
and he went outside .
and he lit a match, a cigarette .
and he saw this man .
and he started talking to him .
and he just talking about how each other had changed .
and then they kept talking .
and they was talking about the time they had had together at this
and he asked him where was he from .
where was he living ?
he said New_York .
and he kept talking .
so he knew it wasn't the man that he was looking for .
and when they talked for a while, and he said that he would see
he grabbed his arm .
and told him that he wasn't the fellow that he was looking for .
he was someone else .
and he had called the policewoman in the meantime .
and he was under arrest .
did that sound anything like the story ?
can I tell the reason that why I came here to live as a child ?
I'm from Highpoint North_Carolina .
and my father had a tobacco farm .
and he was working very hard to pay for his land .
and his uncle came down to visit .
and told him that +"/.
+" George, you are killing yourself .
+" if I find a job for you in Washington, will you come up ?
+" and work .
so my father decided that was a good thing to happen .
and he got him a job at Potomac_and_Electric_Power_Company .
he was up here five years before my mother decided that she would
and it was a sad time for us her .
and my brother Jack and my brother Jim was going to highschool in
and my father brought a car .
and brought it down .
then he went back by train .
so we decided to move to Washington .
but we would go back every summer .
and stay (un)til school opened up .
my father had this house that he had gotten for us .
and we stayed there .
then we moved into a larger house .
and from there we moved .
my father brought a house in Capital_View .
lovely home .
and my sister and I we would catch the bus down the hill .
Nanny_Burrell school, Nanny_Burrell avenue .
and then we would catch the streetcar to go in town to school .
and my mother was a housewife .
and <we had a loving> everyone cared for each other .
looked out for each other .
and my father stayed on the job at with
that was the only job he ever was on (un)til he retired after thirty
so I had a lovely mother, father, sister .
and in our family, my mother had eleven children .
if but I only grew up with four because the others was grown .
and had gone away to work .
or either to college Lutheran college in Greensboro North_Carolina
that happened before we moved to Washington .
so my mother died .
and my father lived eleven years after her death .
so we all were very very close .
you don't see whole families like that was then .
and I had a very very happy upbringing .
go to church every Sunday whether you were sick or well .
and you go Sunday School .
and then you go to morning service .
and then the xxx at night .
and then you would even go to night service .
and my mother, all those little churches in Washington that we used
my sister played the piano .
and I sang .
but they're big churches now .
but I remember when they were very very small .
so only thing I can say is .
my mother was a good cook .
we were never hungry .
she sewed .
we had pretty clothes .
and I just had a good life .
so I guess that's all .
