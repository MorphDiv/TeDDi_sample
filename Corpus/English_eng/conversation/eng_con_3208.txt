we will now move to the next section of the test→ 43_2565
task three↘ 2571_3424
task three is a role play↗ in which you are the teacher↗ 3908_6863
and we are your students↘ 7119_8468
your task is to teach us a common term or concept from 8907_12144
your field of study↘ 12147_13187
if you cannot think of a term we will provide you with 13577_16500
a list of terms from which you can choose↘ 16498_18797
you will have seven minutes to teach us your ↑term or 19482_22405
concept↘ 22421_23045
as you explain this term or concept↗ we may interrupt 23744_26688
you to ask questions↗ and we may also ask questions 26690_29896
after you have finished↘ 29901_31272
there are four issues to consider as you prepare↘ 31728_34272
can you five a formal definition of this term↗ 34865_37233
can you explain why this term is important in your field 37566_40163
of study↗ 40174_40846
how will you begin your explanation and how can you be: 41352_44296
sure that your audience understands what the term means↗ 44305_47271
can you make the definition clearer or simpler by using 47744_50880
examples↗ analogies↗ or the blackboard↘ 50885_53387
you will have one minute to prepare what you want to say↘ 54019_56601
during this time you may use a scrap piece of paper↗ or 57097_60227
the blackboard to prepare↘ 60227_61449
if you have any- (0.3) a term or concept in mind↗ 62038_64609
yes↘ °I have a concept in my mind° 65348_67145
alright↘ (0.4) you now have one minute to prepare↘ 67146_69844
ok↘ can I start↗ 108594_109703
mhm 109708_110194
hi everyone↘ today I want to u::m discuss an important 112148_116014
uh concept in the hydrology ⁇name⁇ ⁇straight⁇ k- strain 116017_119633
classification↘ or strain order↘ 119636_122164
↑em before starting to uh discuss this topic→ 122812_126177
we need to define th- a meaning of watershed↘ 126176_128928
watershed is a is a piece of land in which all the 129288_132995
precipitations that enter enter to this piece of land 132993_136518
(0.4) ∙just drain to one outlet↘ 136519_138956
this outlet could be a u:::m lake could be a pond→ or 138951_142748
any other water ⁇of⁇ body 142764_144519
so um I want to demonstrate it with a um (0.7) 144872_149512
paper↘ ⁇suppose that⁇ this is a piece of land↘ 149517_152611
there are lots of um mountains surrounding this area↗ 152974_157155
so every precipitation that fall into this (0.3) 158803_162974
piece of land or this mountains↗ (0.3) will uh 162975_166997
⁇rain⁇ into: one↗ 166992_169189
outlet↘ this is our outlet↘ 171709_173992
and as I said this could be a pond or lake or anything 175895_179559
else↘ 179550_180105
so um (0.3) we have em XXX with different extended 180781_186141
uh ⁇depend⁇ depend on the area↗ that eh they um::: 186146_190280
they have→ 190648_191325
so I want to start eh the string classification↘ 191562_195151
↑based on the hm e- extent of the watershed we could 195435_199547
have eh first order streams→ second order streams→ 199539_203241
third order streams→ and so on↘ 203237_205376
for xxx a classification we ususally start with first 206123_209894
order streams↘ 209899_211275
in ↑every watershed (0.3) e::h the smallest streams 218943_222901
that don't have any branch (0.3) that fit e:m e:h 222914_227036
which fits them→ are first order streams↘ 227043_230521
so all the unbranched streams in this uh (0.6) in this 230666_234874
figure↗ (0.8) are first order streams↘ 234884_238372
after uh ⁇determining⁇ and locating the first order 239293_243053
streams→ (0.3) ∙we start to find the intersection 243051_245931
between streams↘ 245937_247206
so (0.5) ∙↑now we will define the second order streams↘ 251741_255384
when↑ever two first order stream join together and come 255884_260460
together we will have a second order stream↘ 260462_263806
as you can see here two first order streams get 264232_267646
together and we have second order stream here↘ 267641_270894
and whenever two second order streams get together 271607_275223
and join together we will have a third order stream 275230_279022
⌈in general 279908_280281
⌊um e- excuse me≈ 280750_281587
+≈ ok 281587_281891
what happens if a first order stream meets a second 281898_284069
⌈order stream↘ 284073_284831
⌊ok
if eh:: an stream with a order of n↗ (0.3) and a 284994_289826
stream with order of n plus one↗ (0.5) get together 289812_293657
and join th- join together↗ the- eh we will have eh 293651_297661
a stream a a stream with order of n plus one↘ 297658_301461
so here if ⁇we⁇ have a one eh- eh- hm first order 301764_305396
stream→ and second order stream→ (0.5) ∙here we will 305405_308589
have second order stream↘ 308589_310210
and and here as you can see two u:::m eh second order 311090_315922
streams get together and here we have a third order 315911_318466
stream↘ 318466_319021
uh::: in addition↗ uh it's a very hm:::: important 320084_324228
uh::::::::: concept in the hydrology because biologists 324217_328340
use uh stream classification to understand what kind 328349_332285
of plants organisms uh and ⁇existence⁇ is available in 332283_336624
each stream↘ for example the uh plants in e:::m first 336626_340423
order ⁇streams⁇↗ could be (0.4) very different from the 340424_343694
u::m plants in third order streams↘ 343699_346472
um do you have any question↗≈ 347169_348763
+≈ why would the plants be different↗ 348763_350123
↑it has lots of different reasons for example (0.7) we 351055_355653
have eh different rate of erosion maybe in th- eh in 355654_359969
these streams eh comparing this stream↗ 359969_363446
or for example you have uh lots of u:::m (0.4) different 363763_367870
sediments or (0.3) um (0.5) um xxx soy type↗ in um (0.5) 367862_374657
uh different s- stream orders↘ 374658_376770
um do you have an↑y::::: specific example to show 377583_381204
that→ (1.0) image in real life↗ 381199_384415
um ⌈xxx 385454_386222
⌊I mean do you have any ⁇district⁇ or area to show that 386228_390340
(0.8) um first (0.5) second and third streams (0.4) 390345_394974
⌈u::m 394964_395385
⌊in real life↘ 395390_396334
°in real life°↗ °em° (0.6) I don't have any picture 398882_402546
to show it e:::h you no- um to you now↘ but I can em 402532_406617
provide some ∙em some streams with different order 406628_410351
for you the next session↘ 410360_411853
but (0.4) so is it like common in≈ 411871_414394
+≈ yea yea it's common↘ ∙if ⁇we⁇ have different maps in 414388_417887
u::m if you search the internet it shows→ it's eh:: 417885_421784
shows that ⁇catchmans⁇ eh xxx different ⁇catchmans⁇ and 421776_426176
sub catchmans in (0.3) ∙eh in the world or in the US uh 426175_430271
and uh we have uh different maps that shows the uh 430278_434177
orders of these streams↘ 434178_435863
mhm≈ 436284_436497
+≈ we have also a ⁇tooling⁇ uh ⁇ark⁇ map that eh could 436488_439864
(0.3) em classify the eh streams for us↘ 439868_443932
is it possible for like this whole metric to be 445590_447564
changed↗ 447564_448321
↑u::::m (0.7) yes it's possible uh because landscape 449541_454688
uh hm is changing all the time↗ (0.3) especially for 454699_459249
first order streams it could u::::h it could change 459249_462721
by time↗ 462721_463703
uh but eh for hm xxx um hm- mor- ⁇did⁇- higher orders↗ 464005_469605
it usually stays same↘ 469927_471725
alright↗ 475435_475920
thank you↘ 476320_477152
