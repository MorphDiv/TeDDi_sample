So, anyway, how are you doing these days ? 145150_147510
Things are going very well .
I think I had mentioned before that, um, that uh, that uh, that
um, uh, which is very much just, just myself and Guss . 155500_158710
oh . 159660_159910
And that &-um . 159661_160740
No, you hadn't mentioned that . 161030_162050
eh, oh, okay .
okay, so &-um . 161370_163630
eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at,
And, &-uh . 163100_169250
Well i-, well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to, to
So &-um . 170130_176440
oh . 175710_176000
So things are going extremely well .
So, I had one client who said that he'd pay me a minimum amount .
You know, he'd, he, uh, there would be a minimum amount of work, of
mhm . 188940_189300
Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then so I decided that it
And, &-um . 188941_193930
and, um, I've been getting substantially more work than then . 194560_197690
mm . 197940_198300
So I'm quite pleased, quite pleased . 198970_200830
Well that's good . 201100_201870
So, um, so I have a bunch of &-uh work that I need to do on my flat
I've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for
But, it should, uh, it should come out this year . 202310_214010
oh, well that's good . 214260_215390
It should be done in a few months . 215390_216690
oh, yeah I remember . 217080_218300
&=lipsmack So . 217210_218090
you talking a little bit about it at one point . 218650_220950
yeah, yeah . 221060_221770
So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon ? 222540_225420
um .
I don't see the finances occurring . 226010_229290
uhhuh, right . 229480_230100
for a while . 229600_230250
um, actually right at the moment finances are not going real well .
But . 231040_234760
ah well . 235250_235640
I am working on that one . 235270_236400
uh . 236980_237360
&=inhales It's just . 237900_238550
But &-um . 238070_238670
uh, uh, the the the main reason for that is I had not really
ah . 246990_247620
uh, related to a couple of burglaries that I had . 247010_250770
oh, harsh .
Harsh . 251130_252630
yeah .
yeah, but, and . 252280_255060
Not a whole lot I can do about that now . 255770_257400
Indeed .
Indeed . 257859_259010
have to deal with the situation .
And . 258709_260380
So that's what I'm doing . 261200_262160
Sounds good . 262750_263560
But &-um . 262980_263610
Anyway, &-uh . 265050_266030
One of the main reasons that I've been such a pathetic, uh,
I've actually been doing a_lot_of it . 273320_275390
oh wow . 276020_276620
And uh, I turned in my Master's thesis back in May, and I'm
several, uh, articles . 284800_286660
oh, okay .
Impressive xxx &=distortion . 287550_289210
from it . 288890_289100
yeah, actually it turns out that one thing, one little . 289920_293590
bit in what I was doing, uh, is going to turn out to be very
And, uh, . 300090_300870
from what I had been reading in the literature .
You see the one very annoying thing about all of this, was my
yeah . 309270_309620
And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know
yeah .
yup, yup . 315980_316900
But, &-um . 316460_317730
Anyway, I had been . 319170_321030
kind of telling him that, you know, from my reading of the
mhm . 333280_333620
And it f-, made . 333570_335450
w- the one type of solution occur, which . 336390_339840
was seen experimentally, but none of the other models had, uh, had ?
Yes . 345920_346510
They basically, the-, I I'm looking at, um, multi mode lasers .
And one of the . 346530_351730
things that they find experimentally are what they call anti
if you look at the total intensity . 359220_361240
uhhuh . 361830_362200
of the laser, you get . 361980_363520
an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency . 364090_367660
Yes .
okay . 368200_368960
If you look, i- if you separate out the different modes of the
mhm . 374140_374560
and look at one of those, you get more than one frequency . 374141_378360
okay . 379280_379680
So what's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase
Exactly .
hm . 386300_387390
oscillations on these other frequencies .
And . 386910_390060
uh . 390920_391300
you can . 392300_392800
With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency . 393450_398130
in a transient, but you can't find that frequency in a driven, uh,
You can't find so that it will sustain . 405070_406910
okay .
Yes . 407430_408240
So . 408270_408770
yeah, that that particular frequency according to most models . 409240_412720
damps out very quickly .
And so you shouldn't actually really be able to ever see it . 413160_417580
hm . 418320_418650
The only thing is, that, when you do the experiment you see it . 418740_422080
Got it, got it .
I see . 423040_424110
So, um, I found a . 424200_426620
simple modification of the original formula, which unfortunately
And in most cases, uh, insoluble . 434500_438390
But . 438960_439360
yeah . 438990_439260
it gives a driving term &=laughs . 440280_442480
oh, okay . 442940_443670
So, it actually &=laughs . 443180_444780
creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer, . 445490_448830
you just can't always write it down very easily . 449060_451500
Exactly . 451960_452590
oh wow .
So, so, so you, you-, you're pushing forward the bounds of
laser, uh, whatever it is science . 458590_460580
But which, um, is kind of interesting considering that that's not
&=laugh .
Indeed &=laughs .
Indeed . 466180_468870
Be- being an experimentalist, not a theorist .
But &-um . 468580_471800
Indeed .
oh wow .
oh, impressive . 471780_473680
But . 474050_474240
So, so, so are, so are you going to get an article in Nature or
um, actually, . 477570_479430
I'm not sure if we're shooting for op-, I think . 480570_484800
Optics Letters is probably the one that we're shooting for, or
I don't think it's quite that significant, would be Phys Rev
hm . 498610_498880
But, uh, we want to write a letter, and then a couple articles . 499490_504170
yeah .
hm .
xxx &=distorted impressive . 504730_506820
And . 506090_506780
I, I don't know how much you know about scientific literature, but
oh, okay .
oh, w-, I I didn't realize that .
okay . 514680_517110
yeah, so that that's why it's actually a big deal is . 516729_519860
I mean, you know, writing a couple of articles based on your
not at all unusual in Physics &=inhales and . 524210_528090
yeah . 527490_527740
uh, i- it's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the
And what's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the
&=laughs . 547550_548120
people have been seeing th- .
You know, people see the anti phased motion, and it's true they do
I was having a_lot_of trouble getting across to him that all of the
has this frequency in the transients . 559130_561560
Yes . 562230_562500
eh and not driven .
And, uh, what happened was after I had turned in my thesis . 562230_569480
but before I saw Neil again, he went to a conference in Rochester
this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work,
that their models couldn't show this as a driven frequency, yet
&=laughs . 585880_587850
as a driven frequency . 585880_587220
oh cool . 587910_588520
And s- and so Neil . 587911_589290
then +/. 589920_590270
Said oh just a second I . 590310_591710
+, like a week later came to Bryn Mawr and he said, hey Lowell, we
Exactly &=laugh . 595960_596880
And I was like, well I've been telling you that Neil &=laughs . 596540_598440
Indeed . 598840_599340
So . 600180_600530
Cool . 601580_601930
That's . 601910_602330
Cool . 602250_602580
that's mostly the sort of stuff that I'm spending a_lot_of time on
um . 602940_607450
Well it'll look good on your C V, your resume .
So &=breath so you might as well spend the time . 607430_611960
Yes, well, &=inhales uh, th- no, it's definitely worth doing .
um, . 613570_617730
and I would have been spending more time on it if it weren't for uh
oh yeah but . 623480_624710
that I've been dealing with . 624010_625090
So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park . 625210_627550
Yes . 627680_628140
&=lipsmack yeah, okay .
yeah . 628600_629600
I mean the thing that i- this place is incredibly easy to break
oh . 630520_630840
It's not a question of whether or not, &-uh . 636000_639070
you know, that, that was easy, it was just that no one really knew
Exactly .
Exactly .
yeah . 645340_646870
And so the problem is that now they found out that it's worth
yeah . 651170_651420
And unfortunate^ly .
Well, i- it's kind of odd .
They've stolen very weird things for the most part . 651440_658480
hm . 659150_659400
A- as far yeah as a .
The first time they broke in, they . 659340_663710
what they stole was just bizarre, mostly worthless . 664170_668270
stuff . 668910_669440
And, &-uh . 670690_672070
huh . 671840_672090
the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they
Unfortunately, because it's a nice preamplifier, it has an off
&=breath . 688310_688930
which makes the thing that they stoled absolutely worthless . 688810_691880
huh &=laughing:breath . 692990_693720
So . 695850_696310
That's &=distortion bizarre .
Bizarre . 696370_697750
So, so so when they broke in the second time did they steal the uh,
Actually, no, all they stole the second time was my bike . 702640_706090
huh . 707010_707350
Which was actually where the major problem came . 707350_710610
Exactly .
Exactly .
yeah . 710880_712420
Is that I suddenly had no transportation .
And so, . 711440_715290
I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike, and
mm . 720470_720890
that that cost me a_lot_of time . 720471_722660
yeah .
Exactly . 723100_724060
Because, yes . 723101_724000
Spending a_lot_of time hunting for bikes, and . 724820_727140
nah well . 727970_728660
then getting one purchased, and then having to, . 728260_730680
you know, go get it and things like that .
But, . 731230_733450
that's dealt with at least .
And so . 734320_736030
uh, that's &=breath yeah . 737520_739590
at least dealt with .
Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this .
But . 740030_744960
yeah . 745240_745610
yeah .
At least . 745630_747100
Well that would make sense &=distortion . 746550_747720
during the summer I can actually, . 747660_750270
uh . 751130_751570
according to the stipulations of my grant, or my fellowship, I ca
