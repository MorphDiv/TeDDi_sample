if it requires a decimal, certainly . 0_1365
could it be you get six and eight ? 1365_3315
well, how many pieces of data are on each side ? 3315_6003
how many pieces of data all together ? 6003_9380
um, fourteen . 9380_10628
fourteen, so how many on each side ? 10628_12716
seven . 12716_14068
so numbers one through to ? 14068_16274
seven . 16274_16813
and from ? 16813_18131
oh, yeah ! 18131_18670
seven . 18670_19188
okay Tam, how'd you calculate the mean ? 19188_44341
four twenty eight over fourteen . 44341_45946
xxx which is approximately thirty point five seven . 45946_51250
to two decimal places, thirty five was it ? 51250_54923
sorry ? 54923_57681
thirty point five seven . 57681_59041
thank you . 59041_59480
thirty point five seven . 59480_61890
who had thirty point five seven as the mean ? 61890_64378
anyone not ? 64378_66075
oh I I didn't do that . 66075_67720
I had it as a fraction three and four sevenths . 67720_69778
fine . 69778_70731
okay, the median, the middle score which is the one we were talking about +... 70731_75241
alissa, what was the seventh score ? 75241_79721
um, twenty eight . 79721_81793
who used the cumulative frequency column to find it ? 81793_84361
good . 84361_85688
so we came down to the seventh score and found it to be twenty eight, down to the eighth score, twenty nine . 85688_92375
the &~av average of twenty eight and twenty nine ? 92375_95135
twenty eight point five . 95135_96330
who had twenty eight point five as the median ? 96330_99823
good, and the mode . 99823_101440
what is the mode ? 101440_102343
the one with the highest frequency . 102343_104275
okay, and what is that ? 104275_105808
twenty five . 105808_107096
twenty five . 107096_107640
good . 107640_108400
who had all three points correct ? 108400_110318
well done . 110318_111230
all right, now let's look at that five number summary . 111230_116128
all right ? 116128_118151
the five number summary, what is the five number summary, Tam ? 118151_121495
um, the lowest score, <the lower quartile> , the median the upper quartile and the highest score . 121495_124740
<yes> . 124740_129259
correct . 129259_129691
would you find those please . 129691_131540
can we use our calculators ? 131540_151175
certainly, yep . 151175_152763
xxx I'm sort of stopped here . 152763_164481
all right . 164481_165281
finding the lower quartile . 165281_167616
well, remember the lower quartile is going to be the midpoint of that lower range, yeah ? 167616_173540
so have we used one of those pieces of data to obtain this median ? 173540_178791
no . 178791_179273
no, so all pieces of data that are in that lower range are in play . 179273_184121
so how many pieces are there ? 184121_185423
what do you mean ? 185423_187856
well, how many pieces of data did I have all together ? 187856_190440
forty three . 190440_191615
oh, twenty two . 191615_193015
how many pieces of data ? 193015_195523
fourteen . 195523_196195
fourteen, right ? 196195_197210
so how many on each side ? 197210_198273
seven . 198273_198795
seven . 198795_199331
now we used the seventh and eighth to generate that median, yeah ? 199331_203995
but we haven't used a piece of data, one of our pieces of data as the median, have we ? 203995_211713
it was the average of those two . 211713_213108
so the seventh and eighth piece of data is still in play . 213108_217193
so you do one through seven . 217193_218601
one to seven, so what is the midpoint there ? 218601_220801
xxx . 220801_221841
that's it +... 221841_222768
anybody else having trouble finding the first and third quartile ? 222768_228096
yes . 228096_228513
listen in, listen in then . 228513_230926
don't forget when we are finding the median, we had the full fourteen pieces of data, yes ? 230926_236231
yep . 236231_236641
yes . 236641_237410
data numbers one to seven on the right hand side, we moved the seventh and eighth piece of data in to find the median . 237410_246055
yeah . 246055_246503
now, we haven't used one of our pieces of data as the actual median, have we ? 246503_251695
we found the average of the seventh and eighth piece . 251695_254973
therefore, the seventh and eighth piece of data can still remain in play when we are trying to find the first and third quartile . 254973_262830
yeah . 262830_263405
so how many pieces of data do I now have on the right hand side ? 263405_266135
one to seven . 266135_266676
one to seven . 266676_267406
and the lower quartile is going to be the ? 267406_270428
four . 270428_271093
four . 271093_271590
the midpoint of that of data pieces one to seven . 271590_275501
so you now look for the fourth piece of data . 275501_278645
anyone not finished ? 278645_305221
okay, let's have a look please . 305221_307883
Michael, low score ? 307883_313323
twenty two . 313323_314353
lower quartile ? 314353_316658
twenty five . 316658_317801
median . 317801_319850
twenty eight point five . 319850_321625
upper quartile . 321625_324660
thirty six . 324660_325490
and the high score . 325490_327298
forty three . 327298_328468
who agrees with Michael ? 328468_329938
well done . 329938_332161
would you now construct a box plot . 332161_334841
a box and whisker plot, yes . 334841_340533
yep . 340533_342196
no, you first of all are going to have to draw up your own scale, aren't you ? 342196_350963
now, is your scale is your scale going to start at zero ? 350963_357796
no . 357796_359100
if it does, imagine the length of the scale that you're going to need, right ? 359100_364018
so we are going to break that scale, and where do you think you'd start it ? 364018_368123
low score of twenty two, high score of forty three . 368123_371360
twenty one . 371360_372591
twenty one ? 372591_373910
you could start it at twenty two if you wish . 373910_376248
yeah ? 376248_378670
Miles . 378670_379895
um, so you said just then, we we could start from ten and end at, say, forty three ? 379895_385855
yes . 385855_386490
or or we could start at one or end at fifty if we wanted . 386490_389561
you could, but think of all that wasted scale and how long that scale is gonna be on your pad so that you can then fit +... 389561_397841
so, it would be better from about twenty to forty five . 397841_399665
yes . 399665_400706
okay . 400706_401555
yeah, definitely . 401555_402801
now you may have to turn your book on its side rather than going across the page to get a suitable scale . 402801_413745
yep ? 413745_414943
um, when you when you're doing the bottom line thing . 414943_417893
yes . 417893_418325
do you put it like thirty six twice and twenty five three times on the scale &~d or do you just put it once ? 418325_424071
no, your scale is just going to indicate those individual scores isn't it ? 424071_427816
all right . 427816_428208
yeah ? 428208_428680
so you start what what range are you looking at ? 428680_432158
um . 432158_432960
what's the range that you're going to show on your scale ? 432960_436085
twenty one . 436085_436973
twenty one, so you are going from twenty one up to ? 436973_439840
forty three . 439840_440478
forty three . 440478_441196
so you start at twenty, twenty one, twenty two, twenty three, all the way up to forty three . 441196_445398
oh, okay . 445398_445806
yeah ? 445806_446318
yep . 446318_449413
xxx got to this point . 449413_450901
um, do we just draw a line ? 450901_453116
draw in the box, yeah . 453116_454341
yep . 454341_454916
that's it . 454916_462090
yes . 462090_464346
why would it be better to start at twenty one than twenty two ? 464346_467451
why would it ? 467451_467971
no particular reason . 467971_470348
it's just that you you're not going to start your actual plot right on the extremities of your scale . 470348_477203
okay . 477203_478340
all right ? 478340_479150
don't forget once you have completed drawing your your plot, then you must show those five points on that scale . 479150_487100
yes ? 487100_488075
Mister Learoyd, this is this correct ? 488075_490036
looks all right . 490036_492946
looks all right to me . 492946_494828
Mister Learoyd +... 494828_497660
yep . 497660_497980
I don't know I don't get how to, like, do it, how to make the box plot . 497980_501588
do you put down here one to twenty four ? 501588_504458
well, you could go across here because you've got plenty of room . 504458_506843
you're going to need a line showing a scale from +... 506843_510821
now what range are you going to use ? 510821_513108
now you've gotta on your plot, you're going to have to show those five numbers, yes ? 513108_519771
yeah . 519771_520428
now, low score of twenty two, high score of forty three . 520428_525421
so your scale must incorporate those numbers at least +... 525421_530885
and what I'm saying is, is there any need to include from zero up to twenty two on your scale ? 530885_539360
there's not, is it ? 539360_539938
so you might just start at twenty and go up to forty five . 539938_544351
oh, so it doesn't have to be xxx twenty two xxx ? 544351_549601
you could start at twenty two and go to forty three, all I'm saying is that, you know +... 549601_554425
rather than have your plot start on the extremity of your scale and finish on the extremity of your scale, you could have a little bit each side . 554425_563543
oh, okay . 563543_564960
xxx twenty three, twenty four, twenty five ? 564960_568093
