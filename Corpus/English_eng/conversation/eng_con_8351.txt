these star maps will help you identify the constellations that you can see in the night sky in the winter . 367705_372860
the best time to use the maps is at around eleven P M on a clear night away from city lights . 372861_378610

trees that lose their leaves in winter are called deciduous trees . 530995_536860
well you learn something every day huh ? 536860_539640
almost all of them have broad flat leaves . 539640_544165
deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and grow new ones in the following spring . 544165_549835
do all the leaves fall to the ground and we rake them up into big piles ? 549835_553943
or Manny rakes them up for us (be)cause he's better at it than we are . 553943_557130
winter flowers oh look at all +//. 557130_568561
few plants flower in the winter because frost and ice harm them but toward the end of the winter when it starts to get warmer the first flowers appeal .
look for them in sheltered spots in gardens parks and woodlands . 568561_573420
the crocus sometimes we see little crocus flowers here . 573420_577076

bird watching . 667148_668943
it is hard for birds to find enough to eat in the winter so you can help them by putting out food and water for them in your yard or on a window ledge . 668943_676658
this gives a good opportunity to watch them at close hand . 676658_680058

some of them go to sleep all winter that's called hibernation . 718435_722546
others have thick coats to keep them warm so they can continue looking for food throughout the winter .
what are those ? 722546_728726
that's a little sleeping hedgehog . 728726_730650
