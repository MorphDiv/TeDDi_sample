xxx she's been waiting so patiently . 460688_487940
let her say her idea Teddy and then you say yours .487940_490627
I think it looks like a diamond tilted on it's side . 490627_493218
xxx and get a diamond in the middle of our design . 493218_505071
and here's here's another one . 505071_508569
there's different diamonds ? 508569_509880
did anyone today have an asymmetric core square that couldn't make
no .524248_525277
so is it alway true that you can start with an asymmetric core
and build a symmetric two by two design . 530315_533145
yes . 533145_533626
yes . 533626_534164
that's true . 534164_535316
can you always start with a core squrare that's not symmetrical but
no . 542467_543214
none of you showed me that .543214_545382
eveyone of you was able to . 545382_547467
everyone of you took every core square you had that was not
everyone of you . 555364_556449
how many more do you think we have to test before we can say you
one hundred million thousand . 560436_563354
we would probably have to test all the core squares in the world . 563354_567459
