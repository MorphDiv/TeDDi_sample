volunteer to read our quote of the week ? 73251_76245
Michelle ? 76245_78611
+" what is the best what is best in mathematics deserves not merely to be learned as a task . 78611_85755
+" but to be assimilated as a part of daily thought, and brought again and again before the mind with ever renewed encouragement . 85755_96218
very good . 96218_96723
what does that mean, anybody ? 96723_98388
Patrick ? 98388_99363
it means to not think of math as a like as not something fun to do and only use it in school but to use it in your everyday life . 99363_109443
very good . 109443_110023
anybody else ? 110023_110568
Brandon ? 110568_111023
that math is around you all the time . 111023_113403
that's correct . 113403_114226
and it means don't just learn it as a because you have to . 114226_120105
learn it because you want to and have it as a part of your daily life because math is ? 120105_124490
power . 124490_125420
all right . 125420_126655
good . 126655_126953
okay . 126953_128143
today's lesson is titled +"/. 128143_131920
+" writing variable expressions . 131920_135441
so please title your notes . 135441_137071
okay, I want you to think for a minute . 137071_156290
I know I know you can do this . 156290_157935
there are times throughout the day, I'm sure, where you hear words but in actuality you're talking about numbers . 157935_171825
for example, Suzie is six inches shorter than Mary . 171825_175580
anybody else think of an example that you hear ? 175580_179836
Ashley ? 179836_181955
how old is she turning ? 181955_183156
okay . 183156_184076
Brandon ? 184076_184683
Tom is five inches taller than Suzie . 184683_187963
okay . 187963_189201
anybody else ? 189201_190871
Patrick ? 190871_193640
uh, never mind . 193640_195775
Kendra ? 195775_196896
like, when you're taking a test or something and the teacher is like, you got a twenty out of like, forty . 196896_201753
good . 201753_202130
good Kendra . 202130_203071
Alex ? 203071_203730
your pizza is two fifty . 203730_205208
okay . 205208_206345
is that how much they cost here ? 206345_208368
yeah . 208368_208745
yep . 208745_209096
they rip you off . 209096_210216
Tim ? 210216_210718
like my shoe size is like twelve and xxx are xxx . 210718_214905
compared to maybe somebody else's ? 214905_216448
yeah . 216448_217040
okay, good . 217040_217495
now, I want you to think of here . 217495_221991
say you have an after school job . 221991_224345
you make seven dollars an hour . 224345_226726
but this week, you're busy, you can only work two hours . 226726_232400
but, next week you can work ten . 232400_236545
so I'm going to put up here, seven dollars h@l . 236545_242760
what is h@l ? 242760_243416
does anyone know ? 243416_244553
Alex ? 244553_246115
hour . 246115_246978
it's the hours . 246978_248353
good . 248353_249026
what is h@l called ? 249026_251676
does anyone know that ? 251676_252483
Patrick ? 252483_254083
Patrick ? 254083_255585
me ? 255585_256791
yes . 256791_257368
okay . 257368_257921
Patrick . 257921_259056
a variable ? 259056_260193
good . 260193_260865
a variable . 260865_261833
so writing expressions today, variable is number one . 261833_267128
it's a letter that represents a value that can change . 267128_273751
the example I gave you, that h@l can change . 273751_279208
two hours this week . 279208_281135
ten hours next week . 281135_282378
variable . 282378_286251
yes Brandon ? 286251_289250
so the numbers change, not the, uh, letter ? 289250_292698
well what goes in for the letter changes ? 292698_295650
numbers ? 295650_296745
correct . 296745_297401
yes ? 297401_299585
then like so you have like eight dollars could you go like eight and like b@l ? 299585_303758
sure . 303758_304176
yes . 304176_304831
you can use any letter . 304831_307946
so, you can +... 307946_308468
any letter in the alphabet will work . 308468_309178
okay, that's a variable . 309178_321031
what I wrote on the board, seven h@l, is called a variable expression because it contains a variable . 321031_330501
you'll see it up there as one of the examples and the other two are also examples of variable expressions . 330501_338550
can you see ? 338550_351030
so we have variable and variable expression . 351030_367318
say that job that I have represented up here . 367318_374306
you get a raise . 374306_376090
you now make seven fifty an hour . 376090_379138
how will that change ? 379138_380850
Jen ? 380850_383410
there'll be point fifty after seven ? 383410_385381
okay, so seven point five h@l, right ? 385381_388838
yeah . 388838_389601
okay . 389601_390366
Brandon ? 390366_392010
I don't I didn't get it . 392010_393406
which part ? 393406_393821
the uh, the H, seven H and then the four where do you get the four w@l to +... 393821_399708
that's just an example . 399708_400546
that's just another example of a variable expression . 400546_403298
okay ? 403298_404496
okay . 404496_406068
another example . 406068_407921
you're going to an Eagles game . 407921_411186
oh . 411186_412063
Tim ? 412063_413801
I used Phillies in my other classes but for you Tim, I used Eagles . 413801_418201
first the Raiders . 418201_418810
okay ? 418810_419681
you're going to an Eagles game . 419681_421593
they're selling hot dogs . 421593_422593
they're very good by the way in Philadelphia . 422593_424178
so are the cheese steaks . 424178_427808
so are the cheese steaks, you're right . 427808_428971
okay . 428971_429568
but, the hot dogs at Vet stadium where the Eagles play sell for three dollars . 429568_435011
I want you to give me a variable expression for n@l hotdogs . 435011_443248
Marcus ? 443248_446408
n@l, hot, over three dollars . 446408_449873
or +... 449873_450520
not over because that means divided . 450520_452625
three n@l . 452625_454063
three n@l . 454063_454600
three n@l means however many I buy I have to pay three dollars for, right ? 454600_459553
where do you get the n@l from ? 459553_460901
that's I just said, that's the n@l number of hotdogs . 460901_463311
that's what I'm using as my variable . 463311_465271
Jen ? 465271_466261
wouldn't that mean you have to multiply them ? 466261_467981
yes . 467981_468405
that's right . 468405_469453
so if I got two hotdogs how much money am I spending ? 469453_472791
six dollars . 472791_473783
three times two . 473783_474598
good, Jen . 474598_475631
yes ? 475631_476118
can it be like any letter ? 476118_477630
it can be any letter . 477630_478630
yes, Michelle it can be . 478630_479810
good question . 479810_480268
but isn't it confusing ? 480268_481123
it can be any letter, Brandon . 481123_483248
whatever you choose . 483248_484650
okay, part b@l today . 484650_486241
evaluating expressions . 486241_487886
what I just did with the two dollars for a hotdog was evaluating an expression . 487886_495205
so if I come back to my original example on the board here, seven h@l, and I said you worked two hours this week . 495205_506548
how much money are you going to make this week, Ryan ? 506548_511556
fourteen . 511556_512306
fourteen . 512306_513303
how much would you make if you worked ten hours next week ? 513303_516518
Josh ? 516518_517710
seventy . 517710_518409
good . 518409_518928
what we just did was we took the number of hours and did what ? 518928_525328
Michelle ? 525328_526720
multiplied it by a seven . 526720_528176
good . 528176_528775
but what we actually put it in for there ? 528775_531263
didn't we ? 531263_531703
put it in for the h@l ? 531703_532916
well, that's what evaluating means . 532916_534226
substituting a number for a variable . 534226_539171
yes ? 539171_542828
so for the hotdog thing, would the n@l be two ? 542828_546436
yes . 546436_546875
we substituted two for the n@l . 546875_549378
oh . 549378_551241
we evaluated that example . 551241_553161
do you have to write that then ? 553161_554683
or, can you just write like how like however many dollars it was times two ? 554683_559761
yeah . 559761_561601
do you have to write what what ? 561601_563026
this ? 563026_563435
do you have to write the n@l or +... 563435_564791
well normally you'll be given that, yes . 564791_567686
okay . 567686_568066
