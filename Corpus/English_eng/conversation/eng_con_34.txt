okay, the story is about two gentlemen who grew up together .
and when they were young, twenty years old, they decided they would
and one wanted to go off to New_York .
and make his fortune .
and they promised one another they would return there in twenty
and he did return .
but first, the policeman was going down the street checking the
and he ran into the man .
a man who was there lighting his cigar .
and <the man told him> he told him that he was no .
don't be afraid or something of that nature .
but then he went further on .
I can't remember too much of it .
let me see .
one man owned a restaurant there .
but it was torn five years ago .
and so the &~po the man who came from <what's it> New_York .
and he noticed that his friend was wanted in Chicago for some crime
and then <he didn't> the &~po he didn't want to arrest
so he went around the corner .
and got a plainclothes man to walk up .
and and arrest him because he couldn't, I guess, stand the fact
that's all I remember about it .
when we used to go to school, I grew up at
and I went from the first until the I think it was the fifth
and a bunch of us cousins .
our mothers were sister and brothers .
we lived on Boren road .
and we used to comeday@n goday@n God sent Sunday, we were at
and my uncle <used to> often used to teach us .
we lived sort_of like in the country like down there on Boren road
and he used to teach us all sorts of dances you_know in a group .
and Father_O'Leary used to +...
we all grew up together in a bunch .
and and if one couldn't go, the other's couldn't go .
we always had to go out together like if we were going to the
or to the dance you_know <in the> &~eve in the summer .
well <it was> it was pleasant .
I mean it wasn't nothing excite you_know exciting .
and we just grew up there at Our_Lady_of_Perpetual_Help .
and my grandparents, my mother's parents, built the foundation .
dug the foundation for Our_Lady_of_Perpetual_Help many moons ago .
and they used to do that when after they got off from work .
they would go up there on the hill .
and dug the foundation to the old church .
and when they decided to rebuild another church we, the children,
and you know people used to buy them from us at ten cents a bunch .
<it was it it was> I mean you it was free .
I mean you could send children out to do things you_know .
you could walk up, walk down Boren road .
and it was nothing but woods around there .
but now, today, you wouldn't dare .
and all I can say is that we grew up there .
we used to have bazaars you_know bazaars there for us .
and when they did tear the church down .
and rebuild the other church .
they brought out all the old pictures .
and I seen pictures of me when I was no bigger than an arm or a
and it was a pleasant .
they raised us you_know nice because it seems that the children
like, when we would sit down to eat .
I remember .
and my uncle .
we would sit down to eat .
and then the parents would eat afterwards you_know .
I mean it was +...
and then I grew up .
I only finished highschool .
and <I did take> when the computers came out I did take
and I that's just about all the schooling I've had .
I mean highschool .
and that you_know learning that computer because <the George>
and when Georgetown instructors would come in you_know show us or
and we had to pass it you_know in order to keep your job .
or they would push put you in another part of the hospital .
and I used to do death certificates .
I didn't like it .
but I'd had an accident .
and my leg was broken .
and in the government when you are out for medical reasons they
and I mean they had to .
I don't know what it is now .
and they held a job for me .
and they put me in that office .
and at first <I couldn't> &~stan <I really couldn't>
and <the people> I'd be feeling sorry for the person .
I'd be choking up in you_know in my heart and everything .
but I got over it .
I got used to it you_know to doing that .
so I was doing that sort_of when I retired .
but I had a very happy childhood because we all lived on Boren road .
and my mother had to work .
and the other aunt would take care of me you_know .
and we just had a pleasant you_know .
but I grew up a catholic, Our_Lady_of_Perpetual_Help .
which I'm not in in the Catholic religion now because well I
and I'm married .
I got married before I left highschool .
and I had a daughter .
my daughter is forty .
I think Ruby is forty seven .
and of_course she went to school .
she works in some administration downtown .
I can't think of the name of it right now .
and she's buying her own home .
and I have a grandson .
he's twenty five .
and I have three great grandbabies, which I kept the weekend .
I was so glad to send them home Sunday .
