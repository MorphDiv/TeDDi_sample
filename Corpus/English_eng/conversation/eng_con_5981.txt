now I don't know if you guys have the same rule but I have a rule that you can do anything but mix colors . 21613_27357
don't mix colors . 27357_29389

one time I made green into poo color . 34550_41111

I don't want that so I don't mix the colors but tell which color you would like to play with . 47988_52683
<we do not allow> we do not allow mixing but we we mix it . 52683_59143
