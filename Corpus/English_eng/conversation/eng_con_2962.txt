have you ever experienced anything like Grace did ? 3115_5475
no . 6375_7355
no . 7615_8215
I fell and skinned my knee, and it was really sore and I had a lot of blood, so kind of like her, but it was a big gash in my knee . 8655_16075
and I had to hold a bandage there for a while . 16255_18875
no, I did not ever experience anything like Grace did . 20075_27035
sorry .
what do you think would have happened if the kids did not have to help on the farms ? 31745_35285
I think it would be a harder life, because the Poppy has to do all of the farm work and take care of the cows at the same time . 36105_44645
so you wouldn't have as many crops as you did if you help . 44745_48265
and it'd be kind of confusing to me that you would stay inside all the time . 49205_55045
and the only time you get to go outside is in the spring time and summer . 55145_57845
so you really don't know where everything is, if you didn't really help on the farm . 58245_61985
they probably would not have made as much money, because they did not have as many people to help them, so less work would be done in that amount of time . 63465_73085
so anything that they tried to sell I guess, like any other extra crops, they probably wouldn't have any . 73665_80565
how would you feel if you lived on a homestead and worked on a farm ? 88935_92295
I would kind of like it, because you get to do hard work and you get to learn more things about the plants and the animals . 96915_105495
so you get to learn education, but also work at the same time . 105775_108675
I think it kind of feels special, because not a lot of people had all that land and most people were stuck on just small houses . 110025_119705
and you had a lot of land, you had food that you could grow on there so you wouldn't starve . 120405_126865
probably would be exciting, because you get to have different experience than other kids, and you get to learn . 128145_133785
is there a part of the story that relates to another book and how did it relate ? 135445_139425
maybe you need to ask more specifically, like do you want like a character trait or can you refer to a certain part of the story ? 144385_160545
like character traits, like did it remind you of anybody ? 162795_165455
so did Grace's character or Poppy's ? 165655_167595
like who exactly ? 167855_169135
Grace .
she was kind of brave taking care of the house . 169535_173075
that might help us zoom in on the bravery . 174375_177015
does her bravery remind you of another story ? 177375_179955
Freedom Tree last year in Read_One_Eighty, because Harriet Tubman, she was brave and tried to escape from slavery . 180195_188615
I was going to say Harry Potter, because he has to be brave to go and fight off people . 189925_195825
okay .
well I have a question . 202645_204725
I think many people feel that the children had hard lives back then . 206105_209985
and so we have it a little easier now . 210585_213265
is there anything that you think was easier back then than now ? 213515_219835
that's a difficult question to think about, right ? 220775_229035
I'm going to prompt you a little on this one . 243525_244965
do you mean easier now than it was back then ? 245205_247345
no, easier then . 247845_249105
because you could figure out a bunch of things . 249325_251165
yeah .
yeah, definitely there's a lot easier now . 251485_254485
but I want you +... 254865_255665
it would be easier paying bills, because you didn't have any, because you didn't have any electricity or anything . 255825_262325
maybe like finding a lot of land, because now the houses are all together . 262925_268565
so there's not like acres between each house . 268885_271945
so you don't have enough, like if you want to grow a garden or something, you wouldn't have enough land for that . 272705_277445
xxx .
two good examples . 278325_280925
can you guys think of anything else ? 281405_282345
growing plants or making a garden, because there isn't much room now since there's a lot of more people in the United States and there's less people back then than now . 283265_296465
wouldn't it be kind of harder then, because we have all the machines and stuff now ? 299655_305215
but you wouldn't have as much room now as back then . 305655_309415
so it would kind of be harder to make . 309995_313035
I love your challenging questions, this is so good, keep going . 313695_317815
it's okay, because there's no right or wrong answer . 317835_324215
it's what you think . 324375_324955
this is awesome . 325075_325535
I'm just thinking . 328055_328575
can you think of something easier for family life ? 328895_331695
it would probably be easier to get along with each other, because you do so many things together because you have to work together, take care of the cattle and pick the crops and everything . 335295_346635
and it says they sat there together for the whole day . 347835_353115
so they had to watch the animals . 353535_357175
so they probably had to xxx, they wouldn't argue and stuff . 358135_364295
as five year olds, you were expected to do a whole bunch . 365255_376015
I mean, Grace was five years old when this happened to her . 376775_379675
it said Grace, her dad called her Pete and she was doing all the work done by a son but they didn't have any . 379995_389095
and up here it said five-year-olds help break up clods in the fields, pull weeds, feed, cook stove, milk cows, and even plow . 389735_399095
wow . 399275_399455
okay . 399715_399835
so you're much older than a five-year-old . 400095_402415
imagine what we would do . 403055_405635
so I want you to imagine the work that you would have to do . 405835_409175
and I want you to describe the difference in your life, between now and then . 409395_415595
you would have to wash dishes instead of like putting it in a dishwasher, and getting them washed for you . 416075_421715
you have to do laundry by hand instead of putting it in a washer . 422595_428055
you would have to do it near a stream, or you would have to go collect water . 428375_433135
people are not really connected to it . 433505_436805
a lot of people are connected to their phones and everything . 437265_440645
and back then, you didn't have anything . 441065_442625
you could talk easier to people, like it would be easier just to go to a person and say, hi, my name's Bob and I like to plant crops . 443845_452265
you could say that to another person and then they'd say, hi, I do the same exact thing . 452505_456465
in the old days, don't they have a line to put their clothes on to dry them ? 461115_464155
so like having a dryer . 464715_467575
it'd be a lot easier to get water, because you don't just have to turn the sink on, you have to make a well, or you have to walk up to the stream to get water, so just xxx . 468875_486155
here we can learn a lot easier than they can learn . 488475_491435
they don't learn math or something like that . 491675_494235
they just learned about crops and everything . 494415_496735
so they don't really have a teacher that can come and teach them, but here we can learn everything . 497755_502935
the kids on the farm back then, they had to use the hand plow, but kids on the farm now could possibly ride the tractor and plow, instead of pushing it by hand . 503195_512055
so what was the most interesting part in the story ? 525065_529145
did you ask this question ? 529165_530025
yeah . 530305_530405
okay . 530725_530805
let's scratch that one . 531125_531725
I couldn't remember if it was this group or the last group . 532125_535725
go ahead .
it says they had to collect +... 536005_539785
I can't remember what word they used . 543325_545185
it says they had to use buffalo and cow chips for fuel, because they +... 549205_555765
do you know what that is ? 555765_556325
yeah . 556465_556705
do you guys know what that is ? 557345_558405
no . 558525_558705
it's cow poop . 558905_561165
it's cow poop . 561925_562945
manure .
manure, yeah . 564045_564585
and they had to use it, because they didn't have any trees on the prairie . 564945_569625
so that's what they used to burn . 570785_571845
it's true . 574225_576265
because they didn't have any other fuel, they didn't have any wood to burn, so +... 576615_579635
how would you feel if you were the children for the second table ? 580155_589415
from the old time . 590415_591895
I'd probably be starving, because you'd really want the food, even the smell of it . 592095_596815
like if you go past the bakery and your mom says, no, you can't have anything, and you just keep +... 597715_601915
