to draw a four sided polygon . 0_1655
it is equilateral and it is equiangular ? 1655_3895
a five sided polygon, it is equiangular and also it is equilateral . 3895_9356
okay . 9356_10550
another two boys and girls to come out . 10550_17741
forty two . 17741_18655
no forty two . 18655_20103
sorry . 20103_20565
your class have no twenty five . 20565_22363
twenty five . 22363_23881
the first one . 23881_25171
yeah . 25171_25785
uh, thirty five, twenty five and thirty five . 25785_32888
okay, twenty five, you draw on this box . 32888_37451
okay, thank you . 37451_62280
uh, the two boy show it to me that, uh, when you draw this four sided polygon, the size of these four angles are are equal . 62280_72791
and the length of these four sides are equal . 72791_76230
okay, for this five sided polygon, we called it a pentagon . 76230_80073
this five sides are equal, this five angles are equal . 80073_84006
can you get it ? 84006_84695
okay . 84695_85166
how do we call such type of polygon ? 85166_88901
when it is equilateral and it is equiangular ? 88901_94598
you have learned this word before . 94598_95748
in Form One . 95748_96735
in do you still remember ? 96735_99901
how how how do we call this kind of polygon ? 99901_103005
square . 103005_105148
yes, anybody ? 105148_106230
still remember ? 106230_107261
how many of you remember ? 107261_109738
put up your hand . 109738_110901
let me know . 110901_111293
still remem(ber) onl(y) only one ? 111293_113956
you have learned in Form One, okay . 113956_116461
how yes, how how do we call such type of polygon ? 116461_121173
regular polygon . 121173_122563
regular polygon . 122563_124165
okay, do you still remember the spelling ? 124165_126098
&~r +/. 126098_127556
try try try try . 127556_130794

once again, <regular polygon> . 148328_149753
<regular polygon> . 149753_151170
okay, what is meant by a regular polygon ? 151170_153628
that means the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular . 153628_159683
we call we call it a regular polygon . 159683_163913
okay ? 163913_165108
do you still remember it ? 165108_167395
yeah, okay . 167395_168816
