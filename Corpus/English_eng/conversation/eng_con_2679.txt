alright is the Moebius transformation stuff in here or is it in the Stahl or is it not in anything ? 5345_12285
&-um I don't know I shoulda brought my notebook . 12785_15065
I don't see Moebius in here +... 15705_17065
is that the handout ? 20645_21425
yeah this was that &~co this was conjugacy so it might not have anything to do with Moebius . 22125_26005
okay (0.10) .
I think it must be in Stahl like on around page one fifty nine (be)cause that's what our exercises are out_of . 36005_41925
does she spell Moebius wrong ? 42465_43885
she spells it M O B ⌈ I U S ⌉ . 44085_45865
⌊ well no she puts ⌋ +/. 45865_46405
yeah +/.
+, M O with the two ⌈ dots above it ⌉ . 46645_48065
⌊ with the two dots just like she does in the book ⌋ . 48065_49285
⌈ I think she spells it right ⌉ +/. 49325_50565
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/. 51285_51645
+, ⌈ like ⌉ let me just point to where he's wrong . 52545_54005
it's like Moebius .
I can't say it like she can . 55225_56685
she's like Moebius . 57285_57825
you know I have like this other teacher in four fifty and she was +//. 60605_64685
spelled it like M O E B I U S . 64985_68225
that's how they spell it in the book . 69245_70485
I know . 71385_71865
but in our other class like four thirty three spelled it like Natasha . 72405_79325
so I don't know what's right . 79525_81485
⌊ alright so ⌋ .
⌈ I think ⌉ O E is a linguistic form it's a vowel and it goes like oe@k it goes however she says Moebius it goes like that and it's an actual vowel in linguistics and so I think that's why they spell it like that . 81865_93985
alright so what's r@l hat ? 94305_95405
and ⌊ so does the ⌋ +/. 95945_97145
⌈ r@l hat ⌉ +/.
+, o@l dot dot replace the +/. 98105_99505
+, is that like +/. 99585_99785
+, OE or something ? 100065_100725
yeah . 101085_101305
okay . 102005_102325
⌊ is that like ⌋ +/. 102905_103485
⌈ I think ⌉ +/.
+, R minus infinity ? 103685_104425
I'm trying to remember if it's R minus infinity or R minus ⌊ zero or ⌋ . 105105_109305
⌈ or R ⌉ no maybe it's R ⌊ union with infinity ⌋ . 109305_111125
⌈ plus infinity ⌉ yeah because c@l hat is the complex numbers union infinity . 111125_115105
right so that must be what it is . 115425_116705
okay ? 117665_118825
alright so &{l=READING show that given any three points X Y and Z in r@l hat there is a Moebius transformation which sends the points zero one and infinity to X Y and Z respectively &}l=READING (0.5) . 119145_130505
okay so we wanna find a +... 136175_140795
Moebius transformation +...
(0.10) zero to minus one to Y infinity to Z .
so don't we do it like she was doing (th)em in class ? 153655_157335
was this on Friday or when ? 158675_163155
&-um I don't know she just seemed to do something like this one we want to go to Y and infinity we want to go to Z . 164275_171615
so then we have to write (th)em f@l of z@l equals equals f@l of x@l right isn't that what we do ? 172435_181035
f@l of x@l equals and now we want it to be zero A plus zero all over zero ⌊ B plus zero ⌋ ? 181615_192975
⌈ so we're &~n ⌉ there's no complex numbers in this so that's kinda weird . 191345_194425
(be)cause the Moebius I thought okay well Z doesn't hafta be a complex number it can be a real number (be)cause real numbers are complex numbers ? 195045_203165
yeah +/. 203465_203545
+, okay .
+, yeah +/. 204045_204105
+, alright . 204245_204305
so f@l of x@l equals actually we only need A to be zero right ? 205025_212485
⌊ doesn't matter ⌋ +/. 213225_214005
⌈ so you want ⌉ +/.
+, what everything else is . 214125_214965
so you want F of zero to equal X . 215725_218985
is that what we're saying ? 219515_220215
equal X . 221055_222035
&-um oops yeah . 222835_225235
right . 225675_225735
so it doesn't matter what A is right ? 226595_228855
and it doesn't matter what C is . 229295_231715
it just &~mat and D can't equal zero . 233155_235315
right ? 235695_235855
well we hafta have one of (th)em be X . 236655_239015
oh right . 240575_241475
⌊ so ⌋ .
⌈ so ⌉ we want A to be one right ? 241955_243595
so it'll be ⌊ one x@l so we want ⌋ +/. 243775_245575
⌈ yeah &~that's ⌉ +/.
+, A to equal one B ⌊ to equal zero C to equal zero and D ⌋ +/. 245795_249495
+, B to equal zero C to equal zero and D +/. 247655_249715
+, to equal one . 249955_249975
oh but here's here's what the &~p but we're supposed to we're mapping zero to X so isn't you stick zero in for Z right ? 249975_259655
uhuh +/.
+, not X . 259815_260915
+, right . 261415_261855
+, so you wanna make ⌈ you wanna make ⌉ +/. 262275_265075
+, ⌊ you wanna make ⌋ +/.
+, B X . 265495_266215
you know what I'm saying ? 267195_268675
no . 268975_269095
okay say a function of a number like f@l of zero equals like f@l of x@l equals zero and then f@l of zero equals what ? 270565_281325
zero because you're sticking that number in the parentheses +/. 281885_285325
you see what I'm ⌈ saying ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ into ⌋ the term . 285905_286325
well she did like f@l of z@l equals AZ plus B right ? 286705_289865
so you whatever you stick in for Z on the left you gotta stick in for Z on the right so if we put zero +/. 290365_294965
oh +/.
+, if we do f@l of zero then you wanna put A times zero that's all . 295155_300175
so you want A to be zero . 300575_301475
no .
+, no you don't care what A is do you . 302135_303795
well did we okay did we determine that Moebius maps were like isometries or whatever ? 304635_309655
yes . 309895_310115
so <can we> <can we> &~do can we do a reverse mapping can we map X to zero Y to one and Z to infinity ? 310675_317475
and then will that give it to us ? 317915_320515
if we have a map that does that +/. 320595_321955
then we ⌈ just use the inverse map ⌉ ? 323545_324025
+, ⌊ then there'll be an ⌋ inverse map right ? 324045_325465
we could if it would make you happy . 326905_328145
well because it's a isn't it hard to map like how are we gonna map zero to X . 328965_335205
you know what I'm saying ? 335825_338605
yeah I'm kinda confused about what she wants . 338865_341285
(be)cause if &~y +... 342325_342665
this woman makes me crazy . 346785_347785
(be)cause you're right . 348245_348865
it's the case where like where A equals one +... 348935_352815
B and C equal zero +... 356575_357895
and D equals one . 360035_361295
but doesn't that map it to Z ? 361655_362675
no (be)cause we're not (0.4) . 363995_365015
AZ plus B so that's one times Z plus zero all over zero times Z plus one . 367435_376795
right but our Z in this +//. 378945_380505
Z is just whatever number you stick in . 381025_383745
&=sneeze excuse_me +/.
+, like X or Y ⌈ or Z or zero ⌉ . 384985_387065
⌊ so now Z ⌋ is zero ? 387085_387705
wait a &~min well .
and what is X how do you get the X out ? 390085_393685
yeah see that's what I'm saying . 394905_396645
&=sneeze excuse_me .
bless you .
that's why I'm saying maybe we need to go from f@l of x@l to zero . 397045_400285
alright let's try it . 400505_401225
so let f@l of x@l equal zero . 402345_405805
so that's gonna be (0.6) that only gives you basically A and B . 406805_415565
D hasta be a number . 418885_420245
well that's good we want some of (th)em to be we don't want it to be fixed by the one point we want it because we need to stick in stuff for the other points . 420685_427965
we need to combine it so that one mapping maps three different things you know what I'm saying ? 428765_433545
okay +... 433745_433905
so alright if you wanted to make f@l of x@l equal zero . 437695_439815
oh so we're only doing one Moebius transformation for all of these ? 440475_443115
yeah . 443615_444015
oh . 444435_445115
yeah . 445835_446055
there is a Moebius transformation which sends the points these to this . 447215_451235
so then one of the matrix entries is gonna be X somewhere presumably . 451375_454955
that's CX isn't it +..? 455995_457255
if you want f@l of x@l to equal zero am I right ? 457995_463675
so won't CX plus D or the kind of unknown ? 465255_470335
it means you need . 471715_472875
you need A to equal zero ? 473095_474835
A equals zero . 475675_477315
B to zero ? 477915_478895
B's zero . 479295_480135
then you have . 480955_481655
and ⌈ C ⌉ +/. 481955_483295
⌊ C ⌋ +/.
+, and D can be anything you want . 483815_485015
yeah . 485395_485555
but one of (th)em hasta be X . 485735_486815
⌈ you have to go to X ⌉ . 487635_488255
⌊ no because you're sticking ⌋ X in for the Z . 488255_490135
okay so now you're doing f@l of x@l equals zero . 491655_493475
yeah +/.
+, alright .
we moved on . 494535_495075
not f@l of zero equals X . 495215_496415
okay . 497735_499655
so now we wanna do f@l of y@l equals one . 500515_505555
so we want AY plus B CY plus D equals one . 507395_514195
so we want A and D to be one or A &~e to equal D that's all we need . 514495_518855
&~yea no . 520245_520545
no . 520685_520765
we want A to &~b A and C to be zero B to equal D . 521325_527125
okay . 527625_530825
(be)cause we're mapping Y to one not Y to Y . 531425_533865
and now move infinity to Z ? 535745_537265
so f@l of z@l equals infinity ? 537745_540385
oh wait this is a problem though . 541485_543245
mhm .
she defined what it was . 544085_546305
well because we said B equals zero from the first one and so if D equals zero then you're not gonna get one in that equation . 546395_551955
for f@l of y@l +/. 554215_554835
mm +...
+, maybe this can be done easier with matrices . 555215_566735
we're making a matrices . 567955_569275
see yeah +/. 570475_571155
+, why don't we try it the real way how we're supposed to . 571875_574215
&=laughs:S3 .
how are we supposed to ? 575635_576315
like put in f@l of zero equals X . 576715_579715
okay . 580475_581515
how are you gonna do do this ? 581895_582775
so now we want (0.5) so it doesn't matter what A and C are +... 584355_592595
and we want B over D to equal X . 598455_600855
don't A and C hafta be zero ? 603465_604945
no . 605705_606465
because Z ⌈ is gonna ⌉ +/. 606945_608465
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, be zero .
okay AC equal whatever +/. 609265_611245
oh okay +/. 612085_612585
+, and B over D equals X ? 613085_617025
yeah . 617165_617365
right ? 617965_618245
sure . 619105_619585
and now in the next one we have f@l of one equals Y . 620005_624745
so now +... 625545_626005
that gives us A plus B over C plus D equals Y (0.12) . 631485_636745
okay +... 640925_648125
so +... 652845_653625
okay I can see that . 658065_658625
okay and now we have to do infinity do you guys have what she did in class the first day and made the map for infinity ? 659085_666405
well you hafta . 668045_668785
(be)cause she defined the map that was infinity . 669985_671565
oh .
do you know which day it was ? 673145_674245
it was the very first day she started talking about Moebius . 674485_676945
&-um she said it equals A over C . 678265_681985
was that the first day ? 683725_684745
well I &~ha does it matter what day it's on if I have it written down ? 687325_689225
no . 689565_689885
&=laughs:multiple .
I don't know I have like don't have all the notes from the other day . 690125_695865
do you have it Herb ? 696365_696925
I think that was the first day though Friday March nineteenth . 697085_699965
Friday March +/. 700525_701425
but that +/.
+, &~s seventeenth ? 701985_702345
that makes sense . 702445_702945
nineteenth he said . 702965_703785
nineteenth . 704405_704865
that makes sense because oh wait . 705065_707965
(be)cause really it's like as as Z tends towards infinity or whatever you ⌈ stick there ⌉ . 710215_715635
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
yeah .
no I guess not . 716695_718555
<it's so> .
so you're saying that B and D are trivial . 719075_721895
yeah yeah yeah <she did> she did . 722555_724095
so A over C . 725035_726755
so we want Z to equal A over C (0.7) right ? 727355_732395
⌈ I think so ⌉ .
⌊ f@l of infinity ⌋ ? 738805_739485
mhm .
you want F . 739825_741985
f@l of infinity equals Z and so that means A over C equals Z . 742285_745805
now we solve these equations and put them all in terms of each_other use like the Y equation . 746245_752025
yeah that makes sense A over C okay +... 752805_754285
alright . 755565_759085
so A equals CZ and B equals DX . 760825_765745
so now A plus CZ +... 767415_771635
D X (0.17) what kind of thing are you guys trying to come out with here ? 776275_795275
well . 795825_796045
are we trying to come out with something that's not got a@l-s and b@l-s in it and c@l-s and d@l-s ? 796325_802045
we need to have something of the form AZ plus B &~CZ over CZ plus D where Z's not necessarily Z but where the x@l-s and the y@l-s and the z@l-s are make up those different components . 802425_817005
so we don't want any a@l-s b@l-s c@l-s or d@l-s we all want it in terms of X Y and Z ? 817685_821405
mhm .
&-um well that's not necessarily possible but +... 826235_830795
Herb you know we don't have any class next Friday right ? 832115_839195
yeah I saw it on the &-um . 839755_841135
just making sure . 841255_841915
I was quite happy . 842835_843775
yeah she said she hadta go somewhere +... 843995_845255
I get to sleep in on that day . 847775_849315
&=laughs:S2 I won't have a class until . 850075_851855
yeah Mark said he doesn't hafta go into any of his classes that day . 852805_855465
(be)cause I'll be skipping four seventy five as usual . 856865_858665
my other classes I haven't been there in a few days . 859345_862125
yeah so Natasha's ⌈ not coming so he's like ⌉ . 862405_863525
⌊ I hadn't been there we had ⌋ an exam last Wednesday I picked it up on Friday and then I hadn't been back . 863525_867005
yeah so he's all like oh yeah now I don't hafta go to any of my classes because just because Natasha cancelled I can cancel (th)em all . 868165_874165
that's &~o well that's the only class I go to on Fridays . 874425_878005
okay . 878705_879185
so we have A equals CZ and B equals DX . 879335_881955
(0.7) .
see that's our problem three equations four unknowns . 883255_893855
(be)cause what we wanna do is get A equals B equals C equals and D equals +/. 895495_899815
mhm +/.
+, (be)cause that way you can just stick (th)em back in . 900675_902055
in terms of what ? 902535_903255
(be)cause we know ⌈ what A equals and B equals ⌉ . 903955_905655
⌊ in terms of &~X ⌋ in terms of X Y and Z . 905835_907055
what does A equal ? 909365_909745
CZ .
okay . 910065_910625
and B equals DX . 913645_916225
(be)cause you wanna be able to write something of the form f@l of alpha equals something times alpha plus something over something times alpha times something . 917465_927785
mhm .
what is alpha ? 928625_931965
well I'm +//. 933025_933505
we already used Z so it's Z . 933785_935185
but it's not but because we got Z in the problem it's not Z any more . 935985_938885
it's a different Z . 938985_939505
remember how she did f@l of z@l equals AZ plus B well Z is just that variable +/. 939645_944725
yeah +/.
+, so alpha's the new variable . 945445_946785
+, mhm +/.
+, so we won't get confused . 947725_949185
(0.53) .

mhm +/.
+, D equals B over X +... 1005985_1009465

+, so what if we put in all those then would it be bad ? 1017605_1021365
well if you put in A over C equals Z and then C equals A over Z the &~s they're just gonna start you're gonna run in circles right ? 1022005_1029945
yeah +/. 1030485_1030765

&~we we don't know what AD minus BC equals . 1045985_1052945
we just know it's gotta be what greater than zero ? 1054245_1056285
we would hope . 1057505_1058245

AD minus BC otherwise it would be orientation reversing . 1063355_1069895
yeah but just we're also in the real numbers so you can't have a complex conjugate . 1070375_1073615
right . 1074595_1074895
+, but +/. 1075755_1076355
+, oh I see . 1076815_1077215
+, but that doesn't help us though . 1077355_1078655
like because it's an inequality . 1079395_1081175
so what if we took A B C . 1081775_1087615
did I find C ? 1087105_1088105
maybe I'm just doing this wrong I think I might have found C . 1088265_1091125
Z minus X +... 1093645_1096325
why don't we wanna write it CZ times alpha plus DX &~equal I mean all over A over Z times alpha plus B over X ? 1096325_1108205
(0.9) .
I just don't feel like you've told yourself anything like I guess . 1119965_1122785
no I haven't . 1123245_1123925
okay I got a &~s I don't know I got a C I think . 1124365_1128325
oh but we decided that . 1129805_1131005
that that's not right right ? 1131205_1132125
well but we decided that A and C can equal whatever . 1132365_1134985
oh that's important . 1135985_1137325
well ⌈ see that was ⌉ . 1139105_1140185
⌊ well that was ⌋ in the first one . 1140265_1140765

⌊ well for ⌋ +/. 1145005_1145445
+, and A plus C equal to one . 1145855_1148295
C plus D I mean equal to one . 1149335_1152255
that doesn't hafta be true though . 1152375_1153395
why would it not hafta be true ? 1155755_1156975
I don't know +/.
+, (be)cause the top hasta like the sum of the top either I mean A could be easier or . 1158455_1164375
what &~if what if A plus B equals two times Y and C plus D equals two ? 1164775_1170415
yeah . 1171855_1172715
+, it just hasta be proportional so you can't break it up +... 1173175_1175375
but if we have A and C being whatever then let's make them something that works . 1177975_1182255
like one ? 1183815_1184035
let's +... 1184415_1184975
like what if you made A equal Z and C equal one or something . 1188895_1194775
but they can't equal whatever because in the bottom A over C hasta equal Z . 1195255_1198635
I know . 1198955_1199255
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you make ⌋ it so that it works . 1199815_1200835
so you want A to be equal to Z and C to be equal to one . 1201295_1204175
okay so what if we do that +..? 1205495_1206735
well no then that gives us &-uh Z in the Y equation . 1210275_1213475
unless B equals like Y minus Z or something well it could be done +... 1215395_1219095
it's gonna get complicated though +... 1220675_1223195
so if A equals Z . 1226975_1228915
I think this sucks . 1230995_1231875
and C equals one +... 1232155_1233335
then you've got Z equals B over (0.11) . 1235955_1240475

&{l=READING show that any Moebius transformation is uniquely determined by where it fixes zero one and infinity +... 1625105_1630385
&}l=READING (0.19) can't we do it like we used to do problems like this ? 1649145_1653605
which is ?
like sometimes we said it's gotta be <a fixed distance from here and> a fixed distance from here and a fixed distance from here and so it hasta determine every one in the plane . 1655485_1668505
or maybe we could do it using the minimal motion that she talked about do you think we'd be able to do it using that ? 1669945_1674345
it's probably got a point at infinity (0.13) . 1675445_1678065
because she talked about you remember when we used to do things like this and we used to say we have zero here ⌈ and we &~ha ⌉ . 1690415_1696875
⌊ well here's ⌋ what we can do though we can say if the Moebius transformation fixes zero one at a point in infinity &-um +... 1696875_1705735
then can't we say that it fixes the entire &-um all of r@l hat because &-um . 1708555_1716155
all of r@l hat or all of h@l two ? 1716795_1718415
we're working in r@l hat . 1718835_1720295
oh I wanted to work in h@l two . 1721635_1723135
well since we were in r@l hat in A I thought . 1724375_1726555
okay we can still be in r@l hat . 1727455_1729215
if it fixes zero one and infinity it ⌈ fixes ⌉ . 1730915_1732575
⌊ it hasta ⌋ fix the whole thing because &-uh it's an isometry and it's gotta preserve distances . 1732575_1738515
where is r@l hat ? 1738715_1739755
and how is it different from c@l hat and how is different from h@l two ? 1740555_1744235
well r@l hat is the real numbers plus infinity . 1745845_1750305
c@l hat is the complex numbers plus infinity so it includes the real numbers ⌈ and infinity ⌉ . 1751065_1755545
⌊ how do you ⌋ make a picture of it ? 1755545_1756645
we're just looking at one point and it's just a point it's like a it's probably like you'd hafta like look at the real number line probably . 1757865_1768945
oh on the real number line ? 1769705_1771005
right +/. 1771225_1771505
+, on a line ? 1772065_1772605
yeah I guess so . 1773125_1774085
so it's on a line like this . 1775685_1777185
zero one +... 1778285_1779445
wouldn't just fixing zero and one be enough to determine this space ? 1781125_1787065
the line ? 1787605_1787885
no . 1790385_1791005
why not ? 1791545_1792005
⌈ because ⌉ +/. 1794745_1795885
⌊ oh I see ⌋ +/. 1795965_1796185
+, you could ⌈ reverse it ⌉ . 1796405_1797225
⌊ you could ⌋ reflect right here . 1797225_1798145
yeah +/. 1802945_1803005
+, so then if we keep infinity over here then it determines the line .
<if it's a> if it's a line I don't know . 1805745_1807485
it's not the Euclidean it's not the XY plane is it ? 1808005_1812385
no ⌈ because that's r@l two ⌉ . 1813205_1814505
⌊ (be)cause C is ⌋ .
C's a plane . 1814745_1815765
c@l hat ? 1816265_1816745
yeah . 1817125_1817445
(be)cause you get the real part of the number and you get the complex part of the number . 1818105_1822245
so the point Z is a point on the XY plane +... 1822685_1825805
you know what I'm saying ? 1830745_1831405
so r@l hat is the ones where X where . 1832145_1837025
but r@l hat must be out +//. 1837525_1838845
the line because the it says it calls the points zero one and infinity right ? 1839145_1844185
yeah +/. 1845205_1845365
+, so they're not coordinates +/. 1845925_1846965
+, you're right it doesn't +/. 1847665_1848085
+, so it's gotta be the real number line plus infinity plus a point of infinity . 1848125_1851925
yeah yeah I like that . 1852205_1853285
yeah because the I part hasta be zero so it just hasta be just A . 1854405_1858505
okay . 1861125_1861285
so if it fixes zero one and infinity it fixes r@l hat +... 1862665_1865985
any Moebius +... 1869405_1871185
transformation +... 1874285_1874745
so can't we say it hasta be like a &~f what we need to say is if we pick a point X on this line then it's a certain distance from A from zero and a certain distance from one and . 1877995_1893515
and a certain distance from infinity . 1895555_1896695
certain distance from the point at infinity . 1896695_1898115
because +/. 1898755_1900355
⌈ you can't ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ we're talking ⌋ r@l hat it includes infinity as a point . 1900915_1903035
yeah but you can't necessarily measure a distance just (be)cause it's a point right ? 1904965_1908265
it's an infinite distance +... 1909385_1910965
alright . 1912105_1915425
(0.10) but we can use the first half of the argument . 1916345_1926665
yeah . 1928485_1929225
and +/.
+, and it hasta do with which side of the number line infinity goes to . 1929785_1932805
+, right +/. 1932885_1933245
+, does infinity go to infinity or negative infinity ?
right . 1936735_1937255
so let's think . 1937755_1939755
I mean if it's outside of the interval between zero and one then it doesn't matter which side of the line it goes to because you're a certain distance from zero and a certain distance from one . 1940675_1949175
well you're mapping infinity to A over C anyways right +..? 1950235_1953615
so you're mapping it to a real number . 1955575_1958375
you're mapping it to Z . 1959095_1961795
how can you do that ? 1962745_1963645
⌈ how can you &~pres ⌉ .

yeah so are you doing the problem or the hint ? 1971705_1973825
well I'm onto the problem now . 1974345_1975525
okay +... 1975585_1975805
&~d I'm just thinking about part even part A or any of this how can you find a &~M Moebius transformation that maps &-uh infinity to a number and still preserves distance . 1978685_1990445
maybe it's not an isometry . 1991265_1992505
oh yeah it is . 1993305_1994585
the Moebius group is the isometry group of h@l two . 1994865_1997025
well we're not in h@l two we're in r@l hat . 1997845_1999705
(0.9) besides that you could always say this is Z way out here at negative infinity +... 2001245_2012045
it's weird when she talks about infinity just like it's a regular point . 2017085_2019905
f@l of infinity equals infinity ? 2021145_2022765
yeah +... 2023825_2024785
alright so we have I mean if X &~i is not between zero and one if we're fixing it now for the hint then it doesn't matter where infinity is . 2026325_2039725
so the only time it matters where infinity is is if it's between zero and one . 2041125_2044125
no it still matters . 2045715_2046875
why ?
in fact the only place I think it matters is when it's on a half +... 2047155_2053475
(be)cause only then is it the exact same distance from zero and one +... 2054235_2059175
otherwise you could be like one like three units from zero and two units from one that tells you where X hasta be and what side of the line it hasta be on . 2061915_2070695
mhm +/.
+, and the other way around so I think the only place it matters for infinity is is if you're right smack between zero and one +... 2071875_2077735
okay so let's say that &-uh (0.12) so let's say (0.18) . 2083835_2100635
so if X isn't at a half then it doesn't matter where it is . 2117985_2120785
yeah I'm just mulling that all over in my head right now (0.40) . 2121345_2124125
so then to find out where it is from infinity we just need to see if X minus infinity is greater than zero or less than zero +... 2163905_2169305

do we wanna write it down to look at it later ? 2289705_2294445
&=laughs:S3 .
I need another piece of paper .
how did you get A B C D in &~f in the first place ? 2297725_2303565
yeah yeah let's talk ⌊ about that ⌋ . 2303565_2306465
⌈ okay ⌉ like you know how we had &~F of zero equals X ? 2304965_2311865
we didn't . 2313505_2314905
we thought +... 2315625_2315945
we had something I don't know . 2316785_2320485
I don't think I used it . 2321225_2322185
I don't know but it had f@l of one equals Y so A plus B equals Y and C plus D hasta be equal to one right ? 2323925_2336685
to get Y . 2337245_2337965
oh so you took out the multiples . 2338865_2340365
so because &~s when alpha is one and C is just some number you can't really determine what D is because C and D have +//. 2342545_2358985
the sum of the two hasta equal one and the sum of the tops need to equal Y . 2359285_2362785
&~beca because if A is two y@l and B is three y@l you'll get something &~ridic a just a multiple so . 2364805_2372285
so what did you put in f@l of x@l for ? 2372625_2378845
oh f@l of alpha . 2379385_2380125
so and the other equations I used was A equals C C and did you give me that B equals DX ? 2382465_2396165
yes . 2396905_2398105

so yeah (0.22) . 2448785_2451045
so you're showing that alpha equals zero is supposed to give you X right ? 2472315_2476955

example nine point ten . 3605255_3607475
yeah . 3608555_3608775
so it's k@l squared over z@l bar +... 3609135_3613715
so now we write I equals zero plus one i@l . 3617435_3625435

+, yeah . 3657295_3657455
+, alright alright .

where are you getting the k@l squared though ? 3663685_3665385
k@l squared is the radius of the inversion . 3665865_3667365
oh okay +/. 3667865_3668165

+, ⌈ two squared ⌉ over z@l bar ? 3671665_3672685
that . 3673365_3673725
so I equals zero plus one over I . 3674505_3678725
so k@l squared +... 3679005_3679785
K equals three +... 3680345_3683145
k@l squared is nine over minus i@l +... 3686405_3691145
<tada@i> tadatata@i (0.5) and now we're doing . 3699215_3700075

dadatada@i .
I got two . 3700655_3707355

so you got nine over negative i@l ? 3708175_3711675
uhuh .
okay . 3711835_3714155
I got (th)em all . 3716015_3716875
we want i@l zero (0.16) .
you're right these were easy . 3727475_3728335

oh you mean don't leave it in fraction form basically ? 3841635_3844395
mhm .
yes that's a good idea . 3845195_3849495
well it's still fraction form but they +/. 3850775_3852935

oh you're right . 3854515_3859275
yeah should we make the fractions go away ? 3859415_3863175
yeah you wanna just make sure you don't want any i@l-s on the bottom . 3863235_3865855
okay . 3866275_3866455
+, that's what it is +... 3868195_3868715
whoop .
I stole your paper . 3874335_3875235
whoop . 3875515_3875975
&=laughs:multiple .
hm .
&~so .
did you say whoop ? 3876355_3884375
okay .
s@k whoops . 3885295_3886955
oh whoops . 3887535_3888275
whoop s@k .
yes Herb ? 3888715_3892815
I'm just like maybe I'm just a bit confused . 3893235_3896315
oh we have to do it for that ? 3897095_3898495
silly me . 3898775_3899335
never mind .
alright . 3899695_3900455
&-uh oh +/.
+, so nine over negative i@l equals . 3902715_3905515
no no no . 3907295_3908035
hey I started to sing a song . 3909355_3911335
&=laughs no &-um . 3912495_3913095
we wanna get the I off the top ? 3913635_3914855
oh you're doing the ones in A too you're flipping (th)em over . 3914915_3919555
yeah I'm doing it all . 3920015_3920715
oh .
+, (be)cause they did . 3921175_3921915
so you multiply (th)em top and bottom by ⌊ I ⌋ . 3922995_3926115
⌈ just by ⌉ I . 3926115_3926775
so it'd just equal nine i@l right ? 3927275_3928955
(0.4) ⌊ is that right ⌋ ? 3929055_3932575
⌈ yeah ⌉ . 3934395_3934775
okay +... 3935275_3935415
and the next one you multiply by one plus I over one plus I . 3936995_3941575
nine plus nine i@l all over one minus i@l squared . 3941795_3948795
nine plus nine i@l all over one +... 3949875_3953175
plus one . 3957715_3957935
equals nine plus nine i@l all over two +... 3958235_3961475
that what you got ? 3963775_3964195
yeah . 3964835_3965155
and now you write it in A plus B I form ? 3965475_3967135
mm well you can you don't hafta . 3968435_3970595
as long as you get the i@l-s on top that's all they care about . 3970635_3972935
if you look on page one thirty nine or yeah one thirty nine +... 3974115_3979515
they always get the i@l-s on top . 3986795_3988195
yeah . 3988555_3988795
so the first one's nine i@l ? 3989515_3991075
yeah +... 3991275_3991675
alright so now we'll do number three . 3995975_4025955
(0.27) what's nine plus sixteen it's twenty five ?
yeah +...
now you have twenty seven plus thirty six i@l over twenty five ? 4027605_4033765
yeah . 4034585_4035425
okay +... 4036005_4043125
okay +... 4048005_4048885
so +...
i@l eighty two you take that . 4051715_4052695
it goes into four that goes in like . 4053095_4057235
so .
what &~j did you get for the third one ? 4060595_4065455
negative twenty seven plus thirty six i@l all over twenty five +... 4066755_4070235
the third one right ? 4075335_4076175
thirty six i@l ? 4076535_4077175
yeah . 4077495_4077715
over twenty five ? 4078155_4078935
yep . 4079095_4079255
okay +... 4081445_4082065

&-uh oh . 4190585_4190965
what ? 4191505_4191705
messed up .
again +...
negative five plus fifteen get five i@l . 4192125_4202365
negative five i@l plus fifteen . 4202585_4207785
(0.8) plus three plus nine i@l +... 4208005_4220445
I got four i@l plus eighteen all over ten . 4224735_4228455
hm .
I got four i@l minus twelve . 4230015_4231535
oh but I think you're right negative five times negative three is fifteen . 4233155_4236795
so that would give me four i@l plus eighteen over ten ? 4237875_4243115
yeah . 4243755_4243975
+, so that's like nine plus two i@l over five . 4244155_4246735
yeah . 4247895_4249195
alright . 4249595_4249855
that's good .
alright now we're doing the last one the second one . 4253725_4257185
you with us here ? 4257725_4263065
yeah I'm catching up . 4263785_4265385

yeah +... 4300315_4300675
I got over five . 4302395_4304555
I don't know when you multiply negative i@l minus three and you square it then you get nine plus one which is ten . 4308835_4315995
three where did you get a three ? 4317655_4318955
because it's all over negative i@l minus three that's the conjugate . 4319415_4322175
or something . 4322755_4325635
negative i@l and then you have to subtract the three in the bottom . 4326455_4328635
four over . 4329515_4330255
oh I have a two . 4330475_4331435

did you do that next one yet Christina ? 4370015_4371155
almost . 4371155_4371955

I think it is . 4445235_4449055
(0.13) .
oh no fourteen times six ? 4450315_4464335
six times four is twenty four it's eighty four . 4466235_4468655
(0.8) fourteen times four is fifty six . 4477405_4481745
(0.14) twelve times four is forty eight ? 4490385_4497105

are you done ? 4543065_4543585
uhuh .
I reduced at the beginning so that I wouldn't have to do all those high multiplications you were doing . 4543965_4549925
oh well I got a hundred and thirty two plus sixteen i@l all over fifty two . 4550225_4553685
okay . 4554105_4554305
now just divide it all by four . 4554725_4555925
divide it all by four ? 4556545_4557345
four goes into thirteen three times carry the one thirty three plus four i@l all over one three all over thirteen . 4558065_4568545

this should be easy . 4612375_4613015

+, so now we want k@l squared all over z@l bar plus A no minus A quantity plus A . 4617025_4632005
right +..? 4633765_4634105
so we should take four all over we have to (0.7) . 4635565_4643625
oh so what we were no . 4651585_4652945
what is this ? 4653445_4655645
this isn't a complex number ? 4655725_4656805
Z could be . 4657345_4659265
yeah but this whole thing so it's gonna be four over two z@l minus one all over Z plus two quantity bar minus two no minus three plus three . 4660285_4673885
alright so let me see this again . 4675105_4677085
so you've got . 4681315_4682335
don't you think the answers to any of these might be in the back ? 4682495_4684755
no +...

I'm used to people talking to themselves so if you're not speaking up like you're talking to me then I don't know that you're talking to me . 4716305_4725545
I was talking up but my I've got a sore throat so . 4726105_4729285
(be)cause my boss he like talks to himself all the time . 4730125_4733605
and it's like I've learned to tune him out when he's doing that so I don't even hear what he says so . 4734275_4738995
but usually I don't talk to myself I'm talking to somebody when I'm talking . 4739315_4742615
so can we find the bar of this whole thing ? 4742695_4745455
I don't know . 4745515_4746175
okay so . 4747535_4749075
I think no +... 4749335_4750095
it's rotation over the x@l axis no reflection over . 4752055_4761835
so this is . 4762775_4763295
x@l axis . 4763795_4764455
another k@l squared over k@l squared over the z@l bar quantity barred . 4764755_4774495

+, over z@l bar totally barred minus A well you wanna see . 4788705_4795465
it's k@l squared over the quantity bar minus A let me see . 4795785_4803865
(be)cause I didn't +//.
this is what I was talking about . 4804025_4805685

what are you doing ? 4812125_4813905
what number are you doing ? 4814445_4815445
I'm doing fifteen part one isn't that the one we're &~s . 4815985_4819445
no we're doing fifteen part two . 4819485_4820585
oh no wonder . 4820885_4821825
that's a little confusing . 4822505_4823245
there you go . 4823725_4824185
I just put another dot just put another I . 4824725_4826765
so now you have two i@l-s . 4827325_4828485
&-uh I guess &~w &~s &~ts I guess no wonder there was a little miscommunication . 4829325_4835625
so we have to learn how to find the conjugate ⌊ of the Moebius find it ? 4835645_4838845
what page ⌋ ?
⌈ oh okay . 4838845_4839305
<here's some> here's some rules &-uh page ⌉ one thirty five we got some some rules . 4840085_4843785
⌊ some rules ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ oh I think ⌉ she gave us rules too . 4845815_4847715
yeah she did . 4848115_4848735
what rules ? 4849375_4850055
so this equals . 4850835_4852435
come back . 4852675_4854275
it probably is the bar it's probably two z@l minus one bar +/. 4856695_4861395
<it is> it is +/. 4861875_4862575
+, times the bar of one over Z plus two . 4862795_4866915
and then it's gonna equal that'll be like two z@l bar minus one bar ? 4869425_4879805
is that how it goes where are those rules they're not on page one thirty five ? 4880065_4883625
right here .
oh .
those don't look very much like bars like rules . 4886385_4889645
oh . 4890005_4892805
maybe they aren't rules why am I &~d using that ? 4893045_4895165
no I think they are but they just should've set (th)em off you know made (th)em look nice . 4895545_4898605
so you're right it's two z@l bar which is basically it's two ⌊ times z@l bar minus one ⌋ . 4899745_4905585
⌈ how do we know that those are rules though that's my question ⌉ . 4905585_4906765
I think you can &~t &~e break (th)em up like +/. 4906965_4908825
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
+, ⌈ you can ⌉ get two z@l minus one bar over Z plus two . 4909045_4915145
so it is ⌊ this ⌋ . 4916245_4917145
⌈ bar ⌉ like each of (th)em you can have a bar over each of (th)em and then you can break it up further into two z@l bar minus . 4917145_4924765
what's this ?
didn't she give us a rule like that she gave us through example . 4925125_4929845
it is gonna end up to be that . 4934485_4935645
two z@l bar minus one over z@l bar plus two . 4937165_4941465
so now our answer is +/. 4943765_4945125
yeah basically +/. 4945195_4945635
+, four over two z@l bar minus one over z@l bar plus two . 4946635_4953495
don't we have like +/. 4954955_4955635
⌊ minus three ⌋ . 4956135_4956195
+, ⌈ plus and minus ⌉ threes in there ? 4956195_4957375
plus three . 4957615_4958035
but we need to be able to multiply it all and make it look nice right ? 4958315_4960995
yeah so we gotta +/. 4960995_4961775
yeah +/.
+, start messing around . 4961915_4962495
+, alright +/. 4962855_4963035
+, so first I'm gonna put the three in there somewhere . 4964995_4967795
the minus three ? 4968075_4968595
the minus three . 4968815_4969255
yeah me too . 4969255_4969795
so (0.12) I think I'm gonna start multiplying and getting that z@l plus two fraction outta there . 4980125_4985265
(0.7) .
so we have minus z@l bar plus five all over z@l bar plus two ? 4986865_5003165
wait I got I might've messed up . 5003785_5006165
I got minus z@l bar minus seven but . 5008185_5010545
oh yep minus seven . 5012285_5013405
okay .
(0.9) .
all this &~ti plus three ? 5015245_5025045
mhm .
+, alright so let's just work with ignore the plus three for now . 5025685_5031045
I agree . 5031245_5031465
you could just flip the ⌊ Z plus two up on the z@l bar ⌋ . 5033085_5035385
⌈ we can .
so it's four ⌉ z@l bar plus two ? 5035425_5037245
yeah . 5037785_5038445
+, plus eight . 5039525_5039905
well it's &~f yeah four z@l bar plus eight . 5040345_5042305
all over minus z@l bar minus seven . 5042505_5045425
plus three now let's get the plus three in there . 5045825_5049185
yeah .
(0.25) .
z@l bar minus +... 5075165_5076625
twenty one minus eight +... 5080665_5082265
thirteen so minus thirteen ? 5085725_5088565
twenty one minus eight is thirteen ? 5089245_5090505
yeah .
okay . 5091265_5093805
z@l bar minus thirteen all over negative z@l bar . 5095025_5097425
minus seven .
minus seven . 5099305_5100705
now now what ? 5102665_5103745
now do you wanna multiply by negative z@l bar plus seven ? 5104265_5106345
⌊ or step back ⌋ ?
⌈ no ⌉ we're done now . 5107605_5109425
yeah . 5109725_5112245
I thought we were . 5112705_5113485
so now we have to write it do we have to write it in Moebius ? 5114485_5117005
that is a Moebius transformation . 5117305_5118725
you get +/. 5119025_5119305
+, A is one B is negative thirteen . 5119505_5121545
mhm .
so &~y like . 5122205_5123925
and C is negative one ? 5124425_5126185
that whole expression IA two composed with that is this . 5126585_5130225
yay +/.
+, that's the Moebius transformation . 5131645_5133025
alright so that's fifteen part two . 5134445_5135845
is this what you got +..? 5135945_5136485
I was kind_of off in a daze . 5138485_5140105
yeah . 5140645_5140925
yes .
so now number seventeen right ? 5141465_5145185
okay . 5147045_5147405
peachy .
&{l=READING express the following hyperbolic rigid motions of the composition of two hyperbolic reflections . 5150005_5155705
&}l=READING and hyperbolic reflection does what ? 5156665_5158825
it's over z@l bar isn't it ? 5159355_5160915
oh I have your notes I can look . 5163515_5165455
yeah you can look . 5165455_5166355
hyperbolic reflections she said it means inversions or reflections . 5166755_5171455
over a ⌊ horizontal line right ⌋ ? 5173755_5176255
⌈ so inversion ⌉ yeah so inversion is K over z@l bar k@l squared over z@l bar that's an inversion centered at the origin and this one looks like it is centered at the origin . 5176795_5184035
and reflections over the y@l axis +... 5185605_5188145
are here it is number two . 5193285_5197645
(0.7) .
yeah two is this one . 5198625_5205665
KZ bar ? 5206565_5207285
KZ bar . 5207445_5207945
thank you +... 5208185_5208385
&=laughs yeah . 5213615_5213815
see because you're gonna multiply these together ⌊ when you compose and the z@l bar's gonna cancel ⌋ . 5214815_5218015
⌈ so <we didn't> we didn't do ⌉ inversions here ? 5218035_5219495
five ? 5220155_5221375
we got one over z@l bar didn't we ? 5221655_5223655
oh was that for the unit circle ? 5224615_5226055
yeah . 5226195_5226395
+, oh across the unit circle so yeah it's k@l squared over Z okay . 5226735_5229115
so . 5229815_5230095
alright so we want two z@l over five so f@l of z@l equals . 5230475_5236855
two z@l over five . 5238955_5240455
and +... 5241515_5243415
KZ over +...
&~bu but what's K in this one what's K in this one ? 5245735_5248555
K isn't necessarily the radius here . 5249775_5251555
yeah it will be . 5252635_5253075
but for here but what about this . 5253375_5254635
over this K is +... 5255315_5256975
it's .
like what sort it's like a . 5258815_5260035
I think it's the distance it is from the y@l axis . 5260375_5262375
(0.7) if K equals negative one that's only if K equals negative one so it's only negative z@l bar . 5265375_5273255
negative z@l bar . 5276375_5276815
yes . 5277515_5278255
okay . 5278635_5279715
yeah but we're we want a &~f reflection across a vertical line . 5283155_5285715
that is the vertical line that's the y@l axis . 5287815_5289375
so we'd also have to compose it with a translation or something or what ? 5291295_5297315
do we want to really ? 5297375_5298175
well no she's saying a hyperbolic reflection can be a inversion across a vertical line not just across the y@l axis it can be at any vertical line . 5298185_5305965
yeah .
but I don't think we're gonna need to translate in the first one . 5307705_5309565
well no that's great if we don't . 5310805_5312025
<I'm just> I'm just saying what if a reflection across the y@l axis doesn't work ? 5312265_5317325
what if you need a reflection across the line Y equals three ? 5318125_5321045
⌊ then ⌋ +/. 5322885_5323025
+, ⌈ how are we ⌉ gonna write that ? 5323065_5323745
⌊ that's all I'm asking ⌋ . 5324325_5324825

beautiful . 5326735_5327475

okay .
so we want want ⌊ f@l of z@l ⌋ . 5332555_5334195
⌈ so what is ⌉ Z times z@l bar ? 5334195_5335535
is ⌊ Z times z@l bar equal to Z ⌋ ? 5336495_5338255
⌈ we want f@l of z@l ⌉ equal to Z over five +... 5338335_5339555
is z@l bar times what ? 5340155_5341775
z@l bar . 5342535_5343095
z@l bar times Z ? 5343655_5344715
no z@l bar times z@l bar . 5345115_5346235
oh . 5346795_5347155
+, wake up . 5348055_5349835
I don't know if z@l bar times z@l bar but the z@l bar of z@l bar is Z . 5351245_5356405
that's good though that's good . 5357505_5358785
z@l bar bar is Z . 5359785_5360845
yeah .
yeah .
so . 5363065_5363705
but z@l bar times z@l bar +/. 5364065_5366465

⌈ or z@l bar ⌉ . 5368965_5369425
⌊ I don't think so no I think it's z@l bar squared ⌋ . 5369885_5371225
so we're just gonna start ⌈ with ⌉ . 5371645_5372645
⌊ it is ⌋ .
we just start with Z right ? 5374265_5376285
and now let's do +... 5377525_5380525
so we wanna . 5387095_5387735
how do you get a denominator that's not Z ? 5388495_5390295
well K &~t we have K times Z for reflection . 5391895_5396875
one over five K equals one over five . 5398935_5401175
or K equals two over ⌈ five or whatever ⌉ . 5401455_5403415
⌊ but that's a ⌋ dilation +... 5403415_5404215
but oh +... 5408035_5409035
right +..? 5413735_5414675
alright let's look at what they wrote about how (a)bout that ? 5419795_5421395
yeah you do that and I'll think +... 5422095_5423895
seems like the first would be square root of two . 5428495_5431155
then we have +... 5434275_5435275
do the inversion zero square root of two . 5438855_5442555
equals . 5443275_5443815
two over z@l bar . 5445415_5448215
square root of five would be five . 5449155_5452955
yeah let's try this . 5454495_5458055
(0.12) <I got it> I got it I got it . 5463435_5470575
what do you have ? 5470695_5471035
what ?
two over +... 5471875_5472655
just a second I gotta think . 5475225_5476265
two z@l all over five is that what we wanted ? 5477645_5481265
yeah . 5481845_5482405
that's what I cheer about . 5483465_5484365
that's wonderful . 5485065_5485605
&=laughs okay . 5486205_5486545
alright let the first one be an inversion over zero &~com okay . 5486945_5491105
we're gonna take inversion zero comma square root of two composed with inversion zero comma square root of five of Z . 5492385_5503005
okay . 5503865_5504185
and you do that and see if you get what I got . 5504325_5506405
hm .
I'm doing the five first +...
might work .
that sounds good . 5517645_5520545

so if f@l of z@l equals this and f@l inverse of z@l equals this xxx . 5661845_5679625
four over z@l bar minus minus four plus (0.20) eight minus three is five . 5674625_5697825
five six minus three is three . 5705755_5707055
now . 5707395_5709955
(0.29) three over z@l bar .

(0.22) .
okay so there's a straight geodesic +... 5816935_5819055
how much time do we have on the tape ? 5825835_5828015

I don't know . 6099585_6100845
I was not there either . 6101985_6102705
they wrote division by one into the problem . 6102725_6104625
yeah . 6104965_6105085

I thought so and that's why I didn't park there today . 6145865_6148005
I did but I was like I was already fifteen minutes late . 6148295_6150595
yeah .
and I was like oh +... 6151455_6151995
right above DPS . 6153435_6155035
oh yeah . 6156275_6156535
that'll be really good . 6156935_6157815

you parked at NUBS ? 6163495_6164675
no I didn't park there that's where all this stuff lives . 6164895_6166995
I thought we were gonna meet at NUBS but then you never said we were so I &~d ⌈ I just didn't &~w I wasn't sure ⌉ . 6167635_6172535
⌊ no because I asked Rita ⌋ and there was a girl that was supposed to work on Saturdays . 6172715_6175895

oh .
what if we do like one guess and check will that give us a good idea ? 6183415_6186095

⌊ okay .
why do you multiply ⌋ ? 6202615_6203315
I don't know why you multiply but that's what I would think we have to do first . 6204635_6206915
no but &~what okay so what multiplies ? 6206915_6208895
I don't know . 6209415_6210175
that's your job . 6210875_6211635
the inversion doesn't multiply does it ? 6212395_6214075
well one of (th)em hasta multiply . 6214275_6215415
(be)cause if you look on where you were looking at those formulas that you like ? 6216195_6219035
uhuh +/.
+, it says A z@l bar +... 6222395_6223975
that's what we want . 6227995_6229915
see ?
where's AZ bar ? 6233275_6234275
right here . 6234275_6234655
AZ bar .
all over negative negative z@l bar minus A +... 6236015_6239875
so let's see we have k@l squared all over z@l bar minus A plus A . 6243395_6249555
oh yeah . 6250335_6250735
okay . 6251215_6251275
⌈ yeah it does multiply times A ⌉ .
⌊ so now what they did was they simplified it ⌋ . 6251495_6253515
so let's do that . 6253755_6254415
let's have A equal two +... 6254735_6257575
negative two +... 6261765_6262145
okay +...
and we want K +... 6269585_6270405
let's try making K equal +... 6272725_6274965
maybe just like one . 6278285_6279405
no ?
I wanna make it equal something else . 6281905_6283665
(be)cause I'm trying to get the plus three out . 6284045_6285265
k@l squared minus a@l squared . 6288555_6290015
k@l squared is gonna be what we don't know yet minus a@l squared so this is gonna subtract four +... 6290375_6296895
let's try square root of seven . 6298655_6299575
okay . 6300715_6301715
so now this is gonna equal +... 6303715_6306935
A z@l bar plus so negative two . 6312115_6317535
wait we can't have A equal negative two though because our inversions are only centered at the origin . 6318935_6323155
⌈ so there's no way ⌉ . 6323995_6324095
⌊ no they can be ⌋ centered somewhere else . 6324095_6325555
not on her thing . 6325955_6326815
across a circle centered <at the> at the origin is a hyperbolic reflection . 6327335_6330555
+, so our A hasta be zero . 6332115_6334575
I don't like it to be zero . 6335255_6336835
well what is a <what does a> &~tran what does a &-um reflection do ? 6337065_6343525
the straight line reflection ? 6345465_6346665
yes ⌈ that's what we ⌉ +/. 6346945_6347885
⌊ yeah what's the formula for &~refl ⌋ +/. 6347985_6349045
+, we have to figure out like how we do that . 6349045_6350925
right here . 6351085_6351425
that's what I said . 6352845_6353425
that's what you said ? 6353925_6354505
so it's negative z@l bar plus . 6354545_6357605
R where R is an arbitrary real number . 6357985_6360785
let's say three ? 6361925_6363845
okay but what did they do +... 6366795_6368195
I guess so they just +... 6369975_6372915
what if you have a ticket ? 6375115_6375695
what if I do ? 6377075_6378075
uhuh .
it's twenty dollars . 6378375_6379515
I mail in a check with the ticket and pay it off . 6379555_6384035
it's my girlfriend's car so I'm not gonna like make her pay it . 6384375_6387115
yeah . 6387435_6387655
+, I'll just pay it off you know . 6388015_6389375
what else am I gonna do ? 6390195_6391255
I don't know . 6391395_6391855
if it was my car I might just leave it on there but it's not so I can't . 6392385_6395525
I feel bad it's like I drive my parents' car so I'd never do that . 6396765_6400185
never do what ? 6401105_6401585
leave a ticket . 6402145_6402785
never pay a ticket . 6403585_6404605
oh .
why wouldn't you pay the ticket ? 6405345_6407045
you just leave it . 6408805_6409865
because some people just don't pay the ticket . 6410165_6411565
mhm +/.
+, (be)cause they're just parking tickets . 6412545_6413605
yeah but then don't they like hunt you down and take you to court ? 6414905_6417725
only if you get a bunch . 6418005_6418885
yep .
or if &~t I mean if you get a ticket later on and they'll pull you over and they'll be like oh you have an outstanding you know but if it's like one outstanding parking ticket and you'll be like oh I didn't even know . 6420865_6428465
oh I see . 6429365_6430365
you know . 6430545_6430805
it's like oh I forgot . 6431705_6432445
reflections in the bowed geodesic have the form .
oh once I got two parking tickets in one day . 6432845_6437745
it was like a couple years ago but I was so mad . 6438245_6439925
so &~let's let's just like take a guess . 6440665_6442625
let's say we're gonna take . 6442865_6443805
you know I think we can't +//. 6444745_6446265
reflection over a vertical line . 6448615_6450535
so let's do one of those . 6450835_6451675
yeah we're gonna hafta do one . 6451875_6452475
let's do that first . 6452475_6453195
yes . 6454235_6454475
let's do it first . 6454975_6455575
okay ? 6456095_6456375
let's ⌈ make ⌉ . 6457195_6457855
⌊ no no ⌋ no . 6457975_6458475
let's do it let me think . 6459635_6460895
yeah let's do it first +... 6461675_6462815
they did it second but . 6467075_6468555
well let me see . 6468995_6470055
if we look ⌈ at this one ⌉ . 6470435_6470955
⌊ (be)cause all ⌋ you wanna do is just add on you know maybe we're just adding on a constant term . 6470955_6476195
so what if we say that Z over two z@l plus three +/. 6477245_6480825
let's do it second . 6481185_6481665
+, equals like ⌈ no let's ⌉ . 6481905_6484465
⌊ let's do it ⌋ second .
alright alright . 6485065_6485685
okay ⌈ so what do you wanna do now ⌉ ? 6487525_6488665
⌊ let's do the regular kind first ⌋ . 6488665_6489425
alright . 6490025_6490285
no . 6490485_6490685
I will make myself clear . 6491645_6492605
let's do the kind that we let's do the kind over a vertical line first . 6493305_6499125
and then followed by inversion . 6501105_6502745
uhuh .
+, okay . 6503185_6504025
so it'll be inversion zero something composed with reflection +... 6504645_6509445
reflection across any vertical line we want ⌈ so let's do ⌉ . 6513945_6516365
⌊ composed with ⌋ negative z@l bar plus whatever . 6516385_6518625
let's do reflection across three . 6519245_6521485
but do you know how that how does &~whe what it's across affect the equation ? 6522585_6528565
I think it's going to . 6529225_6530925
like how does the negative one apply and relate ? 6531075_6534035
I don't know ⌈ how but one ⌉ . 6534535_6535415
⌊ just &~ig ⌋ just ignore &~whe what it's over that doesn't matter . 6535415_6538435
you know ? 6539975_6540135
just &~p .
well you have to know what it's across . 6540295_6541375
no you don't look get rid &~of this is the equation negative z@l bar minus two just take a negative z@l bar plus some number . 6541495_6547355
oh .
+, it doesn't matter what it's over +... 6547995_6549935
but we know that's that's reflection over some vertical line . 6550575_6555875
reflection across +... 6556015_6557055
reflection across let's do reflection across but a reflection across a vertical line not located on the z@l axis it's the same so if if it's reflection across the z@l axis then we have one over z@l bar right ? 6563425_6580965
yeah +/.
+, no .
then we have negative z@l bar ? 6582865_6583885
or one over z@l bar . 6584065_6585665
you know what's cool about what they have is they have like . 6586465_6588465
negative z@l bar . 6588685_6588985
yeah . 6589345_6589585
okay . 6590325_6590405
so if we wanna reflect across like three then it'll be like negative z@l bar plus three or negative z@l bar minus three . 6591665_6599925
okay all I'm saying is that's not what they did . 6600405_6601705
I don't think it is either . 6602485_6603345
but ⌈ I think we have to try to find the formula ⌉ . 6604165_6604525
⌊ all I'm saying is I know it's not what they did ⌋ . 6604525_6605865
just for just for now +/. 6606705_6610705
do it like that ? 6611385_6611905
+, &~ign ignore we can figure out later if we want to what it reflects over but now just do this because this is the only thing that matters when you're doing the formula is &-uh is this thing . 6612735_6625515
this &~w you could care less what that is . 6626115_6628295
+, alright so let's do +/. 6628635_6629035
+, (be)cause you don't even use that in the formula you use this . 6629035_6630635
three .
let's do negative z@l bar +/. 6630955_6632055
plus three ? 6632935_6633335
+, minus +/. 6633535_6633755
+, minus three +/. 6633955_6635155
+, minus three . 6635255_6635455
so let's do minus three . 6635455_6635955
(be)cause that they ended up with positive numbers so let's do that . 6636815_6639435
okay . 6642265_6642505
that's what we're doing . 6643165_6643665
yeah .
+, so now f@l of z@l is negative z@l bar minus three and now we invert over it with a radius of square root of two +... 6645325_6651865
okay so i@l zero square root of two . 6656025_6660805
negative z@l minus three .
so what does that equal ? 6663025_6665925
that equals two ? 6666725_6667685
right . 6669045_6669625
over . 6672005_6672285
minus oh wait . 6673685_6675625
over what are we doing on the bottom again ? 6676505_6679465
z@l bar so it'll be . 6679605_6680785
oh we take the bar of that . 6680865_6681945
yeah . 6682465_6682685
⌈ so we're just gonna ⌉ +/. 6683365_6683985
+, ⌊ so it'll be ⌋ negative z@l ⌈ minus three ⌉ +/. 6684165_6686365
+, ⌊ minus three ⌋ +/.
+, and now we have to that's all . 6687245_6690645
so see we're only getting one Z and we need two z@l-s . 6691385_6693865
two z@l-s . 6695745_6696345
oh so let's do the other one first . 6697565_6699425
+, okay . 6700755_6701015
+, I concede to you . 6701015_6701955
the inversion first ⌈ and then ⌉ ? 6702095_6703215
⌊ let's do ⌋ the inversion first . 6703215_6704035
okay . 6704515_6704655
+, so &~th yeah . 6704655_6705155
inversion over square root of two is gonna be two over z@l bar . 6705695_6711775
four . 6712795_6714855
no two over z@l bar . 6715435_6716475
use +//. 6716535_6716735
how about we do like okay so you wanna do square root of two ? 6717055_6722655
yeah . 6723095_6723395
I'm trying to get two z@l to come out . 6724555_6726975
that's what I'm working on . 6727255_6728055
(be)cause we have to get two z@l to come out and be on the bottom . 6728635_6731795
that's why I think you can't have it hafta be over the origin . 6734155_6737995
yeah she may have messed up when she said that (be)cause they didn't . 6738495_6740815
yeah and how else would they get something with two z@l-s in it and we didn't ? 6742175_6744895
well <they even> they even said . 6745435_6746695
maybe she meant the X . 6746695_6747715
lookit their inversion is centered at negative four zero . 6747775_6750295
yeah ⌈ let's ⌉ . 6750575_6751155
⌊ I think &~she ⌋ .
⌈ so let's ⌉ center it wherever we want . 6751275_6752295
do what we want . 6752435_6752655
I think she meant the x@l axis +... 6752655_6754635
like centered in on the x@l axis . 6757015_6758895
⌊ but because ⌋ .

yeah .
that's fine . 6762235_6762715
alright . 6763135_6763235
so +... 6764135_6764615
we have +... 6765215_6767755
do you wanna do it the same way they did ? 6770215_6771915
invert first ? 6772535_6773615
let's invert . 6775475_6776275

⌊ over ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ because ⌉ we we want Z on top of Z . 6776875_6778535

yeah so let's do inversion . 6782315_6785295
how about centered at ⌊ like negative two zero ⌋ . 6786735_6788935
⌈ that should work ⌉ .
that should work . 6789675_6790135
no I wanted negative three zero . 6790135_6791275

over .
&-um yeah . 6801515_6802455
okay +/. 6802795_6803015
+, let's try that and see if it works . 6803495_6804515
but see they got a five and that didn't give them two z@l . 6804835_6809235
well we're just playing around let's see what numbers we get and then you change the numbers that was the whole point . 6810445_6814305
⌊ so that's gonna give us ⌋ +... 6815965_6817065
⌈ k@l squared ⌉ +...
I think I've did we say square root of two ? 6817585_6826245
⌊ yes ⌋ . 6828165_6828485
+, ⌈ or did we say square root &~o ⌉ okay . 6828485_6829445
so that gives you two right ? 6832905_6835485
over +... 6836305_6837645
z@l bar plus three minus three . 6841115_6846635
yeah .
and now let's reflect over . 6850675_6853055
well &-uh shouldn't we let's see what that comes out to ⌊ you know what I'm saying ⌋ ? 6853755_6858615
⌈ you wanna simplify ⌉ it some more ? 6858615_6859455
well yeah we wanna we don't even we have a Z +/. 6860215_6864835
⌊ we can ⌋ .
+, ⌈ we have a ⌉ z@l bar on the bottom but we don't have anything on the top so let's find out what kind of +/. 6864835_6868835
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ . 6870035_6870235
+, ⌈ alright ⌉ ?
let's find out what we get on top . 6871195_6873395
so this is gonna equal minus three z@l bar plus nine ? 6874715_6881995
no . 6883155_6883635
⌊ plus eleven ⌋ ?
⌈ but if you do that like if you have like reflection composed with inversion ⌉ +/. 6883635_6885695
⌊ plus eleven ? 6885695_6885855
no no no . 6886335_6887435
(be)cause it's minus nine plus two so minus seven ⌋ ? 6887875_6890415
mhm .
a reflection composed with an inversion should give you like centered at zero zero is RZ minus k@l squared over Z . 6891485_6902965
but we need the opposite so don't we have to do like inversion and then the rotation I mean it didn't seem to work but +... 6904485_6915065
I think we're gonna be good off if we start with what we have but if we start with inversion . 6918455_6923075
like you have inversion composed with rotation or rotation . 6924115_6926935
rotation +//.
reflection composed with an inversion . 6928955_6930055
sorry . 6930415_6930915
but now see that gave us a negative three z@l bar . 6932115_6934595
and that's really not kind of what we wanted . 6935915_6937315
no it's not what we wanted . 6937535_6938235
but let's keep going . 6938235_6938995
followed by the reflection z@l bar minus z@l bar minus what point do you wanna put in there +..? 6941455_6946875
I don't know +...
so how are we gonna get a two z@l on the bottom ? 6952755_6961675
well . 6962935_6963395
this is looking is this gonna be maybe two inversions ? 6964895_6969035
I thought about that . 6970105_6970805
you know it's gonna hafta be because you got z@l bar and then you gotta get Z back . 6970865_6974105
right ?
yeah . 6975825_6976065
we wanna end up with z@l-s not z@l bars . 6976145_6977945
but they did . 6978245_6978605
they ended up with z@l-s . 6978825_6979745
yeah but &-um if you reflect it doesn't matter . 6980265_6983505
oh yeah (be)cause they did oh yeah (be)cause you &~s when you reflect you take the bar anyways . 6984045_6987785
⌈ mhm ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ . 6988025_6988185
so do we wanna reflect now and see what we get ? 6988685_6990905
if you reflect <it doesn't> it doesn't change the numbers in front of your z@l-s . 6995725_6999585
see what I'm saying ? 7000685_7001125
why not ?
+, so we either because all you do is you +/. 7002145_7006205
+, ⌈ yeah but ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ bar ⌋ it and then you subtract some number that doesn't have anything to do with Z you subtract a constant +/. 7007165_7012205
+, ⌈ alright so ⌉ +/. 7013085_7013965
+, ⌊ or you add a ⌋ constant so our either our inversion hasta get it right the first time . 7013985_7018425
so let's let our inversion be over negative two comma zero . 7019905_7023405
are you able to even get like Z over like a some kind of number ? 7024575_7030375
this is what I get something like this ⌈ I did ⌉ . 7030615_7034755
⌊ so it ⌋ doesn't matter what real number we put in there . 7034835_7036615
I think it doesn't matter so let's do . 7038115_7039755
how does it ? 7040995_7041475
well it will it's gonna change what your it's gonna change what your constant is up on top but . 7041955_7046995
but if it doesn't &~cha it doesn't matter what the constant is +/. 7047435_7050835
yeah +/.
+, then when we do the reflection over a vertical line we can do it over any vertical line we want . 7051375_7055795
so no matter what we have going in there we can fix it . 7057075_7059875
+, alright +/.
+, so let's do inversion over two . 7061135_7065035
how do you change what you get in front of the Z on the bottom +..? 7067435_7070695
let's invert twice +... 7073255_7077715
because we want to flip it over . 7080025_7081705
so we wanna get what we have and then ⌈ flip it over again ⌉ . 7082105_7083705
⌊ I think we wanna ⌋ invert twice . 7083705_7084885
I agree . 7085005_7085245
okay . 7085685_7085965
let's try it . 7086205_7086705
so let's invert over negative two zero first . 7087805_7089785
and then let's invert over the origin . 7090565_7093325
that's what I think so what radius do you want ? 7095405_7097605
invert over what first ? 7098525_7099905
invert over +/. 7100205_7101025
⌈ some ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ negative two ⌋ comma zero . 7102625_7103985
let's do what they did . 7104445_7105325
let's do the square root of five . 7106245_7107065
(be)cause like what &~if what if you get what they do and then you like invert it over the origin or something . 7108135_7114415
yeah I think we wanna do the origin next . 7115375_7118515
don't we wanna use one of the numbers +/. 7119435_7120375
⌈ (be)cause <what if> what if you ⌉ +/. 7120595_7121535
+, ⌊ that they're talking about ⌋ but they got a five who knows where they got their five &=gasp five is three plus two . 7122255_7126575
questionable . 7127595_7128655
but why don't we just &=sound_effect it's just about the same . 7129655_7133675
so let's invert over one . 7134615_7137375
radius one .
I'm just going to use general k@l-s a@l-s and all this other jazz . 7139345_7143765
okay .
⌈ I'm using inversion ⌉ . 7143785_7144485
⌊ alright so you're gonna use negative two zero ⌋ ? 7144485_7145825
and radius one . 7146045_7146685
⌈ alright ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that's what I'm ⌋ using .
and that'll equal one over +... 7148705_7151465
z@l bar plus two minus two . 7157145_7160425
(0.15) .
so minus two z@l bar minus three ? 7176045_7177625
over z@l bar plus two ? 7178765_7180245
you are a_lot faster than me +... 7180725_7182205
yeah .
oh . 7187705_7188045
yeah . 7188485_7190105
so then +... 7191405_7192125
we really wanted a plus three . 7195145_7197205
⌈ but but it might &~fix ⌉ . 7197565_7200365
⌊ no .
no we got ⌋ a negative two z@l bar minus three right ? 7200365_7202905
mhm +/.
+, that's negative two z@l bar plus three . 7204045_7206885
okay .
so let's keep it that way over z@l bar plus two and now let's invert again +/. 7207765_7212245
okay . 7212825_7212845
+, and this time we want it over the origin +... 7214425_7216225
and now +/. 7216885_7219265
+, we &~shou +/.
+, we need to choose a radius . 7219445_7220345
I think we should keep radius one or something . 7220865_7222885
keep radius one again ? 7223585_7224485
I don't know .
(0.7) or whatever I &~don't pick whatever you want . 7235325_7236685
well let's keep radius one . 7237705_7238625
so this'll be +... 7241025_7241625
so you got a one on top +/. 7243285_7246505
yeah .
+, and then on the bottom you get the bar of what's already there . 7249545_7252185
so that's negative two z@l minus three all over Z plus two . 7253185_7258925
so Z plus two goes on top . 7259785_7261445
and there's a plus two after that ? 7262325_7263885
no there's not ? 7265305_7265905
that's all . 7266245_7266645
(0.15) .
so that gives you negative two z@l bar minus three ? 7271265_7283765
yeah +... 7284225_7284845
I don't like that . 7286045_7288705
I can do it with three reflections I think . 7288945_7290525
yeah . 7292285_7292305
so that's Z plus two over negative ⌈ &~two z@l plus three ⌉ . 7293905_7301745
⌊ because ⌋ we're really close . 7301765_7302885
yeah we are close . 7303025_7303765
it's two reflections . 7304225_7305245
I mean if we did one more reflection then we would get it . 7305805_7307845
because we would do a reflection over a vertical line . 7307925_7309905
yeah .
+, and then that would make &-uh no it wouldn't . 7312185_7317925
that wouldn't work either . 7318145_7318645
no you you wanna you gotta stick with two because you gotta get the z@l-s back . 7318945_7322605
you gotta get z@l bars and you gotta get z@l-s . 7322925_7325185
we're close maybe we just gotta change something just a little . 7325965_7328885
alright so instead of doing this second inversion . 7329805_7331445
so what the thing we need to change is the center of the &~in circle of inversion . 7331665_7337485
right ? 7338545_7339905
⌈ so we got a two z@l plus three ⌉ . 7341605_7343385
⌊ but that's gonna multiply ⌋ that's gonna multiply the first Z . 7343565_7344905
let's try doing it over a vertical line now . 7345545_7349685
stay where we were with the first one (be)cause I think that's cool . 7350505_7352445
and then change do the second one like this . 7353445_7355985
okay . 7356885_7357105
+, I don't think it's gonna work do you ? 7357865_7359165
you don't do you ? 7359325_7359905
I don't know I don't think +//. 7360505_7361385
I I stopped thinking that guess and check's gonna work . 7362425_7364565
I thought I'd &~be I thought we'd be able to see pretty clearly what the numbers were how they were being affected ⌈ but ⌉ +/. 7366145_7371025

(0.8) we could work on four and I don't know . 7373705_7382505
so which ones have we left so far we've left . 7383125_7384945
one b@l . 7385565_7385945
one b@l . 7387125_7388585

yeah . 7394145_7394305

this was easy wasn't it ? 7665965_7667625
okay . 7668565_7670745
I'm still kinda glad we didn't start with this one . 7671845_7673745

hey . 7676005_7676405
&=laughs:multiple thanks a_lot yeah I like you too . 7676805_7679345
what is a double fixed point ? 7679545_7680765
⌈ it's ⌉ .
⌊ okay ⌋ fix both of (th)em . 7682325_7684165
two distinct real roots . 7684245_7685505

yeah . 7700765_7701165
it's a parabolic . 7701505_7702085
translations don't fix anything do they ? 7702785_7704845
no . 7704985_7705285
it's on the boundary . 7705465_7706045
negative three's on the boundary . 7706365_7707405
I thought I don't . 7708925_7712825
