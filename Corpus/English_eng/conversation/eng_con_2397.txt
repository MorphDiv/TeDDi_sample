There are several things that I would like for us to be doing this
I want first to sketch let me call it an “agenda of sorts” for the
When I say an agenda of sorts, I mean just that . 432000_434900
I know I have a way to begin . 435096_436856
What will come after will depend on what the beginning begins to
So though I will sketch an agenda, it's in no way a strong promise .
Though if it makes you angry if we depart from what we promised we
The thing that keeps it afloat is that we're underway, and that's
Nonetheless there's a point to this agenda of sorts and I would
What you'll find about our studies is that they themselves are
So there's that agenda, then following the agenda, the agenda of
Then, by way of concluding the meeting, I want to assign some
Now that requirement fits in with an emphasis in the what we'll
The possibility of you getting access to that work, as news, turns
Now, there's an alternative way in which ordinary activities and
And in that alternative, there's a very large literature that I'll
I mean to call your attention at the outset, by way of contrast,
In the seminar, we're going to pay great attention to that first
I'm going to demean the second way of working . 814463_823640
And so I might as well get to it . 823640_828378
To begin with, let me then sketch the agenda of topics for our
I want to propose to you that there exists two bibliographies of
no, two bibliographies: one, a bibliography of studies as the work
The first bibliography I think of under the name studies of
Our concerns in the seminar are going to be with studies that
The bibliography has the character of a corpus of studies . 910768_914211
Its motives, its interests are research-relevant interests . 914211_919979
The studies are going to be of interest to us in this way; namely,
So, the problem with the corpus, the problem with those studies,
The work of the seminar is in fact then concerned with what I call
Now there's a second bibliography . 1014887_1021404
The second bibliography consists of studies about ethnomethodology .
I want only briefly to characterize that literature . 1025776_1049748
Later, we'll take it up with the seriousness that it deserves,
And we'll take it up then as a phenomenon and in that way, let's
For today I want only to sketch some things that (..) I want to
I'm going to propose the following things about it . 1090878_1097794
If the relevant phenomenon that we're dealing with in the case of
the name for it might be a “service literature” . 1116800_1118674
By a service literature I'm talking about the fact that there now
Not teaching any which thing, but teaching among other things
Now, by a service literature we're talking here about the work of
Husserl, Husserl was an originator . 1238801_1243190
These guys read Husserl, how come Husserl's not anywhere around in
someone can take that on . 1247246_1249059
The Chicago school, after all, was doing ethnographic studies of
George Herbert Mead we know was a hero whereever interaction is
Then there's the business of the advent of phenomenology for
Now, then, you can have persons students, faculty, who,
Having formulated the mystery providing what a solution to the
And that, then, can be a very prominent way in which a literature
It's done, I think, organizationally speaking, under circumstances
It has to do it with the prevalence of buddies, of sponsorship
Now I'm not in any way demeaning the practical circumstances under
In no way do I take that lightly . 1452559_1455816
And I guess I don't have to tell you that I could hardly take it
At the same time, to make the service literature Oh, by the
The result is that you get generational stresses, call it a local
And therefore, you can become a casualty quickly if you're not too
Now given all those circumstances, and in no way intending to
What it will get you access to is endless comprehensive versions of
However, in that there's no way of interrogating those writings to
I take it, for the very short time we have here together for the
And in the course of that then, we'll treat this about literature,
I'll put it right on the line, so we understand each other . 1746028_1755620
I think it's garbage . 1755620_1756952
I think that it's a phenomenon, it's to be addressed with any
But then that's wherein its absurdity would be demonstrable . 1763102_1776269
The absurdity would reside in this: that it would be clear and
Now, we have our hands full getting access to that, as the promise
And the about literature gets you no access to that work . 1842749_1861220
Later in the course, when we've had a chance to get to the point
Because right now they could come on as, I suppose, an xxx brag or
I can't promise that it will get reasonable because I can't talk
Now, what I'm proposing can become available as a phenomenon in its
Okay, then . 1949163_1953551
In a word, there are these other studies, two bibliographies:
Students teaching each other, students and faculty, graduates
Now let me give you an in-contrast-to . 2002377_2011969
If we're going to be concerned with the corpus, then I would now
As a way of getting stuff going, it's possible to allude to, it's
Now, the phenomena that I'm going to speak of as being phenomena
If you frequent conversational activities, and if you think of the
Now there is in addition now, an object, that the completeness of
If you think of another object, which is a map that persons draw
If you think as well for traffic, that there can occur in traffic
Now I've given you a list of things . 2270264_2273599
I'm going to collect them with the notion of, or I'm going to call
Now the maxim . 2278541_2281800
The maxim is, look: The fundamental phenomena of ethnomethodology's
Will you repeat that ? 2321467_2326503
Yes, the epitome, the maxim +... 2326503_2331142
by a maxim I mean, look, I'm offering you both a truth and a rule
That's the thing about the maxim .
Here's the maxim: To say of these objects that an organizational
It provides in situ +... 2364474_2368679
never mind it provides, the objects consist in situ of their own
Now the many people that are angry without possibility of repair or
Nevertheless, I'm offering you a summary to start with . 2397123_2404289
In the end, if we're doing studies together, then it will become
If you want to turn it into a debate, we'll get nowhere . 2412336_2416308
But that's a leading maxim . 2416308_2421140
There are other maxims, but that's a pretty sweeping one . 2421140_2431669
The problem obviously is to specify it with respect to the objects
I can give you a fair warning to start with don't try conjuring
You're not looking for more words, you're looking for the grounds,
Since you don't want to examine the talk for the issues, you want
You need to be talking to each other, but we can't, as Dave Sudnow
That would be an alternative . 2485798_2487909
And instead now, we're not going to be doing it that way . 2487909_2492648
We want instead now to look for those worldly objects to find for
Well, it's not even worldly work as it's commonly thought of or so
We're looking for those most ordinary things in the world;
We're looking for those practical circumstances, those courses of
Now, the collection of studies, studies of naturally-organized
The tasks of ethnomethodologists' inquiries are, via actual
Now, I'm speaking specifically of acquiring technically-specific
I didn't say empirical materials, but now that you understand that
You can't do it except with worldly stuff . 2726453_2731008
You can do it without worldly stuff by in fact constructing the
And we all know that those arts are done, any weekend will provide
No, we're not looking for the authoritative version of what
And, according to where we find ourselves in the program of our
And in other places we'll be with documented conjectures, with
Some times from readings, some times from someone's personal
In other places or for other issues by issues I'm going to
And when the work is as strong as it can get, or has thus far
The most recent stuff by Sacks and Schegloff and Jefferson on the
It's not the only case of what I'll call strong stuff, but it's
There's another possibility and that is that Dave Sudnow's work, in
That's because it promises to get very quickly to the character of
I think it's fair to speak of your work as a work in the
Would that be a fair way to summarize it ? 2960390_2962469
I mean if we needed a slogan +... 2962469_2964098
xxx . 2964098_2965900
Okay, we don't want that slogan . 2965900_2967524
Okay, let it go . 2967524_2970300
In any case, what I'm pointing to is, that with respect to this
Experiential stuff ? 3025311_3026608
You can call them that . 3026608_3027737
The world of ordinary things, things like playing the piano or
Now let me tell you about those interests . 3073422_3077480
They have a characteristic career in the work of
That is, their findings develop in their strength and they can be
That's a rough scheme . 3107801_3110310
It's only of use to you +... 3110310_3113100
You could try examining what could be meant by reasoned conjecture
I'll be going through materials with which to show how, for work,
So there's this matter that the studies can be arranged and that
And in fact that the findings do have, as I say, a characteristic
Now, that progression is the heart of the stuff that we're going to
Their claimed discovery is the discovery of naturally-organized
Until that corpus was in hand, the phenomena that the
And it was that corpus that made them available and provided as
And provided as well along with it the possibility of the
Now, ethnomethodology is concerned for the detection,
Now the practice of our seminar, now that I've gone through that
Via our studies, I want now to identify and elucidate issues,
And I take it that our work together is directed to that proposal
Both those bibliographies could claim our interest, only the first
The second, because it doesn't bear on that first task , I mean,
So we'll be using then the studies of naturally-organized
Our seminar's work as I think of it for the next four or five weeks
I'll entertain some questions . 3387956_3403077
Until I dislike the questions we will then go on to the next topic .
Yeah ? 3407722_3408751
Is there such a thing as unnaturally-organized activities ? 3408751_3412187
xxx yes, lots of them . 3412187_3416200
Unnaturally organized ? 3416200_3417446
Yes, what are some examples ? 3417446_3419325
There are activities provided for under immensely many constructed
you can speak of the conversations of families under the auspices
You can speak of the deliberations of jurors, whereby they come to
You can speak of traffic flow and provide, together with the in
I'm talking about constructions that all of you are up to here
An ordinary family conversation provided for as an orderliness-of .
xxx . 3540500_3558065
So we have then the work of conversation provided for as an
So, let me give you a little puzzle now . 3585370_3590000
I'm gonna use these square brackets to provide for an

Now let's say, xxx , it will now be found to consist of a methodic
xxx the provision for the rendition of this object according to an
The textbooks are simply loaded to overflowing with these devices .
They're natural language-dependent devices . 3685499_3690886
And their properties as the orderliness of the whatever can be
They have one very gorgeous property . 3709400_3713490
They'll do any goddamn project you want to make them do . 3713490_3717350
They just do . 3717350_3720776
That is to say, it's a no-lose enterprise . 3720776_3725913
the motives of natural theorizing is that it never loses the
Now, how you can have social studies employing that kind of artful
what about the proposition that the reason those structures can be
That happens, I hear you recommending a policy . 3809500_3819025
It's a policy that in ethnomethodological studies are regarded with
Sacks has a way of speaking to that he says, look, there are
The way in which that policy would recommend itself would be that
That then would be taken seriously . 3881932_3885524
But to provide for it as a doctrine, the authority for which, let's
Under those circumstances they're not interesting . 3934033_3937607
would you consider interaction process analysis as a kind of order
Because there is a couple like supposedly that, that order was
first of all it's not even so .
well it may not be so, but that's what xxx that's what they say .
Who says ?
Well, that's what Bales says and that's the story behind xxx . 3937607_3986500
That's what Bales would say but Freddy Strodtbeck knows it better
Do you know all their twelve categories ? 3990922_3995727
Come on, give me a guess . 3995727_4000365
You don't know, obviously I know the end of the story, you don't,
So come on, guess . 4012550_4013930
Look, right after World_War_Two, Freddy Strodtbeck went to Harvard .
He had a degree in, as undergraduate in math and had done some
He was court administrator for the court of Los Angeles during
And in the course of that he became really competent in the use
They were then known as Harvard machines . 4055291_4058217
computers, but in those days they had Harvard machines . 4058217_4065467
The xxx machine was something a guy named Hollerith had invented
And Freddy Strodtbeck was really competent with the Harvard
Now tell me, what was it that's characteristic of a Hollerith card ?
Twelve, right ? 4084335_4088159
So Freddy gets to Harvard I happen to know this, I'm a witness
And Freddy says, Oh that's bullshit, you'll never get anywhere with
Here, let me show you what to do . 4100809_4109420
And he starts then combining them, and he says what we'll need to
Now what were you saying about the discovered structure ? 4120327_4125763
We're talking here about the most practical work in the world, that

In principle we'll come to those as we need to xxx . 4241110_4287000
Let's say, if I'm trying to engage in putting together a manual,
There's the notion of interactional structure provided for . 4324990_4329844
Well, that then is to be elucidated by re-examining the
The structures are the structures in their practices . 4339835_4345687

He'll provide you with the awesome thing that typing consists of
