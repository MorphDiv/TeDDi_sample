the story about a reunion of several friends in their youth .
and one was standing waiting for the reunion .
waiting for his friend to show up .
and from what I could gather that he was a wanted man .
one was a policeman .
his friend was a policeman .
and from what I gather he didn't have the compassion to arrest him .
she had had to get another officer to arrest him for him .
what come to mind was when we was kids .
they had this saying .
the dead can't hurt you .
I guess I was about thirteen or fourteen .
and two of my buddies Mike and Willie .
and it was like a dare situation .
in our neighborhood we had a mortuary .
what you call a funeral home .
so we come up with this idea that to break into the funeral home .
and we broke into the funeral home .
and once we was in the funeral home there was several bodies waiting
and it was dark .
an October night .
a Fall night .
and I think Willie hit one of the bodies in the stomach .
and the body sit up and said +"/.
+" boo .
he hit him in his stomach .
and the air from the stomach had him sit straight up .
and he said +"/.
+" boo .
and we broke out_of there like a bat out_of hell .
and running so hard we were running through yards .
and only the last thing I remember was getting yoked by a
