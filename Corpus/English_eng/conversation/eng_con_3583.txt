one night they got a frog .
they went to sleep .
and the frog gets out .
next morning they awake .
and they find out it's gone .
they look everywhere in the house .
they look out everywhere .
the dog falls down and breaks the glass .
and the dog gets the boy .
but he doesn't like him .
then they go out close to the forest and yell .
then they look .
and I think that's a skunk pops out .
and the dog is trying to get up there .
then the hive falls down .
the and the boy looks in the tree .
then bees come flying after the dog .
and then owl comes when he is trying to climb up the rock .
and he gets on a deer's antlers .
the deer's head pops up .
he starts running .
and he stops at the cliff .
and the boy falls down into the pond .
and he goes kerplunk .
then he heard them and told the dog to be quiet .
and they looked over .
<and> and the frog looked up .
and then they saw the &-um little babies .
then they were signaling to come .
oh and they were signaling goodbye and taking the frog home .
and then you get a blank page .
and then you get the end of the book
