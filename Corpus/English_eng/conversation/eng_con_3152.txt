some blue here . 5190_6440
okay . 9430_9530
<is that> is that is there blind on the back of . 10900_14030
that . 14080_14210
no there isn't . 14500_15260
we're gonna talk about that in a minute that would make . 15280_17180
your job easier . 17200_17600
wouldn't it . 18010_18250
okay . 18680_18780
Kevin does that . 18890_19610
look like a fair representation of what you planned on your paper .
yeah . 22950_23040
okay . 23510_23780
so what Kevin would do that would be his core square . 24460_27100
once he has that colored in then he could even put his shakes away
but that first time getting it down real carefully before someone
that's important . 39680_40340
but now we'll all be able to remember what Kevin's &-um what
then cut it out . 46670_48670
mhm . 48820_49130
I cannot wish that much . 49400_50380
so you have space for I'm sorry . 50460_52340
you have space for how many coursewares on the grid . 52720_55030
I gave you <four four> four right . 55160_57010
okay . 57430_57570
but we're gonna it helps to make them one at a time . 57780_60790
because when you otherwise you start thinking that part of what you
so I'm cutting this out . 68060_69530
and then yeah the back doesn't have anything on it for a minute I
this is how Kevin planned his to go . 77210_79700
this is what was up and down for him . 80190_82580
so what I need to do is in the upper left hand corner . 82950_85620
I need to mark that with an x and I'm gonna make you a little
why do you think I'm marking that part with an x . 94150_96140
that side line . 98790_99590
so it's up that's yeah . 100140_101900
I need to know that has to be the upper left . 102040_104580
so I'm I'm gonna hold it 'cause then if someone says turn it a
well what_if one time I put it here and turned it a quarter turned
but what_if next time I started with it like this and turned it a
does it look the same . 117150_117860
yes no no it it doesn't but the x is well you have to look
right . 125010_125260
I you're right when the x is there I have to start with that here .
and a quarter turned to the left would look like that . 128360_130160
but if what_if the x wasn't there . 131090_132340
and what_if I just put it on my desk . 132380_133740
and oh yeah that looks about right . 133760_135110
and turn it a quarter turn to the left . 135710_137390
oh that doesn't give the same result . 137930_139660
does it . 139680_140020
'cause this yellow one's down here . 140310_141420
so Kevin always needs to know what the starting position for his
you get to pick what it is . 147910_148790
it's whatever you think . 148840_149860
but then each one you draw you have to put the x in the same spot
okay that if I'm gonna copy it that x is gonna be right there each
okay . 160570_160660
so but am I I only mark an x on one side because this is the
yeah . 168350_168530
when I flip it over that's what you'll see . 168730_170380
and that's not how my coursework started . 170570_172420
right the colors gone . 172940_173780
that's one reason I used marker . 174230_175900
you don't have to use marker today . 176180_177750
but one reason I . 177820_178790
did . 178840_179540
yep . 180300_180470
you can . 180620_181100
one reason I did use marker . 181540_183180
so you can see . 183580_184390
I don't have a ruler on my &-um my table right now . 186600_189700
so I'm gonna show you how I would do this . 189820_191060
using just this pa piece of paper as a straight edge . 191170_193260
I need to look very carefully and those lines that divided the core
I wanna make that window design on on the back tube . 199920_204820
so I'm gonna use my ruler or a straight edge . 205010_207590
and before I color anything in I am going to draw those on there .
'cause that'll help me plan . 213580_214350
okay . 214870_214970
so now it looks more like the core square that you're used to
'cause if you're sitting at your seat later going I don't know how
and you'd have to do that at your recess time . 231090_233180
not during my class time because at lunchtime today we should have
okay . 238820_239060
now it's real easy for me now to see what what colors they
because marker I color dark enough dark Cran will work the same way
but I do still . 248130_248770
<can we> can we still use marker though . 248890_250120
sure . 250340_250460
but some of us don't have markers here but . 251870_253420
not colored pencils . 253570_254610
because you can know out what the line . 254760_257180
you can use color . 257839_258399
you can use colored pencils . 259180_260029
you just have to check . 260370_261170
yeah . 261560_261660
okay . 262200_262340
I'm gonna do the two yellow parts first 'cause I can see right
we do the . 269900_270130
well . 270930_271050
just so we can't . 271760_272560
yeah . 273220_273440
so you get an idea of how to do it . 273510_275010
you're gonna be doing your own core squares . 275030_277050
yeah . 280120_280210
but the ones I made to actually use to do my . 280730_283450
project . 283980_284220
yeah . 285710_285900
yeah . 286690_286770
I'm just trying to show you how to do it . 288330_289420
now I'm gonna check very carefully before I put any green on here
okay . 292860_293130
the I have three triangles worth of green . 293210_295370
and I'm gonna put a dot on them . 295840_297930
and check before I color (th)em in . 298050_299690
I'm kind of checking to see . 300130_302330
okay . 302350_302450
those are the three spaces now that I need to make green . 302630_305170
so once I've really planned and checked carefully then I can just
but I wouldn't wanna start color a whole triangle in . 311940_314290
especially if I was using marker . 314310_315660
and then find out that I had colored the wrong space in 'cause what
then start . 320470_321620
yep . 322510_322610
and you . 322850_323100
and you only have . 323690_324500
well I have extra of those grids . 325220_328890
but time-wise I don't want you to have to start over 'cause you
no . 334330_334450
I have extra grids then . 334510_335860
you know the rest of (th)em are blue . 335910_337380
how do I know . 337570_338100
that's only color left . 341000_341890
yep . 342210_342300
only use three colors . 342830_343660
so . 343810_343950
yep . 344030_344120
these . 344190_344390
we have to only use three colors . 345450_346380
two or three . 346730_347290
that's all three . 348370_349380
yeah . 349690_349860
for this project other fields we use more more_or_less . 350240_353170
okay . 354900_355140
but for today . 355210_355970
I use the door colors . 357160_358310
&-um . 359140_359300
well I can take one color off . 359750_361200
right . 361770_361900
but more on another color . 362170_363620
I can't use . 365640_365940
you can just substitute you wanted to know . 366380_369910
color sloppy there loppy . 370550_373190
so here's the friend side . 374140_376070
this is what my course square originally looks like . 376250_378220
and I can tell that 'cause there's the x and I can hold that in the
so I know that's up . 382250_383140
so now if I wanna see an up down flip . 383220_385140
that's what it would look like . 386790_387560
an up down flip . 387600_388140
if I wanna see a sideways flip . 388800_390530
then that's . 392410_392810
what it looks like like . 392860_393360
looks like narrow . 393380_393850
if I wanna turn it to the right one quarter I start put the
okay . 402520_402640
do you think Kevin's gonna be able to create five or six different
yeah . 407010_407140
does he need just one of these . 408720_409560
no . 410280_410350
he needs like four four three more . 411440_413850
now the part that's going to tricky when you get to use the rest of
make sure you find that place . 418260_419840
you marked on the first one . 420020_421120
and make the next one look just like it . 421530_424040
and then cut it out and do the flip side . 424310_425970
okay . 426870_426970
&-um I know some of you're like . 427680_428760
well why can't I just pull to the front of all four . 428780_430680
and then flip it over and do the back of all four . 430760_432960
there's nothing wrong with that . 434280_435330
thinking I just found in the past years a_lot_of my kids ended up
and then they tried to flip (th)em over and do the backside of all
they had to keep starting over . 444850_446080
and they had done all the fronts already . 446240_447840
and then they messed up back here and had to do start over . 447880_450760
and that was just a waste of of their time . 451400_453690
they time . 453740_454330
so it really I think it helps that once you get the front on you
maybe because then . 460590_461600
you're not looking hard at one and hard another . 461620_463410
maybe &-um 'cause maybe you might have like got kind a different
and then like cut out different like be cut off . 472600_478520
and then I have to like start all over . 478660_480460
yeah . 481290_481530
so this will take some thinking and planning . 482140_483790
it's not the easiest thing . 483890_485200
done . 485730_485870
right . 486430_486570
but without these could you plan on whole quilt . 487160_489650
family . 489700_490100
no . 490320_490480
no . 490640_490810
you'll really need the four things . 490960_492230
like this . 492420_492770
it'd be cool . 492890_493430
we could cut the shapes that would get more of the shapes to for
for making these . 501510_501970
yeah . 502650_502750
oh I mean not if we just glue shapes on these . 503320_505250
good . 506210_506400
yeah . 507660_507760
it was a lot greener in these . 507780_508890
wasn't . 509010_509240
I &-um we are gonna be using paper shapes . 509260_512080
Sarah and cutting them for these . 512100_513720
not the shapes out_of our zip bag . 513840_515150
'cause those we're gonna keep using through unit . 515919_517200
but <I have> I have bags full of squares in red and yellow and
I only have squares though . 524140_525530
how are you gonna make it look bottom . 525920_527130
have the squares in the triangle the color that you need . 527770_530080
like you did a color squares that you need to cut in your . 530380_532570
triangle . 532780_532900
that's what . 532920_533400
so sometimes I use squares 'cause 'cause there were parts . 533520_535700
I did use a yellow square in my core square . 535880_537700
that's why the other ones I had to take a square . 537720_540060
do I have a line up here . 541150_541990
yes I do . 542030_542600
because my my core square my original one . 543400_546150
and Kevin's doesn't either . 546380_547550
Kevin's design doesn't use any green squares . 548080_549840
but he did use green . 549890_551040
he used green triangles . 551190_552710
but it's time for him to glue a two by two design on paper . 553140_555920
he'll have to begin with a green square . 556540_558630
and then let's see . 558750_559390
how should I cut it like this kitty house . 559490_563120
mhm . 563310_563670
a what kitty corner catty . 564870_566880
