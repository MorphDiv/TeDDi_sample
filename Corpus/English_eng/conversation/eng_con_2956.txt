turn and talk to someone next to you . 20085_21285
I saw scat . 36485_37325
if you can hear me say yo . 37325_39125
yo .
say hey yo . 39785_40685
hey yo .
I saw the xxx and the exit and entry points . 41705_45665
the egg chamber ? 45805_46845
if you can hear me say yo . 46845_47805
yo . 48165_48845
say hey yo . 48925_49325
hey yo .
what did you guys find a lot of ? 50525_52445
field scat .
yeah just say it out . 53185_54765
I found multiple mating chambers . 55005_56705
Jesus . 57125_57225
are you okay ? 57625_58105
yeah, I'm fine . 58285_58825
a lot of evidence of growth . 59505_62805
what else did you guys find a lot of ? 62875_64435
I found a lot of evidence of the beetle growth . 64435_72295
and +...
okay .
thanks .
I'll get your thoughts in a second . 73075_76755
but new question . 77095_78015
what do you guys think ? 78515_79155
do you guys think these beetles can go under the bark of trees that are living or trees that are already dead ? 79235_85375
turn and talk to someone . 85575_86255
evidence of trees that are probably living because +...
I don't know +...
sometimes I think dead beetles, sometimes I think dead just because +... 93685_105805
thanks for enthusiastically talking about your ideas . 108465_113525
what do you guys think ? 113885_114445
living or dead ? 114585_115165
what and why ? 115405_115965
living . 116225_117625
okay . 118225_118505
I'm hearing some living over here . 118645_119845
anyone have +... 119985_120845
both . 121595_122215
both okay . 122215_122495
why do you think both ? 122975_124015
why do you think ? 124195_124775
who can say why ? 124935_125775
S_nine ?
because the dead trees, they're rotting away so they're easier to eat and you can eat them faster . 126275_134655
and the living trees, there's more stuff to eat because they keep growing and growing . 134815_139855
okay . 140175_140275
so I'm seeing some agreement there . 140435_141595
anyone had a disagreement or a different idea . 141735_143895
yeah . 144455_145515
I have a bit of both but I think it might be living because trees need water to live . 145205_151385
so there would be a water supplies . 151565_152945
so they would be able to drink and eat in the same place . 153745_156325
okay .
cool . 157205_157265
nice .
so again, I've read a lot of books on bark beetles . 158445_161745
I like to spend a day in the library . 161925_163525
this is revealing how much of a nerd I am that I spent a day in a library, reading a book, this thick on bark beetles, trying to find out as much as I could about them, because I think they're really interesting . 163785_171665
what I know about bark beetles is that they often go into trees and eat, live in trees and they often go in and eat the wood of trees that are either sick or on their way out, that are dying . 172515_188875
so how do you guys think that bark beetle presence, carving all those tunnels . 190055_194495
how does that affects the trees that they're doing that to ? 195035_197635
how could that affects the trees ? 197995_199195
I want to give you a couple of seconds to think before I see hands . 199285_201805
okay .
hold on . 202905_203145
let's just think for a second . 203345_204485
all right .
let's see some hands . 204885_208145
what do you guys think ? 208245_208845
how could they affects the trees ? 209225_210525
I think they make it weaker because the wood xxx . 211025_213245
think they make it a little weaker . 213825_216265
okay . 216825_217125
thumbs up if you agree with S_one's idea that it makes it weaker . 217245_219745
any others ideas, how might it affect things ? 220385_223125
yeah, S_five . 224425_225345
it probably makes the tree worse than it already is more sick if it's sick . 225545_231705
okay . 232085_232185
more sick +... 232585_233045
because it's taking +... 233765_236145
or less sick because it's taking away kind of the tree where it's sick kind of . 236145_243105
okay . 243265_243485
so maybe it could be making it less sick or more sick . 243685_245825
S_six .
did you have a different idea ? 245965_247245
oh, I was going to say like S_five . 247405_248745
you were going to say sort of the same thing . 248865_250345
S_nine .
I have a question . 250545_251385
yeah . 251645_251785
why do they go on the trees that are sick or dying ? 252085_254485
that's a really good question . 254965_255925
what do you guys think ? 256365_257005
why do you think bark beetles would go in the trees that are sick or dying ? 257165_260025
talk to someone next to you . 260285_261185
oh, maybe because there wouldn't be predators in a sick or dying tree . 261285_265945
because there's other animals in trees . 266745_269185
yeah . 269505_269745
so maybe there wouldn't be predators . 270145_271425
yeah because there's other animals .
they need the food so if so they have to go to something to get their food so it doesn't matter if it's sick or dying to them . 274705_281805
or it could be easier .
easier to eat away at .
they need their food . 282325_286825
they can't not go to .
meow-meow-meow-meow-meow .
meow-meow .
new question to tack onto that one . 287925_291565
talk to someone next to you . 291685_292585
what could a tree do to defend itself against a beetle that's crawling inside of it and trying to eat it ? 292725_296765
what do you guys think ? 296845_297365
go for it . 297405_297805
the tree would probably regrow bark . 298225_300705
so it couldn't get out, but a sick and dying tree wouldn't be able to do that . 300845_304665
yeah . 305725_305785
that's true . 306245_306805
yeah . 307045_307205
that is true . 307365_307745
the sick and dying tree wouldn't be able to defend itself so much . 307825_310865
okay .
bamboo trees would be hard to get through .
xxx .
like not see this tree, like manzanitas and the other one . 311705_326385
bamboo trees would be hard to get through . 326385_327905
it seems like S_six has had something to say for a little while . 329915_332175
go ahead . 332315_332595
I think it could defend itself by releasing sap to trap the beetles . 333655_338655
okay . 338875_339095
sap to stop the beetles . 339675_340875
what do you guys think ? 341435_341935
I'm seeing some nods there . 341975_343055
yeah . 343595_343695
okay . 343915_344075
what about the question we discussed before ? 344355_346495
why do you think they go for sick or dying trees ? 346635_348435
what do you guys think ? 348595_349155
yeah . 350975_351815
because there aren't predators in those types of trees . 352135_354775
okay . 355115_355375
so maybe it's easier to live in those ones . 355845_358105
yeah .
okay . 359285_359305
I'm hearing some agreement there . 359445_360385
that's what the people next to you were saying too, that maybe it's easier to eat the wood that's in sick or dying trees . 360725_365305
I was going to say it's easier to eat the wood xxx sick or dying trees . 366105_369325
it's easier to eat the wood . 369325_370145
so this is kind of like a big picture question . 370505_373225
it's going to call into play not only in our ideas as scientists, but also just kind of our opinions and it's going to be okay to disagree . 373625_381525
do you guys think that bark beetles are bad for a forest ? 382345_385085
why or why not ? 385265_386025
turn to someone and talk . 386245_387025
I would say they're actually good and that's probably because if they were already sick or dying trees they could eat it like termites, really quickly . 387705_402065
and so it wouldn't fall and hurt the forest by like crushing animals . 402265_406265
yeah I think that it's not harmful at all . 406865_410505
I don't think its harmful . 410585_411485
yeah .
I don't think it's harmful . 410755_411295
I have a question .
can I touch that at the end ? 411295_412375
it looks so fluffy . 412735_414575
no .
don't look at it . 414755_415575
what do you think ? 415735_417995
I don't know .
seems like all they do is make tunnels and reproduce kind of like mosquitoes except mosquitoes only reproduce . 418415_425135
but just reproduce or just here . 425135_428755
yeah they're just here . 429215_430355
well, what do you think +... 430615_431615
can I touch that at the end ? 432595_434415
it looks so fluffy . 434875_436575
no .
don't look at it . 436795_437615
don't look at it . 437815_438015
if you can hear me, say yo . 438505_439565
say hey yo . 440405_441185
what'd you talk about bark beetles, good or evil ? 442745_445365
what do you think and a reason ? 445765_447025
I think they're good because they can go inside of the tree, if it's sick or dying, it'll help it decompose faster because it's eating away at it . 448065_456345
okay . 456565_456605
did you guys hear what S_thirteen said ? 457085_457985
it's an important idea . 458225_459245
that maybe they go inside it and they're good because they help decompose it faster . 460005_463185
it's probably bad because if there's less sick or dying trees in a forest and then they'll go for, they'll either die out or go for the like not-sick ones, the alive ones and eat away at them . 465155_480155
okay . 480715_480935
so some differing ideas . 481175_482215
anyone else have something else they want to add ? 482475_484035
mine is similar to S_thirteen's . 484335_485815
but it would be like they could decompose the dying trees faster . 486035_490375
so that, then it wouldn't fall . 490695_493055
like if it was super tall, maybe they could eat it and so it wouldn't fall and damage the forest or hurt and squash other animals . 493795_501595
okay . 502195_502755
any other thoughts ? 503155_506915
I really liked what you said over here . 507035_510215
they said, well, if it's doing something good for the environment, then it's good . 510355_515215
and we heard some different ideas of things that could either be good for the environment, like decomposing sick and dying trees faster, or decomposing them less fast . 515625_524425
so do we have kind of an overall consensus of the group ? 525385_528245
what do you guys think ? 528345_528965
are they good or bad for the forest ? 529125_530385
okay . 530585_532605
I'm hearing some good . 532945_533585
that's kind of how I feel about bark beetles personally, but again, that's not a scientific question . 534765_540105
that's a question about what we think about something . 540225_542525
I do have a story to tell you . 542965_544145
if you've ever been to a place like the Sierra Nevada or Colorado, give me a thumbs up . 544385_549345
you guys ever been there ? 549525_550165
okay .
turn and talk to someone next to you . 551945_553245
what was it like there ? 553365_554005
what did you see there ? 554225_554845
I saw mountains, I saw animals . 555065_558225
I saw +... 558865_559205
what did I see ? 560125_560745
awesome . 561085_562305
thanks for getting quiet . 562545_563345
if you saw trees in that place, give me a thumbs up . 564785_570325
anyone see trees there ? 570125_571365
yeah .
cool . 571685_572125
do you think there are bark beetles there ? 573165_574545
yeah, totally ? 575085_576105
no, it's too cold . 576265_577825
it's too cold maybe . 578185_579065
no, because they're artificial trees . 579745_581985
because they're artificial trees . 582225_583525
probably they wouldn't be in artificial trees totally . 583605_585565
so maybe they're not there because it's too cold . 585625_588225
what about in the summer ? 588285_589025
do you think they would be there in the summer ? 589205_590225
in Colorado, it gets hot in summer . 590565_592205
it gets hot in summer . 592205_592825
okay .
so just close your eyes for a second and imagine looking across a forest that's beautiful and bright and green totally full of tall, strong, healthy trees . 594025_602285
okay . 602545_604325
so there's this crazy thing that's happening in places like Colorado and a few places in Sierra Nevada and a few places up in Canada . 604745_612325
there's a species of bark beetle that's getting really, really good at killing healthy trees . 612905_618065
just like you guys said, when a bark beetle attacks a sick and dying tree, it might try and put some sap out there to stop the beetles . 618835_625175
but since it's sick and dying, it can't do that well enough to survive . 625595_628375
so the tree dies . 628815_629495
what these beetles are doing, is their populations are getting so huge that they're going up to a bunch of healthy trees and they're killing an entire forest at a time . 630155_642115
yeah . 642215_642335
maybe you've heard about that . 642415_643315
and like we were saying over here, like xxx was saying in places where it's cold, they can't really do that because their populations can't get big like that . 643905_653525
they die when the winter comes . 653705_654965
but since we're getting longer and hotter summers on record, they can have more and more babies and suddenly all the baby beetles go and they kill all the trees . 655465_662805
it's kind of crazy . 663285_664005
so in those places, this is kind of another big picture question that involves your opinion . 665085_669785
do you think that we, as humans should go in, in places like that and kill all the bark beetles ? 670745_676605
okay . 676925_678685
talk to the people next to you . 678945_680045
trees have our oxygen and if they ruin our oxygen then we're going to be dead . 680305_688105
I don't know how we are going to kill them, if their population just keeps growing . 689705_694785
like if you leave two bark beetles in the ground right here they could repopulate in like a month to two hundred . 696115_704295
if they kill our trees, then we're going to be dead . 704395_707635
so you'd almost have to like +... 708195_709735
dude, they would kill them . 710495_712915
because that's an invasive species and it could be a national park so they could destroy a whole forest at a time and it could destroy all our forests . 713035_721215
a couple of things, want to make sure that we're all +... 724765_726765
you guys are doing a great job of listening to each other right now . 727365_730105
and if we're disagreeing with each other here, that's totally okay . 730845_733585
when I asked that last question, I feel like half the group said yes . 733785_736725
and half the group said no . 736785_737825
if you disagree with someone that's okay, just make sure you do it politely . 738265_741545
okay . 741845_741905
what do you guys think ? 742145_743005
what are you thinking about ? 743085_743805
what you talking about ? 743945_744505
S_nine ?
I have one thing . 744625_745965
are they an foreign species ? 746745_750985
really, really good question . 751285_752605
that's a really good question . 752625_753625
did you guys hear his question ? 754105_754925
are they foreign or invasive ? 755125_756165
no . 756765_757665
the beetles that are doing this are not invasive . 757805_759645
they're from there . 759945_760665
natural species, but they're in conditions where there's a lot more heat, they have a lot longer seasons so they can reproduce and have bigger populations . 762105_770105
what do you guys think ? 771465_772205
I would say yes, we should go in because everything that lives on land and sometimes even underwater on earth, they need air to live . 772885_783185
and in some places there's already been tree shortages in some places . 783845_788665
so if the beetles are going to eat up the trees then it may not be a good idea, once it gets to a big problem, so we should stop it in the beginning . 789485_798105
okay . 798565_798705
any different ideas ? 798905_800025
she said we should stop it in the beginning . 800545_802285
what do you guys think about that ? 802505_803485
yeah . 803725_804225
okay . 804705_804985
I heard some yeahs . 805165_805905
S_six, you want to share ? 805965_807125
I don't really know how +... 807425_809785
I think we could stop them just if we leave two beetles behind, they could repopulate that fast . 810445_818825
so I don't really know if we could get rid of them . 819245_822425
okay . 822745_822985
so the question even of how we would do that . 823145_825285
that's kind of an interesting question . 825665_826925
how would we go in and kill all beetles in a way that wouldn't harm other creatures . 826985_830985
talk to the +... 831585_832045
maybe different people . 832765_833465
try and turn and talk to someone different . 833725_835005
only bark beetles .
like a poison . 835145_842745
they should make a poison that only kills bark beetles . 843965_846545
or we find another species or a species that kills the beetles . 846965_853565
but what if they don't just kill the beetles . 858035_860615
the only problem is, it might affect the tree . 861195_863815
yeah it could affect the tree . 864595_865695
maybe the tree wouldn't be able to survive . 865695_867855
xxx, contain yourself . 869515_870335
you'll be okay . 870515_870915
so I think that there are some ways . 871255_877315
but to chop down trees to get the beetles out +... 877375_881995
it's worse than them harming it . 882955_885035
but it's affecting all the other animals because all the other animals, like if you look in here, there's like holes over there and animals, so like count on the roots to hold the xxx up . 886315_898375
if you can hear me, say yo . 898555_900195
if you can hear me, say hey yo . 900555_902195
okay . 903475_904595
what'd you guys talk about ? 904915_905835
what do you think ? 905875_906335
I'm seeing a lot of the same sorts of hands . 906555_908675
can we maybe hear from someone that hasn't shared in the big group in a while ? 908835_911455
we should find their weakness . 913305_914685
we could find their weakness and we could use that against them . 915365_918745
like only specific to them . 919445_921065
okay .
so maybe we could find their weakness . 921665_922865
anyone want to add to that idea ? 923765_925085
anyone have something that relates to it ? 925285_927565
you can find what the trees can withstand and what they can't withstand and then use that . 927705_932565
ask scientists just to make certain type of spray for beetles and see if it's not poisonous to trees . 936385_943985
okay . 944565_944585
make a spray for beetles or something . 944845_946065
yeah .
I think the only way we could do it would be by maybe chopping down trees . 947065_954685
just because sprays, it could be effective to other animals . 955805_959705
can you say that again ? 961185_963905
so then if we chopped down all the trees, then we don't have any air left in that area . 966225_969825
I think that since the beetles are like overpopulating, they're killing our trees and trees give us oxygen . 970725_979585
so if all the trees go, then we're pretty much done . 979965_982425
okay . 982925_983025
I'm hearing a lot of people talk about trees as providing oxygen . 983165_986545
is there any other reason that it might be good to have trees around in a forest ? 987205_990425
what do you guys think ? 990585_991165
yeah . 991865_992605
S_thirteen .
shelter for animals . 992725_993885
okay . 994035_994255
shelter for animals . 994355_995275
what else ? 995515_995795
oxygen for us . 996135_998295
okay, oxygen for us . 998555_999535
anything ? 999775_999795
yeah . 1000215_1000255
S_eighteen ?
shade . 1000375_1000855
shade, totally . 1001235_1002195
S_nine .
food for other animals . 1002875_1005175
food for other animals . 1005355_1006235
the plants around the trees collect the water from the roots . 1006955_1010715
okay . 1010935_1011775
yeah . 1012735_1013395
we could isolate +... 1013815_1015135
you could isolate the forest and the parts that have been affected by the beetles the most and you can isolate them . 1015545_1024865
and then you could try and reduce the population . 1025385_1029225
okay . 1029685_1029945
try and reduce the population in one area . 1030065_1031765
so I want to take a step back and just really compliment this group . 1033345_1038745
