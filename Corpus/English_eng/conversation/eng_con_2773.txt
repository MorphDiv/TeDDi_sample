<mister> Justice , after you returned to Rochester from
I think , by and large , it was fairly quiet .
there was speculation of one kind or another .
did you ever hear that others were similarly interviewed , or were
I don't know the answer to that .
I remember one rather interesting incident that took place on the
maybe I shouldn't discuss this .
<mister> Justice , this is all confidential .
it's for history .
anyway .
I had stayed at the Cosmos Club when I was down there , and the
were you a member of the Cosmos Club at that point ?
I was a non-resident member of the Cosmos Club .
a number of us it goes back to my Mayo days actually .
it was a good place to stay , less expensive than Washington hotels
anyway , I was finally dropped off there , and I was hoping that
I had a five o'clock plane , or something , but they didn't .
they just dropped me at the Cosmos Club .
I grabbed my bag and scrounged for a cab .
fortunately , I found one .
they're not easy to get out there .
I got to the airport just in time , and went in , sat on an aisle
pretty soon I was putting my bag underneath the seat in front of me
the occupant of the seat on the other side said to the man standing
+" who is this guy , Blackmun , whose photograph is in today's
and the answer was , +"/.
+" oh , he's just another old conservative .
and here I was underneath .
I could tell who it was .
what do I do ?
do I stay underneath , or do I make my presence known ?
I finally pulled on his trouser leg , and said , “Walter , I'm
it happened to be Senator Mondale .
then the hostess said , +"/.
+" will everyone please take his or her seat ?
+" senator Mondale , will you please return to your seat ?
he said , +"/.
+" harry , I'll be right back .
sure enough , as soon as we were airborne he came back .
who was the fellow who'd asked him the question ?
he turned out to be a fellow named Kelly , who was a large
he ran a distributorship out of Bloomington , Minnesota , But the
+" I want you to know that I'm all for you , but I can't always say
I said , +"/.
+" Walter , I understand perfectly well .
so it worked .
how did you know him ?
I'd known him , of course , from practice days in Minneapolis .
he was a member of a very enterprising group of young lawyers who
he was one of them .
earl Larson , later a federal judge , was another one .
he must have been only recently elected to the Senate at that point
yes , I think so .
I think it was his first term .
had you had any contact with him before that point as a senator ?
I had no contact with him as a senator as such , no .
do you think he should have been president ?
he was close to it , wasn't he .
he wanted it .
he would have been a good president .
how was he as attorney general of Minnesota ?
I think he was a lot better than some of his predecessors .
Walter Mondale was always a person of integrity , and I respected
in those days , did you have any Republicans in Minnesota who were
I wouldn't say so .
I've never been politically active at all , and I was “good-old
I think the president was glad to find somebody who eventually was
the Senate was raw and bleeding , and the president was disturbed .
it finally solved the problem .
when you got back home , did you talk about this with <Mrs>
what was her reaction to the whole thing ?
as I indicated before , she's pretty pragmatic and would take it in
on the other hand , if it meant we were going to Washington , I
did you talk to your daughters at this point ?
what did they feel about it ?
yes , we kept in touch with them .
I remember when the nomination did come through , everyone of them
they were scattered at school and other places .
I didn't ask them to come , but they were all there when I got home
so pretty shortly after that , you then heard formally about the
yes .
where were you at the time ?
we were sitting in <Saint> Louis on a regular panel , and a
we finished the morning's cases and then went out in those days
the corridor was filled with reporters .
it was a fairly narrow corridor .
I ran into that kind of thing for the first time .
what were your colleagues' reactions that day ?
well , the panel I was sitting on was presided over by Judge Van
he immediately came down and said , +"/.
+" I think you should go home .
+" and don't worry about the cases , we'll take care of them .
he did the same thing about other pending argued cases that had not
it was a great boon to have him take things over .
he said , +"/.
+" don't worry about Eighth Circuit stuff , we'll take care of it .
how did your law clerks feel about the whole thing ?
I don't know .
I had one law clerk with me in <Saint> Louis together with
we all caught a Branniff plane and went back to Rochester .
as we came in on the tarmac , there were a lot of people standing
Dottie was there , arm in arm with Nina Totenberg , which upset me
how did she find out about it ?
did you know Nina Totenberg before ?
no , not really .
she was there .
she was on the way up , you know , trying to make a name for
she was there , Walter Cronkite had a stringer there , and some
were you scared ?
well , I didn't know exactly what was going on .
I wouldn't say I was scared , but it was a bit of a moment when we
how much time did you have to prepare for the confirmation hearings
it wasn't very long .
it seemed to me that , I think the nomination was the twelfth of
at what point did you meet with Nixon ?
did you go back out to Washington then ?
I think it was when I it might have been that earlier trip ,
they waved me into a chair at the end of the desk .
the two of them conversed , but very formally , which surprised me
I would have thought they would have done this on a first name
the question finally was asked by the president .
he said , “Do you have a recommendation” ?
Mitchell responded , +"/.
+" yes .
+" that the judge receive the nomination .
then there was discussion between the two of them as to when it
as I recall , this was a Thursday or Friday .
at the time one of the Apollo ventures was in trouble , and they
it was limping back .
there was concern for a while that it wouldn't make it .
it was decided that the nomination would not be announced until
well , they got it back all right , fortunately .
all this conversation was just going on with you just sitting there
you were not saying anything .
I didn't say anything .
I just sat there , and they were good enough to offer me a cup of
then Mister Mitchell , as I remember , was called out of
deliberately , do you think , or just happenstance ?
I think it was happenstance .
the president got up and walked over to the door looking out on the
so I went over , and we looked out .
he asked a couple of questions , among which , I'll never forget
+" what kind of a woman is <Mrs> Blackmun ?
I said , “What do you mean” ?
he said , +"/.
+" she will be wooed by the Georgetown crowd .
+" can she withstand that kind of wooing and resist it ?
I said I thought she could .
then we went back and sat down .
he turned to me and he said , +"/.
+" judge , what are you worth ?
I said , +"/.
+" what do you mean , what am I worth ?
+" how many dollars do you have ?
+, which annoyed me at the time .
I didn't know this was a factor to be considered , and it raised
he noticed my discomfort , and then I got a little lecture about
so I was on the receiving end of that .
otherwise , it was a happy enough conference .
did he ask you anything about your daughters ?
yes .
as I remember , there were some general questions as to how old
a question which was repeated later by Senator Kennedy in the
what was your impression of Nixon ?
did he strike you as cold or warm ?
did you have much of a personal interaction ?
I suppose more on the cool side than the warm side , but I
he was president , , and he was determined to be president .
did he ask you any questions about your judicial philosophy ?
no , because I think that had been gone over pretty well by the
I think he felt assured that if the attorney general said okay ,
did he actually ever say to you , +"/.
+" I'm going to nominate you to the Supreme Court , or offer you
no .
other than Mister Mitchell made the recommendation to him
so as for timing , you did not then go out in his presence and have
not that day , no .
that was the day when the conversation about “who is this guy
what did you do to prepare for the confirmation hearings ?
I didn't know what to do , and no one was instructing me .
I did go over all of the opinions I had written , that is , more or
there were some , that I thought were obvious materials for
I had no idea how the hearing would go .
so you had no liaison or coach from the Justice Department , no
no .
was there intense media coverage during this period that you were
were you being hounded by reporters during this period ?
to a degree , yes .
but I certainly tried to resist it as best I could .
were they camping out in front of your house or anything like that
not in front of the house , but they were out in front of my office
did you give them any interviews or anything ?
no .
and how about your mother ?
was she getting any inquiries during this time ?
yes .
as a matter of fact , I think Nina Totenberg interviewed her ,
I didn't want mother's privacy to be interfered with , but Nina on
what did your mother say ?
she handled herself pretty well .
I didn't worry about mother .
how about your kids and <Mrs> Blackmun , were they
they must have been .
as I say , they immediately came home with the nomination and were
I don't recall anything adverse that happened .
when you went out to the confirmation hearings , what do you
did you stay at the Cosmos Club again ?
yes .
I stayed at the Cosmos Club .
and was <Mrs> Blackmun with you ?
no , she was not .
and I've always regretted that .
but I advised her not to come , because I thought it might be a
she should have been there .
she deserved to be there at the time .
but so it was .
now one of Senator Eastland's staff people from the Judiciary
what role did he play in this stage of things ?
<mister> Ziglar was almost an administrative assistant to
Jim was from Pascagoula , Mississippi , so it was rather a natural
but he was most helpful , I think , in steering me through the
senator Eastland , of course , everybody called him “The Chairman”
they didn't call him Senator Eastland .
it was always “The Chairman” , and he was a very potent and
did you go up to the Hill and make courtesy calls ?
I did indeed .
I spent an entire day in the company of a man from the Department
I wasn't very enthusiastic about this .
but , evidently , what they did then , and I think they still do it
and I was told that every one of them said yes , they would , and
so I spent a whole day calling first upon one and then upon another
we didn't do it in any particular order , that is , Democrats first
but , it was a long and a wearing day .
I never did get lunch , and they didn't offer anything .
but , Mister Duffner got a doughnut at every
I think he must have put on about four pounds that day , and I lost
but it was interesting .
each senator conducted the hearings in a different way .
senator Thurmond called his entire staff in , and they all sat
others , such as Senator Cook , it was all a one-on-one interview .
so it was an experience for me .
what about Senator Birch Bayh ?
he had been the main interrogator of Carswell .
did he have a lot to say ?
yes , as I remember , I came away with a sense of antagonism on his
I think he was suspicious of all these nominees and , as you say ,
but I had to respect him .
he was able .
he was interested .
he was a valuable member of the Judiciary Committee .
how about Senator Kennedy .
he later actually was quite supportive of you , although at the
I remember when we reached his office on this general calling
but , then I went into his inner office and had what I thought was
we had some things in common .
both had gone to the same law school and the like .
that was only two years after the death of Bobby Kennedy , and he
it was indeed .
I remember there was a photograph in his office on the window ledge
I thought I came out of that conversation with Senator Kennedy
he was nice to me .
have you subsequently had many personal interactions with Senator
no , not really .
I wouldn't say any more than any other senator .
of course , at the hearings , the formal hearings as such , he
+" how do you get along with your daughters ?
+" can you communicate with them ?
+" are they with you ?
and so forth .
that was really one of the most personal exchanges of the hearings
how did your daughters react to that testimony after the fact ?
oh , they didn't mind it .
they all did it with a smile on their face , and we understood each
it's a term I use on myself .
what do you think he was driving at with these questions ?
I think he was concerned about the then-younger generation .
and rightly so .
this was right after the Sixties .
this was <nineteen seventy> .
fortunately , one of our daughters was a Massachusetts citizen and
did you have much support from Senator Mondale or Senator McCarthy
at the hearings , indeed I did .
much to my surprise because both were Democrats , and my nomination
I didn't know what position they might take , but they were both
I came away with a feeling that they were not acting as a team ,
it was a tough decision for them , I'm sure .
I try to put myself in their place .
to have this unknown nominee by a Republican president thrown out
two other congressman showed up to testify .
Albert Quie .
Albert Quie was the congressman at that time from southeastern
he showed up with the senators .
he was a Republican .
did you have much of a relationship with him , before ?
I knew him beforehand .
both as a practitioner , as I recall .
he was from , of course , southern Minnesota .
we were not intimate friends , but at least I knew him .
and then Clark MacGregor also came .
yes .
Clark MacGregor , of course , was a congressman from a district
I had known Clark for a number of years , both as a practitioner
I was not .
in retrospect , did you think that the hearings were hard or
how did you feel about them at the time ?
I thought they were a strain because one is out there sitting alone
one's whole life is investigated , really , It took me a little
they weren't particularly directed to me , but were directed more
once I realized that , I was more comfortable and settled down and
it isn't an easy kind of thing to go through .
everything hangs out , so to speak .
any question is fair .
did the <F_B_I> ever investigate you ?
that's become a common practice .
yes .
they did .
I remember when I checked into the Cosmos Club on one of these
I was registering , and a hand came around with an <I_D> in
+" I want to speak to you .
I said , +"/.
+" may I not go up to my room and unload these bags ?
he said , +"/.
+" no , I want to speak to you right now .
so we went over in a corner , and he asked me a lot of questions .
and that report went to the Judiciary Committee , you think ?
I'm sure it did , yes .
I suppose it's in the hearings .
they work fast .
the agent was complaining that they were under distinct pressure to
he said we like to have more time usually .
now there's a fair amount of questioning at the hearings about the
did you ever think that those were going to be a problem ?
sure .
because they had been a problem with Judge Haynsworth .
but I thought the way to attack it was to bring it out myself ,
chief Judge Johnsen even supported it .
I didn't know what it would do , but there it was .
there wasn't anything to hide .
did you feel that people were trying to label you as a conservative
oh , sure .
always those labels came out .
I suppose even the president felt that I had to be a conservative
in fact , reading your confirmation hearings there are a lot of
in particular , you mention the “little people” and your concern
was that something that you were interested in getting on the
not particularly interested in getting on the record , it just came
when did you hear about the Judiciary Committee's vote ?
was it soon thereafter ?
I remember it was seventeen to nothing , and , yes , it was very
did the Senate's vote follow shortly after the committee vote ?
there was a period , I'm guessing now , it seems to me , of about
the committee report was written up , and maybe there were some
so you have to wait for it , before it goes to the Senate floor .
and then that vote was also unanimous .
yes .
ninety-two to zip , as I recall .
how did you feel about that ?
I felt very gratified , really , that there wasn't this terrible
I think the Senate was glad to get it behind them .
they'd been on the barbed wire with the other two , and I suppose
when did it really hit you that you were going to be on the Supreme
I don't know whether I can answer that , as to when it really hit
it certainly made a lot of difference in our private lives , in the
was there ever any discussion about your simply waiting until the
no .
the chief justice , Burger at the time , asked me to come down as
he said there are a number of cases here that we need the ninth
as I remember , I hope I'm right in this , I think there were about
nobody told me , but what that meant to me was that the vote ,
so I had to go over those things .
were they sent to you in Minnesota ?
yes , they were .
as a matter of fact , I think the day after the confirmation two
I called him up and I said , +"/.
+" say , I have Eighth Circuit material I have to get rid of yet ,
his response was , +"/.
+" you get at this stuff and let the Eighth Circuit case go into a
which maybe was right .
but , I think that was the reason that I went down and voted on
as I recall the first two weeks of the October session that year ,
so you voted to grant cert in about how many of them , would you
oh , I'm guessing , maybe seventeen out of the forty-seven ,
there were some that needed it all right .
how were you finishing up your Eighth Circuit work at the time ?
did you have much ?
well , Judge Van Oosterhout came to my rescue , and , as I
indeed , that's exactly what he did .
he was a great help , and , in effect , relieved me of nearly all
so how did you go about wrapping up your affairs in Minnesota ?
did you put the house on the market right then ?
I didn't have much trouble with the house because our next door
so I had a potential buyer right next door , and it was just a

I thought a while of keeping it , but I didn't want to be an
of course , it's cost me money in the long run .
how about finding a place to live in <D_C> ?
well , it was not easy .
we found somebody who showed us around all over the place .
we finally ended up where we still are , in the Normandy House over
Dottie and I moved in there temporarily twenty-four years ago , and
fortunately , we didn't have a problem that some justices do of
but it was convenient , and we liked the apartment , and there we
how did <Mrs> Blackmun feel about the move at this point ,
well , I didn't get any feeling of despair or discomfort .
I think it was exciting for her .
we came down in June , and Chief Justice Burger said you need be
well , we were there well into July .
then went back and settled things out and returned on the , as I
how about your office staff , your secretary , and the clerks ?
I had hired a clerk for the Eighth Circuit duty , and asked him
he was enthusiastic about that .
his predecessor we were entitled to two at the time , as I
he wanted to get back into Minnesota .
but I said , +"/.
+" mike , do you want to stay on .
+, this is Mike LaFond .
mike LaFond and have another year here ?
+" they reversed gears and stayed on a second .
+" it's one of the two exceptions that I've made for two year
+" I think they enjoyed being there , and it certainly helped out
and whose chambers did you occupy when you went to the Court ?
I took over the chambers that are now occupied by Justice Brennan ,
I suppose Justice Fortas had been in there .
it's a smaller chamber than others , because it's restricted by the
but I was there for a while until I moved where I ended up .
did you actually sit on any argued cases in that term in June , or
I just went on the conference and voted on the cert petitions that
each time , of course , they would announce that +"/.
+" justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration or decision
case after case after case , and I felt as though I hadn't done any
when did you actually get sworn in ?
on the ninth day of June , <nineteen seventy> .
what kind of ceremony was held ?
as I remember , it was in an open court .
there are two oaths to take , of course .
what are the two oaths ?
there's a constitutional oath , and then there's the judicial oath
often they're administered separately , usually now we do one in
did Nixon come to watch you be sworn in ?
no .
he did not .
chief Justice Burger , after the swearing in , insisted that we go
so he and I went down , and visited a minute with the president ,
did he seem happy ?
I think so .
although he didn't know me , of course .
but I think he was gratified that this wrangle was behind him .
when did you first meet the other justices ?
I think probably it was the day I was sworn in .
I remember walking into the robing room , getting robed , and then
we all shook hands , as we always do .
they welcomed me , I guess , didn't know who this guy was .
how many of them had you met before ?
white I knew because he'd been circuit justice for the Eighth
I think that's about it , although I must have met some of them on
in the time we have left , I'd to just go through each of the
starting with seniority , Hugo Black .
I had one year with Hugo Black , and I regard it as a very
I learned a lot from Justice Black .
he was a canny , experienced person , who of course with all of his
I think he also enjoyed being on the Court .
but he often used his senatorial expertise in his voting , in the
but , I learned a lot from Hugo in the way of analyzing cases and
I respected him highly , and it was sad to see him deteriorate
did you have much private conversation ?
not a great deal .
a little .
I remember his coming down one time , I think it was the first
he called up and said Harry , +"/.
+" I'm coming down to see you about this opinion .
I said , +"/.
+" well , stay where you are .
+" you are the senior , I'll come to your chambers .
he said , +"/.
+" you stay where you are .
+" I'll come down .
+" I said I'm coming down .
and down he came .
I stood at the door and watched him shuffle down the hall .
he was holding a copy of my opinion , like this , as he walked in
+" I like the opinion .
+" you go for the jugular .
+" always go for the jugular .
but he said , “You agonize in it” .
I had a couple of sentences of how hard the case was for us .
he said , +"/.
+" never agonize in an opinion .
+" make it sound as though it's just as clear as crystal .
well , I thought about that , and then I thought maybe it was
but I violated that in Roe against Wade where I think second and
what was your first impression of William <O> Douglas ?
I went down having read about him and read his opinions and some of
this was a fellow I had to get along with .
that was my number one priority .
and if I may say so myself , I think we got along very well .
some people would say he was a typical redhead , in the sense that
but he was , to use my phrase , he was able and articulate , and I
I had a little special time with him in the sense that at that time
something happened where our car was laid up for a couple of weeks
so I asked if I I needed a ride to and from the Court did
but it gave me a chance to visit with him on that ride .
I felt I got to know him on those occasions and what he was
we got along well .
when did you realize you had a common love of the environment ?
I think right from the beginning .
I'd always had that .
was he from Minnesota ?
he was born in Minnesota , strangely enough , born up in a county
I well remember the time , I hope I haven't said this before , when
I'd warned Chief Justice Burger that this was going to come along .
he wondered what I was talking about because he was not a baseball
sure enough pretty soon the press got on to the Minnesota Twins
but one day , in discussing a case , the chief justice went on at
and Douglas was next to him down at the end of the table , and said
+" chief , I vote also to affirm .
well , that surprised the chief , and I suppose he showed it .
Douglas said , +"/.

I think it shocked Chief Justice Burger a little bit , but Douglas
Douglas had just gone through a series of efforts by
did he show any signs of this ?
yes .
he was very sensitive about it , I think .
congressman Ford was gung-ho down the impeachment line .
I think this bothered Justice Douglas to a degree , as it would
there was this constant threat of impeachment .
fortunately , it didn't come about .
he was noted for his prickly behavior in his personal life and
did he show this with his colleagues ?
yes , I saw it .
one time I think he fired his law clerk three successive days in a
the next morning the law clerk would show up and go about his
he was a little rough on his law clerks , took a lot out of them ,
would he be harsh with other justices in conference or argument ?
no , but he didn't hesitate to show contempt for their theories at
but he wasn't harsh with them .
he didn't insult them or anything like that .
there's a story told in The Brethren of when you first took the

no .
I do not .
the story is that when you were first sitting there in your seat on
that one incident on the bench he always wrote opinions on the

do you think he was a genius ?

that term is sometimes used .
he had certain aspects of being a genius , I think , and some that
we only have time for me to ask about one other justice at this
tell me about John Marshall Harlan , your first impression of him .
well , I was always impressed by Justice Harlan for a couple of
he was , of course , a patrician of the first order .
he personified that , I think .
out of New York , although a graduate of New York Law School .
the other thing that was noticeable about John Harlan was the fact
he had one of these high intensity lights on the conference table ,
when he asked questions , of course , he did it out of hand .
he didn't have notes that he could read .
I was always impressed with the fact that he was able to carry on
I suppose one would say he was conservative in his voting , but he
he was personable , and yet , as I say , a patrician of the old
I guess very different from his grandfather .
what was he like ?
well , I'm told that he was the last of the tobacco-chewing
