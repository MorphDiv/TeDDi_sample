&-uh this . 6540_6710
one . 6850_6950

many times . 36480_36710
yeah . 37070_37180
once . 37590_37810
twice twice . 38770_39470
okay . 40550_40790
and then &-um how are you making the full quilt . 41420_44360
what . 46770_46900
you're doing to this . 46960_47620
two by two . 47920_48390
all . 52020_52090
&-uh oh . 55790_55890
I see . 57400_57610
do you like that . 58640_59230
I mean what do you like about that . 59880_61300
obviously you like it you . 61430_62780
made it . 62910_63070
what do you like about that . 64150_64980
Danny . 65000_65230
&-um that the red and yellow . 66620_69850
those are my favorite colors . 70170_71310
okay . 72390_72620
so you have some favorite colors here . 72970_74350
&-um here can you tell me anything else that you like about it . 75420_78130
I think it's a very cool quilt too . 78550_80070
is there any kind of pattern . 83220_84230
so like when you say it goes like that . 101060_102870
what do you mean by . 103490_104010
that . 104080_104230
uhhuh . 115290_115420
that's &-uh I see . 116300_117130
so you're telling you had to make your two by two design . 118200_120460
mhm . 120860_121180
is this symmetric . 122200_122990
can you show me how you know it . 128490_129780
this two triangle . 131150_132070
if you split it in half what happens to Mr Metric . 136500_139140
the two would match up . 141020_142260
they match up . 142500_143060
so in other words if I hold that over it'll match exactly fellow .
is there any other way in which it symmetric . 147660_149620
I see one line here . 149920_150980
you just pointed out . 151100_151910
is there any . 152020_152470
are there any other line . 152620_153390
uhhuh . 154490_154550
I see . 156480_156630
&-um if I do this right <what what> what makes it . 159580_163510
oh you mean this top part is symmetric . 163640_165420
what_about if I do the whole quilt at once . 166310_168740
you said like this way . 169900_170860
yeah . 172360_172510
&-um it would still be symmetrical because this would <match this
so I can cut it this way . 181340_182630
left . 183150_183380
or this way . 184020_184790
I see &-uh any other lines . 185360_187490
that's it . 189450_189780
okay . 189950_190180
how many of these have you made . 191210_192030

this is the way this is after I am turning . 223440_231300
and how much . 231810_232140
let's mark this . 242210_243060

attach that hole . 289380_290310
yeah . 291920_292070
the middle looks different around the edge . 292140_294690
it looks exactly the same . 295420_296950
the center . 297780_298260
it different . 298660_299300

the workspace did not hold . 402980_404220
any more objects . 404260_405210
I I want that to go there there and there and shrink . 405820_411920
it would be right here . 412400_413580
uhhuh . 413960_414080
make a . 414910_415950
finished square where it's not gonna let me . 416200_418820
no it's not . 419180_419790
maybe you could &-um take some of those things that it has there
I would . 426880_431150
shrink those . 427510_427590
okay . 431310_431580
let's see . 431970_432590
maybe you need to select one of those . 432970_434380
&-um well you gotta keep it all together as a let's see . 436740_443230
let's click on that one . 444130_445230
here . 447870_447990
is that how it says . 448300_449060

right now . 453400_453630
is is it . 453820_454390
yes . 454460_454590
it's really . 454750_455340
and this is supposed to go . 455990_456950
how much do you think it's shrinking it each time . 457700_459310
I don't know . 461400_461780
you not . 461940_462310
you're . 462380_462560
not you don't know . 462800_463270
well that's because let's just get one . 463390_466270
but . 466460_466630
you kind of do it until it matches what you want to do . 466680_469510
yeah . 472000_472140
I don't know what to do about that . 472320_473450
Danny . 473610_473910
nice . 475570_475740
design . 475760_476110
what was . 476410_476580
what I need you to do for right now . 476920_478020
is say it is this your first one . 478100_479690
a diamond . 480760_481050
a diamond . 481800_481990
your first one . 482540_482860
yeah . 483750_483890
inhale . 484260_484450
okay . 484790_484890
I noticed that's a_lot_of different colors . 485440_486410
those are all the colleges . 488610_490030
one I . 492900_495950
need . 502750_502870
so you you're basically copying all of these . 507180_510180
and shrinking seeing what will happen . 510760_513350
do you like the design . 514860_515539
you're making what . 516470_518630

the plate . 533340_533780
uhhuh . 534160_534290
is it symmetric . 534760_535410
I shouldn't get too small . 537320_538150
I'm not really sure about it . 538420_539710
uhhuh . 540010_540070
and Danny who else is how do you think they could find out . 540700_542830
