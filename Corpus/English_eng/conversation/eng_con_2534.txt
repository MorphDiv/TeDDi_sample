alright Sue now it's like &-uh I dropped like Chem one twenty five
this year ?
this ⌈ term ⌉ ?
⌊ this +//.
⌋ yes this &~se semester right now ⌈ I ⌉ +/.
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, late dropped because like xxx I missed a_couple_of classes my
+, mhm +/.
+, and secondly it's like &-uh I told you I was transferring to
&~ri oh but you dropped chem ⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ &~y Chem ⌋ one twenty five and the thing is when I spoke to the
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ the transfer ⌋ and she told me it's like &-uh my &~GP since my
and &-uh right now in my engin class I'm doing like
+, ⌊ that's good ⌋ yeah .
+, chemistry I'm doing like a C .
and Math one sixteen like a c@l plus .
+, okay +/.
+, mm I could get it up to a b@l minus a B easily like it
+, mhm +/.
+, and I don't see much hope of getting into engineering .
+, right .
+, and I don't want to waste my time doing it +/.
+, I +/.
+, I want to start working on some other major and +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, one major I'm interested in economics but I want to do something
math ?
stats ?
⌈ what would go well ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ no let me +//.
⌋ I feel like +/.
+, a double major ?
you can do a double major or did you know that you can concentrate
what do you mean by that ?
no .
I mean ⌈ that &~y ⌉ .
⌊ there's ⌋ something I heard called organizational studies ⌈
⌊ that's &~ri ⌋ you can &~tha organizational studies is an
well I'll put my pencil in the math section so &=laughs we can
&-um organizational studies is an interdisciplinary social science
is it like a very I mean substantial degree <I mean>
I think ⌈ &~everythi ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I wanna ⌋ go back to like home and you know I mean out
+, mhm +/.
+, maybe organizational studies but back home in India it's like
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ of this ⌋ they don't even know what it is like if I'm
⌈ so ⌉ it's like .
⌊ well ⌋ it will be +//.
it's sort_of +//.
it's a management human resource ⌈ kind of job is that what you &~wa
⌊ I mean are we take +//.
are we allowed to take &-uh ⌋ courses from the Business School ?
yes .
how many ?
well as an L_S_And_A student even if you don't major in LS +//.
in in organizational studies you may take up to twelve credits
⌈ anywhere ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ in the ⌋ Business School which is four course +//.
you know you could take it four +//.
up to twelve credits in any school outside of ⌈ L_S_And_A ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, but if you wanted to do Business School you could take all
+, uhuh +/.
+, at the Business School ⌈ and that's that's ⌉ .
⌊ I've taken like ⌋ engineering already so ⌈ that's one ⌉ .
⌊ and then you ⌋ can take three classes and still get +//.
you hafta have a hundred and eight L_S_And_A credits +/.
mhm +/.
+, and a hundred and twenty credits total to graduate so if you
⌊ but +//.
if +//.
a double ⌋ major would take me like how many years to graduate like
&-um it depends on what you want your double major to be ⌈ if you
⌊ what do you suggest ?
I mean I want ⌋ one to be economics for sure I want to do something
so you know you want +//.
if you wanted to &~econ economics and organizational studies you
and organizational studies ?
I could do both ?
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <I mean> how many credits are required then ⌋ ?
⌈ (be)cause how many more credits ⌉ do you have to go ?
I have thirty one plus like &-uh I think since I'm dropping this
okay so you are going to need seventy eight more credits to go
to get an organizational studies and economics ?
no to get an L_S_And_A degree +/.
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ to graduate ⌉ from this school right ?
⌊ so how you want to fill ⌋ .
⌈ yeah but what about getting the double ⌉ degree ?
you wouldn't be a double degree (be)cause both of those majors are
okay +/.
+, so you'd have one degree with two areas of ⌊ expertise ⌋ .
⌈ two &~con ⌉ two concentrations .
right ⌊ so it's ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ how many credits ⌉ are required for that ?
a hundred and twenty same amount +/.
⌊ same amount ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ it's just ⌉ gonna depend on how you want to spend your credits
+, alright +/.
+, do you want to spend your credits doing one concentration in
or would you like to spend almost all of the remaining credits in
economics and organizational studies .
and organizational studies is pretty much &-um quite diverse
I mean .
yes it's very interdisciplinary &-um one thing that you should be
⌈ for organizational studies ?
I mean I'd hafta ⌉ take the same class twice if it's required ?
well you'd hafta take a different class .
⌊ a different one okay okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ not the same course twice ⌉ .
&=laughs ⌊ they would ⌋ make you be more diverse .
so that's just something to be aware of +/.
+, I know ⌈ the prerequisites for ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but in any event it would be about ⌋ fifty seven credits total
forty two credits ?
+, yeah +/.
+, at the end of this term ?
+, mhm +/.
+, so you'd need how many is that ?
+, seventy ⌈ yeah I think so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ seventy eight credits to go ⌋ .
anyway so you're still going to have a good twenty credits to play
⌊ I've finished ⌋ like Econ one oh one one oh
⌈ those are the prereqs ⌉ .
+, ⌊ start out with ⌋ four oh one four oh two
+, ⌈ absolutely mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ Math one fifteen ⌋ Math one sixteen +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, English one twenty five &-uh I don't know .
what about like &-uh +//.
what what are the kind of courses that I can take you know
I mean I don't know exactly what .
&-um I don't have the flyer here .
you can get the flyer right outside of our office +/.
uhuh +/.
+, &-um but the kind of courses that you can take are going to be
how many credits are .
thirty credits .
thirty credits ?
you have to +//.
and &~t four of the thirty credits needs to be statistics +/.
mhm +/.
+, and you might be able to talk +//.
you know to ask Toni Morales .
for example you're gonna hafta take statistics for economics +/.
+, also +/.
+, if you take statistics for economics you probably won't need to
but you just told me that you can't double count them .
right but you +//.
right well she +//.
I think you just +//.
you can just +//.
you have the stats but then you have take like four credits of a
⌈ <instead of> statistics ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ for org@n studies ⌋ yeah they won't make you take two stats .
don't worry about that .
&-um .
what other kind of courses are required for ⌈ &~organizati ⌉ ?
⌊ well ⌋ there's a_lot_of &~economi you can take +//.
this is how it works .
⌈ you take &~sh ⌉ .
⌊ so I'll be doing ⌋ economics in economics also +/.
no +/.
+, and economics in organizational also ?
it depends on how you wanna organize it .
okay +/.
+, <alright okay> it's gonna be &~th organizational studies
&=looking_for_paper do I have paper in here ?
I have paper but I've written on my paper .
let me see if I can do something else .
organizational studies is gonna be &=writes org@n studies is
including +...
a statistics class right ?
&=spelling_word_to_herself sta^ti^stics .
&=laughs okay .
and you can get the flyer outside our ⌈ office ⌉ .
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, and then this is how the rule is gonna go .
there's a whole bunch of social science departments primarily
⌊ I've done ⌋ course in political science .
do you think that will count towards it ?
is it a thirty hundred level course or a ⌈ one hundred level course
⌊ &-uh I think it ⌋ was two hundred I think I I don't remember
&-um ⌈ they don't &~ha &~po xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ two thirty ?
no no no ⌋ it was definitely not a hundred level course
+, if it &~w +/.
+, Comparative Politics ?
it's probably one sixty ?
I I think so one sixty .
it would be +//.
count as a prerequisite .
it would make you +//.
for all of your concentrations for economics +/.
uhuh +/.
+, and organizational studies or mathematics or philosophy or
&~m the courses that make up the concentration are &~thirty hundred
so you spend your first two years here for the most part taking
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, figuring out what you like what you don't like .
you know you might like mathematics and chemistry but if
you know you work your hardest and you get the c@l plus and you're
so that counts for natural science now you know &=laughs and that's
so org@n studies you hafta have one statistics class and then
then you have to take +...
&=writes plus you take courses from four social science
⌈ &-uh I just ⌉ .
⌊ one ⌋ from each department or ?
nope ⌈ well ⌉ +/.
⌊ oh ⌋ +/.
+, there's +//.
they +//.
there's about eight or nine departments to choose from so you just
+, okay +/.
+, right ?
and I'll just write such as anthro poli sci
I'll put econ last because you'll +//.
most of your econ +//.
I'm sure what will happen with you is you will do your econ for
+, mhm +/.
+, the economics that ⌈ you ⌉ .
⌊ can't I ⌋ like &-um take few courses from psychology and few from
that is how that works ⌈ yes yes ⌉ +/.
⌊ I can do ?
like ⌋ mix and match .
⌈ alright ⌉ .
+, ⌊ correct ⌋ .
and the &~th the &~th &~un unifying theme is gonna be that the
how people organize themselves how they work as teams how they
so so thematically it'll be unified but you'll be looking at
and so that's how that works and you may take no more than
so you can't for example say that you're doing organizational
+, ⌈ alright ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ if ⌋ you're going to do that their position is just major in
you're not really doing an interdisciplinary concentration (0.4) .
that's how that works .
does that make sense ?
yeah it does +/.
⌈ yeah it's +//.
there's a flyer in the &~ha ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ what are my other options to take like ⌋ along with &~organi
economics and statistics maybe or maths I think &-um +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, it'll take me a_lot_of time to complete my prerequisites right ?
for what for statistics ?
for statistics if I wanna .
well let's look at the prereqs for statistics .
not very many people major in statistics .
I don't know those by heart .
⌈ I know ⌉ .
⌊ economics ⌋ and statistics then ?
<I &~d> .
yeah it's interesting that that would be the case .
let me just economics you you need Math one fifteen which I
uhuh +/.
+, and &-uh Econ one oh one and one oh two so
+, yeah +/.
+, and then the economics concentration is simply going to be ⌈
⌊ four oh one ⌋ four oh two ?
⌈ four oh one four oh two a &~stati ⌉ ⌊ and &-uh
⌈ a statistics &~cla ⌉ .
no ⌊ a statistics class ⌋ and then an additional fifteen credits in
mhm +/.
+, and you have this +//.
you have a book but yours is gonna be blue I think .
but I gave you one I know do you still have it ?
+, oh +/.
+, a bulletin ?
the old one ?
⌈ yep ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yeah I do ⌋ .
⌈ you do ⌉ yeah economics hasn't changed at all .
but +/.
⌊ yeah I I read the book ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ they they they tell you ⌉ you know ?
you need four oh one four oh two you need
including at least six credits that are gonna be really
so those are going to be more quantitative courses .
and all in all that comes out to &=calculating_aloud fifteen and
comes out to like twenty six credits total so that's not +/.
+, ⌊ that's not a_lot ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ it's it's ⌉ you know it's hard work ⌊ but it's not a_lot ⌋
+, ⌈ about seventy eight ⌉ +/.
+, and so for statistics which not very many folks concentrate in
&=flipping_through_bulletin prerequisites went too far +...
are simply going to be +//.
I've met with people who are concentrating in statistics but
you know what this is not terribly difficult .
thirty credits ⌊ more ⌋ .
⌈ okay ⌉ right but you know so is organizational studies +/.
⌊ yeah that's true ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so is communication ⌉ studies it depends on how quantitative
one course is similar between the both right ?
econ and .
right well you can use the &~eco the Statistics four twenty five
I went to math sorry if we look under +//.
and here you can overlap .
org@n studies you can't overlap because <it's a> it's a student
&-um I went too far where the heck is econ ?
here .
statistics you could take Statistics four twenty six kachew@i
mhm +/.
+, there .
so there .
so that does overlap Stats four oh two .
that also overlaps ?
mhm thirty no well that's just +//.
<it's a> it's a pretty basic class .
but you would need to take mathematics through Linear Algebra
⌈ no I'm in Calc Two ⌉ .
so that'll be ⌊ like ⌋ .
⌈ so &~st ⌉ statistics you'd hafta continue to go on ⌊ in
⌈ and I'm done in Computer ⌉ Science one eighty three also .
so that's +//.
you're in good shape for that if you like that .
so you need to take two more semesters of mathematics and then
then then you're ready to take thirty credits of stats .
and they tell you the courses you need to have both four twenty
General Linear Models you're thinking about models and applications
and then you get to sort_of specialize .
I don't know +//.
I I know one thing I have to do major in economics but I +/.
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ just ⌉ seems like so simple like twenty six more credits .
I wanna do something else along with it .
right .
and I ⌊ think ⌋ +/.
⌈ so ⌉ +/.
+, what you should think about in terms of a double major Nitin is
how do you want to spend your time ?
not just I wanna do something else but ⌊ what do you enjoy
⌈ well I would like to like ⌉ organizational studies seem
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, something that's just interesting I'm going through the book I ⌊
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, take this course maybe in history or something could I take
in organizational studies ?
yeah .
if it's about business history yes .
business history ?
so that's +//.
organizational studies is sort_of linked around the theme of
so all the courses have names such as Law and Social Organization .
&=laughs .
and besides &-um this and my twenty four credits I can still take
how many credits do I have ?
⌊ at the ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ eight ⌉ credits at the Business School right ?
you +//.
yeah I think you have nine credits of +//.
oh yeah eight credits +/.
⌊ eight credits ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ at the Business ⌉ School (be)cause you have a four credit
or I could take more also if I want right ?
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ it's ⌉ just like I would require that extra credit instead of
+, ⌊ correct ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ one twenty I would ⌉ require one twenty one .
+, you got it .
⌊ not a biggie ⌋ .
+, ⌈ and that's no problem ⌉ .
and you know if if you're in a situation where you're taking so
for example if you said +"/.
+" I don't care if I don't get into engineering I'm going to
uhuh +/.
+, you know eventually you're gonna run into difficulty because
+, ⌊ <haven't had enough credits> ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ had their courses ⌉ so that's not a good use of your time
but a_lot_of students will take like one or two extra courses
and it's not a really +//.
very difficult to graduate with say a hundred and twenty six or a
⌊ you know if you have a hundred and sixty I would worry ⌋ .
⌈ and the thing is it +//.
&~wi with these &-uh ⌉ with organizational studies I will have
summer I don't wanna spend in Michigan .
<it's like> &-um it's like I don't know maybe travel the
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ and ⌉ &-uh with engineering my my courses which I could
+, ⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ I +//.
there ⌉ are not many classes I could take like in other engineering
+, correct +/.
+, but do you think I'll be able to take a_lot_of classes I mean
⌈ to transfer in ⌉ ?
you'd hafta talk to the organizational studies advisor ⌊ but yes
⌈ I mean usually do concentrations ⌉ like &-uh four oh one
mhm +/.
+, if I do it in NYU will it be able to &~trans will it be
it can you +//.
we have credit equivalency books you can look it up if NYU
no I mean courses that are specific for the concentration +/.
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ like ⌉ four oh two .
if if you can find a course which comes in +/.
uhuh +/.
+, as as Econ four oh two +/.
+, uhuh ⌊ then it's like alright ⌋ .
+, ⌈ yeah absolutely ⌉ .
you know you need to be careful you can't for ⌊ example ⌋ .
⌈ I mean ⌉ before I go I gotta find out if it's transferable +/.
right +/.
+, right okay .
and you also can't +//.
and you hafta be careful like most departments will say you can
&~a &~la &~li let's see if econ says that .
&=flipping_through_catalog skipping +/.
⌊ yeah &~econ ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ too far ⌉ econ will say and they do actually say this they
so four oh two seems okay but they're saying they don't
&=laughs okay here .
okay and they they tell you what they want taken on campus .
okay .
must be taken on Ann Arbor campus other than that I mean is
⌈ mhm ⌉ right just so any concentration courses to be taken outside
of Ann Arbor hafta be approved in advance by an economics
okay at least twelve credits in the concentration plan
and they would &~in and and so they're +//.
actually all they're saying is at least twelve credits in the
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, so you can't go somewhere else and take your quantitative
it looks like you can take four oh two somewhere else if
+, okay +/.
+, &-um and that's always just a courtesy .
but they have issues about like you cannot take &-um +...
right &~tw twelve credits you can't say that you're majoring in
⌈ not all of them ⌉ I mean just like if I in the summer one course
right one course two course not a biggie .
you know six courses yes a biggie .
&=laughs &-um .
and what about for organizational studies then ?
well same difference .
you know again you can't take most of the concentration outside of
⌈ <what do> &~y what do students usually ⌉ like do with
what's a common double major ?
well it depends on your interests .
&-um one of my students is majoring in economics and philosophy .
you know if you like philosophy that would work well .
economics and political science economics and history economics
economics and comparative literature is my most ambitious student
&=laughs it's &-uh it's really up to you and what you like .
so if you wanna study businesses and social organizations then
+" <I want the> &~p I want the ability to explore widely and
I mean that's another approach too .
you don't hafta have a double major .
oh economics and psychology's a big one too .
which is kind_of like org@n studies .
mhm +/.
+, but people don't +//.
you know they don't do org@n studies they would just would do that
maybe I will try like next semester I could start off taking four
mhm +/.
+, and what other courses do you think I should take like ⌊ <to
⌈ (be)cause you're just ⌉ you're just a sophomore right ?
yeah ⌊ I'm just a sophomore ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ and you're &~th ⌉ you're thinking about org@n studies .
have you had any psychology yet ?
no I'll +//.
maybe I'll take Psych one eleven ?
so maybe Psych &~four oh you know Econ four oh one and
&-um are you thinking seriously about statistics ?
I don't know +/.
⌊ do you want that mathematics ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ maybe I should try one statistics ⌉ .
I'll +//.
I could take a statistics course it would +//.
&-um the same one I require for my econ concentration also .
⌊ it's not a prerequisite ⌋ .
⌈ I would not I ⌉ would not take the four oh one and
(be)cause four oh one's a pretty +/.
prerequisite kind of ⌊ thing ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ pretty ⌉ tough well it's not even really a prereq
Psych one eleven four oh one what else ?
do you need any humanities ?
I'm not sure how many I have in humanities .
how many +//.
have you had any philosophy religion ?
I've had like &-um no +...
I've had like &-uh first year humanities seminar +/.
okay +/.
+, one one course .
I mean that's a possibility to take another humanities if you're
you might wanna go on and take Calc Three .
I don't know film and video studies also count as the humanities or
⌈ what ⌉ ?
what ?
film and video studies ?
humanities .
I've got one more of that .
⌊ I've already &~do I've done that ⌋ .
⌈ oh you have that ⌉ ?
so it sounds like your distribution's pretty healthy .
I think you should be really selfish and you should read through
and so take four oh one Stats one eleven and two
I mean just doing economics give me so much like freedom to do
⌈ it's kinda ⌉ scary isn't it ?
I could finish my concentration like by end of next year I think ?
by +//.
if I ⌊ did summer term ⌋ ?
⌈ well ⌉ you could ⌊ or what ⌋ +/.
⌈ or the &~f ⌉ +/.
+, you could do is you could just take four oh one this
you could take four oh two in the fall and another
you know you can basically take two econ courses from here on out
I was thinking about I wanted to do accounting also +/.
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ because ⌉ just for the general +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ idea of ⌉ it if I do accounting also next semester do you
two seventy one Accounting ?
hm accounting is again +//.
both four oh one and Accounting two seventy one take up
⌈ yeah I know people ⌉ I know people who are doing it two people in
so +/.
+, in fact one guy is like almost as similar to what I'm doing
he's doing four oh two in fact &=laughs:S2 not four oh
&-um yeah I +//.
so that +//.
I mean that would be a possibility and that would count as one of
that would count as another non L_S_And_A class .
if that's something that you want +...
I want I wanted to show you math just +//.
oh it's open to math just so you know .
math I couldn't just like I went through the concentration and
you wouldn't want to major in something like ⌊ mathematical
⌈ yeah I mean I don't even +//.
⌉ haven't started the prerequisites for the classes yet you know I
⌊ hm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ one one five ⌉ one one six I've pretty much no
well you have to &~t you'd hafta take +//.
it's the same prerequisites that you would need for statistics .
two one five two one six .
yep you need two more classes +...
do you +/.
⌊ so ⌋ +/.
+, think I should go with two one five next semester ?
&-um a ⌈ lot ⌉ +/.
⌊ hm ⌋ +/.
+, of it's gonna depend on your interests .
are you enjoying math ?
do you like it ?
&-um I'm not sure .
&=laughs I mean if you like it .
you know taking something's never a bad thing if it makes you feel
and certainly economics says you know the only prereq
but then they say and I like this what did they say ?
quote it exactly economics says you know &{l=READING students
and they of_course recommend Calc Two Calc Three and Linear Algebra
so you know they're happy to encourage you to go as high as you'd
I guess I could go ⌈ up to ⌉ +/.
+, two fifteen because I always think maths is no harm .
I don't mind studying math it's kinda ⌈ &~applic ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, applicable in whatever I do no matter what .
&~ri well I think that's true of almost anything .
you know it's good to learn ⌈ almost anything you use it ⌉ .
⌊ math has been the only subject ⌋ like that I've been +//.
that has been constantly +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ studying ⌋ throughout always +/.
+, yep +/.
+, no matter what I've been concentrating in like English for
+, mhm +/.
+, math I've always been +//.
I've always been studying math so it kinda you know doesn't
+, okay +/.
+, I just kinda feel enh@i it's just I have to do it it's like
well you actually don't need to do it anymore .
even even if you major in economics you don't need to do
would it make you happy to go on ?
they're happy if you go on , I'm happy if you go on , are you happy
what if I take a history course ?
how how tough are history courses ?
two hundred level history courses ?
well history courses are gonna be a different kind of skill
so if you're gonna do statistics like if you're gonna take
⌈ alright ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ right ⌋ so you hafta kinda think in advance +/.
+, uhuh +/.
+, what you're gonna be doing and that's that was really the only
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ that's true +/.
+, and the &-um four oh one together .
history's gonna be a whole different kind of work .
it's gonna be reading and writing papers .
so just as you wouldn't want to take you know two history courses
(be)cause it's a different ⌈ kind of skill ⌉ .
⌊ I always ⌋ liked this one history course I'm interested in it's
uhuh +/.
+, &-uh Twentieth_Century American Wars ?
+, yep +/.
+, &-uh I guess I could I don't know do you think it's like a
+, nope +/.
+, no ?
and that's the nice thing with the &~bu you know you can always look
&~y you can pretty much you know there's some
mhm I think <it's here> +/.
+, it's two sixty six at this point and where'd it go ?
chka@o chka@o chka@o chk@o chk@o right here it just says you know
but with history it's kinda weird even when you go to the thirty
you're interested in reading stuff carefully and writing ⌈ a_lot in

well it's like anything else if you +/.
+, just reading I mean &~i I've done political science Compar Pol do
it's gonna be like political science .
reading and writing .
right reading and writing .
it's not gonna be like &-um the prebusiness courses <or the> or

these courses are they designed to be like +/.

+, ⌈ absolutely ⌉ .
+, ⌊ weed out students or what ⌋ ?
I mean I keep wondering .

⌊ right &~s ⌋ so there's no sort_of weeding agenda but , I'll be

you need to you ⌈ need to you know <if it's> if it's

quite &~comforta I mean that's the only class I got an A in this

so organizational studies might be a nice complement for you
economics is a social science but it's more quantitative .
I mean that could be a good balance I mean I think you should think

⌊ what have you had ⌋ ?
in natural science ?
mhm +/.
+, chemistry does that count as natural science ?
yes anything else ?
chemistry and &-um I guess that's it .
then the answer is no .
how many credits do I need ?
you need seven credits of natural science so you'd need four more
&~ehhh Engineering one oh one ?
it's it's not an L_S_And_A class .
Computer Science one eighty three ?
mathematics and symbolic analysis &=laughs .
&-um taken something in natural science .
I I think you might need to take another natural science .
I keep that up for some time later maybe .
yeah .
pretty sure I've done one more course .
did you take physics ?
no .
⌈ I haven't ⌉ .

don't you think that will be too much of_course load four oh
it's like a little bit very spread out I mean &-um I think it's
it's good to have something a little different it's up to you I
but again it's a different way of of looking .
you could get an astronomy lab .
it would be your only lab course you can go look at the stars it

I think I'd rather speak anyway .

we would only even hafta think about it as a throwaway credit if

did you have the +...
so you need the chem ?
<you need> you need analytical chem ?
yes I need that +/.

I'm probably taking that next year I'm guessing .

okay .
you can have some fun you can take extra chem even .
yeah +/.

uhuh before ⌈ I graduate ⌉ .

so when you do your senior audit just bring all that stuff in .

+, okay +/.

okay what +//.
I didn't +//.
what is that ?
&-um basically you're gonna talk to biochem

alright okay .
&-um and I have one more question .

if I should take it over ?

the problem was just the time .

+, well &~a as far as well in other classes like &~wh what is the
well for the business school &~th &~i &~G GPAs are usually between
like a three +/.

⌈ right ⌉ .
&=laughs ⌊ well to me that's good ⌋ .
⌈ well .
like that you know that's ⌉ right but that's doing doing &~w so
doing well is like a B b@l minus I mean .
okay well +/.

⌊ okay solid ⌋ .

you know b@l minus c@l plus is kinda average .
I don't know what happened but you know C is you know you're like
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um that's below average whereas you know in the old world
&-um but the thing to consider is dropping Math one oh
+, ⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ semester ⌉ .
sticking with it and not doing well would mean that you'd have
what other courses are you taking ?
&-um currently ?
yeah .
English &-uh God what is it it's an English class that doesn't
it ⌊ doesn't fulfill the freshman ⌋ +/.
⌈ so it's a first year seminar ⌉ in English ?
no it's +/.

with &-um Herman Elmwood ?
yes .
okay .
you were a late orientee weren't you ?
I saw you at the end of August okay .
yeah yeah okay .
&=laughs:S2 I though it would be good practice but you know the

⌈ but he doesn't really critique them you know he just ⌉ it's just

&=laughs you know I like I did my reading and everything but I
but &-um see ⌊ in English ⌋ .
⌈ &~ho ⌉ how did you do on the midterm ?
I got a c@l plus .
that's okay mhm +/.

no this is the Problems of Philosophy .

two thirty two .
&-um and in that class I'm doing alright I think <I got> I got

+, yeah okay +/.
+, anthropology I'm doing well .
yeah you're doing pretty +/.
⌊ so ⌋ +/.

it's just math like if +//.
you know I &~thi see like that's the thing .
like I'd hate to stick with this get like a c@l plus on the midterm

question if you were to +/.
that stinks +/.
+, drop math would you be able to spend +//.
do you feel like you're spending so much time on math that it's

well if I had done this all along then I'd &~h probably answer
<I don't> I don't know I don't think so .
okay .
+, like .
so you feel like if you were to stick with the math and keep trying
&~B &+p b@l minus c@l plus on the final in_order_to ?
yeah most likely a B b@l minus really .
and you +//.
do you have a tutor ?
are you going to +//.
how how are you +//.
well +/.
+, you're working with a friend you're doing homework with your
right I'm doing homework with my friend but to study for the test
yes <even if you> +/.
+, and I'm not sure the best way to do it .
like I mean I'd probably have to like go to that engineering
the Tau Beta Pi ?
yeah .
those are nice people actually I've heard real good +/.
⌈ and like ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ feedback ⌋ about them they're they're really into tutoring
+, okay +/.
+, not snotty .
I guess <I could> like go back and do like the review problems
yeah +...
just <try &~no> it's just one of those things I can't make the
⌈ yeah <I know> <I know that> I know that ⌉ .

⌈ and so I guess if you have the ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you know it's like ⌋ it's a catch_twenty_two .
if you have the energy and math is not sucking you dry you know
occasionally I'll talk to somebody ⌈ and they're they're saying

yeah no <I don't> I don't think so .
and that you can get +//.
<and I> and I think if you get a C in this class it's
⌈ and as far as ⌉ a c@l minus though ?
again if you do well in economics and Math one fifteen you know
and that might even be something that you'd want to address in your
mhm +/.

&=laughs:S4 you know ?
oh quite a bit .
&=laughs but that +//.
you know what I'm saying +/.
yeah +/.
+, I mean a_lot_of it of_course if you get a c@l minus in Math one
+, right +/.
+, I've actually asked the Business School advisor this before
and the Business School would rather see somebody like struggle
+, right +/.
+, you know I think if you're failing if you have a thirty three
+, mhm +/.
+, all the next homeworks they're not even collecting them but the
+, mhm +/.
+, but it seems like the goals that you're setting for yourself
+, mhm +...
okay +/.
+, and that you I'm just it's just one of those things +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, I can't really I mean +/.
+, ⌊ yeah I know I I understand .
I understand ⌋ .
+, ⌈ if you wanna drop it you can ⌉ .
&-um but it also sounds like this is something that you could
+, yeah &=laughs +/.
+, if you have the time I mean it's gonna take a commitment from
+, yeah +/.
+, tests +...
+, okay +/.
+, (be)cause then we know what will happen .
+, yeah &=laughs +/.
+, and then you should probably drop it so if you think you can't
no I mean I think I could do better (0.4) yeah I &~th I don't
&=laughs let's see I mean I I think I could do better I just
⌊ it's hard ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ and review ⌉ +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, the stuff from the ⌊ first chapter ⌋ .
⌈ but &~r ⌉ and also really systematically .
mhm +/.
+, so I don't know if your friend is into reviewing with you +/.
+, right +/.
+, and setting aside time each week but that's actually what they
but rather doing all the problem sets and reviewing the problem
sort of consistently to make sure that you know you're still
let me see if I have my little study strategies paper .
is this it ?
taking exams that's not it +...
this is it problem sets yeah .
little written on but still good I'll give it to you I'm sure we
but they talk about you know studying for mathematics .
this is written by kind of smart+alecky graduate students .
it's got kind_of a humorous tone but you know counselors often hear
+" well you know I kind of understood the basic concepts but I had
is usually what they say +".
+, <oh yeah> +/.
+, and what they recommend is do all of the assigned problems .
not once but three times so they're encouraging you to be obsessive
+, oh wow .
+, and they tell you how to do it ⌊ three times ⌋ .
⌈ what do you mean ⌉ like all the assigned problems you mean like ⌊
⌈ all of the ⌉ homework .
mhm .
so every time you do homework you should do it three times ?
yeah but not necessarily three times in a row .
first +/.
⌊ oh ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ you ⌉ know first yes you read the chapters in your textbook as
right ?
(be)cause then you know right off the bat that if you can do all
+, mhm +/.
+, if right after you've gotten the reading you do the problems
and at that point to get you know they say go talk to your
&=laughs do it now before you move on to another topic &=laughs and
and that's what's happening with you is you're saying +"/.
+" okay I need to go back to the beginning and figure out what
+, mhm +/.
+, I've missed .
okay and then they have their little don't worry you know don't
you know set it aside so you can review it .
&-um and then this +//.
they say this and this is probably something that you should do
(be)cause I don't think you should try to go back and redo it all
+, right no +/.
+, but if you could do like ⌊ a little bit of an old homework
⌈ like at the end of each like at the end of ⌉ each week just do
right and since you missed some stuff you might wanna do all the
yeah +/.
+, something that you didn't understand .
+, right +/.
+, but maybe just one thing that you didn't understand like don't
&-um and then they do say review it .
so &~af so when you're not doing your homework set aside time
just to make sure that you're still understanding what you did and
like I'm not very good at math and whenever this would happen
⌋ .
⌈ right yeah yeah ⌉ I &~g I have that ⌊ problem ⌋ .
&-um so they recommend sort_of keeping it fresh in your mind +/.
mhm +/.
+, so that you don't run into that on the exam where you're just
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um and then they say a week or so before the test and I think
go through everything .
just do &~proo and they they they have a little system like don't redo
and basically you know what <you remember> you remember , what
+, mhm +/.
+, look at .
and I don't know if that boils it down but I kinda .
⌈ no no that helps yeah that very helps that helps a_lot ⌉ .
⌊ like their tone and I think you should ⌋ if you're gonna
oh I plan to &=laughs:multiple now I don't have ⌈ much of a choice
⌊ because you know there's there's ⌋ no guarantee of anybody
right +/.
+, but certainly if if he sees ⌈ you're putting forth a valiant

+, ⌈ yeah maybe ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ a little bit of flexibility if he can tweak you up ⌋ a little
+, yeah +/.
+, &~y you know he might .
they won't ever tweak you down unless you blow off a_lot_of classes
+, right +/.
+, but &-um and <he's not> &~obli he's not obligated to +/.
+, ⌈ right no I I understand that ⌉ .
+, ⌊ boost you but ⌋ often with the +//.
the math GSIs will because I mean they know that this stuff does
+, yeah +/.
+, and it's different to see a student who's a C student .
now after you take that final exam and you get the grade back
can &~y is there still time to talk to the GSI ?
or no ?
like I mean like what I'm saying is like you know like <let's say>
like like I'm talking &=gesturing you know what I mean ?
mhm +/.
+, like is there still a chance to like kinda just ask him ?
to what end ?
to ask him to bump you up ?
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-um ⌋ I I wouldn't +/.
+, ⌈ oh no ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ do that ⌋ because +/.
+, okay +/.
+, I mean you're not really asking for a &~g +//.
I_mean if you have a grade grievance you feel like they graded you
+, mhm +/.
+, but .
right ⌈ I understand ⌉ .
⌊ I mean if ⌋ you're just gonna come in and say well you know can
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ honest with you ⌋ as a GSI <I figure if you> wanna do that
&=motioning_to_passerby hey there +...
⌈ you know what I'm saying ⌉ ?
⌊ yeah I know I hear ⌋ yeah &=laughs:multiple .
so you should have some sort of +//.
⌈ right that makes sense ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I think the time ⌋ to talk to the GSI is now while you +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ can ⌋ still raise your grade .
after the fact if you're confused about what grade you got and you
but &-um no no a simple would you mind giving me a b@l minus .
⌈ right no I know yeah yeah yeah there's no way I understand ⌉ .
⌊ rather than a c@l plus that won't fly ⌋ .
and I remember even as an Intro Comp teacher I had people say +"/.
+" I really need a a@l minus (be)cause I'm going into the

+, ⌊ them in class and stuff ⌋ you know they're not gonna
+, right +/.
+, yeah so you need to take control of what you can control .
+, right +/.
+, and it sounds like you can control how you're studying for the
okay .
and if you need to get a tutor that's another option although
I don't know we'll see &=laughs but +/.
I mean +/.
+, okay .
yeah no this helps .
you sure ?
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ I mean I didn't mean to I got a little promath@n$adj I
yeah <no no> no no no .
when you said that you didn't think that it would be too
⌈ no <I don't> I don't think so I think I could I mean I think

I I'd rather see +//.
I think educationally it would be ⌋ better for you to struggle
&=laughs .
well no because I mean I don't (be)cause the problem is is
right +/.
+, yeah .
right .
I mean like I mean (be)cause I did a_lot better on the second
I failed the second test +/.
mhm +/.
+, I got like &~i if you took it just out_of like a raw
no curve I did +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, I did you know I did bad .
but because there was a curve and everybody else did bad I didn't
+, mhm +/.
+, as bad .
+, yeah +/.
+, but .
well that's something to be said for that .
I_mean you're in a class with other first year students who're all
right +/.
+, and I think you know if you get better with each progressive
+, mhm +/.
+, sort_of healthy adapting .
(0.4) .
okay .
&-um so if you decide to drop the class the last day to drop it is
right .
did I give you a drop form ?
when I saw you ⌈ last ⌉ ?
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
okay so you have that +/.
mhm +/.
+, &-um you know so if that's the decision you make that's your
it's your decision to make +/.
+, ⌈ right right no I I know ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I can't make that for you ⌋ .
&-um if you do decide to stick with the class I would you know
+, mhm +/.
+, and do some of the old stuff that you're a little fuzzy on
coasting on the joys of being here &=laughs:multiple .
yeah but &-um and then the other question I had since you
uhuh +/.
+, what is the best way to +//.
(be)cause like like at the end of my English class you know he
+, mhm +/.
+, and I just look at him like +"/.
+" well what do you mean ?
you know I just like I've always +//.
how do +//.
like I always kinda just read to read but how do I get something
if you know what I'm saying .
&-um well I mean there's lots_of different things that you can ask
and it's gonna +/.
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &~be ⌋ depend on your you know you could ask about plot
you know what was the author trying to say ?
often when I'm teaching writing and I +//.
if I'm doing &-um English one twenty four which is writing about

and poetry and essays as arguments you know +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, what's +//.
like give me an example of a book that you read .
&-um like we're currently reading The Stranger .
okay .
okay so you got Meraud or Mersault or whatever his name is Mersault
⌈ yes it's about that ⌉ .
+, ⌊ Mersault right yes ⌋ and he's killed his mother but he seems
we're supposed to sort_of .
yeah yeah +/.

+, like they got into a fight and this friend it was his

mkay what you might want to do in that book I mean it's written
yeah +/.
+, so it's +/.
+, ⌈ I think so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ kind of you +//.
⌋ we're inside his head .
+, yeah +/.
+, and I guess you know one question that you might want to ask is
I mean there's a whole bunch of questions you can ask .
I remember the mother for some reason he has like sort_of a weird
+, ⌊ maybe ⌋ I don't know +/.
+, okay &-um but you know I would just you know what does it
like you know can we figure out what else is happening in the book
does the narrator give us any other clues ?
how do we find out about the murder ?
+, mhm +/.
+, is he remorseful about this murder ?
+, I'm not ⌈ sure I remember ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ if not why ⌋ ?
what's Camus trying to say ?
that kinda stuff like I +//.
+, uhuh +/.
+, as a teacher I would always sort_of ask those kinds of
and I guess you know for something like like &-um Camus it's a
you could just ask a plot question .
I'm just confused about what happened here ?
+, mhm +/.
+, like like I don't know I was just like ⌈ xxx real quick ⌉
+, ⌊ a symbolism ⌋ question what do you think you know .
I don't know he said like you know like read and take notes but how
well there's a_lot_of different levels on which you can
there's sort_of the basic plot +/.
uhuh +/.
+, right ?
right .
what happens to who where when why the journalistic kinda you know
and I think with novels that are written in stream of consciousness
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you know ⌋ ?
&-um and then &-um then what ?
&-um you could also you could ask about character development like
who are these people ?
do I like them ?
are they like me ?
are they not like me ?
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um I did a_lot_of political criticism .
like I often just was sort_of interested in you know how was
I_mean there's lots_of different themes thematic things what is
&~C Camus is just +//.
it's been so long it's just not one of the ones that I would be
+, mhm +/.
+, what is the writer saying about this community ?
+, mhm +/.
+, you know do the characters come together ?
do they not come together ?
you know am I making sense ?
+, ⌈ yeah I think so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I'm kinda being vague ⌋ .
Camus is not my strong ⌈ point you know ⌉ .
⌊ I know well I mean like ⌋ we read like you know Light in &~Au +/.
oh Light &~o ⌈ Faulkner okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ Light in August ⌋ or we read &-uh you_know ⌈ A Farewell to

+, ⌊ with &-um ⌋ the pregnant woman walking through town and Joe
+, yeah +/.
+, okay so you have all this this Christ imagery going on in
+, ⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.

are these people good Christians ?
right that the &~pregn she's like nine months pregnant all the
+, mhm +/.
+, but you know are these people waiting for something ?
they kind of are you got your Christmas you got this very pregnant
is there a sense of hope here ?
you know just +//.
these are just the questions that I'm remembering from the book but
and and just questions of imagery what's he doing with the idea
what's happening with children ?
I think there was lot of orphans a_lot_of ⌈ neglected children in

anything well whatever interests you +/.

like you know I'll be like I'll read a book I'll be like oh okay

+, I don't think you would be the &=laughs +/.
+, well right ⌈ that would be ⌉ +/.

but that's one reason why you talk about it with other people is
+, mhm +/.
+, you know ?
&-um and with the Grapes of Wrath there's you know a_lot_of
&-um and one of the nice things about that book is it's a &~fair
they kinda hit you over the head with it .
I remember the turtle crossing the road there +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, I haven't you know I haven't read that book since I was like in
+, mhm +/.

I_mean it's a shame if you plan on selling them back you know
uhuh +/.
+, but I always write in my books and keep them as long as I want .
but you just think about the different characters you know if
those are always good starting points you know (be)cause initially
you know you can't really write a whole essay on on that
but then you can begin to and you know so you say okay that's
+, uhuh +/.

how is this character connected to and that +//.
those kinda end up being essay questions often how is this

⌊ ever ⌋ +/.

+, right +/.

I mean they'd like you to go to them because you're signing up

&-um they have special CSP sections basically and they're not
it's the twelfth .
+, hm +/.
+, and that's pretty much it unless you want more information
on their study +//.
and then you can give them your address .
+, nah thanks +/.
+, &-um but the way the CSP sections work is I think math chemistry
there're special CSP sections for each .
what's the difference between CSP Math and regular math ?
the only difference is that CSP Math meets one time a week more
so that there's more support there's more academic support
and as a CSP student or CSP affiliate whether you're actually
because especially if they're premed or they're taking ⌊ <like
⌈ but ⌉ they learn the same things .
of_course .
yes .
actually do <I have> I have a CSP ooh look at this I have a CSP
but we'll ignore the note from Manda (be)cause I know she won't
&-um but they just tell you the courses intensive course
and you have a regular assigned advisor who you're supposed to meet
if you don't ⌊ what happens ?
nothing ⌋ ?
⌈ but that's it ⌉ no nothing nothing really I mean I
I mean they prefer +//.
who is your CSP advisor ?

⌈ I've never met her ⌉ .
well you might wanna meet her before you blow her off .
&=laughs you know she's pretty nice .
but I know from my end like if a student doesn't really care for me
it's better if they just go find somebody they do like and see them
you know you're getting your questions answered .
&-um but <the only> the only difference between CSP sections
they tend to be smaller and there's more homework more quizzes
it's <it's a> it's a more intensive support situation so

you're getting a_lot_of feedback in CSP .

⌈ (be)cause you're a freshman ⌉ (be)cause the seniors go first and

⌈ so what time ⌉ do I go ?
they told it to you in the email did you save your email ?

⌊ anytime ⌋ .

&-um if you liked it you know so you should go with what you

you'd be working with a graduate student if you took this English

&-um if you wanted to teach &-um to be a professor of English
you would have to do a PhD in English which is a longer degree

unhunh they just work with older students .
no way .
starting salary for a professor is probably about the same as

yeah mhm .
shoot that just ⌊ ruined my chances ⌋ .
⌈ you know a_lot_of it's ⌉ gonna be just about your your your

I'm like come on you guys you know I just +//.
it's just not a personal strength of mine .

&=laughs:S5 you're looking for an academic job right and &-um
usually you're an assistant professor for six years .
&~aft and you have to write a_couple_of books in that time if you
if you perform well and they like everything that you've done you
you're given the title associate professor <and tenure> and

and then if you continue to publish and be professionally active as

we can probably rip a little corner off of there I can give you

it's at Tuesday the seventeenth at five o'clock at Career Planning

maybe I'll take biology or something .
yeah .
I don't see why I mean in something fun .

there's a_lot_of biology for nonscience majors there's about

I'm happy to talk to you before your classes if you want .
thanks .
okay who's next victim ?

okay .
I told her already so .
okay she's good Yasmin ?
yeah .
that's right .
yay &=laughs:multiple is it Yasmin Hasan ?
I'm so tired +/.
yep +/.
+, I know you were one of my orientees +...
alright okay .
I have a question like you gave me this form when +//.
I'll have to ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ oh I thought you +//.
you got it already ?
oh okay you know you can do that like right ⌉ .

yeah you gave me this when &~f when I was at orientation .
⌈ thinking about Pharmacy School ⌉ yeah .
⌊ about the Pharmacy School ⌋ and they have this whole thing
mhm +/.
+, for the two +//.
first two years +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and stuff like ⌋ that .
term one term two ⌈ term three term four ⌉ .
⌊ yeah and ⌋ +/.
yep +/.
+, so I already took Chemistry one twenty five and one thirty like
+, yeah +/.
+, what they're asking for .
so I'm just wondering like Orgo should I take it this
that's what I'm ⌈ having trouble with ⌉ .
⌊ you know it's up to you ⌋ .
because basically they're changing &-um I can't even talk
I take English too .
and you have English already oh you're such a good girl .
you need the biology +/.
right +/.
+, and that's a +//.
it's a five credit class now they've changed the biology curriculum
+, uhuh +/.
+, they've combined the two semesters of biology into one semester
&-um ⌈ and I guess ⌉ .
⌊ <is that> is that ⌋ this one right there ⌈ one fifty +//.
oh okay ⌉ .
⌊ yep yep now it's ⌋ but now it's this and this is +/.
one sixty two +/.
+, it hasn't +//.
the course guide doesn't even really &~r well the course guide
+, oh okay +/.
I mean so I would definitely sort_of take this and then some
&-um I guess my question for you is how are you enjoying Chem one
are you finding it a difficult course ?
it's fine .
I mean it's not ⌈ that difficult ⌉ .
⌊ it's not a problem ⌋ ?
nope .
&-um I mean if you want to there's absolutely no reason why not to
mm +/.
+, that you'd have two labs if you take biology and chem .
well it +//.
I would have +/.
⌈ you know ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ two labs ⌋ anyways if I did it next year (be)cause I would
physics anyway +/.
right +/.
+, right so I guess that that's part of the I mean I don't
+, any ⌈ problem ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ a ⌋ reason not to except if you would find it too difficult .
or like some people were talking about like you take the
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ or whatever ⌋ you take the second part of it .
⌈ mhm you can do that ⌉ .
⌊ (be)cause it is offered but ⌋ if I didn't want to take it
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ maybe ⌋ Wayne State or something if they offered it +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, is that like a good thing for that credit to be
well the nice thing about taking it at Dearborn is your grade would
okay +/.
+, if you took it at Wayne you'd just get the credit .
&-um I don't think it matters so much .
it doesn't ?
unhunh I mean it's one of +//.
if it's easier for you to take it closer to home +/.
right ⌈ instead of coming here ⌉ +/.
+, over the summer I mean that's fine +/.
+, okay +/.
+, if that's how you wanna spend your spring half term that's
if the spring half term would that +//.
I mean I could finish the +//.
all of the rest of the ⌊ chemistry ⌋ ?
⌈ indeed ⌉ <you could> you could be if you keep going at
or if like if I left chemistry for next year and did physics
mhm +/.
+, could I take physics during the or like could I take +/.
+, ⌊ that would count ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ all the &~phys ⌉ physics during &~sum spring summer term ?
in like Dearborn or something ?
you could but you might run the risk of burnout .
are you trying to hurry through ?
I guess I ⌊ don't understand what you're ⌋ .
⌈ oh no I'm not I'm just &~wa ⌉ because I don't wanna take chemistry
okay so what +//.
maybe what you want to do then is to start chemistry +...
in the winter +/.
okay +/.
+, and then you could finish it up in the spring term and then just
+, mhm +/.
+, physics ⌊ next year ⌋ .
⌈ physics during ⌉ next year ?
if that works .
I mean you need to be feeling comfortable is the reason you don't
yeah (be)cause I'm not good at physics ⌊ at all so ⌋ .
⌈ okay so ⌉ it's physics is the area of concern +/.
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so that ⌉ should be the course that you take without taking
right +/.
+, okay +/.
+, so <your thinking> your thinking is very clear +/.
+, okay +/.
+, that makes sense .
so but like I can take it at a different school like when would I
&-um usually around March .
March ?
yeah .
like do I have to apply to the school and stuff like that ?
I +//.
over .
usually yes .
because I I mean I applied before but do <I have to> I
it's a different kind of application +/.
⌊ oh ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ you ⌉ would apply to be a not for degree student .
+, okay +/.
+, you're basically just dropping through you're just visiting .
+, visiting ⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ happening ⌉ to take the second half of Organic Chemistry thank
+, okay +/.
+, so what you do is you end up filling out an application to be a
+, mhm +/.
+, so you're not really applying for admission to Wayne State .
+, uhuh +/.
+, (be)cause if you were to do that you'd be applying to be you
+, right +/.
+, four year degree I want my Bachelor of Science at the end of
+, right +/.
+, you're just wanting to take the one class and it's it's a
or even if I like at OU ?
I mean that's like +/.
same difference .
+, five minutes away from my house if I took physics there if I
+, mhm +/.
+, would the grade be transferrable here ?
(be)cause doesn't +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, like Pharmacy don't they need the &~d grade also ?
well the grade wouldn't transfer here but if you took physics at OU
it would just be on a transcript from Oakland University .
mhm +/.
+, right and if you look at who transfers to U_Of_M they say like
okay forty three percent of the people who are currently in their
forty five percent of +//.
completed their prepharmacy work at another four year college
so it's not like they discriminate against people who take courses
+, mhm +/.
+, outside U_Of_M than inside U_Of_M apparently and twelve percent
+, community college okay +/.
+, so even then <more than> more than ten percent of the people
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so I think ⌉ they're looking for a variety of things .
&-um so you know it's good you're a woman you're a Michigan
+, ⌊ so I can really just xxx ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ a minority from a ⌉ minority group you know as long as you
+, right +/.
+, &-um so they don't really care where you nail it +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ as long ⌉ as you're +//.
you know if you get c@l minus in chemistry not that good .
&-um I &~g I guess you have some you know +//.
it's up to you .
I can't tell you whether it's better to take biology and physics
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ physics ⌉ is a two hour lab .
+, uhuh +/.
+, so that actually biology and +/.
+, ⌊ physics ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ physics ⌉ together might be less overwhelming (be)cause that's
oh so I could take physics next term ⌊ and then just take
⌈ you could do that and then take chemistry next ⌉ year .
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ that ⌉ would work .
and physics is also a universal curriculum it's +//.
it always comes in as physics .
it never comes in as physics departmental credit .
it always comes in as either Physics one twenty five one twenty
right .
⌊ and that's a good sign ⌋ .
⌈ and then like for ⌉ my electives I could just take anything I
whatever makes you ⌊ happy ⌋ .
⌈ because like ⌉ <do I have to> do I have to still &~f
if you transfer to Pharmacy in your junior year no .
no ?
okay +/.
⌊ if ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ but if ⌉ if there's that chance that I don't get in +/.
+, right +/.
+, the Pharmacy school then ⌊ but I still got two years to do
then ⌈ you and you if you wanted to get a ⌉ Bachelor of Science
⌊ but then I I still have two years right ⌋ ?
⌈ and you still have two years .
right ⌉ .
⌊ okay ⌋ .
⌈ and Pharmacy's ⌉ &-uh distribution requirements seem pretty
⌊ right uhuh ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ L_S_And_A's ⌉ they want two courses in the humanities or
+, right +/.
+, so .
and &-um there is also like +//.
remember I said I was like wasn't sure about computer sci
mhm +/.
+, and it says that like people considering pharmacy should

+, ⌈ just ⌉ in case .
right .
and you'd wanna consider +/.
⌊ computer science ⌋ .
+, ⌈ computer science ⌉ ?
okay .
so like I I don't know what classes I would take for that .
&-um I can actually tell you what you should take for that then .
although what happens then is you're gonna end up with four really
okay +/.
+, and then I wouldn't take the physics with the biology .
but +/.
+, ⌈ in like ⌉ in the spring summer can I do that like if I took
+, mhm +/.

well you can't take a computer class somewhere else if you're gonna

+, just as I said physics comes in always comes in as like the
+, right +/.
+, computer science always comes in as the wrong computer science
+, oh okay +/.
+, I have enough experience seeing &~p kids go +"/.
+" oh but I thought +...
okay for computer science what you wanna be aware of is for
so that next semester +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, you would need to take Calc Two .
I'm in Calc Two .
next semester you take +/.
⌊ Calc Three okay ⌋ &=laughs +/.
+, so I mean that kind of tells you what you would need .
&-um and they tell you the prerequisites so you have +//.
you'll have at the end of next semester you'll have all the math
&-um and then there's Computer Science one hundred two eighty and
+, okay +/.
+, &-uh these are the prerequisites .
the physics kind_of overlaps .
they want you to have two courses in natural science and
+, ⌈ I already have that ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ prepharmacy ⌋ that will make you do that .
+, okay +/.
+, &-um so I guess my concern would just be if you were to take
if like if I just ⌈ went according ⌉ +/.
⌊ it's very difficult ⌋ +/.
+, yeah if I &~we just went according to this or something +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, and like whatever I didn't get into Pharmacy whatever +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, changed my mind went to computer science .
would I still have enough time ?
to finish all that ?
yes .
⌈ because ⌉ .
⌊ like I'd ⌋ I'd be starting from like zero you know like .
no you wouldn't .
&~fr I mean like the computer science +/.
right +/.
+, courses .
&-um you would be starting the computer science courses from zero .
&~y and you mean your junior year you wouldn't have had any computer
somewhere along the way okay .
yes but you would need to +//.
so you might want to for example maybe rather than throwing the
and &~com +/.
+, mathematics and +/.
+, ⌈ computer science ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ computer science ⌋ and then an elective which was a social
+, okay +/.
+, for balance do you know what I'm saying ?
yeah I understand okay .
but I wouldn't do biology physics computer science .
no no &=laughs:S6 okay I understand .
&-uh but Math one sixteen's going fine it's not .
Math one sixteen is killing me I am +/.
⌈ it is killing you so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ am like ⌋ I am like not doing good at it at all .
+, okay so actually +/.
+, in that class .
and I don't know why (be)cause I I thought I knew it but I
okay and when you say killing you what do you mean ?
like I'm getting like a I think a low C ⌈ or D ⌉ .
⌊ killing you okay ⌋ you mean harsh +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ .
&-um I would maybe not necessarily want to go on to two fifteen
+, right +/.
+, I mean and I guess I would wonder it just +//.
it would be difficult for &~y ⌈ these are really difficult courses ⌉
⌊ see I that's what I don't know like if I need two fifteen like ⌋
I know +/.
+, so I'm ⌈ just having a hard ⌉ .
⌊ well if you do ⌋ computer science you will need two fifteen .
the pharmacy and the computer science degrees together are very
what you might want to think about is for example the pharmacy
mhm +...
so consider something in .
or you know I mean you you're very nicely set up for biology
&=laughs:multiple .
just not computer science .
correct .
okay I see .
so if you like biology or you like chemistry +/.
mhm +/.
