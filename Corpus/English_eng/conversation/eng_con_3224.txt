let's look at what I, uh, what kind of demand capacity ratios I got
using these people's criteria . 8535_10453
okay, now we're not using UBC criteria . 10453_13032
we're ⌈using this criteria . 13032_14144
⌊no, no right yeh . 14144_14785
and uh, for example if we could look at one of the plans . 14785_18039
which one's on top ? 18039_19819
this is Temescal . 19819_21543
(2.5) you can write on this if you want to . 21543_25222
now (1.) this is for seismic forces in this direction &=1 . 25222_30134
this &=2 is the critical wall . 30134_32221
and I'm getting demand capacity ratios of one point five . 32221_37628
hmmm . 37628_38893
and, uh, one point one, ok ? 38893_42173
and so, uh this wall &=1 is seriously overstressed . 42173_47685
we need to do something to that wall . 47685_50005
in ⌈plane ? 50005_51045
⌊in plane . 51045_51596
that is based on (1.) these walls &=1 helping you or not helping
its based on only using this wall &=1 and this wall &=2 , because
um hm . 70115_71300
uh (1.) so if I look at forces in this direction &=1 well now we've
+^ um hm . 86617_87592
+^ alright . 87592_87806
+^ um hm . 87806_88334
and my calculations are relatively approximate right now, okay
uh (1.) but uh, so, what do we do to strengthen this building ? 91990_98902
now we're not &~e &~y and we're &~l, aiming at the general procedure .
well it seems to me that if we put (1.) a seismic resisting element
+^ mm hmm . 115689_116109
+^ mm hmm . 116109_116461
we can &=1 (1.) take force off of this wall &=2 . 116461_121024
then we would reanalyze that wall using the, the +... 121024_125248
mm hmm &=1 . 125248_126685
uh, &=1 &~thi this code and uh, I suspect that the demand capacities
what do we +...
what ⌈do we want to be below one ?
⌊oh, okay .
we want them ⌈to be below one .
⌊Yeah .
⌈so the demand is not greater .
⌊ xxx .
than the capacity .
⌈so that's where the one .
⌊Ok .
⌈ratio if it equals capacity its one, if its greater, yeh &=creaky
⌊ xxx .
this would also, assist in the floor &=1 diaphram .
this &=1 one .
mm hmm .
I haven't gotten to the point .
I'm <right on the verge of it> , of looking at that
mm hm .
uh, somehow I think it just might work .
uh, so right now that is, that conceptually is my scheme for this
mm hmm
