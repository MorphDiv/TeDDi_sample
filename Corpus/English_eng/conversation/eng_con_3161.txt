turn to the left . 670_1450
two fourths . 1740_2220
turn it to the left . 2510_3310
two fourths one two . 3660_6110
okay . 9990_10220
wait . 10380_10480
I have to write that one down . 10720_11780
four . 13390_13520
up down flips . 14760_15820
then . 21750_21990
turn . 24070_24240
yeah . 28420_28510
Amanda you have to . 28640_29380
okay . 38950_39150
Amanda . 39620_40020
it starts like this . 40660_42430
four f . 48590_49050
four f down flips . 52100_53030
okay . 53910_54020
I need to move it over here to flip it . 54240_55600
I can't reach that far and flip it . 55870_57060
so here's how it started . 57080_58060
one two three four . 60380_64860
down . 67030_67260
that's five down up down flips . 69140_71020
down . 71490_71600
&-um gotta tell me right or left . 72700_74100
turn it left . 75990_76630
how much turn it left . 76940_80260
one fourth . 80740_81310
oh oh I'm sorry . 82510_83140
I went right . 83160_83550
I went right turn left one fourth . 83680_85900
left . 88420_88550
okay . 89520_89630
so it would be five up down flips . 90690_93630
and then flipping it to the left a sideways flip . 94100_96820
okay . 96960_97110
I need to start it in the original position . 97200_98710
so we make sure we do exactly the moves you set . 98870_100870
one two three . 101620_104220
four . 105310_105550
five up down flips . 106510_107860
and then flip it to the left . 108550_109780
did she do it . 111340_111990
yes . 112500_112530
congratulations . 113420_114350
Amanda . 114460_114760
I down flip . 117330_117830
then . 122110_122300
sideways but hands down . 123880_125380
everybody . 127190_127500
&-um I dunno . 128580_132230
let's see . 132280_132620
&-um . 132700_132870
how many up down flips . 137780_139720
does it take until to be just the same as not doing a flip . 139950_145510
at all any number . 146710_147110
any number . 148170_148470
no . 149070_149150
so if I do one up down flip on Katie's square it's gonna look just
no . 155550_155620
no . 155910_156010
a half of a a half of a flip . 156570_159080
can . 159190_159320
I do half of a flip . 159410_160350
no no . 161830_162280
Paul I need you to step Paul I want you to think about this that
how many up down flips . 175670_177190
could I do one Katie's Core Square Nathan you should be watching
could I do or should I do so that it will look exactly like it
now I'm if I do one up down here will it look the same . 190980_201910
&-um so how many should I do that . 207240_208900
I can get it looking exactly like it looks . 208920_210670
now this is Paul's question . 210910_214390
two . 215860_215920
two . 216460_216560
let's try it . 216930_217620
watch . 217730_218060
ly . 218710_218790
you have your number . 219470_219990
memorize . 220560_220740
Katie's four square . 221790_222620
this is what it looks like . 222640_223700
one two . 224740_226260
yep . 227290_227420
you know how I can tell . 228810_229300
it's in exactly the same position because . 229440_231190
it's two green triangles at this front . 231620_233260
yeah . 233470_233670
and there's her little x to mark the top left corner . 233820_236780
so I know this isn't the flip side . 236910_238320
so two up down flips gets it back right to where it started from .
zero zero flips . 244110_246310
zero flips ten . 247020_247860
not flipping it at all . 247900_248670
makes it look . 248720_249080
and four could go . 249780_250580
four . 250910_251120
let's try that . 251640_252100
and ten . 253060_253320
make it . 253990_254240
why would two four six eight and ten . 254620_256589
flip . 256910_257019
exactly same . 257820_258240
'cause &-um like one's amber . 258890_260820
so he just flipped it once . 262260_263550
and he did back so tried four times . 263660_267350
okay . 267900_268020
this is Katie's beginning position . 268720_270030
I checked in the x is in the top left . 270360_272180
Brian what do you think is gonna happen . 272400_274950
if I do an up down flip on this square four times . 275060_277600
I'm gonna flip it four times . 280110_281380
you're . 288530_288620
gonna do up down flips . 288680_289860
four of them watch what one up down flip . 290070_293580
makes it look like . 293600_294350
does it look the same or different . 296080_297420
okay . 297840_297980
all right . 298820_299030
but then instead_of just doing one flip I'm gonna try four flips .
do you think it will look the same . 303380_304310
or different . 305450_305750
one two three four . 309300_314040
&-um what do you think about this idea of Brittany's . 326010_328950
we keep adding on even numbers . 331180_333430
hold on a second . 333950_334710
I'm waiting . 335030_335350
I'm so glad you guys are thinking about Brittany's idea . 335690_338070
but not all of us are right now . 338140_339120
Nathan I would be sure you were listening to us and thinking about
if I saw you looking up here you have a question about Brittany's
can I tell the group what Brittany's idea is . 347040_348710
first . 348760_348880
and then let you ask her your question . 349160_350120
'cause some people might be sitting there going . 351030_353220
what is Brittany's idea . 353360_354260
Brittany's idea is that I could do any even number of flips on this
and she kept going wrong any even number of flips . 367100_370500
and it will always look the same . 370860_371790
three . 372490_372750
and then she said . 374780_375100
for you one's odd twos even threes odd fours . 375360_377980
even . 378000_378290
okay . 378650_378780
that's her idea . 378800_379540
Kevin has a question for you . 379830_381020
Brittany about your idea . 381280_382040
well you can go up beside the one by twos . 382510_385530
but if we go by one side this like on the other side by twos could
still be the same by two . 395330_398180
flip it two times . 401630_402370
so if I flip it two times what will happen . 402980_405080
Kevin it . 405440_405830
would be the same . 405880_406350
okay . 407280_407500
so you're saying I could do what Brittany was doing . 407660_409420
how by two is as high as I wanted . 409840_411390
I that number . 412860_414620
so no matter how big that Ember got . 423980_426470
if I was counting by twos if I stopped it that number . 426520_428270
and I really clicked it that many times . 428320_429830
it was looked just like this . 430320_431500
yeah . 431710_431780
well what_about five times . 432510_433700
it's it would be on the back side not the square . 435790_440800
so I'd be seeing the back side not the front side square like . 442200_444970
the flip side . 445460_445980
see the &-um . 446100_446630
let's try that and see one two three four five . 448140_456280
yeah . 458720_458810
and do you know how I can tell . 458860_459620
it's the flip side . 459740_460560
there's the . 462730_464060
in her beginning design . 469800_470880
yes . 471120_471320
she had the two greens on the top . 471360_472850
good job . 473340_473800
guys and ladies . 474650_475330
while we're &-um before we go to recess today what you're gonna get
'cause what are you gonna need to be flipping and turning today . 492710_494930
core squares . 495280_495840
Core squares . 495890_496450
your own core squares right . 496730_497920
making them into two by two designs . 499300_500900
and . 501520_501620
okay . 507140_507240
once you've used your four &-um like I'm gonna use where . 507730_511350
mine . 512730_512830
oh right here because 'cause I can't use Sarah Katie's gyms or ten
'cause right now some of theirs are saved to the board . 518490_519679
these are my four two-sided four squares . 520070_522169
then I use just samples . 522419_523190
if I'm going use these . 524100_525130
let's make a little circle here so that I can put my four squares
and you can see them . 529040_529730
it has to be a circle big enough for everybody . 531650_533570
but we just kind of wanna stretch together . 533680_535340
these are my four two sided four squares . 535970_539810
you need to make sure you can see them in the center . 540740_542720
oh that's a perfect spot . 543850_545460
okay . 546000_546150
so what did I make two by two design . 552610_556520
so if I did this at my seat I've used my two sided course spurs . 558540_562340
I made a two by two design . 563080_564220
what do I do . 564470_565070
next you can the . 565120_566070
