I'm gonna send out an email &-um I was looking to do it today but it might be tomorrow just to let you know general email but tomorrow at four thirty in Hale Auditorium there's gonna be the forty second annual business leadership awards ceremony . 12965_23545
that's four thirty in Hale . 23925_25445
Sam Zell of the Sam Zell and Robert Lurie Institute for &~en Entrepreneurial Studies will be presenting a section on &~entrepreneuria entrepreneurialship@n one oh one and &-um student government just wanted everyone to know about that and &-uh try to attend that . 25825_38625
so it's four thirty tomorrow in Hale Auditorium and &-um go check it out it should be very interesting . 38745_45025
it's the forty second annual leadership +//. 45405_48145
business leadership award . 48525_49085
thank you . 49385_49645
(0.5) .
&-uh okay before we get started today &-uh with a few announcements regarding class and also &-um &-uh &-uh the material we're gonna cover . 57275_65855
&-uh you'll notice there's some microphones here at the front of the room and that's because &-uh for today's class we're being &-uh taped for a &~veri very special project that's going on here at the University of Michigan . 66535_78035
it has nothing to do with your grades . 78395_80095
it has nothing to do with what's going on at the Business School . 80195_82315
it hasta do with a very special &~daya database &-um that they're putting together here . 82505_86825
and to tell you a little bit about that &-uh Janine is going to explain why &-uh we've been chosen to do this thing . 116225_117045
&=micase_recording_announcement .
just a few reminders . 237555_238555
due dates . 239135_239475
today by five PM your classified ads are due . 239895_242735
&-um the individual writing assignment is due Friday at five . 243315_246315
&-um couple of &~re &-uh responses to some questions I've gotten . 246715_250135
you can respond to the questions as questions or you could write your essay just responding to the three questions or you can put it together as an integrated essay without saying that this is the plot for one this is two and this is three . 250595_261895
so whichever one enables you to come up with the best argument how to make the best case for what you're arguing please follow that format . 262225_269305
whichever works best for you &-um the other thing is you can use materials through Wednesday's class . 269785_274305
so &-um and all of those topics are listed +//. 275405_278145
again you gotta be careful not +//. 278665_280225
you can't possibly use every single concept we've covered &-uh choose a select few that you want to use &-um that will enable you to &-uh make the best diagnosis and &-um and best plan of action . 280245_291805
another point of clarification in terms of write+ups of case questions you're given prep questions for every case we cover that's to help you prepare for class . 294585_303405
I don't expect those to be handed in except if I announce in advance that I want them alright ? 303885_308945
&~an and then you'll be given <your automatic> &-um your automatic credit for doing it if you turn them in . 309105_314245
we do highly suggest that you write them up for class it enables you to prepare you then have a record of the case for your notes for later when you go back to do assignments &-uh but for example today and Wednesday I do not expect you to hand in write+ups of the questions . 314705_329245
&-uh for next &~cla class we are going to be focusing on <Stripe and> Space okay ? 329825_334865
that's the case that I want you to focus on again there're prep questions for that then you may &~w wanna just jot this down on your syllabus pages sixty nine through seventy three <in the> in the Presiding Motivating Jobs that +//. 335385_347225
those are the pages you wanna focus on just skim the rest (be)cause we're gonna be focusing on the job characteristics model and also the Lawlor reading Choosing an Involvement Strategy . 347605_355965
so that's where you wanna focus your attention is on pages sixty nine through seventy three in the Involvement yeah ? 356465_361265
&-um as far as the writing assignment's concerned &-uh if we use like the course pack as sources do you want them documented ⌈ like ⌉ ? 361485_367325
⌊ no ⌋ you do not you do not have to give me &-um elaborate footnotes or a bibliography for what you use in your individual writing assignment . 367345_374145
but if you do use an article just put like the author's name in parentheses say where you're getting it from don't just say &-um as the course pack says I need to know where you're taking something from I don't need elaborate footnotes the key is to focus on the &-uh managerial diagnosis . 374585_390065
so focus on sixty nine through seventy three +... 391665_394265
so what are we gonna cover today ? 394625_398865
today's class is one of two on motivation . 398985_401645
we're going to &-uh look at motivation in the workplace . 401695_405275
&-uh today we're gonna look in particular at external sources of motivation that is what other than the content of the job can motivate people to do a good job at work and to deliver the sort_of performance you're looking for ? 406235_419795
Wednesday <we'll look a> &~mor we'll look more closely at how you can structure the content of tasks so that they're motivating . 420775_427215
we'll look at the internal components of the work for how you motivate . 427165_430665
&-um and I'm gonna introduce multiple frameworks many of which &~yo you read about for today and then we'll apply expectancy theory to the case of Hauser Foods . 431225_439325
so that's where we're going to &-um focus attention where I'd like to start though is on something that I think hits home which is grades right ? 440005_449665
if you think about money in the workplace grades is a little bit like the equivalent of that for students in a university and here are two points of view about the effectiveness of grades as a motivator David Reisman Ford Professor of Social Sciences Emeritus at Harvard University says &{l=READING when the freshman seminar program was inaugurated I was one of its chief defenders and argued successfully that it should be ungraded . 449665_472585
faculty members who opposed this said that without evaluations students would get by with shoddy work . 472995_478635
I didn't think so . 479155_479915
the freshman seminar and the senior thesis are the two great opportunities for Harvard students to really get engaged . 480275_485595
I sometimes ask an undergraduate did you take a freshman seminar ? 486075_489195
quite often the answer is no it's one less chance for an A . 489515_492595
&}l=READING so there's Reisman's point of view questioning the impact of grades and here's Robert Cole what he hasta say &-um after attending the University of Michigan &{l=READING Cole who attended the University of Michigan recalls his choice of a major . 493745_509345
in my first literature course in college I thought I'd written a damn good paper on Homer's Odyssey . 509885_514545
I got a c@l minus on my sixth paper I got an a@l minus and I was so proud of myself . 515045_519565
looking back I realize that the professor could've given me a@l-s on all six papers but if he'd done that I wouldn't (ha)ve studied literature . 519755_526595
I would have felt literature must be for idiots if I can spend three hours on a paper and get an a@l minus . 527075_531695
&}l=READING so there Cole's suggesting right that grades are in fact an effective motivator they get you to focus on the task at hand they've developed his love for literature whereas Reisman says oh you know grades really displace people's attention to this great opportunity to the freshman seminar so I'm curious what's your sense of grades ? 532545_552985
is there too much emphasis on grades here ? 553345_555145
or do you think that they're a critical motivator for learning ? 555665_558025
what's your sense ? 558505_559405
any opinions ? 560865_561405
any thoughts ? 561805_562765
Michael ? 562805_563065
&-um I think they're a good motivator I think it &-uh brings out competition in our environment and &-um pushes kids to like strive and be the best +/. 563285_572185
mhm +/.
+, you know without (th)em I would probably do like half as much . 572785_575765
mhm &~jus other thoughts ? 576005_579825
Melissa ? 579825_580065
&-um I think they're a really good motivator I was in the Residential College my first two years and I totally slacked off because we got evaluations and we didn't get grades . 580865_589925
&~d does everybody know what goes on in in the RC ? 590345_592165
&~wh why don't you explain a little bit . 592625_593905
you just get pass fail and then you get a little written explanation as to what you do in the class and then how you personally perform in there . 594185_603325
so I personally like totally slacked off because I knew I wasn't getting a grade in the course . 604505_609645
so +/.
+, <we we> +/.
+, ⌊ good ⌋ like points of view here that say yeah they're they're a crucial motivator . 613165_617265
Emily ?
&-um I think it really &~depen depends on the individual because I know for me &-um I like to learn just to learn ⌈ and ⌉ +/. 618625_626305
⌊ uhuh ⌋ +/.
+, I get pleasure out_of that and so when there's grades and that puts a_lot_of &-um it puts a_lot_of pressure that I don't need and I think it detracts from learning sometimes so I think it really depends on whether you're already a very motivated individual or whether you need like external motivation . 626205_642825
mhm .
so you've just suggested that there are remember back to the &-uh second class ? 643025_648085
individual differences in how we're going to react to the exact same type of motivation . 648325_652925
other thoughts about this ? 653335_654375
Dan ? 654595_654675
&-um I think grades are definitely a motivator but I don't know that they motivate towards the right behavior . 655115_660375

⌊ well I think there's ⌋ &-um it's definitely possible to &~m with so much emphasis on grades you can motivate yourself to do something to get a grade without actually learning which is what the grade is supposed to make you do . 662755_674395
so +/. 674575_674955

does anyone know what that's called ? 677395_678995
Tariq ?
rewarding A while hoping for B . 679215_681075
yeah so we have the folly going on there and then there's also there's another term that was used in your reading anyone have any thoughts about that ? 681115_687335
there's something that they they talk about goal displacement right ? 687995_690835
that the grade is there to try and reinforce try and motivate a certain type of behavior and instead of learning the stuff what you're really reinforcing is getting the grade . 691155_699715
that the grade is there to motivate a certain type of behavior . 700195_702155
other thoughts about this how you feel ? 702555_704055
Kelly ? 704335_704535
I think sometimes the grade is too ⌈ like it may ⌉ +/. 704975_706615
⌊ just speak up ⌋ . 706615_707195
+, oh ⌈ I think ⌉ +/. 707495_707995
+, sometimes with grades it may influence the way you think about a class like if you're sitting in lecture and you really enjoy the class but you take the first exam and you get a C or a D on it +/. 708015_716195
+, uhuh +/.
+, all of the sudden you hate the class and you'll never take another class in that subject again . 716575_719735
whereas if you didn't have the grade you may be more apt to say well I really enjoy the material I'll sit and listen ⌈ <to some> more ⌉ . 720435_726675
⌊ so ⌋ then there's taking what Emily said one step further which is it's not just that it distracts you when you're doing it but like if you really love it and then you get a bad grade +/. 726895_735035
it discourages you .
+, your attitude changes . 736195_737415
Beth ? 738115_738675
I don't think that the grades necessarily reflect learning either like I don't think they're a good reflection . 738935_744175
in classes where I've gotten you know like a a b@l minus or something I feel like I've learned far more over the course of the class than perhaps something where I went in with knowledge already and just could ace the exam without even listening I don't feel like I learned anything in that class so I don't know as I should be rewarded ⌈ I ⌉ +/. 744795_760555
⌊ mm ⌋ +/.
+, mean yeah I knew the material but did I really learn anything ? 760655_762935
no . 763015_763135
mhm so who &~n so grade +//. 763785_765345
it's not clear what grades are necessarily rewarding or even motivating Rich ? 765545_769045
I think that a concrete example of this like goal displacement thing is that like you look at someone's GPA . 769285_774345
the concept of a GPA presupposes that all classes are created equal . 774985_778245
but what you have at Michigan especially is that people actively seek out the absolute easiest classes in the school &=laughs:multiple because they know they'll get an A in those classes . 778665_785885
and &~th &~n and in doing so they they're removing you_know the challenges away from their academic experience and I think that's at the sense where grades just you know ruin things . 786345_795405
so wait a second . 795605_796145
how'd all of you end up here at the Business School where +//. 796645_799365
how do we treat grades here at the Business School ? 799485_801185
well +/.

Jason ? 810885_811645
if you talk to like the admissions people like that's not what <they say> they say that they look for the people that take the strong classes and I know for myself that that's not true (be)cause I barely took any easy classes I took maybe one easy class that's considered an easy class and I didn't get all a@l-s and &-uh like I did poorly in a_lot_of classes but +/. 813225_830805

&=laughs like they say they take the best students alright ? 866275_867995
you've got the best students but the first thing they tell you when you come here is that most of you are gonna get a b@l minus or a b@l flat . 868155_872915
I mean you're taking the best students and you're telling them that all of you are gonna get different grades +/. 873515_877135
uhuh +/.
+, where's the question of me being rewarded for what I am ? 877455_880935
+, uhuh +/.
+, rather than me being placed in one bell curve and say hey you're there you know ? 881035_884735
where's the reward factor ? 884915_885975
I work my +//. 886255_887035
weekends I work Sundays but I'm not going to get rewarded because I know that there's a curve that's facing me you know it's not me +/. 888015_893755
+, uhuh +/.
+, so grades don't really reflect my effort . 894025_895805
so it's suggesting that maybe grades aren't the best motivator especially when you get to the Business School Jessica ? 896545_901285
yeah I was gonna say that same thing that he said when you have like a median that could be a median you can work your butt off and you're not gonna &~g get +//. 901685_909205
nine ninety five could be a b@l minus if everyone knows it so it takes the emphasis away from like you knowing it to like you concerned with if everyone else knows it and it's +/. 909505_917925
uhuh +/.
+, it does the opposite almost it's like +/. 918345_923805
+, I mean <I could study this much> I could study this much and I'll still get the same grade .
so it can have like some dysfunctional effects after all . 923305_926605
other thoughts Mike ? 926965_927545
I also think it depends on &-um how it's graded like whether it's objective or subjective . 928065_932485
(be)cause I know that like if something's like cut and dry you_know such as like &~a an economics answer like if you &~n +//. 933485_938625
I I think grades could be a good motivator (be)cause you're actually learning the information and like if you put right answer you're gonna get the better grade . 939285_944865
whereas if you write a paper which is like graded you_know based on your teacher's interpretation of your paper and you may think it's like really +/. 944725_951385

these are my thoughts +/. 966545_967185
+, mhm +/.
+, and like I don't appreciate you . 967285_968345
<so there> so there's some situational factors that come into play like whether you're at the Business School whether it's a subjective so+called subjective examination of your abilities or whether it's an objective test where there's data and a right or wrong answer . 969545_983425
so one of the reasons that we introduce motivation that way is because you day to day experience with grades what often happens in the workplace which is you know there's this one type of motivator +//. 984325_995425
typically in the workplace it's money +//. 995765_997085
that we think can deliver all sorts of results that we're after . 997675_1001275
and it in fact turns out that maybe it has some consequences we didn't expect . 1001935_1007075
so we wanna be particularly careful in thinking about motivation in thinking about what we use to motivate people and in thinking about what sorts of things we wanna motivate . 1007555_1018155
and we'll look carefully at the Hauser Foods case &-um in thinking about those questions . 1018495_1023735
but let me give you just a brief overview of motivation . 1023825_1027585
the first question you wanna answer when you're a manager when you're in an organization is you wanna understand what are people being motivated to do ? 1028645_1036225
are people motivated to do the tasks that we seek them to do ? 1036485_1040845
right ? 1041145_1041245
so we first wanna be able to detect motivation and there are three questions you wanna ask when you wanna know if people are motivated or not . 1041765_1049705
the first one is direction right ? 1049905_1051425
where is their effort directed ? 1051455_1053135
what tasks are getting done ? 1053735_1055375
right ?
this basic thing where is their effort directed ? 1058295_1061315
the second is amplitude right ? 1061575_1063555
how much effort are they devoting to a particular task ? 1063675_1067995
how much of a task is getting done ? 1068095_1069955
that's the second diagnostic question when we wanna figure out if people are motivated or not to do something that we want that we want them to get done . 1071145_1080405
finally persistence right ? 1080865_1082425
how long does their effort last ? 1082705_1085085
how long are they doing a particular task ? 1085805_1088865
okay those are the three questions for detecting whether in fact what we want to motivate is being motivated right ? 1088985_1096165
we want a particular task to get done we wanna ask those questions . 1096945_1100605
now why do you care about motivation right ? 1100965_1102565
if a task is getting done or people are performing why do you really care about motivation ? 1102645_1107045
well the reason is quite simple performance we tend to believe is a function of motivation and skill . 1107425_1114225
right ? 1114825_1114845
people can be equipped to do a task but if they're not motivated who cares how qualified they are they won't get it done . 1114925_1120585
so on the one hand if we want tasks performed we wanna know about motivation but we also care about people right ? 1120665_1127105
we also care that people are satisfied in the jobs that they're doing . 1127305_1130925
and so the way to make sure that they're satisfied is to motivate them appropriately . 1131345_1137165
so how do you start to think about motivation ? 1137905_1140545
and let me introduce multiple frameworks all of which you read about for today in the chapter overview and there're there are three categories of frameworks <that I> &-um that I talked about . 1140525_1153225
&-uh the first focus is on needs that is the way you motivate people is you find out what their needs are and then you address those needs . 1153485_1161805
and the extent to which you can address those needs will motivate their behavior . 1162325_1166385
the second looks at an implicit calculation that models human behavior as though there's this implicit calculation going on within people's brains and the third says well you need to put certain conditions into place within an organization . 1166825_1179345
and when you put those conditions into place you'll be able to motivate folks . 1179805_1183285
so the needs frameworks &-um one of them very popular one is &-uh Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs the idea is you need to take care of people's needs at the lowest level physiological needs before you then address higher level needs like safety or security's next then after that there're social needs right ? 1183665_1203685
esteem needs and self-actualization there's this pyramid in your reading the idea is people need to have their most basic needs taken care of you take care of those first and then you move up the ladder and typically within an organization it's the higher level needs that we need to address . 1203965_1219005
right ? 1219505_1219525
now unfortunately though Maslow's hierarchy is incredibly appealing there's been no empirical research supporting it . 1219725_1227845
now Persberg came along and said well there's really two different types of needs . 1228425_1234365
we've got things that are called hygiene factors and things called motivators . 1235005_1239225
hygiene factors are the things that hafta be in place for people not to be dissatisfied . 1239865_1246205
so pay attention there to the double negative right ? 1246325_1248285
the idea is the more of these things you have doesn't motivate people but you need a certain threshold level of these hygiene factors in order for people not to be dissatisfied . 1248545_1258125
right ?
this will just keep them from being &-um upset and disgruntled so things like believe it or not salary or work policies certain things hafta be in place for people not to be dissatisfied . 1259545_1270525
but then after that you can't necessarily motivate people with more of those hygiene types (be)cause you then have to rely on the motivators . 1270785_1279025
so motivators include things like the way you design the job or responsibility the more of them you give people the more you can motivate the kinds of performance that you want . 1279725_1288725
finally &-uh David McClellan a social psychologist +//. 1289705_1292865
and I I talked about his theory when we discussed individual differences but he says well people differ on their need for achievement their need for affiliation and their need for power . 1293185_1302005
and you should identify what people's different individual needs are where're they +//. 1302585_1306625
who's strong in a need for affiliation ? 1306885_1308865
you know what ? 1309005_1309525
it might be best to give them a job where they can satisfy that need they'll be more of a +//. 1309585_1314085
motivated to do it . 1314385_1315225
right ? 1315645_1315785
people who are high on the need for achievement set out really challenging goals for them . 1315905_1321005
right ? 1321415_1321775
need for power you might wanna be able to show somebody how the better job that they do the more control the more authority you'll give them . 1321815_1328455
so identify people's individual needs and then give them the opportunity to achieve and to meet those needs now implicit calculation in these theories . 1328835_1337355
and &-um I'm gonna give you a handout <at the> &-uh towards the end of class with &-uh models of these theories on them . 1337995_1343695
the idea here is not that people explicitly are systematically making these sorts of calculations . 1344015_1349295
the idea is rather we can model their behavior in light of the calculations that are going on in their minds . 1349625_1356345
so for example there's equity theory . 1356965_1358825
right ? 1359925_1359945
the idea with equity theory is that somehow I'm gonna be motivated by the extent to which I'm calculating what I'm getting in return for my effort compared to what other people are getting in return for their effort . 1360145_1372585
right ? 1373045_1379445
so if I'm getting paid a_lot_of money for the effort I'm putting in and I see that other people are getting paid a_lot less for the effort they're putting in I'm gonna really increase my effort (be)cause I wanna see it as being somewhat equitable .
now the reverse happens . 1387105_1388245
if I see people doing the same effort putting in the same effort I'm putting in right ? 1388585_1393425
the input is the same and their outcome is a_lot bigger they're getting a_lot more for it I'm gonna start to reduce my effort . 1394185_1401365
(be)cause I wanna even the scales right ? 1402285_1403725
I'm calculating somehow in my mind that it should be an equitable distribution the outcome compared to the input should be the same for me as it is for others . 1403945_1413405
so that's equity theory there's +//. 1414105_1416085
expectancy theory is another sort_of way another sort_of calculation model that we'll talk about and apply to Hauser Foods we'll talk about that a little later but the final framework you might think about when you consider motivation is putting in place the appropriate set of conditions right ? 1416215_1434755
you can either set up goals , just establish goals . 1434875_1438975
doesn't make a difference what people's individual differences are . 1439135_1441515
who cares what the calculations are that are going in their minds ? 1441505_1444325
set out challenging goals and that can motivate behavior . 1444545_1448185
or alternatively there's the idea that if we set up the right set of reinforcements the right set of punishments and rewards again it doesn't make a difference how people differ doesn't make a difference what they're calculating . 1448485_1458925
figure out what behavior you want reinforce it with punishments or rewards . 1459765_1463365
(0.5) so regardless of what framework you use and the key in thinking &-uh about motivation is to use multiple frameworks (be)cause the more frameworks you have or if you rely on a variety of frameworks it enables you to address more problems . 1469665_1483885
right ?
and it &~e enables you to address problems in a varieties of ways . 1484725_1488145
(be)cause no one solution is going to take care of all problems . 1488505_1491825
and you wanna be able to look at certain managerial problems certain motivational problems through a variety of lenses so you can attack a problem effectively now when you're thinking about motivation frameworks a_lot_of them concentrate on carrots right ? 1492065_1506005
on rewards some of them focus on sticks on using punishments and you wanna be careful to make sure you're paying attention to both punishments and rewards . 1506145_1514305
and you wanna make sure that you diagnose a situation to determine well what kind of behavior's being punished ? 1515225_1521325
what kind of behavior's being rewarded ? 1521505_1522985
and also pay attention to whether this is a theory or your approach is cognitive in nature are you taking stock of the thoughts that are going on in people's minds and how they might be evaluating the situation ? 1523465_1534685
or are you applying a behavioral theory like reinforcement theory which is who cares what's going on in people's brains ? 1535165_1541545
all you care about is look for the behavior that you wanna reinforce set up the appropriate rewards and the appropriate punishments reinforce the behaviors and you'll get what you're looking for . 1542145_1552845
and important important important right ? 1553765_1555645
pay attention to individual differences that's why you want multiple frameworks people aren't going to be motivated by the exact same thing right ? 1555825_1563645
they're going to be motivated by a variety of different things so you want multiple lenses for trying to approach motivation <when you have a> &~w when you have a large workforce or even a small workforce . 1563645_1577185
you motivate it . 1578025_1578565
now you're going to get to something called principle agent theory . 1578825_1581965
when you get to business economics and there the magic bullet is going to be set up the right incentives . 1582505_1587825
now that's a very powerful theory but what I want you to remember is it's one of many theories that exist for how you motivate behavior . 1588425_1595845
and you never wanna lose track of the variety of ways of looking at motivation . 1596225_1600265
if you were Brenda Cooper . 1601265_1602805
what are you gonna do in this situation ? 1603305_1604565
any thoughts ? 1605425_1606365
Cheol ?
I think &-um first thing she should do is is to +//. 1606645_1611245
(be)cause they kept emphasizing that &-um Jay the guy that headed headed the Florida team was one of them . 1611285_1619085
so I think she needs to somehow gain their trust by either convincing them that it's not in you_know to her advantage to sell them out to the upper management and therefore get some information about how the Florida team manages to keep their sales and then do that for the rest of her district +/. 1619185_1641325
uhuh +/.
+, so that the &-uh the results can be like more attributable to her . 1641785_1646485

anyone ? 1654035_1654575
okay . 1654935_1656055
go ahead Brenda you're having a conversation with Jay . 1657435_1660375
you gotta get +//. 1660715_1661195
you have a plan of action go ahead . 1662015_1663735
you have some ideas let's see the follow+through . 1664175_1665835
&-um so Jay how do you keep your sales &-uh ten percent above the prime throughout the year ? 1666215_1673155

come_on Jay you know &=laughs:multiple I'm one of the guys &=laughs:multiple xxx you know &-uh exactly tell me a little more about how you do that . 1678855_1687875
&-um I don't know you know we &-uh we cover for each_other we make sure we get on each_other's &-uh butts per_se and you know make sure everyone's getting the job done help each_other out &=background_noise <you know> helpful hints . 1688495_1698255
you don't think I'm gonna sell you out do you ? 1698775_1700515
sell us out to who ? 1701055_1702455
<I don't> I don't understand what you're saying . 1702555_1703715
&=laughs:multiple .
hey alright settle down .
so you know &-uh believe it or not this is probably how the conversation would likely start . 1704775_1710155
and that's a good line of attack right ? 1710795_1712355
try and get their trust now there is somebody who knows exactly what's going on down in Florida . 1712495_1718075
right ?
and a_lot_of you are gonna go off you're gonna become maybe investment bankers or consultants or you may manage organizations you may become lawyers you're gonna have access to confidential information right ? 1719115_1730515
confidential information someone's taken you in and counted on you counted on your honesty and your secrecy .
and yet you know that if you share that information a much larger number of people are going to benefit from that information .
so suppose you're the researcher hired by Columbia University you're just down there doing research what are you gonna do with that information ? 1745635_1752215
what do you think you'd do in this situation ? 1752515_1753955
any thoughts ? 1754055_1754935
Danielle ? 1756035_1757055
well since it's confidential you can't she can't go to Brenda Cooper but what she can do is in talking to the people in Florida she can kind_of convince them that Brenda Cooper isn't out to do +//. 1757765_1769805
to harm them she just wants to work with them to motivate them to be better salespeople . 1770245_1774025

how's this gonna go ? 1785125_1785745
well I know that you have a very low level of trust for Brenda and the senior management but really what they're +//. 1786515_1792575
they're not out to punish you or to harm you they just want Hauser Foods to be one of the better companies in the industry . 1792675_1797815
and so by cheating them and not trusting them you're slowing down the progress of Hauser Foods so really there's nothing to fear there . 1798935_1807155
yeah but see I'm I'm getting paid with a little bitty salary that I get rewarded based on my you_know performance here as our little group employment . 1807655_1814895
so why would I jeopardize you_know having our sales get bumped up next year and not being able to meet our goals and not getting paid while the people in the head office you_know get paid the same regardless of you_know how we perform ? 1814865_1826665

<if I> if I were Brenda I think I would &-uh push to have their compensation switched instead of having them compensated based on &-um the amount they exceed their their sales plan every year I would have them compensated like solely on commission so based on how much like how many units they sell +/. 1834225_1853425

what's going on here ? 2796125_2797165
&-uh they wanted to like if if they help and the whole company does well then they can keep their jobs but if they don't help the company they +//. 2798305_2805805
like the the rewards don't really match what kind of inputs they wanna give out . 2806565_2809905

and what +//. 2814265_2814505

like the time effort that they would have to put in to work <harder and> harder and harder isn't worth it to them . 2829545_2833845
okay so &~th the company wants more and they're not getting the right sort of stuff Mike ? 2834285_2838345
&-um the company is rewarding competition within the company +/. 2838525_2841705

so the reward +//. 2849355_2849775
they want competition externally and they're getting it internally Paul ? 2849935_2853735
so there's reinforcement for the Florida team to do what they're doing right now and keeping a secret that they . 2854035_2858555
why ? 2858975_2859395
because if they did +//. 2859955_2861095
the &~al the alternative is . 2861535_2862575

with the same amount of pay they're getting right now . 2869755_2871455

so what's senior management rewarding again ? 2889435_2891415
paperwork . 2891915_2892395
paperwork . 2893355_2893995

secrecy +/.

we need new ideas . 2903065_2904365
right ? 2904545_2905225
we need new ideas if we're going to survive . 2905325_2907205
so let's now take a closer look at this folly based on expectancy theory (0.39) everyone have a handout ? 2908905_2938825

oh thanks .
&=pause_while_lowering_screen so again this is one of those implicit calculation models it's saying that you can model human behavior based on what's implicitly going on within people's brains it's not necessarily the case people are making this kind_of a systematic calculation but this is a way that we can evaluate the way rewards for motivational schemes are working . 2995025_3013505
and the idea is that there's some probability that people believe +//. 3013965_3017365
there's some probability people place on whether or not their effort is gonna produce a given performance and then they also have some probabilistic judgment on whether their performance is gonna deliver a certain outcome and then they place a certain value it's called valence a certain value on the outcomes . 3017365_3032805
and the valence can be positive or negative . 3033385_3035145
so there's a probability from zero to one that people place on whether or not their effort'll produce a performance whether performance will lead to an outcome both of those have probabilities and then you multiply those probabilities by the valence the value the attractiveness of the outcome to the person and then you can determine what it is people are likely to be motivated to do . 3035465_3057985
you wanna answer three questions from people from the people's point of view right ? 3059625_3063945
if I try can I perform ? 3064785_3066345
if I perform will I receive the outcome ? 3066825_3068865
how much do I value or disvalue a particular outcome ? 3069265_3073105

and you're trying to figure out what am I gonna do to change stuff in Florida ? 3094725_3097945
so first I wanna diagnose using expectancy theory what people are likely to be motivated to do right now . 3098425_3104845
what are the three key performances the three key tasks that we expect the Florida team to get done ? 3105325_3111685

&~wh why why would it be moderate ? 3231935_3233015
maybe because I mean they've been in the market for thirty years and they haven't had so many new ideas . 3233495_3238275
so they're sitting on a pretty good one down in Florida but you know it's a moderate probability . 3240345_3246405

what do we want right ? 3546085_3547225
we want new ideas . 3547305_3548065
and yet what we're doing is we're gonna raise expectations we're gonna take away time and maybe we'll give (th)em a small bonus which we know just &~ma makes (th)em angrier when they look at that small bonus . 3549545_3562425

so you get a task to complete right ? 3562725_3568265
(0.9) right ? 3577295_3577695
&~he <here's where> here's where we stand with this . 3577955_3580255
right ? 3580595_3581235
the sales force wants money right ? 3581295_3582995
<they want> they want the bonus they want consistency they would prefer not to have any paperwork they'd like a bigger reward for their suggestions and they really like the solidarity right ? 3583095_3591635
it's us against the rest of this company . 3591735_3593675
now Brenda Cooper remember this is gonna be the position that many of you will be in you're not gonna be running the company at least for you know five to ten years &-um you can control the sales quotas within the region bonus allocation in the region you can control the paperwork and you can can control communication in the region so your challenge is what are you gonna do ? 3594465_3617025
you're not a senior manager yet . 3617125_3618625
it's where you'd like to be . 3618845_3619565
what are you gonna do so that maybe you can find out what they're doing down in Florida ? 3619755_3623735
maybe you could change the reward scheme so this doesn't keep happening in all of your districts ? 3624075_3628555
and you can become the hero do well in your job get job security become an extension of senior management and get promotion . 3628995_3636155
what's the sort_of thing that you can do ? 3636595_3638095
now we're gonna break up into groups so that as groups you come up with some &-uh brainstorm creative ideas and the way we'll do this we're break up into &-uh &-um nine groups and let's start counting off with &-uh Daniel we'll go across the room and I'll just point because some of the rows are out_of line . 3638185_3654185

⌊ Paul Paul ⌋ &=instructor_addresses_entire_class .
⌈ okay you wanna take about ⌉ five to ten minutes in your groups here's the restatement of the problem this is a little more explicit than you need to be the key is what is the bonus system ? 3795225_3805385
what reward system are you gonna come up with as Brenda Cooper ? 3805515_3809275
to try and achieve the goals that you're after . 3809815_3812395
okay so be clear about the specifics of your program . 3812875_3817035
you can consider all of the various factors that are gonna influence the effectiveness in your system . 3817735_3822255
but the key is here to focus on the question you started the whole search with which is if you're Brenda Cooper what are you gonna do to change things ? 3822655_3829015
&=continue_smallgroup_conversation_at_63:43 .
well I think &-uh . 3829235_3831215
⌊ come up with some creative ideas and we'll reconvene in a few minutes ⌋ .
⌈ I think basically in_order_to make the company ⌉ happy Brenda needs to stimulate sales overall . 3832285_3837025
and the biggest problem is that people aren't happy with compensation &-uh regarding their new idea . 3838365_3843325
I_mean in_order_to stimulate sales overall we need to get new &~idea ideas . 3843545_3846505
and so she needs to reallocate the bonus of the system I think in some way to get a_lot more bonus on on not necessarily being a plan as much as having new ideas to stimulate sales . 3847425_3862265
because that way it should just be a downfall . 3862915_3865855
there're &~n there should be a like a waterfall effect . 3866495_3869255
if if everyone understands the new ideas . 3869695_3872155
I think one of the important things they have to do is like in the following year when they raise expectations they also have to give (th)em like a pay raise too like +/. 3873455_3881015
xxx ⌊ salary ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ (be)cause they're ⌉ working for the same amount and they have to make more sales it doesn't seem logical that they should give (th)em just a flat_out pay raise and then also give (th)em a bonus something like xxx . 3881915_3892735
see I think there's a bigger issue here though and that's that the sales like expectations are set from up above and people have no say in &-um in what will happen in what the goals will be for the next term and I think that they almost need to redirect the attention and have it &~st begin with the &-um sales crews that are in the different locations that are +//. 3893375_3910995
fall underneath Brenda have them set goals for themselves and give input that way they feel like they'll set goals that they think will be &-um feasible and what they think will be &-um I don't know what the word is but &-um +/. 3911045_3927385
attainable .
+, not attainable but fair for what +//. 3928025_3929405
for the amount they're getting paid and so that way they set their goals up accordingly and then Brenda can use that information to help set the expectations or set the goals for the upper level +/. 3929505_3939405
+, right +/.
+, when she meets with them .
yeah I think that's important we learned about that at the very beginning if &~yo if if the upper management sets the goals then the lower management's +//. 3940205_3946425

is that something that we're gonna just +//. 4041355_4042395
we would eliminate or ? 4043075_4044135
at least decrease .
yeah .
I think we should decrease paperwork . 4045695_4047975
well <and then> we don't know what the paperwork is +/. 4048515_4050195
yeah +/.
+, it could be really vital information . 4050355_4051615
what we could do is hire out someone to be support +/. 4051935_4054355
+, yeah +/.
+, staff and to deal with the sales representatives <to take> to take that part of their job away from them if it's so tedious and they don't like it . 4054405_4062385
I think it would make sense to hire someone who could help them . 4063345_4065305
+, yeah I think that's a good idea +/. 4065705_4066505
+, and eliminate that so they have more time to do other things I also thought that one of the things that was missing in the dynamics was &-um +//. 4066765_4074185
Brenda has just hired on . 4074405_4075365
she's a recent MBA and here she is like she's the manager of these people it said have been with the company for like twenty years . 4075485_4080885
or and they had only <high school> high school education . 4081205_4083725
they might feel threatened by her and that she's like making more than them and she's setting all these goals for them when she has no idea really what the ⌈ company is ⌉ . 4083885_4091045
+, ⌊ she's not like ⌋ one of the boys just as ⌈ Jay was xxx ⌉ +/. 4091045_4092605

+, &-um and become part of the staff instead of being the manager like +... 4097825_4101545
so she takes away that threatening atmosphere . 4102365_4105365
I think the problem with &-um separate from that <with the> with the whole bonus system and with &-uh increasing sales were that they were always they +//. 4106525_4113105
if you pushed the maximum they increased the sales it was kinda like if you had a really really great year one year then the next year it could be like not such a good year but you still &~ro &~yo they're +//. 4113445_4120665
you're expected to get at least ten percent above that . 4120985_4122645

you wanna ⌊ stand up ⌋ ?
⌈ &-um ⌉ instead of basing &-um your salary on how you do compared to the plan they might wanna base it on a percent of your sales . 4370265_4378725

<it's not> it's not gonna hurt you to work harder it's you know there's a positive reinforcement . 4386585_4391045
okay so you're not punished for increasing the quota . 4391945_4394405
but you're in fact rewarded for it . 4395305_4397665
other ideas ? 4397665_4398005
Mike ? 4398475_4398895
we kind_of like thought that in like the short term and then in the long term like in the long term there's a_lot_of like better alternatives as far as like her going through senior management and getting things like passed but like something is due to like profit sharing . 4399315_4411455
whereas like if you increase profits and you're getting some percent of it &~reflec reflected in your bonuses as opposed to like a one time deal also like you know stock options or things that just happen in the short term where she has little control over what senior management does it just &-um kinda like managing the role system xxx in such a way that it's like &-um rewarding the entire region . 4411445_4430945
therefore like they might be like +//. 4431725_4432745
they might +//.
one district might be more prone to like share their ideas because if someone's slacking in their district then they're gonna actually be hurt . 4433505_4439585
it has its like negative side but like as a whole it might stimulate . 4440025_4443605
and how would you do that ? 4444345_4445325
any of the groups have thoughts about how you would do that ? 4445385_4447265
&~h how might you do it ? 4447765_4449065
how might you do that so you get the whole region +//. 4449805_4452085
you reward performance in the whole region ? 4452565_4454365
any any thoughts about how you might do that ? 4455645_4457685
Kurt ?
you could have little bonuses for the whole region instead of specific districts say the whole region meets their sales quota then everybody in the region gets a bonus but the region doesn't then nobody gets a bonus . 4459065_4469825
so therefore if we find out that there's an elderly market for baby food maybe we won't keep it to ourselves because if the whole region increases in sales we get a bigger bonus other thoughts ? 4470685_4483125
what else might you do for the bonus system ? 4483305_4485025
good Jessica ? 4485405_4485565
we said that &-um you should take xxx away from like the internal company and make it like just industry competition (be)cause the whole problem is that like the Florida people don't wanna help the Chicago people or whatever and &-um the whole company wants to help each_other then they'll do better overall +/. 4485905_4505105
mhm +/.
+, so even with like regional competition would be in the company . 4506025_4509345
so just maybe some +//. 4509665_4511445
create some regional competition here any other other thoughts from any of the groups ? 4511835_4517415
good Daniel ?
we're talking for as far as bonuses instead of each year your growth your your sales hafta be like ten percent more in_order_to in_order_to in_order_to get a bonus instead make it based on a the average economic growth in the in +//. 4517815_4530555
as a whole &~i in the economy and on that you get the bonus not based on like +//. 4531135_4534435
so you you're taking away from like if you do really well this year you have to do even better next year this way it's more like you're doing well and each it it's independent almost . 4534745_4543005
so there's some kind of objective criterion that we're linking the reward to right ? 4543305_4547465
we're gonna look at general economic conditions Adam ⌊ &~wha ⌋ ? 4547725_4550865
⌈ &-um ⌉ Daniel mentioned when we were talking about stock options I thought that was a really good idea to increase &-uh kind_of awareness of the company as a whole . 4551425_4560205
mhm so it's a way to to build the corporate spirit in the long term if we can get the attention of senior &{l=SIC managepers@u &}l=SIC ⌊ &~Geor ⌋ ? 4560545_4566225
⌈ this ⌉ doesn't really have to do with the the bonus system it hasta do with &~compen the role of compensation +/. 4566665_4570645
uhuh +/.
+, we thought that maybe they should &-uh increase their base salary (be)cause right now they don't really feel like they're part of the company they feel like they're hired guns they're just you know looking out for for themselves they're selling the product but they don't really &~i identify with the company +/. 4570985_4581505
+, uhuh +/.
+, behind the product if they raise their base salary maybe they would feel like they have a some kind of stake +/. 4582145_4586845
+, uhuh +/.
+, in the future of the company . 4587205_4588005
so and and it'll also give (th)em that sense of consistent earnings right ? 4588505_4592085
that that that they were after Marcy ? 4592245_4594285
to increase innovation &-um sometimes companies if you introduce a new idea say they introduce to the elderly market and the sales of the whole company go up &~b by ten percent that team would be rewarded a certain percentage of that . 4594465_4607065
uhuh +/.
as a bonus +/.
+, so that hey . 4607445_4609945
you're thinking more of the company as a whole rather than just yourself . 4610625_4613245
so our fate isn't just how we do down here it's how the whole company does . 4613305_4617445
good .
Beth ?
we brainstormed a little bit kinda combining those last two where &-um the increase in base salary would come as a result of innovation and new ideas so that they would see kind_of a long term effect +/. 4617985_4627705
ah +/.
+, of their innovations . 4628065_4628745
mhm David ? 4629025_4629905
&-uh one of the things we came up with is that if they sort_of centralized the paperwork then they could sell more without feeling that they were spending more time selling because they said oh we have to do the paperwork so we can't sell well they'd be working the same amount of time but could still sell more and we could get a bonus also . 4630265_4648785
ahhah so there's a way we can reconfigure the tasks that they're doing which is a perfect transition to Wednesday's class we're gonna look at the way jobs are structured to motivate but you see there's a variety of ways that you can think about motivating people . 4648985_4661145
what I wanna call your attention to is oftentimes when we think about changing reward schemes we think a_lot about well what new arrows might we add right ? 4661665_4669105
what new performances do we want what new outcomes could we add ? 4669505_4673205
you also wanna think about well how do you get rid of obstacles ? 4673785_4676585
what what sorts of arrows might you wanna erase ? 4676995_4679615
like how could you get rid of this right ? 4679655_4681815
if you meet plan expectations go up . 4681895_4683835
and remember they're dealing with a mature product here it's a mature product line so if you keep ratcheting up the quota you're just not gonna get it . 4684395_4691675
there's no more market for baby food other than what we found with the elderly so we really do depend on this . 4691755_4697675
so you wanna focus both on adding arrows right ? 4698015_4700735
adding outcomes and looking at which arrows that currently exist right ? 4700755_4704835
which outcomes related to which performances are obstructing the sort the sorts of &-uh effort the sorts of &-uh performances that we're looking for how do we get rid of the obstructing arrows ? 4704845_4719485
now this is in a handout that you can pick up &-um on your way out there are two piles it's the exact same handout pick one up on your way out the the idea is look when you're thinking about rewards as managers make sure you're linking the performance you want to the rewards right ? 4719545_4735945
that wasn't happening at Hauser Foods . 4736745_4738445
rewards weren't linked to the performance that <they wanted> they wanted new ideas that's &~wh that wasn't what was being rewarded and make sure you're very careful to think about what is it that I want to reward anyway ? 4739155_4749595
is it effort ? 4749775_4750195
is it ability ? 4750375_4751015
what is it that I wanna reward ? 4751775_4753615
or results I mean grades tend to reward results when in fact a_lot_of what we get a_lot_of what what we might like rewarding sometimes is effort and ability . 4753735_4765635
and there're different times you wanna reward effort different times you wanna reward ability sometimes you just wanna reward results but be very clear about what it is you're after and therefore what you're going to reward . 4766065_4778525
make sure you pick up a handout I'll be in my office in about ten minutes (un)til seven . 4779025_4782445
&-um and see you Wednesday . 4783345_4785325
