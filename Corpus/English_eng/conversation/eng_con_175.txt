I'm lucky (be)cause our our teacher changed it <into gym>
so you didn't even have to have math ?
no .
so what did you guys do in gym class today ?
gym class .
we we played freeze tag and we played turtle tag .
how do you play turtle tag ?
because &-um when someone tags you .
you have to go like a turtle .
and someone <has to> has to touch your foot .
and then you're free again .
what about freeze tag ?
what do you do with that one ?
freeze tag ?
yep .
&~oh &-um &-um when someone tags you .
&-um you have to freeze .
and then someone has to go under you .
mmhm .
to unfreeze you .
&~oh I remember how to play that .
I use to play that when I was little .
well that's what we played .
<and I was ready to> <I was> do you know which group
there was only one game of freeze tag .
&-um and xxx I was it .
and my friend was it .
and another girl was it .
another girl .

I don't know her name though .
how many people are in your class ?
like almost like fif(teen) .
not too much like fifteen .
fifteen ?
yeah .
and there's three people it for fifteen players ?
yeah .
and we have to try to tag all of them .
and &~d &~d one time last year .
when we went to gym .
I I tagged the the &~h &~h half of the class .
half of the class .
you tagged them ?
yeah I tagged half of the class .
wow !
and were you the only one it ?
<no I was> &~s some more people were helping me .
so we almost got the whole class .
<<we we> we got the whole> I didn't know &~tha that we got
but then there was only missing .
but then &-um &-um he tagged another one .
and then then they keep kept running .
and then so it was hard to get after .
wow .
you must be able to run &-uh pretty fast „ right ?
yeah .
how fast <can you run> +//.
but not not not as fast as my neighbour .
everybody here I'll tell you a secret .
everybody here is a bad bad kid .
a bad kid .
they do bad stuff .
do you do bad stuff ?
no I don't .
so you're the only good kid ?
yeah .
and the kids next door are bad ?
yeah .
how come they're bad ?
what do they do ?
they say bad words .
that's not good .
is that the only reason why they're bad ?
no .
they they &-um hit people .
they hit people ?
yeah .
xxx .
do they ever hit you ?
no .
do you mind if I hold this for a bit ?
yeah .
okay .
and &-um but they never hit me because I I don't go
they like going outside lots .
so <I better> I stay inside .
when you're at home .
yeah .
because there a bully here .
there's a +/.
a boy .
+, he's a bully ?
they're not not next door .
someone way over there .
but he never sees me so .
he might think that <I'm I'm> like I'm moved to a new house .
mmhm .
well today I think I can go out .
because look no one is +...
xxx .
no one is .
yeah .
no one out .
nobody's home .
yeah xxx .
are you scared of bullies ?
yeah .
because they can beat me up .
they would never !
you're too cute !
they would too !
you're too cute .
would too !
so what do you want to be when you grow up ?
&-uh .
come sit .
so the camera can see you .
&-uh &-uh <I don't want> I am not sure .
I think I'm gonna would be &-uh &-uh &-uh &~wai .
&-uh no .
<I think I'll be> &-um &-uh I think I'll be &-uh scientist .
that would be a good job for you .
good job ?
yep .
(be)cause you're <good at> science .
<I hope> I I hope there's still some fossils left .
that I can dig in .
that would be exciting .
I hope .
do you like fossils and dinosaurs ?
yeah .
what's your favourite <dinosaur> ?
I <this is> <my only> &~th I wish xxx my dream come
but it can't .
my dream was that I &-um I wish that dinosaurs were alive .
but it can't come true .
how come ?
because .
they <were already> <were alive> were alive before .
and what happened to them ?
they died !
they all died ?
yeah .
really ?
yeah .
because there was this bomb .
that crushed this one .
and it the other one went all the way to the earth .
and <it got> there was no more plants .
<for the &-um &-um for the> &-um for the plant+eaters to eat .
so <then &-um there was> &-um &-um &-um then there was &-um
and once they ate it .
and there was no more .
then they &-um they die .
(be)cause there was no more dinosaurs to eat ?
why didn't they just like hide under a rock or something ?
hid under a rock ?
they <they still> <they still> <they needed> &-um
they needed other plant+eating dinosaurs because they're
&~oh .
so that .
dinosaurs are big „ right ?
yeah .
&~oh yeah .
so that's why they died out .
<that's too bad> .
<fifty+five> million years ago .
how many ?
sixty <they died out> &-um &-um <they out died> <they
did you learn that in science class ?
nope .
no .
you just know it ?
yeah .
just in your head !
yeah .
cool .
and what else ?
what else do you know about dinosaurs ?
what's your favourite dinosaur ?
&-uh T_rex .
T_rex ?
yeah .
why is T_rex your favourite ?
because he's big and strong and mighty .
really ?
yeah .
what does he say ?
huh ?
what does he say ?
he's xxx .
what language do dinosaurs talk ?
I don't know .
<they talk> <if they> maybe it they they
<but that is> what my friend told me .
that they are extinct .
but like in dark , dark , dark trees .
&-um &-um they &~h he says that dinosaurs are still in there .
so <you prob(ably)> you might probably break a tree and
but the thing is they won't remember how to do anything .
really ?
yeah .
they won't remember how to walk .
they won't even remember how to walk .
from such long time .
&~oh and it wouldn't be a good idea to get them .
because they will eat all the plant .
and finish with all of the plant .
and then the meat+eaters would come and get us ?
&~oh yeah .
pretty hopeless .
pretty hopeless .
yeah .
because everybody would die .
here .
just face that way , (o)kay ?
okay .
and then I will turn this way so you can see me a little bit
and then there would be no one left here .
just dinosaurs .
yeah .
but I would go +"/.
+" everybody run for your life !
hey cool .
a T_rex got me .
&~oh cool .
he wants to give me a ride .
cool .
you'd be in his stomach I think .
&-uh no .
that would be so cool if he gave me a ride .
and and then &-um if he was my pet .
then I would go +"/.
+" let's go buddy .
and and <kill all> kill the bully .
and +"/.
