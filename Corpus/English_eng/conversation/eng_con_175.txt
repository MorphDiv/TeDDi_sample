Yes .

I do n't even know what proper aerobics are anyhow .
Oh you just keep moving the whole time Running on the spot and
Just seem to keep moving all the time without even running on the
Yeah well this is this is you know it 's very difficult to run in
I know it is .
cos it keeps getting round your feet and sort of .
0 .
making you drop over .
Yeah .
And I suppose developing the muscles that keep you from dropping
I suppose it ca n't no I .
And then you do other exercises like lying on your back putting
Good heavens .

Ooh sorry .

Because swimming 's .
I think something that does do harm is jogging .
Yeah well .

Mm .
That 's a violent one is n't it squash .
Yes .
I I ca n't think that really violent exercise is a good thing
Oh I do n't think I do n't think it hurts when you 're young I
I think so too probably and you 've been used to it That let's us
I think the warming up exercises in themselves are a good thing
Mm .

I was waiting for him to say he went out and rolled in the snow
Mm and you should beat yourself with twigs as well .
0 .
I 'm not I do n't know really about that .
0 .
Oh you should definitely do that I mean .
That borders on the nasty I think .
They had a there was a sort of electric burner in the place as a
Mm .
where they kept on throwing on .
Water to .
water with some erm sort of fir smelling in it .
Oh yes it made steam .
Mm Fine mm .
That 's it I should apologize for canned soup but I spent so long
Mm .

I think .
good actually I think .
Yes which is it Is it Heinz .
Heinz tomato .
I I made some stock the other day .
Mhm .
and I put some of it in the freezer .
Yes ideal .
in erm sort of bowls .
What did you use for your stock .
Some bones .
And .
Oh some onions and .
Carrot .
carrot yes .
Celery That gives a lovely flavour .
I do n't think I had any celery I had I had put in whatever I had
Did you put the bones in the stock before or after the dogs had had
0 .
During .
0 .
During .
The dogs went into it instead .
Think what a luscious stock the dogs would make .
No they would n't .
Mhm .
Erm .
All that hair Yuk .
erm no what happened was that he gave me some bones that were far
Where they gorgeous marrow bones That .
Yes .
Oh yes they make wonderful stock do n't they .
Mm Well normally when he gives marrow bones I ask him to chop them
Mm .
but he gave them to me practically .
Mm He 's an obliging chap is n't he .
Mm I always feel that when he 's giving because he gives them to
Mm .
er anything for the bones one can hardly say erm give that another
He would n't .
the big knuckle has so much locked inside .
He would n't mind .
it does n't it .
I do .
Do you .
Yes .
I should really .
He would n't mind .
I ought to have courage .
He charges high enough prices for his other things .
Yes he you 're right mhm .
Erm when you do your stock do you first of all roast the bone .
No but that is erm er a counsel of perfection or something is n't
Mm .
Erm do you .
No Well I did n't because I just could n't be bothered to put the
What in fact does it do .
Oh I should think it erm melts out the marrow and does all sorts of
It gives it colour erm I 'm sure because of the of the fact that
Mm .
I put the next one in .
Mm Does that that gives it colour does it .
I read that somewhere mm .
Mm .
But roasting them I would n't like to get them with any sort of
Well I do n't think it would give a burnt taste but I think I think
Mm .
Er I just read it in er I was reading Delia .
Mm yes Oh yes she 's good And she tells you to do that does she .
Yes .
It 's the matter of the moment really you just fling them into a
Yes start from scratch .
heating it up mm .
Now when I was away staying with my cousins .
Mm .
he is a G P in High Wycombe and he 's a fundholder .
Oh good tell me about it .
Well he 's also been on hundreds of committees because they were
Mm .
and they have a battery of sort of board members drawn from here
Oh .
They had an S A S officer running running them .
Is that to get you ri to get rid of the patients he did n't want .
No it was to get rid of the Health Service He he he said that at
Controlled what .
Destabilization .
Oh .
The S A S man was .
Mm .
Why .
That 's what the aim of the people doing it was .
You mean the official government line .
Mm or that 's what they er or maybe that was his interpretation of
Yes .
and some of them as well as being housebound maybe are n't very
Mm .
and the district nurses visit them in their homes He had to explain
Good god .
Where did he fund this committee from one has to ask immediately .
he 's not given his committee it 's wished on him The local
0 .
the local authority creates the committee .
But I I had no idea that he then had to be that being given his own
Local council .
I think it must have been some sort of .
Yeah .
thing like that I do n't know .
Well it does n't seem sensible I thought it was the G Ps getting
Yes .
administration by people who do n't know what it 's all about .
That 's right .
what has happened to a lot of these hospitals has n't it .
Well it seems to be still going on What do you make of this idea of
Absolutely .
Mm why do they have to have a green field site and start again .
Is it because they 're going to incorporate a lot of high tech
I think so yes .
Mm and you see erm it is a fact that they need fewer hospital beds
Mm .
the the hospital stays are dramatically shorter than they were .
Mm yes but we 're coming up to a time when er the quantity of old
Mm Mm .
They 'll have something special for them like concentration camps .
I know Th they 've got those in Ipswich already have n't they That
Is that so .
Mm something like that .
I wonder how it really goes I wonder .
I do n't know Erm well it 's .
Oh this is disappointing because I thought that with G P who 'll
Well you ca n't leave a G P to spend the money like he likes you
0 .
0 .
You you know .
Ah .
Ah .
Yes anyway have you heard about how they do the costing Will was
Oh do tell me because I .
how they cost erm something like a tonsillectomy .
Mm .
And how do they .
Well apparently they count the procedures that are involved in
Mm .
erm they have a price per procedure .
Yes .
and they tot it up .
Mm .
But they have n't got it quantified to such a point where they can
0 .
Yes .
Really .
Mm They have n't they have n't got the pricing right And I can
They 've dearly gone on for years not knowing let alone
Yes they did n't .
these wretched erm .
they did n't know .
transplants costs .
they did n't know what they cost but equally being asked to budget
Mm mm .
is er equally stupid .
Yes it is Because er er ya absol .
But then but then the er the whole thing gets knocked for six
Well it does I suppose It does .
You can you can apply statistics to it a bit but it 's very
Oh have they .
Mm .
I did n't hear that I say .
Mhm Yep They 've had the odd child who has n't been erm whatnotted
Ah .
various men seem to have caught it from changing their nappies .
Yes I did hear of that I 'm sorry I was n't relating it to erm to
Mm .
Erm .
Well you know you 've only got to get maybe smallpox back again and
Erm .
They say they 've wiped smallpox off the face of the earth .
Yes they do you see That 's the doubtful one is n't it because it
Yeah but do they do they inoculate children against it at all .
No I do n't think no I do n't think we have smallpox inoculation er
Do n't know we I mean we used to .
Because they say it 's it 's it 's gone completely Erm sorry love
That 's very nice thank you .
And Noel will have the other Erm .
I have n't had any pork for ages .
it 's so new to them that they 're bothering to cost it but how did
Well if y you if if you go to a bupa hospital you go pa you pay a
Yes a figure that 's been around that anyway yes .
Mm .
Ya .
But I do n't know .
I 'm just having that to start with I think .
erm I do I do n't I mean I do n't know how accurate it is or
It would n't relate to what it costs .
to keep to keep to keep their profits going .
Yes that 's right .
Well it probably does relate .
That 's what it that 'll be it .
it probably does relate pretty well .
I bet it does n't relate to an actual operation in a general
Yes Yes .
That erm .
Yes their profit .
Ya that 's right .
rather tired bit fed up with private medicine at the moment .
Oh because of Richard I 'm convinced that .
Richard .
you know Richard er er .
Mm .
Had he gone to a National Health hospital .
Mm .
with the request to have that back thing done for him .
Mhm .
I 'm convinced that at the age of seventy eight people do they
Yes I 'm sure they would have done .
Ya And er would have erm perceived that he was n't greatly hampered
Mm .
but Richard was sure he wanted it done and nothing came between him
No Erm but did he tol tell you that the surgeon asked him if he
Oh yes it 's known that he did .
Mm .
He said er you 're sure because it was quite a thought for a man
Mm .
But I think a surgeon in a National Health would have said look
Yeah but then the first thing he would have done would have been
That is the danger He would So er the end was I suppose always
Ya If that 's if that 's what private will do for you .
Mm .
Mm .
I mean I think I had n't realized that they would make different
Mm they will it 's more permissive if you 're in the private sector
What because it 's all too good for the moneybags .
Yes it 's it 's I suppose human nature to want to pursue your craft
Mm .
But erm but it 's been a very bad thing for him .
Yes .
But you see they 've had computers in hospitals now for years .
Mm .
and are are employing and paying people to work them but they do
Mm Well y they 're a little bit like nuclear electricity in terms
Mm Mm .
Yes I suppose that 's so I wish the government could really
Yes I can think of nothing worse than Kinnock coming into power .
Oh Imagine how people like erm erm Helmut Kohl and .
Cook .
Not Cook .
Oh .
because he 's in his own party I mean Cook yes well he 's a snidey
Oh yes oh lord yes .
you know opposing him .
Yes .
They 'd just they 'd just run over him absolutely whilst he was
No .
It may not come to it .
But this recession is quite a problem .
Oh it must be .
It 's a worldwide thing though .
Mm Yes but the trouble about it is that the English are so insular
No .
That 's true They they regard that as an excuse .
Mm .

0 .
And was it one of his own .
No no someone had sent it to him .
Somebody had sent to him .

That 's right give me another twenty years .
We had those envelopes er and the cards for our concerts .
Well they were probably erm invitation to a concert .

0 .
Of course that 's right That 's right .
which was sometimes quite a difficult thing to do .
Well on a personal card you 're not supposed to put dear anybody

Okay Well help yourself I can recommend cheese .
Well autumn leave is the best way out of of of er communicating If
Mm .
and say to him so and so and so and so he 'd always answer back and
Mhm .
and er the time was wasted but you give an autumn leaf a little
Yes I heard a very interesting conversation on the way down here in
Oh .
you know the one I mean .
I hate it but I 'll tell you why in a minute .
Mm mm .
Go on .
Well I do n't like it very much but it has this very interesting
Mm .
and the biggest pro for a fax that I can think of is that you can
Mm .
As it would on the telephone yes .
Yes .
How right Mm .
So I thought that was quite interesting to think .
Mm and they ca n't argue with a fax .
think about .
I hate that programme because I like I tend to come and listen to
Mm .
and they 're only saying it for the sake of keeping going .
Yes .
And then er so it 's never it 's never worth serious attention is
Well just occasionally it is Sometimes you do get something
0 .
and then they get interrupted and you wish you know you wish they
That 's it you see that 's full of frustration .
Yes it 's .
for me .
I do n't like it I I prefer things like the news quiz .
Mm .
or even that one about that game with Mornington Crescent in it .
Mornington Crescent .
Yes .
I 've heard that phrase used but I do n't know what it 's for .
Oh well it 's it 's where they say say a sequence of underground
Oh .
in London in in a sort of clever way that makes it sound as though
Oh .
and they just say it totally randomly and the last one just the
You have to come to it .
Yes .
I yes I see .
Th there 's no logic to it at all but they play it on .
How extraordinary I 've not heard that one Mhm .
It 's a programme where they also sing the songs of one tune wh to
Oh you mean the programme where they do that .
Mm .
Erm well that 's not that 's not My Music is it .
No .
No Erm .
That 's erm .

Mm .
or heard it .
Mm .
but I ca n't bring it to mind it wo n't come to the front as it
Well I ca n't remember what it 's called .
Erm yes apart from My Music I ca n't think of one I heard a very
Mm .
came in half way through it at least half way erm but it was so
Mm .
talking and he was telling about a visit he had paid to China for a
Mm .
and how he 'd seen prison and er they 'd said they had n't any
Mm .
and he also he like me stayed in the and he named the hotel in .
Mm .
Peking he said can you tell me why his room was larger than mine .
Mm .

Mm .
he said in spite of the fact that I 've been in parliament for
0 .
and so Clement Freud said not to him but now on this programme this
0 .
That was rather nice was n't it .
Presumably his grandfather was Sigmund Freud was it .
Yes .
Mm .
0 .
The Chinese did n't know .
No I should n't think the Chinese have got much time for that sort
I do n't think they have either I do n't think they 'd have been
No Erm did you see that th they 're they 're going to look for some
No .
Well they want to find out why it is that someone who smoked so
Mm .
0 .
had to live so long .
Yes .
Well it 's obvious It 's the same sort of factor that allows
Well that 's true .
I it 's just a question of you know something in your make-up that
Well that 's right Other people go down with it You ca n't really I
There must be something though Enid .
Mm there must be .
His father was a very weak man was n't he .
Yes .
His mother was a character but .
She was not nice .
Not nice but she had a strong character .
Mm .
But his .

Mm .
With the exception of the one erm section leader that he deals with
Mm .
but there 's an organ is Sussex they want him to look at and erm so

Mhm .
It never came This is what they do they phone up asking .
They could have they could have even faxed it .
Mm well we have n't got a fax .
Oh no .
But the thing is what they do tend to do is they suddenly find
Mm .
I was talking about how dilatory S er Sotherby 's are .
Oh Yes but I know the thing dear no .
Well of course they 're not they 're not in a businesslike business
No not really no And I wonder if it seems to be that they prefer
