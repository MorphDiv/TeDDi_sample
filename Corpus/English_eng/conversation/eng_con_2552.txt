okey_doke &-uh well Kim Sook was gonna do another very brief summary of what he's up to .
&-uh to bring it all up on our screens +...
alright &-um +...
first of all I'd like to thank all of you for agreeing to be on the committee reading the draft and coming to the defense being with me at my last moment of graduate school .
&=laughs such optimism &=laughs:multiple .
⌈ &-um ⌉ .
⌊ he he's ⌋ gonna drop out ⌈ <if he> &~does if he doesn't pass he told me he's gonna drop out ⌉ .
⌊ <no mischievous IGSI today> xxx ⌋ .
wait for the others .
&-um my presentation will be extremely short .
mainly because I presented most of the data in a proposal meeting and also the four studies reported in my dissertation are very simple experiment so I think that by now you may have clear idea about what this dissertation is about .
could you maybe push that up &-uh the &-uh the the light part does it work ?
which one where ?
so it'll be a little bit ⌈ higher on the wall ⌉ .
⌊ tilt the mirror ⌋ .
tilt tilt the top mirror .
the the top thing &-uh yep &-um (0.5) .
well don't worry about it .
&=laughs it's done .
if you just take the top mirror and grab it won't it tilt a little bit ?
yes yes yes .
oh yeah .
is this a test ?
thanks +/.
+, hm +/.
+, okay &-um (0.5) &-uh this dissertation is based on &-um this theoretical claim &-um all people have their own theories about the world as scientists do and depending on what kind of theories they have their judgment and behavior will be different .
particularly in this dissertation I'm arguing that people who have unspecified interactionist theory are rarely surprised by contradicting event and surprising event and instead they will &~dispr display greater hindsight bias and I'm arguing that these will block their epistemic curiosity ⌈ &-um ⌉ .
⌊ &+c &+c ⌋ could I ask a procedure question ?
&-um should we interrupt throughout this or <how do you> how do you wanna proceed ?
&-uh well normally it's just a quick runthrough but I don't if people wanna do it <on a> on a you know just +...
in this fashion common on the fourth floor &=laughs:multiple that's fine too .
I don't know what do people wanna do ?
I mean there's nothing xxx .
whatever .
I mean (be)cause there're various points of which I think I might wanna want clarification and or comment on certain things .
okay well +/.
⌈ okay yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ why don't you why ⌋ don't you do that ?
&-uh including the first five words .
&-um an unspecified interactionist theory naive theory .
one possible interpretation of that which in fact was the interpretation I made when I first read the &-um the abstract was that there's a class of things called interactionist naive theories and you're not gonna tell us which one it is .
but now as +//.
after having read it that's not what you meant .
is that the case ?
in other words there could be tons of interactionist naive theories .
and but it's sort_of a mystery and you're not gonna tell us you're not gonna specify which of those theories you're talking about .
but that's not what you &~mea you're meaning by this term is that +/.
⌈ no ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ correct ⌋ ?
okay so maybe it's a good idea to tell us and actually the reader right off the bat what you mean by an unspecified interactionist naive theory because I I'm not sure that that's general &~kno +/.
+, alright +/.
+, ⌈ general knowledge .
is that the case ⌉ ?
⌊ &-um no I I don't think ⌋ it's general knowledge .
so I have three examples of unspecified &~in interaction theory .
so first of all &-uh people can have what I call interaction &~the theory about their self .
for example they can believe at times you are extroverted affable sociable while at &~o at other times you are introverted wary and reserved .
now this is interactional &-uh to me because &-um it has two opposite states at the same time so being introverted and being extroverted but it does not specify under which &~con exactly under which condition you are introverted and under which condition you are extroverted .
you just have two contradicting state in your theory without any &~s further specification .
now people can have also theory interactionist theory about behavior so saying that even an honest person will behave dishonestly depending on situation so +...
you you behave +//.
you can behave honestly or dishonestly depending on situation so it is interactional but there is no specification under which condition you will behave honestly or dishonestly .
in the more general level +...
you can believe the world is both the Yin and Yang so without any specification the Taoism says that the world is &-uh world consists of the Yin and Yang principle .
it can be Yin and Yang or both .
so in that sentence &-uh I defined interactionism .
unspecified interactionism +...
&~s so ?
(0.4) .
yeah I I I guess it's just a matter of of presentation I mean &~i it would seem to me that in situations where you are in effect inventing a term it might make more sense to start out right at the very beginning &~th saying what it is you mean +/.
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and ⌋ then get into the content +/.
+, right +/.
+, whereas &~is it's actually done almost in reverse .
okay &-um the Hou Fun Ma another student here now in Stanford used dialectical reasoning .
meaning the same thing as I do .
mhm +/.
+, so he call it dialectical reasoning coined the term but I use interactionism so for your understanding you can equate interactionism with dialectical reasoning .
okay ?
now to test this claim I I compared Koreans who are known to be more interactionist with Americans whose theory is less interactional .
&-um (0.5) so the dissertation is organized in the following way .
in chapter one I provided a literature review indicating that Koreans and other &~A East Asians as well indeed more interactionist so they have more interactionist beliefs of self and behavior .
so typically their &-uh self-descriptions were contextualized .
implying that their self can be different depending on the situation .
and their causal theory emphasized an interaction between the person and the situation .
and given this literature review chapter two reported report two studies &-um bad Samaritan study and busy Levite study .
as you recall in both studies &-uh Korean subjects were less surprised by a contradicting event so in study one &-uh this is just one figure from the four figures for study one this is probability judgment so when the target person who was a very religious person did not help the victim Koreans showed greater hindsight bias as indicated the decrease &-uh in probability estimate .
in study two when less helpful person did help another person which should be contradicting to their initial expectation Koreans again expressed +//.
displayed greater hindsight bias as indicated &-um in the increase of their probability estimate .
and interestingly when the target person did not help they also displayed hindsight bias so regardless of whether the target person helped or did not help they displayed hindsight bias .
and this pattern &-uh is quite consistent with the claim that &-uh Koreans' interactionist epistemology is blind to contradiction .
so in chapter three I reported two other studies study three NSF decision study study four liar liar study .
so in both studies I tried to create condition where people should feel a sense of contradiction +...
however as expected Koreans were not surprised by this condition where they should feel a sense of contradiction so here only Americans were more surprised in &~th by the presence of strong alternative hypothesis but not Koreans .
and also in study four Americans were more surprised and they found a particular finding more interesting but not Koreans +...
okay ?
in the final chapter I discussed some implications of these findings on development of science and conviction and debate .
my general point was that to do science successfully in a culture requires a particular way of thinking style where &-uh possessing and expressing one's conviction through debate &~i should be personally freely allowed .
and at the very end I tried to make sure that my dissertation is not making one culture look better than the other so I tried to &-um say that &-uh sometimes this argument culture of America may have some cost .
and this the lack of argument in Asian culture may have some benefit +...
okay ?
&~thas that's the dissertation .
to +//.
on the last point I would've &-um said that allowing science &-um allowing conviction and debate isn't enough you need to encourage it if you want things to happen allowing is a fairly it's almost a negative word you allow something .
&-uh &~mo many people will not do something if it's merely allowed .
but I was under the &~im oh I was also a bit surprised about the wording .
because it seems that I mean even encouraging debate &-um would not necessarily get you to scientific enterprises I mean you have to develop some consensus on how you're going about accepting things as evidence and so on which +...
right +/.
+, seems to go far beyond I mean it's a a taste of you know I mean as long as people debate and are surprised and curious everything's fine and you make great discoveries .
right .
&~c certainly only necessary conditions far from ⌈ sufficient ⌉ .
⌊ absolutely yes ⌋ .
I I'm still curious why &-um you wanted to do the thing you brought up just at the end about &-uh making different cultures look equally good since it didn't have anything to do with your thesis .
I mean as far as I can tell .
I I don't understand the connection &-uh there and I wondered why &=laughs:S3 you wanted to &-um do that .
a little cultural difference here between our field and your field &=laughs in terms +/.
well +/.
+, of politics .
okay if that's the answer .
right .
actually I thought you did ⌈ an &~outs an outstanding job with that ⌉ .
⌊ every cultural psychologist hasta ⌋ throw in a few disclaimers for all I can tell <by now> .
right .
yeah I mean it's I mean the first two chapters I thought were masterful in that respect &-um +...
I mean it is a fact of life .
you know <in a> in a situation where you compare cultures and people are very sensitive about this type of issue .
well until the last paragraph of the thesis it never occurred to me that one was better than another then suddenly he pointed out to me that the whole thesis had implied one was better than another and &-um and I thought that was interesting .
hm +/.
+, so it seemed to me two things that are different I don't see why one &~ha pointing out things are different is interesting intellectually and &-um can be documented but better is a funny +...
concept ⌈ if you don't want ⌉ .
⌊ what what what were ⌋ the sentences I'd be interested to +//.
it would be nice if you could avoid that I mean just .
well if if you want smooth relations among people then a culture &-um that does that better may not do science well but but that's a separate value judgment which you prefer and if you wanna do science well you probably just can't have smooth relations among people to the extent you can in &-uh in an interactionist culture .
but he does start with a very strong normative claim you know and that is the set of descriptive results of a very strong normative claim and then there's this thing called the fundamental attribution error and Asians are not as susceptible to it so there is a strong +//.
<that is ⌈ claimed very early on> ⌉ .
⌊ it's different ⌋ .
well no he makes an &~evalu he makes a very &~s he makes a normative claim he's actually further out than anybody on this although I'm pretty close to it in &~mak in making a normative claim about +//.
there is an error that's made and that the epistemology of of East Asians &-uh is such that they are less likely to have +...
yeah +...
okay so they're better ?
in that respect .
I was concerned with other's reaction and I could feel +...
I mean I didn't mean that Western thinking is better in all sense it's better for &~s doing modern science +...
but some of my you know .
well I I &~th no I think it's fairly clear Western thinking is better if you're gonna do science but that doesn't mean that it's better in general .
there +//.
it's it's not as good for other things .
right I mean if +/.
⌈ so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ all ⌋ readers are wise like you <I need a new> xxx .
mm .
hm .
okay well I just ⌈ thought ⌉ .
⌊ I I must ⌋ say .
I just wanted to ask .
alright .
I I I must say that &-uh &-uh +...
the Baltes link at the last paragraph did not save it for me .
and that I mean if all there is to be said for the advantage &-uh of dialectic reasoning or interactionist theories is that you may I mean kind of approach the indecisive state that Baltes kind +//.
that &=laughs Baltes calls wisdom &=laughs which you may often attribute to a lack of mental resources to to work through the issue so we say oh well .
right .
right ?
and I mean it's a classic aging effect I mean that's what he's saying and I mean in +/.
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ many ⌋ cases if the issue is complex then you say oh you know I I guess both are right <and he sees this he sees that> and &~gee I &~m I mean why would that be a great advantage ?
right I mean he could .
&~i it reminds me <I mean> I mean my prediction +//.
I may be completely wrong .
but I mean &-uh Roger Dixon for our you know recent aging and xxx book has done a review of what are the gains in aging are there any gains ?
and I mean the only gain you can identify is is Baltes is a increase in wisdom of the the Baltes measure and other than that &-uh what has typically been labeled gains is really just the slowing down of loss .
I mean there are some domains in which the age related loss is less pronounced than others .
and for some reason people have preferred to call this gain which is a politically correct move because you can't be accused of ageism either as little as you should be not accused of culturism or whatever the other isms@n may be .
and &-uh &~a and that's getting +...
I I mean well suspiciously obvious here when you say oh yeah +/.
I I ⌈ I was ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ more ⌋ wisdom &=laughs:multiple .
more thinking of &-um coping strategy so for example in marriage the divorce rate is quite lower +/.
hm +/.
+, and that ⌈ could change ⌉ .
⌊ overdetermined ⌋ .
in some sense but they have this this belief you know there is ups and downs so you can not make +/.
yeah +/.
+, quick decision +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, so &-um I think that's wisdom because &=laughs:multiple <are you aware> +/.
+, ⌈ yeah yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <of these findings> ⌋ ?
&~d &~d did you also feel like political questions were being raised in the last page that weren't otherwise so much to the forefront ?
I thought the very +//.
the whole first two chapters were about that .
I mean just not necessarily put in those terms &-um I mean that was my interpretation of it that's why I said I thought it was really masterful the way he did +//.
the way he dealt with that but they certainly are issues that &-uh come up in virtually any conversation you're gonna have about stuff like this .
they &~i they will come up in almost every talk .
I mean in one case I I think I told you about it was I gave a talk one time and there was &-uh &-uh a Chinese operation researcher in the audience who became very indignant about the whole proposition of the data and attempted to come up with all kinds of explanations that the Chinese subjects they &~w just happened to use were dumb psychology subjects .
you wouldn't get the same thing if you'd used smarter students .
&-um &=laughs:multiple you know and so you know people will react and I think it makes sense to anticipate those kinds of things the way that you have .
&-uh and in the first two chapters I thought he handled it beautifully and I agree it's just the last page I thought wasn't &-um up to the first two but that's okay I'm not objecting .
but you you you were bothered by that you know somehow it raised +//.
made things more political ⌈ or pointed than you thought it hadta be ⌉ .
⌊ well I I I &-um I was amused ⌋ I mean I I was amused because I thought gee it's the same figure of argumentation that you find in the aging literature where I mean basically you document you know memory loss &~lang <I mean> I mean document <loss loss> loss loss loss .
so at the end of that somehow you feel even though the data say you know it goes downhill pretty early and it &~s accelerates later on &-uh you can't really say that so then you have to throw in something where it says gain related with aging +...
and and then Baltes is is &-uh the thing that saves you because he claims that wisdom increases .
but I'm relatively sure that if I hadta construct a situation in which I make an undergraduate wise if I give this kid a a conflict situation you know where you have two reasonably plausible solutions and I put him under heavy load heavy cognitive load and some time pressure then I would get a wise response .
because your best response when you don't care enough to work it through or you can't work it through you say &~it it's kind_of both plausible kind of depends you know .
it could be this could be that kind of depends .
now then that's a low effort no cognitive input +/.
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ answer ⌋ and Baltes has chosen to call that kind of thing wisdom and and you're doing the same thing .
&=laughs .
well &-uh well I I don't actually remember the last thing I'd hafta look at that but my interpretation of the first two chapters was I think the way to go that you got two different ways of approaching certain kinds of things and the real issue is under what conditions are they likely to be more functional .
and &-uh I see absolutely nothing wrong with that in fact I think that is the best way to think about stuff like that you know where specifying the conditions under which &~they they're functional or not so functional and then let the reader do with it what he will +/.
that I agree with +/.
<you know> .
well &~w we've seen that there are these reactions and we should +/.
yeah +/.
+, make +//.
take it under advisement ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ I mean ⌋ I was in part interactionist so I +/.
⌈ yes ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ need ⌋ something say &=laughs gracious to make balance at the end .
<and to> put in a slightly different context I don't know how much time you wanna spend on this but I +//.
I I've in the past had +//.
occasionally hadta do research which got me rubbing shoulders with physicians and &~ph physicians are to psychologists as Asians are to Westerners that is you'll say something like &-uh you know I think you know the basic process is this and they throw ach it's much more complicated than that .
&=laughs and they're not wrong I mean you know I want my physician to think things are very complicated and &~ig you know assume this is interactional I'll be looking everywhere you know I mean &-uh simple+minded scientists that come in there you know xxx but .
so what's your interpretation of &-um when you're in the culture conflict of psychologists and anthropologists ?
⌈ it's &-uh ⌉ .
⌊ oh that's ⌋ the well actually +/.
⌈ it's it's it's ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ it's it ⌋ very <it's very much the same thing> it's very much the same thing I just wish to hell they'd give us credit for having something so &=laughs:multiple being so simple .
I fully understand their complexity I don't understand why they can't understand my simplicity .
&=laughs:multiple (0.5) .
okay (0.7) .
&~w what do you think about this +..?
&~s &~i I'm not sure this is the right term but it's almost like gets to be something like a moral issue .
within this culture it's sometimes considered morally unacceptable to do to be as you would term it interactionist .
it bothers Americans for instance that people are inconsistent +/.
uhuh +/.
+, across situations and it almost seems like the person is dishonest when the person doesn't behave consistently .
&-uh have you ever come across that reaction I mean has has anybody ever talked to you about it from that point of view and and have you ever &~i considered the issue ?
yeah I mean &-um &-um if you &-um +...
if you don't consider two opposite side at the same time and stick to one side only then you will be considered immature in my culture .
so maturity goes along with being interactionist .
is more desirable in my culture .
so &-uh I think <that is> that is cultural difference .
in terms of socially &~des what is socially desirable being straightforward or being more complex and indeterminate +..?
you know so I &~r I &-um gave some review about the cognitive dissonance effect .
mhm .
so although I mean the cognitive dissonance effect is hard to replicate even this country in this culture but there is no &~es to my knowledge there is no success of replicating dissonance effect in in Asia .
meaning that we are less concerned with internal +//.
being internal consistent .
I'm not quite sure that that actually addresses the question I mean let me see if I can come up with an example a better description of +...
it often bothers at least in my experience a &~f Americans when they see one person behaving in very different ways in different situations .
there's almost a moral charge to be consistent so like to use your vignettes if you are a good person you will do good things regardless of the circumstances the demands .
&-uh <am I> am I out to lunch on this ?
I mean have you guys ever heard anything like this I mean or <have I> have I just come from a strange subculture ?
no no I mean certainly what you just said is true of people of the Americans I know .
⌈ yeah ⌉ .
⌊ I mean ⌋ and and it follows from disposition of xxx and so on .
I mean if your acts disclose your disposition then I mean +/.
well +/.
+, different acts cannot disclose the same I mean contradictory acts cannot +//.
I mean one of these acts hasta be wrong .
right ?
the the local way +/.
is that +/.
+, of saying it is that that &-uh Clinton can't possibly be making good decisions for the country if he's making poor personal decisions .
well .
that's exactly what you just said I think .
well if he lied in this he lied in all .
yeah .
&~A Asians would never come up <would never> would never ⌈ think <like that> ⌉ .
⌊ nor French ⌋ nor German nor ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ <right that's> <right that's> right that's right right ⌋ .
⌈ <that's not an East West> that's not an East West thing ⌉ .
it's an &~America but you said American .
&-um .
yeah I mean maybe my perception is I mean is not quite right but I mean my +//.
I've certainly been in &~s in a_lot_of situations in which &-uh people observe somebody and say +"/.
+" gosh he's really behaving differently here than he did last week under other circumstances .
what that says is that the guy has no moral center if you will .
&-uh <and so> but you don't see like an issue of morality at all in this this is not the way these things are at all seen within these kinds of cultures you're talking about ?
I'm not saying there is none of this but but we are concerned with being consistent but it's less and I &~c I cited one study which is not published yet &-um the study shows that Americans are more concerned with internal &{l=SIC consistenty &}l=SIC consistency than Koreans and that predicts their &-um subjective well+being for Americans more than for Koreans subjective well+being so being consistent or not +//.
is really important for Americans but less important for Koreans .
&~l <let me try an> let me try an example and see what you what your prediction would be .
I I mean suppose in the US I say you know at the seminar that I think that theory X is let's say &~Fishba the Fishbaden_Aizen model is a stupid idea +/.
uhuh +/.
+, and then Icek Aizen gives a talk and you overhear me saying afterwards very interesting Icek what ?
which would be the American response .
+, hm +/.
+, &-um &=laughs:SUm &-uh &~th &~th the German response is actually like ach you know I mean just tell him it's a stupid idea I mean what the heck's going on I mean why are you playing nice ?
&-uh if I did the German thing you would consider me completely immature .
I mean Korean &~K Korean audience would consider me immature .
&~i but <if I> if I &~s told the speaker how wonderful his talk was the Korean audience would probably think that that's appropriate and +...
I mean there's an inconsistency there I think Americans are somewhere in between at least from the German perspective on on on those issues .
⌊ the Clinton thing is a bit ⌋ .
⌈ <well then it's field dependent> ⌉ scientists are a little less American in that sense .
yeah the the Clinton issue is a ⌊ <is is> is is ⌋ +/.
⌈ they don't take so much crap ⌉ +/.
+, is yet a bit different .
well I mean psychologists go out_of their way to say these nice things to +/.
+, we don't +/.
+, to speakers who say stupid stuff so &-uh &=laughs .
no the furthest we'll go is not to say anything +/.
yeah +/.
+, if you have to say something xxx .
yeah +...
yeah +...
so then you ⌊ ask did you have a good trip ⌋ ?
⌈ <that could be> ⌉ might be true but +...
&=laughs:SUm <that's now you're also> concerned with being polite .
yeah +/.
+, so +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, German way +...
looks quite impolite &=laughs .
&=laughs yes I learned that I I'm trying to improve &=laughs:multiple .
but so but how so for Koreans are they in fact &-um I mean Germans here Americans here Koreans there is that that's his prediction +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ ?
<(be)cause that's what> .
it &~depe well I I don't want to say depending on but depending on the status whether &~y whether the speaker is your senior junior when your speaker is student for example then the teacher can say something really nasty .
but if the speaker's your advisor you cannot say that .
so sometimes it's okay sometimes it's not .
mhm .
Galtung in the course of his essay there's this wonderful essay I don't know if I told you about it by Galtung about &-uh Saxonic Nipponic &-uh &-uh Gallic and &~Teuton and Teutonic &-uh styles of intellectual argument .
it's it's just it's wonderful ⌊ it's just ⌋ +/.
⌈ oh that ⌉ would be fun +/.
+, it's delicious &-uh now what was I going to say about before oh &=laughs there's I was gonna say before the Galtung &-um the point that was just on the table which is what +..?
&=laughs:SUm apropos of aging .
&=laughs but you're getting worse ⌊ don't worry ⌋ .
⌈ if you can't ⌉ remember we'll go on to the next other example &=laughs:S4 .
&-uh &-uh about &-uh thing but oh yes right no that that the &-uh that he starts his example with the example of &-um of the American professor .
right .
that that the stupidest thing that an undergraduate can say to a professor is oh that's very interesting this opens up a whole &=laughs .
if you just trim it a little bit fix this .
that's right so I mean the Americans all just as complimentary you know seniors and juniors +...
well maybe more like the Americans with with anybody at least in a public situation I mean that you sort_of go out_of your way to be polite and to not offend &-um and and I suppose another way you can get at the same phenomenon is the &~ques is in the notion of being honest and I think that things like this have been discussed on occasions in in the context of negotiations .
so in negotiations between say American and Asian companies .
Americans have often been taken aback and have felt that they've been lied to because certain things were said in that particular context and they come back and and people are behaving completely differently from what they thought +/.
mhm +/.
+, was in agreement .
&-um do you see no connection at all between +/.
+, ⌊ well ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ those ⌉ kinds of things and this ?
actually Jeffrey Burks and I'm doing a study about indirectness in in communication what we did was to give subject a vague verbal evaluation and we asked subject to translate that verbal evaluation into scales .
and we found that Americans student tend to take that verbal evaluation directly at face value so they made more errors .
because they couldn't see he ⌊ didn't ⌋ .
⌈ the verbal ⌉ &~eval &-uh the verbal statement was made by an Asian ?
or +/.
⌊ no ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ do you mean ⌉ just by anybody ?
by &-um &-uh their their own cultured person +...
but Koreans were more accurate in the sense that they could pinpoint the hidden meaning so they couldn't take the communication at face value +...
so <they are> they are more concerned with understanding the hidden value of the communicator .
well that seems odd in that <this all> .
just what you would expect that you'd hafta do right I mean if +/.
yeah +/.
+, ⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ the ⌉ standard of expression is more indirect then as a recipient you have to do more work .
right .
well either you you regress &-uh but what's odd about that is that the Americans would not behave in accord with their experience so is it I mean so why shouldn't the Americans expect when if they're dealing with Americans people'd say what they mean ?
oh so you think that when Americans say something good about you Americans don't take it at face value is that ⌊ your assumption ⌋ ?
⌈ yeah I mean why ⌉ shouldn't that be the case ?
well I I don't know I mean my colleague my fellow student seems to take praisals from the advisor at face value and I don't .
oh you don't ?
⌊ well sometimes I do ⌋ +/.

sometimes I do &=laughs:multiple ⌊ to me ⌋ .
⌈ we're ⌉ on record here man .
⌊ we're subject to ⌋ &=laughs .
⌈ if you tell him ⌉ if you tell him that's it's all wrong he may believe you .
then I take it .
&=laughs:S4 but if you say it's alright then <I> may be suspicious .
actually Jeffrey Burks has a piece a lovely study he's just done where he has the actual things that are said by &-uh American evaluators to their employees when they don't we know from their ratings that they think the employee is pretty crummy .
and you now give that transcript to Americans and to Koreans and ask them to say what does this guy really think of the employee ?
Koreans get it right and Americans get it wrong .

&-uh Kim Sook <I have> I have a very different question there's another theme in this which is not a cultural theme I mean which you turned into a cultural theme but I mean there's a more straight psychology theme in there which is the role of surprise in judgment and reasoning .
you wanna say a bit more about that or are there angles that you would wanna add to the discussions that you had +..?
I <I have not> I have not been aware <of a> of a real <a novice> <of a> of a systematic treatment of the psychology of surprise and its role in in judgment and so on .
I don't think there is any .
there really isn't much there .
right I mean <this is> this is &-um based on nobody's research .
but &-um I I read much of Berlyne's epistemic curiosity book so he made implicit assumption that surprise is a necessary condition for epistemic curiosity but nobody actually look at the direct relationship between being surprised and other consequent behaviors .
so &-um well you are right I mean I just took that assumption in my ⌊ dissertation ⌋ .
⌈ &-uh I ⌉ +...
&-uh &-um I can't really articulate quite well what I'm you know what I'm after but there seems something when I ask myself well I mean what do we know about surprise and when would you be surprised and I mean the way it sounds in your piece is that I need an explicit theory &-uh that has spelled out predictions and links between variables to be surprised .
&-uh I'm not sure I really believe that it seems to me that I often find things surprising even though I couldn't +//.
surprising or not surprising even though I couldn't have you know probably got the predictions right or wrong .
and it reminded me of the discussion in let's say Karneman and Miller's norm theory where the assumption is very much like I mean for for comparison judgments that you often compute the standard +/.
⌊ after right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ ex &~post not ⌉ before .
and and wouldn't that often be the case for surprise I mean that somehow it's only once a counterfactual comes to mind that you're surprised about the current outcome and that may not necessarily be a function of how well articulated your theory is but of how accessible the counterfactual would be .
I think I can be surprised about things for which I I I may be wrong I mean I haven't +//.
but I it seems that I I can be surprised about things for which I do not have a well articulated theory but only a highly accessible &-uh counterfactual outcome or normative outcome that I would normally have .
and here's something different and I'm utterly surprised but that doesn't mean that I've you know understood that the current thing should not have happened .
it's just different .
that in itself is you know ?
I think &-um &-uh what I said is not different from what you said .
I I look at the &-uh after the fact effect that is for example East Asians +/.
⌊ mm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ since ⌉ they have interactionist theory they cannot predict .
because so many things they have to consider but after the fact they can construct reasonably convincing story about why it happened .
so possibly I mean they cannot come up with alternative .
right because they &~c they can explain that's why they are not surprised .
+, mhm +/.
+, but for Americans since they have relatively simple theory they can't come up with alternative which is contradicting to their original theory .
then they can be surprised so I was not .
but surprised I mean &~y you're still I mean saying it in a way that surprise necessarily requires falsification <of a> of a theory rather than noticing that something is unusual I mean couldn't that be surprise just by exposure to a low probability event you have no theory why the probable or the improbable would happen I mean I just notice that this is different +/.
⌊ well actually I ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ <do I need a> ⌉ theory for that ?
<I mean> .
I mean I had a conversation with a Korean developmental psychologist a couple days ago who was visiting Carnegie Mellon and I talked about this research and I said okay suppose one scientist made a claim that a dog can fly +...
and he said well I can construct a theory story why dog can fly .
and I said it's wrong I mean if if you can construct a theory or story then you are wrong I mean you should not do that .
so even if there is no no there's no theory required just if they can construct a story +...
so then they would not be surprised so it does not maybe require just a theory whether they can make a story or not .
is that ?
and &-um +...
assuming he's said enough &-um let me make my comment which is that in in natural science what he says is absolutely true .
that if you don't have &~th there's just tons of historical examples where you sort_of know something and until you have &~u until theory gets up to the stage where you can find it surprising it's just there and you don't do anything with it or respond to it .
and then finally you have a quantitative theory and then it doesn't fit and then you go hm .
&~tha that's &-um partly why you hear stories that at the end of the last century people said that all of science has been done and there's nothing left to do and so forth .
&-uh it's because there were tons of facts around but they didn't even have the framework for them .
and then slowly the framework came and they realized that they didn't fit at all with the previous ideas that they didn't incorporate them enough .
so &~i it's a strong point in but in everyday life I I find it less strong as as you're saying .
so is the idea that there were these facts and things out there but nobody had bothered to even ask whether they reconciled with .
you don't know +/.
⌊ the ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ how ⌉ to deal with them yeah you know it's just it's not surprising (be)cause you don't have a theory yet in which you're supposed to be able to include it and and then eventually you get to that stage and then you realize that it doesn't fit as the theory developed and then it can lead to a whole new set of things .
okay but what about this I mean how do folks deal with this question of what the whole point is of having a theory ?
I mean why not &~j simply exist I mean why do you need a theory ?
for us that's easy .
I mean the whole point is to understand nature .
right .
⌊ and that's all we're about ⌋ .
⌈ you mean when you say us ⌉ who are you referring to ⌊ physicists ⌋ ?
⌈ physicists ⌉ &-uh well natural scientists I guess &-um I think it's equally true of biologists &-um or or molecular biologists <I guess> evolutionary biologists yeah I mean it's natural science I think what you wanna do is understand stuff and you just work your way along and that's the whole point of doing it .
so there is no other reason &-uh .
alright &~th that might actually get to an even more fundamental issue which I'd be interested in hearing your your thoughts about which is in day to day life what actually is the point of even considering questions like this I mean so +/.
right +/.
+, why would you even need to worry about stuff like that ?
&-uh I mean to get back to Gordon's thing .
you know I just go to work every day work in a factory and go back home .
why the hell do I need a theory ?
I mean in_order_to do that .
so these issues would never arise .
I mean so what kind_of a society would even think that you'd need to have stuff like physical theories about which you could become surprised ?
&~w well I don't think everyday life theory is articulated as theory in physics .
I mean the simplistic people have their theories but they +//.
sometimes they don't realize they do have theory .
so I don't think many people are bothered to have their own theory explicitly +...
okay well let me ask a related question .
could the real core here the core at issue here have to do with expectations I mean so intuitively it seems to me that you are surprised when something turns out to be inconsistent with your expectations .
&-uh how does that idea reconcile with the work you're talking about here ?
&-um that's for example in study one then two both cultures expected that in study one the target person would help the victim .
when the target person did not help which should be surprising right ?
okay +/.
+, the Koreans were not surprised .
so I think expectation +//.
sometimes expectation can be a_priori but sometime it can be constructed after the fact +...
+, okay +/.
+, &~that that's the &-uh +...
+, alright +/.
+, that's the +//.
I think that's the hindsight bias right ?
they +/.
+, right +/.
+, they they act as if they have expected things turn out to be this way not that way so they change their expectation after the fact .
is there any possibility that one part of the difference might be how firmly held the expectation is ?
say in the ambiguity sense ?
well I mean that's why I'm interested in conviction .
mhm +/.
+, if you have this complex theory and you cannot make a commitment you are not determined to do anything so it takes longer time to make commitment it takes more information to make a judgment .
<I think> I think that might be the case .
I mean do you remember how ambiguity is construed in decision making I +//.
it's been a long time since you've ⌊ read that stuff ⌋ .
⌈ is this a test ⌉ ?
no I don't .
mhm xxx ⌊ remember ⌋ .
⌈ it actually ⌉ .
yeah remember it actually is a technical term I mean to be distinguished from probability .
so one loose way that is sometimes interpreted is that it's almost like probabilities about probabilities so that normal probabilities that you would talk about as discussed in this thesis would be sometimes referred to as first order probabilities and then you can talk about things like the distributions over those probabilities +/.
mhm +/.
+, &-uh is it conceivable that in this context what you're really dealing with is that those second order distributions are different +/.
+, right +/.
+, in the two different +/.
+, right +/.
+, groups .
yeah I'm also &-um thinking about the distinction between confidence and uncertainty +/.
mhm +/.
+, confidence is just a your confidence expressed in terms of probability +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, but uncertainty is expressed as a range of probability .
well that that that +/.
⌊ right that's +//.
right so I &~th ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ really does that does get ⌉ get at the idea so uncertainty's sometimes seen as the extreme case +/.
+, right +/.
+, of a diffuse second order probability .
so right so &~i in terms of confidence there might be no cultural difference +/.
mhm +/.
+, we know that +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, but in terms uncertainty I think +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, yeah so .
that might be worth pursuing +/.
⌊ yeah right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ and that's ⌉ sort_of tried and true sort_of paradigms +/.
+, right +/.
+, for pursuing those kinds of issues you know that might be worth looking at .
suppose someone were to ask and I I'm it occurs to me a reviewer might do this say well gee the it's a lovely treatment of all this that you have but <why don't> why don't you do the simplest thing which is to make people make a prediction and then say guess what you're wrong .
and what would what happen then &~s if you were to do that .
well how would Americans respond how would Koreans respond .
&-um well if I'm +//.
this is right then &-um Korean would still be less surprised +...
why ?
because they can &-um explain why it didn't work out that way .
(0.6) .
suppose that in the Bayesian sense &=laughs:S2 you didn't just ask people what they think is gonna happen but instead you said put your money where your mouth is .
would you expect that people's expectations would turn out to be the same ?
so in other words if you were to infer what they really anticipated on the basis of their actions would you for instance in your experiments would you expect that you would in fact get identical expectations as you did ?
as you did here ?
uhuh .
I'm I'm lost .
okay .
there are in general two different ways that you can go about assessing what people expect to happen .
mhm +/.
+, one is the way you did it just flat out ask (th)em .
+, right +/.
+, the +//.
another way that you can do it which is closer to the spirit of Bayesianism you don't ask people anything .
you have them decide on the basis of their beliefs and you infer what their beliefs were from their actions .
so is it conceivable that from that point of view the Asians were in fact more wishy-washy in their expectations in the sense that they would not have been as willing to bet +/.
+, uhuh +/.
+, &-uh as extremely as the Americans do ?
would you expect that to be the case +..?
sort of consistent with the spirit of your interpretations of Jeffrey's experiments you know sorta like people regress they you know they don't really expect much of anything .
you know they they you know it's almost like freelancing .
they're gonna just react to things as they occur .
well I hope that's that's the case .
I expect that would be the case .
mhm (0.5) well I got a whole string of other questions so &~le let's let some other folks jump in this +...
&~o on the &~f face of it it seems to me that &-um if you have Americans with simple+minded models of the world &-uh and Asians with complicated models of the world and then you ask people for predictions Americans oughta be more confident .
because not as many alternatives are being considered .
&-uh and yet we know that it seems to be at least with respect to some things that Chinese are more overconfident than Americans .
so how would you put those ?
I think that's why Joe and I think that we needed to distinguish confidence from uncertainty +...
so in &-uh overconfidence is a measure of confidence .
just I think it's a statistical term it's a technical term not an everyday life term .
right is overconfidence .
yeah well yeah there is a specific way you measure it I mean +/.
right so +/.
+, we hope that it's not independent of the everyday thinking .
I think the &-um conviction is everyday life term and I think that conviction is is maybe more reliable indicator of behavior than overconfidence +...
so I mean that's why I put discussion about Joe's work &~abo about overconfidence and &-um my thinking about conviction .
that's a +//.
&-uh it seems like Asians are less convinced have less conviction yet they have &~e at least equal level of confidence in terms of a probability .
so unless I think a &~w unless we solve that problem &-um I mean they will just continuing confusion confusion about that word and this word .
okay but suppose I'm a reviewer and you make this proposal about this conviction thing suppose I say well jeez it's just a word conviction I mean can you in effect operationally define conviction ?
I mean so I would like to see like if I'm a really serious Bayesian type of guy I really want you to put your money where your mouth is I mean how can I know that somebody's really convinced ?
rather than just says that he's convinced ?
&-um .
and this seems to be especially problematic since you're cutting across languages .
right Bob Abelson &-um wrote something about conviction so he developed some criteria to measure conviction +/.
okay +/.
+, so and among those criteria there is behavior component +/.
+, okay +/.
+, like how much you discuss with your friends about that issue how much are you trying to convince others ?
I mean there there is I mean there is behavioral component and you know emotional component so I think we can measure conviction in in that way .
why would you not take the Bayesian tack ?
which is put your money where your mouth is .
so &=laughs:SU1 give you some options if you really think this is gonna happen then you choose A if you don't you choose B why not take that that approach ?
&-um I can do that &=laughs .
and you would expect that there would be differences ?
I mean I'm not familiar with the Bayesian approach so I mean I feel comfortable with the conviction <rather than Bayesian> but +...
what's your what what would be your assumption I'm still not so clear about the basic process what would be your assumption when you &-um put your subjects under load +..?
so that they &-um have limited cognitive resources and they can't run through the various complexities .
what what what would you expect ?
so you think that under heavy cognitive load subject will behave just like Asians ?
so they cannot .
yeah I I I don't know .
I_mean on the one hand you could say +//.
on the one hand you could argue that Americans become like Asians by &~s you know saying +"/.
+" ach I'm not gonna work through this thing .
I mean you know &~a and you give the it depends answer .
on the other hand you could say that Asians become like Americans because they can't work through the complexity of these interactionist theories and they'd go with one rather than the other .
&-uh I'm I'm I'm not really sure what I would +/.
⌊ well <I mean> my my ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ expect but I mean there seems ⌉ to be there seems to be &-uh I mean there seemed to be additional assumptions needed about processing requirements when you think of these things as differentially complex theories which would be another way of of addressing some of that .
yeah I think to me &-um Asian way of thinking it needs you know resources cognitive resources these are active processing of information so if they are under heavy cognitive load they will be like Americans .
they just choose one over the other .
but for Americans I don't know what outcome ⌊ would be ⌋ .

&-uh this may be related to a conversation that &-uh Kim Sook and I have had &-um periodically .

almost elaborated or articulated +/.
right +/.
+, and somehow I think no it's Americans who've got the &~arl the articulated theories .

it's just a mood that Asians have that things happen you_know nothing's totally surprising , nothing's you_know lots_of +//.
the world is complicated so why would I be surprised when anything happens rather than any other thing ?

⌈ wouldn't ⌉ yeah but I mean it &~seem it seems to me I mean I I I see that ambiguity I mean is there is is there I mean are there complex theories that somehow <are this> kind of thing and hence I mean no matter what outcome there is I mean you always find some sequent of the theory that fits .

I I think I've got the way of characterizing these two possibilities for Asians .
are Asians like clinical psychologists who've got a million theories and you can't surprise (th)em or are they like your mother who knew it all along ?
&=laughs:multiple .
well +...
in &~f in fact &~the there is few clinical psychologist in Korea &=laughs:multiple .
but there are as many mothers as here .
but many mothers .
right so +...
let me ask one &-um question about the thesis itself &-um while I pretty much agree with your conclusions about how these cultural differences affect cognition and affect the development of science I think in the thesis itself there's a pretty big extrapolation from your results to the conclusions you wanna draw about science .
&-um so I guess &~he I'm just curious if you thought a little bit about a few future experiments to fill in that extrapolation and make it more &-um concrete to draw the kinds of conclusions you made about you know those effects .
so between <for example &~sup> this thesis and science right ?
well your +/.
bring +/.
+, yeah I_mean your your four experiments &-um certainly say what +//.
&-um I_mean you drew direct conclusions from them but then to extrapolate them to the general conclusions about culture and cognition and science is somewhat conjectural .
and &-um <you can> they certainly lean in the direction you're saying but there's not a strong chain of arguments step by step that you_know takes you to those .
so you could probably develop some other experiments that would fill that in .
have you +//?
has your thinking gone in that ⌊ direction a bit ⌋ ?
⌈ &-um ⌉ the closest thing I have thought about is to get actual debate over a scientific issue .
so I gave one example I +//.
whether &-uh nature is more important than nurture right so if you're interactionist and you are put in a debate situation with other people then you may feel that those those &~in discussion will be silly and there is clear answer both are important .
and still I need some assumption so but that's the closest thing .
well you're making theoretical arguments +/.
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ there ⌉ rather than &-um strengthening them with with data that could fill in &-um &~w which would seem to me not <a bad thing> to do .
I'd love to hear from you .

⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ experiments ⌉ for if you pursue these again .
sure I'd be pleased to discuss that with you (0.6) .
Kim Sook &-um on various occasions in the thesis you say things like the following .
you say &{l=READING such contrasting reactions are consistent with a claim that interactionist Koreans do not see contradictions as readily as dispositionist Americans .
&}l=READING do you literally mean that ?
yeah I did .
okay .
you +//.
and and you're reading it differently I I suppose .
oh no I'm reading exactly what he wrote &-uh .
no I mean what if &-um +..?
okay &~le <let me> let me tell you what I'm ⌊ driving at ⌋ .
⌈ what's what's ⌉ the meaning of contradiction here I mean that's I mean I stumbled over similar statements where I I mean <I was> I was tempted to say like oh really ?
I mean but I think what he means and this this could be interesting I think what he means is that there is no contradiction for Koreans but there is a contradiction ⌊ for Americans <which which> ⌋ .
⌈ that's that's that's precisely it &~be because ⌉ is it that they don't see it as being contradictory or they react to the contradiction differently +/.
⌊ oh ⌋ +/.

⌈ I mean the first ⌉ the first case .
so they +/.
⌊ they don't ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ literally ⌉ don't see them as contradictory .
right because they can explain with their theory +...
do your data really allow you to say that +..?
well I mean it's a <it's a> it's a whole issue in emotional research for example when unless you measure like &~ph &~psych physiological reaction so when I say oh I'm surprised then you don't you cannot determine whether I really mean I'm not surprised or I just report I'm not surprised .
so .
&~tha that's a separate issue .
I mean &~i it's like wait &~le let me give you an example .
&~si it's not a really good analogy but it's sort_of close .
like I was really shocked years ago when I was on a review committee and I started reading stuff in +//.
well I hadta review a proposal that had to do with cultural differences in language language perception .
and &-uh this particular study had to do with peculiarity from an American's point of view &~o of Japanese &-uh confusing r@l-s and l@l-s .
and it was a psychophysical experiment and they &~conc well the experiments and they concluded that it wasn't simply a matter of not +//.
people not being able to say things in terms of and things like that they literally could not distinguish the physical sounds .
the difference between r@l-s and l@l-s .
that's different from reacting to them and saying well &-uh <and it's> and it's sort_of like here is it that people don't really see these two facts as being inconsistent or they simply treat the inconsistency differently ?
and I'm not entirely convinced and I'm I'm hoping you can +/.
⌊ I mean if ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ explain it to me ⌉ +/.

I mean if the second one is the case they just treat contradiction differently then why do they do that ?
politically correct (0.6) .
possibly .
how do you know they're just treating it differently ?
no that's what I'm asking I mean I don't ⌊ I don't know ⌋ .
⌈ but no you &~ma ⌉ you made &~a the opposite claim that they see them differently .
&~b you should able to distinguish with an experiment that's Joe's point .
but I'm not sure these experiments do you think these experiments are capable of doing that ?
if not then what kinds of experiments could you do to distinguish them ?
hm so they see contradiction but they just react +/.
⌊ yeah right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ differently express ⌉ +/.

+, ⌈ differently ⌉ .
right .
right .
it's a good question too .
yeah I got the exact same question at Illinois when I gave a job talk and the questioner wanted me to develop experiment in this part so my answer was that okay ⌊ &-um ⌋ .
⌈ if if ⌉ they gave you the job you would do that ?
&=laughs:multiple .
<if they> if they give you that job right you do the experiment as many xxx and you do and you go for P three hundreds .
so I gave two possible &~exp experiment one you can create a public setting and private setting because their their assumption was that &~Am &~Amer Koreans wanted to be polite to be respectful to experimenter so &-uh they want +//.
they don't want to their expression so you can create private setting versus public setting .
or you can have a panel study so you can look you you can measure their reaction time one and then sometime later because initially you may have reacted differently but the more you can think of in private setting you may want to express that reaction more frankly so .
what would you think of a Hou Fun approach to this ?
suppose say in these kinds of scenarios <you have> you have the Americans to in essence explain why they consider these situations to be contradictory .
and then you see what the Korean subjects think of that reasoning and vice versa .
say again ?
is that ?
alright one of the things that Hou Fun did in his thesis was to have subjects to look at arguments +/.
right +/.
+, and appraise those arguments .
and what I'm suggesting here is something analogous .
so you have these situations in which you have Americans and you have Koreans seeing situations that Americans traditionally would see as contradictory .
presumably they have reasons for doing that so suppose they were to articulate those .
would &~K would you expect Koreans to say boy that's hogwash that's really dumb I think that's a horrible reaction to the situation would you expect that to be the case ?
and also how do you think Americans might react to the kinds of arguments that Koreans would give ?
and also would you expect their arguments to be different ?
I would think that you would .
or you might expect that they aren't gonna even +//.
their +//.
Koreans won't even see anything to explain I mean that would be my interpretation of what you're saying here that they would see it as a silly question .
well it's what's to do I mean that's the best answer I can give so I mean you can I mean we have various argument write about the scenario and ask them which one they prefer or which one sounds reasonable I mean I can yeah .
well just something to think about .
yeah +...
I mean your last point is quite good I mean (be)cause if they are really truly interactionist there is nothing to explain seriously .
these are all questions that are easily translated into studies +/.
right +/.
+, that sound eminently worthwhile to make probably it is time to just talk to people and listen to what they're saying .
when all else fails .
when all else fails let your subjects talk to you +...
&=laughs &-um I have &-uh this is a question I've asked periodically &-um &-uh Kim Sook and maybe we can get additional reactions to these questions and and every time I see a draft it's indeed he has a a a clearer and clearer job of it but what &-um +...
&-uh there's some I I sort_of want to see the paragraph or the page that makes it very clear why all three of these experiments come from the same proposition .
I mean maybe they don't .
there're four .
hm ?
there're four experiments .
oh well but but one and two are really the same experiment +/.
oh okay +/.
+, so I mean he's got three qualitatively different kinds of experiments here and &-um it would just be nice if he could you know give the three sentences to why <I don't know> six sentences to why these three experiments all fall out_of the same basic proposition .
the experiments are as far as I can tell number one that behavior that wouldn't have been predicted is not as surprising to Asians as it is to Americans .
secondly that hypothesis confirmation is not more surprising when an alternative was possible or at least salable &-uh than when the alternative wasn't possible or salable in other words there's something there about contradiction or potential contradiction .
that's doesn't seem to impress Asians as much and third that &-uh contradiction of a belief just doesn't seem to produce surprise so you make people believe something and you ask (th)em what they think of that and they tell you and then you say oh guess what &-um the opposite of that is correct and and &-uh and they +//.
it just doesn't seem to &~intr &~in induce surprise in Asians so <how can> how can you put those drive all three of those things from the same core notion ?
I mean I was surprised that &-um you do not see the connection .
&=laughs:multiple <that was> that was ⌊ funny ⌋ .
⌈ yes ⌉ we've been talking about the aging problem &=laughs:multiple .
actually to me ⌊ to me ⌋ .
⌈ it's obvious ⌉ &=laughs:multiple .
<so he> so he's &~obvious he's obviously not Korean .
doesn't have a good interactionist theory .
&-um &-um my +//.
okay here is my answer &-um if you have a interaction theory then you don't see a contradiction as contradiction .
so you would not be surprised by surprising and contradicting ⌊ event ⌋ .
⌈ wait wait ⌉ one second hm and you don't see contradiction as a contradiction ?
well that doesn't I don't see that that follows ⌊ what ⌋ .
⌈ everything ⌉ depends .
okay everything depends right .
I &~thou if you've got an interactionist theory then everything depends but if everything depends then it's harder to see a contradiction +/.
right +/.
+, yeah okay okay then &=pause_while_writing and these are all about contradiction all of these studies are contradiction studies right ?
yeah I think so yeah .
clearly the third one is .
flat contradiction doesn't make something more surprising than if it hadn't been contradictory +...
&-um people don't seem to see that the hypothesis that was confirmed and the hypothesis that was not confirmed are &~suf sufficiently different then you should be more surprised than if we didn't know about that competing hypothesis which also seems <a failure to> recognition contradiction and how is the first then how is that an instance of failure to recognize contradiction ?
because for example in study one they expected that the target person would help and in fact he did not help .
so that should be taken as a contradiction .
okay so it's an implicit .
implicit &~contra ⌊ yes right so study ⌋ .
⌈ implicit contradiction okay you may wanna ⌉ use that term of &~im implicit contradiction and say okay now I'm gonna get really explicit in fact as you go from one to two to three you are making the explicitness of the contradiction +/.
right +/.
+, &~e ever greater +/.
+, right so +/.
+, and that would be a nice organizing theme is just you know a sentence or two per in length .
that's an implicit contradiction that this apparently warm guy you know kind person did this unkind thing still more explicit is you have two alternative possibilities versus only the one +/.
+, right +/.
+, and literally completely explicit +/.
+, right +/.
+, is A is the case and then you say actually not A is the case +...
(0.5) alrighty .
okay .
other questions +..?
&-um okay you wanna give us a couple minutes then .
thank you
