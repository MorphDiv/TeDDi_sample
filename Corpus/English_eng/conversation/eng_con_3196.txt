Ok so, this . 0_2043
ok, F ratios, ok, can be assumed under the null hypothesis to have
ok, for things like , and there's , oh let me go back a bit farther
The shape of an F ratio, the precise shape of an F ratio
Ok, and here we have two and sixty nine degrees of freedom . 33358_39547
Now <what> what the F distribution specifies it's a lot like
The F distribution specifies what the ratio of these mean squares
That is, there being no significant difference, ok, among the
And it specifies what that distribution would look like <if you>
And if you did continuous sampling, ok, over and over again,
ok, you'd find you'd get a distribution, ok, that looks something
Ok . 107151_107717
Actually I need a stats book here because I want the exact values .
Pedhauzer . 113564_114891
There should be an F table in here . 114891_122187
Oh this one . 122187_131064
So here we have the degrees of freedom
And what we know is that we have sixty nine degrees of freedom for
So we'll go over here and we can actually choose uh seventy, ok ? 150096_157590
Alright, now <the ones> the particular ones we are interested
Because they allow me to scale <this> this I know the
It's called a J distribution, ok ? 173405_176100
You don't know that but I know it from working with these
And this distribution is such that it starts at zero and goes up
Right . 195077_196977
Right, that's a value that cuts this distribution into two parts . 196977_202812
Oh, ok . 202812_204061
ninety five percent of the distribution
Right . 209218_210429
And five percent is above . 210429_212421
Ok . 212421_216200
So that accounts for the whole distribution . 216200_219129
What that means is that five percent of the area under this
Ok . 226920_228688
Ok . 228688_229119
Now, there's another figure given there in bold face I think
four point nine two . 234777_235527
four point nine two, ok . 235527_237080
Which lies at about here . 237080_238279
Now this is another cut line, &=draws:line ok ? 238279_240096
xxx . 240096_244744
What ? 244744_245688
ninety ninety . 245688_246663
Yeah that's the, <it's the> , it's the ninety ninety one, cut
such that
Is up there . 260815_263229
lies above that, ok ? 263229_266445
Now <these are> of course these are probability distributions
ok . 273503_275104
And what that means is that if it were the case that across these
That is the mean square for year over the
ok, you would gradually and lets say you do that thousands of
Yeah . 308999_309552
Ok, <if you take> if you did a frequency distribution of those
Say you do it a thousand times, you would expect that, well, ninety
But occasionally just because of random sampling you'd get an F
ok . 347274_349777
So that five percent of the time you get an F ratio that lies above
Yeah . 355978_357034
And one percent of the time, ok, if you did a sample of one
Ok . 363842_364393
Ok, just by chance . 364393_366527
Ok ? 366527_367978
Yeah . 367978_368634
Alright, so that's basically what the meaning of this F ratio is,
That is it gives you the probability of finding a particular F
ok . 393945_396320
<That's what> that's what the F ratio is, alright ? 396320_401384
