&~www .
okay &-um I found a frog and &-er put it in a jar in my room .
it was my new friend .
when I went to sleep , 0 frog escaped .
and &-um I looked everywhere , in my boots and everywhere .
and &-um I called for him .
and I couldn't find him .
uhhuh .
&-um my dog fell out my window when we were looking for him .
and I got angry with him .
&-um I went out in search with the dog <to find> to try and
&-um I looked high and low and everywhere .
and &-er 0 got into some trouble with some bees .
I looked &-um in a tree .
and I thought I'd found him .
but an owl flew out .
uhhuh .
&-um yeah I climbed up onto a big rock and looked everywhere and
uhhuh .
where I heard thought I heard my frog .
and I looked over a log and &-um found him .
and he had a family .
so I picked up my frog and went home .
