guess we'll start with chapter seven, beginning . 1_12880
and try and make our way through that if we can . 12880_21900
want to start telling me a little about what a factorial design is
um, try having more than one independent value with at least two
right . 33038_33901
for each variable in purposes ? 33901_41368
um, well, something where you can, um, see interactions: how one
uh huh . 56250_56560
and usually it's more true the way things ought to happen . 56560_59791
right . 59791_60390
and more accurate . 60390_61230
more accurate ? 61230_62773
yeah . 62773_63278
in the way that you, you can do things . 63278_66456
there's a, there's a relationship, say it's a inverse +... 66456_70111
um, curvilinear type relationship like this . 70111_74548
you only got two levels of the variable . 74548_76171
yeah . 76171_76531
you can't tell that with a straight line . 76531_77875
right . 77875_79420
even if you have three, you'd have, be awfully lucky to hit one
uh huh . 85778_86383
or I could get one here, one here, and one here and draw the line .
it increases your accuracy . 88720_90648
alright, another thing it helps you avoid is a problem called
the book didn't talk about this . 96335_98175
and I don't know if you've had it before . 98175_100815
it's real simple content . 100815_101550
you have a relationship that looks kinda like that . 101550_106736
and you have two data points . 106736_109016
the two data points happen to be here, but there's no relationship .
uh huh . 112976_113593
um and you call that a “floor effect” . 113593_116501
if you have more, you find it sometimes they change like that . 116501_120941
and the ceiling effect is just the opposite . 120941_124773
a relationship that might be uh kinda like that and you get two
now, ideally, you'd want to get one here and one here . 129696_133095
yeah . 133095_133440
to find a relationship . 133440_134031
that's a floor ceiling effect . 134031_137818
xxx . 137818_144026
ok . 144026_147170
and also, you must use factorial design if you want to compare
uh huh . 153290_154035
ok . 154035_157776
um, factorial designs have more than one independent variable . 157776_161880
and that independent variable is called “factor” . 161880_164335
uh huh . 164335_165023
that's where they get the name . 165023_166493
factorial . 166493_167590
factorial . 167590_168070
design . 168070_168638
design . 168638_168925
exactly . 168925_169455
um, all levels of each independent variable are combined with all
the other . 175935_177205
right . 177205_177541
so, say, for example, you have a you have two independent
one might be sex and one might be um performance on tests .
ok . 191916_192603
and you manipulate that performance . 192603_198468
xxx . 198468_200061
uh huh . 200061_200485
and these are both independent variables . 200485_201941
you would have a male let do well and one you let do poor . 201941_207580
you have all conditions . 207580_208708
ok ? 208708_209935
&=shakes head yes . 209935_210343
and this is called a “two by two factorial design” . 210343_212951
and you can always tell how many groups there are just by two times
yeah . 219463_219766
you can always know how many groups you're going to need . 219766_227205
so, a two by three factorial design has three groups . 227205_232365
and that might be uh, same type of thing, but you add another
um xxx . 237148_243566
yeah . 243566_244015
xxx . 244015_248301
now we can talk about main effects and interactions . 248301_253061
you want to define main effects for me ? 253061_255303
a main uh, a main effect is like the, vert, the effect that the
uh huh . 270950_271261
so, a main effect would be the effect of the, of one independent
the other, right . 278636_278883
say, in our example of uh male female and our manipulation of, you
of the dependent variable . 294441_296026
um, and we have a hundred point scale for frustration . 296026_299330
any males who do well have, you know, very low frustration . 299330_302290
females who do well have very low frustration . 302290_304315
I didn't mean that one
males who, um, do very poorly have very high frustration . 309281_314721
and females, high frustration . 314721_318066
so, we can say, we can talk about a main effect for four different
we can talk of the main effect of being male and that's, um, you
uh huh . 330775_331368
cause you ignore this and you
uh huh . 337263_337543
females the same way . 337543_338295
um, the high manipulation, the low manipulation, the same way xxx .
ok ? 343061_344226
&=shakes head yes . 344226_344586
in interaction, you want to define that for me ? 344586_347698
uh, interaction ? 347698_349515
&=laughs it's how, well, how the variables, the two different
uh huh . 363115_363650
so, it's, right . 363650_365075
so, at different levels of one independent variable, another
uh huh . 369515_369986
xxx . 369986_370243
right . 370243_370980
I'm pretty sure that's gonna come up on the test . 370980_373955
I don't know, does he give multiple choice or essay ? 373955_376035
multiple choice . 376035_377315
ok . 377315_377755
hard multiple choice . 377755_379018
hard multiple choice ! 379018_379306
it might come up . 379306_380098
define an interaction or something close to that . 380098_384435
but it's mainly the effect of one independent variable differing at
ok . 389666_390130
and the easiest way to see that relationship is in graphs . 390130_394930
and I kinda have a@l . 394930_398210
it's on ninty eight . 398210_399835
yeah, I know that page . 399835_401490
I have an easy way of doing this . 401490_404321
I don't have any trouble with um seeing if it's an interaction or
I have trouble seeing if there's a main effect . 411465_413376
ok . 413376_414031
see, I generally, I can tell, but I don't understand those . 414031_418063
ok . 418063_418463
oh, I have a good, these little, call it a “trick” if you want .418463_422168
&=laughs . 422168_423215
but I have a couple of good little tricks . 423215_425063
and we'll start with the, the bottom left hand one . 425063_428471
we'll look at that . 428471_429471
you see this kind of relationship . 429471_439560
to find out if there's a main effect of a@l what you do is you
uh huh . 443560_444608
and I call it squishing them . 444608_446220
&=laughs . 446220_446708
you take 'em and kinda do 'em like this
uh huh . 448763_449085
so, it would come out here . 449085_451010
then you look, after you squished them, and if it's a flat line
uh huh . 458760_459711
no bend to it . 459711_460416
if it's a flat line . 460416_462513
this is flat, but it's horizontal, then there's no main effects for
uh huh . 466528_466936
so, you can see that clearly on that one . 466936_471328
and the one to the right of it, if you collapse those, you would
right . 477648_478471
uh huh . 478471_479016
and that is a main effect for a@l . 479016_480621
because at one point +/. 480621_481836
it's if you collapse them and they're um horizontal, then there's
right . 486868_487173
ok . 487173_487611
and that's an easy way to do it . 487611_489588
and well hope, well hopefully you'll get, you'll be able to
uh huh . 495460_495788
for b@l what you do is you look at the midpoint of each line . 495788_500786
the midpoint of this line would be here . 500786_503635
and the midpoint of this line would be here . 503635_507366
if they're different . 507366_509071
uh huh . 509071_509815
they're different levels, that means, the levels are on this axis
uh huh . 515036_515460
then we can say that there's no main effect for b@l if they're the
but if they're different, there is a main effect for b@l . 520563_522835
so, just real quick, until I see an example where there's no main
uh huh . 528076_528348
that would look like +... 528348_529796
the midpoint of this line is here
ok . 541468_542220
you've got no main effect for b in that situation . 542220_544388
ok . 544388_548325
and you see in the upper right hand on that page ninty eight, if
yeah . 556111_558391
see that ? 558391_559206
uh huh . 559206_559591
so, that's a quick trick to determine that . 559591_563526
now, the more serious way of why that is . 563526_566560
you pretty much have to look at the uh at the two by two
uh huh . 571851_572445
and you can see, let's look at the bottom left hand one first . 572445_575723
now we've already decided that there's no main effect for a@l . 575723_578648
well, let's verify that . 578648_580121
we'll take a@l and ignore b@l . 580121_582720
so, we're looking across each cell . 582720_585298
so, we have an average of a@l one is five and the average of b@l
so, that there is no main effect between, for a@l . 592038_597173
since a@l one is the same as a@l two . 597173_599093
uh huh . 599093_599493
ignore a@l and looking at b@l, looking down . 599493_602725
you have different b@l one is six, is different from b@l two . 602725_607131
ok . 607131_609963
so, you can see that there's no main effect for b@l in that
uh huh . 614051_614546
one thing that I want to point out that the book kind of glosses
you say, well, that's almost parallel . 620755_630306
so, would that mean there's, be an interaction ? 630306_632385
you have to check it with statistics . 632385_634771
right . 634771_634988
it's a statistical question . 634988_635915
if it's questionable . 635915_636291
yeah . 636291_636708
so, it's not just a matter of parallel versus uh . 636708_639843
I mean, if they're close enough you have to look at 'em . 639843_641503
yeah . 641503_641831
the book makes it seem like it's so black and white there . 641831_647581
uh huh . 647581_648166
ok . 648166_650740
why don't you I'll draw one for you . 650740_654133
you can tell me if there's main effects for a@l and b@l and if see
ok . 677560_682310
first of all, is there an interaction ? 682310_682838
yes . 682838_684086
is there a main effect for a ? 684086_687775
umm yes . 687775_698396
probably if you squished 'em, you're gonna probably end up with
uh huh . 704498_705810
this is perfectly v@l shaped . 705810_709120
xxx so, yeah, you're probably right at that . 709120_714441
and is there a main effect for b@l ? 714441_715945
um yeah . 715945_727920
probably . 727920_729868
the midpoints would go like this . 729868_732313
yeah . 732313_733976
ok ? 733976_737345
ok, they overlap . 737345_752473
is there an interaction ? 752473_753438
no . 753438_755726
xxx . 755726_757286
&=laughs . 757286_758086
uh huh . 758086_758686
is there a main effect for b@l ? 758686_761735
no +...761735_766238
is there a main effect for a@l ? 766238_771821
oh, no . 771821_777826
xxx . 777826_778955
right . 778955_779595
&=laughs . 779595_780420
now, if you want me to, to create a cell in order to explain this
I'll help you fillin' this out . 794258_798938
what do you want a@l one to be ? 798938_801231
xxx xxx, right ? 801231_829823
hmm ? 829823_830805
yeah . 830805_832285
right . 832285_833093
so um .833093_842461
xxx . 842461_849778
uh huh . 849778_865521
if there's not any effect, wouldn't all these, would all these be
uh huh . 883521_890200
so, that one would look ok ? 890200_891555
uh huh . 891555_891865
ok . 891865_893018
it would look like that . 893018_902788
ok . 902788_910291
do you feel pretty comfortable with that ? 910291_912148
sort of . 912148_913915
alright . 913915_914626
but, I, I, I understand it more than I did . 914626_918690
ok, why don't you uh, the bot, on page ninty nine, the bottom left .
mmm . 922891_924075
it's written in what the answers are, but you might want to explain
that one I don't understand . 927883_930530
ok . 930530_931186
just real quick . 931186_940598
ok, is there an interaction, first of all ? 940598_942013
yeah . 942013_943116
ok . 943116_944416
we've got an intersection right here
now, is there a main effect for a@l and how do you determine that ?
well, it says there's one here, and that, that's what I don't
ok . 953298_953795
I understand that there is one for b, but I don't understand . 953795_956138
if you kind of squish it .956138_957635
uh huh . 957635_958450
or find the midpoint, it's gonna look like this which is a
uh huh . 967880_968453
which means no main effect for a@l . 968453_971076
ok . 971076_971881
so, basically, when you, if you're looking at the cell, these two
ok . 977321_978793
although this one might be high and low
uh huh . 986408_986776
they're gonna turn out to be the same . 986776_987840
ok . 987840_989928
so, this is equidistant xxx . 989928_993815
these two right in here xxx . 993815_994225
ok . 994225_996008
and is there a main effect for b@l ? 996008_1001240
uh huh . 1001240_1003286
because ? 1003286_1003686
their midpoints are horizontal . 1003686_1006575
ok . 1006575_1015863
you want to try that last one ? 1015863_1017136
bottom right ? 1017136_1017766
ok, how 'bout the bottom left actually . 1017766_1020871
that's the one we just did ! 1020871_1022006
oh, ok . 1022006_1022446
top, top right version . 1022446_1024206
top right . 1024206_1024701
ok, um: xxx . 1024701_1034548
uh huh . 1034548_1035665
um and, there's not a main effect for b@l, because of the point
xxx . 1045691_1046385
huh ? 1046385_1047098
I mean, they are at, yeah ! 1047098_1048681
I understand what you are saying . 1048681_1049993
yeah, that they're, they're xxx . 1049993_1053033
ok . 1053033_1053353
um I don't understand a@l . 1053353_1061751
the collapsing ? 1061751_1063593
uh huh . 1063593_1064448
we kind of, uh the way to think of it is, just kind of squish
then you're gonna end up with a
uh I don't understand that how, how, how you .1078576_1084193
squish 'em ? 1084193_1084751
yeah . 1084751_1085495
I don't understand how you +... 1085495_1086840
ok . 1086840_1087816
well . 1087816_1088486
which one . 1088486_1089511
squishing can be very xxx . 1089511_1090695
yeah . 1090695_1091038
ok, that's your graph . 1091038_1094031
what I'm doing is I'm bisecting like that . 1094031_1098823
oh, ok, squish . 1098823_1100543
oh, oh, ok ! 1100543_1101678
I understand that now . 1101678_1102775
alright ? 1102775_1103246
yeah . 1103246_1104991
so, you have one at b@l . 1104991_1106846
so, basically, is what you're doing is collapsing into what would
right, exactly ! 1113406_1114375
alright, I understand that now . 1114375_1115590
ok, good . 1115590_1116086
good . 1116086_1116775
ok . 1116775_1117358
I think you've got that down pretty well . 1117358_1119805
you want to do the bottom right real quick ? 1119805_1121076
bottom right . 1121076_1122396
ok, yes, there's an interaction, and, um, there's not for b@l
ok . 1129828_1130605
they're at the same level . 1130605_1131420
uh huh . 1131420_1134810
and there's not for a@l, because when you collapse them, they come
right . 1137990_1138310
xxx . 1138310_1142813
I understand ! 1142813_1144598
&=laughs . 1144598_1145893
&=laughs ok . 1145893_1149236
you've heard about a mixed factorial design . 1149236_1151485
that's kind of an easy concept, I think . 1151485_1153750
mmm . 1153750_1155133
um you have both experimental and correlational data and that
um and the purpose of that is to allow researchers to study
characteristics . 1173556_1173828
you mean like +/. 1173828_1174843
yeah, like sex, age, or +/. 1174843_1175868
uh huh . 1175868_1176586
whatever . 1176586_1177588
right, 'cause those aren't manipulated . 1177588_1179578
yeah, you can't very well change somebody's sex . 1179578_1181746
right . 1181746_1181986
right, exactly . 1181986_1183395
ok, so, that's really what it's for is to have different people
uh huh . 1189836_1190186
uh huh . 1190186_1192521
xxx . 1192521_1193146
umm, random assignment . 1193146_1195971
ok, there's really a, we'll talk about three different ways of
I don't know if you had a tutoring session last week or not . 1201698_1204778
uh huh . 1204778_1205898
alright, that was the topic, part of the topic for last week . 1205898_1208626
0 . 1208626_1210241
oh, right . 1210241_1211521
yeah, I had it last time . 1211521_1215113
so, you understand the concept between that . 1215113_1218041
uh huh . 1218041_1218513
so, if you have a two by two factorial design and you have
and you wanted to do a repeated measures design . 1228471_1235688
uh huh . 1235688_1236560
you'd only have, with repeated measures, you only have eight
you have all subjects do all conditions . 1244240_1245831
right . 1245831_1246128
ok . 1246128_1246936
now, if you wanted to do it independent measures . 1246936_1249551
you'd have thirty two ? 1249551_1252578
thirty two ? 1252578_1255451
subjects ! 1255451_1256268
you could . 1256268_1257530
yeah, if you wanted eight per per cell . 1257530_1259898
right . 1259898_1260571
right . 1260571_1260946
yeah . 1260946_1261435
if I just had eight subjects to work with, then I would put . 1261435_1263946
oh, if you had eight subjects to, to work with, you'd put two in
&=laughs . 1268306_1269098
&=laughs that's right . 1269098_1270361
you have two doing eight . 1270361_1272138
and, xxx I wonder if we could do it like this subject one
and we should have sixteen when we get finished . 1327570_1329750
we only have like five six seven eight nine ten elelven twelve only
we could get by . 1335278_1336006
change this to tweleve . 1336006_1339418
change this to subject five subject six subject seven subject eight
and now we're getting our, our mixed xxx of design . 1351521_1354953
you combined assignment . 1354953_1357330
because we have repeated measures, subject one and subject two . 1357330_1365128
subject, right . 1365128_1365991
and three and four aren't doing a repeated . 1365991_1368455
xxx subjects one and two repeated xxx . 1368455_1392718
is that right ? 1392718_1393236
uh huh . 1393236_1394091
yeah, and three and four are doing the same thing . 1394091_1398185
right . 1398185_1399563
xxx for a@l . 1399563_1410503
I can't get the words ! 1410503_1412590
&=laughs . 1412590_1412981
xxx . 1412981_1417893
yeah, when we were randomly assigning, right ? 1417893_1420373
xxx . 1420373_1421405
so, instead of having subjects one and two in all conditions, we
two, right . 1424723_1425628
subject three and four . 1425628_1426681
so, we get some of the benefits of repeated and some of the
and hopefully, we will be able to, with this design, control for
the statistical things that xxx make it more strong and that type
and the book also contains a simple . 1446113_1449930
yeah, I'm sure xxx try to figure it out . 1449930_1451698
&=laughs . 1451698_1452315
xxx &=laughs .1452315_1453506
xxx . 1453506_1454235
that, that's even simpler than the one I did . 1454235_1457203
it wasn't to me, I got confused about it . 1457203_1460835
uh huh . 1460835_1461851
you want to look at it real quick ? 1461851_1462330
I, I, I figured it out . 1462330_1470633
I kept trying to read it wrong way . 1470633_1472656
uh huh . 1472656_1473208
they repeated for both conditions of, both one and two, yeah,
but they're um independent for the uh conditions of one and xxx . 1480488_1487976
right . 1487976_1488281
I kept trying to think another way . 1488281_1490351
ok . 1490351_1491201
uh, let's see for further considerations, it talks about
and we need to look at the two by three we already mentioned that .
yeah . 1504440_1505120
two by two by two ? 1505120_1505918
ok . 1505918_1506951
sounds like fun ! 1506951_1508080
yeah, two by two by two, it, it's a lot of fun . 1508080_1510335
um +... 1510335_1511143
we're having fun . 1511143_1512478
the way to think of the two by two by two . 1512478_1514318
they had it in the book . 1514318_1515703
yeah . 1515703_1516215
with two two designs xxx . 1516215_1519511
right . 1519511_1519758
so, we could make this male female . 1519758_1524693
we could make this um +... 1524693_1529325
they have in here um instruction method and then class size xxx . 1529325_1535875
ok . 1535875_1536171
but we can't xxx . 1536171_1538395
oh, yeah, male female xxx . 1538395_1540100
it's like high and low class instructions . 1540100_1543435
and lecturing and discussion . 1543435_1545723
ok . 1545723_1546203
lecturing discussion . 1546203_1548163
and class average, ten and forty . 1548163_1551315
ok . 1551315_1554026
and this would be independent or uh mixed design, because ? 1554026_1557561
it's a factorial design . 1557561_1560001
uh huh . 1560001_1560418
instead of correlational . 1560418_1561066
yeah . 1561066_1562098
and these are manipulated . 1562098_1563081
right . 1563081_1563740
and, ok, graphically, you pretty much have to look between these
uh huh . 1575011_1575321
kinda like xxx . 1575321_1577728
sometimes . 1577728_1578225
one of 'em on one and one of 'em one . 1578225_1579353
on the other . 1579353_1580201
right, like this would be male and that'd be . 1580201_1581811
female . 1581811_1582026
female . 1582026_1582323
yeah . 1582323_1583058
another way I have seen it done . 1583058_1584121
like this, um, like that . 1584121_1601238
and then you look at the, like that . 1601238_1613093
uh huh . 1613093_1613580
xxx . 1613580_1628635
ok . 1628635_1629555
do you have any other questions about any of the material in
um . 1634408_1635353
no, I think that's it . 1635353_1638185
ok, I have some questions for you . 1638185_1641120
&=laughs .1641120_1641905
two of 'em are gonna have a drawing . 1641905_1644688
I hate this part . 1644688_1645528
&=laughs they're not too hard . 1645528_1649031
why would a researcher ever want to use more than two levels of an
more than two levels ? 1655374_1657496
uh huh . 1657496_1657808
they would, um, it'd be real accurate 'cause it would show if
uh huh . 1664303_1665255
um, xxx uh, let's see . 1665255_1668463
um, they like show partial effects and, um, correlational effects ?
uh huh . 1680511_1680718
I think .1680718_1686798
that's it . 1686798_1687190
yeah . 1687190_1687870
ok . 1687870_1688870
and what's meant by a factorial design ? 1688870_1690966
a factorial design ? 1690966_1694261
well, each variable is called a factor . 1694261_1696335
uh huh . 1696335_1696703
and each has at least two, two or more variables . 1696703_1701136
each independent . 1701136_1701803
uh, yeah independent variable . 1701803_1703186
ok . 1703301_1704763
what, what are meant by uh main effects and interactions ? 1704763_1708946
the main effect is the effect that, that a, an independent or a, an
and an interaction is the effect it has at different levels, from
uh huh . 1728955_1729258
xxx . 1729258_1729971
ok . 1729971_1731841
now, you get to make up your own graphs . 1731841_1733875
instead of identifying the graphs, I'm gonna give you the
so, you have a main effect a, and no main effect for b, and no
ok . 1749026_1762921
ok . 1762921_1764096
xxx . 1773303_1789153
&=laughs .1789153_1789598
um, xxx sd: draws two lines with dots at the ends then scratches it
they're hard . 1832350_1854698
remember this ? 1854698_1855193
yeah there . 1855193_1899105
ok, is there an interaction ? 1899105_1902926
is there an interaction ? 1902926_1904575
yeah, in your graph . 1904575_1905606
no . 1905606_1906775
xxx . 1906775_1908590
xxx . 1908590_1910678
they're parallel . 1910678_1912440
doesn't that mean that there's not an interaction ? 1912440_1914070
&=laughs . 1914070_1915101
&=laughs . 1915101_1915565
I'm so confused ! 1915565_1917111
I got it backwards . 1917111_1918790
ok . 1918790_1919763
that's right . 1919763_1920661
ok, before you start drawing it, let's figure out what some of the
when you collapse, if the dotted line's been collapsed, and it's
&=laughs right . 1932371_1932885
horizontal . 1932885_1933141
horizontal . 1933141_1933941
you can draw a dotted line right now that's not horizontal . 1933941_1937573
ok ? 1937573_1941758
ok . 1941758_1942370
now, we also know it's going to be parallel . 1942370_1945241
right . 1945241_1945608
xxx . 1945608_1948530
hmm ? 1948530_1949456
oh, god ! 1949456_1950505
I gave you a hard one to start with actually . 1950505_1953280
I knew that . 1953280_1955296
I know that, I don't know why xxx . 1955296_1957913
ok . 1957913_1963008
we also know that the b@l .1963008_1968215
they have different midpoints . 1968215_1969910
same . 1969910_1970391
there's no, no main effect of b@l . 1970391_1973686
right . 1973686_1974055
so, they're going to have the same midpoint . 1974055_1976486
right . 1976486_1977246
so, the only way for us to have a same midpoint without having them
0 . 1983766_2010935
that's it ! 2010935_2011348
right . 2011348_2012061
&=laughs all that for that little line . 2012061_2016075
I, I just thought of something . 2016075_2019681
before, when I showed you this td: draws a small x@l and y@l
and said there's no main effect for a, b, and no interaction . 2022498_2024816
I was wrong . 2024816_2025753
mmm . 2025753_2026521
there is a main effect for a . 2026521_2027818
because this is one on top of each, each other, already
uh huh . 2035905_2036496
xxx there is a main effect a, ok ? 2036496_2043576
I admit that I told you that wrong, and should that be on the
ok . 2048560_2051525
let's try um, main effect for a, no main effect for b with an
&=laughs xxx . 2066973_2069683
&=laughs . 2069683_2101496
oops . 2101496_2161321
these two conditions are right now, there's a main effect for a@l .
ok . 2168663_2169760
and there's an interaction . 2169760_2170748
trying to make sure xxx +... 2170748_2186810
their midpoints are different . 2186810_2188360
ok . 2188360_2190303
if they're different, there's not one, if they're the same,
no, wait ! 2202320_2203046
ok, if they're different, there's not one +... 2203046_2208398
you need help ? 2208398_2213800
wait a minute ! 2213800_2214181
&=laughs .2214181_2214853
xxx if the midpoints are the same, then there is . 2214853_2224093
0 .2224093_2226013
I just said if they're different, then +...2226013_2227356
it's not the same . 2227356_2230213
if they're different, then there is . 2230213_2232605
right . 2232605_2232981
ok . 2232981_2233596
&=laughs .2233596_2235716
&=laughs .2235716_2236108
then if they're the same, if they're the same midpoints, then
right . 2241430_2244413
exactly . 2244413_2244693
an interact xxx . 2244693_2244733
exactly . 2244733_2246100
alright . 2246100_2257035
that'll work ! 2257035_2258216
xxx ok, if they're the same, then it's not if there's not, then it
ok . 2271401_2273876
what time does your watch say ? 2273876_2278588
it's ten after . 2278588_2279405
oh, ok . 2279405_2283236
we have five minutes left . 2283236_2283988
being set up on the hour, that's strange, we'd have gone an hour
xxx a long ten minutes . 2291131_2292735
ok, how about no main effect for a, a main effect for b, and an
ok . 2303603_2303995
no main effect for a, it'll be squish, it'll be horizontal . 2303995_2315203
right . 2315203_2315490
ok . 2315490_2316003
there is an interaction for y, that means the midpoints are not the
right . 2321788_2324923
and xxx . 2324923_2331001
ok . 2331001_2331403
xxx um xxx . 2331403_2350481
usually what I tend to do is I'll draw that, that dotted line
what ? 2354665_2356671
oh . 2356671_2357408
the . 2357408_2358136
the collapsed line . 2358136_2359416
xxx . 2359416_2361376
ok . 2361376_2397486
there . 2397486_2406895
yep ! 2406895_2407325
alright . 2407325_2410075
we'll just do one more of these . 2410075_2414481
how 'bout no main effect for a, no main effect for b, but there is
ok . 2426993_2437825
none for a, that would mean horizontal, it would be xxx sd:
yep ? 2446678_2469365
yep ! 2469365_2469861
the last thing I'm gonna ask you to do is I'm sorta, I want
ohhhh ! 2480886_2481588
this is the part I hate . 2481588_2483260
a two by two cell . 2483260_2484763
uh huh . 2484763_2485301
of an experiment . 2485301_2486148
um, plug in some numbers . 2486148_2488756
uh huh . 2488756_2489868
and find out what the main effects are . 2489868_2492180
ok . 2492180_2494948
any old experiment ? 2494948_2496861
