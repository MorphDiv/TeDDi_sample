of whatever whatever pattern you're following . 0_3691
okay . 3691_4155
the last one we added the two arcs together because it was inside the circle . 4155_8898
now we have a different case . 8898_10353
it's still gonna be half, but Leah says it might be half of subtracting them because now you're outside the circle . 10353_17740
okay . 17740_18433
so if you're if you have your what side's it on ? 18433_21345
if you have your b@l d@l and then you're a c@l arc here, the angle's way over here . 21345_25218
subtracting them might make sense . 25218_26656
okay ? 26656_27940
I see . 27940_28570
do you see what I mean ? 28570_29568
subtracting them might make a little bit more sense . 29568_31490
xxx . 31490_32723
okay ? 32723_33196
and now Ben's idea still worked, but it might be difficult for you . 33196_39003
you're trying to get something quick and easy that's a &~gen you're following this pattern . 39003_42418
the triangle sum works . 42418_45321
right ? 45321_45875
but that might take you a little extra work every time . 45875_48986
if you're only given the measure of two arcs that it intercepts, it's gonna be, probably, a lot easier just to subtract them . 48986_58051
boom . 58051_59153
get your answer . 59153_60111
so, go for it Raul . 60111_63118
read that theorem for me and fill in the blanks . 63118_65966
the measure of an angle formed by two secants that intersect the exterior of a circle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs . 65966_75408
half of the sum ? 75408_76493
xxx . 76493_80030
half of the +... 80030_80535
what's it called ? 80535_82820
the +... 82820_88285
difference . 88285_88940
difference . 88940_89308
we're subtracting them this time . 89308_90965
I thought I said that . 90965_92158
you did say that . 92158_92898
I was trying to see if Raul would get that . 92898_95898
I thought that angle one was one hundred degrees . 95898_99686
right ? 99686_100595
okay . 100595_101308
and then in order to find a@l b@l c@l, you had oh, yes . 101308_104940
that was Ben's way of the triangle the triangle sum . 104940_108011
we were trying to get down to that same general pattern of it being half . 108011_111266
okay . 111266_114100
so if you if you subtract them, if you get the difference, that's gonna be a quicker way to do it . 114100_122001
(be)ause you might not always have that triangle working for you there . 122001_125848
that's a little like you're taking you're doing it but you're taking an extra step . 125848_129050
mm hmm . 129050_129668
you see what I mean ? 129668_130479
you're going an extra step . 130479_133080
basically they just want to get the general pattern . 133080_136520
it's gonna be a lot easier for you if you subtract them . 136520_139818
so you do it by half . 139818_141441
divide it in half . 141441_143215
all right . 143215_144473
I have an example for you . 144473_145728
this is +... 145728_150785
what we just did with a little twist on it . 150785_155833
xxx . 155833_156465
this is my example with a little twist on it . 156465_166483
xxx . 166483_171480
given the measure of angle a@l v@l c@l is sixty degrees, the measure of arc a@l c@l is a one hundred thirty degrees . 171480_195625
you have to find the measure of arc b@l d@l . 195625_198613
I like how you wrote that like that . 198613_260323
how did you get your answer there ? 260323_276026
I used a theorem . 276026_278416
what did you do ? 278416_279806
I just used that theorem . 279806_282855
how, though ? 282855_284576
how did you use it ? 284576_285671
I don't know . 285671_289911
I did something . 289911_290463
you did something ? 290463_291045
all right . 291045_291663
okay . 291663_312610
see now I like how you're filling in those blanks . 312610_314701
write it out, show me what you did . 314701_317086
you want to go write that up there for me ? 317086_330256
take your book with you if you need it . 330256_334028
xxx . 334028_347735
good, Katie . 347735_350251
some people had to draw a picture . 350251_352868
that's good . 352868_353355
draw your own picture . 353355_354091
some people like to draw it and write an equation . 354091_357468
either way you do it, you gotta show me what you did . 357468_363403
Miss Lancour, should we solve it ? 363403_365546
yep, I want you to solve it . 365546_367095
Leah did hers with an equation ? 367095_378815
xxx . 378815_389968
she followed the subtraction, one hundred and thirty minus x@l divided by two should give you sixty degrees, she says . 389968_399030
she moved the two over and got one twenty . 399030_402973
one thirty minus x@l equals one hundred and twenty . 402973_405868
so she filled in her blank with the x@l . 405868_408356
x@l has to be ten degrees . 408356_410756
one thirty minus ten degrees is one hundred and twenty degrees . 410756_412723
good . 412723_413765
anybody else want to tell a different way that you did it ? 413765_419381
nobody ? 419381_424100
you ? 424100_425868
no ? 425868_426635
no ? 426635_428565
you all did it the exact same way as Leah did it ? 428565_431651
yep . 431651_432013
that is absolutely amazing . 432013_433848
that is absolutely amazing . 433848_435448
nobody can okay . 435448_436816
I'll let it go . 436816_438128
okay . 438128_440658
that one was the that one was the the nice one . 440658_445450
that one was the nice one . 445450_448720
xxx . 448720_449025
I like nice ones . 449025_450616
not me . 450616_453401
now I don't have to show my work . 453401_454665
no, you gotta show the work . 454665_456616
xxx . 456616_460383
you have to actually do it . 460383_464048
xxx . 464048_500648
okay . 500648_500910
that one's good . 500910_501291
good start on that one . 501291_502420
what are you gonna do first ? 502420_511053
which one are you gonna work on first ? 511053_512323
the r@l s@l u@l ? 512323_513565
yes . 513565_513876
r@l s@l u@l looks like the vertex is on the circle . 513876_519843
yes . 519843_520794
what can you do for that ? 520794_521426
xxx . 521426_526298
sometimes it helps if you draw a picture . 526298_527668
it helps me to draw a picture . 527668_529548
Raul, what are you doing over here ? 529548_549940
well, I don't have any xxx . 549940_551965
which angle are you doing first ? 551965_552740
well, I don't I haven't xxx problem, but I'm doing u@l t@l before xxx anything else . 552740_559701
makes it simple for me . 559701_561075
okay . 561075_561908
why do you think that one's easier ? 561908_564115
why is that ? 564115_565173
(be)ause then I feel like the question would be r@l s@l u@l . 565173_568081
