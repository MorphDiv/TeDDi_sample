this is the Harry <A> Blackmun Oral History Project , a
judicial Center .
this is session number five .
it's being held on November <twenty-second> , <nineteen
I'm a professor at Yale Law School , a former law clerk for Justice
<mister> Justice , today we're going to talk about your
when we left off last time , you described your early married life
I think the last thing we talked about was when <Mrs>
what do you remember about the birth of your children ?
well , I think the birth of one's children stand out rather vividly
it was hot , and I'll never forget when the nurse brought her in to
in those days , all the fathers were relegated to the so-called
they weren't in the delivery room at all .
it was a great day , as you yourself have experienced , when
I'll never forget , for each of our daughters , we have three , and
it took a little while for Nancy to come .
this was our first and Dottie was in labor for a good while , but
the reverse is true with Sally , Sally came suddenly , and Susie
do you think your daughters take after you or <Mrs>
which one is more like who ?
I merely repeat what I'm told , that Susie , our youngest , is very
Nancy is all by herself ; she's herself .
how do you remember their early years of childhood , your mixing of
of course they were happy years .
we were in an apartment in Minneapolis near the Minneapolis
it was a new apartment .
when we moved in , we were the first occupants of it .
then the three babies arrived at their respective times , and it
when Susie arrived , we knew we had to do something about it and so
we couldn't have carried on in the apartment .
had you made partner at the firm at that point ?
yes , I think so .
do you remember a point when you felt you didn't have to worry
I've never reached that point .
I always worry about it , because there's some kind of an
but you never felt that at some point you finally could relax a
I think the answer to that is no .
of course I started in the Dorsey office , in my old Minneapolis
we'd gotten beyond <nineteen thirty-two> , which was depth
but the law office was the typical one , where they would take on
so their theory is , I think every law office's theory was , you
so there was always that worry .
maybe it was intentional to keep us worrying a little bit .
kept us in shape .
now David Brink , who later went on to be president of the American
how did you become the leading young person doing tax work ?
let me say a word or two about David Brink .
first of all , he was assigned to work with me when he came into
his .
father was head of the Department of Mathematics , but anyway , he
David came over , and we worked together for a while .
he displayed ingenuity and ability and , as you point out ,
he's all right .
what did you and the family like to do for fun during this period ?
were you outdoors people ?
well , to a degree .
I asked Dottie about this because you had hinted you might ask me
but we did a number of things .
we took trips together , and I remember taking all of us to Florida
we had a great time ending up on the East Coast .
one vivid recollection I have was Susie's encounter with a pelican
it was rather fun , she was just a little thing at that time .
but we did other things now and then .
I took the two older girls to Chicago because I thought , first of
Susie was too young to go and didn't go .
Nancy went with us to my <twenty-fifth> reunion at Harvard
she was the only one eligible .
the children had to be ten years or older , and she was , barely .
but we did things like that .
I tried to teach them a little bit about the out of doors .
but Dottie is quite right , I didn't spend as much time with them
do you regret that now ?
yes , to a degree .
how about family religious life .
did you go to church together ?
yes , but the girls rebelled , of course .
when the children came along it brought us back to the church .
there was a period of time When we didn't go .
I think that's a rather Usual pattern in young people's lives maybe
but children come along and you want them to have some religious
they rebelled a bit , as most kids do .
was your family always Methodist ?
yes .
both sides of my parents' ancestry , strangely enough .
even though in my mother's side they originated in Bavaria , a very
what do you remember about “Ike” , Dwight Eisenhower ?
when did you first hear about him ?
well , when I first heard about him was during the War , and the
I thought his name was a great name to have on the side of the
after all , it was Eisenhower , you know , you might expect it to
but he was an appealing figure .
for a while there was a question , politically , as to which side
I think he was wooed by both the Democrats and the Republicans as a
I think that was not really unanticipated .
I remember him when he came to Rochester during the campaign
what a great campaign slogan .
along with two thousand other people I met him at the time and was
did you meet him later when he nominated you to the Eighth Circuit
no , I don't recall that I did .
but , of course , he nominated me .
at least the nomination is over his signature .
what do you remember about Joe McCarthy and the McCarthy Era ?
well , I remember how difficult it was , and it got worse .
here he was from a neighboring state .
I remember a lot of conversations that we had in the Mayo Section
it was a depressing period , especially to have him come out of
then , of course , we had in Minnesota the rather interesting
what was your relationship with Senator McCarthy of Minnesota ,
well , I got to know him as I did Senator Humphrey .
they were thrown into the situation when my nomination came along
I guess they had to take the position whether they were in favor of
they were both very nice , very nice .
do you think times have changed ?
you described yourself as an apolitical person .
do you think an apolitical person can be nominated now ?
yes , I think so .
a former clerk of mine , whom you know , Karen Nelson Moore , I
in the sense that I've never associated her with any political
so it's my hope that even after the result of the election a short
we'll see .
I have to ask you about one other event of the <fifties> ,
do you remember anything about them ?
oh , yes .
was that part of your consciousness ?
it was part of my consciousness but not very deep at the time .
how about sporting events ?
at the time there were no major league teams in Minnesota , were
no major league teams , but a lot of activity in getting one .
of course , in the early days , when I grew up , the American
the American Association was one of the top minor-league groups ,
I was able to get out to Lexington Park to see the Saints play or
so we got a little bit of that .
and then the move for a big league team came along , and my law
how about the Negro leagues ?
were they going in your area of the country ?
no , they were not at the time .
I remember the advent of Jackie Robinson .
did you ever see him play ?
yes .
did he strike you as an unusual talent ?
oh my , yes , of course .
and an unusual person .
I can still see him on the field .
when did you first come by the Mayo Clinic as a client ?
well , it was rather curious .
here was this very dominant , I was going to say industry , it
they had no Twin City counsel .
they had been represented for a long time with very able counsel in
I think the lay-head of Mayos at the time , a man who certainly
I was in the tax department .
it consisted of Leland Scott and me , just two of us , and <Mister>
the Dorsey office had picked him up out of Washington actually .
he came from Wisconsin but they brought him out there and he became
but he was ill and was out of the office as much as he was in it in
one day , almost without notice , the receptionist called in and
he said he had a tax matter he wanted to discuss .
would you see him ?
Scotty was ill and at home that day .
that was the first contact that we had with Mayos , so far as a
<mister> Harwick , of Mayos , of course , knew James <E>
so I saw Bert Utz , and he indeed had a little gift tax problem for
we took it on and that was the first contact .
I've always felt it was rather a test interview , a test case and
out of that grew more and more things for Mayos , many of which
at the point when you went to become resident counsel , how much of
I would say sixty percent of the time because I don't know how
it reached a point where I was going to Rochester every month ,
it developed so that I knew , maybe , seventy percent of the staff
and how did the idea come about to have a resident counsel in
I don't know really .
there was one <A> <J> Lobb , his name was , who acted
he had been comptroller of the University of Minnesota and had a
but I think Mister Harwick felt that they needed someone
and Mister Lobb was close to retirement age .
so , I guess that's the way the thing started .
and when they broached it to you were you very receptive , somewhat
I was a little puzzled because Mister Harwick called me
I told him I would like to speak to Judge Sanborn about this .
they were passing friends anyway .
of course , he was way ahead of me , he said , oh , we've spoken to
and I said I'd like to speak to James Dorsey also , of course .
and he said , I've already spoken to James Dorsey .
and I thought I'd play my trump card , and I said I'd like to speak
<mister> Harwick said , I haven't spoken to Dottie about it
he said , I won't press you , let me know by the end of the

if he had asked you to stay , would you have stayed ?

I don't know .
that would have been tough .
Dottie and I finally took a weekend off , went down to Chicago and
I may have said this last time , actually put our feet on the
because I know it meant a lot to her , We had just built a house in
and it would mean that we would leave that and that also would mean
I wouldn't get away with not having her have her house .
it also meant a reduction in income , immediately , as well as in
but Dottie never pressed me , one way or another .
she said , I'll go along and be with you on it , whatever you want
how did the kids react ?
well , I think they were too young to have a positive reaction to
certainly Susie was too young .
eventually we went down to Rochester , and they grew up there and
did you have any concerns that you were getting off the beaten
yes .
wondered about it .
it got down to the question I think I mentioned last time or so ,
and that was the way the question shaped up .
I wasn't entirely sure I wanted to be engaged solely in client care
it would have been a very satisfying occupation all right , but in
he influenced me in that respect , as did Mister Harwick
and that was pretty appealing .

and certainly as soon we built our second home down there and got
do you still feel that those were the happiest years of your life ?
yes .
professionally .
from a professional point of view .
I don't know why I say that .
it's because I think I have a leaning towards medicine .
I like what the physicians try to do , and this gave me an
another thing is that for the most part I remember the happy events
what are some of the happy events ?
well , the reorganization of the Mayo Foundation , I think .
the transformation of the downtown hospitals , which had been run
the building of an experimental hospital in Rochester , which was
what was your daily schedule like there ?
in some sense , this was your first solo office or your own office
how did you spend your time ?
was it different from the way you did at the firm ?
yes , I would say so because I usually went down and had breakfast
really !
+, who was sitting across the way and came over and sat by me .
one always ran into all kinds of people there at the lunch counter
what is the difference between the Mayo Clinic , the Mayo
the Mayo Clinic was the operating professional taking care of
mayo Association was a eleemosynary corporation formed , oh , back
to it , the doctors Mayo transferred most of their personal assets
each of them had the feeling that it was not good for a physician
they kept a reasonable amount for themselves and gave the rest to
the name was not a particularly good one .
eventually we changed it to Mayo Foundation “association”
your c .
<v@l> says that you were a member of a Section of
the Section of Administration was merely a group of us there in the
the medical setup is divided into clinical specialties , there
the so-called Section of Administration consisted of about four or
it might be a Saudi Arabian prince in the first examining room and
we didn't want the physician to be bothered with bill collection or
that was our job .
to do that , take it off the back of the physician , make
for how long were you the only lawyer ?
oh , I am guessing now .
I went down there in <nineteen fifty> .
<one> would say maybe three years or so .
now they have about seven in the legal department , so called .
was one of them Sandy Keith ?
well , Sandy came along .
sandy was <A@l M@l> “Sandy” Keith , was the son of a
saw a good bit of action in that war .
finally , he was due to come back , and we were thinking about
a lot of things had happened , he wasn't the first one but , Sandy
so he came in and we worked together for a few years .
he was a great person .
I remember one day he came in and he always had a political bug in
well , the Section of Administration in its weekly meeting took up
and so let him run and get it out of his system .
so Sandy ran .
he punched every doorbell in town and got himself elected , much to
then the question was , what do we do ?
was that a full-time job ?
no , but it was a pretty substantial part-time job .
and of course it had political overtones .
success , I think , encouraged Sandy to look for higher office and
eventually he ran up against Karl Rolvaag in a battle for the
sandy , was defeated there but eventually he has great comeback
shortly thereafter he and Perpich had a falling out , but Sandy is
your average day was spent then almost entirely with doctors , is
you were the only non-doctor .
would there be most days in which you'd be the only non-doctor in
well , of course , those of us who made up the Section of
we had weekly meetings and sometimes more than that if a major
we always met on Tuesdays , that took most of the morning ,
otherwise , I worked a lot with physicians .
I felt the more I could learn about how medicine was practiced
so I asked for and received permission to attend the monthly
surgical Society was where all the surgeons would have dinner
then it would be followed by the giving of a few papers , maybe two
this was conducted by a member of the Section of Pathologic Anatomy
they were ruthless .
if they thought the surgeon had made a questionable decision , they
all the surgeons discussed it and I think all learned by it .
I certainly did .
I could see the professional problems that would confront the
with Clinical Society , it was the same thing except that all the
again , the same kind of routine .
but I could see , and discovered , what were the topics of profound
one thing , a major interest to me , was that this was right at the
mayos got into this early , not as early as the University of
they built on what was called the Gibbons Bypass machine , became
working with private patients , we couldn't , we felt we couldn't
that was a difficult time .
I will never forget the one week where I watched the last procedure
the first person survived , the next three died , not on the table
and part of that , the difficult period at that time was due to the
nowadays , of course , that isn't the case , and everybody is doing
they catch them earlier .
what was the law and policy toward abortion in those days , in
strangely enough I don't remember any abortion problems at the time
we did have a few instances of , one might call cases with
the major one that plagued me when I was there had to do with
their parents took the position : no transfusion .
and what did we do ?
I would get a call from a surgeon in the middle of an operation who
if he doesn't get it he'll die .
then I was told the parents were Jehovah's Witnesses and against it
well , that wasn't very difficult for me .
we went ahead and gave a transfusion .
took the risk of a lawsuit .
I felt Mayos was a large enough institution to take that risk and
we never got into any real trouble with +/.
they never sued ?
+, they never sued .
I'm sure there were resentments about it .
what about euthanasia , did you ever get into trouble over that ?
well , there was always the problem of how long you kept a patient
those cases usually came up where someone had been seriously
it's tough .
and of course , we have a case or two like that down here .
the physicians were torn .
they're trained to preserve life not to pull the plug , so to speak
quite a few years later legal and medical ethicists developed
did you have similar rules ?
yes .
unless we always were able to determine the status of the brain .
there were no brain waves , why , that eased the decision .
and how did you develop these standards , was it consultation
yes .
setting a policy for the clinic or the entire +...
we discussed it in administration and set up a policy and moved
knowing that there was risk in it all risk in the sense of
+, did you get sued very much ?
in those days , not very much , strangely enough .
litigation against physicians has become much more popular in
there was a time when even the bringing of a suit against a
there was publicity about it .
I think , back in those days the average physician just dreaded
but , we had to get over that .
there are always some lawyers , I could name a few , I shall not ,
I reached the point where the more prominent the lawyer , the more
we went to court on it .
did you file many cases as a plaintiff for the Mayo Clinic ?
not many as plaintiffs , no .
we stayed out of court , but the cases that were the other kind ,
you are later famous in Roe <v@l> Wade for your discussion
did this feeling about the sanctity of this relationship develop
well , I suppose it did .
I've never really analyzed my thinking or attitudes , but .
roe against Wade ended up , people overlooked this many times ,
I always brought the physician in .
and this “abortion on demand” talk annoys me when counsel rather
how often at Mayos did you see irresponsible physicians or
or was there an internal disciplinary procedure for those people ?
as far as our staff was concerned , I saw very little of that .
they wouldn't have been on the staff .
of course , every now and then we let a physician go or he departed
we saw the results of a lot of surgical error that people would
of course , once in a while somebody would leave a sponge in , or
but some of these sponges , they're very small little things , you
there is only one answer to it .
if you find it , you go in , have a second operation , take it out
I always thought at the time those cases were not worth very much
we didn't have many , but we did the second operation without
do you think you got spoiled in the sense that you got used to
yes , I do .
Dottie and I still have that feeling of reverence for Mayos .
a lot of people think it's misplaced , but that is the way we feel
I think it's top grade medicine .
how about psychiatry and psychology ?
you later came to do a lot of thinking about insanity defense in
did you have much exposure to psychiatric medicine ?
well , there was a section of psychiatry there .
I had a lot to do with them , because very often those physicians
it would concern a patient and people elsewhere , a patient who had
often , when there was a psychiatrist somewhere in the lineup of
but I certainly accumulated a great deal of respect for the section
in particular for <Doctor> Howard <P> Rome , who was
one of his sons is now head of the section of psychiatry at Mayos .
his father was a very erudite , able , person who could have been a
one of the greatest witnesses I've ever come across .
I saw a lot of the section of psychiatry .
I remember once I worked on a pool memo as your law clerk in which
did you see that controversy or battle between psychologists and
no , not at Mayos very much .
I could see some disagreements .
of course the psychologists always felt they were just as good as
the psychiatrists would kind of look down at the psychologists at
it's a normal tension but we held it at a minimum .
you also later wrote opinions about drugs and advertising for drugs
I'm wondering whether you developed any sort of attitude toward
there's that old problem , of course .
sometimes the generic drug costs a lot less than the other type ,
this is the problem of the drug manufacturers and of course they
there's some truth to that .
how did you come to feel about the American Medical Association ?
in the early days , I felt it was a very conservative organization
then one of the Mayo physicians , a proctologist actually , was
he came in one day and said , +"/.
+" I have to go to the annual meeting of the <A_M_A> .
+" I want you to come along .
well , what would I do ?
+" well , I want you to see how it works .
I did .
it was held in Atlantic City .
it was always such a big meeting .
there are only two or three or four places in the country where it
I think as a result we shook them up a little bit and tried to
that's not an unusual situation for professional organizations .
the New York Times called you when you were first nominated to the
+" white , anglo-saxon , protestant , Rotarian , Republican man
I guess the implication was that the world of Rochester was a
do you think that was the case , <i@l e@l> , it wasn't a
that was in the New York Times , was it ?
I'd forgotten where .
yes , <nineteen seventy> .
I heard that , of course .
well , yes , Rochester was a very special community .
when we went down , there was the town , and there was the Mayo
one thing that again our Section of Administration worked hard on
we thought one of our greatest accomplishments was to get <I_B_M>
it took a lot of doing .
I well remember when the full board of <I_B_M> came out to
we thought it was an ideal place for one of their outlets .
I guess they eventually agreed .
we were jubilant when they came in with a large complement of very
but Rochester is a special place .
the schools are good , the level of intelligence and ability in the
there weren't any slums there at the time .
I remember our daughters , when they left , said +"/.
+" we enjoyed growing up here , but Daddy it isn't the real world .
and it wasn't .
last question before we take a break .
at your Supreme Court confirmation hearing , you said that in
was that the case ?
yes , it was .
the kids , of course , knew a lot of physicians and assumed that
I fought it for a while and finally gave up .
when one was called doctor , it was kind of funny .
you accept it and don't pay much attention to it .
I might say , if I could go back to that nasty New York Times thing
that's why I was in Rotary for a while and eventually became
it does a lot of good , there's no question about it .
I don't think it deserves some of the adverse tributes that are
but I think I rose beyond that nasty New York Times appellation .
I hope I did .
when we come back after the change of tape , we'll talk about som
