a@l to the third over b@l to the third . 0_2660
good . 2660_3011
number fourteen, Austin . 3011_4396
a@l over the a@l to the five over b@l to the five . 4396_9580
okay . 9580_10058
and number fifteen, Rachelle . 10058_14101
a@l to the sixth and b@l over b@l to the six . 14101_16988
okay, and a rule . 16988_17851
Cristie ? 17851_19090
a@l m@l . 19090_20283
okay . 20283_22078
when we have the variable term in here, a@l divided by b@l, each term is raised to that power . 22078_31971
okay . 31971_33168
we cannot simplify because a@l and b@l are not the same terms . 33168_37828
okay . 37828_39015
now, why I have you in groups, and this is what you're gonna do for today . 39015_43486
and you're gonna present your answer tomorrow . 43486_46460
knowing those rules of exponents +... 46460_50098
knowing those rules of exponents +... 50098_53228
knowing different properties, like &~distibu distributive property, associative property, commutative property . 53228_59133
I want you to prove two things to me . 59133_61098
I want you to prove that a@l to the zero is equal to one . 61098_66988
and I want you to prove that a@l to the negative n@l is equal to one over a@l to the n@l . 66988_74570
this is math homework for tonight ? 74570_76668
this is what you're gonna work on in your group right now . 76668_79681
see if, knowing what you know about exponents, if you can come up with proof of this . 79681_87810
could you show me proof . 87810_89513
okay . 89513_90450
that's what you're gonna work on for the next thirteen minutes . 90450_93266
you'll present it to me tomorrow, in class . 93266_96193
what if we don't know ? 96193_96890
do we have to ? 96890_97345
are you serious ? 97345_97656
yes . 97656_98058
that's why you're in groups . 98058_99626
so start working on that . 99626_100643
all right . 100643_101616
do you need me Robert ? 101616_103740
if a@l equals one over +... 103740_106035
I don't get that . 106035_107826
a@l equals zero is another one, right ? 107826_109525
yeah . 109525_109915
so you're gonna keep plugging a@l in . 109915_116045
oh, no, because lookit . 116045_116556
a@l to the zero is a@l to the zero . 116556_119188
so if you don't xxx . 119188_120731
if you plug in a number it's still a@l, (be)cause there's no one . 120731_122421
nuh uh, (be)cause if you plug in a number, then what if the a@l equals six ? 122421_123803
yes . 123803_124941
see yes, we're right . 124941_126011
okay . 126011_126731
I can do a@l minus xxx, right ? 126731_129610
yes . 129610_131911
you you have the question . 131911_134195
okay, no . 134195_135448
okay, well it would this be okay . 135448_138151
you know, zero times everything is zero, right ? 138151_139671
okay . 139671_140353
okay . 140353_140920
but, if a@l equals one then +... 140920_144235
then one times zero is zero . 144235_147181
like +... 147181_148801
never mind . 148801_150545
you're not making much sense . 150545_151326
never mind . 151326_151758
ryan made it sound better . 151758_154031
I always . 154031_154536
okay . 154536_155903
well, just think about your rules of division and multiplication that you just did . 155903_160143
work out some sample problems and see if you can come out and prove to me why a@l to the zero is one . 160143_167118
a@l because a@l is one . 167118_170283
no . 170283_172076
a@l can be ten . 172076_173108
and ten to the zero power is one . 173108_176015
a million to the zero power is one . 176015_178996
why is that ? 178996_179746
think about using those rules . 179746_182235
that like, just, went right over my head . 182235_187548
yes ? 187548_189706
okay . 189706_190443
okay guys . 190443_191173
he says that a@l zero plus N, equals one . 191173_195620
that's not right . 195620_197390
what ? 197390_198451
isn't that zero, not one ? 198451_201058
that's a@l to the zero equals one . 201058_203068
a@l to the zero power equals one . 203068_205056
zero a@l to the zero, but then it would still be zero . 205056_207756
wouldn't it be zero ? 207756_208578
unless you can +... 208578_209960
because anything times zero is zero . 209960_211083
right ? 211083_211418
but we have to prove to her why it's one . 211418_214536
unless you have zero over one, and then you reciprocolated it . 214536_215985
it's not one, though . 215985_216505
reciprocolated it ? 216505_217885
that'll still be zero . 217885_218605
okay . 218605_220665
I don't get how it could be one, though, (be)cause anything times zero is +... 220665_225551
zero . 225551_226496
is gonna be something that I can xxx myself and xxx . 226496_229381
so then how could it be one ? 229381_230206
divide by zero . 230206_234110
you guys, you're trying to think of terms in things in terms of numbers . 234110_238923
think about putting your rules over here that we learned about, the adding and the and the subtracting rules into +... 238923_247780
if you took variables don't do numbers +... 247780_251413
m@l a@l b@l . 251413_256220
how could you prove something is equal to one ? 256220_258183
what do we know about the rule of one ? 258183_261700
how are we gonna do these xxx . 261700_262601
a@l by negative xxx . 262601_263115
think about that . 263115_263641
yes . 263641_265595
you have a question ? 265595_266163
we never learned these . 266163_266953
the negative ones . 266953_268873
remember . 268873_269506
we never learned these . 269506_271043
oh, I know, but if you take the rules that you learned over here and think about that, you can make some examples . 271043_276821
using either your multiplication or your division rules up there that you developed . 276821_283796
let's see if you can come up with an example where that would be true . 283796_287996
yes . 287996_289476
hi . 289476_289986
since well, why do you have to multiply (be)cause you didn't have to multiply it . 289986_294173
right ? 294173_294476
so it would just be one . 294476_295140
really ? 295140_296220
what if a@l was a million ? 296220_297365
huh ? 297365_298235
a million ? 298235_299268
yeah . 299268_299746
let's say our a@l was equal to a million . 299746_301138
oh, no . 301138_301955
(be)cause it would be equal to six . 301955_302935
huh ? 302935_303348
a million and one . 303348_304701
equals six . 304701_304973
how do you +... 304973_305535
and they so six to the zero power is one . 305535_307868
yeah . 307868_308845
and any +... 308845_309573
how ? 309573_310330
(be)cause anything is one . 310330_311578
well, that's what I want you to show me . 311578_312783
how ? 312783_313153
but if it says like like when you multiply something by zero it says you're not doing anything to the +... 313153_318568
like if you had six times zero it says that you're not multiplying anything xxx zero . 318568_322265
okay . 322265_322663
but we're dealing we're dealing with powers now . 322663_324473
yeah I know, but I don't I don't see how it could make anything different . 324473_326930
so it'd be a@l times c@l . 326930_327455
oh I know . 327455_327878
(be)cause it's only one of these . 327878_329031
that's what I was trying to say . 329031_331248
is that it ? 331248_331513
it's only one a@l because there xxx . 331513_332601
you're getting you're on the right track . 332601_334903
(be)cause it's only one . 334903_335446
it's not +... 335446_336040
start thinking about it in terms of multiplication and division now . 336040_337230
I know . 337230_337968
I know . 337968_338126
I know . 338126_338296
I know . 338296_338440
I know . 338440_338585
she's on the track . 338585_339095
yes ? 339095_339601
I really don't get this . 339601_340566
instead of even if you you were like +... 340566_342073
like, what what if there was like one one times zero, that would be zero, right ? 342073_344520
if it if like xxx . 344520_346590
(be)cause if xxx a@l were a number +... 346590_347496
(be)cause if any number multiplied by zero is zero, right ? 347496_350521
but is that what you're saying ? 350521_351088
that it's being multiplied ? 351088_352360
it says a@l to the xxx power . 352360_355231
so +... 355231_355503
so +... 355503_355783
does a@l to the zero mean a@l times zero ? 355783_358110
no . 358110_358831
no it doesn't . 358831_360061
what does it mean ? 360061_360581
a@l would have to be one then, right ? 360581_362366
no . 362366_362950
(be)cause I can tell you that a million to the zero power is one . 362950_365526
oh . 365526_366663
so a@l times a@l times itself to +... 366663_368118
ten thousand to the zero power is one . 368118_370463
what ? 370463_371663
over oh . 371663_373166
start thinking about it . 373166_374828
you're getting there, Brandon . 374828_376021
start thinking about it . 376021_377465
(be)cause these have to be a@l, they're a@l right ? 377465_379018
(be)cause it'll be one over xxx . 379018_379768
it'll just be xxx . 379768_384073
the first one we're having a hard time understanding . 384073_389001
okay . 389001_389635
a@l to the zero power equals one . 389635_394153
so any number I plug in for a@l if I have it raised to the zero power, my answer's gonna be one . 394153_399995
that's what I'm saying . 399995_401025
now, think about what you can use over there between your multiplication and your division rules and prove to me that a@l to the zero is one . 401025_413948
well, we thought we had it and then we weren't sure . 413948_418783
well what did what did you do ? 418783_419665
let's see . 419665_420088
we thought that if a@l equaled one, then it would be true . 420088_423073
(be)cause then +... 423073_424328
okay . 424328_425335
and I'm telling you that if a@l is equal to one hundred, it's true . 425335_428606
xxx . 428606_429350
yeah, but why ? 429350_431196
how can I get something to the zero power ? 431196_436590
what types of things can we do ? 436590_439291
using your rules up there ? 439291_442308
oh, okay . 442308_444163
start thinking about that . 444163_445005
how am I gonna get that zero power, and it'll start making sense to you . 445005_447950
okay . 447950_449196
cause he kept saying this is impossible (be)cause wouldn't it be zero equals a@l ? 449196_452675
no . 452675_453155
(be)cause what's two to the one power ? 453155_455090
two . 455090_456576
two . 456576_457118
okay . 457118_457535
what's two to the second power ? 457535_459436
four . 459436_460371
okay . 460371_461093
and how did you do that ? 461093_462026
I multiplied two by itself . 462026_465548
you multiplied it twice . 465548_467108
okay . 467108_467573
so here, this is not saying a@l times zero, this is say a@l to the zero power . 467573_474030
told you . 474030_474531
a@l to the zero power . 474531_476115
that means you're not timesing it by anything so it stays a@l . 476115_478701
so that would be one, right ? 478701_479981
well, not necessarily . 479981_481186
what if a@l was equal to one thousand ? 481186_482811
then it'd be a@l to, I don't know . 482811_486891
no (be)cause a thousand to the zero power is +... 486891_490106
is +... 490106_490658
is one . 490658_491106
now you have to prove that . 491106_493058
and think about it in terms of your multiplication and your division rules of exponents . 493058_499281
how am I gonna get a@l to the zero power as a solution . 499281_503753
what can I do mathematically to get a@l to zero power ? 503753_509191
mathematically a@l to the zero power ? 509191_513978
mh hm . 513978_514521
oh you plus plus n@l . 514521_516130
can we use the calculator ? 516130_517745
yeah, you could use a calculator . 517745_518391
okay . 518391_518906
you could use a calculator . 518906_520026
okay .
so so the second +... 520858_522368
put in one hundred to the zero power . 522368_524415
see what they give . 524415_525288
put in one thousand to the zero power . 525288_535273
oh, (be)cause you're just timesing it by nothing, right ? 535273_538631
so it would be one, right ? 538631_539696
or, you just get it . 539696_542145
how do you get zero equals one . 542145_543136
so no matter what number you're gonna put in to the zero power, you're gonna get one . 543136_547520
but using those laws right there, if you start thinking about it +... 547520_552551
work out a problem so that the solution is a@l to the zero and the light will go off . 552551_559378
it will . 559378_560193
start thinking, can I do a multiplication problem, can I do a division problem ? 560193_563880
start working with exponents . 563880_566650
okay . 566650_568030
