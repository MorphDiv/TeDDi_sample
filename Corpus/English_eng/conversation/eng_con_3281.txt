there's r@l s@l u@l . 0_2370
oh, that would be half of that . 2370_3881
xxx that . 3881_5330
oh, I see . 5330_5711
you're finding this arc first . 5711_7065
yeah, this one first . 7065_7575
oh ! 7575_7871
okay . 7871_9248
I like that . 9248_11518
not bad . 11518_13863
how'd you get this one, Melissa ? 13863_20206
that, it intercepts arc r@l u@l , so it has to be half . 20206_27873
xxx . 27873_28686
it has to be half . 28686_29185
it's the inscribed angle . 29185_30758
okay . 30758_31206
it looks like just about everybody got the first one, r@l s@l u@l . 31206_37151
anybody want to tell me what you did ? 37151_38071
Katie, did you get that one ? 38071_41341
r@l s@l u@l . 41341_42560
what did you do ? 42560_43625
since the point's on the circle, I just divided the arc by two . 43625_48731
okay . 48731_49903
because the r@l s@l u@l , the point, is on the circle +... 49903_53556
yeah . 53556_53868
so it has to be +... 53868_55310
half of the arc . 55310_57396
okay . 57396_57811
it has to be half of that intercepted arc . 57811_59740
good . 59740_60045
where is xxx ? 60045_75886
where are you, Margaret ? 75886_76953
right here . 76953_77520
r@l v@l u@l . 77520_78385
what did you come up with ? 78385_79603
xxx . 79603_85785
r@l v@l u@l . 85785_86618
well, think about what we just did in the in the last example . 86618_89648
when it's outside the circle . 89648_92696
you know r@l u@l , that was given . 92696_96626
and you know r@l s@l oh, not r@l s@l . 96626_100040
s@l t@l . 100040_100930
xxx . 100930_104401
so, you have one forty and you have thirty degrees . 104401_107473
okay, you started to subtract . 107473_113496
well +... 113496_115713
you changing your mind ? 115713_116335
no . 116335_118200
no ? 118200_118568
okay . 118568_119008
xxx . 119008_122686
so, what are you gonna do with that ? 122686_123328
you got one ten . 123328_124985
divide it in half . 124985_127765
no . 127765_128248
yeah . 128248_129383
no . 129383_129854
no, yes, no . 129854_130888
maybe ? 130888_132973
yes ? 132973_133568
maybe . 133568_134238
look back here . 134238_134935
what did we just come up with for this one ? 134935_137958
think about it . 137958_143798
I'll be back to you . 143798_144448
u@l s@l v@l . 144448_152668
u@l s@l v@l . 152668_155805
how did you get that one, Leah ? 155805_157481
(be)cause r@l s@l u@l is half of one forty, so it's seventy . 157481_162808
and that's a line xxx equals one eighty . 162808_166095
one eighty minus seventy equals one ten . 166095_169535
okay . 169535_170768
okay . 170768_172303
uh did you follow +... 172303_178895
hmm . 178895_183421
show explain that to me again . 183421_186206
tell me what you just did again . 186206_187951
this angle, r@l s@l u@l , is seventy +... 187951_192168
okay . 192168_193228
that's half of that . 193228_193910
okay . 193910_194470
and this equals one eighty, so one eighty minus seventy is one ten . 194470_200368
oh, okay . 200368_202311
you were doing u@l s@l v@l . 202311_205446
okay . 205446_205805
okay . 205805_206468
at first at at first I thought you were doing the triangle . 206468_209901
no . 209901_212678
the triangle sum . 212678_214411
but you ended up doing +... 214411_215213
one eighty degrees . 215213_218868
(be)ause the line equals +... 218868_220965
minus +... 220965_221293
yeah . 221293_221765
okay . 221765_222828
okay . 222828_224988
I like how you did that different . 224988_231870
I wasn't expecting that . 231870_234420
I'm sorry, that's why I'm thinking . 234420_235468
I wasn't expecting that one . 235468_236730
okay . 236730_238658
good, good . 238658_239515
okay . 239515_241210
we're gonna go on with r@l v@l u@l really quickly . 241210_244498
r@l v@l u@l . 244498_246035
this one, r@l v@l u@l . 246035_252506
here . 252506_252921
that's kind of like the example we just did, and the very last activity we did . 252921_257930
Margaret, go for it . 257930_259351
you do one forty degrees +... 259351_261181
okay . 261181_261871
minus thirty degrees, and you get one hundred and ten . 261871_264885
so, you divide that in half and get fifty five degrees . 264885_266975
good . 266975_267200
one thirty one forty minus thirty gives you one ten . 267200_270481
divided in half +... 270481_271511
fifty five degrees . 271511_273303
xxx . 273303_274726
okay, that's the last theorem we just went over . 274726_276446
how about u@l s@l v@l ? 276446_279336
let's point that one out . 279336_281343
u@l s@l v@l . 281343_284575
going here . 284575_286005
I actually got a different way from one person that I &~w just really wasn't expecting . 286005_290053
I had it one way in my mind, and somebody else gave me a whole different way to think about it . 290053_295078
Michaela ? 295078_296051
I used the triangle sum theorem . 296051_297645
okay . 297645_297990
and we just did r@l v@l u@l , so I know that that is fifty five degrees . 297990_304403
okay . 304403_304716
so she knows that this one is fifty five . 304716_306501
okay . 306501_306826
and since s@l u@l v@l +... 306826_309931
this one . 309931_310698
I used the oh, what's it called ? 310698_312858
the arc intercept theorem . 312858_314081
right . 314081_314356
okay . 314356_314931
to find out that that was fifteen . 314931_317371
inscribed angle to get this one . 317371_319035
fifteen, 'cause it's half . 319035_320361
okay . 320361_320785
so, so far we have fifty five and fifteen . 320785_323483
I added them together and I got seventy, so I did one eighty minus xxx . 323483_329403
okay . 329403_329708
she did one eighty minus one seventy, got one ten for this angle here . 329708_334155
so she ended up with one ten for this by doing triangle sum . 334155_338588
okay . 338588_340586
how about Leah, tell me what you did, 'cause it just I was on a whole 'nother different +... 340586_345955
I was on this inscribed angle and getting the triangle sum theorem . 345955_349955
it didn't even occur to me . 349955_350860
angle r@l s@l u@l , we already figured that xxx seventy . 350860_355970
okay . 355970_356361
we did this, r@l s@l u@l , which was +... 356361_358361
seventy . 358361_360945
because if the r@l equals one forty and then r@l line segment r@l s@l v@l +... 360945_370640
okay . 370640_372530
xxx that line, the the angle of it equals one eighty . 372530_377696
okay . 377696_378130
it's a straight angle . 378130_378943
it has to be one eighty . 378943_379903
yeah . 379903_380448
and so you do one eighty minus seventy . 380448_382126
you get one ten . 382126_383576
and she got one ten . 383576_384080
that's the easy way . 384080_385743
that's an easy way . 385743_386961
well, we didn't even it didn't it didn't even click in my head . 386961_390855
I'm I'm sure it didn't took I was surprised Leah got that . 390855_393865
and last one . 393865_395086
r@l w@l s@l . 395086_396606
real quick . 396606_399191
don't go . 399191_399791
r@l w@l s@l . 399791_402336
how would you get that one ? 402336_403491
ninety five . 403491_405761
she says ninety five . 405761_407001
you say ? 407001_407635
ninety five . 407635_408660
ninety five . 408660_408930
xxx triangle sum again . 408930_409788
you did triangle sum ? 409788_411476
I did triangle sum . 411476_414085
I did was to figure out what arc u@l t@l equals . 414085_417270
it equals ninety . 417270_419058
you do one hundred plus ninety divided by two . 419058_421636
good . 421636_421988
okay . 421988_422975
thank you, guys . 422975_424283
study, study, study, study, study, study . 424283_429090
