if everyone's here &-um my name is Dale Jerome and I'm a volunteer docent is the word we use here but it really means tour guide &=laughs for the Museum of Art . 1555_14315
and I'm really glad to have an audience this morning I didn't know whether I would or not so this is a pleasure . 14775_18995
&-um I was going to give you a general overview of the museum &~short sort of show you what's here and where it is as_well_as talk about some specific pieces in detail and &-um I'd like to conduct it as a conversation this is the ideal number to have in a group . 19675_39495
and also I think the ideal age because you can really talk and give me some ideas and it can be an interchange and I think it's most fun that way +... 40275_48195
the building you're standing in was finished in nineteen ten and at that point the upper level was dedicated to the &~museu or to the University's art collection . 50955_63415
however this was not constituted as the Museum of Art per_se until nineteen forty six . 63805_72065
though the collecting of art by the University of Michigan had started back in the eighteen fifties with professor Frieze you probably know the Frieze building on campus &-um it was housed within the library and so it was technically part of the library unit . 73125_89605
but the regents declared the Museum of Art as a separate unit then in nineteen forty six and then . 90115_96795
I I have a question . 97775_98475
yes . 98695_98815
you said if the second floor was dedicated to the art +/. 98955_101295
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ what ⌋ was on the first floor ? 101435_102295
I assume it was alumni offices . 102555_104575
&-uh it was office space and &~i I don't know exactly what was in the office space but since it's called Alumni Memorial Hall +/. 105155_114075
oh +/.
+, I think it +//. 114395_115115
there's a good chance that it was +/. 115255_116715
+, okay +/. 117095_117315
+, &-uh alumni offices . 117395_119815
&-um in nineteen seventy five the docent group came together . 121315_127695
and we're a group of volunteers . 127995_129215
we number almost &-uh forty or fifty . 129475_133375
we go up and down . 133595_134535
and the museum is kind enough to educate us about this collection that they have in addition to the temporary exhibitions that come in . 135155_143435
and we also take a year's worth of study for a &~semes well two semesters' worth of art history &-uh for background . 143795_152935
it's a very nice position to have &=laughs if you're sort_of an eternal student like I am . 153915_159475
&=laughs well this morning particularly I &-um thought we would start here in the Renaissance and Baroque gallery &-uh and look at four pieces throughout the museum some contemporary some quite old look at them to see what kinds of messages or impressions that you get from them and then try and sort_of deconstruct them visually and figure out what artistically or visually is giving us that idea . 161125_191105
and then look a little bit at the materials that have been used or the media the artist has used to make the piece does this put any constraints on what can really be used visually to give these messages to us . 192785_206605
so &-um we can start in the next room here if you wanna follow me . 207725_211645
(0.6) and we're going to go in this corner here (0.5) I'll get up pretty close to the piece here on the wall in the the box here &-um and I invite you to come close too because it is a rather small piece . 217985_236965
this is the nice thing about having a small group . 237805_240265
well just looking at this piece it was done by Defendente Ferrari in Italy in about <fifteen twenty> fifteen twenty five thereabouts . 241595_252435
&-um can you tell me what this story is about that you're looking at ? 253655_259275
Garden of Eden . 260015_260755
okay the Garden of Eden +... 261375_263055
now that's more of a a concept but of_course we're looking at a &~t fruit tree here of some sort &-um a figure . 265345_274865
this animal coiled around here and it's all taking place <in a> &~l in a garden . 277225_283965
anything that I've missed ? 284725_285905
how do we know it's a garden ? 287145_289185
there's plants . 290525_291125
yeah . 291765_291945
there are plants . 292575_293655
&-um anything else I may have missed ? 294835_297895
the fruit tree ? 299795_302375
the fruit tree +/. 303215_303515
⌈ the water ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ if you look ⌋ pardon me ? 303535_304695
the water . 305735_306355
the water .
if you look way beyond what is the land here you'll see that these hues of blue these &-uh these shades of blue vary a little bit in the background . 306835_317995
and if you look very closely you'll see fingers of green or brown that come out into that blue which I interpret as land . 318225_327945
&-um you you may not you may have some other ideas . 328965_331865
and I'd like to hear that +... 332005_333005
so +//.
and then we have a river of_course &-um that's coming through the garden and so &-uh I think that we can fairly say that this is then a river a body of &~wat a lake or ocean or whatever that &-um is &~the this river empties into . 335745_355485
well then let's think about what signs how has the artist used for instance &-um color or space or &-um &~i the way he's drawn the forms what things give you the idea that this is the Garden of &~Edian Eden ? 357115_379515
or is it the arrangement of things any ideas ? 380235_383055
⌈ <well it> ⌉ .
⌊ well I ⌋ think the snake and Eve are a pretty good clue &=laughs . 384595_387195
yeah +/.
okay we're +/. 387835_388375
+, she's plucking a fruit and +/. 388395_389855
+, yeah . 389915_390175
+, and the snake has the face of a human which implies it could speak so . 390335_393935
and these are all very familiar to us of a Western European tradition or Christian tradition we recognize those immediately . 393935_403975
now we'll see a piece later in the tour from the Senufo culture in Africa where we can't really touch the iconography that we see . 404385_414285
&-um but here it's very familiar to us . 415365_417685
you see the snake and my &~s the snake is the most favorite part for me because he looks so evil in these Renaissance with these you know &~bar well he doesn't have barred teeth he's looking rather chagrined I guess here at Eve . 418025_432225
&=laughs but &-um he has an unruly beard as you can see . 433585_436685
and if you look closely he has spots all over him . 437145_440105
and you may know that in &-um the Renaissance and earlier there were many diseases &-uh which spots were a sign of . 440905_452445
and people didn't know how to cure them so that was pretty wicked . 452885_455845
and &-um so they thought they'd put a few spots on the devil here on the snake as well . 456865_460685
and I'm sure that you well many of you probably have seen Medieval or Renaissance pieces showing demons or snakes where they are very +//. 462345_472285
or devils &-uh personified as an animal where they are very evil looking . 472625_478705
where &-um they have bat wings and &-um are throwing stones and making saints be buried in mud and all kinds of things . 479685_488585
&=laughs so it's pretty interesting . 490145_491225
so we see the snake and then we see Eve here and Eve is shown pretty &-uh schematically for the time by that I mean &-um there's not too much imagination put in to the way she's shown . 492225_509525
she has a nice s@l curve which &-uh makes her very graceful . 510165_515565
she's shown rather modestly with her feet crossed at the bottom . 515815_520315
interestingly enough &-um when this piece went under conservation &-uh they found that this screen of brambles across the front didn't show up on the ultraviolet which means it may have been added later . 521235_536855
and one would wonder if that was added later for the sake of modesty because you can see it covers her pubic area . 537545_544445
it leaves a little hole for her beautiful knees and for her feet but other than that &-um it covers up the most suggestive areas of her body . 544605_554065
but &-um &~u she's &-um shown not not completely full of guilt like you might see in Massachio with you know hung head and and real sin it looks well how does she look to you can you describe what her countenance sort_of reveals to you ? 554905_575405
innocent . 575885_576245
yeah .
curious . 578185_578765
curious innocent . 579745_581385
and she's not totally aware of what she's buying into here it doesn't look like . 582785_589425
&-um she has these long flowing curls and it has been said that such figures as these may be the prototypes for or come from the pictures of the Virgin that would follow though &-uh if you +//. 590605_608465
there're lots_of pictures of the Virgin in here and if you look around you will see that you don't often see the Virgin &~s shown with long flowing hair it's usually covered by a habit looking cloak . 609045_620345
&-um you can see that the artist has tried to give you some idea of spatial recession . 621665_628725
now this isn't very sophisticated . 629785_631185
&-uh because it took us a long time to find the ocean and the water right ? 632505_636745
&=laughs but you can see &-um that he's sort_of overlapped things we have brambles right in the forefront and then in the middle ground we have this garden and then in the background we have the water and supposedly sky up on the upper register . 638065_655005
so he's showing us a bit of space but not mathematically by one point perspective or something like that it's still pretty &-uh pretty elementary . 655545_669805
&-um showing us more in sense in the sense of overlapping and color &-um what are the some of the other things here ? 671745_682305
the color &-um +... 683385_685105
there is a bit of modeling to this and +//. 688045_690205
that's what we say well you probably many of you know this word means the shaping &-uh or the shadows that we paint on things in order +//. 690445_702205
the shading that we give to them to make them look like they're thirty dimensional . 702485_707185
and you can &~say see that he's paid a_lot_of attention to that quite a bit of attention to that on the body it has strong shadow on our left side and then a_lot_of reflected light on the right side . 707545_720525
but where he's really paid attention to that is this circle which he's chosen to frame it in because that's painted on there . 720965_729965
and so you can see I think he's used the tempera paint that he's using pretty skillfully here &-um as far as creating an illusion of three dimension . 731265_743025
and this is tempera on a wood panel and tempera is a little bit more difficult to use than oil as you see in a_lot_of the other things here . 744285_752985
&-uh it preceded oil and you can't in oil you can sort_of &-um make mistakes and then paint over them but here it's pretty much once down it's it's there . 753585_767305
so in that sense I think he shows a_lot_of skill &-uh with his medium . 768385_773285
&-um . 774905_775245
do you know anything about the choice of the frame in the picture ? 776105_779945
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ I don't know where ⌋ this hung . 781525_783305
&-um we think that it probably would have fit into architecture someplace and that's why +/. 784565_791065
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ it's ⌋ given &-um this shape . 791325_793945
and also about the only concept of art that they had at that time was seeing reality through a window sort_of thing . 794405_803845
so many times you +//. 804645_806745
and you were beginning to have great ceiling paintings &-um trompe_loeil paintings that &-um were giving you the illusion of architectural forms that weren't really there and think that's probably what this artist is trying to do . 806865_822305
are there any other questions ? 823945_825785
who &~conserv who +//. 827005_828145
do you have conservationists here that +//. 828525_830645
<I &~don't> .
actually this +//. 831445_832625
we send most of our things to Oberlin College we don't have +//. 832745_836165
&-um actually I shouldn't say that . 837105_838645
in the +//. 838885_839025
in Asian art we have one of the foremost conservation laboratories in the nation &-um but I think that most of the oils have gone to Oberlin if I'm not mistaken I know that large one over there did . 839305_851325
when you were talking about conservation earlier you &~ment something mentioned something about ultraviolet +/. 852885_857245
mhm +/.
+, light what . 857505_858485
they can put +//. 859045_859765
I think it's ultraviolet I'm almost positive it's ultraviolet they put it under a light and they're able to see the sketches or the underpainting of whatever was done if the artist &-uh painted out something . 860685_874645
&-uh and there're very few pieces that a museum would own where you have the backup sketches so it's sort_of neat to be able to see how the thing developed and if our &~s supposition is right and they did paint these brambles in later it's sort_of interesting to think well why was this so important ? 875545_895625
&=laughs do you have any other questions +..? 896645_900685
what about the garden we're looking at we're going to go from here to another piece that's called Garden a contemporary piece but I'd like you to compare the two concepts of gardens . 903445_915865
let's think for just a minute and what do we think of when we think of a garden ? 916445_920785
just off the top of your head . 921025_922445
flowers . 923825_924745
flowers .
okay and here we see flowers +... 925325_927505
anything else maybe lots_of . 931175_932795
trees and animals . 933415_934195
trees animals so lots_of +/. 935015_937715
+, ⌊ flora ⌋ and fauna the the &~n world of nature . 938455_941615
something secluded like nature in the raw or something ⌈ that's ⌉ . 942455_945555
⌊ so are you ⌋ implying that it's sort_of ordered and +//. 945695_949055
or manipulated in some way by a human ? 949415_952115
okay . 952415_952735
that's an important distinction to make I think &-uh because if you look at landscape or garden and sometimes you can &-uh put these two together you can look at it in a very broad sense or you can look at it in a more narrow sense . 954275_970835
how about any other ideas you can think of as far as garden is concerned +..? 972035_975315
well keep those in your head and as we look at the next piece maybe some new things will come to mind . 978915_983935
any other questions on this before we leave ? 984495_986315
alright .
&=addressing_recording_technician well oops don't let me forget I'm connected &=laughs:S6 &-um follow me down here to this installation at the end of the first floor here . 987295_999335
(0.7) .
is that the shrinkwrap ? 1000235_1008895
&-uh shrinkwrap . 1007905_1010085
it isn't shrinkwrap it might sorta look like it though . 1010565_1013285
(0.12) lemme just let you look for a minute before we start talking about it . 1013865_1030405
I'm not sure how I feel about this (0.5) . 1031165_1032685
because this is an installation which is sort_of a new new type of art that different media allows us to use we're no longer &~confor fined to painting within a frame feel free to walk around it you're meant to walk around it and get different views of it +... 1038265_1058445
&~h how do you define an installation ? 1061465_1062725
what do you +//. 1063145_1063385
what does it exactly mean ? 1063545_1064485
well &~it an installation is an art piece it doesn't necessarily hafta be thirty dimensional but it's made for a specific site . 1064835_1074675
oh +/.
+, and though this artist Gina Ferrari &-um has done things &-uh similar to this they were not in this specific site . 1076155_1088335
so supposedly the art piece +//. 1089435_1092595
the site has had an influence on the creation of the piece . 1092865_1097005
are these all sculpted ? 1098505_1101325
well &-um these are not sculpted . 1102405_1106545
this is a very interesting process and I think it really &-um shows how broadening possibilities as far as media is concerned &-uh has broadened the possibilities for art . 1107215_1123235
can you all hear me ? 1124455_1125435
okay . 1125655_1126075
&-um what Miss Ferrari did was use fetal pigs as &-um they come in a box and they're called piglets it is labelled and &-um so she's used these to make the castings from she used a resin and plaster casting from a latex mold and the latex evidently mold allows one to capture great detail . 1127445_1157425
&-um the snakes oddly enough came from a &~tax taxidermist . 1162645_1169685
and evidently I didn't realize this people bring in their snakes to have mounted as trophies and so they take the skin off it &~a and then put another you know substance inside . 1170825_1183985
and so she's working in the same way she could get these snake skins from &-uh the taxidermist and then proceeded from there but again using this &-um latex material &~f to make the mold and therefore capturing such detail . 1184525_1204845
&-um well what ideas do you get from this ? 1206365_1211145
she's called this piece Garden +... 1211755_1213715
what are some any of you offer how do you feel about looking at it is there any message that +... 1215155_1225075
why do you think she might have called it Garden +..? 1226735_1229475
irony ? 1232515_1233175
irony ? 1234615_1235375
okay . 1235375_1235635
can you expand that a little bit ? 1236095_1237435
well because it doesn't seem to be a collection of things that have been fostered for life it seems like a collection of things that have been killed . 1238635_1246875
okay . 1247715_1248495
&~let I'm gonna repeat that just so you +//. 1248995_1251595
did you all hear that ? 1251755_1252695
no .
okay . 1252775_1253415
&-uh it was pointed out that it doesn't look as if these things have been nurtured for life but rather that they're in a that they've been killed that they're in a dead state . 1254155_1265875
so that irony . 1266945_1268045
any other ideas that come to mind ? 1269545_1272665
(0.6) why do you think she put snakes and pigs together ? 1276605_1281885
(0.5) do you see these two animals as being +//. 1283565_1290625
well I shouldn't say one's an animal and one's a reptile &=laughs &-um are they in competition +..? 1290775_1296195
in your mind as you look at it +..? 1299275_1301935
a snake might eat a piglet . 1305495_1306955
okay . 1308255_1308475
that's one idea . 1309895_1311295
&-um let me tell it to you a little bit from the point of view of the artist . 1312055_1316475
I &~hav I have to ask you not to touch it unfortunately . 1317325_1320465
though I think that this is very very tactile I mean I wanna just slide over the top of it . 1321445_1329205
I don't . 1329505_1329925
&=laughs .
&-um the I had a chance . 1330205_1333425
actually I was very fortunate to talk to the artist who's from Detroit &-um for about a half an hour day before yesterday . 1333885_1341005
and &-um she sees this as being quite a benign thing and called it Garden because she sees sort_of this as being the beginning of life sort_of the haphazard arrangement that might be attached to sort_of the &-um primordial mess &~th out_of which came life . 1341785_1368285
and she also looks at it as death so she she &~se seeing seeing things more as the life cycle here . 1368825_1377005
how does she come to this ? 1378985_1383065
well what about the color . 1383465_1386065
what does the color mean to you . 1387745_1390845
flesh . 1392325_1395125
flesh . 1395385_1395545
okay . 1395545_1395605
is it healthy flesh or dead flesh or . 1396295_1399235
young healthy flesh . 1400915_1401915
young healthy flesh . 1402635_1403575
mhm .
&-um she painted can you imagine each one of these with a high gloss paint individually she also cast each one of these individually so &-uh you can imagine that this was &=laughs a tedious process in my opinion . 1403575_1418775
&=laughs &-um but certainly the high gloss of the finish and this very pink vital looking fleshlike color would remind one of life . 1420975_1436215
so what where's the death coming in ? 1436735_1440095
there's lots_of little dead piglets lying around . 1441975_1444955
&=laughs .
what makes you think they're dead ? 1445935_1448415
they look dead . 1450135_1451015
why do they look dead ? 1452275_1453135
I'm gonna push you a little bit +/. 1453315_1454435
they're lying around +/.
+, pardon me ? 1454835_1455135
they're just lying around . 1456055_1457115
they're just lying around . 1457215_1458555
there's no mother . 1459095_1459935
⌈ there's no mother ⌉ . 1461075_1461875
+, ⌊ they would stay with xxx ⌋ at that age .
&-um . 1464095_1464755
there's so many of them . 1465295_1466395
&=laughs .
there's so many of them . 1466575_1468475
so it doesn't they &~s do they seem lifeless ? 1468935_1474635
they're sleeping they're lying around . 1475655_1478035
they don't look sleeping it looks like a dumping ground for little piglets . 1478565_1481845
now +... 1483065_1483405
she would dispute this . 1483685_1486505
that death is what &~o one carries away from this . 1487225_1493305
she sees a_lot more life attached to this . 1493445_1496225
a quite even balance between life and death . 1497125_1500005
and part of it she pointed out was the color &-um but that these are piglets sleeping she's not slashed them open in any way she's not damaged them in any way . 1501235_1512755
and in addition you know the label on the box says piglets it doesn't say dead pigs sort_of thing . 1513915_1520455
I think it's the ears . 1521455_1522555
⌈ the ears okay ⌉ +/. 1523555_1524955
+, ⌊ the ears that make ⌋ the bodies look like they've been soaked in something . 1525295_1527635
they +/.
⌈ formaldehyde ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ have been they ⌋ came from they're the pigs you dissect in high school . 1527935_1531855
jellied piglets .
&=laughs:multiple .
it could be that you and I who have all dissected piglets bring this association . 1532415_1540355
she claims that when small children who don't have this association at all have seen it they're looking at more as if the pigs are sleeping on each_other there's a_lot more feeling of connectedness to this . 1541635_1553955
and sort_of well I don't know whether the right word is community but living together in harmony sort_of thing . 1554595_1562115
what about the snakes though +/. 1562155_1563375
yeah +/. 1563855_1564015
+, with the raised heads that +//.
I mean the ⌈ snakes obviously aren't sleeping ⌉ . 1564915_1566075
⌊ the snakes are clearly ⌋ alive . 1566075_1567355
the snakes are alive . 1567395_1568515
the snakes are alive . 1568875_1571155
right and and I guess you could say that that's part of this life process two different stages that she's showing here . 1571335_1579075
&-um and I don't know maybe we could say then there is maybe that's what gives me the idea me personally that there is some sort of competition between the snake and the piglet and one's preying upon the other or whatever +... 1580115_1595295
&-um we +//. 1598135_1600135
well what gives you the idea of death here ? 1600975_1604395
&~wha visually what what what techniques has she used to show the end of life ? 1605565_1611485
or maybe we've already gone on &~ni into that . 1611705_1614265
none of the pigs have their heads raised in contrast to the snakes and even though they're surrounded by snakes which potentially could be predators they're not +//. 1614265_1623265
not a single one of the thousands of pigs here is +/. 1624225_1627305
⌈ is aware of that ⌉ . 1627785_1629085
+, ⌊ doing a single thing ⌋ about it . 1629185_1630085
yeah right okay . 1630125_1631645
they're pretty limp looking . 1632065_1633105
yeah they're sort_of flaccid and . 1633315_1635475
so the &~p snakes I think many are saying have a_lot more animation to them than the pigs do that are just sort of lying there limp . 1635735_1645035
one of you mentioned the number of things and this you can see she's repeated the snake and the pig motif <over and> over and over again . 1646135_1656655
now there're two things that we could think about that repetition does . 1657555_1661075
one is it sort of vivifies the message . 1662465_1668625
I mean if you see &-um +... 1669625_1671385
a mass grave +... 1674665_1675805
⌈ that's kinda what I was thinking ⌉ +/. 1691705_1692445
+, ⌊ I hate to use these ⌋ terms because she would have a conniption fit .
she does not want to focus on the death end of things here .
but if you see a mass grave it sometimes has more impact to you than just the single dead person whether that's good or not .
&-um so perhaps that functions here . 1695105_1699125
at the same time sometimes repetition can sort_of devalue things . 1699825_1704545
so you hafta think of those two sides that she's playing with . 1705325_1709865
she's fascinated by the sort_of whimsical things &~th serendipitous things that happen to us and the sort_of bizarre &-um negative side that there can be to it . 1711265_1725505
for instance she would look at the piglets and see them as perfectly harmless things but then by positioning them in a certain manner by treating them in a certain way there's a sort_of sinister side that rises to the top . 1726265_1743805
and she's very fascinated with this she told me the story of just looking for stuff to make art out_of . 1744525_1753025
and &-um she was sitting in her studio and she didn't have much money &=laughs I guess at that point so she thought well I'll just use myself . 1754265_1763185
so she put a cork in her mouth and then she started sticking a whole lot of stuff in her mouth and put this medium called Flexwax over her mouth to &~ta take an impression of that make a mold . 1764205_1780365
well by the time &~th the piece that she liked just had the cork in her mouth . 1781715_1787715
and she made a cast of it . 1787895_1789135
and she noticed that with the cork sticking out_of her mouth and the lines of her jaws here when it was cast it looked like a Mickey Mouse boot you know the shoes that Mickey Mouse . 1789595_1803215
so &~th here is a very whimsical thing coming out_of a quite incidentally out_of something else . 1803655_1812415
she likes that process of making those sort_of serendipitous associations and then seeing what she can do with it . 1812875_1819815
in that way I would actually call her &~s a surrealist because a_lot_of the surrealists were playing with language playing with &-um your inner psychological &-uh disposition trying to get things out_of that to use sort_of as the raw material for art pieces and I think you can see this here . 1820615_1840135
&-um before we leave this piece a thing I'd like you to notice is the way she's arranged it on the floor here . 1841815_1850955
interestingly enough she arranged it on the floor she says she thinks people always &-um are looking ahead of themselves they never are looking up or they don't look down so she's making you look down . 1851895_1864115
so it's sort_of a different perspective . 1865315_1866915
but notice too the relationships between the voids and the place where there's pattern . 1867315_1876015
and how she also uses the snake juxtaposes the more solid &-um pattern of the pig bodies against this very wavy design that the coiled snake bodies use . 1877095_1892095
and how she works that into her design . 1893115_1896055
I see rather &~l horizontal lines here with a big void up at the top . 1897895_1903815
actually have any of you visited the Sistine Chapel ? 1905095_1907255
I'm gonna tell you something way off the wall . 1907675_1909755
when I stood back about where that partition is I'd look at this and +//. 1910315_1915355
so you get a real low horizon point it looks like the composition of the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel you know where God is sitting up on the highest cloud and people are pulling each_other up &~fr &=laughs from the depths then from +//. 1915375_1931395
and going down below etcetera etcetera and so there's quite &-um a a &-uh prefigured &-uh level of things and I think you can see this here . 1931915_1944635
in the last piece we look at we'll again look at this use of void actually as part of the design . 1945555_1951675
are there any other comments or questions you have on this piece +..? 1953075_1955975
well I invite you if you have time there's a comment book over here to leave your comments . 1959315_1964435
I must say +... 1965375_1966355
I don't particularly like the piece it +//. 1967495_1971495
I mean I I I would rather not have this in someplace I hadta look all the time &=laughs:S6 but it &~s has this sort_of fascination for me this first of all the &-um the surface of it just does make me wanna feel it and and it makes everybody who comes in this museum almost stop and look at it . 1971695_1996815
so it's very thought provoking I'm not sure she got across what she particularly wanted to ⌈ but then ⌉ . 1998685_2007005
⌊ now ⌋ when you say that she she wouldn't want you know to think about to have people think about a mass grave sort_of idea . 2007005_2015565
that was the first thing I thought of . 2015945_2017205
I mean it seems sort_of sad if she has created something that evokes such a strong association and reaction in people that is exactly not what she wanted . 2017385_2028265
well she may wanna work with this piece more . 2028945_2032025
&-um she did point out to me . 2033265_2035705
and I think this is very true that oftentimes we look for art always to be uplifting and as if that were the artistic tradition . 2036085_2046065
when in reality they were doing things such as Eve in there with these horrible little demons who were making saints be dying . 2046625_2057245
and so there's a_lot_o(f) horror in Medieval and Renaissance art that we sort_of forget about in the getting the truth and beauty end of things . 2057325_2067865
so &-um there is a tradition for this . 2068725_2071525
so what again was it that she +//. 2072625_2074265
that besides the color that evokes life for her ? 2074725_2080045
I think she's just looking at the sort_of disorder there's a_lot_of movement in here I think maybe you could say &-um +... 2081135_2090355
that this is sort_of the beginning of life . 2092915_2095955
hm +/.
+, and that's why I think she's looking at sort of the cyclical &-uh connotations of a garden that's why she calls it a garden +... 2098195_2108475
&-uh but it could be a garden of good and evil as well no ? 2111125_2114165
any other comments or questions ? 2116225_2118165
are the pieces that +//. 2118585_2119325
on there are they attached to . 2119645_2121725
you know I don't know that . 2122285_2123425
I don't know that . 2123525_2124885
it comes down in about a day so . 2125085_2127765
either she's gonna go out with a_lot_o(f) boxes like the art fair &=laughs artists have here or they'll have to cut it up I guess . 2128385_2135905
it looks like this is panelled . 2135985_2137105
this is I think some sort of I &~w used to think it's Styrofoam but I think it's some sort of fiberboard . 2138195_2144455
hm .
&-um I have a_couple_of other things to show you upstairs . 2146955_2150715
if &~y I see that we have one woman pregnant so maybe you'd like a chair ⌈ would any of you like a chair ⌉ ? 2151115_2157655
⌊ no no I feel fine thank you ⌋ . 2157735_2158535
if you +//. 2158535_2158775
we don't have chairs per_se but we do have some stools over there which are portable if you want to pick one up as we go upstairs feel free to do so . 2159065_2166465
and &-uh we're going up to the head of the stairs here if you wanna follow me . 2168105_2172205
how's our time going ? 2173325_2174705
thirty six minutes +... 2175965_2176985
I'm notorious for &=laughs getting into it and forgetting about what time it is so . 2177665_2186365
excuse us . 2188485_2188745
&=laughs we can't be separated . 2189785_2190785
&=laughs (0.16) .
I haven't been up here in a long time . 2192065_2207965
maybe we should stop here and I should go back to sort_of just orienting people as to where they are . 2208485_2214325
(0.8) we hope that you'll come back and visit again because you see a very small smattering today of what is entailed in the collection . 2223425_2231345
sort of to just give you an orientation there're gonna be a_lot_of changes here in the next few months actually . 2232625_2239625
but one thing we will keep constant are the two galleries on either side of the entrance . 2240225_2245765
&-um one is the Baroque and Renaissance period and the other is nineteenth century &~eighteen nineteenth century . 2247545_2255965
because we're a teaching museum primarily &-um we try and keep sort_of an art historical approach and resources available . 2257365_2269025
down in the basement there are temporary exhibitions from our collections sometimes set up with a specific class that's being taught in mind &-um other times just a curator puts something together but it's mostly prints and photography in the basement because of the lighting &-uh down there . 2270075_2290675
and &-uh we do have a museum shop which will +//. 2291975_2295015
that will be one of the changes +//. 2295275_2296295
will be coming out here in the sort_of lobby part that you first enter and then we show larger pieces in the apse where the Garden installation was that you just saw . 2296765_2312005
we've come upstairs now and I'd like to look at one piece in our African collection . 2312705_2317845
this &-um West Gallery is usually devoted to temporary exhibitions there's a lithography exhibition in there now from the Fogg museum in Massachusetts and a very very interesting a_lot_of big names of artists that you will know &-uh but looking at the potential of lithography as a process and that's up for a_couple_of more months I believe and and very worthwhile if +//. 2318875_2347455
but a_lot_o(f) pieces in it so you wanna allot &~a enough time to spend with it . 2347505_2353805
and then &-um on either side of of the apse we have the Asian galleries one Japanese and one Chinese and we have a very reputable collection in Asian art which we've been able to collect I suppose because of the connections we have elsewhere in the University with that part of the world . 2354485_2375265
so let's proceed here (0.4) to what we now call our African gallery . 2376465_2387905
we've been very fortunate in the most recent past to get quite a few new pieces &-um more pieces than we can really display adequately . 2388765_2398145
this is very small but a very important part of the collection so it's a little bit difficult to get situated in here but bear with us . 2398635_2408875
it's hard to take kids through this area because they can't help +//. 2408995_2412755
they're not watching where they're going all the time . 2413015_2414795
&=laughs but what I wanted to do is go from the garden now sort_of to the garden gate so to speak entering this idea of a door of a threshold &-um of beginnings and ends and sort_of keep that idea of threshold in mind and and what &-uh what messages and and ideas come to mind when we think of that . 2416065_2442465
in this corner we're looking at &-uh pieces that come from the Senufo culture S E N U F O . 2444265_2454365
please did I spell that right ? 2454965_2456365
yes I did . 2456505_2457005
S E N U F O . 2457505_2458505
and they live in the Ivory Coast in around here &=points_to_map in Africa . 2458705_2464665
&-um this is a beautiful door made out_of wood ⌈ &-um ⌉ +/. 2466505_2473825
⌊ it's a door ⌋ ? 2473825_2474105
+, mhm that comes from probably a shrine of the Poro society . 2474405_2481005
in the Senufo culture as in many African cultures the teaching of traditions &~s social political family traditions is done by the community not &~o just by the family . 2482025_2499025
and the &~Po Poro society is a primarily male society that sees to it that young men in the culture are acquainted with &-uh the political rules of behavior &-uh moral behavior that sort of thing . 2499745_2520645
&-um you can see on this door several iconographic &-uh designs . 2522385_2530705
you see a tortoise you see what looks to be a snake here actually it &-uh in this case would be a python but also in the Senufo culture the chameleon is very important so you don't I can't distinguish whether this is either a chameleon or Foe the python . 2531345_2556225
&-um you see this creature here is a hornbill and then either side some sort of &-um oh antelope deerlike animal . 2557385_2571165
in the literature it it says that they are antelope &-um but I you know sometimes in that translation we're not so fussy about what kind of deer &=laughs or antelope they are over here since we don't have them in this country . 2571725_2584165
&-um but all of the +//. 2585225_2587945
oh and then you see two faces up here . 2588325_2590545
now we were speaking downstairs in the Christian tradition we could look immediately at Eve say she was in the Garden of Eden being pursued by the devil tempted by the devil etcetera etcetera . 2591585_2601925
now we are told from the literature that these objects that are shown here all relate to the animals who first peopled this Earth as far as the Senufo believe .
they're sacred animals and they stand for particular &-um values in the Senufo society . 2614885_2622485
the only one I could find was the hornbill and the hornbill is thought &-um to be very nurturing and protective of its young and this one would want to carry into some sort of social behavioral norm . 2622985_2637025
&-um so that's shown here . 2637985_2639125
&-um Foe the python &-um evidently is especially adept at communicating with spirits . 2639865_2651345
and the Poro society myth or &-uh legend has a_lot to do &-um with male female relationships &-um and with sort_of surviving on the earth because you're always in jeopardy from bush spirits wicked spirits who sometimes take animal forms . 2651985_2675385
and &-um many of you are probably acquainted with many African cultures how they see the ancestors their ancestors as a &-uh entity that has a a daily influence in their life they aren't out_of their life forever . 2676345_2693965
so and then you have the queen mother queen &-um who is the female who's the beginning of all life . 2695105_2703965
so you see more or less the same elements mythical &~elmont elements across the world in whatever culture you're in . 2705225_2713445
their their design is just different . 2714405_2717245
&-um in the middle area here you see a design that is often used on their figurative sculpture that refers to the umbilical cord <to the> &~s to the womb to the center of birth of fertility of the &-um continuance of the of humankind etcetera . 2718465_2742925
so you can see on both of these pieces which are also Senufo this one especially this pounder &-um where the navel is projected and in a_lot_of African cultures you'll see that .
so this could be looked at as sort_of the web of mankind the &~c the community that's been created by the fertility of the mother queen . 2756065_2765685
it can also be looked at as an agricultural symbol as the field that's been tilled by the Senufo men . 2765865_2776585
&-um in the case of the Senufo this is indeed &-uh quite a logical &-uh deduction because one of their &-um rituals is connected with the tilling of land and so that this staff that she's +//. 2777785_2795585
you see behind here with the figure up &~figu female figure up on top &-um is used in a yearly ritual connected with the Poro society where young men try to be the best hoer in the group . 2795385_2813825
and &-uh this is all connected with dance and music and getting a a worthy wife because those who are not initiated into the Poro society are pretty much outcasts . 2814665_2827825
so the Poro society and members of it and their different levels rule . 2828805_2833285
this is a staff that would've been held by one of the officials &~s of the Poro society during this ritual dance and ceremony . 2834125_2842625
&-um as you look this is just my own observation Africa is such a large country there's so many different cultures and groups that live there that &~f &~t for me to categorize their art is often very difficult . 2843905_2859705
but &-um after you look at it long enough you see that there are certain similarities between &-uh people of a different culture &~e &-uh of a different group . 2860625_2872605
and of_course there're a_lot_of subgroups in the Senufo as well . 2873345_2876025
but you can see that this you see the headdress and and &-uh style of the hair ? 2876545_2883705
looks a little bit the same here . 2884305_2887125
evidently this is to come from the hornbill . 2887395_2891955
this is to represent abstractly that icon . 2892975_2897295
and &-um horns I have read have to do with male power in a_lot_of ways so you can see a_lot_of this headdress is as a horn and here you &~s you see this projection . 2898375_2911275
&-um the other thing is that's quite typical you can see it on this mask helmet mask &-um are open teeth . 2912305_2924945
you can see the teeth the mouth is open and also a_lot_of concave and convex surfaces and if you compare the rhythm pounder here &-uh with the mask &-uh you can get a good idea of what those volumes are like . 2925345_2940905
the rhythm pounder is is like a staff but it would be pounded it's a rhythm instrument pounded on the ground &-um in accompaniment to a dance or ritual +... 2941445_2951265
so here we have a door an opening and can you think of the threshold idea of beginnings and ends do you have any ideas of how this might relate to it +..? 2954265_2972865
maybe I've not stated this question terribly easily . 2975365_2978725
&~i it &~s may not be too easy to understand but what what I'm thinking of is that this is a secret society &-um one into which each Senufo boy would want to be initiated and would learn how to conduct himself as a worthwhile adult . 2980645_2999105
it's sort_of a a citizenship school so to speak . 2999345_3003625
so in that way one could think of this door which would've stood on a shrine that held secret &~i icons figures things used in secret ceremonies as being a sort_of opening up &-um of another level of life for the initiate (0.5) comments questions +..? 3004395_3034195
well . 3036815_3037075
would you say &-uh these figures are bisexual ? 3037195_3039275
because &-um . 3039895_3040495
it is what ? 3040715_3041195
a bisexual figure . 3041415_3042475
&-um because you said the horn is a male +/. 3043135_3045515
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.

+, ⌈ uhuh uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ breast and ⌋ also this figure ? 3049175_3051035
&-um this figure is the male . 3051935_3054435
now evidently they they usually &~sh show the male and female together +/. 3054675_3060335
yeah +/.
+, because a_lot_of this is tied with finding an ideal mate . 3060305_3064845
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um my thought is that this would &-um be the mother queen . 3066145_3072465
I don't know this for sure . 3073505_3074825
&-um because she is +//. 3075625_3077105
she does contain both the male and female in this sort_of &~con idea of conjugality which also exists in the way this is used and were we +//. 3077365_3088765
evidently another design that's often used is the couple . 3089385_3092805
so this is sadly what oftentimes happens in museums is we only have one piece of what it should really be . 3094225_3102545
mhm .
is there anything extraordinary about this in terms of abstraction ? 3104085_3107765
I mean isn't it sort_of surprising the the way it's done just artistically ? 3108625_3113765
well +... 3114605_3114845
I think that two things come to my mind . 3115945_3120565
one is that most of these pieces are made out_of a single piece of wood . 3121625_3124965
so when you think of the medium and you think of all the possibilities for instance with latex molds that Ferrari had downstairs and then you think of a &~th single piece of wood and rather &~woo rude carving materials that puts considerable constraints on what you see . 3126085_3143665
&-um as far as finishing the wood &-um a_lot_of that is done with natural finishes and just use actually . 3144705_3152645
&-um (0.4) now &~h I think this label is quite odd . 3153885_3161285
on the label it says that these people +//. 3161825_3163625
I don't know any Senufo people . 3163825_3165225
but it says that these people have many of the same facial characteristics in life as you see here very &-um &-uh what do I wanna say hard &~l lines in their face and a beautiful &-um lustrous skin and so forth . 3165275_3185355
I mean that's a real stereotype as far as I'm concerned . 3185515_3188095
I don't know how they can say it here . 3188235_3189455
but but &-um so it may mimic I &~i &~wh what they do truly look like . 3189505_3195825
but it's true it is very abstracted . 3196065_3198825
part of this &-um probably is due to the fact that this has so much ritual meaning it's not meant to +//. 3199785_3206425
it's an ideal it's not meant to be &-uh Mister_Jones down the street . 3206745_3212025
but it's very well balanced I mean there's &~tha I'm sure these people have fingers and <there's no> there's no hands and I mean it's it's linear it's a_lot like &-um I mean a_lot_of modern painters you know xxx &=break_in_recording . 3213425_3226405
&=looking_at_different_piece tour +..? 3226985_3229305
how about what are &~th what would you relate it to in the tour ? 3230765_3237685
it could be an entrance or an exit . 3239165_3241125
okay +... 3242345_3242645
the frame <of the first two> kind of xxx . 3245445_3247945
okay that's another &-uh good deduction to make that I hadn't thought of . 3248325_3255145
are there any other of +//. 3255825_3261725
others of you who see relationships with the things we saw before +..? 3262145_3266145
I'm just thinking of the door that we +//. 3271065_3272645
I mean this obviously doesn't have a door but it definitely is +//. 3272805_3276345
or I shouldn't say definitely is +//. 3277165_3278905
to me it is an entrance . 3279025_3281625
what makes you think that ? 3282205_3283805
what visually makes you think of that . 3283905_3289965
let's &~s sort_of take it apart +... 3290105_3291685
the space in the middle . 3295125_3296385
xxx .
okay . 3296685_3296985
there's a void in the middle and a very intentional void . 3297585_3301085
so it really now becomes a part of the design . 3301765_3305625
and this is different from earlier sculpture you would've seen . 3306845_3310985
&-um if you go downstairs and I think they're still where they used to be look at the neoclassical &-uh two marble sculptures on either side of that central &~presitio partition as you come in . 3311985_3325125
there aren't very many voids there you're more focused as you're looking at it on the woman whose dress is being blown by the wind and leaning over with her staff etcetera etcetera . 3325965_3336745
you're not looking at the voids to tell you part of the story . 3337485_3341385
and here you have to . 3341965_3343105
this is more and more usual I think as &-um you you come up into the Modern Era Contemporary Era of art . 3344265_3356365
and I won't go into it deeply here but if +//. 3357325_3362965
I was trying to think of other pieces in this room that might beg for this sort_of analysis the one right behind you I think does which doesn't say much just on a two dimensional basis but if you think of voids and the relationship of spaces there I think you'll find that it's quite rich . 3363195_3387235
also with the Giacometti sculpture over here &-um though it's quite dense in terms of material because of its shape this very long thin elongated shape you sort_of need to see this space around it . 3388475_3406255
&-um in_order_to get the full impact of it and the Hepworth back there is another way of looking at things I'll get into too much of that but I think that that's a fun way to to look at art in a gallery is to take an idea like that and then look at how artists are playing with that . 3407145_3423505
so we've talked about the voids and the positive spaces here . 3425525_3428865
what else makes you think it is a entrance exit ? 3429545_3433645
well the curves up above the lintel the the one that's farthest from you is seems to be the most massive or it it could imply that it's attached to the mass +/. 3435265_3446085
mhm +/.
+, of the building behind the door . 3446465_3448385
mhm .
is there an architectural form it reminds you of ? 3449465_3454085
an arch . 3454745_3455165
an arch right . 3455245_3456145
and &-um well I guess it's on here Arch Margarita this is a whole series that she did and I was tempted to bring you pieces of other things in the series so you could see how she changed each piece a little bit . 3458495_3473455
but one of the ways it was is in the lintel and some of it is some of the pieces are quite a bit heavier up here on top than this is . 3473895_3484575
this seems to be very graceful to me at the top in fact that's why I love it . 3485225_3490285
there's such a lightness to those lines up there even though they are you know well this one is rather thin but otherwise you've got you know you've got a big expanse of bronze there . 3490825_3505145
so we have the lintel and post construction of a door and &-um very reminiscent of the arch and I I'm sure that many of you read here on the label that that's actually what she was getting &-um her her &-uh inspiration from is some ruins in Greece of Greek architecture . 3507535_3532375
Linberg &-um I've had the pleasure and honor of meeting her a_couple_of times and &-um a very personable woman &-um but she lives in Detroit has her studio I believe in Bloomfield Hills and she &~sho she has a gallery in Birmingham and also in New York . 3534855_3555695
she's included in a_lot_of collections &-um often she seems to take this architectural &-uh approach to things and she's made another series which is a series of columns that are +//. 3556925_3574105
that have sort_of &~f very simple figures but elegant female figures embedded in them that are very solid so that it gives one the impression that a &~w a woman is standing there almost as a column . 3574155_3591315
the facial expressions are so simplified as to resemble in many ways the Senufo that we just saw . 3592455_3598755
so I think it's interesting that architecture is her inspiration so much . 3600785_3607145
probably another good reason why I like it so much (be)cause I like architecture . 3607745_3610765
&-um (0.4) how about the weight of this ? 3612045_3619125
you know we think of a door +//. 3619745_3621065
does this appear to &~b you to be very substantial door or not a very or and can you sorta pick apart in your minds why you have the impression you do ? 3621115_3632535

yeah .
oh wow .
&-um I would love to have this piece in my house . 3660545_3663285

she did do a series that +//. 3690175_3692395

+, after looking at this all &~sh goes to show you a mistake often made by people like me is that you judge all of the artist's work by one piece but you gotta go back and look at it all &=laughs:multiple so any more comments ? 3708115_3723115
well this is the end of the specifics here . 3724375_3729015
&-um I hope that I've given you a few ways of looking at things and getting inside of art pieces as you visit any museum and also sort_of acquainted you with what you might find here at the museum . 3729365_3744025
it changes all the time . 3744365_3746325
&-um so it's not only a nice place to come for stimulation but it's also a nice place usually quite quiet . 3747585_3754265
there're not a_lot_of people here to just come in and meditate and rest . 3754445_3758565
and these kinds of pieces help you do that . 3759345_3761325

then here &-um landscape and sort_of the abstraction of landscape . 3866375_3872395
that's pretty abstract . 3873075_3873855
