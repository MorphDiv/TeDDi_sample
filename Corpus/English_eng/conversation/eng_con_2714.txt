The reason why the nitrogen is not freezing our lungs 652680_654860
&=in The nitrogen is w:armer . 659120_660900
Probably about seventy degrees I would imagine . 660900_662580

Three-hundred and twenty-three degrees below: zero: &}l=VOX . 666860_669590
&=in Well 669590_670420
I would like you people in the audience to 676300_678040
(..) To let me know if 679870_681290
(..) Testify for the audience . 686580_687960
&{l=VOX Don't b:ite into it 687960_688920

Oh I'm really feeling sorry for you . 691800_692970

I'm surprised I caught that . 701900_702800
Normally I'm f_try to goof . 702800_704000
I'm like Michael Jordan 704000_704920
But anyway 705610_706000
&=in So 707110_707960
Now the other one stays out here 711730_713290
(..) Where it's nice and warm . 714280_715510
&=in &=lengthened (..) Well let's think now about what's happening to
(..) It's in the &{l=VOX ve:ry cold &}l=VOX liquid nitrogen . 718870_721490
Right ? 721490_722000
&=in So . 722000_722970
What do you think is happening to the ball . 722970_724550
Is the ball getting hotter &=in or colder . 724550_726470
Everybody say it out lou:d . 726470_727530
Hotter . 727390_727820
Colder . 727730_728570
&=in Colder . 727780_729030
Okay 729030_729470
In fact most people don't &}l=PAR . 730960_731830
&=in &=lengthened Yes 731890_732610
&=in So if the ball is getting colder 733510_735220
(..) Or slower . 738890_739700
Slower . 739890_740990
&=in Slower 740490_741490
And that you all concur . 741810_743200
That is excellent . 743200_743920
&=in So 743920_744560
(..) and the ball is getting colder 748620_749760
Or more of a liquid . 753300_754290
What do you think . 754290_754630
Liquid . 755290_756210
&=in A l:iquid 755700_756990
So let's see 760180_761290
&=in if what this guy is thinking is true . 763730_765790
If it becomes more of a liquid 765790_766860
I will take this ball &{l=VOX out &}l=VOX &=in o:f the liquid nitrogen 767890_770710
&=in Okay 773570_774510
(..) Let's see 775090_776010
&=BALL_BOUNCING . 781900_783260
(..) &=in Well this one m- bounces pretty much the same 783260_785830
&=in That is curious . 786790_787960
&{l=VOX Hmm: &}l=VOX . 787960_788590
&=in Well I must continue my study . 788590_790210
&=in Let's see how they react under (..) &{l=VOX pressure: &}l=VOX . 790210_793490
(..) &=in &=GRUNT 794390_795080
(..) &{l=VOX &=laugh &=in &=laugh &=laugh &=in &=laugh &=lengthened
Did it break ? 806710_807960
(..) &{l=VOX No: &}l=VOX . 808000_809300
&=in It broke . 809370_810870
(..) You see 810870_811510
&=in The ball became more of a solid than before 814870_816860
&=in &=lengthened Well folks 817720_819260
it gives you a little bit of an idea of what's happening to our
(..) &=in And we'll see what happens to this (..) &{l=VOX b:ig old
When it interacts with liquid n:itrogen &}l=VOX . 831020_833650
(..) &=in Alright ? 834000_835350
(..) Rather than see what happens tha- there and- +/. 835480_837600
guess at what's happening to these balloons in the container 837600_840330
(..) &=in Alright 844800_845460
&=in So the balloon and its contents 848200_849980
&=in Okay those molecules are slowing down . 852800_854810
They're going slower and slower 854810_855850
Okay ? 858030_858430
&=in You still have the same num:ber of air molecules inside this
&=in It's just that 863140_864140
(..) And look at the balloon . 870530_872510
&=in At the very bottom of it . 872510_873780
You can see a liquid . 873780_874870
&=in That's the air people . 874870_876270
How often do you get to see liquefied air 876270_878150
&=in The molecules have gotten so: slowed down 879200_882520
&=in But now . 889110_889900
The air around it 889900_890710
(..) &{l=VOX &=laugh &=laugh &=laugh &}l=VOX 892600_893690
&=in And so 894600_895520
&=in So that has to be what's happening &=in to the balloons 903260_905960
&=in Alright ? 907810_909000
(..) &=SWALLOW Yes 909000_910250
So I can fit &{l=VOX a:ll &}l=VOX those balloons 918470_919930
&=in &{l=VOX But now: &}l=VOX 921860_923140
&=in The air is &{l=VOX heating up &}l=VOX 927810_929400
And so the molecules are going &=in faster and faster 930550_932840
I'm sorry 938490_938770
&=in And you might want to protect your eardrums . 941720_944000
Cause sometimes as these balloons expand 944000_945650
And let me tell you 946130_946930
&=in So 949360_950450
⌊ &=POP ⌋ . 953480_953730
