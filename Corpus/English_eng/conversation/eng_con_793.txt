&~www .
okay there is someone <in my> not in my class now but in
and they were really annoying because they always useta shout out
and 0 made it really hard to concentrate &-um when you were
and the annoying thing was &-um even if you asked them to be quiet
and they would be even louder .
and so the teachers weren't very good at controlling them .
so you didn't get very much work done .
it's not as bad at this school so it's all right .
