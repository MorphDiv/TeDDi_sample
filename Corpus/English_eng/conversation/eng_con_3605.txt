once a little boy had a frog .
and his dog he was looking at it one day .
and when the little boy was asleep <and> the frog got out .
next morning the little boy <got out> he got up and saw that
he looked everywhere in his room .
he called for the frog .
<he> and the dog fell off the window sill .
then he went outside and started looking for the frog .
he called his name .
&-um <looked in a> looked in a beaver's hole or something there
&-um the dog got caught in a bee's nest .
<he> he was looking in a trunk of a tree .
and then this owl came out and scared him .
and then the bees were chasing the dog .
and then a owl was on him .
and then <he leaned out> he crawled up on a rock and called
<then> &-um then what he was landing on was &-um &-um a deer's
and then the deer pushed him off into a pond .
and then they heard &-um <a> a noise .
and then they looked behind <the> a log .
and then he found his frog right there with another frog .
and they had babies .
and then he left .
and that's it .
could you start with the first page and tell me again ?
well the dog is looking at the frog .
so is the boy .
and the frog is looking back at both of them .
mhm you're right .
and how do you think he feels ?
happy .
and then the frog got out while the boy was sleeping .
and then the boy probably feels tired .
and &-um then he wakes up the next morning .
he sees that the frog's gone and probably is mad or sad .
<then> then he was looking for the frog .
and he probably got really angry .
and then <the> the dog goes calling the frog's name .
and the dog has glass on his head .
and &-um and then the dog fell .
and then the boy looks kind of surprised .
and then he jumps out the window and <jumps> picks up the dog
now how did this happen down here ?
all of this ?
oh when he fell it broke .
and then <he> him and his dog were calling his &-um name again
and then the dog is barking .
he's probably screaming <his> the frog's name .
and then he gets bit .
and the dog is barking at the bees .
I wonder if he's saying something there .
you dummy !
and how come his hands are one his nose like that ?
because it bit <it> bit his nose .
and then &-um the bee hive fell down from the dog shaking the tree
and he's looking in there .
and the dog looks &-um scared .
<he> <he> he looks calm right there .
he does look calm .
is he saying anything ?
he's probably saying his dog's name .
then the owl pops out and knocks him off the tree .
how come he's running away so fast ?
because the bees are chasing him .
then &-um the owl cornered them at the rock .
and there was a deer hiding behind the rock .
so he grabbed onto the antlers .
he was screaming the frog's name again .
there's the owl .
and then <he> the deer got mad .
and he went into the edge .
and he's falling down into the pond .
and &-um <then> &-um then he gets all wet .
and his dog he can hear something .
he feels happy there .
the dog is happy too .
and then the boy is telling his dog to be quiet .
and then they both get up over a log and look down at frogs .
and then they see that they had babies .
and he looks kind of happy there .
and the dog is surprised .
then there <he picks> he has a frog in his hand .
and &-um <then &-um his frog> he's <say> probably saying
and then the dog's barking .
the end
