today our focus is measurement .
ok .
and what I'm interested in for starters, .
is, .
what you know about measurement already .
alex, what's one thing you know ?
well, um, measurement can be like .
measuring the power of like of a nuclear generator or
or like measuring, the height of a person or animal .
so two examples of measurement that Alex can think of .
is you can measure the power of a nuclear energy of a nuclear,
I'm sorry .
measure the power of, a, nuclear generator .
or, he said, a different kind of measuring is .
you can measure the height of a person, okay ?
so Alex has already gotten that .
one important idea about measuring, .
you can measure lots of different things .
nathan, go ahead .
um, like if you're measuring how much you weigh ?
okay, that is a different kind of measuring is it ?
finding out how much you weigh .
that's a different kind .
you measure how much you weigh .
okay, when you go for a checkup at the doctor .
or you're just at home wondering how much .
you've grown, you can measure how much you weigh .
measure how deep water is .
what else can we measure ?
um, and it, .
and try to think of a different kind of measure .
um, measure how deep water is .
because if i'd measured um the height of a person .
like if I could tell you how tall Vanessa was ?
and I could also measure um how tall the doorway to our
are those the same kind of measuring or .
a different kind of measuring ?
same, the same .
I'm measuring two different things .
once I'm measuring Vanessa, .
and once I'm measuring the doorway .
but are they the same kind of measuring ?
yeah .
yeah, but if I tell you how much how tall Vanessa is .
her height, and then I tell you how much she weighs .
is that the same kind of measuring or .
a different kind of measuring ?
different .
I measured something different about her .
ok, so far we have .
measuring the power of a nuclear generator, .
measuring the height of a person, .
height meaning from the my feet to the top of my head .
um, you measure sugar for a cake .
you can measure some wood .
if you're building in your basement .
you measure how much you weigh .
what else could you measure ?
there are lots more things .
okay, so I don't have to tip it right and stuff .
but you're still saying that .
this measurement from here to here, .
no .
is what you would call the width ?
no .
no, oh, you mean you might call .
from here to here the width ?
yeah .
you can also do that .
but I thought you just said maybe with this .
where something is widest ?
okay, what word did someone else use, .
that means that same thing so we can put them together .
so if everyone says, .
so if I am measuring the length, .
um width ?
if I'm measuring the length, .
I'm measuring to see how, what something is ?
nope .
tall and wide .
tall and wide ?
is that what you said ?
yeah .
nope, that was the word that Sara said .
long, long .
let's put those words together and, um, .
so so far we have height, width, and length .
as words we want to think about .
but now I want to do, I have lots of ideas now, um, .
about what you're thinking about that word measure .
how big something is .
but, this is kind of confusing to me .
I have to flip this back .
um, Vanessa, said, you, um, or here, with Jenna .
measure can mean how tall or how wide .
sara says measure can mean .
to see how long something is .
justin says measure can mean .
to see how heavy something is .
kevin said to see how deep something is, .
to see how small something is, um, .
to see, the length, to see how big something is .
so, now I kind of know what measuring is, .
but I don't know how to do it .
what would I need to know ?
I have never measured before .
what is it important for me to know ?
okay, you will have to tell me what to measure, .
without using the word measure .
katy, what would you tell me to do ?
well, you would like, .
you could use like a ruler or a yardstick, .
and you put it at something and, um, .
you count like the, the, .
you count, um, the numbers on it, .
and then go to inches, and then, .
inches ?
okay, I'd have to use a yar, ruler or yardstick, .
put it against something, count the numbers, .
and then what was that last part ?
and with inches, you could do like, or what, .
like whatever number you, .
whatever number it was, like, it was .
well, Katy's steps are, um, use a ruler or yardstick .
put it against something .
count the numbers .
check if it is inches, centimeters, feet, whatever .
then, .
you could say how many centimeters or inches it is .
that was Katy's explanation to me .
that was Katy's job trying to teach me how to measure .
is there another way I can measure ?
I need to understand more about measuring than, um, .
well, everybody's telling me to use a ruler .
or a yardstick or a tape measure .
what if I don't have any of those things ?
uh oh, you got to go buy some .
brittany says that would be a problem .
who can think of a way, .
that that would not be a problem for me ?
maybe the delivery man, I don't know, .
had brought a big box to my house, .
and it's sitting on my porch, and, .
for whatever reason maybe, I would need to measure it .
I don't have a yardstick .
I don't have a ruler .
I don't have a tape measure .
and I am not going to make one of those things .
I don't know .
you need to, you need to tell me more .
about what you know about measuring .
I want you to forget rulers, forget yardsticks, .
and forget tape measures, .
and tell me what you know about measuring .
cuz you guys are just saying, .
+" Well, that's measuring .
and if it is, why is it ?
why is using a yardstick measuring ?
do you all think, .
you know something about measurement ?
yah, I think you do .
I think you know a lot about measurement .
but do you know what ?
I don't think you've ever had to explain what it is you know .
and I think that you'll know what it is you know, .
when you can learn how to explain .
what it is that you need to know .
so that's why I am saying to you, forget inch, .
forget ruler, forget yardstick, forget tape measure, .
because those are not measuring .
those are not measuring .
what are those ?
should we forget feet ?
yep, what are those ?
what's a yardstick ?
tools, those are tools .
those are tools .
tools for doing what ?
measuring .
measuring .
so they are tools that help us .
but are they what measurement is ?
no .
no, so, to use those tools the right way, .
and to make sense of them, .
you need to understand measuring .
those are great .
okay, I remember we're saying, .
this is something that, I know what measuring is .
that's what I am asking you to teach me .
you've got to learn what measuring is, .
before you can measure .
lots of you think you can measure .
think you know all about it .
or you think you know what you need to know to measure .
but, I want you to be able to tell me .
remember I'm saying, I don't know anything .
what do I need to know to measure ?
and I think lots of you already know this, .
but no one has ever asked you to tell what you know .
and if you don't know what you know, .
it's not nearly as powerful, .
as when you know what you know .
tell them and show them ?
yeah .
alright, we'll you're all saying to me: .
+" Yeah, yeah, we all know how to measure .
tell me or show me how you measure .
what it means to measure .
don't just hand me a stick or a tape .
that's not telling me what it means to measure .
what are we going to do with those ?
what, Okay, let's think about it this way .
what are the rules for measuring ?
alex, share your rule to get us started thinking, and .
then we're going to send you guys to junior yearbooks .
okay, um, you have to, I think .
you have to use numbers a lot of times .
okay, Alex's rule, first rule .
that we're going to talk about as soon as they get their .
things and go, is that you have to use numbers .
so, rule one or suggestion one .
you have to use numbers or counting, okay ?
now we can change these rules later .
these are just our ideas .
that was Alex's suggestion .
well, what else do I need to know ?
and you know, that is the same kind of idea .
that Brian got before, remember when Brian said, .
+" if I am going to tell you how to measure, .
first I need to know if you can count .
because if you can't count, .
I think you are going to have a hard time measuring .
and now we've come back to that idea .
you know .
what, if I was measuring, what would be .
something I would do that would be wrong ?
because if we know what not to do .
it can help us .
you might count two numbers twice .
I might count two numbers twice ?
and you might get a different answer .
than you did the first time .
okay, so it is important to keep careful track .
of the numbers, all right .
what else do I need to do or do I need not to do ?
you got to be able to tell me more about number, .
um, about um, measurement .
if all you can tell me is use numbers or counting, .
and keep careful track of the numbers, .
um, does that tell me how to measure ?
no .
how long the um how long you gotta count how the thing
how do you do that ?
brittany says that when you're measuring .
nathan, please move away from there .
brittany says when you're measuring .
you're finding, your counting how long something is .
how do I do that ?
how do I count how long something is ?
like this ?
if I'm gonna find out how long .
the bookshelf is, is this how I do it ?
one two three four five six seven .
it's seven !
no .
all right so then you have to tell me more .
see you know a lot, .
but you haven't put into words yet .
what would I do to measure the bookshelf ?
you could use a ruler .
without a ruler
