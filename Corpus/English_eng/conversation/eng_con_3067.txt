okay it wouldn't be very cool if it was mostly plain with only a
okay so good quilts have pattern good quilts have designs

quilts don't have to have designs to be good quilts ? 292833_295721

there might be um they could still use the same core square um and
is it possible to make a quilt from a core square and when you're
yes . 339660_341063
how would you do that ? 341063_342115
by using the same color . 342115_344763
+< by using um just two different colors or three or however many
but if you used two colors that would be a design because it would
what's my core square gonna look like for this quilt

+< it could be symmetrical it +/. 397103_400571
what could be ? 400571_402108
the um the core square could be symmetrical if you used all one
+< do what you want to and it'll still be symmetrical +... 412596_414950

um Sarah says that a lot of people like quilts to be symmetrical . 496081_502805
why would that be ? 502805_505140
maybe (be)cause they like to have only a couple colors (be)cause
do you think um whether something's symmetrical or not determines
