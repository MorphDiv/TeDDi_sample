so everybody everybody got a handout ? 1985_3605
xxx no .
you didn't get one ?
okay so today we'll be talking about &-uh flows and plant lines . 4965_15305
and vent losses and exit losses and entrance losses and valve losses and this and that and it's going to be an individual assignment so you'll have to do it all by yourselves of_course you are allowed to discuss with partners how to do it but I would like to see your own work I'd like to see &-uh your own setup and your own solution and your own discussions . 16145_39965
and &-um couple other things as well that I would like to see in the assignments that you hand in . 41145_47465
and let me just quickly tell you what those are going to be . 48805_52725
&=flipping_papers well first of all all of us are familiar now I really don't want us to &-uh I don't want you to give me Excel spreadsheet formulas . 54145_64105
I don't want to see any of that you can give me an Excel output with the numbers in there . 64885_68725
but I would like you in your with your own handwriting write down what equations you used what coefficients you use in those equations and how you came about with the solution . 69225_77385
that's really &-uh the main part that I want to see so don't refer me to again Excel formula sheets . 77605_84245
are we all +//. 85085_85445
makes sense right ? 86545_87305
okay now the other thing . 87805_90745
since this is an involved assignment there are little things that you need to pay attention to . 91005_96805
and when you look at it the first time it may be a little it may look like you have to go through a_lot_of work . 97515_104435
but I strongly suggest that once you set up some sort of a formulation sheet or an Excel sheet if you want to for the first problem you can modify it for the rest of the problems . 104715_113375
so the first work is going to be probably a little cumbersome but then it'll pay off later . 114055_119535
yes ? 120835_121075
you'd say that we should set up a Excel sheet for all of these problems or ? 121195_124495
no no just for one of (th)em . 124595_125795
I mean I'm suggesting that you do that you can do it in multiple ways but what I would suggest is set up an Excel sheet (be)cause for instance if you look at the first problem which we'll be doing the the way it usually do I let you read the &~quest question and you ask me a question about the question . 126055_140035
so I would like you to well I would suggest that you set up a some sort of a Excel workbook for this . 141235_147515
okay you have this f@l-s you have your d@l-s you have your discharge you have this and that and once you have that set up you can just goal seek for the variable that you're looking for and then for the rest of the problems you just have this spreadsheet . 148285_162785
everything is set up the f@l-s is set up the q@l-s the head loss coefficients formulas everything is set up you just change numbers in individual cells and you modify a little bit and do another goal seek +... 163405_173925
makes sense doesn't it ? 176455_177555
yes ? 177875_178275
mhm .
and that's what I would suggest but if you don't wanna go through that you can just use your calculator and go about doing it this way too . 179655_186615
so . 187035_187355
now a couple things once you do your assignment for each problem set for each single one of (th)em those are the things I'd like to see . 188055_198055
&=writing:board your energy equations right ? 211835_213935
energy A minus energy B is equal to HA minus HB minus local losses minus friction losses minus this minus that . 214875_222215
how do you calculate these local losses these friction losses ? 222875_225455
what coefficients do you use ? 225955_227415
right I would like to see all that . 228275_229655
what I would like to see as well is +//. 231015_232735
and in these coefficients I haven't elaborated but it's like exit coefficients entrance coefficients valve coefficients and this and that and I would like to see &=writes:board your F values I wanna make sure that you do it +//. 233595_249015
that you just didn't use like a zero point zero two and give me an answer so I want to make sure that hey you used this zero point zero two as an initial guess and then you went back and did this one interpretory . 249295_261015
so I like to see that . 262655_263755
it'll help me see your way of approaching the problem as well and it'll make grading a little easier too I guess . 264515_269595
and &-um so these I would like to see for each each problem that you solve . 269935_276295
and &-um in addition to that you can assume for the rest of the problems (be)cause that's not given there that the water temperature &=writing:board is this . 277685_291125
so this you will need for what do you need this for ? 291585_296385
⌈ viscosity ⌉ .
⌊ why did I ⌋ give you the temperature really ? 297645_299365
huh ? 299665_299885
nothing . 300505_301025
&=laughs:multiple .
⌈ okay ⌉ . 302125_303385
⌊ viscosity ⌋ .
visc you got it .
Ann you are right on the dot .
exactly . 307885_308565
you'll need to do +//. 308785_309465
well you may want to do your sample calculations right ? 309985_312545
so that's what you'll need this for . 313725_315345
okay so why don't we do it the way we usually do it then I would like you to read the questions let's start with question number one read it through and &-um ask me questions . 316105_329905
and we'll talk about it . 330265_331385
okay ? 332445_332685
so just question number one . 333005_334405
&=pause_while_students_read_silently &=writes:board don't write it down yet . 403455_404255
just don't worry about it for now I just put it down to remind myself when I look back on the board . 404935_409575
(0.4) so anybody need any more time ? 410035_415195
shall we discuss it ? 416835_417535
okay any questions ? 418575_421655
(0.6) .
what's the difference between the hydraulic and the energy grade lengths ? 425775_430175
good question . 431655_432255
anybody having an answer ? 433695_435195
(0.4) you look like you have an answer . 439375_440355
&=laughs .
I don't I could look and see if I can find one .
okay +/. 440595_443495
+, <but I> don't have one .
isn't &-um the +//. 445615_447035
well the the hydraulic energy line is just the water level but I don't understand what that means here . 447615_453135
the hydraulic +/. 454135_455135
⌈ wouldn't it mean ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ grade line ⌋ what it means there ? 455315_456135
in +//.
like in an open channel isn't that what it would be ? 456935_459175
but it's not +/. 459385_459985
right +/.
+, this is all closed so I don't know . 460365_461805
okay well how do you calculate the hydraulic grade line in an open channel ? 462225_469105
what's the formula for that ? 469705_471025
like what's +//. 471825_472325
how do you calculate the water depth +..? 472485_473725
it's P over gamma isn't it ? 477025_478545
you want me to write all this down for you .
&=writes:board well &-um it says calculate the energy grade line . 487235_493215
how would you calculate the energy in a system at a particular point at any point ? 493775_497755
how would you do it ? 498735_499455
(0.6) .
b@l one squared .
B b@l one xxx .
b@l squared through G plus Z plus P over gamma right ? 504915_509095
the total energy equation &=writes:board P over gamma plus Z plus v@l squared over PG . 509895_515115
and in every single point in the system you will know the pressure . 516905_521745
you will know the Z and you will know the velocity so using this you can calculate the total energy . 521925_527165
and the grade line that's that's made up out_of this is the total energy . 528305_532385
okay now the +//. 532865_533485
here is the million dollar question well how do I pull the hydraulic grade line out_of this ? 534485_539285
(0.5) what do you think ? 542405_543985
isn't this that you want a minus e@l two over &-um +... 546075_546855
well yeah +/. 549875_550155
+, change in X or something like that ? 550535_551755
right but that's the energy slope . 551975_553815
energy one minus energy two divided by the length through which this energy drop took place that's the energy slope right ? 554135_560755
the hydraulic grade line is &=writing:board it's P over gamma plus E so Doug that's where this thing comes into play . 562995_572195
we have in open channel flow we had a hydrostatic pressure distribution . 573025_576045
we had a channel bottom put those together we have a hydraulic grade line . 576265_579085
so now in_order_to find the hydraulic grade line what you do is you find the energy subtract the velocity from it and velocity hey you have a discharge right ? 579485_590665
q@l squared over whatever and you have the pipe diameter right ? 590805_594265
very easy right ? 594265_595205
that's it +... 596525_596905
any other questions ? 597765_600905
(0.5) no +..? 605815_606015
yeah ?
&~s say you just take &~individ like you'd figure out what values of &-uh E and then a hydraulic grade line are at like various points on the x@l axis ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 608615_619835
⌊ at various ⌋ points right . 619975_620895
so when it says it's twenty meters +/. 621235_623035
uhuh +/.
+, <is that> is that the is that the +//. 624615_625755
is that horizontal distance or is that the angle or is that like the length of the pipe ? 625955_628715
oh that's the length of the pipe . 628835_629855
so would you need to plot it like that or +//. 630175_632035
do you see what I'm saying ? 632535_632835
you'd plot it +... 633385_633785
you don't take into account the angle that it's at right ? 634765_638025
well do you need to though ? 638025_639205
like suppose you have this reservoir here right ? 639605_641925
and is the pipe is sticking out_of here and it's going this way right and &~i it's going into another pipe and here is some expansion going on and some all kinds of stuff and you know how to deal with that by the way right ? 642365_654065
okay so here at this point you need to determine what the energy is at this point right ? 655135_662835
and you know what the energy drop is going to be across this length of the pipe because you have everything given to you . 663475_669615
the pipe diameter the length you have everything given so you can easily determine what the head loss is going to be through here so you can come to this point and say okay this energy minus all the energies here is going to be equal to the energy here whatever that may be . 670445_686165
and you just connect the two lines . 686365_687545
oh that's it ? 687805_688305
yeah . 688485_688745
oh .
+, easy huh ? 688945_690085
but I would like you &-um +... 690405_694645
well I +//. 696485_696705
you need to be aware that within this stretch of the pipe like within this point right before the expansion well you have frictional losses right that's for sure but what else do you have in here ? 697305_708685
what other kind of loss do you have in here that you probably should consider ? 709445_713265
(0.4) can you see ? 716165_717965
head loss ? 718065_718525
is there head loss in the pipe ? 718785_720305
well that's the friction loss right ? 720845_722065
water's going through the pipe it's getting exposed to friction and that causes the head to drop . 724085_727765
right ? 729505_729525
what else is there ? 730505_731845
what else is there that causes the head in the pipe to drop +..? 731845_736245
is it the entrance and the exits ? 739185_740385
exactly . 740505_741165
very good .
this thing is in the reservoir it's entering the pipe and of_course you can see different types of entrance losses exit losses you need to take that into account right ? 743635_753555
well if this is the case then probably a better way to represent this energy grade line would be +//. 754335_760515
I need to know what the energy here is . 761715_763015
it undergoes some drop and you'll determine what the magnitude of that is because of the entrance and then you have another point because of friction <djoo@u you're gonna be right here> . 764295_774235
but we don't +//. 774315_774755
you don't really &~ex want us to figure out what distance that's over . 775095_778615
⌈ or do you ⌉ ? 779515_779875
⌊ what distance ⌋ what is over ? 779955_780575
where the entrance loss is . 780855_782195
this distance here ? 783015_783895
yeah . 784195_784615
oh no no no . 784895_785615
⌈ just ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I just would ⌋ like you to tell me +//. 785755_786975
well obviously here +/. 787235_788295
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ .
+, ⌊ there's ⌋ an energy level right after it enters the pipe there's a different energy level because of that loss . 788665_794405
that's what I would like to know +/. 794865_795705
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and ⌋ no need for the distance or whatever . 795905_797365
okay . 797745_797785
now let me ask you a question right here then . 798525_800285
what is the energy of the flow right here ? 801965_807045
total energy . 809285_809905
where did you point again ? 810945_812125
right inside the reservoir before the flow even enters the pipe . 813885_817565
it's not what a Z is it ?
huh ? 818245_820025
whatever the Z on this .
well how about the p@l over gamma and the v@l square over two g@l ? 820285_824885
that we emphasized .
dadum@i that's it . 825345_829965
everybody see that +..? 830325_830985
⌈ <you see it> ⌉ ?
⌊ so you're saying ⌋ at the surface ? 833305_834485
at the surface right . 834845_835665
right here because right here you need to have some sort of energy . 835865_838025
well okay if the energy right there is equal to the Z whatever that may be so what do you think Bradley what is the hydraulic grade line over there ? 838975_848075
(0.6) how about anybody wanting to help him ? 849035_855355
same thing . 855915_857455
same thing . 857655_858355
right ? 858355_858835
you all see that +... 859015_859515
okay you got that important concept . 861535_863375
so now at this point the energy and the hydraulic grade lines coincide and after that it won't of of_course because the velocity changes and this and that but you already calculated that right +..? 864495_873575
right +..?
okay . 876615_877275
so any other questions then ? 877475_879575
so when we plot it do you want &~u us to plot it like on this drawing or do we just do it on a regular Excel ? 880155_886495
oh you don't hafta do an Excel drawing you can just +/. 887115_889355
oh okay .
+, you can have like a hand drawn sketch but make one on here but have another hand drawn sketch with this and just put the numbers there . 889935_897775
I don't really need to go through it like a_lot_of Excel calculations and drawings . 897875_900755
yeah ?
&~y you said we had a Q but how do we get Q out_of this ? 901075_904415
good question . 905095_906015
how do you get a Q out_of this this thing +..? 906575_908455
how would you set up your sets of equations so that you get a Q out_of this ? 910835_915375
(0.5) .
you just use your HL equals RQ squared . 921195_924155
you got the question you gave the answer . 924435_927135
right . 928095_928335
you know what z@l one is you know what z@l two is at the very end of the system well those two +//. 928875_934455
the difference between z@l one and z@l two will hafta be taken up by all the losses that this flow encounters while it's going down right ? 934855_941495
and the losses it encounters is friction losses in pipe one pipe two expansion loss entrance loss exit loss I guess there's a valve in there too right ? 941905_950465
and valve loss . 951005_951745
and you know how to represent each one of (th)em right ? 952125_954205
so you have an equation saying delta Z the head difference between the two reservoirs will hafta be equal to all the losses <that the> &~syst that the flow encounters as it goes down from reservoir one to reservoir two right ? 955345_970525
there can't be anything else +... 971005_971925
right ? 972705_974385
does it make sense to everybody ? 975325_976425
so there's no velocity at the end ? 977045_978385
&-uh meaning what at the end ? 980725_982025
like this thing is +//. 985265_986305
goes like this &=writes:board and there was an expansion right here and +... 986765_990705
okay what is the end ? 991925_994865
here here +... 995645_997185
is there a velocity ⌈ here ⌉ ? 1001105_1002285
⌊ I guess it &~hav ⌋ yeah . 1002405_1003245
right ? 1004425_1004745
it's still inside the pipe . 1004905_1005785
but as soon as this thing exits the pipe and enters the reservoir all the velocity that it had poof it's gone . 1006415_1013995
that's why we have an exit loss right ? 1014995_1017415
and that's what you need to take into account right here okay +..? 1017615_1020715
right +..?
any other questions ? 1027995_1029115
(0.7) .
so to go about finding the location you would look at the energy grade line and subtract off like v@l squared ⌈ over ⌉ . 1036015_1042995
⌊ location ⌋ of what ? 1043015_1043515
I mean of +//. 1044035_1044575
location of maximum pressure . 1044955_1045755
ah okay . 1046815_1048055
so do we do the maximum on the energy grade line minus like velocity minus elevation ? 1048535_1053735
correct .
well maximum of what ? 1054175_1058155
maximum of the energy right ? 1058355_1059135
is that what you're &~s well yeah if you do a thought experiment since you asked this question &=small_object_falls I mean you could if you wanted to calculate the energy levels at these individual sections +//. 1059745_1071245
what was this by the way ? 1071685_1072225
&=laughs:multiple things are flying all over the place . 1073045_1074585
that's mine . 1074765_1075165
okay here we go . 1075285_1076145
&=laughs okay now you have &-um +//. 1076805_1082465
what you can do is you can plot this grade line energy grade line you can plot the hydraulic grade line pick the maximum point and say well that's the maximum pressure right ? 1083155_1094255
because the hydraulic grade line minus the z@l elevation that you can easily calculate because we've given you everything like the numbers on this paper zero three thirteen eight those are all in nearest elevations . 1094675_1107175
so you know what the elevations are using those you can calculate the pressure . 1107695_1110875
you can either do that or before you even start doing that you can look at this equation &=writes:board right ? 1111385_1119165
and this equation will tell you so to speak where you should see the maximum pressure occur right ? 1119405_1126645
right ? 1127865_1128165
but then you'd need the velocity at every every point right ? 1129805_1133325
&=writes:board well <the velocity here and> the velocity here and the velocity here are the same . 1134025_1138065
so you need to have the +//. 1138635_1139695
you need to know the velocity here you need to know the velocity here . 1140695_1142375
and of_course you need to know the energies right here because here you have undergone certain types of transitions right ? 1143575_1150335
so you know suppose you know the energy at each section right before and right after some sort of a transition something that causes a head drop . 1151015_1163235
you know the energy at those locations . 1164035_1165775
and you would like to know what the +... 1166935_1169535
maximum pressure is +... 1170495_1173275
so the location that has in order for this to be maximum for a given energy level for this to be maximum what do these two hafta be ? 1178015_1191015
as small as possible . 1191655_1192675
as small as possible . 1192855_1193835
so this doesn't necessarily mean that +... 1195035_1198415
where is this small in the system ? 1200415_1202915
at the end of the run anywhere where the well zero . 1203335_1207475
right anywhere <where this> where this &=laughs:SUm big thing starts so you probably need to look for the maximum pressure right here somewhere right ? 1208115_1215295
but the question is well this hasta be minimum but this hasta be quite small too and that's the task that you need to undertake . 1216195_1223955
well where is the velocity the smallest ? 1224755_1227415
isn't it +//. 1227915_1228375
but didn't you already answer that because we know at the end it's zero ? 1228615_1232075
at the very end it's +//. 1233835_1234835
well inside the reservoir it's zero . 1235195_1237255
right . 1237455_1237695
but inside the reservoir you know what the maximum pressure is . 1237875_1240315
right . 1240975_1241595
right ? 1241835_1242115
so is there another place that the pressure is even higher than this ? 1242995_1245715
before the &~expan the exit expansion . 1247495_1249475
is that what you mean ? 1250595_1251155
right here you mean ? 1251355_1252115
no I'm just that's what you're saying okay . 1252575_1256595
the energy here and the energy here are different +/. 1256935_1258735
mhm +/.
+, right ? 1260035_1260055
and this is what you need to take into account as well right ? 1260575_1265955
so I would like you to tell me taking the energy and the velocity into account where this term is the biggest . 1263855_1272295
well where are we +//. 1273895_1275595
how are we figuring that out to begin with to solve the energy equation ? 1275775_1278315
p@l over gamma .
you know what the energy is going to be right ? 1280335_1284895
you know what the energy is going to be here here &-um and then if this is the valve right before the valve right after the valve and right before the entrance into &~th into the reservoir and at the reservoir you know that the +//. 1284945_1297405
what the energy values are there . 1297525_1298885
but I thought we knew what those were +/. 1299465_1300685
⌈ because ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ because ⌋ of that equation . 1301045_1302205
&=laughs:multiple .
okay let's back up here . 1304485_1305885
okay &=laughs .
alright now forget about the energy +... 1305945_1309945
&=writes:board you would like to calculate the discharge through the system +... 1312035_1316335
how would you do it ? 1318715_1319835
(0.6) yes ? 1320655_1325815
well with the head loss equations . 1326455_1329335
&=writes:board exactly . 1329655_1329915
you have a delta z@l z@l one z@l two is equal to all the head losses . 1330515_1338835
local head losses valve head losses exit head losses entrance head losses friction head losses so you have an equation that is a function of Q it's like R times q@l square K times q@l square and all that right ? 1340025_1354765
so in the end the only unknown is a Q . 1354965_1358665
this is known the only unknown is a Q you pull a Q out_of it right ? 1360125_1363865
you can do that easily . 1364025_1365085
now you have a Q +... 1366045_1367105
well look at this now +... 1369245_1370225
you wanna calculate the energy at this point suppose as an example . 1373025_1380125
you know what the energy at this point is agreed ? 1381705_1384205
you know that there's an entrance into the pipe so there hasta be some loss associated with that and you know how to represent that too don't you +..? 1384805_1393485
the hot loss let's call this entrance +... 1396275_1398715
is going to be equal to what ? 1401215_1402115
help me out here +... 1403975_1405535
what is it equal to +..? 1406575_1407095
P of the entrance times q@l squared over two g@l ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 1411395_1413935
⌊ exactly ⌋ . 1414375_1414755
well &~tim K times v@l squared over two g@l and you can represent this in terms of AQ squared g@l pi squared D over four you can do that right ? 1415715_1424255
so well guess what ? 1424615_1427015
I just calculated this I know what the velocity is because I know what the discharge is I know what the pipe diameter is . 1427275_1432335
I know what the velocity is agreed ? 1432895_1434015
well I know what the velocity is I know what K is because of whatever type of entrance I have here well I can easily calculate an HL entrance right ? 1434955_1444735
so this total energy minus this head loss is the new energy level right here . 1445355_1454915
and look at this now . 1456455_1457275
what is the energy at this point ? 1458515_1460335
is the next question because you wanna go step by step . 1461425_1463845
well what is it ? 1464845_1465825
how would you calculate that ? 1465925_1466805
(0.4) .
minus RQ squared .
RQ squared and R is F times L over D &~ti well that's it right ? 1470065_1476685
F times L over D over two g@l whatever . 1476745_1479385
yeah +/.
+, so you can do that too and you have Q as well . 1479725_1482885
multiply this whole R which is a function of the pipe diameter pipe plane or whatever it is times the Q that you just calculated it'll give you another H agreed +..? 1483605_1494725
&=writes:board right H friction is equal to F times L over D times one over QG times v@l squared . 1495485_1504865
well this whole thing you know it's given . 1506045_1512485
this you just calculated because you know what the discharge is knowing the diameter you know what the velocity is you have the xxx already . 1510975_1520295
so the energy here minus this entire friction is going to give you a new energy level right ? 1521115_1529495
right ? 1530575_1531655
and this +//. 1532275_1534715
that's basically what you do <throughout the> throughout the system . 1535055_1537395
once you've got Q everything is all taken care of +... 1538845_1542385
are we clear so far ? 1543945_1544745
before I even build on this +... 1545125_1546065
yes ? 1548085_1548685
no +..? 1548925_1549085
now I want to know where the maximum pressure occurs right ? 1550225_1556965
then I refer to this equation . 1558705_1561065
in this equation as you can see I know the velocity at each single location right ? 1562575_1567615
no problem . 1567775_1568955
well I know what Z is it's given to me the only thing that I don't know +... 1569935_1575035
is this . 1575855_1577655
I know the energy as well I just calculated it right +..? 1577975_1579995
so I know the energy at each section <this section> this section <this section> <this section> this section and here . 1581955_1588235
I know the energy . 1588635_1589335
I know the velocity I know Z . 1590105_1592025
only thing that I don't know is P . 1592585_1594225
pull P out_of it . 1594585_1595425
look at the P distribution and tell me hey among this P distribution this is obviously the biggest so this is the answer +... 1596305_1603645
right ?
(0.4) are we okay on this ? 1605845_1610925
are we too fast too slow ? 1611725_1613705
(0.4) yes ? 1615945_1617925
yes . 1618185_1618545
yes .
yes .
okay let me ask you a question . 1621085_1624045
well before I ask you this question though for this problem for this particular problem in addition to what we just talked about that I would like to see I also would like to see these here . 1625485_1634665
I would like you to tell me what your delta h@l is that you used for your calculations delta h@l meaning the energy difference between those two reservoirs what energy difference did she use ? 1635945_1645105
I'd like to see that . 1645505_1645985
I would like you to tell me what VC one squared two xxx v@l two squared over two GR . 1647485_1651645
trivial once you have Q and you know the diameter of the two pipes just ratio them and give me this value +... 1652245_1658425
so I would like to see numerical values for these obviously we need to see Q that's what you're asked anyways . 1660385_1665305
now I also would like to see when you do your P calculations I don't really care if you do it in terms of P over gamma or if you change it to P like this +//. 1666905_1676805
the value that you calculate multiply it by gamma or not I don't really +//. 1677205_1679605
it doesn't matter to me . 1679965_1680645
just gimme a P value maximum P value +... 1681005_1684285
okay ? 1685025_1686965
I want to see those . 1687365_1688185
in nice little circles or boxes right . 1689265_1691005
okay now before we move on I would like to ask you one more question just to see that you are &-um on the same wavelength here . 1692015_1701695
well it says a new commercial steel pipe . 1702375_1705915
why would I bother giving you this ? 1707295_1709195
have they ever talked about a pipe a steel pipe in here ? 1710415_1714575
(0.6) .
you have to estimate the friction losses . 1720565_1723025
exactly +...
<what did he say> ?
huh ?
&=whispers friction losses &=laughs .
&=whispers friction losses . 1723965_1728465
now now so in that friction losses in the friction loss storm we had this thing called KS equivalent roughness . 1729105_1738465
now you need to know what that is otherwise how are you gonna estimate the friction loss ? 1739565_1743125
and this is what that is for . 1743745_1745425
I would like you to pick a roughness coefficient that corresponds to a new commercial steel pipe . 1746305_1752605
and the way you get that is I think every group maybe not every individual but every group has this book +... 1753965_1759505
I think it's in the other book as well . 1760505_1762925
it's pretty much standard but in here it's on I looked it up for you guys . 1763565_1774445
on page thirty twenty two there is a Moody diagram and on that Moody diagram this is the Moody diagram we are all familiar with and right here is the small box and that gives all the &-uh coefficients that you would need but please be +//. 1768345_1782825
&~m make sure that you keep the right unit it's meters and feet +... 1783525_1787005
time to move on right ? 1789625_1790525
unless there are any other questions +..? 1791925_1793505
okay +... 1794285_1795765
number two so <why don't you &~re> do number two . 1797945_1802505
(1.10) look up if you're done so that I can see +... 1883105_1883885
wow everybody's done okay anybody need any more time +..? 1885905_1889545
alright so any questions about number two then ? 1891425_1894025
(0.5) we just discussed it in class too I guess right so that hopefully helps clarify the question a little more . 1896325_1904845
so you want the discharge in each pipe section ? 1906005_1908225
very good question yeah like (be)cause the system has like three sections right ? 1909925_1913385
so you have three discharges which one do I wanna see ? 1913625_1916045
well I would like to see all of_course so &=laughs but <if you give me> &~just if you give me the discharge in branch one and discharge in branch two that should suffice because the sum of (th)em is going to be the discharge in branch three right ? 1916405_1930325
(0.4) any other questions ? 1930945_1935965
how about figuring out initial Q again . 1939605_1942045
huh ?
how about figuring out &=laughs initial Q again . 1942145_1944165
it's using the head like the head loss of the tank or something ? 1944345_1947585
well you need to +//. 1948725_1949405
all is based on this +//. 1949725_1950625
this energy equation that we just talked about right ? 1951205_1952825
this delta h@l difference it's &~cu because that is equal to whatever head losses the flow encounters right ? 1953045_1959645
well +... 1960565_1961345
let's +//.
how would you write an energy difference equation for this ? 1963305_1966345
(be)cause we don't have two reservoirs anymore but one of the ends is open to the atmosphere so how would you write your energy equation +..? 1967005_1974205
what is E e@l one ? 1977465_1978405
call this section one let me just do it on the board +... 1978565_1996985
&=goes_to_board now in order for us to be able to even solve this question again we use our energy principle e@l one minus e@l two is equal to all the head losses that the flow encounters as it moves from one to two right ? 1984235_1996215
okay +... 1996855_1997595
&=writes:board e@l one goes through a piping system like this well since this is where this whole thing terminates while this is e@l two right ? 1999695_2013975
what is e@l one Jeffrey what do you think ? 2013165_2015645
help me with this . 2016505_2017385
(0.6) .
well your Z is one thousand . 2018565_2026265
so E is one thousand ? 2026545_2028245
yes . 2028505_2029905
well how about +//. 2030545_2031565
so we know that e@l one minus e@l two is equal to the sum of all the head losses that this thing encounters as it moves down in the pipe . 2032325_2039545
well we just determined that e@l one is equal to a thousand feet well +... 2041115_2046495
what is e@l two do you think ? 2048355_2049595
(0.5) .
nine twenty nine twenty . 2052175_2059095
nine twenty . 2059255_2060115
plus your +... 2060115_2060535
P over gamma term . 2061775_2063295
very good P over gamma and ? 2064835_2066295
plus your v@l squared G term . 2066555_2069275
well since you told me this statement let me ask you a question . 2070875_2073735
what is this ? 2074635_2075115
(0.9) .
it's zero isn't it ?
why ? 2081735_2085595
⌈ I'm not sure ⌉ .
&=laughs .
⌊ it's atmospheric ⌋ .
that's the answer .
(be)cause it's open to the atmosphere .
it's open to the atmosphere . 2088615_2090955
zero . 2092115_2092575
and the velocity is what is the velocity ? 2093255_2096275
it's Q over A .
exactly .
<what A> what A ? 2100235_2100915
&~w well the A of the pipe right ? 2100915_2102915
right +/. 2103015_2103215
⌈ okay then ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ before the ⌋ exits right . 2103455_2104315
(be)cause after it exits there there's &-uh no pipe there's like something something there we don't care about that . 2104475_2109915
so <this is the> &~ener this is the equation that you have and this did you have a question by the way Ann ? 2110235_2117295
no . 2117535_2117795
okay . 2118015_2118215
and this is equal to all the head losses that the system encounters . 2118975_2123655
right ? 2124675_2124835
now &=writes:board this is &~w if I call this one this two this three this four right ? 2125845_2133445
I just want to call it that way and this is equal to h@l friction one plus h@l friction two plus h@l friction three plus h@l friction four right +..? 2133845_2150225
right ? 2153705_2155825
(0.6) no &=laughs fooled you all . 2159635_2162275
what's what's happening here ? 2162795_2164955
(0.16) okay imagine a fluid particle it's moving down right ? 2166915_2185835
marching down the pipe while it's marching down the pipe it's encountering all these things in the bottom <of the> of the pipe so <it's losing energy> it's losing energy it's coming to this point right here . 2185845_2196005
suppose it chooses path +//. 2196505_2200145
well it can't choose two paths right ? 2200305_2201965
it's just one little creature it can't divide itself into two it'll die . 2202045_2204805
so it'll choose this path . 2205585_2206705
and it goes down here it goes up reaches the end of the pipe . 2207505_2211485
how much energy has this little thing encountered ? 2212375_2214175
how much energy loss ? 2214715_2217015
(0.4) .
HF one plus HF two . 2220315_2221795
say it again . 2222595_2223155
the HF one plus HF two . 2223915_2225855
h@l one plus HF two plus four . 2225995_2228495
oh okay . 2228755_2229335
that's it . 2230635_2231755
it didn't even see this pipe right ? 2232315_2235355
but the particle could have also instead of choosing this path chosen the other path and then the energy loss we can use two sections without doing this minus one minus three minus four it doesn't even know what's going down its tube right ? 2236345_2252825
so this is wrong you guys I don't wanna see this in the assignments really . 2253065_2258005
could you just take an average of the two ? 2258165_2261205
whoo .
they're the same .
⌈ &~jesu ⌉ .
⌊ they're the same ⌋ .
they are the same exactly . 2261825_2263845
&=laughs but that's good no no that's you guys it's interesting you have this like notion of averages that seems to like oh use an average yeah I don't know what to do use an average . 2266585_2275385
&=laughs no no you don't wanna do that . 2276485_2278705
okay so you either choose you either choose h@l one h@l three h@l four or h@l one h@l two h@l four right ? 2279545_2292385
but since we have two discharges that we need to solve for we need two equations . 2293655_2298155
one of (th)em is going to be h@l one h@l two h@l four the other one is going to be h@l one h@l three h@l four using those <two equations> two equations two unknowns you can calculate the q@l one and q@l two (0.5) right ? 2298855_2315315
(0.6) somebody looks suspicious . 2321365_2322245
it just seems like we're gonna have too many unknowns . 2322845_2325385
&-uh like what ? 2326265_2329385
you know the f@l-s . 2329765_2330825
right . 2331785_2332125
I mean you know .
you can estimate what the f@l-s are right ? 2332645_2335825
(be)cause you have this thing called a Holland equation that says one over squared of F is equal to minus zero times seventy nine times L and times well I don't remember the rest but that's basically what it is . 2336105_2347565
so you plug in the numbers you plug in the length you plug in the type of the pipe you have and this and that and you have an estimation for F . 2348235_2355275
yes ? 2355935_2356115
so when we solve that equation that e@l one minus e@l two equals HF one HF two plus HF four +/. 2356375_2362855
uhuh +/.
+, is that +//. 2363795_2364115
when we solve for Q is that gonna be Q of two or final Q ? 2364615_2369155
very good question . 2370235_2371195
wouldn't that be &~a the Q of the two ? 2372195_2374175
well in that equation you'll have &=writes:board if you call this let's call this q@l one and let's call this q@l two right ? 2374965_2385245
if you match if you do it this way you have a q@l one plus q@l two in your equation you have a q@l one and you have a Q &~one plus q@l two . 2385525_2401545
you have two q@l-s . 2402395_2403315
so you can't really solve that equation all by itself because it has the other Q in it . 2403955_2408195
so you need to solve the second you need write down the second equation and solve it simultaneously and let me tell you +... 2408455_2415255
once you write down the equations e@l one minus e@l two is equal to one path e@l one minus e@l two is equal to the second path and you look at the simplifications and you'll say oh_my_god q@l one and q@l two &~ar is he crazy ? 2417725_2433505
but then it'll dawn on you and you'll say oh_my_god this term cancels out and this term cancels out ah this term cancels out too and even this term cancels out +... 2433785_2442725
and that'll help . 2444485_2445445
but you need to write down the equation equations ⌈ yes ⌉ ? 2446675_2450195
⌊ &-um ⌋ do we only look at frictional losses or do we look at when it's entering the pipe and splitting off ? 2450255_2456475
&~gr good question . 2457015_2459315
well what I would suggest since we haven't even talked about how to deal with losses in branching pipes negligible . 2459875_2467715
and leaving the reservoir ? 2467975_2469555
&-uh leaving this one here for &~ex ? 2470255_2473335
yeah exactly I would like it if you include the loss here because we know that there is a reservoir but here well there's nothing really right ? 2473285_2481805
and besides this thing here xxx for counting these in the equation <you have of> that too . 2482045_2487545
okay .
right ?
so yeah . 2487805_2491985
(0.5) any other questions ? 2492425_2497505
&=writes:board don't write this down this is just a reminder for me . 2498065_2499905
(be)cause I I wanna talk about this stuff later . 2502045_2503345
&-um any questions about this ? 2504725_2506525
so we are moving on ? 2508525_2509805
moving on ? 2510565_2511425

okay let us do number three then . 2511485_2515825
(1.48) anybody need more time ? 2623825_2624885

(0.6) oh no questions on this one huh ? 2630685_2636625
&=laughs (0.7) no questions ? 2642565_2644645
what do you mean by construct a figure ? 2645605_2647405
like <I don't> I don't think I exactly understand that term . 2648285_2651165
okay oh the last sentence you ⌈ mean ⌉ ? 2651445_2653725
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
okay construct a figure it's basically plot Q versus &-uh valve opening . 2654665_2660285
like you have this plot here it has valve opening in terms of percentages in terms of CD . 2661645_2668185
what I would like you to do is replace this CD with a Q basically . 2668585_2673125
(0.5) is that does it make sense ? 2678905_2679625
I don't get that part where the &-um it says +/. 2680345_2684445
mhm +/.
+, &-uh CD relates the flow rate to the head loss . 2686665_2690245
mhm okay &-um . 2690785_2694625
how is it ?
how is that ?
alright well let's see . 2694745_2699325
&=writes:board let's work it out together . 2700465_2701505
now we have what we would like to do ultimately is xxx have a plot like this . 2703005_2713785
right ?
that's the ultimate goal . 2714985_2715805
well the problem is well how do we achieve this right ? 2717005_2719465
okay well we are given a KL which is one over CD squared minus one that's defined right ? 2719685_2728705
it's given to us .
now this KL is a valve loss coefficient meaning &=writing:board the head loss through the valve is equal to KL times v@l squared over two g@l and this KL is that KL right ? 2730245_2751245
now +... 2751785_2752945
by now we are all familiar I hope with this e@l one minus e@l two energy difference and this tells you how much I think it tells you doesn't it ? 2755015_2765795
it tells you how much head difference there is to push the flow through the system . 2765915_2768755
it tells you it gives you a length of the pipe meaning well there is some friction in there and there's a valve in there . 2768975_2776855
okay now if I don't have this information I wouldn't know what K value to put in there to solve my set of equations right ? 2778195_2790615
e@l one minus e@l two is equal to h@l friction plus h@l valve right ? 2791135_2797195
if I do that e@l one minus e@l two is equal to h@l friction plus h@l valve I know that h@l friction is a function of Q well h@l valve in this case is a function of Q and +... 2798705_2814545

well I have two unknowns in one equation . 2818045_2821145
that doesn't work . 2822225_2822705
that's why we gave you this to eliminate this unknown +... 2823175_2827935

you have you can +//. 2834655_2839015
I suggest that you construct a table . 2839635_2842075
here you have valve opening . 2843035_2844695
for this particular valve opening suppose you wanna start with forty I'm just +//. 2847635_2852955
wild guess . 2853455_2853795
for &~thir forty percent valve opening for a butterfly valve you know what the CD is . 2854295_2861995
okay ? 2862595_2862895
valve opening &~forty &-uh forty percent CD value whatever that may be well using that CD value you can easily calculate the k@l value right ? 2863495_2874995
K value .
using that K value +... 2879015_2880375

you are the man .
what would that KL be plugged into ? 2907725_2910345
say it again . 2910965_2912225
that KL we found I got plugged back into up top there . 2912705_2916665
right . 2916925_2917125
the KL goes in here because here you have Q unknown and KL unknown but this KL is known now for this particular valve setting so in this whole equation the only unknown is Q right ? 2917245_2931105
pull it out +... 2931505_2932045
and write it down here . 2934105_2935645
for this valve opening this is the Q I get . 2936525_2938685
and repeat it for a couple more of these values so that's why I keep on suggesting if you have a &~s &~s spreadsheet or some sort of a programming tool available for you you can just plug in these numbers and just press <goal seek> <goal seek> goal seek all the time and you'll end up with all the right answers . 2939985_2964085

but in some other cases I would imagine that since you have a Q in there that you cannot easily pull it out if that's the case then you just use goal seek . 2979145_2987145
but you don't hafta necessarily if this works out without it then +... 2987385_2991445

let me tell you (0.4) basically &~thi this question deals with flow meters . 3217985_3227165
and I personally happen to think it's a very interesting question and you know why ? 3229005_3232465
it combines the previous information that you have with the pipe flow information so it should +//. 3232705_3237625
I hope you will find it interesting too well we'll see right ? 3237905_3241225
well first of all before we go into a discussion of this it says a an eight inch diameter steel pipe &-uh commercial steel (be)cause there are different types of steel pipes so I would like you to use the commercial steel KS that corresponds to it . 3241435_3257555
now there are several sections to this question mm one of (th)em is +... 3258495_3264495
it says okay if you have a piping system okay this piping system is this much long the length is given the diameter is given and also the energy difference between the two end points of the system is given to you as well right ? 3267475_3284815
so you have some sort of a system like this and the energies at those two sections are given to you &-um what we wanna do is the following we would like to meter this flow . 3286195_3299815
and in_order_to do that we need to use different devices right ? 3301475_3304535
that we need to install into the system and that's basically what we &-uh wanna do and determine how much discharge can we actually get through by installing different meters because all the different meters have different head losses associated with them and that in turn influences the discharge going through the system . 3304515_3324455
right ? 3325535_3325575
so in part A we have a what do we have ? 3326515_3330695
&-um sharp edged orifice . 3332545_3335225
&=pause_while_writing so right here in part A I install +... 3335965_3344725
a sharp edged orifice . 3346025_3348185
okay ? 3349025_3349645
what I would like to know is well okay the flow is going through here it's going it's doing this right you all are familiar now what it does well maybe I should draw it over here . 3351475_3362895
&=pause_while_writing so here it is . 3363375_3367495
so the flow comes it contracts and then it expands and turbulence is going on and this and that and the flow is going downstream . 3368235_3378355
now what we know is that as the flow goes through here because of this effect there's some losses associated with it agreed ? 3379875_3388695
we would like to determine those losses because I wanna put that into my system and pull out a Q . 3389635_3395615
right +..? 3396435_3396775
now how would I calculate the loss associated with a sharp edged orifice that's sitting in my system ? 3399665_3408925
any ideas ? 3409545_3410365
(0.6) .
energy equation .
the buzzword . 3416725_3428925
well it's the energy equation but &-uh &=laughs the energy equation between &=pause_while_writing between this point and this point if I apply the energy equation that's equal to &-uh losses because of friction HF plus losses because of the sharp edged orifice . 3420375_3443595
so I have &~th a delta e@l that's equal to HF friction plus H in this case it's a meter let's call it a meter . 3439645_3449425
now how but the the fundamental question here though is what is this ? 3451165_3457945
I know how to represent this . 3458425_3459945
F times N over D times v@l square over two g@l what's the name of this equation by that by the way +..? 3460945_3465125

this one here if I deal with expansion this is not four inches . 3608145_3614645
it's four inches times the contraction . 3615625_3619985
the flow doesn't expand from four inches outward . 3621105_3623725
it goes from four inches into a contraction and then it starts expanding right ? 3624665_3631805
does it make sense +..? 3633345_3634445
no you said it's four times the contraction ? 3637665_3640705

coefficient okay . 3642265_3643085
right . 3643365_3643525
are we supposed to just guess on that ? 3643865_3646845
I mean by this point we we sort_of know but . 3647105_3649985
you sort_of know exactly but you also know that there's a table &-uh table &~sss in one of the previous assignments in the back of the assignment there was like a table for contraction coefficients ? 3650025_3662545
and it's also in Alton's book in I think it's also in the other fluid mechanics book so &~y you just pick a contraction coefficient for that . 3662945_3671925
and the contraction &~coeff contraction coefficient is a function of the relative ratio of the two diameters right ? 3673425_3681225
right ? 3682505_3683385
so you use that equation but you &~nee you need to make sure that you modify that d@l one in there by multiplying with the contraction index (0.5) any questions on this part +..? 3684265_3698045

there's the average thing .
&=laughs .
okay zero point fifteen of_course not fifteen . 3879485_3885165
but yeah so you take that and you plug this value which is a function solely of Q into your energy equations . 3885755_3897595
pull the Q out_of there . 3898275_3899035
but this K now is very different right ? 3900095_3904255
right . 3904315_3905295
it's very different .
sss@i I mean we went through a_lot_of pain in a couple labs to find that . 3905755_3910895

so so based on all the pain you went through . 3913165_3916345
we can just guess now ? 3916885_3917765

there are different loss coefficients . 3970755_3972055
we know that . 3972835_3973455
and we also know that &-um this is some sort of a loss coefficient Q for Venturis and do we all remember something which is +//. 3975115_3989195

yeah .
no ? 3994175_3995915
yes . 3996335_3996575
yeah .
and this is where we pick up our K values right because I did the calculation for this can everybody see this by the way ? 3998445_4003885
and I think you have a copy of this in one of the assignment sheets . 4004805_4008085

that is on page five twenty eight but as I said I think I have given you a copy of this so in one of the assignments you should have that +... 4017645_4025245
now if you look at this graph it's a function of Reynolds number and a diameter ratio right ? 4027245_4038405
well diameter ratio fine good I know what the diameter is here the xxx diameter I know what the pipe diameter is I can deal with that okay good how do you deal with a Reynolds number ? 4039105_4050765

you man good intuition . 4064105_4065225

the +//.
&=laughs well I wouldn't do that +... 4086455_4088955
well what would I do then ? 4092915_4093675
&~well &~we somebody said the average is there any other idea ? 4094055_4096355
do you have to calculate Reynolds number ? 4096555_4097695
huh ? 4098155_4098235
do you have to calculate Reynolds number ? 4098495_4099735
could you do that or not ? 4099915_4100555
you need to calculate Reynolds number but without the discharge (0.7) so what would you do ? 4100855_4110675
(0.5) an idea a guess what would you do ? 4116405_4118545
we have to solve this problem . 4118985_4120065
can't you figure it out from the flow rate from the previous problem ? 4121125_4123785
but it's a different meter though . 4124845_4126065
it's a different meter and it's a different head loss it's gonna result in a different flow rate . 4126745_4130025
but this is a different meter it's gonna have a different ⌈ head loss ⌉ . 4130545_4132765
⌊ can you guess one ⌋ . 4132825_4133485
⌈ xxx the ⌉ .
sorry .
huh ? 4134765_4135445
go ahead . 4135565_4135885
I was gonna say guess one . 4136065_4137305
guess one what Q ? 4137685_4138565
guess like a K and then plug plug that into your Q and then plug that Q into the Reynolds equation and see if it works . 4138735_4146535
very good . 4147255_4147655
how what what K would you start off your calculations with ? 4148555_4151595
the average . 4152675_4153175
the &~av &=laughs:multiple okay what would you say Jeffrey ? 4153895_4155875
start off at the high end . 4156755_4158075
at the high end . 4158195_4158875
it's a high Reynolds number case . 4159415_4161095
do your calculations if the Reynolds number that you get is greater than the high end no matter how greater it is because after a certain point it is one right ? 4162225_4173125
no matter how greater it is as long as it's greater the K value that you assumed is correct +... 4173225_4180205
I mean you can do it the way Brenda suggested too but then you would have to probably do multiple iterations because K Reynolds number probably will be moving off . 4181065_4190485
but once you reach a high end after that no matter how much bigger it is that's the K value no need for iteration . 4191015_4197455
does this make sense +..? 4199315_4200035
to everybody ? 4202615_4203395
(0.6) yes ? 4205835_4209475
&=laughs:S9 so shall we move on then ?
okay well in part C <oh this one's> xxx &=laughs:S9 in part C what does part C say ? 4213865_4224485
what does the last part say +..? 4224605_4225565
an anubar@n with a negligible head loss what would you do there ? 4228105_4232265
(0.7) an anubar@n with negligible head loss .
just <ignore the> ignore the meter .
that's it Bradley ignore the meter (be)cause it's zero . 4244135_4247275
so in this equation HF plus <h@l meter> h@l meter is zero . 4248275_4253015
do your calculation again just with HF delta e@l is equal to HF +... 4254115_4259295

which you talked about in class as well imagine that . 4293205_4296845
easy . 4297325_4299705
easy .
yeah .
right +..? 4300585_4300965
okay before I let you all go this F thing here +... 4302555_4307015
let me tell you something about this . 4308735_4309855
well there are certain equations that relate F to certain values certain characteristics of the pipe the length the diameter the the this and that whatever and &-um so which one of those equations would you use to solve this problem ? 4311095_4329075
give me an equation +... 4329315_4329695
&-uh you may wanna look at your notes . 4332925_4334225
&=laughs:multiple it may help . 4335145_4335805
I couldn't remember the xxx equation . 4336145_4338105
&=flipping_papers_:14 yes +..? 4352585_4352965
&-um xxx .
which one ? 4357185_4358265
are you talking about the one over negative zero point seven eight two ? 4358465_4362085
+, is that the one you're looking for ? 4362445_4363505
+, no . 4364165_4364325
would you use that ? 4364545_4365205
I mean I'm asking you . 4365505_4366245
do you feel comfortable with that ? 4366645_4367545
no but I was just giving it to you . 4368465_4370005
&=laughs:multiple .
do you use the one that's like the equivalent length equation that one ? 4370545_4375605
but that doesn't have an F in it . 4376205_4377425
I mean you still need to know what F is even to use this equivalent thing . 4378725_4382645
&=laughs .
well since we're at high Reynolds numbers it seems we could use the one she was about to . 4383385_4387865
okay how is it ? 4387885_4389025
what's the equation for that ? 4389645_4390465
one over &-um quantity negative zero point seven eight two times the natural log of +/. 4390685_4396045
times the natural log of +/. 4396445_4397445
+, quantity KS over three point seven D to the one point one one five . 4398005_4403285
okay . 4403745_4404165
that's it .
that's it . 4405705_4406025
that's it +...
this is the Holland equation isn't it ? 4410575_4413135
for high Reynolds number cases . 4414075_4415535
so the regular equation has a plus a number divided by Reynolds number in here right ? 4417175_4423595
the whole equation don't you have it written down too ? 4424615_4426255
six point nine . 4426355_4426955
six point nine +... 4427055_4427715
now in order for you to do your initial estimate what you say is I assume a high Reynolds number case +... 4430245_4439245
if I assume a high Reynolds number case now look at this KS is given to me the diameter is given to me well this is like a pretty clean equation you can easily pull an F out_of there right ? 4440225_4453925
right ? 4454445_4455985
yep .
so you use that do your calculations and at the end of the calculations you have a small column saying okay I assumed a high Reynolds number case right ? 4457505_4471865
let me calculate the Reynolds number +... 4472985_4474745
V times D over kinematic viscosity . 4477165_4479565
now if this Reynolds number is indeed greater greater than <ten to the> &~mi ten to the five or ten to the six the one over it it's gonna be like zero point <zero zero> zero zero <zero zero> zero zero one . 4480665_4494145
and that's pretty small isn't it ? 4495285_4496685
so you don't even have to go back and put that in there because it's probably not gonna make that much of a difference . 4497325_4501565
right ? 4503225_4503245
but I would like you to do that because that is an assumption . 4503925_4508265
you assume high Reynolds number . 4508925_4511365
once you are through with your calculations go back and calculate this for me . 4512305_4515785
prove to me that this is the case indeed +... 4516705_4518685
okay +..? 4521085_4523385
alrighty .
but &~af after you find the F in the back then . 4525585_4529485
find F . 4529805_4530045
after you estimate the F using this you do your calculations and you get a Q +... 4530685_4536865
and that Q is going to give you Reynolds number right ? 4538885_4541785
well if that Reynolds number is bigger than ten to the five or ten to the six I personally don't see any point in doing it here and modifying F because you're gonna hafta take the one over ten to the five xxx <of that> ten to the minus five times six . 4542525_4555905
&~th that's for each problem then or ? 4557145_4558585
the verification ? 4559745_4560465
yeah . 4561525_4561745
right . 4562385_4562665
for any problem ⌊ that you ⌋ . 4562925_4564705
⌈ anytime ⌉ you calculate a Q using an F then we need to do that . 4565385_4567365
huh ? 4567365_4567505
say again ? 4567985_4568285
any time you calculate &~a a Q using an F then we need to do that . 4568345_4572405
right . 4572525_4572805
okay . 4572965_4573245
