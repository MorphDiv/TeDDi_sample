I guess we were talking about variables, just the general thing . 0_24051
ok . 24051_25347
let's start with talking about operational definitions . 25347_28537
ok . 28537_30083
maybe you want to tell me a little bit about what operational
give me an example ? 36267_38051
operational definitions, from what I gather, is um taking um
um I guess maybe an example is taking something like um ah
you know um maybe through your heart beat pulse rate you
you would define somebody who's anxious as a heart beat of so and
uhm . 87973_89277
sounds about right . 89277_90286
and ah the main purpose for doing it, ah, for having operational
so if I'm studying this particular phenomena and I say my ah my new
xxx “What do you mean by aggression” ? 119961_122765
well, aggression is the number of times the child struck out at
that's how I define aggression . 129590_131590
ok . 131590_132877
then you said to quantify ah information ? 132877_136581
quantify ah yeah, more abstract information . 136581_140015
so it allows scientists to ah to be able to communicate freely and
ok . 150030_152141
um, one thing with operational definitions is you can get real
you can say that ah for example, excuse me, for example um ah:
so the more narrow your operational definition the ah the lease,
so ya think you have a pretty good handle on operational
mhm . 224344_225247
ok, then if you could do me a favor just through the course of this
oh, ok . 235711_236936
they want to see what xxx is going on I guess . 236936_240030
ok . 240030_240958
alright, any other questions about operational definitions, um, any
no . 246935_247895
it's pretty straightforward . 247895_248846
it's pretty straight forward stuff . 248846_251327
alright, we'll talk about measurement now um well we haven't
well, from what I understand a variable is like a categories and
sure . 273616_274263
and anything that you can ah put a value to ok like ah gender, male
ok, that . 290741_292847
I do have a question about it though . 292847_294990
alright . 294990_295441
ah, one of our homework assignments, um, I think I might've made it
um was to give phenomena and we had to list the you know
so, I'm gonna kinda give my phenomena here . 319118_321767
alright . 321767_322097
let me know if I did this <right> . 322097_323048
<alright> . 323048_323536
um, I said, I think it was a survey of ten thousand teenage
your survey is <xxx> . 344000_348496
<real> yeah this was it, um who are sexually active um have
mhm . 369721_370319
ok, that's my phenomena . 370319_373754
<xxx> . 373754_375622
and now what do you think the variables are ? 375622_378125
um so you want to say that children's attitudes are affected by
mhm . 385301_385829
ok, um, well what do you think they are ? 385829_389878
well I thought teenage sex um I thought delusions and I thought
ya know cause I thought sposures ya know I as being a variable
if that's part of your study ya know how many times did you . 406863_408871
uhuh, and um the delusions ah ya know from having that and the
mhm . 422335_423265
so, how far off, I mean . 423265_425855
well, if your measuring let's say, um number of times um they've
mhm . 432140_432645
if your measuring um number you know if they're sexually
right . 438158_438913
that's a variable . 438913_440014
I guess all of your subjects are sexually active . 440014_441989
mhm . 441989_442893
ok um whether your subjects believe that it's ok . 442893_450198
right, that's the delusions . 450198_451707
mhm right that's the variable . 451707_453339
ok ok . 453339_454619
that sounds good, actually it sounds like a real interesting study .
yeah, well I'm working with ah teenage pregnancies right now so I
mhm . 468477_468723
I thought ok and then um ya know your specifics, I
yeah, so if you want to look at it by age . 482443_484242
aha . 484242_484978
age would be a variable . 484978_485898
ok . 485898_486715
you might want to look at ah economic background . 486715_490129
yeah . 490129_491032
ok . 491032_492786
it sounds like you got a handle on that then . 492786_494571
alright, let's talk about ah reliability then . 494571_498590
ok, reliability ah is probably um how often that um the measure can
umhm . 509590_510230
ya know . 510230_510742
how redundant it is to be able to repeat itself otherwise its not
right, so ah why don't you give me an example of a ah just make
ok, my blood pressure is usually ah like a one hundred and
ah it's usually pretty low as low as one hundred and five and ah
I know that the day I go and it's forty something or whatever ya
umhm, and the importance of having something reliable as far as
ah are you asking me a question ? 562607_568025
yeah . 568025_568311
it's oh well because um I would imagine that ah the truth of it you
if it's not reliable then it can't be used . 576673_580128
so you have some sort of um, the way most experiments are run is
right, ok . 591177_592240
and you look at it afterwards . 592240_593008
so it's a way if it's stable <it lets you tell> . 593008_594810
<right> . 594810_595561
if there's been a change that it's just not due to the +... 595561_598661
that's true . 598661_599758
unreliability of a test . 599758_601078
and that's the real importance of having a reliable test . 601078_605284
right ok alright . 605284_607353
that's good . 607353_608031
ok and ah validity . 608031_611354
ah validity is um making sure you're measuring what's suppose to be
right . 618104_618647
ok . 618647_619351
and there's two types of validity um that the book talks about and
now face validity um is um pretty easy that's that face value ya
but construct validity, I'm ah not too sure about that one . 639221_644372
it um according to the book it's when the measurement isn't ah
well it it might not . 656876_658883
it might not measure it . 658883_660172
but but what it's suppose to do it's more more of a real measure of
um, it just looks like it's going to measure what you think it's
ah lets say that you have ah you have a depression inventory type
so you say yeah yeah that looks like it's going to have face
now construct validity is a little it's more deep . 688115_692141
and it is your measuring the true theoretical um constructs that
so for example um I like the one the book gave um about REM
looking how fast your eyes moving whatever that really wouldn't
right . 715780_716293
has no relation cause you just can't look and say your eyes are
exactly yeah . 726612_727156
so it's measuring the underlying things it's it's . 727156_730252
ok . 730252_730547
the same thing . 730547_731179
the key word there is underlying . 731179_732924
underlying, the true underlying processes . 732924_734944
ok . 734944_735267
ah because with face validity your measuring what you can see you
umhm just common sense . 742734_743289
the obvious . 743289_743462
yeah . 743462_744142
uhuh and then the construct is the like you said what goes on
umhm, you know it might be obvious it doesn't say it's not obvious
ok . 757965_758600
and that's construct validity . 758600_760234
ok . 760234_763311
we'll go on here we'll talk about reactivity a little bit . 763727_769712
why don't you ah define that for me . 769712_772759
what we're doing right now . 772759_774385
trying not to react to the camera . 774385_778233
you know that's one example of it um when you haven an experiment
umhmm . 792817_793153
I guess try to act more natural . 793153_795257
right . 795257_795925
it's if you're a subject and your um if your behavior differs
umhmm . 802434_803026
an experimenter would call that reactivity . 803026_805248
so um how would you xxx let's say you were doing a study on ah
what wouldbe a couple ways that you could ah get around reactivity ?
ahm with children you'd get them to be as natural as possible . 822563_829150
let's see um I'm trying to do a study um like on a playground or
you'd have to observe them from behind a close door or ah you know
right . 846453_847061
but once you close that door to go behind the screen or something
exactly . 853462_854481
and another way of minimizing reactivity um in an experiment is
as an experimenter lot of social psychology, they mislead the
deception . 872502_873069
yeah they use deception . 873069_874149
that's exactly right . 874149_875229
um, one of my favorite studies from my intro class was um Milgram's
yeah I saw that one . 883563_884482
they thought they were trying to help somebody learn the subjects
so that is an example of how you can use deception to get aroun
