conversation number thirty eight dash ninety two portions of a telephone conversation between the President and Henry A Kissinger . 6000_14510
these portions were recorded on April seventeenth through April eighteenth nineteen seventy three at an unknown time between eleven forty five pm and twelve oh four am . 15070_25990
the following is segment one . 27770_29550
well (3.0) rather a hard day wasn't it . 36520_40550
well it was hard for you . 41510_42880
yeah . 44950_45170
when I I didn't know you had made the statement you did until the evening . 46070_49790
when I think of the discipline with which you conducted the meeting in the morning . 50760_54280
and then going through the evening . 56740_57960
and then going through the evening . 58010_59920
no, problem I have is that &-uh I can't look at it in the detached way I really should to all these good people . 60320_68840
god damnit they're guilty . 68890_69880
throw (th)em out and go on . 69930_72480
but &-uh just the personal things . 72590_75400
they're god damn . 75450_76600
I think of these good men . 77600_78830
that's right who wanted to do the right thing . 80780_86000
and &-uh well I was gonna splash a_lot_of (th)em . 86110_88910
and &-uh anyway . 90520_93090
and I think the way you have positioned it now that's the right way to do it . 93750_98840
of course Garmint as you know is having the idea that I should get up and announce that I'd fired Haldeman Ehrlichman and Dean . 100550_107220
and that &-uh didn't mean without without waiting until they get up and name . 108060_115140
but the real culprit is is Mitchell of course . 115220_117250
he's in charge of the whole goddamn thing . 117250_118950
and John Mitchell should step up like a man and say look I was in charge . 118970_122710
I take the responsibility period . 122730_124730
&=pad .
&=pad .
exactly all the more so as doing the opposite won't help them any . 124890_128820
nope they're gonna get him . 129880_131190
no I think to fire Haldeman would make him the villains . 136060_139200
well in the end he would probably have to go Henry . 141050_143930
they're gonna you know rip him up good . 145440_148420
well if that's the case then he should get out before . 150600_153260
well but not until I have absolute evidence . 155360_161240
I'm not gonna fire a guy on the basis of a charge made by Dean who basically is trying to save his ass and get &-uh immunity . 161320_170270
you see that's why I had that phrase in there that no immunity should be granted to a top person . 170290_175400
yeah . 176500_176720
he has no right to do that . 176880_178020
no that's absolutely . 179090_180190
I mean I think that is outrageous . 180270_181820
no I I just have no way . 184290_186630
I I have no good feel for where . 186760_188340
I I think you would not have improved the situation if you had suddenly without any preparation turned on all your associates . 189590_198710
yep . 199540_199680
and &-uh . 201340_202140
well we have two two or three hard months ahead . 205790_208720
it's gonna be real rough . 209380_210440
well the major thing now Mr President if I may say so is to protect the Presidency and your authority . 210660_216700
that'll be hard because . 218660_219910
&-uh well that wil be absolutely essential . 219960_222780
will some of these people will even piss on the president if they think it'll help him . 222800_226350
well . 228270_228670
it's pretty hard . 229030_229910
I'm the only one frankly <of the whole god> of the whole bunch who really didn't know a goddamn thing you know about it until until March when I finally Dean came in and said well here's where it is . 229960_246590
which he should have done months ago . 248200_249550
well they were in over their head . 250620_252120
and they tried to instead_of stepping back and assessing where they were getting deeper and deeper . 252340_259110
that's right . 259430_259950
but I think the absolute . 260700_262140
I mean to protect the place . 262350_265780
well <if we can> if we can we will . 266150_268220
and if we don't what the hell . 268240_269390
we can Mr President . 269930_271250
maybe we'll &-uh I've even considered the possibility of frankly just throwing myself on the sword . 271250_278660
and no letting letting that letting Agnew take it . 278680_281570
what the hell . 281800_282140
that is out_of the question with all due respect . 282810_284980
Mr President that cannot be considered . 285270_287020
well . 288710_289100
personality what it would do to the Presidency and to the historical un injustice of it . 289760_294750
why should you do it . 294860_295790
and what good would it do . 297360_298300
whom would it help . 300720_301240
it wouldn't help the country . 304310_305580
it wouldn't help any individual involved . 305650_307810
but with all respect I don't think the president has a right to sacrifice himself for an individual . 309540_314100
and it would of course be personally unjust . 319160_321290
well maybe . 322610_323700
I think we'd have to take . 324710_325770
well I've had done a few tough meetings . 325880_327910
you know I've had dinners &-uh the night after Cambodia . 328080_332430
I had &-uh I had one on Midsommun eighth . 332430_336380
we had a dinner . 336400_336980
and they were tough . 337000_338700
but boy I'm telling you tonight I . 338830_340340
that was the hard one for me to get through . 340340_342950
<I don't think> I don't think . 343870_344750
you carried it off even . 344800_345830
if it I don't think the audience sensed it but . 345920_347680
no one sensed it . 347970_348870
no one in fact . 349210_351550
I didn't know you had made a statement . 351680_353150
so one of my dinner partners said isn't it astonishing how the president is behaving considering what he's done today . 353250_359990
I said . 360630_361020
yes he's had a tough meeting in the morning . 361080_362750
but he does that all the time . 362800_364070
she said no the statement . 365050_366250
so it was an astonishing performance . 371850_374550
but I think Mr President it can be . 376500_378800
well to the extent you can and you're talking to people . 379700_383220
you may may have to mention really very strongly these personal things if it'll help . 383320_388760
I don't know may not help . 388920_390200
I know it it will help Mr President . 390500_392800
then if the stuff any stuff gets out then there has to be ruthless surgery or as the stuff gets out . 392800_400100
yep oh it will there will hell . 400450_402500
axe'll fall . 406070_406660
and . 408220_408590
&-uh it's impermissible to touch the President . 409090_412470
That cannot be permitted . 412470_413660
and whatever price . 416690_418660
and I'm sure that even Bob &-uh that Bob wouldn't want that . 419330_422450
oh no . 423690_424420
Bob is willing to Bob and John both willing throw themselves on the sword over this . 424440_429220
when they do they're gonna fight like hell . 429240_430950
but John one of them oughta stay . 432100_433910
I would hope so . 435510_436430
but it I'm afraid it can't be Haldeman . 438580_440570
and I'm afraid the only one that possibly could be saved would be Ehrlichman and that's tough too . 440600_444940
but I think you positioned it correctly that as evidence comes out . 450700_454310
but for you to fire them all now would could look like panic . 454900_458330
well that's the Garmint line . 462310_463660
what do you think of his line ? 463680_464540
well Garmint wants you to fire Haldeman Dean and Ehrlichmann . 465350_470910
I don't know what they want you to fire Ehrlichmann too . 472230_473540
yep . 474860_475080
well well it's a possibility . 478150_483100
I don't know what the evidence is . 483310_484740
but . 484980_485320
&-uh the evidence is at this time charges made that have not been corroborated yet but there . 485490_492000
well if there's a good chance that they'll have to go as a result of what happened . 492380_498390
then I don't think you should fire them . 499330_500930
they ought_to resign on the ground that their usefulness is impaired . 501080_504410
that they have to be above like Caesar's wife . 504410_510040
mhm . 513140_513510
we'll think about it . 516860_517580
do our best . 518140_518789
but I think it does you credit to have the spirit you have . 519700_525010
and in any event today you were allowed to go no further . 526920_530680
this concludes segment one of conversation number thirty eight dash ninety two . 537170_542420
the following is segment two of conversation number thirty eight dash ninety two . 552270_557330
portion of a telephone conversation between the President and Henry A Kissinger . 557630_562330
this portion was recorded on April seventeenth through April eighteenth nineteen seventy three at an unknown time between eleven forty five pm and twelve oh four am . 562930_573690
well don't you get discouraged . 579420_580830
you Mr President I'm not discouraged . 580880_582660
you do your job . 582720_583390
you two or three of us have got a stick around . 583580_586810
try to hold the goddamn fort . 586960_588220
and you you have saved this country . 588480_590590
Mr President the history books will show that when they don't when no one will know what Watergate means . 590790_597620
and maybe . 599220_600260
although our enemies you know will say well this proves that we were obstructing justice . 601940_610260
we . 610490_610780
oh well . 612090_612470
oh and in six months no one will know it anymore . 614200_616410
it's a human tragedy for Haldeman and Dean and a few of those fellows . 618390_623180
Haldeman is a good big man and Mr President and here . 624540_627470
Dean is the the real the fellow the three . 628740_632540
oh e gonna be the loose cannon because he's &-uh trying to save his ass . 632560_637970
trying to get immunity . 638920_639900
that's why I had in that little phrase that no immunity should be granted to any top person . 639920_644190
yeah . 645000_645190
and and that's gonna burn his ass . 645240_646700
because then he'll thrash out about everything you can imagine . 646880_651830
yeah . 652490_652670
although Ziegler made an interesting point . 654600_656300
he has god damn little carability credibility . 656320_658780
after all all he was making the report . 658800_660540
that's right . 661140_661620
he was the one that said there was no involvement . 661640_663390
and that's what we relied on . 663560_664660
that's right . 665200_665720
and <took him> took him (un)til February or March of this year before he finally came in and said well here it is . 665900_672510
that's right . 672990_673460
it's a little damn late isn't it . 674140_675350
I'd just fire him . 675550_676340
and it's soon said . 676360_678300
come out . 678590_679690
and let him scream from the outside . 679690_683840
oh I guess so . 688700_689430
so &-uh we will when the time comes . 689480_692010
well you know nobody really will know that &-uh what they put a president through on a thing like this . 695020_700350
well it's inhuman . 701150_702470
Mr President and it's &-uh cause these bastards know damn well that you couldn't have known about it . 702610_708710
but if one considers all the things you had to go through you couldn't be a police judge too . 708880_714240
you're running the government . 715370_716440
you're doing all the negotiating . 716520_717990
you're carrying a bigger load than any president has . 718880_721320
top of it they want you to . 722660_723820
good god we were going to Russia and China and ending the war and negotiating . 723940_727910
I wasn't even thinking about the goddamn campaign . 728150_730540
you know I had nothing to do with the campaign as you know . 730560_733260
of course . 733760_734000
that's the pro(blem) . 734510_735120
that's the tragedy . 735330_735860
I wish to Christ maybe that I had . 735990_737490
but if I had been spending time in the campaign maybe we wouldn't pulled off the Vietnam . 737600_741780
if you can't rely on your own people to tell you the facts . 742090_745130
<then it's> then it's rather difficult . 747320_749310
and <if you hadn't done if exactly> if you had done that we might still be in we in the war . 749520_754640
this concludes segment two of conversation number thirty eight dash ninety two . 760450_766100
the following is segment three of conversation number thirty eight dash ninety two . 776980_782060
portion of a telephone conversation between the President and Henry A Kissinger . 782530_787290
this portion was recorded on April seventeenth through April eighteenth nineteen seventy three at an unknown time between eleven forty five pm and twelve oh four am . 787920_798630
and the meantime &-uh put your arm around Haldeman and Ehrlichman . 805380_810030
you can count on it Mr President . 810500_812280
&-uh I've been standing by Haldeman I didn't know Ehrlichman was in trouble though . 812940_816510
yeah .
no you can count on the fact that I stand by . 821570_823670
but the major person to stand by now is you . 823670_828690
we should see . 833330_834070
but at_least good_ol Sinatra gave (th)em a lift . 836860_838990
and I thought the dinner was rather nice . 839040_840910
you know . 840960_841370
the whole evening was beautiful . 841370_842110
Pm was nice . 842320_843670
and we you know was light and yet fun for everybody . 843720_847830
the whole evening was beautiful . 848690_850060
we'll sleep on it . 857350_858180
we'll all try to get some ideas . 858580_860060
I don't think Garmint's judgment is very good . 860080_865060
I don't you know I mean he panicks so easily . 865080_868470
you know he &~pe panicked on Cambodia and everything else earlier . 868520_871300
and that's right . 871320_872190
that's pretty_much . 872400_873110
I I just feel that's the best he may have to . 873310_876730
so far you haven't got the evidence . 877090_878630
if you get some evidence that makes it look that the fellows can't be held . 880840_885190
if it's hard evidence though . 885370_886630
god_damn_it I'm not gonna you . 886720_887670
get hard evidence . 887720_888350
hard . 888440_888810
it's gotta be corroborated . 888880_889840
I ain't gonna let (th)em do it on a basis of . 889920_891670
then you ought_to fire the people against whom you have evidence . 892120_895950
and the others ought_to consider resigning . 896040_898070
yep . 901240_901430
well it'll be a great day on the other side for the all of our enemies won't it . 905870_910050
Times the Post the rest shit . 910480_911930
that's right Mr President . 912710_914930
we'll put together the wagons . 914550_916840
and pull it through as you've done so often . 916920_920590
well no that's just what's really disturbing . 923030_927780
is that the comparing this goddamn thing with Teapot Dome for Christ's Sakes which was thievery on a massive basis . 927800_935590
isn't what this is all about . 936530_937550
that's right Mr President . 937910_938580
that and in another year that will be clear . 938940_940950
take that long I'm afraid . 942630_943830
maybe less I think if if the major thing now is to pull to to get the puss out_of the system . 945210_952910
and not let it be squeezed out a little at a time . 954980_957100
that's right . 957120_957400
that's right . 957480_957830
and I think . 959350_960040
the grand jury will put in a hell of a lot of that done . 960900_963410
once you have all the facts I think you should consider then at_least . 963550_966830
right . 967330_967540
cleaning at_least that part of the house that must be cleaned . 968760_972600
right . 973780_973870
however . 973870_974140
right . 975630_975890
okay Henry . 976300_976830
Mr President . 977480_977590
this concludes segment three of conversation number thirty eight dash ninety two . 986810_991520
this concludes the abuse of government power segments for conversation number thirty eight dash ninety two . 993420_999170
