one day a little boy got a frog .
and he put it in a jar .
one night when he was sleeping the frog got out_of his jar .
when the little boy woke up he learned his pet the frog wasn't
so he looked in his boots and called out the window .
and the dog's head got stuck in the jar .
and the dog fell out the window .
so the boy got out the window too .
he called and called for the frog .
he called in the ground hog hole .
and the dog was barking at a beehive .
then the beehive broke .
and all the bees came out .
and the boy was looking in the tree .
then an owl came out_of the tree .
so the boy fell down .
and all the bees went after his dog .
then he climbed up on a big rock <and saw> and saw some
so he climbed onto the branches .
and it was really a deer .
then he got stuck on the deer's head .
then the deer threw the boy off and his dog into a pond .
the boy and his dog fell and got soaked .
<when they got up> then they got up .
