I know it was two guys .
and they were supposed to meet .
and I don't think one of them came .
but he thought it was him .
they were like two brothers .
<I was> I think one of them was eighteen .
and Jimmy was twenty .
and they had remodeled the street .
a_lot_of the buildings were torn down .
and that's all I remember .
okay it was at the corner of a drugstore .
and then they each gazed at them each other .
and he thought it was Jimmy .
and he said +"/.
+" you are not Jimmy because twenty years is a long time
+" what you think ?
but it wasn't long enough to change his nose .
and I think the policeman arrested him .
and he had a note for him .
and it says &-um +...
I forgot what the note said .
my mother had three girls .
one of my sisters died at the age of eighteen .
so it was just me and my other sister .
it was just two of us .
so my father, he used to be kind_of mean to my mother .
so my mother, she went out .
and she got a boyfriend .
and she got pregnant .
and that was me .
and I came up stammering just like the guy .
you know how you stammer .
and my mother was angry with me because I came up talking like him
so my father left .
and she was really angry with me then .
and as we got older and my other sister drifted away from her then
we got real close .
very close .
and she died about two years ago .
she was my best friend as we got older .
but she hated me, which it wasn't my fault .
that's the end of that .
