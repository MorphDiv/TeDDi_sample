okay I'm looking for those fourth ways to show up on your core
challenge yourself . 5318_6888
and then we're going to do some whole group sharing and see how
you hadn't done that way before ? 12273_13978
xxx that's half blue and half green ? 13978_16635
xxx . 16635_23778
(o)kay Amanda has her fourth way . 23778_26475
Katy's still thinking about her fourth way . 26475_29170
looks like Sarah must be also . 29170_31542
okay let's um let's make a record of all the ways we found so far .
because do you think we've only found four ways so far ? 37622_40000
+< no . 40000_40550
+< yeah . 40550_41550
yes . 41550_42383
why ? 42383_43032
no . 43032_43695
I mean the whole class . 43695_43995
+< no . 43995_44743
+< no . 44743_45450
no . 45450_46055
no (be)cause each of us found four different ways . 46055_48845
well maybe some of xxx . 48845_49637
do you think we all found exactly the same four ways ? 49637_52528
no . 52528_53300
we may have found one xxx . 53300_55038
+< xxx the same ways but +/. 55038_58753
so Jillian you think that the four ways you found are probably just
he could've made it one the different xxx like he could've made his
right . 72703_73380
but do you think maybe every one of his ways somewhere was one of
no . 77317_77380
+< or do you think maybe you could have thought of a way that he
though do you think it likely that that at least one of your
probably (be)cause we're using the same shapes and the same amount
let's see what we come up with though . 93758_95815
who can describe for me one way that a core square could look if
first off +//. 107320_108680
just one second you'll have to give me a moment (be)cause what I'm
it's gonna be broken down into four smaller squares
so we're going to use today we're using squares blue and green
+< is everybody gonna get to have a chance to show
+< I well probably not but maybe it just depends on how
we'll continue sharing ways and putting them up on the chart as
we're going to have no repeats on our chart . 149222_151893
remember when we recorded the ways to net a cube ? 151893_155872
and some people thought they had found a different way and then
so the deal is we'll put your way up here as long as the way you
okay so these'll be core squares made from blue and green squares .
okay let me put one more up here . 182553_187010
I made eight of them . 187010_188247
do you think we'll be able to find eight different ones ? 188247_189505
+< you made ten . 189505_190627
I made ten ? 190627_191707
thank you Brittany I lost track of all my ways . 191707_194608
do you think we'll be able to find ten different ways ? 194608_196303
yeah . 196303_196762
yeah . 196762_197307
maybe . 197307_197407
+< let's see . 197407_198395
I'm ready with blue and green Brian tell me about a way you found .
oh well I have one right here and one above it and xxx other side
(o)kay two blues so one on the bottom and one above it you said . 210910_216878
yeah . 216878_217700
and then next to those two blues what did you arrange ? 217700_222032
a green two greens . 222032_223872
two greens right next to that . 223872_226177
okay so this is one way that Brian found to make a core square
who &~y by moving their pieces around found a different way you
Dani . 243345_244037
um by um like um the one blue on the top left is +/. 244037_255947
okay just a second can I color that in so one blue on the top left
okay and then how did the rest of your core square turn out ? 260718_266213
and then you put like another one across from it and down . 266213_272830
no down . 272830_275658
okay so the blue one that's diagonally um attached to it it's not
okay so you used those two were blue in your core square . 285792_289663
and the other ones were green . 289663_292073
the other ones were green so um wait though Brian used two blue
isn't that the same way ? 303817_305050
no . 305050_305837
there's different ways to use two and two . 305837_306380
+< they're not the same order um pattern that Brian and Dani's are
okay so everyone's sure that those two are different ? 323693_326828
yes . 326828_327712
alright so we found two different ways maybe that's all there are .
no . 330917_331587
+< I guess not . 331587_332682
lots of you are thinking Alex can you describe for me a different
well you have a square at the right at the bottom . 337022_346225
okay on the bottom right so right here ? 346225_349065
blue square .349065_350250
what color would you like that to be Alex ? 350250_352297
blue . 352297_352952
blue . 352952_353437
okay . 353437_359642
and then the rest should be green . 359642_362698
okay well I can tell right away that's a different way than the
okay maybe we found them all is that all the ways ? 377012_380485
no . 380485_381782
okay Kelly tell me about a way you found . 381782_384628
half green half blue . 384628_386338
half green half blue ? 386338_388628
I see a core square that looks like it's half green and half blue
no . 397632_399512
no I mean um um put two green ones in the top and bottom left .
okay so on the left on the top and on the bottom you would like it
did I do that correctly ? 415537_417060
+< xxx it's the opposite . 417060_419097
yeah . 419097_420052
and then uh then the other two blue . 420052_423522
the other two would be blue . 423522_424580
it's just like the other one except it's not like that . 424580_425928
+< only it's flipped . 425928_428093
wait um Justin it's are you thinking that we already have this
we already have that way only that it's right way only that all you
okay so you have to turn it ? 439378_441195
I uh +... 441195_443013
or you can flip it . 443013_444263
or you can flip it ? 444263_445555
okay I can turn it or flip it . 445555_447582
which way would I flip it to make it turn into this . 447582_450523
this is kind of like what you were doing with Mrs Jacobson
+< xxx to the left . 452227_453815
shh . 453815_454458
John um Justin if this if we call this one one Brian's
you said you could flip it how would you flip it ? 460537_462580
if I took one of these if I could actually move this how would you
Asratu I'm only asking Justin right now and then I'll let you share
you could take it right or you could take it left . 480755_483715
I could flip it right or I could flip it left so I could flip it
that's kind of hard to imagine isn't it but um is there anyone who
+< actually you could always flip it right (be)cause if you flip it
okay I think we're going to need to see that don't you (be)cause I
+^ what I'm gonna do is make Brian's um Brian's core
is that the way that um Brian made his core square ? 520248_523247
yeah . 523247_524215
okay is there anyone who thinks that I didn't do a good job copying
(o)kay will everyone agree I used the same shapes and colors that
this is Brian's way . 536937_538353
okay so here's it &~bri uh Justin said that Kelly's way is
the same way . 553355_554125
+< Kelly's . 554125_554777
Kelly's way which means it's the same way but let me start with
+< but it's still +...556715_560607
first Justin was worried that maybe flipping left wouldn't do it
let's watch I'll flip it left . 564590_567070
yeah . 567070_568067
