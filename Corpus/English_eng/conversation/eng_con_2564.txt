+, ⌊ I ⌋ came for good and +... 239325_241665
yeah you can say I've been here continuously . 244655_246595
uhuh since ninety six since January ninety six yeah okay . 246975_253455
and &-um before before you came to the University of Michigan what was your educational experience I know you &-um +... 254595_263515
&-um you mentioned actually in this conversation &-um going to university in the capital of your country ? 265705_273045
mhm +/.
+, &-um .
yeah I got a degree in +... 276225_277725
&-uh agronomic engineering . 280105_281285
agronomic ? 282065_283385
yeah it's a one of those third world degrees that you do basically the way I see it is +/. 283515_294075
mhm +/.
+, the purpose of the university is to prepare you to work . 294335_297955
+, mhm +/.
+, and so when you're eighteen years old and start start university +/. 300375_304715
+, mhm +/.
+, you're supposed to go there learn everything you need to then take on the &-uh you know market +... 305525_315545
+, mhm +/.
+, sometime .
job market and get a position and succeed . 316445_321065
without having to go and do anything else . 321845_325225
do a graduate degree . 325305_326225
yeah . 327025_327065
and &-uh therefore &-uh there's a +... 327505_331545
a bunch of aspects and things that are packed together +/. 332865_337625
yeah +/.
+, and &-uh for example I took fifty four courses +/. 339125_342345
+, mhm mhm +/.
+, &-uh two hundred thirty five semester hours +/. 342665_346505
+, uhuh +/.
+, which is like twice as as as twice as much +/. 346625_353305
+, yeah +/. 353605_353905
+, the requirement +/.
+, right right +/. 354045_355665
+, &~u the requirements for undergraduate degree +/. 357505_359145
+, uhuh +/.
+, and then I did a practicum I did the +//. 360225_363085
I wrote a thesis +... 363445_364005
and and then I graduated after +/. 365725_369465
+, ⌈ mhm mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ like ⌋ <seven years> . 370005_370425
that's why and its still +/. 374965_376165
+, yeah +/.
+, <you find a> agronomic engineering thing +/. 376865_379065
+, uhuh uhuh +/.
+, it's basically a combination of plant science and agriculture +/. 379325_383265
+, yeah +/. 383745_384045
+, engineering . 384305_384845
right right I wonder if there's anything like that like at MSU at the sort_of . 384985_390445
oh they have plant science . 390885_391705
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ they ⌋ have plant science and they have &-uh agricultural engineering . 391885_393965
+, uhuh +/.
+, that's what they have +/. 394345_395265
+, yeah +/.
+, so the the guys who know plant science they know about +... 395705_400065
soils and they know about &-um you know crops and stuff +/. 401545_406245
+, yeah +...
yeah +/.
+, and then the other guys the agricultural engineers they know about channels +/. 406665_410685
+, mm +/.
+, and irrigation +/. 411725_412585
+, ⌈ mm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ systems ⌋ &-um all the things that have to do with structures and stuff . 414675_417775
+, yeah +/. 418275_419255
+, agricultural theory +/.
+, right +/. 420095_421455
+, so for us they basically +/. 422655_425595
+, ⌈ it's ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ combined ⌋ +/.
+, yeah +/. 425855_426955
+, all of that with some +/. 427055_427855
+, yeah +/. 427995_428215
+, lots +//. 428355_428735
a_lot_of biology and that sort of stuff . 429175_432255
right +... 432435_432695
so when did you get to thinking about &-um environmental issues and +... 433495_440155
doing a &~nat you know think about natural landscapes say as opposed to farming and . 442205_448005
oh I &~ju I just never felt really comfortable doing what I was doing +/. 448445_454545
uhuh +/.
+, I actually was going into we had the chance of becoming an agronomic engineer I'm an agronomic engineer in systems of agricultural production +/. 455305_467125
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 468445_468845
+, ⌊ that's ⌋ that's my my thing +/. 469145_470745
+, mhm +/.
+, basically like like what I was telling you +/. 471465_473925
+, yeah +/. 474065_474105
+, and then that's the other thing the other mm you can also go for agronomic engineer in &-uh natural +//. 474765_487705
in renewable natural resources +/. 488045_489385
+, mm mm +/. 489565_490505
+, so you could do +... 490885_492645
any of that +/. 493985_496305
+, yeah +/. 496915_497075
+, you have to pick +/. 497415_498035
+, yeah +/.
+, you wanna go into farming you wanna go into natural resources +/. 499215_501435
+, right +/. 501575_502075
+, and &-um I was going into natural resources but then I had to I came to &~Ame to the US and got to study English and stuff +/. 502815_513775
+, mhm +/.
+, in nineteen ninety that I was telling you +/. 513975_515795
+, mhm +/.
+, that &-uh messed me up a bit . 516675_518295
so when I came back I wasn't &-uh not in a very good situation +/. 518735_522515
+, yeah +/. 522615_522815
+, the professors that I was planning on taking classes with +/. 522955_527535

+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/. 535055_535155
+, ⌊ and ⌋ I didn't like that +/. 535255_535915
+, yeah yeah +/. 536815_537755
+, and &-uh so then I decided that the farming thing was easier and I just needed the degrees that +/. 537895_544395
+, mhm +/.
+, anyway I was gonna get a Master's after that +/. 544455_546855
+, mhm +/.

how'd you pick Michigan ? 560935_562695
I actually did a search +/. 563335_567135
mhm +/.

+, and sat for a_couple_of days and +/. 581805_583385
+, yeah +/. 584445_584725

forty something schools +/. 591085_592145
+, &=laughs mhm mhm +/.
+, out_of there sent the letter to all of them I mean actually sent made the letter made forty three copies and said okay this is me and this is what I do +/. 592445_601505

+, and &-uh +... 669135_669535
I thought it was too disrespectful . 670195_674695
+, yeah +/.
+, and I decided +... 675855_676755
<why would I> ?
+, right +/. 678455_679135
+, and and then so &-uh I was actually going to Ohio State . 680535_685815
+, uhuh +/.
+, because they had been more more supportive . 686275_690035
+, uhuh +/.
+, <they more> were understanding . 693455_695175

+, mhm mhm +/.
+, and they said yeah that's fine +/. 722345_723945
+, uhuh +/.
+, so and then they assigned me an advisor and I was talking to my advisor and all that +/. 725965_729985
+, yeah +/.
+, I was ready to move +/. 730125_731105
+, yeah +/. 731305_731665
+, and &-uh then I get this letter from Michigan +... 732085_735765
you've been accepted <such and> such and such +/. 736305_739625
+, mhm +/.
+, and then they talked about the Master's project thing and it sounded really good +/. 739825_745485
+, yeah +/. 745685_746065
+, like the thing we're doing now +/. 747045_748885
+, yeah +/. 748945_749285
+, and &-uh +... 749945_752205
so I came to go to Michigan +/. 753245_755685
+, hm +/.
+, see what happened . 757325_757805
+, yeah +/.
+, because of the reputation of the school +/. 758865_760605

+, &-uh there's like like three or four people there are doing a dual degree with their school the business school +/. 951155_958555
+, uhuh +/.
+, and I don't regard +...
I <I don't> I don't feel they're much &-uh +/.
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I'm ⌋ really not in love with these people .
+, yeah +/.
+, actually they'll +//.
they +//.
their concepts of industrial ecology and that thing that they just are gonna save the world by doing <this and> this and this +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, it's like reducing and cleaning +...
instead of +...
eliminating +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, you know +/.
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ what ⌋ is cheaper ?
+, yup +/.
+, it is cheaper to eliminate emissions or is it cheaper to clean them +/.
+, uhuh +/.
+, clean the mess ?
+, uhuh +/.
+, so +...
&~th that sort of thing .
+, yeah yeah +/.
+, and ah I I don't believe in that I'm not a &~ver I'm not very fond of capitalism +...
+, mm .
yeah +/.
+, in general .
so +...
ah +...
that was <like the> like the dominating group +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, they were trying to make me +...
in in +...
November they wanted +...
they wanted me to invest like +...
five hours or ten hours a week +...
in the project .
+, yeah .
+, and I'm like +...
I don't have time for this now .
+, right +/.
+, we're gonna have the whole next semester to prepare +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, and then the &~who &~who the rest of the whole second year actually +/.
+, uhuh mhm +/.
+, to actually do the thing . 961715_971155
+, right right +/.
+, they were like that and all this business thing and all this beautiful resumes and +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, then it's like Pedro please give us this thing I'm gonna put it in this and this format and I'm gonna look +//.
make it look like <this and> this and that +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, and <and on> and on <and on> <and on> and on +/.
+, so things you weren't really +/.
+, like &-uh +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, and and Jack and and basically and Jack has been very +...
very nice .
very sincere guy +...
very ah very nice person +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, very down to earth but sort_of nerdy +/.
+, <type worker> you know ?
+, yeah +/.
+, and ah Peter I I I haven't had any contact with him .
yeah well maybe we had talked a_couple_of times but nothing nothing much .
Jack <we had talked> .
I actually like liked him before that .
&-um and the group was small +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, and I saw myself fitting very well there .
I could contribute .
so +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, it's been fine so far .
+, great +/.
+, I guess you don't want all those answers huh ?
&=laughs .
⌈ no <I am> I am interested ⌉ in those you'll see .
you've answered some questions that I haven't asked yet .
but that's great .
so the fit is really kind_of important .
not just the topic but &-um <that it> that it work as a group that you feel good in it feel comfortable .
oh yeah xxx really .
+, yeah yeah right +...
I think so too .
people people often sort_of propose group work &~w without really considering how hard group dynamics can be .
you know how crucial they are .
and even issues like deciding what program to be in you know it seems sort_of petty maybe to decide I'm not going to this school because I don't like &-um you know I don't like the guy who I talked to on the phone .
but if that guy's in fact gonna have contact with you often all the time &-um be your advisor +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, whatever then the fact that you don't like him that matters a_lot .
&=laughs I mean &=laughs +/.
+, well yeah +/.
+, yeah &-um .
and I just had a problem with a professor xxx +/.
uhuh +/.
+, I I don't like people not coming +...
straight at me +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, or giving me the things the way they are you know +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, trying to give me I'm a nice person really I just can't help you now .
+, yeah +/.
+, that that sort of thing and and you know it's like it's I just +//.
find that +//.
if you can help me but you won't +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, you tell me that +/.
+, yeah right +/.
+, because I know I'm not an idiot I know that you can +/.
+, right +/.
+, you just won't .
+, yeah yeah +/.
+, maybe because there are so many things that that that you have going .
that so many consequences that you don't want to face .
so many it's gonna get messy for you .
+, yeah +/.
+, but .
that's not the point .
the point is you can but you won't .
+, yeah yeah +/.
+, &~an and and oh no +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, you you you realize we always talk about it we always complain about <it the things in this school> +/. 971155_971255
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, that people don't do people <think of> people do +/.
+, yeah yeah +/.
+, and all this stuff .
I think yeah .
being a student is a really disempowered position .
and also &~i it strikes me how &-um +...
the people who have the power in the institutions &~u &-um like it and preserve it and want it .
but also want it very soft+pedalled .
so <they don't> <they don't want> &-um they don't want to be confronted with it .
&-um and I I think that's a cultural thing I mean I feel it also as a teacher I I like that sense of &-um of open flow of communication and equality in the classroom but we aren't equal .
you know in the end I'm grading them they're really not grading me .
and to say &-um +...
you know come on take a risk .
&=laughs do this do that .
&-um &~i it's +//.
&~a it's easy for me to say because of being kind of insensitive to the +//.
to the facts of the situation .
you know .
so &~i yeah I think that's a problem all over the place .
&=laughs
