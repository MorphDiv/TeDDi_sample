very exciting panel . 365_905
ah the panel is gonna focus mostly on the Freedomways readings so I just wanted to do a little bit of a preview for you setting the stage &-um mostly drawing on the Simmons reading but just on some other general &-um civil rights history . 1785_18805
so Freedomways was established in what year ? 19645_22305
<nineteen sixty one> .
nineteen sixty one . 23745_26825
okay . 26985_27225
so what's happening in nineteen sixty one in the United States ? 27545_32045
the civil rights movement . 34505_36605
the civil rights movement . 36805_36965
okay .
particularly we've already had the Montgomery Bus Boycott . 37225_40105
okay that's happened . 40505_41285
the sit+in movement has started . 41405_43125
alright &-uh Brown_V_Board was a long time before that nineteen fifty four so nineteen sixty one is really in the middle of all of the intense activities of the civil rights movement . 45065_56105
&-um so the civil rights movement is really rolling . 56985_58825
we're going towards Freedom Summer . 59145_61125
you're starting to have more interaction between black activists and white progressive activists who want to become part of the movement +/. 61745_69525
mhm +/.
+, &-um the seeds of SNCC <are being> &~s are being sown everybody know what SNCC is ? 70145_75025
anybody not know what SNCC is ? 75805_77485
okay Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee . 77925_80725
okay I wasn't sure if in the readings &-um that's actually spelled out because the readings kind of patch around the book . 81805_88105
&-um the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee grew out_of the &~si sit+in movement and it was organized by students along with the help of Ella Baker and &-uh Fred Shuttlesworth and other seasoned activists as &~op as a committee to coordinate nonviolent protests against Jim Crow . 88505_110745
primarily in the South but also later in the North . 111505_114325
okay so there's this very exciting intellectual atmosphere in addition to the political atmosphere because most of these committees the committees come out_of the college campuses . 114955_124975
alright so you have this incredible intellectual energy happening at the same time and people going back to consult the works of people like W E B Dubois . 125935_134875
okay and Dubois was already turned on by this movement as well . 135335_138515
so with all this young intellectual energy and happening and all the new kinds of protests happening it's a very different situation than the periods we've been reading about previously in the black press so we've basically come up through World War Two and now we're jumping into the civil rights movement . 139145_157565
well during World War One and World War Two as you all remember the black press was basically pushing for a movement encouraging people to be more radical encouraging people to stand up for their rights using the double V strategy &-um talking about the ills in society around race and very much on the frontlines of black activism . 157995_180835
well once the students once the youth start being the generators of the movement those who own and operate the black press well they're an older generation and so the black press starts to be repositioned to civil rights movements . 181955_198335
so you have an older generation in the black press you have a younger generation in SNCC and populating a_lot_of the movement and SCLC you also have more Southern blacks involved than Northern blacks and most of the press was concentrated in the North and in the West . 199225_213805
okay so because of these trends because of this relative generational and geographic separation from most of the major black newspapers from the movement in the South the black press was more reacting to what was going on in the movement and so as you saw through the Simmons readings there's basically three kinds of reactions that arise . 214475_237255
one is this is great . 238335_240375
okay so &-uh the Defender the Pittsburgh Courier threw their support behind the movement . 241555_246995
alright and they of_course were in the North so their readers weren't bearing the brunt of what was going on down in the South in terms of violence and violation of people's rights but they were supporting it and they were trying to get more Northerners to support . 247915_261975
and also at times encouraging Northern blacks to go down south and help fight . 262315_265995
okay as in the Freedom Rides . 266295_268015
the second reaction was born out_of the still very alive tradition of Booker T Washington's accommodationism which is hold up wait a minute this protest is just going to inflame racial strife . 268785_286045
right and so we have Percy Green and the Advocate taking this tact . 287285_291565
&-um Percy Green who had in &~p in previous generations been a little more radical &-um now was saying you know these young students they're just being inflamed by outside agitators by communists . 292065_304665
and they're ruining the balance that we had achieved here in the South . 305365_308445
and the good Negroes know that this is the wrong way to go about getting your rights . 308625_312765
okay ? 313305_313865
so the accommodationist stripe has a bit of a resurgence in reaction to the civil rights movement . 314185_320645
and then there was a second less radical accommodationist or less you know ugh shuddering &=laughs accommodationist response which was well protests in the streets sit+ins marches these sorts of things they do inflame racial passions and so we don't think that's the right technique . 321225_338645
since Brown_V_Board was successful and since it seems that the Kennedy administration okay everybody knows who John F Kennedy was and that his brother Robert F Kennedy was the attorney general right ? 339215_349895
it seemed at certain points in time that the Kennedy administration was willing to back up court rulings with federal support whether it is sending in troops to desegregate schools or sending in federal marshals to investigate problems there was some semblance of federal support so some accommodationists said let's use the courts as our main conduit for rights . 350585_377245
and this way no one can accuse us of inciting violence because we're using the system . 377705_382305
we're not sitting in and making people throw stuff at us we're not getting on buses and you know <what they> what they saw as inviting white racists to come and bomb buses and things like this so that was another form of accommodationism is that we should use the courts because that's a more &-uh civilized or a less violent form of change . 382935_406655
and it will be slower and it'll take time but this is the right way to do it without too much bloodshed . 407145_413105
okay ? 414025_436965
so out_of this atmosphere in nineteen sixty one we have a new radical incredible journal called Freedomways that is started by black intellectuals and white progressives who feel that there's something missing from the black press as constituted currently .
and so your group leaders will now talk about that publication .
(0.6) .
okay . 447515_447915
&-um we would like to welcome everybody to the unveiling of the new Freedomways two . 448235_454375
&=applause:multiple &{l=READING and I'm Whitney Jones the editor of the new paper and &-um I would like to give you a brief history of what Freedomways is about because we today are taking on the same aim that they had in the past . 455255_469455
Freedomways is born of the necessity for a vehicle of communication which will mirror developments in the &~diverse diversified and many sided struggles of the Negro people . 471345_479745
it will provide a public forum for the review examination and debate of all problems confronting Negroes in the United States . 480445_487205
Freedomways offers a means of examining experiences and strengthening the relationship among peoples of African descent in this country Latin America and wherever there are &~c communities of such people anywhere in the world . 488785_500065
it will furnish accurate information on the liberation movements in Africa itself . 500885_504545
Freedomways will explore without prejudice or gag and from the viewpoint of the special interests of American Negroes as &~well American blacks as_well_as the general interests of the nation . 505505_515765
the new forms of economic political and social systems now existing or emerging in the world today . 516425_523065
Freedomways provides a medium of expression for serious and talented writers for those with established reputations as_well_as beginners &~se seeking a reading audience for the first time . 523845_533805
Freedomways has no special interests to serve save those already clearly stated no political organizational or institutional ties . 534845_542305
those who commit themselves to its support become patrons only of a publication and editorial policy designed to provide an open forum for free expression of ideas . 542735_551475
we openly invite historians sociologists &~econo &~econo &-uh: economists &}l=READING &=laughs &{l=READING &~ar artists workers students all who have something constructive &~con to contribute to this search for truth . 552395_565495
to use this as an open channel of communication that we might unite and mobilize our efforts for worthy and lasting results . 566385_572505
with all that said Freedomways is extremely grateful to those who have contributed to the magazine in tremendous ways . 573345_578705
people like Paul Robeson Ossie Davis Ruby &~Le Ruby Dee Langston Hughes were just a few of the supporters . 579965_586125
W E B Dubois played a crucial role as an advisor to the magazine from the beginning . 586965_591085
he was there from the start of Freedomways until his death . 592185_594525
now we have journalist and editor of Right On magazine Martine Davis honoring him today with an article that she has written . 595725_602465
&}l=READING .
okay well I wrote an I'm writing a article about whether or not &-um the issues that blacks faced in the past whether they're problematic today and first I wanna start off by talking about the article that Dubois had in the first Freedomways and the issues that he discussed . 605075_623855
and I'm gonna put a picture up of him +... 624375_626475
(0.10) okay . 638315_638515
and &-um his article was published in nineteen sixty one and basically he was summarizing everything that blacks had faced from the time of slavery all the way up to the civil rights movement . 638715_650835
so some of the issues that he talked about well first he hit on the fact that blacks originally or initially had no rights whatsoever . 651455_658135
and &-um he spoke about how slavery was a legal &-um it was legal and the government was bound to protect it and how President Lincoln wasn't necessarily an enemy of it that . 659315_671315
he supported it in the South . 671735_672835
but he didn't want it to expand to the North . 673035_675335
and he went on from there to talk about &-um how neither the North or the South in the Civil War was really looking out for the interests of the slaves . 675655_684695
and &-um in the Civil War &-um blacks they wanted to fight for their rights . 685115_690635
they wanted to fight for themselves . 690735_691635
but the government wouldn't allow black soldiers . 691815_694375
but eventually they joined in with the Northern armies . 694715_696915
and slaves became what Dubois referred as a contraband of war that they were property owned by the enemy or owned by the South but the North used to help them win the war . 697595_706535
and eventually we know that the South surrendered and finally there was a reason for the war and that was the freeing of the slaves but Dubois mentioned that even though emancipation came they still weren't technically free they didn't have freedom they were still gonna be discriminated against for years to come . 707075_722955
and from there he went on to talk &~abo well first this keeping track of this here we talked about one issue that they had no rights (0.13) well &=laughs . 723665_746425
you can use the chalkboard actually . 746765_749905
(0.5) .
okay .
&=writing:board and he went on to talk about how well actually the North came in to help with that they sent teachers down into the South and he spoke about how &-um there was the ideal of giving every slave the forty acres and a mule and giving them the vote . 777685_792525
the North didn't want to spread capital among them and they didn't wanna give (th)em the vote so they had no voting rights &=writing:board &-um no social equality &~obvious that goes along with having no rights and basically they were thrown into a caste system and they suffered from &~disenfranch disenfranchisement and color caste . 792845_816665
and .
does everybody understand what caste means ? 817985_819425
no .
no .
&-um do you wanna explain that or do you want me to explain that ? 823385_825605
<that's fine> .
a caste system is where your class and your ethnic group or your religious group or whatever other kind of cultural group you're part of get collapsed together so caste is another way of saying second class citizenship but based on this combination of economic and cultural factors . 826785_845345
so in India they talk about the caste system (be)cause it's based on &-um what region you're from and what level of society you're put in given your religion your economic position and your skin color all glommed together . 845905_861365
so Dubois and some other sociologists like to refer to the American &-uh racial system as also a caste system because it determines so many things in your life . 862345_872505
okay and he also spoke about how there was limited employment &=writing:board and &-um then he's &-um also talked about like the progress that was being made within like the Niagra Movement the n@l double ACP . 874835_897735
and he basically jumped in to well no with World War One that blacks were actually allowed to enter the war but not as soldiers . 897865_907145
and then by the time of World War Two they were allowed to enter the ranks of the army the navy and the air force . 907785_912445
so he was showing like the progress that had been made and as we know like nineteen fifty four the Supreme Court ruled racial discrimination unconstitutional . 912925_920605
but at the same time it still wasn't &~enforce enforced and that led to the sit+ins the bus strikes that were &~h that were happening in the Civil War and he ended the +//. 921385_930045
I mean not the Civil War excuse_me the civil rights movement and he ended his article by saying that it still goes on . 930185_936585
and so a question that I really want you guys to think about is do you think these issues or the issues that they faced then are they still problematic today ? 937785_945505
and in the article that I'm writing or that I wrote it's about whether or not in particular the voting rights is it still at issue today ? 946265_957285
or is it still problematic today ? 957785_958845
so if you hm ? 959345_961245
xxx .
yeah . 962805_963665
so if you think that this is still a a problem today I want you to &-um . 964685_971605
<do we stand up> ?
maybe we ⌈ should stand up ⌉ .
⌊ everybody ⌋ ⌈ everybody like <stand up> ⌉ .
⌊ everybody out_of your seats ⌋ . 972285_974045
levantete@s:fra &=laughs .
xxx <stand up> &=pause_to_stand .
can I get on one side of the room so we can see like who moves and who doesn't ? 982545_985645
okay everybody move like over here to ⌈ the center ⌉ . 986605_989685
⌊ <to the center> ⌋ .
everyone on that side of the room xxx .
to this side ?
what ?
so then like if they agree +/.
oh +/.
+, they can cross if they don't they can stay and if they're not sure everything nothing's been changed they can stay +/.
+, okay +/.
+, in the center .
okay if you think that it is still problematic today I want you to cross the line and go to the other ⌈ side of the room ⌉ . 993105_1009805
⌊ this is ⌋ voting rights .
voting rights . 1010065_1012345
voting rights .
⌈ if you think black voting rights are still a problem ⌉ . 1011645_1012905
+, ⌊ if you're in the middle stay ⌋ in the middle if you think it's not a problem stay where you are on this side of the room . 1012905_1018545
<I'm in the> middle .
so if you're ⌈ unsure you're like in the center ⌉ ? 1020285_1021865
⌊ &~un as extreme ⌋ .
unsure you're in the ⌈ middle ⌉ . 1021885_1022885
⌊ &~uns ⌋ if you're ⌈ unsure ⌉ . 1023085_1023725
⌊ if you think ⌋ that blacks still face obstacles to voting rights or +/. 1023725_1028405
right +/.
+, their ability to vote come to this side of the room if you believe that that is no longer a problem stay on that side of the room if you're not sure stay in the middle of the room . 1028805_1038805
okay . 1039125_1041845
you're like middlers@n ? 1042125_1042765
or .
yeah ⌈ <I'm in the middle of it> ⌉ . 1043225_1044805
⌊ <I'm in the middle> ⌋ &=laughs but . 1045145_1045585
okay .
and <I just> I just want us to discuss this like why are you guys in the middle and why are some of you feel that it is problematic today ? 1046285_1052605
anybody ?
just wait a minute let me think about it . 1057595_1058355
I just think that it's still a problem today because some of the same things that went on like in the past or whatever or back when blacks were first like going through all the things with like the literacy tests or having to do all the things they hadta do to vote in the first place are things &~th are going on now . 1058735_1074175
not that we hafta take tests or whatever now or whatever . 1074395_1076875
but things such as the things that they say happened in Florida or the unfairness or people not being able to like register to vote are still some of the problems that happened to people back before the civil rights . 1077115_1087395
okay . 1086835_1087095
I also think like where they &-uh set up &-uh sometimes where they set up the places to vote are not very &-uh &-uh people friendly <that hasta travel towards> like dependent on where you live or what neighborhood you're from . 1087235_1101055
<it's not good it's> &=laughs . 1101315_1102335
I think like the actual rights are there so it's like technically blacks have the rights but there is like all these other loopholes that they throw in like +//. 1102675_1112035
you know like a a_lot_o(f) &-um there's a large <percentan of> percentage of black males incarcerated who who can't who do who don't have the right to vote so their their &~jo I think that they're &~i &~t twisting it around now and finding different ways to take your vote away . 1112585_1127965
or not market towards black . 1128685_1130065
xxx why are you all in the middle ? 1130945_1133065
Amber down here xxx .
&-um I'm in the middle because it doesn't happen to me so it's hard for me to understand . 1133865_1142565
so I &~don't I don't wanna be over there where I can say like it's fine because I can't say that and I can't say that there is a problem because I don't know .
it's because it doesn't happen to me . 1149985_1151785
and it doesn't mean that I should be deaf to it but that's why I hafta be in the middle . 1151885_1154985
mhm .
others ?
I'm in the middle &~bec like I agree a_lot with what Julia said like the rights are there but I've heard of problems with like people actually being turned away (be)cause polls close too early (be)cause they can't accommodate the amount of people and stuff like that but yeah . 1157765_1175345
they ⌈ xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I think the ⌋ right like the actual rights are there but there are loopholes in the different ways that they're being cheated . 1176005_1182425
other middlers@n ?
yeah going off that like that &~d didn't that even happen like in Detroit ? 1189455_1191775
yeah ⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/. 1192215_1192315
+, ⌊ this like this election ⌋ +/. 1192315_1193595
+, ⌈ yeah mhm ⌉ +/.
+, and stuff ? 1194155_1194195
and so +... 1194735_1195095
I'm in the middle because while it is primarily black it's not all black . 1197315_1206555
&-um then again I don't know a_lot about it &-um +... 1206875_1213115
Abigail ?
well like &-um in addition to the things like the election board officials making like the rules of like &-um when you can register , how you can register , who can vote , you_know what ways the ballot's gonna be cast or whatever +... 1218645_1228305
I do realize there are flaws in that . 1228485_1229565
but I also realize coming from a &-um place where it's predominantly black and all the elected officials people are black that there's a general apathy in the community . 1229945_1236525
sometimes people even if the poll is right there one block away people still don't go they don't take the vote seriously too . 1236805_1242445
so I also realize that you know whether it be misinformation not enough education on the issues that people don't take advantage of the <right that they're given> . 1242425_1251085
yeah I think it's . 1251505_1252645
think that kinda ties in to what I was saying earlier about how they're marketed . 1254205_1257505
I think &-uh <if there> if there is this sense of apathy in the community I feel like a_lot_of people don't feel like their vote matters . 1258085_1264085
you know what I mean ? 1265045_1265485
&-uh I mean I &~f it's kinda like you know they're you know saying &-uh +... 1265705_1272805
so it's made to feel as if they're like a minority and that their vote won't count . 1274885_1278545
⌊ xxx I don't know ⌋ .
⌈ I think that happens with all Americans ⌉ .
okay wait ⌊ stop ⌋ . 1279125_1281265
⌈ okay ⌉ .
cool .
let's . 1281565_1282245
⌊ remain standing ⌋ .
⌈ back to ⌉ your original spaces and xxx a bit more information . 1283105_1287865
thank you for those points though +... 1288825_1292085
okay having done that I just wanted to you guys pretty much touched base on it though . 1294965_1300145
I want to throw up a article about the Florida vote . 1300765_1303565
okay you guys can't see that can you ? 1303965_1306625
well I'll read it .
+, the highlights hm ?
you can just summarize it (be)cause we can't really read it . 1307205_1315045
right . 1315125_1315285
okay and &-um it was entitled Race in the Florida Vote . 1315925_1318925
and some of the points that it made was that a_lot_o(f) minority voters had registered and came out to vote . 1319515_1327635
but many of them were students . 1327955_1328915
but they weren't allowed to vote . 1329335_1330875
and or they were denied the chance to cast in their ballots . 1331775_1334175
and some were told that they were not registered . 1334555_1337235
some did vote . 1337575_1339195
but their ballots were discarded because of faulty machines or confusing instructions and &-um +... 1339455_1344815
&-uh basically &~s some civil rights officials were saying that minorities &-um it was harder for members of minorities than for whites to cast their ballots their cast ballots excuse_me their votes . 1347035_1361415
and &-um mostly this happened in Florida and it said that a high percentage of black voters were required to use cheaper less efficient punchcard systems to register their choices while whites tended to vote in more affluent districts with more reliable optical scanning systems . 1362365_1375805
and computers were not available in many black precincts to help clear up the problems that &-um when they said that &~w that they weren't registered and many voters were they hadta call it in lines were busy so many voters just gave up and went home and the <NC double a@l> &~pres NC double a@l president said that NC &=laughs:multiple +/. 1376645_1406485
it's okay +/.
+, n@l double ACP basketball in the brain said that it was &-um a voting fraud intimidation and &~irregletin irregularities .
and the Voting Rights Act enacted originally to rule out literacy tests and other efforts to keep blacks from the polls does not require evidence of conspiracy to keep minority voters away from the polls but instead the law was &~design to protect &~m minority voters whenever they confront more difficulties than whites in trying to cast their ballots . 1407555_1423755
so basically this is just an example of how this kinda parallels with the literacy test and with the understanding clause how sometimes blacks hadta read a more complex part of the constitution than whites hadta and basically just how it &~s it still goes on today how they try to block it black from blacks from voting . 1424085_1444165
and with that I'm gonna turn it over to the next section . 1444865_1447025
oh no I'm sorry . 1448245_1448885
so having heard this do any wanna change their minds or you still think that it's a problem today ? 1449265_1454245
any of you people who are in the middle ? 1454525_1455705
or are you still in the middle ? 1456265_1457125
I just have a question about whether it's conscious people trying to suppress the black vote or whether it's just a &-um whether it's just +... 1458585_1470545
&~i it's it's just like a a symptom of a symptom of the problem like people are actually I I like I although I agree that it's it's unfair towards blacks I have trouble thinking that people are actually consciously saying okay let's make sure that they're worse machines and let's close the polls a little bit earlier . 1473945_1491185
&~a &~a &~a and I would &~th &~just &~bec I listened to a_lot on the radio when they were doing the the the original voting and there &~w there was a big debate over over voter responsibility and where was the line between when voters just weren't educated &~e educating themselves about the the voting +/. 1493815_1508055
mhm +/.
+, so .
that &-um that makes me ask like two questions like &-um one is it less of a problem if it isn't a conscious decision but it is a a strong reality ? 1510955_1520675
like &~i should the question be like is it conscious ? 1520915_1523075
or should the question be like you know what is the problem ? 1523395_1526395
how do we solve the problem ? 1526515_1527375
like a_lot_of things have been &~unco you know a_lot_of instances of racism or discrimination or whatever have been not exactly like acts of volition . 1527535_1537635
and then the second question that it makes me raise is that if we as a society realize that &~the these are problems now and we then choose not to do anything about it and then we then &~n choose not to ask the questions that are arising then then does it become like a cognizant effort to like not deal with the problem ? 1537815_1559315
because we're aware of the problem when we don't deal with it . 1559835_1563275
also that's a good point is that now that they're +//. 1563965_1566405
the problem is known and that it disproportionately affects people of color now that we know that if we don't solve it then it is +//. 1567045_1574505
we've made a nondecision that is a decision that has racial implications . 1574905_1577945
the second thing is is that some of the other things in that article that Martine didn't mention is that state troopers stopped vans that had been +//. 1578605_1586205
carpools that had been organized to bring elderly black voters and people without cars to the polls and they said oh you're acting as a taxi you don't have a taxi license and they gave them a ticket and they set up blockades in front of <in the> in the routes to the polling places and they only stopped black filled cars . 1586455_1606435
&-um they also asked election officials asked black voters for ID which you don't need . 1607175_1613735
and if they didn't have it they wouldn't let them vote but then the white person behind them was not asked for any identification . 1615665_1620785
&-um so smaller scale very deliberate &-um &~s instances have been documented of people . 1621845_1629225
I mean there was actually a white reporter who was at a polling place just doing the basic it's election day . 1629365_1634245
I'm gonna be at this polling place . 1634405_1635405
and a couple black people said +"/. 1635825_1636865
+" come over here and film this . 1637105_1638405
and the election officials ran her out of the polling station . 1638885_1643225
and she went back to her station and tried to report this . 1643985_1647385
and state troopers followed her all the way back to her station . 1648045_1650425
and she testified for the n@l double ACP hearing . 1651465_1653485
so it was both a mix of deliberate and nondeliberate actions that &~prosu produced the result of <in Florida> . 1653665_1661085

how many actresses let alone african american actresses have been able to stay in the spotlight for so long ? 1790405_1795865
&-um but no matter how accomplished her career is her greatest legacy will always be her unwavering support for equal rights for all regardless of race and sex . 1796585_1806065
&-um just a little bit about Ruby Dee she was born in &~Octob on October twenty seventh in Cleveland Ohio . 1806905_1813505
&-um her mother abandoned her and she was raised by her father and stepmother and growing up in Harlem the capital of black activism at the time Ruby had a keen awareness of racism from an early age . 1814145_1826965
following the example of her stepmother a schoolteacher and activist she knew early on that she wanted to educate people and change their lives for the better . 1828005_1835685
&-um theater was her outlet and by her freshman year at Hunter College in New York she was acting with the American Negro Theater . 1836465_1843085
at this time she befriended another talented performer and activist Harry Belafonte and the two became lifelong partners in fighting for civil rights . 1843985_1852105

and even have you +//. 2085065_2085745
like even saying that &-um the article At the Emmys Ruby Dee is talking about &-um her nomination for an Emmy Award . 2085755_2096535
and how she says she's thinking she's in the audience and she says &{l=READING black actresses for over a quarter of a century still waiting for the big break tired of the neglect the indifference to material substance about black people and I can only have thirty seconds . 2097275_2111055

I wouldn't say definite . 2380905_2384025
you used the word definite improvement . 2384205_2385525
and that's totally not out there . 2385925_2388105
and so I guess somewhere I should be on the line between improvement and somewhat stayed the same because you've gotten to the point where at this time black actresses are being pulled into mainstream movies and television roles . 2388265_2403325
but at the same time there hasn't been that many of them . 2403485_2406985

while at the same time it's it's interesting . 2410365_2412465
&-um just throwing out an example Lela Rochon I believe some movie she was in just in she was talking about where she's paired as the lead against a white actor . 2412625_2420665
and when it was originally written there was supposed to be a romantic interest there . 2421485_2425085
but once they put her there as the lead actress romantic interest goes <out the> &~way out the window so I think while there has been some very small gradual improvement there's still a_lot that needs to be done . 2425445_2436905
other improvement ?

I did have one thing to say like that some of those like are are &~c comedies . 3019035_3025915
and they were like meant to be that . 3026055_3027355
and they &~w we have like some black serious roles that like counteract that . 3027515_3030895
just like people would say something <if we wanted to do the same thing> and show like white actors people would say that Jim Carrey or somebody represented you know the best of what like white actors could be that was just . 3031115_3040475

like we're saying like we understand . 3043075_3044835

<anything that you wanna add> ?
&-uh maybe this is a good topic for later like larger discussion but I also think you have to look with both of these questions if have to look at like the larger context and with these with the voting and with the entertainment industry . 3083325_3092245
it's like of_course there're gonna be &~int improvements in the black industry because there are more people who own theaters like Magic or people who can produce their own films and stuff like that so of_course you're gonna get a different portrayals and saying that there's not any improvement at all it's just like ridiculous . 3092365_3105165
you know you can't discredit like a Cicely Tyson and Sounder and those other films that just made a definite impact in &~h showing drama without any comedic aspects you know . 3105225_3114605
I mean I think we can just say that just because <wasn't blew up> in the mainstream you know and there are plenty of films that open that don't get any support from the audience at all and they have to close (be)cause you know nobody goes to see them . 3114845_3125705
I just wanted to say that like when we look at like the images of like since you brought up like the images of like blacks versus whites in the media and like you know what we see like I think that indistinguishable from those roles are the control of these images . 3128685_3145485
black people do not tend to control the images of black people and I think that like that's something to take into consideration . 3146065_3152145
not that I'm &~clai like &~s I feel like there's a difference &~n now between like the buffoonery or whatever you wanna say today because there is like a choice involved with it . 3152465_3165325
whereas in the past there wasn't necessarily that choice . 3165505_3167485

like I don't watch it . 3183275_3184115

this is like what they wanna do you know . 3189675_3191195

+, so . 3347715_3349195
well I know it wasn't the best portrayal but it was a big hit . 3349475_3352395
no I'm just saying it is a big hit I mean there's a there's a_couple_of questions I just wanna unravel then before we move to the next point about control so we had a hard time there are no black movie studios that independently produce films . 3352515_3364495
even Spike Lee's films are in conjunction with Paramount . 3364915_3368715
I believe . 3369315_3369655
so in terms of who has the money to produce film and who owns the studio space and everything like that that's all basically white folks . 3370195_3378715
but but can we really name white people who own those companies too ? 3379015_3382095
but they own (th)em ⌊ it's common knowledge that they own xxx ⌋ &=laughs . 3382235_3384355

⌈ people that own ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ white people ⌋ I mean you can't go through Hollywood and television without noticing that every CEO every major producer is white . 3404855_3414275
and there's enough evidence out there that shows that when when black actors and actresses are thought of for roles that are colorblind roles it shifts the script significantly so the example you came up +//. 3415025_3429165
the love interest drops out . 3429325_3430925
did anybody see the Pelican Brief ? 3431065_3432565

+, Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington ? 3433125_3434605
in the they're supposed to have a love affair . 3435125_3437445
do you ever see them kiss or naked in bed together ? 3437825_3440345
it was cut out because they thought audiences weren't ready for that . 3440745_3445565
so these ideas of who the audience is and what they're ready for when &~Wai Waiting to Exhale took tons of years to put together . 3446825_3453265
it wasn't until Whitney Houston +//. 3453465_3454625
okay even with Angela Bassett and all those other good actresses it wasn't until Whitney Houston signed on (be)cause &~sh they thought oh crossover appeal . 3455085_3461385
she has lots_of white music fans so maybe they'll come to the movie studio . 3461545_3464605
they'll come to the movies as well . 3464865_3466225
it wasn't until she signed on that that movie could get made it's a million bestseller book being made into a movie and people thought a movie about four black women nobody'll go see it and nobody meant white people won't go see it . 3466945_3479805
so if you look at the market research that gets done and if you look at the struggles that black script writers and filmmakers have had in getting their films made and raising money &-um there's still a climate that white people are only ready to see blacks in particular ways . 3481465_3499065
and so even with the success of Waiting to Exhale and The Best Man you don't all the sudden see a slew of multicultural films coming out every year . 3501025_3508965
if you look at all the Oscar nominees &-um if you look at the top ten grossing film sometimes you have &-um people of color in significant roles there but even with that box office success it hasn't resulted in kind_of like a watershed . 3509185_3524185
like every couple of years you get <do do> do do do <do do> do do do and then it kind of goes away . 3524985_3528805
&-um so if you look at the patterns actually of casts and filmmaking and television making I mean after The Cosby Show the number one show ever in history more viewers than any other show even Ozzie and Harriet even the Honeymooners any show in television history . 3529585_3545825
and what does NBC have on its docket that has an all black cast ? 3546105_3550525
nothing . 3551325_3552605
it made NBC billions of dollars and is still making billions of dollars in syndication +/. 3552805_3556985
+, mhm +/.
+, so the idea of whether or not it's a success or whether or not people come isn't necessarily what the decision making is about . 3557945_3565125
because people of color are still seen as a risk for a_lot_of people in the industry . 3566845_3572725
that's why even though Latinos are the largest nonwhite group in the country how many Latino shows do you see on TV ? 3573865_3580525

you know you're all here in this class together no big problem . 3647175_3650895
minorities watch more TV than white people . 3651355_3660315
exactly so the WB and UPN and Fox couldn't have been successful without minority viewers because they were putting on Martin they were putting on In Living Color and this drew huge audiences completely mixed so but still it seems like UPN and WB are the two networks where you can &~o &~a the only two where you can consistently find casts with lots_of black faces . 3653005_3678405
rather than just one here one there you know doctor Peter_Whatshisface on ER or Gideon or whatever . 3678955_3685215
so if you think of it in more global terms and you think about the kind_of decision making processes that are behind &-um economic and cultural decision making processes it's pretty clear from the research that +//. 3685555_3699735
I know that if you're thinking in terms of proportionality if you think in terms of economics that there's really no concrete reason why we don't see a more multicultural media landscape in terms of the mainstream . 3699815_3712375
and that's nothing for anybody to feel guilty about personally but it's something to think about in terms of your consumption habits . 3712895_3719135
so let us move on to our next set . 3719895_3726415
okay and kinda tying in &-um with what we were just talking about like &-um in the nineteen sixty six number one reader that's <in your> &-uh in your course pack &-um Sarah Wright noted that &-um one can hardly pick up a book which does not advertise naked or suggestively naked &-um african american women . 3727545_3749705
and we just happen to have the Vibe magazine like sittin(g) up here . 3750485_3755805
Amber's gonna use it for her presentation and I just started flipping through the magazine and like I just found so many like just suggestively just african american women like and this is a magazine that's targeted at african american yeah african american but all through the magazine there's pictures like this there's pictures with less less clothing on .
&-um she also notes that in popular music of our time it is in what she calls a supreme state of chaos and she says that the reduction of women in song to mere sexual animals <is at> &-um is at a the point beyond which it could go no further so she's saying like ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 3778665_3795825

it's like four guys you know . 3816585_3818385
&~a I I have the CD so I mean I was just thinking like what's that saying ? 3818725_3822285
but &-um it's like four guys in the video they're just surrounded by all these beautiful women wearing bikinis and basically they're talking about screwing all these girls . 3822445_3829725
&-um I thought about the Thong Song which probably more of you guys know . 3830465_3833045
and he's talking about that the girl that dumps like a truck and guys like what and tell her to move her butt and let (th)em let (th)em see her thong . 3833225_3839965
