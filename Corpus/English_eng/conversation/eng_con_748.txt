&~www .
yesterday I was sitting down with my dog .
and the frog jumped out_of the jar .
and it went out the window .
I couldn't find it anywhere .
and so <I got my shirt and my &-um> I got changed into my
the dog jumped out the window and smashed the jar here .
I got a bit annoyed with him .
but he licked me all over .
and I was okay .
I looked around and shouted for him .
but I couldn't find him .
<I went around> I went to the <b(ack)> back of my garden ,
and &-um a little creature jumped out and bit me in the nose ,
&-um the hive fell and started to attack my dog , while I was
&-um the bees chased my dog away and <kno(cked)> knocked me off
actually I think it may have been the bird .
okay .
&-um the bird followed me and left me alone and sat in the tree .
and my dog whimpered back , probably injured .
then while I was standing on a rock , a big deer picked me up with
only a small cliff into a river .
<I went> I was in the river .
and <though> we looked up .
and we saw there was a log .
and we heard something .
<I went> <I kept> I told the dog to keep quiet and looked
and there was two of the frogs sitting there , really happy .
then more little frogs came .
<and> and then suddenly I saw the frog that I lost .
I picked the frog up and said goodbye to the nice frogs .
