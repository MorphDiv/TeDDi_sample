okay . 3265_3445
so we have, as you know, been working on fraction multiplication . 3885_7965
and we've been working with these two mentor problems, Kamila and Jesus' problems with the string, right ? 8825_14165
yes . 14425_14905
okay . 15485_15665
so what I wanted to do before we go on with today's lesson, is do a quick check-in about what we talked about on Wednesday, okay ? 15845_23145
so on Wednesday we were talking about these two words, whole and part . 23345_27885
and we don't really know one-hundred percent what we want to say yet, but we had some ideas around whole and part, and how they're reflected in these problems . 28855_37255
so, Jesus somehow has something about a whole, w-h-o-l-e, and something about parts, and the same thing for Kamila . 38435_45795
so take a moment, turn to a neighbor . 46115_47515
what do you remember about whole things and part things in these problems ? 47675_50675
just real quick .
xxx .
all right .
if we can come back together . 88655_89755
so I heard some ideas from quite a bit of the fraction work we've been doing . 90775_94275
some of the stuff that went to these problems . 94515_96035
some of your conversations were about wholes just in fractions in general . 96235_99835
so let's see if we can recall, because this will be helpful for the work you're doing today . 100415_104595
Jesus is inventing a math game, he needs hmm pieces of string . 105075_109715
each piece needs to measure hmm feet long . 109975_113495
how much string will he need in total ? 113995_115275
where would we find whole, w-h-o-l-e . 115515_116955
and parts in this problem ? 119415_120495
you guys told me this on Wednesday . 121135_122395
S_one ?
you needed the whole and the +... 124055_126175
so he needs the whole . 126515_128095
and he knows the pieces . 128635_129875
and he already knows the pieces . 130535_135755
okay . 137675_137995
and was Kamila's problem the same way ? 138555_140335
no . 140515_140815
Kamila's also inventing a math game . 140935_142655
she has hmm feet of string . 142795_144995
she decides she only needs hmm of that length for her project . 145415_148595
how long will that piece of string be ? 148855_150015
so what was going on with wholes and parts for Kamila's string problem ? 150675_154615
S_three ?
she already had the whole and she needed the pieces . 156075_160995
so she already had the whole and she's trying to figure out her pieces . 161495_166815
needs to figure out her pieces . 167215_168235
amaybe one piece or maybe multiple pieces . 172015_173715
okay, good . 174755_175475
I think that was what we talked about . 176355_179195
thank you . 179695_180175
so what I have today for you is basically, same thing . 180875_184135
so here are eight more problems and what you're going to do first is read them . 185975_191815
that's very helpful . 192275_192715
and then the second thing you're going to do is you're going to think about, are any of these problems a lot like Jesus' problem where he already knows his pieces or his parts, but he needs the whole amount ? 193185_203085
and are any of these problems really like Kamila, where she needs the pieces because she already has the whole ? 203805_209685
okay . 210505_210865
so that's step one . 211025_211705
step two is if you think you've had that conversation, you've read and you've talked to your partner and you agree, maybe cut and sort them into two different groups . 212595_221315
you'll notice there's two blanks . 221935_222955
leave them alone . 223235_223595
you'll need them later . 223695_224275
okay . 225095_225195
any questions ? 226095_226935
after you do that if you're waiting for us to come back together, please try to solve them . 227555_232295
maybe draw a picture . 232595_233315
maybe just talk it out . 233875_234855
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight . 235115_239135
okay . 239255_239395
and the problem said eight crayons ? 239945_241345
yes . 241685_242365
okay . 242685_242885
so you have eight crayons, which is funny, because it's your problem . 243185_245585
okay .
so you have your eight crayons and then what were you thinking ? 246185_248385
since she says I needed one half, I took one half of each crayon . 248925_255865
okay . 255965_256105
so can you show me where your one half that you took was ? 256265_258405
so I took this half from this crayon and then took this half from this crayon . 258665_263425
each half is from one crayon . 263645_266185
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight . 265845_269125
okay . 269445_269485
I see that . 269865_270685
eight twos because the denominator always stays the same . 271665_277445
why does the denominator always stay the same ? 277665_279385
because it's the same always denominator right here in the fraction . 279625_284645
but why would +... 285385_286025
so I see that these are all twos, but remember at the beginning, some people were saying two, plus two, plus two, plus two, plus two . 286225_291785
how come you're not doing that ? 292325_293565
how do we know that the answer here at the end is going to still have a denominator two ? 294825_300745
well, because the two, it always stays the same, so it's always a two . 301025_308665
what does the two tell us ? 308705_309925
it has two pieces . 310425_313245
two pieces in the +... 313985_315125
in the whole . 316205_316565
in the whole, okay . 316745_317365
so it's the same size pieces all the time . 317585_319445
and when we get to the end, it's still the same size . 319885_321405
yeah . 321785_322005
okay . 322305_322585
and you had eight over two . 323225_324545
and then I see you turn that into a division because we talked about the connection between fractions and division . 325385_329625
yeah .
and you got an answer of four . 330405_331365
yeah . 331765_332065
okay . 332365_332605
I see how you did all of that . 332725_334345
so my thing that I'm still wondering about is if you actually had a box of crayons and you were going to get half of those crayons, would you snap all of your crayons in half, and then take half of the blue and half of the red and half of the green ? 334785_347485
what would you actually do if somebody said here's eight crayons, take half ? 348395_351315
I would take four because +... 351675_359435
so if I do two times four equals eight, I'll just get four crayons . 361255_369235
oh, which is interesting because it's the same answer you've got by snapping all the crayons in half . 370055_374295
but in the actual world we live in, would you be more likely to do the snapping in half version or the “divide by two, I'm taking half of the crayons and that's four” ? 375785_384825
divide by two . 385185_385985
but isn't that puzzling that they came out the same ? 386405_389025
yeah . 389305_389505
it's a little interesting . 390325_391125
and I think we may have to dig a little more into that, why they turned out the same, even though they're two different pictures in my imagination . 391285_397385
okay . 397765_398845
I like how you reasoned your way through that though . 398985_400525
thank you for sharing that . 400825_401485
0 +...
these problems . 407575_408275
and I kind of know some are like Kamila's and somewhere like Jesus', and that might be helpful for me to think about solving the problem . 409375_414555
this could also be helpful to solve the problem . 415535_417615
so here's Rosalinda's drawing . 418415_420775
she has a box of eight crayons, but she decides to only use half . 421595_424915
do you see any picture that might be a way to represent her eight crayons, but she's only using half ? 425035_430095
this one . 430595_430775
okay . 430995_431195
that's your opinion . 431315_431835
what do you think, S_six ? 432115_432615
I don't know if I'm going with that one or this one . 436525_438845
okay .
so you think +... 439485_439825
oh, that's interesting, because this one also has halves and there's eight boxes . 440065_443825
that's a good point . 444925_447285
so there's eight boxes of half and here's an eight box cut in half . 447445_451545
so what I'd like you to do is, I'd like you to talk about which one better represents Rosalinda's problem . 452225_457805
and then if you'd like to, feel free to get scissors from table four and cut and put them together . 458485_464025
I will warn you, there are, I think two word problems that don't have pictures . 466165_470905
so if you find those two that don't have pictures, feel free to try drawing out what that might look like . 471465_475765
okay . 476405_477145
so right now I think your discussion needs to be around Rosalinda, Rosalinda . 477625_482345
which one is hers ? 482725_483705
so I'm going to hang out for a little bit and just hear what you guys have to say about it . 484005_488225
we already know the whole, right ? 489445_490985
yeah . 491345_491645
we just need to cut it in half . 492865_494705
but then this one, it is just half, half, half, half, half . 494945_498085
we have eight halves . 499305_501585
two halves make one whole so then two halves, two halves, two halves . 501985_506985
it's only four . 507545_508345
four wholes . 508605_510165
so we already know the whole . 511125_513685
so it's this one then, there's only four . 514665_517725
it says eight, right here . 518305_519205
use half of it . 519385_520625
so the box that has just eight kinds, but I have to use just half . 522265_526845
so probably I think it's this one because I have just one box and then I just have eight crayons, but I just need half of one, of each one . 527645_540965
and then this one, there's eight boxes . 542785_545105
but wouldn't it be the same if you cut them apart and use the same colors ? 545805_549905
but wouldn't it have been the same ? 550545_551885
yeah, but it's because she has a box of eight crayons . 553185_556705
so I just have one box that has eight crayons . 556725_559445
and then I just need to use one half of each one, but I don't have eight boxes . 560225_566325
no . 567005_568145
I said you have a box of eight crayons . 568265_571405
so basically one box has eight crayons, they have to use just one half of each one . 571605_577145
so, and this one it's just eight boxes of crayons . 579465_585465
and then this is just eight crayons and these are eight boxes . 585605_591245
so I think this one is the one that I'm guessing it's from, mine because it's just eight crayons, that's it . 592825_602825
there's no eight boxes of crayons . 603125_606185
well, I disagree with you . 608515_610355
I think it's this one because you have one box of crayons, and you're using half . 610995_617455
if you cut them in half, you'll be using the same color . 617795_621935
get it ? 622975_623355
like if I snap this pencil in half ? 623795_628075
yeah . 628495_628635
if you're using this half and then you have to cut them in half, you'll still be using the same colors, but it will be half . 629125_637505
yeah . 639165_639305
wait, it'll be half of the crayons . 639905_641625
okay . 641725_642025
okay . 643165_644425
well I think you convinced me . 644805_647605
only six pieces of string and two thirds of a foot long . 648785_654085
so then, let's see . 654605_655385
there are six pieces . 658225_659105
one, two +... 659865_660185
this one's half . 661205_665925
it's supposed to be whole and then pieces . 666105_667665
but we know the pieces . 671845_673285
oh yeah, yeah, yeah . 674085_677005
okay .
the whole is missing here, right ? 679025_680845
I thought this one was the one that was missing . 680845_682345
so this one's right . 682905_685305
and then this one ? 686305_687025
Sophia plans to wrap a birthday present for her friend . 687305_690105
she has a long ribbon, but doesn't need all of it . 690525_694025
in fact, she decides that she only wants to use two third of a six foot long ribbon to wrap the gift . 694425_700385
how much ribbon does Sophia +... 700685_702305
that one's right . 703405_705485
there's three and two . 705565_706685
so these three don't match . 708405_709565
let's just make sure one more time . 709785_711185
Antonio found eight xxx . 716395_718315
wait .
but all three of these are whole and none of these three show whole . 718375_726355
they only show the pieces . 727275_728135
maybe we saw it wrong . 729435_731635
and then this one doesn't go with any pictures because there's no +... 735595_740095
yeah, this one is not a good picture . 742055_744015
I think this picture is trying to trick us for this one, because see, there's a number two and then the fours . 745205_751945
so I think that one is trying to trick us, so that picture doesn't match at all . 752565_756445
triple the recipe . 757945_762785
so then we have to +... 763145_764165
it's like a rectangle and three pieces . 766205_770085
then I'll try and make them equal . 781365_783025
so bad . 784545_785345
then three-fours, one three-fours, one three-fours, and then how did they draw them again ? 787885_803485
sorry .
I guess I'll have to draw them like the +... 808645_810005
and then we'll put this here and then you draw the next one . 810665_818485
it says one . 820465_821385
it's not half . 821565_822405
yeah . 822685_822845
it's one .
it says one . 823065_823645
so nine and a half . 823965_825165
you try and do it then . 825245_825925
so you have to draw a rectangle . 826665_832025
a rectangle ? 832525_833625
we have to make a rectangle . 834165_836285
make a rectangle but the opposite of me, she needs the pieces and xxx . 847445_852965
he needs the pieces . 853245_855745
so split in the middle I think . 856465_862125
so she has one side, and then you put the question mark on the bottom, I think . 862945_867725
because that's how they did it . 868945_870085
he has the whole, but they need the pieces . 870425_875185
they know the whole . 876325_877445
what's the whole again ? 877985_879065
the whole was a half . 880265_881565
half . 882225_883045
you put half, because I thought you were drawing +... 883725_893365
so you only need the rectangle on the bottom . 893585_895085
I just want to +... 895565_898605
half of that, half of this . 905005_907005
like half of that . 907365_908985
just make it +... 910425_916045
question mark here . 919485_921365
yeah . 922545_923445
then make a line here . 932805_933425
like that ? 933425_933445
yes, just two here . 933505_933885
just two here . 934005_934585
you made the box tiny . 936565_948325
yeah .
these two don't match . 955125_957205
