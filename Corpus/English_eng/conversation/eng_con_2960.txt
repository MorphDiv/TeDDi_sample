just tell me <what you remember> .
<on tuesday> Lisa and Raymond came home .
and their mom asked them where they wanted to go &*INV:mhm out to
and they both yelled Mcdonalds .
so they drove to Mcdonalds .
and &-um Lisa was still thinking whether whether she wanted a
I couldn't think of the name .
<mhm> .
<and> Raymond wanted <I think> a happy meal and whatever
and their mom wanted a Big_Mac with +...
but then I don't think it said what drink .
Lisa had a Doctor_Pepper I think yeah .
and the total was twelve dollars and fifty cents .
and their mom reach for her purse and notice that it wasn't there
good .
that's about the best I can say .
okay .
Josh &-um woke up in the morning <to a> for a very bad start .
his alarm clock didn't go off .
and he was already late for school .
<he got or no um> he went downstairs to make some cereal for
he had applejacks .
and <as he &~w> he poured in the cereal <not very much or>
and then he spilled a lot a milk all over .
<he went upstairs to get dressed> and then Josh went upstairs
and he couldn't tie his shoe .
and then finally he pulled so hard that the shoelace just came off
he thought <like> it was gonna be the worst day he ever had .
so he started walking outside and noticed the school bus just left
and he <&~st> started chasing after it .
but he couldn't catch up .
and he didn't feel very good about that .
mhm .
and he walked all the way to school .
and as <he she &~ca> he came into school his teacher was
his teacher her name was Ms_postin .
and &-um she was really mad .
and he hadta go get a tardy slip .
obviously that was the worst day of his life .
&-um on tuesday john and Ashley were playing in the park when they
they ran behind the bush <so> because they didn't know what it
all of a sudden this giant ship came down and landed .
out <come> came <five people or> five things .
mhm .
&-um one was some kind of alien pet .
<looks &~li> one looked like a little sister another the mom
and they all looked really weird .
and each of them had eight little tentacles sticking out where
Ashley was excited .
<she ran out> she tried to run out .
but john grabbed her arm .
don't do it .
she said forget it .
and she ran out .
the people didn't seem to be as nice as they thought they were .
instead they took Ashley and <took her back> took them back to
hm: .
I can't really think of anything .
the end
