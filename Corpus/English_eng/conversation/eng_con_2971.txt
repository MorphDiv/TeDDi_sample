so our first discussion question is, why did he write two different accounts ? 345_6305
okay, so I'll start off with you raising your hand, but just be aware that I will probably start calling on groups at random too, so just be ready for it, so why do we think that he wrote two different accounts ? 6845_18865
S_one, what did you guys say ? 19225_21145
it's because it shows both of them being a prisoner, but in the first one, he was being treated nicely by the chief, and in the second one, he was threatening to kill John . 22355_36955
okay, so he's writing two different accounts because we know that they're different . 37275_42675
okay . 42855_43135
before we go on and take a couple more questions, I'm just going to restate what I said earlier on in class, if I am talking or another classmate is talking, you are quiet and you are listening, okay ? 44465_57265
so that is what you are doing when we're having a class discussion, all right ? 57385_60785
you're listening, so then you can respond to what a classmate is saying . 60845_64985
okay, so S_one said he wrote two accounts because he had two different stories, kind of ? 65105_70545
all right . 70825_71725
well, that's true, but I want us to dig more into the meat of it because it's really only one event, so it should only have one story . 72115_81775
there should really only be one true story . 82135_84635
so what I'm kind of trying to ask is only one of these should really be true, so which story is true ? 84895_95755
why is he writing two different accounts ? 95875_97695
why don't we just have one story that's always the same about this one event happening ? 97785_102185
because it's the same person that's writing it, so why are there two accounts of the same story ? 102425_106525
okay, S_two, what'd you guys say ? 107425_109045
I don't think it's the same story . 109405_111345
I think the first one was after he was threatened to get hit in the head . 111485_117965
okay, so you don't think that he's talking about the same event in both of them ? 119625_123225
well, where would you find evidence of +... 124675_126815
like, in the document, where would you find some evidence to support that idea that it's not the same event ? 126975_132735
because we know that it was really only captured once . 132815_135795
so he was only captured by the Powhatan once, so we need to have some evidence in the document to support that it was two different times . 136095_144155
okay, S_three, what do you think ? 144975_146795
well, I'm going to agree with S_two, and in the document, it didn't say really anything about capturing . 147955_157795
it said he arrived there . 158075_159975
in the first one, it didn't say anything about capturing . 160495_163115
and on the date, it says sixteen-oh-eight, and on document B, it says sixteen-twenty-four . 163375_168295
well, sixteen-oh-eight and sixteen-twenty-four are just the dates that he's actually writing these . 169155_173255
it's not when the event took place, but you are saying that maybe these happened at two separate times, maybe he's not supposed to actually be talking about the same event . 173355_183435
but then, I guess we have the question of both of them are talking about his first meeting with the Powhatan, so why wouldn't he have shared the fact that they tried to kill him in that first book ? 184095_196575
that's, I guess too, what I'm trying to get at, is why wouldn't they say that ? 197115_200155
S_four, what do you think ? 201045_201625
well, I think he wrote the second story for his book because the second story sounds a lot like the movie, and yeah . 202085_219345
okay . 220285_220625
so the second story sounds a little bit more like the movie . 220925_224785
so why would he write that for his book ? 226585_230185
because you mentioned something earlier, there's something on your paper . 230325_233305
he wrote a second story for his book, so his story could be more interesting, and then his books would sell faster . 233845_243025
that's what I put .
okay, so now S_four is kind of thinking of something else . 243625_246745
so normally, when people write books, you are writing them for money, right ? 246945_250825
a lot of times authors write them for money . 251025_253165
so now, S_four's saying, well, maybe he's writing it, and he is adding this in to make it a little +... 253305_258525
was the second one a little more interesting, guys ? 258845_261045
yes . 261225_261565
yeah, so maybe he's like, oh, I want to sell my book . 261965_264825
I want to make it more interesting . 264925_266025
so yeah, maybe he's elaborating or adding some stuff in to make his book more interesting . 266205_270865
anybody want to comment on that ? 271265_272925
anybody has something else to say about that ? 273025_274865
S_six ?
well, the first one, it's really that he just got there, so he probably didn't think it was such an interesting topic . 277435_285635
and maybe when Pocahontas had made a big media splash, and then maybe she died, he was trying to make the Pocahontas thing rise up again, so maybe he was trying to make it more interesting so that he could get more money or something . 286135_300875
okay, all right . 301515_303075
there was a lot in what S_six just said, so we're going to try and take it apart piece by piece . 302725_307505
so, S_six's saying, going along with what S_four said too, that he wants to sell his book . 307725_313345
but now she's pointing to another event on the timeline, that Pocahontas made a big media splash . 313485_319245
people are interested in Pocahontas, so maybe something that didn't seem like such a big deal back in sixteen-oh-eight, when nobody knew who Pocahontas was, it didn't make sense to really include it in a book . 319245_330925
but now that Pocahontas is a big deal, and he wants to make more money, now maybe he's thinking, maybe I can include this story, now . 331105_337905
make it a little bit more interesting . 338125_339245
does that kind of go over what you said too ? 339565_341425
okay, let's do some groups I haven't heard from . 342005_344345
S_seven, I didn't hear from you guys . 344465_345925
maybe, for document A, he was trying to sugarcoat the whole thing, so he doesn't tell all that happened to him . 346735_357635
okay, I like where you're going, but I want to know why, then . 358735_365295
so maybe he did sugarcoat it, so maybe he does kind of lighten it, and not seem like he had this terrible experience with the natives . 365495_372535
why ? 372715_373195
can anybody think of why he might try and sugarcoat this ? 373545_377205
maybe he might be tortured again because he told them all that they did to him ? 377725_382705
okay, so maybe he's worried about retaliation . 382965_385865
so maybe he's worried about somebody coming back at him about something . 386045_388745
S_eight, I haven't heard from you yet . 389305_390445
maybe, he wrote the first one as a lie because he suffered xxx and then once Pocahontas got the media splash, he got more money from the book . 391255_402955
okay .
so wait, I'm sorry, do you think the first one is a lie ? 403955_409755
yeah . 410035_410355
and once Pocahontas came around, he thought, you know what ? 411115_414475
I'm going to share what I know now to make more money because she's more interesting now ? 414505_420585
mm-hmm . 420605_421145
okay . 421305_421485
all right . 422065_422225
and actually, I want to take a minute because we do have a couple more minutes in class . 422865_426405
so here's what I want you to do because I want to get an idea of where we all stand here and give everyone the chance to show me . 426665_431745
