(...) what could be a good name for a dog ?

Eskimo .
that's a white dog .
Odie's peeking his nose into the <frog> frog's jar .
then one night the frog was thinking to himself I'm sick of being
I'm breaking out .
the next morning when I woke up <the> <my> my pet frog
<I> the first thing that I did was get dressed and went
but +...

<yeah> Eskimo slipped his head inside of the jar .
and he got his head stuck .
<I went outside> <I went out the window> <I looked>
<he looked in his> I looked in my boots .
and he wasn't there while eskimo was sniffing around and got his
then I went outside calling for Herbert .
<but then> then my dog Eskimo fell and broke the jar .
I was very cross then went outside and <yelled> <yelled for>
I looked <in> into a hole .
but Eskimo <was again peeking around and got his> was peeking
<and> and I got nipped in the nose by a gopher .
but then <the> the hive fell and sent my dog Eskimo yipping for
and <the> I looked <in> <in the tree> in the old
but then an owl pushed me out_of the way .
and my dog Eskimo was still yipping .
<I got> looking for him I got <I got pecked> I got pushed
plus I got pecked by him .
I still was going out yelling for him .
<then I get> and behind that rock I was looking .
<sitting on> I was sitting on top of rock calling for Herbert
and then a deer rose .
<and I> and I got caught on his antlers .
and it took me over to a cliff and dumped me and my dog off .
we both fell into <a pond> a deep pond .
at that xxx .
me and he heard this croaking .
I told my dog to be quiet .
if he didn't no dinner for him tonight no dog chow .
then we looked over the log .
and we saw two frogs .
and then we saw their seven babies .
then <they> I took one .
then I found my frog Herbert and hurried home .

I think that the dog <is> like on the cover is doing nothing
I don't think he's &-um thinking anything particular about the frog
mhm okay .
and remember last time +/.
and the frog is like &-um like planning something like when he was
and before you go on Thomas before you go on I just wanna remind
just like you did last time .

again the boy wasn't suspecting anything .
and neither was the dog since they were asleep .
the frog made his breakout .
and he was thinking what the heck .
I'm sick of being here .
the next morning the boy was so so sad since that frog was <gone>
he was about to go out and look for him .
<so he doesn't> as every page the dog didn't care about
that dog .
<he had the> the boy looked in his boots .
still the same it was on the last page .
and the dog still as on the other pages .
only this time he got his head stuck in the jar .
the boy <was> <was> was <most> getting scared now
now the dog was the same on every single page .
you know what I noticed something .
it looks like he's saying something .
<he was shout> and the boy was shouting Herbert Herbert !

and then dog fell down .
same as on the other pages just like &-um curious .
and the boy <wondered> was just hm: ?

and the dog <was just barking every> was just barking at a bee
you know what ?
