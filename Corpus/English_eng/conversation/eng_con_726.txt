&~www .
okay &-um I was sitting in my bedroom play(ing) playing
it started getting late so <I thought> I went to bed .
in the night the frog must've come out_of its jar because as I woke
I searched for him everywhere .
but I just couldn't find him .
I even called out_of my bedroom window to see if he had jumped
&-um but as I was looking out_of the bedroom window my dog jumped
and he had the glass that <the dog> the frog was in around his
so I jumped out to go get him to make sure he was okay .
I went out to go look for <my dog> my frog with the dog .
&-um I started calling for him .
so but it didn't seem to work .
so I went <to go f(ind)> to look around in the woods for him .
I looked everywhere .
I must've met every other animal apart from the dog .
I searched in the trees .
but he just wasn't there .
and as I was searching through the trees , the an owl popped
and <some bees> a swarm of bees started chasing my dog .
<and he run> so he ran away .
the owl started to attack me .
but as I finally got him to leave <I still> I carried on
I came across a wild sort animal .
and he started running as I was on its head .
and I came to a cliff .
and I fell and the dog came fell as_well .
I landed in a little stream and I could hear something which
so I told <my dog> my puppy to be quiet .
as I looked behind a big log I found a family of frogs .
and I recognized one straight away .
I picked him up , waved goodbye to the rest of the frogs and left
