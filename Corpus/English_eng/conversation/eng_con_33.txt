there was a guy named <what's his name> Bob and the police .
and he went up to the police .
and he discussed with him about this restaurant Big_Something,
he said he used to go to this restaurant about twenty years ago
and he was talking to the police about the good times that him and
they used to eat at this restaurant .
and as he walked away <from the>
I think his name was, was his name Willie .
or the guy's name was Willie .
let me see .
<it was> I don't know the other guy's name that he met on the
it was somebody that he thought that he knew that he hadn't seen in
and he started a conversation with him .
he said I heard you moved out west .
and asked him how was he doing .
and oh_my_god .
asked him how was he doing .
and they talked about the good old days when they ate at this place
and the other guy he the one who was, I think his name is Bob
+" I wish Big_Willy was still open so we
+" and have a dinner there .
and then the fellow left .
but the police, I think, came up .
and said to him that he was under arrest .
that somebody had recognized him .
and called in on him .
<said he> called in on him .
and said that he was somebody <that was I don't know> that was
or somebody who was wanted .
oh, I don't know .
I think the police officer told him to come .
I think it was a woman who reported him .
and he +//.
oh wait a minute .
<he no> he was supposed to have went to that place on that
but yet he misunderstood the message .
and he came the next night .
that that's why he was there .
or was it planned ?
I don't know .
that's it .
I can't remember anything else .
I was raised in an area where people were pretty poor .
my mother was with a man who was not my father .
he was very abusive to my sister .
I won't get into all that .
but it made an impact on my life because I told my mother what he
he was molesting my sister .
my mother slapped me down .
my father told my mother to get rid of the little bastard .
that's the only curse word I'm going to use .
which was true .
I mean, we weren't bastards .
but it's just that what he said .
and my mother react on it .
and she she got rid of us .
< it was> the reason why we had to leave was because it was a
and his only son was burnt up .
we were not playing with matches .
during those days <people used to>
they couldn't afford but one room .
in those days, people had a_lot_of rooming houses because that's
and the oil stove was there .
we were jumping on the bed .
I was four .
my brother was three .
my oldest sister couldn't have been no more than about six years
she left us in the house to go to the playground with my other
and we were jumping on the bed .
and the coal oil stove turned over .
it was between the two beds .
and the baby was burnt up .
so that's why he didn't want us around .
that affected my life a whole lot .
I think the separation from knowing that you had brothers and
and but I was with people who loved me .
who took care of me .
who didn't have any children .
and through my grandmother .
and through her faith as a Christian helped me a whole lot .
and taught me a whole lot .
even <as a> as a child .
she died I think when I was about four or five .
but it was her love for me that got me through a_lot_of things .
but it took me fifty years to come back to the Lord .
I think that when I did that my faith got me through a_lot_of
made me realize that even my father, my real father, didn't have
and as a child I had to go find him .
he never would support us in any kind of way .
my mother worked real hard to take care of us .
it wasn't easy .
but I saw all these things .
and I applied it to my life .
but I always felt that I wasn't raised properly .
I always went after other people's daddies .
and come to find out, other people's daddy loved me more than their
and I didn't realize it until after I got an adult that I was
but I wanted something better for my children .
so what I did by doing days work cleaning .
I found out how other people were living .
and what I wanted for my children .
and I applied it to my life .
I taught my kids things that they needed to go to the kindergarten
so when they went to school they were learners .
that's why they threes and three point nines and four point o@l-s .
and all my kids .
and God has blessed them with intelligence .
but I didn't know I had all these hangups about my past life .
I'm in therapy .
and I'm doing very well .
but and I'm trying to help other people .
I've always wanted to help children .
I don't want anybody to go through <what I had to be> what I
but life can be so difficult .
so complicated .
and a_lot_of things happen to you in your childhood even from the
I saw things, even from the cradle .
and but I do know that you change your life if you want to .
you have to really want to .
and you have to get help for yourself .
I never thought that I needed help for myself until I got help for
and I'm glad that I did .
