all right . 169720_169900
okay . 171630_171780
can you tell me which one of these are symmetrical . 176500_179000
&-um . 181380_181550
symmetrical . 181790_182130
I don't know . 182600_183030

the same . 268940_269080
well these look the same to me as all the triangle . 271160_273670
here's a core square . 273900_274900
right . 275010_275200
yeah . 275910_276030
that's four . 276080_276900
in each corner you can compare each core square . 277530_280060
right now . 296310_296790
copy . 297550_297790
okay . 304070_304210

I just clicked on that . 321320_322300
and it turned . 322320_322910
but you have to click on it before you can do it . 323830_326000
click . 327490_327820
what is it called . 331110_331910

what how are you &-uh designing this one . 391000_393950
this key . 395410_395650
I want &-um all of the triangles in like middle . 395960_400860
have all the triangles in the middle . 402910_404460
here . 404870_405140
yeah . 405930_406070
okay . 406510_406740

what is . 432190_432590
here . 448870_448990
so this is what you just did is your family theory . 449230_451580
right . 451600_451690
just your strips are saying to . 459150_460580
oh okay . 460600_461990

does it save . 524280_524860
does it &-uh keep the screen for . 525210_526660
a minute position . 527200_528690
okay . 529870_530070
can you I want you to tell me which ones are all these symmetrical
yeah . 537330_537430
how could you tell . 540610_541090
they're use your core spray and create something that's totally
what are you thinking to test whether they're symmetrical . 550110_554040
think they are . 555490_556500
no they I think they're are . 557250_558580
okay . 558660_558820
is this this one symmetrical . 558900_560460
how would you tell how . 560840_561620
would you tell . 561640_562020

yes . 562760_562900
yes . 563100_563220
oh well I can't tell like this has two squares . 563630_566670
&-um
