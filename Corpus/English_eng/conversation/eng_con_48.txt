and so she got us interested in fishing .
so we loved to fish too .
we fished just about every day .
we'd go fishing and stuff like that .
but we went to school though .
when we got out from school we had to go to work in the field .
but when we didn't we'd get out our pole .
and we'd go fishing .
but this particular day we got out from school .
went across the field looking for our grandmother .
but she wasn't there .
she wasn't there in the cotton field .
so we had a little dog .
the little dog was named Dusty .
