task three is a role play in which you are the 3901_6168
teacher and we're your students↘ 6157_7741
⌈your task is to teach us a common term or 7762_9853

and we may also ask questions ⁎after you⁎ 24703_26612
⁎have finished⁎↘ 26617_27396
here are four issues to consider as you 27689_29625

can you give a formal definition of this 30754_32882
⁎term⁎→ 32886_33318
can you explain why this term is important 33617_35745
in your field of ⁎study⁎→ 35745_36945
how will you begin your explanation↗ and 37396_39257
how can you be sure↗ that your audience 39250_41031
understands what the term means→ 41037_42829
can you make the definition clearer↗ or 43177_44959
simpler by using examples→ analogies→ or 44974_47374
⁎the blackboard⁎↘ 47379_48190
you will have one minute to prepare→ what 48603_50528
you want to ⁎say⁎↘ 50534_51392
during this time you may use a ⁎scrap piece⁎ 51716_53700

thank you↘ 183975_184631
ok↘ and you can begin 247244_249063
uh hi everyone today I would like to introduce 249532_252012
⁎binary tree→ and this is um (0.4) one of the⁎ 252015_254911
xxx structures in computer science↘ you know 254926_257411
they are- we have many trees ⁎but binary⁎→ 257414_259862
for me is that this tree have ⁎two branch⁎↘ 259858_262690
the left branch→ (1.2) and the right branch↘ 262972_266524
and we can see ⁎from the left tree⁎→ (0.3) 269272_271768
each tree may have ⁎nodes or may not have⁎ 271775_274474
nodes↘ so if xxx missing this xxx t- tree uh 274493_279239
⁎uh in this part (0.3) and uh (0.4) um⁎ 279252_283012
⁎⁇unfree⁇⁎ xxx (0.3) you have to ⁇fill⁇ ⁎out⁎ 283007_285829
(0.3) with uh ⁇fit⁇ (1.3) oh (0.4) excuse me 285837_289911
⌈um 290287_290639
⌊mhm
can I talk something more about that xxx tree↗ 290650_293253
mhm mhm≈ 293263_293850
+≈ ok↘ so→ (0.3) ⁇better⁇ trees don't use any 293854_296835
(0.5) using ⁇codes⁇ with binaries xxx 296843_299856
binary search↘ 299872_301003
⁎um⁎ 302687_303359
so ∆why we talk about binary search∆↗ 307648_309040
because (0.3) if we want to ◉sort◉ from a 309039_311897
binary tree→ (0.7) so we have to talk about 311894_315302
xxx research 315318_316150
⌈eh what do you mean by sort↗ 316609_318406
⌊◉for this◉
uh sort means that you have to arrange the 318900_321460
⁇trees⁇ uh in a (0.5) way that ⁎like⁎ 321470_325123
from xxx that i- is follow one format↘ for 325117_328605
example ⁇the lower⁇→ tree and uh th- ⁇this⁇ 328621_332135
got uh much bigger from the top to the 332142_334947
bottom→ 334947_335576
or is g- going uh smaller from the bottom 335592_339038
to the top↘ 339059_339715
⌈mhm 340120_340488
⌊so that is a kind of sort↘ so while we 340488_343166
are doing the binary tree→ we we we we 343178_345930
can talk about binary search↘ 345938_347687
⁇in⁇ this xxx structure of binary tree→ 348145_350609
and (0.5) from uh we can see from this is 350618_353439
foot of the binary tree (0.3) and if we 353439_356437
uh de- uh decided the tree of this binary 356479_359365
search is that (0.3) the left one→ (0.7) 359380_362740
must be smaller (0.9) than the large 362758_366560
⁎one⁎↘ (1.2) ⁎uh as the right one⁎↘ 366566_369510
sorry is (0.3) ⁎smaller than the right⁎ 371980_373900
⁎one⁎↘ 373898_374373
and the second principle of this tree 375999_378805
is uh (0.7) the xxx tree is uh (0.7) 378805_383013
⁎th- this is the left tree⁎↘ ⁎called left⁎ 383019_385115
⁎tree⁎↘ 385109_385653
⁎left tree is uh and right tree are⁎ 386832_389509
different because the left tree follow 389514_391306
these uh these rules↘ the left ones is→ 391312_394469
xxx by one↘ 394485_395738
so we want to- if we want to do a search→ 395893_398469
for example↘ 398480_399104
this is seven→ (0.3) this is nine→ 399563_401723
is follow the rules↘ 402032_403056
and this is eight↘ 403355_405109
and this is three and six↘ 405487_407546
so this is different so ⁎uh::⁎ w- we want 407903_410719
to follow the rule that's like the one 410715_412337
xxx the right one↘ 412337_413953
so we mo:ve this part from three here→ 414188_417756
and we put eight ◉here◉→ (0.4) then we 417762_420626
make it left xxx ⁎the right one⁎↘ 420631_423714
and for this ⁎part→ (0.4) uh⁎ two 424070_427180
th- this uh this number is two and this 427175_429804
number is five↘ ⁎left one is smaller⁎ 429819_431643
⁎than right one⁎ ↘ 431643_432374
so this is the left tree↘ 432561_434961
for the whole binary tree→≈ 435183_436500
+≈ ⌈um I have a question↘≈ 436497_438027
⌊and
+≈ yea↗≈ 438022_438310
+≈ so how about the eight and six↗ or is 438327_440930
it like (0.3) um three plus eight 440930_443420
comparing with the six↗ or do they not 443412_446143
compare at ⁎all⁎↗ 446146_447239
um (0.4) i- it has two formats↘ first you 447683_450675
have to ⁎decide whether (0.3) it⁎ you have 450676_452921
to ⁎uh:⁎ compare this uh number eight here 452915_456248
with this number six here→ 456243_457907
and ⁎uh for binary sort→ if we want⁎ 458254_461160
⁎to have a ▔full▔ sort of the (0.3) binary⁎ 461158_463489
⁎tree⁎↘ ⁎we have to compare this number⁎→ 463491_466467
for ⁎example uh⁎ we have to compare 466677_468683
with the ⁎bottom⁎↘ ⁎uh⁎ with with with 468684_470892
⁎uh (0.3) with nine and three here⁎↘ 470888_473768
⁎um⁎↘ (0.4) ⁎for uh uh- the second- uh that⁎ 474159_477498
is what I ⁎want to talk about⁎↘ 477489_479201
that is the ⁎top one (0.7) is ⁇to be⁇ the⁎ 479564_482855
⁎smaller one⁎↗ (0.7) ⁎is the smaller one⁎↘ 482853_486538
⁎smallest one⁎↘ 487166_488206
so we only compare like branches within one 489429_493755
node right↗≈ 493733_494731
+≈ yea s- ⁎yes so⁎≈ 494728_495821
+≈ the eight and six won't violate ⌈xxx 495825_498299
⌊y- yea you'll have to first to compare the 498306_500007
⁎nodes betw- uh underneath uh uh under the⁎ 500012_502764
⁎same f- father node↘ it's called f- uh⁎ 502777_505124
⁎father node⁎↘ ⁎like two is the father node⁎ 505133_507053
⁎of the three and eight↘ it has two⁎ 507050_509210
sub⌈nodes 509130_510223
mhm
and (0.3) ⁎uh while we are doing the search⁎ 510219_512950
⁎uh it the left tree makes it⁎ (0.3) 512947_516195
⁎that the f uh left one need to be smaller⁎→ 516198_519035
⁎and the right one needs to be larger⁎→ 519048_520808
⁎and also the bottom one needs to be larger⁎→ 520808_523357
⁎and the top one need to be smaller⁎↘ 523355_524981
mhm 524992_525440
⁎so uh when we are doing the xxx here→ and⁎ 525464_529144
⁎we can compare the seven with nine⁎↘ 529150_532313
⁎this is xxx format but when we compare⁎ 532334_535326
⁎seven with three→ seven is larger than three⁎ 535337_537662
⁎so this is good⁎↘ ⁎this tree's good⁎↘ 537662_539561
⁎but we⁎ (0.3) this is two→ ⁎and this is⁎ 539820_542903
⁎three→ and eight and all this um all this⁎ 542904_546798
two three nodes follow these rules to top xxx 546811_549835
⁎the ⁇smallest one⁇ so this good (0.3) and⁎ 549836_552183
this is one→ so there is one two f- uh 552186_555536
⁎five six so this is uh left tree⁎↘ 555539_558526
so ⁎what about is⁎↗ ⁎what about right⁎ 558760_560675
⁎tree⁎↗ 560675_561160
um a right tree uh follow these rules→ 564628_568111
the (0.4) right one (2.1) is larger than 568502_573899
the left one↘ 573910_574908
and also (2.0) the top (2.6) one (0.9) is 577048_585778
⁎the smallest one⁎↘ 585782_586950
so→ in a right tree→ (0.5) we we still 593061_596021
have these trees and uh (0.4) we have to 596024_599208
⁎follow the rules that the left uh the⁎ 599220_601487
⁎the right one is the better one⁎↘ 601490_603106
⁎so here we put uh⁎ (3.5) oh sorry here 603274_610298
(1.0) um uh uh yea (1.3) 610303_614047
so:: uh s- so here ⁎it's the seven⁎ 614035_617357
with ⁎seven and nine we have to exchange⁎ 617356_619889
⁎their uh (0.6) positions⁎↘ ⁎we have to put⁎ 619897_622985
⁎nine here→ with seven here⁎→ 622983_624929
and also (0.4) h- ⁎three and eight⁎↘ (0.3) 625387_628731
⁎three is smaller than the eight so we have⁎ 628736_631168
⁎to change the places of three and eight⁎→ 631168_633467
and→ (0.4) yea↘ 636386_637735
heres comes ⁎the issue⁎↘ 637964_639788
⁎eight is smaller than uh than the nine⁎↗ 640359_644466
but is larger than the seven→ so we have 644486_646812
to m- ◉move◉ seven to the top↘ 646817_649355

um I'm sorry to ⌈interrupt but um this all 658435_661635
⌊yea→
seems really abstract to me↘ 661639_663575
could you think of like a real world um 663883_666678
application of this binary tree↗ like how do 666688_669883
xxx the industry↗ 669883_671355
ok (0.4) um that's a good question↘ 672179_674669
um for industry part (1.0) ⁎binary tree is⁎ 675126_679142
⁎using to (0.8) is it's one of the search⁎ 679155_683273
