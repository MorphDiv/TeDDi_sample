I used to know them .
right here 's your stopping distances read them I 'll give you till
what that mean twen is it metres or what in metres .
go in feet go in feet it 's better .
which ones that the red or the black .
what 's the black .
mile an hour twenty thinking distance twenty what 's it .

your stopping distance for twenty miles an hour is twenty .
no .
it is and your overall is forty .
well it does n't say that .
twenty twenty forty .
what 's that mean so you what you doing twenty mile an hour you
at twenty feet is you start braking it down .
0 .
and then what 's that mean braking .
a hundred a hundred and forty feet for seventy .
it takes twenty feet .
twenty feet to stop .
it 's a hundred and forty feet .
then overall stopping distance what does that mean then .
that 's forty feet .
what does that mean .
that 's seventy miles an hour .
at forty at forty feet right .
aha .
you start slowing it down right right .
when .
and then when you get to twenty feet right .
aha .
now you start thinking then when you come to the junction and also
so how 'd ya work it out .
at seventy mile it should be your hundred and forty feet .
should n't have .
no you should n't it should be three hundred and fifteen the
how 'd ya work it out Darren you gon na tell us or not .
