in the morning Michael got up .
and he poured his milk .
but it spilled all over .
he got dressed .
and his shoelace broke .
and he was really mad .
he was having a bad morning .
he hadta get his jacket on .
and he hadta fix his shoelace .
he got some tape .
and he tied the shoelace on the broken one .
and he got his backpack .
and he ran for the bus .
but it was gone .
and he was late for school .
the end .
once upon a time there was a family full of aliens .
they had the father ghost the mother ghost the little girl ghost .
and they had a dog .

and I will come to pick you up soon .
and so they spent their whole time <in or &~th> as fun as they

then their daughter came and picked them up .
and then she went to play .
and then they said I'll come and pick you up soon byebye .
