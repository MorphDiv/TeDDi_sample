&=micase_recording_announcement alright so maybe we should get started with culture . 216705_219065

okay so culture is shared ? 379035_383375

politics is all about how we deal with each_other right ? 578685_583945
central to that idea would be what other big P word ? 585485_588805
power . 590005_590485

that's what you've been studying for a semester +... 604275_607695

I don't really understand how that &-uh like I don't think that makes sense as political culture . 779085_782405
why ?
I don't know . 783385_783965
I just don't . 784225_784765
I +//. 785565_785805
like I feel like culture should be like . 786125_788085
what should culture be ? 788805_789485
I don't know . 789865_790485

I don't know what's wrong with me . 796125_800105
so Professor Walton gave you the example of the stop sign right ? 801225_804645
what's the stop sign example ? 804805_805685
xxx .
well &~t tell me what the example was somebody repeat it for me . 808595_811555
it's like you &~jus you just see the shape and then you automatically put your foot on the brake . 812075_818075
why ?
+, <fan dement> .
I think he if I remember correctly if you happen to go through the stop sign you immediately look around to see if anybody saw you &-uh violate a law . 818935_831835
so <what's the> what's the point there ? 833595_834995
alright &~l let's try this . 837165_837865
what does a stop sign mean ? 838325_839245

okay . 854765_855105
do we have some sort of agreement in here about what the stop sign means ? 855385_858325
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
⌈ yes ⌉ .
how do we get that ? 859125_860345

it's in the name . 864725_865385
&=laughs:multiple .
okay what does a red light mean ? 865865_868545
alright that's better . 868925_869865
&=laughs:multiple .
what what does a red traffic light mean ? 871965_873765
it means you should stop .
stop okay what does a red traffic light mean ? 875265_877525
stop .
Adam what does a red traffic light mean yeah okay . 877685_880845
is that better ? 881105_881485
+, mkay .
so that's culture . 881805_885885
so &-uh so we all think it means the same thing ? 888115_892935
okay Brett so what happens if somebody comes from another country and tries to &~d drive on our roads ? 893935_898075
&-uh they might not necessarily understand that the stop sign means stop . 899135_904455
yeah or that a a red traffic light means stop right ? 905215_909955
or that we drive on the right side . 910095_911155
or that we drive on the right side . 911415_912795
is we drive on the right side written all over the place ? 914145_916965

+, ⌈ most ⌉ of us . 921625_922305
yeah ? 923345_924065
Jynx ?
and so it's just like the common beliefs attitudes assumptions about &-um how we view the power works in our nation ? 924625_933705
it's a a yeah it's our assumptions about how things work right ? 934045_937285
+, it's it's our assumptions about how things work it's the beliefs and values that enable us to give the same object or the same experience similar meaning +/. 940445_953525
+, ⌊ mkay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ ?
+, right +/. 954305_954465
+, so you and I come to a a red light (be)cause we live in the same culture and have that same shared experience around what a red light means we both know that it means stop right ? 955265_965465
but it's like it's a never changing thing like always growing like with the stop example ⌊ that's kind ⌋ +/. 966085_971605
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, of more &-um concrete like stop always means stops +/. 971745_974485
+, mhm +/.
+, and I I would say that it for the next hundred years it'll probably always mean stops stop but with American political culture like it's always changing and like during campaigning the way you do it it's always different so . 974485_983845
right .
well there's nothing that says that we have an American political culture that has the same values beliefs and assumptions forever <and ever> and ever right ? 984705_993885
no . 995485_995665
I mean it's still made up of the same things assumptions beliefs values . 995665_1000265
it's like based on the ⌊ xxx ⌋ +/. 1000765_1001545

⌈ what those ⌉ values are can change over time right ? 1002785_1005645
yes ? 1006565_1007745
okay so we understand what political culture is ? 1008065_1011705
we think ? 1012425_1012825
mhm +/.

can anyone tell us what that means ? 1026055_1027595
do I need to ? 1028775_1029235
you can take a stab at it . 1029395_1030855
it's like &-uh through our daily norms and through our life we're told we have to do something this way and therefore we become accustomed to it ⌊ and so ⌋ +/. 1031375_1041075
⌈ so we ⌉ start out as itty_bitty kids ⌊ and ⌋ +/. 1041075_1042855

stop means slow down &=laughs:multiple and if there's no one looking then keep going right ? 1057465_1060865
and red light means go . 1061065_1061945
&=laughs but you know what I mean it's like what you see . 1062785_1065405
mhm +/.
