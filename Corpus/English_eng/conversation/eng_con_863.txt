Laura Johnston , (be)cause she says <she's done> she'll do
&-um she's not very honest with you .
and she's not very reliable .
and she'll talk to you one time , but she won't talk to you another
can you think of anything else she does ?
if there's nobody else to ask out somewhere , she'll ask you .
if like she's asked loads of other people and then she'll ask you
