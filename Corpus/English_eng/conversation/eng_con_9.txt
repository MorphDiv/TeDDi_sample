well, what I gathered from this story .
it's a story about Jimmy_Bob .
and they met at this restaurant .
and then they made, they talked to each other .
they told each other that they were going to come back together at
and so that's what they did .
but the part of the story is that he arrived back again .
and he was at this restaurant .
and a man walked forward to him .
and he says that, well, he said, well I wish the restaurant was
but the restaurant was not .
and they wished they could have dinner .
but then they went on talking .
and then later on, as they were talking, they moved out of the
and then he said I know a place where we can have dinner .
and they went walking a little bit .
then he noticed that as he was moving he was watching him .
and then later on when he got into the light he turned .
and he looked at the man .
and some kind of way he knew that he wasn't Jimmy .
so he said +"/.
+" you're not Jimmy_Bob Bob .
and then he, after he did that, he said the real person told me to
and it was the policeman's friend .
so he had to find someone to pretend that he was .
and then I think he arrested him .
and that was it .
my childhood story is an uncle in my family and my father and my
every Sunday, my Uncle_Sidney would come to visit us .
and Uncle_Sidney had these big hands .
and I used to call him Baloney_Hands because they were so big .
and I was so small .
and how I used to dread for Uncle_Sidney to come visit because
and then when that time when I was small I was allergic to smoke .
and no one in the family really knew that he used to make me sick .
when Uncle, when he used to hug me .
uncle Sidney would hug me .
and kiss me .
and I would be so sick .
and then as I got older, I would tell Mom .
dad would say why you don't like your Uncle_Sidney .
and I says I like Uncle_Sidney, daddy .
but I don't like Uncle_Sidney's big hands .
and you know how the parents would question you .
and then later on when I got a little older, I was able to tell my
but I didn't like Uncle_Sidney because he smoked plus he had big
and that's it .
