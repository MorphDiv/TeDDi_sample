twenty one . 3770_4230
twenty three <twenty two twenty two> twenty two . 5040_7240
but <some people> some people shared . 7710_9390
well no . 10580_10920
everybody shared away . 10970_12520
Brian and Alex teamed down away . 12570_14280
to Nathan my my one &-um I had to share but . 16230_22190
Nathan shared one by himself . 22290_23630
and Teddy then had one . 23700_24910
so they each had one to . 25000_25960
share . 26170_26360
yeah . 26750_26920
because we were using our &-um the course wordss for our quilts . 27500_31800
twenty . 32000_32250
so if we shared twenty or more ways together today that you could
and still every time make a symmetrical two by two . 41650_44880
design . 44930_45200
how many more do you think we'd have to test before we could say .
you can always do it . 48830_49710
we would've to probably test all the core squares in the world . 52830_56280
could we do that . 56620_57290
have to test test all the &-um core squares &-um &-um <in the>
okay . 70030_70270
so we wouldn't have to test all the core squares in the world . 70420_72350
because we weren't thinking about symmetrical core squares . 72370_74470
today . 74490_74630
we were only thinking about asymmetric how would I know when I had
there's there's a_lot_of &-um quilt cut . 86120_90680
there's a_lot_of quilts in the world . 91140_93000
and and a there's even more two by twos than quilts . 94190_99280
and there's more core squares than quilts in the world . 99500_102470
so we would probably have to test their . 103550_106630
we would probably have to go from State to State and actually try .
<and we> and we would've to go like every place we would've to
&-um <we would probably> we would probably have to search from
if I went to every what_if it was possible for me to go to every
how would I know when I had them all . 130430_131710
even if I had visited every single place imaginable . 132160_135510
how would I be sure I had all the core squares . 135990_138000
&-uh is there only a is there a certain number of core . 139170_141910
squares . 142010_142320
no . 142790_142860
there could be people are probably making some right now . 143010_145590
yeah . 146920_147080
people making cook to it now . 147660_149080
they who meet even there maybe &-um maybe &-um but &-um actually if
mhm . 169110_169290
&-um and &-um we &-um already went to all the places still making .
yes . 175230_175320
<you may> you may get a courseware . 175950_178070
but then when you make the let's say &-um let's say you were at
then you went then you were at China they may be done with a quilt
then they may start making another one to different core square . 187720_191340
does every quilt come from a different core square . 191790_193550
no . 194270_194380
no . 194940_195000
some some of square . 195350_197430
so like maybe you'd make a quilt . 199820_201350
Vanessa and I'd make a quilt . 201400_202550
and we might have used the same four square . 202600_204180
have made different . 205550_206500
have made different . 207520_208140
but could we have made them the same . 208690_209730
yes . 210300_210450
so I don't . 216860_217270
know .
do you think anywhere in the world we're gonna find an asymmetric
two Mi Two design . 222400_223140
we may . 224260_224740
why do you think so . 227230_227920
I dunno . 230500_230880
because some people just make come up and they not be symmetrical .
and that's &-um and then &-um whenever and we may have tried all of
&-um and really didn't care what colors and stuff . 251190_254040
and then you tried to get it . 254610_255880
&-um it may be not symmetrical . 256190_258310
and you may &-um find &-um a way that you may try it all the two
and you may not find a a way that you made a symmetrical one .
hmm . 272210_272320
so you think there are four squares out there that are not
that can't no matter how long you think about it or try be turned
none of those were here . 282710_283480
today we tried over twenty different core squares . 283530_285980
and they all made symmetrical two by two . 286150_288070
well there maybe some in all entire . 288090_290690
some people may even making up four squares right now . 296160_299340
make Aqui . 300200_300800
be I think professor La wants to ask something . 301910_305170
did you I . 305930_306390
wonder since since you've decided that there's so <many many
and we can never know if we have (th)em all . 316800_318830
and someone even when we collect (th)em someone else could be
and and they might be in some secret placemaking . 323820_325680
even we'll never know . 326140_326840
could you how would you think about it . 327820_330270
if you use what you've learned about course squares . 331390_333880
how could what would you do . 333950_335280
experiment to see if you could make an asymmetric course square
what would you think about . 348720_349800
suppose you got on the computer and you could make as many core
what would you think about to try to test the items . 357510_360470
what would you do . 365680_366320
you had all the time if it's gonna be your job to test and find out
and ace courseware that couldn't become a symmetric two by two
how are you gonna find it . 382310_383270
how are you gonna test . 386670_387420
more just <exactly like> exactly like what not exactly like
courseware . 397850_398230
what courseware . 398640_399280
this is maybe this is courseware . 400240_402480
but you already found out that this courseware made a symmetric two
so would you wanna test this one . 408130_408960
so this one is . 410870_411950
we already tested that one . 412130_413320
that bowls . 417480_417940
did make a symmetric tube . 418050_419020
find out can start with and always find a way . 429280_436670
how could the computer help you solve that problem . 447870_450030
tons . 453320_453560
the computer would allow you to make <tons and> tons and tons
core squares . 459690_460160
you can make a million . 461520_462300
what would you do after you made the color squares . 465680_467600
Nicole what would you do . 468350_470620
Nicole after you designed the course . 476500_477960
ribs . 478170_478340
Nicole . 479800_480170
why . 490920_491090
it would be hard . 492200_493040
why would it be hard on the computer to see if the . 496440_498380
if I would . 498980_503960
you would see if the course for symmetrical . 505890_507370
mhm . 507560_507690
right . 508190_508350
because we're only gonna think about what kind of core squares . 508700_511010
not ones . 511960_512559
that are not symmetrical after you had a core square made . 512580_515320
and you had thought about it . 515630_516520
and you were sure that it was not symmetrical . 516539_519200
then what would you do . 519860_520510
&-uh another . 521320_523220
another core . 524400_524720
yeah . 525330_525440
I don't think that's helping you think about the whole problem . 527980_530000
was our problem . 531160_531730
just find all the asymmetrical foursquares . 532050_534800
we could no . 534850_535990
what do we wanna find out about those Asymmetrical . 536510_538550
four squares . 539050_539430
if there is a if there is any what other core squares that we had .
we know there's lots_of four squares . 547680_548910
we haven't got . 549010_549420
that's not what we're trying to find out . 549440_550820
what are we trying to find . 551710_552460
out all the . 552520_553230
but maybe . 562120_562320
