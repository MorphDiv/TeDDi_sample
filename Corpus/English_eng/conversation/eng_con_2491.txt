Sarah <heard the> heard the phone ring .
she answered it .
<it was> it was a squeaky voice .
<she she &~an &~sh> it was her friend .
well that's what the person said at least .
she said <hi this is &~mich > hi Sarah this is Michelle .
my family's having a picnic .
would you like to come ?
and she's like why is your voice so squeaky ?
oh my phone isn't working very well .

so <they went out> they told their parents .
and they went outside .
<they didn't they looked around> they looked .
they were walking there .
and suddenly over the bush they saw an alien family and a flying
but it was landed .
someone was waving goodbye from the saucer .
Shane wanted to hide behind the bush and sneak away home .
<but &~m> but Michelle said oh how bad can these aliens be .
they have two arms and just a couple more legs than we do .
a couple more Shane said .
about &-uh lets just say fifty more .
and she's like oh come on Shane .
she grabbed Shane .
and they <went and> went .
the aliens had the squeaky voice .
the same voice she heard that that said this was Michelle,
so Sarah said <where's> where's my friend Michelle .
they pointed to a little girl .
that's not my friend Michelle unless you're in your halloween
well, no no I'm your friend Michelle .
I've been watching you .
all those phone calls you got that I have been talking to you .
those weren't from any of your friend Michelle .
<that was> that wasn't from your friend Michelle that's here
that was from me .
and I'm like I have a friend alien ?
I don't think so .
I haven't even met you before .
<they> Sarah screamed .
the alien put their hand over it .
don't worry .
we won't hurt you .
we come in peace .
and then she said what are you doing here ?
well we hear your family &-uh has some problems .
and she's like no, no problems in a mysterious way .
well said Michelle the alien then how come you're so sad and always
I don't do that Michelle said .
<David starting &~laugh> David started laughing .
<Michelle Sarah &~s said> Sarah told David to be quiet .
she's talking to this alien .
so David was quiet .
<and she's like well that's> and he's like well <that>
Sarah's standing there and she's like yes it is .
you're sad because your aunt might die .
she's like well she might .
but I wasn't crying in the bathroom .
<she's like I'm not gonna> I'm not trying to embarrass you .
it's natural to cry .
and she's like you're an alien .
how do you know anything ?
she's like aliens have feelings too .
suddenly Sarah noticed a little llama llama but dog type animal
said what in the world is that thing that you're holding with a
oh this is my pet <&~gru> Grucchi she said .
Grucchi, what type of animal is that ?
it's a <&~doga> dogape@n .
a dogape@n ?
what's a dogape@n ?
it's a dogape@n .
it's a pet .
Sarah's very confused .
now she was thinking this can't be true .
so she grabbed their head .
but nothing came off except a speck of skin .
Sarah was <&~s> very scared now .
the saucer was gone .
and they put all their luggage down .
&-uh are you moving here she said nervously ?
of_course we are .
we like it down in here on earth .
we wanna <&~marsh> meet some of you earthlings .
but but we're different than you .
we only have two legs .
and we don't have dogapes@n .
we have dogs .
and she's like oh I won't hurt you .
we both have two arms, five fingers <I'm sure> and one head .
I'm sure we'll be fine together .
we could be best friends .
<&~sh> suddenly Sarah said where's my friend Michelle ?
(2.) Michelle she's at her house watching tv .
well that's what she was doing <when I> when I got into the
well I'm leaving .
and she's like don't leave yet .
we wanna come with you .
<&~sh> she's like never .
<David she's like> so David and <&~mich> Sarah <ran off>
they told their parents .
their parents said oh it's probably just some crazy person dressing
but but I tried to grab their head off and only skin came off
come here and I'll show you .
when they got back there the aliens were gone .
they went to every house in the neighborhood .
and finally at Michelle's house there were the aliens .
well Michelle her friend's house .
but Michelle the alien lived there too .
and her family was there .
but she didn't have her brother for David to play with .
she said she <&~r> remembered what she said .
why did I hafta bring David ?
you don't have a brother .
xxx of_course I do Grucchi .
my dogape@n is my brother .
<well I don't> David shouted well I'm never gonna be friends
I'm never gonna be friends with any alien or alien pet .
and they're like but why are you at Michelle's house ?
oh because we knew this this was the only place you would go .
their parents were now with them .
their parents, Michelle, David were all shocked in <&~t>
they couldn't get rid of these aliens .
suddenly the the aliens <took off> took off their skin .
and they were regular people .
in fact they were Michelle's cousins .
Sarah had met them before but just once .
and she's like you're regular people ?
then how come when I tried to <you mean> take off our skin .
these aren't special things .
we got them at the costume store in California where we live .
here up in Ohio they don't have any good costumes .
and what_about that dogape@n thing ?
oh this is just mechanical .
<you> what_about the saucer ?
&-um I work at a space space thing .
then how come the saucer wasn't there anymore ?
it has wheels .
it it didn't seem very clear to Sarah .
but I guess she hadta believe it .
she didn't know if she wanted to believe it .
but she tried .
she went home wondering .
she never really did ever believe in aliens until now at least .
she wondered if there really was such thing as aliens .
and they were really alien in a costume as a human .
that night Sarah couldn't go to sleep .
finally she went to sleep .
but she never forgot that day with the aliens
