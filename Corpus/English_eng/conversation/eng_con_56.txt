this story is about two men that grew up together .
they was good friends .
they was supposed to meet back in twenty years .
Bob and Jimmy .
in the process of meeting one another the were supposed to meet by
I forgets the name of it .
and they was supposed to meet there .
but in the long run when he got there +...
I think it was Jimmy .
Jimmy was waiting on Bob .
but somehow he appeared in a long trench coat .
which I do believe from what I think I comprehend he was the police .
but when the man struck a match he realized that this was his buddy .
then he couldn't arrest him hisself .
so what he did .
he had another plainclothes man to come and arrest him .
but after twenty years he noticed that <the man couldn't>
so that's how he knew what was happening .
when I was about I guess about eight to nine years old .
Bernard a friend of mine which is living today .
very close friend .
another young man by the name of Nerv which is a close friend .
all of us used to play basketball down at the number two boys' club .
at this particular time they was a little bit taller than me .
so they made the team .
and I didn't .
eventually I didn't get angry about it .
because I couldn't be on the basketball team .
but in the process I wound up getting on the team anyway .
when I got on the team I found out that I was better than them .
but I didn't have the proper gear .
at that time we was wearing Chuck_Taylors .
and I was wearing blue tip tennis shoes .
they had Chuck_Taylors .
so I felt bad about that .
so it sort of took me out of the mode of wanting to play .
because I didn't have on Chuck_Taylors .
but my grandmother saw that I got a pair of Chuck_Taylors .
when I got the Chuck_Taylors I didn't play with them .
I played with somebody else .
and as time went on I started working down the Safeway .
I started working at the Safeway carrying orders at the age of ten .
so I started buying my own little stuff at ten years old .
I wasn't making that much money .
but three dollars back then was a_lot_of money .
but tennis shoes didn't cost but +...
Chuck_Taylors didn't cost but eight dollars .
so if I came home with four dollars my grandmother would help me
and right today all of us are grown now .
we're still hanging together .
we're still talking about the Chuck_Taylors and the Polo shirts we
and basically I done been through a_lot in my life .
the stuff I done been through I basically brought a_lot on myself .
and there was a_lot_of times when I should have been home .
and I was outside .
I shouldn't have been outside .
