mkay &-uh so once again thank_you guys very much for taking part
&-uh once again I'm doing concept maps of how people learn . 6140_11256
&-um and <this was kind_of> it's it was kind_of hard to do
that's why I had you write it down . 17906_19281
I'll be going through those later . 19281_20878
&-um so each rule was +... 20878_23235
partners in crime is when the same value is placed . 23235_25737
continuity is when a value one less or one greater is placed . 25737_30266
the eight to two &-um in normal Mao the ace to two you do say
but in this one I took it out . 36809_38657
okay . 38657_39440
that's probably an oversight . 39440_41358
&-uh law of fours is when you play it the person whose turn it is
law of fives is when place &-uh a six correct you place another card
&-um the one time I didn't give Firstname a card because +... 50550_53923
oh ‡ I gave him a card . 53923_54999
but then he didn't place another one so we just moved on with our
sorry if that confused you . 58072_59445
okay . 59445_59921
&-um have a nice day was when we placed a seven (be)cause there's
&-um and then when you're receiving a seven xxx you say thank_you
crazy eights skips the next person . 70899_73034
and that's it . 73034_75854
&-um what was the Firstname easiest rule for you to learn ? 75854_81742
&-uh partners in crime . 81742_83176
and why do you think that is ? 83176_84295
it was the very first one that happened . 84295_87213
mkay . 87213_87888
the &+wa was it like +/? 87888_88960
like you you put one down . 88960_90634
Firstname put one down . 90634_91785
you told him he was wrong . 91785_93737
and then it was a pretty standard rule from there ? 93737_95628
+< yeah . 95428_95806
okay ‡ what was the hardest for you to learn ? 95806_97856
0 . 97856_100256
which ones you could put down without having to have some connection
so the lack of rules ? 105549_107505
yeah ‡ the lack of rules xxx hard . 107505_109854
+< okay ‡ &=laughs . 108005_109854
okay ‡ &-um Firstname what was the easiest for you to learn ? 109854_112517
&-um I think partners in crime and continuity were &+s +//. 112517_118936
I think partners in crime came first and then continuity soon after
but the reasons were similar in that they could happen at any card .
mhm . 125194_125558
so ‡ they happened the most frequently . 125558_127096
so ‡ you had the most like data points to interpret &=ges . 127096_129632
mkay ‡ and what was the hardest for you to learn ? 129632_131577
&-uh law of fives apparently . 131577_133713
&=laughs (be)cause it seemed very often people would put fives and
and it was hard to to like separate those and experiment while
mhm . 141886_142337
+< also sixes I had one six the whole game . 142137_145113
&-um I just didn't pay attention when anyone else put one down . 145113_147592
and yeah and then at the very end you put one down . 147592_149418
and it was like nothing &=ges:arms_wide . 149418_150461
<that was> I think that was the first time I realized . 150461_152318
the first time I put a six down and apparently it was partners in
oh ‡ &=laughs okay . 155085_157142
&-uh yeah ‡ there's no rules for sixes . 157142_160057
&-um +... 160057_160727
is it like you can say partners in crime for sixes ? 160727_164009
oh ‡ no ‡ not the not like a full . 164009_165800
+< okay ‡ just that there's not additional rules . 164600_166454
yeah ‡ exactly . 166254_167514
in regular Mao there is a rule there . 167514_169413
but I took it out . 169413_170365
&=tonugue:clicks &-um there was supposed to be a rule called bowling
I'm sorry . 174637_175320
&-um &=laughs and bowling is &-um when two values add to ten you say
but we didn't get there . 180159_182075
&-um so yeah so thank_you guys for playing xxx . 182075_185544
+< also I was trying to figure out what suits were important for it
doing anything . 190257_190902
yeah ‡ once again in normal Mao you have_to match the suit . 190902_193938
&-uh this one I took it out (be)cause it'd be a_little harder . 193938_196874
&-um final thoughts from Firstname about generally &-um how you
<where'd you> where did things click for you ? 207312_209321
&-um sometimes I try to do just random stuff . 209321_212831
and I think that was helpful (be)cause you're a_lot_of the
mhm . 217186_217594
&-um I I started writing down the areas like halfway here . 217594_221389
and I started to pay a_lot more attention to that because I think
(be)cause like and saying unnecessary speaking was like xxx
I couldn't figure that one out . 229832_231132
but have a nice day after a five was +... 231132_233184
&=laughs . 233184_234414
&=laughs . 234414_236002
okay . 236002_236518
&-um could could you repeat the question ? 236518_239489
I don't remember where I was going with that . 239489_240467
oh ‡ &-eh <it just> it is &-uh final thoughts like what helped
when when were things like +"/. 244936_245947
+" oh ‡ I know this now ! 245947_248394
&-um I like the pace of our game being slow . 248394_253164
I feel like if you play this in a group of people it's much faster .
and I think xxx write this down . 255545_257921
&-um (..) let's see . 257921_263825
laws of fours was pretty easy because there was like a distinct
so ‡ that was like easy to pair those two together . 267862_271148
&-um looking back xxx law of fives place it's the xxx to
&=laughs . 277509_278610
okay . 278610_279158
+< I didn't put that together . 278958_280261
okay ‡ so so ‡ you had a_lot_of errors with that which is what
yep . 284388_284703
but it's an interesting xxx . 284703_287182
+< but yeah . 286682_287494
I_guess I didn't &-uh see the common thread . 287494_290052
mkay . 290052_290488
&-um and Firstname same question &-um what helped you learn the most
I tried to repeat everything that was correct and not repeat
&=laughs . 305851_306401
and so it clicked when there was one where he made three mistakes at
then I got most of the clues . 309970_311338
okay ‡ and that was the three fives in a row „ I think . 311338_313758
+< and +/. 311838_312641
<that was> he he forgot to say thank_you very much and
okay . 319978_321250
and yeah I think that was after a five . 321250_322877
that seems like it . 322877_323719
+< &=laughs . 323568_324434
and then yeah I couldn't learn the cards with the rules because
+< mhm &=nods . 330375_330924
I had „ yeah . 330924_331923
that was interesting . 331923_332727
&-um so ‡ yeah ‡ so ‡ how this worked is in my concept maps there
so there's one_d two_d and three-d as in dimensional . 338562_342470
&-um so ‡ partners in crime and continuity are just one . 342470_345549
you play it . 345549_346066
boom that's the rule . 346066_347659
&-um the hardest then are law of fives and just law of fives &-um
that's like a two step . 358512_359535
&-um the middle tier of difficulty is the sevens for thank_you very
but it's just based on that card . 365877_367511
so ‡ I think actually it goes with what you guys were saying where
cool . 379024_379337
so ‡ thank_you so much for playing again . 379337_384317
