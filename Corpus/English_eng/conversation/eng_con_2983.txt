I'm going to give every partnership one of these . 145_4765
okay . 7305_8985
so what I'm about to do now is just hand you a random equation . 10125_14425
and you have to fill out the rest of the chart . 15865_18065
so you and your partner are going to have to come up with a situation . 18705_23365
actually write out a problem . 24065_25925
make a table graph . 27315_29515
it most importantly I want you to tell me what those variables stand for . 29755_34815
and what the slope and the white intercept actually mean in your problem . 35795_39455
that's gonna be a little bit tricky . 39975_41275
(be)cause .
it seems like kind of a hazy concept . 41475_43295
I'll try to come around and help you with that . 43595_45195
&-um but if the slope is four . 45995_47855
so what does that actually mean in your problem . 49355_52655
where can you see that on the ground . 53115_54475
s it's fifty . 59035_59455
so we have to find what x how many x's it takes . 59855_62975
and y is it takes to make a fifty . 63655_65175
okay . 65735_66035
equation what . 68215_68975
situation . 68975_73155
are we gonna have . 73475_73815
&-um situation situation . 74575_78475
so draw the doctor . 79735_81435
let's do you owe me fifty dollars . 81935_83435
and you gimme fifty . 83535_84575
cents a month a day . 84565_87225
see .
that then how do we get to x . 88825_91945
let's do that . 92205_92585
Jacob owe me . 92965_93585
no . 94065_94265
dude . 94425_94445
describe the situation up . 94545_95305
here .
oh .
is that your name is that . 95945_96645
I missed . 96785_97845
the name but dude . 98025_98725
we have to describe it up here . 98885_99585
all right . 99705_101865
so . 101985_102205
Jacob I . 102605_103125
owe you fifty dollars . 103325_104445
fifty dollars . 104525_105645
and we have to start with the number . 106085_107125
access is being number . 107365_108305
and he . 108645_109805
already . 110325_110445
gave me . 112635_114415
&-um five dollars ten . 115575_117015
fifteen . 117655_119595
make it five . 120175_120955
make make it some five numbers easier . 121135_122735
on Us . 122895_123075
two point five . 123875_124675
two . 125875_125975
point five dollars . 126095_126575
two point five . 127335_128515
dollars .
okay . 129055_129175
and . 129535_129815
every day he give . 130115_133955
fifty cents . 134555_136195
per day three days . 136835_138075
how long would it take . 141065_141965
yeah .
how .
yeah . 142645_142745
how long would it take for . 142885_143845
to pay back . 143845_145545
take to . 146405_150365
give me my full payment . 152585_157805
zero plus y equals so . 163995_168295
the subtract that would be forty seven . 175435_178115
point five . 178435_178755
and then you have to try to figure out what to &-um why was divided by forty seven . 184385_192425
move this over and move this over which should be five divided by four seven . 193405_198545
be nine five . 199065_201405
I think it is two . 202685_204185
and then five ninety five days . 204545_206385
I'm slow paying back people . 207185_210185
okay . 212635_213055
don't forget to define identify the money . 213175_217575
so then x would be how much money I gave you at the beginning . 218095_221375
and y would be . 221675_222375
x . 224055_225075
money I gave . 225875_228015
and then y why would it have to be . 229035_233435
how many days it takes . 233935_234575
yeah . 234615_234735
how many days it takes . 234915_235555
how many . 235575_235895
days it takes graph and then a graph . 236915_242635
how are we gonna draw a graph . 242755_243515
cause we gotta make it really small in_order_to or we could just cheat and just go like fifty up here . 244455_249435
one two . 249855_250655
three four . 251015_251735
five six seven . 252055_253655
and then <this would be> this would be x so . 254375_258575
y with p . 258815_259335
twenty sixty . 261545_264825
okay . 265385_265445
that's all we need . 265785_266265
wait . 266745_266905
so then oh no . 267125_267865
let's see . 268045_268745
eighty . 268885_269145
and . 269465_269525
okay . 269985_272305
so it goes up . 272545_273605
it goes up . 275065_276265
I think you messed up on the graph . 278225_280485
did I . 281045_282165
yeah . 282445_282745
I think you did you got it backwards . 282845_284225
cause this is the y this is the x . 284985_286325
this this is the x . 288875_289675
you have no idea how many days does it . 289895_296235
take it . 296515_296535
takes nine twenty days . 296775_297575
you would actually you would start here . 297835_301815
let's I owe you fifty . 301995_303515
so we'd start here . 303715_304415
let's say we start here . 304515_305195
start right . 305635_306055
write that .
say it's do fifty . 306535_307395
you go fifty cents a day . 307455_308515
oh .
fifty cents a day . 309055_310035
let's . 310255_310475
so I'll be . 310635_311315
oh wait . 312275_312555
no . 312615_312695
I gave you two fifty . 312775_313535
let's pretend that these are tens . 313795_315115
this is up to seventy . 315415_316435
start from down here . 316815_317655
so we gotta get rid of that . 318955_319615
no . 319875_320055
just just ignore that . 320255_321035
we ignore that how . 321155_321855
about we just make a new . 321975_322535
okay . 322595_322935
that's better . 323115_323375
alright . 324415_325035
yeah . 326075_326215
put it by tens . 326275_326835
go to . 327195_332135
ninety .
yeah . 332615_332795
go to ninety . 332855_333195
cause this is the wide . 333255_333915
actually so . 334135_334755
this time would be . 335335_341595
two .
fifty . 341895_343255
just put it by tens too . 344675_345875
ten three and fifteen .
okay . 346355_350575
so .
two fifteen . 352335_352815
be .
like right here . 353095_353395
yeah .
it'd be like right there . 353635_354375
so then so eventually I give you five cents per day . 354615_359195
<fifty cents> fifty cents per day . 359455_360875
sorry .
so this . 361295_362975
wait wait . 363135_363475
we gotta figure out what this is . 363575_364655
this is it means you go . 364775_365615
up like this much a . 365675_366315
day .
yeah . 366655_367075
so I move up . 367375_368555
so this is the days . 368715_369575
right . 369715_369775
these are the days it takes . 369915_370915
I think you can just make like a straight line until . 377925_379925
looks so off . 380425_381025
so then you stop about right . 381465_387485
yeah .
you're okay . 390705_397165
you're at thirty right now . 397305_398085
so you're doing you just made a line . 398105_408005
you know what this will school . 408345_409405
it shows how much you . 409805_410705
paid . 410905_410925
okay . 411105_411285
x would always be x y would be an x y would be the x really . 421685_428965
and this problem . 429225_429665
why would x xb x . 430245_432005
no cause .
then you try to find . 432025_433225
y go .
y cause then y isn't in the form of x . 433825_437365
right .
I think so . 438845_440265
I don't think I was here for the table . 440525_441885
what doesn't matter . 442085_442465
what do . 442585_442665
so so every time it's always plus so . 442845_446365
so . 447645_447925
so you don't you have to start from two fifty . 448105_449305
oh . 449665_449885
this thing . 450525_450845
yes . 451845_451865
so . 452525_453905
and zero days . 454665_455405
you you only get twenty . 455605_456825
so much you start with . 457545_459425
and then yeah . 459685_460025
one day you give three dollars . 460025_461425
three . 462505_462785
three fifty . 463165_463885
four that's . 464305_468505
it unless you wanna make this completely longer . 468645_471445
no . 472845_473085
I'm good . 473225_473485
yeah . 473825_473965
okay . 474805_475665
tell me what's going on . 475845_476525
here Jacob owes me . 476525_477725
dollars . 478385_478625
and he gives me . 479085_480565
and he already gave me two fifty . 480965_481865
and he owes me fifty cents every day . 482025_483305
so we were trying to find how long he'll take him to give me all the money . 484045_486825
so x is the money . 487665_489505
gave me back in the beginning . 489685_490525
and why how many it takes . 490885_492325
so . 493085_493405
we put like &-uh so x would be two fifty . 493845_497965
and then we move that to the other side to it . 498265_500525
so we track it from fifty . 500805_502125
so it be fifty &-um . 502305_503865
forty . 503905_504505
seven cents . 504485_505345
why equals forty seven point . 505885_508045
fifty .
and then we . 508305_509425
divide . 509545_509805
it we divide fifty cents from four forty seven each . 510005_515405
and then we move the decimal which will be five divided by &-um four seventy five . 515745_519905
then we got ninety five . 520065_521045
so we'll take ninety five . 521405_522185
okay . 522485_525265
you're gonna have to slow down like about one third of speed . 525605_529025
you just . 529185_529425
went in here . 529705_530645
he owes you fifty . 531285_532325
dollars . 532325_532905
mhm .
that's what this constant is right here . 533925_535525
okay . 536205_536645
he's already given you two fifty . 537285_539145
so you made my variable disappear instead_of including it in the problem . 539565_546665
so you actually have two constants in your problem . 547865_550065
when I actually have two variables in the problem you see what I'm saying . 551125_556865
so I'm cool with him giving you fifty cents every day . 557985_565225
but this would almost have to be like . 567125_568625
he gave you two dollars and fifty cents every night . 569345_572145
so it's almost like pain . 573025_574025
you do you know what I mean . 574205_574905
so x is one volume and watch another . 575185_576825
right . 577625_577805
you can't . 578045_578305
so this was one . 578305_578945
well yeah that's right now it's gonna x oh I thought we . 579325_582905
so I'm just thinking in this situation you made a variable disappear . 583025_586805
and instead actually using the variable . 587265_588745
so I'm gonna give you guys a blank one . 589505_591025
and you can still keep going with that concept . 591505_596305
and let me look at lemme look at this . 597405_599845
I mean am I reading it wrong or does is that making sense what you saying . 600425_603405
sense .
yeah . 603865_604005
cause we think you're supposed to get rid of that . 604225_607225
see the x is a variable . 607485_609805
it's one x okay . 609925_611745
so if you wanna keep going with this he's already given you or he's given you fifty cents every day . 612385_617885
right you would definitely wanna put the x back in here and be like he's giving two fifty a night two fifty every night . 618385_624785
and you know figuring out how many days it's gonna take you . 624845_629645
that is not going to be an easy task . 629805_632225
I'm going to let you go with that . 632525_633825
okay . 634605_634925
so here's another one . 635125_636205
and ponder it . 637145_637745
I'm gonna come back . 667085_667665
okay
