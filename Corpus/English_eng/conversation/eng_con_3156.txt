okay . 3660_3790
Alex says . 3890_4430
if we flip them we don't wanna see just white . 4450_7270
so we colored them on both sides . 7790_8920
why would we want to flip a four Alex . 9230_11440
well that way we can match another course where it has the same
okay . 22330_22570
so we might want to match another core square . 23280_27200
so we'll be using different kinds of core squares . 28140_30560
are you gonna use different kinds of core squares in your project .
Alex not in this first one . 35690_41360
no . 41560_41730
why are you trying to make four different core squares at your seat
the quilt family booklet or four core squares that are the same . 45760_48960
d four core squares that are the . 50380_52010
same . 52120_52250
yeah . 52520_52730
and why might you wanna flip one of those core squares after you
I thought you said . 65140_65720
the reason why you wanted to color the back is so that if you
why will we need to flip it . 71200_72410
why do you want a course where that's flippable one that can be
why would that matter . 87560_88400
why if you don't wanna see the plain white you can just not flip it
so so why do you want to flip it . 94010_97280
why would you ever wanna flip a core square . 98830_100710
any core square . 101190_101830
yours or Teddy's or Nicole's why is anyone gonna wanna flip their
one one . 110070_111720
okay . 113900_113990
one reason why you could think of that . 114330_115520
you might want to flip a core square . 115570_117310
okay . 117880_118030
what do you think . 118200_118760
&-um the one with triangle at the bottom and what triangle . 120030_126420
no . 128729_128870
I want you to talk about your core squares that you're going to use
family . 132010_132190
look like Brian do you have a note for me . 132320_134230
why are me . 135310_136000
'cause .
so did you miss response . 145470_146200
your mom . 147770_148130
why you . 152440_152560
okay . 153290_153430
and I just need to change that . 153600_154840
you're not absent just . 154860_156240
otherwise . 163790_164080
they would've called her mom and told her . 164100_165520
you weren at school . 165880_166590
right . 166660_166820
and she knows that 'cause you brought her . 167460_168650
sorry for the interruption . 169250_170010
&-um Alex let's get back to what we were thinking about . 170730_173480
you're making how many core squares at your seat for the project
all . 183100_183240
the same all the same . 183320_184380
are you gonna color on just one side of them . 184990_187120
nope . 187720_187820
you're gonna color on both sides . 187840_189380
why does that matter . 190540_191300
when I asked you why it mattered if they were colored on just one
you said . 195540_195860
well when you flip it you don't want it to be just plain white . 196070_199550
right . 200450_200540
why are you need to flip it . 201900_203270
well see if another like a so at the bottom left you might wanna
and well you're only gonna be using your workhorse squares . 231210_233430
why will you want to flip one of your course . 235500_237700
wears . 237960_238150
can you think of any reason why you wanna want to . 238670_240620
let's let some of the other kids share some of their ideas . 242330_244130
and you be thinking about your course wears . 244260_245950
I'm listening to what they &-um what they're thinking to Sarah why
so yesterday we were flipping in Jamaican look like other ones . 253820_259550
because we were in one direction . 259600_260829
we had to turn Jamaica it look like a different . 260880_264240
one what were we turning and flipping yesterday . 264630_266420
one core square . 267890_268450
and we had we flip it see the back of it . 269440_274220
we need to color on it . 274580_275680
so we know if it looks like the other . 275870_277820
one . 277960_278060
okay . 278500_278660
I understand why we need to color on both sides in_case we flip it
why will I need to flip it . 283060_284340
'cause &-um we have to make it one &-um core squares . 285570_293190
that &-um I turned in . 293470_295350
are you gonna have to try to make your core squares look any
no . 300110_300190
but yesterday we were trying to make them and see if they the same
but I'm talking about what we're gonna use (th)em for today . 305420_307420
because yesterday you weren't using you're gonna be using (th)em to
family booklet . 314360_315190
why will it matter that they're colored on both sides . 315380_318630
so you haven't begun to use them yet . 320880_322300
it took us most of yesterday to get these tools ready and to talk
why will you need to flip those two-sided core squares that you
because you would need to make &-um two by two designs . 330990_333630
but you need to make two different two by two designs to make the
&-um just in_case some people aren't remembering what's a two by
I .
think by two design . 342240_342790
take the core squares . 344020_344950
you have to flip over turn to make a &-um to make a design . 345600_349740
and you have to put it together . 350400_352150
and then it will be a two by two . 353100_354200
what do I need to use to make a two by two design core squares at
&-uh four . 361860_362710
okay . 363270_363510
so I'm gonna use four core squares <to make> to make one two by
and do I have to turn (th)em or look (th)em to make a two by two
yeah . 374220_374290
yeah . 374750_374830
turn up also just be a plain old . 375500_378310
&-um also <be like> be like same . 378460_382950
so I couldn't take &-um four core squares and make a two by two
I'm gonna use some of the samples some of you made for me with the
I've got four of them . 398070_399130
I'm not gonna turn them or flip . 401270_402340
do you think I can make a two by two design board . 402920_404540
yes . 404580_404750
who could tell me how to use these to make a two by two design . 404980_407710
I don't wanna turn (th)em or flip (th)em I wanna see if it's
put them on the same . 415660_416390
just do what just . 417390_418040
put (th)em all the same . 418620_419350
way put (th)em all the same way . 419460_420980
how do I put (th)em to make a two by two design . 421900_423710
Nicole I'll put the first one up . 423760_427180
and you tell me what to do . 427300_428380
what would I do with the next one . 428600_429690
you would put it one under it or side to it . 431100_434340
okay . 435180_435340
so I could put it either under it or beside it . 435440_438060
mhm . 438140_438430
so if I put that one under it what do I do with the next one . 439430_441710
I put it &-um the side of the first one . 442930_446920
okay . 449340_449430
and what should I do with the last one . 450020_451190
put it in the second one that you put down . 451660_456290
put it next_to the second one that I put down . 456700_458510
so . 459220_459420
it's big two . 459630_460420
yeah . 461710_461880
they're good . 462000_462340
you got one up there . 462740_463580
you got the same one up there too . 464020_465220
and several others . 466340_467270
right . 467450_467590
five others two by two designs that we made from the same core
&-um did I have to turn it or flip it to make the ones that are on
no . 478180_478350
yes . 478580_478680
<some of them> some of them . 479300_480660
what_about this one . 482090_482460
did I have to turn or flip the core square . 482600_484460
no . 485020_485190
Ellie did I use the same core square each time . 485990_488300
yeah . 491400_491540
how many did I use four four . 491660_494110
and I didn't turn it or I didn't flip it . 494400_495880
you can I can't . 495930_497550
you . 498270_498350
oh <I can> I can make a two by two design . 499550_502630
I . 502800_502870
have a temper board . 502890_503390
if you have like two on . 503820_505230
let's say you had two &-um like black and then two red . 505910_510140
then you then &-um if then if you put another one over there
then there would be a red right here to match the black . 519450_522520
and then &-um if you brought one down &-um you would have one there
and &-um then &-um if you put another one on &-um there would be a
&-um and then there on the bottom of that there would be a &-um
and then on the top there would be &-um &-um &-um that's what I'm
okay . 562870_563110
so Nathan's thinking about a core square two red . 563890_566800
