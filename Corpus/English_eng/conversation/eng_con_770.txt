the next morning when Peter woke , he was quite shocked to find
uhhuh .
him and his dog looked everywhere .
they called out the window (be)cause he'd left the window open all
so he thought it's runaway .
when his dog fell out the window with the jar on his head breaking
but he soon forgave him .
they went outside looking <for their> for the his pet
<they took it> they took their search to the nearby wood where
Peter's dog met some bees .
they didn't seem to agree him much .
Peter by on the other hand met an owl living in the tree with
<Peter found> Peter saw a large rock and thought oh a good
so while while climbing up he saw a branch from a tree and
it wasn't a branch after all .
it was horns on a deer .
when the deer stood up Peter got caught on the horns and was thrown
at that point both of them , Peter and his dog heard a sound coming
they crept up slowly then looked over the top of the log .
there was his frog along with a Missus frog and lots_of baby frogs
Peter thanked them .
