right in the mouth . 1855_2535
in the mouth why ? 2915_4315
structure . 5195_5695
(be)cause of all the structure all the macrophytes there underneath the surface <the chirate> and so on . 6075_11695
so you actually know where to find the fish . 12335_15755
don't forget to put the new people to work . 16815_20755
(0.6) wasn't too bad you're a little low in the water . 27345_29185
&=laughs you're going as fast as the &=laughs xxx . 31985_33005
yeah we actually could take another one if you want . 33385_38805
(0.10) .

oh +/. 66945_66965
+, so she &~compin combined visiting Ann Arbor visiting the school and coming up here all in that trip . 67025_73325
oh so she hadn't visited the U_Of_M yet ? 73645_75185
no . 75325_75645

we have had long conversations though . 79845_82025
a_lot_of &-um talking . 83495_84415
this is easy going compared to those marshes . 84535_86095
&=laughs &=laughs:S1 .

(0.10) .
there's not actually that much Typha in Mismer . 126945_133145
I'm not surprised that Mismer marsh is fairly complete . 133625_137045
yeah it is but I'm just saying I don't think it's as there's not as many nutrients so you don't find the ⌈ Typha xxx ⌉ . 139825_144425
⌊ exactly exactly ⌋ . 144525_145805

there's time . 267145_268925
&-um on the the lab exam if we can use it to look at more process questions . 269305_276585
okay . 276945_277465
in addition . 279345_279985
and what &~th you're not allowed to sell these secrets of the exam okay ? 280485_285765

are you not writing field notes today Jay ? 335105_337065
huh ? 337205_337385
no . 337865_338565
hm .
I got mine on the boat . 340905_343725
they're &~al .
so long as they're contemporary . 345545_347105
they're already written . 347425_348245
so is it okay if I just make a copy of that that map ? 350745_353505
yes &~ex absolutely since we've been here before we don't need an additional sketch map . 353525_357945
but you probably might want to &-um annotate or add to the sketch map with +/. 358425_363665
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ the ⌋ the the additional Scirpus . 363985_365445
+, okay +/.
+, (be)cause we do have more growth here +/. 365925_367305
+, right +/. 367385_367585
+, but the major part for you today will be completing the the the circumstances relating to the weather . 367705_373545
right . 373925_374165
+, &-um <is it> is it the water was twenty two and the air was twenty one is that possible ? 374645_378585
&~s oh absolutely . 378825_379785
&-um at the moment the oh absolutely the air temperature is is is gonna be lower than the water temperature . 380085_385845
because of the thermal capacity of water it's a terrific buffer . 386075_389695
okay +/.
+, so as you get into the fall there'll be +//. 390595_392255
the water temperature will lag behind the air temperature and then in the spring the water temperature sorry the air temperature the air temperature will be lower and the water temperature will be warmer in the spring it'll be the other way round . 392435_403795
+, okay +/.
+, &-uh the temperature of the water will take a long time to get up to the air temperature . 404335_408635

northeast .
and it might be force two . 458825_460505
yeah ? 461045_461405
there are certainly no white caps yet so it's not force three but <there are> there are some larger ripples so it's probably force two +/. 462845_472245

⌊ well ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ where ⌉ would they go ? 1447705_1448765
they'll move further offshore they'll stay in shallow water the depth is going to be the key factor . 1449505_1453465
so they will just move a larger distance away from shore but still in the shallow water . 1453705_1460265
<I've heard> I've heard that there's an association with size and depth somewhere . 1460465_1464145
yes it is rumored . 1464585_1466465
⌊ even here ⌋ . 1466905_1468605
⌈ <isn't that> xxx though ⌉ ? 1468865_1468905
so is like where do they they stay close enough that they could go to protected areas ? 1469285_1474385
or .
well the shallow water is a protection just by virtue of its depth and deeper predators can't move effectively in shallow water . 1474845_1483945
it's also where the wave action is continually bringing up more food because they're detritus feeders or they're eating the interstitial fauna which is churned up . 1485715_1495515
this is why if you go on the beach in Douglas Lake and wriggle your toes the minnows will start feeding around your toes . 1495795_1501575
