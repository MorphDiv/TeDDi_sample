okay . 1725_2005
so, continuing with the documents that we looked at yesterday, I'm just going to pose to you the same question that we started off with . 2105_9785
so, who sank the USS Maine ? 10265_13125
now, we've read the documents . 13225_14485
we've discussed them . 14705_15545
somebody answer that question for me . 15925_17625
who sank the USS Maine ? 17905_19265
S_one .
Spanish . 19405_19745
okay . 20705_20925
tell me where in your documents you're coming to that conclusion . 21125_23885
what evidence do you have to back that up ? 24005_25445
so, S_one says it's the Spanish . 25745_27125
so, tell me where in the document you're getting that . 28595_30575
what document are you looking at ? 30735_31855
document A . 32135_32935
okay, document A . 33035_34075
what about document A leads you to think that it's the Spanish that are at fault ? 34215_37435
it says that the Spanish xxx, they mine under it . 39895_44495
so, they xxx . 44895_44935
okay, so it says that the Spanish +... 45255_49155
hold on, let me find it +... 49435_50175
arrange to have the USS Maine drop anchor over a harbor mine . 50715_55195
that's what you're looking at, right ? 55275_55895
so, S_one says Spain . 56875_58015
all right .
what else ? 58175_59455
somebody ? 59775_60215
you can either add on to what S_one is saying or maybe you have a different idea . 60375_63795
S_two ?
I have a different idea . 64355_65835
okay, go ahead . 66015_66595
tell me what you're thinking . 66735_67155
I think it was an accident . 67375_68375
okay . 69055_69375
why ? 69515_69695
because in the headline it says it was an explosion from the out or the inside . 70175_78875
what document ? 79695_80255
what headline are you looking at ? 80435_81335
for document of what ? 81415_81855
document B . 81935_82695
okay, so S_two's looking at document B and she's saying that the headline is suggesting +... 82845_87465
where are you ? 88685_89085
I'm +...
divers will inspect the ship's hole to find out whether the explosion was from the outside or inside . 89905_94545
that's where we are ? 94705_95545
okay . 95665_96065
so, we have S_one who's saying it's Spain and we have S_two who's saying she thinks it was an accident . 96405_101885
somebody else ? 102405_102965
you can either add on to both of those or you can give me something different . 103085_106125
S_three ?
so, I'm dead on what S_two said . 106605_109465
okay .
I think there's an accident because on document A and B they are saying that they're sending divers in to go investigate it . 109655_120015
okay .
so, it's basically saying that they don't have all the information that they need to confirm that it was Spain . 120935_128775
okay . 129055_129415
so, I'm thinking it was an accident because they don't really know if it was Spain or not . 129715_136035
okay, all right . 136655_137915
I'm going to let someone else talk and I'll come back to something that you said . 139635_142175
okay . 142575_142655
S_four, go ? 142935_143055
the captains of +... 143935_146195
tell me what document you're at ? 146335_147355
B . 147635_148615
okay . 148975_149195
document B . 149315_149835
it says there, captains +... 149955_151875
xxx .
second paragraph, is that where we are ? 154755_157715
he said that he believes that the Spanish had the information for the equipment to blow up the ship . 157875_167535
okay . 168085_168465
so, why would you believe what he's telling you ? 168465_171405
because he knows a great deal about warships . 171905_176585
okay . 176865_177025
so, we have this testimony from a captain who's very knowledgeable about these warships . 177325_183145
okay, what else do we have ? 183745_185405
S_five ?
so, I think it's the Spanish because document B it says +... 189505_199445
actually, it might be document A . 200845_202125
yeah, document A in the second to last sentence of the first paragraph, it says, Spanish officials are protesting that they did not do it . 203545_213045
okay . 213485_213525
so +... 213685_215505
so, that leads me to believe that they're trying to draw us away from what they actually did .
okay .
because if somebody is begging you to tell the nation that, oh, we didn't do it . 220505_230405
that makes me think that, yeah, they did do it . 230925_235465
they just don't want us to believe it . 235685_236985
okay, perhaps . 237285_238325
S_six ?
I think that it was an accident because the document A says that the writing style appealed to emotions . 241085_252305
so, they wanted to get people to think about it with their emotions and document B is more upfront and realistic . 252685_262125
factual ? 262465_262705
factual . 262965_263525
okay, fair . 263785_264645
is there a third possibility ? 265285_267045
some of you guys are saying it's Spain . 268045_269785
some of you guys are saying it's an accident . 270325_272065
is there a third option potentially ? 272605_275325
maybe ? 276045_276325
S_seven ?
I think it's unclear right now because also in document A, the journal is paying people for evidence which means they don't have enough to come to a conclusion right now . 276565_286905
okay . 287265_287385
so, S_seven's saying she doesn't know if she can decide definitively who is at fault here . 287665_293505
she tells us a reason why document A might lead us to that, and that's because of the fifty-thousand dollar reward that they're offering, right ? 294245_301805
we talked yesterday about the fact that if somebody's offering a reward, like if police are offering a reward to find out information for something, in most cases, that means that they don't have any what ? 302045_311905
evidence . 312445_312865
evidence or information, right ? 313085_314345
they need it, so they're willing to pay for it . 314485_316065
building off of what S_seven's talking about and how document A's offering a reward +... 317565_322425
what about document B is suggesting perhaps that it's still unclear, like S_seven was talking about ? 323005_329545
what about document B might suggest that ? 329805_331945
S_eight ?
I'm thinking it's both because if it was a mine and it would make a hole, how would they inspect the hole if it was damaged if it was on the outside ? 336305_346545
but if the hole was on the inside, then they could see the glass marks . 346705_351825
okay, maybe . 352645_354245
somebody else ? 354625_355385
what else do we have ? 356225_357645
S_three ?
so, they were saying that the bunker could overheat which could cause an explosion . 359385_373025
I can't remember where it was . 374125_380025
they were saying one of the sections of the ship could at times overheats to where it could cause an explosion inside the ship . 380325_390065
okay . 390425_390465
so, is this where you're looking ? 391145_392485
in paragraph two, the second sentence, it says, he said that fires would sometimes start in the coal bunkers . 392605_399565
yeah .
okay, but what word does he use in that sentence ? 400125_402645
it's fire . 402905_403145
sometimes . 403485_403965
what ?
sometimes . 404205_405105
sometimes . 405385_405745
so, does he know for sure ? 406325_407905
no . 408625_409345
no, not really . 410445_410725
at least not in the way that he's talking about it . 411065_413185
not the words that he's choosing to use . 413305_415005
S_three ?
xxx .
I do not think that the USS Maine has been destroyed on purpose xxx . 415365_421505
okay . 421825_424345
tell me what paragraph you're in ? 424485_426305
I just want to read the sentence too . 426365_427565
the second paragraph, not the first one . 427725_429485
oh, I see where you're saying . 431125_432525
so it says Captain Sully, who knows a great deal about warships, did not think that the USS Maine had been destroyed on purpose . 432545_439105
again, he doesn't think that it happened but he's not telling us that he knows that's not what happened . 439465_445985
S_five ?
so, about the fire . 446525_455345
okay .
this captain is saying that they would sometimes turn on the coal bunkers but if there was a fire we actually don't know how it started . 456875_466315
it might have been the coal bunkers . 466595_467835
it might have not have been . 468375_469475
so +...
there are other possibilities, right ? 470015_471755
okay . 471875_472095
yeah, and in the argument A, it also says not a single fact of opposition has been produced against +... 472255_479055
so, it's basically saying that nobody has been saying . 482505_485405
oh, no, it was not the Spanish . 486345_490085
okay . 490505_490685
so, S_five jumped back to document A where at the very end it says, not a single fact of opposition has been produced . 490945_497685
so, they pretty much argued throughout that entire document that who was at fault ? 498245_501645
Spanish, Spanish . 502145_502605
Spanish, right ? 503325_503425
that's what they're trying to sell us . 503545_504905
then at the very end they say, well, why wouldn't you believe us because nobody said otherwise . 505025_509705
there's no evidence to support the other side . 509725_511785
okay, good . 512445_513125
here's what I want to do . 513465_514185
stand up for me, push your chairs in and just listen . 514665_518445
bring with you your packet when I call you to move and this is what I want you to do . 519205_524965
I'm going to wait until you guys are all pushed in . 525705_539705
so, I want you to imagine that we are all living in eighteen-ninety-eight and it's two days after the explosion of the USS Maine just occurred . 530705_542985
you're walking down the street of New York and you stop at a newspaper stand . 543665_547045
you have two options and you can only pick one based off the headline . 547745_553805
based off the headline of these documents are you going to buy document A which says that it's Spain's fault or are you going to buy document B that talks about it possibly being an accident ? 554735_570055
you can only pick one . 570595_572355
you must pick one and you can only base your decision off the headline . 573035_577235
are you buying A or are you buying B ? 577975_580535
move, and then I'll ask my next question . 581435_584055
just based off the headline, guys . 585415_590755
A ? 591995_596815
B ? 597015_597455
okay . 598295_598815
now that you've decided what you're buying tell me why you bought it . 599655_603455
just based off the headline, why are you buying what you're buying ? 603895_607095
I'm going to start over here and then I'll go over there . 607215_608995
actually, there's more over here . 609725_610325
I'm going to start over here then I'll come to you guys . 610385_611885
S_nine, why are you buying B ? 612205_613605
it just happened and they're already saying that it's xxx . 613965_618625
okay . 618785_621285
so, you're just not buying the story that A is giving us . 623065_627145
is that what you're telling me ? 627505_628565
okay . 628685_628985
S_three ?
so, I bought it because I feel that had my, I know this one provides more facts . 631505_638425
okay . 639125_639145
and they make me to think about it a little differently than to where I'm jumping to the conclusion about Spain did it because this one, the headline provides a lot of facts, so I would think that the article would provide some facts other than just saying that Spain did it . 639285_657905
okay . 658085_658305
so, document B is factual or we can assume that it's presenting facts . 658385_663385
it's more informational and that's what's drawing you to it rather than document A, it's just kind of pointing a finger . 663905_671045
okay, S_six ? 671925_672745
it seems they know more about document B . 673045_677025
it seems that they think that it could be either . 677225_683345
okay . 684605_684965
so, document B and you're looking at, it says, find out whether the explosion was from the outside or the inside . 685105_691885
so, document B just based off of that headline that S_six just mentioned, it's not picking a side, right ? 692425_700345
based off of that headline, it's saying, well, it could have been the outside or the inside . 700545_704365
we don't really know but let's explore it potentially . 704485_707005
anybody else over here ? 707505_708725
S_eleven .
it says that it's hard to blow up the magazine from the outside . 710985_716345
okay .
what about that's making you want to spend your hard-earned money on this document ? 717345_720325
well, the other documents are saying that Spain blew it up from the outside but I think it would be easier to believe that it was from the inside where it's less protected . 720665_733985
okay, fair . 734545_735905
anybody else ? 736205_736685
yeah, S_three ? 736745_736885
sort of makes me have more an opinion xxx . 738005_739745
okay . 740485_743845
so, document B is giving you the option to decide based off of the headline . 745505_749785
inside or outside ? 750085_750765
we don't know . 750925_751305
let's talk about it . 751465_752305
whereas, document A is pretty much telling us exactly what they think and what we should think if we're to read it . 752665_758665
fair . 758965_759725
just talk to me . 760985_761965
S_twelve ?
she said it has more facts and role finders . 762205_765525
we don't know what the facts are . 765745_767825
we can't know the actual xxx and based on the title this one's a lot more interesting . 768165_773145
okay .
what about it's more interesting ? 774105_775205
it said Spain blew up the ship . 775465_777205
okay . 777665_777865
so, it's pointing a finger right away but this is also could be considered a bit of a more interesting or entertaining read that you might want to spend your money on . 778145_787405
S_five ?
yeah . 787785_788345
my first thing I was going to say was, it's more intriguing . 790205_792985
what is your side ? 794995_795875
it said that it's hard to blow up from the outside but +... 795995_800755
actually, I'm not xxx .
are you sure ? 802255_804775
okay, yeah . 804815_806995
you're right . 807095_807315
anybody else want to add anything before I have you guys return to your seats ? 807615_811235
does anybody else over here want to change your minds or over here want to change your minds ? 811955_816635
switch ? 817175_817615
one more thing before I have you go back to your seats . 818315_820035
if you had to read something, so think +... 821025_825725
it's mustang time, it's silent reading, I have to read something because TCH going to make me do it . 826005_830485
are you more likely to read something that's entertaining to you or are you more likely to read something that's informational that has or will give you knowledge ? 831045_839925
just raise your hand . 840245_841025
are you going to read something that's entertaining ? 841265_843645
is that what you're more likely to read ? 844185_845425
mm-hmm . 846045_846845
okay, put your hands down . 847545_848305
which of you might choose to read something that's going to be informational for you ? 848775_852635
it's going to give you facts . 852775_853655
there's nothing wrong with it . 853755_854715
okay . 855215_855275
well, you see we have fewer hands, right ? 855595_857195
okay, good . 857555_858615
go back to your seats . 858855_859515
keep that in mind . 859575_860115
I got a couple more questions . 860815_861955
all right, so listen . 864215_873695
hold on . 874215_874575
so, let me pose my next question . 874735_875815
so, the next thing I want you guys to consider based off of your choice of newspaper +... 876865_884805
so, how would your choice of newspaper shape your own opinion on what the United States should do about Spain ? 885625_894525
based on the newspaper that you just bought and read, how is that going to shape ? 894905_900765
