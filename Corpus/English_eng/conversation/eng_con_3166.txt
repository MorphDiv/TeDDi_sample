what we're going to do today is find out .
whose island covers the most space, .
and whose island covers the least space .
and I am going to take your guesses in just a second .
that doesn't seem, shh, .
maybe that doesn't seem hard to you .
maybe you already know .
but just like we did in the handprints, .
we want to arrange everyone's in order .
not just, you know, which island is the biggest, .
and which island is the smallest .
but we want to be able to put them in order .
from biggest down to smallest .
and make your best guess, .
about which island you think is the largest, .
meaning it covers the most space .
and, oh, hands down for a minute .
I want you to pick out the one .
you think is the smallest, too .
matt, share with us which island you think .
is going to cover the most space .
it's probably easiest if you come up and point to it .
um, Andy, Mike, and Chad I need you .
to spread yourselves out so .
that you are not anywhere near, hhh .
okay, this is Matt's guess .
for which island covers the most space .
which is your guess, Matt, your guess, Matt, .
for which island covers the least amount of space ?
okay, all right .
some of you will have the same guesses that Matt does .
who has a different set of predictions, .
or a different guess that they are making .
by using their eyes ?
Tim, come up and .
show us which island covers the most space .
I think that one, .
but I think that one covers the least amount of space .
okay, so you have the same largest guess as Matt does .
but you have a different guess .
for which island takes up the least space .
danny, let us know what you're thinking .
come on up and show us .
this one and this one .
okay, so you agree with Matt on the least space, .
but your idea for the most space is this one .
okay .
how are we going to find this out ?
if I just give you each your island shape and say, .
+" Okay, find out how much space it covers .
we can just look at it .
can you tell just by looking at it ?
no, I don't know No, because you don't know .
could we find out for sure which one is .
shhh, you guys .
you got to remember to raise your hands .
because eight voices at once means I just hear .
a lot of voices but I don't really hear any ideas .
thanks .
save your idea, Danny, and listen to my question .
maybe your idea is the answer to my question .
could we just using the shapes the way they are .
on the board find out which island is biggest ?
no .
yeah .
no .
danny says he thinks maybe we could .
what could we do to find out .
which one is biggest, Danny ?
take one that is the biggest and find +...
and put it against that one .
okay, Danny said we could take one .
shhh, hold on a second, Hold on .
your idea and Danny's idea go together .
danny says maybe you can take the one .
we think is biggest and put it over other ones .
to see if it was bigger .
ben's idea to that is what about the bays and stuff ?
what do you mean about the bays and stuff, Ben ?
well like, those little things that come in and .
then like, the, the +...
okay, right here .
I know what the bays and peninsulas are .
how will they make our job tricky ?
a lot of you said maybe you were thinking .
this as one of the biggest ones ?
shhh, if I lay that over say, .
I don't know, where is another one we thought, .
oh, some people thought that this .
was one of the bigger ones, too .
if I lay this over .
that would be hard .
why ?
because the peninsula is way in .
yeah .
the other ones don't go in as far .
oh you mean the bay of this one goes way in ?
no .
see, I can't cover the whole thing, can I ?
does that mean that this one is bigger ?
no .
because .
you can't, you can't do it that way .
can I say that this one covers more space than this one ?
yeah .
does Katy's island take up .
more space than Ryan's island ?
yes .
so the bays and peninsulas do make this .
an interesting challenge for us .
sort of like finding our handprint, .
how much space they covered .
we can do what we do with our hands .
yeah .
we can do the same thing we did with our hands ?
andy, is that what you were thinking ?
yeah, that's what I was thinking .
andy, you think we could do exactly .
with the islands with what we did with our handprints ?
yeah .
what would that be ?
what, what would we do with our islands ?
put them on the graph paper and trace around them .
then we count the squares .
okay .
so if we took our islands, And put them on graph paper .
stephanie .
and traced around them .
and colored in the squares .
the way we were thinking about our handprints, .
could we find out how much space .
everybody's island covers ?
okay ?
do you think we could do the same thing as a handprint ?
like an island shape ?
what's the same about a handprint .
or a shape of a hand and the shape of our islands ?
beck, what do you notice right away that's the same ?
well, um, our hands go like this .
and the islands can go like that, too .
okay, our hands go like this, Becky said, .
and our islands can go like that, too .
let me show you, .
I'm going to use this island shaped as a sample .
this isn't any of yours .
it looks like seal .
it does !
last year, .
last year when my class was thinking about islands, .
this is the shape that I was thinking about .
so, just to show you, remember .
I said I would show you a .
variation on the strategy we used last time, .
a slightly different way to do it ?
thought of by second graders, okay ?
the second graders in Missus Clement's class .
over at Sugar Creek already completed their island unit .
they finished, shhh .
they finished their island unit .
and what one of their projects was the same as ours .
they wanted to find .
the area of the islands that they had made .
xxx .
shhhh .
they used, they used a strategy like this, .
but a strategy that made the counting easier .
remember again after we did Craig's thirteen whole squares, .
we had to go fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen .
and where is twenty ?
I guess I missed a color .
yellow .
yellow ?
no, I did yellow .
anyway, I must have missed a color, .
because this was about twenty square units .
they thought that that might be confusing, .
because your island shape is going to have more parts .
of squares left over probably than your hands did .
and they didn't know if they had that many colors, .
or if they could keep them straight .
so this is what did .
it it's a completely whole square, .
I'm putting an x@l in it .
do you think you'll have more whole squares in .
your island or in your handprint ?
island, I know .
well .
it depends .
it depends .
some people made an island smaller than their hand .
yep .
and some people made, oh !
I forgot to show you something .
this is the kind of graph paper we're going to use .
do you think you're going to have more squares .
in your handprint or more squares in your island ?
island .
why ?
because they're smaller !
we used that kind of .
oops !
oh, that one doesn't really count, .
I didn't finish the X, .
because I was getting ahead of myself .
and that one isn't, either .
ahh Okay .
let's see, let's put a, .
let's put a red dot in those two .
so we remember they're really not whole squares .
all right .
those two will have to do more thinking about .
but let's count how many whole squares I did find .
one two three four five six severn eight .
twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one .
definitely more .
okay, now let me show you .
what, um, the students in Missus Clement's room tried .
alright, so what they did is, .
they decided they would use one color, .
for all the ones that were about half .
and then down there they showed all the ways .
that half of a square could look .
we did this when we talked about sandwiches .
half of a sandwich couldn't look like, I dunno .
are there any other ways half of a sandwich could look ?
yes, um yeah, uh huh .
tom, did you say yes ?
was that your voice Tom, or was that somebody else's ?
kelly, what is another way half of a square could look ?
um, the other diagonal .
the other diagonal ?
okay, so like this ?
is there another way that half of a square could look ?
if you put, um quarter at the bottom left corner, .
and quarter at the, um, upper right corner .
um, wait, I might not have gotten these .
in not quite the right corners you were saying .
but is that what you mean ?
yeah .
is half of that one shaded in ?
yeah, yeah, yup, that's half !
imagine that I made all four of those pieces the same size .
would that be half of a square covered ?
yes .
let me draw that bigger over here to the side .
for those kids who aren't unsure .
this is Craig's idea about covering half of square .
he thinks, the parts I just colored, in purple, .
cover half the square .
is Craig right ?
yup, yes, yes .
well guys, .
I hate to break this news to you, .
but that is all we are going to have time for .
ohhhh .
cuz, you're thinking, and it's fantastic .
and you know what I'll do, what I'll do later .
is give you some copies of, um, blank paper, like this .
the graph paper that we used .
and we'll do some more fractions .
yay !
on my island, .
I'm going to use purple for my sample, to mean half .
any space I see up there .
that looks like about half of square, .
I'm going to color it purple .
like I see one here, that to me, .
looks very close to half of a square .
so I'm going to color it purple .
raise your hand if you think .
I know the lines on this paper are very light, .
but let's see, some people who .
maybe didn't get to share an idea last time .
danny, come up here a take a look .
and see if you see a square that you think .
is about half of covered by my island .
and Rachel, come up and look for one .
and if you see one, I'll color it in purple .
you have to come and look I would say .
if you see a square, that's only part of a square .
shhh, oh, you can put your hands down, .
because I'm not having anyone else come up right now .
these two need to be able to see the island, okay ?
but if you can see from there, be looking .
okay, Rachel says this is pretty darn close .
to half of a square .
okay, you see one ?
okay, and Danny says this is pretty close .
to half of a square .
yeah .
I dunno, I didn't get, .
it doesn't look like I have a lot of halfs this time .
that's all the halfs we're going to look for right now .
cuz I'm going to show you how else this would work .
because, the kids who came up and took a closer look .
and maybe the kids who have superfine eyesight, .
can see those pale blue lines .
from where they're sitting .
are there, aren't there spaces up there .
that aren't really half ?
yeah, yes .
yeah, okay ?
so let's look for some spaces that are maybe one third .
we're not going to do up here what we did for .
aww .
but remember, one thir means that a square would .
be divided into how many equal parts ?
three, three .
thre equal parts .
so, if I saw this much of a square, .
then I saw, about, this much of a square .
then that's all we're going to think about for now .
but think about one third .
and let's see if we have some good spotters, .
who thinks they could come and take a look on the island .
for places that might be about one third of a square .
mike and Jess, why don't you come up .
and take a look and see if you can see something .
for me that's about one third .
meaning, three pieces like that would fill a square .
okay .
this looks like four would that be four ?
let's look for one .
where three pieces like that would fill a square, .
or pretty close .
ok, Jess thinks that's about one third .
and she could pour two more amounts like that in there, .
that would be about one third .
I, I traced it with the fat tip of a marker .
bigger than it was .
it got a little bigger .
I think that looks maybe closer to a +...
closer to a half .
I'll get the purple marker .
mike thinks he's spotted one that's pretty close to half .
so we're going to dig out the purple marker, .
we missed one .
but do you see one that maybe three of three pieces like that, .
that you could pour them into the square ?
okay, good eyes .
let's see .
we'll have two more people .
come up and search for one thirds .
this is the spot that Jess found .
that was about a quarter of square, she said .
who hasn't been up here yet, um, .
katy and Steph, come up .
and see if you can find one, .
a quarter of a square somewhere .
katy, can you get four pieces in there ?
yeah .
yeah ?
okay, shhh, alright .
guys and ladies, can I, .
that's all we're going to do on my sample, .
because I want you to work on your own island .
but, if we used this strategy, like they did, .
one color, .
mike could you sit up please ?
thanks .
one color for all of the whole squares, .
that's the same as we did last time .
and then, they picked some fractions .
that they knew a lot about .
actually, I got to make a picture to go with a quarter .
so you know what it is .
I know, I know what it is .
that's okay Beth .
um, how did they count this when they were done ?
they counted how much, um .
they counted four quarters .
four quarters ?
yeah, to make one .
so, these parts here that we said were about one quarter .
would only count as .
one square .
and then, three one thirdrds to make one square .
you need three .
and then, um, two halfs .
xxx .
yeah .
we're not going to fill in any more than we did .
when I give you your island shape, .
you need to trace it's outline, .
onto a piece of graph paper .
that I'll give you at the same time .
and then, you can use whichever way .
you're most comfortable with .
if you still, if you think you really .
understood it the way we did it with the handprints, .
and you just want to look for parts .
that would make a whole square, you can do it that way .
if you think that this way would be more confusing, .
I mean, if you think it would be more confusing, .
don't do it that way .
but if this made sense to you, .
and you want to it this way, .
if you think it would be easier to count, .
or easier to color in, go ahead .
you don't have to do it this way .
you can use what you learned from doing our handprint, .
and do it that same way if you think that .
makes more sense to you, okay ?
but when you're done, just like with the hands, .
we should have, .
we should know about how many squares .
like Jess says his hand covered about eighteen squares .
rachel's hand covered about seventeen squares .
but Kyle's I remember is, .
cuz you ended up with the smallest hand, right ?
about fourteen squares .
so, at the bottom, I need to have a total from you, .
of about how many squares your island covers, .
so we can arrange them in order .
I was going to ask you, ok ?
alright, so .
I want to know, like, .
why do use these squares .
instead of like using beans, .
or last time we talked about spaghetti, .
or, uh, fingernails .
well, how did you decide to do this ?
well, how we decided to do the squares is, .
we, uh, our hands are similar .
to what we're doing right here .
and so, we thought it would, um .
just like we used the different graph paper .
instead of the same one, .
to see if it would work like .
like our hands did on the bigger ones .
oh, I see, to see whether this kind of graph paper .
would work as well as the other kind of graph paper ?
yeah .
well, could you use beans to measure this ?
I mean, well how come we just, you know, .
we get some bean over there, and pour them in here .
we can't because they're not all the same size .
oh, they're not all the same size .
well, why is that important ?
well, that, .
like our fingernails that we tried on the bigger squares, .
they have to be the same size to, to, uh, to be the same .
because these are all the same exact size .
oh ok, so, if like I have, .
if I have beans and I say, well there are seventy seven of them, .
and then another person uses some beans, .
what number might they come up with ?
uhh, I don't know, .
if they have bigger ones, they might use bigger beans, .
but they might have some smaller ones, .
like they think like they're big ones, .
and just put them all in there .
so you can't really tell what their number would be ?
no .
like with your number ?
yeah .
ok, you're thinking about, we talked about when, .
when, when someone in the class did it both ways, .
with beans, .
the same hand, beans, you got different numbers ?
yeah .
okay, okay, I see .
um, so what do you think about .
the big squares and the little squares, .
now that you've used both ?
well, they, um, help a lot better .
which, which ones help a lot better ?
uh, both of the graph paper .
with squares help a lot better than .
using fingernails or beans or something like that .
uh huh .
cuz they're all the same size, .
and we don't have to worry about .
just picking, keep on picking out the same size of beans .
uh huh, I see .
I mean, Stephanie, how, .
how about like this graph paper, .
and last time's graph paper, .
what do you think about comparing those ?
which did you like better ?
um .
do you think it matters, or ?
I like both of them a lot .
because they help us more work and .
they help us with our hands .
and show how many, um, squares that they take up .
you know, some people, .
I've seen some people use graph paper, .
where each square is .
can I borrow your pencil ?
each square is like this size .
you, that would be a lot of things .
if you put your hand in it .
you mean a lot of things to count ?
yeah .
yeah .
it would take a long time .
it would take a long time to count you think ?
yeah .
you know, you know, and, and some people, .
that's what they do .
they really +...
they use things that size .
they take a long +...
why do you think they do that ?
um, I don't know, but it would, .
if they did use that, .
it would take a very very long time .
probably, if it was, .
if they needed the whole graph paper, .
it would probably take them until tomorrow .
it would take until tomorrow, yeah .
thanks Steph .
oh wow .
