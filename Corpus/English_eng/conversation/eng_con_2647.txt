my and then once I solve for x@l two that's my demand function for x@l two or . 3015_27835
that's your specific choice given this income and price if you wanted it to be a demand function then you wouldn't have plugged in the number twenty four here you would have an N there +/. 39075_68735
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.

+, mhm +/.
+, if you &~c carried around p@l one p@l two M p@l one p@l two . 86135_93495
is it better to do it that way ?
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ in ⌋ general ?
mhm +/.
+, &-um probably .
because unless you're asked for the specific bundle you're gonna hafta rework your math and stick in a new set of numbers . 93495_97155
okay so this gives me the specific (0.5) demand for that for x@l two right ? 97155_113055
right .
so that gives you that specific point .
if you're asked anything but what is the specific point you're better off working it general . 168805_170885
okay +/.
+, because ⌈ then ⌉ .
⌊ maybe that's ⌋ where I'm screwing up <I don't know> .
okay so if you don't plug in the numbers +/.
mhm +/.
+, you'll have +//.
this'll be a set of one and it'll be a p@l one and +/. 220785_222625

+, ⌊ a set ⌋ of two that'll be a +/.
+, ⌈ it's gonna be a p@l two ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ a p@l two ⌋ and then you gotta put the notation back in the budget xxx (0.8) but if you cross multiply here you can still make a simple substitution . 225225_244625
(0.12) .
they're just gonna equal each_other so that's gonna be like p@l two x@l two plus p@l two x@l two equals M . 250245_260265
exactly now solve that for x@l two and you'll have a demand function . 260285_271825
(0.10) .
okay now I know where +//.
I think maybe that's where I was screwing up I was &~st trying to put the numbers in and I wasn't getting the demand like . 338345_344285
exactly .
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and now ⌋ if you scratch it out right ?
<(be)cause you> divided by +/.

⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ just ⌋ looks like a mumble jumble it looks the same okay ⌈ so ⌉ .
⌊ this ⌋ will give you a number but not a function .
okay +...
xxx function .
but it's because you stuck in +/. 391525_397065

okay so you know what then I think I'm fine because that's where my big problem was so I'm gonna I might be back tomorrow but +/. 411945_414685
&=laughs okay +/.

⌊ you wanna work ⌋ through another one just in case ? 441925_451365
&=laughs no because I I knew it was something dumb and that's probably what it was . 451365_459865
I really I &~ju really think that's where it was (be)cause I feel like an idiot right now . 459865_464885
&=laughs .
no so if the question says this is the hardest part of this &=laughs:S1 if the question says what's the choice . 499885_505265
stick in the numbers right away you're just computing a set of numbers .
⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 577625_577845
+, ⌊ but ⌋ if the question says you have this price now you have this price what happens ?
what's the difference ?
+, mhm +/.
+, then don't stick in the numbers because you're gonna hafta do it twice see what I mean ? 617525_618025
+, yeah +/.
+, so you're better off getting a general equation and plugging in two different sets of numbers .
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ because then you can always go back ⌋ to the other one . 618025_618185
and this is the Cobb_Douglas demand that I keep talking about . 618245_618605
it's +/. 667345_670945
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ xxx ⌋ times some of the exponents times income ⌈ over price ⌉ . 670965_671005
⌊ so this ⌋ <for this> &~Cobb_Dub for this Cobb_Douglas this is always gonna be like this ? 671005_673025
is that &~wh (0.5) .
and then &~w &~wh what I did in lecture is I took it one step further and I said if this is x@l one to some power C I didn't do it in lecture I did in section x@l one to some power C and x@l two to some power D +/. 713665_718165
mhm +/.
+, then you could work through the algebra again but you'd get something different you'd get C over C plus D times M over p@l two . 774945_804925
+, so +/.
+, but that's worth knowing .
x@l one x@l two xxx so it's gonna be C plus D over . 826075_835415
for &~d demand for x@l one is equal to C over C plus D ⌈ times ⌉ +/.
⌊ then X ⌋ +/.
+, times hold on ⌈ M ⌉ .
⌊ oh ⌋ times times M ⌈ yeah ⌉ .
⌊ over ⌋ p@l one .
over p@l one .
and then x@l two is gonna D over D plus &~s no .
yeah .
yeah D over ⌈ C plus D ⌉ . 835415_835535
⌊ yeah D over ⌋ C plus D times N p@l two .
right +/.
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and then ⌋ if you look here +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, here C is one and D is one so +/.
+, ⌈ so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ there's your ⌋ one half .
okay that makes sense .
but don't use N if it's not Cobb_Douglas . 854685_859805
right .
actually maybe can we go through one that's not &~Cobb_Doug +/. 861065_865665
mhm +/.
+, Cobb_Douglas ?
&-um okay .
number two wasn't Cobb Douglas .
&=recordingrelated_question .
oh okay .
like for the Ambrose ⌈ ones ⌉ .
⌊ mhm ⌋ +...
so this is &~actual &~i it's asking just what you &~wh what we've been doing together demand function +/. 865665_875585
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but it's ⌋ a different utility function . 876685_876945
so that's (0.27) .
so first thing you do draw a picture +...
and you don't know the prices so just make some downward sloping budget ⌈ line ⌉ . 923185_924545
⌊ mkay ⌋ .
this is what I want +/.
+, and the only thing is on +//. 924625_924905
we hafta be a little careful (be)cause we know that this is quasilinear so the indifference curves actually curve but hit the axes . 989585_989925
(0.12) so if you wanna +//.
here let's a +...
this is one thing that it sounds like I'm being ⌈ picky ⌉ +/. 989925_990005
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, but you really hafta be careful about this (be)cause this is subtle things that are gonna matter later . 990125_990445
+, okay +/.
+, so you wanna get more like that . 990485_990525
more curved for the quasilinear . 990525_990645
yeah (be)cause the quasilinear (i)s shifted straight up so you wanna be sure that you you're looking kind_of like that . 993815_1023795
mkay .
so (0.14) so it's just gonna be adds two (0.16) . 1022365_1051825
okay and then you can just solve for X (be)cause there's only one variable in there so you can just solve for that x@l one and you're done . 1051825_1052185
how &~h &~wai how do you just come up with that so fast like +/. 1067365_1077405
⌈ well ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ there's ⌋ a line +/.
+, two is a ⌈ number xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ (be)cause all these x@l ones are already in here ⌋ and I'm trying to +//.
right (be)cause these are our constants .
exactly and there's no x@l two in there .
okay +/.
+, whereas if you look back at your Cobb_Douglas your both equations had two variables and your tangents equation ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 1079665_1079805
⌊ oh okay ⌋ so I can divide this by P one and then square it +/.
exactly .
+, and that equals x@l one now .
+, right +/.
+, and that's my demand for this function for +/.
+, ⌈ mhm and then ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ x@l one and that's ⌋ not as specific .
if you had prices ⌈ you can put (th)em in ⌉ +/.
⌊ then you just ⌋ plug (th)em in +/. 1123305_1131145
+, but notice it doesn't even depend on income .
okay so how would I get x@l two from that though ?
you'd need your budget line .
(0.4) so you can see p@l one x@l one is equal to two p@l two and you can +/.
⌈ oh that okay ⌉ +/. 1131145_1131325
+, ⌊ substitute that into xxx ⌋ which is what this problem asks you to do . 1133105_1133225
okay .
sounds good .
alright I .
so they're all a little bit different . 1142515_1157095
right +/.
+, ⌊ it's ⌋ just a matter of &~lo looking at it and playing around with it to get the x@l one . 1164615_1172335
but the big thing this one it says you always want the same amount of x@l one it doesn't depend on income so you get that income offer curve that we've been talking ⌈ about ⌉ +/. 1172335_1172495
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, but if income falls you're on the boundaries so there's all these little subtle things built into the picture that you want to be sure &-um that you understand so when you get the math you know what you're looking at . 1222815_1234955
+, okay alright +/.
+, that's the other thing that you get this and you say oh I know that because that's quasilinear so it hasta be a constant and there we go . 1260965_1276665
okay .
thank you very much for your time .
I appreciate it .
mhm .
so I will see you tomorrow in class ? 1311445_1311505
tomorrow in class and bright and early (0.6) .
and &~w work with some more of those I mean the ⌈ big thing ⌉ +/.

+, ⌊ before ⌋ you go to the math look at the picture because the math can be really simple +/. 1311505_1311665

the thing is let me +//.
why don't you come over here where you can see the computer Andrew and help me recognize all my GSIs and I'll be in real good shape there's too many in there you know that ? 1401365_1429145
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ people ⌋ start to blend by the end of the semester I'm doing &=laughs:S3 really well though . 1457125_1457365
+, that's alright .
+, &-um (0.4) okay so_that you don't need to know about what we did is run through a bunch of examples at the beginning . 1457365_1458785
this was &-uh the great plains states in nineteen ninety seven . 1459045_1459205
and their &-um in response to demand for labor their wages were going up faster than other parts of the country . 1463745_1493725
and the explanation was that labor force participation rates were already really high and there just weren't more people to work so what does that mean ?
here are some perfectly elastic but relatively inelastic supply compared to the rest of the country and you'd expect their wages to go up more . 1531075_1543795
+, mhm .
+, okay so that was that example . 1567675_1572795
this one was &-um President Clinton was trying to &~i increase the price of beef and here it is if you want a targeted price increase how much does demand need to go up by ? 1572795_1572915
it depends on supply elasticity and you can see supply is relatively even more elastic in this the larger demand shift is needed so that and then I &~s was stressing again that the increase in demand is the distance moving right somehow they wanna go from here to here and say that's the increase in demand . 1572915_1574835
oh okay I see what you're saying . 1618005_1619645
then we went carefully over incidence &-um reminding us what the tax is and we have elastic inelastic and by the time we got done I had put all this stuff up +/. 1619965_1621805
⌈ xxx to see ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so they could ⌋ &~re remember what &-um consumer expenditure is what supplier revenue is what the tax is . 1621945_1626125
yeah xxx .
compare E to e@l prime hi how are you ⌈ be with you in just a minute ⌉ . 1626125_1628165
⌊ hi Professor Gaston okay great ⌋ .
+, compare E to e@l double prime &-um compare e@l prime to e@l double prime for any of the things we'd ask about whether it's expenditure or spiralling tax and then we did the same thing only this was the one extreme case we did &-uh what if we had perfectly inelastic demand ? 1647705_1677685
and I told them they should look at the other three +/. 1701285_1721025
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, extreme cases .
then we did the same thing for supply and reminding them that the same straight upward shift for the tax doesn't look the same here . 1732805_1733805
&-um and again we could compare E to e@l prime E to e@l double prime or e@l prime to e@l double prime . 1733805_1733885
but the one interesting thing we noticed here is that whether the big green rectangular big purple rectangle's bigger is gonna depend on price elasticity of demand not on any characteristics of these supply curves . 1773225_1773305
and I told them they should practice redrawing these because it shouldn't look like muddles of lines they should see things in here . 1773305_1773385
+, yeah ⌊ xxx ⌋ &=laughs +/.
<but if> but if you I mean if you look at what I did with it it's going piece by piece +/.
+, ⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so ⌉ it's not as bad .
okay .
then we went back and reviewed what we had done before with &-um &-uh that we'd seen the idea of relative elasticities so this was our relatively elastic inelastic .
&-uh talking now about the cigarettes and what we did before was compare the green to the pink and green to the green .
but now we're comparing the pink to the green so &-um this was what I wanted to get to . 1843505_1852325
the last fifteen minutes was a big generalization of what we're doing for the rest of the term . 1852365_1864165
and I gave some examples and explained what we're doing but broadly defined well+being as total benefit minus total cost .
&-um then you know what is it for the consumer ?
what is it for the firm ?
but what we do is examine the current situation consider a change and look at the impact and define marginal benefit and marginal cost so for a consumer this would be marginal utility for a firm it would be marginal revenue for government programs it would be marginal benefit . 1878985_1879145
&-um and notice that the change in well+being is just the change in benefit minus the change in cost and then they seemed to be following . 1891985_1921965
then we get to our conclusions ⌊ &-um ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ I know a_lot ⌉ about optimization .
+, yeah .
&=laughs:S3 but they they seemed to be understanding it and I went through you know why would IBM have the Russian &-uh chessmaster duel with the IBM machine that costs them five million dollars . 1943545_1943665
why because they got a hundred million dollars in free publicity .
+, yeah +/.
+, benefits bigger than costs do it .
so and we had already done the FDA analysis so this was this and the one thing that's a little hokey is when they're equal but what I always say is if they're not equal it means we're out_of line and you can improve +/.
+, ⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ and ⌉ this when they're equal if you've had calculus it's a first order condition if you've haven't it's a <sandwich theorem> . 1970965_1980405
but the slopes work so we're going towards that .
(0.4) so this isn't in the book but what I decided after teaching for a couple years this class for a_couple_of years is that we needed a nice general framework at the beginning +/. 1988985_1992585
+, yeah +/.
+, because this works for I mean for anything we talk about if you interpret the benefits and costs +/. 2040505_2058145
+, yeah +/.
+, correctly given the situation &-uh this works .
+, uhuh +/.
+, so what we're gonna see pretty soon is looking at the ratio of the marginal utilities and comparing it to the ratio of the prices of the goods for consumers .
yeah okay +...
alright that makes sense .
and that's that's it for today so we're gonna pick up on on consumer choice and what we'll get to is this &-um conclusion but we won't explain it very well so we won't have indifference curves +/. 2095665_2122585
okay +/.
+, to explain it .
so it's more intuitive than +/.
exactly .
+, rigorous ?
exactly more intuitive .
and a_lot_of the time we'll be just be doing what's in the xxx .
yeah .
very +/.
+, which is not hard to understand .
right .
the class was good they were mostly there and they seemed to be following so . 2156825_2158145
yeah <they seem> they seem to be pretty good all the quizzes that I have <have been> fine so far ⌊ so ⌋ . 2158145_2158565

they actually &-uh we'll we'll have to watch for the exams and see what happens after the first exam . 2158565_2159525

even Fridays we get pretty good attendance .
and today we had people on the floor again .

okay +/.
+, well let me +//.
okay xxx (0.4) xxx okay .
how do you know when this &~i this point is where it goes there ?
well you know when you have quasilinear preferences that the tangency equation will let you solve directly for your optimal amount of x@l one . 4031345_4048245
unless it goes negative and then it's ⌊ xxx ⌋ . 4125205_4125345

okay +/.
+, so +/.
+, this is ⌊ hard ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ here is your optimal amount of x@l one +/.
+, okay +/.
+, and the income corresponding to that if if I mean if that's sixteen and they each cost a dollar it's p@l one x@l one or just sixteen . 4162565_4191785
so why is there no income offer curve ? 4192145_4192425
&~i because it's a typo .
okay that's what was totally confusing me . 4192425_4192545
let's try doing that .
okay thanks .
&=laughs and &-um .

xxx and &~th what is that M over p@l one or something like that ?
mhm +/.
+, okay .
and okay let's go to &-um (0.10) okay what about what if the prices x@l two is greater or &~P o@l p@l two is less than p@l one ?
then you're up here .
well what about for this income offer curve ?
then it would just be only x@l two . 4217465_4219325
⌊ okay ⌋ +/. 4238865_4239005
+, ⌈ xxx ⌉ so it would be that there should really be a ⌊ dot here ⌋ . 4240165_4249545
⌈ dot there ⌉ okay .
and then (0.4) and so I don't really get that . 4249545_4249585
why don't you demand more of x@l two ? 4249585_4249605

because it's not getting cheaper .
so if you can buy ten units of x@l two .
oh this is with the price of x@l one change .

okay .

okay .
mhm I had &-um a question on an exam many +//.
several years ago and you couldn't answer it in the case of &-um perfect substitutes with a budget line having the same slope exactly the same slope as the indifference curves . 4362005_4362125

+, so then you say what part of +//.
that's our C what part of the change in demand is due to the income and what part's due to the substitution effect ? 4517505_4517905

this is a a hard question .

the key is that they're sophisticated voters . 5217605_5218125

⌈ light dark and then milk ⌉ .

so watch what happens if light goes against dark +/.
okay +/.

+, and Abbey's gonna realize this and vote in a sophisticated way so instead of voting for light on the first round he'll vote for dark .

but we can't know anything concrete here .
Matt then we'll come back to Silvi .
go around the circle .
okay <it was actually> xxx but I was just curious like could you explain the when you have a backward why when you get an inferior good do you get a backward bending angle curve ? 5531695_5555775
I know .
hold on <when you get an inferior> +/. 5572285_5585565
⌈ xxx I it's part of the lecture I was reading over the lecture stuff and I xxx ⌉ +/. 5585565_5585665
+, ⌊ good you good meaning a positively ⌋ sloped demand or a backward bending supply which are you talking ⌈ about ⌉ ? 5585665_5595005
⌊ backward ⌋ bending supply .
okay .
when you have a normal good you could get a backward bending supply .
so what we need look at to begin with is an endowment model or we can't understand that .
so here's the endowment and let's say the consumer's original choice is here .
so what's the consumer doing ? 5632145_5632185
they're gonna sell x@l one but ⌈ x@l two ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ selling x@l one ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so ⌋ let's make the price of good one go up +...
okay and what if the consumer goes to there .
whoops that's not a very good color is it ?
so could I just ask a quick question +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ while we're ⌋ on this one ?
is it true that if the price of a good goes up and they're selling beforehand then no matter what sell afterwards ? 5632255_5649895
correct .
okay +/.
+, &-um because of this stuff is worse .
oh yeah that's right .
okay .
okay .
so what if they go to there ?
(0.4) notice what I've shown is initially the consumer was selling this much stuff after the price increase the consumer sells less . 5649915_5662235
and I can draw indifference curves perfectly consistent if I wanted to for that story .
so the question is how can we understand that this consumer's better off selling still than selling less . 5671885_5672385
and the answer is we have to look at a different color income and substitution effect . 5672385_5672425
so you have to draw a line through the original choice at the new slope .
and what we can clearly see is that cuts the indifference curve so better stuff is here .
so substitution effect goes in the anticipated direction prices up sell more +...
but because this consumer's richer because you're selling something and it goes up selling even the same amount you'd be richer . 5691235_5711715
&-um it's a normal good the consumer wants to consume more as well . 5711715_5713955
mm +/.
+, so income effect says I want more of good X substitution effect says less income effect says more income effect wins +/.
+, ⌊ backward ⌋ bending supply .
okay so which income effect is that ? 5721575_5726615
<like I totally> &=laughs:multiple .
it's the combined income effect .
okay so but one goes up and one goes down . 5726675_5739095
&-um &~w yeah we're only ever looking at the combined income effect . 5749595_5778995
&=laughs .
well &~w how do you get the combined income ?
I mean .
&-uh &~y &~y substitution effect says draw a line through the original choice +/. 5778995_5779575
okay +/.
+, as soon as you have this you've got the divider between the income and substitution effect .
so income effect is . 5831885_5831925
is always okay so the difference between the two is always the rest of this .
yeah the rest of it . 5849385_5861365
so pivot is substitution shift is income .
okay alright +/.
+, and here income is going up because you're selling a good and it's price goes up .
and here the income effect wins in size .
so what does that say about that but this is a a normal good then . 5865325_5865365
correct +/.
+, so is that saying that one of the income effects is outweighing the other one .
+, ⌊ too ⌋ ?
or can you say that ?
&~wh well what first of all what you can say is to get a backward bending supply curve it must be a normal good +/. 5882565_5912545
okay +/.
+, because if it's an inferior good increases in income would drive us over here selling still more +/.
+, mkay +/.
+, so the only way you get this opposite in direction income and substitution effect is if +/.
+, you want to consume more +/.
+, you have a normal good .
&-uh if you're selling the good as price goes up you can choose to sell less but still sell .
what about with perfect complements ?
perfect complements .
okay what would happen ?
one for one ?
yeah +/.
+, one for one l@l shaped indifference curves &-uh consumer is selling so does that picture look good ?
+, yeah +/.
+, good gets more expensive good one the selling good move to here that's my final choice the income substitution effect we don't even have to look at it substitution effect is zero which effect wins ? 5913985_5943965
+, income ?
+, income .
this is B income wins and as a result of the increase in price the consumer initially was selling that much +/. 5979505_5984645
+, selling more +/.
+, now is selling less .
so those always have backward bending supply curves ?
mhm .
xxx substitution effect .
if the substitution effect is zero you will get backward bending supply yes .
okay .
with the income effect there's no &~ba excuse_me with perfect substitutes there's no income effect ? 5984645_5997285
depends .
what's it depend on ?
&=laughs:multiple .
it depends on the price change .
okay +/.
+, if you are if you &~s if if after the price change you're on the same boundary then it's only income effect . 6003905_6033885
but if after the price change you switch boundaries then it's only substitution effect . 6033845_6063285
but it's gonna be on one of the other xxx .
as long as you &~s you're on a boundary yes .
<so that sort of> answers the questions you have right ?
&=laughs okay that can do for Matt .
okay Silvi .
okay +/.
+, she gives me the hard theory questions .
xxx that was about the last one I had &-um &~w +... 6098625_6128605

alright +/.
+, &-um has the utility function Cobb_Douglas and has the endowment twenty forty so endowment is equal to twenty comma forty and utility is equal to x@l one x@l two okay . 6397765_6427265
question says she could sell one to get more of the other she's a net seller for any price above some p@l star and is a net buyer for any price below some p@l star and what is p@l star +..?
so <what are we> what are we trying to find ? 6431075_6460475

&-um okay I was wondering about this point rationing .

⌈ this dashed line ⌉ .
⌊ that line ⌋ is an income offer curve &-um &~th that really doesn't exist because we're not changing the point constraint +/. 6642825_6642885
okay +/.

+, okay +/.
+, and then think about what would happen if income were to go up or down . 6672455_6672515
that's what it would be .
oh okay .
but it's actually this line .
⌈ there's no +//.
okay ⌉ .
⌊ right ⌋ but (be)cause we're never changing the amount of coupons that anyone has . 6672455_6682775
okay +/.
+, so we need this point when the coupon constraints binding that's the best point but the other points along it aren't gonna tell us anything . 6682775_6687155
okay .
okay .
you can skip around (be)cause xxx &=laughs:multiple she got my last one with her other question . 6687155_6702395
xxx I completely don't get that but I don't have any other &=laughs questions . 6702395_6702435
&=laughs you completely don't get what ? 6764615_6764655
that whole graph right there .
⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ it's ⌋ a hard graph I don't . 6781425_6811405
okay what it's showing .
is we've got two constraints .
so I'll do one in black and the other in red . 6802605_6831885
okay ?
and then what we're doing is we're wondering what happens when the red constraint goes up and down . 6831885_6832045
okay . 6832065_6832545
so in terms of like food coupons how would these two constraints . 6832545_6832585
⌈ one's ⌉ <where the> .
⌊ so ⌋ everyone has different cash +/. 6849105_6849145
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ income ⌋ and the same amount of coupons . 6879025_6879045
+, okay .
okay .
+, so if we look at very poor people they'd be consuming here .
and I could draw the what happens when income goes up income offer curve for Cobb_Douglas and it would look like that .
+, okay +/.
+, but the problem is that these points are perfectly attainable as your income goes <up up> up up up +/. 6880385_6910325
+, (un)til you reach that +/.
+, (un)til you reach that .
and +/.
+, ⌈ mm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ then and then you ⌋ can't you don't have more coupons so you can't go out along that line .
+, right okay +/.
+, and we can understand when somebody has a ton of income like their budget line's all the way up here that this is a best choice because they're now tangent to the coupon constraint . 6911885_6941825
+, mm +/.
+, so the parts of the picture <that are> that are easy are there to there and here .
+, okay +/.
+, the hard part is that it goes here as income goes up . 6970165_6970225
and the reason is that there isn't a tangency any more .
&-um if we blow up if I try and blow up part of the picture this is the hard one okay so &~s I wanna get somebody in here .
so if I look at let's say this point on that slope looks different it's minus one third this slope is minus now that's really bad .
&=laughs okay .
let's try this again .
so I wanna have that slope and I wanna have this slope . 6991725_7004025
now what would have happened here is there what would have happened here is there .
so I'm getting right in here and the budget set is now on the red line &-uh black line and everywhere underneath .
and the question is what do I know about indifference curves ?
I know if I drew something here with a slope of minus one that I'd have a tangency . 7004025_7009245
so clearly clearly if I consider this point clearly better stuff is over here . 7009245_7009665
+, mhm +/.
+, and I know if I look at this point I'd have a tangency but it's clearly unattainable .
so moving along the coupon budget line we're getting better off moving this way . 7036925_7066865
&-um this point is unattainable . 7066385_7084025
and if I look at this point we'd have a cut again .
it would cut the &-uh I drew these right it would would cut underneath that line .
but in an unattainable region would also cut the red line but in an unattainable region so the best choice is at the kink of this budget set +/. 7084045_7096365
+, mhm +/.
+, instead of at a tangency .
and that's what's going on when income's going <up up> up up best choices are kinks because the budget set is kinked +/.
+, okay +/.
+, and not a tangency .
okay .
so +/.
what is what +/.
+, so to solve this point you would just set the two equations equal to each_other ? 7115715_7145695
exactly .
oh okay okay .
solve this point you'd have the tangency equation plus the coupon equation . 7145115_7175055
to solve any of these points you'd have a tangency to the red line equation plus the red line equation .
but any of these points are just the intersection of the two budget lines .
mhm so you wouldn't do the slopes ?
wouldn't do the slopes .
do the equations ⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ mhm ⌋ .
so these are all the kinks .
right ?
correct .
+, okay .
but as the budget set's getting bigger so the red line is moving out the kink would move you know it woulda been <here then it would be> here then it would be here and then finally the kink doesn't matter anymore because you have so much income that you're constrained only by the coupon constraint .
okay +/.
+, (0.6) pretty picture ?
&=laughs:multiple (0.10) does that make sense Silvi ? 7217405_7217445
yeah &=laughs:multiple it makes sense I just don't know what I'm doing .
you just have to work the xxx .
okay I have a question I don't have my workbook with me but it was one of the homework problems from the demand section it was where xxx no &~wai &~wai substitution effects .
okay +/.
+, and they would ask you like like there would be a point where you would stop buying x@l one and all of it would go to x@l two all the extra income would go to x@l two +/. 7253835_7276575
+, ⌈ quasilinear ⌉ .
+, ⌊ &~n ⌋ right I didn't understand that . 7281155_7283815
like when it's only dependent on one variable like that wasn't clear to me .
okay so supposing <you have> this old Ambrose utility function .
okay mhm +/.
+, and price will xxx p@l one equals one p@l two equals two .
okay so if I think about the picture first thing I think with Ambrose is indifference curve budget line and the choice should look like that .
right ?
so I should get a unique best choice it should be an interior solution .
+, mhm +/.
+, and if I solve this okay ME one .
oh it's one over okay xxx will be four over radical x@l ?
yeah except it's one half times four so it's two . 7303105_7332865
two oh you're right okay .
and then the ME two is +/.
one +/.
+, one so that falls out &-um and what I do for the tangency equation is set this equal to the price ratio which is just one half . 7332865_7333045

+, and what I can see is the &~a &~a algebra that normally has two variables in here has one variable +/. 7333045_7333085

⌊ <so I can> ⌋ +/.
+, after he buys sixteen he won't buy anymore .

+, okay .
the problem is when his income falls so low that he can't buy sixteen .
so he doesn't buy any x@l two . 7399285_7429265
then he buys only x@l one .
and it moves along here .
okay +/.
+, so that's my income offer curve and this would be sixteen and we better label my axes x@l one and x@l two I could convert that to an angle curve for either one of the goods if I had the space &-um if I were doing x@l one says he spends only money on x@l one (un)til he has +/. 7406365_7436345

okay (0.7) .
it's so easy when you explain it . 7517605_7517645
&=laughs:multiple .
that's the problem with this course I mean &=laughs:multiple you &~lear you don't learn it +//.
that's what I mean about you have to do it +/.

if you put me back in the course I <must've passed it> . 7538895_7538935
&=laughs:multiple other questions ?
Matt +/.
+, can you go over +//.
I didn't understand the book's explanation of Hicks versus Slutsky xxx .
okay .
so what we're talking about is you're consuming something the price changes and what &-um <sorry can I> and what happens . 7551645_7563605
&-um first of all the consumer should be compensated in some way for that price change .
how do we compensate them ?
the idea is we should compensate them to leave real income constant . 7563425_7581305
or purchasing power constant .
so then there's a difference in definition .
Slutsky says give them cash to give them back their original choice .
Hicks says give (th)em cash to give them back their original utility .
so if we were drawing something so this is good one good two &-uh here's a budget line want good one to get cheaper ? 7581305_7590745
yeah ⌈ sure ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ more ⌋ expensive anything ?
okay .
so suppose this is your original choice and this is your new choice clearly better off &-uh how do we compensate ?
Slutsky says at the new prices you should be able to buy your original bundle . 7603425_7620885
so notice the Slutsky compensation puts you on a higher indifference curve . 7620885_7621065
Hicks says at the so this is S for Slutsky .
Slutsky .
Hicks says at the new prices give you back your original utility so I'd be looking for a point on the original indifference curve tangent +... 7621065_7633405
at the new slope .
so Hicks would let you still move towards consuming more good one but only +/.
+, along the indifference curve +/.
+, along the original indifference curve .
so this the &-um here what we're doing is because the price fell we're actually taking money away we're not compensating you for a price increase at all we're taking money away because the price went down and you can see that Hicks is taking more money away leaving you worse off than Slutsky would . 7652785_7655025
if we talk about a price increase it goes the other way so if here's the original choice and here's the new choice &-um Slutsky would give you this much &-um cash and Hicks would recognize would correctly recognize but that can give you many better bundles increasing your utility and we don't wanna increase your &~t utility we wanna leave it the same smaller compensation . 7692365_7714605
so Slutsky always lets you get to a higher indifference curve because you're not pegged on the original indifference curve you're pegged on the original bundle but you may not choose that same bundle once the price ratio changes . 7736325_7765745
(0.4) ⌈ good ⌉ ?
⌊ <so it's the> ⌋ yeah . 7783925_7783965
but what if the price goes down or the price goes up for good one then Slutsky's taking away more money ?
so price +//.
this is what I did here so price went up for good one +/. 7788645_7798805
okay +/. 7805645_7805725
+, which means give money back +/.
+, the the okay +/. 7808185_7811105
+, so Slutsky gives you enough money to buy what you bought before so the red is Slutsky again . 7837465_7838165
which gives you higher ⌈ utility ⌉ .
⌊ but what if ⌋ the price went up for x@l one though ? 7887505_7917445
that's what I did here .
oh that is up okay +/. 7917445_7917485
+, yeah (be)cause the budget set just ⌈ shrank ⌉ . 7917825_7917885
⌊ oh okay ⌋ I see okay .
it's steeper .
yeah got steeper .
it but Hicks would only allow you to get your original utility back so you'd be getting less cash . 7938765_7947285
okay +/.
+, but here this was the one we did in class this was different (be)cause that +//. 7947285_7947325
we let price fall and they both compensate differently but here they're taking away money so Hicks is actually taking away more +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ money ⌋ because of your good fortune with the price getting cheaper .
but in both cases Slutsky's letting you be better off than the Hicks +/. 7950685_7980665

+, alright .

⌈ two seventy one ⌉ is is the actually the accounting case two seventy one is a much more difficult course because then <four seventy one> four seventy one is I'd like to learn some accounting but don't kill me (be)cause I'm not going to the BSchool . 8204845_8204885
(0.6) &=laughs:multiple but some people like accounting some people take two seventy one and just really enjoy it . 8248265_8277845
&=laughs .
is there any way you could like go over Edward's boxes xxx . 8277885_8278245
Edward's boxes what about them ?
I don't know I've just +/.
+, I've tried doing the homework it's a_lot more difficult .
⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ well part of the ⌉ problem is that we're not gonna assign the whole homework we're gonna assign the first part of a_lot_of the problems +/. 8281325_8283345
oh +/.
+, because the Edward's box itself is pretty straightforward but there's a week's worth of material in this homework .
okay wait so +/. 8288825_8296845
+, ⌈ it's just ⌉ this one through five those questions ?
&-um these questions &~o one through five plus the other four in the workbook . 8296925_8297265
are for two days .
okay but what's due tomorrow ?
&=laughs:multiple .
what's due tomorrow .
I'll announce it when I go in there .
question one .
in this assignment .
okay +/.
+, two A through D four A through C and then in the workbook one A and B two and six . 8297265_8297745
one A and B two and six ?
yeah +/.
+, that's chapter twenty nine right ? 8309625_8309725
correct .
yep +...
okay .
actually emailed me .
oh okay I we just decided what this was gonna be .
I hadta look at it .
&-um but the &~Edw so what about the Edward's ?
I don't know I don't even xxx the question .
the first problem I was already like getting lost on it xxx . 8313805_8320405
so the big thing about the Edward box is hi come on in xxx +/.
hi +/.
+, we've got ⌊ two ⌋ +/. 8370405_8370425
+, ⌈ <you want a chair> ⌉ ?
+, you can share a chair . 8370425_8370465
okay I'll share .
we can take the box off that one if you want to work ⌊ around the mic ⌋ .
⌈ xxx ⌉ share <a chair> .
okay so we got this box .
and what it's representing is the total amount of good one in the economy .
going this way .
and the total amount of good two in the economy going up .
and what we're gonna do with it is we're gonna say we have two people both with endowments .
so we'll put them at some point here .
uhuh +/.
+, and the beauty of the box is that one point now represents four things . 8398505_8428445
so person A we could say is here and then this looks just like chapter nine . 8428445_8428485
we've got an endowment we've got a budget line we've got preferences .
okay but so how do you represent different marginal rates of ⌊ substitution ⌋ ?
⌈ so ⌉ marginal rate of substitution would be the slope of the indifference curve through any point so if it's three I could make it three .
okay what if they both what if there're two people that have different ones then ? 8481405_8511385
okay .
then the other person +//.
this is how I do this .
turn your paper upside down .
okay +/.
+, the other person now is here +/.
+, right +/.
+, with this much stuff and that much stuff has a budget line going through there and we want the indifference curve to be flatter ? 8553055_8583035
+, sure +/.
+, flatter I just did it .
+, mm +/.
+, so indifference curves cross person B is better off going that way person A was better off going ⌊ that way ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ xxx trade ⌉ +/.
+, so they're gonna voluntarily go to some in between point like that . 8582995_8608815
okay is there like some inequality that you could write out that would show how they would trade ?
I don't know it's so +//.
like the first question &=laughs .
to know exactly where'd they go ?
you'd need to have utility functions .
the first question is just a really vague &-um draw a picture where what direction would they go ? 8610315_8612335
oh and would it be true for better okay it &~does it doesn't have you say it .
you can't answer numerically +/.
⌊ okay that's fine ⌋ .
+, ⌈ where they'd end up ⌉ .
to answer numerically where they'd end up you'd need to have prices and and the tough part of this chapter is given utility functions we're gonna be able to figure out prices where what one wants to buy the other wants to sell exactly that so we're gonna actually get to the equilibrium . 8637545_8667525
+, okay +/.
+, and that is the most challenging thing we're gonna do before the exam but we're doing it Wednesday Thursday exam isn't until the following +/. 8684325_8714305
+, Tuesday +/.
+, so you've got lots_of time to work on it .
&=laughs:multiple .
&-um yeah I have &~qu one question +/.
okay +/.
+, about the indifferent variant .
+, what page ?
it's on this &-uh +/. 8714265_8724405
+, forty two .
okay here it was just saying like okay &~s mm +...
I was going to my instinct was to go like that . 8724405_8731725
but that's not point B .
to find x@l one was inferior .
to find if x@l one was inferior +/. 8731725_8731785
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so you ⌉ want to go from from we don't have enough lines here to look at it +/. 8731785_8731905
+, ⌊ no &~y ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ dashed line okay .
so what you wanna do new price line through +/. 8731905_8733825
+, mhm +/.
+, and then you wanna go from point B to point +/. 8740085_8740145

+, ⌈ C to see ⌉ if it is +/. 8740165_8740225
+, ⌊ inferior right okay so how ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ inferior or normal .
because ⌉ that's the shift .
so if it was a price decrease this was a price increase right ? 8762125_8762165
correct +/.
+, then &-um I know from point B you draw up (be)cause the new line would be above it +/.
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so ⌉ for this one is it do you go down and like that ?
so if you want to look at what happens with income exactly +/. 8781465_8810885
mhm +/.
+, you draw it from point B that way and that way +/. 8810925_8811125
+, okay +/.
+, and C is a smaller amount of x@l one and a smaller amount of x@l two ? 8811125_8811445
+, mhm +/.
+, in response to a cut +/.
+, ⌊ <in X> mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ in income ⌉ .
so they're both normal (be)cause income goes down +/.
+, ⌊ right okay ⌋ .
+, ⌈ and the xxx for ⌉ both of them goes down .
okay .
but then here it was saying something like when good one I I thought that this was going with this graph but I guess not .
so that one the good got more expensive you consume less that's the ⌊ normal ⌋ . 8819965_8849945
⌈ normal good ⌉ yeah +/.
good .

⌈ so that &-uh ⌉ that's not that picture . 8871745_8901725
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/. 8901305_8902585
+, ⌈ I don't ⌉ like that picture as a matter of fact that picture may not be there +... 8903365_8931285
I think that picture's not there .
+, okay +/.
+, I think that's the problem . 8939785_8940265
but we could look at what happens +/.
+, okay +/.
+, we could get even more paper &=recordingrelated_conversation .
okay so what happens ?
price goes up .
mhm +/.
+, and the &~or original choice is there .
+, mhm +/.
+, and what +//. 8967365_8967805
oh that's a bad graph for that . 8967845_8967905
let's +//.
the original choice is there .
+, okay &=laughs +/.
+, and what I want is a graph that gives me the final choice +/.
+, okay +/.
+, here .
+, okay mhm +/.
+, because what I want is for the price to go up and the consumer to want more .
the only way I'm gonna do this +...
income substitution effect +...
substitution effect I know is gonna move this way .
+, mkay +/.
+, to a point like B .
the only way I'm gonna get a given good is if the good is inferior so notice what happens here income goes down the consumer +/. 8971795_9001735
+, ⌊ right more ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ wants ⌉ ⌊ more ⌋ and on top of that it is so inferior substitution effect income effect that the income effect wins .
+, oh okay +/.
+, so this is very similar to what we did about forty five minutes ago only &=laughs this is how you get a demand curve that slopes up which is very bizarre <that it> gets more +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, expensive and in response to that you want more of it . 9012055_9012095
and it's basically it's gotta be something you don't want .
+, mhm +/.
+, but you're buying it because it's +/.
+, ⌈ cheap ⌉ .
+, ⌊ cheap ⌋ .
and you're you're poorer as it gets more expensive .
so it's a I mean things that are normally thought of as given would be like kerosene for heating or +/.
+, ⌈ baloney ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ baloney ⌋ &=laughs:multiple or things that if you think about it what as they if you're eating baloney and then it gets cheaper you might actually eat less (be)cause you've got more money freed up to eat something you'd like better .
so that would be a given good . 9019965_9049365
yes +/.
+, but if you bought the price went down and you bought so wait I just don't understand the difference between inferior and given . 9049465_9049945
a given good must be inferior .
okay +/.
right +/.
+, but +/.
+, ⌈ it's just way more ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ when is +//.
when ⌋ is an inferior good not given ?
if the &~i income effect ends up smaller in size than the substitution effect . 9051145_9051205
the opposite direction xxx .
yeah still the opposite direction but point C would be increasing .
someone else told me this trick where you know if you draw the line straight down over here if like this part of the graph it's like between here and here it's normal between through here it's inferior . 9052585_9070125
so if you draw a line through A and compare A to C +/. 9070125_9075865
okay +/.
+, since C is &~o on the right side +/. 9077945_9077985
+, right okay +/.
+, this is a given good .
if C were on the other side it would be a &-um ordinary good . 9089965_9119305
+, normal +/.
+, ordinary (be)cause we're looking at given +/. 9119405_9119945
+, ⌈ it could be <inferior or normal> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ or ordinary ⌋ .
if +/.
+, ⌈ oh okay okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ we want to see if it's ⌋ normal or inferior you have to draw a line through B and compare B to C .
+, okay okay +/.
+, so here income's falling you want more if C's to the right we know when income falls that's inferior if C had been to the left it would be +/. 9122745_9152685
+, ⌈ normal .
okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ normal .
so ⌋ normal must be ordinary because if it's over here it's also over here compared to A . 9155205_9185185
+, right okay +/.
+, but to get over here to this side of A it must be that it's also that side of C .
+, okay +/.
+, so that helps you see .
so on this side you've got normal and ordinary . 9208745_9212685
⌈ on this side ⌉ .
⌊ so normal ⌋ must be ordinary +/.
ordinary doesn't hafta be normal +/.
+, &~o ordinary +/.
+, ⌈ and normal or normal ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and inferior ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ no ordinary ⌉ ordinary yeah could be inferior exactly . 9212685_9212725
so in here right in here you have the case between these two lines that Silvi was just talking about +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, where it's &-um ordinary but inferior . 9231975_9236955
+, oh +/.
+, so if it's anywhere in here +/.

that's a good drawing xxx .

<yeah okay> .
(be)cause one is describing the income and the other is describing the price +... 9268955_9298935
