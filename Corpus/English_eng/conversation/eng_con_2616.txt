&-um .
can we drop it off at the xxx center ?
<the history department> xxx ?
I would not do that .
particularly at that time of year .
(be)cause the mail service is .
(be)cause I don't know where University Towers is .
&-uh the University Towers is the biggest building on South University Avenue .
I guess I would have to know where South University is then right ?
&=laughs .
it's by ⌊ Ulrich's ⌋ .
⌈ South ⌉ University starts at the Michigan Union and goes heads east from there .

⌈ and the ⌉ history department's on the second floor .
and you can get into the building until five o'clock but I'd like to have them by four that's why I said four o'clock so none of you have problems getting in .
&-um ⌊ this ⌋ .
⌈ if ⌉ they're done early can they just go &~the ⌊ is that where you want (th)em also or ⌋ .
⌈ yeah put them in there that's ⌉ fine .
alright +/.
+, okay good .
+, I and I don't mind if you have discussions with others in the class regarding the work at hand but your writing must absolutely be your own individual work .
&-uh quotations should be footnoted and arguments from sources from Fred should be cited by source and the page .
&-um or if you say if you're restating something or using some points that I made in the lecture you could say &-um lecture Carter's &~lec from Carter's lecture <if you> if you know the date that would be fine .
to add that .
and I'd like to see some detail &-uh in the specific detail in in the essays to anchor and support your discussion .
&-um &~c because this is a take home exam I'll expect that your writing is is sound will be sound so do review your work carefully &~co correct your work and revise and check it &-um again before producing your final essays .
&-uh so there're then two &~s sets here two pairs and so you choose one from roman numeral one and one from &~numer roman numeral two .
and I'm real concerned I &~d I did a_lot_of thinking about this spent a_lot_of time thinking about it and I do not want you to say well I like A and B of number one so I'm just gonna do that then I'm just gonna +//.
you know I +//.
it doesn't seem like I'm a hard and fast kind of person but on this one I really want you to choose one I absolutely &~re require you to choose from roman numeral one and one from roman numeral two and not do two from <the same> &-uh the same one .
&-uh indeed I think you'll &-um see how in roman numeral one the two different +//.
&-uh the choices have a kind of conversation with each_other so it wouldn't make sense to as a an exam to to have you write on both things .
so Djeliba and Mabo did after all meet again in this one but just &-uh those of you who are so fed up with that don't want to &~s see anymore of that can just skip past that and do something else .
so A is &{l=READING we have read histories of two African kingdoms or empires the Mali Empire and the Zulu Empire both histories are at least in part based on oral tradition and both deal with the foundation of new and powerful states in Africa .
&}l=READING I want you to compare these two treatments in terms of the question of the ethics of domination .
and then B is &{l=READING Djeliba comes to meet Mabo a third time and this time Mabo is a graduate student in history .
&}l=READING you could say at the University of Dakar which has a distinguished graduate program in African history &{l=READING he reads aloud to Djeliba the entirety of the Mofolo book .
&}l=READING because we assume that Djeliba is not a reader himself so versed in oral tradition that he would want to read hear this book or comes to grips with it &-uh as an oral reading .
&{l=READING the two discuss whether the constitution of &~powerf powerful centralized states in Africa is after all something that should be celebrated .
&}l=READING there's certainly with the Sunjata &-uh epic &-uh as presented by Niane .
it is a celebration of &-um the foundation of a kingdom or empire .
whereas &-uh for us and probably for Mabo the Mofolo book &-uh raises questions about what is there to be celebrated about the establishment of a powerful kingdom or a powerful state .
so I'd like you to construct a conversation between Djeliba and Mabo on this issue .
&{l=READING as they define some of the positive and &~neg negative features of the &~Ma Mali and Zulu states and as they consider some of the issues surrounding the relationships of some African states with the unfolding Atlantic slave trade &}l=READING another arena in which we have &-uh come across questions about &-uh the way in which African states participate in the slave trade and and how &-uh what to what extent this was a positive or negative feature .
&-um and also not forgetting or while also recognizing the perspectives of the authors of the two works that is they each have are presenting a kind of perspective on on on the state &-um and you should take that into account .
then under roman numeral two &{l=READING in recent decades much has been said about overpopulation on the African continent .
some have termed this population bomb and some have attributed crises in African development to high rates of fertility and reproduction on the African continent .
&}l=READING &-um even some I I didn't really want to put it in here have attributed to &-um heightened what they they consider as heightened sexuality among people on the African continent or African people .
&=reading &{l=NOTYPE__NOSUBTYPE in some of these arguments there is a sense that the essential features of Africa were relatively stable even resistance to +//.
resistant to change from time immemorial .
and in other arguments there is the view that the essential features of Africa changed dramatically under the influence of events and forces outside Africa's control .
in a well argued essay develop a portrait of the population issue in Africa from Africa's early past up to the nineteenth century confronting this question of continuity and change .
&}l=NOTYPE__NOSUBTYPE (0.4) and the last is &-uh taking a quote from Thornton and develop an essay on it my +//.
he says &=reading my examination of the military and political relations between Africans and Europeans concludes that Africans controlled the nature of their interactions with Europe .
&~Europe Europeans did not possess the military power to force Africans to participate in any type of trade in which their leaders did not wish to engage .
therefore all African trade with the Atlantic including the slave trade hadta be voluntary .
&=end and I think there's a_lot_of grist to to take up in that that one &-um so &-uh are there any questions well you know we can take some few minutes and discuss each each and any one of these yep Yatanya ?
&-um can you further define the ethics of domination +..?
for question A part one .
well &-um I think a a the the point applies in both .
&-um is that &-um +...
that there there's no doubt that we're talking in both of these examples and in other ones dealing with Africa about systems of domination in which there were there are are rulers and ruled .
and &-um you'll remember that I &-um put on the board this &-uh a couple times this &-uh this continuum of nice and evil &-uh you know that there seem to be forms of domination in Africa that were &-um &-um organized and cultivated to attract people voluntarily to join join a leader and provide that leader with more &-uh persons more power more reproductive capacity .
and &-um that you know that's what I put on the &~ni those kinds of &-uh practices that were associated with that form of leadership or domination we put on the &~ni you know I drew some out_of the discussion we had and put them on the over on the nice side of the continuum .
and then there were other forms of of domination that revolved around &-um &-uh &~seem seemingly involuntary means of control that could identify through conquest of other peoples through subjection of people to forced labor and slavery and to other elements of control I +//.
you know life and death control over over individuals &-uh a low regard for the the lives of subjects on the part of rulers and and that is &-um we put on sort_of the evil side of the continuum .
now I &~didn the that was just &~ev nice and evil continuum which is put there to &~hel you know assist in the discussion &-um I'm not asking you to buy into that .
it just seemed a way that we could differentiate one way we could differentiate different practices of of leadership of different practices of domination .
then there's another aspect of the ethics of domination I think you should think about that came out_of some of the discussions and I think is in &~s in some of the readings is that domination isn't &~al only about the exercise of power over people <and the> &-um and the &-uh way in which leaders and and rulers &-um choose to exercise &~thei their power but it's also about the way subjects understand and participate in these &-uh forms of domination .
so I I see ethics being sort_of like +...
&=writes:board there is &-uh you know &~may maybe two two axes one something like the +...
the nice and evil but there's also an axis that hasta do with the perspective of (0.4) whose (0.5) whose whose benefit is all this production of of power and expression of power ?
to whose end ?
whose whose benefit ?
and &-uh I I think different people have in a social or political situation will have different &-uh understandings of what those ethics are .
that really applies to the Zulu (be)cause I did my paper on Terrific Majesty and I thought it was really ironic that the Europeans the British who were in Natal were condemning Shaka's &-um (be)cause when Shepstone started his system of native administration they condemned Shaka's way of &-um ruling his people but in the end all they wanted to do was force the African people into into labor ⌊ themselves ⌋ .
⌈ mhm ⌉ mhm +/.
+, ⌊ and ⌋ .
⌈ and were ⌉ and were willing to adapt +/.
right +/.
+, a Shakan like system into their own administration +/.
+, ⌊ do to that ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ of natives ⌉ so+called natives you know .
right and I just think that's really ironic just it depends on the perspective like both systems could be +/.
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ considered ⌉ evil +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, (be)cause it's you know it's forced +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, labor and .
and there's something that I that's in in my mind that &~y you saw it in this book in in in the book but it is &-um this Zulu praise expression that's sometimes spelled &=writes:board &~baye@s:fra bayede@s:fra and sometimes bayeti@s:fra +...
and it's in &-um &~m Mofolo's book and it's also in &-um &-uh Caroline Hamilton's book .
is that &-uh this is the praise remember one of the in &~mof Mofolo's books one of the things he &~di introduced Shaka introduced &-uh in as when he organized his power was &-uh this praise bayede@s:fra which when people met him or saw him they would use this expression .
which is you know the all the films of the the &~na Nazi Germany is Heil Hitler it's a similar kind of praise except that his should only be used in the for the king or the ruler of the Zulu .
and and paradoxically or curiously it was also used for Shepstone .
you know uniquely .
but not used for anyone else .
so &~th I mean it's very powerful in the nineteen eighties when two hundred and fifty thousand people or or in nineteen oh seven or nineteen oh eight two hundred and seventy fifty thousand people &-uh call out bayede@s:fra simultaneously .
now for the &~s the South African government and white observers of this &-uh this praise when that when hundreds of thousands of people spoke this praise simultaneously chanted it you had a kind of Nuremburg type effect it was extremely powerful and influential and it promoted this idea that all Zulu believed simultaneously believed equally in the power of of Shaka or the power of Shepstone .
but I you know I I have cause to wonder whether people who chant a praise in a mob or a crowd all have the exactly same feeling about what the praise is and what the leadership is .
it's something that you do in a crowd and I think it actually may suggest just the opposite that there were all kinds of tensions about what this authority over individuals meant and how individuals would participate in this this system .
so that if an individual all he hadta do &~wa to show his loyalty to Shaka was at the &~per right moments to produce this praise .
it doesn't say much more than that about the loyalty of &~Sh of of people .
it might even say less about their loyalty if all you hafta do is sing this this praise or chant this praise .
and so you know I think it just opens up a &~q questions about the the sign of seams and crevices and differences among people and how they respond to leadership and how the perspective is is different and that they're +//.
and this is what I mean by an ethic or ethics of of of domination in <in that> in that sense .
so that's what I'm getting at and thank you for your help .
and &~o other are there questions about the other one ?
again yeah .
&=laughs:multiple .
for part two B can it be ⌊ opinionated ⌋ ?
⌈ in in Asantes ⌉ society there is someone who who speaks for the chief you don't +//.
this chief doesn't speak directly you speak to this person it's called the &=laughs:multiple &=pause_while_writing .
go ahead .
for part B can it be opinionated ?
would you speak a little louder ?
can part B be opinionated for two two B ?
you mean can you express your opinions or ?
yes .
well you I think that you from our readings and the work you've done already you you know that Djeliba is a griot an oral a specialist in oral tradition who has &~a .
two B .
two B .
⌊ not one B ⌋ .
⌈ yeah ⌉ .
the one about Thornton .
oh +/.
Thornton +/.
+, Thornton your opinions yeah but I think they should be &~aform informed .
don't you think ?
I mean +/.
+, ⌈ I'll <&~s I'll> &~s I'll go out ⌉ the door and walk in and say &~Th this is a load of nonsense .
okay ?
&=laughs:multiple &-um how many is that six words or something ?
&=laughs:multiple but I'd like more more than that you know because maybe the next person comes in and Thornton says you know I've got all the detail I've got all the <I have> I have all those maps I know everything going on in this subject and you've gotta produce some stronger argument than than this is just a bunch a nonsense .
&=laughs I've actually heard Thornton respond to critics in that way that that I mean xxx he produces a_lot_of of information for you and so does &-uh Reader I think to to develop an argument with him .
but it also you you know I think it not only calls for some detail some empirical detail it also you can also address the logic or illogic of this argument you know .
&~wh what in the why in the heck use the word voluntary in this system or something you know it's just a starting point .
you know why &~wh what is it about this whole discussion that a word like voluntary becomes such an important word to to form an argument ?
I was just gonna say that this question seems more like it's &-um answers your your sixth &~see &-uh theme of the course which is Africa determined or ⌊ negotiated ⌋ +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, and it seems like if &~y you could take the stance well this is wrong because Reader said this or you could say this is right because Thornton says this and he uses these this information .
+, mhm +/.
+, so it seems like .
well I think that it helps you &~fi +//.
I think you're exactly right .
it helps find a way in discussing the complexities of that determined or negotiated .
you know that it's kind_of like this &~s space you get into and you can't quite liberate yourself from this space (be)cause the issues are &~d you know about whether Africans have agency , do things on their own .
you know if you say they're involuntary then what is it gonna say about Africans' ability to form and constitute their own societies form states and yeah participate in the economies and so forth .
⌊ yeah xxx ⌋ .
⌈ not to be ⌉ cute or anything but I answered that exact question for my paper +/.
uhuh +/.
+, and I'm not sure but I think I did a pretty good job on it and I &=laughs:multiple simply reproduced +...

+, (be)cause <I think> I think I even used that +//.
this quote and +/.
+, yeah ⌊ I ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ and ⌉ and +/.
+, &=laughs I think I did too +/.

uhuh yeah I find the the weak link in the Thornton's xxx that we all find ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ no actually ⌉ I used another quote +/.
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.

and so the question is ⌊ can <you wanna> ⌋ .
⌈ I'm just wondering ⌉ I mean I don't want I mean <will you> will you consider it plagiarism if I cheat off myself or &=laughs:multiple .
I &~thi I think that &-uh .
will you remember it if I write the same thing ?
&=laughs:multiple .
xxx they're they're two different exercises and the the the that you +//.
that I that they they're independent of each_other and you have to make your own judgment and I'm not gonna I'm gonna not gonna put them +//.
one down compare it to the old the other one in detail .
you know I'll just have an idea you know I I write little notes to myself I have this Residential College practice of you know that you're supposed to write comments not just grades so I have comments on each paper so I I will know what your paper's done but I'm not +//.
if you want to do that ⌊ that's that's fine ⌋ .
⌈ I I don't ⌉ I don't but .
okay okay .
well I was sorta thinking the same thing when I saw it but &-uh I guess the way that I read it is that &-um the the assignment about the book review was to review the book +/.
yeah +/.
+, in comparison to itself whereas the question here is comparing it to other books and other things +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, from the class .
+, mhm +/.
+, so it would be a completely different answer .
I think so too probably yeah unless the first was stretched in some way .
+, okay &=laughs:SUm (0.9) so &-um I &~w I wanted to &-uh to &~t to start talking today and and Thursday about the &-uh the nineteenth century .
you okay about moving ahead ?
+, uhuh +/.
+, okay &-um one one general point that I &-um comes to mind is that &~hi African historians of the twentieth and twenty first centuries seem to need a nineteenth century Africa <for certain> for certain things .
&-um and I'd like to just put that on the table , <what the> <what I'm> &-uh what this this need for having being able to characterize nineteenth century Africa in certain ways .
&-um is that in +//.
from the eighteen eighties virtually all of Africa &-uh &-uh came &~un within twenty &-uh or twenty five years +//.
by between eighteen eighty and nineteen oh five virtually all of Africa came under European imperial domination .
and Europeans &-uh sought to create institutions to control Africans , to &~f to get their labor , to have Africans pay taxes , to pay the costs of administration , other things that I talked about early in the course .
and &-uh this new &-um system that that the British French &-um &~s eventually the Italians also the Belgians and the Germans up until the end of the First World War , &-um that they were trying to evolve there , was as I've said at different times &~a a couple times &-uh supposed to be a cheap system that paid for itself .
Europe was not willing to invest huge amounts of resources in the administration of these colonies .
and some of the arguments about how Europeans <got into the> got into these colonies is that they they backed in them against their own interests and wishes .
&-um &-um political kind_of diplomatic struggles having to do with Europe were transferred onto the African continent .
and claims were made in in Africa &-uh for different territories , the French doing this to to &~re react against the Germans or the British doing this to react against the French .
that in Africa <people were exercising> &-uh countries in Europe were exercising their interests &-um even when they saw <the dangers of of getting involved> the dangers and costs of getting involved more deeply in Africa .
&-um and the nineteenth century that is the period let's say from the late eighteenth call it a kind a average &~nin nineteenth century from the late eighteenth &~u seventeen eighties or seventeen nineties up until the eighteen eighties .
this era &-um was was one in which &-um European interests , companies , governments were all over the place in Africa but were withholding themselves from getting &~in more deeply involved .
and the reason that I think historians need a certain kind of nineteenth century Africa or why Europe needed a certain kind of nineteenth century Africa is that they hafta &-um do &~t &-uh their arguments about empire about &-uh &=speaking_to_student_leaving see ya +/.
+, see ya +/.
+, their arguments about empire about the responsibilities were she's not walking out on us +/.
+, oh +/.
+, she said she hadta leave early &-um &=laughs hadta be configured around &-uh &-uh two two kind_of competing principles .
one principle was that &-uh that Africa needed &-um the involvement of Europeans , a justification for Europeans being there .
that Africa needed civilization , it needed modernity , it needed &-uh European presence to completely end the effects of the slave trade and slavery in Africa .
so_that there was an absolute need for Europe to come in and transform Africa , this kind_of transformative need reform or transform .
and second that while Europe was smart benign humane and wasn't gonna transform Africa very much , it was gonna work with Africans in their own institutions , bring people along slowly steadily &-uh through education , &-uh through giving people &-uh marginal rights , through protecting their rights , through protecting African institutions .
and these two arguments &~fo that came about in the early twentieth century or the late nineteenth and early twentieth century , &-um that that &~Afri Africa hadta be &~tra transformed and Africa hadta be retained , &-um were two arguments that went hand in hand and kind_of worked with each_other and against each_other .
and and &~Eur neither Europe or Africa could &~effe escape from the effects of these two .
so_that given the presence of those two positions , those two arguments , <nineteenth century Africa> it would be useful if nineteenth century Africa could be &-uh presented as a period of of &-um terrible &-uh &-uh strife , difficulties , &-um &-um <kinds of> &-uh a_lot_of negative things going on in Africa that needed to be ended cured and healed .
or simultaneously that all those things that people thought about Africa , that it was primitive and uncivilized , were actually kind_of wrong .
that there were institutions in Africa that Europeans could work with .
that there were states that could be grafted on in a kind_of Shepstonian manner &-um onto European institutions and made to work to keep the price of imperialism &-uh costs down .
so_that when people historians and others attempted to develop pictures of the nineteenth century , this long nineteenth century , the pictures that they developed &~s &~s seemed to have these these two two features of them .
<a look towards> a look at events in the nineteenth century as representing Africa's own &-uh reform &-uh of of itself , of its own problems , of dealing with its own problems in ways that could be made thought of as continuous with the new reforms that Europeans are bringing in .
or secondly that <Africa could be represented> &-uh &~Afr events in Africa could be representative of something as an anathema <to African> &-uh to European ideas about what &~cev civilization should be .
and &-um <the Zulu> &-uh the story of the Zulu empire you can see <is &-uh a story about you_know how> is also a story about how Europeans or South African government and society &-uh &~a at large was dealing with that phenomenon .
the Buganda society <I mentioned> I talked about last week is an example of &-um a set of processes and developments underway that Europeans &~herald <heralded as &-uh representing> &-uh could herald as representing &-um the capacities of of African institutions to reform and build themselves in ways that would cheapen the costs of imperial responsibilities and could be incorporated in in <imperial &-um &-um world> &-uh imperial system .
&-uh and so then what was going on and +//.
talked about South Africa East Africa what is going on in West Africa .
well the the major characteristics of &-uh &~weth West Africa &-um there +//.
in a sense for the nineteenth centuries <there are> to oversimplify a little bit there are two West Africas .
there is the area of the former empires of &-uh Ghana , Mali , Songhai , the Sahelian or western Sudanic region &-uh north of the West Africa forest &-uh &-uh represented today by countries of Senegal , Gambia , Mali Burkina &~fas Faso , parts of of Guinea , northern Cote D_Ivoire , northern Ghana , &-um parts of southern Niger , northern Nigeria , &-uh southern Chad , northern Cameroon .
but <this belt of> this Sahelian or Sudanic belt was one region .
the other region &-uh was this area that had now for several centuries been &~con had contact directly with European trading institutions and the Atlantic &-uh trade , especially the Atlantic slave trade .
and so &~th there were really two &-um arenas in which &-um significant events took place in in the nineteenth century .
&-um in for the period for this Sudanic period .
that's what I wanna talk about today &-uh and I'll try to go through &~s swiftly .
this &-um the major characteristic or major event that was repeated over and over again throughout the region &-uh was the Islamic revolution .
a transformation of a society once one region &~sub region of the Sudanic belt &-uh after another by a a movement that we call an Islamic revolution .
&-uh and I have a quote here that pretty much from from Adu Boahen's paper in our Reader readings and parts of it comes from Ajayi .
&-um you can find the the citation , actual citation to Ajayi and Ajayi is another one of our reading .
&-uh but this is a different article &-um that &-uh &~t that takes these &~is series of Islamic revolutions , pretty much reduces them to &-um two or three sentences .
&-uh and I think that it pretty much represents what &-uh the general story is of these &-uh revolutions .
what was going on in the Sudan &-um around eighteen hundred was that the &-uh the old system of empires in the western Sudan had fallen away about two centuries earlier .
and what one had were a series of small states or city states , hundreds of them across the Sudan , &-um each with their own &-um governance , each with their own &-uh local economy , &-uh their own methods of extraction .
&-um but across the whole region <you would say> &-uh &~y if you you_know were looking at them &-uh <they would be> over any kind of hundred , two hundred , three hundred mile &~a region they'd look pretty similar .
if you compared the ones in northern Nigeria to the ones in southern Mali they would look different but the ones in northern Nigeria would &~s look pretty much the same .
and as you moved across the belt there would be similarities in any small region .
that's kind_of probably <an obvious> an obvious point .
&-um they were interconnected by trade routes , &-um market systems , &-uh &-uh calendrically organized market systems that moved around among the the states , &-um and connections &-uh also through &-um &-uh networks of Islamic scholarship that &-um connected all these .
almost all these city states &-uh in &-uh were governed by &-um Muslim rulers and had within their the cities an urbanized elite population that was substantially Muslim .
and in every one of these city states , almost every one of them , there &~we there was at least one mosque , central mosque .
there were centers of Islamic scholarship and learning .
and Islam was &-uh not only seated in the town but was a means of connection of the whole region in and of itself and to Islamic communities all over the world through &-uh periodic pilgrimages , <through the> &~tra through travel , &-uh through trade among Muslim &-uh traders .
but the &-uh the slave trade had had in its own time pulled resources away from these networks into exchange systems of the Atlantic .
and I think most historians agree that this area &-uh of the Sudanic belt became poorer as a result of the &-um Atlantic slave trade .
the whole region became impoverished .
it was dependent on <long distance trade> production for long distance trade .
and those trade routes moved south and the controlling elements those slave trade those routes moved south .
this is one &-uh explanation for the collapse of these large empires .
there was &~ver apparently very little profit involved in holding them all together that could support an &~im a broad imperial system that could claim control of city states over five hundred or a thousand miles .
so_that by eighteen hundred these areas &-uh were +//.
probably between fifteen hundred and eighteen hundred these this whole region had gone through a &-uh a process of economic decline .
and &-um at the same time &-um the &-uh slave trade had probably &-um &-uh introduced +//.
the slave trade across the Sahara , the slave trade to the south had probably <strengthened the> &-uh &~th &-um strengthened the the use of forced labor or slave labor in the &-um economies of these &-uh city states .
so_that on the one hand they became poorer and the other hand they became more involved <with the> with the organization of of &-uh labor the organization of society based on force and &-uh forced labor .
&-uh <there were> in the &-um nineteenth century &-uh there were four major &-uh Islamic revolutions that took place in West Africa that were &-uh &~re &~c clearly related to one another .
<there was a> there were other revolutions east of there in the &~s Sudan &-uh in Chad and Sudan that &-um were not as closely related , though the timing of them &-uh could be said to be related .
&-uh there was the Hausaland revolt of eighteen oh four .
and these &-uh revolutions <in the western> &-uh in this area of Senegambia , Mali , and Guinea , three of them , &-uh that lasted right up into the time that &-uh the French started to occupy the Senegambia region &-uh <in the> &-uh xxx to go inland and become involved with the &-uh &-uh those communities that were in revolt in the eighteen seventies .
&~samor Samori Toure &-uh is considered an Islamic revolutionary but also is one of the leading &-uh examples of of resistance to European conquest &-uh beginning in the eighteen seventies and &-uh &~th into &~eight end of the eighteen eighties .
and &-uh each of these revolutions &-um involved the &-um the unmaking of <traditional authorities> traditional political authorities in the region , the establishment <of a> &-uh of a caliphate with a &-uh a leader and a state based on Islamic principles , and the <the building of &-uh or> the spreading of Islam from the cities from the elite to the mass of the population or beyond .
I shouldn't say from the elite to the mass of the population because the mass of the population was generally in revolt against the the elites .
there are &-um two &-uh &-um I'm gonna go to roman numeral twenty eight &-uh if a_lot_of these &-uh these &~is these revolutions look similar to one another .
yeah ?
&-um so you just said that the that each revolution &-um +...
so what they had in common was that they unmade the governments ?
⌊ <and then> ⌋ .
⌈ &~un unmade ⌉ the traditional overthrew the traditional authorities in the region where they they operate .
&-um the there're two &~gen general process models of Islamic revolutions in Africa or in the world .
one is based on a sociological and comparative analysis of a number of revolutions .
and that's the &~f and the the on the outline that's one through six .
and the second is that there's actually a model within Islamic thought and Islamic &~his historiography , &~an a model of of revolution that is based on the prophet Mohammed's own life history .
and they you_know in some ways they interrelate and some ways they they don't you_know .
I think it's it's pretty interesting to keep both of them in mind &-uh and I've put them there and you can look at them &-uh &-uh your yourself .
I wanted to talk specifically about the <revolution in Islamic> revolution in in &-uh northern Nigeria or what was called Hausaland &-uh that began &-uh in in &-uh eighteen oh four .
&-um the &-uh in the late eighteenth century there was a &~milit a militant form of &-uh Islam that was spreading across the &~wester &-uh the Sudan region &-um moving from &-uh west to east .
<one of the> if you just look at the the nineteenth century and you look at at <when the> &~reve when these revolutions take place it looks like they spread from east to west .
but that's because we haven't looked at the revolutions in the eighteenth century is that +//.
in the eighteenth century there was a series of Islamic revolutions in this region and it's from there that the &-uh the ideas and some of the personnel involved in &~re revolutions <to the> to the east &-uh spread and then worked back west again .
and in northern Nigeria &-um &-uh started to &~s &-uh this this region here which today has probably a hundred or a hundred and twenty million people .
it started &-uh to &-uh experience &-um the movement into &-uh the region of &~ex &~is &-uh militant &-uh Islamic leaders associated with the Tijaniyya brotherhood .
these were &~as ascetic &-um devout &-uh fundamental &-um believers in Islam &-uh who &-uh moved about &-uh the &~th these regions and maintained contact <with each> with each_other .
and under the Tijaniyya there were a series of sort_of subunit brotherhoods and it was the Torodbe , &-uh specifically the Torodbe brotherhood &-uh within the Tijaniyya , that &-um moved into this region of northern Nigeria .
and what &-uh one of the the things that happened is that the Torodbe were particularly associated with the Fulani or Fula or Peul P U speaking people who tended in this period to be more mobile , to be &-uh pastoralists or or seminomadic who moved back and forth across this region .
sometimes carrying trade goods , sometimes just moving the livestock animals from one place to another , and &-um reestablishing themselves over time &-uh further to the the east .
and the Torodbe were &~es especially &-uh associated with the Fulani Fular .
Peul speaking people .
I think I've spelled this wrong I think it's P E U L .
&=writes:board sometimes the language family is called Pular or Fular .
and what they found <when they got to northern> &~ni as they came into northern Nigeria is they found the city states dominated by &-um rulers who were Hausa speaking .
and the states , the cities themselves were Hausa speaking .
&-um a one of the Fula teachers was named Uthman Dan Fodio .
and &-um he got into a series of arguments , a kind_of &~Luth Martin Luther type arguments with the Islamic clerics who were associated with the rulers of these Hausa city states .
and the argument &-uh went like this .
the &-uh Uthman said that &-uh while these rulers were Muslim claimed to be Muslim and while they accommodated Muslim scholars and protected the mosque in their towns that they did not abide by the restrictions , the ideals of orthodox Islam .
and that in fact that the rulers' patronage of of the Muslim scholars in the towns , the the patronage of Islam in the town , actually &-uh was actually the opposite of what it looked like .
that it was a way of maintaining the illusion of an Islamic community without it being Islamic at all .
it allowed the rulers to get away with having the presence of this more cosmopolitan population in the town and being able to kind_of domesticate them to the interests of the Hausa city state .
and the the rulers' own identification with Islam was a pretense in_order_to keep <these foreign> &~elem these foreign elements who connected them through trade systems , cultural systems , to the wider world .
and &-um and so_that what Uthman was saying was that Islam was being maintained in these city states pretty much as a foreign &-uh accommodation to a foreign religion .
and what he was calling for was a complete transformation of the society into an Islamic &-uh &~I into &~is Islamic society and &-um and &-uh a &-uh destruction of this compromised corrupt system of Hausa government governance .
what he had going for him was this sort_of economic crisis , this kind_of steady state of depression in the area and the effects of the ruler Hausa rulers .
&-uh tax systems specifically , or labor and tax and labor systems , where in in spite of depression these Hausa city state rulers could keep up their way of life , their control , through &-um &-uh heavily taxing the income and labor of the people not only in the towns and the surrounding areas .
and this was a max +//.
so_that underneath or alongside this call to orthodox Islam was this economic interest , this kind_of &-uh social interest in &-uh and tax revolt .
&-um and what the other &~Uth so Uthman had &-uh going for him &-uh a response to an economic crisis &-um &-uh negative feelings about the the rulership taxes labor and he also was able to use the Fulani his connection to Fulani to bring &-um to his side into his movement the Fulani who lived in these city states .
and the Hausa speaking people who lived in the countryside .
so it became kind_of a combination movement .
he had the Hausa in the countryside who didn't like the taxation of <the city> their city masters .
he had the Fulani who saw the this Islamic movement as something like a Fulani movement &-uh that would could overcome Hausa domination .
&-uh he had <the religious> this religious debate where he claimed the high ground , the orthodox ground .
and &-uh within a few years <he had an> you_know in in northwest part of this northern Nigeria region he had &-um the Hausa leaders worrying about &-um a kind_of steady state of revolt .
and &-um they started to act against the movement after they found that Uthman would not compromise .
they tried to negotiate compromises and he said +"/.
+" there's no compromise .
+" you can't compromise these kind of Islamic principles .
+" we need &-uh &-uh an &~is &-uh orthodox Islamic society .
+" that's what we're calling for .
+" and &-uh there is no compromise .
+" no accommodation is possible .
&-uh and so &-uh in the course of that he moved into this role of the classic &-uh &-uh &~pro &-uh story of the prophet Mohammed .
he declared went into exile , declared a jihad , which a holy war against these city states , and one by one &-um they fell or he conquered every single one of them in northern Nigeria .
&-uh and &-uh the fact that these city states had &~alre were already at odds with each_other in tension one from another meant that <he could pick them off> he and his movement could pick them off one at a time .
and &-uh he established in each city state an emirate .
an &~e &-uh each each city state was led by an emir under what was the caliphate of +...
&=writing:board there were fourteen emirs which correspond to pretty much the fourteen districts of northern Nigeria that the British established &-uh in the early twentieth century when they established a protectorate over &-um northern Nigeria .
and then Uthman said +"/.
+" I have done my work .
+" it's taken twenty seven years .
+" I've done this .
+" I've established a caliphate , a holy Islamic state in &~th <in this> &~gr in this region .
+" &-um we have converted the people of this region .
I_mean substantially he was correct that from there being a very small percentage of people who were actually practicing Islam it came to be a very large percentage of the population was after this twenty seven year period .
&-um he had in a way created a revolution &-uh a massive change in law social life and so forth .
but he then retired and left everything in the control of the fourteen emirs and of his son who went on to allow the emirs to each develop their own administration .
and each of them in_order_to develop the resources of their own emirate or their own city state started to adopt the original Hausa titles , to incorporate some of the old Hausa leadership into their governments , &-um to recognize Hausa law as as operative in their emirates , and to slowly steadily yield the &-uh perfect ideal Islamic state in in their own areas .
and I think <what the story> you_know it's an old story of very hard to sustain a revolution , the ideals of a revolution .
&-um it's it's possible to win a victory but sustaining it over a long period of time creating a &-uh permanent structure is &-uh is really &-uh testing .
and you_know one sees this in in Iran .
Iran you_know in our lifetimes has had a very important Islamic revolution and it is having difficulty now sustaining it .
it has all kinds of other issues that the &~is Islamic theory , Islamic law in its orthodox form cannot work out .
&-um are are being exercised by people who sought &-um to exercise &~oth other interests in other ways .
and &-uh the momentum of the revolution , the original Islamic revolution , just can't be sustained forever .
&-um now to bring you up to date in northern Nigeria &-um there is a new ferment it's I would say it's it's a perhaps ten years old and it is to to &-um &~inst institute more fully Islamic law into the life of northern Nigeria into the legal social and political framework of northern Nigeria .
and one state after another &-uh of these &-uh fourteen or so states now in in northern Nigeria is is introducing Islamic law &-um as the the guiding law of the state and there are &-uh tremendous conflicts going on about the establishment of Islam &-uh in &-uh societies that are <in the> in the Nigerian nation .
and &-uh the government through three governments has not known how to deal with this this movement .
&-um and so that this at the end of the nineteenth century &-uh what we have is that a substantial &-um transformation of this arena of the western Sudan into an Islamic society that is not just &-uh &-uh represented by elites in the cities but &-uh &-uh throughout the population .
where a greater part of the population in any area of the western &~Su Sudan is identifies themselves with Islam Islamic and practices Islam and is open &~an and susceptible to &-um reform Islam new Islamic reforms new Islamic fundamentalism and and to &-uh to you know building a &-uh a &~sys@n building a nation within a nation Islamic nation within a more &~di diverse nation like Nigeria or Cote D_Ivore .
and &~r you know right now in the Ivory Coast this is a a a major issue there there're &-um an Islamic leader who &-uh was disbarred from running for for president and now seems like you know some negotiation is taking place how to bring him back into the government .
his name is Wattara &-uh on Thursday I wanna shift to the &-um this coastal region and talk about the &~thi this these transformations taking place in that region .
yeah .
I just wanted to make sure did you say it was wrong to look at it as being &~the these revolutions the unmaking of traditional authorities and the establishment of Islamic +...
the spread of Islam is it wrong to look at it as the elites spreading it to the masses or is that the way ?
no it's it's wrong to look at it as the elites spreading it to the masses that was a a misspoke on my part .
it's that these &~we tended to be mass movements with new kinds of leadership that hadn't been seen in these parts of West Africa before .
leaders who were &-uh came out_of these brotherhoods and were anti +...
antagonistic and wanted to overthrow the &~si the the more privileged Islamic scholar scholars and leaders clerics and judges that operated in each of these towns and that they felt each of these city states that they felt saw as corrupted .
(0.4) so you_know <they could> because it came from outside the &~cit city states they could attack the system of the &~ci the city state model of +...
you_know here you have a heterogeneous population under the head <of a> of a ruling family that is connected to a ruling family over here , a ruling family over there , that we saw like in the Sunjata case .
this probably goes back to that model that comes from the archaeologists Mackintosha of of the Mackinstoshes that you've heard about or read about in Reader and had the article .
where there were these heterogeneous towns that each seemed to have their own governance system their own local economies but connected to network in that system +...
which seems to have lasted at least three thousand years seemed to be &~overthr what I'm saying is seemed to be overthrown by these mass movements .
Islamic movements .
in these revolutions .
but there was also a tendency for the revolutions to run out_of gas and to reaccommodate this this traditional leadership .
and &-uh and and and bring them back into the system .
in a way it's a revolution but there's an old long established system that won't go away .
and you could look at the political topography of this and it maintains itself through ancient city states the conquests of Uthman Dan Fodio the British &-uh incorporation of northern Nigeria as a protectorate through the various governments of Nigeria attempting to create a federal system through the establishment of these estates .
you know the the political topography of this remains pretty stable in spite of the that that we had imperialism working backwards new governments new ideas of federalism imperialism and an Islamic revolution .
yeah ?
on the same note you may have said this but &-um the leaders like &~Uth Uthambo is that his name ?
Uthman Dan Fodio ⌊ <I put his name here> ⌋ .
Uthman ⌈ Dan Fodio ⌉ is like these were local people &~the they weren't &-uh foreigners coming to this region right ?
well Uthman Dan Fodio was local to this region up here but he wasn't local to you know were the conquests ended up .
<but it> but it wasn't so I guess my +//.
it was not it wasn't transsaharan@n$adj ?
no .
okay .
no all all of them could could you know like in Buganda all of them could &~con claim to be local +...
you know because if you were a Fulani you could claim that you could be anywhere local you had local connections wherever you were .
that you could always claim to be local but you could also be sort_of dispatched as some kind_of foreign element you know these Fula they just herd &~c animals you know they don't know anything about governing cities .
&-uh they're not from here they're not from this town they come from somewhere else so I mean there're there're there're competing arguments political arguments about who these people were and what the values were what the worth was .
(0.5) okay I've said enough and probably
