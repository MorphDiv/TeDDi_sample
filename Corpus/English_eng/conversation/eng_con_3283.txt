no . 0_626
no . 626_955
no . 955_1466
okay . 1466_2098
and this is two squared times +... 2098_4876
x@l squared . 4876_6415
x@l squared . 6415_6836
x@l squared . 6836_7316
right ? 7316_7750
okay . 7750_9001
turn your paper over . 9001_10376
look at section one . 10376_12665
for the next minute I want you to do the first three problems . 12665_17168
and in your head think if you can come up with the rule, after you've done these problems, for multiplying these exponents . 17168_25778
see if you see a pattern developing on your own . 25778_29000
don't talk to your neighbor . 29000_30568
just do those three problems . 30568_31856
and if you need to expand it out to get the answer like I did, that's what I'd like you to do . 31856_42783
expand the problem out, the multiplication out, and then combine it with an answer to a power . 42783_48385
okay . 48385_49623
oh . 49623_51391
okay . 51391_68985
expand that out . 68985_69743
expand it out on your paper . 69743_72883
okay . 72883_100336
expand that out . 100336_101275
show me what that is . 101275_103386
I want you to expand those out . 103386_104860
all of those out before you come up with your answer . 104860_107555
okay . 107555_108586
expand those out like I did on the board please . 108586_111201
can I xxx by expanding ? 111201_113926
right . 113926_114303
yes . 114303_114640
I want you expanding them out . 114640_115606
good . 115606_116006
okay . 116006_116943
mm hmm . 116943_117726
and then give us the final answer . 117726_119133
so you want us to just tree, branch off, and just +... 119133_121501
yeah . 121501_121796
okay . 121796_122213
yes, Brett ? 122213_125461
just asking am I doing it right ? 125461_129485
is that right ? 129485_130701
yes . 130701_131325
yes ? 131325_131741
okay . 131741_132510
now that most of you have the problems worked out, I want you in your group to discuss if you see something +... 132510_142325
a pattern developing when you're multiplying the exponents . 142325_144660
if you see something that you can do with the exponents . 144660_147770
discuss it with your group . 147770_150251
do we do you want us to do our rule thing too ? 150251_153875
yes . 153875_154228
okay . 154228_154786
I already know what ? 154786_158550
yeah . 158550_159596
don't you, like, add the little exponents together to get xxx . 159596_163198
no xxx . 163198_164505
otherwise, you just +... 164505_165390
no . 165390_166261
you're not xxx . 166261_166973
okay . 166973_167213
well, yeah that too, but what did you guys get for the rule ? 167213_168731
did you come up with a rule ? 168731_169685
you just add all the exponents, and if there's a letter +... 169685_171348
I I understand . 171348_171755
okay . 171755_173445
so then what what that doesn't show me a rule, though . 173445_176251
what does a@l to the M, times gto the n@l . 176251_179548
if you say you're gonna add exponents, how would you write that ? 179548_182045
a@l plus n@l equals +... 182045_185126
equals +... 185126_188455
okay . 188455_190350
what's your base ? 190350_191238
remember your exponent has to be written to a base . 191238_193880
what's your base in this problem ? 193880_195646
a@l . 195646_196420
okay . 196420_197003
okay . 197003_198125
did I do this right ? 198125_198885
and so you're saying then that you just add the exponents . 198885_202828
okay . 202828_203635
very good . 203635_204316
you would say, add the exponents +... 204316_207101
the exponents to +... 207101_207698
add the exponents to find your base +... 207698_216545
okay . 216545_216865
so you're just saying that you're gonna yeah . 216865_217971
to find your base exponent ? 217971_219281
or how would you say, add the add the exponents xxx . 219281_222425
how would you what would you call it ? 222425_223376
add the exponents is sufficient . 223376_223935
add the exponents . 223935_224536
mm hmm . 224536_224795
mm hmm . 224795_225538
so you have to add the exponents ? 225538_226345
so then show me that . 226345_227311
xxx, you know how to spell it, right ? 227311_228673
okay . 228673_229001
Robert, what did you find out ? 229001_231330
what oh, I was gonna ask you a question . 231330_234343
okay . 234343_234810
ask the question . 234810_235521
do we have to write it in words ? 235521_237431
no . 237431_238631
you can you can do it in symbols, Robert . 238631_240001
okay . 240001_240313
in that case, we are +... 240313_242728
if I a@l to the m@l times a@l to the n@l, what did we find out when we multiplied ? 242728_246895
a@l to the m@l plus n@l . 246895_249513
okay . 249513_251006
did anybody get something different ? 251006_254245
xxx . 254245_256001
okay . 256001_256358
what did you get, Chad ? 256358_256839
a@l to the n@l in the parentheses and then n@l on the outside of the parentheses . 256839_259825
no that's not right . 259825_261785
no . 261785_262215
a@l to the m@l in parentheses and to the outside n@l . 262215_266061
okay . 266061_267158
so then you found so how would I do it if I had a@l to the two to the four ? 267158_273101
you would a@l to the sixth ? 273101_278295
so you just add it ? 278295_279158
okay . 279158_279580
so you're saying that if you have it this way, it's being added . 279580_282543
okay . 282543_283871
what does parentheses stand for in math ? 283871_285868
multiplication . 285868_286861
okay . 286861_287878
so would someone seeing this say, oh, multiplication or addition, do you think ? 287878_292428
multiplication . 292428_293163
multiplication . 293163_293518
multiplication . 293518_294515
okay . 294515_294941
so then how are you gonna show me since you tell me that if I add these two that's gonna be the answer . 294941_300140
how can I show it such that it's being added ? 300140_303268
what Robert says . 303268_304645
okay . 304645_305141
okay . 305141_307130
so are yes, Austin ? 307130_309363
I got a@l and then twenty seven . 309363_311660
on which problem ? 311660_314035
on the rule . 314035_315156
for the rule . 315156_315468
okay . 315468_316075
and what did you plug in for m@l and n@l, then ? 316075_319435
I said n@l is a@l to n@l to the abc's is thirteen . 319435_324491
okay . 324491_325551
so you took all you took all the you took all the A's out of the problem . 325551_329151
right ? 329151_329626
yeah . 329626_330010
okay . 330010_330560
those were just examples to look at to find a pattern . 330560_333408
(be)cause if you look at the first problem, we had a@l square times a@l to the fourth and we got a@l to the +... 333408_339288
sixth . 339288_339808
sixth . 339808_340303
and two plus four is +... 340303_341873
six . 341873_342338
six . 342338_342708
okay . 342708_343056
then we had a@l squared times a@l . 343056_345355
and what's the exponent on a@l ? 345355_346530
one . 346530_347296
one . 347296_347711
so two plus one is +... 347711_348880
three . 348880_349646
and we got a@l cubed . 349646_350680
right ? 350680_350951
for number two . 350951_351840
yeah . 351840_352455
and then on number three we had a@l cubed times a@l times a@l to the fourth . 352455_357445
so three plus one plus four is +... 357445_360080
eight . 360080_360485
a@l to the eighth . 360485_361910
okay . 361910_362305
so you found that when we are multiplying the same base, did you notice that the base had to be the same ? 362305_370493
okay . 370493_371648
when you multiply the same base with exponents we just add the exponents to get the new answer . 371648_381351
right ? 381351_381663
okay . 381663_382725
let's look at section two . 382725_384400
do problems four through six . 384400_385966
multiply that out and see if you can find the rule for that . 385966_388998
and I want you to expand it . 388998_391390
it's very important that you expand it . 391390_392873
(be)cause when you expand it, you'll be able to see the pattern much more quickly . 392873_396903
okay . 396903_398436
three a@l, two, two . 398436_402685
Miss xxx ? 402685_402980
yes . 402980_403418
when you do this three, you break that ? 403418_404876
okay . 404876_405243
that's cubed . 405243_405830
right ? 405830_406385
so how many times would you multiply the inside part ? 406385_409963
what's in the inside part ? 409963_410961
the two a@l squared . 410961_412443
okay . 412443_412856
so write a@l squared . 412856_413691
and how many times would you have a@l squared ? 413691_416435
three oh, three times . 416435_417618
oh, three times . 417618_417908
okay . 417908_418530
so write that out . 418530_419450
xxx, you would break it down, and right . 419450_421698
okay . 421698_421970
so now you have that . 421970_423011
can you break that down even further now ? 423011_424890
I did . 424890_425536
what's a@l squared look like ? 425536_427228
a@l times a@l . 427228_428283
okay . 428283_428836
and then you have to have how many sets of those ? 428836_431243
a@l multiplied by a@l . 431243_431878
three . 431878_432150
three . 432150_432381
three . 432381_432588
three . 432588_433093
so then you write that out and you've expanded it . 433093_436638
it'd be a@l, by a@l, by a@l, by a@l, by a@l, by a@l . 436638_439388
so it would be a@l to the sixth . 439388_439988
so how many A's would you have ? 439988_440516
six . 440516_440815
a@l to the +... 440815_441575
so it would be a@l to the +... 441575_442245
sixth power . 442245_442526
good . 442526_443211
okay . 443211_443740
so make sure you expand it out . 443740_445843
that's +... 445843_446573
that's what I got . 446573_447050
yes . 447050_447945
Lucia, did you have a question ? 447945_449146
oh, I get it . 449146_450091
I get it . 450091_450531
no, I was asking the same thing as she did, but I heard you explain it . 450531_452498
what's that ? 452498_452738
how you I'm gonna just write it three times, write this three times ? 452738_458440
what's in the parentheses is being cubed . 458440_459808
so it's three times . 459808_460865
right ? 460865_461153
yeah, so +... 461153_461865
okay . 461865_462170
then how do you break out for your a@l squared ? 462170_463801
two a@l ? 463801_465840
you go two a@l . 465840_466815
right ? 466815_467218
yeah . 467218_467583
a@l times a@l, and you do that three times . 467583_469473
right ? 469473_469751
so how many a@l, do you end up with ? 469751_471370
a@l to the sixth . 471370_471791
six . 471791_472096
a@l to the sixth . 472096_472961
so then it'll be a@l to the sixth . 472961_474610
he got a@l to the fifth . 474610_475343
how did you all get six a@l ? 475343_476015
I got five a@l . 476015_477038
because two times three is six . 477038_479406
did you do okay . 479406_479613
and that's xxx six . 479613_479815
okay . 479815_480193
show him . 480193_480558
so see, you do . 480558_481615
well now show him, Lucia . 481615_482975
show him how yours is broken out . 482975_485005
explain to Chad how that works . 485005_486368
here . 486368_486768
if there's three, it's a@l squared times three, so you have to do three a@l squared, then you have to break it down to a@l times a@l . 486768_494836
(be)cause that's what a@l squared is, and then you do that for each of them and that's three a@l squared with xxx . 494836_501451
so basically I isn't the rule, like, you just times whatever's in here ? 501451_502423
the number by that . 502423_502796
so you're gonna multiply your exponents, right ? 502796_502973
yeah . 502973_503230
okay . 503230_503716
did you guys have it ? 503716_504568
so you multiplied the two and three and got six ? 504568_505326
yep . 505326_505973
yeah . 505973_506221
you have your rule ? 506221_506733
xxx oh . 506733_507166
what's your rule ? 507166_508240
don't forget your rule . 508240_509501
don't forget to do your rule if you have determined it with your group . 509501_512908
all right . 512908_513934
yes . 513934_514238
can we &~sh we xxx that it was multiplying . 514238_518181
can we show it anyway we want ? 518181_518765
okay . 518765_519046
that's that's exactly yes . 519046_520659
hi . 520659_522116
I'm on t_v . 522116_522781
yes . 522781_528560
xxx . 528560_529453
how do you do this one ? 529453_530883
it said like +... 530883_532011
so on number five we xxx ? 532011_533226
okay . 533226_533885
so you have a@l squared . 533885_535373
right ? 535373_536196
yeah . 536196_536828
and how many times do you need a@l squared ? 536828_538310
three . 538310_539285
three times . 539285_539975
so you have it once here . 539975_541135
where's the other two times ? 541135_542411
don't you need three a@l squares ? 542411_545188
this one . 545188_545495
no . 545495_545841
no . 545841_546020
no . 546020_546146
don't look at that bottom part . 546146_547308
oh . 547308_547953
I want you to write that out in expanded form . 547953_550418
