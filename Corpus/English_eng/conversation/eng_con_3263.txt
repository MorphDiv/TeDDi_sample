all stand .
onegaishimasu .
onegaishimasu .
okay .
onegaishimasu .
okay, we're going to start our homework answer comparisons so, please take out handout number nine .
now I'll have you write it .
please write, right ?
okay, it's this row .
one, two, three, four, five, six .
okay, then please write it .
okay .
okay, go ahead .
go ahead .
please write it .
okay .
I'm going to check it so those of you who haven't done it .
please hurry and do it, okay ?
this +...
then .
I will hold this microphone +...
and walk around .
okay .
okay, then I'm going to check it so please show it to me, okay ?
okay .
okay .
oh, great .
everyone did their homework today because we're going to be on t_v .
did you copy it ?
just one person +...
just one person is a little different .
arai !
this child +...
has forgotten his homework .
please show it to me .
bancho, you could do it by yourself, right ?
chino ?
are you feeling better now ?
okay .
that's fine .
okay, go ahead .
arai, please hurry and write it .
it's only you, Arai .
okay .
okay, then I had you write six so +...
we'll compare answers together and verify them .
okay, number one .
you exchange it and two X is less than fourteen .
we divide both sides by two, so the inequality is X is less than seven .
number two .
transpose and negative five X is less than negative ten .
then you're dividing both sides by negative five so X is greater than or equal to negative two .
okay, then the third one .
date, please interpret this .
multiply all with ten .
oh, you mean you multiplied ten, right ?
okay .
ten line up all of the head numbers and multiply them by ten, and twelve X minus four X is, it's already like this, right ?
okay .
six and then forty two .
if you organize them like this, eight X is less than forty eight and X is less than negative six .
and number four is +...
take off the brackets and three X plus twelve is greater than five X plus two .
then you transpose, and negative two X is greater than minus ten and +...
when you divide both sides what is wrong at this point ?
where is it wrong here ?
if I told you to correct it +...
where would you correct it ?
eguchi, here +...
where should you correct it ?
how would you fix this ?
number three and number nine .
that problem is wrong .
teacher .
now it's okay, isn't it ?
yes .
okay .
then how about this ?
oh, negative two X .
yeah .
at the negative two the inequality sign doesn't change yet .
it's okay as it is .
and when you divide it on both sides by negative two then the direction is changed to the opposite and X is less than five .
right ?
huh ?
it changed a lot when it became negative two .
even if you combine like terms there is nothing that can change the inequality sign so just moving this one thing won't change it .
this is written, so, this is here .
so because this is here you can change the direction, you know .
you don't change it at the negative two part ?
right .
you don't change it at this point .
you change the direction while you divide both sides with this denominator, you know .
I didn't change it like that .
because this this changes it to negative two .
because you do it with this .
write it like this and +...
I was too lazy to write that at the bottom .
people who write it like this are okay .
this corresponds .
this is fine .
yes .
it's just that there's this line and this line but +...
okay .
then number five .
the brackets are removed .
negative six X is less than negative seven .
where was it strange when you were doing it ?
why does it end up as this kind of fraction ?
x greater than or equal to seven sixths ?
correct .
okay, this is fine .
there was one that became a fraction, right ?
then the sixth one .
it seems like it was multiplied by ten and was all calculated, but +...
you need to multiply ten to this two as well and make it twenty, so +...
please be careful here because you may forget to write this .
then thirteen X is greater than negative thirteen and +...
x is greater than negative one .
then +...
four or more correct is good .
it's a passing mark .
then +...
people who could do four or more .
you are paper, okay ?
then people who did less than four are stone, okay ?
one, two, and three !
people who had four or more are paper, you know .
people below four are stone .
arai has zero, right ?
yes .
it seems like everyone other than Arai is okay .
arai .
let's do our homework from now on, okay ?
huh ?
okay .
that's what it's about .
okay, then today will be the final part of the sentence problems so, then +...
I will have everyone use their heads and think a little, okay ?
until now we've just done calculation practice, but today we will have to use your heads a little so +...
I'm asking you to use thinking methods .
how to think and how to look for it and think about it may be a little difficult you know .
more difficult than just simply calculating, that is .
right ?
well then we'll go ahead .
okay .
well then +...
please look at +...
the problem .
fukuda, can you see it ?
yes ?
can you see ?
I can see .
you can see .
okay .
then, Genji .
please read the problem +...
in English .
0 .
0 .
okay .
genji, please read the problem .
you would like to buy ten cakes all together for less than two thousand one hundred yen .
one type of cake is three hunred thirty yen each and the other cakes are two hundred yen each .
yes .
do you understand the meaning of the problem ?
arai, do you understand what this problem means ?
you have two hundred thirty yen cakes and two hundred yen cakes, right ?
the two hundred and thirty yen cakes are a bit more expensive .
and +...
you have ten family members .
you want to buy cakes for each person .
but, I have only two thousand one hundred yen .
which cake +...
seems more delicious ?
the two hundred thirty yen one .
the more expensive one is somehow more desirable, right ?
and so +...
you want to buy as many expensive cakes +...
as you can, but what's the maximum that you can buy ?
that's the problem .
understand ?
0 ?
there are cakes that are two hundred thirty yen and two hundred yen .
you only have two hundred ten yen .
but you need to buy ten .
but the two hundred thirty yen one looks more delicious so you want to buy as many as possible .
nine .
but you only have two thousand one hundred yen, so +...
so in fact how many two hundred thirty yen cakes can you buy ?
nine .
so today I am going to have you think about how to find the answer .
so now I will pass out paper, so please try and think about it .
see you can do it if you do it like this .
see if you can understand solve it if you do it like this .
I will present the problem in this way, okay ?
use the back, too .
four, five, six .
two, three, four, five, six .
I didn't pass out the papers so +...
four, five, six, here .
one, two, three, four, five, here .
one, two, three, four, five, six .
three, four, five, six .
okay .
I don't care about what kind of method you use so please think about if you do this, you can buy two hundred thirty yen cakes .
think about how many you could buy and how to figure it out .
do we solve this problem ?
this problem is for ninth graders, so you can't solve it, so please use the back .
please use back of the paper and think about it a little .
what do you need to do in order to buy two hundred and thirty yen cakes and up to how many can you buy and bring home ?
please think about this for a while .
it's good if you come up with an answer, but please think about what you need to know about how many to buy .
well, we have about three minutes so it's okay if you do it while you write notes there .
so, think about what you need to do to find out how many you can buy and find the answer .
okay, get started .
please work by yourself at first, okay ?
if you were in front of the store and you only had two hundred and ten yen and you had to buy ten .
what should you do ?
think about the time that you were in front of the store .
what would you do ?
what ?
please think about +...
that okay ?
then how are you going to think about it ?
please show me how you are thinking about it .
that you can find it if you do such and such .
0 .
0 .
okay .
go ahead .
can you bargain and lower the price ?
ordinarily they wouldn't bargain, would they ?
although they might bargain if it were at a vegetable or fish store .
I have never seen them bargain +...
at a cake store .
they might have bargained if it were Kenchan's Cakes, right ?
oh, don't you know it ?
ah, I did it .
okay .
please think about it by yourself for a while .
about two minutes left .
I told you not to use this but to use the back, didn't I ?
we're buying ten ?
we're buying ten anyhow .
you need to buy ten so +...
please buy ten, okay ?
buy ten +...
because +...
what you really want is to buy ten two hundred and thirty yen cakes, right ?
but if you buy ten two hundred and thirty yen cakes how much will it cost ?
two thousand three hundred yen .
it'll end up being two thousand three hundred yen, right ?
however, you only have two thousand two thousand one hundred yen in cash so +...
you need to mix, mix it up or you can't buy it, you know ?
because you only have two hundred and ten yen in cash .
then how do you need to think about it +...
in order to find out how many two hundred and thirty yen cakes to buy ?
please think about that .
please think about it .
I don't care what kind of method you use .
inequality equation .
oh, if you want to set up an inequality equation go ahead, that's fine, too .
if someone else says that they want to think about it with a different method because they don't need an inequality equation +...
that, that is fine for that person, too .
I want to know how you think about it so +...
I will ask you about thinking +...
about how you thought about it .
see +...
being asked to figure out how to think about it is more difficult than being asked to solve an equation, isn't it ?
okay, go ahead .
is it not permissible to buy nine ?
I don't get this .
don't get it ?
but, if you really were buying two kinds of cake you have to think about money, the money that you have and the bill .
after you ask for the bill you can't say I'm sorry I want to return this .
can you ?
then you exchange .
that has happened to me a lot, too .
I say oh, sorry !
please return this .
at any rate +...
please buy ten cakes .
how are you going to think about it ?
it's also okay if it's over ten, right ?
not over ten .
buy ten +...
buy ten ?
ten ?
you're buying ten, you know .
ten .
ten .
it's not eleven or twelve or eight, but buy exactly ten, okay ?
well, then how can you +...
find out +...
how many you can buy ?
there are people who +...
would have them take the cake, take a two hunred yen cake and break it in half and make it one hundred yen .
okay, then you go to the cake store and try and request that .
most people won't do such a thing, you know .
it's different from asking to have half a Japanese radish, you know .
if you ask them to halve the Japanese radish they'd do it for you .
it's okay +...
if it's a Japanese radish .
so how do you think about this ?
not by using equations or things like that but tell me what you have to do to get the answer .
buying two thousand +...
two +...
two thousand one hundred yen exactly +...
we don't need to +...
it's okay if we have change left over, right ?
it's okay if there's left over .
it's good if you have change in any case .
change, or else it's also okay if you use all of the two thousand one hundred yen, you know .
well there is one minute of remaining time .
I don't understand this .
you're all good at this setting up an equation and suddenly spitting out an answer .
try doing it with that method .
okay .
then +...
we'll have midway presentations .
okay, please raise your heads .
then people who thought that it seemed sort of better to do it this way and understood the method +...
you are paper, right ?
not yet, now .
people who had no idea how to do it +...
you're stone +...
okay ?
okay, people who think it's best to do it this way, but say +...
you don't understand +...
you don't have confidence, are scissors, okay ?
although from looking at what you were writing it seems like stones are plentiful .
but, I'll try and ask you, okay ?
okay, then students who understood the way of thinking are paper .
and then +...
people who say that you can do it to some extent and you understand it are paper, okay ?
people who say +...
I don't understand it at all are stone, okay ?
people who say that they are in the middle are scissors, okay ?
okay .
then one, two, and +...
three .
oh +...
there are no paper people .
what's paper ?
paper is people who say that they understand it completely .
one person .
okay .
then scissors people and paper people, there are even quite a few stone people who responded, right ?
okay, then I will try and ask a few people, okay ?
okay, then Hara .
how did you think about it ?
what ?
okay, go ahead .
I +...
didn't understand it at all but +...
first of all +...
I thought that I should calculate +...
how many of the two hundred thirty yen ones I could buy and +...
in the beginning +...
when I did it with ten +...
it ended up being two thousand three hundred yen so +...
it's not good because it's over the amount so +...
and then next when I did it with nine +...
when I did it with nine +...
it was two thousand seventy yen and +...
it was okay but .
you need to buy ten, so when I calculated it +...
to buy one two hundred yen cake +...
two +...
two thousand seventy plus +...
two hundred yen is +...
with two hundred seventy yen and +...
you go over .
you go over, don't you ?
okay .
so then +...
you keep reducing the numbers and +...
keep reducing and +...
when you do it with eight on this side and two this side, then ?
when I did it +/.
when you did it ?
time ran out and +...
time ran out and +...
I couldn't do it to the end .
you couldn't do it to the end .
okay .
raise your hand +...
if you say that this way of thinking was really similar to yours .
hara started counting from ten, but +...
there may be people who started counting from this side .
people who say that they used this way of thinking .
okay .
only, Ikui ?
arai ?
okay .
then Ikui, Arai, Joji, right ?
then Ikui +...
where did you find an answer that was exactly even ?
or could you not find the answer ?
were you at the point in which you were do counting it like this but time ran out ?
did you find it in a flash ?
the two hunred thirty yen one +...
you buy three of them and +...
three ?
then how much does it become ?
six hundred ninety yen .
six hundred ninety yen .
and what about this side ?
seven .
when you buy seven ?
two thousand ninety yen .
wait a minute .
if you buy seven, if you buy seven two hundred yen ones how much does it become ?
one thousand four hundred yen .
one thousand four hundred yen .
okay .
how much is it +...
if you add it ?
two thousand and seventy yen .
two thousand +...
oh .
two thousand ninety yen .
ninety yen .
okay .
that's what it's about .
so that means if you buy three two hundred thirty yen cakes and seven two hundred yen cakes .
then it becomes two thousand ninety yen .
you get ten yen in change .
that's why you could buy three of these .
and as for this, if you buy seven then +...
with two thousand one hundred yen there is only ten yen left .
and with only ten yen you can't buy anything, so it's this .
you could find an answer +...
that it was this .
what about yours, Joji ?
I'm not done yet .
are you in the middle of it ?
he's in the middle of doing it .
what about yours, Arai ?
what ?
I'm still doing it .
still doing it .
as for Arai, he couldn't print out what was in the hard drive in his head, right ?
okay .
that's what it's about .
this +...
then something else +...
students who say +"/.
I did this .
Kamon and Luiko and who else ?
other people .
no one ?
what's yours, Kamon ?
how do you +...
work it out ?
what did you set up ?
huh ?
how did you do it ?
your method ?
inequality equation .
you set up an inequality equation .
okay, what about Luiko's ?
inequality equation .
you set up an inequality equation ?
then what about other people ?
isn't there anyone ?
no one ?
then the other people can't buy them .
you know, the cakes, counting them one by one is a really ordinary way of doing it, you know .
isn't there anyone else ?
maruya's was also an inequality equation, right ?
we'll get to you later, so wait a little, okay ?
other people .
how did you do yours, Bancho ?
huh ?
yeah .
you wrote multiply by something, multiply by something, right ?
how did you do that ?
the same as that .
it's the same as this, right ?
and then who else was it now ?
nagase's one also used a ratio, right ?
is it the same as this ?
it's different ?
what is it ?
huh ?
inequality equation .
inequality equation ?
okay .
then +...
are there others ?
who used a completely different way of thinking ?
no ?
then +...
I've thought about it, too, so +...
what do you think about this way of thinking ?
do you all understand it ?
you bought +...
ten +...
two hundred and thirty yen cakes .
you're told to buy a lot and so in reality you want to buy all two hundred and thirty yen cakes, right ?
then how much money is needed ?
0 .
two thousand three +...
in reality two thousand three hundred yen is required, right ?
but you're short two hundred yen .
you are short +...
two hundred yen .
you're short .
you thought +...
that you would buy a cake that is +...
thirty yen cheaper than +...
the two hundred and thirty yen cake .
0 .
buy a cake that is thirty yen cheaper and +...
you buy a cheap cake and +...
replace this needed two hundred yen for a cake that is thirty yen cheaper, okay ?
0 .
you're short two hundred yen, you know .
but, let's buy them a cake that's not two hundred thirty yen but a cake +...
that is thirty yen cheaper .
then thirty yen is going to be saved .
with each, thirty yen is going to be saved .
how many cakes that are thirty yen cheaper do you need to buy in order to make up the two hundred and ten yen shortage ?
this is the needed part .
how many cakes that are thirty yen cheaper do you need to buy to make up the two hundred and ten yen shortage ?
can you make up the two hundred ten yen ?
seven .
yeah .
if you buy six, six times three is one hundred and eighty yen, so you are still twenty yen in the red, right ?
however +...
if you buy seven of these +...
if you buy seven +...
you will have two hundred and ten yen left over, right ?
the money, right ?
0 .
that two hunred and ten yen is applied to this two hundred yen, you know .
then if you buy seven of the cakes that are thirty yen cheaper, if you do that, then what about this side ?
three .
it's three +...
did anyone do it like that ?
someone who did it like this ?
there probably isn't anyone, right ?
start off by buying ten .
you're short two hundred yen so +...
let's make up for the missing cost with cake that is thirty yen cheaper .
you can make up for it if you buy seven, so this is three .
in that way .
it was good, right ?
then I'll ask you .
okay +...
luiko .
then how did you think +...
about this one ?
the total two hundred thirty yen, oh +...
it's for some amount and make that amount X and +...
you need to buy ten of the two hundred yen ones .
so ten +...
make it ten minus X and +...
and the total has some amount of two two hundred thirty yen ones .
and the two hundred thirty yen ones are two hundred thirty X .
and +...
the two hundred yen one is two hundred +...
bracket ten minus X +...
and then +...
then +...
two hundred two hundred thirty x plus two hundred bracket ten minus X +...
is less than, minus, less than or equal to two thousand one hundred yen .
and you form the inequality equation .
okay .
you said that this was the inequality equation, right ?
okay .
did you understand the meaning ?
perfect .
you'll get it better with Luiko's explanation than with mine .
okay .
try and raise your hands .
people who say that they got it with Luiko's explanation .
one person ?
only Maruya ?
two people ?
three people ?
four people ?
just four people is it ?
five people ?
okay .
then +...
please explain it next, Ryo .
please explain it in a way that is a little more understandable .
try and explain it in a way in which +...
a few more people will say +...
that they understood .
the method of explanation is okay with this .
okay .
go ahead .
okay .
go ahead .
you can't do it ?
you don't know ?
okay .
then +...
I'll start talking from this point okay ?
to tell you the truth I was going to talk about today, what Luiko set up .
but I wanted you to find a number +...
of ways to come up with it so +...
I did it so that I would have you think about it, right ?
three, four, five, six .
okay .
one, two, three, four, five, six .
okay .
one, two, three, four, five, six .
oh, it's not five, six +...
there's five people here .
one, two, three, four, five, six .
here .
okay .
from there, and so +...
while talking so that everyone will say +"/.
+" I see .
while understanding Luiko's explanation .
we are going to try and do it using that problem, using an inequality equation problem, okay ?
you want to buy a total of ten cakes in which one is two hundred yen and the other is two hundred thirty yen .
and you want to make the total less than two thousand one hundred yen .
in order to buy as many two hundred thirty yen cakes as possible, what is the maximum that you can buy ?
that is the problem .
and what is the thing that you want to find ?
pinko ?
what do you need to answer ?
how many two hundred thirty yen cakes you buy .
it's a problem asking how many two hundred thirty yen cakes you can buy, so +...
so that's why you're going to think of it as changing the two hundred thirty yen cake into X .
I'm asking how many can you buy, so you should think of changing the two hundred thirty yen cake into X .
0 .
when doing that +...
you need to buy ten cakes all together .
you need to buy ten .
right ?
then, Qumi ?
if it's six of this cake, then +...
how many of this cake do you need to buy ?
four .
four .
how did you calculate it ?
what ?
four .
so how do you calculate it ?
how do you know that this is four ?
what ?
because it's not enough .
yeah, so how do you calculate it ?
what's the equation here ?
huh ?
add .
what do you add to six to get this ten ?
then +...
then how many is it here ?
x .
what ?
that's why you're in trouble if you are fooled by the number here .
if this is six then it's probably how many here, Ryusaki ?
qumi is saying that it's four, but how do you get this here ?
it's four, but how do you come up with four ?
ryusaki, how do you come up with four here ?
subtract .
you need to subtract, right ?
it's good if ten minus six is four here .
if it was seven here, then you would write ten minus seven, right ?
if this were nine here then you would think of this as ten minus nine .
so if you subtract one of the numbers from this number, from the total number, then you get the remaining number .
and the problem is, if you make the number on this side X, then what will this be if you do that ?
here .
joji .
what will this become ?
here .
you haven't been listening, have you .
if this were three, then this can be found by going ten minus three .
if this were four, then this is ten minus four .
if this is five, then this is ten minus five .
then if this is X, then what is this ?
ten minus X .
yeah .
it'll become ten minus X .
what this is saying is that you can only buy ten minus X number of the two hundred yen cakes .
it will come up here .
it's ten altogether and if you make this X, then here +...
you need to subtract this number .
if you subtract this number from ten then you'll always arrive at the number left over .
that's why it'll be the case that you can buy this many two hundred yen cakes .
the amount you bought, right ?
this will be the amount here .
if you do that, what would the cost be if you bought only X number of two hundred thirty yen cakes ?
if you multiply the two hundred thirty yen cakes at this price by X then you'll get the total cost, right ?
it's two hundred thirty X, you know .
because you're only going to buy ten minus X of the two hundred yen cakes, the cost will be this .
then since you only have two thousand one hundred yen with you, you'll be in trouble +...
if it isn't less than this .
and so you will get this equation, okay ?
what is the equation ?
oh, I can't write it, can I ?
I'm wondering what the equation is so +...
the equation is two hundred thirty X plus two hundred bracket ten minus X is less than or equal to +...
0 .
two thousand one hundred .
okay, then let's try and solve this, okay ?
okay, the two hundred thirty of this two hundred thirty X stays the same .
okay, Sakai, here when you take the parentheses off ?
huh ?
I took the brackets off now, so here .
multiply this and this .
mm ?
how much is it when you multiply it ?
how much is it if you take off the brackets ?
well then how do you do two bracket X plus three ?
two X .
well then remove the brackets .
I did it .
I did it .
four plus five .
you multiply it, right ?
huh ?
bracket +...
two hundred times ten is see +...
two thousand .
oh, two thousand, right ?
two thousand .
okay .
two thousand +...
minus, you multiply this so +...
this time on this side so okay .
two hundred X .
two, two hundred X .
okay .
less than or equal to two thousand one hundred .
okay .
then which is the next one that you transpose ?
two thousand .
two thousand .
okay .
we're going to bring the plus two thousand to the other side .
and two hundred thirty X minus two hundred X is less than or equal to two thousand one hundred minus two thousand .
the sign changes, so please be careful, okay ?
when you transpose it, okay ?
then thirty X +...
thirty x is less than or equal to +...
one hundred .
okay .
then you're going to divide both by thiry on both sides, so it becomes X is less than equal to +...
one hundred +...
thirtieths but +...
I'll erase the zero here, okay ?
it'll become ten +/.
thirds .
thirds .
what will ten become if you write it in decimals ?
three point three three three three three, right ?
if I asked you to find the largest integer +...
that is smaller than three point three +...
it will come out as three .
I can't really write the answer, but okay +...
you can buy three +...
up to three +...
of the two hundred thirty yen +...
thirty yen +...
cakes .
if you present it +...
like this +...
it's good .
things presented like this are solved using an inequality equation .
0 .
which is easier, doing it one by one or using an inequality equation ?
an inequality equation .
it's easier to use the inequality equation, isn't it ?
and so today what I would like you to do from here is, we already did this in the method of thinking but +...
inequality equation .
I would like you +...
to know +...
the good qualities of +...
finding the answer by +...
setting up an +...
inequality equation .
right +...
inequality equation so +...
we thought about it +...
with a problem like this .
0 .
if you were to solve it without using an inequality equation you need to check it out quite a lot, one by one, a lot .
Hara could solve it because it was ten, but what if you were to buy one hundred of these two cakes together +...
ninety figure out one hundred, and figure out ninety nine, and figure out ninety eight, and figure out ninety seven, and +...
you need to figure out all of the numbers between one and one hundred, don't you ?
however, if you used a method like this that Luiko used +...
you will arrive at the answer quickly .
therefore, you don't need to figure out each number one by one .
so working it out by making +...
an inequality equation has a lot more +...
good qualities +...
than counting it one by one .
that's what it's about, all right ?
so then and so +...
if there are good qualities like that then +...
we're saying that .
so there are two problems on the right side .
this time, please buy twenty apples and oranges altogether .
if you count it one by one you will be in an incredibly terrible situation .
as we just did in the cake situation, set up an inequality equation by yourself and find out up to how many apples you can buy .
or if you're doing the problem at the bottom, try to solve the problem about .
how many pears you can buy by setting up an inequality equation .
work it out and find an answer .
because finding the answers one by one is hard +...
I wonder if you see the numerous good points of setting up inequality equations .
and, well, that you'll set up inequality equations yourself and try to find the solutions .
that's what it's all about, okay ?
is it okay ?
okay .
then and so +...
people who haven't written this here, write it, and then do problem one .
try to set up an inequality equation by yourself in the same way and try to solve the problem .
okay .
go ahead .
this is +...
the total so +...
you don't have it +...
see ?
this is attached .
it's faster than counting, right ?
it's okay .
now, work out the problem .
this expresses this in the same way as this .
oh, solve this on the top .
that's good .
it's like this, you know .
twelve times .
not twelve, it's seventy times twenty, you know .
this is twenty, isn't it ?
it's a bracket so, okay ?
it's not a twelve, you know .
I got it .
twenty .
you couldn't read the numbers that you wrote, could you ?
it's okay, Tanizaki, here .
try this and work it out like this .
sakai's one is also good, isn't it ?
okay, you've got it .
then now it's easy, right ?
it's easy, right ?
this isn't X here, but +...
you're going to buy twenty in all, right ?
so here you will get the number you subtracted +...
from the total amount of twenty .
and so twenty minus +...
negative X .
and so the price here +...
you multiply the price of one of them, and this amount, so this becomes one hundred and twenty X .
okay ?
and what about this one ?
it becomes seventy parentheses .
you can't write it +...
if it's like that .
please write the seventy sort of more on the side .
and what about here ?
twenty minus X .
okay .
now you've got it .
and then put these together and make this smaller than four .
what about you, Uchida ?
huh ?
two hundred .
just a moment .
it's all right now, right ?
oh, Ueda, that's good .
okay, it's done .
oh, Ueda, yours is good, too .
you've arrived at the answer, right ?
okay .
where'd it go, Waka ?
this is okay, you know ?
this is +...
one hundred and twenty x@l plus, how much is this if you multiply it by this ?
two times seven, fourteen, right ?
one thousand four hundred seventy two thousand .
this is four .
then you have to transpose it .
there is seven, seven hundred .
twent(y) this is seventy times twenty, so next is four, right ?
okay .
0 .
0 .
0 .
okay, I guess I'll have you write it .
are you done ?
did you do it ?
0 .
then work it out there +...
will you ?
this should be fine, right ?
0 .
could you write it ?
isn't it good ?
it's good .
divide, you can divide it .
then +...
bancho .
please write number two, okay ?
look at the figure and set up an equation and work it out, okay ?
what number ?
number two .
number two ?
yeah .
write it without looking at anything, okay ?
because I wrote wrote that you would buy fifteen .
mm, I just saw someone's eyes .
okay, Watabe .
uh, wait a second .
watabe, please write number one, okay ?
okay, go ahead .
you don't understand if you don't look at anything .
it's not written .
this is going to appear in the equation .
oh, how much is it for the baskets ?
oh yeah, I didn't write the basket prices .
sorry .
the basket price is +...
eighty yen, isn't it ?
eighty yen .
the total +...
was one thousand yen, wasn't it ?
hm ?
oh .
I should write the totals, too, shouldn't I ?
the total, sorry .
less than one thousand yen .
watabe's is less than two thousand yen .
two thousand ?
please write two thousand yen here .
oh, okay .
try hard and work it out .
just one more step, just the answer .
oh, you need to display the answer .
eight ?
it's wrong ?
what ?
what is this ?
what ?
it's wrong .
this, the answer of this inequality equation is wrong, isn't it ?
isn't it okay ?
because +...
this is ten, right ?
is this +...
the answer ?
with eighty ?
it's this value here .
two times nine ?
what about eight ?
seven hundred fifty .
aren't you missing the fifty here ?
oh +...
the response is okay with this .
the answer is not this though, is it ?
huh ?
the answer is +...
what is the answer ?
is it this ?
this is good .
this is the answer to the inequality equation .
but, the answer to the problem has to be this, right ?
when asked to work out this inequality problem, this is this has to be the answer here, right ?
however, this won't be the answer to the applied problem so +/.
one hundred seventy over twenty .
+, seventeen over two, right ?
so teacher, if you do it like this, is it correct ?
that should be that way, right ?
okay .
ueda, how far did you go ?
fifty times fifteen is look +...
not yet ?
it's seventy five, you know .
then it becomes seven hundred and fifty .
for example, how do we write the answer ?
what are you going to write ?
the problem asks up to how many can you buy .
what ?
pears, right ?
up to how many pears can you buy ?
it's seventy times twenty, so it's not one hundred and forty, but it's only one zero, right ?
who can read this ?
who can't read this ?
there the six is +...
sixty +...
you're missing one zero, aren't you ?
okay +...
that's what it's about .
please look at number one first .
if you say that you will buy only X one hundred and twenty yen apples then +...
you're going to buy a total of twenty .
so, as for the tangerines, you need to buy only the total twenty minus X tangerines .
and the price of the apples is one hundred and twenty X .
and the price of the tangerines is seventy parentheses twenty minus X .
and the total that you have is two thousand yen, you know .
so you're asked to make it less than two thousand yen so +...
one hundred twenty X plus seventy, parentheses twenty, minus X, is less than or equal to two thousand .
and if you try to find the answer you get X is less than or equal to twelve .
that's why you can buy up to twelve apples .
we're going to try to see if this is true or not, okay ?
you buy twelve one hundred and twenty yen apples .
then what is the cost ?
is there anyone who knows what is twelve times twelve ?
didn't I teach this to you before ?
one hundred forty four .
it's one hundred and forty four, right ?
okay .
one thousand four hundred forty yen .
this is the price of the apples .
then, you need to buy eight of the seventy yen tangerines so seven times eight, fifty six .
and all together it's exactly two thousand yen .
about it being exactly two thousand yen, why did it become exactly two thousand yen here ?
since it's divisible .
because here we got twelve, a number that was divisible, right ?
right .
we got it because the twelve could be divided perfectly into it here, right ?
that's why it ended up being exactly two thousand yen .
however, this side .
okay .
you find it in the same way .
the pears are X and you're going to buy fifteen, so the persimmons are fifteen minus X .
the price of the pears and the price of the persimmons +...
and even the basket will be included as well this time, right ?
it's asking you to limit it to one thousand yen all together .
so, if you set up an inequality equation you get this kind of equation .
seventy X plus fifty, parentheses fifteen, minus X, plus eighty, is less than or equal to one thousand .
please work this out .
this is the answer of the inequality equation, okay ?
you need to present this, okay ?
instead of just suddenly writing the answer eight if you first work this out +...
you get an answer of seventeen halves, okay ?
you need to find this first .
now you need to pinpoint it like this .
then +...
if you buy eight seventy yen pears, then seven times eight equals five hundred and sixty yen .
if you do that, then how many fifty yen persimmons do you buy ?
you buy seven ?
then seven times five equals three hundred and fifty yen .
all together +...
nine hundred and ten yen .
then +...
you'll have ninety yen in change coming back .
what ?
the basket price .
oh, there's the price of the basket .
the basket price is eighty yen so +...
it's altogether nine hundred and ninety yen, and you'll only get ten yen in change .
that's what it's about .
what we talked about today was +...
the answer from inequality equations +...
that is +...
when solving problems it's often easier to set up an inequality equation and find the answer .
than count things one by one and find the number .
that's why although it may be tedious +...
for the applied problems of inequality equations, okay ?
instead of looking for the answer one by one you find it by changing the parts written in Japanese to mathematical terms and solving it .
because an inequality equation has a good quality like this .
this is what we talked about .
is it okay ?
is it okay ?
yes, okay .
then I'll pass out the problems and finish off .
what number should I pass out, today ?
is it number nine ?
it's number nine .
number ten .
then I'll hand out the problems for number ten and finish .
from what number to what number are there ?
it ends with ten .
inequality equations end with this .
one, two, okay .
four more .
four more ?
okay .
one, two, three, four, okay .
one, two, three, four, five, okay .
one, two, three, four, five, six, okay .
okay .
okay .
then we'll say our greetings and finish off .
student officer .
lead with strong voices since we're finished .
please get ready to bow .
stand .
thank you very much .
thank you very much
