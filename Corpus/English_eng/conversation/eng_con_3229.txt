so we don't really want to know about the interior ones . 0_3211
now do you remember how to measure the angle ? 3211_4550
xxx . 4550_11088
that should be &~o that should be okay . 11088_12511
remember +... 12511_26910
click somewhere to get rid of the other selection and then go that, that, that +... 26910_35380
do you remember how to measure the angles ? 35380_38488
yeah . 38488_38941
good . 38941_39560
after you've got something good like a, uh, a diagram with a pentagon and and maybe a formula even, you might probably save that . 39560_54313
just +... 54313_54641
it's a good idea to save things . 54641_57241
call it Exterior_Angle_Pentagon . 57241_64623
so then if you do some other exterior angles, you can give it similar names . 64623_69656
okay . 69656_75398
so did they change ? 75398_76386
yeah, but xxx . 76386_78840
okay . 78840_79183
what about if you make it concave ? 79183_81358
it does but xxx . 81358_83541
yeah . 83541_84475
once it's concave it doesn't stay yep . 84475_87495
point two ? 87495_94625
xxx it's weird if you move these two, it seems to xxx . 94625_103216
hmm, let's just show all the labels . 103216_111320
a@l b@l c@l d@l e@l, a@l b@l c@l You've got angle d@l h@l d@l which is yeah 'cause you've actually measured angle d@l h@l e@l, which is that angle over there . 111320_130351
that's 'cause we drew the middle one in first . 130321_131186
oh . 131186_131675
you've got to go like that . 131675_133495
you can easily check up by the vertices 'cause you should have angles a@l b@l c@l d@l e@l look in the middle . 133495_138488
a@l b@l c@l h@l . 138488_141183
so that one there needs to be changed . 141183_143650
but it'll mean you have to change your formula as well . 143650_145811
xxx . 145811_150713
it's easier to understand sir it came out for us . 150713_159081
um, how did you do it the other day when you just clicked one of the things and it xxx . 159081_164781
okay you think yeah, you've got to go back one stage +... 164781_167965
because you have to select the measurements you want for your formula before you do it . 167965_175448
now when you go to calculate you can say +... 175448_178011
oh . 178011_178951
that angle plus the second one plus and so on . 178951_183291
oh, I didn't do that . 183291_184180
thank you . 184180_184880
I just pressed the thingy . 184880_186346
xxx . 186346_202545
yes . 202545_203010
excellent idea . 203010_204088
does it matter if it goes through the rays ? 204088_207120
no, you've got room in the corner there to write it . 207120_210313
do you remember how to do that ? 210313_213745
I think you have to select the little the little hand . 213745_221393
and then do what you just did . 221393_222953
yeah . 222953_228165
now you can write . 228165_229180
now . 229180_245113
let me see +... 245113_247881
you should have in the outbox xxx and look in the middle xxx You've got one with Jack . 247881_259781
oh, we missed that one . 259781_261556
yeah . 261556_262118
you yeah . 262118_262755
so +... 262755_264650
yeah you want that one, which means you're going to have to change the formula as well . 264650_267656
oh, triangles, too . 267656_279951
yep . 279951_281143
have you saved what you've been doing ? 281143_282743
that's good . 282743_283375
people, can you just turn around and face me for a moment please . 283375_292780
uh, you most people are getting to have the formula . 292780_297778
and in most cases you're finding a reasonable looking result . 297778_301481
if you get something that looks a bit strange it could well be that you haven't measured exactly the right angles, and I'll help you check that . 301481_308596
once you've got a conclusion from your formula, then you can write about it somewhere on that, um, sheet . 308596_317830
if you haven't got up to finding out how to do a text box yet, just ask me . 317830_321850
uh, and I'll show you how to do that . 321850_323713
okay ? 323713_325428
sir xxx . 325428_334413
well, which polygons have you tried so far ? 334413_341841
um +... 341841_343478
you've only tried a pentagon . 343478_345496
okay . 345496_346376
okay . 346376_346876
so +... 346876_347908
if it said what is the sum the measure is just the size, really . 347908_353098
which is what you found . 353098_354388
so it's just the sum of the angles, really . 354388_356565
exterior angles . 356565_357593
now for the pentagon it turned out to be three hundred and sixty degrees . 357593_361076
now they're asking you assuming you've also done triangles, quadrilaterals, hexagons and so on . 361076_366841
now what's your conclusion ? 366841_368840
does the total go up perhaps as you add to the number of sides, or what happens ? 368840_373283
that's, that's what it's asking you to, to write down about . 373283_375778
um, what did you do there ? 375778_381978
the sides . 381978_383456
well can you do it again ? 383456_384078
um +... 384078_385210
xxx . 385210_391780
ah . 391780_392208
the top of it is slightly off the screen because you haven't got your, um, your thing . 392208_398820
how xxx down ? 398820_402563
it should, it should work if you drag the edge of it . 402563_404206
and that should just make it nicely fill up the screen if you could click on that . 404206_409995
okay . 409995_411711
now you going to write something about it then ? 411711_413620
yeah . 413620_414211
do you know how to do that ? 414211_414765
xxx . 414765_415890
mister +... 415890_418045
xxx when it says um, this is xxx try one ? 418045_438608
uh, yes, I think so . 438608_440311
now, your conclusion says when you move the parts of the pentagon, the sum of the angles does not change . 440311_449476
exterior angles . 449476_450223
okay so exterior angles would be a good thing to add in there . 450223_453881
and one other, one other fairly important fact that you could mention +... 453881_460286
but just think about it . 460286_463760
we haven't finished it yet . 463760_464106
we haven't finished it yet because we xxx change it, um, we have to summarize what a pentagon is . 464106_467961
yeah . 467961_468345
okay but just think about when you say it does not change, what doesn't it change from ? 468345_473423
oh, yeah . 473423_474416
how do I make a text box ? 474416_483926
text box . 483926_485555
use this little thing . 485555_487496
and you just drag it where you want the box . 487496_491848
and then you get a usual sort of insertion point you can start typing . 491848_496778
now +... 496778_522391
if you look at that angle there . 522391_525786
is that angle i@l b@l c@l ? 525786_527995
is that what it says ? 527995_529916
yeah . 529916_530525
okay . 530525_531091
now if we trace angle i@l b@l c@l, it goes from there to there, to there . 531091_538780
now, is that one of the exterior angles of the polygon ? 538780_543130
in fact what would you really call it ? 543130_549141
interior . 549141_550251
interior angle . 550251_551186
are all the other ones the same ? 551186_553811
yeah they all look like that too . 553811_556476
yeah so +... 556476_557456
