okay so &-um so I'm sorry I I &~ha I my voice &-uh doesn't sound &-uh &-uh as good as it should be but &-um yeah the last week I had a crew from Japan who &-uh videotape various part of the &~on and off+campus &-um about the child care resource in Ann Arbor this is something I report I made a report last year . 27305_57285
&-um based on a request from the &-uh government &-um a section of the government in Japan and the child care issue I mean I went through as a a parent . 64145_76545
but it's not my expertise . 76925_79045
and I try to resign . 79605_81485

on top of it they asked me to interview various people and outdoor and I said you don't understand Michigan's winter . 122835_133515
I do not want to go outdoor . 133975_135675
and the interviewees &=laughs:multiple the our dean Ada Sue was also included as a one of the &~inter yeah interviewee . 135915_146255
so I said if you ask my dean to go out_of &=laughs:S1 building I will never speak speak to you again so they they gave up interviewing dean outdoor but the rest of the section hasta be done outdoor and then look this is the consequence I got cold . 147165_167905

&-uh good morning everybody my presentation today is on the +//. 304475_313595
I have done my research concept on autonomy and hospital organizations . 314035_317815
(0.6) I need extra time for ⌈ this ⌉ . 319155_324755
⌊ <you wanna just hit> down arrow ⌋ . 324915_325395

oh sorry . 326495_326875
that will be much easier . 327255_327975
okay thank you . 328535_330155
I start with a rhetorical question is nursing a profession ? 331035_333635
&-uh perhaps not yet but it is moving in that direction . 334835_337835
&-uh there's actual &-uh lack of consensus as to whether or not nursing is a profession although I know I won't find any argument in this room . 338655_344235
&=laughs:multiple the lack of consensus as to the components of professional practice is part of the problem . 344775_349075
and it may be contributing to the inability to adequately measure it . 349755_352815
there's two pivotal concepts that I'm going to examine today that is autonomy and the hospital environment . 353205_358645
autonomy because it is found to be a characteristic of the profession and the hospital environment because it is the environment in which nursing is most often practiced . 359585_367845
autonomy is the characteristic which consistently arises in the literature as being fundamental to the status of the profession over and over again in the literature you hear mention of the characteristic of autonomy . 369105_379265
professional nurse autonomy leads to empowerment of the self and others and it may even influence one's ability to change the work environment . 379925_387485
this was the piece that most &~magnifi &-uh that most &-uh &-um that captured my attention the greatest . 387865_393625
if the work environment is unconducive to nursing practice perhaps by &-uh getting a more autonomous practice then that environment can be changed . 394505_402425
and more professionalized . 402805_403845
patient care suffers and outcomes are adversely affected by a move away from nursing professionalism so there is even then a greater impetus for us to focus on professional nursing practice and autonomy . 404635_415255
by measuring the degree of autonomy practicing nurses possess that is an imforportant first step in determining how professional that practice is . 416195_423535
definitions of autonomy vary and I just wanna share a few of them with you Ballou in nineteen ninety eight did a concept analysis of autonomy and she defined it as the capacity of an agent to determine its own actions through independent choice within a system of principles and laws to which the agent is dedicated . 424655_441175
major indicators that we can derive from this definition are the concept of self-determination &~indepense independence and the principles and laws of the &~di discipline itself . 441975_453575
Wade also did a concept analysis of autonomy and she described it as a belief in the centrality of the client . 454655_461215
when making responsible discretionary decisions both independently and interdependently that reflect advocacy for the client . 461855_469635
a little different definition . 470475_471475
here the major indicators are a client around whom decisions are made the idea of interdependence and advocacy . 472515_480395
here's yet a third definition of autonomy this one a little older back from nineteen eighty eight here autonomy is defined as the practice of one's occupation in accordance with one's education with members of that occupation governing defining and controlling their own activities in the absence of external controls . 482365_501085
this definition has its its has as its indicators a practice base education self-governance and lack of external control . 502315_510595
and in trying to decide which definition I should use going back to this one the capacity of an agent speaks more to a potentiality . 510895_520035
when we say that there's a capacity to autonomy then we're saying that it's there's a potential for autonomy . 520175_524775
it doesn't speak of the actual characteristic . 524935_527395
this definition in &~de in &~de focusing on belief &-uh has more of of a a philosophical conceptualization again it doesn't speak to the actual activity of autonomy . 528055_539155
therefore I am deciding to use in my presentation Schutzenhofer's definition because it speaks to the practice of autonomy . 539635_546235
the behavioral aspects of autonomy . 546655_548255
and for measurement purposes this is most important because you can actually observe it and measure it . 548915_553315
based on Schutzenhofer's definition she actually devised a tool known as the Nurse Activity Scale this tool she conceptualized from a female perspective acknowledging both woman subjugation in society at large as_well_as the forces within nursing which tend to limit autonomy . 554925_570165
because it is conceptualized in such a base this &-uh &-um tool had inherent &-uh appeal to me because the vast majority of nurses are still women and in our society we still have pockets where women are subjugated . 570505_584925
the NAS as it's known in its short form consists of a thirty item self-report scale the respondents use a four point Likert type scale to indicate the likelihood of their carrying out the actions described in the items in the instrument so again it's based in behavior . 586095_600775
examples &-uh I've got for you two examples of &-uh items from the scale one is institute nursing rounds and another example is consult with other nurses when the patient is not responding to the plan of care . 601875_613055
scoring of the NAS all thirty items are weighted a score of one represents low autonomy a score of three would represent high autonomy so there's some variability then in the score which &-uh a respondent can receive . 614735_627175
the scores range from sixty to two hundred and forty and they're based on the sum of weighted scores . 627715_631935
what I like about that aspect of it is that the allocation of weights preserves a variability and the behavioral expression of autonomy . 633035_639635
it's not an all or nothing phenomenon it's not that we're autonomous or we're not there's varying degrees of autonomy and this is the one scale that captured that essence and that really appealed to me . 640085_648525
reliability of the scale it also consists of five nonscored items which the author says serve as a measure of internal consistency . 649865_656825
Kronbach's alpha from the scale ranges from &-uh point eight one to point nine two in various experiments in which it's been used test retest reliability has a score of point seven nine which are all very good . 658045_668585
the &~i &-uh interrater reliability of the three categories of low medium and high autonomy were done and these resulted in alphas of point eight or higher . 670105_678905
validity of the NAS &-uh consists of a few &-uh &-uh measures consultation with nursing experts in a large metropolitan area were undertaken for the initial item generation she also did a literature search for various examples of autonomous behavior both in the nursing and the nonnursing literature . 680275_697835
and again that appealed to me because it wasn't strictly a nursing &-uh concept that she was examining . 698455_703435
&-uh in_order_to get content validity she surveyed five hundred nurses and ended up with an R of point nine two no construct or criterion related validity &~we were assessed . 703975_714115
other autonomy tools in the literature &-uh the oldest one and the one that is used perhaps the most often in the literature before the nineteen nineties was the Pankrantz and Pankrantz scale . 715695_725335
&-uh it has a few drawbacks in that it measures other concepts besides autonomy none of the items are weighted thereby &~lim oversimplifying the measurement in my view . 725925_734765
it contains several ambiguous items and the expertise of the persons developing the items was never reported so we can never truly assess whether or not they were &-uh &-um &-uh experts who &-uh validated it . 735645_747705
another autonomy tool is the nursing care role orientation scale this scale has its underpinnings in role socialization literature there's a whole big &-uh literature out there that says that the roles that we develop depend &-uh determine our level of professionalism or our level of autonomy so it's that role socialization piece . 748335_766655
this tool unfortunately was developed from only one specific graduate curriculum . 767615_771175
and therefore it has a_lot_of program bias and it limits its usefulness to practicing nurses because it's based on &-uh students . 771645_778165
for its development . 779805_780405
&-uh this tool is in its early developmental stage and the author herself admits that item revisions are necessary therefore it would not be wise to use this tool in its present form . 781205_789985
another tool is the nursing role conception scale this tool also has its underpinnings in role socialization literature it was developed by Corwin I believe back in the sixties . 790735_800555
and was modified by Lawler in the nineteen eighties . 800955_803435
&-uh the original instrument that Corwin developed measured role in terms of three commitment to three areas the nurse's commitment to the organization her commitment to the profession and her commitment to the patient . 803575_813735
&-uh Lawler took that and took the professional subscale only and turned that into an instrument all on its own and this was &-uh developed into a fourteen item scale . 815215_824715
(0.5) criteria for the evaluation of the NAS since that is one that &-uh I have focused on the other tools I think I've &-uh given you enough examples of why I did not think that they were &-uh appropriate for evaluating the concept of autonomy however that NAS scale does have clarity the definition indicators and operations are all clearly understood . 829595_847635
the tool has precision in that the instructions to use it are clear and explicit it has adequate reliability it has adequate consistency because the linkages between the concept and the empirical reality are explained . 848335_859895
I believe that the tool has adequate meaning because the items cover all aspects of autonomy . 860635_865095
it's very feasible . 866375_867095
it's a short and simple self-report scale &-um quick and easy to do &-uh at the hospital where you +//. 867375_873895
I I'm thinking of myself what could I use this tool going into the hospital and asking various nurses . 874235_878375
I could do it it's easy quick wouldn't &-uh take them long wouldn't take them away from their &-uh jobs . 878615_884115
the tool has great utility it's &-uh &~o &~di of use to the discipline of nursing to understand nurse autonomy and obviously by extension to patient outcomes as well because once again patient outcomes if nursing exhibit more autonomy patient outcomes do improve . 885155_899675
the tool has good content validity and it's being used in &-uh other research studies so this ongoing use in research &-uh indicates that validity assessment is also ongoing . 900435_910255
and the tool has adequate consensus it was reported in a a nineteen ninety nine article as &-uh a measure of &~autonom &~th &~m autonomy that is appropriate to use . 911215_919715
and that's why I used the NAS to measure autonomy . 920815_923075
turning then to my other concept under investigation the hospital organization . 923895_928035
most nurses are employed by some type of organization whether that's a hospital or a school or a a private practice it it &~w nurses work in organizations even here in the university setting . 929045_941705
the environment in which nurses practice has a significant impact on professionalism that comes from from Kotecki and just to share with you I don't know how many of you are aware that part of her resech research interest lies in the issue of nursing professionalism . 942965_954465
&-uh nurses &-uh &-um the the environment is what shapes our practice . 956345_960545
and the environment is what shapes our behavior . 960765_962505
and I think this inherently makes sense if you just take a minute to think about it not only in our professional lives but even in our personal lives . 963205_969745
those of us that live in big cities tend to behave in different ways than those of us who live in smaller towns or even in rural areas . 970225_976145
so this is something &~i that carries over then into nursing . 976365_979245
some organizations support more professional practice than others . 980045_983845
however many nurses do not have the autonomy and influence necessary to carry out their professional responsibilities . 985545_991285
there was a research study done &-uh between hospital based nurses doctor office based nurses and nurses in the community and which of those three group of nurses do you think exhibited the most autonomy ? 991945_1002125
community +/. 1002845_1003425
+, community health nurses yes and also that's because part of the environment in which they practice they have that &-uh environmental looseness if you will which permits them to practice more autonomously . 1003545_1012565
organizations which support autonomous practice must be identified so there is a link then between those two concepts however first we have to measure organizational traits which support autonomy in nursing practice . 1013545_1025025
nurses value certain characteristics which they think must be present in their environment these are characteristics associated with professional practice and as a as an example I've got there for you the chance to participate in decisions for example if you've got that ability in your organization that's a valued characteristic . 1027795_1045795
other valued characteristics for nurses who practice in hospitals include adequate staffing levels flexible scheduling strong supportive and visible managers recognition for excellence in practice and opportunities for professional development . 1046285_1060605
magnet hospitals are special hospitals because they are magnetic for keeping nurses in local in times of local labor shortages . 1060645_1068405
these magnet hospitals offer all of those valued nursing characteristics . 1069505_1073225
and another interesting fact is studies have been done that have shown that &-uh magnet hospitals have lower mortality rates than matched controls . 1073865_1081185
defining hospital organization this is my definition based on the &-uh literature that I &-uh &-um &~persue &~per perused . 1083425_1090865
&-uh a hospital organization provides a work environment for nurses which has the following factors . 1091285_1096705
then it has professional practice characteristics adequate staffing levels flexible scheduling strong support and visible need nursing leadership yadda@i yadda@i yadda@i . 1096745_1105185
I &-uh basically made up a definition based on all of the characteristic that nurses &-uh value . 1105765_1111025
&-um the good things about this definition is that it's long and it covers all the bases . 1111785_1116045
&-uh it has many many indicators . 1116765_1118425
unfortunately all of these indicators would require even more explanation for the sake of clarity so that definition really does not cut it for my purposes . 1118395_1126615
another definition of a hospital organization comes from two authors &~back in &-uh two thousand this year actually February they wrote this piece and they say that the hospital the ideal hospital organization is one which provides an environment where the nurses control the delivery of patient care they have adequate accountability and autonomy in their environment in which they deliver care and there's adequate collaboration with physicians . 1127505_1152525
I like this definition because it has basically just three indicators . 1153275_1156715
autonomy which I'm already interested in and I'm trying to link here control over the work environment and relationships with physicians which is a very important part of of nursing practice . 1157255_1167635
although this definition addresses only three organizational attributes these organizational attributes &~butes are the ones cited in the literature as characterizing an environment supportive of professional nursing practice . 1168755_1181255
the tool now that &-uh &~i is is based on this well not &-uh one of the tools that &-uh comes from this definition then is the Nursing Work Index it is developed by Kramer and Hafner back in nineteen eighty nine this tool measures nurses' job satisfaction and perception of quality of care . 1183655_1199855
this tool measures nurses' attributes not hospitals' attributes so for my purposes that doesn't quite cut it I'm interested in measuring hospital traits so this tool doesn't do it and the unit of measurement is the nurse not the hospital . 1200545_1212825
so again for my purposes this isn't &-uh adequate . 1213685_1216005
however this tool does contain a list of sixty five organizational traits reported by magnet hospital RNs as being characteristic of a professional environment so there is something in this tool which is worth investigating further . 1216145_1229625
thank goodness I don't hafta do it because somebody else did . 1230305_1232765
and they devised the Revised Nursing Work Index . 1233285_1236025
this tool took the list from the NWI and they developed a tool to measure organizational attributes of hospitals related to professional nursing practice . 1236505_1245505
in this tool the unit of measurement is the unit &~tha the nursing unit or the hospital on a whole take your pick and it measures organizational attributes not personal attributes . 1246245_1255665
this is a fifty seven item self-report scale and again respondents indicate the degree to which they agree that the items are present in their current job . 1256675_1265115
the degree of agreement corresponds on a one to &~fo corresponds with numbers one to four on a four point Likert type scale and an example would be in my &~presen present in my current job I have the freedom to make important patient care and work decisions agree or disagree . 1265735_1280535
&-um scoring for this scale is very simple you just add up the numbers that the nurses circled to each item . 1281065_1288005
the authors say that this scale consists of four subscales there's five items on the autonomy subscale seven items on the control over practice setting subscale three items on the nurse physician relationship so those are those three major &-um indicators there's also a fourth subscale which looks at organizational support . 1289245_1307165
except that I said the scale consists of fifty seven items that only adds up to twenty five so there are thirty two additional items on this scale but there's no further subscale identified and I don't know exactly what they're trying to measure with those other thirty two items . 1307875_1322935
reliability of this scale the overall Kronbach's alpha is point nine six there are acceptable alphas &~iden &-uh for each of the identified subscales &-uh &~re representativeness she reported as a measure of reliability however no other forms of reliability were reported . 1324155_1341535
&-uh the authors say that the tools exhibits content validity they used researchers from the magnet hospitals to act as content experts however there was no R reported . 1343375_1352615
&-uh criterion related validity consisted of high correlations of the NWI with certain organizational forms . 1353755_1359635
for example there were higher NWIR scores for magnet hospitals and dedicated AIDS units which also had lower mortality and lower nurse emotional exhaustion . 1360435_1369435
construct of validity was shown by comparing magnet hospitals which were known groups and they compared them to control hospitals . 1371995_1378135
and there was a table in the article that &-uh provided the means of the scores but not the differences between the means and in our &-uh Wallace and Strickland textbook it says that it's the differences between the means which is needed to assess construct validity . 1379015_1392315
so I disagree with the authors that they were able to show construct validity other hospital organization tools out there there's a ward organizational feature scale &-uh which is developed by authors in Great Britain I believe that its usefulness may be limited for us in America because it is based on the British &-uh organizational system and their hospital system is not the same as ours . 1392735_1415435
there is another organization development tool spectrum which is used to assess the commitment of the organization &~ov commitment to the organization overall morale and job satisfaction . 1415975_1427035
however that tool is a developmental tool so you use it to assess how committed you are what the morale is how satisfied you are with the job that's not quite the the piece <I'm after> I'm after in understanding the traits in the organization which support professional practice . 1427815_1443295
and believe it or not there's no other tools out there which measure organizational traits which support professional nursing . 1444025_1449965
evaluating the NWIR then &~a against Wallace and Strickland's &-uh nine criteria for evaluation it's not really very clear &-um &~a as I was getting into it and and working I realized that +//. 1450805_1465145
am I defining hospital organization or am I trying to define traits within it ? 1465505_1469645
really in all fairness can I ask actually ask one tool to do that all ? 1470325_1474125
there's how many traits in a different organization you've got organizational culture you've got your &~hi your &-uh &-um organizational flow charts you've got the structure you've got the different groups involved perhaps I'm asking too much of one tool to measure all of it and I wasn't clear on exactly what I was measuring here . 1474325_1490965
&-uh precision the instructions for the tool itself are clear the the tool has adequate precision it's easy to fill out . 1491965_1496925
&-uh the tool exhibits adequate reliability in that internal consistency was established consistency of the tool is inadequate again because of the definitional problems that I &~un uncovered . 1497975_1507795
there's lack of linkage between the dimensions of the concept and the language means so I wasn't &-uh I I didn't establish adequate consistency there . 1508435_1515875
meaning the tool does not account for all of the various dimensions of meaning designated by the concept again hospital organization and all of its meaning these were not clearly &-uh delineated in the tool . 1516665_1528725
feasibility sure it's it's an adequate tool it's easy relatively short it's not as short to use as the NAS however fifty seven items that still doesn't take all that long utility the tool can identify desirable hospital traits but where do you go from there ? 1529965_1543805
let's be honest ladies . 1543905_1545165
I'm right on time thanks Sirirat . 1547105_1548525
&-uh let's be honest alright so we identified that in a certain hospital organization that doesn't &-uh support professional nursing practice what can we as nurses do about that ? 1549145_1557645
so &-uh whether or not it has as much utility as perhaps the other tool when I talked about autonomy &~w I'm still not quite sure on that validity . 1558005_1567505
I don't believe this tool exhibited adequate validity as I've already discussed . 1567785_1571245
consensus it has been used in multiple studies according to the authors although I didn't find any other references to it . 1572755_1578315
&-uh the authors themselves though are &-uh very prolific in their &-um production and they are using it over and over again so perhaps they themselves as they continue to use it will also continue to refine it . 1578755_1589275
conclusions I believe that I have been able to adequately operationalize the concept of autonomy and this is an important development for the discipline as I have demonstrated . 1590335_1598115
I ran into some difficulties in operationalizing hospital organization but it has been a learning &-uh experience for me in doing this exercise . 1599245_1606845
ongoing work is needed because by affecting behavior the organization can be rode autonomous and professional practice so ways hafta be found to &-um &-uh work find an organization develop an organization which &~u can offer &-uh autonomous and professional nursing practice for the good of the profession and for the good of us all . 1607665_1626025
thank you very much . 1627035_1628055
I will entertain questions (0.5) . 1628975_1630275
now Melissa you didn't include any of the &-um financial aspect of the autonomy in this &-uh picture is there a reason is there any reason ⌈ or ⌉ . 1635155_1644895
⌊ &-uh ⌋ it didn't occur to me . 1644895_1645995

well I think the financial aspect has a great impact it of the part of the &-uh it may goes under environment you know the the &-uh xxx &-uh believe that how the environment set up in terms of financial incentive and &-uh reward to be &-um autonomous . 1658175_1676935

<I have a> I have a question about that NAS scale +/. 1712915_1715555
yes .
+, it's a four point Likert scale but I &~do it's only scored from one to three ? 1716335_1720595
&-uh depending on what you &-uh circled you get a score . 1721435_1725675
for either low medium or high autonomy . 1726115_1727875
it's a weighted scale . 1728595_1730415
okay +/. 1730615_1730895
+, so say you get a four but for that item it demonstrates &-um low autonomy . 1730985_1737845

+, so I &~thou I was thinking about this in where I work and thinking that something like that might be useful because I do think administration sometimes says how can we get our nurses to think and use their heads and act more professionally but they don't really know what the answer is . 1784185_1799565

&~i it's &-um autonomy is something not just at the bedside that nurses need to go but even at our level that we need to become autonomous and &-uh this is where that policy part comes in and our political +/. 1811725_1822205

yeah as you can see yeah . 1856615_1858015
so .
it's it's also interesting that community nurses who have a high level of autonomy are also a fairly stable population of nurses . 1860565_1868245
people who go who tend to go into that stay in it until they they retire . 1868865_1871625

&~wha what I'm interested in basically is how the environment affects professionalism <I've got> I've got to get into that piece more I have to understand organizational structure organizations better . 1928845_1937865
I think that's where I need to go and to be able to say okay now what can nursing do ? 1938565_1942525
how can nursing &-uh be practiced in this environment ? 1942985_1945365
&-um in schools we don't teach nurses I mean at the undergraduate or at the associate degree level where I teach we don't teach them in this environment this is how you practice nursing in this environment this is how you practice nursing we don't +/. 1946345_1957385

and hypertensive adult female who are being treated with antihypertensive medication . 2634785_2639365
cognitive representation of dietary behavior are enduring memory or socially and culturally derived lifestyle practices . 2641895_2651095
despite the development of social cognition as xxx of xxx theory for expanding dietary behavior and medical nutritional therapy little is known about interaction &-um between cognition culture and &-uh on the &-uh &~cult cognition and culture &-uh on a &~cult or intended that actually practices after clinical diagnose of essential hypertension . 2651615_2679995
two fascinating concept that I am gonna explore for my future dissertation in nutritional adaptation and cognitive representation of lifestyle modifications . 2681725_2691585
&-uh for nutritional &-uh adaptation the theoretical definition is a state in which people consciously realize and remembers the usefulness of selectional choices and plan to follow dietary instruction in_order_to reorient their health behavior . 2695365_2711485
in this particular case the concept will be focused on the selection of nutritious food choices . 2712125_2717125
to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patient . 2717545_2720125
xxx .
for operationalized definition is an education of information processes of adaptive base for one's eating pattern after being guidance or counseling . 2726645_2736705
nutritional adaptation can be measured by answering sixteen item of the questionnaire of the instrument development cognitive representation of dietary behaviors scale developed by doctor Margaret Scisney_Matlock and you can also see in the appendix A that I gave you in the handout . 2737335_2756275
&-um how I'm how am I gonna measure ? 2757935_2760635
I'm looking for the mean total score of the sixteen item and also all items will use a five point Likert scale scoring zero is not at all one is a little two is somewhat three is quite a bit four is very much . 2761325_2775305
and two point five is done now <you might> you might ask me this is a five point Likert scale why &-uh where's two point five come from ? 2776125_2783125
actually &-uh before this &~instru &-uh in the previous instrument &-uh my advisor she doesn't includes two point five <in the> in the in the scale and then in when she develop &-uh rewires &-uh her instrument and she add two point five because some people ask her about &-uh they have a difficult time to to rate the scale . 2783905_2810545
and I'm gonna use &-uh all of these items some <in responsive> on these sixteen items selected . 2811485_2816685
all items selected are positive statement . 2817345_2821585
and I'll give you an example one example of the selected item is is four to five serving of fruit per day . 2822425_2830305
the subject answering very much is given a score of four conversely the subject answering not at all is given a score of zero . 2830705_2837885
for the definition of cognitive representation of lifestyle modification theoretical definition is a state in which people integrate their information processes for one's own lifestyle to enhance their well+being . 2840625_2854405
or a xxx that xxx behavior in this particular case the concept will be emphasize on assessing Heath behavior lifestyle in_order_to <ameliorate their> blood pressure +... 2855165_2865145
the operational definition for this concept is defined as a integration of people information processes of one's own lifestyle in adaptive ways in_order_to improve their health behaviors . 2869105_2881625
cognitive representations of lifestyle modification are measured by answering fourteen selected item of the lifestyle . 2882225_2890025
hypertension cognitive &~represen representation scale at the xxx of my doctor . 2890825_2895565
Margaret Scisney_Matlock I think it's &-uh in she's developed in nineteen ninety three and still revise it &-uh in nineteen ninety eight +... 2897805_2905565
I'm gonna measure by &~us &-uh looking for the means total score of the fourteen item and subject indicate that he'll behavior lifestyle please look at the appendix B the item will use a five point Likert scale again some in responses for this &-uh fourteen item together . 2907265_2925345
and all items selected are positive statement . 2925795_2928855
and the example of this kind of &-uh &~s selected item is xxx the subject answering very much is given a score of four and a subject answering not at all is given a score of zero . 2930075_2942855
come to &-uh the use of the nine &~criter &-uh nine criteria in in evaluating adequacy of the operationalization of the concept . 2945285_2954505
xxx of clarity precision &-uh reliability consistency . 2955105_2960645
meaning adequacy feasibility utility validity and consensus . 2961905_2967365
please &-uh looking for the last page of the handout I gave you &-um because &-uh these two concept they're &-uh even though they're &-uh they enforce a different kind of measurement they have &-um &-uh some theme the same theme but some criteria is pretty different so I'm gonna talk &-uh together . 2967745_2990545
the criteria in terms of the &~cla clarity the nutritional adaptation in terms of clarity definition indicator and operation will be focus on because &-uh nutritional adaptation is a new concept it's really difficult to &~fi &-uh looking &-uh compare any kind of definition and I also talked to my advisor and she told me that I have to define it by myself . 2991605_3016365
so I tried to &+de +//. 3017905_3019085
you know if I put a cognitive representation of an additional adaptation you guys gonna ask me what Sirirat what are you talking about ? 3019605_3027625
because cognitive representation sometime field is very abstract and sometime it's very concrete so it's very difficult so that's why I don't &~us I try not to puts the cognitive representation &-uh for my concept I just use nutritional adaptation . 3027945_3044725
so for the lay +//. 3045665_3046425
it's good in terms of for the lay population to understand . 3046595_3049635
and also for the cognitive &~repre representation of lifestyle modification I thinks this concept is really difficult to understand for the lay population but I still like to xxx cognitive representation because this is my &-uh area of interest there . 3051535_3068475
and I might use an &-uh an alternative option I might use lifestyle modification for hypertension and it's I think it's gonna be &~me much be much more comfortable to talk to general population . 3068905_3081885
in terms of precision this &-uh between the two of the the CREB of &-uh cognitive representation the actual behavior too and LSCR is &-uh lifestyle hypertension cognitive representation . 3083045_3099225
&-uh these two these xxx this these xxx can be observed measure and operationalize . 3100965_3109265
in term of reliability +... 3109485_3110685
nutritional adaptation has an &~accep acceptable reliability allowed quite xxx and for cognitive &~repre &-uh for LSCR has a test and retest reliability from point five three to point six and internal consistency point seven nine . 3114025_3132625
in term of consistency I thinks these two &-uh &-uh these two &-uh instillment use the same thing is &-uh frequency of distribution of letter responsive in selecting food or performing their own lifestyle . 3133585_3148985
in terms of positive statement . 3149865_3152005
I think positive statement is convenient for me to &-uh for calculation in the data because if I also include negative &-uh statement it doesn't mean that I cannot do that but I just thinking that I need to record &-uh the score first if I gonna include other items into to measure this concept . 3153475_3174575
and in terms of meaning adequacy I'm a kind of wonderings about terminology if you're looking for in &-uh at appendix A and B appendix A talks about (0.5) for example . 3175635_3191535
they talks about at least four to five serving of fruit per day . 3192335_3195155
&-um general idea you understand what it is but in terms of the practical xxx this might have a problem because people have a different kind how you gonna quantify the number ? 3196275_3209195
so the only way for the C &-uh CREB is gonna be read in terms of it hasta use be the dash diet regimen . 3210175_3218495
dash diet regimen is &-uh they're actually approaches to stop hypertension . 3218915_3224455
this kind of regimen is talk about &-uh how they quantify the serving for example if I &~tol I eats &-uh fruit &-uh if you eats fruit four to five serving per day it's equal to one medium fruit . 3225135_3239215
or six ounce of fruit juice so &-uh in dash diet they provide information about these things so I think it's compatible to use it &~toge &-uh together . 3239505_3250465
because &-uh CREB cannot stay alone . 3251205_3254085
because it's gonna be have a problem . 3254765_3256145
for for responder . 3257445_3259805
again for LSCRs too I think they haves &-uh they still have the same problem like &-uh CREB and I thinks &-uh it's need additional guideline for clarification for the terminology . 3260745_3276325
for example . 3276985_3277665
they talks about &-uh eat high fiber okay if I thinks I eat high fiber so what's <help him> . 3280825_3287125
how much I have to eat and what kind of fiber &-uh what kind of food maybe for the lay population might have a difficult time to classify certain type of food . 3287395_3298055
so I thinks &-uh my advisor she mights have additional guideline but <I haven't> &~ge I haven't gone to detail &-uh what she did right now . 3298935_3307875
and also in terms of utility &-um &-uh &~fea &-uh for feasibility I thinks &-uh these both kind of tool is useful for the clinical nursing practice and the community best intervention . 3308755_3323075
and for the utility I thinks &-uh it's &~interest it's interesting for me because &-uh it's can be applied with hypertension in other culture after modifying and retesting . 3324275_3336215
&-uh the instrument first . 3365555_3367635
the validity for &-uh these two for C CREB is for the content validity index is eighty three point four percent .
&-uh the way that they test these two .
they use &-uh register dietician four register dietician and one clinical nurse specialist .
and if you look for look into the xxx textbook they talk to they told us about the expert how we gonna use +//.
how the number of the expert that you think is gonna be appropriate to &-uh to evaluate as the instrument . 3367215_3374535
and for the LSCR the predictive construct validity has been used to test &-uh this &~cog this instrument because they're looking for the association of the LSCR and the severity of the VP state . 3375635_3391815
and if &-uh the significant differences among group for the consensus I think the CREB two is acceptable for the scientific community because now &-uh these xxx already xxx and people I think people start to use try to apply her instrument to to use but the problem is &-uh I have no idea whether how much people use &-uh in different cultures . 3392385_3421565
because &-uh I think there is no full standard measurement to compare the instrument &-uh to compare the instrument and this instrument is developed for culture appropriateness specific to african american and Caucasian_American . 3421915_3451095
and I think in I think in in the different way if I'm gonna apply these these too and use these with my population in Thailand I cannot just pick up the &~info the tool and bring it &-uh make it fit with my population in Thailand it doesn't work that way .
because for example the way that we eat is totally different . 3456065_3458945
mhm +/.
+, we don't eat breads pasta or cheese . 3460045_3463045
but we eats noodle . 3463565_3464365
&-uh rice we have &-uh it's called &-uh &~in <Institute of Nutrition> &-uh Institute of Nutrition in Thailand and now we start to investigate &-uh the nutritional value in is &-uh in different certain kind of food . 3465425_3482005
and in different region in Thailand we eats differently . 3482585_3485325
so in the future in &-uh the measurement I'm gonna use this in terms of &-uh <how can> how can I gonna compare people eat in the different regions ? 3485935_3497615
and also I thinks the for the some special consideration that I think I need to be careful is like a bad translation and also &-uh bad translation &-uh I think I need a pilot study . 3498745_3514645
to retest &-uh the instrument first and then I hafta be aware about the vulnerable population because in Thailand most of the &~popu populations are poor . 3515325_3524945
so I want to make sure that I don't just pick up &-uh the &~repre &-uh the the sample but it's not be a represent for the real population of Thailand . 3525525_3535125
that's it (0.5) &=laughs:multiple (0.5) &=laughs:multiple .

the time when they gonna modify themself for example my mom she has hypertension and I have been away for nine years . 3643015_3650775
and she start until she start to realize blood pressure <is a> &~pr is a problem and then she &~jus &-uh suddenly she just change her cognitive map so it's pretty difficult I think it's no matter what how &-uh no better if you got a high education or low education the cognitive map is still a kind of the abstracting and difficult to . 3651335_3673335

&-um I have a question &-um probably this group know better than I do but could you explain to me what cognitive representation means with &-uh plain English ? 3684095_3704415
&-uh cognitive representation is a collection a feature of the objects in the brain and sometime they might haves a network they for example can I just use the board ? 3705555_3721155
because it's a kind of pretty abstract for me . 3721535_3723415

⌈ okay ⌉ +/.

⌈ okay ⌉ it's the just &-uh if I have a &~represen &-uh one representation for example I have I mights have a representation of food &-uh of rice &-uh apple oranges dessert this is a kind of &-uh a &~poss of the &~up &-uh representation and when you &-uh connect all of these representation together like for example why people select to eat food . 3729885_3759865
&-uh different kind of nutritious food . 3761375_3763315
they start to connect their their representation and view and it's called cognitive map . 3763875_3769655
I don't know whether you guys understand ⌊ what I said ⌋ ? 3770755_3773255
⌈ I think ⌉ we've heard it before so we understand it but . 3773275_3775475
so how does it connect to &-uh actual &-uh lifestyle practice ? 3776495_3784755
because cognitive representation and dietary behavior are enduring memories of the socially and culturally derived lifestyle practices . 3786055_3795675
they might just get stuck feeling lost . 3796335_3799135

yeah well in it &~i well not in it is a point I think &-uh you tried to &-uh you know &-uh &-uh intervene or we can say manipulate whether you have that in your &~cog you can recognize it or even enhanced by repeated memory doesn't necessarily &-um dictate your behavior . 3872025_3896645
so you know how does it come in to well I guess it's it's it may not be &-uh . 3897955_3906635

but that might be a whole research project +/.

&-uh I don't know how Thai people believe first of all what is their perception of illness ? 4012315_4018975
what is their perception of the hypertension ? 4019555_4021475
are they considered &-uh do they consider hypertension as a one of the illness or just &-uh aging process ? 4022055_4030135
do they &-uh in fact connect that hypertension to food ? 4030875_4035775
they may think that it something related to bad behavior even if they consider that as a part of aging . 4036665_4042965
or they may not consider it as a disease at all . 4043545_4046105
that's my question . 4046405_4047585
⌈ how yeah ⌉ .
⌊ I have to say that &-uh ⌋ &-uh now I have &-uh I come up with two ideas because I have to say that some people might not think that hypertension as a disease because actually it's just a contributing factor and cause to coronary heart &-uh disease . 4048875_4065215
but of &-uh for the people who get a high education &-uh they I thinks they much more consider hypertension as a disease . 4065945_4077185
and they start to &~pre &-uh modify themself their own lifestyle to prevent hypertension . 4077805_4086005
but at the same time we have other population that they might not perceive hypertension as a disease . 4086825_4094805
right .
+, so it's pretty difficult to so the way that if I'm gonna measure I'm gonna use this &~instr instrument with the population I have to &-uh realize about demographic factors too because this thing is gonna be influence on the way the people gonna answer the questionnaire . 4095425_4112285
so (0.5) .

&-um the two concepts that I've chosen to look at are spatial mapping and life space mobility . 4230465_4236385
&-um spatial mapping &-uh we think of &~th of that &-um in terms of the hippocampus . 4237945_4244845
I'm gonna go a little bit into theory just a tiny bit to set the stage here . 4245165_4248505
&-um basically what spatial mapping is is the ability to map space to make a cognitive representation and using Sirirat's words of a space . 4249265_4257965
&-um what the theory behind this says is that &-uh we have place cells in our hippocampus that actually fire when we get into a certain space . 4258665_4268065
and that when we're mapping a new space those place cells create a map of that space so the next time we come those same place cells fire and we know where we are . 4268645_4277345
the important things to take away from &-um the the literature on spatial mapping is that it's very flexible and this allows us to function in the world we live in . 4278155_4288015
and &~th the example I can give you is when I go into the diag@n I can enter the diag@n from any different direction and I know where I am . 4288495_4295455
so it's very flexible and it allows us to find our way in environments without having to to look at it from any particular direction . 4296035_4303455
so it's not dependent on every single cue being there . 4303915_4307115
&-um as in and one of the other things you think about is if we close our eyes we can sort_of envision certain environments . 4308135_4313635
&-um I think of it as a looking from above view where we don't really hafta be in that environment in_order_to &~s to have a vision or a map of it . 4314455_4324495
okay so and it's essential for world navigation all creatures have some form of spatial mapping . 4325115_4331455
and there's been a_lot_of work done in the in this field . 4331995_4334355
&-um I do have a theoretical definition that's taken from &-um a_lot_of the animal literature and the scientists that work on learning and memory &-um this is the one that I've chosen to use they're they're all I would say there's a high degree of agreement in the literature about what spatial mapping is . 4335475_4350975
&-um &{l=READING spatial mapping is the ability of an individual to keep track of his or her location in space by remembering where he or she has been . 4351715_4359295
it involves formation of a spatial memory and recall of the memory at a later date and time . 4359905_4364765
it involves both cognitive and behavioral aspects +... 4365445_4368565
&=READING &-um for measurement how people measure somebody's ability to map space there's been a_lot_of different ways in human beings . 4369325_4378905
the one way that's been the most common is pen and paper type measures . 4379245_4382945
and what they tend to do is to use certain features of spatial mapping in the pen and paper test . 4383485_4387845
one that &-um an example of one would be the ability to rotate an object . 4388495_4392335
so if you had an object &-um and it's rotated to to a different view do you still recognize what that object is ? 4392575_4399215
so it's recognition of an object when it's been rotated . 4399595_4402135
&-um there's a_lot_of different measures . 4402895_4404415
&-um they even include some mathematical abilities when they look at spatial mapping because numbers are sort_of a spatial concept . 4404935_4411555
and then there're &-uh the other type of pen and paper measures are geographical tests . 4412375_4416055
&-uh there's route tests that test somebody's ability to memorize a route . 4416555_4420195
and there's geographical landmarks where they give you like a picture of the United States and you tell where major cities are . 4420835_4427595
&-uh there's some problems with pen and paper instruments as far as how &-um I'm interested in looking at spatial mapping . 4428855_4435115
&-um really <what it> what it's measuring is recall versus encoding of the environment and I'm really much more interested in combined encoding and recall . 4435755_4444515
&-um it's I'm interested in active spatial mapping of a new environment versus recall of an old memory . 4444955_4452295
so memory for places that you know the city cities in in the United States or whatever is not really spatial mapping and being able to recognize a rotated object is also not a very good measure of spatial mapping . 4452905_4464865
&-um the gold standard is the Morris water maze task for measuring spatial mapping and I put this &=laughs:multiple those of you who are in Diane Terryman's class with me will appreciate the rat . 4465425_4477105
&=laughs:multiple &-um the Morris water maze task is the gold standard in the literature for measuring spatial mapping the only problem with it is it measures it in rats and you cannot &-um dump you know older people in a water maze and &=laughs:multiple xxx spatial mapping . 4480995_4495515
darn .
you could try though &=laughs:multiple you'll have hard time to go through IRB &=laughs:multiple . 4495975_4501515
well there's a_lot_of a_lot_of good things about the Morris water maze &-um it &-um what it actually is it's a tub of water &-um they usually color the water opaque and they put a little platform under the water and the little rat hasta find the platform . 4505325_4519725
swims around in the water and finds it . 4520345_4521785
what they do is they measure the rat's ability after learning trials to find that hidden platform . 4522105_4527005
so the other thing they do is they take away certain distal cues to see if that rat actually has a cognitive map (be)cause one of the things about that cognitive map is that you don't hafta have every single cue in place right ? 4527835_4537915
so they can do a_lot_of different tests they can look and see how does that little rat search for that platform ? 4538235_4542975
they could do a_lot_of things to to &-uh measure &-um cognitive maps in the Morris water maze they can control the environment really well by putting in just the cues they want they can assess all these different factors &-um with the Morris water maze so it's unfortunate that we can't use it in people . 4543165_4559485
&-um it's really a challenge to measure spatial mapping in elderly subjects which is my &-um area of interest and I'm really interested in community dwelling elderly which also makes it really kind_of complex . 4560355_4573095
&-um we &~i things to take into consider are motor and perceptual problems that elderly people can have and how to create a real environment that is a controlled environment if I want to do an experimental type of test &-um it could be very expensive and &~th one of the biggest challenges is that you know in rats we don't hafta worry about super complex mental abilities . 4573875_4595015
but we do with with human beings and being able to tease out verbal learning strategies such as rehearsal and memorization based on verbal strategies versus actual &~hippocampc hippocampal place cell activity is gonna probably be a challenge . 4595075_4609795
one of the new things that's come out is virtual reality mazes where &-um I have this little guy go into the computer because what they do is they try to create a simulated real environment on a computer screen . 4610035_4620755
&-um the pros &-um are that they do they try to simulate a real world spatial task and I've actually logged in and seen some of these environments . 4621655_4630615
and what they do is they have a person you can search around in this room so they're trying to simulate a real environment . 4631095_4637015
it's very inexpensive it's actually free to get the software &-um you can measure very specifically how somebody went about searching which is kind_of a neat feature it's hard to do that in the real world the con the cons are that a two d@l environment is theoretically different than a three d@l environment . 4637595_4655495
some of the things that we look at for a three d@l like a large scale space are that you can't see it from any one point in time . 4656095_4663035
and you have cues that are around you . 4663235_4665055
and it's it's not been &-um it's not real &~cons &-um consistent in the literature that this is a valid tool . 4665585_4674345
and even the people that use this virtual reality say that they're not a hundred percent positive . 4674845_4679925
they're measuring what they want to measure with it . 4680085_4681785
the last thing is that computer skills are needed and since I'm interested in elderly subjects that's something that could be a a roadblock to using the computer for that . 4682125_4691545
&-um so I I what I came up with &-um thanks to some of &-uh Lan's work that she actually showed us in Doctor_Terryman's class was the idea of a three d@l human maze which is really quite based on the Morris water maze without water . 4692925_4709205
what it is it's a large tentlike environment that has cues placed around it . 4710085_4715125
and you you do your experiment with the person having to replace a test object in the same location . 4715525_4721785
and you can do some of the same types of tests that you can do with &-um the Morris water maze you can remove certain cues and see if the person can still replace the test object back where it originally was located . 4722445_4733165
&-um . 4734045_4745345
and you know the environment it's sort_of a a shape that you can't that would be not able to discern just based on the tent environment it would be more of a &-uh &-uh the cues that the person's having to make a cognitive map with .
so &-uh my operational definition of spatial mapping is &-uh the ability to measure &-um spatial I should probably look this up (be)cause I didn't write it real well here did I ? 4749995_4764255
okay +... 4765115_4765635
wait just a minute okay . 4768135_4769195
spatial mapping is defined as &{l=READING the ability to recall a previously learned environment as evidenced by performance in a human analog of the Morris water maze as described by Newman and Kazniak &}l=READING &-um subjects will learn the test environment in a practice &~septi section with the &-uh test object in place and then they'll have to replace the test object . 4769675_4789215
&-um the measure is actually I'll show you I've made a little diagram here . 4790055_4794215
&-um the way that the measurement is conducted is first there's where their original position of the test object &~i &~wh is is which is actually a pole . 4794875_4803875
okay and then wherever the subject puts the pole during the trials and then the measure's actually taken from the center of the room there is an angle score . 4805075_4816295
and that angle is the error score . 4816715_4818375
and that's the measure that I'd be looking at for errors in spatial mapping . 4818945_4823945
okay .
as far as the evaluation of this definition I think it's clear and concise <and it> and it appeals to me because I can get a mathematical &-um readable measurable &-uh &-um score for each subject . 4825125_4841525
it's logical it flows from the literature it's important to the field because we haven't really done a_lot_of studies that looked at &~abil ability to make cognitive maps in human beings . 4841835_4854335
there's been loads of literature on all kinds of animals all the way up through primates and we know that this is a deficit that's consistently a problem in older animals . 4854695_4863155
so it it it goes to show that it's probably gonna be a problem in older human beings and how does that affect to their &-uh cognitive and physical abilities ? 4863665_4872205
&-um the &~val there's a validity issue and this is really it's kind_of like the cultural issues we've discussed in class except for on a bigger scale and that is is maze learning an adequate assessment of spatial navigation or spatial mapping in human beings ? 4873125_4886225
it is in rats we know <that and> that and that other animals however we humans have a much more complex brain . 4886805_4892925
so as more studies are done that really needs to be looked at and I think some of the ways we can do that is to look at &-um other types of deficits people have when they can't map like getting lost for example . 4893605_4903525
&-um that kind of thing okay . 4904245_4905365
the second concept &-um how much time do I have left ? 4906605_4909145
does anybody know ? 4910025_4910505
anyone keeping track ? 4910605_4911265
&-um yes it's &-uh now it's &-uh eight minutes . 4911375_4914935
okay thanks is &-uh life space mobility +... 4915255_4917415
okay ? 4919535_4919995
&-um &-uh when I started looking at +//. 4921295_4923295
what I really wanted to know is how can we determine how homebound somebody is or how active they are in their environment how much they get out and about and I started looking at things like mobility and what I find is that nursing tends to measure mobility in terms of functional status and in terms of immobility . 4924255_4942375
&-um <it kind of> measures SF thirty six and we also do measure I didn't put this on here physiologic measurement a_lot_of different disciplines in the medical and nursing field &-uh but how to measure the extent of mobility that one was a little bit more difficult to find . 4942645_4956785
&-um I did finally find after searching the psych literature a definition of something called life space mobility . 4957965_4963265
what that is is the spatial extent of mobility within one's environment . 4963765_4967785
&-um there's different measures out there a couple different ones &-um the one by May is called life space &-um mobility questionnaire and that one's within someone's home . 4968815_4979795
and so it's specific for life space mobility within a homebound individual . 4980475_4984675
&-um Tinetti's instrument life space mobility looks at the &~si a similar type &-um instrument is maze except it looks &~li at it in an institutional setting . 4985535_4994235
so more like in a nursing home . 4994855_4996615
there's a lack of instruments for the most part for looking at life space mobility in the person's &-uh community . 4996875_5005175
or community dwelling . 5006155_5006995
I did find one questionnaire called the life space questionnaire it looks at life space mobility for community dwelling elderly . 5008275_5015355
&-um what it does it's a just a questionnaire it has nine questions and it looks at the past three days of mobility and they do have some reliability and validity measures that are all &-um adequate . 5015995_5027555
the zones that are included are immediately outside of the home outside of the home then the neighborhood and you can go on down and see they get gradually if you think about a concentric circle going out away from the person's home that's what the life space questionnaire looks at . 5028655_5043275
the pros of using this questionnaire are that it's easy it's inexpensive it's the only tool that's available for community dwelling elderly and it does match with my theoretical definition the cons are that there's questionable criterion validity . 5044865_5059285
what I wondered is it's only has nine points you get one point and <will it> will it actually distinguish between people's ability &-uh to get out I mean especially if they only look at the past three days I'm not sure how sensitive of an instrument that it is . 5059925_5074925
&-um I've wondered if there's a weekly pattern to mobility especially in our elderly where maybe they go out every Thursday grocery shopping or whatever and I wondered if only assessing on three days would would not be a good &~i good measure of what their actually mobility is . 5075435_5090195
I thought also about ceiling effects &~fects if they get all nine points and they do that in one day then that's all the nine points they get . 5090755_5096175
&-um so I I wasn't sure that the way they scored it was good although I liked the zones . 5097175_5101235
and I came up with some suggested modifications such as increasing the &-um seven day the data collection to seven days and doing a concurrent versus a retrospective data collection where you gave the person the instrument and told them to mark every time they entered a zone . 5102115_5116835
and then I also thought that I would probably using this in the population I'm interested in remove the first zone which I which is actually like moved from the bedroom to the kitchen you know and it just seemed like it would be really difficult to do with people that were the least bit active . 5117455_5131355
&-um I would probably change the scoring and have a total score for &-um every day so they could get +//. 5132175_5137755
you know and &-uh there's no ceiling effect at all as many times as they entered a zone they would get a point and I would also suggest increasing the number of points for zones that were further away so we'd get more points for entering zones that were further out . 5138255_5153035
so there's a_lot_of scoring changes although I do like the zones so &-um what I came up with for operational definition is the frequency of trips made within and outside of the home in specified zones over a period of seven days measured using a modified version of the life space questionnaire . 5153815_5172375
(0.4) &-um I thought that my &~def operational definition was clear and concise and logical I liked it because it's a quantitative measure &-um it's obviously because I totally changed what the life space questionnaire how it was designed and scored &-um it would hafta have reliability and validity totally retested . 5175775_5194955
&-um it is consistent with the literature on life space mobility thank you and I think it's a useful concept in nursing as we look more at &-um how our elderly people are &-um acting and behaving and it's almost a measure of functional status you know I think we've limited ourself by looking at ADLs . 5195455_5213775
you know it kind of gives another measure of how interactive with the environment our elderly people are . 5214035_5218275
&-um I did think there's a potential for incorrect scoring that's a negative factor because if if you have any cognitive impairment it might be difficult to keep track of marking that form every time you go somewhere . 5218935_5230235
so . 5230975_5230995
(o)kay that's it . 5231455_5233135
so I have one minute left so I'm gonna go back and say something I forgot to say <with the> &-um with the &-um first measure of spatial mapping . 5233855_5242855
there was some reliability and validity issues with that that I didn't discuss . 5243245_5247385
mainly the reliability would hafta be confirmed every time the instrument's used . 5247585_5250865
and making sure that the measurement (be)cause it's a physical measurement is measured exactly correctly that the poles are placed in exactly the +//. 5251365_5258565
from the center of the room the measurement hasta be exact so with any physical measurement like that it would hafta be &-uh reconfirmed every time it's used . 5258925_5266685
so .
any questions ? 5267905_5269585
with the cognitive mapping &~i is that done like I mean within a lighted tent or I mean are you you know somehow sensory deprived in some way or ? 5269795_5278935
no it is a lighted tent but it's a large scale space in that you can't see the whole thing just standing in one place . 5279195_5285035
so it's just like a circle I guess ? 5285235_5286695
yeah like a more of an octagonal type of shape and there's there's cues that are placed throughout the in +//. 5286715_5293415
tentlike environment . 5293815_5294635
and so what they takes like the pole or whatever away and say okay now where was it ? 5295065_5299305
yes . 5299345_5299585
⌈ kind_of like memory .
okay ⌉ .
⌊ and then you have to go put it back . 5299765_5300945
yes ⌋ .
yes . 5301565_5301645
what's the &-uh time difference . 5302045_5304405
in that spatial mapping experiment between where when they see that original pole like so was it a day then before they go back or two hours or how ? 5304925_5313145
how ?
well you know I thought about going into that more but I think that's more a design of experiment than defining operationalizing our concept so I have to say I don't know yet . 5313525_5323005
okay +/.
+, until I were to really get into design I'll probably know by next week (be)cause I have to write that paper for Doctor_Terryman &=laughs:multiple so . 5323375_5328775
I just wondered if you know what the time difference was and whether that would be affected then because you're interested in working with the elderly and they're &-uh you know sometimes they're cognitively you know how they have memory problems and stuff so I wondered how that would affect . 5329055_5341075
yeah usually what they do is they they &-uh what they did in the original experiment was gave them a model . 5341795_5347355
where they could actually see how it was done and they showed them until the person was able to demonstrate on the model and <then they> then they actually let them practice it in the real tent . 5347775_5355835
there's a_lot_of debate about whether or not you should let somebody practice . 5356215_5358835
so I I need to take a_lot_of the theoretical +/. 5359675_5362135
yeah +/.
+, stuff into concern when I design that whole experiment . 5362975_5366275
so .
with spatial mapping how do you account for the difference between men and women ? 5368355_5371815
⌈ oh .
that's a good one ⌉ .
⌊ oh that's a whole ⌋ theoretical thing . 5372135_5374435
+, ⌊ that's is yeah that's kind_of a ⌋ Julie probably can answer that really well by the way . 5375055_5379695
there is differences and &~s and sometimes when we look at scores on &-uh on certain types of spatial tests men tend to do better however I don't really think we really have enough tests on spatial mapping ability to know that men test better than women . 5379895_5395415
(be)cause we haven't done this sort_of a test more than a couple times ever . 5395895_5399515
yeah and I suspect you're not going to find a gender difference in this test . 5399715_5403215
yeah <I don't> I don't know that we will . 5404025_5405885
find much of a difference .
actually I have two questions . 5406265_5409585
okay +/.

yes they are &-um I'm what one of my like semihypothesis I'll say is that I wonder I I'm really interested in environmental enrichment how enriched somebody's environment is there's a_lot_of &-um rat &~experime experiments that show that if you have an enriched environment for an old rat they will improve their spatial mapping abilities . 5421015_5441975

that's one part of it . 5453995_5454815
and they don't have a_lot_of &~s information coming in . 5454975_5457015
and they're very closed in their environment . 5457355_5458955
if they show deficits in spatial mapping and which way that relationship goes do they not go anywhere because of spatial mapping deficits or do they have spatial mapping deficits because they don't go anywhere ? 5459395_5468795

have you given some thought to your target sample because &-um with both of these measures functional limitations will affect the results . 5614575_5625855
&-um say that you have somebody on oxygen or somebody who uses a walker or somebody who has other types of assistive devices . 5626775_5633635

there's similar components . 6054955_6055875
I'm looking at what the components of professional commitment that impact nurse practitioner professional viability . 6056385_6061485
and &-um I'm looking part of this you'll have to understand I'm a year behind you guys &=laughs so part of this is what I'm working on in eight oh one and we're looking at +//. 6063905_6072585
particularly what got me interested in this is the barriers to nurse practitioner practice . 6073205_6077005
currently there're <political tax and advanced practice nurses scope of practice> in the state of Michigan I don't know if you know this two years ago the &~A &-uh the Michigan Medical Society tried to open up Michigan's Nurse Practice Act . 6077115_6087515
and they went to the Michigan Department of Community Health to try to do that . 6087955_6090655
luckily we have allies there and they said no we're not gonna do it . 6091015_6093455
that had huge implications not only for advanced practice nurses but registered nurses as well . 6093695_6097875
they wanted to throw that supervision word all over the place . 6098235_6100855
&-um there are legal and regulatory battle &-uh barriers to advanced practice . 6102045_6106165
this is &-um some of the regulatory stuff is going away the &-um recently we we're allowed that all nurse practitioners can get reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid . 6106625_6116345
but how that's implemented at state levels varies from every state . 6116985_6120285
and some of it hasta do with how the scope of practice is written for the advanced practice nurses some of it hasta do with legal regulations around the word collaboration . 6120745_6129045
&-um many advanced practice nurses cannot get credentialed or directly reimbursed by indemnity companies or managed care organizations . 6130785_6136225
so for example we can have Medicaid members but in this state Medicaid is all +//. 6137045_6142165
mostly managed care and the managed care organizations some are very open to &-um credentialing and reimbursing nurse practitioners and others are not . 6142605_6151045
and I won't go into the whole +//. 6152445_6153545
so the significance for nursing is access to care &-um as an impediment to health the whole nurse practitioner movement started &~becau in the nineteen sixties due to medically vulnerable populations . 6154815_6166635
they specifically were &-um the programs were designed so that nurse practitioners could provide primary health care for medically vulnerable . 6167115_6173255
I know that it's changed a_lot since then but that was the initial +//. 6174355_6177095
we do Heath promotion and risk reduction &-uh environments for optimizing clients' outcomes and this comes from my interest in nurse managed centers I worked in &-um started a nurse managed center in the city of Detroit and I'm working with the Michigan Academic Consortium which is a consortium of four universities in Michigan which have eight nurse managed centers across the state . 6177455_6199735
which you may or may not know about . 6200135_6201235
and it's a passion for making a difference does anybody know where this comes from ? 6201935_6206655
Ellis it's the readings from &-uh from eight oh one . 6207375_6212255
oh yeah .
+, conflict between nursing and nurse practitioners &-uh lead away from liberation . 6212815_6217735
this hasta do with &-uh oppressed group behavior and &-um while I'm interested in it I'm not going to make it part of my dissertation but it's something that you can't ignore . 6218315_6226135
I think it's getting a little bit better and I think part of that is because of acute care nurse practitioners working directly with staff nurses so there's a a less of that idea that of &-um competition or thinking you're better and those kinds of thing it's more working together . 6226595_6239535
my phenomena is nurse practitioners professional viability in economically &~pene competitive and politically hostile environment nurse practitioners' role in advancing the profession nurse practitioners' participation in professional and social action . 6241445_6256765
I felt really bad about using the word nurse practitioner exclusively &-um I had advanced practice nursing in here because I do think more globally but they kept telling me no you hadta narrow it down and so obviously I'm a nurse practitioner and that's where &-um my interest lies . 6257295_6272515
nurse practitioner professional advocacy nurse practitioner professional commitment . 6273415_6277815
and nurse practitioner participation in health care public policy . 6278475_6281475
these are &-um all issues that I'm really interested in +... 6281915_6284775
nurse practitioner professionalism &-um I use &~th the definition of professionalism that came out_of the work of Hall who's a social scientist and Snizek who also worked on this but also &-uh certified nurse midwife that did +//. 6288065_6303565
used their models basically &-um to to look at nurse midwifery practice . 6304065_6308745
&{l=READING nurse practitioners therefore hold themselves out to the public as possessing special &~ki skills have specialized education or training a belief in public service possess a sense of calling have a sense of integrity and autonomy and regulate the practice behaviors of the group members . 6309105_6326165
nurse practitioners' role in advancing the profession . 6326585_6331245
nurse practitioners have an opportunity with the changes occurring in the health care system to make positive changes and to change the focus of health care from an illness based model to a more holistic and health promoting model . 6331455_6342535
&}l=READING this is one of the big &-um features right now in health care . 6343135_6347075
&-um at the national level looking moving away from the illness model the interesting thing is that &-um medicine is saying +"/. 6347655_6355335
+" oh yeah we need to do more health promoting and risk reduction . 6355575_6358195
and I think that as nursing we need to own that we've been doing this for a long time . 6358435_6362455
and it is our our &-um discipline and our knowledge base +... 6362595_6365915
nurse practitioner participation in professional and social action . 6367235_6370695
this is &-um these next two are probably the area I'm most interested in . 6371095_6376375
it's nurse practitioners are in a position to politically advocate for those individuals with little or no access to health care . 6376835_6382755
and that nurse practitioners working with nursing can push the current boundaries on nursing practice . 6383375_6387715
&-um this particularly is that scope of practice issue because what happens when they &-um write a new advanced practice nursing scope of practice often nursing comes along up with it and so it really expands even the scope of of &-um &~ad registered nursing . 6388595_6404575
nurse practitioners could participate in debates in policies &-um Christine Gebbie she was the AIDS Czarina for a while she really says that nursing &-um doesn't do this very well yet . 6405015_6415555
and that we have a_lot to bring to the debates and &~polit policy decisions and that we all need to get on this bandwagon and really take a look at the policy &-um issues that +//. 6416095_6424795
even in your research that you're looking at +... 6425395_6427275
&-uh nurse practitioner professional advocacy . 6428415_6432375
nurse practitioner groups need to work together to maintain the professional viability . 6432955_6437195
&-uh nurse practitioner groups and I'm talking about professional organizations oftentimes want to maintain their integrity as a professional organization beyond professional viability . 6437855_6449915
so they're more concerned with how do I keep my group together than how do I maintain the viability of all nurse practitioners . 6450195_6456615
and to me that's a deficit . 6457135_6458375
&-um nurse practitioner organizations must be willing to collaborate . 6459265_6462505
nurse practitioner marketing have you heard about this ? 6463305_6465745
there's a group of &-um nurse practitioners that got together it's called The Think Tank it's out east &-um there's actually a professor from U_Of_M that goes to this she's a &~represe representative of naught . 6466245_6475625
and they decided to spend money on a marketing campaign so that a nurse practitioner name could get out there and they would know what it was well there's a particular nurse practitioner organization that was involved and at the last minute decided no they didn't wanna do it . 6476075_6488535
because they were afraid that &-um that group would become another organization that would pull members away from them . 6489495_6495715
so that's what I mean &~whe when what I'm talking about when I mean collaborate sometimes you have to do things that might potentially have bad effects for &~yo yourself personally but that you need to do it for the greater good . 6497665_6509445
&-um nurse practitioners must be &-uh put out their personal agendas aside to work for the good of the profession . 6510485_6515545
+, (0.4) nurse practitioners' participation in health care policies . 6516505_6522045
and this is looking at sort of what politics are . 6522345_6524685
&-um the art of politics is a dynamic and vital process . 6525245_6528645
nurse practitioners need to learn more about the political and policy arena . 6529305_6532465
nurse practitioners utilize the political and policy area in an unified fashion . 6533045_6537325
and that we have to do something to offer the health care policy arena a view that is not often seen . 6538025_6542265
&-um and that's that's really looking at our discipline and what how we view things a little bit differently . 6542985_6548245
nurse practitioners are qualified to provide this different view because of their concern for the &~ve medically vulnerable in practice . 6548715_6555115
now I understand that this is my personal view because I've always worked in medically vulnerable areas and that there are nurse practitioners that don't work with medically vulnerable in the terms that I'm using it +... 6555595_6565235
the change of the United States health care system has set up conditions for competitions for limited health care dollars you can't ignore that . 6568715_6574575
the economic competition is basically &~proba in my opinion is what is driving this attack on nurse practitioner practice . 6574895_6582475
basically &-um organized medicine and indemnity agencies ignored us when we were in rural areas and providing for medically vulnerable but when we moved to Manhattan suddenly this was a huge issue . 6583115_6595115
&-um nurse practitioners are faced with job losses and tighter job markets Henry Ford Hospital just laid off all their nurse practitioners and the physician assistants &-um in Flint the major health care institutions laid off all their nurse practitioners . 6595865_6609525
I heard they did that here just a couple years ago didn't they ? 6610185_6612165

people with little or no health insurance are losing the few prospects of primary care with the closure of nurse managed centers . 6630415_6635455
an example of this is in Chicago there was a huge nurse managed center which had been around for years and &-um medicine got involved at some point and somehow the &~nurs nursing let them take over and then they closed because they couldn't &-um afford to fund it and that's basically because it costs more for physicians to provide care than it costs for nurse practitioners . 6635785_6657585
so in that area &-um it was a huge blow to the community the center had been there fifteen years +... 6658225_6662885
this is my overview &-um that we've been in existence for over thirty five years and &-um I don't think we're taking this attack very seriously and that we really need to get involved . 6665805_6677185
so this is my model it's a bridge you guys all remember eight oh one &=laughs:multiple . 6679085_6683265
how could we forget ?
it's had &-um multiple &=laughs:multiple it's had multiple &-uh revisions &-um as you know in eight oh one you go through that &=laughs:multiple a_lot . 6685955_6696735
no I +/.
+, ⌊ say ⌋ it's Golden Gate . 6697315_6698695
it looks like the Golden Gate . 6698935_6700015
it's the Mackinaw . 6700015_6700935
come on we're in Michigan .
&-um health care culture is the box around . 6701035_6706035
and I &-um it's very interesting <when I> when I tried when you even try to define culture it's very difficult to do . 6706375_6712995
and I know it's spelled wrong by the way . 6713185_6714725
&-um and so I've decided that yeah I'm gonna acknowledge that health care culture's out there . 6715305_6720645
and it can have positive and negative effects . 6720785_6722525
I think of it as the &-um cloud that contracts and expands . 6722845_6725905
&-um and I'm just gonna acknowledge that it's there . 6726665_6728825
but I'm really not gonna look at it . 6728945_6730345
definition . 6731545_6732225
&-uh profession this definition is by Hall and you got it a little bit earlier but I'm defining it specifically as these components &{l=READING belief in public service professional associations autonomy sense of calling and belief in self-regulation +... 6732765_6749125
&}l=READING professional commitment &-um it's very interesting for this because this is my definition of professional commitment . 6749345_6758785
when I read the literature there was a_lot_of talk about &-um commitment to organizations or organizational commitment there was even some about professional commitment &-um they talked about existential stances and those kinds of things and so I tried to think about looking at my model what was I trying to say and this is it that professional commitment is advancement of the nurse practitioner profession . 6759185_6782845
it's &-um on a professional level being a social advocate for your target population but also being a political advocate for your target population and &-um and even going as far as being politically active for your own for the profession . 6783515_6800895
and that professional advocacy is standing up for your profession +... 6801695_6804975
so advancement is &{l=READING the mobilization of nursing and nurse practitioner strengths working with nursing proactive involvement and acceptance of responsibility regarding the moving forward of nurse practitioner practice . 6808115_6818835
&}l=READING professional and &~socia professional social and political action is &{l=READING understanding the political process actively participating in the political process and demanding an understanding of the health care system and the processes that govern resource allocation &}l=READING because &~with without resource allocation it doesn't matter if you understand it you're really not gonna get anywhere . 6820295_6839275
you gotta have the money to do it . 6839855_6840775
professional advocacy nurse practitioners working together through conferences professional organizations to influence the health care policy in a direction that facilitates the viability of the nurse practitioner profession . 6842135_6853715
so this is all about getting those nurse practitioner organizations to collaborate and work together but also about getting nurse practitioners to join those organizations because we're not very good at that either . 6854555_6863675
&-um viability it's composed of &-um +//. 6866905_6870585
and this is my definition when you look up viability you really don't get &~mu you get all the biological viability stuff you don't get anything about &-um professional viability . 6871085_6879865
and even in the articles they talk about it but they don't really give a definition of it so I tried to pull together what I had read and this is what I came up with . 6880645_6888905
the use of knowledge and skills to positively impact the health care policy get included in the decision making processes high high have high levels of patient community institutional satisfaction practice autonomously I know that &-um Melissa likes that word within our scope of practice get direct reimbursement and prescriptive authority . 6889195_6907875
politics you hadta define politics and policy because sometimes we use them interchangeably but they really are different . 6908435_6915675
politics is the dynamic and vital it's &-uh the process . 6916355_6919435
it has &-um many pieces to it and policy is the resource allocation it's the framework that tells us how do we get things done at that level . 6920295_6930395
and so this is what &-um my model looks like . 6931875_6934655
it's &-um it's probably fifteen or twenty years worth of research &=laughs up there and so what I'm looking at right now is where number one is looking at that &-um linkage . 6935465_6947565
professionalism there are &-um models as you know from Melissa out there to look at professionalism and I basically used Hall's &-um and Hampton's scale I adapted actually Hampton's scale which means that I'll have to do some reliability and validity work on it but &-um the piece for professional commitment there was no scales for that obviously because I made it up . 6947745_6971985
&=break_in_tape and they are doing testing on it already +... 6978125_6980025
so I have done a &-um a small test on the scales and this is basically the means and the standard deviations that I came up with . 6981305_6992225
&-um this was an N of six &-uh with nurse practitioners . 6992925_6998745
and they &-uh belief in public service came out &~moder that they moderately agreed sense of calling they moderately agreed professional associations they moderately agreed I find it very interesting in this state where we're really having a problem with &-um regulation regulatory laws and autonomy that they were on the fence about this which I think sort_of reflects the &-um the &~at the environment that we're in right now . 6999055_7023635
for professional commitment &-um it came out better than I thought for the first time I'd ever done a questionnaire making it up . 7024975_7032955
&-um that I probably I'm pretty I'm on the right track to developing this questionnaire I think . 7033455_7039215
&-um the one thing &~wh is the professional social and political action . 7039515_7044155
it was moderately disagree and it was the way I worded the questions &-um and it's really interesting when you go through the process to learn that really how you develop your questionnaire really affects your results . 7044255_7058095
and these are sort_of what the &-uh it's not a good &-uh curve there but (0.4) this first one &-um basically this is the standard deviations looking at the advancement variable for professional commitment . 7059125_7077265
this is professional advocacy &-um and what I'm assuming is that when the means are really low here (be)cause I didn't do a_lot_of testing on this is that those are really the ones that I need to look at possibly modifying or getting rid of . 7077755_7090095
professional adequacy really increases when I drop out a_couple_of &-um the bad variables . 7090715_7096035
(0.4) and this was basically the demographics of the model test &-um they were all Caucasian which is a problem when you're using a &-uh convenient sample . 7100365_7109865
and there was one PhD . 7111505_7112425
and this is just to show you what the questionnaire looked like . 7113785_7116125
(0.4) there's &-um huge issues with obviously construct validity and reliability all that testing is still to come it'll hafta be done &-um the original one by &-um Hampton actually had a very good reliability and &-uh construct validity it's like point eight (0.5) . 7120255_7139895
so are you looking at &-um this in the context of individual feelings of commitment and stuff or like when they get &~int into &-uh different professional positions ? 7145215_7160215
like I mean (be)cause I know nurse practitioners who will espouse oh yeah I feel committed I feel I can advocate I can do this and that and then they get put in these situations especially with health policy and they feel overwhelmed I mean they've never been exposed to anything like that and then they just do nothing . 7160825_7174805
right . 7175385_7175545
&-um basically it's you know because yes and no is the answer . 7175825_7182845
&=laughs basically I'm looking at individual and part of what I'm looking at is &-um there's this whole theory around policy advocacy that talks about nurse citizen nurse &-uh advocate and nurse politician . 7183685_7195565
and you really wanna see a range now everybody doesn't need to be a nurse politician and not everybody needs to be a nurse advocate but you'd hope that at least everybody goes to the level of nurse citizen and that's sort_of where I'm measuring that piece and I read that article after I &-um did the questionnaire so that's part of that +... 7196155_7213455
you know looking at the reliability of the questionnaire and the questionnaire stuff but yeah it's a &-um it's +//. 7215695_7223395
somehow we're gonna hafta measure how the &~contin my continuum and how it's gonna be weighted . 7223405_7227405
I just asked Julie (be)cause because I think there is a_lot_of different issues around +/. 7228365_7231545

I'm really looking more at group participation I really am interested in the nurse practitioner organizations and how they can't function together . 7235825_7241985
but the people that make up the nurse practitioner organizations are individuals . 7242725_7246265

+, I think that you could I think that if you I would hope that if you test it out on a professionalism scale that's looking at your that looks at the commitment to the role that's the sense of &-um calling and all that kind of thing . 7276535_7289915
your &-um indicators then seem to be so specific to the role of nurse practitioner . 7291095_7299955

yes . 7309945_7310405
okay . 7310885_7311225

right . 7318085_7318305
I'm just asking because you know I mean you get that thrown at you all the time as a nurse practitioner . 7318865_7322705
no . 7323325_7324185
I think that that nurse practitioners are a part of the profession of nursing it's just that in this the it's the only way to look at this particular issue . 7325535_7333055
is to to tease them out . 7333595_7334795

okay guys . 7535585_7536665
&-um the two concepts that I chose to measure were child advocacy and injury prevention &-um I think most of you are aware of my &-um ongoing relationship with child advocacy going back to eight oh one and +/. 7537305_7550305
yup +/.
+, onward and &-um I'm now looking at injury prevention &-um more specifically as a component of child advocacy &-um I'm really am interested in looking at more of the components related to health outcomes . 7551025_7565605
that side of it as opposed to looking at &-um the professional's viewpoint of these issues . 7566145_7571725
but and I'll get into this a bit more specifically as I move on and you guys probably remember from my work in eight oh one child advocacy has not really ever been &-uh well or clearly conceptually defined or worked with everyone just kind_of uses it as an umbrella term . 7572225_7586985
so I'm really trying to work from the ground up with it to get some concise &-um definitions and usage of the terms . 7587605_7593805
(0.5) so from our first concept child advocacy . 7599275_7601135
the background and significance for the science and practice of nursing is that advocacy is a responsibility inherent in the role of the nurse so says the ANA in their standards of clinical nursing practice . 7601595_7611955
and pediatric nurses are often considered to be child advocates just because they work with children on a regular basis . 7612595_7618255
they are in a position to provide resources &-um and affect the well+being of children +... 7618815_7623255
to be effective child advocates pediatric nurses must know what child advocacy is and how to effectively participate in the process of child advocacy . 7626535_7634315
there's very limited research available in the health literature concerning what is known about the critical components of effective child advocacy in relationship to health outcomes and there's no specific nursing oriented theoretical or conceptual framework to guide the use of child advocacy by nurses . 7635015_7651915
these factors combine and result in an ambiguity surrounding the concept of child advocacy and nursing and lead to the possibility that child advocacy is not being utilized effectively in the practice of nursing +... 7653635_7664495
&-um so again because of this lack of any kind of coherent &-um definitions or even usage of the terms child advocacy for my &-um eight twenty paper I did a concept analysis of child advocacy utilizing xxx procedures and methods . 7667155_7685815
&-uh I'm gonna kind of rush through it here just for the sake of time . 7686775_7688995
and of_course if anyone is really interested I'll be happy to provide you with a copy of the paper and the actual concept analysis . 7690235_7696275
and of_course for the concept analysis I looked at +//. 7697075_7699355
yeah &-uh huh &=laughs:multiple I looked at a review of the literature from multiple disciplines . 7699615_7705675
&-um you know everyone from education to health care to law to social work again &-um to lay people who use this concept of child advocacy so I looked at a very broad &-um section of &~disc or crosssection of disciplines . 7706045_7720885
and &-um you know again found lack of research related to the systemic identification and evaluation of the subsequent components of child advocacy beyond the anecdotal professional and descriptive reports . 7721885_7732725
(0.4) actually moving into the &-um operationalization process for child advocacy for this paper &-um again I found there's no specific theoretical or conceptual framework to guide the use of child advocacy by nurses and so &-um I decided to go ahead and formulate my own theoretical definition utilizing the process for theoretical definition development discussed in Wallace . 7736335_7761595
&-um the purpose for which the concept was being defined and operationalized &-um I determined what that was . 7763445_7771525
and I came up with a description of child advocacy as it occurs as a nursing phenomenon came up with a preliminary definition combining the concept analysis findings lit review &-um this purpose which I came up with and &-um said that utilizing an ecological framework to provide theoretical context and results of the &~concet concept analysis of child advocacy and further review of the literature concerning child advocacy . 7771525_7798125
I then took that preliminary definition went back to the literature tried to map some things and came up with my theoretical definition being that nurses performing activities which protect and support the quality of life of the child for the purposes of promoting laws policies standards and issues which benefit the child's well+being . 7799425_7817845
&-um I then looked at specifications of variable aspects again going back to the literature asking myself the question which variables would provide the most useful information to nurses &-um and came up with the process and product of child advocacy as both being &-um variable aspects +... 7819515_7838955
then came up with an operational definition which is identifying and performing activities which protect and support the quality of life of the child . 7841825_7849865
(0.4) no measurement &~curre currently exists which provides specific measurement of this operational definition so happy joy &=laughs:multiple I &-um I'm gonna hafta if I keep pursuing this develop a new tool . 7852845_7866045
+, and I actually spent significant time starting to go through this process and coming up with some things . 7867435_7874375
&-um excuse_me I decided I should &-um this would be a criteria of reference measure because I'm not interested in comparing &-um child advocacy to &-um any other group or you know one individual how much child advocacy they possess or demonstrate compared to another because again there's just a lack of basic understanding of what actually composes it . 7875155_7896235
&-um I thought the development of a descriptive questionnaire survey that measures pediatric nurses' activities knowledge attitudes and practices related to child advocacy and allows for the obtainment of factual information attitudes beliefs opinions and assessment of the level of knowledge that pediatric nurses have concerning child advocacy would be appropriate for this . 7896955_7916455
&-um the purpose of the tool would be again to measure pediatric nurses' definitions and descriptions of their experiences with child advocacy &-um and specific questions would be designed around the critical attributes of laws policies standards and issues related to child advocacy . 7917995_7932455
and those came out as defining attributes from the concept analysis . 7933055_7936495
&-um I decided I would entitle this &-uh tool nursing perceptions surrounding child advocacy and &-um there would be five sections again addressing the nurses' knowledge attitudes towards child advocacy current practices of the nurses in relation to child advocacy case studies and personal professional backgrounds of the nurses in their working environments . 7938435_7959875
&-um to address the issue of content validity &-um definitely would take the proposed tool to content experts &-um trying to get a variety of experts to look at &-um different content areas and particularly the pediatric nurses people who identify themselves as professional child advocates and of_course someone to look at the questionnaire design itself . 7961595_7984755
and &-um have them do an item objective congruence to determine the validity of the items included in the questionnaire . 7985635_7991935
there'd be pilot testing with pediatric nurses and of_course revisions &-um throughout (be)cause this is an iterative process . 7992615_7999775
to address construct validity &-um I thought hypothesis testing would be appropriate and I utilized proposed constructs identified in the development of the theoretical and operation theories to do this +... 8001415_8012695
&-um criteria related validity my understanding from reading Streiner and Norman is that since there is no gold standard to use for comparison I would not need to evaluate it . 8014975_8024355
&-um at this point of_course it's some point in the future that's always going to be an issue of concern . 8025555_8031555
in terms of reliability the measures will be taken to ensure that detailed explicit instructions are developed to guide the respondent and that the test is administered in a consistent manner to eliminate sources of random error . 8032335_8043415
and I'll talk a little bit more about this in a few minutes . 8043875_8045995
&-um I looked at some other approaches that I could have used to &-um measure this concept as I defined it it could be a development of a qualitative study &-um development of a checklist &-um identifying specific activities related to child advocacy &-um or just a checklist composed of previously identified activities of child advocacy and other disciplines . 8047665_8071085
&-um I decided these would in the end not be appropriate to use because there would be critical epistemic and ontologic flaws in taking examples straight from other disciplines and darn it I actually know what that means . 8071625_8083205
so I hadta use it . 8083605_8084525
&-um basically I mean there'd be no theoretical grounding in the discipline &=laughs:multiple of nursing and there would be great possibility I think that the operazational@n$adj &~zation ⌈ would not ⌉ . 8085045_8093785
⌊ Doctor Elgen would be so proud of you &=laughs:multiple . 8093805_8095145
but basically I was concerned that &-um using these procedures without a grounding in nursing would not capture the essence of child advocacy from a nursing perspective . 8098625_8106665
okay the rules for quantification are definitely &-um make sure that all the questions were treated identically in the process of coding . 8107465_8116405
&-um coding would be based on decisions made prior to the administration of the questionnaire . 8117045_8121385
&-um of_course I mean just basic things . 8122145_8124485
you know blank answers would be coded nine . 8124565_8126265
&-um there'd be a_priori logic checks for internal consistency &-um as appropriate . 8126985_8132025
and all of this is going to just aid in the &~consiste consistency and validity of the measurement . 8132805_8137405
in terms of adequacy of this &~operiz operationalization strengths include the feasibility <of the> &~operiz of the operationalization due to the indicators identified and the operations proposed requiring only paper and pencils and the willingness of study subjects to participate . 8139875_8157535
&-um I think it was adequate with consistency &-um in terms of every effort being made to &-um rigorously adhere to the defining guidelines and criteria for theoretical and operational development &-um of definitions . 8158315_8171235
terms were explicated and used in a consistent manner . 8171895_8174775
and logical reasoning was used to guide the selection of indicators and &-um explain the &~linkwi linkages among the aspects . 8175315_8182475
of the different concepts' meaning . 8182735_8184195
utility again of this process I thought was adequate since there's no current instruments addressing child advocacy from a sound theoretical perspective and clinically because child advocacy activity is thought to be engaged in regularly by pediatric nurses . 8185245_8198305
some of the weaknesses I thought in &-um were related to the &~clari clarity and meaning of the operizationalization process because clarity &-um is weakened by the broad nature of the the concept of child advocacy and the lack of research pertaining to child advocacy components &-um clarity could be strengthened by further critical analysis and theoretical development of the concept . 8199435_8221855
and better meaning of adequacy for this concept will be developed with further research of this concept . 8222455_8227175
so at this time I mean you have to keep in mind it's unclear as to the full strength or weakness of the &-um operizationalization that I use related to issues of reliability validity meaning adequacy precision and consensus all of which cannot be fully evaluated until after the tool has been actually developed and completed . 8228225_8248765
&-um you know for example consensus this is the first time it's been put out there for you know scientific consumption and so you guys can tell me what you think but you know I do plan to continue over the long haul to try and develop this so it will eventually be out there . 8249345_8263985
&-um I will you know throughout the process include strategies since I discussed around &-um for example reliability and validity and &-um continue to include these strategies throughout the entire process to ensure that &-um these issues are addressed rigorously and thoroughly . 8264625_8280945
how am I doing timewise ? 8281305_8282185
(0.5) .
eight minutes left .
alright .
okay injury prevention like I said &-um this is a relatively new departure for me I've been working on this topic for about six months now one of my &-um advisors &-um or program committee people suggested that it might be good to bring in a specific piece related to different issues around advocacy just to help move the dissertation process along . 8291915_8315535
&-um and again I really am enjoying this because it is pulling me more to health outcome sign which is what I'm ultimately interested in . 8316125_8323005
&-um injury is the leading cause of death for children of all ages most injuries are predictable and preventable part of the health of two thousand ten objectives call for injury prevention activities . 8323945_8334245
&-um pediatric nurses in primary health care settings are in optimal positions to participate in injury prevention activities &-um for example by discussing potential injury prevention strategies with the parents and their children during routine visits . 8335565_8348785
review of the literature indicates that the concept of injury prevention has been relatively well researched and defined and theoretically the concept of injury prevention fits within the context of health education theories which are subsumed in &-um many nursing health promotion models . 8350315_8366555
&-um I just went with you know what Waltz said that sometimes it's very appropriate to borrow someone else's theoretical definition and so &-um took those from Burman that &~interven or injury prevention or interventions which employ a broad array of strategies that include education behavior change engineering technology and legislative enforcement . 8368155_8388855
again I looked at the purpose for which I was trying to define this concept and &-um came up with this description of injury prevention as it occurs as a nursing phenomena in pediatric primary health care settings . 8391465_8404265
&-um and again this concept is dealt with more in terms of public health and epidemiologic standards and I'll talk a bit more about that in a few minutes . 8405385_8414925
the operational definition I came up with is that the performance of educational activities by nurses in primary health care settings to prevent injuries as evidenced by assessment of injury risk and provision of injury prevention education . 8415815_8428475
&-um excuse_me .
the instrument for this concept again I couldn't find an instrument that specifically measured this &~operizational operational definition &-um as I identified it in the literature but I did find a tool that measures aspects of injury prevention as operationalized here &-um and I want to modify that tool of_course with the author's permission to serve as again criteria and reference measurement instrument . 8432985_8458605
the tool that I found is called the Injury Prevention Questionnaire it's developed by &-um some public health nurses and MDs &-um to assess the feasibility of incorporating injury preventing activities into an existing home visiting program staff primarily by nurses . 8460525_8477665
hundred and twelve item measure assesses home visitors' beliefs regarding injury prevalence and injury prevention strategies for practices related to identifying and addressing selected injury topics and factors that might impede their implementing injury prevention activities during home visits . 8479215_8494475
and it also measures home visitors' beliefs and practices related to specific hazards for young children &-um specifically they look at the hot water temperature fire and fire &~ar fires and fire arms . 8495095_8504795
&-um the measure is looking at the respondents' beliefs about the importance of injury prevention . 8506735_8512075
&~u use a four point Likert scale that measures how concerned the respondents are about the potential for injuries and how important it is for home visiting programs to include injury prevention activities . 8513355_8522755
it also measures the extent to which home visitors believe that injury prevention activities fall within the range of their responsibilities and measures their attitudes about the three specific injury hazards I just mentioned in the previous slide +... 8523385_8535325
so the modified tool that I'm proposing would be a descriptive questionnaire survey again with the purpose of measuring the performance of educational activities by nurses in primary health care settings to prevent injuries as evidenced by the assessment of injury risk and provision of injury prevention education . 8535935_8553475
again I named this tool just for clarity as much as anything and called it the prevention and the pediatric health care setting instrument . 8558545_8565945
it will generally follow along in the format and presentation of the injury prevention questionnaire I just discussed . 8566425_8572085
&-um the response to items will be rated utilizing the injury prevention questionnaire's Likert scale &-um as described above . 8572985_8580065
the number of items on the questionnaire will hafta be reduced to accommodate the practical and time constraints of the primary care setting I'm sure . 8580515_8587375
if anyone came up to you in the middle of work and said ooh a hundred and twelve question you know +/. 8587875_8591555
yup +/.
+, &~i or a hundred and twelve item questionnaire you know you'd be like &-uh yeah no &=laughs:multiple &-um but in doing this some steps are gonna need to be taken to be sure that the validity and reliability of the instrument is not affected . 8592995_8604415
&-um again another approach I considered was development of a directed interview &-um could be administered one on one by the researcher and allow for further explication of injury prevention in the pediatric primary health care setting . 8606005_8618665
&-um but the problem I decided would be that it could seriously decrease the number of respondents who could be measured in any xxx due to the time financial and other practical &~con constraints of doing this . 8619505_8629625
&-um again the rules of quantification and coding the rules for quantification and coding will be determined systematically and before administration of the questionnaire and I'll utilize the appropriate codes and coding rules will aim the consistency and validity of this measurement . 8630945_8645805
&-um strengths . 8647665_8649685
let's see . 8649965_8651385
for this I found that in strengths &-um in terms of adequacy of &~opera operationalization included utility of the operizational@n$adj injury prevention as there are no instruments to specifically assess the concepts in the primary health care setting and in terms of consistency because every effort was made &-um to again rigorously adhere to the defining guidelines in the criteria for theoretical and operational definition development . 8651795_8679395
&-um again I think it's very feasible &-um due &~th to the fact that indicators identified and the operations proposed could be capable of being executed &-um as the proposed questionnaires will only require the paper and pencils and willingness of study subjects to participate . 8680495_8697455
the big concern I have again is that the hundred and twelve questions propose serious threats to feasibility &-um so modifications to reduce the number of questions to a more feasible number will hafta be made and these modifications in terms propose significant threats to the content validity of the measure . 8698295_8714835
content validity of the original injury &~preven prevention questionnaire was developed with consultation from injury prevention specialists oh well okay and public health nurses and was pilot tested for clarity with three respondents . 8716145_8730185
content validity should be retested after the development of the modified tool that I'm proposing &-um this time using pediatric primary health care nurses as_well_as injury prevention specialists and just to wrap it up &-um one thing I'm finding really &~intereste interesting in looking at the literature related to injury prevention is that a_lot_of it is epidemiological focused coming out_of public health and it addresses a specific problem . 8730745_8760725
and so this idea of developing &-um concepts from a theoretical basis or perspective is just not the way they think . 8761375_8770475
+, right +/.
+, ⌈ mhm mhm ⌉ .
+, ⌊ and so ⌋ a_lot_of the things that you know we deal with in the public health care setting as nurses it's like oh there's a problem let's go fix the problem . 8771495_8779655
and then if there's any kind of theoretical development you're doing it backwards . 8780215_8782775
&-um so I I and I just it's like oh this kind of lightbulb clicked . 8783535_8788015
and it's like this is like why this has been so hard for me I think . 8787985_8790705
for a_lot_of different things I'm looking at is because we're coming in saying oh and there should be theoretical ties . 8791245_8796845
and it should be kind of developed from this broad theorem down . 8797085_8800245
and it &~i you know again in public health settings things are just you know grassroots up . 8800705_8805365
so that is it +... 8805985_8808845
questions ? 8812305_8812585
your &-uh tool Lynne this &-uh injury prevention tool . 8815915_8820635
mhm +/.
+, I'm I'm just trying to understand &-uh you're it's gonna measure the performance of educational activities by nurses so you actually want it to measure the actual education that the nurses do ? 8821655_8832235
mhm the activities . 8832495_8834095
related to the education that they do . 8834335_8836195
&-um and again it's getting really to I don't wanna at a no I don't wanna say qualitative piece but you know descriptive piece of what is it that they're doing and are they actually doing it ? 8836905_8849605
&-um there's I know there's issues always related to &-um you know primary health care providers know that it's important to talk about injury prevention . 8850105_8858745
but because of time constraints and or attitudes or it's not that important parents know about this . 8859605_8864605
you know they don't address it . 8865185_8866305
and I think that's gonna be picked up in this scale just by the fact that &-um you know the questions are you know do you really feel that you should do this or you know this is not a big deal &-um and things like that . 8866405_8879225
I just &-uh wonder what implications that'd have then for tool development in terms of &-uh like would my area would if you talk about observing behavior like the best way to measure somebody's behavior is not to have them fill out a scale but to actually send an observer in there to observe them +/. 8880525_8894845
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ doing ⌋ the behavior you know so I was wondering whether or not you had thought of that same thing . 8895265_8899585
I actually hadn't until you just said it but my immediate reaction is again just knowing my colleagues they're not real susceptible . 8899885_8909005
to observations I mean it's one thing if you have a student go in with them and observe but someone's that going in &~th it's that whole you know &~cri critique Hawthorn Effect &-um and actually thinking more of &~th of the pediatricians I work with . 8909985_8924305
even the +/. 8924885_8925225
⌈ they would ⌉ +/.

so you're interested in primary prevention . 8927735_8929755

and and you see and your &~def and your definition this is like a purposeful thing that is done to prevent +/. 8931135_8939175

+, injuries +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ I'm just trying to make sure I understand . 8940375_8942115
and then &~yo you included by nurses in definition so &-uh what was the intention to include you know the provider rather than +//. 8942875_8956975
&~yo you are interested in outcome but you define the the person who can provide that with image .
so so &~i if the social workers or &-um health educators provide same education &-uh material you don't consider that as a <positive outcome> . 8965125_8979545
actually I do but it kind of I think along the lines of what Nancy was talking about just kind_of purposes of something . 8978425_8984965
I mean in trying to go through this process wrapping my head around all these different levels of conceptualizations I was trying to keep it simple . 8985765_8993445
I mean I I am kind_of philosophically always interested in the big picture as opposed to you know why just look at pediatric nurses when you actually probably should be looking at you know all health care providers in the xxx ? 8994395_9007675
pediatrician doctor advanced practice nurse whatever but again there's this issue of well you start to assess everybody and then what is it that differentiates the social worker from the pediatrician from the you know the advanced practice ? 9007875_9021975
nurse &~i I think it can muddy the waters . 9022045_9024745
well I think you can &-um in the definition of the term you can still maintain some level of ambiguity or abstract &-uh and then you know when you come to operational definition or design you can define you know the xxx and for your case &-um the nurses provide these care . 9025945_9048305
<but I> don't think you wants to well unless the &-um the nurses as a provider are key to your concept or the the phenomena and I just didn't think that was a key . 9048775_9064935
no &~i &~i it's not I think I mean again I can only say it's like flashbacks to eight oh one . 9065875_9071015
because I I mean I was constantly kind_of pushed to narrow it you know get more specific &-um +/. 9071505_9079045

then you can add the layer of the specificity that eight oh one might have required . 9130405_9136145
but it's not just &-uh one flat even dimension . 9136965_9140365
I have &-uh I was thinking about your injury prevention +/. 9141865_9144725
mhm +/.

+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ end ⌋ but is there standards out there for educating people of &-um children and families for injury prevention ? 9155625_9162585
because if there isn't standards is it reasonable to assume that someone would actually just do it on her own ? 9163225_9168785
hm .
&~i I mean there's always standards in terms of like I said the ANA puts out their clinical standards and the AMA does that . 9170005_9177785
now whether an individual &-um you know provider chooses to adhere to those standards gets into a whole nother area of research related to the education of you know the particular providers . 9177985_9192625
and there's actually research related to injury prevention regarding that . 9192765_9196585
they looked at like I think medical students who had received injury prevention training versus the ones who hadn't and how they actually provided the injury prevention services . 9196705_9204585
so I mean it it definitely has implications yeah for where I'm going with this . 9205055_9210015
⌈ I just ⌉ +/. 9210495_9210615
⌊ isn't it ⌋ +/.

+, oh yeah +/. 9218215_9218415
+, but I wonder how much that's really ingrained into pediatric nursing . 9218495_9222775
because if it was then it seems like it would be more like built into their practice . 9223775_9228335

I think injury prevention is addressed in Helping People two thousand and ten isn't it ? 9232115_9235575
yeah . 9235715_9235895
+, so usually from that will flow dollars and from that might flow more standards and guidelines and and &-um intervention strategies because they can get funding for it . 9236275_9246715

⌈ well it's also ⌉ +/. 9247455_9248535

so you see that's how it all ties back into I said you know this broad +/. 9257785_9260445
mhm +/.
+, child advocacy definition I've been trying to work with yeah so &~i I mean one of the most interesting things I found out about injury prevention &-um was that the majority of it is still centered on epidemiological +/. 9260925_9273125

you'll be happy to know that the only person in my pediatrician's office that does any injury prevention teaching is +/. 9295685_9303005

⌊ the nurse ⌋ doesn't do anything except shows them the office and gives a shot . 9305705_9308585

&-um family practice physicians usually use you know the guideline issued by American Pediatric &-uh Pediatrician &-uh American what is the American ⌈ &~Pedi ⌉ . 9309525_9321645
⌊ American ⌋ Academy of Pediatrics . 9321845_9323245

okay so the next week &-uh start with Julie and then Nahmee &~Lau &-uh Laureen Junah Jermporn and then Ranlan . 9347265_9360565
okay
