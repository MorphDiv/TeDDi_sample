the ratio of eight to three . 0_876
if you've used eight to three you should have eight empty boxes on your ? 876_21606
left . 21606_22905
left hand side and three empty boxes on your right hand side which means you have used ? 22905_29603
eleven . 29603_30243
eleven . 30243_30795
eleven boxes, shares, piles, whatever you want to call it . 30795_36491
any kind of grouped word . 36491_39298
okay . 39298_42096
what if I want to divide money up ? 42096_46161
you have to use your imagination here . 46161_49648
smarties later . 49648_51393
money now . 51393_53250
money . 53250_54313
I want you to divide two hundred dollars in the ratio one to three . 54313_60438
so create for me the ratio one to three again . 60438_70958
right . 70958_80208
so you have ? 80208_81341
one box on the left, three boxes on the right . 81341_86430
now the whole idea Dylan . 86430_91730
the whole idea about dividing things up in a ratio is that you have equal piles in each of your four equal amounts in each of your four boxes . 91730_112426
so what will go in one box if you have to fill four boxes equally . 112426_119825
Ashley ? 119825_120386
fifty dollars . 120386_121786
fifty dollars . 121786_122256
so four shares is equal to two hundred and so one empty box or share has fifty, so the ratio one to three will equal fifty to one hundred and fifty . 122256_147506
yes ? 147506_153088
okay . 153088_154791
so you write this down please . 154791_156440
it's best if you write the question since it's an example, so write divide two hundred dollars . 156440_164496
divide two hundred dollars . 164496_167503
right . 167503_171948
two hundred dollars . 171948_173080
divide two hundred dollars in the ratio one to three . 173080_180125
I xxx forgotten your xxx . 180125_185941
xxx . 185941_189181
mm . 189181_192806
then copy down four shares equals two hundred dollars . 192806_195948
one share is fifty . 195948_196996
one to three is fifty to one hundred and fifty . 196996_200640
four shares is equal +... 200640_202863
now if we're going to be very good, people, with this . 202863_206791
then we ought to write an English statement at the end of it, so we should say something like the first person gets fifty and the second . 206791_227778
that's presuming that was a story about people, the second person could have been companies I suppose, gets one hundred and fifty . 227778_237798
okay, so you really ought to put some English in at the end to actually answer what the question was . 237798_248956
xxx . 248956_253781
right ? 253781_259285
finished ? 259285_259798
okay, next one then was +... 259798_263206
the next one that we had, we recreate a ratio of two to five . 263206_277631
so recreate your ratio of two to five . 277631_280186
which was ? 280186_286171
how many blocks required ? 286171_290330
seven . 290330_291531
seven . 291531_292090
it's starting to seem really easy now, isn't it ? 292090_295450
okay, and I actually want you to divide two hundred and ten dollars . 295450_302078
two hundred and ten dollars between those seven boxes in the ratio two to five . 302078_316508
I want you to divide two hundred and ten dollars into those seven boxes but in the ratio two to five . 316508_336366
so firstly you have to figure out how much is in one box . 336366_342661
just a minute girls, we'll just let the others have a think first . 342661_347225
Danny . 347225_355058
you don't need a calculator to do that . 355058_359385
you told me to get it out Miss . 359385_360803
well you don't need a calculator to do that . 360803_363946
what is it Tanya ? 363946_365961
one box in each box . 365961_367666
would it be equal to thirty ? 367666_370145
I think it would . 370145_371073
how would you find thirty ? 371073_373136
seven divided by xxx . 373136_375690
three . 375690_376646
seven . 376646_377170
twenty one divided by ? 377170_378776
seven is three . 378776_381618
two hundred and ten divided by seven is thirty . 381618_383040
xxx . 383040_387976
yep . 387976_389865
okay . 389865_390433
so two boxes, sixty, five boxes, one hundred and fifty, so the first person gets ? 390433_406256
sixty dollars and the second person gets one hundred and fifty dollars . 406256_410128
write that down . 410128_410846
write what down ? 410846_413888
write down the English . 413888_418663
so the first person sixty and the second person gets ? 418663_423030
a hundred and fifty again . 423030_425726
okay let's do one more of that . 425726_436920
let's do eight to three and this time I want to divide sixty six dollars . 436920_446028
worked it out Mark ? 446028_468556
xxx . 468556_471666
you can't give me one number for an answer if you're going to give me a ratio, because you've gotta give me ? 471666_480218
a number for this share and a number for that share don't you . 480218_483610
so +... 483610_486940
yeah . 486940_488411
oh, you're telling me what one share is worth . 488411_490705
is that what you're saying ? 490705_491631
so eleven shares is sixty six so you're saying one share . 491631_498168
okay . 498168_499078
so what you really wanted to say to me was ? 499078_501676
is one share six and the answer to that would be yes . 501676_504495
so the eight would be +... 504495_505556
nicole ? 505556_506988
yes . 506988_508910
so what would the ratio eight to three be ? 508910_513966
eighteen . 513966_516830
eight to three would equal ? 516830_518924
do you follow what's going on ? 518924_521121
forty eight . 521121_521440
yeah . 521440_522534
forty eight to eighteen . 522534_525088
just that you missed a couple of the classes so I didn't know whether you had caught on . 525088_531760
forty eight to eighteen . 531760_534801
six times eight and six times three . 534801_540473
so, you're right, the first person gets forty eight dollars and the second person gets eighteen dollars . 540473_549813
all right . 549813_552518
now, I want you to see if you can make up your own question, but before you do that +... 552518_560750
if you want to make up an easy question you can find a bit of a relationship between the ratio . 560836_567955
