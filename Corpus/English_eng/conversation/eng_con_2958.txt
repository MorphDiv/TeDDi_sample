why do you think Waterhouse loves drawing and modeling dinosaurs ? 2825_6945
I think he just likes it because it's something for him to do for him to have fun with it . 7785_16805
I think he likes it because, like it said, from the point when he was a little kid, he liked drawing dinosaurs . 17805_24505
I think it's just what he loves to do and it almost became a profession for him as he got older and he sculpted new models . 24725_34705
I think he was just kind of a thing that started off whenever he was a kid . 36285_42125
S_four .
do you have an answer ? 42585_43585
I mean, I agree with her, but in other ways, he loves to paint and draw . 45765_54545
first it was animals, he used to do all kinds of animals . 54905_59005
then, he started drawing dinosaurs and he found the love for dinosaurs . 59765_64925
and also he liked to draw other animals, but dinosaurs the most, because he could create them in such a realistic way . 65465_75245
people didn't really know what dinosaurs were before he sculpted them . 75445_79785
S_five ?
I agree with everybody . 80885_82165
and I think he also made dinosaurs because he wanted to show people because hardly anyone knew what dinosaurs could look like because they only found a few bones and a tooth, and he just did it so everybody knew what a dinosaur looked like . 83545_99225
he just wanted to make it come to life because the things that come to life are cool to look at, so he probably wanted to make a dinosaur so then everybody could look at it and some could even think that it's real . 103685_123765
I don't really think he like did it just to show off . 124765_128145
I think he was one, maybe he was trying to get a job somewhere because he could get a serious amount of money and a job from sculpting such realistic dinosaurs . 128175_137895
and he probably just did it for fun because, like I said before, he loved drawing dinosaurs because he could create them in any way he wanted, but he can also make them realistic . 138455_149495
how do you think John felt when he figured out that the queen was going to look at his creations ? 153715_160895
I think he was like, wahoo and I can't believe this is happening . 161295_167235
he would've probably been a little over-excited though, because this is like a once in a lifetime chance to have her see . 167795_178735
would anybody else be stressed out ? 181695_183475
like I'd be stressed out because it's the queen and the king of England are coming to see the creations that I've made . 184155_193355
wouldn't anybody else feel a little stressed out ? 194235_197195
I would be really stressed out because I get stressed out really, really easily, like going and talking in front of people and making something to show the queen I would just be really, really nervous . 200125_215905
and I would feel all kinds of emotions, like stress and scared and not knowing if I'm going to mess up or not . 216745_229005
I think he'd be happy, stress, maybe a little bit scared . 242595_247115
happy, because the queen could really, really like it and he could get a job on it . 248075_255135
stress, because he didn't know if she would like it or not . 255735_258935
and a little scared because if something bad happens he would get sent to jail . 260135_266975
why would he get sent to jail ? 271045_272525
well because something bad could happen and the queen could get injured really bad and it could be bad . 273445_286405
maybe the creations could collapse ? 286845_290265
yeah and then if someone like the queen or the king gets hurt he could go to jail . 290625_298645
I'm thinking like the queen and king, of course, that will be a really big deal, but the other scientists might've gotten hurt too . 300665_307085
they were the big deal scientists that help with discovering fossils of dinosaurs and they were a really big deal . 307305_319465
I agree with xxx . 319885_323665
how do you think he came up with those ideas ? 327195_329775
I think he came up with the ideas of sculpting the dinosaurs because he just imagined what a dinosaur would look like and then he just like put it down . 330215_339795
like the iguanodon, he thought it might look something like today's iguanas . 340195_346335
so it has iguana-like teeth and pretty much everything like an iguana, but it's huge . 347135_354495
what would be the first thing you would do if you realized your sculptures were gone ? 362735_366755
like you went out maybe to have lunch, you came back, and you realize everything was stolen . 366935_371575
what would be the first thing you would do ? 371695_373235
the first thing I would do would be scream and cry because I'd be like no ! 373575_378775
this is all my hard work, it took me forever to make these, and I've been trying to think of this my entire life and someone stole it and it was almost finished and someone had to steal it at this time . 378865_394925
honestly, I probably would've looked around a little first because knowing me, knowing myself, my workspace would probably be really, really messy . 395565_405045
so I'd probably look around a little bit first . 405685_407945
and then if I really knew that all my sculptures were stolen, I'd probably call someone like the cops or something . 408225_417245
but there wasn't a telephone yet at that time . 417525_419745
well then I'd go get the cops, I'd run and go get them . 420345_423805
I agree with S_three . 424045_425205
I would go get the police and while they're looking, I would just keep making drawings of what I remember of what they look like . 425545_434085
and maybe if they don't find them, then maybe I could create them again . 434965_439805
but that would take a really long time, wouldn't it ? 440725_442745
might as well . 443985_444725
because if they're the pieces that a lot of people like then might as well do it for them . 445045_449965
I would probably, I would get really mad and I would go find the cops and tell them that it was stolen and I would just start crying . 451155_461335
I'd probably cry too . 461995_463835
I would also try to remember who was there the night before, if anyone who was there, and see if they would have stolen it and broken it or hid it anywhere or where would they hide it . 464415_477875
I'd try to find who did it . 478515_481155
I probably also, another thing, I wouldn't just look around my workshop to see if they were there, but I'd look around to see maybe it didn't happen that long ago . 481855_492715
maybe it happened like right before I came back . 492955_495195
so I'd look around my workshops to make sure if they weren't still hiding in there and they didn't have anything and they weren't stealing anything . 495635_502135
now if they had a gun, I'd just run away and scream and say, 'don't kill me ! 502875_508555
I agree with xxx except for the last part, I would be like, 'just put the gun down and give me back my stuff or otherwise I'm calling the cops . 509035_519575
well you can't, like you said, the telephone wasn't invented, so you'd have to run to the cops, but then they could leave . 520335_527735
so that wouldn't work . 528095_529575
how do you think you would deal with that ? 531555_532875
take away the gun and just drag them to the police office . 533755_538235
what if they tried to shoot you ? 538695_540315
that's the main point . 540495_541255
if they have a gun, they're going to try to shoot you if you try to take it from there or something . 541595_547495
good thing I'm in gymnastics . 547795_549035
okay . 549675_551655
let's get back to the story . 551655_556815
how do you think it was change the story if the queen did not approve ? 560465_564065
I think that he would have been like, what ? 564485_568505
okay, maybe I can try again, but +... 570045_575265
and then what if she would leave ? 576425_578025
then I would try to get her back and show her all the cool things about it . 578725_585905
and then maybe she would change her mind . 586545_587885
if she didn't like all the dinosaurs I create, I obviously would try again with one of the dinosaurs, but I think I'd try making something new, other than dinosaurs, like that was back in history like birds . 591005_609585
I know there were bird dinosaurs, but, like actual birds were alive back then, in the dinosaur age . 610485_618345
so I'd try sculpting something else then . 619005_621685
I would be devastated if the queen didn't like my idea . 622585_625905
like she came all that way just to see my creation and she didn't like it . 626165_630885
I agree with S_two . 632725_633805
I probably, would be devastated and also kind of angry because I spent all that hard work into building them . 633865_642745
but then I would probably rebuild them, try to make it a different kind of like dinosaurs or something . 643135_651495
I have an uptake question . 652055_652855
