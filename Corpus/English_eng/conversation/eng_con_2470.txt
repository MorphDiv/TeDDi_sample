so what is it for, underwear ? 167440_169370
mhm . 169510_170070
yeah, <at least> &=breath at least it is actually related to
because they show underwear ? 175650_176980
yeah, I mean, xxx there are a lot of ads that take this sort of
hm . 177500_177880
mhm . 181350_181860
with the product . 186380_190110
would you say that is an American thing being an American ? 186380_190110
yeah . 187290_188160
xxx +//. 187290_188160
hard to say . 191960_206550
I uhm@fp actually I was hearing on the radio the other day . 191960_206550
about uhm@fp &=breath they were talking specifically about
yeah, this doesn't look American to me . 206430_210510
I would have guessed French, probably . 206430_210510
yeah, definitely not . 208140_209470
uhm@fp yeah . 212390_218680
I have another page of French ads, but it is not gonna work, is
&=smack &=breath go back over here . 212390_218680
&=breath yeah, apparently <there is a new movement to>
to &=breath to uh@fp they're fighting for a legislation
hm ? 224560_225050
&=smack in America or in France ? 232310_234130
no, this is in France . 233050_234330
okay . 234130_234650
uh@fp &=breath yeah, the I think hes@fp it was the EU . 234540_292630
<at le@i> i@i so@i some organization in Norway was
&=breath and uh@fp &=breath they were trying to block exactly
&=breath but this was in nineteen ninety eight, and what I found
&=breath uhm@fp &=breath this is another &=breath observation that
and I've gone through so many French magazines that I got ,
&=breath uhm@fp and this is one of the motifs . 234540_292630
this isn't all the ads I've found but &=breath two of these ads I
and I found that &=breath &=breath it was kind of striking to find
and it was all perfumes that are being advertised . 234540_292630
&=smack I think it is a cultural thing, but I'm not really sure . 234540_292630
&=breath so I would open that up and &=breath see what you
hm@fp the middle one is different than the other two . 297400_318250
&=breath I've heard that some people find the middle one
&=breath I don't find it much worse or better than &=breath many of
hes@fp displaying nudity . 297400_318250
actually, I probably find it less insulting than the other two, I
uh+huh . 312590_313150
why ? 318480_319110
uhm@fp &=breath &=swallow &=breath it looks more like &=breath art
<it is not> I don't know . 319340_336170
I can't really say, but it looks more esthetic to me . 319340_336170
uh+huh . 325380_325830
would you think that these are American ads, or ? 339250_341630
no, I would not, <I would be> &=breath hes@fp I would be
mhm . 348740_349330
uhm@fp at least, you know in in non+pornographic
uhm@fp &=smack &=breath just a note on on this ad, the
&=breath the ad is from a French magazine but I found the
uh@fp it was a cardboard cutout in a Kaufmann's store . 356790_376440
&=breath but she wasn't clutching her breast and her breast wasn't
the dress sleeve was up here and her arm was behind her back . 356790_376440
she was standing like this . 356790_376440
&=laugh . 372710_373480
huh . 376990_378390
that is funny . 376990_378390
w@i was it the same picture in other respects, just had been
everything else was identical . 378980_380780
yup . 381400_381900
huh . 382100_382560
interesting . 382820_383600
what do you guys thing about that ? 384080_385060
well, they uh@fp &=breath I guess the advertisers know the
it goes in with &=smack Americans cutting scenes out of movies that
and, so . 393320_400850
but I found the same thing in New_York and it was this one . 401480_404100
&=breath . 401480_404100
wow . 404520_405200
well, New_York is not America . 405330_406800
&=laugh why do you say that ? 407480_409230
well, I mean, yeah . 408750_428000
<it is &=breath uhm@fp &=breath I guess> uh@fp the Russians
and I mean, it is the capital, but it is not, you know, New_York is
I don't know . 408990_409760
uh+huh . 420930_421520
hm@fp okay . 428300_428970
you think they're more tolerant xxx +//. 428890_430810
well, I think they're more cosmopolitan . 430750_432460
hm . 432560_433130
I mean, almost by necessity . 433400_434970
I don't know . 436250_437110
uh@fp I'm gonna talk about this ad again in a minute, and tell you
all right . 448470_474740
well, I guess this goes back to what you said earlier about
&=breath there is another ad, it is on the next slide, but it is a
&=breath &=smack uhm@fp I found that American
uhm@fp it is not really artistically done, the way the French
could say that . 475340_476150
uhm@fp so, &=breath I also found a lot of American ads cut the head
&=breath uhm@fp the other ad on the next slide, I'll show it in a
&=breath whether it is covered or not, here to here . 477230_507370
that is it . 477230_507370
&=breath so, it is almost like saying her face isn't important
&=breath uhm@fp what I found is, like, with this ad, these
&=breath uh@fp . 477230_507370
can I ask what magazine ? 506620_508110
m@i &=smack think it was FHM . 507980_510950
what is that ? 510930_511630
what is that ? 511560_512230
it is one of those silly uhm@fp young men's magazines . 511720_515720
like GQ or Esquire ? 515070_517250
not not hes@fp actually not as nice as GQ, maybe like
&=smack oh, yeah, Deta@i okay . 520030_521260
like, you go into Borders and you always see them <on the> on
&=breath like Maxim . 520840_527790
mhm . 528110_528650
uhm@fp but I got the magazines from my friend's friend's
so is that like Seventeen, just for t@i guys, or ? 534500_541880

but for +//. 538800_541200
yeah, it is like Cosmo for men . 540420_541970
what is +//. 542420_542790
or what is Vogue for men . 542690_545890
although it is not as +//. 542690_545890
no, not Vogue . 544630_545710
okay, I don't know . 545910_546850
hm@fp okay . 545930_546560
uh@fp Vogue is really more stylish . 546500_550750
&=breath <it is> it is like a Cosmo or a Glamour, maybe . 546500_550750
mhm . 550250_550800
it is like a lifestyle magazine . 550680_555310
tells men what to wear and how to act and what music to listen to .
and +//. 550680_555310
hm@fp okay . 553460_554040
a@i in every feature is this actress or model and she is
&=breath and she is always on the cover . 555920_567560
&=breath and they have ads like this . 555920_567560
I found a lot of ads like these . 555920_567560
yeah . 559400_559870
oh, <I know> <the f@i> the first set of French lingerie

I found one German . 573950_577560
&=breath but +//. 573950_577560
at least her legs were on those . 577630_579710
yeah, you can see the rest of her body . 579290_581040
yeah . 581450_605650
<I think> well hes@fp <I m@i> I think in that i@i
&=smack &=breath uhm@fp but I found things like this &=breath in
they're advertising stereo speakers . 581450_605650
&=smack &=breath so, you have to wonder what the hell does that
a road sign or a naked woman . 604430_606550
&=laugh . 604430_606550
exactly . 606120_628480
&=breath so, what I'm writing in the paper uh@fp is, one of the
&=breath but over here there is &=breath some connection between
I had no idea that that was the message &=breath until I started
&=laugh . 606120_628480
oh . 624480_625860
what +//. 624480_625860
what is a body shot ? 628300_629580

she holds the tequila between her breasts and the guy has to take
okay . 637030_637770
all right . 639020_639820
there were even some guys that did not understand the message . 639930_644950
I was really shocked . 639930_644950
most of the women did not know what it was . 639930_644950
yeah, I didn't get that . 642570_644250
&=laugh . 642570_644250

&=breath yeah, I I did not connect it with the ad, I connected
&=smack uhm@fp &=breath I'll show the other ad . 647980_664200
<the other ad is> &=breath hes@fp I found it really
I di@i used it in a focus group . 647980_664200
some people kind of found it provocative, not so provocative . 647980_664200
<what do yo@i> can I ask what you mean when you say
uhm@fp &=breath &=smack use somehow they're trying to get your
&=breath they're not subtly trying to give a message, they're
&=breath they're trying to grab you . 666410_703610
and I'm specifically interested in the use of nudity to grab
&=breath but I'm also interested in why &=breath uhm@fp Americans
<there is a tol@i> there is a difference in the tolerance
&=breath and you see that, it comes out in the use of nudity in the
hm . 705310_705730

not another men's magazine ? 898530_900510
like s@i +//. 898530_900510
I would think a men's magazine, but . 901240_903630
Cosmo . 903760_907170
Cosmopolitan . 903760_907170

a women's magazine . 909070_910230
yeah . 910420_910980
I was really shocked &=smack when I found it, actually . 911540_915310
yeah, it really stuck out . 911540_915310
huh . 911620_912100
that is odd . 913100_913790
huh . 916010_916360
all right, maybe now the next slide . 916920_923390
&=breath I don't wanna pull on this again . 916920_923390
&=breath yeah, there you go . 916920_923390
&=breath so, I also have another two page ad . 916920_923390
another what ? 923580_924230
another two page ad on the next slide which is German . 924120_929770
can you translate that one ? 924120_929770
&=smack uhm@fp it is Radio_Hamburg . 929990_936800
you don't have to wear anything else . 929990_936800
&=breath well, this is a pun, that doesn't translate . 929990_936800
right . 936440_939250
I know it is a pun . 936440_939250
&=breath uhm@fp . 936440_939250
you don't have to have anything else on . 939100_941130
what is the pun ? 939200_940180
turned on as a radio, but also wear . 942230_944210
oh, got it, okay . 942520_945680
oh, that s@i translates, there you go . 942520_945680
yeah, a little bit . 945550_946690
yeah, that works . 947430_948260
that one ? 948820_949410
do you want a tv guide that turns you on, or one that makes sense ?
what is the +//. 959950_960740
it is a tv guide . 961680_962530
that hm@fp yeah . 961990_963090
the implication being that our competitors just turn you on without
is that +//. 963430_967390
well, there is a lot of newer &=smack I guess German and also
whereas the small one on the bottom is more conservative, has
and &=breath does not generally have that much skin on the cover .
&=breath although in that one it kind of does, a little bit, which
uh huh . 985690_986210
uh huh . 989640_990210
&=smack oh, yeah . 991960_993420
&=breath what +//. 991960_993420
it is Kate Winslet on the cover . 993050_995050
uh@fp &=breath well, that is really back handed then . 994920_998490
that one on the right . 994920_998490
uh+huh . 995430_995950
what do you mean ? 998940_999550
well, <they are> <the advertisers are> &=breath I mean,
&=breath but then they are kind of like, thumbing their nose at it
when really, I mean . 999430_1021210
they're not . 999430_1021210
they're using it to get readers just as much as the people

right . 1016980_1017490
yup . 1018100_1018670
uhm@fp this isn't in a magazine ad . 1022640_1025190
it is not ? 1025510_1026180
no . 1026050_1028660
where did I get that ? 1026050_1028660
&=breath where was it originally ? 1026050_1028660
I would say a billboard ? 1030890_1032010
billboard ? 1032390_1033060
uh@fp I don't know, I'm &=breath it seems a little risque for a

I don't know . 1037620_1042360
&=smack do you remember the ads we've seen in Germany on
yeah, that is true . 1041260_1042440
it is a billboard . 1042960_1043680
ha . 1044110_1045120
see ? 1044110_1045120

Spiegel . 1057160_1092580
&=breath uh@fp <this is> I have the magazine still but it is
&=breath and uh@fp &=breath they talked about some billboards

&=breath <and it was> they were just all scrunched together .
&=breath and it was supposed to promote the the uh@fp

&=breath uhm@fp hm@fp so, how do you think this compares to the
hm . 1104010_1104550
<it is less> well, it strikes me as less uh@fp objectifying .
well, I don't know, I mean, &=breath yeah, less explicitly
uhm@fp . 1106200_1116670
uh+huh . 1115130_1115770
all right . 1117930_1119600
wait until I show you the next one . 1117930_1119600
hm@fp okay . 1119480_1120130
being German . 1121040_1121870
uhm@fp yeah, I would agree that it is less objectifying, and I
this woman ? 1133540_1134330
she yeah, she doesn't &=breath like &=smack she looks more
yes, I think so . 1133790_1142380
&=smack looks more m@i hes@fp like a normal person . 1137240_1140990
mhm . 1144080_1144610
yeah, and certainly more natural than the American ads . 1144740_1148540
more normal . 1144740_1148540
right . 1147440_1147990
where they're all air brushed anyway . 1148900_1151210
&=laugh . 1151270_1151950
where they probably all +//. 1152210_1153120
the French ones are really badly air brushed . 1152480_1155280
you can tell . 1152480_1155280
really ? 1155090_1155690
you can really tell . 1156880_1157880
this is also, like, a woman of &=breath normal shape . 1156950_1164090
she doesn't have like huge breasts or xxx +//. 1156950_1164090
and she is wearing a push+up bra anyway . 1165480_1167290
well, <I'm j@i> I was just talking about the left one . 1167540_1170920
the right one, yeah . 1167540_1170920
yeah . 1168410_1168930
let me show you the next one, and then you can see if you still
&=breath . 1172110_1176890
&=smack well, yeah . 1176180_1177140
that is a German ad for a French car . 1182170_1184170
yup . 1184290_1184890
&=laugh &=breath well there you go . 1184470_1188080
what does it say ? 1184470_1188080
&=laugh . 1186720_1187590
&=smack I can't read it . 1188600_1189600
something form . 1189390_1190560
uh@fp form ? 1189840_1190990
the form . 1191120_1191920
Sin@i Sinne ? 1192490_1194700
Sin@i Sinne ? 1192490_1194700
I can't read that, let us see . 1193980_1201010
&=breath the form, the senses, the &=breath Peugeot_Coupe . 1193980_1201010
the Peugeot . 1199550_1200400
so it is saying that this car is shaped like a woman . 1206710_1209820
well, do you think it is objectifying ? 1213030_1221520
as much as the American ads or not so much as the American ads
hm@fp . 1215400_1216160
&=breath well <what it has> what it has over the American
like was talk@i commenting on the the German model . 1223840_1254650
&=breath and the other thing you can say is hes@fp you know
there it is, you know, naked woman . 1223840_1254650
&=breath &=smack no like, &=breath you know, nothing covering
the American ads you don't see, you know, you wouldn't see a
you know ? 1223840_1254650
it is not a r@i wh@i yeah ? 1231710_1233220
<would this> hm . 1253910_1255070
well, it is not a real woman . 1255110_1257960
it is a sketch . 1255110_1257960
what ? 1255400_1256070
well, it is just a sketch, sure . 1256570_1259760
what what were you gonna say ? 1256570_1259760
well, it is comparing a woman to a car . 1258840_1264890
I find that pretty objectifying, I must say . 1258840_1264890
it is &=laugh +//. 1258840_1264890
yeah . 1263670_1277010
&=breath well, <it is also> I wonder how much the
hm . 1275010_1275420
&=laugh . 1275220_1276000
mhm . 1276270_1276950
hm@fp yeah . 1277230_1277900
uhm@fp xxx +//. 1277490_1280240
but did she have to be naked ? 1280040_1281520
well, <it somehow you know> <it is> <if you're gonna>
<I mean somehow it is> &=breath I mean not that &=smack
you know, if you're gonna &=breath pretend to have sex in an ad,
and not beat around the bush with it . 1299190_1301240
<and not> yeah, you know ? 1300300_1323090
&=breath you know, <not that> not that I would
but, &=breath uhm@fp you know, <it is> it is less
uh+huh . 1310450_1311060
wishy+washy . 1319160_1320120
just have sex in the ad . 1321560_1322660
well, I didn't find the tequila ad, the American one, very
that is, I don't know . 1323010_1332560
okay . 1323160_1323710
hm@fp yeah . 1329220_1329930
&=breath well, yeah . 1332400_1342010
I mean &=smack yeah, that hes@fp that ad in particular I
just made me feel creepy all over . 1332400_1342010
uhm@fp . 1332400_1342010
&=laugh I think you're one of the only guys that said that . 1341880_1351910
&=laugh and I think I've surveyed more men than women . 1341880_1351910
&=breath &=smack uhm@fp although a number of women actually
liked it ? 1351810_1352760
yeah . 1352630_1362870
one girl said it reminded her of uh@fp being on the beach in the
&=smack &=breath though I was wondering maybe she is one of
well, you know, I mean, you know, consenting adults do what
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah . 1366490_1373960
&=breath uhm@fp it was just really surprising . 1366490_1373960
as a lot of the other women, <the first> all they had to say
uhm@fp . 1367980_1368770
yeah . 1370070_1370730
uh@fp I don't know, th@i j@i that ad right there just
that is all that ad makes me think of . 1373760_1384240
mhm . 1381370_1382030
&=smack why ? 1384080_1384780
'cause I associate that kind of hes@fp the whole like tequila, the
oh, the tequila, not this one . 1389830_1393240
oh, okay . 1389830_1393240
yeah . 1389830_1393240
yeah, not this ad . 1391090_1396500
no, no . 1391090_1396500
the tequila ad just makes me think wh@i about the people
mhm . 1394910_1395360
I'm gonna switch slides . 1398730_1400000
&=breath . 1398730_1400000
&=noise uh@fp okay, so . 1401720_1430800
<what I'm tr@i> what I'm trying to show here is that I
&=breath or it can be a little bit more subtle and almost clinical
what is that one for ? 1432830_1434070
it is a shower, as far as I know . 1433950_1436550
is that right ? 1433950_1436550
mhm . 1435580_1436150
yeah, it looks like it . 1436480_1437610
shower, the whole shower system . 1437070_1456600
&=breath so, hes@fp <when I'm trying@i> <what I@i> hes@fp
so this ad i@i probably not a good example, it has some fit
&=breath uhm@fp . 1437070_1456600
mhm . 1438720_1439340
what do you mean it has some fit ? 1456290_1458360
what is +//. 1456290_1458360
fit as in here . 1458260_1460920
the nudity fits the product . 1458260_1460920
oh, okay . 1460880_1462390
yeah . 1460880_1462390
but here, the tv guide, the provocative image does not fit . 1462320_1469560
it fits, in I think, in this sense more . 1462320_1469560
mhm . 1467170_1467850
yeah, there there is a cultural context for it . 1468540_1470810
<but hes@fp in> yeah . 1469930_1480710
&=breath but uh@fp in maybe the the car ad, it fits but
it lacks fit . 1469930_1480710
which one was the Jensen ad ? 1480590_1482490
the feel the raw naked power of the road, the speakers . 1481910_1484750
oh yeah . 1484070_1484920
so, that one lacks fit, whereas this one has a lot of fit . 1485240_1496440
&=smack &=breath and <it is not sh@i> you're not trying to
&=breath it is a subdued approach . 1485240_1496440
yeah . 1496860_1499480
&=breath <well also I mean you've got> what is that ? 1496860_1499480
and you have a kid, too . 1499360_1501050
yeah . 1499360_1501050
yeah, that &=breath kind of &=smack desexes it a little bit . 1500090_1505210
it kind of +//. 1503250_1503950
yeah . 1503650_1508960
I think, <the em@i> yeah, the emphasis is definitely on the
hm@fp yeah . 1507670_1512060
it is not on the woman, it is not on the the nudity, it is not
although, you know, it is still there . 1511800_1515570
I mean, you know, they didn't have to show her butt like that . 1511800_1515570
they didn't have to . 1515990_1517210
oh, but she is standing in the shower, so . 1516360_1518720
but she is standing in a shower so it makes sense to have her in
well, yeah . 1518950_1524260
<but it is> that I mean, that piece of the image is still
but it is not as provocative as that one . 1524740_1526300
well, true . 1526090_1527790
yeah . 1526090_1527790
it is less provocative ? 1527110_1528380
hes@fp . 1528410_1528880
uhm@fp &=smack &=breath <and I also think> I I actually
they don't use nudity &=breath really for anything except for
<for anything that has to do> even &=breath stuff in the
they don't use someone naked . 1529050_1548470
the only shower ad I found, she was wearing a towel . 1529050_1548470
like she just walked out of the shower . 1529050_1548470
hm@fp . 1548360_1548880
uhm@fp &=smack but in the French advertising, I do see that quite a
<where they use> &=breath where they're promoting some
&=breath &=smack and they show someone naked, or they show just
just the breasts of someone . 1548790_1586140
and they're promoting &=breath your body will look like this if
&=breath so, there is really high fit there . 1548790_1586140
and it is not &=breath provocative like , it is gonna
&=swallow would you agree with that ? 1548790_1586140
&=breath <that th@i> that you can find fit and lack of fit in
yeah . 1587080_1590710
it seems like a dimension you could scale an ad on, yeah . 1587080_1590710
&=smack yeah . 1590730_1593290
also in American ads though, no ? 1590730_1593290
hm ? 1593540_1594070
also in American ads though . 1593900_1598150
oder were you just talking about German and French ads now ? 1593900_1598150
uhm@fp in American ads . 1598650_1603880
there is not as much fit as there are in French or German ads . 1598650_1603880
xxx +//. 1600630_1601160
but some . 1603680_1607260
I just saw some stuff the other day that +//. 1603680_1607260
what did you see ? 1607060_1607970
I saw something for a breast enhancement creme . 1607890_1611150
oh, that is right, yeah . 1611600_1612730
yeah, <I showed> I even showed you that . 1612260_1614070
yeah, it is in the new Vegetarian_Times, isn't it ? 1613260_1615810
yeah, it was in the &=laugh Vegetarian_Times, I think . 1616110_1619040
yeah . 1616110_1619040
yeah . 1619590_1620220
it basically was a shot, like, of the breast . 1619670_1627580
and just the breast and the cleavage . 1619670_1627580
uh@fp so that has fit, I guess . 1619670_1627580
mhm . 1627620_1649420
that would be the first ad I've really found . 1627620_1649420
another ad &=breath uhm@fp I can show you later if you wanna see
I take that almost like the Jensen ad . 1627620_1649420
&=breath uhm@fp <but also nudity is only> I mean, this
&=breath so +//. 1627620_1649420
&=laugh . 1640940_1641570
they're what ? 1649300_1650130
Spiegel . 1650140_1651100
oh, okay . 1650870_1651420
uhm@fp and all the nudity ads I found in American ads were from
&=breath whereas Spiegel is geared towards the higher education
intellectual left+wing . 1666780_1668650

<but it is not okay to show, you know, in this &=breath hm@fp
she is not really very buff, though, is she ? 1764590_1766140
she is not very buff . 1767550_1768680
yeah . 1768510_1774240
well, <that is> that that was the point . 1768510_1774240
<that was> hes@fp there were a couple valid points . 1768510_1774240
buff means like jus@i muscular . 1768510_1774240
what is +//. 1770750_1771480
muscular . 1773220_1775440

bulk . 1774740_1798220
d@i yeah . 1774740_1798220
&=smack &=breath the there were two valid points that I
one, yeah, she is not muscular at all . 1774740_1798220
&=breath uhm@fp and number two, the pose is &=breath uhm@fp
oh, I see . 1776470_1777550
mhm . 1782870_1783610
mhm . 1795900_1796660
Apollo almost . 1797710_1799030
yeah, right . 1798510_1802430
very yeah, very, kind of &=breath Olympian . 1798510_1802430
right . 1799700_1800250
Greek, I thought of a Greek image . 1801740_1803790
yeah . 1802660_1803280
yeah, this is like, you know +//. 1803850_1805610
<did you see the> can you read that ? 1805550_1807470
if you can turn this page, you are already pretty strong . 1808770_1812020
oh, yeah . 1811240_1812390
I missed that whole discussion, was there a public discussion about
&=breath nah, it was people wrote in to In_P_G_H the week after
oh . 1817870_1818410
basically, uh@fp they put the ad up . 1818640_1828980
three days later, someone came, defaced it, wrote on it, put
someone wrote that across her &=breath on the billboard . 1818640_1828980
mhm . 1823460_1824130
mhm . 1828840_1829500
uhm@fp and then they took it down, and it hasn't been put back up,
&=breath but hes@fp I'll show an example where there is a double
&=laugh no one will admit it . 1829430_1845860
&=breath but I'll show you an example of it in just a second . 1829430_1845860
mhm . 1832050_1832840
mhm . 1837980_1838670
yeah . 1845250_1852280
<this is> this is <a b@i> I think a weak example of the
&=breath because the ads <are so> are unequal in those two
they are, but look at how they used her . 1851140_1893850
I have another example to show the double standard, but
&=breath and it was both times female in a provocative sexual ima@i
okay . 1851140_1893850
&=breath so, this one was put up in England as a uh@fp
&=breath uhm@fp &=smack seven hundred and fifty people wrote in . 1851140_1893850
there was only one billboard in all of England &=breath as far as I
&=breath seven hundred and fifty people wrote in and asked them to
they took it down . 1851140_1893850
okay, yeah, yeah . 1854990_1856190
is that +//. 1890220_1890690
was that a British ad or a French ad ? 1894450_1897290
<or a> yeah . 1894450_1897290
it is a French ad, French perfume . 1896240_1900240
&=breath they used it in England as a billboard . 1896240_1900240
but <there is not like a> there is not a male analog
no . 1904660_1905120
just her . 1906240_1906960
so, why is that a double standard ? 1908670_1910650
<it is n@i> <that is not> that is not my example, yet . 1910510_1922350
&=smack &=breath I'm just again showing that there is a controversy
do you think that would go here ? 1910510_1922350
do you think they coul@i +//. 1910510_1922350
oh, that is a different one . 1911530_1913100
okay . 1911530_1913100
hm . 1912430_1912980
yeah . 1915300_1915990
I think people would have the same reaction here that they had to
do you think it would be +//. 1923940_1924930
yeah . 1925010_1925730
<the Shadysi@i> okay, so people would be even &=breath more
yeah . 1926050_1927500
yeah . 1926050_1927500
yeah . 1928880_1929400
uhm@fp what I found interesting is that the Daily_Mail uhm@fp
and for the most part , people were half and half on
they either really hated it, &=breath and thought it was too
&=breath uhm@fp the other half thought it was beautiful, unique . 1930670_1956980
it was a nice piece of art, like &=breath in &=breath the
well, I'm not saying I love it, but I don't find it <as pro@i>
but you don't find it +//. 1958140_1959310
<did you f@i> do you find it more offensive than the one I
uhm@fp no . 1963690_1965100
no . 1965250_1972280
&=breath but not you wouldn't find this one more offensive
tequila ad would be more offensive than this one ? 1965250_1972280
oh, much more to my sense, yeah . 1972120_1973950
uhm@fp . 1974650_1975300
yeah, I think that tequila ad is pretty much <top of the>
it is up there ? 1979940_1980700
<it is not the most> people aren't calling it the most
really . 1984880_1985690
the Durex condom ad . 1985910_1989850
you guys both took the survey, so you know what I'm talking about,
yeah . 1989400_1989980
yeah, I didn't f@i +//. 1989920_1990860
that one is most offensive . 1990110_1991770
which which one was that ? 1991000_1992480
&=smack that was with the couple, right ? 1992240_1993770
I don't remember that one . 1994740_1995770
couple . 1995600_2000750
&=smack &=breath uh@fp a lot of girls hes@fp don't like this ad . 1995600_2000750
so, was it in Britain, was it mostly men or mostly women who wrote
I think it was half and half, really . 2008190_2024300
I mean, I read some letters <that they> the ones that they
&=breath one guy said &=breath his wife died recently and this
&=breath and I thought that was a little strange . 2008190_2024300
&=breath and he was like, fift@i almost fifty years old or

&=laugh . 2021300_2022070
oh . 2023830_2024600
well, maybe he had a young wife . 2024210_2026380
&=laugh . 2024210_2026380
I I don't know, but <that was really> I thought that was
&=breath uhm@fp most of the women liked it, some women did not like
&=breath but, of the surveys that I'm conducting, of the

&=laugh . 2026250_2026970
&=noise yeah . 2042440_2044950
sure . 2042440_2044950
&=smack well, no, <I don't> I &=smack I guess I

&=smack oh, yeah . 2063150_2065250
soccer ads, I remember this . 2063150_2065250

I'll explain . 2079420_2089130
&=breath so, &=breath guys are all naked . 2079420_2089130

I think it is the Canadian soccer team . 2079420_2089130
<I think that is why > some Canadian soccer team won a
&=breath I think that is why I got Canada stuck in my head . 2079420_2089130
some of them are pretty ugly . 2089550_2090660
well, they're all naked in any case . 2092070_2095350
but they're all hiding themselves, right ? 2092070_2095350
right . 2095010_2095520
so, it is an ad for Adidas . 2095720_2120930
&=swallow they went before Sports_Illustrated and said, will you

&=breath anyway, it is <a wom@i> <kind of a> <a f@i>
mhm . 2125280_2125900
uh+huh . 2148930_2149460

I think +//. 2156940_2167970
I don't know . 2166540_2167320
I know that the German women's water ball team did something like
uhm@fp I think +//. 2171260_2172640
I don't know if it was after this . 2172080_2173880
but +//. 2172080_2173880
well, &=breath &=smack <a group of older women in England>
<you could actually> I actually almost bought it . 2173940_2213350
you could uhm@fp uhm@fp buy the calendar here . 2173940_2213350
&=breath they all got together and got naked and they're like
&=swallow <and they put themselves> I mean, they had a

&=breath uhm@fp one woman is wearing all her pearls . 2173940_2213350
&=breath and they're completely naked . 2173940_2213350
and the idea was oh, we'll sell them to our friends and family . 2173940_2213350
&=breath we'll make some money and they gave it to charity . 2173940_2213350
and they ended up selling over half a million of these calendars,
in America, too ? 2212380_2214130
or just in +//. 2212380_2214130
<in Amer@i> I I almost bought it in America . 2213740_2255830
&=breath for leukemia and <it made> <I foun@i> I heard
&=breath uhm@fp &=breath but they &=laugh they said they had
&=laugh they wouldn't do it &=breath without the wine . 2213740_2255830
&=breath uhm@fp but it really caused <quite a> little bit
&=breath uhm@fp <but a lot of the husbands> I mean, th@i
all the husbands thought, yeah, that is a great idea . 2213740_2255830
&=breath and they sort of started a chain reaction in England and
so, I know a fireman's organization in England did the same thing .
&=breath and I've read some other organizations have done it . 2213740_2255830
&=laugh . 2225720_2226310
it is always all women, or do they do men, too ? 2254960_2256890
no, just whatever the organization is, and they get together . 2256930_2259850
oh . 2258700_2262230
<it is like> so like men or women . 2258700_2262230
ju@i oh, okay . 2258700_2262230
oh, okay . 2259770_2260520
so, like, men firemen got together and put themselves in normal
&=laugh . 2265170_2266130
oh, if it sells . 2266420_2268140
&=laugh . 2266420_2268140
s@i sold quite a lot . 2268180_2269490
that hes@fp that reminds me of what is going <out in the>
uhm@fp there was an article in Harper's a month or two ago . 2269000_2340010
there is a &=breath <I think i@i> I don't know if it is an

&=breath and uhm@fp they got together and &=breath like, I think
and it was &=breath uhm@fp I think it was like all black and
&=breath and then <I s@i> I read in the last week or two
&=breath and she, like, got off the horse and made the comment
mhm . 2341110_2341760
so, that is &=breath sex sells . 2341650_2343980
yeah, it does . 2344320_2345810
but not men . 2344320_2345810

well, they're also not, like posing in the way that the women often
&=laugh . 2348550_2353490
yeah . 2351120_2351600
the yeah, they're not really doing anything, the way a woman
&=breath uhm@fp &=smack &=breath there is an organization, I'm
&=breath and they conducted a survey in the US, Europe and Asia,

&=breath and not only did they ask them, do you like this painting
do you like the figure posed or in an action shot ? 2351520_2437140
&=breath and more importantly for this situation, &=breath they
&=breath they also asked if they liked the people to be naked or
uhm@fp <overwhelmingly in most countries> &=breath hes@fp
&=swallow or uhm@fp they did prefer them to be nude over not being
&=breath in the US it was over <sixty t@i> sixty two percent
&=breath and then the rest of the majority was doesn't matter .
&=breath so, I'm gonna put up these <for some> for the

&=laugh . 2355470_2356430
so, this is not for an advertisement . 2437500_2440050
this is just, like, if you're gonna +//. 2437500_2440050

uhm@fp yeah, I think for France they didn't give them an option
hm . 2495030_2495600
I know . 2495640_2496450
some countries they didn't give them an option . 2496090_2514470
they made them choose, I don't know why . 2496090_2514470
&=breath uhm@fp no, I I don't know why this is . 2496090_2514470

&=laugh . 2514200_2517360
not by much . 2515550_2520640
I <I wonder> I wonder how statistically significant those
well, the World_Wide_Web thing looks kind of +//. 2521590_2524100
but this is sort of everybody in general, and it is almost twice as
well . 2526090_2529880
&=breath <it is> th@i that is kind of uh@fp I mean +//. 2526090_2529880
it is more than twice as much, isn't it ? 2529460_2532010
it looks like more . 2529460_2532010
yeah, <that would be> uh@fp the web . 2531390_2533360
that would be s@i +//. 2531390_2533360
<it is almost> it is a little over twenty percent for women,
yeah . 2536220_2546570
&=breath but then <the w@i> the web is I would guess it is
maybe not in America, but I would guess most other countries
yeah . 2536770_2537290
yeah, I don't know anything about how they did the survey . 2544820_2547390
yeah . 2547310_2547850
<I don't> I don't even know . 2547780_2552120
wh@i I mean, I'm assuming the World_Wide_Web is just everybody

yeah . 2550760_2551340
I wanna know how they collected their sample . 2552020_2556060
I'd want to know how how they collected their samples . 2552020_2556060
hm ? 2553750_2554210
I don't know . 2555330_2563910
&=smack <it didn't say in the> they just had the results
maybe if I bought it, &=laugh it would tell me . 2555330_2563910
but +//. 2555330_2563910
yeah . 2556260_2556780
&=laugh &=breath fork over the bucks . 2562330_2564990

&=smack &=breath uhm@fp but, I mean, even though the differences

yeah . 2570260_2570810
yeah . 2573320_2573920
yeah, but America and Germany look very similar . 2574820_2577510
mhm . 2577510_2585510
&=smack but you know something, like, if they were forced to make
yeah . 2577980_2578460
yeah, that would be interesting if they didn't give them a choice .
hm . 2586350_2586890
if they didn't give them the answer for it doesn't matter ? 2587050_2589270
&=smack yeah . 2588770_2589390
mhm . 2589120_2589680
but maybe, I mean, what what those graphs suggest to me is
that what ? 2605310_2606000
a <what that> what what the graphs least the is
oh, right, yeah . 2609250_2610150
it is not a factor . 2612560_2613660
&=smack it is <not a> <not a v@i> not a real big factor .
right . 2614860_2616750
but +//. 2614860_2616750
which <is not really> doesn't get at the question I think
right . 2619050_2620610
uhm@fp . 2619050_2620610
well, why do you guys think there is a double standard ? 2623160_2625060
hm . 2635860_2636450
because there are many many sperm and <very f@i> relatively
&=laugh I think that &=breath that is &=breath hes@fp probably
uh+huh . 2643510_2645260
okay . 2643510_2645260
&=laugh &=smack I don't know, that sounds so very biological .
xxx xxx +//. 2646850_2653710
well, we're biological entities . 2653380_2656380
&=laugh . 2653380_2656380
yeah, but we also have more sense than just to think about
well, you would hope . 2664580_2667370
but I mean +//. 2664580_2667370
well, you can think of it this way, that you know, if you take
&=breath and most of those people the ones reading Cosmopolitan,
so, &=smack I think the double standard exists because there is
not for something sexual, but just to compare themselves to the
&=breath that, hm@fp for some reason, human nature, we prefer to
&=breath I mean, all throughout time, painters have preferred
yeah . 2679070_2679560
right, right . 2679760_2680360
hm . 2702570_2703090
'cause we just look better, or something . 2716060_2718680
&=laugh . 2716060_2718680
yeah, they just look better . 2717630_2718880
I think women are much more beautiful than men . 2718600_2722230
&=laugh that is just my opinion . 2718600_2722230
&=laugh . 2720500_2721250
oh, yeah . 2720660_2721630
they're better at posing, too . 2723170_2724710
yeah, yeah . 2724260_2730550
they just look better . 2724260_2730550
they look better when they're dancing, <they jus@i> they look
&=breath but +//. 2724260_2730550
well, I don't think it is something biological, I really don't . 2729730_2732410
well, I mean, <I think it> I think it all has its base in
I mean, I I think you're right . 2732230_2736610
hm@fp yeah, but I don't think it is all specifically biological
<you t@i> you're right . 2738180_2742410
I mean, <it is> there are definitely social +//. 2738180_2742410
but I <I agree w@i> &=breath maybe it is just the women
but I agree with that &=breath I think people do have more of a

hes@fp &=breath I don't know that it has as much to do with
yeah . 2752840_2753390
well, it +//. 2760710_2761390
well, the paintings may also be a different issue than some of the
yeah, yeah, yeah . 2762840_2767970
I mean, the ads have a very different function than paintings .
uhm@fp . 2764640_2765340
right . 2766550_2767070
right . 2767920_2797150
&=breath uhm@fp &=breath <well I guess> I mean you can
we like to see other women be happy, or we like to see images of

&=breath men, naked women appeals to them . 2767920_2797150
&=breath they don't really care what a woman is doing for them,
&=laugh not in in the short term, maybe in the long term . 2767920_2797150
&=smack &=breath uhm@fp so, maybe it does have a basis in biology .

&=laugh . 2779490_2780190
&=laugh . 2786850_2787350
well, <I think> yeah . 2796550_2799310
I think absolutely . 2796550_2799310
it has a basis in biology . 2796550_2799310
uhm@fp but <I don't think that is> I don't think biology is
what &=breath +//. 2799380_2799880
that is also true . 2803960_2805510
I think you're right . 2803960_2805510
oh, yeah . 2804910_2805620
it if was that simple I wouldn't be up here talking to you now . 2806920_2811970
they would've figured it out long ago . 2806920_2811970
yeah . 2808970_2822210
&=breath well, uhm@fp hes@fp <kind of> one interesting thing,
&=laugh . 2809770_2811280
did I talk +//. 2823120_2823990
I thought you brought that up with me . 2823670_2841580
&=breath it is reversed there, you know . 2823670_2841580
<it is> it is the man . 2823670_2841580
and <in many> &=breath I think it is in many other species,
you know, the one that is showy more showy, yeah . 2823670_2841580
&=breath uhm@fp and the one that presumably is nicer <for the>
yeah . 2826150_2829030
well, sea horses . 2826150_2829030
sea horses . 2830340_2831310
yeah . 2830710_2831290
birds . 2833910_2835300
most birds . 2833910_2835300
well, I think men also are very, very &=breath &=noise &=smack very
they're very interested in their appearance, but &=breath hes@fp
<that you're not really gonna so easily se@i> I think it
&=breath where I think advertisers are beginning to understand that
&=breath 'cause for hes@fp years they have not &=breath said, hey
w@i yeah, they do, they say hey, women, you can look like this
&=breath because women wanna look beautiful . 2841070_2902350
&=breath men traditionally don't . 2841070_2902350
they wanna look beautiful enough to get the girl and that is it . 2841070_2902350
they want a beautiful girl, &=breath women wanna look beautiful
&=smack &=breath but it is not that simple, but for so long that is
it doesn't take a lot of effort to put a woman holding her
huh . 2841450_2841910
mhm . 2863120_2863670
but they don't do it because it doesn't take much effort, they do
no, they do . 2904340_2905320
no, they do . 2905710_2915180
&=breath in advertising, the first thing we learn is there are
cute kids, cute dogs, and sex . 2905710_2915180
&=laugh . 2915870_2916340
I mean, <it does not> &=breath it it doesn't take much to
&=breath oh, look at this . 2917040_2939810
I'm holding this . 2917040_2939810
or, some woman wear scantily clad holding the same thing .
&=breath <it doesn't> that does@i doesn't take any
&=breath it is well proven that it &=laugh works . 2917040_2939810
&=breath but to come up with a really interesting ad that is gonna

hm@fp yeah . 2926630_2927230
oh . 2939450_2939980
mhm . 2940280_2940880
for how long did Budweiser sell their beer with scantily clad

<is there> is there any sense that that uh@fp
yes . 2968470_2971740
yes, definitely . 2968470_2971740
&=breath in the eighties, I think . 2968470_2971740
so people just look less because you see it all over, or ? 2970790_2974590
yeah, yeah, <you just> I can see it on the next page, why
people are just hm@fp +//. 2974080_2975180

mhm . 2982430_2982970
yeah . 2982800_2983260
uhm@fp but in America <it is> we haven't really reached it the
&=breath we don't have it on T V . 2983340_3002400
it still grabs our attention, not as much as it did before . 2983340_3002400
&=breath and I think, hes@fp you know , my theory, &=breath
now they're not . 2983340_3002400
what used to sell everything ? 3002610_3004020
scantily clad women were used to sell everything . 3003660_3029480
beer, &=breath uhm@fp pizza, anything . 3003660_3029480
'cause it worked, but then everyone got tired of it, it didn't work
so they have to go to something else . 3003660_3029480
&=breath and what &=breath the trend is nowadays and what we learn
and that is the way you're really gonna get people's attention,
&=breath you put a scantily clad woman on it, not everyone is gonna
maybe a few people will, but not everybody . 3003660_3029480
&=swallow and you want everybody, men and women . 3003660_3029480
mhm . 3005780_3006310
look at it, but they won't remember it . 3028060_3029930
