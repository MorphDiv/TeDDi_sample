um Typus this is the one that . 390440_392370
Tsk oh wait I also have one quest- . 392440_393550
There are . 392960_393190
there are two . 393300_394160
there are two problems that I've sort of been working on in . 394780_397300
you know in e- w- . 397490_398470
off and on &=breath . 398700_399650
um one is . 399800_401020
you have three schools . 401380_402820
exactly n people at each school . 403050_405180
each person at each school knows at least n@l plus one of two n@l
Prove that there at least three people who all know each other
That . 415950_416190
yeah . 416450_416750
oh you know who you should talk to about that one . 416900_418680
Dave ? 420160_420600
No . 421190_421820
Who ? 422820_423300
Let's see . 424080_424960
Who do we know that's into statistics . 425120_427470
Steve ? 429010_429850
That's not statistics .
It's a combinatorical problem . 430180_432740
That's statistics . 433000_433990
There's a there is . 433310_434120
No . 435190_435820
Yes &-um set set sets of n@l probability +/. 435920_439160
&=breath . 436170_436320
+, is probability and statistics .
Probabil- . 439470_440960
No no no .
It's not probability it . 440530_442450
No I know .
But . 442310_443120
prove that that it must . 442610_444550
It involves stati- i- . 444920_446110
Right .
But I I mean I've gotten I've . 445340_446970
like . 447150_447570
e- there &=laughs I tried I tried the simplest way to solve it and
that isn't . 451880_452350
that isn't enough . 452540_453700
&=breath And then I'm working on the second one which says
okay . 457340_457830
at the first school you have n@l people who know n@l plus one . 459040_462260
people . 462370_462880
&=breath out of two n@l people . 463030_464350
That means that they know n@l squared plus n@l &=laughs &-um of two
<they're right yeah> . 468320_468970
I I I it's not going to make any sense until I sit down with a
Like . 470140_470320
okay . 472420_472900
okay well . 473040_473770
That's the only way I understand maths is like . 473450_475460
okay . 475240_475690
I don't . 475910_476190
Sorry . 476180_476620
until I've worked on it . 476970_477920
I like . 478840_479310
No it depends on how complicated i- . 479840_480930
okay well I'll I'll send you e- if you want I'll send you these two
yeah . 484700_485080
That would be good because . 485710_486480
Because . 485970_486520
because it's like . 486900_488030
e- . 488170_488310
e- they're they're w- . 488450_489530
they're not difficult problems &=breath . 489680_491710
And . 491920_492360
and I understand exactly what's happening in them . 493110_495240
um or I mean I understand plenty of what's happening .
I'msure there's there's a_lot more that I don't understand or else
um . 503420_503980
xxx . 504740_505020
&=breath but i- it's it's really fun but really &=laughs . 505800_509020
but e- I wish it it were were going more quickly &=breath . 509160_511790
um . 511970_512419
But I I'm just . 513320_514640
I'm really really happy this person . 514770_516950
you know posted this list of things . 517229_519159
And the the really the really cool thing about it is &=breath . 519280_522460
yeah . 519360_519640
um . 522669_523260
like . 523580_523830
there are a_lot_of problems that . 524430_526210
like there are some problems that that because of the geometry
I was able to to . 530660_532020
like give answers to immediately . 532300_534210
&=breath . 534360_534610
And then there are others . 534770_536100
What happens if you cut a Moebius strip in half ? 535230_537110
yeah . 537640_538250
Now what does happen ?
E- I'm no- I'm not sure on that one .
I haven't . 538360_540710
D- do you did did you did you save that list someplace ? 540330_543240
I have the . 543640_544350
um U R L . 544820_545570
&=breath okay . 546690_547410
xxx . 547350_547590
Because because e- what I could do with the problems that I'm
give you the numbers if you +/. 551210_552500
yeah, let's see .
I'm trying to . 552500_553930
+, wanted to look at them . 552640_553620
That would I mean that would be easier . 554370_555800
Now . 556000_556230
But . 556280_556500
xxx . 557050_557340
I I actually I have stuff saved in a text xxx . 557380_560370
Would it be too simplistic to say you just get two Moebius strips ?
xxx huh ? 564530_565140
I said if we're cutting the Moebius strip in . 565410_566990
in half . 568300_568720
wouldn't you just get two Moebius strips ? 568940_570470
No, that's not what happens . 572290_573560
W- why not ? 574830_575710
Cut a Moebius strip in half and you'll see . 575930_578090
But w- . 578130_578610
cut cut in half which way ? 578860_579960
Lengthwise . 582860_583580
okay, yeah . 583980_584710
That I didn't . 584960_585590
Draw draw a line in the midde- . 585410_587550
oh wait never mind .
yeah .
That wouldn't work . 586960_588770
The the . 587850_588370
draw a line in the middle of the Moebius strip and cut . 588540_591370
along that line . 591530_592300
W- okay I . 593250_594680
Yes . 595140_595530
That's right .
I see what part of the problem would be then . 595780_597700
&=breath And and the thing that probably was the most humbling
&=breath . 603550_603780
is you know the . 603930_604910
the description of . 605630_606660
of the xxx circle in Boston . 606730_608620
yeah I saw that . 609100_610080
um . 609500_609910
Eye to the eye . 610770_611590
yeah &=breath . 612690_613400
&=breath . 613920_614760
Wait . 614780_614970
ah &=breath . 614910_616040
&=breath and . 616130_617310
I don't know I I I've never dealt with imaginary xxx so I'm not
yeah, I mean well it has to do with complex numbers .
And Igot . 620290_623910
When hen I get back I I . 624080_625840
I . 625990_626370
can try to explain it . 626500_627540
it to you because . 627760_628780
someone did explain it to me .
And i- . 629200_630930
i- . 631280_631710
&=breath I I don't completely understand it but I think . 633340_636070
Now I want to figure it out . 636640_637630
After going through xxx . 636820_638430
I I . 638050_638700
know enough about complex numbers that . 638880_640860
I theoretically should have a clue if I like . 641230_643690
okay, well I certainly I I &=breath . 643120_645420
maybe then then you can when I get back explain everything you know
It's been a long time . 650380_651290
um xxx . 650670_651330
Well &=breath . 652720_653420
between now and then you can figure it all out again . 653600_655950
Cool I'm really hoping whoever it was that hit my page in the
Like . 661990_662280
they were looking at it three times so . 663200_665350
Three times . 665930_666860
Yes . 666900_667330
How do you know it was the same person ? 667950_669160
It was . 669440_669930
It was like three times like in a row so it was like you_know
That's really weird . 675660_676710
&=breath . 678410_678620
Well I mean this is this is when they're making decisions .
So &=breath it's entirely possible that you'll get a job at the
But . 686660_686940
you know . 687850_688340
that would be . 690140_690700
