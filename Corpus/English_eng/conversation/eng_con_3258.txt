it is equal to three hundred and sixty degrees ? 0_1386
yes, okay, how how you got such answers ? 1386_5353
why do you write down one hundred and eighty degrees plus one hundred and eighty degrees ? 5353_11258
okay, angle a@l plus angle b@l plus angle c@l plus angle D@l . 11258_14283
do you find that it is equal to uh, a@l one plus a@l two plus angle b@l plus b@l, angle c@l is equal to c@l one plus c@l two, can you get it ? 14283_23201
&=bell and then plus D@l . 23201_24673
can you get it ? 24673_26105
and do you find that a@l one plus c@l one plus D@l is equal to one hundred and eighty degrees ? 26105_32865
a two plus b@l and then plus c@l two is equal to one hundred and eighty degree . 32865_37185
okay, we stop here . 37185_38858
for a four sided polygon, we find that, we can cut the four sided polygon into two triangles . 38858_48038
cut it into two triangles, so we got that the sum of interior angles is equal to the sum of the angles of two triangles . 48038_58863
can you get it ? 58863_59336
okay, take out your textbook . 59336_61101
we'll try to find out how to find the sum of interior angles of a pentagon, a five sided polygon . 61101_70101
turn to page thirty one . 70101_71190
page thrity one . 71190_72988
okay, you try to work out the class practice number one . 72988_78680
you can discuss with your classmate . 78680_81390
how to find the pentagon ? 81390_83445
okay, number one, it says, the &~dif given figure shows a pentagon a@l b@l c@l d@l e@l . 83445_88020
and then turn to page thirty two . 88020_89650
it asks you to do something . 89650_91548
okay ? 91548_95235
try to follow the question and work out the sum of interior angles of a pentagon . 95235_104540
uh, help me to to to clean the board . 104540_109561
please . 109561_110731
number one . 110731_115650
uh +... 115650_123121
is it done by you ? 123121_126353
no . 126353_127001
no, okay, you you clean it . 127001_128138
you you you you have to uh, uh do it by yourself . 128138_131671
okay . 131671_132555
uh, is it done by you ? 132555_139210
it is not done by you ? 139210_142951
yes . 142951_143856
yeah, yes . 143856_144851
&=bell okay, we uh, I I say you you you try to finish this number one first . 144851_173306
we don't do number two . 173306_174640
you try to finish number one to find out the sum of interior angles of a pentagon . 174640_180535
okay . 180535_188031
okay, uh, because it is time time's up . 188031_194581
so we have a quick look at number one . 194581_198353
okay, uh, first of all . 198353_204163
first of all, we have a pentagon . 204163_213496
it is a@l b@l c@l d@l e@l, is it ? 213496_217658
okay, and then turn to page thirty two . 217658_219755
what does it say for question a@l ? 219755_222560
if two diagonals are drawn from vertex a@l to the nonadjacent vertices c@l and d@l, how many triangles are formed ? 222560_231901
it asks you to draw from vertex a@l to vertices c@l and d@l . 231901_239095
how many triangles are formed ? 239095_240916
three . 240916_241580
three . 241580_242076
okay, number b@l . 242076_244203
what is the sum of the angles in each triangle ? 244203_247426
one hundred +... 247426_248668
