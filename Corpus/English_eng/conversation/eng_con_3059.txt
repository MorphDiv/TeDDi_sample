what that one . 6200_6750
okay . 7670_7870
is it this is the core . 7960_8940
is that the way it's supposed to be . 9190_10710
yeah . 10920_11050
so how how does that work here . 11250_12820
it does it . 14140_15220
oh so so the first one is not a copy core huh . 16030_19380
that . 20390_20630
that's . 22180_22550
okay . 23310_23450
it left one fourth . 24100_25070
<and then> and then it was copy . 25640_30820
goes like that copy fourth copy four copy core . 31670_35980
then &-um &-uh turn that one fourth . 36670_38980
oh yeah . 39170_39270
and then copy further . 39580_40630
then turn the one fourth copy . 40680_41880
turn that foot happy . 42830_43820
turned that front . 44460_45380
okay . 45630_45870
but notice what you is . 46300_49310
it better . 49360_49630

better . 54840_54950
what what's better . 55000_55510
what do you mean . 55560_55980
better . 56000_56130
like . 56390_56530
like it first it's this one . 58130_60660
then first it's that first this one . 61030_64750
then it's that one . 64800_65700
first then it's this one together . 65850_67980
then it's this . 68190_68980
and it keeps . 69830_70340
alternating back and forth there . 72450_73940
yeah . 74030_74150
well you need to work on your third one . 75980_78150
well how are you deciding on the the one you're working on . 78660_81020
now how the fourth . 81040_81910
&-um <we're just> we're just sort of looking to it . 82580_86820
sort of looking to it . 87790_88750
and once you finish this one I'll spark it for you . 89360_92060
you have to finish that one . 95600_97230
Danielle so what is the pattern of your next one then . 97880_102070
yeah . 104040_104140
which one are you working on now . 104160_105270
that one . 105830_106270
okay . 107270_107360
she's working . 107650_107990
so how did you . 108140_108490
she's working on the third one . 109170_110580
she can finish that . 111050_111580
oh she's copying what you have there . 111750_113420
mhm . 113620_113900
I'm sure she can tell us what the pattern is . 115300_117260
yeah . 118510_118590
I can . 119200_119320
how can you describe the pattern on on &-uh that you've
I don't really want it . 124600_125670
let Danny do it too . 126260_127140
okay . 127310_127410
okay . 127670_127820
you good . 128479_128740
de first we started out with this one . 129620_135750
then we first we started out with that one . 136390_139390
then we . 139440_139680
uhhuh . 139760_139940
then we did two different two the same two different two the same
then then it would've been two the same . 146750_148690
what what do you mean by two different . 149590_150870
the same . 151260_151430
let me see that again . 151700_152630
here's is this the core square . 153410_154660
yeah . 155910_156070
that's one core . 156580_157390
square . 157480_157660
okay . 157910_158150
and then what did you do to for this one . 158200_160660
these two are two different . 161730_164190
see that one's good . 165300_166180
not on red . 166300_166950
and then <that one> that one <that ones> that ones green .
that one where red . 173110_174810
and then that one's green that one . 175260_176660
okay . 177600_177820
but how did you . 178220_178700
how did you decide or or if we look at this core square again
what's what's the second &-uh square . 184220_186680
how did how does how did you get to the second square again . 188130_190580
by copying the core . 191940_192990
oh oh okay . 193600_194380
how_about the to the &-uh . 195340_197100
how did you get from the core square to the third square . 198700_203540
I dunno . 207400_207910
mhm . 208380_208730
well there's a core square . 209510_210500
mhm . 210700_211100
think . 211930_212230
and this one . 213380_213710
yeah I just . 213760_214190
think . 214250_214480
you just think . 215180_215540
well . 215950_216180
can you tell me how I don't understand how you got there there
just think . 220670_221350
just think . 221930_222380
how did we . 225180_225790
&-um . 226580_226750
I don't know they're supposed to tell they're telling you . 227240_230870

okay . 232140_232230
sure . 233380_233530
yeah . 234350_234500
so what I'm looking at is is &-um &-uh Danielle said that we go
from the core square to the second one . 244000_245540
we just did a copy core . 245560_246860
I think I could see that . 247760_248470
no . 248520_248590
did dare touch that . 248640_249150
gold fish . 249200_249660
I only got four . 249880_250420
good . 250910_251050
okay . 252830_252960

it's a copy . 255920_256550
court . 256600_256899
yeah . 257839_257980
copy court . 258260_258660

the third one though . 263640_264300
'cause we just . 265910_266130
how did you get to the third one . 267420_268660
&-um I don't quite understand . 269500_271210
well this one to to get the second one . 274150_276860
you did a copy cord . 276880_277830
mhm . 278060_278460
what did you do to to get the third one . 278630_280710
the third one . 281060_281770

okay . 290950_291220
so then the and then the fourth one . 293760_295350
and then we just copied core . 296100_297940

Danny let's book this up here . 413010_414350
Danny what did you do . 415280_416060
just here's the core . 416940_417780
square . 417890_418060
didn't do anything . 418080_418720
what what how did you . 418830_419540

she messed up . 426960_427460
show me what you did . 428840_429460
I one . 429600_429850
oh on this one . 430330_430820

yeah . 435210_435310
okay . 435530_435740
now this one . 435780_436430
what did you do . 437070_437470
what did you have to do for . 437520_438570
that isn't it that . 438760_439550
one what'd you have to do to the Core square to get that one . 439600_442260
ooh . 442980_443070
I meant that Core Square . 444040_446900
that isn't just a core square . 448390_449580
this is a core square . 449790_450700
this this is not a core square . 451270_452780
Danny and this is the one that's not a core square . 453090_456110
that's one . 456160_456470
so what did you have to . 456520_457300
what did you have to do to get this . 457320_458590
I dunno . 459680_460060
what did you think . 461500_461860
you tell . 462300_462480
do you remember . 463110_463460
do what . 464620_465060
well you have a core square all right . 466140_467750
so I'm wondering how you got how we got this one . 468900_471920
third court here . 473930_475770
is that a copy . 476280_476860
court . 476880_477020
I . 477740_478460
think I know how she needs that . 477770_478740
doesn't . 478760_478950
seem to match to me . 479000_479990
I think she know I know how how she needs . 480920_483110
oh like that . 483820_485110
oh and <what did> what did that . 485880_486980
what did . 487220_487500
she do that line . 487520_488270
she put there . 488740_489270
oh . 489700_489790
okay . 489920_490150
okay . 490900_491100
so what is that . 491120_491750
how did you . 492340_492600
how did you change the core to get there . 492780_494260
turning it left . 496040_497070
one fourth that when the fourth look see like that . 498220_504440
mhm . 505170_505400
turn it right . 505830_506890
one fourth . 507280_507670
turn it right . 508010_508540
one fourth . 508620_509020
okay . 509550_509820
alright . 510110_510290
I know know we get the do today today . 510840_516600
can I not touching this fish wall . 517440_521419
I touched it . 522360_522850
not down . 524110_524980
did not match their plan paper . 525470_527050
or . 528340_528430
I noticed it . 528560_529270
and and then they kind of jiggled around . 529780_531340
and they all thought . 531440_531840
oh we'll be able to fix this just by turning the strips . 531960_533870
and then they got one side of it to look the way it was supposed to
but the other side still didn't . 537430_538710
hmm . 539080_539120
so we used their little paper strip manipulative to check . 539350_541710
and all the strips that they had flipped then done with
those were accurate . 546320_546980
so you see that three are still there . 547330_548540
but all the ones where they were planning to copy their strip . 549060_551980
they really hadn't copied their strip . 552580_554100
they had done the the arrangement of the first two foursquares
and then repeated that two more times . 557020_558510
and in their original strip each of those two &-um each pair o
