well, it was two men .
and one of them was a policeman .
he had met this other fellow .
and they met .
and one of them, not the policeman .
but the other one .
<lit his cigar> struck a match .
and lit a cigarette .
and so the other fellow, he tried to recognize did he know him .
and <the policeman said> he told the policeman +"/.
+" it's been but five years since he's seen him, I think .
and so anyway, they went on .
and they went separate ways, I think .
and then this fellow, the policeman went around the corner later .
and he had changed clothes .
and he changed clothes .
and he met up with the same fellow again .
and they got to talking .
and then in the meantime, he lit another .
struck a match to light a cigarette .
he struck a match .
and a reflection showed that he recognized him .
recognized him from the first time, I think .
and <that's about> to tell the truth, that's all .
and I can't keep all the rest of it in my mind .
well, I can tell a story about the experience that I had when I
and we had a great time which was the first trip that I had went on
we went to some part of Mexico and Jamaica .
and I enjoyed it .
experience that I had never you_know had before .
and I liked the atmosphere .
I liked the people .
and the friend that we went with and everything .
and I just really enjoyed it .
I had problems in walking .
and my son inlaw he was my helper because he had sugar .
he's a diabetic .
and he was pushing me in a wheelchair practically all the time .
and so we were gone, I think, from Sunday to Sunday .
and I bought a_lot_of gifts .
and just like I said .
I really enjoyed it for my first experience .
and my granddaughter is planning on taking me to Las_Vegas for next
so I'm just lucky .
and I'm just happy about it .
