doing they created those . 980_2070
&-um and that's designing . 2660_4180
but when we asked them yesterday to talk about what makes a good
you know that's interesting . 8340_9180
that's interesting . 9620_10510
yeah . 10770_10870
it was a we were sort of worried yesterday Steve and I that we
and they were really pretty good at making them . 20820_22990
mhm . 23040_23340
but the question is <what what> what is the purpose of having
well . 29660_29830
&-um for one thing some of the quilts they look at are much more
now some of the patterns we looked at you know that they'll see you
just squares and right triangles half the size of the squares . 42890_47390
lots_of quilts are based on that format . 47710_49820
so I wanted them to become very familiar with those shapes and how
but other quilt designs are based on smaller shape rectangles and
and we wanna do that . 61650_62260
and also I didn't want them to get lockstep into you can only use
I want them to know you can use different sizes of squares
you can use rectangles . 70290_70990
and &-um I wanted to see how much they're paying attention to . 71400_75710
you know they they're starting to figure out that like a &-um Alex
the more interesting the pattern the more interesting the quilt . 80160_82350
a_lot_of them are starting to figure out the more interesting your
if it's just a checkerboard pattern that doesn't give very much
so &-um I wanted them to have some more chances to see how still
&-um and just to make that last project &-um more complicated in
I mean they'll be choosing from designs that look different than
&-um and yeah . 116900_118660
and now they have a new way of looking at the other quilt designs .
the real quilts that we see in books or in movies and tapes . 121160_123940
&-um and as a quilter right <you shouldn't> you shouldn't be
there are other design possibilities . 132160_133860
and the software allows them . 134220_135990
once we get into beyond quilt families and quilt strips . 136070_138900
and they get really familiar . 139230_139980
and we go to designing quilts . 140000_141490
it allows (th)em to grow and shrink things . 142150_143900
and what they can do is take that square . 144380_145500
shrink it down to a fourth and get a checkerboard design . 145780_149020
or they can &-um shrink those triangles and do that . 149460_152380
and they do a_lot_of that as I've in my kids last year really got
without this experience . 161390_162500
I don't know if they would take to that as readily on online when
Realiz . 168420_168580
that there's a_lot_of possibility for this . 168800_170300
right . 170320_170510
there's a_lot_of possibilities . 170600_171580
and you can use smaller shapes and those thinking about . 171850_174500
well this square I could think of as for smaller squares or this
&-um and until they do some of that for themselves some of them
I don't think . 187080_187510
yeah . 188110_188180
and besides we'll have some really fantastic . 188400_189910
that's . 190500_190870
great . 190920_191140
when we're done I'm glad . 191190_192110
yeah . 192160_192330
and they still don't know who's in their group yet because I know
and they'd say . 199020_199470
well there's two other people . 199520_200260
we'll just pick one of their two by two designs . 200290_202150
and I want to display these two by two designs when they're
&-uh you know when they were doing the &-uh I think it was the
mhm . 211060_211350
pairs I think . 211790_212070
mhm . 212120_212240
doing the quilt strips where they were laying out a pattern . 212450_215830
&-um okay . 216550_217550
yeah . 219190_219430
but they &-uh how did how does this compare to that . 219580_223100
I mean &-uh in terms of the kids' knowledge or talking about the
oh that will be interesting . 227960_228940
(be)cause &-um instead_of just copying the two by two nine times
their group has to take those nine two by two designs . 239670_241710
and they have to decide . 242110_242990
how are we gonna we're not gonna make (th)em flip (th)em (be)cause
but by turns in different arrangements I want them to see in that
and your nine two-way twos . 255760_256899
what can you do besides just copy it . 257149_259220
&-um nine times I'm gonna make them experiment with turns so that
but if you did a turn you could get the red orange triangles coming
what will that do to your design or . 274010_275390
how do you want to do it . 275440_276100
do you want one you know . 276120_277380
and then they'll think in terms of the strip . 277400_279060
do we want the top row of three and the bottom of a row of three to
or do we wanna do copy them all except the four corner ones or what
I'm gonna so they're gonna have to encourage them to play with
are they gonna describe this before they start laying . 300020_302860
or are they gonna start to lay out . 302980_304310
well I think . 304400_304740
they're gonna have lay it out like &-um how it would be if you just
well what could you do to change it . 310520_311950
you know we could turn to these and have their group do a_lot_of
and then they'll have to write you know what did we do with our two
so so we'll see . 329090_330210
and you know maybe they'll something will come out_of that . 330250_333450
and maybe something won't . 333470_334490
but they have more complex designs just because they had to use
and even some of them went whole hog and used loud . 339590_341610
some of them didn't ast Katie's all like rectangle . 341860_343790
yeah yeah . 344080_344370
I think so what that was . 344630_345340
or maybe she has some smaller squares . 346240_347880
buthuh . 348250_348650
but yeah different &-um different kids are approaching that in a
but they're all more comfortable with that whole design process the
and then . 360320_360620
okay I'm gonna need that manipulative or I'm not . 360640_362270
and then I go about making this two by two design . 362320_364140
and once they get in groups that will be happening even_though
they'll each know we each need to reproduce three of these two by
we know what to pay attention to . 372720_373790
and then we'll work together to put these nine two by twos together
mhm . 380760_381110
how many will work together in <three three> three . 381500_383620
mhm . 383900_384050
so they'll choose one person's design based on whatever . 384890_389300
and then they'll each make three of those two by twos that they
so I think we can still get that in before . 395620_397630
okay . 397990_398230
before the break hopefully still have time for some symmetries some
we haven't done yet . 405820_406670
do you think you they move to select the one tomorrow morning . 407500_410340
&-uh I don't think that'll happen today or if it . 412000_413990
ha maybe later today we have so many things we're finishing up . 414040_417500
and my main goal for today is to get them all on the computers as
(be)cause after they've planned several quilt families I want them
and then after they finish their &-um their final quilts they're
and working with those kinds of things . 435980_437470
so &-um that final but so how do they do that on the computer . 437700_441250
there's a place where you can design you get to design the whole
yeah . 444600_444700
&-um by making a course wearing reproducing it and filling it up .
and it lets them select other colors . 448920_450580
it's not so controlled . 450670_451940
it's not just blue and the shrinking and the enlarging and all of
so and then we'll just work on that over a large period of time . 455700_458830
there won't be any time when that needs to be done . 459140_461300
and many of them still need to work on their all of them still have
so we have a_lot_of &-um time that I wanna keep cycling as many
eight at a time over there . 471060_472080
so I don't know if we'll get to anything in groups today though we
yeah . 478320_478520
but even if we do tomorrow they could say though they'll have
see they don't know but everybody wants it to be there . 485660_487660
so they'll think of a fair way . 487680_489020
it just has to be a way . 489040_489900
the group is happy . 489940_490590
but sometimes you'll see them . 490660_492190
oh I can see Katie this is all rectangles . 492240_494660
we could get done much faster . 494730_495790
I sure I had a group do that . 496440_497690
had two squares in the course where we knew that would go really
I'm like . 502100_502350
okay . 503350_503550
but is it gonna make a finish coat you're happy with . 503930_505740
and they're like . 506220_506570
oh <yeah yeah> yeah . 506750_507370
we did change the schedule . 508540_509630
it must not . 509780_510290
have been it must've been been nine forty five . 510360_512100
oh my kids . 512770_513260
well they earned fifteen minutes of extra next's they did &-um yeah
oh no . 518470_518700
and they buble up like Eskimos I mean the way you dress second
they could stay out most of the day and not get too old . 522470_525680
&-um so we'll continue working . 526420_528260
and we have theater things to finish up . 528300_530340
and kids are taking turns working on their color wheels because
but as they're finishing they're just cycling through a_lot_of odds
we have to finish . 541080_541660
so I really don't know if they would begin building in groups today
because we can't really do much of that until they all get their
so even_though there are several kids who are finished with two by
and we're finished with the theaters . 556960_557990
and they're finished with their color wheel . 558040_559060
they'll just get more online time today . 559080_561020
I'll just have to keep using the other computers and cycling kids
and I . 567400_567580
