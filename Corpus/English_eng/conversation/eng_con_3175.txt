do a diagonal flip up and a diagonal flip this way . 0_12315
okay . 12315_13161
um show me that again . 13161_18870
Justin did use two diagonal flips but we have to be able to figure
Nicole what are you thinking ? 35000_36384
right bottom corner . 36501_43376
uhhum .43376_44327
flip it to the left top corner .44327_52857
just a second . 52857_54774
I don't think you'll have enough room to write all that .54774_56944
I'm writting it down here .56944_58488
top left corner .58488_65950
is that what you said Nicole ? 65950_67034
uhhum .67034_67897
yeah that is a lot of writing isn't it . 67897_71081
right bottom corner flip it to the top left corner . 71081_74921
so I'm taking the right bottom corner and I'm going to flip it to
why do you think it is with the computer with the quilting software
why won't it let us do something we found out about quilts which is
maybe they never heard of them . 114167_116030
maybe they never heard of them .116030_117976
do you think that's possible ?117976_119703
yeah .119703_120351
yeah .120351_120799
maybe the people that um put that um the thing didn't know about
or maybe like there is like xxx any c@l c@l like any code thing . 129708_138817
any command . 138817_139683
yeah . 139683_140081
there's not a command to +/. 140081_140853
maybe they didn't have get a computer chip . 140853_144707
it let's us do sideways flips . 144707_147124
it let's us do up down flips .147124_148713
it let's us cppy cores . 148713_150036
it let's us build build a core square . 150036_151678
it's letting you do everything you guys have been doing except for
xxx . 157209_160920
do you think that's possible ? 160920_162976
that you thought of something that the people who designed that
but then the turtle . 166832_169628
no but not the turtle .167487_169697
my students uh detemine how this unit turns out each year . 169697_175727
I mean it's definitley what they are interested in .175727_179087
what the tangents they go off on .179087_181270
the quesitons they raise .181542_183184
you know two hours can dissapear .183184_185309
and it can be something that was never written in my plans .185309_188253
but it was about quilting it was about mathamatics .188253_190536
it was comminicaiton . 190536_192706
it was it was thinking .192706_194308
and that's what we did that day .194197_195598
it's okay .195598_196297
just write the word symmetrical and then tell me what you think it
okay ? 202965_203486
we will write for a few minutes and then we'll share our ideas and
we're going to start with a story that will get us started thinking
okay .226244_227962
+" Maude measured the bedspread and marked the exact center with a
+" now listen Amelia she said .235619_237833
+" your house mustn't come past that pin .237833_241690
+" Amelia nodded understandingly as she fumbled in the work basket .
there are two places in the book that I want to reread to you real
and then um and then I want us to talk about the question that
you probably didn't hear her if you were sitting in the back
but it was a good question and you might have been thinking this
back when Amelia and Maude were first beginning . 271752_274972
um they were still in the planning stages . 274972_278533
they hadn't sewed anything yet .278533_280070
this is what Maude said .280070_281307
+" we'll each make a house .281322_283681
+" one at each end of the bedspread .283681_286160
+" then it will be symmetrical .286160_288943
and Amanda while she was listening to the story said +"/.288943_291487
+" what's symmetrical ?291487_293607
let's talk about that word symmetrical .293607_295745
who can share um share with the group . 295745_298068
what do you think ? 298068_298617
what's your guess ? 298617_299698
what do you think it might have to do with ? 299698_300919
Paul what's your guess ? 300919_302175
a house .302175_302917
okay symmetrical might be a word that only has to do with house . 302917_306313
okay . 306313_307103
what would it mean ? 307103_308104
what about houses would symmetrical have to do with ? 308104_314879
what else could be symmetrical . 314879_325188
the carpet .325248_326731
the carpet could be symmetrical .326731_328440
what would a carpet be like that was symmetrical ?328440_332191
like if it was all like grey . 332191_336238
if it was all grey it would be symmetrical . 336238_338603
what are you thinking about the word symmetrical ?338603_341185
I think symmetrical means um that our um like the same . 341177_346848
tell me more about that . 346848_348906
cause I don't know exactly what you mean when it says their the
you mean you agree with Nicole means identical . 352321_355561
exactly the same can't tell them apart .355561_357913
well you can sort of tell them apart . 357913_362157
how can you tell them apart if they're were exactly the same . 362157_364239
I expected them to come to the idea of what symmetry is much more
by linking it to things they already done . 372415_374489
folded and cut and halves that match . 374489_376655
so it took them a lot longer .376655_378631
that ah if your you know if expectations were violated and
why didn't you do that ? 388086_388819
because I'm not the one who is going to be using the word for them
so I admit I was getting worried after all of that time we really
but I knew it would come . 417945_419729
and that is why I was going +"/. 419729_420953
+" image folding this . 420953_422415
do you think a scarecrow can be symmetrical if there were only one ?
no . 426374_427539
yeah . 427539_428235
it could . 428235_429376
if um like if you could fold it over . 429376_432368
like this . 432368_433279
I'm symmetrical . 433279_434588
are you Nicole ? 434588_436051
yeah .436051_437204
so um that xxx . 437204_440346
half of it blue and half of it green . 440346_453851
so if something is has half of it blue and half of it green it
it's all blue and on the top it's all green . 458074_461450
um: okay well test that against somebody elses . 461450_467408
like Ashely's . 467408_468497
here there's a bow, a triangle, a bow, a triangle, a triangle .
can you find anything else that repeats, that makes you um do as
+" you can look anywhere in the quilt . 494877_496315
could be colors .496315_497398
could be shapes .497398_497926
it has to be something that repeats for it to be a pattern . 497926_502075
um let's see Alex what are you noticing about Ashely and Vanessia's
weird funny shapes .506334_508140
can you decribe the weird funny shape for us .508140_510980
so we'll know which one you're looking at . 510980_512588
and pointing to it would help us too . 512588_515136
but do you remember the days when I was asking you to think and
and everybody kept saying to me +"/. 528545_529696
+" I think it's right in the middle of the quilt . 529696_532454
look at middle of um just for example please look at the middle of
where's the middle of that two by two ?539759_541852
right here .541852_543046
right so is that a core square ? 543046_545915
no .545915_546792
this is a core square . 546792_548407
right here .548407_549841
that's made up of different core squares .549841_551847
okay so if we go right to the middle of a quilt do we find the core
no . 556319_556979
no .556979_557603
we don't .557426_558118
we can find the core square Kevin says +"/. 558118_559766
+" in thirty six different places . 559766_561444
is he right ? 561444_562339
yes . 562339_563059
yes . 563059_563620
thirty six different places with all the same core square . 563620_567203
