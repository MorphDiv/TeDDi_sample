I want to start with S_one's group . 7300_9620
and I've heard a lot of groups actually talking about number four . 9940_13340
number four came up a lot, of how you could break a rectangular prism into layers and add up the amount in each layer . 13720_21520
so, S_one's group, can you start by telling us what you thought about that ? 21840_26340
and I would have S_one speak first, please . 27065_29005
I think if you break it into a different layer, so there's twelve and you should multiply it times how many layers, like one layer times all the other layers, which in this case would be twelve times five . 29665_45325
okay . 45905_46145
can I have another student repeat what S_one said ? 46365_49285
how would he maybe revise strategy number four ? 49425_53205
S_two, go for it . 53905_54765
you count one layer and then you multiply it times how many other layers you have . 55025_61105
okay, S_one, is that the strategy you meant ? 61865_63885
yeah . 64245_64485
okay . 65045_65205
can someone else repeat that ? 65765_66885
S_three, go for it . 68885_70545
you break it into layers . 70705_73525
and then you count how many cubes are in the layers and then multiply it by how many layers they are . 73985_79865
okay . 80505_80845
can I have one more person repeat that for us ? 80885_82945
S_four, go ahead . 84165_84505
you see what the amount is in the layer and then you multiply it by how many layers you have in your unit, cubic unit . 84825_95745
okay . 96525_96785
so S_one, I think I'm hearing that you wanted to change, instead of saying, add up the amount on each layer, should we say, and multiply it by the number of layers ? 97065_106425
yeah . 106665_106845
would that make it work better ? 106945_107925
okay . 108145_108605
so, let's just change that and say, break it into layers . 108685_111645
and in fact, I don't even think you said necessarily break it . 113625_116005
you said count up the number of cubes in one layer, right ? 116385_119465
so let's say that . 119705_120585
count the number of cubes in one layer and multiply it by the number of layers . 121125_135645
okay . 136365_140845
so, why don't you talk to your group ? 141105_142165
and you decide if you think that that would work for any rectangular prism right now . 142185_146725
all right . 147065_147225
let's take a look at the third strategy up here . 147485_152585
whose group was responsible for number three ? 152845_155585
is that S_four's group ? 156245_157465
great . 157625_158085
okay . 158325_158485
so S_fou'sr group said to multiply the length times the width times the height . 158545_166405
okay . 167385_167645
can you describe your strategy again and why you think it works ? 168345_170925
when it says the length, you would multiply five times, times four . 171145_180065
and then you would multiply the height, which would be three . 180645_185065
and then you would get your answer and that's how we explained it . 185465_189465
okay . 189845_190145
so, you're saying that if I multiply the length times the width times the height, I would get the volume of a rectangular prism . 190385_198045
is that what you're saying ? 198205_198705
yeah . 199065_199485
could I have another student repeat S_fou'sr idea ? 199965_202145
and also, could you tell me if you agree or disagree if that would work or not ? 202705_206805
go ahead, S_five . 207285_207905
I agree with this strategy, because she said that you have to multiply the length times the width times the height . 208565_217425
and we tried that because we made two different rectangular prisms and it worked for both of them . 218185_223685
it worked for both of them to do that, when you multiplied the length times the width times the height ? 223985_227405
okay, great . 227805_228265
do I have another student who agrees or disagrees ? 228765_230585
and right now, remember we're not looking at our prisms . 230685_232885
we can look at our prisms, of course, but we're not building them right now . 232905_235325
all right, S_two, go ahead . 235405_236525
she said that you multiply the length times the width times the height . 236905_240125
and I agree because when you do that, you don't recount any . 240245_243925
because you do length and then you do the width, but they're two different ones but you have to multiply it . 244995_255435
it's like almost doing the layers, but you're doing the length times the width . 256355_260475
but you're doing in in multiplication . 260775_262095
you're saying it's actually very similar to the strategy number four, where we're doing the layers, when we're making sure we don't recount anything . 262815_270275
are strategies number four and strategy number three almost the same thing really ? 272605_276765
what do you think about that ? 277405_279825
S_six ?
yes, because number three, it's kind of just doing it just a little bit faster because number four, you have to split them into layers . 279985_291685
and then you still are going to get the right answer, the same answer . 292225_296685
but for number three, you'd have to multiply the length, the width, and the height . 297345_303425
so, it's kind of like doing the same thing, just you take away one step instead of building them apart . 304425_312225
okay . 312745_312925
so, let's see . 313065_313485
If we're counting the number of cubes in one layer, what is that the same as doing ? 313585_318085
we're taking this part of it, saying, count the number of cubes in one layer . 318725_323945
how is that the same as something in number three ? 324025_326345
S_seven ?
it's the same because you're multiplying the length times the width to get one layer . 327265_335005
okay . 335625_335845
can someone repeat that ? 336045_337045
and why is that the same ? 337325_338365
S_eight ?
it's multiplying the length by the width to get the answer . 338485_343245
okay . 343825_344025
so, if we multiply the length times the width, is that what you're saying, S_seven ? 344185_346945
that we will get the number of cubes in one layer ? 347805_350165
okay . 350345_351225
so, yeah, if we multiply the length times the width, we actually are getting the number of cubes in one layer . 351285_356985
do we agree with that ? 357185_357945
yeah . 358185_358685
and then let's go to the next step . 358905_362065
the next step is, and multiply it by the number of layers . 362385_365585
how did number three's group say that in a little bit of a different way, but it kind of means the same thing ? 367225_372245
I'll give you a second to look back at it . 374065_377745
one group said, and multiply it by the number of layers . 380695_383315
and another group said to multiply it by something else that I think might mean the same thing . 384235_389355
S_four, go ahead . 390295_392255
and the height ? 392495_394255
okay . 394655_395355
the height . 395495_395915
would someone repeat the idea that S_four just said ? 396855_399555
all right, S_two, go for it . 399855_400895
you use the length times the width times the height . 401555_406975
and it works because when you do length times width, it's like doing a layer . 406975_413055
and you're sure that it's the answer because if you just do it like this, it's like doubling what you already counted on the other side . 413615_426575
okay . 427075_427255
so, we do length times width . 427415_428515
and that does a layer . 428635_429615
and then what's that third part we have to include ? 430015_431795
you do the height . 431855_432635
and the height is just doing like how many layers . 433015_435495
the height is doing how many layers . 436355_438135
so, what you're saying, what S_four was saying and what a lot of you said was, if we do the length times the width, that tells us how many cubes are in one layer . 438995_447235
and the height is how many layers there are . 447415_449175
would S_four and S_two agree that's what you're saying ? 449275_451195
okay . 451555_452175
