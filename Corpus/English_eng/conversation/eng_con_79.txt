there was a town in New_York .
not a town .
there was a policeman .
and he was checking door knobs and so forth .
he notices a gentlemen standing in the shadows .
and of_course he slowed up .
and xxx prepared hisself for the possibilities for this shadowy
xxx someone bad .
so he had words with the gentleman .
and then apparently the two of the gentlemen was there waiting for
he hadn't seen each other in about twenty years or so .
and so he explained that to the police officer .
and the police officer introduced himself as after they got
and got a chance to talk .
and they introduced each other .
Bob was the guy that was in the shadows .
and Jim was the officer .
and they talked about different descriptions .
and things that happened in the past and that sort of thing .
and then so then Jim decides well okay .
he goes .
he walks on past .
he says +"/.
+" hey have a nice one .
+" and take care .
+" and have good luck in finding your friend .
so he walks away .
and continues going down checking doors like nothing ever happened
but Jimmy or officer Jim or whatever recognized his friend .
and also recognized the fact that he was wanted by the police .
now him being the diligent officer that he truly was .
and his mindset being in the set of truly being a snitching little
xxx went .
and called one of his plainclothes buddies .
and turned his friend in .
and the plainclothes officer came up .
and announced hisself@d as being his friend .
and literally fooled the man, .
the man realized once they started walking away .
the guy grabbed him .
and as they were walking away they looked at each other (be)cause
and he realize this guy wasn't his long lost friend .
and he was given a note by Jimmy because Jimmy wasn't man enough to
and confront the man .
and tell him +"/.
+" hey yeah man I snitched on you man .
and he hands him a note .
and the guy opens the note .
and reads it .
and says +"/.
+" hey sorry old boy .
+" you're my friend .
+" but I didn't have the heart to bust you .
+" or I didn't have the balls to bust you myself as a true man should
so he was a real traitor .
and I don't like that part about the story .
but other than that it was a pretty cool story I think .
just recently, we went to a ballgame .
Breck, my daughter and everybody came up from Atlanta .
and we all got together .
and went out .
and had fun .
and we decided that we would go out .
and get ball tickets .
and go to the Nationals game .
and it was outstanding .
and they won .
we went .
and when we arrived we had a little tête-à-tête@s:fra$n with
in any case we went in .
and we had a good time .
and the hotdogs were terrible .
the kids enjoyed the game .
they were a little restless from time to time .
I don't know .
that's about it .
and the Nationals won .
there were fireworks afterwards .
and for a minute there I wasn't sure who won .
I should have because of the fireworks .
okay .
that's about it .
I guess
