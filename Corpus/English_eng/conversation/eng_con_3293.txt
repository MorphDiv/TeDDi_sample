please teach us well . 4160_5080
please teach us well . 5080_6080
okay . 6080_8140
okay then, please take out your handouts that I handed out yesterday . 8140_24240
okay then first, look at your neighbor's sheet, and see if they have their results written and check to see if the contents are all the same . 24240_41210
check that over a little bit please .
don't worry about the way you express it . 41210_51060
since your expressions will vary from person to person .
okay then someone will be the representative and check the contents . 51060_63250
the positive terminal . 63250_68280
the negative terminal . 68280_77260
uh, I had you check the kind of gas that was generated by using things like incense and matches . 77260_92270
so I'd like to check the results from that, the name .
okay then, the positive terminal, who has the confidence to give me the answer ? 92270_96170
yes, yoji+kun . 96170_105200
okay please go ahead . 105200_107110
which one was it ? 107110_108000
the positive terminal . 108000_109190
it burned vigorously . 109190_111030
yes . 111030_113290
and ?
the name of the gas is ?
oxygen . 113290_114230
oxygen . 114230_115000
okay then, the negative terminal . 123190_130270
who is confident ?
shohei+kun . 130270_138270
you were reviewing over here just a moment ago, right ?
okay .
gas ? 138270_139220
yes . 139220_140000
hydrogen . 140250_141190
hydrogen . 141190_153100
is that okay ?
check it over okay ?
then the part for examinations and summarizations .
uh, when you exposed water to electricity . 153100_160190
daijiro+kun .
oxygen and hydrogen . 160190_161100
yes, it separates into to two separate substances of oxygen and hydrogen . 161100_175000
okay, that's the conclusion, right ?
since you expose it to electricity, you call this type of separation . 196050_208070
uh, chihiro+san .
what kind of separation is this called ?
electrolysis . 208070_209070
yes, electrolysis . 209070_214090
okay, electrolysis . 226100_228220
and this is what we did yesterday . 228220_250230
so today, what we'll be thinking is water .
being exposed to electricity, it can be separated into hydrogen and oxygen .
so what happens in the opposite ?
what I mean is if we have hydrogen and oxygen, is it possible to make water ? 250230_259090
if it was this way . 259090_264280
how would it be if the arrow was pointing this way ?
this is what I would like to consider today . 264280_271080
okay then, now discuss with your neighbors to see if you think you can make water from hydrogen and oxygen . 271080_287100
if you suppose that you can then talk about how you could do it .
so discuss in depth and think about it please . 287100_290180
if you suppose that you can't do it, then talk about why you can't do it . 290180_295040
okay then, go ahead, discuss it with your neighbors . 295040_378120
and i'll have you present your answers later, so have it a little summarized .
you are always thinking of something so unconventional . 378120_384110
looking at your textbooks &~may think of your own answer . 384110_392150
I don't want the textbook's answer .
yes . 392150_394040
what do we do ? 394040_399270
0 . 399270_401010
but this . 405160_408120
what ?
this is hydrogen and this is oxygen so . 408120_409090
yes . 409090_410060
yes .
this is the resolution that I just talked about right ? 410060_412130
that's the resolution . 412130_413210
you're thinking about the opposite right now, right ? 413210_414010
yes . 414010_415010
oh, the opposite, the opposite . 415010_416290
you've already done this in an experiment so you know you can do this . 416290_420080
i know I can do this but . 420080_422020
this way okay ? 422020_423990
the arrow .
make that the other way . 423990_424170
okay then, all I need to do is do this to this . 424170_425230
yes, so think how you can do that ? 425230_429250
if it's possible .
teacher forces it together . 429250_431120
am I going to force it together ? 431120_433290
okay then, take out your notebooks . 433290_441110
take out your notebooks and first, copy down what I wrote on the blackboard . 441110_448070
okay ? 448070_449150
below the yellow box it says: “your thoughts” “everyone's thoughts” .
so as a continuation of that, uh, summarize what you discussed with your neighbors please .
in yellow can water be made out of hydrogen and oxygen ? 449150_450010
did you write it ? 500110_502030
yes . 502030_503280
I'm surprised you got this . 503280_506060
I just wrote it how I saw fit . 506060_508120
however you saw fit ? 508120_520060
huh ? 520060_522230
hurry up and take out your notebooks and write . 522230_565110
teacher . 565110_569260
you see the equipment for the experiment in the front ?
yes, that ? 569260_570280
yes, that, rubber, rubber, what was it that we used ? 570280_575010
a pin, what was it ?
the pinchcock ? 575010_576010
yes, the connection for the pinchcock . 576010_582120
isn't it possible to take it off once, and then stick a straw in it to connect the rubber part ?
oh, like this ? 582120_583240
yes . 583240_584270
can't you do that ?
well, this side is hydrogen and this side this oxygen . 584270_589990
so that means by connecting it you do what to the hydrogen and the oxygen ?
you put them together . 589990_591060
if you put them together then you think that you can make water .
you have to put them together . 591060_593000
mix them, mix them . 593000_595120
okay then, that's one thought . 595120_597990
write that down, okay ?
is that okay ? 597990_598140
that's okay . 598140_666080
that's one kind of thought .
okay, even if it's just a little bit, write something down okay ? 666080_699030
and as that thought as the base, we'll expand on it .
okay, is there anyone who wants more time ? 699030_724210
okay then, a little longer, okay ?
and by the way, since it's rather difficult to just grab oxygen out of the air, we will be using this . 724210_735030
oxygen .
it's in here .
give it to me, teacher . 735030_736140
okay ? 736140_741130
it's in here .
now we have it but what should we do with it .
teacher, give it to me . 741130_742070
as for hydrogen, I'm thinking of making it on my own step by step . 742070_751090
I'm thinking of making it .
so I can prepare the oxygen and the hydrogen .
okay, so how will this connect to water after this ? 751090_756210
disintegration in mid+air . 756210_757240
disintegration in mid+air ? 757240_760040
teacher, can I have that ? 760040_763020
there is a limit to our resources . 763020_772150
I can't waste anymore .
what should I do about oxygen . 772150_778010
okay then, i'll start asking what you think . 778010_789120
yukawa+kun . 789120_790180
huh ? 790180_792060
yes .
okay, hydrogen and oxygen . 792060_805190
what do you do in order to .
make water ?
but first tell us whether you think water can be made or not .
which one do you think is the case ?
you can . 805190_806250
you can . 806250_816010
okay .
what do you think you should do ?
uh huh, go ahead .
cool it . 816010_817020
cool it . 817020_823000
ohh, cool it .
possible: cool it . 823000_834030
cool it . 834030_837230
oh, I see .
okay then, sakaki+san . 837230_844990
you can or you cannot do .
you can . 844990_845260
you can . 845260_848290
then the method .
warm it up . 848290_850090
warm it up . 850090_854000
totally contrastive .
warm it up . 854000_855190
you can do it . 855190_864250
hmm, hikaru+san . 864250_868130
you can or you cannot . 868130_869220
I think you can do it . 869220_870220
you can do it . 870220_872160
what's the method ?
heat it up . 872160_873240
heat it up . 873240_875000
hmm, heat it up . 878200_888080
okay then, I think i'll ask one more person . 888080_895290
lets see . 895290_901120
yumi+san .
you can do it . 901120_903190
what's the method ?
cool it . 903190_904000
cool it . 904000_907190
the method is to cool it .
yumi+san, why did you think of cooling it ? 907190_911140
oh, cool it . 923170_928220
okay then, i'll ask the whole class .
stop what you're doing please .
uh, I have hydrogen and oxygen prepared . 928220_935100
now all I have is them prepared .
so can I or can't I make water from hydrogen and oxygen . 935100_945150
raise your hands .
who thinks it can be made ?
okay, thank you . 945150_955270
who thinks that it might not be possible ?
nobody ?
you think that it can be done .
okay . 955270_965080
actually, there are many ways to make water from hydrogen and oxygen .
there are many ways . 965080_970200
in other words you can do it .
yes . 970200_977240
rather than otherwise, this type of answer is the closest . 977240_987020
I think so . 987020_989060
what about over here ? 1002060_1003010
I want to make it over there but, for convenience's sake . 1003010_1006000
teacher what about over here, over here ? 1006000_1007170
okay, then will all of you come gather over here please ? 1007170_1019220
and will the people already here put your things away .
yujiro+kun, this, this, here . 1019220_1027170
okay .
teacher, aren't you going to mix them ? 1027170_1028290
huh ? 1028290_1036050
mix it .
excuse me yoji+kun, will you make some space for me please . 1036050_1040230
no, it's a little far . 1040230_1051140
a little .
a little more, a little more okay .
you know, since I'm so thin .
let's see, kojima+kun sorry, will you turn off the light please . 1051140_1062040
okay, then first, it says to heat it, but if we just take the heating method straight up, then all kinds of difficulties arise . 1062040_1077030
why do you think that is the case ?
does it break ? 1077030_1078260
hm ? 1078260_1083230
hikaru+san, why ?
something about oxygen and hydrogen blowing up or something on that order . 1083230_1085260
or something that order ? 1085260_1088090
I don't know . 1088090_1089070
xxxboom ! 1091000_1093080
yes, right . 1093080_1096170
it goes boom, right ?
will you stick this between there ? 1096170_1101180
there, stop fooling around .
ouch ! 1101180_1103230
okay, so now in order to be safeabout heating it up, we will be using a machine like this . 1103230_1106290
ouch, ouch, ouch ! 1106290_1112100
put electricity through it . 1112100_1115080
put electricity through it .
shh . 1115080_1116030
shh . 1116030_1118200
pay attention to this part . 1118200_1120260
hey, it just snapped or something . 1120260_1123060
what are you going to do ? 1123060_1124290
that was scary . 1124290_1126140
what would happen if you put your hand in there ? 1126140_1127270
hm ? 1127270_1129200
if you put your hand in there . 1129200_1130010
shh . 1130010_1135120
can you see ?
hiromi+san can you see ?
I'm going to do it again . 1135120_1141210
so what this means is as a way of lighting it, lighting a match like this is not the only way of doing it, but using electricity like this is one way of doing it . 1141210_1151070
so we'll be using this to do it .
so what are we going to use . 1151070_1165280
something like this, one that's a little bigger than this one .
first of all, hydrogen and oxygen must meet inside of here in order to react, right ?
so we are going to have them meet . 1165280_1166990
like shinya+kun said, we are going to have them meet . 1166990_1167090
we're going to mix them ? 1167090_1169100
yes we're going to mix them . 1169100_1181240
and then after that, if you just do this really fast, then the person who lit the match will be in danger, so let's try doing it like this .
ohh . 1181240_1182290
like this . 1182290_1183990
send electricity . 1183990_1184010
scary . 1184010_1185250
yes it is scary . 1185250_1186170
look in this area, okay . 1186170_1189090
it's going to snap . 1189090_1194240
it's going to start snapping .
oh, it's not working . 1194240_1198260
wait a second, okay ?
I think it's broken, teacher . 1198260_1201070
hmm . 1201070_1205270
wait a second okay ?
it's not doing it, teacher . 1205270_1207010
it's not doing it is it ? 1207010_1208080
it might not be working . 1208080_1209230
I think you should give up . 1209230_1211180
teacher the small one . 1211180_1212010
it's okay, we don't have to give up . 1212010_1213250
this part is scary . 1213250_1214120
this part is scary .
teacher the small one xxx . 1214120_1219260
can you tell ? 1219260_1221260
can you tell ?
oh, it's doing it a little, it's doing it a little . 1221260_1223020
i don't get it because I can't see . 1223020_1225140
you don't get it because you have bad sight ? 1225140_1228060
again .
I'm going to do it again okay ?
because I can't see . 1228060_1231280
wait a second okay ? 1231280_1232290
it's not really doing it right now teacher . 1232290_1234120
wait a second okay ? 1234120_1236040
there's one more, i'll try using this one . 1236040_1242280
teacher, this one is not working too well . 1242280_1244170
right ? 1244170_1255000
it's not working too well is it ?
it was working really well .
okay, let's try it with this one .
okay .
but you understand the theory behind how this works right ? 1259040_1271080
you send electricity and spread sparks through it and .
can you tell ?
can the area near hiromi+san see as well ? 1271080_1280270
so in this way, you don't actually have to directly do this to oxygen in order to ignite it .
okay then I would now like to conduct an actual investigation . 1280270_1288290
okay then, please get some water .
taro+chan . 1288290_1292020
okay then from there, from thereget the stand, please . 1292020_1294130
that might hit aoyama and spill . 1294130_1295240
taro+chan . 1295240_1296210
matsushita . 1296210_1297280
okay, sorry . 1297280_1303180
that, that stand .
okay, naoto+kun, will you please get that test tube that's standing up . 1303180_1309110
what about oxygen, teacher ? 1309110_1311180
okay, please get the oxygen cylinder . 1311180_1320280
oh, please bring the whole thing . 1320280_1332240
okay, and then will you get the beaker with the transparent liquid inside of it, please .
try doing it . 1337060_1338000
yes, let's try doing it . 1338000_1342280
it's not working too well . 1342280_1349090
please turn off the water . 1349090_1351190
it's cold ! 1351190_1353160
teacher, where is the hydrogen ? 1353160_1357000
it's kind of scary . 1357000_1359990
it's kind of scary .
okay, thank you . 1359990_1360190
teacher xxx . 1360190_1364000
hm ? 1364000_1365220
is this putting it too far inside ?
here . 1365220_1366260
wait a second okay ? 1366260_1367010
it's long so, one more time, excuse me for a second okay ? 1367010_1372070
it's cold ! 1372070_1374140
quiet ! 1374140_1383200
teacher, you should take your hands off of it after you put it in . 1383200_1387190
okay, but this one is a little crooked but forgive me okay ? 1387190_1398160
okay, then tighten the screw right there please .
a little more, maybe we should raise it a little more .
okay .
something like this .
okay, that's good . 1398160_1401030
okay . 1401030_1409040
let's do it a little more like this . 1409040_1410280
okay then, lets first try to generate some hydrogen . 1410280_1415210
how ? 1415210_1416010
how ? 1416010_1420110
put this, in this .
don't spill it, okay ? 1420110_1425080
and then now this . 1425080_1431160
what is this colorless transparent liquid ?
ethanol . 1431160_1435140
sodium chloride . 1435140_1437270
hm ? 1437270_1440220
aoki+san, what could it be ?
yes, diluted hydrochloric acid . 1440220_1446080
it's coming out, it's coming out . 1446080_1447200
it's coming out isn't it . 1447200_1448280
however, I won't send the bubbles up the tube immediately . 1448280_1454250
why is this ?
the air, the air portion . 1454250_1457020
you have to let the air out . 1457020_1458110
that's right . 1458110_1470240
there's some air left over here so in order to make it one hundred percent hydrogen, you must first let the air inside escape .
teacher, it's not going in . 1470240_1472150
oh, sorry . 1472150_1477240
like this, +"/.
+" pi, pi, pi .
why are you laughing ? 1477240_1478270
like this, +"/. 1478270_1489220
+" pi, pi, pi .
we're looking so forward to this . 1489220_1492130
okay, is that good ? 1492130_1497150
okay, that's good .
okay, it's only the first time so this should be fine .
and I've already put hydrogen in here . 1497150_1515050
okay then, the next thing will be oxygen .
I would like to take the oxygen from this .
okay, it went in . 1515050_1516200
you only need that little ? 1516200_1518110
okay then, with the method that I used a moment ago, i'll send sparks in here where the hydrogen and oxygen are, and okay, I'm going to start . 1518110_1536010
I'm going to make it react okay ?
what if it goes baboom ! 1536010_1541190
okay then who should I ask to ignite it . 1541190_1544140
me . 1544140_1545240
someone who's name sounds like ignite . 1545240_1547030
who's that going to be ? 1547030_1548210
taro+chan ! 1548210_1549010
taro+chan ! 1549010_1550010
okay then . 1550010_1557010
taro+chan ?
hm, taro+chan sounds good but I think i'll ask kitani+kun .
kota ? 1557010_1559270
which one ?
kitani kota ?
okay, pay attention to this area . 1559270_1567230
okay, pay attention to this area first okay ?
okay then kota+kun, please put this on the positive side . 1567230_1570260
you mean kota+kun right ? 1570260_1574170
whooa ! 1574170_1576280
oh, water ! 1576280_1577250
did you see it ? 1577250_1578020
that was too fast man . 1578020_1579110
water ! 1579110_1580090
water ! 1580090_1580270
water !
did you see it ? 1580270_1581010
say something before you do it ! 1581010_1584070
okay, kota+kun, this was a huge success ! 1584070_1587240
water ! 1587240_1589290
hm, huh ? 1589290_1593250
what did you notice, shohei+kun ?
boom ! 1593250_1594200
boom ! 1594200_1596210
and then ?
oh, it increased ! 1596210_1597990
what increased ? 1597990_1598220
water . 1598220_1599140
the water increased . 1599140_1601090
how do you know that it's water ? 1601090_1602250
uh, yuri+san, see anything kind of flash . 1602250_1609130
did you have the time to spare to see ?
no way . 1609130_1611070
you didn't . 1611070_1614000
okay then we'll try it one more time .
what ? 1614000_1617230
one more time ?
well let me tell you, I think you'll be used to it the second time so instead of just going, +"/. 1617230_1628230
+" whoa !
+" watch it okay ?
watch it okay ?
okay then, I'm going to be on stand+by like before for a little okay ? 1628230_1634090
what ? 1634090_1635120
let kota+kun do it this time . 1635120_1637000
this time . 1637000_1645250
i'll have you guys do it from the hydrogen part .
let kota+kun do it next . 1645250_1648290
oh, I got caught . 1648290_1651230
okay then let's have yukawa+kun put the hydrogen in . 1651230_1659070
the hydrogen producer .
producer . 1659070_1664170
okay, that's fine, okay, okay . 1664170_1666140
okay then, yukawa+kun, put the hydrogen in please . 1666140_1671110
okay, stand up and do it please . 1671110_1677280
don't sit down .
do it until about the second hash mark .
about here, okay .
okay, then yo+kun, yoji+kun will you watch this here ?
about two, okay ?
this much ? 1677280_1687000
this much ?
okay, go ahead . 1687000_1693260
not yet ? 1693260_1694210
not yet . 1694210_1699060
impatient . 1699060_1703120
don't get scared . 1703120_1710090
watch it .
don't close your eyes .
hey yukawa, you are off line . 1710090_1713120
it's okay, yukawa, it's okay because it already went to the second hash mark . 1713120_1715000
you scared me . 1715000_1717170
three more drops .
a little more . 1717170_1719060
hey, let's not make any ridiculous voices during the experiment, machida+kun . 1725100_1738010
let's do this seriously .
do not involve danger .
a little more . 1738010_1740150
let's increase the quantity just a little more than before . 1740150_1745090
just a little .
how much ? 1745090_1746230
a little more . 1746230_1751050
okay, that should be fine . 1751050_1754120
okay, then put it back on the test tube holder . 1754120_1756180
okay, then yoji+kun, do you want to do oxygen ? 1756180_1768030
okay then oxygen .
just add a little, just about one hash mark .
don't put a lot in .
okay, go ahead . 1768030_1772050
xxx . 1772050_1778290
I can't seem to muster any strength .
wait a minute .
it won't come out . 1778290_1780120
it won't come out . 1780120_1781160
it'll come out . 1781160_1782230
shall I do it ? 1782230_1784080
try one more time . 1784080_1795220
a little more .
okay, too much got in this time .
okay then .
the long awaited . 1795220_1798100
taro+chan . 1800260_1801030
I would like one of the girls to do it . 1801030_1802100
taro, taro+chan+ko . 1802100_1802101
why not taro+chan ? 1802100_1804190
taroko+chan . 1804190_1816190
taro+chan . 1825210_1826010
kiyomi+san . 1826010_1833110
let's have you challenge this today as well . 1833110_1836190
okay then it's ready to go . 1836190_1842050
wait a minute okay ?
it looks a little irregular .
kiyomi+san over here, come around over here please . 1842050_1852170
okay, it's ready . 1852170_1858170
after you turn it on, all you have to do is turn the lever to plus .
okay then, since I was told last time that you didn't have time to get yourselves ready, please tell us that you're going to turn it before you turn it . 1858170_1866280
okay, please go ahead .
don't say that you're going to turn it after you turn it . 1866280_1868290
I'm going to turn it . 1868290_1871150
hey, something flew off ! 1871150_1874130
something flew over here !
okay, were you able to notice some kind of change over here this time ? 1874130_1875210
what kind of change was it ?
hydrochloric acid, hydrochloric acid . 1875210_1882010
boof . 1882010_1883010
flash . 1883010_1884010
boof . 1884010_1885120
flash .
it felt like my heart was going to jump out . 1885140_1885180
it molded it . 1885180_1885210
I couldn't see anything . 1885210_1886290
huh ? 1886290_1888070
huh ?
it looked reddish . 1888070_1888240
it looked reddish . 1888240_1893160
what about you, hikaru+san ?
you closed your eyes ? 1893160_1896100
what about you, yumiko+san ? 1896100_1898040
there was a flash . 1898040_1899020
there was a flash . 1899020_1900040
it was distortion . 1900040_1901010
what about you, kaoru+san ? 1901010_1902030
her hair was shining . 1902030_1903010
it looked like it was shining ? 1903010_1907190
okay, then one thing okay ? 1907190_1910290
when I had yukawa+kun and yoji+kun fill this up a while ago with hydrogen and oxygen, the total amount of gas was just below three hash marks . 1910290_1922010
right ? 1922010_1936990
just below three hash marks .
it was about here okay ?
however, with the ignition and explosion, the water .
has come up to just above one hash mark .
hm . 1937080_1942250
well before you go straight to it becoming water, what happened is that the gas was definitely used, and gone .
became water . 1942250_1952210
there's nowhere for it to go right ? 1952210_1960240
so the gas was definitely used, and then a reaction occurred .
okay then, if water was actually made in here, and if we were to investigate . 1960240_1970020
what kind of method would you use to go about investigating that water was actually generated inside of here ?
cobalt chloride paper . 1970020_1973030
yes, if you use the cobalt chloride paper, you can confirm the fact that water was made right ? 1973030_1978170
it's just that it's a little difficult in this case . 1978170_1984200
since it's all being done inside of water .
drink ! 1984200_1984210
drink . 1984210_1985240
drink ? 1985240_1990000
hmm .
okay, I see . 1990000_1990010
okay, then please return to your seats once .
delicious ? 1990010_1996080
teacher, there's some gas coming out . 1996080_1998030
hm ? 1998030_2006090
there was some gas coming out ?
okay then, yujiro+kun, I'm sorry but can you bring this up front ?
you can take that off .
over there too .
will you take that too ?
since I am the assistant . 2006090_2009160
all of this ? 2009160_2010100
yes . 2010100_2015130
will you bring it over to my desk over there ?
okay, ajima+kun, I have to ask you to do something . 2015130_2016990
yes, what do I do ? 2016990_2017180
what do you want me to do ? 2025180_2029090
oh, bring it over here . 2029090_2033090
xxx . 2033090_2034280
oh, just the way it is . 2034280_2041990
oh, you can take it off if you want .
can you get it off ?
do you know how to take it off ?
is this okay ? 2041990_2042080
yes that's okay . 2042080_2043120
okay then I would like everybody to . 2043120_2054290
open their textbooks .
okay, that's all right . 2054290_2075020
page eighty one in your textbooks .
the process p . 2075020_2079260
please look at diagram seven in your textbook on page eighty one . 2079260_2087230
the equipment that we just used is drawn here, right ? 2087230_2111120
it's drawn right ?
okay, there are two things that I would like you to add to that .
there rubber stopper is like this, and this part here is put in like this, right ? 2111120_2124230
okay ? 2124230_2132220
it's right here .
it's emphasized a little here by being drawn large and it's a little separated right ?
copper wire .
so by the copper wire being separated, what did we want to do here ? 2132220_2140100
you just saw it didn't you ? 2140100_2144210
sparks flew . 2144210_2145220
hm . 2145220_2146010
with the energy from the electricity, we cause sparks and we eventually wanted to produce an ignition, right ? 2153000_2156000
so this is purposely cut off and is okay .
okay then, please write this down . 2165270_2192290
you may write this in your textbooks .
since danger is accompanied by igniting it directly with a match and it's also difficult, yes . 2192290_2204010
but now you can see it in the picture, right ?
that this kind of thing occurred inside of our plastic container . 2204010_2210250
right ?
so what that means is, okay the second one, is written here, the compound gas of hydrogen and oxygen right ? 2210250_2223290
okay ?
will you take your pencil and circle it, please ?
the compound gas of hydrogen and oxygen . 2223290_2232080
we collected hydrogen and oxygen in order to make water right here .
however, actually, when you ignite it like we just did, it causes an explosive reaction . 2232080_2238170
it is called hydrogen detonating gas at times . 2251090_2272150
write this in your textbooks please .
detonating gas .
like an explosion .
boom .
it's telling you that it will cause an explosive response .
so if you look this word up in some small dictionary, and you look under detonating gas, then you'll find that the explanation is the explosive reaction for hydrogen and oxygen . 2272150_2285280
it's written like that so look it up . 2285280_2296190
yes, detonating gas .
it's a word which you are not familiar with, isn't it ?
teacher, did you make that yesterday ? 2296190_2299110
no, last year . 2299110_2303290
teacher, have you used that one many times ? 2303290_2306250
because it's about this time of the year . 2306250_2311260
how many times did you use it ? 2311260_2313240
how many times, which one ? 2313240_2319030
okay then write what you learned in your notes . 2319030_2326060
what you learned . 2326060_2338000
write it in your notes . 2347270_2354000
just make a list, like the first thing was this, the second thing was this . 2354000_2382190
something like that is fine .
okay then, I think i'll have you come up to the front and write it . 2382190_2385280
what you learned . 2385280_2398040
okay then the first person . 2398040_2404160
yujiro+kun . 2404160_2415120
aoyama yujiro+kun .
right here .
okay .
the second person . 2415120_2430240
let's see .
kaneda+san .
the third person . 2430240_2441270
kambe+kun .
okay, when you've summarized it, then come up to the front and write it please . 2441270_2445110
you may write it in your own way . 2445110_2496030
yes, it's okay . 2496030_2505060
water is made . 2505060_2510140
write down what water is made of . 2510140_2527010
hm ? 2527010_2595080
what is it ?
you can look .
you can look as you write it .
water was made from oxygen and hydrogen . 2600150_2605270
okay then, since we've have a few written up here, write your own ideas in your notebooks please . 2605270_2612260
okay then, I've had three representatives write what they thought . 2612260_2625170
kambe+kun thought that water was made from oxygen and hydrogen .
shoichi+kun .
parenthesis two . 2625170_2644030
uh, kambe+san right ?
when you mix hydrogen and oxygen, it explodes .
the third one is yujiro+kun .
water was made from oxygen and hydrogen .
so how would you summarize what these three had to say in one sentence . 2644030_2652150
it was this first theme right here, right ? 2652150_2655070
is it possible to make water from hydrogen and oxygen ? 2655070_2664080
and since we were able to do that, as a conclusion, we are able to write that type of a breakdown .
okay then, will all of you write your own answers, please . 2664080_2674140
like that .
using signs, like arrows .
for those of you who don't know, i'll write it up here so please copy it down . 2674140_2680000
it got a little crooked . 2719280_2768180
water is created from hydrogen and oxygen .
parenthesis, since I had you write it down, it is explosive .
however, it is an explosive reaction .
no, teacher . 2768180_2770100
not, +"/. 2770100_2787120
+" no, teacher .
+" hurry up and write it .
what ? 2787120_2789270
teacher, we have parasitic worms in our body, right ? 2789270_2797200
what do you call the thing in your intestine that's really long ?
a tapeworm ? 2797200_2798010
that's it . 2798010_2806150
don't use an equal sign . 2806150_2818000
use an arrow .
it's a common error but it's not an equal .
unlike the mathematical equal, it's not necessarily equal, so yes it's an arrow .
that was a good place to make a mistake . 2818000_2828240
it's better to make it now .
there's a lot of third years who write equal .
okay, then this is the last thing . 2828240_2837010
right here, I had you write this last time, but water separates into hydrogen and oxygen . 2837010_2845280
it separates so it is a decomposition .
especially since you're sending electricity so we called it electrolysis . 2845280_2848200
in the case over here, you are making one thing from something and something, so we call this a chemical combination . 2848200_2855990
a chemical combination . 2855990_2856000
a chemical combination . 2863080_2865100
so it means that decomposition and chemical combination is the opposite reaction . 2865100_2884270
so from now on we will continue our discussion with this chemical combination .
okay then, since we took the time to do the chemical combination, we will go right into a chemical combination experiment in our next class meeting . 2884270_2892030
please look at the same pages eighty and eighty one in your textbooks . 2892030_2905260
what are you doing ? 2905260_2911120
what are you doing ? 2911120_2921230
what we just did was hydrogen and oxygen . 2921230_2929070
it was a gas and a gas to make water, but this time I'd like to try it with a solid matter and a solid matter .
and what we're going to use is iron . 2929070_2936270
and sulfur . 2936270_2941190
you read that as sulfur .
we are going to mix these two things that, at first glance look nothing alike and . 2941190_2954210
in other words, what I'm saying is let's try a chemical combination of the two .
okay then . 2954210_2970230
I talked a little about expressing substances with symbols at the end of the first quarter, and it has been one month since then, but do you remember it ?
what did, how did we express iron as a symbol ? 2979110_2983120
heat ? 2983120_2986040
heat ?
iron ? 2987010_2989080
fe@k . 2989080_2990100
fe@k . 2990100_2993140
okay then what about sulfur ?
s@l . 2993140_2994140
s@l . 2994140_3009050
you seem to have a lot of confidence .
s@l .
okay we'll be using these substances .
okay then, it's this handout right ?
will the group leader collect them and bring it up to me please .
we will finish . 3009050_3010120
stand up . 3010120_3030010
stand up straight . 3030010_3033100
face the front and stand up straight . 3033100_3035150
face the front . 3035150_3040230
thank you very much . 3044080_3045010
