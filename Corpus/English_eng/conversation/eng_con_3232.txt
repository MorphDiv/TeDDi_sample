all right so go ahead, let's start that . 0_1438
so you've got to draw your triangle first on the second page and then write down your instructions . 1438_7473
xxx Is there one in the drawer ? 7473_11741
don't think so, just borrow . 11741_14295
no . 14295_18415
just borrow one . 18415_26391
draw your triangle first . 26391_33168
all right ? 33168_34710
draw your triangle first . 34710_36685
you draw it on the second sheet, the top of the second sheet . 36685_39743
where it says your triangle . 39743_42508
yep . 42508_43803
do you need to draw two don't you ? 43803_46250
no, just one . 46250_47026
so miss the person that's giving the instructions xxx . 47026_52065
you draw the triangle first yes . 52065_53188
everyone draws a triangle and writes down their instructions . 53188_56121
all right . 56121_56978
so you want us to draw one triangle ? 56978_72155
just one triangle . 72155_73641
do you draw the triangle like this ? 73641_82298
you &~ha yeah, you use your protractor and your compass to draw the triangle . 82298_86713
can I trace this ? 86713_87338
you can . 87338_88810
yeah . 88810_89225
okay I'll use it after . 89225_91056
but you're not going to draw the same triangle are you ? 91056_93360
no . 93360_94081
no . 94081_94568
all right, and how are you going to know what size the angle is ? 94568_98265
by the length of the line . 98265_143726
yeah . 143726_144636
can I sharpen the pencil ? 144636_146180
yeah, that's all right, yep . 146180_147568
just go and sharpen it . 147568_149128
xxx . 149128_150433
pardon ? 150433_151056
I said I don't want to get up in front of the camera . 151056_152480
yes you can . 152480_152881
I'm just waiting for a compass . 152881_199736
is that what we're going to be doing finding the angles and stuff . 199736_202500
it's not going to be the same one as Kate's is it ? 202500_204516
yeah, you've got to find it depends on how you're going to draw it . 204516_209370
how you want them to draw it ? 209370_210640
you can either find angles or you can find sides . 210640_213433
okay . 213433_214438
or a combination of both . 214438_215768
so I could write all my angles and all my sides couldn't I ? 215768_218406
you could but that's not the minimum number . 218406_220455
oh so you +/. 220455_221335
so you've got to end up with the minimum number that you need . 221335_223608
so what stage have they drawn your triangle without you having to add on the rest of the instructions ? 223608_229166
you might have a lot of instructions to start with and then you find after a couple that they've actually drawn it . 229166_234263
okay . 234263_235086
all right ? 235086_235905
good . 235905_297653

now you shouldn't be looking . 304933_305738
you're not supposed to know what it looks like . 305738_308578
um, I need to make a measurement . 308578_311026
when I measured it, it's like that xxx do I write like five point whatever ? 311026_315131
yes, you'll have to, yeah . 315131_316435
okay . 316435_316801

have you all finished ? 333266_335056
yeah . 335056_336378
when you all or uh three or four of you have finished the triangle, you can start the first person can start reading theirs out . 336378_347258
okay, can I read mine out now ? 347258_349406
if the rest are finished, yes . 349406_350716
has Jessica finished ? 350716_353188

yes .360636_361106
and um, when we write it would it be draw up a five point six centimeter +/. 361106_367291
it's it's whatever your instructions are going to be . 367291_369683
it can be a combination of side size of the length of sides or angles . 369683_375036
miss ? 375036_376681
depends on what you want to do . 376681_378401
how many instructions do we have to have ? 378401_380906
you're going to try them and find out . 380906_383136
they're going to try them . 383136_385145
if they don't draw the same as what you've got, it wasn't . 385145_387961
if it if they draw the same it was right . 387961_389911
okay ? 389911_391408

yeah, yeah . 411090_411831
a line . 411831_412256
yeah, well you've got to read it out to the other two now, they're not to know what you have got . 412256_415393
I know but +... 415393_416223
yes . 416223_416626

you ready ? 420120_423088
is mine right ? 423088_425778
it depends, if it works, if they draw the same triangle as you've got it works . 425778_430016
if not you change it . 430016_431558
all right ? 431558_434318
so you've got to try it . 434318_437568

she's deliberately not responding . 450655_451718
I'm responding ! 451718_452828
she's like xxx because xxx . 452828_454668
draw a half circle . 454668_455501
I said uh . 455501_456030
okay . 456030_456526
yes, there you go . 456526_457598
okay, now go to h@l . 457598_461630
yes . 461630_462101
make radius six centimeters . 462101_464118
yes . 464118_464518
okay, have you done that ? 464518_473320
yes . 473320_473830
now, draw an arc from h@l bisecting the arc from s@l . 473830_480158
okay . 480158_483798
using your compass, measure the distance from xxx . 483798_487880
okay, now you ready for this ? 487880_488595
that was xxx point n@l, so write point n@l . 488595_491673
now draw now draw a line from n@l to s@l . 491673_498523
yes . 498523_500310
okay, all right, trace a set square +... 500310_503261
but it's two minimum isn't it ? 503261_504548
no, no, I don't want that . 504548_506283
that's why I didn't think you wanted . 506283_507165
I want lines and angles . 507165_508293
that's what I thought . 508293_509101
all right ? 509101_509781
yep . 509781_510301
because they might have a different size set square . 510301_512116
okay . 512116_513150
oh, yeah . 513150_513746
true ? 513746_514434

yeah . 514916_515491
okay . 515491_515973
so when you have all finished your instructions you can start reading them out . 515973_522373
now you've gotta cut them out and paste them on and see if they fit . 522373_545973
all right ? 545973_547921
and then you get to keep them . 547921_551233
