last week my friend Billy , who's always been interested in animals
he carried the frog everywhere with him all day until it was time
his pet dog Bowwow said good_night@q to the frog .
and together they got into bed .
during the night the frog hoped out_of the jar and out_of the
all while my friend Billy was sleeping .
when Billy woke up the next morning he discovered that the frog was
Billy looked everywhere for it , in his mother's boots , in the jar
+" Mister frog where are you ?
called Billy .
Billy had no idea where to look .
slowly him and Bowwow dropped down out_of the window .
together they could do anything +"/.
+" Mister frog where are you ?
Billy searched into the forest .
there was a beehive nearby .
Billy tried to ignore it but Bowwow just couldn't .
the bees were just far too interesting +"/.
+" Mister frog where are you ?
Billy called down a rabbit hole .
a little rabbit came out +"/.
+" oy this is my hole !
he said .
Bowwow just couldn't take his eyes off that beehive .
he hadta go and see what was there .
suddenly it fell down +"/.
+" woof woof !
said Bowwow +"/.
+" help me !
but Billy was far too interested in looking for Mister frog .
he was trying to look in the tree .
but suddenly an owl came out +"/.
+" oh !
said Billy +"/.
+" you gave me a shock !
Billy continued to look .
he tried to look over the the larger boulder in the forest
but suddenly an antelope <come out> came out !
it carried him off and carried him far , far away .
until it came to a grassy knoll where it let go of Billy .
and Billy fell splash into a pond !
Billy could hear the sounds of croaking +"/.
+" maybe its Mister frog ?
he said .
he told Bowwow to be quiet and slowly peered behind the big log .
and there was Mister frog with <another frog> a lady frog .
Billy crept down .
there were lots_of little frogs too .
Mister frog said he was very , very happy with Missus frog .
and so they could give him one of their children instead .
Billy settled with this and waved goodbye to Mister frog with one
