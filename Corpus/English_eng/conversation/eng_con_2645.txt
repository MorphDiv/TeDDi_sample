&=multiple_background_conversations_next_26:34 so who came here first ? 1595_2975
I don't know &-um you wanna start do you have a question ? 3095_6815
⌈ specific question ⌉ ? 7215_8795
⌊ no I'm fine ⌋ you can .
⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ <start with them> ⌋ I got here late . 8795_9415
⌈ xxx they were waiting ⌉ .
⌊ &-um: ⌋ specific questions ? 9715_11855
you have a specific question ?
&-um everyone +/. 13295_15835
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ else ⌋ was here first . 16115_16775
Robin ?
yeah I have a question xxx . 16775_18995
okay .
this right here I'm not sure +//. 20035_22575
I don't understand why we use this ⌈ this &-um ⌉ . 22735_25595
⌊ oh oh ⌋ okay so this is . 25595_27335
shape factor . 27515_27575
xxx you use the shape factor when you don't know like when you have two dimensional heat transfer right ? 28755_33035
okay .
which is the case here because you know like heat is going this way it's radially going out +/. 33615_37975
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and ⌋ then it's it going off . 38195_38835
okay ? 39375_39415
it's going to the surface here . 39535_40555
+, mhm +/.
+, now you can't model this as a one dimensional heat transfer you know like the &-um the sort that we learned before so you take care of the heat transferred from the surface of the tube to the surface of the soil or solid or whatever here it it is +/. 41075_56395
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um by the shape factor okay ? 56715_58575
but if that's +//.
this shape factor is it says it's for hollow &~cyl cylinder . 59275_62615
+, and that's why I don't understand why ⌈ we use that ⌉ . 63195_65455
⌊ oh is this for ⌋ the hollow cylinder ? 65455_66455
okay . 67035_67055
I thought you were talking about this .
is this the same as this ? 67885_71105
yeah .
because this is for no this is for buried buried cylinder . 71625_76925
for a hollow cylinder . 77545_79205
it's the same thing except you have r@l two except ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 80065_82345
⌊ right ⌋ so this is for a buried maybe it's not a hollow cylinder (be)cause this H is this H actually &=audio_disturbance if you have something like this ? 82465_94505
this shape factor takes care of the heat transfer from the surface to here . 95315_98215
okay +/.
+, okay ?
so what you do is you say the formula is like this the heat transferred from here to here is just K of this material here +/. 99235_108975
+, uhuh +/.
+, times the S shape factor that you have for this geometry which is this thing times <the delta t@l> the delta t@l would be from the surface to the surface . 109655_116955
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ ? 117835_118075
so this shape factor only takes care of &-um this region from this surface to this surface . 118465_124005
okay ? 124325_125065
that's all it does . 125165_125785
now for the rest of it if you wanna go from here to here you have to worry about the other resistances that you have ⌈ for example ⌉ . 126065_131205
⌊ <this example> here ⌋ ? 131765_132365
right .
this is like the internal resistance the convection resistance inside the pipe and this is for the thickness of the pipe itself . 132365_137565
and then from here to here the shape factor takes care of it . 137965_140485
and you need to +//. 140765_141385
if you want to add the resistances you have to convert the shape factor into a resistance first which is one over KS just like this . 141825_147765
okay ? 148205_148225
so this is the shape factor this is the Q for it and this is the resistance for it . 148725_153405
and it takes care of heat transfer from here to here . 154005_159945
⌈ okay ⌉ ?
⌊ then ⌋ whenever you have a cylinder you &~j you just use A ⌈ the log mean ⌉ .
⌊ log mean ⌋ yeah .
if you have like multiple layers ⌈ of some ⌉ . 160045_163285
⌊ what if you ⌋ what if like this thickness is really really small ?
can you just use the .
<if it's> if it's a very small thickness and if the material is very conductive then you can probably say that the resistance is very small because this is this delta r@l is really small and this K is very big so this resistance is very small you neglect it in favor of the other one . 163605_182465
so usually when you have thick I mean thin layer you can tell you can say that . 182645_188965
the resistance is very small it hasta be very conductive too . 189665_192525
you can't really say only by the delta r@l because if this thing is very small too then +/. 192825_196765
okay +/.
+, it might not necessarily give H xxx ⌈ right ⌉ ? 197465_199085
+, ⌊ uhuh ⌋ +/.
+, so &~i if delta r@l is very small and it's very conductive then you can probably say the resistance is very small so it's all the uniform temperature throughout the thickness of the tube right ? 199385_207545
so there's &~jus just one more question xxx one more question like +/.
mhm +/.
+, if you if we have problems that we did like at the beginning of &~cla of the year +/. 208665_215145
+, right +/.
+, and have h@l-s in (th)em like can we expect that he's gonna give us like <another one> xxx . 215865_221585
yeah yeah you should +/. 221885_223385
⌈ so we gotta combine all ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ be able to ⌋ combine right . 223525_224665
actually let me draw a picture for you think about this case do you have an extra sheet of paper <I can> use ? 224905_229485
okay so think about this case let's say you have a box sort_of like a box here and then there's a pipe in it . 229825_238405
okay ?
okay .
now there's another box here and there's another pipe in it . 238685_244165
⌈ okay ⌉ ?
⌊ uhuh ⌋ +/.
+, you know the dimensions . 244625_245625
here and here fluid is flowing like let's say with a velocity of ten meters per second and temperature is given +/. 246265_254245
+, uhuh +/.
+, for the fluid inside . 254985_255705
here another fluid is flowing with a velocity of let's say two meters per second another temperature this is t@l one this is t@l two is given . 256435_262575
and for &~h here the heat transfer coefficient is given . 263255_266375
okay ? 267375_267455
for between the two . 267655_269375
so we have a heat transfer coefficient for the fluid that's here and the velocities of these . 269615_273035
now they say calculate the rate of heat transfer from this to this . 273275_276015
okay ? 276335_277415
so you have one resistance for the H here which you have to calculate from . 277595_281615
is this solid right here ?
yeah ⌈ this is solid right here ⌉ . 281935_284035
⌊ is this &~materi ⌋ okay .
+, so you have one resistance here which you can calculate from the Nusselt number . 284825_288125
+, okay +/.
+, you have the Nusselt number you get the H you calculate the resistance here . 288585_291005
then you have probably like <you might> you might wanna think about the thickness too but let's not worry about that . 291405_295685
then from here from to here you have a shape factor which is given here . 295945_298725
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ it's this ⌋ case right ? 299225_300025
so you use this shape factor for the resistance from here to here . 300325_302765
+, okay +/.
+, then from here to here you have an H so it's one over HA area being this and then again from here to here another shape factor from here to here another H . 303365_312185
Nusselt number and would the Nusselt number be the same for these two or ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 312885_314945
⌊ no ⌋ because the velocities are different . 315205_316585
okay .
I mean &~w .
the velocities are different so you have to first check if they're in the same regime you might be able to use the same formula for them if the &~re regime is the same ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 318365_326125
⌊ I mean they ⌋ they only give you like a Nusselt number of I don't know whatever ten . 326305_329485
oh okay . 329945_330365
if they just give you a Nusselt number a value for Nusselt number ⌈ then you <can say> ⌉ . 330705_333725
⌊ and then you have to find ⌋ the h@l-s in here I mean do you use the same Nusselt number to find the h@l-s in there ? 333845_337705
yeah if they ⌈ give you one less ⌉ . 337805_339265
⌊ <and so I> just check ⌋ with the &~formu formula I tried to use right ?
&-um yeah but they they probably won't give you a number for Nusselt number you know they won't say like Nusselt number is ten . 339485_346825
okay .
they just give you a velocity and you should be able to calculate the Nusselt number yourself using the formulas for for <inside ⌈ the pipe> ⌉ +/. 347145_352905
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, right ?
okay .
okay ?
okay .
great .
thank you .
okay .
next .
do you have a question ? 356525_364965
I'll I'll go after them . 365165_366265
okay . 366505_366705
alright I just had a few &-uh conceptual things here . 367125_372045
alright +/.
+, &-uh first off I know we have equations for +//. 372705_375165
to find NF do you &~thin exam +//.
we can copy +//. 375925_377485
just use the charts right ?
yes if it's +//. 379305_379745
if it falls in the chart if it's falls in this ⌈ range ⌉ +/. 380345_382165
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, use the chart it's ⌈ easier ⌉ . 382805_383585
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, okay ?
okay great .
⌈ &-um ⌉ .
⌊ do you ⌋ have a hyperbolic tangent on your calculator ? 384625_387365
yeah . 387685_387925
you do ? 388245_388405
okay cool . 388585_389225
yeah so &~a another thing <I was confused on> is that I know you talked about this before and I don't +//. 389195_395215
I wanna make sure I have it right now if you &-um +//. 395235_397915
because the one equation for &-um case two +/. 398655_403815
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ N ⌋ NF it's it's just this huge equation +/. 404515_406855
+, mhm +/.
+, and I know you said before <you could> you could probably just use this +/. 407295_409515
+, yeah +/.
+, and just use LC instead ? 409875_411395
correct . 411555_411775
okay so you can ⌈ use that ⌉ .
⌊ as long as ⌋ the thickness is not very big . 411975_414715
okay .
okay ?
as long as the thickness of the pipe is not really big you can use LC because &-um as we said before (0.4) what LC does is that they say we we we okay we saw the case that this was insulated right ? 416225_433345
yeah .
and that's case one . 433865_435265
if it's not really insulated we correct the length by saying we cut this in half add half of it to this side add half of it to this side so this is just a little bit longer right ? 435825_444165
mhm .
so if this thickness is not very big now this correction won't make too much of an error . 444945_450045
yeah .
right ?
in the actual case . 450745_452425
but if this thickness is big you need to use the formula for case two which is the exact formula for +/. 453245_458005
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ a ⌋ noninsulated tip right ? 458525_459665
&-um and then &-uh oh for semiinfinite &-um +... 461705_468925
so I was just &-uh curious is &~tha is this exponential is that all of this ⌈ <or is it just EXP of this> ⌉ ? 472425_480025
⌊ no no error function ⌋ no exponential +//. 480025_482825
see it's error function of this minus exponential of this ⌈ times ⌉ +/. 483445_487185
⌊ times ⌋ +/.
+, error function of ⌈ this ⌉ . 487505_488165
⌊ okay ⌋ okay .
yeah .
I was thinking xxx +/.
right +/.
+, now xxx how you keep track of this right I mean this is pretty big . 488825_498225
&=laughs .
this if you know the surface temperature . 498345_500125
&~y yeah if you know .
yeah if you know the surface temperature you can use this this is probably in terms of H so you know the heat transfer coefficient outside and the temperature outside . 501755_509395
okay ?
well this is saying it's t@l one <and then this> xxx is t@l one ? 510155_514155
yeah t@l one is in the fluid it's not the surface temperature right ? 514155_517495
yeah so you can use this chart when you have fluid temperature ? 517595_521095
right . 521415_521715
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ and then surface ⌋ temperature surface temperature it's just this term right here you know that (be)cause this is just just to deal with the fluid ? 522015_534395
+, I thought mm (be)cause you're it looks like ⌈ from the xxx surface temperature ⌉ .
⌊ oh it looks like the surface +//.
⌋ oh you mean this this part is the same as what the equation you had +//. 534735_539735
you know the surface temperature ? 539995_540875
yeah but I I &~j if I read the notes right it's just you need to know that this ⌈ term is ⌉ . 541175_551995
⌊ yes ⌋ correct correct .
⌈ and then ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so if ⌋ you solve this part xxx it's it's the surface ⌈ temperature ⌉ . 548095_551015
⌊ if you know ⌋ the surface temperature .
and then you use <the card> if you don't know it .
or this big ⌈ chain ⌉ . 551635_555255
⌊ actually ⌋ you know what this is for the general case yeah this this deals with the fluid this is for the surface temperature correct . 555675_561235
okay +/.
+, yeah exactly .
okay &-um I think that was basically it +/. 561415_566095
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ if I ⌋ think of something else &=laughs I guess xxx .
so when do we use this equation then ? 566955_569235
which one ? 569415_569835
only if you know the surface temperature ? 569895_571275
&-um see if it's only +//. 571595_573015
if if you know the surface temperature it's only the first term that you need to deal with okay ? 573385_577405
<if you> &~ne if you know the surface temperature and that's in your notes . 577645_579705
it's right ⌈ here ⌉ ?
⌊ that's ⌋ in your lecture notes . 579965_580605
right yeah that's the only term that you need to worry about if you know the surface temperature . 580865_584245
if you don't know the surface temperature you can either use this whole thing or use the chart . 584765_587965
which I would say use the chart it's easier &=laughs:multiple <you know> don't &=laughs those exponentials and xxx . 588315_593775
yes .
okay and so what +//.
I mean like you use this if you know the &~s the surface temperature xxx <now where does TS come from> ?
&-um t@l one would be TS then . 594075_615215
but I thought this was TS ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ no &~tha ⌋ that if if you know this +//.
if you know the +//.
see that's the case that +//. 616185_621345
because it's the same if the formula <will be> &~di will be different you will have TS here then because it's as if the H is extremely large so that these terms drop out correct ? 621845_631685
okay .
if the X is &~ex extremely large or the H the exponential of this minus this thing you know like +/. 632045_638845
+, ⌊ this thing ⌋ drops out right . 639085_640105
and then you will &-um have only this term right ? 640405_643905
and that means if the H is very very big the surface temperature is the same as t@l one . 644565_650125
so you can put your surface temperature here . 650385_651805
but I would say use the &~th the lecture notes (be)cause it was derived for you in the lecture notes <in here> . 652185_659105
(0.4) .
so &~surfa &~temp surface temperature would be t@l one right ? 660265_665925
surface temperature would be t@l one yes . 666345_668245
and then you would just solve it ⌈ <for the H> ⌉ .
⌊ you use +//.
⌋ right &~di did he t@l infinity well he gave you the big one again right ? 670335_676235
he gave you the big equation ? 676515_679055
in his .
&-uh &~wi &-uh: .
on his exam notes he does <have the small> xxx .
does it ?
yeah +/.
okay +/. 679495_685935
+, yes the two ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ which is which ⌋ ? 687735_688075
which is TS over that right ? 688395_690235
TS minus ⌈ TS ⌉ . 690615_691875
⌊ TS ⌋ +/.
+, yeah .
yeah and he he showed the <cases about> .
right . 698215_698615
so he just switched the TS to t@l one over the . 699015_701435
yeah .
right ? 701655_702155
so if you know the surface temperature you can use that xxx . 702395_704255
but &~th and then wouldn't you use this part if you know H ? 704775_707355
yes .
okay . 707495_708235
this one you can use if it you don't know H ? 708755_711295
no if you don't know H how do you use this one ? 711715_713775
I don't +//. 713915_714435
I don't know why would you use this one ? 714435_715875
why ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ no if ⌋ you don't know H and you don't know the surface temperature you can't do anything . 716535_719615
you need to know either H or the surface temperature . 719755_722735
if you know the surface temperature use this part or use that equation in the notes . 723105_727145
if you know H you can either use this equation which is very big or use charts . 727625_731085
so if you don't know H you can still <use this> ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 731465_733385
⌊ if you don't know H ⌋ and you don't know surface temperature you can't do anything . 733425_736485
no but I said if if you know the surface temperature and you don't know H you can <do the same> ?
you don't know surface temperature but +//. 736685_742465
and you know H ? 742605_743305
no you know the surface temperature but you don't know H . 743465_747245
you know the surface temperature and you don't know H you can use only this part . 747245_748645
yeah +/.
+, or that equation . 749185_749825
and that's not as accurate right ? 749845_751005
<it is> it is very accurate . 751705_752845

how're you gonna find these ? 756505_757825

no no if they give it to you . 760385_761785

they say like you have a semiinfinite solid initially at this temperature at like t@l naught . 763205_767425

okay ? 1446445_1446645
xxx okay that's all . 1448285_1450265
xxx .
those are the surface area of the fin . 1453345_1462705
they are ?
then what is the face area of the fin ? 1463055_1465455
that's the crosssectional area perpendicular to the direction of heat transfer . 1466175_1469815
so when so so when is <&~sh he> using this ? 1471035_1475435
when you say Q is minus KA DTDX that A is the crosssectional area . 1475715_1481155
perpendicular to the direction of heat ⌈ transfer ⌉ .
⌊ but he's ⌋ not using that in here . 1481735_1484115
&-um no . 1484935_1485875
probably might be an M . 1486675_1489855
<is it &-um> in in the C like this is like the same equation but except this is HA and this ⌈ is CA ⌉ . 1490325_1496925
⌊ it's AF it's ⌋ the same thing . 1496925_1498425
oh K no oh okay you know what he's doing ? 1499445_1503065
he's doing the +//. 1503185_1504105
well okay he's &-um okay he's &~doin what he's doing he's saying like the heat transfer is the same all the heat transfer that is here +/. 1504445_1514345
⌈ mhm mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ comes from the base of the ⌋ fin right ? 1514885_1516005
so this if this is conduction then this would be the crosssectional area of +//. 1516175_1521575
perpendicular to the ⌈ direction of the fin ⌉ . 1521895_1523035
⌊ so so I ⌋ but I can use either one of these equations .
yes actually this is easier . 1523035_1526955
⌈ this is much easier . 1527355_1527975
as long as you know the efficiency of the fin ⌉ . 1528175_1529695
⌊ yeah xxx <but I just wanna make> ⌋ sure this I know what <this is> this is crosssectional ? 1529795_1532435
yeah crosssectional because whenever you talk about conduction it's minus k@l times A DTDX right ? 1532755_1538415
and that A is the area perpendicular to the direction of heat transfer right ? 1538595_1542575
mhm .
alright ?
so that that's the area that that's how it comes in the picture . 1544025_1546525
&-uh ⌈ so ⌉ +/.
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, but then should this part this part is part of the efficiency so what happened to this <Biot number> ? 1548125_1558285
well you had the temperature profile and you took a derivative of it . 1558285_1561205
right ? 1561285_1561905
well &~w wait the Biot number is ⌈ less than xxx ⌉ .
⌊ and that's how this ⌋ &-um that's how they did this because that's not +//. 1564825_1569125
see they have this formula for the temperature profile they take the derivative of it and they get this . 1569565_1573605
okay ? 1574445_1574505
and since this AM is not the same as this AF and since this K is not the same as this H you don't expect to have all the terms ⌈ here like they just cancel out ⌉ . 1574905_1584565
⌊ <that's what you use for this cycle> ⌋ ? 2649965_2662585
right .
so using this would probably <use them here> ? 3375945_3402985
that'll be easier right .
okay .
yeah &=transcript_aborted_at_26:34:_POOR_SOUND_QUALITY_LAST_42_MIN &=begin_second_tape:_RECORDED_10/25/00 . 4131275_4131455
alright .
(o)kay so let's go on with your questions . 4131835_4143575
you came first +/. 4145295_4145815
⌈ go ahead ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ right ⌋ ? 4146195_4146315
yeah +/. 4146695_4146775
⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 4147255_4147595
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ I wanna talk about number three . 4148195_4149115
okay . 4150155_4150475
I think I know how to do it but like I didn't +//. 4150875_4153595
I'm not sure I'm like setting it up right +/. 4153855_4155415
mhm +/.
+, we can do spreadsheets for both parts right ? 4155835_4159215
⌈ yes ⌉ . 4159345_4159805
⌊ it's ⌋ easier to do it that way . 4159825_4160605
correct .
so I was thinking you wanna guess this temperature right ? 4161385_4164005
yes . 4164785_4165205
calculate the . 4165805_4166105
why do you wanna guess the temperature ? 4166325_4168685
so you can calculate you wanna calculate you don't know the H the heat transfer coefficient ⌈ xxx here ⌉ . 4169085_4173165
⌊ right ⌋ okay . 4173745_4174105
right ? 4174585_4174825
correct . 4175165_4175305
so you wanna guess that so you can calculate GF to evaluate the properties to you know do the Nusselt stuff to calculate h@l all ? 4175925_4185345
or am I doing this wrong ? 4185565_4186385
no that that's correct . 4186405_4187165
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you need ⌋ the Grashoff number too right ? 4187345_4189045
yeah ⌈ Grashoff and Prandtl ⌉ .
⌊ yeah &~a and Grashoff ⌋ and Prandtl . 4189345_4190445
okay . 4190965_4191225
okay and then you wanna calculate the Q through here so then you can go back and recalculate this . 4191505_4197665
correct . 4197925_4197985
to make sure it's right . 4198145_4198805
yes . 4199165_4199185
so but the question I was having is you can either calculate Q like this like being convected from this or Q through here right ? 4199305_4207665
they'll be the same thing . 4207765_4208685
do you think they'll be the same thing ? 4209145_4210425
won't they ? 4211185_4211645
well I'm just asking . 4212425_4213525
yes . 4213705_4214045
yes it's ⌈ steady state ⌉ . 4214245_4215305
⌊ (be)cause it's steady state ⌋ . 4215245_4215565
right yeah . 4215705_4216025
okay .
okay so it doesn't matter if you . 4217185_4218865
if you calculate it either way . 4219125_4220465
right .
and the other thing is you don't actually need this temperature ⌈ do you ⌉ ? 4221465_4225565
⌊ you don't ⌋ yeah no . 4225605_4225985
right ⌈ you can jump from &~h ⌉ . 4226165_4227065
⌊ and on the second part ⌋ you don't need the temperature on the inside of the insulation . 4227325_4229725
inside of the insulation no you don't need it +/. 4230365_4232225
⌈ no you don't .
yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ because you can jump ⌋ +/. 4232345_4232905
+, yeah +/.
+, from the inside of the room to ⌈ the outside ⌉ +/. 4233025_4234525
+, ⌊ &~t yeah ⌋ +/.
+, of the insulation right ? 4234545_4235545
okay so I understand that so I kinda +//. 4235725_4238105
yeah it's just setting it up that kind of confuses me like what . 4238325_4242105
what to guess first and how to proceed you mean ? 4242595_4245175
&~ye well I kind of made just like a reason that it would be closer you know to this obviously than this and I kind of been more confused on the second part how it's the same it's the same idea for the second part right ? 4245275_4258295
yes . 4258655_4258795
except you're gonna guess three temperatures . 4259035_4260795
which are which temperatures ? 4261175_4262795
the temperature +//. 4263075_4263615
like &~th if this is the inside of the insulation the temperature on the inside of the insulation inside of the window and the outside of the window . 4263875_4268755
so outside of the insulation you mean . 4269185_4270825
not inside of the insulation . 4271185_4272025
yeah ⌈ yeah sorry ⌉ . 4272385_4273425
⌊ okay right yeah ⌋ . 4273465_4274365
in between the space . 4274465_4275245
correct +/. 4275365_4275545
⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 4276545_4276765
+, ⌊ so but ⌋ these three temperatures are all related right ? 4276765_4279645
it &~th it's not that there's three independent temperatures you ⌈ you ⌉ +/. 4280145_4283265
+, ⌊ no ⌋ +/.
+, guess them independently first but then they're all related &~t through the Q because at steady state the Q is the same that goes through all of them right ? 4283565_4290865
mhm .
so you guess the three temperatures but what you can calculate all three in one step right ? 4290925_4296685
in each step of your iteration you can calculate all three different temperatures . 4297605_4301045
because if you know the Q right ? 4301845_4303645
you can jump from the inside of the room to the outside of the &-um plastic and calculate this temperature . 4303805_4310025
and the with the same Q you can jump from here to here you know to the inside of the window and calculate the temperature of the inside of the window with the same Q you can jump from the inside of the room to the outside of the window so all three temperatures can be +/. 4310485_4321605
⌈ dependent on this thing here .
yeah ⌉ .
+, ⌊ calculated in each iteration step . 4322065_4323525
right ⌋ ? 4324065_4324125
and then you then the new three temperatures that you calculate are are your next guesses . 4324485_4329405
you put (th)em in into your next step of iteration . 4329825_4331645
yeah . 4332405_4332625
right ? 4333065_4333205
yes . 4333605_4334105
so it's basically the same thing as part A it's just like three different temperatures that you have to guess . 4334705_4338545
and as long as you guess them you know like physically they're close to what they're really ⌈ going to be ⌉ . 4338925_4344325
⌊ it should be ⌋ a good iteration ⌈ and you ⌉ +/. 4344325_4345785
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.

no I think it should converge in like . 4346125_4349305
couldn't you +/.

+, ⌊ can you ⌋ do a circular reference ? 4350225_4351605
or is it . 4352525_4353005
⌈ yes ⌉ .
⌊ better ⌋ to do . 4353285_4353805
&-um circular ⌈ reference ⌉ . 4354425_4355785
⌊ you ⌋ know what I'm saying like +/. 4356205_4356625
⌈ &~i &~di do ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ can't recalculate it ⌋ and then have the first cell that you guessed reference that last one ? 4357025_4361445
yes you can do that yeah . 4361985_4363525
okay . 4363745_4364025
right so like you calculate the temperatures and then the temperatures that you calculate here you say these cells are +/. 4364305_4369545
⌈ xxx yes ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ these temperatures right ⌋ ? 4369765_4370605
but don't do the same &~ce cells go down . 4370985_4373085
you know what I mean ? 4373345_4373825
like don't do +//. 4374105_4374645
like if you guess the three &~tha temperatures and you put (th)em here don't say that these three are put into this cell again . 4374735_4382415
put (th)em in in the next row . 4383255_4385475
you know what I mean ? 4386235_4386755
no I have no idea . 4386995_4387735
okay . 4387895_4388095
you guess +//. 4388535_4389315
you have three cells for the temperatures right ? 4389455_4391235
⌈ one ⌉ . 4391475_4391615
⌊ mhm ⌋ .
two three . 4391775_4391995
so this is like t@l one t@l two T t@l three and then you go on and you calculate these three . 4392795_4397675
okay ? 4398335_4398415
mhm .
don't put these three in the same cells put (th)em in the next row . 4398515_4401375
⌈ put (th)em here and then go on ⌉ . 4402805_4404805
⌊ oh: I see what you're saying ⌋ and then do redo that . 4404825_4406025
yeah because this way you know like you're referencing something to to itself it's not good because sometimes Excel gets ⌈ confused ⌉ . 4406105_4412025
&=laughs .
⌊ oh ⌋ I see what you're saying . 4413105_4413285
okay ? 4421265_4425745
&-um okay then the only other thing that I have a question on for the second part is do we do I wanna like go about it with the same steps like first calculate this H to calculate you know see &~i it doesn't make as much sense to me there I guess .
why ?
tell me what your thought process is . 4433425_4435325
well (be)cause I know that you you don't +//. 4435685_4436785
for the second part you don't need this H +//. 4436985_4438265
you need this H and you need this H right ? 4438485_4440425
correct . 4440845_4441185
to calculate the Q . 4441525_4443065
yes . 4443485_4443865
(0.7) so would you calculate like I know you said &~y that you guess all three at the same time and then you &~qui (0.4) I'm not it's not making as much ⌈ <sense to me> ⌉ . 4448385_4461445
⌊ <if you> if you ⌋ guess the three temperatures right ? 4461485_4463485

so what's the problem ? 4467725_4468285
oh okay . 4468825_4469645
I see what you're saying . 4470825_4471505
it's &~ju but I'm just yeah ⌈ yeah ⌉ . 4472025_4474685
⌊ you ⌋ don't understand what ? 4474685_4475705
no I just don't understand like what &~sh I should go about doing first . 4475865_4479365
you just guess three temperatures you know all your h@l-s right ? 4480925_4484785
if you guess the three temperatures ⌈ okay ⌉ ? 4485525_4488425
⌊ then you ⌋ do know the h@l-s . 4488425_4489505

yes yes okay . 4500065_4502705
does that make sense ? 4503285_4503865

⌊ <no no> no no no . 4514145_4515045
no no . 4515045_4515265
calculate one ⌋ at a time you know why ? 4515285_4516725
because the Q that's going in here depends on this H right ? 4517075_4521635
mhm .
right ? 4522535_4523415
you can't just jump from here to here because first of all &-um ⌈ if you ⌉ . 4523475_4529335
⌊ (be)cause all ⌋ of the three temperatures depend on each_other . 4529335_4531235
yeah they all ⌈ depend on each_other ⌉ +/. 4531415_4532575
⌊ so everything ⌋ +/.
+, so you &~kn you need to know this H right ? 4532735_4534715
so you can't really guess just one temperature . 4534915_4536975
okay . 4537535_4537855
okay ? 4538335_4538635
but it makes sense if I do that for the first part . 4538935_4541035
yes because for the first part you can jump from the inside of the room to here right away . 4541865_4546105
but in the second part if you want to jump from the inside of the room to the outside of the window on your way there's an H that you don't know so you can't calculate a resistance for this part . 4546745_4554825
unless you know these temperatures &~wh which you guess . 4555525_4557545
okay . 4558005_4558225

&-um <do you> do you need a rho ? 4595985_4598725

you need a rho for what ? 4600345_4601985
a density &~o of rho of the oil flowing through the pipe ? 4601985_4605625

yeah if you're modeling it as a flow over flat plate . 5281445_5284825
okay . 5285025_5285245
well then I can change that but I don't think it will change it that much so then I just found I found that <as in> turbulent and I think it'd still be if I used a thousand . 5285625_5293905
yeah because it's even higher right ? 5294125_5295765
yeah oh yeah &=laughs . 5296225_5296725
because L is even ⌈ higher ⌉ +/. 5296865_5297745
⌊ yeah ⌋ &=laughs +/.

so it's &~t +/. 5298225_5298605
+, okay +/.
+, just say it's still ⌈ turbulent ⌉ . 5298785_5299965
⌊ okay ⌋ . 5300165_5300185
so then I could find an equation for Nusselt . 5300305_5302225
correct +/. 5302945_5303265
+, and I got P at +//. 5303985_5305085
&{l=SIC Prandalt &}l=SIC from there +/. 5305425_5306325
+, mhm +/.
+, I have that so then I can find an H . 5306845_5309385
okay and is this an average H or a local H ? 5309965_5313805
it'd be average . 5314125_5315885
okay . 5316225_5316665
I think the equation &=looking_in_book xxx that's a good question . 5317845_5322605
&-uh yeah page <two forty nine> .
(0.4) <oh yeah> (0.4) both parallel looks like Nusselt (0.4) I don't know yeah I I'll just used this it said for turbulent region yeah and this is for REL okay so yeah it should work . 5339205_5346125
right .
now that thing +//. 5346745_5349405
you remember we talked about this in the class that this is for the case where all of your heat transfer is occurring in the turbulent regime . 5349685_5357005
oh ⌈ oh so I should do a laminar xxx ⌉ . 5357845_5359185
⌊ so that's that's what they say ⌋ like the completely turbulent region . 5359185_5362425
oh +/.
+, so this is a &~fo only for the case where all the heat transfer is occurring in the turbulent regime . 5363185_5367365
+, mhm +/.
+, now in this problem part of it is in the ⌈ laminar ⌉ regime right ? 5367945_5371245
+, oh +/.
+, now the way that you wanna go about this is you need to calculate a you need to calculate an average H for the whole thing . 5371365_5385645
okay ⌊ so ⌋ . 5386225_5386625
⌈ okay ⌉ .
do you kinda do you use like a what a <level ruler or covar@n> or like because &~y you know a set length's gonna be in laminar and a set's gonna be in turbulent . 5387495_5394815
yes . 5395215_5395455
so then you take the average like they're weighted or something ⌊ or xxx ⌋ . 5395495_5398755
⌈ &-um ⌉ you okay but considering the turbulent how do you want to consider the turbulent part say that &-um tell me how you want to consider the turbulent part . 5398935_5408055

⌈ yes ⌉ okay lemme give you a hint you work on this because it's not you can't really see it unless you start working on it mathematically . 5420635_5428375

yeah oh well I can find some more paper . 5433975_5435575
here just <take this one off> &=laughs:S15 &=pause_while_removing_paper okay so &~wha the &~f the way we calculate the average heat transfer coefficient is we just integrate it over the whole thing over the whole length right ? 5441545_5452025
so we say h@l average is just one over length okay the integral from zero to L of h@l local DX . 5452485_5461485

this is +/. 5462945_5463125
⌊ oh ⌋ +/.

+, H is varying with X so we &~inte we integrate it from zero to L over X and then we divide by L to get a right dimension right ? 5471175_5477635

now the way we wanna do it here we want to break this because we have two different equations for &~i local heat ⌊ transfer ⌋ +/. 5478115_5485095

they don't give it to you they just give you the average one right ? 5524415_5527535

you add up resistances from where to where ? 5715515_5718635
you assume you start somewhere under rho and you're given an H for the air and you're given a K for the glass . 5719385_5725605
mhm +/.

if you want to put sixty five minus zero you have to go from inside all the way to the outside . 5749875_5754455
you're going only to the ⌈ surface of the glass right ⌉ ? 5755135_5757055

first it's like right and we're we're only talking about part A &~yo we haven't put the plastic insulation yet . 5783185_5788225
okay ?
okay . 5788645_5788665
so &-um &~th doing doing it the same way <you can> you can talk about this you can say that Q is delta two over R . 5788965_5797165
R being this but then delta t@l is from the inside of the room to the outside surface of the window . 5797485_5801965
the temperature of which we don't know . 5802285_5804185
okay +/.

but let's say if we wanted to go from the inside of the room all the way to the outside . 5807845_5812905

+, ⌊ oh ⌋ +/.
+, do we have to put in here ? 5818625_5819305
you just have to add a natural convection ⌈ <to it> . 5819305_5821365
okay ⌉ .
⌊ right you ⌋ have to add the natural convection right ? 5821385_5823245
mhm +/.
+, and natural convection itself depends on the temperature of the window . 5823505_5827565

because it it's it depends on the delta t@l that you have between the vertical plate and the bulk ⌈ right ⌉ ? 5829105_5835905
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, so not knowing that temperature you can't really do anything right now . 5836145_5840445
okay ?
so but let's say if we guess that temperature let's see where we can go . 5841245_5845745
if ⌊ we ⌋ +/. 5846165_5846365

⌊ right ⌋ ? 5853465_5853485
⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ mhm ⌋ .
we can calculate the Q . 5853725_5855165
now once we calculate the Q we can say that same Q goes from the inside to the right surface through the outside of this which is this formula . 5855905_5866845
mhm +/.
+, and then recalculate that temperature . 5867845_5869425
right and check your T and if it's not the same T then you do it all over ⌈ again ⌉ . 5870085_5873405
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
put that &~che if you get +//. 5873785_5874945
you get a new &~tem &-uh you get a new temperature for the outside of the glass right ? 5875045_5877945
with that new temperature calculate the heat transfer coefficient here again do the same thing again . 5878105_5882465
so <the first> the first Q you calculate is just from the outside glass to the outside air from like here to here using natural convection ? 5882665_5890285
<you can do that> you can do that if you want you can jump from here to here <you can> you can do whichever you want because the Q is the same . 5890565_5895765
⌈ right ⌉ +/.

so you have the same Q you can either go from here to here you +//. 5897285_5899565
or you can go from here to here . 5899745_5900805

right . 5905975_5906415

+, because you have these two plates at two different temperatures so air starts rising on the &~col on the hot side and then going down on the cold side so it'll start circulating ⌊ like this ⌋ . 5969885_5977905
⌈ mhm ⌉ oh okay . 5978185_5978645
so it's like the same thing that you ⌊ had ⌋ +/. 5978705_5980205
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, with an enclosed &-um compartment that you had you know like air in . 5980235_5984795
oh okay .
and it was circulating so your characteristic dimension would be the gap ⌊ dimension ⌋ . 5985135_5988995
⌈ oh ⌉ okay . 5989275_5989715
⌊ oh yeah ⌋ .
⌈ okay ⌉ ? 5990255_5990675
and then the length is how tall the window is ? 5990675_5994055
yes . 5994055_5994375
oh I forgot xxx .
so &~thi this part you know the gap part is exactly the same as what he &-um solved for you in the lecture . 5995255_6003935
right +/.
⌊ Professor Thompson ⌋ +/. 6004455_6005375
+, ⌈ where he had ⌉ his delta characteristic . 6005535_6006555
right the delta characteristic right ? 6007375_6008855
we called it delta xxx . 6009015_6009575
oh okay .
okay so you have that thing too it's just like a whatever I mean the &~gra the normal gap that you would have and you have air circulating in it that ⌊ part ⌋ +/. 6009975_6018595
⌈ mkay ⌉ +/.
+, right ? 6018895_6019015
mhm .
so you can calculate that too &-um . 6019135_6023375
so once again you don't know so once again you have to do natural convection again get the Q (be)cause you still don't know the temperature . 6023615_6030235
right you +//. 6030635_6031355
there are several things that you don't know in part B let's draw ⌊ a picture first ⌋ . 6031615_6035115
⌈ do you wanna piece of paper ⌉ ?
&=laughs:multiple .
yeah I'm writing on the newspaper okay . 6036115_6038395
&-um let's draw a picture this is the window and this is the plastic okay ? 6040035_6044975
so we have this fan here we know H here now we know +//. 6045235_6051055
<we don't know this temperature> we don't know this temperature we don't know this temperature &=laughs:multiple we don't know this temperature <we don't know this H> we don't know this H . 6051275_6057355
right &=laughs:multiple . 6057595_6058315
right ? 6058575_6058795
so we don't know anything . 6058875_6059835
but let's say first of all do we need this temperature or not ? 6060955_6063895
this one inside of the plastic . 6063995_6066135
I don't think so . 6066255_6068775
unhunh .
we really don't need it . 6069195_6070535
the temperatures that we need are these ones because we need them for the natural convection right ? 6070715_6074435
so we need this this and this . 6074615_6078135
right . 6078395_6078715
so there are three different temperatures that we don't know but let's let's see if we guess them okay let's see <if we> if we guess the three temperatures can we calculate them all at +//. 6079225_6089905
all in one iteration step or not ? 6090385_6091905
okay ? 6092745_6092765
okay . 6093165_6093645
so let's say we call this t@l one we call this t@l two and we call this t@l three right ? 6094025_6097785
⌊ mhm ⌋ .
⌈ okay ⌉ .
if we know these temperatures we can calculate this H and this H right ? 6097925_6101945
mhm .
because they're just natural convection they only depend on the delta t@l and the characteristics here and the +/. 6102085_6106705
right +/.
+, you know like the you know the dimensions you can calculate the physical properties if you know the temperatures . 6106905_6111225
so ⌊ you ⌋ +/. 6111645_6111825
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, guess these three let's say +/. 6112005_6113085
+, uhuh +/.
+, and then you calculate <this H> this H . 6113705_6115905
now knowing the h@l-s can you calculate the Q ? 6116445_6118885
mhm .
yes because you know this temperature in ⌊ and you know this temperature out ⌋ . 6119645_6124225
+, so you can go &~al from here to here +/. 6124705_6126105
+, okay +/.
+, or you can go from here to here or from here to here ⌊ whatever ⌋ +/. 6126225_6128685

you can calculate them +/. 6129385_6130525
+, right +/. 6130905_6130985
+, okay ? 6131105_6131385
so in the first step if you guess t@l one t@l two t@l three you can then go and calculate them all of them . 6132265_6141625
⌊ right ⌋ ? 6141985_6142005
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/. 6142505_6142785
+, t@l one t@l two t@l three then just repeat them . 6142785_6144645
right . 6144945_6145025
⌊ mhm ⌋ .
⌈ so ⌉ it's exactly the same thing as part A it's just like &~th three different things that you don't know and you &~gue guess all of them at once and calculate all of them in one step . 6145305_6152865
okay . 6153405_6154245
okay ? 6154325_6154485
and using a spreadsheet is much easier because you just put the formulas in you can say okay whatever H you calculated for here put it in this formula for you know like resistances in series go from here to here calculate this go from here to here calculate this go from here to here calculate this +/. 6154585_6168505
mhm +/.
+, and once you get these three put (th)em in the next row t@l one t@l two t@l three that you just calculated do the same thing until they converge . 6169105_6175525
oh okay . 6175745_6175905
okay . 6176645_6176925

I &~h I heard what you were just saying .

because it depends on delta t@l-s . 6274915_6276135
but this &~natur this convection &-uh coefficient you already have it so you don't even need this T . 6276735_6281495

⌈ okay ⌉ yeah yeah . 6282775_6283255

there're four t@l-s that that're unknown but you that +//. 6285315_6287555
there's one of them that is of no use so we just like disregard that one we guess these three +... 6287875_6291695
okay ? 6292255_6294295
okay . 6294715_6294955

⌈ &-um ⌉ on the second problem I was wondering for if that's an okay equation circuit for that kinda <it's Prandtl> . 6320445_6328585
that's where I went off of is this and I got to there . 6329685_6333925
&-um lemme see what exactly you did you're saying energy over time is Q over A +/. 6335885_6343385

&-um is this Q ? 6346665_6348365
what is this Q ? 6348795_6349675
oh okay so if you say let's see okay so this Q looks like it's a flux right ? 6350035_6359255
yeah . 6360275_6360395
okay so if you divide that flux by area ⌊ again ⌋ . 6361275_6363575
⌈ yeah ⌉ so I don't want that there if I &~ha say Q is like that . 6363595_6366215
yeah .
so you don't wanna do this . 6366955_6370875
now . 6371515_6371535
I didn't really mean that . 6371615_6372615
&=laughs .
okay . 6372935_6373195
(be)cause I haven't ⌊ <written it yet> ⌋ . 6373395_6374055
⌈ so ⌉ and you're saying like energy over time right ? 6374465_6377165
mhm .
will be Q . 6377825_6378665
if this Q is the flux then you need energy over area over time to have the flux right ? 6379165_6386325
okay .
correct ?
yeah .
okay so but let's &~i &~wha <these are just> &-um these are just dimensions that we want to &-um lemme just alright ? 6386525_6396505
these are just &-um dimensions that you want to correct but let's see what your solution scheme is what you want to do &~l next . 6396855_6403715
&-um let's say you correct this +/. 6404755_6405815
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, dimensionwise right ? 6406495_6407075
you want to say that &-um okay explain to me what you're doing here &-um +... 6407435_6415415
okay you're &~s here well alright here you're saying that the energy that you're &-um giving to the system will go into melting the ice . 6418995_6428915
+, mhm +/.
+, and melting the ice will be like okay melting the ice will cause it to shrink right ? 6429715_6437075
yeah . 6437135_6437195
okay that's correct . 6437795_6439095
where do you want to get this E from though ? 6439335_6440995
you wanna get it from here . 6441715_6443355
&-um (0.4) okay why are you &~c worrying about this conduction in the ice ? 6445065_6452925
+, ⌊ let's look ⌋ at the picture draw me a picture of this . 6453465_6457785
I guess you should .
(0.14) yeah since this is melting this would be at zero degrees . 6472435_6476395
so water <is at> so this is gonna have xxx . 6477535_6483155
okay yeah . 6483575_6485315
so you're saying that okay &~dra show me where the conduction is from where ⌈ from where to where ⌉ . 6485895_6490975
⌊ I guess it wouldn't ⌋ because as soon as &-um the energy would just have to pass through the water's resistance I guess to get in there ? 6491035_6499295
yeah the energy goes through the +//. 6499915_6501655
yeah through resistance for the convection and then gets to the surface and that's +/. 6502075_6505295
⌈ yeah and that's +//.
+, ⌊ all we worry about ⌋ . 6505455_6506095
yeah ⌈ okay yeah ⌉ . 6506495_6506955
⌊ right ?
so we don't ⌋ really need +/. 6506955_6507835
⌈ unhunh unhunh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that conduction right ⌋ ? 6507995_6508755
okay so that's fine . 6508855_6510895
now so you say the only thing that we need here is just like the H of water times the area of_course to get the total Q not the flux +/. 6511115_6522115
+, mhm +/.
+, and then we can relate that to the energy that is used for melting the ice . 6522515_6526155
okay . 6526395_6526715
the solution scheme is absolutely correct the only thing is how do you get this H then ? 6526945_6531425
H for water ? 6531745_6532265
yeah I wasn't sure because I know that they're traveling together so I thought ⌈ maybe ⌉ . 6532365_6537045
⌊ they're not ⌋ traveling together the the &-um the ice is being towed . 6537045_6542145
so the ice is traveling at the speed that we gave you but water is stagnant +... 6543065_6547285
okay ? 6548305_6550025
so there's &~i the the ice is traveling in stagnant water . 6550425_6553505
so what does that look like in terms of what you've learned before ? 6555845_6559025
I would (0.15) hm I wanna say natural convection but I don't think that that's it . 6560505_6583565
&=laughs .
natural convection is &-um okay natural convection is when the if this thing were ⌈ &-um ⌉ +/. 6583845_6589565
⌊ were ⌋ still +/.
+, stagnant too right ? 6590565_6591225
but it's not . 6591325_6592305
it's not it's moving . 6592305_6592925
(0.6) so if you have a plate that is moving in the water if you start moving with the plate what will you see ? 6593445_6604645
from the observer's point of view ? 6605545_6609205
you know like the observer's moving <with the> with the plate . 6609515_6612515
okay ? 6612895_6613095
so from the observer's point of view the plate is stagnant now . 6613235_6616555
correct ?
if it's moving with the same ⌈ speed ⌉ +/. 6617735_6619735
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, as the plate . 6619935_6620455
so then the water would be moving ⌈ if ⌉ +/. 6620695_6621995
⌊ right ⌋ +/. 6621995_6622395
+, you were at that ⌈ point ⌉ .
⌊ what ⌋ does that look like then ? 6622555_6623535
then that looks like flow past a flat plate . 6624055_6626595
exactly . 6626655_6627055
exactly . 6627875_6628275
so it looks like flow over over a flat plate . 6628775_6631075

+, so ⌈ and ⌉ +/. 6631615_6632035

times point +//. 8522765_8524165

mhm .
from here it's turbulent . 9074105_9075045
now this equation holds when all of the heat transfer starts <when the> &~tur when the &-um viscous boundary layer is already turbulent . 9075545_9083365

so it's laminar for some part and then it starts to become turbulent right ? 9130705_9134165
so for the first part of the thing it's laminar . 9134545_9138685
but I would say do something . 9139225_9141085
go and check where it becomes laminar . 9141485_9144065
