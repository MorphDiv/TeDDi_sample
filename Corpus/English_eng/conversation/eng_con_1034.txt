I do n't think I 'm certain there 's not . 610683_611843
I think it 's much to do about nothing quite honestly . 611843_613763
I do . 613763_613903
I mean it may well be that we have to resort to some sort of er . 614743_617363

Mm Mm . 629373_629903
pond with all those plastic ducks on . 630033_631523
Flipping ducks on it Yeah I know . 631523_632743
That might have been some deterrent of some description . 632743_635403
I do n't think so somehow That was just . 636193_637603
but I 'm n I 'm certainly not having little plastic ducks . 637753_640023
Art nouveau 0 .

Yes I 've watched him sort of er warily . 710833_713643
Waiting . 713643_713793
walk round But then he got so used to it that he did n't bother . 713793_716253
Mm yeah That 's what I mean It may if it 's any effect at all it 's
Mm I do n't think pepper 's a very useful deterrent I 've sprinkled
No . 725083_725153
pepper round . 725153_725723
One shower of rain and you 've lost it anyway . 726003_727413
Mm . 727553_727633
I 'd have thought Mm . 728063_731773
I think the only deterrent is putting netting or something over it
Mm . 740023_740083
you ca n't put netting over your whole garden can you It 's silly .
No no We 'll have to watch that pond though leaves next year . 742973_750643

It was unnecessary was n't it oh yes I 'll want a bit of a hand
Yeah . 823703_823713

What . 856743_856853

The casing round the other cupboard . 873973_877233
Mm . 877233_877403

Yeah Pick him up at twenty five to four . 991703_1003453
There 's a heck of a lot of burning off when you come to think of
Oh god I know You 're telling me . 1007653_1010083
But then . 1010133_1010873
Where possible I 'll sand down obviously but there 's there . 1010873_1012943
Yes but usually . 1012943_1013433
wo n't be many places I 'd have thought . 1013433_1014913
There is n't It 's . 1014923_1015503
No . 1015503_1015613
Cos it 's been piled on so . 1015623_1017003
Yeah I ca n't get over that screw in the woodwork . 1017873_1020263
I know . 1020263_1020783
Good god I 've seen dust before but and bits of fluff and rag and
Well it 's the same as the the way they 've papered the walls round
They 've papered over I know I know Mm . 1032273_1034763
It would n't have been if they 'd had any furniture in when we when
Oh the you mean Oh aye . 1042143_1043313
mm . 1044953_1045213
Mm Mm No coming back to the I would prefer to keep it in natural
Oh yeah . 1057663_1057973
all those splodges of white are putty . 1057973_1060373
Are they . 1060553_1061523
Mm Unfortunately . 1063553_1063773
And there 's nothing at all you can cover them with . 1063783_1066733
Well except to take them out Scrape the bits of putty out and put
I think that 'd be better . 1074753_1077563
Mm But that 's a fairly long job though . 1077563_1079753
Er yes but I mean it it it would be worth it . 1079753_1086973
Mm See it wo n't accept stain anyway with that varnish on . 1088963_1092543
Well I do n't like this colour stain anyway . 1092543_1094753
Well I do n't . 1094753_1094933
It 's a nasty colour . 1095153_1097043
You ca n't burn that off though It 's dust . 1097053_1098853
You could n't . 1098863_1100243
What . 1100323_1100453
just give a dab of paint over A dark paint . 1100453_1102523
It 'd stand out a mile would n't it . 1102523_1103863
Would it . 1104333_1105513
Well perhaps not as obviously . 1105513_1106673
Well if you did it with a small brush . 1106673_1108193
Well it would still stand out would n't it cos it 's a different
You do n't . 1111213_1111553
not as obvious perhaps as the white but . 1111553_1112823
That 's what I mean . 1112823_1114453
Mm Mm But I 'll have to get rid of all that varnish before it 'll
Mm See what it 's like . 1119173_1122873
I what it 's like when . 1122873_1124493
When you 've got rid of the varnish . 1124503_1126983
Mm I may have to use varnish stripper Get a kind of varnish
Well it might be better than erm doing it any other way because . 1130513_1134843
I do n't think it 'll burn off . 1134853_1137083
No I 'm thinking of the fumes . 1137093_1143113
After all the other fumes I do n't think that 'll matter . 1143113_1146593
After what . 1146593_1146783
After the fumes of the paintwork I do n't think that 'll . 1146783_1149373
Wo n't that be worse than . 1149373_1150823
No Not as bad as No no . 1150823_1158623
Oh Cos I remember when you did twenty seven . 1158623_1161483
Mm Ah well that was a varnish paint . 1161483_1162723
That was quite . 1163073_1163423
That was a varnish paint . 1163423_1164583
And that wo n't that 'll just be stain . 1164583_1168163
Varnish No It is a stain varnish In other words varnish with a
Mm . 1180843_1181153
As opposed to staining the wood and then varnishing it with . 1181653_1183123
Oh I see . 1183123_1183933
relatively clear varnish . 1185273_1191063
Mm Once we 've got those tiles off at the bottom there . 1191063_1193553
Mm . 1193553_1193613
well we might as well paint . 1193613_1195513
Well I think I mean they 're very nice it would rather I 'd prefer
They 're a bit messy are n't they . 1206293_1208763
Mm One two three four five six seven eight twenty four Two dozen Mm
How many did we get in the pack . 1217633_1218983
The pack I do n't know . 1218983_1219513
I think it was twenty five . 1219513_1221163
I really do n't know Oh it varies the pack does n't it . 1221163_1224483
Mm . 1224483_1224553
Think it is twenty five actually pack anyway . 1224553_1230383
But erm finding the right tile . 1233093_1237213
Yeah . 1237213_1237393
In any case you do n't want them all the same do you I think we 're
Does n't really matter all that much I 'd skim over the plaster
Mm Be a right mess wo n't it . 1246803_1250903
Mm It 's highly probable I 'll finish up skimming anyway . 1250913_1253223
Mm I was just thinking that . 1253343_1254883
mm . 1254883_1255013
I mean the way what have they done here . 1255013_1258893
Well what have they done anywhere Mm . 1258893_1262633
Well they ran short of tiles or they ha they would n't be bothered
That 's more likely the case Mm . 1266473_1267213
One two three four . 1267213_1270213
Twenty four . 1270213_1270653
five six seven eight . 1271223_1276263

Yes there was three more there . 1277763_1280143
Mm . 1280843_1281033
So that ma er in any case they 'd of got some of it being the two
Yeah . 1286683_1286823
It looks quite effective . 1286893_1289103
Oh it 's quite effective if it 's done correctly yes As it is now
Have you had some cake . 1294303_1295913

Mm . 1409573_1409683
But erm It 's gon na make a hell of a racket sanding down
Well it ca n't be helped . 1419153_1419733
No it ca n't be helped no I 'll probably have to get some medium
with us making a row wo n't they . 1437783_1441233

not do it late just keep stopping before it gets too late . 1465173_1468783
Well exactly what we have been doing . 1468783_1469763
Cos it is annoying is n't it you know . 1469763_1473553
Oh yeah . 1473553_1473803
But there 's not an awful lot you can do is there I mean if we had
They 'd still do yeah . 1478123_1478773
they 'd make more noise would n't they . 1478773_1480373

An old fella . 1772493_1773173
Yeah Well not an old fella necessarily . 1773373_1782183
I 'm still sort of puzzling what the best thing best thing to do
Hang on What seems to change . 1799163_1800243
The hedge If you look from here . 1800593_1802353
In what way does it ch . 1802353_1804043
Well if you look from here . 1804243_1805463
I 'm looking from here . 1805483_1806203
And then you go along . 1806203_1807053
I 'm going along . 1807053_1807723
By the time it gets to that all that rubbish that we 're going to
Er y oh yes there in front . 1811743_1812843
Well then if you look it tends to change to a different variety
Oh it does there See what you mean Yes Yeah . 1816103_1818483
I do n't . 1818483_1819213
it definitely does change does n't it Mm . 1819213_1820033
I do n't know what they are but one of those trees has little
Yes . 1823953_1824393
So it obviously . 1824393_1824763
I 'm not surprised they 're poor . 1824763_1826163
I know I know . 1826163_1828093
Mm . 1828533_1828593
But erm it wants the roots clearing . 1828593_1831283
Yeah . 1831283_1831393
and feeding and . 1831393_1832733
Mm Mm Mhm . 1832793_1833013
It 's a shame though to let them die because th they 're I like to
Oh you 're getting back to the privet hedge and suburbia are n't
That gives interest especially . 1846453_1847743
Same . 1847743_1847893
into the corner . 1848113_1848543
Mm that 's why I do n't want to clip that erm bottom hedge too
No but I think . 1853143_1853993
Lop it down Yes I agree Lop it down but erm . 1853993_1856293
I think we need to for th this time round because it 'll soon get
Take its own . 1863093_1864103
0 .
Mm Mm Yes maybe you 're right . 1864103_1865443
But I do think for now we 're just going to have to cu chop it down
Mm . 1868363_1868563
It 's going to get worse and worse if we do n't . 1868563_1872923
Have to keep our eyes open for a decent er path cutter hedge cutter
Yes I looked in the paper to see if there was any . 1877233_1879173
No there were n't . 1879183_1879573
They 're very expensive to buy are n't they . 1879573_1881663
Oh new they are certainly yes . 1881663_1882833
Yes and you want a double action one . 1882833_1885483
Preferably Not essentially . 1885483_1886313
I I would n't think that erm like the different length of the
I do n't think you need the think it 's a twenty four is it no . 1891493_1894583
I would think they 're more trouble than they 're worth unless you
Yeah They could be . 1897503_1898203
a great big . 1899503_1900013
Mm Oh and you 'd have to be that little bit more careful too . 1900013_1902953
Mm Yes exactly . 1902953_1907183
Mm Mm . 1907693_1908053
I think that 's what .
And again unless the motor is fairly hefty . 1909493_1914453
Mm . 1914473_1915003
it could conceivably be easy to burn the motor out Because it 's
I do n't . 1919283_1919733
Mm well in theory A bigger area bigger length You 're cutting more
Yeah I was looking at the petrol driven ones . 1922543_1925083
Good god . 1925083_1925673
I know That 's what I thought . 1925683_1927333
Stone the crows Cor . 1927483_1928783
It took me breath away so . 1928783_1930683
Good gracious me . 1930683_1932133
Mm . 1932393_1932653

Just how . 1934773_1936863
What . 1938273_1938523
much erm how much can you cut with those as opposed to having
Chainsaw . 1948813_1948973
chainsaw I could n't forget the word The chainsaw . 1948983_1950863
Oh they 'll take er do a fair amount of work but erm I think
Well I know that . 1956593_1957173
Yeah hang on Hang on In a well established hedge like that . 1957173_1960613
Yeah . 1960613_1960783
I would think er the loppers if the erm hedgecutter wo n't tackle
Yes but what I was thinking more . 1965373_1967223
Mm . 1967223_1967373
is the rest of the round there round at the side there I mean a lot
Er I would n't like to put er erm a hedgecutter through that erm
Which bush . 1981903_1983093
Well the one where the hedge terminates and . 1983093_1989593
Mm well . 1989593_1990023
That dead looking e well dead . 1990023_1992473
No No but would it do to I mean you 're going to have a lot of the
Yeah . 1999403_1999533
to put to if we 're getting a trailer and getting rid of it all . 1999533_2003113
Yeah Yeah . 2003123_2004333
You 're going to have to cut it down still further into smaller
Oh I see what you mean to cram on the trailer Yes Yes yes . 2008933_2011433
Will a hedgecutter do there or will you have to u revert to erm a
Er combination of both I should think I well I 'm not too concerned
Oh handsaw Oh that 's hard work . 2029453_2030683
No No no no no not the really not the thick ones . 2030683_2033463
Mm . 2034393_2034523
But erm . 2034523_2035123
Well I was just thinking of taking the work out of it . 2035123_2038483
0 .
Mm it 's one hell of a lot of work . 2038523_2039713
But you see we do n't really need a chainsaw do we . 2039713_2043123
No I would n't say so normal but er there 's quite a lot to . 2043133_2046343
No No No To hire one possibly for a specific specific job but . 2046343_2050023
I wonder how much they are to hire . 2050023_2052013
Not very dear . 2052283_2052613
Oh are n't they . 2052613_2053343
What erm chainsaws . 2053713_2055693
Mm . 2055853_2056493
I think last time I looked at the hire list price price list . 2056493_2059973
Mm . 2060113_2060533
I think about five six quid a day something like that they were
Oh that 's not bad really . 2066283_2067363
Oh it is n't bad if you 've got a lot of erm chainsaw work to do
Yeah . 2075603_2075843
Mm Now whether that 's erm including all the protective clothing or
I do n't know . 2080403_2081413
There might be a different charge for that but . 2081793_2084063
Er did you think any more about the er rubbish clearance that was
Oh the twelve quid 's worth was n't it Was it twelve Sixteen . 2092453_2095243
Sixteen quid for one load What 's a load . 2095723_2098013
What is well yes Anything that 'll fill a skip it 'll be a skip . 2098013_2101053
Skip . 2101053_2101553
And I suspect that 'll be the smallest skip I do n't know . 2101553_2103643
I would imagine so . 2103743_2104213
Did it say from What did it just say . 2104213_2107513
No I think it just said sixteen pounds a load and I . 2107513_2109693
Mm Mm Mm . 2109743_2110083
thought mm I wonder how much a load is . 2110083_2112143
Well yes it 's probably the smallest skip . 2112152_2114103
But it 'd save a lot of hard work if you got rid of quite a lot of
See I do n't see erm them shifting very much for that because by
Well if this is a skip It might just be a trailer . 2130503_2133073
It might be a trailer It might be an open back lorry you know . 2133073_2137133
Mm . 2137133_2137263
Mm . 2137263_2137413
A lorry . 2137413_2137673
Yeah . 2137673_2137813
Well we could get rid of qu I doubt it whether they 're going to
Well you know mm . 2140953_2142173
I doubt that . 2143003_2143483
But again on a costing basis I mean hourly How long is it gon na
Yes but I 'm thinking I mean there 's so much to do here Larry you
Er I had noticed Yes Yes Yes . 2155273_2157923
It 's no good wearing yourself out if you can get anything done . 2157923_2160383
I was worn out already What are you on about . 2160383_2162743
You know what I mean . 2162743_2163903
I 'm knackered Mm . 2164613_2166073
But it makes sense to me to have a little bit of help . 2166073_2169453
Oh I 'm not adverse to having bit of help . 2169453_2171493
Mm . 2171493_2171553
you know of the right sort No no no no no no no Erm . 2171573_2177053
You 're usually pretty independent . 2177303_2180123
A little perhaps but er I mean you can have people that are more
Mm . 2186093_2186343
Spend your time watching . 2186343_2187083
Well you know the all the stuff that you 've got at the side where
Ah well that 's straight on the trailer yeah . 2190232_2191983
Is it . 2191983_2192243
Well more more or less yeah One or two things I 'll be keeping but
Ah but I was n't just meaning on the concrete bit I was meaning on
Oh that 's not rubbish that 's just erm off the trees is n't it . 2207513_2210573
Well it 's still got to be got rid of has n't it . 2210573_2212513
Chuck it over the fence and it 'll go straight in more or less
It 'll be just like you to get your trailer and your car down there
Oh highly probable Sod 's law yes . 2224023_2225163
I know I ca n't get over the fact that that all . 2225163_2232373
What . 2232403_2232683
all through the winter we 've had daisies all over the grass . 2232683_2236673
Oh yes you mean the fact that they 've been in flower Mm Mm . 2236673_2240423
You do n't usually see daisies do you . 2240523_2242693
I honestly do n't know Nina I do n't know . 2242703_2244803
Mm do n't think it 's dry enough to cut the grass is it . 2245083_2247363
Oh I w no I would n't do it today No crikey no . 2247363_2250683
No I do n't think so It does n't look very promising . 2250692_2256473
No . 2257693_2257783
0 .
Mm Mm . 2257783_2258023

Oh yes . 2260663_2260843
Have to do a bit at a time . 2261873_2263483
I 'm going to investigate see if I ca n't do a conv I do n't think
Oh it might be more trouble than it 's worth . 2279653_2281653
It might be It might sound a bit potty but utilizing that small
Ah do n't use . 2286793_2288263
No . 2288263_2288583
No I I prefer using it just as it is quite frankly . 2288733_2292283
Well i it 's not a big thing it 's only you know what I mean do n't
Yes I know what you mean but I do n't fancy you messing about with
No . 2301533_2301673
Cos I find it if there 's anything else attached to it . 2301673_2305433
It depends which mounting Keep the centre of gravity low and there
No I do n't I ca n't agree with you there . 2309962_2312663
Mm Maybe not no . 2312663_2312993
No leave well alone . 2312993_2317113
Mm . 2317113_2317173
do n't you And then you just make a mess of what you 've already
It 's quite possible but erm . 2320583_2324623
Mm but I I mean I can use it as it is now but anything else on to
Well I 'm gon na bash on with the erm . 2332233_2334563
Right are you ready for the window yet . 2334563_2336953
