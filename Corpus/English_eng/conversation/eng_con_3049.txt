from step one and explain it to me how you made it . 70_2980
I just copied the core . 3240_4380
and then I flipped it sideways . 5220_9110
that was this . 11830_12430
and I I guess I look at this . 15480_20730
and this I just turned . 29220_31180
it's time to bundle up . 42670_43960
Nathan &-um <I turn> I turn I'm here one fourth &-um right one
and then I flipped it . 64140_65510
then I just copied the floor again . 66010_67510
uhhuh . 67920_67980
okay . 68510_68780
maybe we can talk about it after the recess . 69130_70990
okay . 71310_71440
okay . 71650_71790
or later in the afternoon . 72420_73930

oh yeah . 96160_96380
how I wanna be a kindergarten teacher . 97020_99460
today . 99520_99770
for all the money in the world . 99980_100920
wouldn't that be awful . 101120_101910
why is that first snow boots coming to school for the first time
I'd be it I guess I'd be a could dressed for recess . 108130_110140
but then for pen dress Eses kid dressed for home . 110260_112390
it's part of the curriculum . 112550_113660
that's right . 113920_114340
that's all they would do . 114360_115140
really good . 115220_115630
it's so . 116510_117110
okay . 117710_117950
so &-um Carmen where are you at today . 118020_120020
and &-uh what's going on . 120100_121470
we're in the planning phase for our next big project . 121520_124420
we wound up or as close as we could come for some kids . 124770_127140
the quilt family Booklet project which was their first design
they used a course where they had designed and formed all the
now we're actually going to make a finished quilt a strip quilt . 136900_141510
and we're still in the planning phases of that . 141700_143580
they're working in teams of two all except one team has three
and they designed &-um their own core square after selecting a
and today their job was to make the tools they would need to help
so they needed six two-sided core squares . 162040_164710
so &-um in most cases they made three each . 164990_167340
and now they're generating all the possibilities . 167580_170340
I'm sorry . 172100_172380
I keep looking at Sarah and Katie's generating all the
we're I'm hoping for five or six different ways that a strip using
then they're gonna be selecting one of those strips . 185170_187230
&-um and making a second manipulative for each of them to have a
and then they'll use that one strip made on graph paper scaled down
they'll &-um color in how all six of those strips are gonna look .
and then they'll start actually working with &-um squares and
and &-uh what do you see as the mathematics involved . 222270_224460
here . 224480_224590
I mean what do they get out_of this . 224840_226270
versus just designing those two by two designs . 226320_229110
why not just stop there . 229830_230540
well this this is different . 233910_235390
this idea of taking a whole strip and then using that as your
uhhuh . 239340_239430
&-um and also getting to a finished quilt . 239580_242340
none of those are finished quilts . 242360_243670
I mean they're they're one part of a quilt . 243800_245660
and we are gonna make &-um full-size quilts from nine of those two
but &-um they're ready to do a finished quilt . 250970_253980
now see not just you design within each strip with flips and turns
but then you you look at the design of the hole . 258260_261540
so there's the design of your core square . 261890_263540
there's design of the two by two or the strip the next step from
and then what do you do with your strip or your two by two design
that's a design piece in and of itself . 273060_275020
&-um so you're not done designing just when you select a courseware
and you've thought about what are all the different design
I noticed you were asking Sarah and Katie that you bring it up . 291560_294420
mhm . 294440_294560
&-uh questions about . 294930_295780
okay . 296280_296500
so you've got this core square these six of them now . 296560_300070
mhm . 300120_300260
how are you gonna arrange it to make this strip . 300730_302740
mhm . 302860_303000
and then if I recall you asked (th)em &-uh so what would happen if
mhm . 308880_309020
&-um so I I guess &-um could you kind of review what what
&-um well that's what they're gonna start paying attention to . 314740_316980
is they make this little &-um manipulative that looks like an
and think about . 322140_322510
oh do we just wanna copy the strip six times .
should we copy and then flip should we <copy flip flip> copy
what should we do . 329070_329820
what they'll be paying attention to is what happens when that one
what different shapes are created when the different colors meet or
&-um and I was asking that group in particular just to see if they
and they &-um they didn't you know they weren't able to just think
but then Katie goes . 356880_357540
well we could move these three over under and just repeat that part
and they started to see that just copying it didn't get them what
oh but if you flip it . 367150_367820
and they flipped (th)em over . 367840_368500
and they were much more pleased about the arrangement . 368520_370180
they came about from their strip design . 370200_372860
combined with a flip of their strip . 373840_375900
they liked what happened between those . 376110_377830
&-um . 378370_378470
I noticed that you asked him also you said from making that six
you said . 384300_384670
&-uh &-uh Teddy says that copying is not something that he wants to
what do you think . 388870_389380
mhm . 389400_389590
mhm and then they seem to think they seem to start to play around
I don't know if it was flips or turns or both . 394440_396180
mhm . 396200_396390
but yeah right away Sarah started &-um flipping 'cause she saw
and I liked that design . 401380_402150
and then she realized . 402260_403180
oh I don't wanna just do the same thing at all . 403200_405060
I wanna do it with the orange squares here . 405080_406660
and then up here and then down here . 406680_408030
&-um so most of them are looking for much more sophisticated
kind of range of thinking . 415640_416470
did you see . 416520_416940
like for example if we think about Brian how's Brian handling this
well the whole idea of a two-sided core square makes a lot more
he handled that that made sense to him this time . 425980_428380
as he was working with his group he knew what he was doing . 428940_432300
and for the quilt family booklet . 432460_434620
actually just physically making those two-sided core scores to help
mhm . 440940_441090
&-um being in a group of three is good for him in some ways . 441440_444750
'cause he has two people talking to him and planning with him . 445170_448620
&-um but in another way &-um Paul and Justin have gotten so into it
and they reach their hands out right away that Brian is kind of
it's not that they're not letting him participate . 458500_460300
but Paul and Justin are are you know twisting the papers out_of
they're thinking about Brian's just kind of watching . 464920_468340
but &-uh so so we'll see how that goes . 468620_471540
&-um and Alex is successfully making two-sided course squares which
and we went through nine tries I think for the fulfilling booklet .
so right now I see Alex like on schedule . 482280_486500
and that's good . 486580_487010
'cause he was several complete whole days behind everyone in that
so I want him and Kevin to just stay on schedule is is a big
so . 498620_498770
he seems to be using this knowledge at_least this time to . 498840_501950
yes . 502390_502440
be able to handle . 503480_503830
it's making sense because Kevin wasn't doing it for him . 504110_506710
he was doing it along with Kevin but understands this time <what
uhhuh . 511880_512080
I mean not just the the correct two sided course scores that
I think happened by luck . 517240_518190
uhhuh . 518580_518659
&-um in the first version it was just like . 518809_520020
oh that one's he . 520039_520940
didn't really understand that the other side was supposed to be
that it no not exactly and didn't understand why . 524390_526740
even once he got to the point . 527030_527830
oh yeah you want me to make right both sides identical .
didn't see <the purpose> the purpose of that . 529820_530990
what is that for . 531300_531980
um-huh and I think this time he understands a lot more what he's
today . 538080_538330
it was the first time for him to see the video today . 538400_540380
oh because he the first of our first three days of the qui unit . 540800_543270
Alex was absent two and a half . 543320_544740
oh so that that explains the length . 545190_547620
and I understood why this first project was was hard for him .
especially with all the things we know about how long it takes if
but I I see this as being &-um and when they chose cabin who
I'm pleased that so far they're on track Jill . 565300_567100
