this is the Harry <A> Blackmun Supreme Court , Oral History
it's being held on September <eighteen> , <nineteen
I'm a professor at Yale Law School and a former law clerk to
I'm the interviewer for these sessions .
<mister> Justice , when we finished up the last session ,
the case we were talking about is called Gilmore <v@l> Utah
what do you remember about that case ?
well , I remember some very distinct things about it .
it seemed to me the argument there swirled around the manner of

but his mother , whose name , I believe , was Betsy , wanted to
this was by shooting , as I recall .
I suppose the manner of execution by shooting is to have a squad up
that's about what I remember .
do you know why the case was not set for oral argument ?
do I know why ?
I think because the Court wanted to get rid of it , get it behind
do you think that this was the beginning of a trend toward more
yes , I think it was , which disturbed me at the time and still

I want to move back to a case that came up somewhat earlier , in
one of the first big abortion cases after Roe <v@l> Wade ,

well , it was a pretty strenuously argued case .

the Court was still pretty tense in this general area at the time ,
we went along with the thing .
when the case first came up , it came up on a stay motion from a
was he somebody that you were friendly with ?
oh , yes , I've known Judge Webster for a long time .
I think I first became acquainted with him when I was on the court
he was United States attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri
and then he was appointed district judge and elevated to the court
I don't believe that I ever sat with him on the court of appeals .
but a very able , attractive person of substantial ability .
you also noted in your file on the case that there was an amicus
who was <Doctor> Pratt ?
<doctor> Joseph Pratt was a member of the permanent staff
I knew him well personally .
ours was not a close friendship , but I certainly knew him .
I suspect he withdrew his name the second time around , in the
I've never asked him about this , but that's my guess .
would you recuse yourself from cases involving the Mayo Clinic ?
oh , yes .
yes , indeed , or Mayo Foundation .
any of the Mayo organizations .
you also noted that the first time the case came up , that it was

well , the conference asked me to prepare a per curiam and see if
I just obeyed instructions and put together a per curiam which was

I believe I wrote it .

that case involved the question whether the Fair Labor Standards

what's your recollection about this case ?
well , I was in the majority , and this is a case that was later
right .
which I wrote at the time .
the majority opinion in this case was written by Chief Justice
I went along with it , although I was troubled .
as I recall , I wrote separately , indicating my concern about it ,
this case was a waystop , and Garcia swept it out of the way .

he's been labeled as a conservative , of course , and I suppose
beyond that , I don't know where it came from ; it's just his
was the states' rights issue an issue that gained more prominence
yes , I would say it was .
we were fighting over it all the time .
and how did the votes tend to line up ?
well , nearly always , there was a trio , anyway .
there was changing personnel , of course ; I bring it down to date
but the chief and Justice Scalia and certainly Justice Thomas today
over on the other side are some , and then there are justices in
let me now turn to <O_T> <nineteen seventy-six> .
that's a long time ago .
October Term <nineteen seventy-six> , probably the most
what do you remember about that case ?
well , this case involved , and had to do primarily with , lawyer
it was a touchy issue at the time .
I think most lawyers divided themselves into two camps : those who
but when the case came down , I remember I had a long letter from
not one took the whole paper , but a lot of them took bits of it .
he thought it was outrageous , but there we were .
I think time has shown we can live with lawyer advertising and
the bar has to police itself .
I don't think that the citadel has fallen or the country has fallen
I don't like it very well , but on the other hand , I'd say that
I've heard this from members of the big firms , and I used to be a
well , sure , but they take prospective clients to such and such a
so it takes different forms .
how did lawyers respond to your decision ?
did you get much mail ?
no , not very much at all , as I recall .
maybe I shouldn't make that statement , because I haven't looked at
why do you think the chief was so concerned about these issues ?
well , I think Chief Justice Burger was concerned about the
when you were teenagers , who would you say was the more liberal or
oh , when we were teenagers , I think he prided himself on being
is that right ?
and felt he was .
looking back , he probably was .
do you remember any specific examples ?
oh , back in the presidential election of <nineteen something or
but he seems to have , over time , become much more concerned about
yes .
and propriety with regard to both lawyers and judges .
yes .
do you know where that came from , or that sense of it came from ?
no , I can't tell you where it came from .
he certainly felt that lawyers should behave themselves , should be
another case that came along during that term , October Term
one of your former clerks , now Judge Karen Nelson Moore , said
what can you tell us about that case ?
well , I don't know whether Judge Moore's comment is correct or not
complete Auto Transit was not a very controversial case , but ,
it perhaps is one of the foundation cases in the general area of

oftentimes they went along together and were intertwined .
but it was the best thing that ever happened to me .
I was pleased , in retrospect , at having had that experience .
I was not pleased the time when I was assigned to the tax

well , the professor's entitled to make his statements if he wants
I certainly had my share of tax cases , more than my share ,
I didn't feel that way because of my practice experience , and was
did the chief assign you more cases in tax than you would have
well , I think he assigned more than would normally have been the
in our preliminary discussions ; sometimes he'd ask if I would mind
sure , I was happy .
I didn't resent it at all ; I rather liked it , as a matter of fact
the next round of cases was actually something which was not a
complete Auto Transit was , I think , a unanimous decision .
it was , finally .
I think it was not at conference , but it was , finally .
okay .
I interrupted you .
no , no .
do you remember anything about how that came about ?
no , I do not .
the <nineteen seventy-six> term was also the term of the

well , I felt at the time , and still do , that the Court was
I felt they were giving lip service to a profound principle , but
why do you think that Justice Powell took this position , as
why do I think Justice Powell did what ?
justice Powell , who was the author of these three cases , why do
maybe we should ask Justice Powell .
how firm he was in joining Roe against Wade , I'm not sure .
he professes to stick with it .
wasn't it in this very case where he said , +"/.
+" we are not undermining Roe against Wade ?
right .
which I have used on a number of occasions .
it's a troublesome , very troublesome area , and I think he was
this is a case in which a lot of passion was shown not just by you
I'm wondering whether you and he had any discussions about the
no , we had no discussions , but I knew how he felt , and , of
he felt very strongly about this .
there was a letter that was later written by you found in the
unfortunately , yes .

it seemed to me that we were in a may I call it a period of
I was discouraged as to what the future held .
is that the first clear sign that you had that they were on a
yes , I would say so .
this also led several years down the road to a case we'll discuss
could you see those coming at this point in time ?
well , I sensed them , but I didn't make a point of it .
one can feel these issues coming down the road .
it's inevitable they're going to come .
this is also maybe the first case in which you really wrote a very
did you have any hesitation about being so blunt ?
you say , +"/.
+" the Court's result is tragic and punitive .
+" it's like saying , “Let them eat cake” .
did you have any concerns about offending any of the other justices
it was a little blunt .
no , I didn't have any concern about offending other justices .
if it hurt , they deserved it , I guess is my attitude .
when they would receive dissents like this , how would they respond
personally ?
yes .
just as though nothing had happened .
it is a little strange , perhaps .
we all are in the same building , at least at that time , and make
I think it displays a feeling on the part of the justices that they
we're going to have passionate differences of opinion , but that's
during your time on the Court , did anyone ever come to you to
no , nor did I go to any other chamber .
interesting .
I will admit , I think , and this is true of all of us , that maybe
did any justice ever come to you and say , +"/.
+" you really nailed me on this case ?
well , came close to it , yes , and then , of course , they'll
sometimes I wish the prior writings could have been published to
let me pick up on that point .
do you think that it's a good idea for justices' files to be made
well , of course , I think most of us feel the answer to that is in
justice Black felt very strongly about it and , in effect ,
one doesn't have to have his files open immediately upon his
one can arrange to have them opened five years after a designated
there's a lot of history in these files , I think a lot of
my files are complete .
I don't think we've destroyed anything .
I do have the problem of how long do I keep them confidential and
the Marshall situation , Justice Marshall , I think , came about by

I knew him fairly well , and I'm almost persuaded that he would not
of course , it's opened up a lot of comment for professors and
we're always well , it seems to me , even in The Legal Times ,
which means they're poring over those papers and trying to read
how do you think you came by your own decision to maintain such
oh , I think that's the way I'm made .
I don't like to throw things away .
I have to work at throwing things away .
I think there's a sense of the historical importance of some of
plus having a very good secretary who knows where everything is and
when did she join you , Wanda Martinson ?
well , it seems to me there's an anniversary this week .
oh , it's over twenty years , I think .
I can't tell you exactly the date , but she's been a jewel , as far
I can't get along without her .
how did you first meet her ?
she was recommended by my old secretary at Mayos , and apparently
she came down in a secondary capacity to start .
how old was she at the time ?
oh , I'm guessing .
it seems to me around <nineteen> or <twenty> .
we clerks used to say that you had violated the Mann Act by

<mister> Justice , November <nineteen seventy-six>
what are your recollections about Jimmy Carter ?
did you ever meet him ?
yes .
there are happy recollections .
I remember one dinner attended by Mister Carter , the
it's a pleasant memory .
I think he was sympathetic to the work of the Court and its aims
<Mrs> Blackmun thought he was great .
how do you think he has been as a former president ?
well , I'm pleased to have his presence around as a former
I think his comments now and then have been helpful .
he certainly is different from the average person formerly in that
as I said before , I'm pleased to have had him around .
he is one of the only presidents who did not get an appointment to
that's correct .
did you have any sense of who he might have appointed if he had
no , that would be pure speculation on my part .
the Court would have been changed , of course .
it always is .
you get a new person , and the dynamics change .
it's interesting to speculate .
I would like to have seen it .
one of his close friends was his attorney general , Griffin Bell .
the following term I'm jumping ahead a little bit but he
that was the only case that Griffin Bell argued as attorney general
do you remember anything about the argument or the case ?
indeed I do .
it is a custom , I think , for the attorney general to argue one
it concerned the snail darter , and the preservation of the species
so it was the snail darter against the establishment , so to speak
but Griffin Bell came in .
he's a good friend .
I've always admired him .
he came in .
of course , he has a very thick Georgia accent .
I could tell at the time he was waiting for someone to ask him what
well , five minutes went by , ten minutes went by , fifteen , and
finally , somebody did say , “What is a snail darter” ?
which was what he wanted , and he reached into his pocket and
+" this is a snail “dahtah” , .
and I don't know whether that added anything to the argument , but
it remained on the argument table for the rest of the presentation
did he pass it up to the bench ?
oh , yes , I think so .
we all looked at it with great interest and profound meditation .
you said he was a friend of yours .
how did you first come across him ?
oh , dear , I don't remember , really .
was it while he was a judge on the Fifth Circuit ?
no , I think it was before then .
yes .
was he ever mentioned as someone Carter might have appointed to the
yes , I think he would have been seriously considered .
his stature at the time made him deserving of consideration .
yes .
why do you think he picked that case to argue , of all the ones he
well , had I been he , I probably would have picked it , too .
here's a little snail darter against the entire world , all by
somebody had to protect it .
he did well .
it's one of those arguments I can well remember it stood out , I
going back to the <nineteen seventy-seven> term , another
this involved a Cleveland ordinance which prohibited a grandmother
justice Powell wrote a plurality opinion in which you joined ,
what do you remember about that case and how it came about ?
I don't remember the argument itself .
I remember the principles involved , the fact it was East Cleveland
I guess there's not much I can add in response to your question .
the plurality opinion has sometimes been cited as extending
is that something that was on your mind ?
yes , to a degree , and I was concerned about how the case would
we got rid of it , but it certainly had roots in Roe .
that's what this whole period was about , it seemed .
another way in which to extend it , I think , into some of your
you seem to have taken the side of the nontraditional family here .
was this something that you had experience with in your past ?
no , not really .
certainly not on the court of appeals .
but here was , for me , a comparatively new issue , and I think I
let me turn to a case that became famous for a footnote in <O_T>
it's a case called Castaneda <v@l> Partida , and it involved
what can you tell us about that case ?
well , that footnote achieved a little fame of its own .
it's a very mathematical footnote that most people don't understand
but I had a former law clerk named Meserve who had a lot to do with
did he have a scientific background ?
yes , he did .
I had enough of a mathematical background that I got through the
but I took a lot of kidding about it because of its arcane
it's a lot of fun .
a number of years ago , in the American Law Review , two authors ,
do you think that you had some greater faith in these methods
probably I was influenced by it .
I concentrated in mathematics when I was in college , took my

but I'm partial to mathematics .
I believe that statistics , if they're not manipulated , can lend a

but I won't hesitate to use statistics or things mathematical to
what do you think would have happened if you would have gone on in
what kind of career would you have pursued ?
oh , I'd probably be teaching a few courses at some little college
I would have been content , probably .
probably content .
I don't know .
my roommate did go on .
what was his name ?
his name was Frame , F-R-A-M-E , <J> <S> Frame .
he did go on into graduate school in mathematics , distinguished
I felt I was getting out of my depth in mathematics , but he used
did you ever envy the academic lifestyle ?
no , not particularly .
I think “envy” is the wrong word .
there's a lot to be said for it , but I got myself into a more
<mister> Justice , at this point , <nineteen seventy-seven>
one of the things that had been said about you when you were
do you think that you were breaking rules , or unwritten rules ,
what was going on in your mind as you did these things ?
oh , I didn't feel I was breaking any rules .
I was calling the shots as I saw them .
I felt comfortable in those statistical comments .
I felt comfortable in footnote <twelve> in that one case .
why not ?
one can be too tradition-bound , I think .
with this special background , I might as well use it , and I did
well , if you're deviating from these traditions , this means , I
do you think that other things were pushing you to be less
the latter , I think .
there was no intention to break out of any mold , as such .
but I was more comfortable expressing my own views and being my own
let me go on to the next term , which was <O_T> <nineteen
also along time ago .
okay .
the blockbuster case of this term was The Regents of the University
yes .
and that created the current solution , or judicial approach , to
what are your recollections about that case ?
well , the case , we knew it was important , and rather anticipated

correspondence came in and circulations came in , but I wasn't able
the result was that my writing in Bakke was one of the last to
I think every justice wrote in Bakke .
I may be wrong about that , but I think everyone did .
I was criticized a little bit by one or two of my colleagues for
this irritated me , because I felt that being under surgical

oh , one always wonders .
there's always a risk in surgery .
even with minor surgery , sometimes patients expire .
I wasn't concerned .
I felt sure I'd get back all right , but I knew I would be out of

yes , indeed , because some of the circulations came out , and I
there was never any doubt , any real doubt , about that , the
