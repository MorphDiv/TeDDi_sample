uhh right now, on gambit . 6716_9317
okay . 9317_10448
I have &=sigh uh a partially populated database . 10448_15716
well, I can show you the +... 15716_18045
Wow . 18045_20812
Nice, you know what, this is . 20812_23579
Exac(tly) . 23579_24361
this is, put it this way I like this much better just just visual
this is this is really nice . 30471_31503
This is uhhhh I mean just in terms of just a nice look a feel this
yeah . 37158_37780
That's gonna hafta change . 37780_38727
the Lt doesn't think it's professional enough looking, but you know
what, what, what has to change ? 41123_42731
uh, the, the what's in the white spot, the actual content . 42731_46074
Oh, okay . 46074_47355
I agree with that and n' part of the thing to be honest with this
mmhmm . 55324_56105
uh with a style sheet and change this so it looks a little more
'cause right now it's gray, too, and grayed out usually means not
yeah . 61500_62000
So if you made this something .
And what I'ld consider is I'ld consider just using regular blue . 63633_70067
Like try to match this blue here . 70067_73500
You know just like take use the eyedropper tool find out what that
mmhmm . 78596_79400
And then set in your style sheet set this to be the same color blue
And get rid of this underlining because it does look
I and its +... 86093_91000
Sometimes what's nice is if you can set the style sheet so that
right . 99000_99706
I know how to do that .
it's just . 99706_102000
But when it looks like this it &=cough . 100000_103000
But, but I think this is I think this is a big improvement over
okay, what about the database . 109000_110486
okay, so, here basically is the database . 110486_113996
um, it's already there, on gambit . 113996_118992
I have everything except for knowledge populated . 118992_122169
Because knowledge is going to be a pain . 122169_125513
Oh, so you already populated this in the s +... 125513_126833
Yes . 126833_127659
okay . 127659_128030
This, what's posted here some of the pages that actually use the
the website actually use(s) the calender and article tables .
okay . 136300_137289
Um yeah . 137289_139758
Also in that packet is the structure for the site and such . 139758_146201
okay, the okay I got it .
first I was thinging vab but I see visitor, &~a applicant,
mmhmm . 153500_154771
okay interesting way of doing permissions . 154771_158943
Do you have a better idea ?
(be)cause I didn't really know how how to do that . 158943_162900
uummm, you will, a lot of times usually permissions .
this is, I mean, this is one way of doing it .
you know the interesting thing about doing this is um the way I
Um and if you use one, two, and four as the numbers .
so, um, a one means only visitors can do it .
Two means only applicants can get it .
a four means only battalion .
Six two and four means applicant and battalion . 176941_198400
Five is the the visitor and battalion . 198400_204000
visitor and applicant ? 201000_203000
See what I'm saying .
if you use one, if you use one, two, th , if you use one, two, four
That would be seven ? 205000_206500
mmhmm . 208900_209500
That would probably be easier to deal with in the code . 212000_216000
Right and so, well, tha, well, &~tha that that's how permissions are
mmhmm . 219149_220145
Um, Although you can also set them .
you know, they also, you know the uh r uh r@l w@l x@l but +... 220145_231000
but that ends up being numbers, too, right ? 230145_232785
Right, it, it, really it gets converted into numbers I mean, to
but it's really uh one, two four . 232000_240300
Because the thing is, you know, seven means everybody has access to
and so anyways, this is work this would work .
you know and &~thi this is fine, but I mean (..) anyways (..) I'm
dont that's um the way to do it .
but if this works then you can do this .
but I'm just telling you that's the way it's often done . 263074_269000
I haven't started using it yet, so, using the permissions yet . 269000_271500
okay, well . 271500_273000
I just displayed all articles for everyone at the moment . 273000_275500
okay, that's fine, well you can think about that, that unix
Um, you know, trying to like &~fi you know, so um . 286698_293501
(...) and 'cause you can set the permission level for and what, um
(..) k (..) Can I ask a question about scholarship ? 305535_313769
Sure . 313671_314309
(...) Scholarship is (...) is the list of all the .
is a list of the different scholarships you can get ? 314309_325608
But I thought .
isn't there .
okay I I guess just I dunno .
How many scholarships are there ?
I thought there's just like &~o . 325608_332300
There's, like, seven ? 332300_334000
Seven different kind of scholarships . 334000_335500
I think so ?
Yeah . 334639_335708
really ? 335708_336800
mmhmm . 336800_337500
okay, like some partial support, some full support, or different
Things like that . 341700_343282
okay, 'cause see I just know ROTC scholarships, so I just
I didn't even know there were that many until I went and lookayed
okay, that's fine .
I I just, I just thought well if there's one scholarship, why
it's just .
no, no, I'm just just, yeah I just didn't know .
it's my own ignorance, so um . 350000_363500
enh, 'cause people who come into ROTC don't have scholarships in
a lot of them, so that's +... 363500_371300
Um can I ask a question on class . 371300_373344
uh huh . 373344_373790
tbl class, class id, you said usually three two one oh one is
They're like classes through the university .
so I'm using the class id that the university uses . 389000_396044
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay . 391044_395044
okay, I understand that right now, okay . 395800_399000
But I can't &=laugh . 399000_405000
I was thinking, I was I was thinking about class like, like the
So where are you going to use this, so where's this class table,
Um, it's a display of the classes that we take .
currently, it's changing .
like the command, or CNET, actually, or NETC, or whatever
So that will have to be able to be changed by the administrator for
okay right right . 418130_431408
okay .
that's fine .
but that shouldn't too hard to do that .
okay, um . 431408_437400
Staff turns over a lot, so that's gonna have to be really easy to
knowledge changes because, uh, part of knowledge is knowing your
mmhmm mmhmm . 438785_444998
(..) I'm scholarships +/. 448785_453000
okay °okay knowledge° . 452000_456230
mmhmm . 455000_456000
what kind of stuff's going in knowledge ? 456500_458000
Drill Knowledge .
it's a whole smorgasbord of stuff so I have to leave it really open
okay, (be)cause I see a drill title and a drill text . 464125_468000
Yeah . 468000_469102
Do &~y is does &=sigh I guess what I'm wondering about is what about
I mean, do I have to keep reentering, let's say I use the same
It should always be there . 486607_488764
I don't want it to never ever dissappear . 488764_491098
I want the amount of drill knowledge on this site to be as much as
changing a thing here or there, maybe, but since most knowledge
oh oh, okay . 491098_497000
okay, although you can edit it, right ? 504426_507000
mmhmm, I should be able to edit it because I will have to change
Well, what would happen if something he want you wanted to take
Would it cause any problems to to delete it .
would you wanna delete it or do wanna still have it active deactive
I s'pose hm . 524000_526500
I mean, you might wanna think about what on the off chance that I
Let's say a controversy occurs I wanna just take something off real
I mean, you could always delete it, but then, you know, it might be
You know, field active .
it's just some +/. 542958_546435
You think I should do that for the rest of them as well ?
or just that . 545435_548384
Well, kuh article is the other one I was gonna talk about is should
You might want to save articles, you know save past articles, or
It's basically boolean, the same kind of thing .
display it, don't display it . 571900_575911
You could also go to point of if somebody want(ed) to say don't
mmhmm . 584298_586295
Where, what it'll do is it'll find the articles based on the start
Make sense ? 595000_595826
(..) Yeah, I was gonna do it by the timestamp and then I realized
The timestamp is when they put it in, the article in right ? 599541_602059
Right . 602059_602802
Right . 602802_603452
