Er ah I did some at home but we have n't done any booklet work this
You have n't done any booklet work Okay . 1041914_1043064
Because we 've been doing Pythagoras theorem . 1043064_1044084
Oh have you . 1044084_1045434
Yeah I 'll just show you what we 've been doing . 1045434_1047084
Yeah Show us what you 've been doing You understand it . 1047184_1049434
Yeah well sort of We 're erm that 's the booklet I 'm on at the
What 's this one I have n't seen this one Oh . 1055394_1063254
It 's it 's er . 1063254_1067234
0 .
Yeah Did that yu yesterday Not all that . 1067244_1083504
Is that from here . 1083664_1085484
Yeah . 1085484_1085594
Yeah . 1085594_1085944
Work from that And an an the the sheets And now I 've just started
Right . 1099854_1100244
Okay . 1100244_1100344
Yeah So do you wan na finish that now . 1101464_1103864
Yeah please . 1103864_1104284
Right okay . 1104414_1104964
I I knew that erm I uns I sa understand some of it but some of it I
Yes but the thing is this in a right angle triangle . 1123664_1126374
Mm . 1126374_1126614
the longest side is called what Cos it . 1126614_1129524
The hypotenuse . 1129524_1130664
The hypotenuse right So the longer side is always the hypotenuse .
Yeah . 1133564_1133654
Right Now what is the formula for your Pythagoras theorem . 1133654_1139204
The sum of the erm I do I do n't I know my dad 's taught me a
Right The square on the hypotenuse . 1173319_1176519
Yeah . 1176519_1176689
equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides . 1176689_1181189
Yeah . 1181189_1181419
The square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares on the
Okay . 1188189_1188409
Alright . 1188409_1188789
Yeah . 1189739_1189929
And the squ hypotenuse is always the longest side It 's the side
Mhm . 1198669_1198939
So there 's your right angle that is the hypotenuse and the square
Okay . 1213589_1214039
Alright The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the
Mm . 1232829_1233279
is thirty six so what 's the length of that side . 1233989_1237589
Erm that must be nine . 1237589_1243769
No . 1246079_1246529
Sorry Aha What then . 1246799_1249039
The square root of thirty six What two numbers amount to . 1249039_1252459
Six . 1252459_1252579
That 's right So the that side must be six centimetres . 1252749_1255529
Yeah . 1255529_1255999
The square is six times six which is thirty six That is four square
Mm . 1261449_1262059
It 's four centimetres and the square is sixteen so what must be
Twenty . 1269409_1269699
Twenty Right So you 've got to find what number multiplied together
Mm . 1276549_1276969
So it 's going to the length of that side is going to be the . 1278079_1282749
So you square the root of twenty Find the square root of twenty do
You find the square root of twenty That 's right And how do you
Just use that . 1290779_1292239
You 'll use that yes . 1292239_1293949
Mm mm . 1293949_1294209
Are n't you lucky . 1294469_1295129
Mm . 1295129_1295479
Because I we never had sa we never had erm calculators . 1295629_1298729
Wha what did you have to do then . 1299309_1301099
So you had to find the square root of by ar either arithmetic by .
Mm . 1307259_1307349
doing in an arithmetic way or you had to use a sca a log table You
It 's got on the back actually Back of this book . 1339279_1342869
Square roots twe . 1342869_1343819
Oh yeah . 1348349_1349159
square root is twenty and it 's four point four seven two one . 1349159_1355049
Yeah square root . 1355749_1356909
That 's right But as you say you can use this . 1356919_1363019
0 .
Which one do you push now . 1363019_1364829
That one . 1364919_1366849
That 's right Four point four seven two . 1366859_1370239
Yeah . 1370359_1370669
So you know that 's well the way you do it So th that 's how you
I 've done these . 1376989_1378199
You 've done those have you . 1378209_1379469
Yeah look Here are . 1380009_1380579
Well let's see that you got them right shall we . 1380619_1382559
Six five A . 1382559_1383029
So this one you 've got twenty five equals nine plus some number
Mhm . 1394309_1394539
So that is going to be sixteen is n't it . 1396769_1399529
Yeah . 1399979_1400179
No it is n't . 1401909_1402379
Yes it is . 1402589_1402879
Yes it is sixteen So what 's that gon na be . 1402879_1404889
Sixteen to erm square root of sixteen . 1405799_1409189
Sixteen . 1409859_1410199
is four . 1410199_1410659
Four So that 's . 1410659_1411369
0 .
gon na be four So C five A have you got four . 1411369_1413409
Yeah . 1413739_1413819
Yes you have Right Now B again that the square root of that is
Mm . 1425929_1426099
Or rather sixty four e eighty one equals sixty four plus some
Gives you six which is erm seventeen so it 's . 1440289_1446249
Gives you . 1446249_1446749
er seventeen . 1447189_1447759
Gives you seventeen So now for the answer to that one . 1447839_1450439
The square root of seventeen . 1450439_1451199
you want the square root of seventeen which is four point one two
Mm . 1458099_1458159
So C again you 've got eleven elevens what are eleven elevens . 1458489_1465859
Er a hundred and twenty one . 1465859_1468209
A hundred and twenty one equals thirty six plus some number . 1468329_1472499
Mm . 1473269_1473459
So what is a hundred and twenty one less thirty six . 1473539_1476879
Erm er is it six erm erm si . 1478799_1485209
Eighty five . 1485899_1486559
eighty five sorry . 1486559_1487429
Have you got eighty five The square root of eighty five Yes you
Mhm . 1501879_1502059
twenty five plus some number so what 's that Thirty nine . 1502059_1507959
Yeah . 1508069_1508279
The square root of thirty nine which is obviously reasonable so
Mm . 1515069_1515129
C six And you ca n't do C six . 1515129_1516669
So that those are alright . 1516819_1517229
Yes you can mar well yes you can do . 1517709_1519249
They 're wrong are n't they I 'll mark them right . 1520839_1524619
Why do n't you tick it neatly . 1525549_1526729
I do . 1526729_1527419
As I 've said before You do n't . 1527419_1528679
Okay then . 1528769_1529069
No it 's alright Leave . 1529069_1530029
Yeah . 1530029_1530089
it now but erm . 1530089_1530789
Oh that 's alright . 1530789_1531129
that 's you know you should erm Okay So you 're going to do C six I
Okay . 1549079_1549169
Cos I . 1549979_1550899
Is that the hypotenuse Yes . 1558109_1563119
Which is the hypotenuse . 1563119_1565039
That one . 1565399_1565979
Which one . 1566329_1566649
The opposite one to the right angle . 1566829_1568009
Right . 1568349_1568619
So it 's that one . 1569359_1569949
Right . 1570329_1570589
So so it must be it is erm can I write it down on here . 1572749_1591949
I 'll tell you what write it down on paper and then you can copy it
Hang on a sec Five point three nine . 1600389_1654649
Right I 'll settle for that . 1654989_1656549
Is that right the way I 've done it By the way I I did that so I
Well I mean you 've got the right answer so erm . 1665099_1669799
Shall I just write shall I copy it in . 1670569_1672689
Yes what have you done . 1674579_1675329
Erm five equals twenty five mm . 1677059_1685119
Five does n't equal twenty five . 1685449_1687829
Five fives are twenty five . 1687859_1688799
You have n't got five times you 've got five equals twenty five
That 's what I 've been doing I meant I mean that . 1694999_1697539
Yahhh But if you write that look Five equals twenty five is not
Okay then . 1710069_1710589
Right . 1710729_1711079
Yeah . 1711079_1711139
Be very precise But you should n't ever write five equals twenty
Okay then . 1716089_1716529
You mean five squared you mean five times five equals twenty five
Okay That is the hypotenuse is n't it That there . 1740129_1778569
Yes Mhm . 1778569_1779409
C Do you do ninety nine take twenty five . 1782079_1814069
Which one are we doing . 1816459_1817199
B Erm I 'm gon na do . 1817499_1819589
What have you got . 1819589_1820159
Er . 1821109_1821149
You 've got you 've got nine nines are eighty one nine squared
Ah so . 1825029_1825059
what . 1825149_1825749
Eighty one equals nine . 1827099_1828599
Ah pa cha cha cha cha cha Right Five squared equals twenty five
Nine into ninety erm eight in eighty one take twenty five . 1834749_1838989
That 's right . 1839099_1839529
So erm that 'll be se fifty five fifty fifty six . 1840749_1859449
Right . 1860119_1860479
So then you square root it . 1862399_1863559
That 's right . 1863599_1864009
Seven point four eight . 1880439_1881499
Right . 1885349_1885629
Is it a hundred take nine . 1894819_1924309
That 's right . 1926179_1926729
