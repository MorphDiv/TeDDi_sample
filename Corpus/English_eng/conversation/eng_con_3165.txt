how long the um how long you gotta +...
count how the thing is whatever your measuring .
how do you do that ?
brittany says that when you're measuring +...
nathan, please move away from there .
brittany says when you're measuring +...
you're finding, your counting how long something is .
how do I do that ?
how do I count how long something is ?
like this ?
if I'm gonna find out how long the bookshelf is, is this how I do
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven .
it's seven !
no .
all right so then you have to tell me what .
see you know a lot, .
but you haven't put into words yet .
what would I do to measure the bookshelf ?
you could use a ruler .
without a ruler .
uhh one two three four five .
was that measuring ?
big little mm, no +...
big short .
well, I wasn't trying to do the same thing you did, .
and I didn't do thing you did .
no because you did long .
when she went like this +...
and then she went short like that .
but that's not really measuring because .
you measuring long and short .
you're supposed to measure just one long .
or just one short .
I measured just one long and one short ?
that's not exactly what I did .
no, Justin is telling me what he meant .
so Justin, the part of what I did that bothered you .
wasn't that I used my feet, .
and it wasn't that I counted, .
it's that I went long short long short ?
you were you were like this you went .
one, and then you went two .
you went one, then well I guess you went .
one, two, three and then four .
but you were like this .
and then you went like this, smaller, see ?
but since I measured long steps and small steps .
I shouldn't do that when I'm measuring ?
its not really measuring .
why it sounds like we're almost +...
measuring is even ?
tell me about that Jillian .
what's even when I'm measuring ?
you're right, that's what bothers Justin .
were the steps I took even ?
no, no, cuz you just +...
I took a big step, then I took a little step .
then I took a big step, then I took a little step, .
but I made a pattern, I did the same thing .
again and again .
xxx .
they weren't equal .
no, they weren't .
you're right, .
I took a big step, and a little step, .
and a big step and a little step .
like inches You but +...
they're all the same um size .
inches are all the same size ?
yeah .
huh .
like if because if one was like this skinny, .
then one was this big, .
you couldn't, you wouldn't know how big it was .
um well then just let me try one more thing .
watch me again um +...
all right, I'm going to start here .
one two three four five six, seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
measuring !
all little steps .
what ?
you took all little steps .
measuring measuring !
was that measuring ?
yes .
why was that measuring ?
because uh, they were all even .
both of your feet are equal .
they're they're the same size +...
for, for going like this .
so if you go like this you're, you're .
you keep on doing the same size over and over .
you don't it's not like you have one foot this big .
and one foot that big .
so is that what measuring is ?
you keep on doing the same size over and over ?
yeah .
you just a second +...
I need to write it down or I'll forget .
you keep on doing the same size, .
so we're saying whatever, whatever it is, .
the same size over and over .
so is it important when you're measure .
that the things you're measuring with .
have to be even or equal and all the same size ?
no, I don't think so .
oh, I can measure with two things that aren't the same size ?
yeah no .
like my feet are, my feet, .
my shoes are going to be a lot bigger .
okay I'm going to do something different .
I'm not going to use my feet .
I'm going to use something .
that I know is all the same size .
I'm going to use these science books, okay ?
cases !
no I just said science books .
using bookcases .
but they're not all the same size .
every one of these science books is the same size .
they have many different, .
they have different sizes, spaces !
this is not measuring because .
like first this part of it gets smaller and smaller .
then they're then they're touching each other .
then they're apart again .
you won't be equal !
those science books are all the same size .
yeah but +...
now what I'm going to do is +...
I'm going to use numbers or counting, .
and I'm going to keep really careful track of my numbers .
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven .
this book shelf is eleven science books long .
but no, no because you've got spaces in there .
you have to do all, you put different amount of spaces .
you see all these spaces, they haven't +...
shh don't touch that, don't touch that !
why ?
that's the recorder .
you can't do that because +...
you would like to have it like about .
as big as a science book .
in between both of them .
because or, or you have to have them touching .
you have to have like them touching or have +...
umm a space as big as one of the things .
that you're measuring with .
ah Nathan's saying he can think of two ways, .
he could use these science books +...
oh no, right now Saad and Brian .
to measure this bookshelf .
because I what I want is I want to know how many .
science books long both these bookshelves together are .
okay Saad and Brian, how would you solve that problem ?
you have to tell us how many science books long .
the two bookshelves are .
what do you think you should do ?
the science books are there on the floor, .
use them any way you want what, but we want to know +...
how I told them the books shelves are .
eleven science books long, and they said no way .
so, okay .
Okay one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven .
hmm so you think it's accurate to say +...
that the two books shelves are eleven science books long ?
it is not !
they just talked themselves out of that idea .
saad, what you think ?
is it okay for Brian to say the two books shelves .
are eleven science books long ?
no .
what would you do ?
do you think we could use science books .
to measure the bookshelf ?
um yeah .
saad and Brian, do you think so guys ?
yeah .
yeah ?
what are you going to need to .
do with those science books ?
umm just count them ?
well you already tried that .
you just counted them and the group said no .
because didn't you count them and say oh, yup eleven ?
+" The two book shelves are eleven science books long .
are the two book shelves eleven science books long ?
yes Yeah .
I thought you told me they weren't Saad .
that's accurate, it's fair to say, it's true to say .
the two book shelves are eleven science books long .
hmm .
you think that best the way to measure the .
bookshelf is to push the books together ?
yeah because +...
okay will you take a step back and let Brian and .
Saad try that .
okay Brian and Saad see what happens .
teddy, you need to move honey, come around .
everyone is standing !
yeah guys you need to, we'll let you stand .
up and look what they did after they do it .
what they're trying is to ah +...
nathan suggested to them that maybe the only way .
it would work is if they pushed them all .
right next to each other .
will there be enough though ?
well, what, what, how are we going to handle that ?
oh, something that I didn't mention +...
brian and Saad are noticing that .
there are not enough science books .
it's because +...
to reach the end of the second book shelf .
if, we, we ahm .
saad, what did you find out when you tested .
a Garden Gates book against a science book ?
well, it wasn't the same size .
it wasn't the same size .
so could they finish the rest of the way to .
the end of the book case with these books ?
nope .
they could, they could but they would need more .
saad and Brian tested a Garden Gates book up next .
umm to a science book and they found out that .
they're not the same size books .
so could they finish out the rest of the way to the end of the
no .
it's just that Brian and Saad are almost ready .
okay look at what Brian and Saad did .
at the beginning of the book shelf there .
maybe if they tried something like this, .
they might be able to get to the end of the book shelves .
no, nope .
yeah, still we +...
even if you had enough, would that be a good idea ?
no .
why ?
because measuring +...
because even, even +...
yeah both, both of the books aren't even .
one time it's real small, one time it's real big .
yeah !
and you could not be sure if +...
okay who has another suggestion for them ?
make a decision thinking about .
whether it would work or not .
ashley what do you suggest ?
well there's eleven and you would have to keep eleven .
and then, from the end of the books uhm +...
stack them all the way over to the end, .
and then keep good track of the record, .
and then count how many are over there .
do you see what Ashley is saying ?
you know that you've used eleven so far, right ?
and that book, where that book ends, .
that's the end of eleven books .
so you have to keep track of that in your mind .
you have to go to the end down there, .
and get some of the books from the beginning, .
and carry them up here to finish out and .
keep counting how many more it would be .
because you know this is eleven .
there you go +...
we would, we may not +...
well, we're going to find out, they went to get .
some more .
so what have you got now Brian ?
thirteen fourteen more .
okay .
I think they need fifteen .
okay slide it in there and take a look .
well how does it look ?
well there's a little space still .
hmm what do we do about that ?
ahh umm +...
no, that won't work .
xxx inch xxx .
no, that won't work .
xxx .
well, we're not thinking inches .
my, our problem was, .
how many science books long is the book shelf ?
fifteen .
fifteen .
and that much +...
fifteen science books and that much ?
and a quarter or inch or +...
well, what are we measuring in ?
we're measuring in science books .
science books .
so can we say fifteen science books and an inch ?
no, well, we could quarter +...
fifteen science books and a quarter of a science book ?
shh, shh well we had enough .
we thought fifteen science books, .
and you recognize there is some space left over .
can we forget that space left over ?
no .
no, and what a lot of you told me is, .
first you said +"/.
+" oh it's about an inch .
and I said +"/.
+" well we're measuring in science books .
and you said +"/.
+" well it's about and several you said .
+" it's about a quarter of a science book .
if we took more time, could we figure out .
what part of a science book it was ?
uh yeah .
okay, but +...
was that Brian and Saad with help from .
nathan and Ashley and others, .
was what they did finally measuring ?
yes .
no .
and what made it measuring ?
what made what they did .
with the science books measuring ?
careful of the cord now .
just a second .
what made what they did measuring ?
because you're all again +"/.
+" that was measuring .
how come when I laid the science books down, .
it was not measuring ?
because you +...
xxx spaces xxx +...
so, Is it a rule for measuring that you can't .
leave spaces between ?
yes .
you can .
you can ?
yes .
hmm, umm tomorrow we're going to explore .
measurement umm some more, .
with some other things .
I think you guys did a good job figuring out .
some of what it is you know about measuring .
you guys know that measuring uses number or counting .
you know that you have to keep careful .
track of those numbers .
you know that the things you're measuring with .
have to be equal, or have to be the same size .
could I have used, you told me I couldn't measure .
with science books and reading books .
if they weren't the same size .
see you knew that .
you knew that you kept on doing the same size .
over and over and over again to measure .
and you guys knew right away when I laid .
those science books down uhuh, uhuh, .
that you couldn't leave spaces in between .
so there are things about measuring that you know .
you just never had to tell anyone .
what it was you knew before .
it's time to dress for recess .
well that was quite a +...
that was interesting wasn't it ?
yeah .
and we didn't get to anything that we were going to do .
but that was okay .
part of me knew today might be all talk .
and tomorrow might be the activity I have ah in mind .
but I didn't know how long it was going to take me .
to get them away from .
inches, yards, rulers, yardsticks .
uhhuh .
umm that kind of thing .
and I knew that until I did that, .
we weren't going anywhere because um +...
and I had no idea measurement's such a broad topic .
that I had no idea how at the beginning, .
how long they would spend coming up with .
different kinds of measure or .
how much terminology they were getting and stuff .
I mean that could have went a whole bunch of ways, .
because even though we've done some measurement .
this year and we've done some webbing that .
included talking about measurement, .
we haven't really talked about that specifically yet, .
and we're going to get into that now, .
all those different kinds, .
but this will be valuable because, .
two months from now when I say what's measurement .
and how do you measure, their ideas will be .
completely and totally different and on their own, .
they will distinguish between different .
kinds of measurement .
you know they will, they will say well +...
measurement is lots of things .
if you're measuring how much space .
something takes up, that's one thing .
if you're just measuring how long it is, or, .
there's difference between how much something .
will hold and how high it is, or, .
the measurement around something is .
different than the measurement of how much space .
that thing takes up .
and then, measuring time is different than .
measuring with a ruler umm +...
uhhuh .
so they actually once they started cooking though .
they had really good ideas .
but I didn't want me to be the one who said .
so does everything you measure with .
have to be the same size .
I wanted them to come out, .
and you know Julian was saying .
+" no they have to be even and you know, why ?
why was that important for them to come up with it ?
well because otherwise I'm just telling them something .
and that's how they've learned the things about .
measurement they know so far .
somebody just told them .
you know they know the right words to say, .
and they know yeah you take this thing, .
and you stick it up against something, .
and you measured .
that's really the total limit .
of what they know in terms of that .
when it comes to using those, .
tools that's what they know .
you take this thing you stick it up .
against something and that's the measurement .
but they don't know what that means .
but really see they do know a lot of that .
uhhuh .
but it took all that talking and thinking .
and prodding and forcing them .
to tell me what it was that they knew .
before they realized oh my gosh, .
you know there are rules for measuring, .
not just you start the ruler at the beginning of the thing .
or of instead at the number one, .
or the rule for well if something's hanging over, .
you still need to measure it, .
it's part of it like you know half inch .
not those things not that kind of conventional kind .
of rules, the whole basis for what measurement is .
and they really do know and understand a lot of that .
but on one has ever asked them to talk about that, .
and they're not linking those ideas at all .
to what they're doing with that stick .
