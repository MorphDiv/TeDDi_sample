one day a boy caught a frog .
he slept in a jar .
when he went to bed that night the frog got away .
and the next morning he was gone .
they looked everywhere in his room .
in his boots in the jar all of his room .

and the dog fell out the window with the pot still on his head .
it cracked but he was all right .
