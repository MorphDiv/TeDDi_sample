ugh I hate this board .
well it's (be)cause somebody pulled it all the way down and it says not to .
yeah .
turkeys .
&=laughs .
turkeys .
&=laughs .
is this all we get three pages ?
there's more coming .
I don't think we'll be doing it for three hours though .
&-um which is &~v tentative well let's say I predict that we'll be outta before &-uh one o'clock .
which is fine (be)cause I gotta take somebody to get a root canal anyway .
ouch +/.
+, and I should probably get ready for that ordeal .
I hate that .
did I tell you I &~g I took in a cat a stray cat ?
did I tell you this story ?
no &=laughs .
&-um well you know it's not really a story worth telling until this thing that happened yesterday .
I'm not supposed to have pets in my house &-um so I I kept worrying about the landlord coming by .
and you know the landlord doesn't sneak on over and and try to catch you at things so I thought I'd be fine .
but he left a message yesterday morning around ten saying that he would be coming over to show my my place to some people who wanna rent it for next year .
and if I had picked it up if I had picked up the phone then &-uh I woulda been alright but I I was sleeping in so I didn't get the message until later when I woke up about quarter to eleven .
and I had fifteen minutes to get this place cleared of any cat residence &-uh &=laughs:multiple evidence .
so you know I like I took the kitty kitty +//.
&-uh what is that ?
the kitty litter stuff and I stuck it in my trunk in the trunk of my car <you don't wanna> you don't wanna know what it smelled like a little bit later ⌈ &-uh and I ⌉ +/.
⌊ oh ⌋ +/.
+, usher the cat out the door you know and I thought oh I'll never see that cat again you know cats come they eat your food and then they leave and you know they don't &~s stay up nights thinking about you or anything .
so I was like alright there goes the cat oh well .
and &-uh you_know I I put it out in the little shed and I closed the door and I when I came back later it was gone .
so I figured ah off it went .
people come over .
my landlord comes over they see the place .
&-um you know I go out and do some errands and I come back about two hours later .
I go to the shed and I am thinking I'm gonna go outside and maybe look for the cat and see if he's still around .
and the cat is in the corner of the shed and it hasn't moved a muscle .
&=laughs you know it's just it's sitting there on top of some clay that I have in that shed .
and I thought this was so great you know it's &~li I felt like this cat approved of me &=laughs:multiple it accepted me .
and it immediately reminded me of and I and and lemme tell you I don't normally have these kind of &-uh Bible school Christian moments but you know &~th there's that thing in &-um in +//.
at church you know they they teach you about the figure of Christ knocking on the door ?
you know and you're supposed to open up your life to him .
I felt exactly like that .
I was like this cat has accepted me .
&=laughs:multiple you know ?
and I told my girlfriend all about it and we had like a a a moment of being affirmed in our relationship thanks to this cat .
+, ⌈ wow ⌉ .
+, ⌊ it was ⌋ nice .
yeah .
so the cat's around .
we can't take her to Miami but &-uh we'll give her to some people to take care of her .
hm .
yeah +/.
+, hm .
despite my not giving it any shots .
or &-um getting it declawed or any of these things .
which I kinda don't believe in .
you know .
the shots you don't believe in ?
I don't believe in the shots .
you know ?
I I I ⌈ don't like I don't like +//.
I haven't named the cat either (be)cause I don't agree with that ⌉ .
⌊ shots are a good thing ⌋ .
⌈ for cats especially ⌉ .
⌊ if you ever watch Emergency ⌋ Vets they're like did you inoculate your animal ?
and they're like no and they're like well he's gonna die .
oh yeah ?
⌈ oh ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ there's a_lot_o(f) diseases that they can't cure they only can prevent with ⌈ inoculation ⌉ .
⌊ well you know ⌋ that's that's a cat's life .
&=laughs:multiple I ⌈ feel like ⌉ .
⌊ that's horrible ⌋ .
&=laughs ⌈ <what about when> ⌉ you get a +/.
⌊ well you know ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ disease from your ⌉ cat ?
if it's a matter of my getting the disease then I'll get it all the shots that it needs &=laughs:S4 but I don't know .
I feel like I'm humanizing the cat or something and making it go to the doctor and getting its stuff cut off and getting its fingernails all pulled out I I don't really like that .
&=laughs:S3 you know ?
I don't know .
that's probably faulty reasoning somewhere but &-um we'll let these people who are recording me figure that out .
&=laughs:multiple &-um okay &~i take out a piece of paper and take some random notes .
okay ?
random +/.
+, yeah this is to prevent stupid mistakes that you've been making throughout &-uh the semester from occurring through this ⌊ last paper ⌋ .
⌈ &-um ⌉ I don't have a writing utensil again .
oh: .
<you can have ink> .
did you not buy a pen for <the semester> xxx .
&=laughs no &=laughs:multiple .
&-uh I'll probably repeat this later when more people show up .
&-um but write this down for your sake while it's still fresh on my mind .
&-uh comma splices what are those ?
do you know ?
well you don't &~l have to know what they're called I guess but it's a run+on sentence .
right ?
two sentences joined by a comma .
&-uh they should be separated into two separate sentences or you should do some sort of punctuation fix &-um semicolon dash maybe even a colon okay ?
Leslie you are a big+time violater of the comma splice rule and so is Erica <who's not here> .
I thought I did better this time .
&=laughs I still caught some right ?
you you got rid of the &-uh the incomplete sentences &=laughs:multiple but you're still having trouble &=laughs at the other end .
thank you very much Simon for announcing my &-uh problem in class .
yeah I can read you some examples .
no that's alright I'll read ⌊ xxx ⌋ &=laughs .
⌈ &-um ⌉ yeah &~y you make these kind of mistakes because you get away with them in spoken speech spoken language but &~i in written language it's really visible and &-um well the the grader will wonder about the rest of your paper if you don't know the difference between a complete sentence and a run+on sentence .
so be sure to catch those .
&-uh footnoting there's still some huge confusion going on about footnoting you guys are trying to footnote &-um you're footnoting but you're thinking bibliography .
and &-uh the difference well there's there're many differences I guess the underlying purpose <of the> <of the> of the whole affair is the same but do this alright ?
just do this until somebody pulls you aside and says that's wrong okay which I'm betting will never happen .
you got you're writing an essay you've read about three or four authors for this essay .
okay ?
the first time you mention or you quote from one of the authors that you read for this essay for this paper that you're writing footnote that person .
okay ?
and footnote that person &-um in the format that I gave you alright on that printed thing alright also it's in your little brown handbook .
and at the end of that footnote alright which should it should end with the page number that this citation is taken from put a semicolon and give a little message like further &-uh further citations will be done parenthetically .
okay ?
and then after that each time you cite cite this author <you just> &~y you just have to put a parentheses an open parenthesis author's name page that's that this citation is taken from and closed parenthesis .
alright ?
you don't hafta go nuts with this either .
alright ?
if you're +//.
if in one paragraph you're talking about a certain aspect of an argument or a certain bit of text that you've already cited you don't hafta keep citing this same person .
alright ?
&-um Amy you do this .
you go nuts with the footnoting .
&-um I commend you for being kinda responsible because you don't wanna take credit for &~a another person's work .
but if it's clear just in the text in your own text that you're talking about somebody else's writing or that it's clear or it's clear that you are continuing in the vein that you have been right and you've already footnoted that it's okay you can let off of that .
alright ?
footnotes go at the bottom of the same page &=laughs as the citation that the footnote is referring to .
if it doesn't it should all go at the end of the paper on a separate page called works cited or something .
okay ?
or notes .
alright ?
what else ?
when you quote something or whenever you you use &-um quotation marks right either to denote something that's being cited or the title of an essay or some other work that deserves quotations &=writes:board punctuation goes inside the quotation marks .
mkay ?
so the last thing that occurs on that sentence is this thing .
alright ?
not the period or the comma .
if you're using any other kind of punctuation point alright &-uh other than the period or the comma semicolon colon exclamation point or question mark or others okay those go out on the outside .
hm .
hm ?
I thought it was the opposite .
<no no> no no .
&=laughs this is outside this is inside .
so wait <when we> when we put like Foucault page whatever the period goes after the parenthesis right ?
or it goes inside the quotation ?
no no .
<that's not> that's not a punctuation Foucault whatever you talking about a parenthetical citation ?
yeah +/.
+, yeah .
do we put the punctuation inside the parenthesis and put a period <at the end of> ?
&-um usually not .
unless you need to cite the punctuation that the author is using too .
here .
mhm +/.
+, mystify is the last word used in a sentence by Foucault alright ?
and you wanna cite this sentence right ?
so you got blah blah blah mystify right ?
and close the quotes cite him Foucault period here .
okay ?
if you're not doing this or if the citation doesn't occur at the end of the sentence +...
okay let's say it comes in the middle of a sentence then the comma or the well I guess it would only be a comma goes here .
okay ?
if mystify is the title of a work +...
an essay by Foucault and that comes at the end of a sentence that you're writing period inside .
(be)cause you don't need this the only &~w reason why you violate the inside quotation mark rule here is because you've got the citation and you can't let that float between this sentence and the one after it .
okay ?
but other &~th other than that &-um always inside .
it's a small thing I know .
I know .
&-um but you know if it doesn't really matter to you which way you <do it> do it the right way and you really won't have to worry about it .
okay ?
and this way somebody'll know that a person like me taught you this stuff .
and I'll be remembered .
yeah ?
what were you what &=laughs:multiple you know that line that you had ?
okay what what were you saying was the separation between having &-uh like an exclamation point or a question mark and you said that wouldn't go in +/.
no .
+, the quotation ?
or I didn't hear what you were saying .
+, see how you have that line you have like period then you have a comma +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ and then on the ⌉ other side you have semicolon .
uhuh .
this stuff goes inside unless you've got a citation to include in your sentence +/.
okay .
+, this stuff goes outside .
of quotations ?
right .
always ?
always .
see that's totally new to me .
are you sure ?
&=laughs it isn't actually .
&=laughs:multiple &-um here's why &-uh you can the thing is if you add a comma here and it's your comma and not Foucault's comma you know you still need the comma so it's alright .
right ?
&~th &~y that's like it's sliding .
it's it's +//.
technically you're adding something to Foucault's text .
so you know there +//.
it's worth thinking about but if it's just a comma or a period I guess the decision has been made it's alright .
but if it's a significant punctuation point like one of these ?
right let's say you were really excited about this sentence and you wanted an exclamation point of your own well if you had it inside then you're attributing the exclamation point to Foucault which is a significant change &-um to the tone of the sentence maybe .
okay +/.
+, that's why it goes on the outside .
right so here you are really interested or excited about his thoughts on mystification question mark goes here or you had no idea what he was talking about &=laughs &~quot question mark goes here or &-uh exclamation goes there question goes there .
what if the punctuation is in the quote ?
oh if he has used the punctuation ?
use it and then it's stupid but you've gotta put a period at the end of it too +/.
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ (o)kay ⌉ ?
to denote the end of a sentence +...
yeah .
&-um there are people who do this for a living &=laughs:multiple study this kind of thing xxx copy editors and others .
&-um right so there're rules for things even if you think that the whole endeavor is kind_of pointless .
&-um what else did I &~nee oh titles of essays are in quotation marks okay titles of books titles of movies titles of plays the name of a ship those things all go &-um either are underlined or italicized right rules for that in your little brown book as well .
oh do you see how you would never footnote and parenthetical cite at the same time ?
right that would never be there would never be an occasion for that .
so don't do that .
the essays that you will be referring to the &~Ha Hammer and Malak essays from the course pack right ?
when you got the course pack there was a cover page and the printing information was on that cover page .
&=laughs refer to that for the information that needs to go <in the paper> +...
what you lost it ?
probably ?
probably xxx (0.10) .
oh no this ?
show me .
next one .
next page .
⌊ not that page ⌋ .
⌈ nah nah ⌉ not that page .
yeah .
tadah .
isn't that nice ?
that is just great .
don't copy it exactly (be)cause that's not in footnote footnote format .
&=laughs:S2 okay but all the information is there +...
so show me you know how to do this stuff .
right for this last paper (be)cause I've been letting it slide (be)cause I'm more interested in you &-um learning the other things that I've taught you .
but &-uh you_know you should learn this too .
(0.7) okay .
(0.18) take a look at &-uh one of these handouts that I just gave you the one that starts documents such as .
(0.13) you need one &~t &~h +/.

it shouldn't feel like a reunion but &=laughs:multiple it kinda does .

&=laughs:multiple .

yeah .
okay .
I think he played like tuba or something something <that's loud> &=laughs:multiple ⌈ I think he's ⌉ +/.
⌊ he played what ⌋ ?
+, partially deaf or something .
he plays like tuba or something like that .
oh .
I think that hm .
didn't he tell us that ?
⌈ xxx <that stuff> ⌉ .
⌊ yeah he's in the music school ⌋ .
yeah okay +/.
+, he's definitely a brass person .
&=laughs:multiple .
okay &-um look at this long paragraph in the middle &-um I'm +...
<this is> this is gonna &~g it's gonna sound stupid but I like long paragraphs .
&-um I like long paragraphs because if there's a good reason for its length &-um it means that the student is on to something or is willing to to think this through .
it's a better sign than you know short paragraphs that &-um are not transitioning well between one to the next .
I want you to &-uh look over this paragraph with me and &-uh we're looking for just &-uh style here right because the language here I thought was pretty tight .
&-um although there are some &~co &~co corrections that I would make but when it's on I thought &-um <it was> it was on .
&{l=READING Greenbladt examines written history in his &~tit essay titled Marvelous Possessions .
&}l=READING actually I don't like that first sentence .
okay &-um qualify what I just said &-uh with with what I'm going to say about this first sentence .
&-uh the first sentence ideally should provide &-uh a topic of discussion <for the> &~s for the sentence that +//.
for the paragraph that it's starting or it should provide some sort of reasonable transition from the paragraph that occurred before it .
okay ?
that Greenbladt examines written history is a timid claim and is not going to serve either of those goals .
okay ?
&-um right it's just this paragraph is just saying this guy Greenbladt wrote an essay called Marvelous Possessions .
okay ?
&-um so you see in that in the margins I would say something like work for a better transition sentence .
&-um &{l=READING Columbus's arrival in the new world in fourteen ninety two and his claim of the land for the king and queen are obvious obviously cases of cultural dominance +//.
&}l=READING obvious cases of cultural dominance .
&{l=READING Columbus lands and proclaims possession of the land .
the essay begins with pointing out &}l=READING the essay begins by pointing out &{l=READING the contradiction in claiming land that is already named and inhabited +...
further the act of taking possession of the land itself is is is described in detail as a specific set of procedures .
the procedure includes declaring witnessing and recording .
&}l=READING footnote should be on the bottom .
&{l=READING all three of these involve the use of language something the indigenous people did not understand .
the procedure and the use +//.
and use of language was used to create official historical texts and to write history .
&}l=READING okay stop there for a second .
&-um first question I have when I see that footnote is why is the footnote there ?
right why has this author chosen to footnote that sentence ?
or that thought as opposed to ones before it or after it ?
&-um I couldn't figure out a good reason for her doing this .
&-um so probably maybe the footnote should have occurred after Marvelous Possessions right &~af right off the bat ?
okay ?
you mentioned the essay &-um footnote it there .
and then afterwards you can just kinda &-um take it for granted that the reader is following you .
okay ?
the &~fir procedure for &~in listen to these &-um these three sentences one more time .
&{l=READING the procedure includes declaring witnessing and recording .
all three of these involve the use of language something the indigenous people did not understand .
the procedure and use of language was used to create official historical texts and to write history &}l=READING okay ?
these three sentences are very close to each_other .
alright that that is they they're relevant to one another they're talking about &-uh a_couple_of things but it's all in that same area of discussion .
right ?
language as used by Columbus versus the kinda language that we imagine the indigenous people used .
and the confusion or the &~m the non communication between the two that you know resulted in kind_of writing that Columbus did write .
some difficulty though in expressing that or you know it's not great difficulty but it could be better .
&-um first of all that second sentence &{l=READING all three of these involved the use of language something the indigenous people did not understand &}l=READING makes it sound like the indigenous people did not understand the use of language and we don't mean that we mean this particular use of language .
okay ?
so &-uh the quick fix for that sentence would be all three of these involved the kind of &~y language that the indigenous people did not &~unders understand .
alright ?
&-um or or something other that that doesn't need a comma between it right ?
so that the sentence is clear about &-uh what it is the indigenous people that the indigenous people did not understand .
okay ?
but I'm going to propose that there could be even a better fix that marries that first sentence with the second sentence &-um and in a happy way .
&{l=READING the procedure includes declaring witnessing and recording &}l=READING how (a)bout a colon there ?
and then the next one is you know restating what this declaring witnessing and recording is about right ?
I told you that's one of the one of the the occasions for for a colon right ?
when you say or resay something in other words that you mention at the beginning of this clause .
right ?
&-um the root of all evil colon money some such thing .
&=laughs:multiple the procedure includes declaring witnessing and recording colon an event of language that the indigenous people did not understand +...
okay ?
how (a)bout that ?
I don't think there's any loss of meaning loss of content .
and the thing is quick right ?
it's tight .
&{l=READING the procedure and use of language was used to create official historical texts and to write history &}l=READING &-um I don't like the double double use <use of> use of language and used and also historical texts and to write history right ?
&-uh when you see the same word coming up too many times or more than once like this <in the> in the same sentence unless you mean it right unless you're cluning cluing the reader in to two separate use of of a word that &-um you are necessarily playing against each_other or &~jux juxtaposing in some meaningful way &-um usually this deserves some sort of editing .
okay &-um get out a thesaurus and instead of use twice you know find a &~secon another word for the second for the second occasion .
or maybe the problem is just well you're trying to split too many hairs or you can say this in sort_of one breath without needing to come <back and forth> .
bless you .
+, &-um I think this is an example of that last kind of problem .
okay ?
&-um there's meaning here for sure but it's not being it's it's stumbling on its own words .
okay ?
&-uh I think here try this on and see if it makes &-uh makes an improvement or if if the correction loses something .
the procedural use of language right maybe instead of procedure and use of language maybe we can just say the procedural use of language or the formalist use of language the formal use of language makes official texts and creates written history .
makes official texts I mean makes makes texts official .
okay ?
&-um the procedural use of language makes texts official and creates written history +...
does that sound okay to you ?
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um I think that's a good fix for that sentence but <if you> if you write that sentence I also worry about <lack of> &~s lack of transition or &-um some sort of awkwardness &-uh between those two sentences that is now you've got two sentences well you already do now but even after the fix you've got two sentences that start the procedure .
okay ?
so maybe you can actually make those three sentences into one long one that reads something like the procedure includes declaring witnessing and recording colon an event of language that the indigenous people &~d did not understand comma that this procedure +//.
that this procedural use of language makes official texts and creates written history +...
or maybe instead of comma a semicolon .
right whatever you know whatever the end result &-um I'm getting you guys to start to understand start to notice where or <what a> &~pa what a sentence will do in_order_to show you clue you in that &-uh it needs help .
&=laughs the sentences are crying out for help .
&=laughs:S4 &-um and other fixes that you can make in_order_to really make efficient your constructions .
alright ?
&-um the theme of this +//.
the theme for for writing papers in this class has always been you write better in_order_to think better and vice versa .
right ?
if you get your sentences in line if you get your thoughts in line and make them behave it will lead to content that you otherwise would have overlooked .
alright ?
inexact words will &~le lead to inexact thoughts +...
&-um &{l=READING since the indigenous people did not know the language the only historical information comes from the dominant culture as Greenbladt states writing in this case quote fixes a set of public linguistic acts etcetera .
interesting &}l=READING no comma &{l=READING interesting is the fact that the procedure for claiming the land &~in involved a declaration .
this declaration was made in a language that the indigenous people did not understand &}l=READING right .
&-um there's a candidate for contraction right ?
those two sentences could easily go in one sentence .
no need to end the word +//.
end the sentence talking about declaration restart another one talking about declaration right ?
involved a declaration that was made in a language that &-uh the indigenous people did not understand .
&{l=READING in a letter Columbus writes that he was met with no opposition upon claiming the land .
since the native people did not know what he said this lack of opposition was stated for the Europeans to read and record history further validating their possession of the land .
the language used in letters written by Columbus is analyzed throughout the essay .
Columbus also wrote letters admiring the &~orderl orderliness of the society he encountered however these comments came later and were &~no were not established as historical facts as the procedure of possession was .
&}l=READING okay ?
I like this part of the paragraph because we're getting away from what we now see has been &-um although high quality summary nonetheless summary .
okay ?
the stuff that comes before this however sentence &-um is a retelling of Greenbladt .
okay ?
and I told you some of that is necessary .
&-um and I think this writer gets away with it because she does it well .
&-um but it is just still summary .
alright here with this however clause we've got some activity .
alright here the author is stepping in and doing something .
&{l=READING these comments came later and were not established as historical facts as the procedure of possession was .
&}l=READING good .
&{l=READING Columbus also wrote of the marvelous nature of the new world .
regardless his first letter served to establish historical facts that they have authority and have the conquered the &~l land .
&}l=READING okay ?
something going on here .
okay ?
and this is really telling .
&-um most of you guys when you happen upon a really good thought will freeze .
&=laughs you know ?
you &~r you scare yourself at that moment and you will scramble back toward summary again .
okay ?
and that scrambling back is really noticeable in instances like this where it seems like the scrambling back is not necessary .
okay ?
Columbus also wrote of the marvelous nature of the &~y new world .
there's a definite break in thought between that sentence and the one before it .
okay ?
that shouldn't be for a number of reasons .
one reason &~m most obvious reason being that it breaks up the flow of the flow of the paragraph but also because well you're onto something there .
right ?
don't go back to Columbus yet .
talk about this difference between what Columbus writes about and what he sees .
how much of what he sees translates into what he writes about and why ?
right that's what Greenbladt is getting at that's why he studies text .
alright there's a whole world of things and a whole person's worth of thoughts and feelings that Columbus is under at this moment .
but out_of those out_of that world he only chooses a_couple_of details to write about .
okay why ?
why that selection ?
that's what the author's on &-uh but passes that moment too quickly .
okay ?
this stuff becomes obvious &-uh when I talk about it it should become obvious to you when you look at it yourself .
right that is between drafts .
if you go to a draft and look at it &-uh let's say you've given it a day right you haven't worked on it all day yesterday .
and you go go to it and read it as if you were &-um well as if you hadn't read it &~a as if you hadn't written it yourself .
right ?
approach it as you would approach a foreign text .
and see how it stands up under those circumstances .
right ?
under those demands .
questions here ?
is that a hand or throwing hair ?
&=laughs okay .
&=laughs:multiple okay &-um let's see .
take a look at the next one &=sneeze:SUf +/.
+, bless you +/.
+, thank you .
+, &-um the one by Waylett +...
well it's gonna be hard to keep a secret that this is Chris because the paper we're doing will have his first and last name on the first page right ?
but it's okay because we're here to &-um say good things about Chris .
&-um here's &-um a good example of a paper right or a a part of a paper kind_of &~tranzen transcending the needs of a paper right the need to talk about and mention and sort_of evidence your knowledge of a text that you've written right ?
and application .
right ?
and the evidence for this is well there's stuff being talked about here that hasn't been talked about before by any of these authors singly .
this is what I called &-um writing in the intersection of things right ?
taking one person's idea and applying them &-um in another area of discussion right ?
this is what happens here .
it's a bit messy okay and Chris admits to this so I don't mind telling you right &-um it's a bit messy but once you catch on to the reasoning behind it &-um and the discussion too &-um you'll see that it's pretty good .
here &{l=READING this formalism described by Greenbladt is an intriguing process that places something of an unjust act and makes it appear fair and inviting &}l=READING he's talking about the open formalism and the closed formalism Greenbladt mentions .
&{l=READING this idea of open and closed formalism is seen throughout the different texts in this discussion .
&}l=READING okay ?
in the margin I said &~sent this sentence needs to go elsewhere I'll tell you why later on .
&{l=READING since Columbus figured that he was landing on an island &~inha inhabited by the Indians under the control of the Grand Khan it is clear that he didn't believe he was making a discovery merely ignoring the natives .
Columbus clearly recognized the Indians as the owners of the land and included them in his contract in which he claims Spanish ownership of the land &}l=READING &-uh you see my editing there ?
alright &{l=READING my including the +//.
by including the Indians as witnesses he is therefore giving them recognition in the declaration .
he accomplishes this +//.
his goal of ownership in a very vague form so as to leave room for interpretation later on .
Columbus refrains from using too many details since he hardly even knows what he has just discovered .
Columbus was successful at &~attem accomplishing a legalistic act that would entitle his monarch monarchs to <the land> the land he had just come across as_well_as all its entities .
&}l=READING okay ?
this wasn't clear to me until I got to the next paragraph but what you see Chris doing here is he's starting he started this this page or he ended this +//.
he ended the page before talking about open formalism and drawing the reader's attention to that part of Greenbladt's text .
what he's doing then is giving a paragraph to the openness of the formalism and then a paragraph after that to the closedness of the formalism .
this wasn't entirely clear to me Chris because you end the incomplete paragraph on this page by saying this idea of open and closed formalism is seen throughout .
so I think here and now you're either going to move on and talk about other texts where open and closedness is relevant or &-uh or something else .
I didn't know that you were still continuing in that vein .
I needed to reorient myself and I I probably shouldn't have hadta do that .
okay ?
also it's not clear in that first full paragraph that you're talking about the openness of the open part of of of Greenbladt's binary .
alright ?
you don't mention that there you don't mention the word open or you don't use it as you do in the last &~in &-uh incomplete sentence incomplete paragraph .
on the other hand this act of formalism was very closed and corrupt toward the Indians right ?
now I know because I guess the <on the> &~o on the other hand transition I think oh okay now I see what he's doing .
he's given me one now he's giving me the other .
alright ?
too much confusion here .
right ?
or or it doesn't need to be this confusion doesn't need to occur .
&-um (be)cause it's a really simple fix .
&{l=READING Columbus obviously knew that the natives didn't speak English and that no one was going to oppose him he included them in his proclamation not to give them a voice in the matter but only to use their absence of opposition against themselves .
this action was very closed to the Indians not only because Columbus used their ignorance as a trick but also because his declaration was then legally binding against the Indians from that point on .
&}l=READING that's good .
alright that's tight &-um the language there is efficient and that's a pretty succinct way of putting this part of the argument .
alright this part of the summary .
&-um notice also how much Chris has spent talking about openness and closedness alright ?
it could have easily been a sentence or two mentioned and then you know this discussion could have carried on he doesn't do this right ?
he stays with this idea throughout the paper he mentions it here in_order_to clarify what Greenbladt means by it but he also does this thing with the other essays and surprisingly with &-uh the Tempest and Starship Troopers too .
alright ?
that's engagement right ?
that's application .
take an idea use it in other occasions .
okay ?
do that and you'll also take care of &-um problems with thesis and argument right main argument right ?
the thesis here is that this open and closedness can be seen in other works .
right and &~th and it all goes toward this whole thing about culture and misunderstanding and wrong histories and right histories .
okay ?
big idea you pare it down by finding &-uh a single element that captures it pretty well take that into other texts and show me how it works there .
yeah ?
textbook .
okay ?
&-um one more look at Anderson seven .
this is Eric's paper &-um +...
Eric does essentially what Chris does &-uh but he's got a_lot more style about it .
&=laughs but what he gains in style he loses in sort_of &-um content or he doesn't go on for as long with an idea &-um as Chris is willing to +...
oh he also has this comma splice problem &-um so <I can> I can point that out to you here too .
&{l=READING Pratt would agree with Shakespeare with regard to why there exists a power differential between Caliban and Prospero &}l=READING he has a comma there clearly shouldn't be .
&{l=READING Caliban has no chance at power because he lacks the education refinement +//.
and refinement that is required of a leader .
Caliban like Wamanpoma &-um lacks the formalism that is required to obtain power he has no chance of being a leader because he doesn't &}l=READING &-uh yeah that's a comma splice too which I missed &{l=READING he has no chance of being a leader because he doesn't have the skills that are established by the authoritative power .
&}l=READING &-uh authoritative power might be redundant .
&{l=READING Caliban is a creature of sensation not intellect and until he can become more of a reasoning being his chance at freedom is small .
Shakespeare like Pratt wants to argue that leadership and power should not be decided from this authoritative &~p point of view a suggestion that is evident in Prospero giving up his art at the end of the book .
in_order_to become a good leader Prospero must become an equal with the rest of humanity &~los using loyalty instead of magic in_order_to lead .
&}l=READING okay ?
&-um yeah that's &~r that's &-um Eric is really smooth about the arguments that he makes that is he he doesn't interrupt stuff by saying this is like what we read about Greenbladt here .
or this resembles Pratt here .
right ?
he goes into it immediately almost effortlessly by just using their language .
alright ?
so he says in that last long sentence or the second to last sentence &{l=READING Shakespeare like Pratts wants to argue that leadership of &~pow and power should not be decided from this authoritative point of view a suggestion that is evident in Prospero giving up his art .
&}l=READING that's a really good point about Prospero giving up his art .
right ?
or Chris is &-uh Eric is suggesting that the art that he gives up his power this magic that Prospero gives up at the end of the play signifies right a surrendering of this sort_of this whole &-um hierarchy of power .
alright ?
the hierarchy of power that has &-uh oppressed Caliban and enslaved him and has on the other hand &-um reinstated the dukedom to Prospero .
okay ?
&-um right .
that's a pretty good point .
I would say .
&-um but he does it too quickly right I feel like he could give me at least two more sentences on it just to make things clear .
but I know he's on to this I know he he he knows this &-um just by virtue of of the fact that he can use it this well in this sentence +...
okay ?
so take Chris and take and Eric right and like merge their brains into one &=sneeze:SUf and you've got all the good ⌈ parts ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ bless you ⌋ +/.
+, of a paper .
+, thanks &=laughs +/.
+, okay +...
buddy up will you ?
(be)cause I don't have enough copies of this +...
just take one <for like two or three people> .
(0.28) do you have questions about any of the &-um the samples that I that we went over so far ?
(0.11) okay Chris you wanna prep us or anything ?
you wanna say anything before we go over your your draft ?
&-uh not really .
&=laughs it's a little it's rough .
I haven't actually read the whole thing <you know all at once> so but yeah .
okay .
I don't know if there's anything xxx &=laughs .
did you were you able to do a draft for the previous paper ?
yeah .
okay &-um I should've liked to ask Chris &-uh Eric that too .
&-um okay .
let's do Chris's .
(0.8) tell you what &-um since I'm getting kinda tired of just reading the whole thing myself &=laughs why don't we go around and we'll take paragraphs and I'll hold you responsible for talking about that paragraph .
okay ?
&{l=READING Margaret Atwood's story The Handmaid's Tale is a satire depicting the dangers of Christian fundamentalists especially the danger pertaining to women .
On a first glance the novel appears to criticize Christian beliefs but after a closer look the novel really doesn't at all criticize the beliefs taught in the Bible the novel is a satire on the people who use the Bible as justification for their oppressive behavior .
&}l=READING right .
&{l=READING Atwood portrays her belief of our society's effects on women &}l=READING effects there the right one or the wrong one ?
the right one ?
+, yeah .
&=laughs:multiple &{l=READING through the character of Offred .
Offred is a typical woman who is victimized by a society overly controlled by men who abuse their power greatly .
&}l=READING oh that's awkward .
overly controlled by men who &~abu abuse their power greatly right ?
&-uh one too many adverbs .
&-um and other things too +...
is a satire depicting the dangers of Christian fundamentalists +...
hm +...
okay that's alright .
I think you mean Christian fundamentalism .
right ?
+, yeah +/.
+, it's not the people we're scared of it's the idea right ?
but we're not &~i this isn't a story about you know Jerry Falwell or something like that alright this is a story about the thought the ideology .
&-um especially the danger pertaining to women pertaining there is the wrong word to talk about what danger is doing to women right ?
it's it's a weak word it's an indirect word .
right ?
danger pertains to women ?
what <does that mean> does that mean that the women are under danger or the women just have to do with the danger in some ways right ?
you mean something like the danger &-um pointed at women I don't know that's stupid too but &~y you see what I mean there .
+, yeah okay .
+, &=laughs &-um &{l=READING on a first glance the novel appears to &~critic criticize Christian beliefs +...
but after a closer look the novel really doesn't at all criticize the beliefs taught in the Bible &}l=READING Bible is capitalized .
&{l=READING the novel is a satire on the people who use the Bible as &~justifica &}l=READING is a satire on the people is just a longish way of saying satirizes .
okay ?
&~na novel satirizes the people who use the Bible to justify their oppressive behavior .
okay ?
<use the> &~w use the verb when you have the word +//.
verb you don't hafta make verbs out_of is and nouns .
alright ?
&-uh okay .
next one .
Leslie why don't you do the next paragraph .
okay .
&{l=READING according to Hammer Handmaid delivers a clear message opposing Christian fundamentalism .
American Christian fundamentalists are fanatical and dishonest and therefore highly dangerous .
they seek to erode the liberties which all Americans and especially American women cherish .
this satire is valid in the sense that all of the dogmas and morals of Christianity are panoptic and therefore dangerous but invalid in any accurate account of what fundamental Christianity is .
&}l=READING .
what do you think ?
+, things you would change ?
if any ?
it's to the point .
it's clear .
&=laughs:multiple .
&=laughs are you just being nice to Chris ?
or do you ⌈ really feel that way ?
or are you just hedging your bets ?
or ⌉ .
⌊ &-um is that last sentence ⌋ the &~w the satire is that a &-um run+on sentence sort_of ?
hm ?
+, the last &~sen well the last sentence of the paragraph this satire is valid could that be like maybe broken up ?
how ?
&-um &{l=READING this satire is valid in the sense that &}l=READING &-um maybe he can explain more about &-um why it's valid like what the dogmas and morals are .

Sarah ?
&{l=READING the suggestion that the fundamental Christian world of Gilead exists in our world today leads to the conclusion that Christianity is a panoptical religion .
the premise of Christianity is that people can personally have a relationship with God and that he always is watching us .
this power and knowledge of God makes him the ultimate eye .
oh +/.
+, &{l=READING a Christian could live a full life of sin and deception and never suffer any consequences .
but being under the constant surveillance of God will inevitably lead most devout Christians towards confession and repentance .
the only other feasible outcome for a true believing Christian who struggles with sin is to fall from their faith .
much like the consequence in Gilead of being sent to the colonies a Christian may fear the ultimate consequence of eternity in hell .
&}l=READING wow +...
or any of you this isn't just Sarah's paragraph +...
&-um just like for the sentence that says have a relationship with God and that he always is watching us would you say he is always watching us ?
is it +...
where should you put the always ?
oh say again ?
which sentence ?
it's between the first and ⌈ the second ⌉ .
⌊ between the first ⌋ and the second page that that he always is watching us would you say he is always watching us ?
&{l=READING and that he always is watching us .
&}l=READING is always watching us sounds better to me .
yeah .
<I thought it should be that> .
I like it .
⌈ I like it a_lot ⌉ .
⌊ I like it too ⌋ .
yeah .
&-uh oh .
there's an example of where a period should go inside quotes right ?
the ultimate eye dot end quote +...
is that fair to use eye like that ?
(be)cause I don't know I don't know .
fair ?
yeah fair like it's a thing from the book that isn't explained at all but kind_of assume that it's .
&-uh hm +...
maybe you should footnote that actually .
okay .
yeah .
good .
and you can <get that> &-um get that footnote out_of the way too .
question about that one .
would you like if he's footnoting that would he like give a a definition of what that eye is in Atwood at in the footnote ?
you know how like ⌈ sometimes ⌉ .
⌊ in the ⌋ footnote ?
yeah +/.
+, mm you could for sure <you could> you could define eye or you could sort_of &~r remind the reader or for the benefit of somebody who hasn't read that book &-uh talk about what the eyes are in the novel in the footnote .
okay ?
you would do that if the rest of this paragraph is going to go on talking about eyes but not really pause to to explain what they are okay ?
the other thing you can do is not do that in the footnote and just sort of briefly do it in the sentence that talks about the eye .
okay ?
yeah but for sure you can do that sort of thing in the footnote .
&~h how would you do it would you put that before like all the information or after the information ?
after .
okay .
+, mhm +...
anything else ?
I don't see anything terribly wrong with it .
no it looks good to me too .
yeah I like this idea immensely .
&-um I don't know why I didn't thought &-uh why I didn't think about this before .
alright ?
&-um faith I think here <is the> is the right word .
alright ?
&~w you were talking about the relationship between the panoptic inmate and the guard the unseen guard right ?
that relationship is one of faith .
it's a perversion of faith but you know it's it's it's the same thing it's not it's believing in something that you don't see or you have no proof of .
right ?
right so maybe &-um not a big mistake or an accident that Christian fundamentalists &-um well a theocracy like Gilead operates under &-uh panoptic rules .
good good good .
next one ?
Jenny ?
&{l=READING it doesn't appear that Atwood's satire is necessarily directed at Christianity but instead toward Christian followers who do not hold the faith of their religion but embrace the rituals and dogmas of their church .
since the women of Gilead aren't allowed to read the Bible they are given a very skewed image of what is in the Bible .
in a Biblical sense fruit is usually considered to be the result of the spirit such as peace love and good works .
in Gilead the fruit always refers to the babies .
mhm .
+, &{l=READING this is drawn from the Bible description of Jesus being the fruit of Mary's womb .
this &~mi misinterpretation doesn't exist in our world but only in Gilead .
other parts of the Bible that are looked at in Gilead are verses about male dominance and women being submissive and bearing children .
Atwood has a fairly +//.
has a very fair dispute with the Christian view on this subject but she places a ridiculous amount of focus on this topic .
in Gilead the verses from the Bible that deal with this issue seem to be the only verses anyone looks at .
&}l=READING .
oops what what ?
stick with one verses .
S E S not S U S .
⌈ oh yeah ⌉ .
+, ⌊ &~vers ⌋ versus S U S is me versus him .
+, yeah .
+, Tyson versus Holyfield .
+, oh +/.
+, okay .
&{l=READING Jesus isn't isn't even mentioned in this satire against the Christian faith .
similar to disputes over homosexuality verses are &~emphas emphasized out_of &}l=READING +/.
that one too +/.
+, &{l=READING parts of the Old Testament that most Christians have probably never read .
the whole handmaid system comes from a practice found in the Old Testament .
passages found in the obscure places in the Old Testament are usually difficult to interpret in any good sense of context and for the most part were abolished with the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ .
&}l=READING .
mm ?
well it sounds like <you know> the Bible pretty well .
&=laughs:multiple .
&-um you used aloud &{l=SIC L A O U D &}l=SIC shouldn't it be A L L O W E D ?
oh where ?
&-um in the second sentence &{l=READING since the women of Gilead aren't allowed &}l=READING .
oh yeah yeah .
that's a good contribution &=laughs:multiple .
xxx .
&=laughs that was easy .
&=laughs yeah that's the thing I'm like .
&=laughs you are tricky .
&-um that sentence &~en &~s that sentence I don't like anyway .
&{l=READING since the women of Gilead aren't allowed to read the Bible they are given a skewed &~vi image of what is in the Bible .
&}l=READING right what what .
just (be)cause it says Bible twice <in there> ?
⌈ yeah why why xxx ⌉ .
⌊ maybe it should be like they aren't ⌋ allowed to read period you know read .
yeah .
⌈ right ⌉ .
⌊ like just ⌋ get rid of that first the Bible ?
xxx .
yeah I know .
I have a like I have a question about that in general like repeating the same word in a sentence is that like always bad or is it okay sometimes ?
&-uh well it's it's never bad .
right ?
it's not a bad like +/.
⌈ like could it be good sometimes to do ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ pull you aside and ⌋ &=laughs make you sit in a corner bad but .
like in the sentence in the paragraph before this one he uses consequence twice but it doesn't seem like it interrupts like the flow of the sentence or anything .
mm .
&-um okay I'll I'll give you this this to you in terms of kind of what's better and what's worse (be)cause of it's not really a rule &-um <what would be> what would be bad or towards bad is &-um both using a word the same &~wo word more than once when you don't need to and also you can hear that word being reported repeated and so it distracts you .
okay ?
better than that would be repeating a word &-um but it doesn't really +//.
you don't really hear it like the consequence one which I didn't catch either .
&-um better than that would be not repeating the word at all and better than that would be &-um using words that really make the subtle distinction between ideas if there exists such a a distinction and and it's it's &-uh relevant to what you're talking about .
repeat words if you're if you mean it <if that> if that has a point .
okay ?
maybe the first time you use that word you use it in one way and you mean for the reader to understand it and the second time you mean it there's a second aspect to that word that you mean in in that part of the sentence .
right ?
but you know those scarce +//.
cases are rare &-um so otherwise it's it's usually just &-uh &-um you know laziness of of writing right of of writing drafts .
&-um you didn't feel like taking out a thesaurus at that moment or you just wanted to get that idea down on the page before you forgot it or something .
alright ?
&-um so fix it between drafts .
&-um good .
you have anything to say about what Chris is talking about here ?
(0.7) .
when he says that &-um I don't remember what it was about her use of the scriptures being ridiculous ?
&-um hold on I gotta find it .
ridiculous amount of focus on this topic .
yeah .
it doesn't I don't +//.
like the statement doesn't seem to be really like proved afterwards how it is ridiculous like because like there are like a_lot_of people who still use the Old Testament you know like .
uhuh okay .
the Old Testament like ideally like was supposed to be you know the like Christian Scientists or like churches like that only use the Old Testament so like it seems like .
right yeah that's good .
&-uh maybe you want to say that you think this is ridiculous because well &-um it's it's a convenient use of it's a convenient &-um taking out_of context of certain passages right that might be &~proma &-uh problematized by other parts of the Bible .
right ?
I think you're you're getting at that you're +//.
that's why you're saying they don't talk about Jesus .
also because like there's scriptures in the New Testament that also like in Thessalonians and Phillipians it +/.

the guy says we'll let the the Old Testament be our guide or be our constitution or something like that I don't think there's anything like that in the book right ?
any you know &-uh proof that this that Gilead is only listening to the Old Testament .

okay ?
but also because you have a certain you have like a bone to pick here right ?
you you notice that about the tone here so far ?
okay ?
I mean I'm not suggesting that you guys you know pick fights with authors &-um but if you do right it sure gives you something to say it gives you something to argue for .
right ?
so <in that> &~r in that regard it's it's good it's to be welcomed .
I have another +/.
yeah +/.
+, <thought there> .
&-um I think the sentence like in the middle where it says &{l=READING this misinterpretation doesn't exist in our world but only in Gilead &}l=READING do you really &=laughs believe that that is true ?
like +/.

do they really refer to being like the fruit as being .
you mean like this specific ?
I was talking yeah ⌊ specifically with the fruit ⌋ .
⌈ oh okay ⌉ .
you might wanna like specify (be)cause it seems more like to me like you're saying like this sort_of misinterpretation of the Bible doesn't ⌊ occur in our world ⌋ .
⌈ as a whole you mean ?
&~s ⌉ yeah .
yeah +/.
+, I just meant specifically that .
+, oh okay .

+, okay +/.
+, I don't know because of their need for babies .
you wanna do the next one ?
okay ?
Matt I think that's yours .
&-um &{l=READING Atwood isn't the first author to make a criticism against the Christian church .
criticize .
criticize the church .
hm ?
+, okay .
+, yeah .
+, &{l=READING Mark Twain's portrayal of the Sunday Christians in Huckleberry Finn are two+faced and hypocritical .
this kind of satire on Christianity is acceptable because it makes its point but is still nonoffensive to a large Christian audience .
although Margaret Atwood and Samuel Clemens clearly oppose Christianity their satires are altogether trivial towards the Christian faith and only oppose the structures and dogmas of the church which are admittedly inherently evil .
it's hard to tell if Atwood's attempt is to entirely &~i is to entirely sincere &}l=READING .
be sincere +..?
is &~enst +/.
⌊ yeah it sounds sounds weird ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ entirely sincere or is to be ⌉ entirely sincere ?
one or the other ?
&{l=READING or somewhat constrained for the sake of popularity .
&}l=READING .
&-um what do you think Matt ?
who was the Sunday Christian in Huck Finn ?
I don't remember .
he goes &~t I don't xxx &=laughs .
I don't really like that second sentence .
he ends up with this &~fa it's the Romeo and Juliet thing where they have the two families who are +/.
oh +/.

yeah okay okay .
&-um hm +...
go on Matt .
I didn't mean to interrupt .
&-um I just I didn't like that second sentence .
you didn't like the second sentence ?
what's wrong with it ?
I don't know he's saying that the Christian is two+faced and hypocritical or ⌊ this ⌋ +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.

+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ Twain ⌉ is ?
the Christians .
oh yeah right .
yeah it's xxx .
yeah &-uh right now it reads that the portrayal is two+faced portrayal are two+faced so that doesn't make sense &-um of the two+faced Sunday Christians right ?
you need something like that .
&-uh I think that's a dead end Matt &-uh Chris .
yeah .
+, yeah you're you're not talking about it enough to warrant it being mentioned .
so if you can <if you're gonna> if you're gonna cite some of this and no no that's that's opening up a whole new avenue of discussion .
yeah I'd take that out .
okay ?
you only talk about it here right ?
yeah I think so .
okay .
yeah take it out .
&{l=READING it is hard to tell if Atwood's attempt is to be entirely sincere or somewhat constrained for the sake of popularity &}l=READING &-uh constrained constrained ?

⌈ I don't ⌉ think I've talked about this .
I had the idea that xxx that maybe I didn't .
you're saying that Atwood is a ⌊ appealing ⌋ .

⌈ so you ⌉ think Atwood's satire is actually more superficial than than Twain's .
no both their they're both for the sake of popularity I think they made +//.
didn't make +//.
even though they both opposed Christianity they don't make a direct attack on it I guess .
okay .
+, they leave it to you know Sunday Christians and &~d &-um .
okay <for the sake of> &-um for the sake of moderation &-uh nonoffensive ?
I don't think that's a word .
&=laughs:multiple .
right I don't think so either .
I couldn't think of a better one though .
well you can say inoffensive but I think you just mean isn't offensive right ?
yeah .
&=laughs .
that still isn't offensive to a large Christian audience +...
&=laughs yeah .
nonoffensive as a verb is or as an adjective is strange because I mean you can think of you can imagine being offensive as an act but being nonoffensive as an act ?
it's strange .
how do you not be offensive you know purely ?
okay &-um next one .
&{l=READING whether Atwood is directing her satire towards Christian churches or towards an indifferent Christian America is an issue of concern .
according to Malak one of the novel's successful attempts concerns the skillful portrayal of a state that in theory claims to be founded on Christian principles yet in practice miserably lacks spirituality and benevolence .
this description of Gilead could in fact be a description of our American society but I believe it lacks a certain bit of skillfulness that Malak would like us to believe .
here the satire of Christian fundamentalism isn't necessarily pointed at Christians but at our society and the influence given over to right wing fundamentalists .
but the historical notes at the end of the novel hurt this part of Atwood's satire .
the entire historical notes at the end of the novel represents a satire on critics who spin out theories about literary works or historical texts without genuinely recognizing or experiencing the pathos expressed in them .
they circumvent issues classify data construct clever hypotheses garbed in ritualistic fashionable jargon but no spirited illumination ever comes out_of their endeavors .
this humorous ending of the novel pokes fun at scholarly critics who take an unemotional viewpoint over a situation and end up missing much of the significance of the scenario .
this fits in with the story perfectly in Gilead's view of Biblical history .
nobody in the novel demonstrates a spirituality the society would want you to have and nobody really buys into the system .
the sexual ceremony performed with the handmaid isn't enjoyed by anyone and yet is supposed to be a very spiritual event .
there is absolutely no spirited illumination of Christianity in Gilead .
&}l=READING (0.20) .
mm can you say something about it Amy ?
well it's the wrong whether the first &~senten +/.
⌊ uhuh ⌋ +/.

&=laughs we grab the easy stuff quick .

⌈ oops ⌉ &=laughs .
Chris coulda done that on his own .
yeah &=laughs .
one thing like the about the historical notes at the end of the novel at this part and then it says the entire historical notes at the end of the novel is that bad that it just like kinda repeats itself a little like that ?
what ?
what's that ?
like where it says but the historical notes at the end of the novel and then it says the entire historical notes at the end of the novel like you know that one part sort of <in quotes> ?
or could you just have the first part different so it doesn't just +/.
hm .
⌊ yeah okay ⌋ +/.

and is this is the &~descrip this description of Gilead could in fact be a description of our American society but I yadda@i yadda@i yadda@i is that a run+on sentence sort_of ?
where are you ?
or no ?
right after the first &-um block quote or .
this description of Gilead .
or is there does there need to be a comma there ?
this description of Gilead could in fact be a description ?
doesn't there not need to be a comma after Gilead ?
no comma .
right .
and after here in the next sentence shouldn't there be a comma ?
after here +..?
oh .
&-um your choice +...
when he said he believes that it lacks a certain bit of skillfulness .
yeah what does that ⌊ mean ⌋ ?
⌈ &-um ⌉ I think ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ that's ⌉ &-uh the next paragraph is all about that actually .
who lacks the skillfulness ?
what ⌊ does ⌋ ?
⌈ Malak ⌉ .
&-um or maybe she does no she does yeah .
his &-uh claim that in his quote it says it's a &~skillfu skillful portrayal and I'm saying it's not so true in ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ oh I see ⌉ +...
oh okay &-um the wording is off then right ?
just say but it isn't as skillful quote put that in quotes as &~Ma as Malak takes it as Malak sees it +...
okay ?
is that what you were gonna say Leslie ?
yeah sort_of .
&=laughs .
&-um so you're &~d you're disagreeing with Malak on that point and you're going on to disagree with him about what he says about the historical notes too ?
&~j I'll just tell you what I mean (be)cause in <the next> &~par the next paragraph talks about &-um her &-uh satire here is that the historians are looking at the situation in a very unemotional unrelated way +/.
mhm +/.
+, and in the same way her book the people of Gilead are looking at the Bible in this very unemotional way &-um and &~Chri well Christianity as a whole in a very unemotional way and they're not drawing into the reasons for the rituals and stuff and ⌊ <it would> ⌋ .
⌈ what do you mean ⌉ that Atwood is doing that ?
well that's what I said and then seeing as that &~At Atwood's satire is on Christianity that is describing her view of how a like an +//.
I don't know I don't think I can explain it .
&=laughs:multiple that that since since that's her satire that portrays her view as_well_as of what .
Atwood is satirizing &-uh a hypocritical interpretation of the Bible right for the purposes of establishing a theocracy that is really just about power .
okay ?
so if she's satirizing that then &~y you imagine that she is for the kind of spiritual reading of the Bible that you're you're saying &~bl is missing in Gilead right ?
I suppose &=beeper_goes_off but that's what I thought at first but I don't I'm a little shaky &=laughs on this .
sorry ⌊ <that was me> ⌋ &=laughs .
⌈ yeah ⌉ it's this paragraph ⌊ is a little shaky ⌋ .
⌈ but but I don't think ⌉ she is though .
I think that her it could be interpreted that way but I don't think that's the way she &-uh .
I could make a lifeline joke but I'll pass .
&=laughs:multiple .
&=singing <do do> do do do do .
are &~y are you saying that Offred are you saying the Atwood is satirizing spirituality or an unspiritual hypocritical way of interpreting the Bible ?
&-um I'm saying kinda both .
both ?
&=laughs:multiple how's she doing both ?
+, okay &-um you lost me a little bit here I I've lost the vein of things .
seem to lose it myself .
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
⌈ let's ⌉ let's read on for a minute .
yeah ⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ to the next ⌉ paragraph .
&=laughs this'll this'll help .
I have faith in Chris .
who is that Jenny ?
me +/.
+, ah Chrissy .
alright &{l=READING in a sense Atwood is trying to express what has become of Christianity in America but at the same time her disapproval of Christian rituals and dogmas is then hypocritical .
if Atwood is indeed criticizing the Christian church for its practices she is failing to recognize or experience the pathos of these rituals .
what may seem to be ruthlessly tyrannical may actually be rooted in spirituality and deep emotion .
oh +/.
+, &{l=READING Atwood is ignoring the importance that Christianity and all its rituals have on its followers .
even today Christians are subjecting themselves to persecution in an attempt to serve God .
this kind of sacrifice isn't made out_of necessity but <out_of> out_of a love for Jesus Christ .
Atwood chooses to completely ignore this type of Christian in the state of Gilead .
in the novel in a novel depicting the dangers of Christian &~fun fundamentalists Jesus &}l=READING .
&~funda fundamentalism .
yeah .
&{l=READING Jesus is never mentioned .
her choice to ignore this side of Christianity may be justified if it is her &~attem intent to show that this type of Christian is far too rare in our society .
but I doubt that this was her intent and her reasons for overlooking this was only to make a stronger point of the dangers of &~dog dogmas .
&}l=READING .
I think that's pretty clear .
okay .
&-um can you fault her for this ?
can Atwood be faulted for not considering &-um Christians who are subjecting themselves to persecution in an attempt to serve God ?
I thought about that too and &~i I guess it go +//.
in &-uh I think Malak's because he talks about how like Gilead is fictional in certain ways and how it's okay to be fictional that and if you had these kind of Christians it would kinda ruin the .
the whole point of it .
yeah it would ruin ⌊ the point of the novel ⌋ .
⌈ yeah it would ⌉ it would water down the satire a bit .
okay ?
&-um I don't know .
I I don't wanna say that your your concern here is &-um irrelevant to the discussion but you know if Atwood is trying to write about a society that is the logical consequence of some fundamentalist thought that she saw &-um being prevalent in &~th in the eighties right then the novel that she writes is a +//.
is going to be such or the world that she writes about is going to be such so that those elements are exaggerated to a very grotesque point .
right ?
if she'd then insert some sort of qualifying idea about how but in other &~s instances you know this sort_of fundamentalism is okay or is in service of Christian beliefs right ?
let's say we have in this novel &~jus juxtaposing Gilead you know a second theocracy that was doing pretty well you know ?
&-um I don't know I feel like <it would> it would kinda cheat the &~s the strength of the satire .
okay ?
so unless you mean something like well actually within this novel we see instances of real service or you know &-um persecution that should be borne right ?
unless you mean that &-uh I don't know I I don't quite I don't quite follow why you are objecting the way you are .
well in the there's no +//.
in Gilead there's no one who actually none of the characters actually believe in what's +//.

I think the reason why this particular paragraph to me well if you probably in this essay address the other people too and could show how you could make a strong argument talking about the people who do use the Old Testament and the people who don't then maybe it would be easier to prove that +/.

I think &~y to make a strong argument you'd hafta also be able to talk about the people who do what she says is going on .

&=laughs:multiple .
okay +...
are we still talking about this xxx &=laughs .
yeah we've still got &=laughs:multiple we got we guess we still got two more pages .
oh .
&-uh we up to Amy did you go ?
yeah I went .
okay .
Chris why don't you go ahead .
no reason why you shouldn't examine your own paper .
&{l=READING the great irony of Atwood's feministic tale is that the &~proa the protagonist Alfred Offred has all the characteristics of a godly Christian woman .
she is independent enough to have a mind her of her own but never strong enough to act on her own will without the aid or suggestion of someone else .
Atwood provides us with two women who fit into very who fit into very stereotypical &~categor categories of opposites .
Moira is an example of a woman who demonstrates all the qualities men should have .
she's a strong independent woman who can never happily submit herself to a man and therefore is out_of place in Christian society .
she could be labelled as the man hating lesbian who has no femininity whatsoever .
&}l=READING &=laughs:multiple &{l=READING Janine on the other hand is an example of a woman far on the other end of the spectrum who shows very little independence and strength .
other women don't like her because of the way she submits herself but at the same time they feel sympathy towards the mistreatment she gets led into .
&}l=READING .
LED .
yeah &-um &{l=READING this kind this is the kind &}l=READING caught that &=laughs:multiple &{l=READING of woman you'd expect to cling to abusive relationships because of her natural inclination to be passive and yield too much power &}l=READING .
it's it's surprisingly appropriate &=laughs:multiple .
&{l=READING this is the kink &}l=READING &=laughs:multiple .
&=laughs &-um &{l=READING Offred fits in the middle of these two women and demonstrates the perfect balance of what &}l=READING .
you see what I mean ?
&=laughs .
yeah I saw it .
&=laughs .
sorry sorry &=laughs:multiple okay .
&{l=READING Offred &~i &-uh fits in the middle of these two women and demonstrates the perfect balance of what the Christian woman should be .
for a protagonist in a feminist novel Offred is &~surpass surprisingly &}l=READING surpassingly I think it should be surprisingly +/.
mhm +/.
+, &{l=READING much more of a traditional woman and less independent than one would ever expect .
much like a &~l a left wing conservative Atwood appears to be trying to show a more conservative view of her feministic ideas .
&}l=READING .
what do you think of that ?
where it says &-um &{l=READING they feel sympathy towards the mistreatment she gets led into &}l=READING they don't feel sympathy towards mistreatment they feel sympathy ⌊ towards her right ⌋ ?
⌈ <where are you> where are you now ⌉ ?
&-um in like probably like +/.
oh +/.
+, almost halfway .
right above the kink &=laughs:multiple .
yeah right above the kink it says &{l=READING feel sympathy towards the mistreatment &}l=READING they wouldn't really feel sympathy towards mistreatment they'd feel sympathy towards her right ?
&{l=READING the women don't like her because of the way she submits herself +...
but at the same time they feel sympathy towards the mistreatment she gets led into .
&}l=READING what do you object to ?
just how do you feel sympathy towards mistreatment like mistreatment isn't the thing they feel sympathy towards don't they feel sympathy towards her Janine ?
oh .
xxx because of the mistreatment <she gets> she gets led into ?
yeah .
thank you .
right +...
okay so <we have> we have Offred +...
and you say that she has characteristics of a godly Christian woman she is independent enough but never strong enough to act on her own will without the aid or suggestion of someone else .
is that a characteristic of a Christian woman ?
is that an ideal ?
I don't I'm trying to say that she's not &-um +...
I think some of +//.
I don't know if it's worded <right or> .
yeah the maybe the wording is &-um +...
yeah it's it's misleading .
I see what you're +//.
you're saying that she's not passive but she's not mm .
she's not a leader .
well you're saying ⌊ more than that she's not a leader ⌋ .
⌈ well he's saying that she thinks independently ⌉ but she doesn't act independently .
right ?
it says &{l=READING mind of her own but never strong enough to act without the aid or suggestion of someone else &}l=READING so I mean she's thinking things she just never acts on it really .
and that's a Christian ideal ?
I don't know &=laughs .
is this like a according to you or according to ⌊ the novel ⌋ .
⌈ Christian ideals ⌉ .
&=laughs .
I think if you're gonna characterize Offred that way &-um it's going to be hard to call her an ideal Christian woman .
right ?
if you're saying that she has all these thoughts and we know that she has all these thoughts about escaping and whatever but then you say that because she doesn't act out on those thoughts &~sh that makes her that makes her Christian ?
it doesn't make her Christian but for like &-um for it's a feminist novel and you you would expect that the main character would be much more independent than +/.
right uhuh .
oh okay right +/.
+, than Offred actually is .
and she's more .
and instead of being like this equal person who you know should get treated equally she wants to be or I don't know if she wants to be but she's more she's less .
she's more of a a woman described like a Christian .
I don't know .
I wanna say like a woman who's submits to her husband or something .
she's more of that than +/.
+, ⌊ meek ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ she is ⌉ of a feminist .
right .
(0.5) &-um yeah fix the wording on that second sentence okay ?
you're saying that on the one hand you're saying that it's ironic that Atwood would write a feminist satire that stars a character who is not &-uh feminist in the way that say &~Janin &-uh Moira is .
okay ?
but on the other hand she's not &-uh passive to the point that Janine is .
okay ?
so what are you saying ?
what is Offred then ?
I think she's saying that &~Off like that's she fits into +...
I guess it goes on with this thought too that the Bible describes it doesn't give a description of &~ma &~mi &~mu women being equal but &-um different in where the male is the leader and the woman is like &-um like that a &~w I don't know I just thought the next paragraph kind of explains it &=laughs:multiple ⌊ <I'm like a Nazi> ⌋ .
⌈ I guess I think that she's like ⌉ more refined than the other two women like .
refined ?
refined +/.
+, ⌈ as in like being a Christian ⌉ because like &-um one is like totally like emotional .
and like you know let's like like she completely gives in .
you know and then like the other one is like totally strong .
and you know but Offred is like she's more like what a Christian woman should be because she's not like you know too extreme or too evil .
&~sh no she's more sort_of refined .
she has more of a balance like she doesn't speak out or ⌊ you know do extreme ⌋ .
⌈ it's like she acts ⌉ appropriately .
right exactly like maybe she's not &~ex like what a Christian woman should be but more so like the ideal of what a Christian woman should be .
do you know &=laughs ⌊ maybe that was ⌋ .
⌈ <they face> xxx ⌉ .
⌊ <what are you> saying ⌋ ?
I don't know like she's like when people look at her you know her actions show someone who's what a Christian woman should be .
but don't they want +/.
⌈ yeah I'm saying ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ everyone to sort_of ⌋ act like Janine ?
I'm saying the Bible +//.
well the Bible doesn't say like men should be this way and women should be this way it kinda is like I say this later that &-um it's saying God created man this way and women created women this way &=laughs:multiple God created women &~i &~G God created men and women in a certain way ⌈ and ⌉ .
⌊ when you say ⌋ like she's a godly woman are you saying according to what you believe or according to what the novel is saying ?
like that's what I am confused about .
because yeah like according to the novel like she wouldn't be you know she doesn't completely submit to this idea .
I think ⌈ that Chris &~thinks ⌉ .
⌊ I saying I'm ⌋ saying how there's a &~net like a +//.
like the Bible says a way that like the &~wo you know women are this way and men are this way and that's the way not the way that they are you know .
the Bible tells (th)em to be but that's the way God created (th)em to be .
and so it's kind_of a it's kinda ironic because it's like a natural thing .
xxx never mind but anyway &=laughs and so that's like the Bible's naturalistic view of how men and women are .
and I'm saying &~y normally feminists would take offense to that I guess and claim that there &~sh should be more equality than the Bible says .
and Atwood isn't is isn't saying that .
I <I see what you're> I see what you're getting at but we're continuing the same problem of your paper &-uh going down a related but &-um .
well <I thought this> I thought this actually was +/.
⌈ but wrong path ⌉ .
+, ⌊ more relevant ⌋ .
huh ?
&=laughs:multiple .
I thought this was a relevant path .
⌈ well ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I mean I ⌋ &~c (be)cause the paper is like is is she a heroine ?
yeah you you are getting to that .
right ?
but you're answering it you know your criteria for heroism &-um is leading this discussion in a way that mm it's taking you further and further away from Foucault I'd say .
okay ?
yeah .
+, like <I liked> &~th I liked that you're comparing Offred to Moira and Janine because I think the three of (th)em can be compared in that way that you were doing here in the way that you are comparing them here .
okay ?
&-uh but instead of talking about that difference being godly or ungodly okay &-uh what about if you talked about them in terms of kind_of proper citizens of a panoptic society ?
would you say that Janine is a better citizen in that respect than Moira ?
yeah .
why ?
because she's not trying to fight &-um she's not opposing the power .
what is the what is the goal ?
what is the dream of a panoptic hierarchy ?
it's to have discipline over the people .
uhuh &=laughs:S4 .
⌈ Moira's not disciplined ⌉ .
⌊ well Janine doesn't hafta be ⌋ watched as like the ideal panoptic citizen doesn't hafta be watched +/.
right +/.
+, because they have this fear .
Moira always hasta be watched &=laughs because she doesn't fear the +/.
+, right .
+, you know the watchfulness of everybody else .
that's it .
right ?
on one on in one sense she &~doesn Janine doesn't hafta be watched at all okay because she's always being watched inside .
&-um Moira right Moira is the opposite +...
&-um I think you're going +//.
&~y you might wanna you might wanna talk about this difference in that way just so you're starting to to tip this discussion back toward where we want it .
mkay ?
&-um you can do this you can talk about +//.
if you can carry up until this point <in the> in the essay &-um both your point that this is a panoptic society and that panoptic societies are easily translatable into Christian societies then talking about Christianity here and how Offred is God godly and others aren't would make sense still right ?
it &~i you still wouldn't be outside of the realm of discussion that I want you to be in .
okay ?
but if you're not if you're gonna lose Foucault all the way like completely &-um then it needs to be corrected .
okay ?
and <I think you> &~sh I think you should carry up until this point your your thesis that &-um that faith in Christianity is like the faith of a panoptic &-uh system the faith of the faith in the panoptic power +...
right ?
both higher powers both both are higher powers both involve &-uh a certain giving up of yourself right ?
both involve faith both involve higher purpose right .
other notes about this paragraph +..?
next one Cliff ?
alright +...
&{l=READING the Bible gives a view of marriage as one where the man is the leader and the woman is submissive to the man .
this idea isn't just believed to be the will of God but it is also the believed to be the way of God created &~crea &~w the way God created man and woman for each_other .
Offred and her relationships support this idea with men .
even though there is a weight weighted balance of power between men and women in Gilead Offred demonstrates the need for more power but not a need to be equal from the standpoint of most feminists .
even after she shows disgust for the Commander she still aims to satisfy Fred and make him happy .
this idea of a woman's desire to meet the needs of &~m of a man is very Biblical and believed to be the way God created &-uh women to be .
although Nick and Offred's relationship is fabricated it is not very stereotypically natural .
one word +/.
+, yep .
&-um &{l=READING at first their attraction is completely physical and Offred admires the healthy &~b brawn of Nick .
but as their relationship progresses Nick is the source of a feeling of safety and trust for Offred .
ironically he is neither safe nor powerful but she seeks to provide him these things .
their relationship is not at all an equal one but a natural one that fits the description of how God created man and woman even though there is nothing natural about it at all .
&}l=READING .
when you say natural do you mean the same thing as as Christian ?
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you're ⌋ saying that how Offred relates to the &~f Commander is a stereotypically Christian &-um way that is of a submissive woman who serves her man ?
+, yeah .
+, but you're also saying that the way she relates to Nick is Christian ?
yeah .
how so ?
&-um well he's a stereotypical like &-um +...
savior ?
yeah I guess well because she finds safety in him and that's a Christian thing that men provide safety for women .
I don't think there's overlooking the fact that there's animal lust involved &=laughs:S4 between Nick and Offred .
okay +/.
+, and unless I missed a really important day at Sunday school animal lust &=laughs:multiple is not a Christian ideal .
&-um .
xxx .
maybe you're you're looking ⌈ at a difference here ⌉ .
⌊ maybe it's well in this ⌋ +...
ah well ⌈ I kinda see what you're saying yeah ⌉ &=laughs .
⌊ not a similarity ⌋ &=laughs .
I mean the the way you say animal lust but it is like the whole thing with like Moira being gay is kind_of interesting I think like (be)cause it's not (be)cause she's totally throwing away these ideas that women should do +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ this ⌋ and women should like men and +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, I don't know .
hm right so for Moira there is no yeah right .
<do you> do you remember how Moira fails to enlist the cooperation of men ?
okay ?
there is a certain suggestion about &-uh Moira that because she is not attracted to men she doesn't have an avenue for deliverance the way Offred does .
right ?
she can't be saved by men the way Offred can be saved <by men> .
I like that and I like the stuff about Nick and her relationship to Nick versus her relationship to the Commander because you can do a good comparison of &-um you can do a &~com good comparison between what you say here and what Hammer says of that love triangle .
okay ?
but right now I think you're really starting to see that the discussion is it has strayed &-um from points that it &~w that we wanted to cross .
right ?
and now we're talking almost purely about you know Christian faith and and Christian ideals .
&-um did you notice do you notice that when you read aloud sentences you can catch the awkwardness &-um more easily than you could just reading it silently ?
right ?
&{l=READING this idea of a woman's desire to meet the needs of a man is very Biblical and believed to be the way God created women to be .
&}l=READING right &-um yeah there's something singsongy and kinda limerickish about that that &-um probably should be corrected .
&{l=READING Offred and her relationships support this idea with men ?
&}l=READING alright that's that's inexact .
support this idea with men .
okay ?
support with men is is a strange thought a strange way of thinking .
&-um fiddle with that sentence until you get that right .
next one ?
&{l=READING Handmaids is a &~sa satire depicting how valid a source of power can be turned and used for &~irres &~irre irresponsible behavior .
the source of power is Bible .
Gilead use the Bible as justification for its structure and behavior .
rather than a society that is submissive to the teaching of the Bible it is clear that the Bible is only used to back up idea that ideas that were already formed .
normally people don't submit themselves to a panoptical lifestyle unless there is a strong reason to it .
everyone &~i in Gilead has been tricked into living this way through gradual individual change that were all justified through the Bible in hopes of forming a better society .
&}l=READING (0.6) .
what do you think ?
(0.7) I think that's true enough what you're saying here but it's a strange place <in the> in the essay to have it .
right ?
it it seems like a some sort of &~sum summary paragraph .
&-um that maybe can occur like at the very end or something ?
okay but like you +//.
before this you were right in the middle of of details and now you're kind of out_of that .
&-um so I would think about the placement of that paragraph .
(0.10) otherwise ?
I like the paragraph xxx .
pretty straightforward ?
mhm +/.
+, okay .
alright you got an easy one Seungchan .
&=laughs go on finish up .
&-uh finish us off why don't you Kelly ?
&{l=READING the Enlightenment which discovered the liberties also invented the disciplines .
the society of Gilead has become so enlightened that it has learned how to hold massive discipline over the citizens a task that appears to be more difficult to our society than dangerous .
ironically Gilead's enlightened social structure is very degenerating to the citizens .
all individuality is lost and none of the characters in the novel even those at the higher end of the system seem to enjoy their lives .
Malak calls this a dystopian world since nobody really seems to be better off in it .
&}l=READING do you want me to read the next one ?
&-uh let's do this one first +...
what are you doing <with the> with the quotation marks there what's that about ?
&-um .
oh I see ⌈ okay I see ⌉ .
⌊ inside ⌋ well &~qu I quoted and in the quote there's the quotations &-uh ⌈ over xxx ⌉ .
⌊ yeah &-uh ⌋ if you do that then Enlightenment should be in single quotes .
yeah okay +/.
+, okay ?
and the closed quotes should go before Foucault thirty thirty seven right ?
yeah .
and then that one should be never mind .
what ?
I was gonna say ⌈ it should be footnoted but ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ is that explained in the ⌋ next paragraph ?
no no no &=laughs:multiple .
oh .
what were you gonna say ?
&-um never &~min I was just thinking that that could be footnoted but I +/.
ah +/.
+, I had Foucault earlier ⌈ so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ right .
+, but .
yeah I'm kinda xxx this is ideas I never expanded .
&=laughs and like the yeah the paper doesn't <mention it> if you're looking for <more of (th)em> on the next page .
the paper is doing what drafts normally do towards the end okay ?
it kind of it's it's picking up loose stuff that you forgot about during the discussion or the rest of your notes and kind of putting them together in like a scramble paragraph .
okay ?
it's &-uh right it's it's stir+fry it's you know leftover delights &=laughs okay .
&-um right so you you'll see that the last three paragraphs are not continuing any single thought it's it's not furthering &-um a strong argument .
okay ?
this is typical of the ends of drafts .
typical of &-uh of the ends of of papers too you guys .
&-um papers that haven't gone through enough drafts usually .
okay ?
mm anything specific you wanna say about this Kelly ?
&-um massive discipline does that make sense ?
massive discipline .
I don't know how discipline could be massive xxx .
yeah you're right .
and &-uh ⌈ after it says ⌉ .
⌊ right ⌋ .
discipline isn't isn't strong isn't big or small it's +/.
yeah .
+, strong or weak .
&-um it says &{l=READING Gilead's enlightened social structure is very degenerating to the citizens &}l=READING +/.
yeah +/.
+, should it be like degenerative ?
or +/.
+, right or +/.
+, xxx .
yeah .
I liked the idea that even those at the higher end of the system don't seem to enjoy their lives .
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that ⌋ because I think like with the higher power would come happiness and I think that's really apparent also with Serena Joy like and the Commander both +/.
+, yeah .
+, if that can be .
right .
it's <it's telling> it's telling that at at +//.
the higher up the the power system you go &-um the more violations that you have right ?
the Commander is you know is lustful is you know all these things that a Christian shouldn't be even in Gilead .
&-um right but he's he's still not happy .
I don't know if he's unhappy the way the same way that the Handmaids are unhappy but yeah nobody's really happy here +...
degenerating to the citizens is a weird way of saying something .
right &~d degenerate you don't degenerate to right ?
the thing itself degenerates but you don't degenerate to anything .
or you can degenerate into something else but you know it's it's not a it's not an affecting &-uh action .
