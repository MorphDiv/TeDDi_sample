an officer was on his beat .
and he saw a man standing in the doorway of a store .
he was checking doors to see if anybody had broken in .
but when he got to this man he asked him what he was doing there .
he told the man, told him that he was waiting on a friend .
and after they got in a conversation for a while .
and then the officer decided to leave .
and told him that he hoped the friend would come .
and the office had seen who he was .
and &-uh he decided to play his game .
and go on about his business .
and tell another officer to come .
and that he was a suspect .
so when the other officer got there he told him .
this man knew that he was wanted .
so what happened was, he was a friend when they left .
and he was a friend when he come back because he couldn't lock him
so he let somebody else do it .
and what he left him a note .
and let him know that he was there on time when he supposed to come
but he found out that you can't change a person .
a person will grow .
but you can't change his looks .
and he knew his looks .
and he couldn't arrest him .
so he let the other officer come .
and arrest him .
you know it's like two brothers .
like a friend .
if you're a friend to a person you're a friend all the way .
not half way a friend .
and he was for right .
and not for wrong .
and regardless of whether you're my friend or not .
if you're wrong you're wrong .
so he decided that rather than to confront him with this he wrote
and let him know that he knew who he was .
and what he had done .
my great grandmother raised me .
she was a slave .
and you know how the older people did everything for the children .
so she decided that she would pierce my ears .
and there were two other ladies that wanted their ears pierced too
so my grandmother said, well, she was going to pierce mine first
so she sit there .
and she pierced my ears .
I sit down .
and she just talked to me .
and she pierced my ears .
so then after she finished she wanted to pierce the other lady's
so the other lady, Suzy, said +"/.
+" oh, I don't think .
+" oh no, I don't think I can take that .
+" no, oh no .
so she said +"/.
+" see how she did it ?
+" it didn't hurt her .
+" so come on .
+" let's do it .
so the lady sat down .
and I remember so good .
I was just two years old .
she pierced her ears .
so the other lady was named Ebby .
she said +"/.
+" well okay, it's your time .
that lady took off down the street .
she run .
and we ran to get her, me and my brother .
+" come on, Ebby .
+" come on, Ebby .
so we talk .
and talk .
and talk .
and talk .
and so finally got her back up there where my grandmother could get
and sit her on the chair .
oh, she carried on .
and I thought it was the funniest thing because by me being little
I remember that all these years .
I remember .
how she'd run .
how she's holler when she put the ice on her ears .
and I learned how to pierce a person's ears .
by that when I was two years old .
she had a stopper, a cork stopper .
she took the ice .
and numb the ear .
then after she numb the ear she put the stopper back there .
and she got a needle and thread .
and she stuck it in .
and pulled it through with the stopper .
and to the length that the thread is supposed to be .
and she cut it off .
and then she greased it with vaseline .
