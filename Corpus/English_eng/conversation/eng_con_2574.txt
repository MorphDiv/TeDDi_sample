okay +... 43225_43405
let's get started . 45765_47005
quiet please . 47425_48025
(0.9) the topic of today's lecture is economics . 56085_58685
&-um and there's a whole subdiscipline of anthropology devoted to the study of economic systems around the world and that is called not surprisingly economic anthropology . 59085_67825
so today's an &~ec &-uh an introduction to some of the main issues . 68535_72235
as they've been laid out in your text and there's a_lot_of information there so I'm gonna walk you through it . 72995_77215
make sure that we get the main points . 78015_79635
economic anthropology is defined in the text &-um as the part of the discipline that debates issues of human nature that relate directly to the decisions of daily life and making a living . 80355_92855
this idea of making a living will come up again and again today . 93395_96275
and &-um we'll think about what that means to make a living +... 96735_99855
when we say make a living we're generally talking about what it requires for us to &~obt you know get our subsistence needs taken care of . 100275_111595
subsistence being your basic needs clothing food shelter and so anthropologists use the phrase subsistence strategies for talking about the different ways humans have come up with &~m terms of how to acquire those things that they need that we need . 111905_130365
so different subsistence strategies have already been introduced to you . 131665_134845
we've seen a film and we've we've read a_lot about foraging bands bands being the tribe the social organization form foraging &~mean being the actual economic activity going on . 135125_145405
we've also had some introduction to agriculture remember the slides that Professor Kottak showed us from Madagascar . 146405_154125
and how rice agriculture uses &-um a form of technology called terracing . 154685_159125
so agriculture is another means of acquiring subsistence needs . 159815_163695
another one would be pastoralism . 164995_166415
we'll talk about that more today in depth . 166955_168635
last week we also heard about the Masai group in East Africa . 169595_172975
and many of you have probably seen Masai in ads in commercials . 173515_177195
there was a famous Olympics ad that +//. 177875_179275
and some Nike commercials that showed Masai . 179835_181535
&-um and Masai are nomadic herders . 182175_185855
pastoralism requires taking care of domesticated animals . 186315_189935
and there can be different varieties of that . 191035_192635
you can take care of camels you can take care of cattle you can take care of sheep goats any of a variety of things +... 192895_198275
so starting &~i and then another mode that +//. 201215_203335
one that we live in is industrialism and I'll talk more about that on Thursday . 203635_207475
so those +//. 208155_209315
that's one of the ways in which we acquire our subsistence needs . 209595_211895
so let's start briefly by going over the three that I mentioned &-um three of the four . 212745_218505
foraging as we talked about already this is primarily hunting and gathering acquiring your needs pretty directly from nature . 218685_226685
so going out finding the food you need hunting it gathering it and the people in Australia that we we saw they are an example of that people in Southern Africa people in in the rain forests of Congo the Democratic Republic of Congo in Central Africa these are areas of the world where you find foraging still in existence . 227465_248085
however due to vast changes that have gone on in our world it's very untenable these days to pursue an exclusively foraging subsistence strategy . 248755_260035
so most foragers now in some way or another are involved either in food production or trade in_order_to acquire things that they need . 260835_269115
and the reasons for that oftentimes are that governments are instituting policies that restrict the movement of foragers . 269635_276495
if you think about it from a government's perspective it's very hard for you to have communities within your boundaries that wanna move all the time and move and have access to all sorts of land . 277145_287685
and when you have increasing population pressures and this and that governments find this very problematic . 288785_294405
and so they institute land policies that restrict that create reservations that restrict the movement of indigenous groups that would like to use foraging as their main mode of subsistence . 295205_304865
so because of some of these pressures from government policy and increasing encroachment on their land by other agriculturalists and people next to them we find that foragers cannot be exclusively reliant on foraging . 307305_321285
very few today . 321845_322725
in the book foragers are also mentioned by by reference to a very famous anthropologist named Marshall Sahlins . 323445_331725
Marshall Sahlins has written a_lot about economic anthropology and he sort_of debunked the idea that foragers are the poorest of the poor that no one would dare want to be a forager because you're &~sc constantly scrounging about trying to get the basics that you need . 332395_347875
and drawing on the data that &-um Richard Lee starts out with in that chapter for the reading for today Richard Lee shows just how much food is actually acquired in a very short period of time . 348855_361335
and so that in fact by their own standards a_lot_of foraging communities at the time that Richard Lee was doing this research mind you in the nineteen sixties that they were extremely affluent because they had more than what they needed and more than what they wanted . 362015_375015
therefore Marshall Sahlins took this to understand that they are the original affluent society because they have everything they need in abundance . 375715_384515
so that we should not look down on them as as being so wholly different and so wholly impoverished in relation to the capitalist very wealthy West +... 385615_393755
agriculture is a widespread subsistence strategy that we have in our society as well . 394555_403295
&-um you could no one +//. 404145_405805
<I should> I should emphasize that you can have multiple subsistence strategies within a society . 406865_411325
&-um one might be more dominant than the others and it's generally the case but you can have more than one in one community . 412005_418505
so as I just said the foragers are now mixing foraging hunting and gathering with some basic food production sometimes and to trade . 418785_426705
so as so in our society we can get &-um a bunch of different strategies together . 427185_431365
so agriculture is one . 431865_432865
we can have very different approaches to agriculture +... 432965_435285
one type of agriculture sometimes called horticulture is known as shifting cultivation that means that you have a community that will will &-um farm some land for a period of time . 439245_452485
but after time the soil becomes depleted of whatever it is of the resources needed nutrients needed for that particular crop . 453005_459625
so what will happen is that after a period of time people will leave that plot alone and move on and start another plot with the same crop . 460105_468545
and then they they're just &~shi moving around shifting cultivation . 469005_471445
these are called swiddens because you burn the ground to create a clearing that is used temporarily for agricultural purposes . 471685_478965
now that's different from intensive agriculture wherein the same plot of land is used <over and> over and over again . 479765_487245
so we have large scale agriculture here where families have been living on the same farm for for decades and they are and &~th what you have to do in_order_to maintain the the quality of the soil is to use technologies of various kinds to make sure that you're continually rejuvenating the soil . 489105_506205
so fertilizers would be one means . 506845_508425
&-um in Madagascar the rice terraces are ways of creating a continual rich soil with a mix of water and mud . 509305_517185
and so there're different ways in which +//. 518305_519465
also &-um intercropping I think I put that up there intercropping is a strategy used in parts of the world and in parts of Africa where I've worked where <you will> you will plow I mean sorry you will &-um plant different crops within the same field . 519765_532385
so that you might have beans and in between the beans you'll have &~y yams and the reason being is that they would draw different nutrients from the soil when you've got different things so that is a way of maintaining the health of your soil . 533025_544585
so there're different strategies that people have come up with for dealing with intensive permanent agriculture which is different from the shifting cultivation that I described previously . 545045_555045
(0.19) now the third form that I mentioned is pastoralism . 574685_576645
and this &~i &~nu the example I'm gonna draw on today is the Masai speaking Maa speaking communities of East Africa . 577785_585405
the Masai are not the only people who speak the Maa language there are at least four other groups the Samburu the Ariaal the Chamus and the Uparkulu who also speak Maa languages . 585985_597865
and they're slight variants in the dialects of the same language . 598365_601845
but they're mutually intelligible so a Samburu can go to a Masai community and speak with people and be understood and similarly be understood by them . 602625_609685
so the Maa speakers +//. 610865_612285
I mean first of all pastoralism as I said is is having nomadic peoples who move with their animals and are free to follow their animals to better grazing areas or water sources and so they're very mobile like the foragers . 612885_626445
and their whole life is oriented around whatever animal it is that they +//. 628385_632445
or groups of animals that they take care of . 632865_635225
so animal husbandry is what designates pastoralism as a as another subsistence strategy . 635505_641205
so the Maa speakers (0.6) as you can see &-uh this is a map of Kenya and then down below is Tanzania and the Maa are the +//. 642465_658105
the Ariaal you see them in the middle Samburu +... 658505_660365
the Ariaal the Samburu Masai you see Masai come all the way down into Tanzania . 663085_666865
&-um and these are the communities that speak the Maa language . 667745_670765
so it's spread over a wide area . 670985_672365
now as I said you've probably seen pictures of Masai this being one that appears oh can you even see that ? 673525_682285
(0.4) in some local magazines this is current &~i I just took it out about a month ago . 683605_689345
and they &~an the Masai are famous they're sort_of the iconic representative of noble savage . 690045_695045
I'll talk about that in a little bit (0.5) so like foragers pastoralists are under considerable pressures those from governments and from neighboring groups . 695435_711095
because of the the need they have to continually move . 711515_714375
and this is problematic if you're a farmer nearby and you don't necessarily want a a group of Masai coming through with their cattle to trample your fields . 714935_721915
you can see how that would create a conflict of interests in terms of how land is &~aprop &-uh used and allocated . 722345_729105
nation+states are also &~cro are concerned with boundaries and who are their citizens . 729725_736945
so if you have as I showed you on the map the Maa the &~Maasa Masai straddle they are found both in Kenya and Tanzania . 737545_744085
when the nation+state boundaries were determined no one paid any mind to who lives where . 744565_748785
and so the boundary cut through Masai territory . 749385_752325
as a result you have Masai &~i in Kenya and in Tanzania who consider themselves part of the same group and they feel that they ought to have the right to go back and forth as they always have for for <years and> years and years . 753145_763505
and so the creation of this essentially in their minds artificial boundary that they hafta have a paper in_order_to cross is another conflict of interest between state and Masai groups . 764205_775365
so policing their boundaries these are some of the pressures that they face today . 776225_779965
another pressure is the creation of national parks . 781165_783725
I would venture to say that there are two images that are dominant in our media about Africa and one is of starving malnourished war ridden human communities very negative portrayals of humans . 785085_798085
we're seeing a_lot_of that in terms of the Mozambique crisis . 798565_800625
it's true but it's just the dominance of it in the media . 801225_803225
and secondly beautiful positive images of animals so that you wanna go on safari and this and that . 803745_810225
so you have the two images that come out in &~Af of Africa . 810325_812365
&-um so the creation of national parks to feed this Western desire to be able to go to beautiful places and see animals like giraffes and lions in their natural habitat is something else that is a relatively recent development . 813685_828525
and that has also entailed another pressure placed on the Masai communities because that's exactly where they live . 828835_834315
and so when governments go in they wanna cordon off an area and say this is only for the use exclusive use of tourists . 835175_841735
then of_course that eats away again at traditional grazing areas that the Masai have always used . 842495_847475
so that's yet another pressure . 847955_849615
a third is the creation of commercial ranches . 850275_852215
the government has decided that there is indeed profit to be had from raising cattle . 853555_858995
and so +//. 859855_860195
but the problem is the Masai don't necessarily want to do all the things that the government wants (th)em to do . 861035_865795
so all the sort_of the medicines that the government would have you give to your cattle to ensure whatever you know good growth and quality of beef . 866095_876355
these are not things that Masai are totally interested in in terms of technological &-um investment <in their> in their cattle . 876625_882885
they have different ideas that have worked for them for centuries on how to raise cattle . 883045_886725
so they don't necessarily want these &~in these &-uh &-um sort_of &-uh problems from the government as they see them . 887265_892385
so commercial ranches so now the government has decided to &-uh &-um create an environment where people are invited to invest and create big large scale ranches for the keeping of &~cow cattle and that that will follow the government's guidelines in terms of vaccinations and this and that and the other . 893785_911325
&-um so again now you have commercial ranches competing for the same land that the Masai have always used . 912385_917865
and then finally large scale agriculture . 918525_920885
there are new &-um new developments in terms of the creation of large scale wheat farms and coffee plantations and all sorts of things that again are another threat to Masai grazing areas . 922115_935155
so between all of this the Masai are having a difficult time trying to be able to maintain their pastoral way of life because there's always encroachment on the land that they need to follow their cattle around . 935615_945955
and mind you Africa is a very difficult environment to live in . 946075_949295
I'm gonna show you some pictures of it . 949305_950585
but it's very arid this area of Kenya that was on the map . 950925_954825
very arid and dry and there's a rainy season and a dry season . 955285_959345
so you have to move in accordance with the seasons . 959725_961825
when it's the dry season you have to go to the few areas that you know of where there's a constant supply of water . 962045_966865
and during the rainy season you have more opportunities to go elsewhere and take advantage of different grazing areas . 967705_972685
so because of the environment they hafta have that mobility and that mobility is increasingly infringed upon by these different factors +... 973125_981245
now Masai have also a problem dealing with the &~prob the issue of land because they they don't conceive of land as being owned individually . 985485_995885
so when the government gives plots tracts of land to commercial ranches or to large scale agriculturalists they +//. 996235_1004755
I mean for Masai you can own cattle individually . 1005075_1008195
a person can identify a cow that belongs to him or her . 1008475_1010995
but the idea of land as being owned by a person is is somewhat foreign . 1011475_1015675
and so that's another conflict because they think that how can you own this land ? 1016015_1020755
this is something we've been using for for decades . 1020855_1022675
and who are you to say that we cannot have access to this water hole that we've always taken our cattle to since my grandfather and his grandfather etcetera . 1023115_1030235
so the idea of land as being owned individually is problematic because they don't have land a conception of private ownership of land . 1031015_1038375
they do have it for cattle . 1038935_1039975
it's not that they don't know what private ownership is but they just don't apply that principle to the ownership of land . 1040175_1045935
so they therefore are not totally respectful of the idea of other people owning land . 1046075_1050315
so that's another problem . 1050555_1051695
now Professor Kottak told you that Masai have these named age sets . 1053295_1057295
and they they occur for about a seven year period . 1058115_1061455
just as &-uh the example of graduating class of whatever <you are> you are moving through a four year span of time with your age set . 1061815_1069215
&-uh Masai groups and Samburu and Ariaal and all the neighboring communities that engage in this have seven year span groups . 1069855_1077195
so any boy that is born within the same seven year period of time will be a member of that age set . 1077345_1082625
and will go through circumcision together . 1083085_1084325
so that it's not that they're all age thirteen and they can range from whatever nine to sixteen . 1084505_1090265
and they'll be in an age set and they'll undergo circumcision together . 1090845_1093385
and these are very intense intense groupings sodalities because they live together they they they more than sibling &~rela or as close if not more so than sibling relationships in America . 1095265_1108485
because this is the this is a progression . 1109485_1111905
male age grades begin you begin as a boy and then once you're circumcised you are initiated and you are called a moran@s:fra . 1113225_1122845
the plural form of that is morani@s:fra . 1124345_1127305
okay ?
and so once you become a warrior you are sent out with the cattle . 1127765_1132245
and you live away from your parents and away from the community . 1132345_1135305
and you all live together out in the bush . 1135705_1137745
and you're taking you're following the cattle around while people stay back at home . 1138205_1141745
and so because of that intense isolation &~an &~an and bonding that goes on these people see themselves as creating for the rest of their lives . 1143805_1153165
and they have a name attached to their group . 1154045_1155885
after being a moran@s:fra they then graduate to being a junior elder . 1157105_1161885
at which point they can marry . 1162065_1163245
and then after a period of being a junior elder they then ultimately become a senior elder . 1164645_1168125
so these are the four stages through which the four age grades that &~a any given age set will pass through . 1168525_1175365
women pass through a different set . 1175605_1178785
they start as young girls are then thought of as adolescent girls where they are a marriageable age at which point once they get married then they are married woman and then the the giving of birth catapults them into the most honored esteemed status which is that of mother . 1179385_1195625
and that's the highest status for them . 1196165_1197925
&-um they also thought of as elders but it's not a formalized thing as it is for the men +... 1199265_1204805
&-um (0.5) with all these pressures from government policy etcetera you &~h the same communities in this area are all suffering under the same pressure . 1205865_1223245
so moran@s:fra are a foraging community . 1223345_1225345
Rendille Ariaal Samburu these are all nomadic pastoralists Gabra I think are another foraging community Turkana are also nomads . 1226105_1233905
so all these communities which traditionally have been unfettered in their movements now are having to negotiate all these problems with ranches and government policies etcetera . 1234445_1244045
so because of all these increasing pressures on them from outside external forces it has led to an increase of conflict from within so that they are not competing with each_other for the scarce +//. 1244365_1254405
access to land that's now available . 1255325_1256725
so there's an increased amount of also conflict between these communities . 1257425_1260325
&-um as I said that +//. 1261565_1264065
you often see the Masai used in in advertisements and in Hollywood films and that's because they represent for people the Africa that people think of as lost . 1264585_1274825
(be)cause when you're just getting this barrage of negative negative human misery coming out_of Africa you wanna look to something and cling to something as somehow noble and above all that . 1274985_1285025
&-um somebody just wrote to me yesterday from South Africa about the efforts going on in Mozambique . 1285565_1290505
and for every helicopter that has been sent over as aid to pick up people pluck people from the water and I'm sure you've seen some of the pictures of that . 1291265_1299485
for every helicopter that's there plucking people out_of the water there are two helicopters of journalists . 1300145_1304785
and how many people did any of those helicopters pluck ? 1305345_1307785
not a one . 1308045_1308485
so this this emphasis on past +//. 1309065_1311565
recapturing the misery and capturing +//. 1311865_1313205
and and spreading it around the world is overwhelming . 1314165_1316845
with regard to Africa . 1317125_1317665
so the one sort_of refuge away from that misery is to have a picture something to look up to as noble and honorable . 1318465_1326345
and so but in the process the image gets corrupted somewhat . 1327065_1330985
and so we're gonna see that right now . 1331405_1332845
excuse_me ?
okay .
just to give an example . 1332965_1336365
(0.13) &=movie_clip how many of you saw that movie ? 1412205_1413005
don't see it the rest of the you who haven't it's pretty bad . 1508455_1511215
oh +/.
+, &=laughs:multiple unfortunately though I have to say that I worked on that film so the few lines of Swahili that you heard Michael Douglas attempt to say there was &-uh a result of my my great effort but what can I do ? 1511935_1525295
the man wouldn't learn it .
&-um &=laughs:multiple anyway I have a_lot_of problems with this film for a variety of reasons and it was not presented to me in the manner in which it eventually emerged &-um else I would have not have gotten involved but that that scene is very illuminating of how Hollywood distorts images . 1526785_1545585
and I will get back to economic anthropology . 1546405_1547685
but just but this this ties into our discussion on Thursday too of world systems and and how the rest of it is involved with quote unquote the rest . 1547925_1554605
but that that scene was the first scene where the Samburu and this is the Samburu although the script called for Masai and you heard them afterwards refer to them as Masai they are in fact Samburu . 1556335_1566515
they would take umbrage at the idea that they were being presented as Masai . 1566915_1570375
they weren't they didn't I don't think they've seen the film . 1570635_1572895
&=laughs:multiple but anyway they are Samburu . 1573555_1574655
&=laughs and &-um they were flown in because Hollywood had a contact with Samburu it did not have a contact with &~Sam with the Masai . 1575675_1582555
there was another film called The Air Up There some of you may have seen which had a Samburu community in it and so because they knew these people they said hey . 1582765_1589725
we'll take advantage of them again close enough almost like the Masai . 1590005_1592985
so brought them in and &-um I was asked to talk to Michael Douglas about this scene because he had this vision in his mind of how +//. 1593285_1601125
what he wanted this scene to &~d to be when he arrives it's his arrival scene and it's their arrival scene as well . 1601305_1607045
and so he said to them he said okay look . 1607585_1609405
Carrie I want this thing . 1609885_1610585
I want to say something and then they all call some battle+cry response and then they and they're jump <out_of the> <out_of the grash> out_of the grass . 1610765_1618885
so I'm like well you know &-uh I why don't I talk to them and see if they have such a thing as a quote unquote battle cry ? 1619565_1624645
I mean you could see the &~re the the references to Westerns right ? 1624785_1628205
what was this it's like pow &=laughs:multiple when <when they> when they come up <out_of the> out_of the grass . 1628405_1633445
I mean the some of the cliched lines and stuff I won't go into that . 1633965_1636585
but he wanted them to say he wanted to scream something out and there would be this response and so I talked to them and I said well you guys what what would you say is there such a thing as a call and response thing that might go on here ? 1636285_1649765
and <they thought and> they thought and they thought well what about we are moran@s:fra ? 1650445_1653825
we are moran@s:fra what if he just calls us warriors you know this is what we are . 1653825_1657225
and almost all of those young men were indeed from the moran@s:fra age grade . 1657565_1661185
so he &~s so he does that . 1662065_1663505
he says morani@s:fra . 1663605_1664025
which is the plural form of the moran@s:fra . 1664445_1667405
and they said okay that's good now we've got that covered . 1667405_1669805
but what would &~sh would we respond ? 1669945_1671325
and I &~th and &~th they thought and they thought and finally one person said well you know if someone calls you and you're startled by that you would say &=grunts &=laughs:multiple and so what if we just did that like we we're sort_of surprised that he called us ? 1672205_1686845
and so I said well I don't know okay let's try that so we go onto the set and they had kept the Samburu away like at a twenty mile distance from anyone else on the cast and crew and we were kept at like I &~w I was with them because I was the interpreter . 1687825_1702825
and we were kept segregated and I didn't realize really quite why that was until we shot this scene which was the first scene and what struck me was that the cameras were not oriented +//. 1703485_1712045
the first setup of the cameras was not on the Masai Samburu but in fact on everybody else . 1712185_1717845
and what I realized afterwards was what +//. 1719065_1720345
we were being kept apart because they wanted to capture as true as possible a sense of shock and amazement at the exotic Samburu on everyone else's faces so Val Kilmer and all the people in the crowd were supposed to be totally shocked by the sight of us . 1720705_1735425
because it would be truly indeed the very first time that they would see any of the Samburu . 1735525_1739565
and so all &~th all the the orientation of the cameras was a big clue . 1740295_1743795
so anyway so they shot the scene several times he calls morani@s:fra . 1744455_1748335
they jump up out_of the grass they ran forward they stood in a line and then they said &=grunts in unison . 1748335_1753255
and so then you could see Michael Douglas wasn't quite satisfied with that and he sat and talked with the director and <they thought> they thought like well what if you sustained that ? 1754175_1761915
what if you kept going with it for a little bit ? 1762195_1763635
can we try that ? 1763735_1764375
so everyone gets back in the grass they crouch down everyone &~c the director calls action whatever . 1765015_1770095
and they come running up forward and they stand in the line and all start they start doing this again &=grunts_three_times which would be like if we were to cough extendedly or hiccup extendedly or something &=laughs:multiple this is not what they do . 1770755_1781775
completely concocted . 1782275_1783735
anyway . 1784735_1785135
more on that later . 1785835_1786375
but what I wanna do is show you images of of what their life really truly is like . 1787065_1794585
and I wish that I had these on slides because I think it would do better justice to them but we'll just have to suffer with it . 1794785_1801985
wait +...
come back here for a second to show you what the area that I'm talking about . 1802065_1810685
Samburu area is here . 1810805_1811765
and Marawal is the main center where &~t where &~S Samburu come to trade and to buy the few things that they need from stores and stuff like that . 1812185_1820405
so downtown Marawal looks like this . 1821305_1824905
you can see the brightly colored shops there will be a mixture of people because it's a trading post so not only Samburu but people from all over who come and open up shops . 1825885_1835605
you can see the the imbrication and the coming together of different subsistence strategies . 1835905_1840905
so within Marawal you have this &~n the pastoralist Samburu but you also have shopkeepers who are engaged in in market exchange +... 1841145_1849825
just a close+up . 1854545_1855385
you can see some of the the tins that are hanging from the the rooftop there +... 1855565_1859885
if ever you wanted +//. 1862765_1863485
wondered yes there is a Hard Rock Cafe &=laughs:multiple you can't see that very well but it does indeed say Hard Rock Cafe . 1863515_1869515
(0.7) these are some cloth vendors . 1876995_1878055
now &~w in the pictures that you'll see of Samburu and Masai they have very strict color combinations of what they will and will not wear . 1878775_1886315
and men are are wearing a_lot_of red women wear a wear a_lot_of blue . 1886925_1891885
so certain &-uh as you see the +//. 1892365_1896105
that's not very clear . 1897825_1898605
(0.4) here you can see a Samburu woman who is now because of the the problems with pastoralism starting to engage in other activities . 1900305_1911565
they when these Samburu came down for the film they were actually selling their beadworks because they realized a_lot_of Westerners were really into that . 1912175_1919095
so you know they they they know how to exploit the market as well . 1919515_1922815
(0.8) so coming out_of Marawal now you see the arid environment in which they actually do their herding and it's it's a very challenging environment . 1931035_1940235
it's extremely extremely dry at times . 1940495_1942595
this is called an acacia tree which is no movie about Africa can be without an acacia tree +... 1944615_1949895
and here we're going into an area that is a &~li bit more lush . 1950775_1957595
(0.7) now the Rendille who are an neighboring group they herd camels . 1963945_1968025
in addition to goats in addition to cattle . 1968665_1970805
they've decided that it's better to diversify your your basket not don't don't put all of your eggs in one basket . 1971125_1976745
so they have camels and different things because they &~d if if a certain disease were to hit one of their animals then they still have the other ones . 1976925_1983045
Masai are pretty much exclusively into cows . 1983805_1986765
Samburu like will mix cows and goats but they don't deal with camels . 1987225_1991245
so that's another one of the differences between these groups . 1991305_1994185
what exactly they they domesticate . 1994665_1997825
(0.6) so you can see here a Rendille child herding his camels +... 1999045_2008165
and here's a Samburu child herding some goats . 2011345_2013065
(0.14) now we're gonna trace some house structures this is a Borani hut . 2026445_2029065
the Boran again are &~m more foraging people and so look what you notice about this is that their kraal is really &-um that that sort of very sort_of &-um not terribly involved fencing because they're gonna pick up and move not long afterwards . 2029585_2046845
their grass +//. 2047025_2047385
their &-um their houses are made of grass . 2048285_2049525
it's very &-um easy to take apart and very easy to construct . 2050085_2054185
Samburu are more settled than that . 2055805_2057965
they move but generally what would happen is that the elders will stay in a Boran homestead and the young boys the Morans the warriors will take the cattle and and and move around with the cattle . 2058205_2068485
but you do have the elderly people and the women and the children staying primarily in a kraal . 2069265_2073525
and kraal is their homestead the the area in which they keep their goats . 2073965_2077185
<when the> when the people come back from having gone around grazing +... 2077585_2080585
another Samburu homestead . 2086745_2087345
(0.7) you can see the construction it's much more detailed involved than the Borani +... 2087705_2102485
there's a woman gathering wood . 2107805_2109165
(0.6) now you see these are Morans . 2116235_2117575
and they're identifiable because they always walk around with three weapons . 2118235_2122195
they must have a spear they must have a knife that is &~s &~s is &-um tied around their waist and they have a walking stick which they call a wuru@s:fra which is generally under one arm . 2122615_2132455
so when they come to visit somebody they'll put the spears in the ground <and they'll> and they'll start socializing that way . 2134115_2139035
(0.4) now this is the cattle market . 2144305_2145585
&-um I was with these guys after the film and helped to accompany them back home and pay them and so first thing they did with their money was to go to a cattle auction and buy more cows <for their> &~commun for their families . 2146645_2159665
cows is how they they have their wealth . 2160245_2162825
that's how they measure wealth . 2163205_2164245
and whereas we you know consider money our our staple form of wealth and you accrue it in your bank account cows are like their bank account . 2164825_2173425
the more cows you have the more security you have against hardship down the line . 2173625_2177525
so here's people sitting around looking at the cows that are for sale and trying to decide which ones they wanna bid on +... 2178625_2185165
and the beadwork is another identifying factor that distinguishes one group from another . 2190305_2194505
&-um the color combinations they use in their beads . 2195385_2197845
there's a distinctly Samburu beadwork patterns that's different from the Masai it's different from Rendille . 2198365_2203265
so they can tell by looking at that which community you're from . 2203965_2208185
(0.4) now just the fact that there's an auction shows that again there's some market exchange going on . 2209285_2217905
and school has been introduced and so Samburu youths are now going to school . 2218705_2222945
just like most other children in Kenya . 2223485_2224725
(0.4) and you can see the beadwork on on women . 2226665_2232005
women &~aqui cumulate these beads all through their lives and they never take them off . 2232605_2236665
the idea is that they'll never take (th)em off . 2236785_2238085
and so it gets increasingly bigger at two points in your life when you're older after you've been around for quite awhile and when you're about to get married is when you'll be given a_lot_of beads by your older female relatives . 2238535_2249035
so when you get to this age and then you start giving your beads away to the young girls who are about to get married +... 2249895_2253755
this was one of our actors &-um come back home . 2257775_2262295
(0.10) and +... 2273585_2273885
if I don't wanna +//. 2275705_2276985
this one with Ruby it's just a nice particularly nice picture . 2277365_2279525
okay so <this is> this is the Samburu life that truly exists not the one that you'd see depicted in any sort_of film . 2280285_2288005
and (0.5) I wanna get back to the idea of making a living because (0.6) some anthropologists have &{l=SIC droted@u &}l=SIC that +//. 2289585_2305285
one anthropologist &-um Brenda Williams has talked about the difference between making a living and making life . 2306085_2311665
and what does she mean by that ? 2312565_2313405
(be)cause she's doing her research <in a> in a community in Guyana it's in Central America . 2313935_2319015
and she talks about how different groups talk about each_other in these terms . 2320335_2325715
so for instance Indian shopkeepers who are the people who have started most of the shops in this community . 2326355_2332875
they are talked about as being very very good at making a living but not terribly good at making life . 2333595_2339175
and what that is from the outside it looks for people who are not as devoted to shop keeping and all the work that that entails people say they work all the time . 2339545_2348805
<they're just> they're just working all the time . 2349105_2350485
and so they don't have time to actually live life . 2350865_2352605
they're too busy making a living . 2353025_2354025
and so she draws that distinction that making a living is defined as a person's industry skill or ambition all of which result in material &~w awards . 2355605_2362805
the things that requires whereas making life is your interest in socioeconomic well+being of others as_well_as your own . 2364185_2372865
so that some people place more emphasis on one rather than the other . 2374305_2378105
and the ideal is that you should be able to balance them . 2379025_2381825
we'll come back to that . 2382865_2383905
so in the book they let's see identified that there're what's often talked about in the literature is three phases of economic activity production distribution and consumption . 2385385_2395425
and I wish that I had a better computer I could actually it's kind_of a circle because what people consume feeds back into the production and that gets more complicated than that you could draw lines back and forth between the distribution . 2396185_2409045
how things are distributed may increase consumption or decrease consumption as opposed to you know there's that's much more complicated than just a simple production distribution consumption linear progression . 2409185_2421105
the production means the transformation of raw materials taken out_of nature and created into products that we find useful . 2423085_2431165
distribution is the allocation of goods and services . 2433555_2437195
and the consumption is the use of goods and services . 2438115_2442115
oftentimes the definition ends there . 2442695_2444955
but the book is making a point that you cannot just end it there . 2445535_2448135
and so they continue the definition as saying consumption is not only the use of goods and services for human survival but as_well_as to communicate human &~tha cultural values . 2448755_2458395
because we have to start accounting for the differences that come up . 2459535_2463535
why in that same region of Kenya are there pastoralists and foragers and agriculturalists and shopkeepers ? 2464675_2471195
you can't say that it's just for human survival I mean if there was just one way of surviving then we'd all be doing pretty much the same thing . 2471495_2478775
but there're we've all found different ways . 2478895_2480255
and we value those different ways and we they have meaning for us . 2480675_2483755
so what is it about consumption that also talks about culture cultural values ? 2484125_2488805
(0.10) and mythological theories have tended to focus one of these over the other . 2489445_2501345
and we're gonna look through those but after you've had your break . 2503725_2507705
so stand up and stretch for three minutes and we'll come back to the different types of data . 2507825_2510405

okay we start with we start with the middle of that line I introduced excuse_me +... 2702545_2708445
so if you start looking at production distribution consumption we're starting in the middle at distribution . 2708845_2715445
and the theories that have arisen out_of &~th examination of distribution is called exchange theory . 2715925_2722125
exchange being another way of thinking about distributing things . 2722265_2725365
so for a period of time exchange theory was what dominated early &~anthropolo economic anthropology . 2726735_2732575
because it was seen <it was> it was theorized in response to what what then the dominant economic model . 2733595_2740415
which is neoclassical economic theory as emblemized by Adam Smith . 2740795_2744235
and the book goes into that &-um what what neoclassical economic theory is that it's &~th emphasis on the free market as the motor of capitalism that it's free because there are no traditional restrictions determining how things are distributed in previous times you know only nobles could get certain things and some &~thing <there were> there were &~d restrictions on how things could be distributed . 2745375_2766995
now the free market is free because those &~rest restrictions supposedly don't exist . 2767275_2771975
that prices fluctuate in response to the laws of supply and demand &-um that the market determines levels of production and consumption . 2773425_2781645
all this should be familiar to you and capitalism is the only form of economic rationality . 2782145_2786885
well the logical extension of that of_course is that noncapitalist societies are irrational and that is something that we do not accept . 2787765_2794825
so in trying to promote that the response to this dominant paradigm +... 2795825_2800245
anthropologists came up with the idea of exchange theory . 2806155_2807915
and they were called substantists substantivists excuse_me . 2809595_2814435
they were responding to people called formalists . 2815015_2817035
formalists are there were some people within anthropology who did find that neoclassical economic theory was applicable to noncapitalist societies &-um but substantivists rejected that claim in saying that it's not applicable you have to understand each society's economic system on its own basis . 2817155_2833635
and so they say that there's more than one possible economic rationality . 2835735_2839455
that contrary to capitalist thought everything does not have a price and is not for sale . 2840215_2844395
that the self-interested materialism of Western capitalism is not universal . 2845735_2850675
and that trying to force non Western economies into these Western models irrespective of fit is doomed to failure . 2852515_2860595
because you're just you're you're imposing this . 2860855_2862635
moreover they point out that the capitalist market is a relatively recent invention in the history of humanity and that it is not the only mode of exchange . 2864365_2873745
so that noncapitalist societies have alternate modes of exchange and they &~di distribute goods in accordance with their cultural values . 2875525_2883065
so the what goes into some examples of what these kinds of exchange are &-um in broad sweeping +//. 2884185_2891665
to paint it +//. 2891795_2892355
sweeping terms <you can> you can think about it this way . 2892875_2895655
that in the West wealth is measured by how much we consume . 2895875_2899075
the house you live in the car you drive the clothes you wear the number of CDs you have in your collection etcetera etcetera etcetera . 2899735_2907575
we &~ch that's how that's the mark &~o of how wealthy someone is . 2908135_2911275
how much you consume how much you can consume . 2911555_2913155
but in other parts of the world as in Africa and in the Northwest Coast wealth is seen by how much you give away . 2913875_2921275
that the true mark of a wealthy man is how &~m is that he can give tons of money away gifts you know he can constantly give things away . 2921935_2929155
so it's not the consumption but the distribution that is the marker of wealth . 2929615_2933415
so Marshall Sahlins identified three modes of exchange . 2935155_2938095
in saying that there's an alternative to the West he &~c hadta come up with some alternatives . 2938635_2941415
so these are reciprocity redistribution and market exchange being what the the West is famous for +... 2941755_2949195
so there are three kinds of reciprocity according to Marshall Sahlins . 2949975_2961175
and these are generalized reciprocity which is where you give something with no expectation that it will be returned immediately anytime soon +... 2961835_2972095
second thing is balanced reciprocity and the example in the book was at Christmas time when you give gifts but you also expect to receive gifts . 2975535_2982535
so that's balance . 2983135_2983975
when there's an equal exchange when an exchange is made with the expectation that there will be a a return to you within a prescribed period of time . 2984125_2992365
so that's called balanced reciprocity . 2993225_2994505
and the third one is negative reciprocity the attempt to get something for nothing . 2995125_2998625
so haggling at the market that's if you wanna go that far . 2999125_3001965
that's called negative reciprocity +... 3002365_3004225
redistribution is the second mode of exchange . 3008345_3010125
and that is where a central organization or a central person and the example was the IRS as an organization . 3011635_3019815
the example of a person in a chiefdom would be a chief who accepts contributions from everybody in a society and then redistributes it according to the needs of everyone in society . 3020355_3030435
so redistribution is another form of exchange . 3030635_3033935
so as you can see these two reciprocity and redistribution are not in keeping with the capitalist mode . 3035865_3040665
I mean there's no prices involved &-um &~al the things that go on with market exchange are do not apply . 3040825_3046825
so potlatch is something that appears in the Northwest Coast of North America . 3047965_3052565
and that's a very famous example that anthropologists have used to talk about redistribution as a mode of exchange . 3053845_3059665
because that's where some noble in in this +//. 3060165_3063025
these Native American communities will take a_lot_of wealth and just give it away or burn it you know just get rid of it . 3062945_3069365
but a_lot_of it is giving it away . 3070305_3072065
and so that's seen as irrational or like that like he's not getting any profit from this +//. 3072445_3077505
why would someone do that ? 3078385_3079485
why would they take all their wealth and just give it all away ? 3079605_3081805
but that's because in part people who who are confused by that are seeing wealth and profit in singularly material terms . 3082395_3091135
so that if if if wealth is only the things that you have then it's hard for you to understand how you can still be wealthy after you've given all that stuff away . 3091995_3099655
but in other societies wealth is measured by many different things so you can get prestige you can raise your status in society by having done that which is worth more than things the dishes and the pots and everything else that you've just given away and redistributed to everybody . 3100275_3114695
so a potlatch is an example a very famous example of redistribution . 3116755_3120435
another example would be rotating credit associations . 3121575_3123555
these are found all over the world . 3124155_3126555
and that's where &~an &~i particularly strong in women's groups . 3127435_3131015
&-um and my experience again in Africa has has led me to see how these things work . 3131755_3136535
a rotating credit association is where a group of women will get together . 3136875_3139855
and mind you you know life is hard . 3140715_3142275
and so your daily needs your your daily income whatever you do generally just about covers what your daily needs are . 3142455_3150075
and there's often not a_lot_of surplus there . 3150195_3151935
so when a big expense comes along like you need a new roof or your child needs the school fees to be paid something big or &~y you have somebody who's getting married and you know that that's gonna be a major expenditure . 3152235_3164435
when something big comes along that often cripples the the little person . 3165355_3168875
I &~me I don't mean &~b but someone who doesn't have access to a_lot_of wealth . 3169115_3172495
so what rotating &~s credit associations do is that they &~pu you get together with a group of your friends people who you trust and everyone puts in a certain amount of money every month . 3173035_3182855
and one person gets to walk away every month with the whole lump sum . 3183395_3186395
and you'll plan it out like as as you get together a woman will say you know in October I'm gonna need to pay my &~scon you know my son's school fees . 3186935_3193075
and another woman will say well and then in November my daughter's getting married . 3193575_3197295
so it will be planned so that somebody everyone benefits from getting a big lump sum of money that they wouldn't be able to build themselves on a daily basis . 3197755_3205855
so that's another way of distributing funds . 3206035_3208275
in East Africa you have these things called dance societies as well where purportedly the idea was people get together and enjoy life and that this is a form of entertainment getting together and dancing and performing at weddings and stuff like that . 3209995_3222215
but another thing those societies served as self-help &~s organizations too . 3222585_3227485
people would come together and would help out contribute their labor and contribute money and gifts for big events . 3227925_3233985
so funerals and weddings being the primary two . 3234165_3236165
so that if you had such an event in your family you &~n you could depend on your your dance society to come in and show up on these required day and be there to help cook be there with all the extra plates you're gonna need to distribute the food and be there to contribute money for all the other additional costs that are entailed . 3236905_3254465
so dance societies also serve this function for redistributing wealth +... 3255005_3258385
and I put here secret societies with a question mark in America because we have such things . 3260205_3264225
and and it's a way of maybe not distributing money so much as distributing contacts getting getting knowledge out about different people and leads in to jobs and stuff like that . 3264745_3275705
that can be seen as a redistribution as well redistribution of knowledge and services and contacts . 3275825_3280565
(0.8) market exchange then is the final form of exchange that is discussed in the book . 3289545_3298345
and Karl Pulanyi is most famous for being associated with that and defining capitalism as an exchange of goods so trade calculated in terms of a multipurpose medium of exchange and standard value IE money . 3298525_3314325
and carried on by means of a supply demand price mechanism IE the market . 3315395_3319955
so these are the these are the defining features of capitalism . 3320735_3323595
and then I said before different modes of exchange can coexist in a single society but one general resource is the primary mode of operation so that when we say capitalist West or capitalist America we know that these other things occur . 3324715_3338275
there are gifts we give gifts to each_other we have reciprocity too we also redistribute we have that too but the dominant mode that drives our economy as a nation is the market . 3339065_3349885
and so therefore we are considered a capitalist society . 3350285_3352145
other societies will lend weight to something else so in in the Samburu community I showed you you see people involved in trade . 3352565_3359985
&-um there might be some some agriculture there too I I haven't seen it in the Samburu but you know there's different ways of you you combine strategies to to get by . 3360515_3370595
now the second +//. 3370775_3373095
so if we've done distribution <the middle> the middle point in that equation we move backward now the next thing that came to be very popular in anthropology is production theory . 3373755_3384055
and this was generated as a result of interest of the writings of Karl Marx . 3384945_3388785
who should be familiar to you . 3389525_3390885
now Marx is is is &~ve is very famous for having recognized and placed importance and emphasized in human labor . 3391605_3399865
so that the piece of paper that I'm holding up is composed of pulp from wood . 3400325_3404045
but if you just see it if you just attach its value to the value of the wood you'd be off because what made it into paper is not the wood but +//. 3405225_3412985
so much as the labor involved in taking the wood and mashing it up and treating it with chemicals etcetera and pressing it . 3413345_3419405
all that labor involved that that resulted in these pieces of paper . 3419765_3422805
so the labor is what transforms the natural resources the raw materials and takes them and creates products out_of them . 3423365_3430205
and the labor is often ignored when people are attaching prices to things . 3430505_3435265
they look at the components of something and so that's why &-um he &~s he seems very revolutionary for emphasizing that we need to take account of the human labor involved in production . 3435385_3445125
he also focused on how labor links human groups . 3445665_3449185
it's not a singular individual activity . 3449445_3451205
it's something that we do together and not only links us to each_other but it links us to the material world . 3451885_3456085
(be)cause that's what we're dealing with . 3456365_3457125
we're taking these things from the world around us and transforming them . 3457215_3460515
so that labor is this thing that can create solidarities . 3461335_3465255
(0.13) people sometimes get bogged down in the terminology associated with Marxist thought . 3466675_3482175
so a way to think about it is that he talks about the means of production . 3482535_3485835
the means of production are the things you need to do the production the act of production . 3486215_3490175
so in the case of paper you need your wood you need your machinery to cut down wood you need the chemicals involved in treating the wood you need the pressers to press it into paper . 3490515_3498455
all those things are means of production . 3498735_3500735
and the knowledge including the knowledge that goes into knowing how to transform wood into paper . 3501535_3507115
so it's this tools the skills the organization and the knowledge used to to extract an energy from nature . 3507815_3514075
in a &~por in addition to that you have the relations of production . 3515155_3520435
now I said labor links &~p people together and creates social groupings so what are the relationships between groups &-um that link people either to the natural materials or to each_other or to the tools in the means of production ? 3521315_3534275
what are the relationships between all the people in this process ? 3534625_3537865
so if you take the means of the production in conjunction <with the> &~mo with the relations of production the sum total is what you will see as the mode of production for a given &~s community . 3538765_3549925
and that as defined by Eric Wolf is a specific historically occurring set of social relations through which labor is deployed to wrest energy from nature by means of tools skills organizations and knowledge . 3550395_3564255
so you see in his definition he says the social relations combined with the means of production . 3564635_3569735
so that's what Karl Marx's &-um having been able to break down economic relations into these different components . 3570505_3581385
(0.9) now Marx theorized at least eight different forms of +//. 3582245_3592345
modes of production . 3592825_3593305
we're not gonna deal with all eight here just gonna talk about four . 3594005_3597065
one of them is the kin ordered mode of production . 3598785_3601345
the kin ordered mode of production is where labor is deployed on the basis of kinship relations . 3603745_3609005
so for instance foragers we saw that in the bands they're generally bands composed of family members so that that people have &~s prescribed tasks within the band as to what they're going to do the economic activities they're going to do . 3609645_3621325
so that's a that's an example of a kin ordered mode of production . 3622145_3624905
another one would be peasant farmers if you think of the family farm where everyone on the farm again is assigned specific tasks . 3625315_3632595
so that would be another example of a kin ordered mode of production . 3633695_3636275
&-uh tributary mode of production is where the producer is allowed access to the means of production but required to give tribute in exchange . 3636955_3647975
lemme give you an example of that . 3648615_3649595
think of feudal times &-um a feudal lord <he could> have peasants working on his land . 3649755_3653675
those peasants could produce for themselves as well they had access to the means of production the means in that case being the land the seed whatever tools they needed so they had access to the means of production but they hadta pay a certain amount of it back to &~th to &-um to somebody else . 3654015_3671395
so they hadta give tribute . 3671895_3672835
okay ? 3673395_3673555
another example would be chiefdoms where you have that where people give &~t bring tribute they'll harvest their own plots of land they'll have their plots of land but then the at the end of the harvest they'll come and they'll give a certain portion of that over to the chief who will store it for times of need for everybody else . 3673705_3687105
so that's where the redistribution comes in . 3687605_3689005
people bring in they give tribute to <the chief> the chief stores it in times of need he pulls out the extra stores of food and &=noise_disturbance xxx distribute that . 3689225_3696645
so the tributary mode of production is another variety . 3697285_3700245
the capitalist mode of production is where you know Marx has done a_lot_of work . 3702175_3706255
and it has three defining features . 3707015_3708295
first of all the means of production are owned by the capitalists . 3709175_3712575
so that in a factory if you're given as an example the factory's owned by somebody who would then be called in Marxist terms the capitalist . 3713755_3720615
workers do not own the means of production and they must sell their labor to the capitalists in_order_to survive . 3721655_3727035
so they are disenfranchised from the means of production &-uh factory workers don't own any share of that and so that they're just they're selling their labor . 3727655_3736115
the company's buying their labor . 3736335_3737595
and finally that worker's labor translates into profits a surplus of wealth for the capitalist . 3738455_3746255
so Marx analyzed this whole set of relationships and these are and this evolves &~t people get the social relationships between the capitalists and the workers and the means of production owned by the capitalists and not the workers that together those sets of constraints means that you have a capitalist mode of production . 3747225_3762685
and then Marx theorized the creation of &-uh an ideal form in his mind a mode of production would be the socialist mode wherein everybody in society would own all the means of production and that would be the ideal . 3763745_3776005
<we know> we know from history that some communities and nations have tried to do that <and not> &~fail and not succeeded but in in his theory that would be ideal if everyone could own the means of production that would be a truly egalitarian system . 3776425_3788705
so what we see is that there's a shift now from focus on exchange to focus on production . 3790465_3795605
and this &~ge this shift in focus generated another sort_of &~amp &-um antecedent shifts &-uh in terms of anthropological economic thought . 3797705_3807465
and that is that whereas before in in the use &~o looking at exchange theory there was more of an emphasis on exchange &-um and and equality and social equilibrium +... 3807825_3819605
how the system maintains itself that you know there's there's one person and they generate they accrue an enormous amount of wealth . 3819885_3827145
but then it reaches this level where it's just too much and so then he hasta give it all away . 3827425_3832525
and so that brings everything back to zero again and it goes up again . 3833165_3835485
<and the> and the system just keeps working over and over to maintain this sense of equilibrium . 3835985_3839885
well Marx by talking about production and the inequality inherent to certain types of mode of production shifted the focus and so now is +//. 3840625_3849645
we think in terms of not so much equilibrium but social change . 3849985_3853485
and the dynamics and conflict how different communities because of their relationship their unequal relationship or their different positions in the mode of production therefore come into contact with each_other . 3853945_3865405
they have different interests . 3865645_3866205
(0.18) so these different interests often are related to or supported by different ideologies that come about . 3886475_3895175
and Marx defined ideology as the products of consciousness such as morality religion metaphysics that explain to people who they are and justify to them the kind of lives they lead . 3896215_3906935
and Marx had a very crude take on the relationship between ideology and economics . 3907495_3912115
for him economics is the motor of everything and that where you are in the economic map or in the economic ladder will determine what you think about that . 3912275_3921415
and since then we've moved away from that we've we've looked at how there's much more complex relationship between thought and action between ideology and material practice what you're actually doing every day . 3922955_3935315
that that it's hard to &~fi figure out that one determines the other there's a_lot_of going back and forth between them . 3935675_3941575
and so it's not as easy as that . 3942295_3943895
as a result Marx is thought of as being very materialist . 3944455_3947375
because he's grounded in economics in the making of living &-um focus . 3947735_3951675
so from production theory we'll spend the last few minutes talking about consumption theory the last in our tripartite equation . 3953035_3960695
and this is more recent although one way not because Bronislaw Malinowski is talked about in your book as having thought about this too &-uh Malinowski is one of these early anthropologists that we've already mentioned in the course who worked in the Trobriand Islands Melanesia and he thought that consumption occurred to fulfill certain primarily biological needs . 3962955_3984195
that you know you consume foods because you need food I mean that you create houses simply because you need shelter and that's that's the main emphasis on consumption . 3984725_3994005
simply the fulfillment of needs . 3994605_3996585
and taken to its extreme form that can be seen as a form of biological materialism that what our bodies need therefore determines what our culture will produce for us or what we do . 3997805_4006645
and so that's that's that's it the argument in its extreme form . 4007305_4011125
it's flawed because it reduces the complexity of human thought and action to one single factor . 4012245_4018585
that if it was just biology then people living in the same environment or having access to the same kinds of foods would all be doing the same thing because their biology sort_of determines that . 4019185_4029165
and we know that's not true . 4029705_4030725
we know that in any given environment a community may find one plant edible meanwhile another community might find that plant poisonous as far as they're concerned &-um we eat different things we do different things we construct different forms of shelter &-um all these things are +//. 4030635_4045815
there's too much diversity in how we go about fulfilling those needs that you cannot anymore talk about simply consumption is the fulfillment of biological needs . 4046435_4055555
(0.12) the book then goes on to talk about cultural ecology and says how other people came and started theorizing consumption in terms of constraints given in the environment that you create certain houses you you pursue certain economic strategies because you are limited given your environment on what those strategies are . 4067955_4089455
so cultural ecology is not necessarily <what we're> xxx about but it examines the relationship between people and their environment . 4090725_4096165
and the most extreme form of it assumes that consumption occurs only in direct relation to what the constraints are within the environment . 4097365_4104945
but as I showed you on the map of Kenya you have a very similar environment and very different ways of approaching how to live within that same environment . 4105945_4113965
so environment also just like biology cannot be the only factor . 4114385_4118625
there's gotta be other things contributing to it . 4118895_4121735
so cultural diversity is not accounted for in either of these +//. 4123215_4125535
the extreme forms of these two of these two interpretations . 4125935_4129095
and there are less extreme forms and so I I don't mean to throw out the baby with the bath water but &-um so how do we how to we take into <effect a> culture ? 4130375_4138615
culture defines the needs of its people and shapes their strategies for responding to those needs . 4139395_4144855
it gives meaning to life and how one goes about <making life> making life <in the> in the terminology of of Brenda Williams again . 4145645_4152745
not just it's not just about making a living . 4153525_4155645
if it was just that then we could talk about you know materialist reductionism or biological reductionism or the environmental reductionism . 4155965_4165925
but it's more than that making a living is just one part of what we do as humans . 4166605_4171345
we are involved in this edvdevor@u to making lives for ourselves . 4171765_4174945
and life is much more than simply the eating and the sleeping <and the> and the doing that we need for our basic needs . 4175325_4181565
so how is it culture then makes us helps us to understand what else goes into making a living that makes us live lives that we find meaningful ? 4182665_4190685
and with purpose &-um the book talked about food prohibitions as different ways that culture intervenes in the consumption process that for instance it talks about how pork is an abominable food in terms of Islamic and and Jewish communities and why is that so . 4191405_4208805
you know people are living it's the same meat for everybody it's edible by some standards but &~ter not at all edible by others . 4209305_4216365
how is that ? 4216725_4217025
that's an example of culture intervening and bringing a different meaning to food . 4217025_4221465
food is not simply food . 4221785_4222725
food means who you are it's a marker of identity . 4223505_4226485
if you don't eat pork that identifies you as a particular type of person if you do eat pork that identifies you as a particular type of person . 4226965_4233505
so it's not simply food but fulfillment of our bodily needs . 4234085_4237405
another example would be money . 4237805_4239525
money you think of as a standard value reducible to a single price and a single value all over the world by whatever type of money you're dealing in . 4239795_4249795
but anthropological studies of the uses of money also show that money takes on different connotations and different meanings so that in East Africa among the Luo community in Uganda where David Parten has done research there's money there's bitter money which is bad money and good money . 4250135_4267755
and it depends on which crop it came from . 4267805_4269385
<if you> if you grow corn and you derive a profit from that well then that's good money and you can use that money to pay for your daughter's wedding or to pay for your funerals . 4269985_4279485
that's good money that can be generating more life in terms of your kin obligations . 4280265_4284285
but if you're growing tobacco or any of a variety of other crops that are not thought of as as highly desirable and it brings in a profit you cannot then channel that money into things related to the regeneration of your family . 4284945_4299685
it is seen as somehow it's gonna hurt your family . 4300125_4301825
it's bad money it's tainted . 4302245_4303545
so the money's the same and it's the same money . 4304005_4306725
but it has different meanings according to where it came from . 4307105_4308885
so again it's another example of culture intervening and bringing meaning to things . 4308965_4312765
and we don't &~ha we're not so far off on that . 4312825_4314585
we have the idea of money laundering . 4314745_4316825
right ?
that's taking money that came out_of bad sources and having to be washed somehow and made good again so that it can be clean money so it's not a totally foreign concept from us . 4317465_4327365
(0.4) now I just have one more thing +//. 4327645_4333525
oh to end with . 4333965_4335005
and that's this question about making a living versus making life in America . 4335245_4339505
a few days ago there was this article in the New York Times +... 4340665_4343745
about a new disease or syndrome that's that's particularly bad in the Silicon Valley area but it's also bad in other parts of the States . 4348185_4355505
and it's called Sudden Wealth Syndrome . 4355945_4357405
it's also called Affluenza . 4358265_4359085
now what do you do when you suddenly are &{l=SIC wildly &}l=SIC beyond your wildest imaginations and all the problems that has the the article had these families that are having to do these support groups and stuff . 4360745_4371385
and and they talk about how the kids are interviewed <and if> and if you are middle class that's the lowest of the low man if you only get one trip to Hawaii per year oh you've gone to the absolute bottom of of the social ladder . 4372125_4385525
and they talk about these kids you know it's just totally normal daddy has a helicopter plus his airplane plus his this that and all the stresses that that comes with that . 4385925_4394285
so if making a living is what these people are are clearly excellent at but what these articles seem to &~in suggest is that they're not terribly good at making life that they're having all these problems attached to the making of a living . 4394885_4407445
so I leave you with that think about the links to be made xxx . 4407685_4415025
