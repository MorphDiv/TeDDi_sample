on the next one a gopher comes out and bites him it looks like .

and then he knocks down the bee hive .
<and the little boy> while the little boy is looking in the
the little boy gets down because the bees a flying straight towards

I think that's what it is +...
a crow flies right over .
and he sees his frog .
and he thinks these are branches .
and he holds on to them calling +"/.
+" frog where are you ?
but it is really a reindeer .
and he's running and running and running .
and they go over into a pond I think .
and they go +"/.

the boy's calling frog where are you ?
<and the dog> it looks like the dog is probably scared because

oh and the reason that he's calling for the frog is because

first page .
one night a little boy was sitting on a stool next_to his bed .
and then there's a dog that was feeling +...
&-um I wonder what the dog was feeling +...
I think he wanted to eat the frog .
he was feeling like he wanted to eat the frog ?
it looks that way .
and the little boy was happy .
and so was the frog .
and the frog <crept out_of the> crept out_of the jar .
I think he was feeling happy .
those two felt very sleepy .
and the next morning they woke up and no frog !
no frog there .
<they were both feeling> he was feeling +"/.
+" oh no bad !
he the doggy +...
it doesn't give me enough information +...
and &-um the doggy gets his head stuck in the jar .
and the boy's looking all over the place .
and I think he's feeling sort of &-um +...
what do you call it +...
well whatever you call it +...
I thinks feeling a little squished .
squished ?
and the boy's still feeling unhappy .
and he's feeling scared because he thinks he's gonna fall off .
and he's still unhappy .
and he's screaming +"/.
+" frog where are you ?
at least I can tell from the cover .
and then the dog falls out the window .
<and the> and &-um he's like +"/.
+" whoops !
and then he's mad at the dog .
and the glass jar that was around his head went zzz .
crack .
he's mad at the dog .
and <then he's> again he's calling +"/.
+" frog where are you ?
and the boy is feeling still unhappy .
and the dog's like +"/.
+" zzz .
he's trying to catch the bees .
I guess that's what he's doing +...
and he goes over to a gopher hole .
and the frog is jumping at &-um <the bee's net> &-um the
and &-um he is looking in a gopher hole .
and he's probably calling +"/.
+" frog are you in there ?
and then the gopher jumps out and bites him in the nose .
it looks like he's feeling bad .
and the dog is still trying to get the bee hive .
what might he be saying here ?
+" ouch .
+" ouch .
&-um and the boy went up to look into a tree .
and he's probably calling +"/.
+" frog are you in there ?
and &-um and the dog knocked down the bee hive .
and it looks like all the bees are trying to get him now .
and then the boy jumped off the tree and went straight down because
and I wonder why the dog is running away like that .
because he doesn't wanna be stung by the bees .
and &-um here he's dodging the owl .
now that I've thought about it .
and he's walking up here .
and he's calling +"/.
+" frog where are you ?
and that's on this page too .
that's on this page .
and he's holding on to some what he thinks are branches .
it is really some kind of deer's &-um &-um horns .
and the deer goes zzz .
and lifts him up .
and then the deer runs .
and the dog is running too .
<and &-um they> and then the deer stops zzz really fast .
and the boy goes flying off .
and the dog goes zzz into the lake just like he does .
and he is definitely not feeling good .
and the boy and the +...
and that's <the> a picture of him in the lake .
and there they're like zzz .
and then he's like +"/.
+" okay let's get on with the search .
now let's get on with the search he says .
and I wonder why he's holding his hand up to his ear .
oh because he hears &-um the frogs <chirp-ing or whatever they do>
and then he says +"/.
+" look ssh !
they're creeping up behind the log .
and then he jumps over the log with the dog .
and then he sees <the two> <the dog and> <I mean>
and he says +"/.
+" oh froggy !
how does the boy feel there ?
he feels <happy> excited .
and the dog's like zzz .
and he's like +"/.
+" what the heck <are going> is going on here ?
the dog's thinking +"/.
+" what the heck is going on here ?
yeah .
and then he finds another frog over here .
a little small frog .
I think it's a baby .
the end .
is he saying anything to the frogs ?
+" I found another one .
he's saying to them +"/.
+" I found another one ?
