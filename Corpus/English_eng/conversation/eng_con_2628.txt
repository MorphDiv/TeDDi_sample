today what I'd like to do is to finish up our sort_of first seven weeks of the course which are taking eight and a half weeks of of the +...
interaction of classical fields with atoms or molecules +...
and later on today we'll start some aspects of the quantized nature of the field .
the assignment for next time looks long but it's actually much shorter than all all of our other assignments because we're now entering into an area where +...
it's not so much my area of expertise so that I can't make up such long problems &-uh hopefully &~educat problems that are educational but these are more standard &~s problems which are fairly simple and take only a page rather than three and four pages so even though it looks longer it's really one of the shortest assignments <of the> of the semester .
the material actually on that again the material that we're going to be starting to use is really covered pretty well in Mandel and Wolf so that starting with the quantized field I think that if you use the text and I I emailed you various sections that we're covering I think that'll help you and you'll be able to go ahead .
in fact one of the homework problems I think is actually solved at the end of the Wolf and also the first volume of Cohen_Tannoudji's book on &-uh Introduction to Electrodynamics interaction of atoms with fields is on reserve at at the &-uh science library that's also covers this the material .
but it's also covered in almost any basic quantum optics book .
but before we get there let's start and just +//.
I wanted to finish up again what we had last time on the Ramsey fringes .
the physical experiment here and developed by Ramsey is one in which you have something an atomic beam that passes through two field regions .
and the idea here is to get a line shape eventually that will be narrower in frequency than you would've had if you did CW spectroscopy and you would've been limited by the transit time the amount of time the atom stays in the field interaction regime .
here we're assuming that the atom really doesn't spend very much time in the field interaction regime we're assuming short pulses but that there's a time interval between pulses which in the atomic rest frame is just L over VX where VX is the longitudinal velocity and VZ is the transverse velocity or v@l perpendicular in this case .
so the idea of the experiment is you detune the laser field from the atomic transition by a certain amount you send the atoms through and you measure the population of the atoms just as they exit the field region you can do this in a number of ways field ionization or just probing it with another if it's in the RF domain with another radio frequency field .
does everyone understand the experiment ?
you do that for both fields right ?
excuse_me ?
you check after each .
no you check only after the second field .
only after the second .
only after the second field you check for the population .
alright ?
so just right here you check for the population .
now what's physically going on here ?
between .
yes .
between the out field .
it +//.
both fields have the same between .
oh .
alright ?
normally the way you would do this is you would take this field and send it down via some &-uh corner cube or something else and get it .
&~i &~i &~i in the case of optics in the case of RF you would have two cavities that you would be sending the atoms through and you would have to weight the cavities to to &-uh make sure that the cavities have a fixed relative phase .
so this is what's happening and we wanna measure the population so physically what's going on here ?
this is what +//.
you can +//.
once you understand that then I think &-uh things are are fairly straightforward .
what you're doing what you're going to be measuring here is essentially a difference in phase .
xxx ?
the first pulse actually starts a clock .
you can think of it as starting a clock pressing down <on a> &~s on a stopwatch and starting a clock and the second pulse then stops the clock (0.4) alright ?
so which phases are we actually comparing with this start and stop ?
if you think of this this way you won't get confused (be)cause a_lot_of times people get confused they say well look the pulses are off we have the natural frequency here or how do we get anything in this experiment ?
if you think of it in terms of these clocks I think you'll figure out what's going on .
what phases are you comparing ?
(0.6) there's only two frequencies in the problem +...
aside from Doppler shift .
one is the frequency of the .
⌈ atom ⌉ .
⌊ field ⌋ .
well you got (th)em both alright ?
&=laughs:S2 one is the frequency of the atom +/.
atom +/.
+, and one is the frequency of the field +/.
+, field +/.
+, and how much frequency does the +//.
how much phase does the field go through in the time interval between the pulses ?
that length ?
&-uh think of it in terms of time it's easier how much phase does it go through +..?
its frequency is big omega so it's just .
omega .
omega T .
omega times T big T .
and how much phase does the atom the dipole that you've created go through ?
if its natural frequency is little omega ?
little omega times T .
little omega times T .
so what's the difference in phase ?
⌈ delta times T ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ just delta times T ⌋ so all you're doing is measuring this relative phase <of the> of the field and the atom .
the atomic oscillator .
and that's what a Ramsey fringe does the measurement does .
it takes and it lets you compare two frequencies and this is very important because you can make &~f laser frequencies very stable and you're trying to get atomic frequencies maybe as a standard as a time standard so this lets you essentially get a very precise way as we'll see of creating some type of standard time standard .
and in fact this is what's used now .
so there's no Doppler phase .
there is a Doppler phase we have to look at it and see what's involved with a Doppler phase .
which we did that last time but I'll redo it again today .
now any question on <the physics once> the physics once you got the physics then the rest is is is mathematics but it's &~i it's really &~a and there are some important &~applica implications of the Doppler shift as well so we have to look at that .
alright everybody any questions on the physics ?
alright ?
stop +//.
start and stop of a clock so that last time we calculated in fact what W is right after the second pulse and that's +//.
we're interested in rho two two or W it doesn't make a difference really .
and W is just sine a@l one sine a@l two and those are the areas of the pulse e@l to the minus gamma t@l cosine delta bar T where delta bar &{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD equals delta plus K v@l perpendicular .
&}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD which is K VZ and then there's another term which has cosine a@l two but doesn't depend on delta +...
that's just essentially the part of the ground state that went through without getting excited and we're not really interested in that .
so we can neglect this part &=crosses_out_something_on_board not that it's not there it'll give you some background but it doesn't depend on delta .
now remember we're gonna look at our signal as a function of delta +...
but aren't you gonna record that when you make the measurement &~y .
it's a background so it affects .
so how do you get rid of it ?
I mean you hafta have ⌈ some ⌉ .
⌊ it doesn't ⌋ make a &~differ in other words even if you have a background signal +/.
yeah +/.
+, that's a constant and that's not what you're interested in so it may affect your signal to noise but it won't affect the the shape of the signal it'll just add it'll add a DC component to the signal alright ?
now in fact you can see that if you judiciously choose a@l one and a@l two you can actually make this term vanish identically as_well .
alright if you take the first pulse pi over two pulse and the second one well I don't know if you can make them both vanish here &-uh if you take the second pulse pi over two this vanishes +...
so it doesn't look like you make both of these &-uh this is sine squared a@l one over two so &-um (0.7) &=writes:board well I don't think you can make both these vanish and that one <not be> &-uh not be zero but if you just take the second pulse have an area of pi over two then the &~f this term vanishes anyway because cosine a@l two would be zero +...
so we have to calculate the integral of this over velocity and we need some velocity distribution this is not in the vapor cell now we have a beam so there's some transverse distribution of velocity due to the divergence of the beam there you have divergence of the beam and there's some distribution of longitudinal velocities .
if we're a model energetic beam what would the longitudinal velocity distribution be ?
two you mean it'd just be constant ?
not constant if it was monoenergetic it would be a ?
delta function it would be delta VX minus whatever the speed of the beam is alright ?
monoenergetic means you have all the atoms have the same longitudinal velocity alright ?
now out_of a thermal source you don't get that out_of a supersonic source you can do a_lot better and you can use laser cooling techniques actually to get close to that .
so let's I just took a simple distribution for the speed along the beam VX squared typically in a thermal beam it might be VX cubed times e@l to the minus VX squared just moves it out a little bit .
but this is just a function that's peaked at some value related to UX .
so we have to calculate the &=writes:board integral of cosine delta plus K v@l perpendicular times T now remember T is L over &=writes:board VX times W of V (0.6) now this is again related to integrals we've seen before but the important thing is that let's look at &=writes:board K v@l perpendicular +...
times T .
and let's take some typical values .
K is on the order &=writes:board of ten to the fifth centimeters to the minus one in the optical this is in the optical +...
&=writes:board domain .
let's take a thermal beam &=writes:board v@l perpendicular let's let's take an angular divergence of ten to the minus three that's a pretty small angular divergence .
ten to the minus three radians .
why they in the Doppler now they have the exponential &-um u@l-s &-um UX &-uh U is that ?
this is UX squared .
alright that's gives us the most that's related to the most probable speed along the beam .
but here &~w <we have> we have u@l squared not .
I know but this is a beam you +//.
&-uh <that's in a> that's in a cell where UX squared average equals UY squared average equals UZ squared average +/.
mhm +/.
+, when you have a beam that's collimated the the velocity in the transverse direction is very small that's what you mean by a beam right ?
if it was going all over the place you wouldn't have a beam +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, and the velocity in the longitudinal direction is determined by the source so nubbin@u how the atoms come out along the beam right so there's a different probable velocity associated with the longitudinal motion and the transversh &~mot transverse motion .
+, okay +/.
+, alright ?
+, mm yeah +/.
+, so for v@l perpendicular in fact we take some Theta which is the beam divergence times let's say five times &=writes:board ten to the fourth or something centimeters a second and let's take &{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD Theta dot ten to the minus three &}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD that's a very small beam divergence so that's &{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD five times ten to the one &}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD centimeters per second .
and the idea in these experiments is you want to make T large so let's take L about a meter long it's not atypical so we take &=writes:board L equals a hundred centimeters +...
and VX is also let's take it thermal where UX is five times ten to the fourth centimeters per second alright ?
so if you multiply all those out you end up with &{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD K v@l perpendicular T is on the order of ten to the fourth +...
&}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD well what does that mean ?
(0.11) this is the Doppler shift that the atoms get because of their transverse motion interacting with the field remember they don't all have the same transverse velocity we have to integrate over it +...
and what's the +//.
for a typical atom what about its Doppler shift small or large ?
compared to unity .
this is a phase .
it's very large .
so as we integrate over v@l perpendicular what'll happen to all these phases +..?
&=unintelligible_answers:multiple .
they'll just cancel each_other out .
what are you telling us with +//.
you're asking us what that number means or what are you asking us with .
in other words this number's ten to the fourth but we still have to integrate I just took a &~st a typical v@l perpendicular we still have to integrate over v@l perpendicular +/.
mhm +/.
+, and since the phase for a typical atom is so large .
so you're saying the same thing that you said before basically <with the> with the ⌈ phases ⌉ .
⌊ with ⌋ &~in free induction decay +/.
okay +/.
+, it's the same effect as free decay .
how does it compare with delta ?
delta's not +//.
delta's fixed and we'll have to deal with delta also &~delt there's another phase here that we'll have to deal with but I want to look at this phase first .
no matter what delta is it's fixed .
so when we average over &~v@l-s v@l perpendicular the signal washes out_of the optical domain .
so you can't do the Ramsey fringe for these typical parameters in the optical domain +...
and in fact the original experiments were done in the RF domain where in the RF domain +...
&=writes:board what changes ?
frequency ?
frequency so K changes .
so K is about +...
&{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD ten to the minus six K optical +...
&}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD in the RF domain .
and what does that mean about the total phase then ?
it's small +/.
+, &{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD KRF +...
v@l perpendicular T is on the order of ten to the minus two &}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD or so so what about that phase ?
it's small ?
it's small and we can neglect it (0.9) so in the RF domain what about the second term ?
it's small .
we can throw it out +...
and that's where Lorentz originally carried out his experiments so we're left now with an integral of &{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD cosine delta L over VX times W naught of VX DVX &}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD .
okay .
but why are we looking in the RF domain ?
that +//.
that's where the &~or we don't hafta look in the RF domain that's where the experiments were originally carried out it's still an important domain .
because the frequency standards are are cesium for example ground state transition so it's a transition between between the two hyperfine states and the ground state which is in the radio frequency part of the spectrum .
it's on the order of gigahertz .
so that this is in fact the region where most standards have been developed so far it would be better if we could get an optical standard but we're not there yet because of other problems .
so that this is a way to measure for example transitions between hyperfine states +...
now what if we did have a monoenergetic beam ?
what would this signal look like ?
in other words if VX instead of being a distribution as I wrote it was just a delta function of VX minus some VX zero ?
xxx integration'd be easier ?
the integration would be trivial but what would we get +..?
let's say it was delta VX +...
&=writes:board minus VX zero or minus okay minus v@l zero (0.5) then when I integrate it what would I get +..?
&=writes:board cosine delta v@l zero I'm sorry cosine delta l@l over v@l zero .
well what does that look like as a function of delta ?
cosine .
cosine .
it's a cosine it looks like a cosine .
&=laughs:S2 but what's wrong with that for this experiment ?
why isn't that good you would think boy I'll do a_lot better if I don't hafta do this horrible integration if I have a monoenergetic beam I should get perfect results .
but what's wrong ?
why did +//.
isn't this useful ?
&-um you have a problem with the +...
it's not confined to a point in space ?
what are you trying to determine +..?
what value of delta ?
xxx .
when delta's equal to what ?
<you wanna> you wanna use this to measure the frequency of the transition so what value of delta do you need ?
zero .
zero .
well if I draw you a curve like this &=draws_curve_on_board which is delta equals zero ?
<xxx don't know> .
you don't know .
so in fact you want something that destroys all the fringes except the ?
delta equals zero fringe (0.4) is that clear ?
yeah &=erases_board:S1 .
excuse_me I'm not following this is it you want to measure <the delta> .
the populmation population as a function of delta .
uhuh +/.
+, alright ?
and I said that if this were a a monoenergetic beam we would just we wanna pick out the delta equals zero .
but if we had a monoenergetic beam we'd get a pure cosine there would be no way to isolate which is the central fringe the delta equals zero fringe .
why they want delta equals zero fringe ?
you tell me why do you want delta to equal zero ?
you say you want to measure the .
when a +//.
if delta equals zero what is the frequency of the laser equal to ?
equal to the omega .
equal to the atomic +/.
atomic +/.
+, and that's what you wanna measure .
+, oh okay +/.
+, alright +..?
when delta's zero what is this integral ?
&=unintelligible_answers:multiple .
&~g Gaussian .
no it's normalized but what's the integral ?
one .
just one .
and then what happens ?
as delta starts to deviate from zero you start to get oscillations and what'll happen eventually to this integral ?
as we integrate over it ?
it'll start to wash out .
you have to do this integral numerically and it's done in the notes but it'll look something like this .
(0.10) &=writes:board and what's the width ?
approximately ?
what's the order of the width ?
it's when this phase it's the value of &=taps_board of delta for which this phase is approximately equal to unity .
and we put in the UX so this width then in +//.
as a function of delta &=writes:board is just one over T which is UX of order .
it's of order one over T UX over L .
how do we know that gives us the width of the ?
you do it you do it numerically you can measure it but I'm just saying here you have a phase .
when do you start losing when does it +//.
when do you start getting things wash out when the phase is of order ?
pi .
pi unity pi equals two pi equals one right ?
&=s1_and_s2_laugh right for all these things for large values of one alright so +/.
⌈ that was my confusion xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ just get the ⌋ that's that's the order you always hafta you hafta do it numerically to see where it it goes down to one half the &-uh +/.
+, okay +/.
+, alright so you can look on the notes and &~j actually plot +/.
+, it was two pi equals one that got me +/.
+, alright two pi over one +...
you remind me sometime when we're not being taped I'll tell you a Feynman story about factors of two pi &=laughs alright +...
so this gives you a width that depends on what ?
laws .
as the length gets larger and larger what happens to the width ?
gets smaller .
smaller .
smaller and smaller so it looks like you have arbitrarily small width .
there's only one feature that's that we haven't mentioned so far or I didn't put it here .
we always have this &{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD E to the minus gamma T &}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD .
now in the RF domain that decay rate is very slow so you can go on forever .
but in the optical domain if you had that it would start to kill you very quickly except in certain cases .
and I'll talk about that in a second .
so here you can get very narrow widths that are not limited by transit time they'll be limited by signal to noise by drift by keeping your phase of your laser steady by locking your laser by your frequency stability of the laser .
really that's what the experimental problems will be .
and this is a very important technique .
any questions on the RF domain ?
we can do it in the optical domain but not with this setup .
and I'll show you how to do that right now +...
any questions here first ?
so in RF domain the frequency will be lower when you measure it ?
is it only can measure it lower ?
you can measure RF frequencies which are +/.
oh yeah +/.
+, gigahertz or something like that +...
or you can neglect the Doppler &~ef effect +...
how can you do this in the optical domain ?
any &~oth any other questions +..?
so let's see what happens .
&=erasing_board what was the main problem ?
why didn't it work in the optical domain +..?
which I just erased .
because xxx velocity .
because of the Doppler effect the wipeout .
so we have to do something clever to eliminate the Doppler effect .
the big phase difference is what you're talking about or the big phase ?
the big &~pha the Doppler the large Doppler phase .
and you already know how to do that in some sense +...
how did we eliminate Doppler effects <in the> &~f in the past ?
two photon two .
one is the two photon and the other in in the coherent transient domain what was it ?
essentially used a photon echo +...
right oh .
right ?
so we have to do something similar to that .
so now the idea is +...
&=writes:board that we put in four pulses (0.4) &=writes:board the first two have wave vectors k@l one and the second two have wave vectors k@l two and these are the times T .
I won't go through the details of this calculation but I'll just sketch it very briefly to show you what's going on .
what are the first two pulses giving me for W ?
we've already done that .
it gives me &{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD cosine delta plus k@l one dot V times T .
&}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD .
are we taking k@l one and k@l two to be in opposite ⌈ directions ⌉ ?
⌊ not ⌋ not yet we're just taking (th)em arbitrary &=writes:board alright ?
to get rid of okay .
and what does the second pulse do essentially ?
I put these very close together to indicate that we don't hafta worry about what's going on here .
so the second pulse just gives us another the same type of factor .
the only thing that changes is what ?
it's k@l two .
cosine .
&{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD delta plus k@l two dot V times T +...
&}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD so you look up on the page in your head where you have the cosine identities &=writes:board alright ?
so this is &{l=WRITING_ON_BOARD cosine of delta plus k@l one plus k@l two +...
dot V T over two two delta +...
plus cosine of k@l two minus k@l one over two dot V T &}l=WRITING_ON_BOARD (0.6) now we need the delta why do we need the delta ?
delta equals zero xxx .
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ we want to look at things ⌋ as a function of delta +/.
okay +/.
+, so we want to eliminate the Doppler effect so what the way +//.
is there to eliminate it here ?
by taking k@l one and k@l two to be .
⌈ opposite directions at equal magnitude ⌉ .
⌊ opposite directions at equal magnitude ⌋ so if we take k@l one equals minus k@l two +...
&=writes:board the Doppler phase goes away and we get a Ramsey fringe signal in the optical domain +...
now remember now we have &=writes:board this factor e@l to the minus two gamma t@l and in the optical domain if we want to make T large what's gonna happen there ?
it's gonna start killing the signal .
so where do you have to work in the optical &~no domain in fact in almost all the experiments on optical Ramsey fringes up to recently were carried out for essentially forbidden transitions transitions which have a &~s a very long lifetime in magnesium or cesium .
they're not strictly forbidden but they're almost forbidden so that they get lifetimes on the order of either microseconds or milliseconds (0.6) and again these were proposed as standards and now people are still working on these transitions in magnesium and cesium .
&-uh no it's calcium and magnesium as standards +...
xxx .
is there a reason why we +//.
the decay factor is different here than it was in the RF ?
it's the same factor except we have two t@l-s &=taps_board .
oh okay .
alright ?
okay .
we're always dealing with the dipoles between the pulses .
now these these experiments were carried out in the eighties and then later on &-uh Christian Borde gave an interpretation of these experiments in terms of atom interferometry .
now this is a somewhat controversial area .
and which I've been involved with a little bit and &~Dor Boris Dubetsky who works with me is &-uh much more emotional about these issues .
&=laughs:S2 .
and I'll come back to it in just a second and tell you why why what the controversy is in terms of atom interferometers .
you could think of this now if we remember those diagrams in terms of recoil we could think of these as two atoms going along different paths because of recoil and then recombining .
so in that context this could be as an atom interferometer .
but to get this result did we ever use anything related to quantization of the center of mass motion ?
not at all .
so in +//.
ultimately or fundamentally this result is not related to quantization of the center of mass motion and it's not related to matter wave interferometry in other words treating the motion of the center of mass motion +//.
center of mass motion quantum mechanically .
you can still use it as an interferometer but it's what we call an internal what we term an internal state it depends on the fact that you have different internal states and you're looking at the interference between those states .
and that'll become a little clearer in just a second .
so this is a way of doing Ramsey fringes doing interferometry as well because &=coughs excuse_me what if anything affects the velocity in here ?
what about the velocity cancellation ?
will it be perfect ?
no .
no so you can measure phase changes due to gravitational effects or rotation and this can serve as a rotation center or a gravitational sensor .
and the experiment's already been done in which that was +//.
&-uh those were measured +...
the question is is it possible to to build an interferometer when we're not so much interested in standards so we're not trying to measure a frequency but we want to have a very long baseline of time so we can carry out an experiment over a long time to get a higher precision +...
if we use the dipole moment what are we always limited by ?
the decay ?
the decay of the dipole <sine state> .
so what's a long time you said we need a long time what do you mean ?
long time the longer the better but let's say we &~c want to get up to seconds or tens of seconds (0.5) what's the only state that stays around for that long a period of time ?
⌈ ground state ⌉ .
⌊ ground state ⌋ .
the ground state .
so we have to build an interferometer of this type that just depends on the ground state .
so let me just sketch again how you can do that &=erases_board now instead of putting in four pulses we only have to put in two pulses &=writes:board but we put in standing waves +...
and then another standing wave (0.4) let's see if you can &~unders get an idea of how this happens in terms of our little diagram &=writes:board here we have time &=writes:board for the first pulse what do we have acting ?
we start at state one and we have both fields think of both traveling wave components acting (0.4) alright this is just a sketch I'm not doing this in detail I'm just trying to give you a flavor for what happens here +...
let's imagine we absorb from this beam let's +//.
and we emit into this beam +...
&=demonstrating_with_hands hm ?
xxx you have to look up if you're gonna see this .
&=laughs:multiple .
you absorb from this beam and then emit into this beam .
how much momentum do we transfer to the atom ?
⌈ two ⌉ .
⌊ K ⌋ ?
two k@l .
two h@l bar K remember because when you absorption you change the sign if we absorb from this beam and then emit it into this beam of_course then that thing would've been zero but by doing it this way how much do we transfer ?
two .
two KV and we can be either in the excited state or the ground state .
if we do this twice how much do we transfer ?
four .
four KV six KV eight KV any even even &~frac even &-uh power of KV .
but let's just look at the two KV to see what happens lowest order of perturbation .
so now and let's assume we're back in the ground state .
where will the diagram +//.
where will the line +//.
what line should I draw now since we've got two KV of momentum what should I draw ?
a line going up at .
two xxx .
two KV &=writes:board with that slope .
but we're still in the ground state (0.4) +/.
what is +/.
+, or the excited state that's it alright ?
you +//.
what is doing in the ground state ?
well <that's a> that's a term remember you go just do it in perturbation theory you start in the ground state you go up to the excited state with one field and back down to +/.
⌈ ah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ the ⌋ ground state with the second field .
so we're back in the ground state amplitude .
alright ?
so we're +//.
we have here a ground state .
so I understand your <by your> picture I think I understand what you're talking about well you're talking about both fields acting at the same time but .
no it's +/.
+, ⌊ one ⌋ I I'm just thinking of not both pulses acting each pulse consists of two traveling wave fields it's a standing wave +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, so they automatically act at the same time it's a standing wave I'm thinking of the standing wave as two traveling waves .
⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ so ⌋ you have standing wave pulses ?
&~th these are two this is a standing wave pulse and a second standing wave pulse .
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but in ⌋ this standing wave pulse you have two traveling wave pulses .
so you're looking at one standing wave .
this is just the first standing wave .
okay alright .
this is just the first standing wave .
&~u .
so you're saying we stay in the ground state but we .
we +/.
+, ⌊ &~ca something ⌋ some probability in the excited state as well but I'm just following the ground state here .
okay .
and now &=marks_on_board what do we do with the second standing wave just as in the photon echo ?
we change it so that it comes back &=writes:board down .
&=writes:board we would hafta actually transfer four KV in that process +/.
⌈ and that's ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to ⌋ change its direction .
that's the second pulse ?
that's the second pulse this is at time T +...
&=writes:board so in the end we've had a Doppler phase in a population .
how do we get a &~Dopu Doppler phase in a population ?
from scattering .
by creating a &~modulatio a spatial modulation .
two K dot R .
and then R goes like R plus VT .
that's two KVT .
and then what've we done by the second pulse ?
we've ?
rephased@n that modulation +...
and now you're sensitive to very small effects because you can use long time scales .
however there's one catch &=addressing_student I'll get your question in a second alright ?
okay +/.
+, the catch is remember when you did that homework problem this week if you did it with the stimulated photon echo &=pounds_desk what's the only time you get a long signal +..?
a signal that will last for a long time ?
when gamma is .
when the system was open &=pounds_desk when gamma two didn't equal gamma one .
so in_order_to get this to work you need an open system .
and that's not hard using magnetic substates you you drive on one transition and it can &~tr spontaneously emit to another magnetic substate .
so that works .
alright now +//.
so +//.
I'm going to stop for a second but you have a question ?
well the diagram you've drawn looks like we're only looking at rho one one .
well you have your rho two two as_well .
yeah okay that's my ⌈ xxx seems like we're ⌉ .
⌊ or you have a rho two two as well ⌋ .
always in the past we're always looked at the difference and now .
here it's the same thing we're still looking at the difference .
where's the second +//.
where is there a line for the second state ?
in the second state ?
we have to +//.
we hafta be &-uh +...
&=writes:board we wanna create rho two two now +...
this picture doesn't work so easily we start in state one (0.6) .
to to go to a three level ?
now I hafta &=writes:board +/.
+, I want to get +/.

+, ⌊ another two that stays in the ground state ⌋ alright so that &-uh I can have &=writes:board I can +//.
I don't know if this is +//.
this is not gonna work so easily in this picture but I have +//.
I can have the same field act and leave me in state two also .
if I have one field act that leaves me one field act and acts again it leaves me in state two .
so I can +//.
to to second order +//.
this is not such a simple picture so let's .
so I guess my .
let me think about that +/.
my +/.
+, for the upper state .
my real question then is if &=erasing_board:S1 this picture doesn't always +//.
if this sort_of diagram doesn't always give us a good idea of which matrix elements .
this does &~i ⌈ in fact ⌉ .
⌊ it tells ⌋ you what one of the +//.
well it doesn't tell you any wrong ones but it doesn't necessarily give you a complete picture right ?
well if I I no I didn't give you a complete picture &=laughs:S2 but I could do it it's just I hafta think about it .
⌈ okay so it's possible to do it ⌉ .
⌊ to get you the rho two two ⌋ remember we did it with the simulator we had both terms as well we had rho two two +/.
yeah +/.
+, and rho one one and I hafta think about it and I'll try to bring it in next time to think of the +/.
+, okay +/.
+, the rho two two .
but it's the rho one one that's critical because that'll last a long time .
now there's another subtle way to open up the system not simply by other magnetic substates .
when you take into account recoil on spontaneous emission that turns out that it also opens up the system for different velocity classes .
so the recoil of the atom &-uh we haven't done this yet but the recoil of the atom opens the system .
so in that case we can get effects here that would be absent when we neglect recoil but are present when we include recoil .
so these effects are intimately related to what ?
to the &=pounds_table quantum nature of the center of mass motion .
and such interferometers in which you need that effect you can really call De_Broglie wave interferometers .
because they really depend on the quantum properties of the center of mass motion .
they they in the limit that h@l bar goes to zero these effects vanish .
where in the other interferometers when you let h@l bar go to zero all the effects still stay around .
they're not intrinsically quantum effects quantum +//.
related to the quantum center of mass .
and we have a collaboration with a group at NYU Tycho Sleator if you came to his talk here he gave the AMO seminar two weeks ago or last week and this is the type of interferometer that they've been looking at in their labs .
and have seen these effects of the quantization of the center of mass motion .
so there's a_lot_of interesting physics here we've just touched on it I just wanted to illustrate that you can use the techniques that you've learned at least not that we didn't look at quantization yet of the center of mass motion but we will you can use the techniques that you've learned to analyze many many situations that are very important +...
any questions on this ?
how do you say consider recoil it's a it's open ?
(0.4) .
&=sighs alright <just a> just a two minute explanation alright ?
&=laughs:S2 when we neglect velocity what do we know about rho one one &=writes:board plus rho two two ?
let's just say we have a two level system .
one .
that's equal to one .
&=writes:board now let's say we put velocity in .
if there's no &~colli if there're no collisions or anything of that sort we still have rho one one of V +...
&=writes:board equals what ?
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ for each ⌋ velocity class equals some number +/.
oh +/.
+, W in order V alright ?
+, yeah +/.
+, alright ?
now when we start to put in we start to put in spontaneous emission and recoil what happens ?
things get a little strange .
when you absorb radiation which way do you recoil +..?
which way does what recoil ?
the atom .
the atom .
you absorb radiation this way +/.
⌈ oh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ the atom ⌋ gets a kick this way .
+, mm +/.
+, but when it emits it which way does it emit it ?
xxx .
it emits it in a_lot_of different directions so we can get a kick another way .
so that this condition &=writes:board no longer holds .
oh +/.
+, alright ?
it's no longer open for each velocity &+s +//.
it's no longer closed for each velocity subclass .
of_course for the whole system it's +//.
the integral is conserved but not each velocity subclass .
but that's not the reason it gives you the effect .
alright ?
that's important but it's not .
it's because we're looking at the interaction of these two fields and you hafta start thinking in terms of quantization of center of mass motion .
remember how many labels do you need when you quantize the center of mass motion ?
remember we did the Wigner functions you don't remember +/.
+, ⌊ but you may ⌋ remember a little .
we need +/.
+, two +/.
+, two we hafta use RR prime RP or PP prime +...
so let's &~st imagine we're using PP prime .
you start with P +...
and if you have this type of interaction Matt what do you add to that ?
to the atom ?
mm .
how many h@l bar k@l-s ?
two .
two ?
two .
so you create a coherence in momentum states .
&=writes:board rho P P plus two h@l bar K .
(0.5) this is no longer a population and in fact if you find that this +...
&=writes:board does not equal a constant .
this is the quantity that you're interested in .
it's not the total population but it's that part that you've created that coherence which gives you spatial modulation of the field +...
xxx because you're only looking for the part that absorbed from this beam emitted into this beam and that means that that gives you a second harmonic e@l to the two IKZ .
which means you have a coherence between P and P plus two h@l bar K .
so these are the types of terms you have to start looking at when you quantize the center of mass motion .
and for these terms it's no longer closed .
alright ?
if you're really interested I can give you some references if you wanna look at it some more as to how this comes about (0.5) <any other questions> any other questions we're sort_of now we're done with the first half of the course which took a little more than half but .
you started by saying this can be used for an atom ⌈ interferometer ⌉ .
⌊ this is ⌋ an this is an atom interferometer now +...
it can be used +//.
it doesn't hafta be in the +//.
if it's an open system it can be used even when you don't hafta quantize a center of mass motion .
if it's a closed system in the absence of recoil the signal will vanish unless you take into account recoil .
and the idea is now remember how do we get our signal ?
whatever Doppler phase we acquired here what hadta happen here ?
you hadta cancel xxx +/.
+, hadta +/.
+, ⌈ cancel ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ cancel ⌋ it .
so if you change the Doppler phase ?
what'll happen to the signal ?
it'll start to get destroyed or at least it can change the phase .
so if the whole thing accelerates ?
you'll change the phase of the relative signal .
if the whole thing accelerates wouldn't it .
if it +//.
it's in a gravitational field +/.
oh ⌈ okay ⌉ &=laughs +/.
+, ⌊ the fringes alright ⌋ ?
alright ?
and that's how you measure the acceleration of gravity .
&~o our new way modern way which is already competitive with the falling interferometers .
&=laughs I thought you were gonna say the falling apple .
&=laughs it's the same idea .
you can also measure rotation rates this way .
it'll again change the velocity and it leads to a phase shift .
and in the experiment I just said when it's the recoil that's important it turns out that the recoil is h@l bar k@l squared over two M because that's just the recoil associated with a photon .
and the wavelength is very well known .
the mass is actually pretty well known .
so that lets you measure h@l bar to better accuracy probably in the &~f near future than had been measured before as_well .
the thing you need the longer the time you can go the more the &~frin the more fringes you can get and the better the precision you can get +...
more fringes meaning that the two ground states are sort_of in phase for longer ?
it's it's that we measure this as a function of some detuning or as a function of of some time separation between the pulses .
we vary this time separation .
alright ?
and then we'll see that &-uh things are periodic with omega K &~t the &~ra the recoil frequency times time .
so each time you move by one over the recoil frequency you get a new maximum or whatever the pattern repeats .
so if you can go out a million waves you could do much better in determining the recoil frequency than if you have one wave .
alright ?
the precision is essentially one over the time of the experiment (0.4) any other questions ?
(0.5) xxx okay you have a question ?
no .
alright .
&-uh of_course I'll do anything to avoid starting the next topic which is a little &=laughs:multiple &=erasing_board more mathematical (0.13) so now we're going to talk about quantizing the field .
now why quantize the field at all ?
where did you learn +//.
when when did you learn about quantizing the field ?
first grade third grade ?
&=laughs:multiple .
fifth .
fifth grade ?
&=laughs:multiple .
<where did you> where did you first learn about quantizing the field ?
&-um .
don't remember &=laughs .
quantum ⌈ mechanics ⌉ .
⌊ you ⌋ don't remember you're too old already +/.
+, see that's what I say it could've been first grade .
quantum mechanics .
and what's &~y why do you quantize the field at all ?
everything else is quantized when xxx &=laughs:multiple .
⌈ well that's that's +//.
actually that's not a bad reason ⌉ you say well everything else is quantized why don't you quantize the field as well for consistency .
the classical field doesn't explain everything ?
and &-uh that's sometimes used as a reason and what &~k doesn't the classical field explain ?
what's the first .
⌊ spontaneous emission ⌋ .
⌈ spontaneous emission ⌉ .
what's the first thing you learn ?
⌊ spontaneous ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ spontaneous ⌉ &~e that's the first thing you learned ?
no it's .
what is the first evidence for a quantized field that most people learn ?
&-uh the photoelastic &-er ⌊ photoelectric effect ⌋ .
⌈ photoelectric effect ⌉ .
yeah .
and of_course that's known that &-uh you can explain the photoelectric effect totally without any reference to photons +...
alright ?
Compton scattering when you think of the particles as photons .
but the Compton scattering experiments the Compton scattering calculations were done with classical fields .
in fact most calculations and most of your life you're dealing with classical fields and you can describe things using classical fields &=wipes_nose excuse_me +...
the only time that it appears that you have to use quantized fields is when ?
when the number of photons is very ⌊ small ⌋ .
⌈ &-uh ⌉ when the number of photons is small when there're just a few photons in the beam +...
but how do you get just a few photons in the beam ?
<turn down the> &~vol turn down the power ?
that doesn't work .
that's the misleading thing in the photoelectric effect +...
what's the only &=knocking_on_desk one guaranteed way to know that you have quote one photon in the beam ?
measure it .
&~n no .
<make one> &=laughs .
you don't know if you measure it you you can .
then you don't have anything .
that's right so you +/.
+, ⌈ don't know what you had before ⌉ right ?
what's a simple way to guarantee it ?
you take one atom .
and you excite it .
you excite it .
xxx .
and you wait a little while .
now what's emitted in that case ?
how can take one ?
how can you take one atom ?
mm +/.
+, that's possible .
you can just you don't hafta even take one atom .
you can focus your your detection apparatus that it covers only one atom say in an impurity people do this single atom spectroscopy .
mm .
alright ?
so you have the +//.
some atoms in a host and you can just focus in on that one atom +...
and you can ways of checking we'll talk about it alright ?
so what happens then what does that atom do ?
what's the normal nomenclature ?
emits a .
emits a photon .
well that's not quite true either .
my my advisor was Willis Lamb and his point was that he said he &~d it's not that he's against the word photons but he thinks it's that people should have to apply for a license to use the word &=laughs:multiple .
and he said most people wouldn't get it &=laughs:multiple wouldn't pass the exam .
now +...
we'll talk about that a little bit as well in other words what is a photon and what does it mean to say a photon the word photon is used all the time but for example it would be more correct to say in that atom case where it emits as it emits into a one photon state of the system .
it's actually not a single photon but a superposition of an infinite number of single photons single infinite number of photon states but it's a one photon state and we'll see what that means also +...
and I'll give you the prescription for quantizing the system as_well .
well we hafta start with some type of classical system that's the normal way that you quantize you look at a classical system and you fudge around a little and you look for some Poisson brackets you look for something you recognize and then you quantize the system .
in the case of the electromagnetic field we have to start with some type of system classical system .
and you already know that for the classical electromagnetic field things will depend on the boundary conditions +...
if you take a boundary condition like this and you try to quantize the field try to find the classical fields in there what will you find ?
a mess ?
problems .
alright ?
even if you take a spherical cavity which is a nice system for using angular momentum states to quantize the field what will you find when you try to quantize those states ?
it's like quantizing in a spherical cavity ?
you get Bessel functions you get all these combinations of Bessel functions and things are not the waves are not transverse you get it's like you're +//.
oh someone was talking about Jackson this is the modes inside of a spherical cavity .
if you take a box then things get a little easier +/.
+, but you still have to worry about the boundary conditions at the say maybe the the edges of the box and what's going on it's not so clear as to what's going on .
the point is no matter what you take for your quantization volume if you let the quantization volume grow to infinity then things won't really depend too much on how you've chosen the quantization volume .
so you might as well take the easiest one possible or one of the easiest ones .
and one of the easiest ones is a periodic boundary conditions .
if you choose periodic boundary conditions it just makes life easier you go on for infinite space but we'll eventually choose periodic boundary conditions so that's the one we'll choose .
however if you're dealing with a real cavity you may not have a choice .
inside a real cavity what will you have to choose ?
whatever xxx .
whatever the modes are of that cavity +/.
mm +/.
+, in_order_to quantize the field .
so quantize field quantize the mode .
this is the way that you never run into trouble .
if you look at the classical &~prop for example if you have a beam splitter which we'll do later on +...
you should include as your system include the beam splitter in your system and quantize the field get the classical modes of the field with the beam splitter in +...
and we'll see how to do that and then you don't run into any problem .
and then you associate with each classical mode some quantized mode .
and that's what we'll be doing .
so that's the pep talk the philosophy and then I go through this .
most of this is in the notes I'm not gonna +//.
it's +//.
as boring at is is for you to look at it on the board it's just as boring &~f for me to go through it on the board .
but I wanna just point out some of the details and remind you of some things you may know or you haven't looked at recently that we'll need for what we're going to be doing .
&=goes_to_board so dealing with infinite space in this case or periodic boundary conditions .
alright &-uh eventually so we Fourier transform any field .
F is any field variable .
the electric field the magnetic field the vector potential something like that +...
and when we do that we find this is F of KT &=writes:board we find that F of minus KT is just the F of KT star .
alright you just substitute in F F of RT remember is real .
so this is the transformation from F of K back to F of R and the Hamiltonian in free space +...
now we'll be dealing with a free field it's just half epsilon zero e@l squared plus c@l squared b@l squared +...
and Maxwell's equations at least &-uh Faraday's law and the displacement law can be written in free space <in the> in the K space in this form .
this would be normally &-uh dell cross E and this would be dell cross B .
but the dell is replaced by K in &=coughs excuse_me in in Fourier space .
so this is the starting point .
now this Hamiltonian &=writes:board looks pretty familiar almost +...
something squared plus something else squared +...
what Hamiltonian do you have where you have something squared plus something else squared ?
harmonic oscillator .
harmonic oscillator p@l squared over two M plus one half KX squared .
so it's tempting to think that I can assign one of these E for example to momentum and X or X to momentum and B to E to XQ and B to momentum and it will look like a harmonic oscillator .
well you can't quite do that because the commutation relations for the field are not the same as the &~commuta or the Poisson brackets for the field are not the same as the Poisson brackets for X and P in the harmonic oscillator .
but for certain boundary conditions it almost works out that way .
so the idea instead of doing that is to use a little trick .
is to use some combinations of E and B and then see if we can get the Hamiltonian written in a new form that also looks quite familiar to you .
so this is what we'll do .
and let me get the definitions correct .
so we need to take alpha +...
&=writes:board of KT which is a vector which is minus I over two N of K times E minus C kappa cross B +...
where kappa is K over K .
kappa's a unit vector .
and these are tildes .
so these are still in in Fourier space .
N is just a normalization .
we can choose it any way we want .
it's just a number we're putting in .
and we'll choose it for some convenience in a few minutes .
I did the calculations carrying it all the way through to show you that there's nothing magical with N but then I I decided that it's not worth all that you know .
you can choose &~any anything you want but it'll just eventually &-uh +//.
everything will scat with N and we choose it in a certain way to give familiar results .
is this in Gaussian unit ?
no everything is &~stan SI .
SI that's the wave of the future right ?
even Jackson's new edition which he's writing &=laughs he's gonna write in SI units &=laughs xxx ?
so everyone will have to buy a new edition .
&=laughs:multiple .
and what we'll also want is alpha star &=writes:board of minus K and T equals I over NK (0.5) E tilde plus C kappa cross B tilde how do we get that ?
remember we use this property of fields in_order_to get that and K changes to minus K so that changes this sign .
so when we do this we can write down the fields &=writes:board E is two I IN times alpha of KT minus alpha star of KT of minus KT (0.4) and B is I N +...
alpha of KT plus alpha star of minus KT +...
(0.8) so these are the fields in terms of these quantities alpha and alpha star &=writes:board which have been introduced because they're gonna lead to something familiar +...
what you notice first of all since we're in free fields what &=writes:board about E B +...
<and alpha> and alpha star ?
they're all perpendicular to ?
⌊ K ⌋ .
⌈ K ⌉ and we'll need to use that (0.6) so now essentially we can write down the Hamiltonian in terms of alpha and alpha star (0.5) here's our Hamiltonian in K space .
so what do you do ?
substitute .
you substitute in and remember when I'm integrating over K what can I always do ?
I can change K to minus K and it doesn't change the integral at all so I can make that substitution when I need to .
so what do you get when you substitute in ?
when I get the e@l squared terms what do I get ?
I get terms like alpha alpha star alpha alpha complex conjugate this time this complex conjugate .
and what do you imagine when I add these together what about the cross terms ?
cancel .
the cross terms cancel .
and what about the contribution from E and B ?
you know <for a> for a plane wave ?
contribution to the energy from the e@l field and the b@l field ?
same &=other_students_nod .
it's the same .
so we're just gonna get a factor of two which will cancel this factor of two and we end up the details of &=writes:board wherever in your head on the sheets &=writes:board so we have now an &=writes:board integral of N of K squared and now we have &=writes:board alpha of KT +...
alpha star +...
of KT let me just use the same notation that they're using here alright and remember when you take +//.
the +//.
when you put in B remember oh this B is wrong this should be kappa cross alpha &=writes:board these are kappa cross alphas in here xxx ?
and that came from using this relationship that we have to take &-uh (0.4) &-uh <if I> if I use the fact that K is perpendicular to &~b to B and E I can +//.
when I invert this I can multiply by K on both sides to get this relationship .
I think you need a C as_well .
there's a C yeah let's see (0.9) &=flipping_pages alright +...
no it's IN over C &=writes:board so it's alpha alpha star plus alpha star alpha .
&=writes:board now why do I do this ?
(0.4) clearly that's just two alpha xxx .
but I'm going to wanna leave it in some type of symmetrized form so that when I try to quantize the system I'm able to quantize it +...
alright ?
so this just comes now and this is dot really &=writes:board these are vectors (0.4) so this is the Hamiltonian that we have &~class everything is classical so far +...
what equation of motion does alpha obey ?
&=writes:board (0.14) .
it just substituted to the next wave .
alright ?
it's just equal &=writes:board to I h@l bar times minus I over two NK times a partial of E with respect to T .
what is that ?
mm K cross B .
IC squared k@l .
the partial (woul)d be IC squared k@l cross B &=writes:board and then we have minus C kappa cross what's the partial of B with respect to T ?
minus IK cross C .
minus IK cross C .
minus IK cross C &=writes:board (0.5) so what does <K cross> K cross E give us ?
dot squared e@l ?
no remember use the <back &+cav row> alright you don't hafta &-er it's K times K dot E .
but what is K dot E ?
it's zero .
zero because K is perpendicular and then you get minus E times K dot K but K dot K is kappa is just .
zero ?
K .
K dot kappa kappa's in the direction of K .
oh .
so it's just K .
so what +//.
without going through all the details what does this term give you just back ?
⌊ E ⌋ .
⌈ E ⌉ .
and what does this term give you ?
E .
K cross B .
E xxx .
no K cross B .
so we're back to what we started with .
kappa cross B and E .
and what's the multiplication factor ?
it's just CK +...
and what is CK ?
omega ?
omega .
so this is just equal to &-um +...
I have to put I h@l bar so this is &=writes:board I h@l bar times minus I omega alpha +...
I'll try to use j@l-s to &~distincti &=writes:board to remind you that it's not the same I as the complex I .
so in other words alpha J dot equals minus I omega J alpha J .
this is the equation for the +//.
in free space for these alphas .
this is totally equivalent to Maxwell's equations this equation for alpha .
and the corresponding equation for alpha star remember there's a +//.
independent quantities .
so I have alpha star &=writes:board since alpha's complex alpha star dot J equals I omega J alpha J +...
these are equivalent to Maxwell's equations .
you can work in alpha space or in E and B space .
so this will now let us quantize the system .
so let's do that and then we'll probably &-uh quit for today but let's at least start with that .
&~ex excuse_me ?
⌊ yes ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ this ⌉ J related to the mode mode or ?
<we haven't yet> we haven't yet quantized remember this is just +//.
everything is totally classical now .
each B and E remember since we're in +//.
using periodic boundary conditions what modes are possible ?
mm it's +/.
all +/.
+, in plane wave .
&~a all plane waves so each K corresponds and we actually hafta introduce some polarization each K corresponds to how many set +//.
independent modes essentially ?
two .
two &~wu you have two independent polarizations .
(0.9) &=erasing_board so let me choose N now mm let me think alright value here +...
&=flipping_pages I wanna choose n@l squared &=writes:board equals h@l bar omega over two epsilon zero times L over two pi cubed .
where L is the length &=writes:board of our quantization volume .
of_course L goes to infinity .
these are the number of modes ?
this is just a normalization factor .
remember it could've been anything .
if you're not happy with this keep the N in the equations all the way through and at the end you can choose anything you want .
I'm just choosing it this way .
so if we put that in what do we find for H ?
&=writes:board it's an integral &-uh &=writes:board h@l bar omega over two epsilon zero L over two pi Q alpha star alpha plus alpha alpha star now I'm taking out the dots but in principle what you should do is put in a polarization for each mode and then dot the epsilons so that this'll be there as_well .
and that's in the notes +...
&=writes:board (0.5) alright .
so this is starting to look familiar .
now what we do is we go over from a +//.
integral to a sum let's use periodic boundary conditions .
so what is KX in this case +..?
in periodic boundary conditions +..?
L ⌊ L ⌋ .
⌈ it's ⌉ two ⌊ pi ⌋ .
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
over L .
two pi NX over L .
so we're &~inter we're interested in the integral &=writes:board of some function of K BK .
let's just do it in one dimension &=writes:board and then we'll see what it is in three dimensions .
so this is &=writes:board essentially F of k@l one delta K plus F of k@l two delta K etcetera .
that's how +//.
that's what we mean by an integral .
mhm .
but what is delta K ?
two pi over L .
it's just two pi over L we just change N by one .
&=writes:board so this is the sum of F of KI times two pi over L .
so that tells us how to go from an integral to a sum .
what do we simply multiply by ?
xxx .
two pi over l@l cubed and we take the sum .
so H now &=writes:board goes to a sum and I hadta put the epsilon zero here so that cancels of +...
one half h@l bar omega J times alpha star J alpha J plus alpha J alpha star J (0.8) it's still classical (0.4) this is the total equivalent to our original Hamiltonian in terms of e@l squared plus b@l squared .
but now what we do &=erasing_board is we notice the following this is a homework problem but I'll do it today anyway (be)cause it's so +...
short we take the partial of A with respect to alpha +...
J &=writes:board what is that ?
it's the .
h@l bar omega &-um J .
h@l bar omega J +/.
J +/.
+, times what ?
⌊ alpha J ⌋ .
⌈ alpha J ⌉ .
alpha J star .
&=writes:board (0.6) but what is alpha J star ?
in terms of alpha J star dot ?
&=writes:board this is just I &=writes:board h@l bar &=writes:board alpha J star dot +...
remember because alpha J star &=writes:board dot is I omega J alpha J star .
so I just solved for alpha J star it's alpha J star dot over I omega J and +/.
⌊ so it should be minus ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ we have a minus ⌉ minus (0.4) well this is starting to look encouraging .
if we now take this whole thing &=writes:board and we take the partial of H with respect to minus I I'm sorry with respect to I h@l bar alpha J star +...
what do we find +..?
that's just one over I h@l bar times h@l bar omega J alpha J .
(0.6) .
the Hamiltonian .
but what does that equal +..?
&=writes:board that's minus I omega J alpha J +/.
mm +/.
+, (0.5) &=writes:board but what is minus I omega J alpha J just simply ?
alpha .
alpha J dot &=writes:board partial of H with respect to one variable equals minus the other variable dot ?
partial with respect to H with the second variable ⌊ equals the first variable dot ⌋ ?
⌈ one's P one's Q ⌉ .
these are what not p@l-s and q@l-s but they're ?
canonical variables .
so we see that alpha J &=writes:board and I h@l bar alpha J star are canonical variables (0.6) so that means their Poisson bracket is unity .
and what's a way of quantizing then ?
you're never guaranteed .
you know you can +//.
it's like differential equations you can do anything you want to quantize the system and if <it works> it works if it doesn't then you find a reason why it didn't work .
xxx ?
&=laughs:multiple but if we take the Poisson bracket and now let it become a commutator ?
what do we have to set then ?
&=writes:board alpha J comma I h@l bar alpha J star +...
now goes to AJ some quantum mechanical operators comma I h@l bar AJ dagger +...
and what must that commutator equal if we use our normal quantization procedures ?
whenever you have the Poisson bracket you set the commutator equal to ?
I H ⌊ bar ⌋ .
⌈ I h@l bar ⌉ &=writes:board so what does that tell us ?
that AJ comma AJ dagger equals one .
and that's why we <trook the> took the N the way I did so that you end up just getting this value from the commutator if not you would get a different value and all the equations would be scaled by N wouldn't make a difference +...
so this is the fundamental commutator relationship and again of_course the A I comma AJ dagger equals delta IJ .
not the same mode you get +//.
the commutator vanishes .
so &~w .
so what do you change to A A is &-uh alpha ?
A would change from the classical variables alpha now +/.
oh +/.
+, to quantum mechanical operators alpha A and A dagger .
that's how we make the transformation .
+, mm +/.
+, that's the normal way of &~cn of quantizing to each classical variable we associate a quantum mechanical operator .
so that's what we're doing and now we can write our Hamiltonian &=erasing_board don't need this any more (0.4) H &=writes:board equals one half sum of h@l bar omega J AJ dagger AJ plus AJ AJ dagger (0.5) which is the sum of h@l bar omega J AJ dagger AJ plus a half .
&=writes:board (0.6) well what &~h Hamiltonian is this are you familiar with this ?
harmonic ⌊ oscillator ⌋ .
⌈ harmonic ⌉ oscillator Hamiltonian so that we know how to deal with this harmonic oscillator potential Hamiltonian and we know how to get the Eigen states .
what are the Eigen states for this Hamiltonian ?
now I &~do I &~wo don't want to go through and bore you but I'll remind you how do you deal with this Hamiltonian do you remember what you did in quantum mechanics ?
to get the Eigen state to this Hamiltonian ?
do the raising and lowering .
yeah and how did you do that &~y that's right .
how did you do the raising and lowering you remember ?
this is something to remember that's why I wanna remind you of this if you don't remember it .
what do you mean ?
how did you get the raising and lower operators ?
what did you consider ?
the outer xxx levels .
the outer xxx levels or even the phase xxx .
&=writes:board you take HA minus AH +...
and what is that equal to ?
let's just take a single mode .
<partial AP> .
what's the commutator of H with A ?
let's take a single mode &=writes:board so let's say H equals h@l bar omega A dagger A plus a half .
what's H comma A ?
&=writes:board .
xxx .
yeah xxx .
just do it .
oh &=laughs .
it's A dagger first of all a half commutes with A you don't hafta worry about that .
mm +/.
+, A dagger A .
squared ?
A dagger A comma A what is that ?
(0.9) .
it's been a long time .
&=laughs let's see .
it's been a long time at least &-uh +...
remember how to do this you take one xxx out to this side you take this out to this side +/.
yeah +/.
+, a comma A is zero +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, when you take this out you get A dagger ⌊ comma A ⌋ .
⌈ I can't &~remem ⌉ &~i A dagger A is one +/.
⌊ hm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ or ⌉ is it minus one ?
A dagger A is .
A A +/.
⌊ ah okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ dagger ⌉ is one .
so it's ⌊ minus A ⌋ .
⌈ minus A ⌉ &=sigh:S2 .
alright ?
so what does that mean ?
if I look at H A minus A (0.5) operating on A in other words I can call this whole operator a new operator N +...
right ?
and I could +//.
I don't hafta do that but I could say H operating on an Eigen ket@n &=writes:board N let me not call that N H operating on Eigen ket@n N equals h@l bar omega N plus a half N .
this is perfectly general N could be anything it doesn't hafta be an integer at this stage it's just any number I'm just writing it in this formal +//.
in this way parameterizing it .
so if I write HA minus AH operating on a state N what is that equal to ?
N xxx .
xxx .
minus A operating on N +...
but what is H operating on N ?
parameter .
H bar omega N plus a half .
mm hm .
so if I end up I look and I find &=writes:board that HA operating on N from this term I bring this to the other side I get simply &=erasing_board_then_writing_again this is equal to N minus one plus a half A N from this +...
alright ?
but what does this imply ?
(0.6) what does this imply ?
this is you're supposed to have had this &~w this is your harmonic ⌊ oscillator .
alright ⌋ ?
⌈ that's the ⌉ Eigen state of H .
AN is an Eigen state of H with an Eigen value .
of N minus one .
N minus one .
so what does that mean ?
that means AN &=erasing_board AN &=writes:board is just some constant times N minus one .
and similarly if I look at the commutator of H and A dagger I get a raising operator and I find that A dagger operating on N equals some CN prime times N plus one +...
xxx ?
and then I can look at A dagger A if I take the if I take this times its adjoint ?
what do I get ?
number xxx .
I get &=writes:board NA dagger AN equals CN squared times one N minus one times N assuming they're normalized .
but what is this simply ?
number .
gives me the number operator N so this just gives me N .
so that &=writes:board CN equals the square root of N CN prime equals the square root of N plus one .
so this is what AN xxx I assume this is familiar to most of you at some point even if you don't want to admit it &=laughs:multiple that these are the raising and lowering operators and this is what the raising and lowering operators do to the kets@n N and N +//.
to the ket@n N .
and then what's the next step ?
E is positive definite because it's written as h@l bar omega A dagger A plus a half so you know that all the Eigen values hafta be what ?
xxx .
positive .
&=pounds_table greater than zero .
so you keep on applying A the operator A until you get down to the lowest Eigen value hasta kill it and that shows you that the &~la lowest Eigen value is +//.
hasta be N equals zero and that N hasta be an integer otherwise things wouldn't work .
so you end up finding that the <Eigen kets@n> of this Hamiltonian can be written simply as N where N equals zero one two etcetera .
and these now in the case of the harmonic &~oscill harmonic oscillator what were they called ?
these states ?
number states .
number states .
alright ?
in the case of the radiation field what are these states called now ?
photon states ?
photons +...
N means the number of photons in a given mode of the field +...
so this is the quantization procedure you get a classical box you find the classical modes and to each classical mode you essentially apply an A_H_Bar omega A dagger A in the Hamiltonian +...
so let's stop here we now you can review this if you've forgotten it before next lecture but I +//.
next time what I'll do is I'll start to talk about some properties of these photon states and we'll talk about what are called coherent states I'm not going to do the phase operator in any detail .
the phase operator's in the notes and Mandel knows more about &~pha a_lot more about phase operators than I do .
and he's worked on that extensively so if you look in Mandel and Wolf he has both which I'll talk about the Pegg_Barnett definition of the phase operator and what he's developed himself which are called operational measures of the phase operator which disagree somewhat from the Pegg_Barnett but there's a discussion in his book about that .
after that I'll talk about coherent states and then we'll talk about two photon coherent states or squeeze states as they're called .
okay ?
so does your +//.
well this is just a side question you were talking about .
excuse xxx .
well one question at a time alright ?
you were talking about how &-uh the &-uh your advisor said that .
Lamb said that you need a license &~t .
right xxx hasta do with +//.
does that have to do with coherent states ?
that hasta +//.
well the coherent states are strange states what it hasta do with +//.
people talk about photons +/.
yeah +/.
+, but you rarely ever if you had a single photon state here it would be in all of space +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, it could +//.
it couldn't interact with any <of the other> +/.
+, oh okay +/.
+, so what Lamb I think would agree to is that the proper way to +//.
what you call a photon are the corresponding excitations of the corresponding classical modes of the boundary value problem .
+, alright +/.
+, if you associate with each of those modes something a quantum excitation which are called photons you never have any problems .
+, oh alright +/.
+, Simi you had another question ?
&-uh yeah how do you got C equal square root of N ?
here ?
yeah .
well A dagger A is just N .
oh .
operating on this alright ?
we know what A +...
A dagger A is just remember <this is H> &=writes:board this is H +/.
⌊ oohhhh@i ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ minus a ⌉ half alright ?
+, oh +/.
+, and we know what H does to the state +/.
+, &-uh huh +/.
+, it just means N +...
it'll give us N plus a half +/.
+, okay +/.
+, and then we'll subtract off the half (0.6) &=addressing_different_student alright now I'm supposed to be meeting with you and Simi today now there's a faculty meeting if you wanna come by at one are you free at one today +..?
+, &-um yeah +/.
+, alright if you both come by at one I can talk to you about your project and I can talk to you about your +//.
+, homework +/.
+, your homework +...
&=micaserelated_speech .
now we're gonna relate the raising and lowering operators to D and B next time ?
next time we'll just write +//.
remember we've already done that .
because alright it's off off the board now but <we wrote> we wrote E in terms of alpha and alpha star .
yeah but the E and B there were still classical .
they were kind_of a +//.
all +//.
the only thing we hadta do is replace the &-uh alpha by A and the alpha star by A dagger .
and they still +//.
I mean nothing really changes between the sort_of classical B and E .
no that's how we go from them there there are changes but that's how we go from a classical E +/.
⌊ oh okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ and B ⌉ to a a quantized E and B by replacing the A and A dagger and we'll see that for example the energy in the field of vision you're gonna appear in the vacuum state .
+, which is not the case in a classical field .
so there are a_lot_of embarrassments &=laughs:S5 alright ?
that occur when you use this definition .
and who knows if a hundred years from now we'll have the same &-uh you know vacuum still poses a a_lot_of &~pobl problems people have tried to avoid this by other techniques but none of them &-uh successful .
haven't people tried to actually tried to get into the vacuum entity experimentally ?
well you can never measure the infinite <xxx you're> always measure differences right ?
right .
(be)cause xxx snapshot .
but utilize the vacuum .
you can utilize the vacuum but that that's you know this is all that's all hype I mean you're inside a cavity you have vacuum fields and you can see the effects on an atom and you send it in you get a force on an atom and things like that so the Casimir &~fill forces are usually +/.
right +/.
+, referred to <as a> as a &-uh indication of its &-uh totally quantum mechanical effect so that may be some justification .
you have to look effects don't disappear as h@l bar goes to zero +/.
+, right +/.
+, the &{l=SIC Casimar &}l=SIC Casimir effect is one such effect you're modifying the vacuum by putting it in plates and it causes a force +/.
+, oh right right right +/.
+, between the plates .
but &-uh I haven't thought about that enough I'm still it seems to me +...
and there +//.
and there's a whole group that +//.
it's not so popular anymore but there's a whole group of people who claim that all the quantum properties of the fields are always related to quantum properties of an atom rather than the field so that sorry for the atoms remember we said if we excited one atom it would emit a single photon state .
but it +//.
it's really the +//.
the property of that field is related to the fact that we started with a quantized atom .
so <there are> there are theories oh I don't know if we'll get there this semester but what you can do is you can eliminate the fields you can eliminate the &-uh the &~fie the the vacuum field in some sense and write the electric field totally in terms of say atomic operators .
and that's &~what .
that's what's +/.
⌊ I <need help> ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ called ⌉ source field that's called source field theory and but these are quantized operators so that you represent the quantized electric field in terms <of the> of the &-uh atomic operators and that shows you that all the quantum properties of the field are in some sense related to the quantum properties of the atoms .
&-uh are +//.
<can you> can you spend any time or are we gonna spend any time talking about that because that's what I that's the piece I I seem to be missing to understand why coherent +//.
you mentioned that coherent states have to do with the absorption I think well at least we talked about it in in field theory or whatever we call it the quantum mechanics xxx it was confusing me at first why why you'd be interested in an operator that doesn't have Eigen values +...
you mean coherent states that's ⌊ something else .
&~but ⌋ .
⌈ coherent states .
but ⌉ is doesn't that relate to ⌊ absorption ⌋ ?
⌈ yeah ⌉ it does relate to it but coherent states are these weird things I mean Glauber when he invented them or used them at least in said you know people were very skeptical .
and &-uh but what you can show is if you have any classical current distribution it generates a coherent state in the field .
well maybe it'll be more +//.
maybe +//.
maybe it'll make more sense ⌊ when we talk about it next time ⌋ .
⌈ but we'll talk about coherent ⌉ states as difference I mean we'll talk about what a coherent state is simply defined such I'll do next time +/.
yeah +/.
+, such_that its expectation values give you the classical field values .

+, alright ?
that's that's the way it's defined so that it's as close to a classical field as we can make it by demanding that it's xxx but when we demand that we see that it has a very strange property that that the <they're defined by the annihilation operator &~op &~ap anything under coherent state> .

&-uh yeah that's what I need help with ⌊ so ⌋ .
