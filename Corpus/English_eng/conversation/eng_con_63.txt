Jimmy and Bob were friends in their early years about age twenty .
Jimmy Bob left New_York to go to the West, .
to seek his fortune .
Jimmy would not leave New_York .
<after twenty> they had made an arrangement then that they would
after twenty years had passed, Jimmy went to the spot
while waiting a police officer showed up .
and was checking each of the doors to each stores on the block .
when he saw Jimmy .
when he saw Bob .
he started talking with Bob .
and Bob told him why he was there .
and he had this appointment with Jimmy a friend of twenty years .
so he was awaiting .
they exchange arguments for a little while .
and then police left .
and asked him how long he would be there .
Bob told him he would be there for at least a half hour more .
because based on the Jimmy he knew, he knew he would be there as
shortly thereafter someone came from across the street and asked
and inquired of Bob .
if is that was he .
Bob answered yes .
and asked the person if he was Jimmy .
and they came together .
they started talking about the events of twenty years before .
after recollection they were there talking .
and Bob noticed that the face he saw was not the Jimmy who he
and he had his doubts, .
but Jimmy assured him that he had changed a little over time .
it transpired that Jimmy was not really the Jimmy who Bob knew .
but, as it turned out that Jimmy was a colleague of the police
and he then had seen that Bob was some wanted convict .
and because of their friendship as youths he was not able to make
so he got his friend and colleague to pose as if he was Jimmy .
and subsequently make the arrest .
about thirty years ago I worked with these two guys .
one we called Chungy .
and the other we called Boo .
it was this particular Saturday .
we did shift work .
and there was weekend work at the place .
so this particular Saturday we were working .
and Chungy normally ate a_lot .
and Boo was equal to the task .
and just because we were friends I did not want to be left out of
and did not want to be left out of things .
so at that point I used to eat a_lot also .
so we got together to buy some food, .
and decided to cook .
so we decided to cook .
because we were working all day Saturday into the night .
so at about five o'clock we decided to cook some food .
and we did some very large dumplings .
and we bought some canned +//.
and curried goat used to be sold in cans at the time .
and what was very important at the time was that if you were making
you used to make it very big .
I mean something bigger than .
about the size of your palm .
or there about .
so we had this thing where we cooked the dumpling .
and we did the curried goat .
but the curried goat there was a_lot_of gravy with the curried goat
so after we ate the dumpling and curried goat there was a_lot_of
so at this time I was filled and by all accounts we should
but, Chungy looked at the gravy .
and he looked at Boo .
and he said .
Boo we can't allow all this gravy to go to waste .
and Boo didn't answer .
so Chungy said let's get the two shilling bread then .
it was like two shillings at the time was for a bread .
probably about two pound of bread in today's terms .
so we went to the little grocery store .
and got the bread .
so all three of us ate off that big bread after having eaten
just to avoid throwing away the gravy .
and that's pretty much what happened then
