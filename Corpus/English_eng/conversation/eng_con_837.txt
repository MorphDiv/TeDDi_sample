<he &-um> he'll sit there and when he's funny he's really nice
but all of a sudden he'll change and <he will> <I dunno
+< yeah .
and he'll use that to annoy them because he finds it funny .
+< yeah .
and then &-um if he gets in trouble with someone who he's annoyed ,
yeah .
he's just 0 .
&-um <he'll pick> yeah he'll keep picking things out_of
