Like I said twenty miles an hour that . 76293_79723
That 's a ai n't it so . 79733_81883

Course it would . 110613_110963
Yeah course it fucking would . 111063_112133
Like I said nine out of ten if I touch my brakes they 'll drop back
Well there 's plenty of things you can do to make them drop back .
Yeah stupid things Like slam on your brakes or going slow If you
Why why why is he . 138213_139213
speed if you 're doing it in a . 139213_139803
Why is . 139803_140503
if you 're doing . 140563_141052

But have you ever heard of an ob obstructive speed If you 're if
No . 147303_147363
if you 're obstructing the flow of traffic by doing twenty in a
0 .
But like I said if it if you if you do that then it 's for them and
How can it be a psychological though . 179653_182593
Cos they they they 've obviously not made sense to realise that a
Yeah . 198563_198743
stupid . 198743_198843
That 's what I 'm saying so there 's no psychological over . 198853_203583
Cos if if you show them that we 're not they 're not getting at you
Yeah that 's right they ai n't getting at me I 'm getting at them I
No they 're ca n't you see by retaliating they are getting at you
Yeah but seen that yeah . 222553_223353
come up and insult you if it does n't bother you you wo n't say a
Yeah . 230453_230803
Exactly So if you do n't react at all .
I ca I ca n't get out of that car and say you 're a fucking wanker
No . 241973_242193
yeah but . 242263_242483
well . 242483_242563
the only way that I can retaliate towards him to show him my
Do n't you see by ha do n't you see by not retaliating you 're
Yeah that 's right . 264993_265713
The same thing if somebody 's annoying you like that ignore them
No see nine times out of ten .
but . 284843_284923
they 're fucking wankers . 284933_286223
But they are wank that .
But you know . 287003_287403
but if they are wankers nothing you do and including I mean I 've
Yeah exactly and tha that 's when you slam .
0 .
your anchors on and they 're in the fucking wall . 301403_303373
But you 've caused an accident . 303373_305183
Yeah as simple as that yeah I mean you 've caused an accident . 305383_308733
So you soo .
but . 309133_309303
been driver . 309383_310063
No cos I have n't caused an accident because they are in the wrong
I know that I know that Mark But you would rather go through all
Yeah . 324783_324843
and all this just for the sake over a bit of retaliation . 324843_327873
No I would n't go as far as that anyway but I 'm saying they 're in
There is . 334283_334413
the . 334673_334853
there is no law saying that they ca n't drive that close to you you
Yeah exactly and then it 's their their . 341293_344423
But then again yo you 're you 're advised against going over the
Yeah . 377663_377723
and I did n't so much I just thought that it happened to me . 378013_381823
I think you should get . 381823_382443
a couple of times you know people were up my arse a couple of times
I think that it 's that 's very very rude Bad driving . 386063_390003
Oh yeah but can .
That somebody should be right up your arse so if you . 391013_393493
Oh it 's not good . 393493_394013
that . 394013_394413
driving no I 'm not . 394433_394863
that that . 394863_395103
saying that . 395133_395393
that 's the way I look at it and . 395403_396673
But you ca n't you see that . 396673_398073
you you just show them something to back off as you say and my way
Like I said I 've slowed down in the past for people like that and
Well if they do n't then you slow right down again simple as that .
So that 's affecting your journey . 417073_418983
No it is n't Not really my i idea of a journey is to get there in
I do n't speed everywhere . 428403_428893
it 's better than fucking better be being late than not being there
Ca n't you that by retaliating yo .
No I ca n't . 437003_437523
you 're interrupting your own journey as well .
No I ca n't sorry you 're on the lost cause here . 439383_444893
Obviously I mean do n't get me wrong . 447573_448443
If so if somebody is a bad enough driver to sit right up your arse
But I I do agree with you slowing down probably does annoy them
Yep . 467543_467683
but then again I 'd rather just let them get on with it I 'm not
There no fucking better way of doing things is there . 480393_482723
But I do if you listen . 482773_483443
Just that it 's different way of dealing with it . 483443_485303
If you listened Mark without interrupting I was just about to say I
It 's a stu .
different way of doing things Alright yeah . 495603_497423
Yeah but you interrupted . 497423_499773
Yeah exactly cos there 's not a better way of doing as far as I 'm
No if you listened I was n't gon na say that This is why you and
0 .
at the end of the day it does n't really make no odds as long as I
Yeah . 537543_537773
maybe touch the brakes and you back off yeah . 537833_539773
No no I I do n't do that i I I I get to within about ten feet on
That 's still too close . 548513_549603
Oh yeah it 's too close . 549603_550473
But do n't . 550863_551023
Ah . 551023_551103
you do n't you mean sometimes they touch they 're brakes . 551103_553023
I mean as I as I get a . 553023_553793
and you realise ooh shit I 'm a bit too close here back off .
No as as I 'm going towards them I start touching my brakes anyway
Yeah . 559773_559833
and I do n't give any of this shit with lights If they 're doing
Yeah . 573593_574013
attempt to go past . 574013_574613
No I 'm not I 'm not saying that hav have n't you found yourself a
No not really . 578103_578413
you just find yourself up someone 's arse without realising it . 578413_584783
Not unless I 'm doing it deliberately . 584783_587013
No I know . 587013_589163
About fifteen twenty foot all the time . 589163_592053
That 's too close . 592063_593263
No it 's not they reckon you should leave a two second gap if yo if
Here have you got your erm highway code here What are the braking
Three . 607073_607333
seventy five a hundred . 607333_609883
thirty five . 610103_611003
Seventy five in n it . 611333_613563
What thirty Say thirty . 613563_614283
Thirty is seventy five . 616733_617853
Yeah four foot . 618853_619783
0 .
So it 's thirty by seventy five alright by is thirty five . 619933_633503
In which case fifteen or twenty foot is far too close . 633503_635823
Okay it 's too close but how many how many cars travel any further
I certainly do . 641963_643483
Oh right . 643483_644393
And tha that is one thing I 'm I mean I 'm not I 'm not the best
Yeah exactly the back of too many fucking cars . 655973_659583
And you still s dri driving fifteen or twenty foot away .
Eh well that was just a fucking example . 662023_665793
Well I mean I yeah alright . 665793_666683
I d I do n't know how .
Yeah . 667683_667713
far I drive away from them it could it could be twe .
But you would you think it 's enough though . 669653_671473
it could be twenty foot it could be thirty foot it could be forty
Yeah . 684843_685183
And the only way you can do that is when you judge when you know
0 .
0 .
Mm . 689373_689463
What 's that . 689713_690413
I said what really bugs me is when I 'm driving and you come from
Yep . 702713_703143
Yeah they come right up . 703303_705473
Yeah but mind you . 705473_710393
