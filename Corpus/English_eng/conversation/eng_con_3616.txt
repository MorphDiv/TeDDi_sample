there once was a boy who had a dog and a frog .
one day when he was sleeping the frog got out .
he woke up .
and he looked around .
he saw that the cage was empty .
he searched in his boots .
the dog got his head caught .
and then he looked out the window .
the dog fell out the window and broke the bowl .
the boy jumped out the window .
they went into the woods and called him .
the dog was chasing bees .
and the dog knocked down the bee hive .
and the boy's looking .
out came an owl .
and the dog ran away from the bees .
the boy climbed up a rock .
and he looked .
and then a deer came up .
and he got caught in his antlers .
and the deer is chasing the dog to the edge of a cliff .
and they both fall in to the water .
then they heard something .
he told the dog to be quiet .
and then they saw two frogs .
and then out came a bunch of baby frogs .
one of them was his frog .
and he got the little frog and waved goodbye .
the boy called frog .
and the dog looked down .
www .
he's sad .
www .
the frog is hiding under the log .
the boy is sitting down smiling happily at a frog and a dog .
the dog poked his head in the little thing and sniffed at the frog
one night when the boy was sleeping the frog wanted to go out and
so he hopped out_of the cage and went outside somewhere to play .
the boy and the dog woke up .
the boy is feeling very sad and missing his frog .
he is very very eager to find his frog .
and the dog is still smelling the frog in the bowl .
and he popped his head in there .
he went out the window calling frog frog !
and the dog had the jar over his head .
and then the dog fell .
and then the boy was puzzled .
and then he came out there and was really mad at the dog .
and the dog just licked him .
how did this happen ?
the dog fell and broke the glass .
the boy went out to the woods and started calling for his frog .
the dog smelled the bees going to the bee hive .
the boy looked in the hole hoping the frog was in there .
and the dog boinked himself trying to get the bee hive .
then an animal popped out .
the boy was quite surprised .
the dog is barking at the bee hive and scratching .
why does he have his hands on his nose ?
he's about to sneeze .
and is he saying anything there ?
no .
and the dog is scratching on the tree trying to get the bee hive .
<then the dog> then the bee hive fell down .
then the boy is hoping his frog is in the hole .
the dog is running away from the bees .
was saying anything when he looked in there ?
frog are you in there ?
he climbed up a rock .
he was a little scared that the owl was hooting around him .
then he climbed up on the top of a rock and called out frog
then the deer popped out_of nowhere and caught him on his antlers .
and then the deer chases him .
the boy was scared then .
and then they both fell off the cliff and fell into the water .
and they heard a frog going ribbit ribbit !
so why does he have his hand up there ?
he's listening .
the boy crept up the side of the log and looked over it .
he saw a mom and a dad frog just sitting there .
and then all of a sudden the little frogs hopped out !
and one of them was his frog .
so he got his frog .
how does he feel ?
happy .
and then he got his frog and waved goodbye .
but one little frog is still behind the log .
and is he saying anything here ?
bye
