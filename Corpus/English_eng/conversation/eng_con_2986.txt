mathematicians, do you remember on Friday how we were working with playing cards ? 1965_6445
we were decomposing seven, eight, and nine . 6605_9245
do you remember that ? 9385_9985
yeah . 10385_10645
and I put up some of the work that we finished up with at the very end of math workshop from last time . 11025_16625
I put up S_two's work over here, and S_three's work over here, and we were ending math workshop last time with a really interesting observation . 16725_26345
we were learning, or we had noticed that the way that S_two decomposed seven, we were like, wait a second . 27325_33305
S_two, where's your group of three ? 33845_34725
do you remember ? 34825_35265
can you come and show us where the group of three is, please ? 36285_40385
come on up . 40505_40965
in the nine . 41585_42285
yeah, I'm hearing some words . 42965_43925
let's see if S_two remembers . 44065_45065
where's your group of three ? 47925_50025
come on over . 50225_50765
you can count them . 52165_53285
you want to double check ? 53785_54605
one +... 56085_56485
come on over . 57105_57785
all the way . 58085_58365
one, two, three . 60865_61185
so we noticed that your group of three was over there . 62425_64065
is that what you were saying, S_four ? 64145_65025
mm-hmm .
and then when we were looking at S_three's work, where was S_three's group of three ? 65145_69225
do you see it, S_two ? 69905_70805
yeah .
you can say it's right here ? 70925_72565
it's right there .
would you count and make sure to prove it to us ? 72725_75365
one, two, three . 75625_76405
I remember that, too . 78545_79125
so I remember that +... 79525_80865
thanks . 81445_81485
would you go back to your spot please ? 81525_82625
we were definitely taking a look at these two different decompositions and we were thinking to ourselves . 82965_87485
whoa, the groups are in different places, but the numbers are the same: how can that be ? 88605_92605
and I told you that we were going to start off math workshop today by talking about that exact same thing . 93045_97385
so, mathematicians, today we're going to be working on decomposing ten . 98045_101405
I want you to take a look up here, just with your eyes right now, and think in your smart brain, what do you notice about these decompositions ? 101565_109645
how are they the same or similar and how are they different ? 110445_114045
so think again in your brain . 114365_115545
what do you notice ? 117985_118565
how are they the same and how are they different ? 118805_121985
and I'm going to give you about ten seconds to do some thinking, okay ? 122465_125405
so S_two has her eyes up here . 125485_126605
she's doing some thinking . 126745_127665
S_five is also doing some thinking . 128585_130985
he's noticing what's the same or similar and what's different . 131145_133465
that's the second reminder . 134445_135265
thank you .
and in a moment, I'm going to invite you to share what you're noticing with a friend sitting next to you . 143855_148015
you're going to tell them . 148495_149435
I notice or something that's similar or something that's the same is something that's different is +... 150095_155875
please turn and tell something you're noticing to a person sitting next to you . 156835_159355
xxx .
can you finish up your conversations, please, and turn back this way ? 196825_199725
thanks . 200965_201045
finish up your conversations and turn back this way . 201205_203765
I was hearing a lot, S_two and S_six, of really smart math ideas . 204325_208685
can we just hear from a few friends about what they were noticing ? 209125_211705
S_seven xxx .
okay S_seven, what were you noticing ? 214905_224025
I noticed it +... 224525_224925
would you please come on up so you can communicate with us and we can see your face ? 224925_228465
I noticed that they're the same because that one and that one are the same . 229305_234965
say more about how they're the same, please . 235165_236785
because they're eight . 236925_238025
they're eight . 238185_238865
S_six, what is S_seven saying ? 239005_240265
S_seven's saying that they're the same because there's eight . 240865_249005
do you want to ask your friend, is that what you're saying ? 250005_251305
is that what you saying ? 252565_252965
yes . 253265_253405
S_seven, that was part of what I heard you saying . 253965_255865
would you show us where the two eights were that you were talking about, please ? 256065_259725
there were +... 260665_261225
come on over . 261325_261765
show us, please . 262105_262665
because I want to make sure that S_six and the other friends are really hearing what you're saying . 263225_266185
sorry, one of the eights is ? 266345_267845
this one, and the other one is this one . 269065_272805
can we double check to make sure that it's eight ? 272905_274665
let's find out . 274765_275345
help us count please . 275505_276165
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight . 276985_283545
do we agree that's eight ? 284025_284625
yeah . 285025_285325
S_five .
do you agree that's eight ? 285765_286445
don't you think that should count them, too ?
let's try the other one first . 286645_290345
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight . 290725_296785
so S_six, what's your friend, S_seven, saying ? 296985_298625
S_seven is saying +... 299085_300945
S_seven says they're the same because there's eight . 307115_308375
there's eight +... 308955_309535
there's eight .
there's eight and eight . 313475_314975
there's eight and eight . 315135_315935
and I'm hearing S_eight say, what about the two ? 316015_317475
what about the two, S_eight ? 317595_318515
we should count it . 318955_320715
we should count it ?
yeah . 321075_321375
one +... 322215_322595
two, three +... 324215_324535
two +...
we should count the whole thing first . 324835_326835
we should count that . 327355_328695
and then after that, we can count that and then we'll count it all together . 328975_334815
it sounds like we'll do a lot of counting and we'll find out how many there are all together . 335155_338035
let's double check and make sure that the other group is a group of two on both cards . 338275_341175
are you okay with that ? 341335_341955
all right, S_seven, be our pointer please . 342195_343875
one, two . 344535_346435
one, two . 347235_348035
so both cards have eight and both cards have two . 349495_352695
both cards have eight and both cards have two . 352895_354735
thanks, S_seven, for explaining that to us . 355175_356755
I'm wondering what other mathematicians are noticing ? 356975_359235
xxx .
TCH .
pass, please . 365115_365655
S_three .
my friend S_three, what are you noticing ? 365915_372235
I notice +...
let's show listening and respect . 373015_376235
we can turn our eyes towards our friend S_three, S_four . 376435_378115
I notice that the two hearts have the same places, but they're different . 378695_389075
they're not in the same place, but they have the same number . 389985_393385
that sounds really important . 393705_394725
can you say it one more time ? 394925_396165
but they're +... 397565_398725
so something with the two of hearts ? 398745_399925
the two hearts are not in the same place, but the number is in the right spot . 400185_407225
oh my gosh . 407905_408505
I think I'm hearing a really, really important idea . 408865_411705
is there somebody who can repeat what their friend S_three said ? 411825_413845
either in his words or in their own words ? 414105_415845
S_nine ?
you gave us a quiet hand right away . 416735_417975
can you say what your friend S_three just said ? 418155_419635
this is really important . 420035_421075
S_three said they're the same numbers, but they're not in the same group . 421535_426655
do you want to ask him, is that what you said ? 428015_429155
that what you said ? 429795_430275
is that ? 430395_430935
is that what you said ? 431355_432675
no . 432875_433195
I said that the hearts were in a different place and the numbers were in the same place . 434195_447275
hang on . 448175_448395
we got a little confused there . 448895_450035
we have to be really precise here, right ? 450535_452855
let's make sure we're really attending to precision here . 452895_455555
okay ? 455975_456015
what are you saying is different about the two ? 456215_458595
two are in the right spot . 460575_463155
they are in the same spot or in a different spot ? 463395_465755
they're in the right spot . 466315_468255
they're in the right spot . 468595_469715
sure .
but are they in the same spots or are they in a different spot ? 469995_473255
is this two, right here, in the same spot as the two over here or in a different spot ? 473475_479075
in a different spot . 479515_480175
okay . 480195_480635
so the twos are in +... 480715_481755
the two are in a different spot . 482195_483735
but the number ? 483975_484975
the numbers are in same spot . 485455_487675
are the same . 487975_488655
the numbers are the same . 489255_490415
do you want to ask S_nine to repeat what you were saying one more time ? 490455_492735
S_nine, can you repeat it ? 495235_497575
can you repeat it ? 497595_498175
S_three said the hearts are in the different place and the numbers are on the bottom are on the right way . 498915_511915
they are the same ? 512035_512735
they are the same . 513195_514015
do you want to ask S_three is that what you were saying ? 514075_515755
is that what you were saying ? 516125_517105
yes . 517445_517565
okay . 517685_517845
so S_nine, what do you think about that ? 518025_519485
do you agree with S_three ? 519705_521025
do you disagree ? 521145_521785
what are you thinking ? 521965_522465
I agree with him . 523105_524425
I agree with S_three . 524885_526725
can you come on up please and tell us why you agree ? 527225_528965
how do you know that the twos show the same number, even though they're in different places ? 529505_533965
let's turn our eyes towards S_nine, okay . 534045_535605
go ahead and turn your body towards your friend S_nine . 535685_536985
because they're two on the bottom and they're two right here . 539795_544415
they make two because +... 545355_547675
one, two . 548415_549115
one, two . 549895_549995
that's how S_three knows there were two hearts . 551555_556175
is that how you knew that there were two hearts ? 556675_557955
yes . 558375_558715
that sounds really important . 558855_560055
thanks for explaining that to us . 560295_561455
I'm wondering if we can get one more set of ideas from my friend, S_eight +... 561755_564395
be ready, please . 564535_565195
about how these decompositions of ten are the same or how these decompositions of ten are different ? 565655_572355
let's find one more idea from a friend on the carpet . 572575_574595
my friend, S_two, what are you thinking ? 575195_576795
xxx .
thank you much for letting your friend S_two have her thinking time . 596095_598675
I know she has a smart idea and something important to say . 598795_602795
S_two, can I draw your attention to one thing that we haven't talked about yet ? 604335_622235
can you take a look down here ? 624325_625685
what are you seeing with those equations ? 626985_632025
hold on . 633685_636865
let's let S_two have her own thinking . 637045_638445
they're in the same place .
say it one more time . 639745_641125
they're in the same place .
you're saying they're in the same place . 641645_644845
they are in the same place . 644985_646485
I agree . 646645_647065
I'm wondering if we can see, S_two, if the numbers are actually the same ? 647565_650445
S_two, can you come on up and help us out please ? 650605_652025
thanks . 657765_658245
friends, we're almost off the carpet . 658385_659585
S_ten, please be ready, so you can learn from your friend, S_two . 659865_662085
S_two, in the equation that I wrote when I did this decomposition, where's the group that this two represents ? 662125_672405
can you touch it, please ? 672825_673845
where's the group that two represents ? 674805_676765
you can say that group is +... 677105_678005
that group is two . 678485_679825
it's right +... 680225_680685
it's right +...
it's right here ? 681705_683405
okay . 683625_683785
and in this equation over here +... 684365_686525
turn back this way please . 687085_687985
where is this group of two represented on the playing card ? 689345_692745
right here . 693085_693825
it's right there . 694045_694765
and in this equation, what about this group of eight ? 695325_697685
it's over there .
and in this equation, where's this group of eight ? 698825_704325
right here . 704685_705385
it's right here . 705645_706245
so what are you noticing about these equations ? 706305_708025
can you turn towards your friends please, so we can hear your smart idea ? 709885_712265
what do both equations have ? 713075_714595
two . 716835_717175
they both have ? 717475_718155
they both have two . 718415_719895
and ? 720395_720835
and eight .
oh, let's see if somebody can repeat that smart idea that you just had . 725895_728255
S_eleven, can you repeat what S_two just said ? 728555_730475
if you didn't hear her, you can of course ask her to say it again, please . 738895_741795
no, thank you . 742395_742855
say it again .
can you +... 743275_743995
can you say it again, please ? 744735_746015
both equations +... 746355_747615
both equations have two +... 747935_749695
S_twelve, sorry . 749695_750315
we need that really loud mathematician voice . 750395_752575
go for it . 752655_753115
both equations have two . 753195_756135
and ? 758195_758875
and eight . 759235_760555
S_two said ?
S_two said there's +... 761535_766675
what did she say about those equations ? 766785_768125
can we find another friend who can say what S_two was saying ? 769265_777605
and then you can repeat what that friend is saying ? 778125_780105
this is an important idea, so we just want to make sure everybody can hear it . 780465_783265
S_thirteen thinks she can say what S_two is saying . 783365_784765
would you please tell your friend S_eleven ? 784845_785865
S_two say the expression +... 786465_790405
that both equations ? 790805_791845
both equations have two and eight . 792545_796605
did you want to ask S_two, is that what you said ? 797045_799645
is that what you said ? 800205_801905
yeah . 802205_802505
yeah ? 802865_803005
so S_two said +... 803205_804705
S_two said +... 805585_806365
that both equations have a +... 806545_807785
that both equations have +...
what is that ? 809045_811985
a group of ? 812065_812565
a group two . 813005_813965
and a group of ? 814245_814965
eight . 815105_815545
and a group of eight . 815625_816765
are we on the same page ? 816945_817885
yeah . 817965_818505
so, even though the groups are in different places, they have the same equation . 819035_823755
is that what I'm hearing you say ? 823895_824835
that's crazy . 826075_826695
S_four has the last word on this . 826875_828595
he's got a quiet hand . 828635_829295
xxx something he really wants to say . 829415_830555
the question's the wrong way . 830575_831335
oh, we'll talk about that in a moment . 831615_833535
