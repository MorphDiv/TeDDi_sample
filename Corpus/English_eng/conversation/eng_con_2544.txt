&-um her forthcoming book is Christianity and the Making of the Modern Family and I'm sure that that's &-uh out_of this project is her talk today Christianity and the Making of Modern Family .
thank you so much for the work you've done and welcome ⌈ to Lane Hall ⌉ .
&=applause .
⌊ okay thank you ⌋ .
boy I wanna first explain that Christianity and the Making of the Modern Family was not my title for this book .
&=laughs:SUm this was my title Reimagining Families plural Gender Home and Work in Christian History .
&-uh I and &-uh this is about the most boring cover I've ever seen in my life you know &=laughs:multiple they should've just &-uh how about just &-uh a &~kin a a plain brown wrapper you know ?
&-um &=laughs:multiple so &-uh I complained bitterly to Beacon Press they were completely deaf &-uh to my cries of rage and &-uh &=laughs and came out with this &-um &-uh and &-uh I should have you know sued them or done something drastic &-uh but I I didn't think they were gonna just ignore me .
anyway they have now gotten the point since they've gotten so many complaints .
they're gonna put out a paperback with a much better cover and they're gonna add these words to the title Ruling Ideologies Diverse Realities .
so at least it kind of corrects what could easily be the impression of this title which is that Christianity created the modern family .
yeah ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ which ⌋ is exactly the opposite &=laughs of the point of the book .
so you know and so this is one of these bad experiences that authors occasionally have &-uh &-um so I just wanted to to introduce that &-uh what I'm gonna do is is kind_of &-uh give you a rapid overview &=laughs of the thesis of the book .
&-uh but I wanna start out &~j by reading two quotes &-uh that kind of set the stage this is in the introduction the first quote is from something called Focus on the Family everybody knows what ⌈ Focus on the Family is .
it's a right wing ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, conservative ⌈ xxx ⌉ +/.
+, &-uh think tank on xxx &=laughs:multiple based in Colorado Springs &{l=READING Focus on the Family attempts to turn hearts toward home .
by reasonable biblical and empirical insights so that people will be able to discover the founder of homes and the creator of families Jesus Christ .
&}l=READING &=laughs:SUm okay the second quote goes as follows &{l=READING if anyone comes to me and does not hate his own mother and father wife and children brothers and sisters yes even his own life he cannot be my disciple .
&}l=READING Jesus of Nazareth .
+, yeah ⌊ xxx ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so that &-uh sets a little shall ⌉ we say a little contradiction .
&=laughs:multiple &-um right wing &-uh Christians have tried to portray themselves as restorers of what they call the God given biblical form of the family .
&=laughs:S5 what they mean by this is a male headed nuclear family with a working husband and a &-um dependent wife .
+, hm +/.
+, &-uh but this form of the family is actually the middle+class white Victorian family of the late nineteenth century .
&-uh they claimed that this type of family is a is an expression of the quote orders of creation that's a a heavy duty Puritan term &-uh that means that this is part of the structures of God's creation .
in other words that this type of family was established by God at creation &=laughs whenever that was &=laughs:multiple &-uh and &-uh therefore of_course is unchangeable and eternal .
but this of_course is both historically and theologically mistaken .
there's no normative biblical family the Old Testament one finds many forms of the family &-uh one of them for example is a tribal clan extended family very often with multiple wives and their children and their slaves and their children .
&-uh so this type of family &-uh that they're lifting up &-uh as normative is as I said actually the creation of the white middle class &-uh in the West in the nineteenth century .
and it is in crisis today in other words this kind of nuclear family is in crisis &-uh for the very &~s obvious reason that it never worked for working class and black people and it's no longer working for middle+class whites today .
now I thought what I would like to do is is &-uh &-uh sort_of focus on two parts of this book I wanna focus <on the> on the New Testament piece &-uh and then kind of fast forward &=laughs through the centuries and talk about the shaping of this &-uh &-uh middle+class nuclear family in the late nineteenth century and why it's in crisis today .
in the New Testament there is a deep conflict between a negation of the biological family a negation that &~w was typically a part of the language of the Jesus Movement &-uh and then you find in the later strata of the New Testament a restoration of the patriarchal slave holding family that had been rejected in earlier Christianity .
&-uh in the Gospels one finds a strong criticism of the biological family .
Jesus is portrayed as rejecting his own family his mother and brothers &-um he had a by the way a big family he had four brothers a couple sisters &-uh we don't have a good idea &=laughs but &-um but he's described as critiquing &-uh that kind of &~f family in favor of the community of believers .
and &~o and one scene that you find in in &-uh all of the Gospels his mother and brothers come &-uh and try to &-uh &-uh seize him &~th &~they they're described as believing him to be mad and coming to seize him .
&-uh I once &-uh gave a sermon on this and as a kind of throwaway line I have the tendency to do these throwaway lines &=laughs:SUm and I said that they were trying to get him to come home and take care of his wife and children .
&=laughs:multiple and this this created a_lot_of consternation in the church .
&=laughs:multiple but anyway whatever they were coming for &~they they're portrayed as believing him to be mad and coming to seize him .
and Jesus is then described as repudiating them by saying who are my mother and my brothers and my sisters .
and looking around at those who sat around him he said here are my mother and my brothers and my sisters whoever does the will of God is my brother my sister and my mother .
in other words the new community of faith is seen as negating the natural biological family &-uh or in Luke's words which I just quoted &{l=READING if anyone comes to me and does not hate his own mother father wife and children brothers and sisters he cannot be my disciple .
&}l=READING &-uh now what's going on in in this kind of language about the family .
&-um I think that this negation of the family in the Jesus tradition reflects &-um three different things .
&-uh first it it reflects an eschatological belief .
everybody know what eschatological means ?
I don't .
no .
it means &-uh a rejection <of a> &-uh of a heavenly time that is believed to soon be coming or some redemptive new age believed to be coming .
&-uh in the Kingdom of God where there will be no more marrying and giving in marriage .
&-uh and it's assumed &~i &-uh <it is> it is said in the New Testament those who are anticipating this new age where there'll be no more marrying or giving in marriage do not marry now in other words they they begin to anticipate this new age where there's no marrying or giving in marriage .
secondly &-uh many people in Jesus' time could not marry .
slaves were forbidden to marry &-uh +...
soldiers could not marry during their time of duty &-um many poorer people &-uh could not afford to marry or were not allowed to marry outside of their ethnic group .
&-uh and early Christianity seems to have been made up of many disenfranchised people without families .
thirdly &-uh the church or the community of believers is seen &-uh then as their alternative family &-um you might say their surrogate family &-uh the true family of brothers and sisters gathered outside of these oppressive systems of society and supporting these disenfranchised people .
now this view of the church as a new or true family continues in Paul Paul's writings are larded with analogies drawn from the family and from the patriarchal slave holding household of the Roman world .
Christians are said to be like slaves who have been emancipated and who have been adopted by the father of the household as true children .
or this is an &=laughs interesting analogy they are said to be like a wife who has been emancipated because the husband who held control over her has died .
&=laughs:multiple that's what it says .
&-um &=laughs:multiple (0.5) the fleshly family of Israel is said to have been superceded by this new people the spiritual people of God and and the upshot of all these family analogies in Paul is that the church is a new family related by faith replacing old ties of kinship race and class .
however +...
Paul gets nervous when this these ideas are pushed &-uh in a certain direction in terms of slaves and women .
I mean he's kind_of happy with these analogies when they overcome the distinction of of Jew and Greek which is kind_of his main thing .
but when it they got get pressed to sort_of emancipate &=laughs women and slaves he gets a little more nervous .
&-um and there rises particularly a conflict over the idea that women are liberated from subordination and the patriarchal &~h family by negating marriage and joining the church .
&-uh and such women and you have a considerable tradition in early Christianity with the reflected in &-uh a number of of writings many of them &-um in in the &~apo what's called Apocryphal Gospels and Acts of the Apostles .
that depict &-uh this class of women who who reject marriage &-uh and join the church and in and this they're seen as &-uh emancipated to then travel around &-uh and &-uh &-uh preach and teach and baptize .
&-uh &~s &-uh I remember <we did> we did a &-uh a study of this in one of the &-uh American Academy of Religion sessions or maybe it was the Early Christian Session I forget .
but anyway we titled it Have Celibacy Will Travel &=laughs:multiple because of that's the story line you know .
Paul comes to town converts women women reject their fiance &-uh repudiate their household dress as a man travel around <and &-uh> and &-uh you_know hit the road and &-uh and evangelize &-um and and one of the major examples of this kind of genre of writing is the acts of Paul and Thekla .
&-uh exalting a woman who rejects the demands of her family repudiates her subordination to her parents &-um rejects her fiance &-uh and &-um then travels &-uh around &-um &-uh preaching &-uh baptizing and teaching .
and Paul is depicted as affirming her choice and commissioning her &-uh to go back to her hometown and preach .
&-um so you have a &~v what I'm saying you have a very different Paul in these writings which is interesting .
&-uh now the Paul of the New Testament epistles shared part of these assumptions &-uh he believed that celibacy was the anticipation of the Kingdom of God and therefore it relativized marriage .
&-um &-uh he was himself one of those people who didn't marry &-um &-uh &~i so he thought that the most committed people would be like himself and not married &-uh but he was also clearly threatened by independent women who claimed that their conversion to Christ &-uh emancipated them from these family relationships and allowed them to engage in itinerant preaching .
&-uh so you you see that kind of ambivalence in in the historic &-uh Letters of Paul and then in the post Pauline Letters which come from the next generation after Paul &-uh namely letters like First Timothy we see an attack on these kind of women church leaders an effort to silence them .
&{l=READING let a woman learn in silence and all submissiveness I permit no woman to teach or have authority over men she is to keep silent &}l=READING that's in First Timothy and what this text unwittingly reveals of_course is that women were indeed commonly teaching and having authority over men in Paul &=laughs these Pauline churches in other words you don't forbid what is not going on right ?
&=laughs:multiple &-um so Timothy &-uh or the writer of this this epistle is championing &-uh or attempting to restore a traditional patriarchal slave holding family as normative for the church &-uh over against what had been a disruption of these patterns &-um and &~th and one then finds repeatedly in this second &-uh later strata of the New Testament the threefold &-uh command wives obey your husbands slaves obey your masters children obey your parents .
&=laughs:S5 &-uh obviously trying to reestablish this kind of structure of the family .
&-uh and yet single women &-uh that is to say &~w &-uh women who were never married or widows &-uh continue to play a major role in Pauline churches .
as I said the the Acts of Paul and Thekla and other such literature give us a glimpse of this alternative Pauline Christianity which looked to Paul for their mandate that that women converted to Christ could leave their families repudiate the authority of their parents and their prospective husbands and travel and preach .
and Paul himself is depicted as blessing Thekla and &~commis commissioning her to preach .
so that's that's a little bit on the on this New Testament framework .
&-uh now what happened to that tradition ?
&-uh in the post New Testament &-uh and medieval period &-um and &-uh here's where I do a little fast forward &=laughs to kind_of go from the second century to the nineteenth century .
&-um from the second to the fourth century this conflict between unmarried women &-uh single women &-uh and widows and and the patriarchal family this conflict continued in Christianity .
&-uh and there were many radical forms of Christianity such as Montanism &~m Marchinaites Valentinians who championed the idea of the Christian community as a community of single men and women who are equals in a new spiritual community of brothers and sisters .
but but these movements became increasingly marginalized by a patriarchal Christianity which now idealizes celibacy but rejects women's leadership .
&=laughs:S5 &-uh in other words what what happens by the fourth century is a kind of synthesis of patriarchy or male domination and celibacy .
&-um in in this new construct males alone are allowed public leadership &-uh women celibates are idealized but but they're only allowed private forms of asceticism in other words they can't have &~th they can't be public teachers and married people &-uh fall into kind_of a third rate status +/.
mhm +/.
+, &-uh &-uh increasingly falling under church discipline in their marital lives &-um but treated as people who had chosen a lesser way of life .
&-uh allowed but &-uh not as holy as celibacy .
now from from the late &-uh Ancient World the fifth century &-uh into &-uh &-uh the High Middle Ages the Western church engaged in three struggles in relationship to family and women .
&-uh first there was a a continual effort to force celibacy onto priests .
now priests had been married in the earlier church and there was an effort to force celibacy onto them .
this largely failed &-uh largely because no man could survive without a wife unless he was in a monastery &=laughs .
&-um so it was &~re &-uh it was really a monastic movement and finally &-uh this was legally solved by simply declaring all married priests to be &-uh in in concubinage and their children as bastards &=laughs &=laughs:S5 &-uh but it didn't actually change &-uh what people were doing .
&-uh except that of_course it demoted the status of the wife and children .
&-uh and so that was one kind of &~s movement &-uh that goes on .
&-uh secondly there's an effort to force monogamy with no divorce or remarriage &-uh and no marriage between &-uh &-uh several degrees of kinship &-uh for married people .
so the church gets into this business of trying to construct <a type> &-uh a type of marriage &-um that which only is monogamous no divorce or remarriage &-uh no marriage between kin and so on .
&-uh and and here <it was> &~i it was battling against Celtic and German law that allowed polygamy easy divorce for both men and women and marriage between relatives .
finally there was a constant effort to cloister women &~cel the celibate women and to forbid them public ministry and self-government of their communities and this didn't really work until the Late Middle Ages because you have Hildegaard of Bingen and +//.
very much ruling &=laughs abbesses in the &~high &-um Early and High Middle Ages and and and those women like Hildegaard of Bingen who goes around preaching and so on .
so this is only really forced &-uh onto women's communities by the end of the Middle Ages in the Counter_Reformation .
okay &-uh moving right along &=laughs I wanna say something about how the Reformation restructures this &-um this picture +...
the main stream of the Protestant Reformation Luther Calvin so on &-uh &-um &-uh Anglicanism to some extent &-uh rejected the celibate ideal that had dominated Christianity for fifteen hundred years .
now this not only meant rejecting celibacy for the priesthood but also rejecting or abolishing monastic life for men and women &-uh and this had quite a different effect on women than on men .
in other words the the old monk could now become a Lutheran pastor and marry &=laughs which is what Luther did .
but women &-uh were really lost a whole alternative in other words earlier they had had an alternative now they had no alternative .
&-um &-uh in other words women had no more &-uh no other alternative other than marriage .
&-uh and Protestantism championed a a a patriarchal concept of marriage and as &-uh as the order of creation this concept of of marriage as the order of creation comes to &~m modern right wing Protestants from &-uh the Reformation .
&-uh and they also believed that everybody ought to marry .
(0.4) &-um essentially what Luther &-uh believed I mean he still very much believed that &-uh human sexuality was was fallen and sinful .
&-um and &-uh the only way to contain lust was to marry .
&=laughs but nobody was capable of of &~b of being celibate so it actually &~c this insistence comes out_of a kind of negative view of sexuality but there is a seat here how about coming right in here ?
+, ⌊ oh I'm I'm &~just I'm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ &~d &~d do ⌉ not be shy .
&=laughs:multiple okay so you have this this effort to force everybody to marry <and to> &~ab and to abolish monastic life .
and and this this had a limiting &-uh effect on women .
secondly and this this &~u &~u may be surprising &-uh because we think of Protestantism as elevating the status of marriage Protestantism &~al the Protestant reformers also rejected the sacramentality of marriage .
&-uh in other words they they said marriage is not a sacrament .
&-uh and this was basically because they thought that marriage was a quote natural institution of creation not a redemptive expression of the new creation in Christ .
in other words for them sacraments belonged to the new creation of Christ they're not &~a and marriage was not part of the new creation of Christ it was an institution of of of the natural world .
now this desacramentalizing of marriage meant that divorce was allowed .
because the old view that there could be no divorce was dependent on the idea that a marriage &-uh &~th a a marriages are sacraments and sacraments cannot be negated .
so now divorce is allowed although the grounds for this the Anglican church by the way didn't accept that and still has a problem with the idea of divorce .
but Lutheran &-uh the Lutheran Calvinist tradition allowed divorce but the grounds for it were very narrow .
adultery or desertion .
&-uh and in desertion the woman had +//.
and it was usually the woman &=laughs being deserted hadta wait a &~li you know number of years before you know she could be remarried .
&-uh and domestic violence was not seen as ground for a divorce .
+, hm +/.
+, &-uh a &~th a third piece here &-um the sixteenth seventeenth century also &~n saw an increasing shift in the economy that marginalized women from skilled paid work .
&-uh &~n this was going on in both the Catholic and the Protestant areas it's a general movement in &-uh early modern Europe &-uh in the Protestant areas single women were looked at with suspicion .
&-uh and &-uh made to live in households headed by men .
in other words a &~wome a single woman couldn't live by herself or or head a household .
&-uh married women were also being removed from guild membership or craft union membership in their own right and they were allowed only unpaid domestic work or occasional &-um marketing in the informal economy .
informal economy not the organized craft unions but you know they could maybe make hairbrushes and peddle them <in the> in the marketplace and so on so they were really being demoted into these &-uh &-uh unpaid or low paid areas and this made it very difficult for a woman to be self-supporting as a householder .
Protestantism of_course also did not allow women public ministry preaching or ordained ministry .
and women could not &~at &-uh attend universities in Europe .
&-um basically (un)til the twentieth century .
so those trends begin in terms of women's economic opportunities &-uh and this continues &-uh &~i &-uh as we move toward the nineteenth century .
&-um the movement from the seventeenth to mid nineteenth century in Western Europe and the United States saw a series of economic developments that is reshaping the whole work relationship .
and the gender definitions of male and female roles +...
basically what happens from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century is the artisan household economy now the artisan household economy basically was the the &~cl the classic &-um preindustrial economy &-uh of middle+class households where the &-uh the household was essentially a workshop &=laughs and the wife the husband the children the apprentices &-uh servants and so on all essentially were a a work force a household work force .
so this &-uh artisan &-uh type of household economy where husband wife sons daughters &-uh resident apprentices all worked together was being gradually destroyed .
&-uh paid work and even a subsistence household economy was being gradually removed from the household .
&-uh in other words the production of goods and services were being separated out from the household of the family and collectivized in the public economy removed from the household .
&-um in other words &-um textiles were being removed from the family to factories &=laughs this is &-uh what I'm basically saying here .
and the and poorer women and children along with men were then being drawn into low paid factory work .
whereas the poorest woman and children would work as servants &-uh in other households .
so that's one whole direction in which you're losing the household economy and and you know what's appearing is the factory .
secondly the middle+class household itself was being removed from areas of town related to paid work factories offices .
&-uh in other instead of having the boss of the factory live in a big house next to the factory and have his wife perhaps be the bookkeeper for the factory &=laughs &-uh you're you're taking the household where where boss's family lived and you're moving it out_of the area where the factories are .
&-uh and you're moving it into some kind of &-uh &-uh sort_of purely &~d &-uh &~p &-uh realm of purely domestic houses you know the kind of the first range of suburbs and so on .
&=laughs:SUm so you're separating the the spheres &-uh of paid work and &~hous of houses .
and these new houses where where the boss's family are being lodged now &-um are not only disconnected from the place of paid work &-uh and and the wife no longer can participate in that work .
&-uh but you're also removing any subsistence economy from the household .
I_mean &~ch no more chickens &=laughs herbal gardens vegetables and so on .
you you're &~r you the the ideal is grass lawn ornamental gardens .
+, hm +/.
+, so the ideal family comes to be defined as the white middle+class family &-uh with a domesticated wife who &~d quote does not work .
that is to say she does not have any paid work &-uh and does not even do subsistence household production like growing herbs making medicine &~veget canning vegetables fruits keeping chickens and so on now a_lot_of that actually went on but the ideal is to increasingly remove production from the household .
and to create the the &-uh the ideal that the wife and children are to be &-uh entirely supported by the husband's wages which he earns in work that is now disconnected from the household .
in other words the role of the wife is to be the full+time mother and &-uh wife which &-uh a concept which it basically never had existed earlier .
now this ideal was unattainable for most working class families in the nineteenth century black women &~h of_course hadta work to support the family &-uh but they had only the poorest work available to them such as sharecropping domestic service and laundry .
&-uh immigrant women worked in domestic service but also in factories often did piece work &-uh in their homes &-uh &-um but the labor movement which rose in the late nineteenth century in this country championed the middle+class white family ideal .
in other words they tried to raise the male wage to the level where the wife could become a full+time housewife .
and therefore &~b by and large the labor movement in this country did not &~s support women's union struggles .
or by the way black union struggles .
&=laughs in other words they it was a white male movement .
then in the late nineteenth century white middle+class women who were beginning to get into higher education and so on begin to &-uh revolt against this isolation and domestication .
&-uh and they begin to organize to &~g get the vote to get higher education and to be admitted to professional employment .
so that's the a movement of of of educated white middle class and most of these new professional white women reformers tended to remain single .
many choosing lifelong relations with other professional women rather than marriage .
what was called the Boston Marriage .
&=laughs have you ever heard the phrase Boston Marriage ?
&=laughs well this is a very typical late Victorian women professionals .
&-uh the assumption of_course is that women simply could not do professional work have a career and also marry .
so you you you get that kind of &~f first wave you might say of feminism &-um then what begins to happen to that as we get into the twentieth century ?
&-um in the twentieth century &-uh one of the things that's really struck me and and I detail this in the last chapters of the book is the rapid shifts of ideology that take place between the twenties the thirties the forties the fifties and the sixties .
you know &-uh so there's this extraordinary shifts of ideology but under the appearance of these shifts of ideology there's actually a continual trend in one direction .
and that continual trend in one direction is more and more two worker families .
&=laughs more and more families &~w &-uh where both husband and wife work and and the wife working earlier and earlier after the birth of children .
so that's that's the the trend that goes on under the you might say the surface of these rapid shifts of ideology .
&-um now it's important again to emphasize that this idea of the nonworking wife never of_course worked for anybody but but somebody with a fairly wealthy income I mean unless you can't have a nonworking wife unless your husband gets a certain level of income right ?
&=laughs so it never worked for black people and working class people &-uh you always had black women working long hours and &~s &-uh laundries and &-uh and so on or Polish women doing &-uh piece work in sweatshops while leaving their children to largely take care of themselves and none of this working wife and mother was seen as a social problem .
it became a social problem when white women wanted to work +/.
+, hm &=laughs +/.
+, &=laughs and have families .
and of_course they weren't working in laundries they wanted to work at the University of Michigan or &=laughs something you know .
in other words when white middle+class women began to want to move into professional work and also marry and have children suddenly the working wife and mother became a social problem .
and were seen as neglecting their husbands and children and causing all manner of social pathology .
&=laughs:multiple now they the the nineteen twenties &-um there's the first of these shifts &-uh of ideology the nineteen &~twenti twenties saw a rejection of the single female bonded lifestyle that had been &~typi typical of the suffragists &-uh generation and women reformers .
&-uh somehow that that women bonding pattern associated with a certain kind of high moral ideals this was &-uh seen as you know kind of old fashioned stuff .
and <the new> &-um the new &-uh idea was sexual pleasure .
&=gasp new idea I mean &~the these old women of_course were supposed to be essentially incapable of &=laughs sexual pleasure .
&=laughs:S5 so now the sexual pleasure of women was &-uh was kind_of in of_course it was assumed to be marital sexual pleasure .
&-uh and the role of birth control then began to be raised something which the suffragists had sort_of avoided as they avoided this sexuality issue .
&-uh Protestants as_well_as Catholics thought that birth control was immoral and and and kept it illegal Protestants didn't really change on this (un)til the fifties .
well some some in the thirties but mostly in the fifties .
&-um so you have the birth control issue &-uh and professional women began to argue for the combining of work and family but there was also a &~countera &-uh attack a counterattack on the working wife .
expressed in the popularizing of Freudian psychology .
&-uh condemning the independent working wife as pathological .
&=laughs:SUm so the whole popularization of Freudianism in this country very much is an attack on the woman who wants to be an independent professional and that she is rejecting her destiny you know as &-uh a &-uh wife and mother +...
so that's that kind of thing is going on in the twenties then comes the Depression in the thirties &-uh and there is a stepped up attack on the working wife and this becomes installed as public policy of governments and businesses .
&-uh it is said that working wives are the cause of male unemployment .
although there was actually no &=laughs no connection between working wives and the men who were being unemployed because the men who were being unemployed were not being &~unemp &~empl were not employed in the places where women were working &=laughs doing different jobs .
so this was basically a lie &-uh but women were nevertheless &-uh fired from teaching and from government services and so on on the idea that that the work should be &-uh reserved for men .
but of_course the women with unemployed husbands hadta work all the more but they were being pushed out_of better paid work into lower paid work .
&-uh &~a while men took the upper level of what had been female professions such as librarianship and public school teaching .
so women really were not pushed out_of the workforce they were pushed down in the work force during the Depression .
&-uh then during the Second World War there was a kind of temporary reversal of these &-uh policies with men away at war women's work was valued women were encouraged to take up employment in all areas Rosie the Riveter I think there's just been a new monument to Rosie the Riveter is that right ?
so women encouraged to take up employment &-uh and &-uh contrary <to the> to the myth that women war workers were single white women &~wai waiting for their boyfriend to &~ge come home and marry in fact most of the war workers were &-uh &-uh women who'd already worked .
and many of them had children .
&-uh and for the first time &-uh in American history the federal government actually sponsored a child care program .
inadequate but nevertheless significant that they did this in_order_to because they +/.
+, ⌊ child care ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ hadta have women work they ⌉ also sponsored child care program .
&-uh then the fifties &-uh the end of the war the return of the vets .
total switch in this policy women laid off in droves to make room for the vets the government &-uh subsidizing housing and higher education for the vets while working women were again attacked as pathological .
so &~th so it's the fifties that really is the the &~n nostalgic apogee of this myth of the family <for the> for the Christian right .
it is <is the> &-uh is the fifties &-uh for a brief period women's educational level actually fell in the fifties .
&-uh I mean &~wo women had been climbing up in the educational level it actually fell and they &~n &-uh men and women married earlier than they had at any other time in in American history .
women typically married at twenty men at twenty two whereas the the norm had been women twenty four men twenty six or seven .
so that <it was> it was actually an aberrant period .
of_course black and working class women continued to work &-um &-uh <then the> then the decade of sixty five to seventy five &-uh a new &-uh revolt of middle+class &-uh women &-uh against this domestication this feminine mystique as Betty &~Fried Friedan called it and they began to organize a new feminist movement &-uh to complete the agenda of the women's movement in terms of equality legal equality educational equality economic equality .
and there were many &-uh &-uh legislative victories sixty eight to seventy two a number of legislative victories the capstone of this being the passing of the Equal Rights Amendment in Congress in nineteen seventy two which had been held in Congress not out_of committee since nineteen twenty three .
&=laughs:multiple nineteen seventy two it's taken out_of committee and passed &-uh and then in seventy three the Supreme Court passes Roe versus Wade &-uh legalizing abortion in the first two trimesters .
&-uh feminist movement had not actually been &~inv involved in that but of_course it was blamed on feminism .
then seventy five eighty five a new backlash .
major antifeminist backlash &-uh by a rise of &-uh &-uh right wing Christians into political power in which the right wing Christians had tended to be sort_of apolitical they became politicized &-uh the Equal Rights Amendment was was blocked from passage in the states &-uh and there has been a continual effort to roll back reproductive rights and women's legal political and economic gains .
&-uh I think we might be seeing &-uh another stage of that <in the> &-uh in the present &-uh presidential administration .
&-uh welfare rights were &~de were attacked as antifamily .
&-uh by the way that reflects the fact that welfare rights were first passed for white women in the &~thir late thirties .
and then the sixties saw a great effort to to allow black women to get on welfare to which they had legal rights but they had not been allowed to get on welfare and then suddenly welfare becomes some way in which black women are being lazy and we &~ha we need to abolish welfare .
&=laughs:SUm you know as black women are getting on it .
and actually &-uh &~a &-uh &-uh at the same time there's all this notion that these people are being lazy from being on welfare the actual stipends of welfare are are sinking &-uh from being roughly at the at a &-uh subsistence &-uh &-um so+called poverty level to being half the poverty level .
so those that's the the kind of roller coaster you see from the twenties to the eighties &-uh and it but at the same time there's a continual trend and that continual trend is a &~k a is an increasing a continual increase in the two &~o the two worker that is to say husband wife two worker &-uh household .
&-uh as_well_as an increase in the number of working <single women> single women or or actually single person households are about twenty percent of all American households are single people .
&=laughs &-uh and also &-uh &-uh an increasing number of female headed households &-uh that is to say female headed with dependent people in it .
&-um and at the same the gap between rich and poor has widened and the middle class has shrunk creating a two tiered economy &-uh with the lower third of the economy living on &-uh &-uh sort_of hourly wages of &~s six seven to ten dollars an hour which is barely a a poverty wage .
in other words if you have a full+time ten hour &-uh a ten dollar an hour job your annual pay is eighteen thousand .
and of_course typically &-uh many of these people were &~ge were part+time &-uh no benefits no &~wage <&-uh no> &-uh no pensions no medical benefits and so on .
so you had this low wage area and then you have the professional upper class at a starting wage of fifty thousand or more with full benefits .
but but the other piece is that these this professional class is now expected to work longer and longer hours .
forget the the forty hour week .
&=laughs now if you really expect to make it as a professional you should have a ten hour you should be there &~n ten hours or or maybe even longer &-uh <and I> and I know my daughter is in computer animation in Hollywood and a_lot_of the the contracts for these people are actually the minimum is ten hours a day .
+, damn +/.
+, &=laughs so obviously this makes it increasingly difficult for somebody to have a full time job and also have any time for their family .
&=laughs in other words it it it heightens the contradiction between home and work &-um okay now having &-uh dragged you through that very rapidly I want to end by saying what should the church be doing .
this may not be interesting to &~s all of you but I'll tell you about it anyway .
+, go for it +/.
+, &-uh &=laughs &-uh I think that there is an urgent need for the churches to critique the unjust situation of women and families and to disassociate themselves from the right wing rhetoric of quote family values which is actually an attack on women and children .
+, right on +/.
+, &-uh adding to the stress and poverty of actual families .
now I think there're three areas the church should work in .
they should support more equal wages for all men and women together with shorter work days flex time jobs with full benefits medical care and affordable child care in the either in the neighborhoods or at the workplace .
now this would really make it possible for men and women to balance work and family with both men and women having income producing jobs and also being able to really share child raising with more adequate family time .
I mean I personally think that children not only need two parents they probably need three or four but &-um &=laughs:multiple so I mean I sort_of think you also need sort_of extended &=laughs commadres@s:spa and compadres@s:spa &-uh and so on &-uh but you can't do that unless you're really able to to &-uh have a kind of reasonable balance between work and family time .
&-uh secondly the church should stop sacralizing the Victorian &-uh &-uh white middle+class family &-uh as if this were the orders of creation .
&-uh this type of family was never available to poorer or black Americans and has today become basically unattainable for most &-uh middle+class white families .
&-uh churches should recognize that men and women have and they should have equal roles in both family care and work and public involvement in other words both men and women should be full human persons .
&=laughs &-uh and they accept and support a diversity of household and family forms notice the the plural part of this .
single people gay and lesbian couples and their children blended families extended families .
they should make the church a welcoming place for the actual diversity of households that in fact exist in our society .
and then thirdly I &~su &-uh I suggest there should be a separation between the legal and the sacramental &-uh in in terms of social sexual relations the government should be in charge of legal arrangements for partners and this would allow for a variety of types of partnership &-uh different ways of arranging perhaps medical benefits &-uh inheritance and so on .
and the church should &-uh &-uh get out_of the business of acting as an agent for the state in legalizing marriage and instead &-uh create a variety of ways in which people can covenant together and receive sacramental blessings for the community building relations &-uh that they are &-uh putting together to support love friendship and fidelity in in the many ways that people are finding &-uh themselves able to do that <and to> &~r and to raise children together .
and I think this would allow the church to reclaim something of the radical critique of the oppressive family &-uh that's found in early Christianity together with creative expressions of sacramental covenanting that can support the many ways in which we are &-uh seeking to &-uh bond together .
&-uh it seems to me that the churches have failed to visualize family &-uh not as some fixed part of some past &-uh divinely established order but rather as a new creation .
in other words that that we really should think about family as a redemptive possibility which criticizes systems of family and society that oppress women children the aged and the poor .
&-uh creating good loving and just families is a part of redemptive process that is making creation ever new .
it is a call to personal and social transformation .
in other words we can imagine and reconstruct various ways of creating sustainable relationships with each_other <between partners> between partners and children at different stages of our lives and of_course since we live longer than ever we have more stages of our lives &=laughs &-uh than we did in a earlier period of human history .
now once we take family out_of the mythic notion of a fixed institution mandated by God from the beginning and recognize it as a part of a continually renewed redemptive hope we can perhaps reinterpret the idea that marriage is sacramental .
mirroring the relationship of the Christian tradition &~g &-uh Christ and the church not in the sense of patriarchal hierarchy but in the sense of a new &-uh community &-uh redemptive community .
the union of Christ and the church of messianic hope and redemptive community could then be seen as anticipated and prefigured in the union of lovers becoming friends building nurturing families and becoming coworkers in bringing about the reign of God's justice and peace on Earth .
so that's the basically the last chapter of the book goes into a_lot_of those things in terms of new covenantal relations and &-um family building and stuff like that .
so we have &-uh half a minute for discussion &=laughs I'm not actually .
no we have some more time .
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
&=applause .
I think we can actually stay here (un)til about one thirty ⌈ right ⌉ ?
⌊ yeah yeah ⌋ we have it until one thirty .
thirty one minutes .
so we actually have plenty of time for discussion although some of you may need to rush off to your one fifteen class or something &-uh yeah ?
are are are you suggesting that <in the> in the last few minutes of your talk you you said the church should &-uh look at different &-uh different &~mo it appeared to me that you were saying different models of relationships and so forth .
are you saying that &-uh that the union of the male and the female should not be something intended &-uh until death do do them part ?
&-uh I &~w was not primarily talking about temporary unions .
&-uh although I think that there there is perhaps a place for the church &-uh to work with young people who are forming &-um live_in relations prior to permanent commitment .
&-uh I think the church has abandoned young people at this stage of life and basically said that you know between puberty at twelve and marriage at thirty you know when you finish your PhD at the &~univers &=laughs:multiple you know you're you're just on your own you know .
<&-uh and> &-uh and I think there may be a way &-uh of of helping young people &-uh &-uh really celebrate commitments <that are> that are intentionally short term &-um and nonchildbearing .
intentionally short term and ⌈ nonchildbearing with ⌉ .
⌊ the main focus ⌋ here is that once you have a child you have a a child lives a very long time .
right +/.
+, are ⌈ are you suggesting the child is yeah are you suggesting ⌉ .
⌊ right .
there certainly is &-uh now that's what I just said .
&-uh I I ⌋ suggest that people &~sh should be trained in birth control as part of their puberty right .
&=laughs which is what African &~t &-uh traditions did except the missionaries came in and destroyed it .
&-um but I also take very seriously the idea that that that when a couple decides that they're gonna create a child or adopt a child &-uh then they have at the very least a permanent responsibility to that child .
now ⌈ is that &~perman ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-uh and they ⌋ should covenant together in a way that really &-uh is very seriously &-uh intending to make that relationship &-uh permanent and and &~e even if they do not succeed you know humans are not perfect &-uh in making their relationship to each_other permanent that the relationship with the child has got to be a permanent commitment .
&-uh so I I I talk about different &-uh kinds of states there but obviously we're also talking about other kind of configurations because many &-uh &-uh lesbian couples are having shall we say a modest baby boom and &-uh &-uh and are are are having having children &-uh of their own <and &-uh> and &-uh gay men are adopting children ⌈ I had a a ⌉ .
⌊ as a Catholic ⌋ yeah I mean ⌈ you came here as a Catholic ⌉ .
⌊ excuse_me I think there'll ⌋ be other +//.
I think there are other people that have questions that ⌈ why don't we go to other people ⌉ .
⌊ right and <and I> and <I think> I think that ⌋ that raising children has got to be understood the decision to have and raise children hasta be understood as a permanent commitment ⌈ of a covenant ⌉ .
⌊ did you say ⌋ there's a long time for questions or ⌈ or short ⌉ +/.
⌊ is pardon ⌋ ?
+, time for I got the impression there was something like thirty minutes for questions .
⌈ yeah but ⌉ .
⌊ yes ⌋ but there're other people that had their hand up so let's go to somebody else and then we can circle back to you when other people have had a chance to speak .
yeah ?
you use the word redemptive several times redemptive community .
could you expand on the word redemptive ?
what I mean by redemptive is just and loving .
in other words redemptive communities are communities which are which which do not &~ap one person is not oppressed by the other &-uh the women are not expected to to to &-uh do all the serving and get no &~d none of the development which is the traditional patriarchal marriage that is not a redemptive relationship that is an unjust relationship .
&-uh &-um you know children are not obviously beaten and raped and so on .
so and so that one one hasta &-uh &-uh much of the traditional patriarchal family has been &-um violent and unjust .
and it has been sanctioned as as normal because it's somehow blessed and and and &-uh and and officially married &-uh you might say all of the energy of the church has gone into &-uh condemning &-uh people for having &-uh relationships outside marriage .
&-um but there has been no effort to say that &-uh &~oppre you know &-uh wife rape or &~ch &-uh you_know abusing your children or or simply assuming that your wife should &-uh should be the &-uh dependent person who doesn't isn't allowed to really develop her own &-uh life &-uh that that these are in fact &-uh violent and sinful relationships .
so I &~th I think &~th &-uh one hasta critique that as &~i first of all &~i it's it's not the order of creation .
&=laughs I mean God didn't create that kind of structure in the beginning .
&-uh so that whole ideology about orders of creation hasta be rejected .
it it is a particular historical construct that kind of family &-uh and it needs to be &-uh &-uh questioned <as &-uh> as &-uh unjust and violent which is to say nonredemptive .
&-uh redemptive relationships are relationships where people really learn to love and value each_other help each_other to to grow into full persons and and and make a a kind of commitment to each_other that really allows each_other &~t to grow and to &-uh sustain &-uh raising children sustain children that really are able to grow into full personhood .
&-uh that is that to me is <is a> is a &~re &~re redemptive process it's a very &-um &-uh &~c creative hopeful open to the future kind of possibility so that's what I'm talking about .
and &~tha it's at that context that I think we can break this impasse of the reformation of of talking about marriage as nonsacramental because it's &~identi the the patriarchal marriage was assumed to be the order of creation .
I think we need to question both of those assumptions .
yeah ?
&-um can you say a little bit more it seems like there's a growing gap between the &-uh Christian right and the &-uh Christian left &=laughs:multiple I suppose .
⌈ right there is ⌉ .
⌊ or what's left over of it ⌋ .
&=laughs ⌈ yeah ⌉ .
⌊ &-um and so <I feel> like in some ways &-uh ⌋ &-uh no comment on you but your preaching to the converted perhaps +/.
uhuh +/.
+, &-um and I feel like I'm often like preaching to the converted in terms of people in the church who share ideas of liberation and equality and justice in a way that when I read about the Christian right in the paper in the politics I don't know where they're coming from .
+, yeah +/.
+, I can't get on the same plane .
and so I really wonder where that communication where that bridge can be built ?
yeah .
I don't believe that the Christian right and the Christian left are in communion with each_other .
they may be in the same denomination they're not in communion .
essentially what we have is is schism within almost all our denominations .
&-uh &-uh between &-um you know let's say in the Methodist church between Good News Methodists who I refer to as Bad News Methodists and &=laughs:multiple &-um you know Christians for Social Justice &-um Methodists for Social Justice so on .
so I think you know in other words we we've had a kind of reconfiguration of the church in the last fifty years <coming up> where the old &-uh divisions between denominations the &~o &-uh the the old hostilities and schisms between different groups of Protestants &-uh repudiating each_other and then of_course all of the Catholics and Protestants repudiating each_other .
that that has kind of shifted to somewhat ecumenical relations .
&-uh you_know I mean people sort_of seeing each_other's so &~e &~ecu ecumenical relations have grown between Christians between historic churches at the same time that there has &~b &-uh there has erupted often unnamed a a deepening schism within each of these denominations .
<so that> so that Christians and the progressive Christians that the kind of liberation feminists and so on respected &-uh whether they're you know Unitarians Congregationalists Lutherans Episcopalians Catholics they're actually are +//.
kind of &~i within the same perspective .
which is &=break_in_recording &=laughs +/.
yeah +/.
+, but it's probably not ⌈ going to happen ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ good idea ⌋ +/.
+, for the simple reason that there's buildings and pensions involved .
&=laughs:multiple &-uh but they actually have much less in common with each_other than than Christians on on the progressive wing although &~th as I said &~an and and a certain amount of fundamentalist Christians I mean there's a certain shall we say ecumenism &=laughs on the right as well .
&-uh where &-uh notions of you know the scripture is is &~lo inspired in every word literally &-uh which of_course is is untenable for anybody who studies historical &-uh understanding of the scripture &-um the idea that the patriarchal family is you know the creation of God &-uh &=laughs:S5 hostility towards &-uh women's reproductive rights all of these kind of things are are part of the world of right wing &-uh Christians .
and they I think they come out_of &-uh &~the they're really totally two different radically different constructions of the Christian faith .
and they're &~n they're not gonna be reconciled there's no way to reconcile them .
+, hm +/.
+, because they do not share the same religion .
so I just wanna make that real clear .
&-uh and then by and large &~w progressive Christians are are are sort_of handicapped because they're always trying to concede to right wing Christians and create some middle ground .
but you can't really concede to them (be)cause you don't share the same faith .
so that's my view .
&=laughs:multiple .
given what you said about the long term trend towards both having two workers &-uh in in families &-um I wonder if you could explain +//.
my understanding of fundamentalist movements whether they're Christian Buddhist Muslim Jewish are that their agenda is the &~re reestablishing of the patriarchal family that that is their political agenda .
why why is it that then these movements are growing in low income communities in the black community .
why is the fundamentalist church growing in the black community at this point ?
&-uh well I I I first wanna say that that it is startling the extent to which all of the &~fan fundamentalisms share this agenda about controlling women and putting them back in their place .
&-um I think the idea of &-uh of the nonworking wife is very attractive to poor people who haven't had the luxury of &~work of of &~hav &=laughs of being a nonworking wife .
&-uh in in other words that that the right wing holds out certain promises to women that sound very good &-uh if you're if you have grown up &-uh in &-uh violent households where your father abandoned you and your mother hadta do all the work and raise the children &-uh and or your and and he was also an alcoholic and blah blah blah .
so if you grow up in that kind of &-uh &-uh &-uh of very &~dif or even if it's not he wasn't violent you know you had this terrible struggle to survive and your your mother was doing much of the work and so on .
&-uh the promise that's held out by the Promise Keepers &=laughs:multiple &-uh is this ideal family where this guy is going to &-uh &-uh shape up &-uh stop drinking stop beating his wife and children &-um &=laughs:multiple work hard &-uh bring his +//.
not drink his money away but bring it home support the family and she will then be able to stay home and take care of the family that just that sounds like heaven &=laughs you know compared to what's &-uh going on in disrupted families .
so that's that's the promise and it's it's not too surprising that a_lot_of poor black people buy into that because what they've known is the mother trying to do everything .
&-um &-uh the &~p problem is that the promise is largely deceptive .
&-uh except for a a fairly high income level men are not earning the kind of wage that allows the woman not to work .
there's no way that you can reconstruct that nonworking wife except at &-uh a high income level and the high income level of_course by and large is precisely where you want to have an even higher income &=laughs by having a professional working wife .
and you know they can then hire somebody to take care of the children and so on .
so it it the problem is that it is is essentially delusionary it's a &~h trying to hail back to a a a pattern of life which is just not really available anymore .
and &~o and of_course it's preparing a_lot_of young women &-uh for disaster because then they're they're gonna commit themselves to the idea they're gonna marry some guy who's gonna take care of them for the rest of their life .
and then when they get abandoned divorced or or or he simply is not able to to do that kind of work they have not &~e gotten the educational skills for a good job .
and and and of_course we could &-uh &-uh I_mean even if you have a fairly good partnership the the likelihood of a you_know husband dying and the wife having to survive for a number of years is &~s still open .
in other words if if women do not prepare themselves to to be able to be self-supporting and if they commit themselves to the idea that they're gonna be supported for the rest of their lives they're committing themselves to a delusion .
so it's really ultimately very cruel yeah ?
&-um I have been an an Episcopal minister for about forty five years .
uhuh +/.
+, and I share completely and totally your vision of the church as all inclusive of all races and all configurations of commitment .
&-um the issue that I see and I'm trying to face this pragmatically are , one , how do you bring a congregation to some kind of unity about that ?
and if you are able to do that then how do you communicate that to the people outside whom you really want to have come in ?
uhuh well maybe you just can't do all that .
maybe you <can't do all that> +/.
+, maybe what you could do is try to create a community that's that has worked through this to the point where they they they really can welcome &-uh let's say &-uh a lesbian couple who's raising a child and and so on .
&-uh and &-uh and you're not gonna be able to to to &~ex &-um get everybody in the world on board with it &~a like in your denomination and so on &-uh &~s because I do think there's this this profound &-um division in the churches where where people really do not share &-uh the same presuppositions .
&-uh <but I> but I'm seeing all kinds of wonderful things happen I mean there there's &-um a Methodist church of &~f &~f friends of mine &-uh in a a a very poor working class area of Chicago that where where the older strata of the church are are mainly &-uh elderly white people and then there's a whole new group of people move in <that are> that are mainly gay and lesbian +/.
+, ⌈ cool ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-uh ⌋ and the older people are just they're learning to love each_other .
and the gay and lesbian folks are <you know> &-uh you know &~a as one friend mine said the the there's &~ab the church is about fifty percent gay and lesbian but the but it's &-uh the choir is ninety five percent gay and lesbian .
&=laughs:multiple you know in other words the ⌈ the people who ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that's true in a_lot_of churches ⌋ +/.
+, are really working to ⌈ create ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ cool ⌋ +/.
+, community .
and and the and they're they're the &~r and and the the older people are are really learning that these are very loving people .
<and they're> and they're really giving them &-uh &-uh a concern &-uh about their lives that that they haven't experienced .
I_mean their own children have abandoned them and suddenly there's these young folks who really care about these older people .
so I I mean I I'm just saying that there're ways in which this kind of diversity is actually working in reality .
yeah ?
I was just having another idea that I I probably &-uh shouldn't say but if everybody doesn't sit under a klieg light and know exactly what everybody else is doing there're an awful lot of churches where there are very far right and very far left people and they don't quite know what each_other think and they aren't very thoughtful and philosophical so they don't hate each_other .
yeah ⌈ that's true ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ they know ⌋ each_other and they go to the same picnics .
⌈ my brother's church is like that that &-uh so ⌉ .
⌊ that's right right yeah ⌋ I mean yeah most &~cath most Catholic churches are like that .
&=laughs:multiple .
at best .
I mean it's kind_of you know anonymous and there's ten thousand of you anyway and there's eight masses and you know and &-uh and so you can kinda get along because you communicate on a kinda superficial level so that's you know one way to do it &=laughs:multiple yeah ?
but some of that is because &-uh I think Christians in churches are encouraged not to talk about something that would be &~a &-uh appear to be antiscriptural .
uhuh +/.
+, and so &-uh people have not shared which is what she seems to be ⌈ saying ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, what they think or what they worry about or wonder about and so there isn't an &~inter there is not an interchange ⌈ of ideas ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ well I want to pick up the on what they think is nonscriptural because this is very interesting .
&~es essentially &-uh I think one of the crimes of &-uh the &-uh contemporary &-um clergy the theologically educated strata of the church is that they've gone to seminaries they know better .
&=laughs:multiple they know better .
or they should +/.
+, &-uh well by and large they do I mean they &~a they've studied historical critical they've studied the Bible .
they know that you cannot have a Christian Bible with Hebrew scripture and New Testament and believe that every word is literally inspired .
&~be for the simple reason that the New Testament critiques &-uh about thirty percent of Hebrew scripture and invalidates it .
+, yeah +/.
+, &=laughs so you cannot and you never +//.
and the Christian church has never read those texts about kosher laws and so on as scriptural precisely because you come out_of a tradition that critiques this .
this is why the rabbis &-uh orthodox rabbis in Israel forbid Jews to read a Bible that has the New Testament in it .
did you know that ?
&=laughs:SUm they do &-uh and and quite understandably &=laughs you know because the New Testament is invalidates &-uh the law &-uh so it's &~impos it's literally impossible &-uh to treat all the Bible as all literally inspired and so this idea is basically &-uh not a way anybody actually reads the Bible what it is it's an ideology +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, that only works if you keep the Bible zipped up and use it to hit people with .
&=laughs:multiple you don't actually study it .
so &-um I really think that we have to stop this and and and the clergy hafta be educators of their people and they have to bring the people on board with a version of the same education they receive .
(be)cause what we're &~jus we're opening ourself up to the schism which happened in the Southern Baptists .
where where where the fundamentalists essentially engaged in a kind of backlash against the educated strata of the church and tried to drive them out_of the seminaries .
which is what happened to the Southern Baptists +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, &-uh and then it's straight comes straight out_of the fact that the clergy have neglected their job one of their jobs which is to educate their people .
and really to create an adult laity that that &-uh you know knows &=laughs at least basic &-um understanding of of the Bible church history of theology and so on .
yeah ?
what are you gonna think +//.
what's gonna happen in the United States now (be)cause we have like a John Ashcroft there and I believe he's a fundamentalist .
right +/.
+, and &-uh of_course we have Pat Robertson which is he's continually around .
and &-uh now I'm a Catholic and &-um so the Pope has appointed a_lot_of bishops that are Opus Dei +/.
+, right +/.
+, &-uh and I I had somebody run that off on the internet for me and &-uh definitely women &-er have to do all the housework men cannot do any of the housework .
oh really ?
yeah it &~i you run that off the internet and you'll find out .
okay &=laughs:multiple now &-uh I guess these these priests &-uh have +//.
can't do any housework either then .
&=laughs:multiple they have to &-uh hire ⌈ &-uh ⌉ +/.
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, high school students &-uh (be)cause they don't have any wives &-uh at least theoretically .
&-uh well I think I to me <this is> this is just a continuation of what I said this profound polarization and this polarization is now deeply into our public political system .
I mean you have somebody who who ran for president you know &-uh claiming that he &-uh his main consultant in political decisions was Jesus .
&-uh and and his first question in any decision was what would Jesus do ?
but he seemed to think that this Texas Jesus was very hot on &~crim &-uh capital punishment .
&=laughs:multiple <and so> &-uh and so I mean I I just think we have this profound polarization <which is> which is not simply the church's it's &~a it's across the whole &-uh society .
so <I mean> &-uh I mean when Bush was elected I didn't like Gore that much but I mean I really the thought occurred to me to just join some other country .
&=laughs:multiple I mean I'm I'm I'm not gonna do that but &-uh well let me &-uh okay yeah ⌈ <I think> we have time ⌉ .
⌊ &-uh well people ⌋ are always saying &-uh the progressives don't have the power in the church because the conservatives have &~m so much more money and and stuff &-um can you speak to that ?
I I think the the &~lib the liberals have &-uh adequate &~num amount of money I mean a_lot_of the conservatives are not +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ wealthy ⌋ people but there &~th there has been a way of +//.
they've been working on +//.
or some leaders have been organizing .
I think the liberals have to organize .
&=laughs:multiple yeah Betsy ?
