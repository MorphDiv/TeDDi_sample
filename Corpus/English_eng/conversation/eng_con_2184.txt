Liz . 623700_624030
it was on a message on my machine when I came home from this

&=lipsmack . 633540_633750

&=breath Lizzy I know how up in the a- you know when I was in
thinking about whether w- wanted to go into biophysics or wanted to
And . 659210_659550
I I knew it was obviously because what I really wanted to do was go
But I went into biophysics . 666500_667860
By the end of the year I'd met Daddy and I decided that was going
I really wanted to . 668520_672840
i- I really Daddy was really going to be the one . 672970_675470
&=breath I got . 675620_676160
very unhappy with the science . 676320_677720
and . 678740_678990
I just walked out of one lab and I said no this is it .
I just don't want it . 679220_682820
I wanted to be teaching little kids .
Because Daddy was at that point noncommittal . 683310_687060
to say the least . 688840_689780
And &-um and he was also leaving for Syracuse . 690170_693000
And so a friend of mine sat down with me, Wayne Meyers and he said
guy .
He was the one I cried whose shoulder I cried on when I took
the doctor had given it to me for cramps and I . 702680_704670
ended up getting &-um depressed for twenty four hours . 705050_707770
um . 708600_709110
and . 710230_710750
he said to me . 711960_712730
you really want to change .
I said yeah I really want to go .
He says well take the bus across the river this afternoon . 712850_718140
&=breath . 718320_718780
because I had already applied and been accepted to the I mean it
and to &-um Harvard School of Ed . 724250_725990
And I didn't apply to any other ed schools because I figured I
And I went across the river that day . 732390_734120
and I said can I get into your next year's class .
And they said absolutely . 734740_738070
And I mean by then it was like May . 738950_740780
Certainly April . 741190_742060
Certainly April not . 742200_743050
not not earlier . 743170_744020
&=breath . 745020_745300
And . 745540_745820
I remember Mama Sadie was upset about it .
But everybody knew why I was doing it and everybody kn- e- it was
I had to do that for a while .
I couldn't just study science for a while . 753840_757060
And . 757780_758080
I was twenty two . 758700_759830
twenty one . 760390_761120
And and &-um . 762390_763790
yeah I guess I was twenty two already . 764770_766590
um and &-um . 766710_768030
a- and . 769000_769820
and a- a- it's it's not any rational kind of thing Liz .
It's hormonal . 772760_776670
It's absolutely hormonal .
I mean here you are, you are thirty . 776910_780170
And it's no wonder . 780720_781940
it's no wonder that that that you don't know what you want to do . 783810_786530
I didn't know what I wanted to do at that stage .
Well I did but it was out of reach .
And for you it's obviously out of reach too . 786580_792230
Unless it works out with Matt . 792390_793780
you haven't met him . 794110_795030
And therefore . 796650_797630
I'm I'm . 798620_799280
I I &=breath . 799720_800420

because I don't see I don't see I mean &=breath . 806900_809010
I I I I I've I've known so many people who didn't get married and
It's very . 816220_816920
sad . 817110_817660
I find it very sad .
I didn't expect that I would be in this position . 818000_822410
with my children . 822960_823950
Well . 824370_824620
actually I expected it with Jonathan .
I expected to worry about him not you . 824830_828380
because he was very slow socially . 831260_833060
And and and you know you never can tell with life .
There aren't any rules about it . 834190_838030
and &-uh th- nobody has nobody has written the future . 839030_842380
And it's not really it's it's &-uh eh prayer and &-uh . 842960_847100
eh penitence doesn't really help .
It's going to happen, things are going to happen when it happen
But you have to &=breath there there are ways to help them along . 847540_855250
There are ways to help them along .
And maybe you're doing them but I don't see it . 855590_859280
I know you went out with some guy the other night . 860380_862240
May- maybe you are looking actively but I I don't see it .
So all I can do is sit and worry . 862350_866600
and be concerned . 868690_869760
and . 869910_870150
I don't . 870540_870920
think that you would . 871450_872590
Can we talk about the job things now ? 871610_873640
that &=breath . 874370_875000
&=breath Well what about the job things ?
I I can't talk about them .
I don't know anything about them .
You want to tell me about them ? 875960_881060
Well you don't like the job I just took . 880920_882830
&=breath Now wait a moment . 883130_883950
Don't . 884720_885110
Well Daddy says they're less important than the other stuff and I
But don't tell me I don't like the job you just took Lizzy .
I don't know enough about it . 889410_893310
You know I raised you and . 895930_897380
I I thought I was . 897540_898510

So maybe I can sign . 898310_899530
ten hours in the school district doing something else &=siren . 899850_907580
Maybe you can .
eh it's it's . 907430_909380
that would be that would be interesting if . 910000_911900
you know you have hours during the week that are available . 912090_914370
Don't don't don't block them out until you find out whether or not

Lizzy, you might not .
I haven't figured out mine yet . 955010_957540
You're a scientist . 957980_959650
I'm a scientist Liz, that's a pretty poor showing for a scientist .
Ma, are you kidding ?
Look how many days you go into the lab . 963770_966410
I know .
Look what I've published .
One paper . 966020_968360
So who cares about publishing . 968730_970410
Well that's what otherwise, otherwise, I I'm I'm cooking and
It's it's recycling it's . 975830_977240
it's work- working that nobody nobody ever knows about .
That's not what defines me as a person .
What defines me as a person is is is my family . 977340_984950
&=breath . 983740_984200
And your failure daughter . 986900_988450
That's what I'm feeling sad about at the moment . 989810_992110
I just I'm not going to be able to figure out what I want to do .
