this was a dark night about ten o'clock at night .
and a man was standing at the side of a building .
and it seems as if there was a light on .
and it showed that, no, he lit a cigarette .
and the match put a glow on his face .
so a policeman was passing by .
he stopped .
and he was looking at the policeman .
and <the policeman> he said to the policeman +"/.
+" it's okay officer .
+" I'm waiting for a friend .
+" <there was> we made this appointment twenty years ago .
+" and I was to meet him here at this exact spot at ten p_m .
so they waited .
and waited .
and the policeman became skeptical .
and they started walking .
they walked away rather .
and all_of_a_sudden the policeman stopped him .
and explained to him that he was a plainclothes man .
this is wrong .
a plainclothes man .
and they had been looking for .
no back up .
the man and the policeman were talking .
then another man came up .
they walked away .
and another man came .
this was this other guy .
and this guy asked him if his name was <I forgot> Steve .
he said “yes” he was Steve .
so the socalled policeman said that he was an undercover cop
and he arrested this guy because someone had told him that this guy
and he was on the wanted list .
and the policeman locked him up .
that's all I remember .
I worked in Philadelphia .
I was there about twelve years .
and I was sent there to go to to help the postoffice in
I was the mother of two children two boys .
and in a year I brought my boys up to Philadelphia to live with me
they belonged to a boys' club .
parents were supposed to go to the boys' club to assist .
or see how the children were doing .
I did that .
the management <of the post> &~off of the boys' club liked the
and they offered me a job .
but I told them I already had a job at the postoffice .
so then they asked me if they sent me to school would I accept the
and I said “okay” .
they sent me to the University_of_Pennsylvania and
I took up the courses of juvenile delinquency and juvenile justice
I worked with them for twelve years .
in the meantime, my boys were getting a little older .
<and they met a> one night they came home .
and they told me they had this little girl .
and her little brother .
and it was cold .
and they wanted to know if the kids could stay .
spend the night at my house because their dad was very cruel to
later on and this became a pattern .
so I decided to investigate to find out exactly what was happening
I went to see the parents .
but it seems that down in the deep South +...
the father came from the deep South .
and in the deep South when the kids get thirteen years of age, they
and they work on the farm .
but in the North that isn't right .
but the father refused to support these two kids .
so I decided to become their mentor .
and I found that I could do much better with the girl .
the girl clung to me better than the boy .
so I started sponsoring both of the kids everyday .
giving them carfare to school .
assisting them with clothes and lunch and so forth .
I did this still working with the gangs in Philadelphia .
and when my boys became of age .
and graduated from highschool .
they went into the navy .
and then I found myself in Philadelphia alone .
so I thought it was time .
my father thought it was time for me to come back home to DC .
so I came back here down to DC .
I was here .
when I told the young lady that you_know I was coming back to DC
and she threatened that she was going to do something to herself .
and I talked to her .
and I counseled her for about two weeks .
and then I thought everything was fine .
I returned to DC .
and I was here about a month .
one Friday evening I came home .
and this young lady was sitting on my porch .
and she had her suitcase with her .
and she saw me .
and I was so surprised .
and she started crying .
and I said +"/.
+" well, what the heck is wrong with you .
+" and how did you get here .
so she was crying .
and she said she did something wrong .
and she thought she was going .
she said +"/.
+" I know I'm going to jail .
and I said +"/.
+" well, what did you do ?
+" who did you rob ?
she said +"/.
+" I robbed my father .
+" my father was drunk .
+" and I took thirty dollars out of his pocket .
+" and I caught a bus .
+" and here I am .
and she said things went back the way they were .
so I said “okay” .
I called her parents .
and her mother was happy to find out where she was .
but the father says +"/.
+" don't bring that little so+and+so back
I said “okay” .
+" but I'll need something because she has to go to school .
I was trained under a federal judge in Philadelphia as part of my
and I called Judge_Wynette .
and I explained to him what had happened .
and he says to my husband and I to bring the child up there on
he made an appointment .
we did this .
and Judge_Wynette called the parents .
and the father refused to come .
so Judge_Wynette sent two detectives to pick up the mother and the
in seven hours, I had adoption papers .
<Judge_Wynette> federal judge Wynette gave me adoption papers
we brought her back to DC .
and I had to take her to the doctors and everything .
and I put her in Saint_Anne's academy .
and she graduated full honors from Saint_Anne's academy .
and then she returned to Philadelphia to find some work .
and Pat worked at Hannimon hospital .
she saw the nurses .
and the secretaries doing certain things .
so she became a medical secretary .
she went to school night school .
and became a secretary .
in the meantime, Pat had gotten married .
Pat sent herself through school pregnant .
she graduated .
when she did get a job as a medical secretary, she said she became
and she wanted to know what were they doing with these instruments
so then, she decided to go to nursing school .
she became a nurse .
today Pat has three girls and two grandchildren .
she is the best daughter anyone could have .
she's very attentive as far as I'm concerned .
very loving .
and she is the daughter I didn't give birth to .
that's my story .
