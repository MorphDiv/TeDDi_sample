okay Becky, what do you remember about our discussion ? 0_40138
um, you traced Chris's hand and we tried to fill it up with beans
okay . 47026_47639
I traced Ben's hand wand we tried to fill that hand shape with
why didn't it work ? 54838_56341
why weren't we happy with that as a way of measuring how much space
Ben please keep you hands still . 61943_63821
Tim why weren't we happy with these beans . 63821_66836
because the beans weren't all the same size . 66836_68093
okay the beans weren't all the same size . 67608_69281
do you remember anything from last week, Kelly ? 69281_71841
yeah . 71841_72711
what do you remember ? 72711_73785
spaghetti . 73785_74895
spaghetti . 74895_75701
we talked about filling the space of each person's hand with
why did spaghetti seem like a good idea ? 79631_82054
what made us think of spaghetti ? 82054_83727
what is it about the spaghetti that people thought would work well ?
um, cooking it, and twists, um, twist it, um all different ways . 86926_95856
okay, after it was cooked, we we thought we could twist it and
okay . 104462_123654
but Stephanie sees a problem with counting the squares inside the
it just took up a little space like that . 127630_133545
and you wouldn't know if it was like a quarter or how much space
yeah, because it's split in half . 143083_145314
it had the whole square . 145314_148538
Stephanie said it would be easy to tell some of the squares . 148538_151299
Stephanie show me some squares that would be easy to count inside
here . 154375_154991
okay . 154991_155904
and what makes those squares easy to count ? 155904_158703
because they're not cut, or like in half, or +... 158827_163306
okay . 163306_163795
so they're whole squares inside Kelly's hand print . 163795_167322
and show me again . 167322_168349
which post you saw might cause problems when we were counting
right here . 171713_172889
um, right here . 172889_175537
why would they be hard to count ? 175537_177824
because their wh(ole) the whole finger wouldn't be around the
okay so look at that one . 184825_186322
we could put Tim's idea was that could we find two parts and
but if we do that what has to be special or true about the two
they have to go together to make just one whole square . 198808_202562
they can't go together to make more than a square . 202562_205967
okay . 205967_206620
Jess is looking at part of a square near the top and part of a
see if you can see . 212645_214011
she thinks if she takes this which is what I don't know maybe
and this this looks like a little more than half than this she
could we just using the shapes on the board find out what island is
no . 255924_257547
no . 257547_259744
Danny said he thinks maybe we could . 259744_261984
what could we do to find out which one is the biggest Danny ? 261984_264233
Danny says maybe we could take the one we think is biggest and put
a lot of you said maybe we're thinking this is one of the biggest
shh . 276993_277389
if I lay that over say +... 277389_280016
I don't know where's another one we thought some people
if I lay this over +... 286089_288048
that would be hard . 288048_289952
why if that hard ? 289952_291309
because the peninsula is way in . 291309_294798
the other ones don't go in as far . 294798_298788
okay so the bays and peninsulas do make this an interesting
sort of like finding your hand print how much space it covered . 305627_310545
we could do the same thing we did for our hands . 310545_312087
yeah . 312087_312489
we could do the same thing we did for our hands ? 312489_314071
Andy is that what you were thinking ? 314071_317009
yeah xxx . 316885_317910
remember I told you I'd show you a variation of the strategy we
a slightly different way to do it . 323658_326930
thought of by second graders . 326930_330922
okay . 330922_331972
but is this going to help up if we keep going is this going to tell
no: ! 357154_358816
well if we keep doing this no . 358816_361408
but is this kind of thinking going to help us solve our problem ? 361408_365263
yeah ! 365263_365735
yes it is . 365616_366403
okay . 366403_367189
okay let's think about one more correction . 367189_371194
Jess when you were up here your first guess for one third of a
Michael and you took a closer look at and said it might be four
what fraction would that be ? 383144_384247
one fourth . 384247_384991
one fourth . 384991_385655
or a quarter . 385655_387066
or a quarter . 387066_388065
you remembered we talked about xxx . 388065_392366
this is the spot Jess found . 392366_394101
that was about a quarter of a square she said . 394101_398161
hmm this one had a pink side of ten inches . 398161_425671
this had a pink side of eight inches . 425671_428416
this one had a green side of four inches . 428416_431522
this has a green side of five inches . 431522_434069
would you like me to label that ? 434069_435709
yes . 435709_436806
Becky you said to me could can you measure the inside . 436806_439492
tell me what you mean by that . 439492_440365
(re)memeber we were arguing about what, if it was the same size or
if the rectangle was the same size ? 446127_449656
I was thinking maybe you could, like, Misses Curtis could measure
okay . 455241_455645
I think Becky I think you already know how far across it is
xxx five inches . 459492_463385
five inches . 463385_464345
xxx do you think that's true or not ? 464345_466014
yes xxx . 466014_467999
Stephanie why do you think it's five inches . 467999_469672
see if Becky buys that argument see if she agrees with that . 469672_472960
it could be all the way down to the bottom, five inches, and um,
okay so your saying that any where I measure in here what will I
five inches . 488798_490051
Brian and xxx why do you say it couldn't be five inches . 490051_494446
because, um, the, um, both of (th)em are going, um straight down,
okay if you are saying that this was five inches and if the one at
I'm going to make this one a bit bigger . 514811_516029
that you could have this line going . 516029_517296
