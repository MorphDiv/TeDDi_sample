oh I was bleeding I &-uh . 476340_478740
oh . 478070_478380
had blood in my stools and so I got real sick and . 479660_484250
I guess I have colitis . 485630_487960
&-mm . 488050_488590
&=smacks:lips and &-uh &=breathes stuff so . 489180_493030
babysitting probably &=laughs isn't the best thing although they
stress caused it's a genetic disorder or whatever but &-um . 500900_506710
it doesn't help it either it causes it to flare up so . 509820_512990
yeah will they tell you to watch your diet are you on any . 511220_514400
no he said to do nothing &+bu I mean they basically said if . 514680_518469
if I know something bothers me then avoid it but there's really
preventative medicine for it &-uh and the medicines they use to
are not something they want you to stay on permanently because
&-hm . 535980_536320
I guess cancer mainly I don't know he didn't go into all that but
anyway so when I get sick and I guess start
and they'll put me on medicine which they use steroids so
oh because both my mom and my sister have colitis . 560250_562930
mhm . 563230_563730
and they told my sister off and on that they had come up with quite
that could really ease her because she has you know it flares up
then they said there were quite a few things out there that &-um
mhm . 580460_580990
mean &+a it doesn't get rid of it obviously but at least it'll make
yeah . 584740_585270
but but I don't know what's . 585530_587790
I was thinking I was going to go to the health food store and see
there's so many different kinds of colitis he &+sa he didn't really
a broad range of things and there's irritable bowel disease . 602450_606900
right . 606900_607470
and there's inflammatory . 607720_609180
right . 609250_609700
which inflammatory is what I have and that's a genetic disorder
type and not quite as serious because there's two different kinds
is a ulcerative colitis and one is &-um crones colitis . 628310_634130
&=channel_noise right . 633570_634440
and he told me within five years I would probably have crones
well that's what . 638570_639380
which is better than the other because the other turns into cancer
they they told don that he has crones well, doctors have at you
you know that sounds like you've got crones but without further
thank you babe &-um he won't ever go to have another test done . 662100_666990
well well, I had to have surgery they put that scope . 666760_669870
you know because they're not the most yeah . 667640_670680
I've been there, but they put you out so . 670790_673270
I guess oh well he doesn't even want to do any of the you know like
&-um either an enema or the you know where you have to drink it he
yeah . 681620_682170
mhm . 698430_705860
and I made a doctor's appointment for him well before school was
mhm . 712410_712900
and don cancelled it because he thought because it was like at two
