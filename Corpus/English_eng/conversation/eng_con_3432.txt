I think it's about +...
there's a boy who found a frog .
and &-um +/.
you know what ?
you can sort of look at each page as you tell me .
you don't hafta tell me from your memory okay ?
there's a boy who found a frog .
and the frog got loose .
and he goes through all this trouble <finding> trying to find
<and the> and the very last thing that happened is +...
wait I needta get back +...
<he gets caught> he looks in some bushes and gets caught on a
and the deer throws him into the lake .
<and then> and then he sees a log .
and &-um he looks behind him .
and he sees like this frog with his <mother> mother and father
he puts the frog in .
and they live happily ever after .
okay .
this time they're probably thinking you know I found a frog .
and the frog's happy .
and &-um <the dog's like> he's you know looking at the frog
of_course dogs know everything because dogs just have some sort of
and he probably knows something's gonna happen .
<and> &-um and you can see the frog smiling saying you can't
and then <the> the boy's probably having a good dream because
and the dog's having an afraid dream because he could tell .
yeah ?
he could tell .
what can he tell ?
<he could tell> <he> <when he> when he was looking at
his nose is like so attractive like .
I can't really explain it .
his nose is really sensitive to smells ?
yeah .
<and it> <and> and it knows if something's bad .
or if something's good .
so it's probably having a little bad dream .
so then when they wake up they are scared .
the boy is totally frightened .
and the dog you know thinking how did I know this would happen ?
and then on this page they're looking everywhere to find him .
and the dog <is> is sniffing .
and they're getting closer because the dog +...
and the dog's looking in the bottles .
he better to see if he's in there .
and the boy's just looking under shoes and stuff .
it looks like maybe he's saying something ?
yeah he's probably saying frog frog where are you ?
and the dog says right here .
and this is <the> &-um another detail .
&-um <the frog> <what am I saying frog> the dog falls off
<and he gets mad> and he gets mad because the bottle breaks .
oh .
and the dog is just like zzz licking away .
how did that happen ?
because he fell out_of the window .
oh right .
so he jumped out_of the window .
and this one they're calling him .
and the dog is like you know zzz .
you know .
and then this picture is just showing you where they're calling .
well this is like one whole picture .
you're right it is .
in this picture he's looking in there .
and the dog's like you know getting mad at the bees because they're
<and> &-um and then this chipmunk comes out and like is mad at
and the boy is mad because <he> he was just trying to find his
yeah he was and I wonder why he has his hands on his nose ?
&-um it's a skunk ?
oh maybe yeah .
maybe because it's really stinky ?
he's holding his nose .
yeah .
mhm .
(be)cause the skunk got mad .
is that boy saying anything there ?
no .
well not really because he's just xxx .
and then <the> <the> the dog gets mad and afraid because
and then he's just looking in there in this same picture .
yeah .
he's just looking .
and then +/.
before you go on is he &-um saying anything into that hole ?
oh yeah he's saying frog where are you ?
yeah I guess so .
and then the owl comes out .
oh no .
because +...
and then the bees are chasing the dog .
and the dog's getting stung poor dog .
and then +/.
poor guy .
and then he gets hit by the owl .
and they're getting in pretty much trouble .
and the owl is just looking at the guy .
he's calling frog frog .
and the owl's probably feeling +...
look at the owl .
he's probably feeling you know in one way embarrassed and in one
oh .
see ?
even_though he was just trying to find his frog .
yeah I'll bet he is .
the boy has sort of has his hand up here again like this .
yeah I know .
because he's calling the frog frog frog .
oh right .
and you see you can tell he's like a little worried .
you're right .
he does look worried .
and this time he looks in the bush .
and &-um a deer popped out .
and he gets mad .
and he throws him <in the> in the water .
same with the dog .
I wonder how he feels now .
<I mean> well he's like scared because there's this big deer
<I mean> and then the deer gets mad .
and the dog's like mad at the deer .
but then he probably kicks them off and throws the guy because see
and he throws the guy .
and then they are in this puddle .
<and then> and then he like has an idea because the dog
<and like> and he's barking .
and he's thinking he hears the frogs .
and then over here he says ssh because he wants to peek back there
and then he peeks <at> back there .
and he finds <a frog> two frogs .
<and then that frog> and then he hops over there because he's
and then back here I think the reason <he> he &-um went away
so he probably found some <and then he> <now he's>
and then he says bye .
and of_course there is one frog missing there .
and he's holding his frog .
and then that's the end
