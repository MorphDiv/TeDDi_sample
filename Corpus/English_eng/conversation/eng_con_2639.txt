okay &-um &-um &-um I guess &~usual usually what we do at these meetings is just sort of go around and &-uh talk about what we've been doing &-um +/. 767565_782665
+, I have oops what ? 785205_787265
+, did I ? 787865_788285
oh it &-um I have a &-um notice here that you may have already seen and &-um that I'll pass around &-um our MELAB &-uh testing program is undergoing some changes &-um first of all I should tell you what is not changing &-um we will continue to administer individual and group MELABs in the United States and Canada . 788325_818305
however after June thirtieth &-um we will not have any &-um MELABs administered overseas &-uh there is one exception which might not affect people here at the University of Michigan very much and that's &-um Iran we have been testing in Iran and &-um actually most of those students end up going to Canadian universities . 819835_844155
&-um the the reason for this &-uh was that it was becoming more and more cost ineffective &-um to have these make complicated arrangements for individual tests &-uh overseas and it just wasn't worth the the the time we were putting into it . 845025_865065
and &-um <the other> the other thing is the the TOEFL test as you may know &-uh has &-uh changed &-um to a &-uh computer delivered &-uh test &~i in &-uh most places in I think with the exception of some Asian countries the far east . 865745_886685
&-um the TOEFL &-uh <will be> will be given &-um &-uh via computer delivered tests and &-uh people can take those TOEFL tests &-uh pretty much on demand . 887505_900785
they don't hafta the tests are not given like every six weeks . 900945_904345
&-um I think initially they're having a few problems with &-uh a waiting list of people signing up to take the test but that probably should eventually that logjam should eventually &-um break down . 905145_917585
so that's about all I have to say . 919085_922425
so &-um (0.4) .
do we go this way or that way ? 923145_929745

there are a variety of ways to get permission to &-uh to be employed . 1538315_1544735
&-uh it it's different for the f@l one student compared <to the> to the j@l one student . 1545895_1552255
&-uh basically there are two ways &-um the +//. 1552835_1558495
if if a if an f@l one student has an offer of a specific internship and if if they can can document and we usually use a letter from their academic advisor or one of their professors if they can document that this internship constitutes an integral part of their established program if it's closely related to their research then we can give them the permission on the spot . 1559785_1589765
to to take the &-uh to take the job . 1593675_1596955
that's the fastest way . 1598295_1599575
&-uh &-uh to do it . 1600315_1601315
if they have a specific internship lined up in advance if they don't have something specific lined up in advance or if they can't show somehow that it's an integral part of &-uh of their curriculum they can still apply &~f for a carte_blanche permit to go out and work anywhere they want in their field without having a specific job lined up in advance . 1601595_1629795
but in_order_to get that kind of permit they have to send an application and pay a small fee to the immigration office and it takes a month or six weeks <&-uh to get the> &-uh to get the permit . 1630425_1645565
&-um these two programs are referred to as practical training programs +/. 1646225_1651445
+, mm +/.
+, and <the one> the one that hasta be based <on a> on a specific &-uh internship is called curricular practical training and the one that's just carte_blanche is called optional practical training . 1651625_1666465
but we &~w we we're constantly involved in &-uh in xxx so <we have> we have workshops <throughout the> throughout the semester and we have handouts and we use to &-uh mostly the students are generally aware that +... 1667505_1685045
uhuh .
do they hafta be enrolled at the time that they take the internship ? 1687385_1691525
I'm sorry ? 1692025_1692465
do they hafta be enrolled at the time that they're doing ? 1692605_1694705
no . 1695705_1695885
no . 1695885_1698045
&-uh do they still have two types of internships where there's the kind of pre bachelor's degree and then there's the practical training which which is +//. 1698045_1707285
they're eligible for after receiving their ⌊ degree ⌋ . 1707585_1709465
⌈ okay they ⌉ &-uh +... 1709465_1712885
the &~f the first kind of internship that's based on a specific &-uh &-uh job related <to the> to the field the one that's called curricular practical training can only be given prior to graduation okay ? 1715135_1733415
and can be given on a part+time basis or a full+time basis . 1733675_1737615
if it's given on a &~f if it's given on a part+time basis during the academic year then the student must continue to be registered as a full+time student . 1738845_1752445
okay ? 1753505_1753585
if it's given on a full+time basis during the academic year then the student doesn't hafta be registered at all while they are doing the job full+time . 1755405_1768445
if it's given for during the vacation term then the student doesn't need to be registered &-uh anyway but they can be if they &-uh <if they> if they wish . 1769345_1783085
the other program called the optional practical training oh I +//. 1783865_1790585
and I should say that the first one the curricular practical training is unlimited there's no time limit on how many months a person could actually do this . 1790705_1804685
theoretically over a five year period or a six year period a person might &~s spend two or three years at different times doing curricular practical training . 1805155_1819515
however the other practical training program the optional practical training program is restricted to a total of twelve months you can borrow part of this before you graduate or you can save up and wait and use it all after you graduate . 1819955_1837995
however if a student participates in twelve months or more of the curricular practical training if they participate on a full+time basis then after they graduate they they forfeit using the optional practical training . 1838115_1866635
however if they sign up for curricular practical training on a part+time basis before they graduate then they don't lose anything no matter how long they worked on a part+time basis . 1867215_1883135
now a person who wants to get optional practical training has a choice of borrowing before they graduate . 1884155_1894215
and you can borrow on either part+time basis or a full+time basis . 1895205_1900005
if you borrow on a part+time basis before you graduate then you lose one month of your postcompletion practical training for every two months that you work prior to completion on a part+time basis . 1900785_1918685
if you borrow on a full+time basis before you graduate then for every month that you work before you graduate one month would be deducted from the twelve month total after you graduate . 1919325_1932325

alright .
&-uh I'd just like a few things about the center .
and &-uh we've just gotten through with our internship funding .
and we see an interesting trend in that we +//.
I think in the Business School there are fewer and fewer people applying for international internship funding which is interesting +/. 2481035_2488135
⌊ hm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so we've ⌉ &-uh we've been funding a_lot_of &-uh students from the School of Natural Resources which is +/. 2488515_2495775
+, oh that's interesting +/. 2496055_2497035
+, yeah yeah yeah and they're they're working on these fascinating projects . 2497175_2501035
and most of them are in Eastern Europe . 2501335_2503155
and they're working <on pollution> and what to do with it . 2503495_2508195
and so some of their their internships sound sound really fascinating . 2508065_2512925
we've also funded a number of people from the Law School a number of undergraduates a_lot_of them from the &-uh German Department . 2513405_2521625
there's a woman there who's been really active in finding internships for their students there +/. 2521865_2527585
+, hm +/.
+, so depends you know if there's a good contact in any given department trying to find internships we find that we get a_lot of of &~wind &-uh applicants and also we funded a number of students who've applied both to the International Institute and also applied to our center for funding .
the other thing we're offering right now is &-uh funding to obtain summer language programs +/. 2546675_2551555

for the joint MBA and area studies &-uh students . 2558125_2561825
but we'll consider anybody for instance in the MBA program who would be taking a language at the expense of a very &-uh you_know I mean the opportunity <cost is> an internship paying a_lot_of money so &-uh we consider students who you know prefer a language over their internships so we will consider funding it to study a language . 2562705_2584705
&-uh currently we have &-uh a study tour going on to &-uh Japan &-uh Singapore and there are eighteen people on that trip a combination of PhD students faculty and &-uh MBAs . 2585705_2602645

one other thing that I just wanted to quickly mention &-um is that we are trying we will continue to try to get particularly the Korean group together &-um in the fall the undergraduate students who have +//. 3483455_3498775

I haven't even had a chance to talk to you about this (be)cause it it just came to xxx &-um so &~peo it'll be very helpful &-um to to get some of you involved in some of these presentations to help them understand what the resources are around campus . 3528545_3547925

okay well other &-um nonimmigration international sort_of things . 4255355_4259495
&-uh we're still &-um we still have our North Campus office of_course . 4260595_4264235
what's probably going to &-um to happen with that is during the summer it's probably going to go to halftime and will just be &-um open from eight to twelve and our assistant director Mary Coppler will be up up there . 4264025_4275605
and then &-um the second advisor Terri Mancini will be down on central campus &-um in part helping with &-um our overseas opportunities office because &-um all the students that &-um are still around and that aren't haunting &-um Scott's hallways are over &-um in the International Center finding out more information about +//. 4275745_4295345

so that office <tends to be> &-um tends to be quite busy and &-um .
so is she getting paid to work down there ? 4307625_4308665
for the summer ?
&-um well yes she'll be &-um well she'll get a regular salary +/. 4309425_4312885
+, ⌈ instead of &-um ⌉ she just will not +/. 4313305_4314705

+, we're just shifting her location . 4315245_4316525
so .
well that's well Dan must be very happy .
&-um oh yeah Dan is well . 4317625_4321065
Dan is &-uh he looks increasingly stressed every time I go by there because &-uh he's really just got students <stacked up> &-um stacked up too so <she'll be> &-um she'll be spending her &-um at least her afternoons doing that and then her &-um her mornings probably doing some work with international students . 4321365_4338905
&-um but on Central Campus because &-um we'll have some people going away on vacation and etcetera so we're &-um we're trying to kind_of even even the staffing &-um up a little bit . 4339225_4348845
but North Campus will stay open &-um all summer just &-um just on &-uh halftime basis and instead of a full+time basis . 4349125_4356065
the &-um I'm in the process of &-um finalizing the renewal for the international student health insurance now I haven't &-um well it's actually purchasing that signs on the dotted line &-um &-um and we're we're almost &-um at the signing on the dotted line point &-uh . 4356705_4375765
so you &~i &~i nothing is definite until we actually finalize that but &-um but <at that> at this point it's clear that &-um that the cost of the insurance will not go up it'll stay at the thirty dollars a month for the single students . 4376725_4389785
and we &-um we've had pretty good &-um experience with the insurance plan which means that &-um the students have the students have not had catastrophic illnesses thank goodness &-um so &-um we are able to &-um to actually add to the benefits a little bit . 4390125_4406765
and again not final but some of the things that I think <we're going to> &-um we're going to do &-uh up until now that insurance hasn't &-um hasn't had any provision for &-um preventive care and that's not so much of an issue for the students because enrolled students of_course can get all of that at Health Service &-um but for families it's more of an issue . 4406925_4428305
we're we're going to be able to add a little bit for &-um for children and be able to cover &-um well childcare and &-um standard childhood immunizations for children up to age three and then if we can &-um which is actually going to be because &-um of_course children at that age have to &-um have quite a few checkups . 4429145_4447725
and so that's actually going to be I think a help to the international student families and then if &-um you know that works alright and we still you know have pretty good experience with the plan then we'll slowly try and add a few more things . 4447925_4461025
the other things we're &-um we're trying to improve are the &-um the outpatient mental health coverage and &-um since counseling again for people like visiting scholars or nonenrolled students they &-um sometimes use that coverage . 4461365_4473825
and of_course some &-uh Counseling and Psychological Services is &-um very committed to making sure that students don't hafta wait a long period of time in_order_to be seen but that means that they're also doing more you know brief work with students . 4473845_4489045
so if a student needs to be in in counseling for a longer period of time they sometimes need to be referred out and then again they the mental health coverage is &-um is is helpful . 4489745_4499605
&-um and then <there are> &-um there are a_couple_of other &-um of other things we may be able to do as well just to &-um reduce the &-um the amount that the student potentially would have to pay <in a> in a serious illness . 4500225_4514245
&-um and the &-um the &~c coverage for the medical evacuation and repatriation is also <going to> &-um going to go up unfortunately we hadta use that coverage several times &-um last year and fortunately &-um it &-um no student went above the the cap on that &-um but you know it could happen . 4514705_4536505
so so we're we're kind of &-um you know slowly slowly improving it <which is> &-um which is good . 4536875_4543475
I should have the final word on that &-um you know probably by the end of this week or early next week and then &-um I'll let you know and as usual we will as soon as we get the text <of the> &-um of the brochure for next year we'll put it up on our website as well so that people can access it &-um from our website orientation . 4543755_4560995

right +/. 5117835_5117875
+, you know as students so . 5118055_5119815
when do you expect to have your new brochures printed up do you think ? 5120115_5122675
oh sometime in the mid summer but for people &-um &-um &~th the insurance contract year runs from September one through August thirty one so your &-um &-um your IGSIs will actually be falling under the current contract so you can have a bunch of brochures now if if you want . 5122805_5139385
okay .
so . 5140705_5140825
even though it runs for that length of time you have split payments of the premium right ? 5141025_5146565
well from the student's point of view it just runs continuously &-um what we do &-um is &-um is <we bill> &-um we bill the students for every term or part of a term &-uh so and we just you know so they &~g every term they're going to get a a bill . 5146735_5166555
so it's <one twentieth> terms +/. 5166575_5167895
right mhm +/. 5168995_5169315

you'd have thirty dollars for August and a hundred and twenty dollars . 5196945_5199225
and if it's falling +//. 5199625_5200265
if part of it if part of it fell into the &-um the spring summer term then they might have been billed &-um that for a summer term thirty dollars for a summer term bill then a hundred and twenty for the fall term a hundred and twenty for the winter . 5200465_5213905
thirty would cover the entire &-uh summer ? 5214005_5216125
no it's . 5217625_5218145
just that one month . 5218285_5219125
just that one month . 5219145_5219865
yeah yeah just from the billing perspective &-um what we do is &-um the person that that sends over those bills just does the billing once a term . 5220665_5229745
&-um I mean &~the they they actually are constantly sending things over because there are always corrections . 5230565_5234305

I'm staying longer blah blah blah . 5240165_5241205
&-um but what they're doing is they're looking at how long the student is enrolled within that particular term . 5241485_5245285
and if they're just enrolled for one month within a particular term then they're then for that term's billing there'll just be that one month . 5245815_5251515
