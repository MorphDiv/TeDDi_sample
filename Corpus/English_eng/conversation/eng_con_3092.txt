the best it can be . 22780_23510
right . 23640_23910
what will make you finish . 24070_25220
the best it can be . 26180_27180
as the three of you work together . 27500_28820
what will make you finish . 28910_29940
the best it can be . 30340_31110
it might end up to be symmetrical . 38020_39700
Sarah's saying she thinks maybe a symmetrical . 39880_41820
so . 42100_42230
we'll &-um like . 42650_44150
okay . 48230_48500
it might have lots_of the new shapes to make it a more interesting
remember the new shapes like the smaller red &-um triangles and the
okay . 59930_60070
what did I ask you to think about when you were choosing a two by
quilt . 65680_65870
I .
said . 66720_66810
well you'll have to look at all all three of the two by two
and what did I really want you to try to think about before you
&-um . 74700_74820
will the finished quilt be made from just one two by two design . 81980_84790
no . 84940_85000
nine . 89150_89340
nine of them . 89830_90310
so you'll have nine finished two by two designs . 90660_93990
making a finished quilt . 94100_95390
what do you need to imagine . 96510_97570
so just looking at this one . 97980_99260
does that tell you what the whole quilt is gonna . 99280_101100
look like . 101120_101320
no . 101540_101600
no . 101820_101930
no . 102260_102430
what do you have to think about or ask yourself . 102480_104550
maybe we could put the because Sarah did it the same on each . 105370_114890
and then that . 118380_119230
mhm . 119900_120040
it's symmetrical . 120710_121700
already it's symmetrical . 121720_123000
yes it's mhm . 125420_126040
so what Brian was saying . 128030_128940
he was saying . 128960_129350
well we could think about what it would look like . 129479_131060
flipped . 131160_131390
and he was thinking about an up down flip . 131610_132980
and he was realizing that if you could see through that I don't
he could tell from looking at this . 138100_139460
she made the top half the same as her bottom half . 139480_141620
and then Sarah showed us that . 142150_143380
yes . 143400_143600
she had done that also . 143620_144580
so an up down flip would look the same . 144840_145910
what_about a sideways flip with Sarah's look the same after a
was . 152860_152940
that a sideways flip . 153080_153900
did you . 154030_154230
say kind . 154280_157320
of hard to see with the construction paper compared to marker or
but can we look at the design . 165620_166550
Sarah you showed me it was symmetrical like this is it is your
symmetrical . 170260_170780
any other way . 170820_171430
yeah . 171830_172040
we don't want our pieces to come off . 175340_176630
this way . 178390_178740
okay . 179170_179350
so if I divided it like right here I . 179990_182770
can you show us . 182840_186370
the way that yours is . 187980_188630
so . 188870_189450
to Ashley . 189020_190040
yeah . 191740_191820
you don't have to really fold . 191840_192590
but if you're showing me with your hand where you would fold Ashley
also mine's just Trical okay . 199750_202710
well yours isn't finished yet . 203190_204460
you don't know if your finished design up those reds aren't all in
right . 208000_208180
now we'll work on that four square . 208280_210290
so Sarah's asked &-um . 211260_211990
&-um . 213730_213810
Ashley's saying that she could focus this way . 214120_215660
could you hold yours this way and have it be symmetrical . 216390_218750
no . 223620_223790
no this part wouldn't match . 224460_225740
but but hers is symmetrical this way . 226620_228360
if you look at this way it is this one has one line of symmetry . 228500_231740
and this one has two lines of symmetry . 231760_234020
see it wouldn't be exactly the same . 235460_237220
it's still orange and red orange . 237470_238580
but see how the triangle . 238740_239710
it would've to be like a diamond . 240160_241300
symmetrical because fold this half over it . 242250_244380
could go the . 244480_245070
Orange would go right there . 245720_246680
orange . 246860_247200
mine . 250870_251040
it's not yours . 251830_253160
doesn't have a diagonal a symmetry . 253280_254980
and neither does Ashley but . 255000_256690
okay . 257070_257260
so symmetry is one thing to think about . 257380_259260
but you have to think about how will this two by two syrup . 259279_262660
please do today . 262780_263580
how will this two by two . 264140_265210
look if it's arranged we have other two by twos like it . 265280_267990
and how will this two by two . 269940_271620
and Brian's two by two . 271660_272700
look when there are more of them around it . 272750_275500
what kinds of designs can you get by having more than one of
what . 284510_284780
will happen . 284800_285110
if I put another two by two exactly like Ashley it's right here . 285320_288600
what will happen . 289350_290070
if it's . 292020_292350
no no . 292820_293190
right . 293240_293380
the position it's in right now . 293460_294740
but ine is if I put another one right here . 295210_296830
don't turn it . 297050_297750
if you put it so . 300500_301790
if I put another one right here . 301860_302920
then what's gonna happen . 303070_303940
if it was a right way be . 304380_306290
what will you see that you don't see . 306830_308630
now <in the design> in the design . 308700_312110
what will you see if I make start making a quilt . 312300_314590
and I make a two by two like Ashley's and put another one here . 314640_317170
what what shape or two . 317550_318910
red . 319260_319430
two red . 320060_320550
so we'd see a big red square . 320790_322060
we don't see a big red square in this design yet . 322310_324020
do we what_if though I took Ashley's two by two design one like
and then I took her design . 328600_329900
and I turned it like this . 329920_331150
and put one next_to it right here next_to the red square . 331820_334420
I could get a strip of red and a strip of orange . 334680_337500
see . 338710_338830
do you see how I could take another two by two design . 338880_340780
and this part of it I could put next_to the red part and get a
and a strip of orange . 346050_346580
or if I use this part of the design I could make it go red big red
and then an orange stripe and a red stripe . 350200_351950
I could get stripes arranged there . 352120_353590
what_about with Sarah's design . 353750_355110
what_if I took her two by two right like this . 355510_357710
just like it is now . 358280_359140
and I put another one right there . 359470_360860
what will you see . 361390_362040
Big diamond . 362900_363260
a big green diamond . 364720_365390
but what_if I took one like this . 365620_368180
and then I turned it like that . 368790_370780
and put one of those next_to the one . 371530_373230
<we started with> we started with one just like this . 373280_376020
oops . 376630_376750
wait . 376860_377020
we started one with just like this . 377140_378420
would it if I put this edge of it next_to there . 378860_381700
what would . 382180_382460
happen . 382570_382880
no . 382900_382970
the green . 383340_383510
oh well you're right . 387260_387980
I could put take two of them like that . 388040_389660
and put them next_to each_other . 389820_391150
and get two blues next_to there making a blue square and a big
or I could get these two squares right there next_to this triangle
making . 401710_401900
I don't know some kind of like an arrow like design or . 402200_404540
whatever .
okay . 405770_405860
so what you have to think about before you choose a two by two is
now we can't put this one with this one . 412850_415380
but we can take nine of these or nine of these or nine of Brian's
he didn't have time to do his other three to see the diagonal line
he could plant his so that he had a diagonal line of red . 429310_432260
going . 432280_432510
each section . 432990_433550
maybe if he had Red going this way cross . 434250_436940
right . 437130_437430
he could arrange it so that he had a big red axe or cross with red
and in_between it would be all red orange and red &-um red orange
okay . 448110_448380
so what you have to think about is which two by two is gonna give
okay . 454420_454540
I'm gonna let you guys do some . 454700_455820
deciding one . 456000_456390
you're sitting on a microphone . 468300_469830
I like this one . 481840_482470
okay . 487950_488070
you like Sarah's attitude . 488660_490270
I like mine . 492720_493390
Tuesday <I like> I like . 493870_496540
okay . 498600_498780
now we can play . 498800_499380
so you have . 499860_500270
what I . 500320_500540
saw . 503600_503670
let's it this way . 505610_506440
this this is all between these two . 507540_513520
amazing . 517309_517510
you want this one right . 517620_518390
no want this . 518830_519340
yeah . 519470_519659
yeah . 519789_519919
yeah . 520130_520270
Alex you want this one . 520830_521669
right . 521860_522230
you you want this one right right . 522770_525230
Mason you want this one right right . 525910_527610
and I want this one right right . 528410_529950
so how did you select that two . 530580_531910
how did you rule . 532300_533070
that deal . 533120_533430
we voted nobody wanted this one . 533540_536740
nobody wanted that . 537480_538360
one one person wanted this one . 538930_541260
and three people wanted this one . 541420_542870
so we voted two people . 543560_544690
two people wanted this one two people wanted this one . 545380_547380
so we voted between these two . 547800_548780
Nathan Nathan <can you> can you . 548940_550120
share and now one person . 550390_550910
wondering . 551150_551470
yes . 553200_553310
Nathan Fair is wondering . 554850_556580
how why you like this design . 556760_558380
can you tell her again what &-uh what you said . 559070_561740
you can put . 562000_562340
it on mine earlier . 562360_563060
yeah . 563190_563250
you can put it . 563480_563980
I like yours too . 564480_565090
