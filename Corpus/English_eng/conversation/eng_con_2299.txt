I wonder if there is a xxx thing . 30_4738
things . 4738_7172
random . 7172_7793
yeah he kinda just has random: 7793_10433
i don't know how . 11630_12912
i don't either . 12912_14026
there're just some people that can do that . 14026_15717
i don't get it . 15717_17203
like there are some people who find out everything like 17203_19721
and just know everything 22693_24262
wait what do you mean ⌈ social things⌉ ? 25293_27112
⌊ like ⌋ 27112_28144
that's what i mean . 28849_29963
really ? 29963_30623
and I don't get that by Dan . 30623_32768
i don't know if it's they're told or they just figure it out . 32768_35740
it would have to be a mix right ? 35740_38425
i would assume . 38425_39623
you would have to be perceptive enough to see things and then- . 39623_43421
people would have to trust you enough to tell them . 43421_45279
⌈yeah . 45279_45983
⌊tell you about them . 45983_46643
but i don't see Tyler as one of those people . 46643_48129
no, I don' i feel like he doesn't know like social stuff . 48129_50980
just random information . 50980_53330
kind of, I think i don't know . 53330_56302
and i think i agree with that . 56302_59069
he seems not socially awkward . 59069_61215
cause he's not awkward . 61215_62330
i mean he's awkward but not . 62330_63444
in the social way . 63444_65302
he's just a bizarre person . 65302_66705
so . 66705_67531
he's just weird . 67531_68563
yeah . 68563_69489
which ⌈in my mind . 69315_70868
⌊in a good way . 70868_73014
makes it difficult for people to want to come to him . 73014_74128
mhmm . 74128_75037
and therefore makes me feel like he's not actually perceptive- . 75037_76729
(..) but maybe i'm wrong . 76729_80073
(...) so what you got a: spicy: tuna: and something else ? 80073_88412
california roll . 88412_89527
what is a california roll &=chews ? 89527_90930
(...) other than in my mouth right now . 90930_98732
um it's rice on the outside with sesame seeds . 98732_103356
the inside is umm . 103356_105131
fly fish row . 105131_106700
avocado-: . 106700_107814
cucumber-: and umm-: . 107814_109756
crab but it's fake crab . 109756_111364
the fish kind (..) . 111364_112933
it's +..? 112933_115245
imitation crab . 115245_118383
i mean i suppose it could be-: real crab but this isn't . 118383_122925
how do you know ? 122925_124904
i know what imitation crab looks like . 124904_127671
and i know what crab looks like . 127671_128703
that's a good reason . 128703_129734
and crab is a lot more expensive . 129734_130849
and they just wouldn't use it- . 130849_131963
okay ! 131963_132706
so really i could eat it if i wanted it . 132706_135307
that's kind of useful information . 135307_138074
mmm &=swallows it's fish . 138074_142987
right ! 142987_143563
I mean i eat fish on occasion . 143563_145338
so that's why i say if i wanted to eat it . 145338_150046
(...) umm (..) so yeah . 150046_159334
(...) my conversation with Max . 159334_167136
didn't escalate to anger or crying . 167136_169858
yay ! 169858_170934
what were you guys talking about ? 170934_172353
u-at the first thing we spoke about . 172096_174655
was umm . 174780_175615
the Matisyahu concert- . 175690_177140
ok .
umm . 177215_178601
very briefly and his . 178701_180195
umm leaving me to walk with Bri . 180270_182878
by myself- .
mhmm .
and how that . 182953_185313
like pissed me off amazingly so . 185388_186849
and he's like i'm sorry i read the situation wrong . 186503_189270
like it seemed to me like you two wanted to talk to each other .
so i was just gonna leave you alone . 192326_193895
i'm like yeah no that was not . 193895_195791
not the case at all . 196141_197732
but umm what's done is done . 197732_199961
and there's nothing to do about it . 199961_200992
and then-: . 200992_202933
we started talking about Hillel . 202933_204790
because Rachel talked to him last night . 204790_206648
i know . 206648_207270
and-: he . 207270_209954
thinks he'd do a really good job as president . 209954_211978
and so really wants it . 211978_213093
and he knows-: that being rush chair is . 213093_215526
a conflict of interest . 215526_216148
but he still really wants it . 216148_217346
(..) she told me he didn't seem-: 217346_220689
he doesn't . 222425_223950
did he say why ? 223950_225808
umm . 225808_227005
he doesn't . 227005_228120
like the concept of co-president . 228120_230516
unless . 230516_231835
the two parties-: . 231835_234518
umm . 234518_235467
lack . 235467_237408
a-: skill set . 237408_239515
that the other one possesses . 239515_241040
in-: high demand . 241040_242154
(..) umm . 242154_244095
and he doesn't believe that that's necessarily . 244914_247765
the balance between rachel and he . 247765_249251
umm . 249251_250198
so he'd . 250198_253625
be-: more willing to be . 253625_254739
vice president or . 254739_256160
president with . 256160_257507
vice versa . 257507_258000
(...) but he really doesn't seem to understand that he . 258000_271458
like . 271458_272861
that being rush chair is not . 272861_275379
just a problem . 275379_276948
it's-: a huge problem . 276948_278806
and that he really shouldn't hold both positions . 278806_281878
so . 281878_282892
can you . 282892_285576
kind of . 285576_288631
vocalize . 288631_290117
what the problem with him being rush chair is ? 290117_292263
because i know it's a problem and i . 292263_294038
know like in my head why but i . 294038_296061
can't necessarily put it out . 296061_297359
correctly and . 297359_300974
so, my feeling is that . 300974_301428
the issue with him being rush chair . 301428_303946
and-: trying to take an active role . 303946_307001
in-: Hillel . 307001_309109
comes a lot from looking at Dave Lewis . 309109_312907
Dave Lewis during the orien- the entirety of rush . 312907_316872
barely participated in anything Hillel . 316872_319678
like if we had an a Hillel event . 319678_322278
it could either be a rush event . 322278_323227
in which case he would come . 323227_324879
mhmm or he wouldn't come . 324879_326199
because there would be a rush event . 326199_327313
that night so he couldn't- . 327313_329066
like the balance was improper . 329066_331566
and i mean . 331566_333052
it's a question of . 333052_335903
time devotion in my mind . 335903_337760
and-: . 337760_339246
Max claims that he'll be present and be able to-: lead . 342340_344076
and not ha- and have it not be an issue . 344076_347707
so that's what i was like one of my main things . 347707_351711
when i talked to him and he thinks that he-: . 351711_353486
can manage his time and his energy . 353486_355798
but from what i saw this year: . 355798_358687
he can't . 358687_359884
right . 359884_360877
it is of my belief that he cannot . 360877_364138
he still believes he can . 364138_365086
he also believes that . 365086_366739
ummm if-: not this year then he will never do it . 366739_371197
because-: this-: year to next year are his two light semesters . 371197_374912
umm-: the two semesters in which he's not . 374912_378256
overloading in course work . 378256_380485
and he's not working-: . 380485_381766
and he's not doing research . 381766_382964
all three combined-: . 382964_384943
so he has time to devote to Hillel . 384943_387051
to which my respond is . 387051_389402
and A_E_Pi ! 389402_391054
and he doesn't-: really understand that the . 391054_392911
two are huge-: time commitments . 392911_395883
that he's-: . 395883_397203
eith- he's gonna shaft one . 397203_399061
and it will be Hillel . 399061_401540
and it will be Hillel- . 401540_402738
so i think what he told me his concern was was . 402738_409796
not knowing how to present himself . 409796_412397
if he was both at the same time . 412397_414793
like introducing himself to people ? 414793_416112
and be like hi . 416112_416855
cause he really shouldn't-: a-at least he knows he . 416855_421397
shouldn't be at Hillel and be like hey come to A_E_Pi tonight . 421397_424369
correct . 424369_425317
eventhough we can do that . 425317_425855
i think . 425855_426432
we can . 426432_426969
but that's because we're doing it socially . 426969_428622
and he's doing it with an agenda . 428622_430458
yeah . 430458_430934
umm but like . 430469_435010
when you introduce yourself to someone . 435010_437982
the question is how are you introducing yourself- . 437982_440583
are you introducing yourself just by name ? 440583_442358
are you introduc- introducing yourself name and then association ? 442645_446072
and he specifically said in when i was talking to him 446072_449211
like . 452759_454784
associated with Hillel . 454784_456103
is fine but being president was not . 456103_458127
okay, and i'm like well then . 458127_459363
i don't like . 459363_461471
you can't . 461471_461964
any other . 461964_462352
position that's fine but president . 462352_464072
that's the point . 464072_464815
right ! 464815_465308
(...) so . 465308_468158
i think he'd be okay at VP . 468158_471706
i think he'd be good at it . 471706_472821
i think he'd be fine . 472821_473360
he can stay there- . 473360_473936
but i agree i don't want him . 473936_478105
moving up . 478105_478394
Rachel doesn't want to . 478394_480334
cause a conflict- . 480334_483102
correct . 483102_484134
ok and i think that . 484134_485703
i don't think she'd be a bad president . 485703_489706
umm . 489706_490737
i don't . 490737_491686
think she would be the best . 491686_492800
i- i can see where Max would be better . 492800_496105
umm but . 496105_497796
i'm not convinced that he will actually . 497796_501800
perform to his capability . 501800_505310
and i understand that Rachel gets frustrated . 505310_508858
(..) and can-: burn out really quickly . 508858_513977
and that'll take a while for her to come back . 513977_515713
from that but umm . 515713_518063
(..) i think it's . 518063_522029
i think that's better . 522029_523143
than having devotions elsewhere . 523143_524751
maybe i'm wrong- . 524751_526403
(...) i think that if the board is like . 526403_536228
there enough . 536228_538169
that 538169_540398
but can we rely on them ? 544197_545933
that was the question that Max posed . 545933_547214
yeah, that was what I said and that was why I said . 547214_549981
how is he . 549981_551756
at Hillel . 551756_551877
you can't rely on having a strong board . 551877_552415
but +... 552415_554561
but then what are you relying on . 554561_558276
right are you relying on solely the president . 558276_560960
we can't do that . 560960_562325
we can't do that . 562325_563068
and Max himself says that he's not a programmer . 563068_565919
he gets things done . 565919_567609
when +... 567609_568724
other people come up with them . 568724_570005
yeah and he'll enable others to get their things done . 570005_574175
but he can't . 574175_575290
like he's not the brain . 575290_577269
behind the-: everything . 577269_579498
he's a powerhouse not a . 579498_581372
right . 581372_585321
(..) so (..) . 585321_588209
so you need the board . 588209_589241
and if . 589241_589696
he's not relying upon them . 589696_592092
then i'm a little afraid . 592092_593289
(...) so . 593289_598984
again . 598984_600841
i don't know where that leaves us . 600841_602699
and i-: don't know what's gonna happen . 602699_604063
(..) not to mention that he won't be there for elections . 604063_609015
which is going to make-: elections really really odd . 609015_610955
cause he's running for . 610955_612647
high up positions . 612647_613640
(...) if you want umm an avocado . 613640_628501
piece you're welcome to take one . 628501_630108
i might . 630108_631844
okay . 631844_632503
(..) so where does this leave +..? 632503_644597
(..) the elections ? 644597_648024
i have no earthly clue- ? 648024_649965
umm i'm still not convinced that we have-: 649965_653680
i talked with Dave Lewis doesn't want to do it . 656076_659957
okay . 659957_661172
like for sure . 661172_661732
cause it like i mean that's kind of what we assumed . 661732_663878
but got the feeling that nobody actually asked . 663878_666107
its true no one asked him . 666107_667843
i mean if he's up for master right ? 667843_671308
i don't know . 671308_673044
I mean no one's like de:finitely telling . 673044_676238
me what the nominations were . 676238_677874
unless i-: gues . 677874_679193
or-: . 679193_680019
a:sk an individual . 680019_681422
ike were you nominated for anything- . 681422_682991
yeah so i me- . 682991_685676
i don't understand . 685676_686169
they're being dumb . 686169_687162
i mean . 687162_688731
Joe told me but he's like . 688731_690339
i don't remember . 690339_690793
i honestly don't remember . 690793_692856
off the top of my head . 692856_693682
umm i feel . 693682_694342
like it's Scott Dan . 694342_701196
and +... 701196_701517
Dan Eisenberg ? 701517_701751
and Dave . 701751_702227
up for master . 702227_702682
i think . 702682_703259
Scott would be the best . 703259_703880
(...) Dave Lewis is already . 703880_709825
too bitter to take it . 709825_711887
and Dan Eisenberg . 711887_713084
would be would be her-horrible . 713084_715891
i mean it would just +... 715891_716634
i feel like so much would be missed . 716634_718491
if he were +... 718491_719400
yeah . 719400_720060
because he's not . 720060_720803
a persona . 720803_721463
i feel like . 721463_723199
do +//.
why has has &~Da he has . 723593_727943
been in a better mood . 728118_728824
Dave Lewis ?
yeah . 728899_730335
like markedly-: better . 730385_731996
or is this just because like .
i don't think . 732121_733399
i've he's . 733524_735115
stopped like not . 735215_736496
talking to me and i'm percieving it as like he's in a better . 736596_739327
i don't think he's actually been . 739552_740938
any better .
ok so +/.
i'm fairly certain that . 741038_743175
this is how he's been since freshman year . 743350_744833
too .
ok . 744958_747625
this is now i have an altered perception . 747725_749951
i don't think he'd be bad . 750076_755920
i'm afraid of his bitterness . 756020_759743
it's really it . 759818_760736
i think it depends on if he . 760811_763459
sees it as a . 763534_766142
(..) like . 766217_769461
(..) i have responsibility . 769561_773440
let me do my best . 773565_775347
ok .
'll i mean . 775422_778858
cause he was . 778933_781350
fine-: as-: . 781450_783521
member ?
yeah but . 783596_786660
i actually don't know why he was member . 786735_788350
because member's like the person you turn to . 788425_789919
if you have a problem . 789994_790496
i don't see people turning to Dave Lewis . 790571_792520
umm .
didn't he want master and not win it ? 792595_797184
i don't remember . 797259_798895
i feel like no one remembers . 798995_801867
and like people who do won't tell me . 801967_803461
no one'll be like yeah this is what happened . 803536_804961
because their not going to tell you . 805061_808304
who lost last year .
it's just not appropriate . 809480_813985
yeah .
umm see now i just want more sushi . 814060_820994
umm but .
no take it . 821119_826412
you like it so much have one . 826487_828341
i ate seven no . 828466_830596
more than that . 830696_831697
nine ten eleven . 831772_833759
umm so i don't know-: . 833834_843765
i don't know i don't see him as master . 843865_847564
like i i really do think he'll it'll be so self destructive . 847664_852598
i don't think it would necessarily be good for him . 852698_857348
or-: i feel like it . 857423_859344
c'go either way it could for him . 859469_860764
and good for the house or . 861039_861828
it could be really +/.
detrimental . 861903_863314
really bad for him . 863389_864779
and still ok for the house . 864854_867087
or it could just suck for everything . 867187_868144
so what i was saying is he was good at booth . 868219_870861
but i don't remember exactly what his . 870986_872768
didn't he like die during booth . 872843_874254
basically ?
oh he did . 874329_875336
but he did it really well . 875361_876483
like the booth was amazing . 876558_878079
but he destroyed himself . 878129_883748
(..) so . 883823_886886
he has that trend . 886961_889321
i don't think it's a good one so . 889396_890372
i don't wanna promote it . 890472_891500
although it's not like we-: get . 891625_894104
to vote . 894204_894772
yeah right .
right !
umm .
what are we gonna do on sunday ? 894847_898750
when-: like for hours and hours and hours . 898850_901267
i won't be here .
you won't . 901367_902649
be here-: i forgot . 902749_904686
i'm gonna be missing my first like legitimate . 904811_907162
girls out of the house forever . 907312_908723
elections .
it's okay . 908798_909658
but . 909708_911983
i'm sure we're not doing anything . 912058_913469
i'll be up . 913544_915146
so-: when you find out can . 915196_917822
you like give me a call ? 917897_918721
mhmm it's easy enough absolutely . 918746_920165
umm but e-board doesn't actually . 920315_925980
like get changed-: until . 926055_927069
later right .
until . 927169_928059
the spring .
so they're still e-board . 928860_932642
through . 932742_934621
winterbreak . 934721_936587
mhmm .
so-: why-: . 936662_939091
after November-: . 939141_940698
are they like free ? 940748_941896
cause is this like a transition period ? 942894_944496
so they at- they don't have as many responsibilities ? 944546_948004
or they have more because they have to teach the new e-board ? 948179_950069
umm i think they don't have as many . 950119_951736
because the new e-board is trying . 951811_953075
okay .
umm . 953175_956014
i th- i mean i think . 956064_957103
i'm fairly certain it's not like . 957178_958614
the day after elections . 958664_960100
is the new e-board . 960150_961215
umm because that would seem silly . 961265_964104
to me but i don't . 964154_965854
exactly remember the transition . 965929_968224
process .
right . 968324_969447
umm +...
yeah pretty much . 969522_976794
i'm sure it's after major board elections . 976869_978735
because what'll you know . 978810_982029
like you can't hold certain . 982154_983556
positions-: and then-: what if they . 983656_986634
do because you're on major like . 986734_988524
board position . 988674_990168
(...) i don't know makes sense . 990243_995204
so i'll be out like . 995279_996773
cause on sunday nights . 996848_998176
i'm out all night so . 998251_999515
i'll just i'll text you . 999615_1001810
yeah i wanna know .
i'll text you . 1001860_1003281
the info . 1003331_1004145
does your or email . 1004195_1006036
you'll have your phone .
will do . 1006136_1009033
umm i . 1009108_1012773
i feel like none of them are really good choices . 1012823_1015887
like Scott's really like . 1015962_1017495
he's like a fun guy . 1017570_1019352
and like really great but . 1019427_1020692
i feel like he's not like a leader . 1020792_1023836
he did i really good job with greek sing . 1023886_1026206
did he ? 1026281_1027262
yeah .
uh-huh . 1027312_1027876
umm organized meetings . 1027951_1030401
got everyone together . 1030451_1032067
he's really organizational . 1032142_1033265
which is i think very good for a President . 1033340_1035819
like i'm not really sure what JB does-: . 1035819_1038048
per se-: . 1038048_1038996
umm +... 1038996_1040936
like i said JB is a really o-like interesting choice and i . 1040936_1043993
wish i was here last year-: . 1043993_1044857
so much to like see . 1044857_1046881
all of the stuff that went . 1046648_1047959
on and i feel like i'd have . 1048034_1049800
xxx so much better . 1049975_1050651
he .
see who people were before . 1050801_1053698
(..) umm (..) i wish i remembered the elections last year . 1053773_1062903
but he-: i think was the better . 1062978_1064076
choice .
i think it was him and Dave Lewis . 1064176_1066164
i'm pretty sure i've heard that- . 1066239_1067469
i would buy it . 1067519_1070897
like maybe someone else but i-i- . 1070947_1074299
i don't think that he's bad . 1074374_1075823
it's really interesting . 1075898_1076938
because he's not Robbie . 1077013_1078424
not at all . 1079613_1080185
and even now-: i . 1080235_1083254
see how he would . 1083329_1084798
's master of the +... 1084898_1086317
but . 1086467_1089101
i think it was interesting because . 1089151_1091081
after-: Robbie-: . 1091131_1092567
the house basically swore not to have another sophomore-: . 1092617_1095789
master and then they elected JB . 1095839_1098844
which i thought was really-: interesting . 1098894_1102476
why did they not want another fre- ? 1102526_1104380
because-: of inexperience . 1104505_1105891
and it's just being young and-: . 1105991_1106992
stepping into the role . 1107067_1108600
umm like Robbie-: . 1108675_1112152
advised against it . 1112202_1114281
and JB was like well who else . 1114331_1115742
is gonna do it . 1115817_1116510
right ?
so he wanted it but . 1116560_1118764
also +... 1118889_1119854
i think that because of the way . 1119904_1123915
elections work . 1123990_1124972
both at Hillel and . 1125022_1126671
at A_E_Pi cause . 1126796_1127376
they kinda work the same way- . 1127501_1128349
i think period of time wise . 1128449_1131430
it's a really difficult place, because you can't have . 1134681_1136777
seniors in positions which . 1136827_1140071
are sort of people who really have had . 1140171_1141962
well you you can't have yeah current . 1142112_1143731
seniors cause they'll be gone . 1143781_1145777
umm so that gets rid of like that whole . 1145827_1148641
year of . 1148716_1150114
people who've had the most experience . 1150164_1151517
and you can't have freshmen . 1151567_1154033
because they . 1154083_1155353
just don't know anything . 1155403_1156526
yeah not for A_E_Pi . 1156601_1158220
you like . 1158270_1159953
we can for Hillel . 1160028_1161009
because we need to . 1161059_1162784
but yeah . 1162834_1164436
so you're left with . 1164486_1166006
sophomores . 1166056_1167325
and juniors- . 1167375_1168318
and +...
i mean you can get . 1168368_1172405
a senior who's running . 1172455_1175005
now like who's a junior now . 1175055_1177828
and so will be a senior . 1177878_1179585
in the spring . 1179635_1180963
or the following fall . 1181038_1182353
yeah like Joe .
like Joe . 1182403_1184126
which i think is very good . 1184176_1185818
i think yeah .
like i think you need more of those . 1185868_1187792
but how many people would . 1187892_1190226
by that and plus you have to have . 1190326_1192885
some experience . 1193010_1193966
you really should do it like . 1194041_1195222
for more than one year . 1195322_1196758
and it's just a weird like . 1196808_1199501
thinking of . 1199576_1201108
like sophomores being on e-board . 1201183_1202702
is like wow that's really young . 1202752_1204271
and next year it'll be the same thing as . 1204321_1205650
the same like age wise . 1205725_1207419
do you know-: . 1207544_1209009
umm who was nominated for leiutenant master ? 1209084_1211760
yes Brandon . 1211835_1213437
i know Brandon and that's it . 1213487_1214840
Big J . 1214890_1215955
okay . 1216005_1217069
(..) there might have been a third but i think . 1217119_1221009
that's it . 1221084_1222162
because like i'm also trying to pair . 1222237_1224392
like people for master . 1224467_1226424
i think that Brandon will get it . 1226574_1228753
i think he will too . 1228803_1230361
but i feel like Big J really should be on e-board . 1230411_1232301
i think he'd be good on it . 1232351_1233499
but he might drop down .
i don't know . 1233549_1236166
him as a good sentinel . 1236316_1237389
okay . 1237514_1239609
see i can see him more as . 1239659_1241872
member .
I could see that . 1241972_1244728
but i don't know if he would run against Henry i think he'd be
at it than Henry . 1249153_1250822
cause i feel like people go to Big J for . 1250972_1253059
things and not as much .
and not . 1253134_1254901
as much Henry .
even though i think Henry's really good . 1254976_1257309
probably should be on e-board . 1257409_1258541
but <i just> i think that to some extent certain . 1258691_1261504
people choose what they want and then . 1261579_1263182
other people just fill in the spots . 1263232_1264957
correct .
which doesn't always work well . 1265007_1267845
it doesn't-: most of the time . 1267895_1269536
but-: if you need a-: . 1269586_1271848
body of people .
yeah . 1271898_1273681
umm so my deal with Henry . 1273756_1276611
is that while he's a really great person . 1276661_1278703
i feel like i don't trust a lot of his decisions . 1278753_1281425
like-: Alex ? 1281475_1284026
umm and therefore . 1284076_1287535
like i wouldn't go talk to him . 1287585_1289227
(..) about issues of that nature . 1289277_1293768
(...) i just (..) . 1293818_1301298
i don't know i mean . 1301348_1302396
(..) he and Zach like kinda confuse me a little bit as . 1302446_1309008
regards their place in the house . 1309133_1310469
(..) like in the grand scheme of .
Zach doesn't . 1310619_1314631
confuse me so much wait . 1314706_1315926
which Zach . 1316026_1317366
Zach . 1317391_1318802
he doesn't confuse me so much . 1318877_1320767
i mean i just (..) i didn't think . 1320817_1325982
of them as like . 1326057_1327551
really-: like . 1327626_1328941
(..) kind of up there people . 1328991_1333207
well i guess as far as like . 1333282_1334777
power positions in the house . 1334852_1336363
that's true i don't . 1336438_1337871
i i mean i . 1337946_1339043
don't see them as power positions . 1339143_1340475
but i-: see them . 1340525_1341694
as-: . 1341744_1342809
umm people who can get the job done . 1342859_1345948
like look at Zach with buggy . 1345998_1348836
yeah .
although that'll be fun when he . 1348886_1352815
cause Zach doing buggy around Carnival . 1352890_1355307
and e-board will . 1355407_1356530
i'm sure be loads of fun . 1356605_1358116
but umm-: . 1358191_1359899
i think he'll be a good exchequer . 1359949_1361756
he's not &~ru opposed right ? 1361806_1364357
he's unopposed . 1364407_1365760
i mean unless someone drops down . 1365810_1366957
which-: Dan might . 1367007_1368376
Dan might . 1368426_1369395
i'm not exactly sure he wants it though . 1369420_1371211
i don't know him at al . 1371261_1374471
i mean he's been around . 1374521_1376609
a little more i feel . 1376684_1377789
like sitting around . 1377864_1379251
on the downstairs more +...
i don't know . 1379351_1382248
as oppose to earlier in the +... 1382323_1384014
i want to invite Beth out one day . 1384114_1390793
just be like i wanna .
