this is the Justice Harry <A> Blackmun Supreme Court Oral
it's being filmed on October <twenty-first> , <nineteen
I'm a professor at Yale Law School , and I'm a former law clerk to
<mister> Justice , when we concluded last time , we had
the subjects today are your years at Harvard Law School and then
I should start by asking when did you decide to go to law school ?
well , going to law school I guess was always something that was in
my father had always wanted to go to law school and never realized
so he wanted me to go to law school and for me the choice was
I just kind of drifted along and went to law school .
as a college student , did you visit any Harvard Law School classes
no .
I could see the law school students walking around the yard , some
when you applied to law school , did you apply anywhere other than
no .
and do you remember anything about the application process ?
no , very little , I didn't , there didn't seem to be any
I had acceptable grades as an undergraduate , and there didn't seem
on the first day of law school , did they give a speech about look
well that's the old Bull Warren story , Professor Bull Warren who
my first class was with Calvert Magruder , on torts , and he later
as I recall , he told that story giving full credit to Professor
it was a great way to start law school when you realized that one
frighten them at the start and keep them frightened I guess was the
and were you frightened ?
not any more than anybody else , +/.
0 &=laughter .
wondering whether you could handle the legal subjects .
and who were your first set of professors , do you remember ?
yes , pretty well .
as I just mentioned , Magruder was the first class .
and in that year Williston in contracts , Morgan , a new professor
he had only one question to ask .
he'd say , +"/.
+" <mister> Brown , will you state such and such a case .
he did and then Sayre would say , “Is that decision sound” ?
that was the way he started every Socratic dialogue , so called , I
do you remember the first time you were called out in class ?
no .
were there all men at the time , or were there any women ?
if there were women , there were very few , and I think there were
who was the dean of the law school at that time ?
we had a couple of deans as I remember , more or less in an acting
Morgan was there for a while , Landis took over and Griswold had
right , you mean Edmund Morgan and Erwin Griswold .
what are your impressions of some of these people , if I could just
you mentioned James Landis , what was your feeling about him ?
well , he was on his way up , of course , and was rather an
very nervous , high strung individual who had a Phi Beta Kappa key
he loved to twirl it as he came in and enunciated the philosophy of
but most of the classes in that course were taught by Williston
it was hard for Landis , I think , to step in on occasion and be
but Williston , of course , was a great name in contracts at the
he never referred to an offerer or an offeree , it was always Oscar
I think we thrived in Williston's classes .
what was Magruder like ?
magruder was a little more cold .
impressive .
good teacher .
I think knew his subject I took torts from him .
later he got into the political arena and eventually ended up on
and Morgan , what was your impression of him ?
+, Eddie Morgan .
I , of course , was particularly interested in him because he had
he had practiced at Duluth at one time .
his course on evidence was something to behold .
it was not easy , there was no humor in Professor Morgan , but in
but for me it was a difficult subject .
I found evidence difficult .
another one , of course , I should mention is Austin Scott because
Scotty was very popular and taught trusts .
we got to know him as well as anybody .
can you tell us about that moot court experience , it was probably
in those days , I have no reason to know whether it's changed there
you start off as a pair , one arguing against the other , and then
eight from each class were in the so-called Law Club which was
then we would engage in inter-club competition which would last
it was an elimination tournament and we were lucky enough to win
did you argue ?
not in the final round .
there were only eight of us .
the two oralists in that round were Frank Sloss , who was a
the rest of us wrote the brief and formed the cheering section .
do you remember what the case was about or who the judges were ?
I guess I better give you a negative answer on both of those .
I have those old briefs at hand but I don't remember precisely who
who were your best friends in law school ?
well , it turned out members of that group of eight .
there wasn't much socializing in Harvard Law in those days , and I
I would say my best friend was Russell <C> Jewell .
he had practiced a while in New York City , lived in Scarsdale ,
he was a close friend , I had the highest respect for him .
after law school , he went on to Donovan Leisure in New York and
another one , of course , was Tom Eliot whom we all liked and
where were you living during this period ?
the first year in Perkins Hall , which is fairly near the law
it really was a graduate school dormitory , and my roommate , whom
we lived there for one year and then rather an amazing thing
this was the first of the Harvard houses .
professor Julian Coolidge , who had been appointed master of that
my then roommate came down , he was a representative of the
I don't know whether it worked out all right , but it enabled me to
of course , my friends from the Scott Club at law school thought I
but it was a happy time , I enjoyed being there .
now you said that you were continuing to work your way through .
was that unusual or were significant numbers of students working ?
there weren't too many .
it was just the circumstance that I had to face , and by the time I
one was running the coaching launch for the Harvard freshmen crew
another one , which paid fairly well , was correcting math papers
did you do that when you were in law school ?
yes .
those two were the main things that got me though , as long as I
I had passable grades , all right , but so I gave up those jobs
how many hours a week would you say you worked ?
I was on the river , usually , or down near the boathouse , from
how did you like your studies , did you find them enjoyable or
I liked the math studies very much , but I reached the point where
I felt I had reached the limit of my intellect to absorb any
I may have told you the other day that I wrote a thesis , an honors
I took it out the other day and couldn't understand the first two
it was a little bit beyond me .
did you ever go to medical school classes to see what they looked
no .
and I suppose the problem was the medical school was downtown
how did you feel about law school classes .
were they enjoyable , the reading enjoyable or did you find it hard
they were certainly very different from the undergraduate classes
they were large classes .
one had a seat assigned .
as I remember , we sat in half-circular rows .
each professor was largely didactic in his teaching , in those days
we didn't have very many small classes .
I sensed immediately when I got up there a different kind of
I think it was due to a couple of things .
one was the fact that the students came from all over .
my senior year at Harvard College , we'd all been around for three
the second distinction I noticed , and I noticed it right away ,
we were now in a professional school and studying the basic art of
it was not the old college days anymore .
how did you become known as “Black Horse Harry” ?
I had a lot of nicknames .
professor Leach one time couldn't read his chart very well +/.
+, you mean Barton Leach +/.
+, and he came to my name and called me “Blackhouse” .
and , of course , the obvious next step for my good friends , so
+, one person we haven't discussed is Felix Frankfurter .
did you take any classes with him ?
was he a big presence in the school ?
he was a big presence in the school , and I did take his course on
Felix would take we'd call it the case-a-month club , and he'd
I think we wondered at the time whether this was worthwhile .
I sensed a feeling of antagonism toward Professor Frankfurter at
the other was , a feeling , probably not rightly adopted , that he
he'd get about ten or twenty and put them up in the front row and
as I got into practice and particularly on the bench , my
I never find the Frankfurter opinion that's close to the mark on
may not always agree with it , often do not , but all the substance
in retrospect , I have to feel that Felix was one of the great
did you have any personal interaction with him ?
a little .
he never called me by my first name , he never did , he always
we used to have Scott Club dinners , once in a while and he was a
we could get him going into some things that he regretted the next
did you stay in touch with him at all when you went on to practice
a little .
I was presumptuous enough to write him now and then about cases
he always answered , politely , with deference , and I enjoyed that
yes , I kept more in touch with him than with some of the others .
from whom did you study Constitutional Law ?
Thomas Reed Powell , who was as dogmatic as anybody could be and it
I , of course , have my notebooks in my store room here .
someday I'll look at them , see what they look like .
it was not my favorite class .
maybe my favorite class was one with Barton Leach , who taught
he got himself in difficulty one time with the faculty , but I
did you take a course in Income Tax ?
no , I did not .
everybody avoided it in those days .
they didn't think it was very important , and they thought it'd be
the first of which was untrue , the second of which was probably
then , of course , a few years later in practice I found myself
it was a day of revelation .
I wished , at that point I had taken tax law .
so that was not a field that you were leaning toward in law school
no , not at all .
during this period , this was in the Depression and coming up on
how did these events affect your life ?
well , it certainly was the Depression all right , and it affected
on the other hand , students from rich families were well off and
I may have said in the earlier interview , I can well remember
+" I don't have any money , I'm broke , it just can't hurt me at
and congratulated myself on how lucky I was , but again , how wrong
and did you have much interest in national politics at the time ?
I know you met Herbert Hoover during those years , +/.
I was always interested in politics .
I was never active in them , but I was always interested in how
I just happen to have met Mister Hoover shortly after he
+, was he still reasonably popular then ?
oh , yes indeed .
this was in <twenty-nine> , before the crash .
he was a great man in many respects .
he had a pretty bad deal being president when the Depression hit us
what would you do during the summers in between your law school
I thought for a while of staying in the Boston area and working ,
in one of those early trips , I was still an undergraduate , I got
I was able to get it every summer .
they'd use me as a substitute .
they had to give vacations to the regular drivers , so I would take
so in those days , law students had no prospect of working for a
not at all .
I can't remember a single one who worked for a law firm during the
who were some of the well-known people in your law school class or
our class was not particularly distinguished in that way .
telford Taylor was a member .
they all did very well in the practice of law , but there was no
you mentioned in an earlier session when you first saw Justice
did you see or meet any other famous judges ?
no , not then .
of course , there was always a lot of talk at Harvard about the
do you remember what the case was about ?
no .
it had something to do with a negative approach in certain types of
we had a new approach to it .
he didn't think much of it .
were you the oralist ?
yes .
and was he actually mean to you ?
no , no , he was just firm .
he didn't say , +"/.
+" you Mid-Westerner , get out of our bailiwick here in New York .
but I knew when he made up his mind .
did you have any recollections of famous sporting events during
did you have any contact with them or go to see any of the games at
yes , I got over to Fenway once in a while if I had money to get in
but there was one time I remember .
after our final Scott Club argument we had won , we decided to go
the eight of us went .
the Yankees were in town .
there couldn't have been <nine hundred> people in the
it was a great day .
were you discouraged that you weren't on the law review ?
no , I accepted the fact that my grades weren't good enough , they
I rationalized it by saying I'm working my way through , which may
I think that was worth maybe three to five points .
were you able to have much of a social life apart from your work ?
no , not very much but I had some .
I think one had to get out a little bit .
when you came back in <nineteen ninety-four> and got an
did it somehow bring you full circle from these years at Harvard ?
well , you've described it well when you use that phrase , because
yes I did have a lot of memories .
being there at Harvard Yard again brought many things back , as
but this one in particular because it was commencement , a
I think some twenty-plus thousand people were there at commencement
did your parents come to your commencement ?
yes , they did .
did you think about how they would have reacted to seeing you get
oh , well , I think they would have been pleased maybe , my mother
long time ago .
during this period , did you have any serious thoughts about
or were you fairly certain that you would continue as a lawyer ?
yes , I think as time went on the thoughts about medicine dimmed ,
as we're coming to the end now of your third year of law school and
well , there weren't any jobs , of course , freely available .
the big firms weren't hiring ten or fifteen new associates to try
I was pretty well-reconciled to the fact that I had to go to a
then to my amazement , as I recall , I had kind of a promise of a
how did you meet this person ?
oh , went around , I was going into the Boston firms , seeking
but then as I said before , my father's health was not good , and I
have you ever thought about how your career would have evolved if
I've often wondered about it .
what do you think would have happened ?
I haven't the least idea .
probably would've ended up in a small town in Massachusetts
one other question I should ask before I move on , do you remember
I don't remember what it was in law school but the first year as an
that was just tuition .
and what were you making an hour at your jobs ?
the launch-driving job , which was a good one , three dollars a day
let me ask one final question about constitutional law , the
at the time it was a very different subject .
it was really more about the commerce clause than about individual
did you have a sense of it as a field ?
did you have a sense of your own philosophy of constitutional law
no , not really , you're entirely right .
I think Thomas Reed Powell taught the commerce clause .
individual rights , I have very little recollection of his ever
I have to dig my notes out and see if I'm wrong in that
could you tell us about Judge Sanborn , his family , his background
john <B> Sanborn , of course , is a person whom I revere in
the Sanborn came out of New Hampshire and I think in Southern New
he was a person of substance and repute in the <Saint> Paul
the family had moved west .
his father was the Colonel of the Fourth Minnesota in the War
his cousin , also with the Sanborn name , was a lawyer practicing
so they were an established family .
he was appointed to the federal district bench in <nineteen
how old was he at the time ?
oh , I'm guessing , maybe late forties .
and had he been in private practice before he went on the state
yes .
and had been somewhat politically active , not running for elected
he was active there and had a lot of friends .
he had a great judicial reaction to things .
he and <Mrs> Sanborn had no children so that the name
when we were looking around the walls of your chambers in the first
what was the relationship between Walter and +/.
they were first cousins strangely enough , but a generation removed
Walter Sanborn was one of the three original judges of the <eighth>
and I think John <B> , his cousin , thought he was a great
Walter Sanborn was fairly liberal , strangely enough , for the
but when John Sanborn died the chief judge of the <eighth>
+, do you know if Walter played any role in John's appointment ?
I do not know that John , I think , was the last , well that would
how that happened I don't know .
was it common at the time for members of your law school class to
no , there were not over three or four that did .
there usually was one for Learned Hand and another for Gus .
they were prized positions to obtain if one could get them .
and nearly always they were dictated by Felix who knew the Hands
that's why I looked around .
two of the lawyers on the Minnesota Harvard Club Committee that
so I went to see him .
were there other Minnesota graduates in your Harvard Law School
no , I wasn't the only one but there weren't many .
there was Henry Cutler of <Saint> Paul , John De Laittre of
and when you first went to see John Sanborn , how did he treat you
well , he was , of course , polite but said he could get along
so I pestered him .
I went back a couple of times .
I think by that time he'd been far enough into being a circuit
did you say anything in particular that you think swung him over ?
I don't think so .
I know I was paid &=dollar <one fifty point oh oh>
this was Depression times .
of course , my hundred and fifty went down to about a hundred and
the judge thought this was hilarious because he couldn't be touched
but he was very decent about it and was always very nice to me .
did you take the bar examination before you went to work for him ?
yes , yes , I did .
I arrived in Minnesota on a Saturday and took the bar on a Monday .
again I had to rationalize a little because over the weekend I
what would you have done had you not gotten the position with Judge
would you have signed on with a firm in Minneapolis ?
there weren't any jobs .
I think I would have looked around Minnesota and found a good
where did Judge Sanborn keep his chambers ?
in those days , the old federal post office up there on Rice Park ,
there was a post office on the ground floor but then there was a
room <three oh four> , I'll never forget it .
he was the only Circuit Judge in the courthouse ?
yes , he was .
the old chambers for Walter <H> Sanborn were up on the
they weren't occupied at all until I used them when I went on the
they assigned them to me .
can you talk about the other judges on the Court of Appeals at the
yes , as I remember , and I hope I'm right in this , the chief
kind of a cold-natured , but , I think , good judge .
he was a son of a Missouri senator .
and a judge named Arba Van Valkenburgh of +/.
Kansas City as well .
+, Kansas City also , who retired about that time .
William <S> Kenyon of Iowa .
kenyon was a large , white-haired fellow who had been a United
archibald <K> Gardner of Huron , South Dakota , whose
then I think , came John <B> Sanborn +/.
Wilbur <F> Booth was also of that period .
+, Wilbur <F> Booth is the Minnesotan whom John Sanborn
good judge , +/.
now did these all have law clerks as well ?
+, the active ones did .
booth didn't .
the others had a single law clerk , yes all of them .
how did Judge Sanborn use your services as a law clerk ?
this was his first experience having a law clerk .
you must have had to set up some protocols or procedures .
initially he wrote his own opinions on yellow legal pad , I can see
he didn't know how to use me , and I didn't know how to act , but I
we worked pretty well together .
in those days , we didn't travel with the judge .
the government was strapped for money , and there was a promise
I tried to help him get prepared , and he'd go down , and we got
what was the caseload at the time ?
we thought it was heavy , as judges always do .
I can't give you figures about it , but the calendars were full and
the statute said that the <eighth> Circuit should also sit
and did you have relationships with the other <eighth>
did you have a chance to meet them ?
yes , I got to meet all of them and enjoyed that relationship .
a couple of times I was loaned by Sanborn to one of the others when
particularly <A_K> Gardner I came to know well .
what do you recall about the sittings that you attended in <Saint>
of course they were .
we usually ran two panels , and it was a big deal whether we sat in
I think the clerks all felt it was , matter of dignity if one sat
usually we sat on the side where a jury normally would be .
that is , we clerks did .
it was a lot of fun .
do you remember any cases from your term when you started with
starting in <thirty-two> and going all through
the one that comes , to mind right away is the Standard Oil case .
the Standard Oil antitrust case originated in the <eighth>
standard of New Jersey came in with a petition to modify the decree
oh , Esso , Esso , yes .
did you know much about the <eighth> Circuit before you
no , not a great deal .
you once said that it's one of the very few North-South circuits .
what do you mean by that ?
well , originally , that is , up until <nineteen twenty-nine>
it covered more than a third of the nation's geographical land , so
I think it was important and well-known among the circuits ,
then it was broken up and the <tenth> was carved out of it
I can remember some of those early <tenth> Circuit judges
who are the ones who stick in your memory ?
judge Lewis primarily .
but they'd been members of the <eighth> Circuit and were
did you actually meet them ?
yes , sure .
how did they happen to come down to Minneapolis ?
they went to <Saint> Louis , I suppose for judicial
I can't answer your question specifically as to how did they happen
what do you think you learned from Judge Sanborn about being a
well he was as non-political a person as I've ever known .
I think he tried to instill in me a desire to be primarily just a
he called the shots as he saw them .
worked hard at it , liked it and was liked , I think , by the bar
he was particularly nice to me .
I don't know whether it was because he was childless or what .
he had a place on the <Saint> Croix river , a very nice
he and <Mrs> Sanborn would let me go weekends up there by
he liked the out of doors , he was a great canoeist and got me
did you ever go canoeing with him ?
not with him , no , but with others .
there's a story that's recounted in the history of the <eighth>
do you remember this case ?
oh , well vaguely , yes , I guess .
I was concerned about it , and his reaction was that the federal
but my , how the law has changed since then .
do you remember thinking at the time that that was wrong or
well , I wanted to change it but I was wet behind the ears and
but there was a very divisive attitude between the federal and
the federal courts didn't want to interfere in what was basically a
did you ever disagree with Judge Sanborn ?
oh , not very vitally ; he was too smart for me , and he usually
we argued things out here and there .
I tried to be a devil's advocate , didn't get very far .
we're going to break for the next tape .
maybe I'll ask you when we come back to talk a little bit abou
