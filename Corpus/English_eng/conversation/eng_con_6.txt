on a dark and gloomy night around ten o'clock at night, a man was
he was standing there getting ready to light <a cigarette no>
a policeman suddenly came walking by .
and asked the man what was he doing standing there .
he told the policeman he was waiting on a friend named Jimmy_Wells .
they had promised each other over twenty years ago to meet back at
he waited .
and it was past ten o'clock .
and the policeman had told him +"/.
+" well it's after ten o'clock .
+" do you think your friend is going to show up ?
so the guy, O'Henry, had said that +"/.
+" well, I'll give him an extra half an hour at the most .
+" and see what will happen then .
in the meantime, he noticed this figure across the street .
it was a tall slender man dressed in a long coat .
and he came across the street slowly .
O'Henry looked .
and looked .
and all_of_a_sudden he said +"/.
+" Jimmy_Wells, is that you ?
the guy was saying +"/.
+" well well well it's been a long time .
+" you haven't changed that much .
and O'Henry had said +"/.
+" well, you've changed .
+" your nose has changed .
you don't go from a big nose to a pug nose .
so then all_of_a_sudden, O'Henry had said +"/.
+" wait a minute .
+" you're not Jimmy_Wells .
+" I remember Jimmy_Wells very well .
+" and you're not him .
so the guy said +"/.
+" well you're right .
he had passed him a note .
and he had said for the past few minutes you had been under arrest .
and he gave him the note .
and he had read the note .
and <it said> it was a note from Jimmy_Wells, that said he had
some trouble he had gotten into in Chicago .
and he was wanted .
and the policeman had placed him under arrest .
but Jimmy didn't know it .
and the guy had <told him> said +"/.
+" well, your friend Jimmy_Wells is standing around the corner .
and the note was saying that when he read in the paper you were
he had to get somebody else to turn him in .
so that's what he did .
I guess he hired the tall slim man in the long coat to deliver the
and that was the end .
well, when I was working about twenty years ago, I decided to leave
and started to take care of children .
that's when I went into childcare .
I had several kids at one time .
but one was particularly special .
her name was Alexia .
she was a darling of a child .
sweet .
but she could get in to some kind of trouble around the house .
I had to watch her day in and day out .
don't touch this, baby .
don't do that, baby .
she was a doozy .
oh, and then her sister .
I had her sister along with her .
and she was the jealous one .
you couldn't give Alexia if you couldn't give Allyah .
when you tell Allyah she couldn't have it, she pitched a fight .
oh, she wanted to scream and holler .
she couldn't get her way .
then I remember the time when I was keeping AJ .
he was a little teeny little fat something little butterball .
and everybody was so crazy about him .
he was just so sweet .
and he loved to eat .
anything you cooked he ate .
and he was particularly crazy about graham crackers .
I couldn't keep enough graham crackers in the house for him .
he just loved them .
and then Jessie .
that was the crybaby of the bunch .
he cried .
and he cried .
and he cried .
I did everything in my power trying to calm him .
I gave him toys .
I played with him .
I took the kids to the playground .
I let them play on the playground .
and he just cried and cried .
I think he more or less missed his mommy during the day .
but I don't think he understood that she had to work .
but after a couple of weeks, he began to stop all the crying .
and he became attached to me .
and when his mother came to get him, he didn't really want to go
he had gotten that attached to me .
and all of the kids that I had taken care of were crazy about me .
they used to call me Mama_Mag for some reason .
I could never understand that .
but that's what they all used to call me and all .
and then when my husband had took sick with the stroke I had to
but I didn't have any other choice .
but to give up the daycare to take care of him .
but I see the children from time to time .
they've all got a little older now .
but hopefully I'll get to do daycare again .
soon as my husband gets better .
so that's more or less the things that I had liked to do with the
