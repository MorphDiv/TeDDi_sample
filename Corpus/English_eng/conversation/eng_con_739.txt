Right Share the total of fives . 2103323_2105663
Yeah I done yeah I done . 2107213_2108773
Er . 2108773_2108843
0 .
Five five five is fifteen . 2108843_2110383
Five add five add five . 2110383_2111883
Erm is fifteen . 2111883_2112403
and then erm . 2112403_2112753

Is that right Four . 2167163_2170413
Four is twenty So it 's four so . 2171103_2174943
Four times five is . 2175903_2177363
Twenty Four times five equal twenty Er two times six equals twelve
Those two add So it 's like one two one two and one there and but
Is twenty one Yeah Seven add seven add seven is twenty one . 2231153_2236563
One . 2236563_2236753
And three times seven . 2236893_2238633
Right . 2238633_2238763
is twenty one and do it that way five and fives Okay Two addition
Hang on . 2259053_2259343
Two ad yeah but you 've got right two multiple and two addition
Not equations You told us this . 2262703_2264923
But i thi like these these are equations So two addition equations
Yeah Yeah add three . 2284383_2284843
Three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is
Yeah . 2290023_2290163
me . 2290163_2290233
Yes I do Right Two multiplication . 2290273_2292053
Yeah . 2293003_2293153
and two addition . 2293443_2294473
Two addition Right . 2294473_2295833
So you like you . 2296703_2297263
Yes that 's right . 2297753_2298633
Then it 's like erm . 2298633_2299703
One . 2299703_2299793
seven times three and three times seven . 2299903_2302303
And three times seven That 's right . 2302303_2304613
And you do the same there . 2304613_2305373
Same on the adds . 2305373_2306263
And then this we do like . 2306263_2308793
Right she wants currency in two divisions in each right So it 's
That multiplication is a . 2316313_2317133
yeah well divisions okay so it 's twenty one shared by say if that
Oh I know what I 've got . 2327843_2330163
Six times three is eighteen or three times six is eighteen . 2330163_2334753
I know what I 've done I 've put the I thought it was er okay Six .
And division is shared by So you got to do eighteen shared by six
Have you got . 2351973_2352353
shared by three is six . 2352353_2354343
So like you go one two three four five six six times you swap . 2354593_2359593
Three . 2359593_2359743
six times three . 2359743_2360623
times three is eighteen . 2360623_2361363
is three times six . 2361363_2362263
Six Yeah and and you got . 2362263_2364253
Six times three and three times six . 2364253_2365113
A and division is eighteen shared by three is six and eighteen
I can not read . 2384883_2385443
Three sixes are eighteen You got it . 2388643_2393243
And you do the same there Hang on I have n't finished thirty three
0 .
one yet That 's what I do n't get Why do multiplication equation
It 's fours int it It 's fours . 2417963_2420483
No two four six eight ten twelve . 2420533_2422343
Yeah It . 2423383_2423583
That 's twos . 2423763_2424093
No but it 's going to fours look It 's going to fours . 2424893_2427033
Alright . 2428913_2429253
Going into fours . 2431033_2431573
What would I put . 2431573_2432353
Er one four is four two fours are eight and thre three fours is
Yeah and it 's on that one You do it like that do you . 2448983_2458483
Yeah cos it 's being shared by . 2458483_2459553
Oh . 2461913_2462103
So it 's I would say that is er nine times four equals thirty six
four . 2483093_2483273
No Sixty three divided by nine is six Write six through it Ten six
No it 's ten sixes . 2492093_2493343
No no wait a minute Nines What should nine times ten Emma . 2495153_2499743
One nine is nine two nines are eighteen three nines are . 2499743_2506993
Twenty seven Four nines are thirty six five nines are forty five
Oh thank you . 2525883_2526253
Right Yeah seven nines are sixty three . 2537623_2539443
Hang on a minute Six nines are . 2539443_2544603
seven nines are sixty three . 2544603_2545573
Hang on a minute Seven . 2547023_2549183
Seven nines are sixty three . 2549183_2550203
Sixty three . 2550203_2550653
Yeah . 2550763_2550833
You work them out like that look . 2550833_2552093
Yeah Well seven nines well ee er it takes you so long . 2552143_2553883
Look one one nine is nine . 2553883_2555723
Yeah . 2555723_2555823
Two nines are eighteen . 2555823_2557533
So that one there is sixes into si thirty six . 2557983_2562753
I know But I still do n't get what you have to write . 2562853_2565363
Well multiplication equation for this number line I would say is er
No but I do n't know what I have to I have to write . 2572133_2573733
Eight times four equals thirty six . 2573733_2576353
Do n't get it . 2576362_2581603
Because it 's one two three four five six seven eight no sorry nine
Write it out on a piece of paper and you 'll and I 'll write them
No You do it yourself I 've told you what to do You do it like that
I do n't get it though . 2603213_2604023
I 'll tell you if it 's right I 'm just writing the answers out for
