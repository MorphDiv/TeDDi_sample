okay, this story is about over twenty years .
starts out with a policeman checking restaurant and stores doors .
ten o'clock at night .
it was cold and windy .
and the policeman sees a man leaning against a store door with a
and asks him what's he doing standing there .
and the man said that +"/.
+" oh, it's no problem officer .
+" I'm waiting for a friend .
+" we had decided to meet here twenty years later at this exact
well, the guy that was waiting in the doorway had <a beautiful gold
and he had a square jaw, keen eyes, and a white scar under his
and the policeman said +"/.
+" well, you think he's going to show up ?
+" it's ten o'clock .
he says +"/.
+" well, if he's here on earth, he'll be here .
+" so you're going to give him some time ?
he said +"/.
+" well, I'll wait at least a half an hour .
so the policeman says +"/.
+" good luck .
so the cigar that he had in his mouth, he lit .
and he's waiting .
and a gentleman comes up with a long trench coat .
and he looks at him .
and says +"/.
+" I can't believe it .
+" Jimmy_Wells .
and they started talking .
and +"/.
+" how's life treating you ?
+" how was the West treating you ?
and they're going back and forth .
and he says +"/.
+" well, it's too bad that the restaurant was torn down .
+" we could have had dinner here .
he says +"/.
+" well, I know a place around the corner .
+" we can go eat and talk .
and he said “okay” .
and he called him Bob .
so now, we know that the guy that was waiting (hi)s name was Bob .
so they're walking across the street .
and there's a drug store with bright lights .
and Bob looks at Jimmy .
and notices that his face is different .
he has a different nose .
he says +"/.
+" wait a minute .
+" you went from a Roman nose to a pug nose ?
he says +"/.
+" well, you_know time changes you .
and he also noticed earlier that he was two or three inches taller
he said +"/.
+" well, I grew after I was twenty .
and he looks at him and says +"/.
+" wait a minute .
+" you're not Jimmy .
so he says +"/.
+" no, I'm not .
+" as a matter of fact, you've been under arrest for the past ten
but here is a note I want you to read .
so he gave Bob the note .
he looks at it nervously .
and reads it .
and he finds out that it's from his friend, Jimmy, who had seen him
he saw his face .
and noticed he was wanted in Chicago under the name of Silky_Bob .
and since they were friends, he couldn't arrest him himself .
so he called a plainclothes policeman to take his place .
and to do the job for him .
so that's that .
this happened when I was in junior highschool .
my girlfriend decided to have a little intimate party at her house
so we invited one of the guys, his name was Leon_Hunt, that was in
and Leon had a fine cousin named Frank, who was visiting from
so we decided that we were going to have a little party over her
and I remember we were dancing .
we were playing Stevie_Wonder I_Was_Made_to_Love_Her, and a_lot_of
and Sharon couldn't dance .
so I was dancing with Frank .
Frank is so, oh he's so cute .
and Leon was just a big fat guy .
he was just there .
and Sharon wouldn't dance .
so I ended up dancing with both of them .
and I go back to the kitchen to get something to eat .
and she's sitting in the back crying .
and I'm saying +"/.
+" what is wrong ?
+" everything I do is always messed up .
+" I'm having a party .
+" and I can't dance .
+" and I'm not having any fun .
+" and you all are not having a good time .
I said +"/.
+" girl you are crazy .
+" we're having a ball .
+" just do anything .
the dance back then was the twine twine time or whatever .
I said +"/.
+" that is simple .
+" just shake you're butt .
+" just do anything because we were just having a good time .
and then she wouldn't come out .
it was crazy .
so then Leon and Frank are sitting in the living room .
they said +"/.
+" what's the matter ?
I said +"/.
+" Sharon's in there crying .
+" I don't know what her problem is .
she said +"/.
+" we're not having a good time .
they said +"/.
+" yes we are .
I said +"/.
+" I know we are .
+" but she's just like that .
so they said +"/.
+" well, should we just leave ?
I said +"/.
+" no .
+" but I mean it's up to you if you want to .
so they said +"/.
+" well, we'll stay a few more minutes longer .
and then Sharon, she never would come back out .
and it was at her house .
it was silly .
so I said +"/.
+" well fellas, I guess it's time to leave because she's going
+" and we'll do this again .
I said “okay” .
I said +"/.
+" but tell Frank to leave his phone number before he goes
so they laughed .
they said “okay” .
