alright we're gonna hand back the exams . 8185_9985
I'm gonna tell you the mean$n first just so you don't get shocked when you see what &=laughs the grades are . 10505_14665
&=laughs &-uh the mean$n for the exam is forty three point one . 14905_19125
okay ? 19565_19985
so &~ye yep that's right okay . 20445_23845
(0.24) course no one's gonna pick up their exam &-um . 80995_81075
(0.19) everyone get one ?
xxx .
how did I mix those up ?
(0.10) hold on Kevin I think I put yours in the wrong bunch . 85995_88555
(0.5) I think <you oughta> &~lo a look over it before we start going over it . 90095_97075
xxx .
what ? 98795_99195
do we have to ? 99415_100015
it's your choice .
(0.19) .
uhuh (0.5) .
okay I graded the +//. 125785_127065
are you gonna look at +//. 127605_128065
you're not gonna look at it ? 128765_129385
I already looked at it +/. 129405_130065
oh okay +/. 130105_130485
+, I don't need to look at it anymore . 130485_131685
&=laughs .
(o)kay well we're gonna go over it so I would suggest to you if you don't wanna look at it to look at &-uh I graded the first problem &-um problem one A and B which was only worth twenty points but it took me seven hours this weekend to grade it . 131885_144485
so that's how we hadta rearrange the grading so &-uh Ali graded the rest of them &-uh so I can answer very detailed questions about the first one as far as the grading I'm gonna go over the solutions for all of it though . 144575_154815
the grading questions in the first one I can answer those &-uh but the other ones I <I can> I can you help with but Ali will be the one to make the final decision on that . 155235_163375
&-uh alright now I'll tell you once I've given you the mean$n I'll give you now that I've given you the mean$n I I'll give you more detailed information on the statistics . 167115_173195
(0.4) okay so mean is &-uh forty three point one and the standard deviation is twenty point three . 174515_192775
wait no that's not right sorry . 193755_194875
the standard deviation is eighteen point seven . 195445_197485
okay ?
&-uh the averages on each of the problems problem one &-uh eleven point two with a standard deviation of three point two . 198585_205685
the second problem eleven point six &-uh well the first problem was out_of twenty this one's out_of forty it's eleven point six out_of forty with a standard deviation of thirteen point three . 206785_217905
so the standard deviation is bigger than the &~s the average score . 218245_221185
and the third problem twenty point three was the average and the standard deviation was ten point two . 222065_229605
&-uh if you're interested to know our class average we got all the statistics here we did everything . 230985_236585
&-uh our class average in this this discussion section is forty one with a standard deviation of twenty &+f twenty four point zero . 237405_247085
&=laughs so there's lots_of numbers there you can do what you want with (th)em but at least you have (th)em . 247945_251485
&-um okay &-um before I even start going over the &-uh exam I wanted to to say something about &-uh what what should be your approach to taking an exam like this . 252585_263425
when you +//. 263545_263905
when he tells you that the mean$n is are are really low . 264845_268065
like he said something about how the first exam last year the mean$n was a seventy something . 268205_272505
and that that was a really high mean so you know that they're normally lower than that . 273005_278865
when you have an exam like that your philosophy hasta be different than an exam where you know the mean$n is like a ninety or ninety five or something like that or really high . 279225_285525
because you need to go through and like just say I gotta pick up points anywhere . 286065_289765
okay and this is gonna apply to +//. 290085_291005
the reason I'm telling you is not to like say you know do it differently or you did it wrong but to say you know you have a couple more exams ahead of you just to think about it differently &-uh when there are when there +//. 291045_302525
when the mean$n (i)s so low you wanna try and pick up as many points as possible so what that means is going with the problems first that have the most points if you don't know how to do a part skipping it and going to do a part you do know how to do . 303025_312785
&-uh a_lot_o(f) people spent a long time on the first problem there wasn't anyone that didn't do the first problem a_lot_o(f) people didn't do the second problem . 313305_319485
the second problem was &~wor &~f was &~wo was worth forty points the first one was twenty . 319605_323145
people spent a long time like giving all kinds of information explaining things really indepthly for &-uh the reasons for simplifying energy balance <which is> which is good in general but when you have an exam like this when you &-um don't have a_lot_o(f) time you can't really mess with that . 323665_338305
so just keep that in mind &-uh for future future &~e exams you have one more regular exam and then a final exam . 338825_345985
&-um (0.6) okay .
(0.6) oh wait I didn't give you the highs and the lows I just forgot to do that . 348545_360885
the high was an eighty eight and the low was fifteen . 361045_363685
okay ? 364405_364725
alright now let's go over this exam . 367635_370035
(0.12) yeah okay . 374455_382315
problem one we're expanding the energy balance like we've done a_lot_o(f) times . 383175_386375
&-uh we're giving it an energy balance so we're gonna start from that and not &-uh something else . 387015_391295
you_know a_lot_o(f) times we can &~s start by &-uh you you know using the book for a liquid or whatever the more simplified equation . 392165_398325
but here you're told specifically to start with equation one and expand it and reduce it . 398525_403385
so you need to give reasons for each of the terms that you're <you're taking> you're taking out that you're getting rid of . 403545_408425
&-uh you can't just say it's a liquid and then write a more simplified form . 409065_412385
&-uh &=writes:board so let's start with this form the same thing for part A and part B . 413085_419945
&=pause_while_writing okay . 445835_446175
so what we have here is we have a liquid film that's falling along a wall so the &~l it wasn't clear from the picture this is the wall here on the left side . 446655_460675
with &-uh TS is the temperature there and you're given the &-uh velocity profile and you guys have seen these before in fluids and what that is . 461835_474395
&-um giving the velocity for this plane right here when it is going down &-um in a z@l direction . 474895_482755
and &~y you can give it a coordinate system so some people or at least one person I saw used radial coordinates &-um which shouldn't because you have the information right there . 483185_493585
okay so liquid film is falling down the surface of a cool wall the other side of the liquid film is exposed to ambient air at temperature t@l infinity . 495045_500965
okay ? 501525_501805
so it's t@l infinity right here TS . 502805_507625
before I get into actually simplifying it let's talk about physically what's going on (be)cause this is how you would approach it you'd say &~h you know before I can &~s cross off terms I have to know what's going on in my &~situ in in my situation . 505065_516385
so it's TS here right along this wall and t@l infinity anything in contact with this alright ? 517205_522125
as far as what's going on here you hafta think about it alright it's not given for you . 522305_525905
now you have to measure &~thi this fluid comes in at some temperature okay ? 526665_530845
t@l naught let's say you know when it's when it just comes in from wherever it's starting so it's all uniform temperature which is a pretty normal thing to assume . 531445_538345
and &-uh I'll draw this for the case &-uh &~wh what the temperature profile would look like if t@l naught was in between &-uh t@l infinity <and TS> and TS is higher . 539065_549365
when it first came out like the temperature profile would be uniform right there it's all t@l naught alright ? 549825_554945
and if TS is higher then after some time it'll look like this okay ? 555265_561205
this is lower here some heat is lost out here comes in here and then eventually this looks more and more like this until it's looking like this looking like that and eventually when you're down low enough you'll have a straight line here okay ? 561845_580305
&-uh it's kind_of an intuitive for me it's kind_of intuitive like how to draw this but you could also &~i once you simplify the final equation I'll show you why this &~y you'll know that this is the temperature profile . 581785_593825
but just if you know at this temperature here starting off it's not necessarily gonna be the same as either of these something like this is gonna happen where there's gonna be heat transfer in the Z in the &-uh the Y direction okay ? 594185_603865
alright so expanding this for this case &-uh &=pause_while_writing and ask me any questions if you have (th)em anytime please . 605705_619725
&=pause_while_writing okay . 641275_641575
the first thing is we know this is steady state because no information is given about it being at startup or anything else okay ? 642695_650455
that's kind_of the clue and a_lot_of people did a good job on that writing because no one +//. 650915_654055
no information is given we can assume steady state so that's steady state . 654295_658195
&-uh this term here we'll expand in a second but just seeing what we can eliminate in this first one the K has been moved out because it's &-uh we're assuming constant &-uh connectivity for a &-uh for the situation it's not a function of temperature and then you can do that it's &~sc &~scou it's how it's been for all of our problems . 659785_679625
&-uh this fluid is incompressible okay ? 680645_682605
it's a liquid so it's incompressible which means this term here is is zero +... 682835_688135
okay ? 689815_691635
there was a_lot_o(f) confusion on this term here for both parts okay so I should explain what this means . 694015_698715
this term right here is zero when you have an incompressible fluid so for a solid or a liquid this term is zero alright ? 699475_707055
this term right here is almost zero for a liquid or a solid okay ? 707715_714075
so but +//. 714495_715075
so we have a liquid here so this is almost zero it's very small this is zero the reason why we take this term off is (be)cause this is zero not because this is zero okay ? 715655_723215
because people that did that then made a mistake on the second part alright you need to understand that . 723355_727295
for a gas this is significant and this is significant . 727815_730075
so for a gas both of these remain alright ? 730555_732935
but for a liquid or a solid they leave . 733015_735595
right ? 736255_736595
this right here is a thermodynamic property . 736835_739635
this is not a this is not anything having to do with our system for the second problem people talk about the pressure being constant things like that you should recognize this from from thermo this is saying when the this is the molar volume or the density that's the inverse of the density is fixed how does the pressure change with temperature ? 739935_758355
okay so it's not anything to do with the system but just the fluid that's in the system or the &~s solid whatever it is in the system how does it behave when you fix its density and then you change the temperature ? 758435_768075
how does the pressure change ? 768295_769115
if the pressure doesn't change that term is zero if it does that's what it is . 769175_773095
you can write explicit &-uh &~equ you can put an equation of state in there <for a> &-uh for a gas which I'll show you for the the second problem but &-uh for this one you don't need to it's incompressible . 773155_783395
this term right here there's no generation given so no generation . 784675_788315
I was pretty lenient on people not giving really full answers but just crossing off the right terms . 788535_794535
except if they gave &-uh there're certain ones I needed to look for the exact thing which was with &~th this but I was leaning on the first problem part A but not part B but this one right here the viscosity times &-uh the viscous dissipation function . 795135_808375
&-uh you actually don't really know if <in this> in this situation if it's gonna be &-uh negligible or not okay ? 809425_817445
it's gonna depend on what the fluid is . 817545_819305
so I accepted both answers but only if you gave good answers for or a good reasoning for why that's there so if you said the &-uh the viscosity's small for this I'll assume &=enters:S4 okay I'll give you your test . 819865_839405
mm that was a forty three .
mkay +/.
+, &-uh so if you said the viscosity I assume here is is small therefore &-uh this term is is negligible that that was a good answer . 842265_849685
&-uh also if you said I don't know anything about the viscosity so I can leave it in that's a good answer also . 850465_855145
(be)cause both of them are kinda true . 855485_856465
&-uh but <if you> if you crossed if you just crossed it off blindly &-uh not recognizing that it could be significant you lost points for that okay ? 856985_866185
you hadta recognize that &~i it depended on situation and he says clearly describe all assumptions &-uh so that would be an assumption you hadta make about that . 866425_874385
so even if you kept the term you hafta give a reason for keeping it . 874525_877285
alright ? 877605_896285
&-um (0.8) oh and the the the correct thing to do for this that wasn't even done in the solution &-uh some people did is expanding this function here and then crossing off the velocity terms . 879305_896605
and then you're actually just left with one velocity &-uh VZ as a function &-uh DVZDY which you actually have an expression for &~Z VZ so that was the best way to solve it (be)cause you could explicitly put that in . 896905_907805
alright ?
but and we didn't +//. 908325_909225
you didn't hafta do that that I accepted &-uh just crossing it off if you gave a good reason . 909485_913025
&-um and so for this we'll cross it off and say &-um &-um you know it's not &~beca it doesn't hafta do with the velocity profile okay ? 913745_922105
it's not that there's no high velocity gradage@n you don't really know how that'll look I mean you have a a picture but you don't really know the magnitude of that okay ? 922125_930765
so it's the viscosity that's the key here . 930925_932945
okay ? 934545_934885
and so expanding with what we have left &=pause_while_writing okay if we did it correctly that's what should remain . 962785_966585
alright from this diagram here you see that the only velocity we have is going in the Z direction right ? 971065_975965
it's going down . 976105_976905
there's no &~veloc velocity in the Y direction . 977425_979405
there's no velocity in the X direction because it's not even given in the problem . 979905_982925
it's going back into the page . 983065_984085
so right away you can cross out VX and VY and you just say that they're zero . 984305_987805
that that's fine &-uh you don't hafta give much of a reason for that . 987965_990365
and because of that because at least the &~Y the X direction it's into the plane of the board by symmetry you know that this &-uh temperature doesn't vary with X . 991205_1001885
okay so you can cross that off . 1002165_1003325
&-uh and the only remaining thing to say is to be completely correct &-uh and Professor Thompson talked about this in in lecture was comparing the convection term and the conduction term okay ? 1004105_1019445
saying that this term here the conduction is negligible compared to &-uh convection something like that . 1019685_1030805
you could leave it in but &-uh we didn't take off if you left it in but the most correct thing and and and actually only one person did this that I saw is saying that this term was negligible compared to this okay ? 1031545_1043245
I hope that +//. 1045085_1045805
I make &~i I hope that makes sense that you can't say that there's no temperature variation in the Z direction because if you look at how I drew the temperature profile you can see that there is a variation in the Z direction okay ? 1045625_1054945
(be)cause as it moves down it changes <at any> at any given point <if you> if you go down it changes so you can't say that +//. 1055625_1062145
you can't cross out both of these and say the temperature doesn't vary in the Z direction it's only crossing off this and one saying it's negligible compared to this term not that there's good +//. 1063505_1070125
there still will be a temperature variation in the Z direction okay ? 1070285_1072645
so conduction is negligible compared to convection and that's the final form xxx p@l sub v@l VZ xxx and then you're able to +... 1072905_1087105
and like I said you'd have another term here for this viscosity if you left that in for DVZ DY but you're just left with VZ and you can plug it in . 1087865_1098485
&-uh you can plug in the V that's given there but we didn't require that of people &-uh (be)cause then you'd actually have everything in terms of Y and you could really &~s well . 1098875_1108375
I dunno if you'd be able to solve a differential equation since we didn't require it I haven't looked into it but that should be your final answer . 1108975_1113575
&-um and it's kinda interesting to note <if you> if you divide through and just make this some kind of you can recognize what's the constants are let's just call it beta for now just this is the unsteady state equation &-uh except for this is a Z okay ? 1113955_1128615
we're used to saying DTD T is equal to &~s alpha and then the second derivative of temperature with respect to a direction . 1128975_1135215
and so that's that's kind_of exactly what we we see here like if &~w if this was a flat plate and instead of this being Z this was time this is how we'd expect it to look over time . 1136075_1144875
it would eventually reach steady state where the temperature gradient look like that okay ? 1145595_1149915
so that's problem one A which we spent way too much time on any questions ? 1150575_1154515
(0.4) okay (0.4) part B . 1157035_1163435
alright you have well lemme tell you the common mistakes on the first one was saying DTZ or DTDZ is zero which isn't true people didn't recognize that VY was equal to zero and they didn't recognize it was steady state . 1164055_1177075
okay ? 1179615_1180235
this problem here we have &=writes:board glass and the glass is right here this is air in the center T say t@l outside and and t@l inside for now okay ? 1181015_1196575
and the system as he says is the air that's between the two glass plates and these are at different temperatures and there's no reason to assume that they're the same let's say that the t@l inside is the &-uh is the hotter one so TI is greater than t@l naught . 1196445_1211325
what it'll look like inside is it'll be convection in here . 1212065_1216085
okay ? 1216705_1216805
due to a density gradients . 1217545_1219845
this is hotter over here so it's gonna rise along this wall here it's gonna come down on the cooler side and this is what we have this is what we talk about when we have natural convection and it'll be like this too in here alright ? 1221015_1234395
&~s maybe seventy percent of the people didn't recognize that there's natural convection here . 1235135_1238675
they they treated this as if it was a solid and they ended up getting the the form that we'd expect for a a solid which is the replauchian@u of the temperature is equal to zero . 1239015_1249355
which isn't &~tru correct for for air . 1249775_1251775
okay ? 1252155_1252335
&-uh so starting with that same one up there and I guess we're writing this here the same coordinates as the other one &-uh I'll just go through each of these terms this is also steady state okay ? 1255665_1268105
there's no indication that this is in startup so steady state . 1268905_1271825
this term like I explained is not zero for this case alright this is a gas and this is not zero it's a gas so this is not zero this needs to stay . 1273645_1280765
you can't say it leaves because it's incompressible or +//. 1280905_1284465
(be)cause it's definitely not an incompressible gases aren't incompressible . 1284745_1286945
but also you can't say anything about the pressure <in the> &~situa in the situation not changing xxx there's a thermodynamic property that pertains to air . 1288505_1294645
okay so this is not correct for this case so that stays . 1295165_1299485
this one low mu for &-uh for air most people were able to pick that up and so this term is is negligible and there's no generation system okay ? 1300075_1310615
so +... 1311355_1312175
I'll just rewrite it and be lazy +... 1315415_1316515
xxx &=pause_while_writing okay so if you keep that term you'll be left with that over there the steady state takes it off those two terms drop off and then +... 1353235_1362095
because there's &-uh natural convection happening &-uh there wasn't a coordinate system given but I I accepted it I hadta look at everyone +//. 1362355_1371595
this problem it took me so long (be)cause I was looking at everyone's coordinate system to see what they they put down . 1371795_1376295
so it's independent of which coordinate system you have but assuming that Z is this way Y is up and X is into the board you know that VX is zero because it's symmetrical in that direction . 1377195_1385635
there's not gonna be anything moving over there &-uh so something like symmetry . 1385835_1389515
you didn't hafta give an answer I +//. 1390055_1392075
or you can say that DTDX is zero because the temperature doesn't depend on X so either of those things and the same thing here the temperature doesn't depend on X so this is gone by symmetry . 1392235_1400995
the VY and VZ are present just based on a diagram that you would know for natural convection . 1401395_1405595
the temperature gradients are also present because the temperatures are different it's changing as it's going up it's changing as it's going over to the left and to the right . 1406655_1413595
&-uh these terms are the same thing they're both they're all present . 1414635_1419015
&-uh this right here this here we haven't done anything yet with this but this is the idea of taking the concepts they use and actually applying them you you have expression for the the gradient of a vector and this is velocity and so you can rewrite this this is what it is DVXDX plus DVYDY plus DVZDZ . 1420135_1446035
and because of symmetry again this this term is &-uh there's no velocity in the X direction . 1445625_1450505
so that's zero . 1450705_1451285
these things remain and so that's what you put in here and that's your final form . 1451985_1457065
&-uh an optional thing that he had in the solution but no one did was saying if this is a an ideal gas you can actually write out what this is . 1457325_1464985
(be)cause you know PV equals NRT &-uh so you can D DPDT and you can see that that would be &-um DPDT NR over V right ? 1465725_1481705
and then you're multiplying that by temperature and so then it becomes T &-uh NR over V which is equal to pressure . 1481905_1491825
okay ? 1492225_1492365
so this term right here this whole thing is equal to pressure for an ideal gas . 1492745_1496465
does that make sense ? 1497325_1497965
does it make sense ? 1498505_1500325
we're just doing this derivative here and for an ideal gas this is true so if you take the derivative of this if you divide this it looks like this so DPDT is NR over V okay ? 1500545_1513265
then you +//. 1514305_1514585
that you stick that in here and you multiply that by T and then you're left with +//. 1514825_1519585
then you get this which according to the ideal gas equation is equal to P so this whole thing becomes P and so you can just put a P there but you don't need to do that okay but you need +//. 1519615_1529115
you did need to recognize that this thing can expand and one of the terms drop off . 1529115_1531835
a_lot_o(f) people said common mistakes were not realizing that convection is present like I said about &~pre maybe seventy percent of the students didn't do that didn't recognize that and then saying this term is zero for a whole slew of reasons like I said . 1535935_1550155
&-uh that's it's incompressible the pressure doesn't change remember it's a thermodynamic property . 1550555_1555435
okay ? 1556175_1556255
any questions on that one ? 1556575_1557695
(0.7) mkay (0.4) alright (0.7) alright problem three probably do this on the overhead . 1579175_1581055
(0.25) alright .
this problem the key thing for the second problem &~sh show you that again is recognizing that this is a fin okay ? 1607965_1617125
it's a fin in that it it the exact physical &~situa the &~physica the physical situation is exactly the same as what we know for a fin except that it's not told to you it's a fin . 1617525_1626665
so it's you having to recognize what it was the fin &~beh how a fin behaved and seeing this as exactly the same . 1626905_1633425
and so everything that we derived for a fin applies to this situation . 1633545_1635965
alright we even &-uh gave you +//. 1636185_1638485
oh &-uh if this was unclear this first part &-uh I thought that it might be unclear thinking of this as an unsteady state problem &-uh (be)cause it surprised me how long <it would> take time . 1639705_1649365
but we put up the hint thing that said &-uh that we're talking about L for length not time here . 1649785_1656785
okay so there could there there shouldn't ha(ve) been any confusion here on that but a_lot_o(f) people took this to be an unsteady state problem . 1657065_1662205
&=writing_on_overhead_next_2:45_of_utterance it's a steady state problem . 1662845_1663965
&-uh you have a long square copper rod &-uh just like that . 1665285_1668805
this end right here is maintained at a hundred in the same way that the fan is maintained at t@l naught at that end and it's exposed to a fluid at twenty five degrees Celsius . 1669125_1677865
you're given the heat transfer coefficient so you have the temperature which is t@l infinity the K of the copper and the the H of the fluid . 1678465_1685205
okay ? 1685605_1685705
you have those in two places okay ? 1685885_1687985
so once you recognize it's a fin that's why &~th there was standard such a large standard deviation on this &~f is because you almost got it and then you did really well and got a_lot_o(f) points or you didn't realize it and you didn't get anything or you got a very small amount . 1688185_1701825
so once you recognize that it it is a fin &~i then nothing nothing was difficult about the problem &-uh after you recognize that that was the &~h the hardest step I guess . 1702825_1714045
&-uh hold on &=pause_while_flipping_through_test okay so yeah we're &~h we're solving for the length . 1714945_1726945
okay ?
and you're asked to find the minimum temperature approximately how long does the rod hafta be for the minimum temperature ? 1728785_1734685
if you know it's a fin you know the minimum temperature is at the end of fin right there okay ? 1734805_1739625
so we have the temperature profile for a fin this right here is the uninsulated case &-uh <we decided> this (be)cause this is so small you can assume it's &~unin uninsulated but if you wanted to use his equation and put l@l sub c@l in well he &~u he did use l@l sub c@l in the solution but you didn't need to have the &-uh the exact case to a solution that Professor Thompson had derived . 1742385_1764505
remember it's not really necessary for the things that we're dealing with to do that you can always just modify this case one solution with l@l sub c@l . 1765205_1772065
&-uh let's see yeah so remember this is T we're talking about t@l minimum occurs at X is equal to L and so you plug in X is equal to to L here <this is zero> this is zero the &~cosi &-um yeah hyperbolic cosine of zero is one and then you're left with &-uh this right here . 1773285_1791945
the hyperbolic cosine of of ML and then you change this to t@l minimum and +... 1794115_1797995
you're left with that the cosine of ML is equal to ten and then you solve for for M for this case right here H you're given K you're given area is the crosssectional area as we talked about it comes under the derivation and the perimeter you just you can so you can figure out it's the thickness of this is is twenty five and there's four sides around . 1801525_1825045
or point point zero two five meters and then you multiply that by four that's the perimeter you get &=writes:board so that's eight inverse meters &-um if you you do the &~in to get this from this step to this step you do the &-uh inverse hyperbolic cosine of ten and you get this and you're left with ML +... 1825675_1842675
and plugging in L is equal to this right here just plugging in the numbers . 1846255_1851155
so &~y in the solution did +//. 1851875_1853235
&~y <you can> use L you could use l@l sub c@l just the same either of those would've been just fine alright ? 1854025_1858845
questions on that part ? 1860085_1861145
(0.11) okay . 1867805_1872325
and if the rod is point five meters long how much heat is lost ? 1872945_1878545
and so you need the efficiency for a fin and when we talk about the heat that's lost we always talk about that . 1880275_1884535
so you can calculate the efficiency of this &-uh using &-uh the equation that we have for efficiency and plugging in the numbers that we know and getting that efficiency . 1885255_1895655
&-um you can also do it with the charts and I'll show you that method in a second . 1896635_1899375
but then then we know that that equation there heat is lost through a fin and we just have a fin now we don't have a pipe so we can deconsider &~an any of the parts of the pipe . 1899515_1908735
it's just the standard equation the efficiency of the fin H times the area of the fin times the temperature difference and we know all of those things . 1909355_1917235
now we're able to solve for the number a hundred and forty point five watts . 1917675_1921655
&-uh questions on that ? 1923015_1924695
(0.5) no questions ? 1930075_1930615
alright alright .
and then you can also do this from the charts and the charts use l@l sub c@l so look up l@l sub c@l &-uh you calculate l@l sub c@l you calculate these quantities that the chart's looking for for this fin and you get &-uh two point zero five for that quantity this &-uh would be a longitudinal fin okay not a circular fin which looks different . 1931115_1956535
and you can see that that the efficiency it gives point thirty five which is is different than what you had up here here we got point two five imagine this is looking it up and I think this this would be closer to this if you had plugged in l@l sub c@l here (be)cause you need l@l sub c@l in this part . 1960305_1974345
either way you'd done it would be fine . 1976605_1977585
that's the Q that you get using that method okay ? 1978005_1980945
questions on that ? 1982905_1986245
(0.4) yeah you need a +//. 1989875_1990435
a key thing was recognizing the area of the fin at four times &-uh the length which is point five meters and point zero two five was the thickness of each of the sides . 1990435_2002655
you didn't need to include this end because it is pretty small compared to the area here but you definitely need to include all four sides in the book the equation for the area of the fin . 2003595_2013115
they they're talking about a very thin fin and so they say like just the top and the bottom they account for and the sides they ignore they use two l@l sub CW but in this case the the thickness of the fin is significant compared to the fin that we've seen before so you need to make sure you include it in . 2013675_2031035
okay ? 2031395_2031435
so as long as you you could include this or not that looks fine but you just need to account for all four sides that were exposed to the fluid . 2031635_2038455
(o)kay +..? 2039475_2039615
I'm guessing there's no question . 2042885_2043465
(be)cause there hasn't been so far .
no questions ? 2044565_2047525
okay .
(0.6) problem three (0.4) okay (0.9) alright we have discs here that are being heated in a furnace give you the thickness and the diameter and they're initially +//. 2054075_2075215
you get the initial temperature at twenty degrees Celsius and air at five hundred degrees Celsius is flowing around them so they're gonna heat up you have the velocity of that &-uh air and you're given this thing here &~th the characterizing Nusselt number okay ? 2075605_2089945
&-uh the important thing to note is that the char convention is +//. 2090205_2094485
characteristic dimension is the disc thickness which is five centimeters that goes in the Reynolds number okay ? 2095265_2101745
people used eight centimeters for some reason &~e when it says specifically to use the disc thickness you need to use that . 2101965_2108045
and with the Reynolds number it just needs to have some kinda characteristic dimension for it okay ? 2108185_2112545
and it's kinda arbitrary what you choose it's just that when you define what's what Reynolds number are for laminate and turbular@n$adj regimes you would take into account whatever whatever length you use but for this case you use the the &-uh the disc thickness so you need to make sure you use that okay ? 2113165_2130025
&-uh no so this is an unsteady state problem we can all recognize that right ? 2130445_2136345
it's it's a_lot clearer than the second one which might've been confusing when you hadta recognize that <it was> it was a fin it was unsteady state this is unsteady state and you're talking about &-uh the temperature eventually it asks for for pretty much the the define the temperature at a certain time so what we do when we see these problems is to see what the BO number is remember ? 2136715_2157355
to compare the &-uh the the resistances in the inside it the solid and in the the gas and this is ceramic so you can you could guess right away that the BO number is gonna be large and it's you're not gonna be able to treat this as a lump sum &~he heat capacity where you can &-uh treat the temperature inside it as the exact same all the way through . 2157545_2179185
so if you would've done that and just said alright this is ceramic BO number's gonna be large I can just go right into the unsteady state looking at the charts or just like I said before you can always go into the chart for unsteady state problems . 2179865_2190985
it's always gonna be more accurate than the lump &~ti sum heat capacity method but it just might be more work so but if you did that that's fine but one of the things that you can do is &-uh solve for the BO number but &-uh you can't really well the first thing &~b before you need that I guess that's for part B . 2190965_2208305
to do part A heat transfer coefficient okay ? 2208725_2211805
you just need to calculate these these things knowing which the H comes from here . 2212765_2219085
according to this relationship here H <is equal> Nusselt number times K over L and you have this expression here so you need to solve for the Reynolds number using the disc thickness and the Prandtl number . 2219745_2228925
and here_you_go this is the density you need to decide what things they apply to . 2230145_2233865
the Reynolds number are the properties of the &-uh the &~ga the gas air in this case plugging in the viscosity for that . 2234215_2242095
&-uh fifteen eighty is the Reynolds number . 2242835_2244135
you have a_lot_o(f) people said this is laminar . 2244295_2246215
&-uh there's no reason to &~assu to say it's laminar or turbulent because you're given the equation for finding H already . 2246635_2251815
and also you don't know if it's laminar or turbulent because of what I said . 2252515_2255915
&~s &~s it the &~d the &-uh disc thickness is the characteristic dimension depending on how you change that it would change the regime for laminar or turbulent flow so that that's incorrect . 2257735_2266935
Ali marked that but didn't take off points for that . 2267195_2269095
so you have fifteen eighty for that the Prandtl number &-uh mu c@l sub p@l and mu is for air &-uh the heat capacity for air also and the K is for air okay ? 2269475_2283035
remember that the Prandtl number is a property of the fluid you guys looked it up for air I mean you you couldn't in this problem (be)cause you were given the numbers but since you know you can look it up on a chart just for air you should know that all the properties that go into it are the ones for air not for the ceramic okay ? 2282835_2296915
and you get point six four one . 2297295_2299255
and you're able to calculate the Nusselt number with those two numbers plugging into that equation above . 2301215_2304915
point five eight four is the constant in front you get twenty and then using this equation right here you can solve for H which actually turns out to be the same number he said to assume in part B so I'd assume it's sixteen usually . 2305465_2320745
if he says that he'll give you a new number to start with just so you have something to go with in part B if you couldn't get part A . 2321265_2326085
it happens to be the exact same number so that was kind_of a check for you . 2326605_2329245
for some reason you got sixteen you saw that he was saying sixteen you probably knew you were correct on that one . 2329165_2334665
&=writes:board &-um okay and then for part B this is where you would need to check the BO number okay ? 2335445_2340405
it's kinda hard to see there &-uh let me write it on board . 2341445_2345225
(0.7) BO number is equal to H how you do know that ? 2347365_2355665
the volume over the area times K &-uh you couldn't just use +//. 2357215_2362635
now this is equal to x@l one according to the book and then they give you different things for x@l one &-uh a_lot_o(f) people took the x@l one for a long cylinder this isn't a long cylinder this is a short cylinder okay ? 2363255_2372875
a long cylinder needs infinitely long so there's really no &-uh there's no end effects there's no area off the end . 2372995_2379255
but &~th in this case we do and so you need to account for that so you figure out the the volume of this is pi times point zero four squared point zero five &-uh which is equal to point zero zero zero three meters squared okay ? 2379695_2400575
so it's pi r@l squared times the the height to get the the volume and then A is the surface area two pi times point zero four squared . 2401615_2414475
and that's accounting for the stuff off the top (be)cause this is &-uh pi r@l squared times two of them . 2415255_2421995
okay that's the area for the the circles on top of this thing plus pi times the diameter times the height to get the surface area up the sides okay ? 2422715_2433835
point zero five okay ? 2435155_2438375
which is equal to point zero two three meters squared and V over A with a point zero one thirty three . 2438715_2449555
and now you know this you already have H and then K is gonna be the K for the solid this time because of the BO number compares . 2451795_2459975
and we're talking about what's going on in the solid compared to what's going on in the fluid . 2460875_2464155
we know that K is gonna be that for the ceramic which is point zero eight there . 2464715_2469155
and if you plug those numbers in &-uh you can kind_of see right there the BO number is equal to sixteen times this divided by point zero eight and this is two point six five okay ? 2470075_2483255
so two point six five is the value for the BO number which is greater than point one which is probably what you would've expected knowing it's a ceramic . 2483915_2489775
so you do need to use the charts . 2490315_2491655
you can't assume lumped heat capacity &-um and you're asked to find the minimum temperature in the disc after two thousand two hundred and fifty seconds assuming this heat transfer coefficient . 2491855_2507135
so again if you weren't able to get this you could start off with it so you were able to do part B remember if you couldn't do A try and do B . 2507375_2513855
pick up whatever points you can when you know that the mean$n (i)s gonna be low . 2514315_2516755
&-uh is it sufficient to increase the minimum temperature to four twenty five ? 2517505_2521705
the minimum temperature inside disc that's flowing with &-uh fluid on the outside is gonna be in the center okay ? 2521825_2527465
lowest temperature (be)cause it starts off there it's gonna be the farthest from the fluid . 2528865_2532605
so the minimum temperature's at the center &-uh now this right this this shape that we have here <it's a> &~s it's a cylinder or &-uh yeah . 2533285_2545305
it's a cylinder but as far as what how to treat it from the charts we need to treat it using the tubes . 2546345_2552845
remember how we talked about you &~n be to treat like a tube for this very same case here . 2553005_2556865
you have a cylinder we have the case for a long cylinder where there's no end . 2557465_2561805
remember the case for two flat plates and you know how to relate those two . 2562185_2565845
I'll show you how to do that but you need to recognize that . 2566325_2568365
okay ? 2569645_2570625
you need to get M and X &~fro for the charts okay for both of those charts that that we were gonna get and this is the equation that relates them the Y of the disc for this whole thing is the Y of the cylinder times Y <of a> of a plate . 2571165_2584885
and so you know you need to get +//. 2585345_2586145
you're gonna be looking at two different charts to get that information (be)cause we wanna get the M for cylinder &-uh same K and M for a plate the same K for both of them from there &-uh H is the same at sixteen the axis is gonna be different . 2586285_2602465
it just depends on how the the chart defined x@l one as the characteristic dimension here it's &-um (0.7) point zero four so it's half of this this is the dimension here for these &-uh for the cylinder and then for the flat plate half of this distance from the center up and so that's &-uh two point five where is that at ? 2602445_2632285
right there point zero two five so you'll be able to calculate the M for both of those cases the alpha is the same for for both of them . 2631635_2639275
alright ?
you'll need to calculate one for for each . 2639975_2642015
this is the &-uh thermal &-uh diffusivity for the solid okay ? 2643035_2649215
so you need to plug in the properties of the solid you get that number there and from that looking at the charts you're able to well you have to +//. 2649315_2659695
I'm sorry you have calculate X first there's the equation for that right there alpha T over x@l one squared that's why you need to calculate alpha so you can plug in alpha here and the time you're given <equal to> two thousand two hundred fifty seconds x@l one is the characteristic dimension depending on which &~s system you have . 2659715_2679615
here it's point zero four like this and here you use point zero two five the math isn't shown but it comes out to one point zero one for the plate and the cylinder is point thirty nine four but now that you have the M and an X for the both the cylinder and the plate you're able to to look on the chart and find the Y . 2680035_2697195
so the Y of the cylinder point four for this figure the Y of the plate is point two from that figure (0.4) and then you multiply (th)em together with two y@l-s just like we see up here multiply them together get the Y for the disc and then you have the equation for for Y it's not shown here so I'll write it on the board +... 2699305_2724385
&=writes:board Y is equal to t@l one minus T over t@l one minus t@l naught . 2727925_2734405
okay ?
and we're looking for this temperature here t@l naught is the initial temperature of the solid and t@l one is +//. 2735365_2742945
I'm sorry yeah t@l naught is the initial temperature of the solid t@l one is the temperature of the fluid going outside . 2743525_2747625
<and so> just multiplying this off solving for T with with Y in there that you got &-uh plugging in five hundred as the outside temperature . 2748225_2756385
the initial temperature of the solid is twenty and so you get four sixty two degrees Celsius which is in fact &-um greater than four twenty five so the answer is is yes . 2756885_2767645
(0.10) okay and that's everything for that problem . 2777005_2779845
&-uh any questions on that one or questions in general about the test or anything in the last couple minutes that we have ? 2780765_2786485
you gotta have some questions . 2787685_2788785
I think that you added wrong .
you have a what ? 2789345_2791405
added wrong . 2792085_2792725
you added ⌈ wrong ⌉ ? 2793065_2793645
⌊ &-uh ⌋ no my points are added wrong . 2793805_2794945
oh okay bring that to me afterwards . 2795065_2796765
questions <on the> on the test ? 2798205_2799925
can we have more time on the next one ? 2800365_2801565
+, (be)cause that fin problem I don't know I figured it out at the end but ⌈ I wasn't ⌉ +/. 2803695_2807315
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, done and ⌈ didn't ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/. 2808715_2808875
+, have the time .
again like we &~don we don't write the exams exams Professor Thompson's the one so you'd hafta ⌈ talk to ⌉ +/. 2809615_2812715
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, him but that's just kinda how he's been doing it for many years and it seems like that's how most of the engineering exams are in chemical engineering it's that you're given a_lot to do and a_lot_of times the mean$n (i)s really low so &-uh that's why a good question ask professors beforehand before an exam is you know what's the typical mean in your exam ? 2812895_2830755
and if it's lower you know you should have a different way of approaching it . 2830835_2834115
I mean if it's a high if it's a high mean you wanna go through and and and do every part perfectly and you'll probably have enough time to do it because most people that do it have enough time to get a high mean &-uh otherwise you wanna just go around looking for points if there's a low mean . 2834475_2847255
okay ?
other questions ? 2847635_2849995
(0.4) nothing .
okay that's it . 2853515_2857755
see you guys later .
you can come talk to me individually if there's anything oh I should give the forms back to you &=unintelligible_conversation
