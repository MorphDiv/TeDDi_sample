please put them all back in the bowl and stir them all together .
xxx why does it matter how many we took ?
remember the grasshopper xxx .
ah <you've done> you've done one already have you ?
we did xxx we did like an actual experiment .
it's easy with m@l and m@l-s it works with m@l and m@l-s .
&=laughs:multiple okay .
&-um someone with a calculator Steven yours you have a calculator don't you ?
no actually &=laughs:multiple someone took it actually .
oh does anyone have a calculator ?
I do .
just if you could total the number for me it would make my life easier .
xxx .
seventy seven .
seventy seven .
seventy seven .
&=multiple_unintelligible_conversations .
it works .
okay .
now if they're all mixed up what we do is we now &~wh what we'd do normally &-um is you go out and you would catch a bunch of fish and you would mark them .
you mark them in a number of ways .
one way is to clip a fin .
typically if it's a trout you would clip the adipose fin or maybe a little piece of the dorsal fin or the anal fin .
usually not &~whi or or the paired fins for that matter .
&-uh you you take a clip out .
and &-um then you put the fish back .
and then you come back on another occasion say a day later a week later a year later or whatever and you recapture a bunch of fishes .
so now we go back and we'll start from the other end of the class this time you take a small handful and what you do is you count the number that have been &-uh you &~tot count the total number that are in the &-um the total number that have been &-um &~captu recaptured the total number of yellow ones and the numbers that were marked amongst those yellow ones .
so now we resample the population and we keep a total of the the total that we catch and the number which are marked .
plus &~i and the number that are marked .
okay ?
so now what you need to do quite simply &-um is to count the totals and the numbers <that are> &-um that are marked .
&-um and obviously when you recatch the fish if you're recapturing them you look for the number that are marked and &-uh and and so on .
often if you go to a &-um +//.
if you're of the boat dock stand round the lakes here you'll find fishermen will bring in fish that are marked .
and Petoskey there is frequently a DNR officer who is actually interviewing people about their fish and checking to make sure they haven't exceeded the fishing limits and &-uh they will give him the marks and so on (be)cause a_lot_of fish are marked and you can mark fish in different ways .
you know if you got fish from say if you're &~f &-uh planting trout into the Great Lakes and they've come from <different hatcheries> different hatcheries may mark fish before they go into the water .
and then they might recapture them and they can get estimates of the survivorship of fish from different hatcheries .
the survivorship of fish from hatcheries is pretty low .
&-um fish that are raised in hatcheries haven't been raised in the hurly-burly of the real world .
so they typically tend to be not as good competitors they tend to be much better as prey items from the perspected of predators and so on .
so they +//.
&-um it's generally considered that &-uh by many that the bulk of the production from hish fish hatcheries goes to increase the growth of the resident populations hopefully the wild populations .
so we have some numbers here .
&-um maybe if I could write these up you could plunk them in for me .
sure +/.
+, &-um I hope this will work .
given my life these days who knows ?
okay so what we're going to do is to find a pen and start off .
Sarah how many did you recapture ?
five .
five and how many were samples ?
four .
four .
so +/.
+, yes so here are the numbers recaptured +...
&-uh no that's that's the next one over .
probably easier to use the arrows (be)cause it's &-uh +/.
+, okay +/.
+, yeah okay the &~nu put in the number &~cap the total captured which is five and the number that were recaptured was four .
and that estimates the population at ninety six .
how many did you say Michelle ?
I said a hundred .
yeah hundred .
&-uh what you're doing essentially is <we know that> &-um we know that seventy seven were marked .
and we caught another five and we found that &-um five fourths of these were marked .
so if we multiply the original number by the proportion that are marked in the recapture .
that is an estimate of how many fish there should have been in the entire population .
(be)cause if we'd marked them all you see this number would be five over five .
&-um and if we mark very few then &-um &-uh &~the if we mark very few of the actual population then the number that are marked when we recapture is going to be very smaller and so on .
so let's have some more numbers here .
what if a bunch died in the interim ?
I'll +//.
let's get to the assumptions in a second okay ?
(0.4) Mary ?
three and one .
three and one .
oh that gives two hundred and thirty one as our estimate .
next ones ?
&~nop three and two .
three and two .
that gives an estimate of one hundred and sixteen .
two and zero .
two and whoa zero .
what does that give us ?
none .
no it tells us that the population size is infinite that we have an infinite number of m@l and m@l-s .
I think I'm ⌈ gonna ⌉ +/.
⌊ yes ⌋ +/.
+, take that number and become an economist .
&=laughs:multiple or an m@l and m@l manufacturer .
so this is gonna give us infinity okay .
&-uh six and three .
six and three .
hundred and fifty four .
three and two .
three and two .
&-uh four and one .
four and one .
ten and nine .
ten and nine .
&=laughs .
&-uh one and one .
one and +//.
one and one that's exactly seventy seven isn't it ?
your &~indi your you indicate that every single fish in the +//.
that every single yellow m@l and m@l in the population was marked .
Jody ?
one and five .
one and five ?
⌈ five and one ⌉ .
&=laughs .
⌊ &~fi five and one .

six and two .
six and two .
eight and four .
eight and four .
four and two .
four and two .
one and one .
one and one .
seven and four .
seven and four .
five and two .
five and two .
okay .
so our numbers here range from a population estimate of two hundred and thirty one to seventy seven .
and this is a pretty simple situation .
so it means the the average the mean$n of our population size the mean$n estimate is one hundred and sixty seven yellow ones but the standard deviation is eighty nine .
&=laughs:multiple this is a pretty simple experiment .
doesn't that just mean we have to do more samples ?
well that's a good question .
let's think of some of the assumptions now .
first of all &-um each one of these is an estimate of the population .
it is considered that if you have a minimum of seven &~replica &~sa resamples seven resamples then you've got a good estimate of the population size .
we have got substantially more than seven and look at the variation .
okay ?
now but what about the assumptions ?
the assumptions for a mark and recapture model were met in this experiment to the best of my knowledge .
Michael said what happens if there are some deaths ?
well if there are some deaths then obviously if there is differential mortality .
suppose clipping the fin is a stressor that tends to give higher death rates of the clipped animals &-um you're going to get &~wha &-um very &~sub fairly substantial overestimates of the population size .
and of_course you are handling those fish that you marked .
now in your experience what's the survival rate of a_lot_of the fish you handle ?
it depends .
it depends on the species doesn't it ?
but if we get minnows on a hot day .
&=laughs not very good .
yeah &-um okay so so &~tha so if in the time period that we've looked at there's been differential mortality then we'll get &-uh unusual population numbers or &~i inaccurate population numbers .
and one of the assumptions of the method is that there is no differential mortality and you know from your experience that that is sufficiently close to a load of hogwash as to be &-um hogwash .
what happens if there are births in the interim ?
+, that's gonna have the opposite effect at increasing the numbers .
and for this kind of reason you try to take a relatively short time period .
you know &-um a few days and so on in doing these estimates .
when you're trying to estimate population sizes if you possibly can .
but what about immigration ?
if we mark the fish on the big shoal here where are the fish gonna go ?
are they gonna stay there ?
what happens if they decide to go and see their relatives on the other side of the lake ?
what of the other hand if there is &-um <what'd I say immigration> ?
suppose there's immigration and emigration ?
obviously that is going to affect the numbers .
so there're a_lot_of assumptions that are contained in this particular model .
yet it's probably the best direct &~measu method that we have available .
and you can see that with something as simple as this we've got numbers that are very &~b very very wide ranging .
now you can refine the method &~a at least in theory you can refine the method by doing multiple markings .
for example if you collect a sample of fish say seventy seven if we were to go around and take all these and put a second mark on each one you would then know which were marked originally which were marked the second time and you could begin to estimate things such as mortality .
and if you put &~multias you add multiple marks on the fish &-um you're able to get better and better estimates of mortality .
mind you fish have only got so many fins to clip .
and you know from what we talked about in terms of functional morphology and locomotion that if you clip too much off a fin you're gonna impair its ability to swim you're gonna impair its ability to avoid predators you're gonna impair its ability to catch prey .
there are other ways of marking the most common method actually now is to shoot a tiny little piece of metal into the nasal capsule .
there's cartilage around the nasal capsule I can shoot a tiny little piece of metal into the nose capsule .
&-um no fish has ever complained so presumably it doesn't hurt the fish .
and <this is> &-um this is coded electromagnetically so that you can get the fish and you can sort_of stick it into this electromagnetic thing you get a beep and you get that kind of information .
it's a superior method .
&-um for some larger fish they put external tags on .
because often the source of sampling are fisher persons .
and they don't usually have these devices for putting the noses of their fishes in this electromagnetic sensor and so on .
so they put tags on the outside and &~the they are gonna impair the fish .
they're nice little flags that other predators can see and those kinds of things .
so they send very definite &-um signals .
but &-um this then is an example of the mark and recapture method .
and &-um do feel free to sample the catch .
&=loud_eating_sounds:S1 &=laughs:multiple .
how many were in there ?
I've no idea .
oh there were a hundred and sixty seven plus or minus eighty nine +...
anyone please don't eat the other ones .
Phil wants to count them all later .
&=laughs:multiple okay .
so we can estimate numbers .
but when we're dealing with population dynamics we're not interested in just how many there are now but how the numbers vary with time .
so lemme spend a little bit of time and I mean a little bit of time talking about &-um a little bit about the continuous methods and that is the models .
and lo and behold you already know the model .
(0.6) for fishes well for populations in general the most common model that is used to look at population numbers is the logistic model .
(0.6) well you'll recall R little r@l is the symbol that's used for the growth rate of the population and K is the carrying capacity .
and you'll recall that if you plot the numbers as a function of time then this rises to some asymptote where the asymptote here is K the carrying capacity .
and you'll remember that the explanation for the shape of this curve is intraspecific competition .
competition amongst the individuals at some &-uh high population numbers so that the per capita resource base becomes sufficiently small the population &~numbe &-uh growth rate declines .
birth rates go down death rates go up &-um and so on .
bear in mind that the population dynamics people believe that the importance of competition predation and so on comes from its effect on demographics .
and here we had an explanation of this curve in other words the population dynamics in terms of a mechanism .
the mechanism was important in terms of the population dynamics .
in talking further on this and linking it to reproduction and talking about the r@l to k@l continuum we recognize that population another process its impact was on demographics and the the ecological consequences in terms of say releasing populations from competition direct and indirect &~in &~fe effects and so on were mediated via these population &-um effects and so on .
I want to add one factor to this model .
there are many many things that you can put into play with this .
you can put in different growth rates for predators and for prey and you wind up with a Lotka_Voltera models .
you can put in competition amongst individuals and build models that way .
you can put in delays so that say if fish breed once a year what's gonna be the effect and so on .
and these models can get these continuous models can get increasingly complex to try and describe the sort_of average kinds of effects that are going on and so on .
I want to just think about one and that is an issue which is important in terms of &-uh conservation biology threatened species and so on and this is the idea of the minimum population size .
the basic logistic curve makes a very simple assumption .
and that is that the per capita growth the growth rate if you like is constant at every single population density .
it doesn't matter if there are ten fish or a hundred fish if there are ten fish the growth growth rate may be one fish a year if there are a hundred fish it will be ten fish per year but the rate of growth
