so ‡ this is the third game . 795_2516
and we're all +//. 2516_3280
oh ‡ I'm not . 3680_4606
but the two participants are going to speak &-um out loud
actually instead of writing it down . 11246_13746
&-um but if you could write down the cards <you wrote> you

crazy eights . 93870_95140
and why ? 95140_96292
because when you put down an eight it's like a wild card that
and then &+i because it's a diamond card I assume I need to put down
+< unnecessary playing of another card . 107318_109313

because it's kind_of like a wild card . 130501_133702
but like it doesn't matter what was below it . 133702_136806
and that means I have_to put down another card . 136806_140036
so I'll put down (..) crazy eights &=places:card . 140036_146582

that Firstname put down a card of the same value as the continuity
