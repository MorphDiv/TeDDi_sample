<alright xxx hafta alright> when the kids got home the mother
we're gonna go <&~w> to eat tonight .
where do you wanna go ?
and both of the kids looked at each_other .
and they said Mcdonalds !
<xxx &~s> okay .
so the mother got them into the car .
and they drove to Mcdonalds .
&-um Lisa wasn't sure to get a Big_Mac or a Happy_Meal .
so when they went to the clerk the boy said I'll have a
okay .
and &-uh the mother I don't remember what she +/.
<it's okay > .
and Lisa said I'll have some fries, a Happy_Meal, and a coke .
so &-um the clerk said that would be twelve dollars and fifty cents
so then mother reached into her purse to get out her wallet .
but she realized that she left <her &~wall> her wallet at home
that's fine .
great .
<okay &-um all right this is kinda silly but> one day <a kid
so he didn't really get much breakfast .
which wasn't a help at all .
he was very frustrated because he was always getting late .
for instance his <&~sh> shoelace ripping off .
so_that made him so late that he ended up missing his bus .
and <um &~th> when he gotta the school the principal says your
I know .
the bus driver drove away just when I was getting to the bus .
okay substitute bus driver doesn't really know that much
the end .
one day this &-um parents said you know you kids are just <&~pot>
you needta get outside and rejoin the world .
<all> you never know what &-uh amazing things lie <in>
<yeah I bet outside one of &~the but um> Lisa said yeah I bet
so their parents sent Lisa and John out on an adventure .
when they were &-uh very hungry they were gonna try to get some
so when they were looking for some they saw a ship land .
oh yay !
now we can find some new land to live on instead of that destroyed
Lisa wanted to go meet them because they never saw them before .
and she wanted to give them a nice greeting .
but brother tried to stop her .
but she went anyway .
she said hi .
hello .
<we thought this planet> I thought you said this planet was
I thought it was .
oh .
hey get away .
you never know if they have any secret powers within them .
so they said no we don't .
but we wish we do .
oh well .
if there's other things we don't wanna take up other people's space
so they all went back in the spaceship and left .
so the brother and &-um the sister quickly ran home, told their mom
but when they got back there the aliens were already outside of the
but <they left a &~l> something dropped from their spaceship .
it was a little gold coin with chinese written upon it .
which it really was a seal of their planet which was destroyed .
the end .
and that was their only proof .
that was very good
