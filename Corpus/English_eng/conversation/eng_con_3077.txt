yeah . 1750_1870
well . 2970_3100
what is that . 3470_4030
motion . 4080_4230
you're doing in your finger . 4400_5130
are you showing . 5460_5900
the I can &-um you're thinking of see I can tell because up in the
uhhuh . 14010_14160
on the same spot as the other side . 14910_17110
there's a it could it &-um can bend it . 17910_22890
it's not it's the same color . 23640_25460
are you thinking folding here . 25660_26980
yeah . 27080_27260
along . 27360_27630
this line like folding . 27680_29030
oh I see . 29560_30020
well well let's let's see . 30220_31430
what_about this . 31480_31870
one is that one symmetrical . 32110_35070
&-um . 38860_38920
no I didn't . 44420_45580
oh why not . 46060_46520
because this one's going like that one . 47550_49660
and that would touch this and this . 50100_52260
so where are you thinking of folding at this time . 52910_54860
&-um are you thinking of folding . 55590_56790
I'm still thinking like &-um the same . 56940_59900
I'm thinking . 60100_60420
d oh diagonal diagonal fold diagonal . 60800_64780
it would be symmetrical . 65180_66580
it's symmetrical . 67350_68340
ah . 69300_69420
symmetrical . 69860_70160
the symmetrical . 70830_71420
it is symmetrical on the diagonal line . 72560_74590
huh . 75510_75550
okay . 75600_75780
would this one be symmetrical on the . 76160_77520
Al line . 77760_78030
&-um this one . 78080_78780
no this this first one again . 79500_80750
I . 81400_81570
let's see . 82290_82680
&-uh . 84200_84240
to here . 90520_90710
&-um so you can will . 92860_100240
end . 104260_104400
yes . 104580_104740
it is it . 104840_105580
is . 105600_105950
oh okay . 106220_106870
this interesting one is two on the diagonal line . 107420_110830
okay . 111870_112110
and and this one . 114180_115420
now this is your family . 115980_117020
three . 117050_117380
wait . 117590_117750
you have to go in there and say it again . 117980_119430
change . 119900_120150
but do you want family three it . 123890_127590
just hard like this . 129919_131950
what are you thinking of . 132520_133190
like this . 133550_133920
uhhuh . 134890_134980
folding it down like that . 135150_136300
that's down the middle . 136320_137180
uhhuh . 137200_137290
it's symmetrical . 137590_138350
okay . 138730_138910
up .
and down . 139200_139380
but now I'm trying to figure out something's . 139400_141600
so how many ways is the symmetrical on this one . 142680_144670
so you said down the middle behind two . 146060_147990
so two this way and this way . 149320_151220
okay . 151630_151900
&-um and . 153060_153500
to the center . 153780_154260
okay . 154590_154830
I don't . 157600_158270
it's pretty hard to . 158710_159700
<are you> are you thinking about diagonals . 160100_161740
now . 161840_161950
yeah . 162580_162670
is it symmetrical without the diagonals . 162940_164630
what . 165070_165220
do you think of when you think that . 165600_166700
yes it is . 166720_167230
it is . 167750_167990
yeah . 168270_168350
so it's symmetrical on all . 168930_170380
yeah . 170720_170860
ways you can . 171170_171820
what . 172420_172540
yeah . 172620_172750
&-uh all ways you can what . 173130_174350
&-um . 175290_175380
what do you think of when you do that . 176590_177660
&-um . 178510_178580
you can do a diagonal . 179150_180500
uhhuh . 181010_181100
&-um through this through the middle or the center . 181260_185140
uhhuh . 185160_185370
uhhuh . 185530_185750
or &-um or you can do a diagonal . 186220_189020
okay . 189380_189620
are you thinking of folds when you do that . 189820_191420
yeah . 191770_191900
you thinking when of folding it kind of in your head . 192060_194220
okay . 195430_195670
oh I already saved it . 196790_198100
yes I do . 199180_199860
Curtis . 201220_201590
I already saved . 202520_202830
oh what you for . 202880_203500
okay . 205230_205460
are you gonna do another one . 205700_206540
okay . 207270_207510
oh . 208980_209130
family for it . 210280_210920
alright . 212610_212870
Vanessa how are you . 214640_215430
how's this going . 216050_216700
good . 217250_217430
looks like some interesting designs . 218450_220070
how are you doing . 220260_220750
what . 224230_224450
how are you deciding on this one . 224900_226110
what was this one . 226160_226940
you're . 226960_227240
my this is my sixth one . 228620_230110
I'm working on . 230600_230980
oh wow . 231410_231630
okay . 232550_232650
you . 233540_233660
are working with the same core square . 233760_235340
or is it always a different core square . 235420_237500
&-um it I'm working with the same core score . 238820_242010
same core on this quilt on this this one you mean or for all of
just for this one . 248410_248950
just for this one . 249270_249660
and what's this called .
when you use the same core square . 252050_253190
what do you guys call that . 255190_255980
in class . 256120_256380
I I'm trying to remember . 256720_257740
quilt family . 259000_259390
oh quilt family . 259980_260860
why is it called a quilt family because . 261060_262870
they're all of the &-um they're used the same core square . 263110_267070
but they just make . 267180_268610
put together for weight . 269560_270660
oh I see . 271740_272300
but this didn't look like the core square . 272760_274260
look . 274620_274770
Chris got the triangle here . 274840_275940
it's the same flipping on and turning them . 276110_277690
oh . 278020_278050
I see . 278400_278580
okay . 279270_279420
oh so they're all flipped and turn . 281380_282820
how did you decide how to flip and turn . 283260_284860
did you just decide on the design . 284980_286230
mhm . 286420_286570
you want . 286920_287150
we . 288510_288620
not really deciding . 288860_289490
just just exploring . 289950_291590
started into . 291760_292430
you you what . 295050_295590
I'm sorry . 295740_296060
just exploring and seeing . 296310_297480
just exploring . 297670_298420
mhm . 298440_298780
to see what it would look like . 298860_299770
okay . 300380_300590
how are these . 301540_302020
whoops . 302310_302550
uhuh . 302910_303060
you want . 304880_305070
cancel or do you want save us right now . 305760_307350
okay . 308030_308270
you're . 308520_308670
okay . 309670_309790
that is what I wanna save . 309960_311100
and they're gonna say . 311530_312100
you already have because you had saved it once before . 312140_314540
remember .
do you wanna replace it . 314860_315740
and you say . 315780_316090
yes . 316240_316350
because this is the way you want handle it or to look . 316580_318310
not the first one . 318420_319130
so that's not that you didn't do anything wrong . 320080_321500
it's just double checking with you to make sure that you don't . 321670_323860
so now it doesn't have saved anymore the way you saved it . 324480_327060
the first time it has this . 327160_327970
oh my gosh . 329690_330040
is this your four square here . 331110_332190
I'm just going to make another sample so I can know what . 333420_335820
wrong . 336140_336350
what's wrong with this one . 336660_337860
it's nothing . 338670_338990
I just want to know what way if I could do it this to make &-um the
I don't know why I'm just making another . 349800_352340
so . 352540_352600
you're making another . 353190_353780
well well isn't <do you> do you have to make this whole one
yeah . 360250_360390
how are you gonna . 361340_361910
how are you gonna make a different . 362100_363420
how how are you gonna make a square down here . 364340_366370
that's . 366700_367070
what she's talking about Nicole . 367120_369180
why . 369340_369540
why are you doing it on a different piece of paper . 369580_371520
the . 372060_372230
same . 372350_372440
uhhuh . 372970_373040
crash . 375870_376020
because &-um so I'm here like if I turn it it'll show me all the
do . 388340_388460
oh I see . 388820_389390
and if you did it on this paper then . 389910_391950
you couldn't do that . 392570_393060
mhm . 393850_394000
so . 394730_394800
are you so you're gonna use this to try and decide how that one's
yeah . 399340_399450
oh I see does that that . 400330_402660
so this one's gonna help you to turn it . 402680_404260
mhm . 404280_404630
well will it help you to flip it . 405430_406940
no . 408340_408460
no . 409060_409130
why is it gonna be hard to flip it . 410140_412210
oh . 414060_414230
back . 416110_416350
how did you select this design . 418410_420110
I don't know . 421080_421410
I was just sort of going on when I found it <I just> I just
and then I wanted to that . 428570_429940
and then I wanted to do that . 430140_431670
and then I didn't know what to do in the square . 432260_433870
oh I just put a green . 434310_435230
can can when you are doing this one can you switch the if it
or they have to be on the same location . 441860_443900
they I have to be the same . 444710_446300
location . 447680_447900
why is that . 448860_449390
&-uh well they can move when I turn it . 450900_455420
but I . 455660_455930
can't but why can't you move them around &-uh amongst each_other .
because then to two by two are really the same course square . 459870_465850
oh I see . 466770_467100
oops . 467880_467980
okay . 474110_474350
well we'll come back and look when you &-uh have this other &-uh
what is it called . 479520_480230
when you're doing that . 480280_481300
do <a new> a new one . 481980_482860
the same same way . 483540_484590
is there a word for that . 486730_487420
I don't word . 488040_488600
okay . 491700_491910
I need more glue on my glue . 492670_494080
interested on what how you chose . 497090_498380
this is the first one I've seen like that . 498400_499870
&-uh is . 500690_502750
this your core square here . 502800_503460
yeah . 504070_504180
oh I mean we've got a cut &-uh one here too . 505220_507980
is that the same as this one . 508180_509270
oh okay . 510850_511130
can you show us how you are going to decide how to turn the four
I'm turning it . 519260_520159
to . 520580_520730
the &-um right or left . 520820_523900
which hand are you turning it towards . 525720_527240
are you this side . 527750_528390
you're turning it which way which hand are you turning it towards .
if you hold the corner and turn which way . 533880_537260
does it . 537280_537510
go to the left left turn fourth . 537560_542270
so you're deciding that . 543060_544180
so you made a you did like Nicole then you made a copy of this one
and then you're turning it to see how you're gonna do the next
mhm . 552640_552780
oh alright . 553500_553830
well how did you decide on these shapes . 554400_555820
these are shapes that I haven't seen a_lot_of . 555880_558510
oh you're making your two sided core . 562040_563240
square . 563480_563700
okay . 563950_564190
this has to be two sided . 565070_566130
