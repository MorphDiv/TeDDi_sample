okay &-um <I was just about to go to bed and I left my> I
my pet frog was in my jar .
and my dog was just sniffing around in the room .
and my window was just a tiny bit open .
when I went to bed something was not right .
and when I woke up in the morning the frog was gone .
I searched everywhere .
I searched in my boots , under stools , under my bed .
my pet dog helped me search .
and we looked out the window .
my dog fell out_of the window , which was pretty funny .
but we still couldn't find my frog .
<we looked> I put my boots on and walked outside .
I I called into the forest just to see if it heard that +...
I was looking down holes to see .
but all I found was a rat .
I I looked in holes in trees .
but all I found was an owl .
I looked behind rocks .
all I found was a deer .
the deer picked me up and threw me straight <into the w(ater)>
I went splash into the pond .
and then I heard somethink@c .
0 told my dog to be quiet .
I looked over a log .
and there <was my f(rog)> was two frogs .
and then there was a family of them including mine .
I picked up my frog , said goodbye to the others and walked off
