this is the Harry <A> Blackmun Supreme Court Oral History
my name is Harold Hongju Koh .
I'm a former law clerk to Justice Blackmun , and I teach at .
yale Law School .
this is session number seven .
it's being held on <twenty-fourth> of April <nineteen
I'm wondering if you would talk a little bit about the lineage of
I've always felt , and I think it is generally recognized , that
of course it's one of the originals .
it goes back to <seventeen eighty-nine> and <ninety>
for a while , it gave the impression that it was a New England seat
those are all in order .
then that lineage was somewhat broken with the appointment of
that list includes many prominent names , able jurists , and it
did anything pass along to you with the seat ?
you mentioned a couple of times to me that you got some copies of
no , the copies of the Constitution I referred to , I think that
one could acquire them at the Government Printing Office price
but now , if one goes to the <G_P_O> , it costs a dollar
I like them because I can put them in my pocket .
the first one is in shreds , the second one is lost or somebody
it has to outlast me .
it will .
it's in pretty good shape .
we talked a little bit about some of the justices at the last
justice Black , you mentioned just now that he gave you copies of
did you have a warm , personal relationship with him ?
, I think so .
of course , I served just a year and had not known him before I
it was interesting to see how he operated .
I would describe him as canny , really , and much of that is due ,
being a southerner , the combination of all those factors and being
it was sad to see him deteriorate during October term .
, <nineteen seventy> , as he did , and toward the end of
did he talk much about his political past ?
no , not a great deal .
I don't recall his ever having mentioned what the media always does
I don't recall his ever having mentioned that , other than one time
he seemed to surmount that political negative , if it was a
he did talk a little bit about his experience in the Senate .
of course , he voted first after the chief justice .
sometimes he would pass and let the votes accumulate , and then
I had the feeling that Chief Justice Burger looked at Hugo Black as
I think he highly respected him as a person of experience on the
chief Justice Burger had been there for one year at the time that
, one year , yes .
did you sense that Justice Black and Chief Justice Burger were
I think so .
justice Black was never one to hold a grudge or be antagonistic .
I think he respected everyone's point of view .
but , again , this was the politician in him .
but certainly , because I think Chief Justice Burger looked to him
justice Black had well-known rivalries with Justice Frankfurter and
did he ever make mention of these ?
no .
at least not in a caustic manner , ever .
he was the true southern gentleman in many respects .
did you have much one-on-one contact with him ?
would he ever visit you ?
a little .
they were always pleasant , I think .
I learned a lot from Hugo Black .
another famous friend of <F_D_R> who was on the Court
did either Justice Black or Douglas talk much about <F_D_R>
justice Black did not .
justice Douglas would mention this relationship on occasion .
bill Douglas , of course , was independent-minded and independent ;
if he wanted to write , he'd write .
if anybody else wanted to write , why , he'd let them write .
there was that close connection between the president and Justice
I suppose that it might be said also that Bill Douglas came within
justice Douglas was famous for going off to Goose Prairie , where
was that disruptive of the work of the Court ?
yes , he had this place in the state of Washington .
always about the .
tenth day of May , sometimes a little earlier , he took delight in
+" well , my work is done .
which , translated , meant that his majorities were out , and he'd
there was a telephone there , but it was down the road , and one
there was no telephone in his cabin out there .
I think he took delight in making it uncomfortable , because it was
his voice was missing from the conference table .
one never knew what he might say in dissent .
but in fairness to him , his absence never held things up .
he got his writings out in a hurry .
of course , I always felt that Bill Douglas did his .
dissents long before the majority opinion ever circulated .
he just wrote them , put them in the file , and then when the
they were like two ships passing in the night sometimes .
they didn't connect until the second or third draft .
Douglas , I suppose , in a way , was a prolific writer , but he
he didn't delay .
did he speak at length in the conference ?
no , not a great deal .
black would speak at much greater length .
I remember one time , perhaps I've mentioned it to you before in
the senior always sat at the opposite end .
the Chief Justice went on at great length describing a certain case
+" and for these reasons , which I regard as entirely valid , I
then he'd say , +"/.
+" bill , what do you think ?
and in this particular instance Justice Douglas said only this , he
+" chief , for the very excellent reasons that you have spelled
it jarred me a little , but , this was typically Douglas .
he would like to stick a knife in and twist it .
but that was his contribution in that particular case .
we've already spoken a little bit about Justice Harlan who was
but you did have some fond memories of him that you've mentioned in
could you tell us more about that ?
justice Harlan , of course , was I suppose in a way the New York
he had come up through New York practice , and , of course ,
I suppose he was literally blind that year ; had a high intensity
but for the most part , he was unable to read , and that made his
there's a photograph somewhere of Justice Harlan standing up with a
I had a happy experience with him , and it was sad to see him fade
how did he use his law clerks during this period ?
I don't think I can answer that , Professor Koh , with any
I'm sure they discussed everything and read things to him , but he
now in watching the other justices , you've often commented about
were you influenced by the experience you had had watching the
yes , I have always been worried about physical and particularly
federal judges do not serve for specified terms , they serve , not
which means a particular justice can deteriorate , and how do you
impeachment process is one way , of course , but it's a very
on the other hand one can be told that he ought to resign as Oliver
but this has always bothered me .
I wouldn't want to stay in the Court too long , and I suppose one
there are a lot of people who say you're not fit to serve when
and I know how old I was when I finally turned in my suit .
but to your knowledge , nobody asked or suggested to Justices Black
no .
neither one .
because they , until the last days , they were really functioning
if we could now turn to some of the other justices who were there
the chief justice , Warren Burger , was someone you had known for
what was your impression of how he was doing when you got there ?
of course , he'd been there one year , and I was going to say only
you are correct in saying that while I've know him since we were
he practiced in <Saint> Paul .
I was with a Minneapolis firm .
nor were we on opposite sides of any litigation , strangely enough
all of a sudden , we were thrown together on the Court .
I sensed immediately what I've already mentioned , that .
he was looking , not improperly , at Hugo Black for guidance , not
I think this was a good move on his part for reasons that have been
chief Justice Burger did not go in with a sweeping strong hand of
he went in and wanted to cause as little disruption as possible .
it isn't easy to come on the Court under those circumstances .
his advent there was really a very successful one in the sense of
do you think the other justices were wary of your past friendship
I suppose they were .
certainly the media was , thinking that I was a clone of the chief
and I guess it turned out that during the first term or so , I was
but you never actually spoke to any of the other justices about
I don't believe so .
I don't recall that that was so .
they must have wondered .
I suppose that Bill Brennan wondered , and some of the others .
what was your initial reaction , to Bill Brennan ?
my reaction was that of the same reaction everyone else has , that
earl Warren , of course , let him exert that influence .
probably a greater influence than one in his then what'll I'll
there are a lot of comments in the media about how he was a
in my point of view , never was that in the adverse meaning of the

+" harry , you have to vote this way .
or anything like this .
if he built a consensus , it was through the written word , his
it is sometimes said that Justice Brennan would court the newcomers
did you see any sign of this ?
I had no feeling that I was being wooed by him in any way .
he was always pleasant to me .
I think he was no different to me than he was to anybody else .
I remember in my first circulated opinion , which was not unanimous
he didn't pound the table or say anything about the opinion .
he merely came in and said , +"/.
+" you know Harry , it's customary here that one's first opinion is
+" the chief justice sees that he gets an opinion in which the
+" this is not so with your first opinion .
I think it came out six to three , eventually , and he almost
just the typical , nice , pleasant , almost affectionate approach
but over time you became quite close to Justice Brennan .
did you have any , personal interactions or socializing outside the

I think I may have mentioned before that I was surprised when I
potter Stewart .
what was your impression of him ?
potter , of course , was one I really didn't know as well as I
he came out of Ohio , Cincinnati , Ohio ; had been elected to a
I think Potter worked hard , did very presentable work , but I
we'll put it that way .
it's sometimes reported that he was either considered or offered
there was that rumor at the time , and probably it was more than a
maybe he was considered , and in many respects it was a logical
I think certain segments of the media felt that this was coming
I remember when the announcement was made of Chief Justice Burger's
he had thought , this particular member , that it would go to
Stewart was on the Court , Burger wasn't , but Burger was on the
did you ever see in Justice Stewart any sign of second thoughts or
no , not in his personal attitudes or remarks at all .
he must have had some inner feelings , I suppose , if one really
I don't know whether that is a job that one should desire , but ,
what is your view about the wisdom of an associate justice being
you've seen it happen both ways .
certainly happens both ways .
I suppose one can make an argument in support of each .
I don't know where I come down .
I don't have any positive view one way or another .
it's probably just as well it gets mixed up once in a while .
surely , the elevation of one on the Court must be satisfying to
justice White , did you know him before ?
before I came to the court ?
yes , only because he was circuit justice for the Eighth Circuit
it seems to me he also had the Tenth , which was his home circuit .
to that extent , those of us out there in the Midwest received him
of course , he was still a football hero , which he did his best to
he wanted to be known for things other than being an All-American .
did he ever talk about his football days ?
yes , he talked a little bit about it and let it be known at
during your time on the Court with Justice White , some
did you see changes in your relationship over the course of the

nearly always we sat next to each other on the bench , and usually
I think we got along well together .

when you would get these tough dissents from him , would he ever

Byron White doesn't operate that way .
if there's a blow to it , he strikes a blow , and let the
but he always has that grin , and one never gets mad at Byron White
thurgood Marshall .
well , Thurgood , of course , was there , and it probably was not
I well remember the day his appointment was announced by President
I think , by and large , Justice Marshall was pleased to be on the
I think he felt somewhat burdened at carrying the responsibility
he was sensitive about things , He talked a good bit about , I
not problems , but very sad experiences , actually , that one
and he was in the middle of it , and I think , fearless in that
I always was thankful for having Thurgood Marshall on the Court
had you ever met him before you came to the Court ?
I don't recall that I ever had .
did you have many occasions to talk with him outside the conference
I would say probably no .
although , whenever we had Court dinners , seating is always
I felt I got to know <Mrs> Marshall and the Justice fairly
he was noted for his sense of humor .
did he use this effectively within the conference ?
he had a great ability when things got a little tense of telling an
where he had this great supply of appropriate stories , I do not
I never heard him tell the same story twice .
of course , some of us joked a little bit that he would excoriate
I wish I had had his storytelling ability .
a person of great experience with the human animal .
when was the first time that you joined everybody in your robes ?
do you remember that moment ?
the first time I joined everybody in my robe must have been the
I remember walking into the conference room , and there were these
names that any law student , or any lawyer in those days knew well
made me wonder what I was doing there .
they were very kind at the time , and made me feel welcome .
I don't know whether I was welcome , but they made me feel welcome
then we went into the courtroom , and one goes through the formal
the candidate always sits over on the end , in the John Marshall
the chief justice administers the oaths or only one of the other
if he isn't robed , he's robed at that time , but I remember I was
then you are led over to the junior chair , which is in the extreme
now a lot is said about the tradition of shaking hands when you
is this something which is done in a formal way ?
of course , that tradition was in force when I joined the Court .
always , when there's a gathering of justices , whether for a
I'm told it goes back to the days , about a hundred years ago ,
so he suggested the hand-shaking routine , and it worked pretty
I think it is a good way to greet each other and to realize that
we may disagree , but , as the old saying goes , we should disagree
it's routine as far as I'm concerned , a pleasant routine .
why is it that you came to the Court in June , <nineteen seventy>
why not wait until after the end of the term ?
that is what I expected to do and was hoping I could do because I
I must have had twelve or thirteen backed up anyway .
but , the chief justice called and see if I get this straight .
I think right after I was confirmed , but before I took the oath ,
I wasn't going to be able to do that work and finish up the Court
but anyway , the chief justice called and said , +"/.
+" I think it would be advisable for you to come to Washington .
+" why don't you come down here and be sworn in , and then we can
that vacancy had lasted for a year , and I think there were I
I think he wanted to clear up that backlog because those cases
he said , +"/.
+" it will take only a week or so .
+" come on down .
well , it turned out he was wrong on that .
I was there about five weeks before I was able to get away .
but that was the reason for my coming down .
did you bring your law clerks with you at that point ?
you know , I don't remember that .
I can't answer that question .
I probably did not .
but the argued cases were over for that term .
yes , indeed , as they are every year , the end of April .
so your first court business was in the conference ?
my first court business .
well , we sat on the bench , every Monday in those days , opinions
this was repeated time after time , and made it sound to me , if
that , of course , was appropriate because the cases they were
then we cleaned up , tried to anyway , those cases that were up for
I well remember the differences that existed at the time .
this is the case about the filing fee for divorces .
yes .
what were some of the differences that were going on ?
I'll put it this way , a great effort was made to get out a
but I can well recall , I think it was Harlan and Brennan walking
+" please go out and settle your difference if you can , and come
as you know , the Boddie case was not decided that term .
it went over again and was argued in the fall finally .
what was it like in the conference room as a junior justice ?
there are the little unimportant particulars , I suppose .
the junior justice always answers the door when there's a knock .
there's no one in the conference room , other than the nine , and
the table is set up so that the chief sits at one end , the senior
it seemed that that door was always being knocked upon , and I'd
it was always a note for Justice Douglas .
I think he had a routine that anything that came in to his chambers
it couldn't wait .
at the end of every conference , he would tear these notes up , and
there was always a little pile of paper underneath his seat .
of course , being a junior , sometimes you're in the middle of
as you know , the vote is taken by seniority , which means that as
in a sense that makes it easier because you can see , even in a
on the other hand , if the vote is four to four and it gets down to
so that there are both pluses and minuses , however one chooses to
the protocol used to be , or so it was reported , that the justices
that's the old tradition .
I suppose it must have been in effect at one time .
it was not during my stay in the Court .
we always voted the other way .
yet the docket sheets themselves are printed so that the junior is
which means , I'm sure , that at one time people voted by juniority
the theory being that then the seniors wouldn't influence too much
but , as I say , it was never that way during my time on the Court
what is the mode of presentation ?
would the justices give speeches , or was it more informal , or
during my time , and I can't say it still exists today , but the
+, and the chief will say the first case is “Jean <v@l>
chief Justice Burger always stated the facts , sometimes at great
all of us regarded our votes then as tentative .
we weren't stuck with that vote if we wanted to change our minds or
then he would turn to the senior associate , who was , in those
they would do the same thing , and it would go down by seniority .
and sometimes , entirely appropriate , someone would say , +"/.
+" well , for the reasons that Joe or Pete said , my vote is to
without saying anything more than that .
it all depended .
some of the justices liked to talk at greater length than others ,
but eventually we got through the case , the ninth vote was cast ,
+" well , the vote is six to three to affirm .
if he were in the minority , then he would say to the senior in the
+" Hugo , will you assign that case for writing .
at that time .
would justices ever argue during the conference or would they just
the argument was not very vociferous .
usually , they let each speak in turn .
once in a while , there were interruptions , but nothing violent or
were justices allowed to pass until everyone had spoken , or did
no .
one could pass if he wanted to .
I remember particularly in the Mitchell case , eighteen year-old
and then of course , when you pass , one votes at the end , he
I think he did that purposefully because it turned out he had the
why does one pass ?
I think once in a while , for example , if there's an antitrust
did you feel at any point that the passing was done deliberately to
I didn't get that impression .
of course , once in a while , one passes and doesn't vote at that
you say , I'll get my vote in before tomorrow noon , or something
but , deliberate disguising , I didn't get that impression .
how often would you find that you had come in prepared to vote one
+, not very often .
very seldom actually .
+, as the junior justice , did you have a good ability to predict
pretty well .
always on the bench when a case is being argued , in order to stay
usually you could tell , but not always .
do you remember any time when you were really surprised ?
not that I can put my finger on it right now .
of course , one can get misled by another justice's questioning
those questions can be a little misleading .
who are some of the justices who you had the most difficulty
I don't think I can name any , actually .
of course , in my day they didn't ask as many questions as they do
right now , they sometimes ask so many questions that counsel never
why do you think this is the case ?
I don't know .
I don't know whether justices want to make themselves aware of
I've noted sometimes where a justice is postured is an influence .
if he's on the side near the press box , he seems to ask more
what would be your objective in asking question ?
you were known as one of the quieter justices .
I usually asked when I was concerned about certain factual matters
that's the time to get facts straightened out if you are confused
on legal theory , I didn't ask too many questions because that ,
how did you set up your chambers to use your law clerks compared to
I didn't do very well at the start .
I could have used my clerks in the early days much better than I
when we had the list of cases that were to be argued , unless your
if one was interested in antitrust and wanted to work on an
I didn't say , +"/.
+" Joe you must do the preliminary memorandum in this .
I did indulge in memos , in what we call preliminary memos , which
some of the justices did not follow that custom .
it helped me a lot .
when did they start the cert pool ?
I think it was fairly early in my time .
I should remember , but I don't remember , who brought it up
before the pool was started , each of us was doing every case from
it occurred to a justice , I am sure , that there was a lot of
that would be six a piece in which to take the laboring oar and do
I think there was concern , I know there was on my part anyway ,
that was always the case .
now that you've retired , it seems that everybody is on the cert
or , I guess Justice Stevens is still +/.
+, as I understand , nearly everybody is .
it was easy to develop that way because I think Chief Justice

and so instead of having five , we had six , and we had seven , and
more or less .
