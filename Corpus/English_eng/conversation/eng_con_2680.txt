and it's definitely a rough draft like and there're spaces where we think that like &~st other stuff should go or like . 39215_45495
I just didn't I didn't know if we were like like in this part (0.4) I didn't know how to approach the movies and stuff that I've watched without it being like I like I did this I was trying to be like Wendy watched this but . 46575_65775

⌈ so I just ⌉ +/. 74865_76045

(0.6) oh okay I'll read this . 77525_84285
okay at the very end this jumps up into here . 84825_88525
this was mine I don't know if +//. 90025_91085
&-um we had like a really +//. 91505_93025
I got together with Rachel last night at the Fishbowl . 93185_95565
and &-um we were trying to like write it . 95625_99165
and we were trying to go about starting with like the &~l stuff from lit articles you know from articles and getting the stereotypes from that . 99505_107985
but like it was really hard (be)cause we ended up both reading the same article &-um and like I didn't think that the article had a_lot_of stereotypes per say . 108205_119725
like it just talked about it &-um &~e economic disadvantage in single mothers &-um and like that's about &~i you know like it didn't have a list of like a whole bunch of different stereotypes . 120275_134835
where &~m I mean there're some that we can think of just from what we know on basic knowledge but not from our particular article you know which was kinda hard . 135695_144835
so then we just ended up going through and seeing what we'd found in the media kind_of and just kind_of expand it and give examples &-um and like she looked up some more articles so hopefully we'll be able to find more stuff . 145225_162465
like I don't know it's gonna be hard or it'll be funny to see how like everyone else wrote theirs compared to everyone else and like you know (be)cause it most likely won't fit together +/. 162955_173475
yeah +/.
+, perfectly or something like that or like you know what we wrote might be totally different a totally different like scale or way that you guys wrote . 175455_183715
so I don't know how we wanted to put it together but I guess ⌈ if we have ⌉ . 184035_187355
⌊ but I ⌋ I think if each section like if we're basically in three sections I think if each section is written differently and maybe one or two people can oversee and +//. 187845_198385
(be)cause if you guys's summaries &~ac really helped me with the articles like I was able to highlight and then kinda put it into my own phrasing so that it all flowed together . 199145_208965
&-um I don't know if two people could maybe do that for the lit review if if we had like twenty pages available of summary &~f from all parts and they could just +/. 210065_221485
pick and choose +/.
+, pull together what was the best and +/. 223345_226125
+, yeah +/.
+, make it our paper .
+, I don't know .
so I don't know you guys can go through that I'll read this and see . 227845_237865
I mean can you guys &~ha like find it difficult to like start writing it ? 239265_244265
like to sit down and ⌈ like ⌉ . 244765_245705
⌊ I ⌋ I <I think> I think honestly I had a little bit of an advantage because (be)cause I had read everybody else's articles or their summaries at least and I had some ideas of other things that had been looked at in the article . 245745_261745
and so <I took> I took a ton in how I started writing about my movies and things that I wouldn't (ha)ve if I hadn't ha(ve) done that +/. 262355_270255
mhm +/.
+, and then I used like Rachel's article had a definition of what a successful relationship is and I thought that would be interesting to use because it just said relationship it didn't say marriage or anything so you could use it for child parent relationship or husband wife relationship +... 271325_291085
&-um and then there +//. 293805_297705
there was times when some of the stereotypes we had were like comparing it to moms you know which I don't know if that is gonna be like a separate section or you know how we're gonna put that all together . 297745_312125

like a &~c the stereotypes that we used and then we can go over your guys's . 2343925_2348125
can I see it actually ?
no .
we started out with a statistic on +//. 2358695_2360835
it says &{l=READING statistics show that one in five households are headed by a single parent and one in ten of those are headed by a single father . 2362455_2368595
and furthermore it has been found that more than half of all children will spend time even if only a small portion within a single parent home . 2370035_2376675
&}l=READING which is kind_of you know +/. 2377595_2379295
⌈ right ⌉ +/.

and like four of us were . 2386055_2387835
you know it's more common than people actually think . 2387835_2390795
you know which is a big stereotype . 2391455_2393815
&-um . 2395575_2397175
were you guys &~sta surprised at the ratio in our group of single parents to like me having married parents or +/. 2399675_2406875

you know . 2414555_2414675
I think (be)cause I've thought about it &-um . 2415215_2418575
like all your friends . 2419355_2419915
a_lot_of people I know <most people> even if their parents are together now it's like a remarriage . 2420055_2426175
uhuh +/.
+, like do &~y like three of my friends have like their parents but then before they were &~e born their like mom or dad had another +/. 2428095_2436915

I think it sucks . 2449735_2454035
&=laughs:S5 it's weird &=laughs like that four yeah . 2455415_2458555
&-um so the next thing that we talk about is how society assumes that fathers are less involved that was our nother &~s another stereotype . 2460295_2468255
&-um and we talk about like Disneyland dads and how when they do go see their &~k children it's like they're doing fun things and you know they don't necessarily aren't involved in the everyday activities that the moms have to deal with &-um . 2469515_2485915
that's that's like definitely in the stereotype like research so it's that +/. 2485995_2490135
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ they do ⌋ try to participate and they do try to help with homework a_lot_of times and they're no more or less likely than like nonresident mothers to to help with like homework and participate in daily lives . 2491525_2502925
and then we &-um show that how this is revealed in one of the articles and we talk about how like (be)cause in my article it says single fathers tend to worry about losing custody of their children and how in the media we'll always see like moms will get the custody like in a custody battle they'll always get sole custody . 2505425_2527305
and that shows how like at least we're arguing that it shows that you know society feels that men aren't able to take care of their children it's the woman's job . 2527985_2537165
&-um and then we go on to talk about it in Liar Liar &-um in Save the Last Dance Big Daddy +... 2538045_2548045
&-um (0.7) let's see here .
(0.4) and we talk about &-um +... 2560895_2564795
how we label that single parent fathers &-um need support from outside figures . 2566515_2574835
and that's related to society's views that men you know it's also related to the view that men can't handle kids and you <talk about> talk about Two of a Kind +... 2575055_2587835
and that was a &~r &-um I watched a really good episode the other day I it was like the episode where he first gets the nanny and he was gonna like he hired her but then he fired her (be)cause she seemed to +/. 2591615_2601835

we can talk about girl stuff with her boys clothes makeup blah blah blah . 2607715_2610975
and he realizes that like you know he needs her . 2611755_2614275

I think &-um maybe it's like the causes that we have like incorrect like the <use about> like for instance like the single fathers like the reason they were talking about them being less involved a_lot_o(f) times is because they just at first they don't know how to be involved in their kids lives like they haven't +/. 4689165_4706045

and so then because he's pretty much been the breadwinner and he's let her do that like he's let her just kinda control that area that like when it comes down to it he only knows like to do recreational things with the kids because that's all that that's all he knows . 4711625_4726125

yeah +/.
+, and I don't . 4755105_4758245
I think it's because society like applies that preconceived notion that dads won't be as good as a parent so like xxx almost always award custody to the mom instead . 4759025_4766205
I think with being less involved I think a_lot_o(f) times society assumes that the dad doesn't wanna be there . 4768445_4774885

(be)cause like in the movies I watched where the the wife died the father did a really good job as being like the single parent you know what I mean like he took over that role very well but when it was just when they were just divorced he still left a_lot_of things to the ⌊ mother to take care of ⌋ . 4785945_4798425
