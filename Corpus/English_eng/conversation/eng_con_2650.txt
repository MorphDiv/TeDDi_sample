&-um . 2255385_2255965
or I can work something out there . 2256385_2259825

&=pause_while_reading now here again you're making a assumption +... 2284665_2288625

so there's a problem with this analysis the way you're laying it out . 2353545_2358845
okay . 2359225_2359425
just jumping from this is what I see so this is what it must be +... 2359505_2363905
