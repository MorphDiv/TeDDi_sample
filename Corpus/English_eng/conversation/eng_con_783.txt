&~www .
okay there once was a boy called Andrew .
and he went out and bought a frog .
he also had a dog .
the dog really didn't like the frog very much .
so the dog was sniffing around the frog to find out new things
but that night the frog tried to escape , when Andrew was asleep .
<so the next morning> so the next morning , Andrew looked over
+< that's fine .
he looked everywhere for the frog and so did the dog .
they looked out the window .
and the dog fell out .
Andrew was very unhappy .
they went for a walk to the woods to look for the frog but couldn't
they looked in holes and beehives but could not find him there .
they looked in trees and could not find him there .
Andrew looked in a bush and instead of finding , a frog he found a
the deer chased him away .
and then he fell over a hill and into a pond .
the dog climbed on top of his head to get out_of the water .
Andrew told the dog to be very quiet .
and he looked over a trunk to find out if the frog was behind it .
and yes he was !
he had found a girlfriend and had lots_of babies .
so Andrew let him go away .
