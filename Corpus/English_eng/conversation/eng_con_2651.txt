the only batik@s:ind I have is this one here +/. 3535_6115
mhm +/.
+, and then I have a sarong and I brought another ikat@s:ind and this or we could make another appointment for Tuesday . 7575_16375
after class I have another class . 17315_18935
okay +/. 19215_19275
+, so I'll work with one of those and +/. 19595_21315
+, okay alright +/. 21315_22075
+, that's fine +/. 22255_22515
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ thank ⌋ you for bringing it in . 22835_23955
but &-um I'll wait until eleven . 24195_25775
&=laughs .
is that what +//. 26475_27015
yeah . 27135_27315
&-um oh Janet was going to be here at ten forty five . 28175_31455
okay .
(0.12) .
I know as soon as I sit down with this I'm gonna be like oh I didn't look at that . 32275_49075
&=laughs (0.6) .
so remember then <when you're> when you're looking at the weft ikat@s:ind they've tied and dyed the threads that they're weaving in . 55545_64085
this way this is a more difficult technique because you have the warp threads are all the same color . 64505_69585
and they would've hadta have strung up these weft threads on a different frame to tie and dye them to get these different . 70165_79005
think about the different color the different color variations with the colors have to go in at different times . 79375_85595
have you done any textile design ⌈ or ⌉ +/. 86135_88175
⌊ hm ⌋ +/.
+, or printing of any sort ? 88815_90275
see you have to lay in each color separately when you're doing this sort_of thing and then change where the resist is and then lay in the next color . 90575_100335
so this this particular color this &-um goldish beigish could either be possibly the raw silk but &~i &~i I I'll I'll I would bet that it's probably dyed as well . 101955_118615
but then it wouldn't ha(ve) been the first one . 119495_120775
+, ⌊ you either do ⌋ the dark first or the light first depending on the technique that they're +/. 121495_128955
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ going to ⌋ choose . 129115_129715
being that they have so much of the light and so little of the dark accent you're probably right . 130505_136845
(be)cause look where they laid the dark over doesn't it look like they laid it over the yellow and not &~v +/. 137605_143625
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ vice versa ⌋ ? 144645_145005
so that would mean that they did the tying and dyeing here . 145425_148425
but what is &~i interesting then is these darker rose parts here +/. 148965_155725
+, mhm +/.
+, aren't the same . 156485_157145
they look purposefully to to bring out this motif in contrast to these so there's there's obviously the artist is looking to create some more depth in the textile even though she's using a very similar color you have that change . 157765_176705
so there's a number of colors on here that were used for this motif . 177645_182725
and the motif is something you're gonna wanna ⌈ consider too ⌉ . 183305_185765
⌊ and then even within this ⌋ there's that darker . 185765_187825
mhm mhm that seems to sort_of go over where there was a yellow &~re you know a &~re . 188265_193745
when they do the dyeing though +/. 194145_196545
mhm ?
+, it's +//. 196965_198205
this is where I get confused are they putting the dye like on +//. 199605_204505
I mean if the &-uh waxed threads were somewhere else would they be putting the dye on or would they be dipping ? 204645_209705
it's dipping . 210145_210765
dipping okay . 210835_211355
⌈ so I assume yeah the knots ⌉ .
⌊ that's why you have to tie every single thread ⌋ and &~y look at the the the strength of these threads they're they're they're miniscule . 211795_220255
mm &=laughs (0.4) yeah I had enough trouble doing like those little loop pot holders . 220395_227295
&=laughs:multiple I can't even imagine this .

I might find this out from researching too but if it was common to do both the ikat@s:ind and the . 439835_443835
in Palambang it is now . 444075_446275
okay . 447135_447335
which is Palambang P A L L A M B A N G . 447955_454535
it's a city in East Sumatra . 454915_458015
remember that's the other place in Sumatra that does the songket@s:ind . 458675_463055
okay +/. 463055_463415
+, so the places that do songket@s:ind are Sumatra and &~a &-er Palambang area and Minangkabau which we looked at +/. 464315_472995
+, mhm +/.
+, and also Bali . 473115_474575
but what's interesting is they all do a form of ikat@s:ind too but where would they do weft ikat@s:ind alone with songket@s:ind ? 475695_484315
I have seen contemporary versions in Palambang . 484565_487605
so you wanna compare and contrast &-um motifs and &-um sizes that kind of thing colors of both Bali and and Sumatra to see if that &~l leads you anywhere . 490105_505485
mkay (0.5) .
so the books that deal with generally Indonesian textiles Sumatran textiles Balinese textiles are all over surveys of Southeast Asia and just float through and look for the Indonesian sections . 514705_528665
okay +/.
+, that'll that'll give you some clues . 529025_531505
okay . 532025_532345
and &~mos I mean do you think we'd be able to get enough out_of the stuff that's on reserve ? 532945_537985
or would we be going like way beyond that ? 538505_540745
&-um &~i it might help if you go beyond that but I would start in the reserves . 542105_546265
okay +/.
+, yeah for sure . 546705_548205
okay . 548645_548965
mkay ?
and you could I &~m remember if you do a MIRLYN search +/. 550205_553025

oh maybe not . 575665_576505

yeah but don't specify the ⌈ library ⌉ +/. 579185_581205

okay ? 586645_586845

and then what we have in the center field . 815365_817605
oh okay so now we have an ikat@s:ind . 818765_821285
mhm and then +/. 821285_822165
⌈ that's interesting ⌉ .
+, ⌊ <when you> when you look at an ikat@s:ind ⌋ are you thinking &-um what type of ikat@s:ind ? 822385_828665
so that's important to know . 828745_829925
is it warp ? 830065_830525
is it weft ? 830585_831205
is it double ? 831225_831885
well I can see that it's not double . 833085_835225
I am thinking +//. 835725_836425
okay I'm always confused with the &~w the warp and the weft . 836665_839225
mhm +/.

well now we know that songket@s:ind right ? 841785_844005
yes +/. 844365_844645

+, ⌈ okay okay ⌉ +/.

so the threads are being put in this way so that pretty much ⌈ tells you ⌉ . 849065_853085
⌊ so ⌋ that would be a weft ? 853345_854225
right . 854365_854645
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.

⌈ larger ⌉ ah: +/. 2411045_2411905

+, mhm +/.
+, and then you have what could this be ? 2423085_2426445
if you look on the back . 2427485_2428845
see how that is sort_of the mirror of the the reverse ? 2429285_2432505
so you have the dark on the light and here you have the light on the dark ? 2432925_2436905

+, so that would be your warp thread right ? 2463125_2466045
because here's your selvage here . 2466455_2467695
and then we have this seam so you have this band then sewn and woven here so it's &~a actually woven and what would you imagine this is ? 2469595_2481355
warp ?
&~fa .
right so here you have one warp band this way so this is a supplementary warp here . 2485415_2494575
and then you have the plain weave +/. 2495735_2497175
mhm +/.
+, and then you have the ikat@s:ind and then you have this checked weave +/. 2498195_2501975

+, and then you have ⌊ ikat@s:ind ⌋ . 2502955_2505415
+, ⌈ ikat@s:ind ⌉ ?
and then that ? 2505655_2506335
+, and then up to here and then you have a seam so you have one band of multiple techniques . 2506335_2511915
and on this band +//. 2512585_2513745
and see if you can figure out is this a supplementary warp ? 2515685_2520205
is it supplementary weft ? 2520445_2523165
is it &-uh tapestry ? 2523385_2526405
is it &-uh embroidery ? 2527045_2529425
you'll just have to study it now <and then> and then read a little bit up on the different techniques Timor is an island &~no known for its &-uh multitude for incorporating a multitude of techniques . 2532685_2545625
+, yeah +/.
+, in each of their pieces . 2546705_2547785
+, wow +/.
+, so the the closer you look at these the more you see . 2549385_2552525
+, yeah +/. 2553045_2553085
+, that went into them . 2553305_2554805
+, wow +/.
+, so you have then this banding +/. 2555665_2558245
+, is it +//.
and then +/. 2558645_2558865
+, this banding +/. 2559305_2559725
+, and its the same ⌊ it looks like ⌋ +/. 2560065_2561485
+, ⌈ and then you ⌉ have a duplicate . 2561485_2562425
and are they the same proportions on either side sometimes you can tell is there &~m meant to be one a waist band or or are they the same ? 2563525_2573705
it looks like this one is bigger . 2576325_2578005
mhm .
so you have a different scale . 2579665_2581045
but then the others do appear to be the same . 2582205_2584545
⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ the xxx ⌉ .
yeah . 2585425_2585625

⌈ what's interesting too ⌉ is this is a different height . 2598345_2604105
yeah (0.6) . 2605785_2605945
which is interesting . 2607885_2612185
so would that be where you think they rolled it ? 2612745_2615265
to leave room for ⌊ the roll ⌋ ? 2618445_2619305
⌈ I frankly ⌉ don't know how to explain that that's quite a bit of +/. 2619325_2622985

what +//. 2626285_2626465
&-uh &~i is the bottom like that ? 2626945_2627865
is it meeting at the seam ? 2629025_2630025
no the bottom also has a difference in it . 2630165_2632525
so +... 2633125_2635305
so this could be here you start out and as the weaver wove it got wider (be)cause they were pulling less hard on the selvage here in the weft threads and that was here and then as they came down to the end it got tighter so it became smaller again . 2640195_2662555
see how the this sort_of pulls in and curves ? 2663115_2666075
mhm +/.
+, so that means when she's manipulating the loom because it's just the simple back strapped hand loom and it will &~b and she probably wasn't really practiced at keeping the selvage +//. 2666985_2680185
there's certain things that you can do to keep that selvage even . 2680305_2683905
but that's a good way of telling that these two were actually in the same warp length . 2684785_2690525
so this probably matched this and then once you put on and cut ⌊ into two parts ⌋ . 2692305_2697845
⌈ so that's how ⌉ she would have to cut it down the middle ? 2697845_2700385
right . 2700625_2700905
so in other words she's she's weaving something like this right ? 2701305_2708125
mhm +/.
+, and as she's weaving because these these warp threads are are like strung on here +/. 2708345_2713885

&-um will give you a different width +/. 2729225_2732625
mhm +/.
+, slightly depending on how skilled the weaver is . 2733445_2736605
and then once she finished at this wide point she decided to cut it in half and then do this one banding and the other second banding . 2736985_2745265
so that's that would be my guess . 2747855_2749615
and then it that +//. 2750795_2751475

if it's ikatted@n$part you wouldn't be able to tell the difference in between the strings or would you ? 3094795_3099055
because I said I thought that this was initially but then looking at it closely it looks like there is blue thread actually stitched . 3099855_3107735
take a look on the other side and see what you see . 3108215_3110595
a_lot_of times what you need to do is consider both sides when you're talking about a woven item . 3111215_3116555

+, so that means you've got a primary you've got a technique that's primarily weft oriented and so weft patterning on the inside but is that what we see on the outside ? 3245715_3256155
(be)cause this is the outer face right ? 3256795_3258635
and the way &~w you could tell which is outside which is inside right ? 3259985_3263325

so we're looking at the inside then . 3276765_3278345
(0.5) .
see how the threads bunches are ending here ? 3279665_3286245

this would be considered the face of the cloth +/. 3303495_3305455

+, yeah +/.
+, I don't think you wanna go into this &=laughs:S4 <real> in detail . 3318445_3324785
I think you wanna focus on the larger issues of the fact that there's one two at least three types of weaving . 3325085_3336205
because &~u unless you're a weaver and want to spend pore over this for hours I have a feeling that would just consume all of your time +/. 3337205_3346525
+, mhm +/.
+, in trying to figure out the weaves and we really haven't &~s focused on weaves in class . 3346925_3352165
&-um &~i &~i it would take too much technical background and knowledge &~t to do that and it would take us away from the larger issue of personal adornment . 3352905_3361285
so I think you wanna see it as a multiwoven you know multitechnique woven textile . 3361745_3369785
and then look for people that utilized and you may learn more when you do the reading about these techniques and then you'll say oh that's what that was . 3370445_3380125
+, okay +/. 3380445_3380745

okay so okay . 3380995_3383475
that &=laughs ⌊ makes sense ⌋ . 3384135_3384695
⌈ I think +//.
⌉ <and then> and then looking at the motif &-um I can bring you a book to show you &-um what someone thinks about this particular motif . 3384875_3396735
&-um these motifs here these &~t obviously are the predominant two motifs that we have . 3397675_3404715
you might wanna focus on those . 3404915_3406435
and then just think about the coloration variation and the variation of weaves and see where that leads you . 3407665_3414345
okay (0.5) my little ruler just not doing its job . 3415565_3422085
but it's not a bad lesson to learn that the more you look the more you see and realize how complicated this was to assemble . 3422225_3431145
(be)cause at first glance . 3432145_3433765

I don't . 3459535_3460115
do you know <how to> how to start do you know how you wanna begin ? 3460935_3465875
not really &-um . 3467355_3470555
okay so look part one . 3470995_3472355
yeah formal analysis dimensions . 3472815_3475075
so here we have a long mural cloth +/. 3476235_3480455
mhm +/.
+, okay ?
we've got two ends and a center field . 3482055_3485735
and then you're gonna wanna say well let's see I mean think about it &~i have you had &~o other art history courses ? 3486815_3491575
mhm .
so you've looked at paintings . 3491935_3493655
yeah . 3494275_3494295
okay so think about it in &~t in those terms . 3494655_3497495
then what do the artists do ? 3497995_3499575
we have one particular technique here in the center field . 3500085_3503065
mhm .
I would say an ikat@s:ind .
and then you wanna decide is it warp or weft ikat@s:ind and then you have a songket@s:ind here and then you have this technique of crochet here and crochet is not local . 3504385_3517465
so this obviously came in in the colonial period . 3518265_3520565
mhm +/.
+, &-um and and so this is the the newest technique that's being introduced here . 3521665_3527025
and you can see how it's attached is it attached to with xxx original xxx and you wanna look at the motifs you wanna look at the scale how much songket@s:ind to ikat@s:ind do we have ? 3528005_3540785
can that tell me anything about how it was used ? 3541105_3544465
so when you start looking for similar textiles that've been published +/. 3544605_3548865
+, mhm +/.
+, photographs you wanna &~com wanna compare motif you wanna compare color you're gonna wanna &~com compare dimensions you're gonna wanna compare technique type to what you can find published to decide . 3549735_3564675
and I would send you in two directions you're gonna wanna look at Balinese textiles (be)cause the Balinese did the songket@s:ind and ikat@s:ind and that's &~cer that's where I bought this . 3565375_3576175
you're also gonna wanna look at East Sumatra Palambang P A L A M B A N G it's in East Sumatra . 3576305_3586785
and they also &-um have very contemporary pieces where they use that combination of ikat@s:ind and songket@s:ind . 3587645_3596165
but I'm not sure if they have the same kinds of dimensions colors you know xxx you can consider wear and tear on the piece does that tell you how it was folded ? 3596625_3626465
these these horrible little metal things are very picky and they xxx just xxx you wanna consider the dye colors &-um but you don't wanna get so swamped into details about how the piece was actually made that it takes you too far afield . 3606865_3632325
<we wanna> make a short research paper to cover these three +/. 3634265_3637345
+, ⌊ <critique it> .
mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ &-um parts okay ⌉ ? 3638785_3639465
so you wanna sort_of limit your description limit your ideas of of trying to figure out its provenance and and a little bit about its social content . 3639465_3649185
was it a dance cloth ? 3649905_3651185
was it a shoulder cloth ?
was it a wedding cloth ? 3651285_3654745
or a funeral cloth ?
that kind of idea . 3655025_3657005
okay ? 3657385_3657725
+, okay +/. 3657885_3658445
+, and then just sort of think of an angle you wanna compare it with another image of something else that's been published or &-um you see someone wearing something that's xxx <is that> is that your money ? 3658925_3675225
yeah . 3675585_3675885
okay . 3676085_3676325
so just holler if you have more questions . 3676705_3681885
okay . 3682385_3682625
(1.43) .
and this one looks different you would say it's not weft but warp because of it goes this way ? 3795895_3802095
well the warp is going this way right ? 3803095_3804675
yeah +/. 3804835_3804955
+, the long the +/. 3805235_3805835
+, ⌊ oh ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ long ⌉ way . 3806095_3806355
so &~s always you can tell the warp by looking for the selvage . 3806695_3810555
remember ? 3810895_3811855
so you have that weave where's my little +//. 3812115_3814595
you have the warp threads +/. 3814995_3816915
+, mhm +/.
+, and then you have the weft threads . 3817075_3818895
and as the weft is going back and forth it's creating its own &~t &-uh &~s finished end of the weaving . 3818935_3829195
whereas these seamed ends are raw edges you have like threads that hafta be hemmed over +/. 3829875_3836815
+, okay +/. 3837195_3837415
+, to keep them from fraying +/. 3837575_3838935
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ +/. 3839415_3839715
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ ? 3839995_3840215
so whenever you see a finished end that's telling you the side the weft side . 3840215_3845675
and so that it was moving this way . 3846415_3848755
+, okay +/.
+, and then you can tell something about the technique here by the way they laid in the colors . 3849955_3856015
each color wasn't dyed in it was the threads were already dyed &-um and then they were laid in in bundles . 3857075_3866055
so a type of songket@s:ind which is actually in Timor I believe called sungket@s:ind . 3866765_3876085
it's almost like a an embroidery but it's actually +/. 3876385_3878625
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ done ⌉ during the weave it's not you can see it's not done on top it's incorporated into the weave . 3879105_3884565
so they can do that ? 3884625_3885525
I didn't +//. 3885665_3885845
they can just put threads in for a block ? 3886005_3887705
mhm .
so when when she's weaving here &~y you have the weft and the warp and then she has extra little threads that she's weaving in and she's going <one green here> one green here one green here as she's weaving she's creating these patterns in incorporating them as she's weaving not laying them in on top later . 3889645_3911845
okay +/. 3912625_3912845
