people that um put the um the um thing and did more about diangle@c
+< or maybe like there isn't any like c@l c@l like c@l xxx like any
any command ? 14556_15456
+< yeah . 15456_15975
there's not a command to +/. 15975_17480
+< maybe they didn't xxx computer chip for that . 17480_20960
hmm it lets us do sideways flips it lets us do un up down
but +/. 27505_27956
it's letting you do everything you guys have been doing except for
+< except for diagonal . 33035_33211
maybe (be)cause they they the person that maybe the person +/. 33211_35891
+< they didn't think of one maybe . 35891_36421
maybe the person didn't xxx . 36421_38106
do you think that's possible that you thought of something that the
no . 42540_43108
but then the turtle went +... 43108_44725
+< maybe . 44725_45210
not but not the turtle we're not talking about Logo right now
you know the soft ware we used the other piece the geometry and
+< yeah . 57686_57687
+< oh . 57687_57931
that one . 57931_58685
we are using Logo to make quilt designs too but those are different
no . 65853_67371
mm no and um I don't know and I don't know a way to do it I don't
but +//. 79015_79215
so um diagonal turns is something we have to do a lot +/. 79215_86688
+< diagonal turns ? 86688_87230
diagonal flips sorry you caught me again . 87230_89250
but did don't they let you do flips on the thing ? 89250_92420
on Logo ? 92420_93068
um no on +/. 93068_94553
yeah up down flips and sideways flips but not diagonal flips . 94553_98755
+< but did they if they let you do flips why don't they let
good question I don't know the answer . 104343_105780
I don't know . 105780_107078
I don't think professor Leher knows the answer either . 107078_108828
he was in here yesterday watching you and looking and listening to
+^ that makes sense to you but for some reason it may it must
so we need to do a lot more talking and thinking about diagonal
+^ if we can figure out enough about diagonal flips we can tell
professor Leher and I both know people who helped develop that
we were working with them a long while while they developed it they
but what I see you guys figuring out is you'd like it better if it
true . 173781_174513
but it was very hard to talk about diagonal flips wasn't it ? 174513_179741
it's very hard to make someone else understand the idea of diagonal
I mean ah to &~tech to repeat a diagonal flip that you made and then
+^ Justin couldn't do it alone and Nicole couldn't do it alone but
so we have to do more thinking about that . 210486_212276
+^ after recess today when we go back to working on our quilt
not to glue pieces down again but to do what you just helped me do
and then we're gonna be testing what you write down . 246628_249516
we're gonna use your core squares to test and see if
cool ! 258486_259620
when we test we won't be looking at your design . 259620_262056
we'll be using your four core squares to do what you said to do . 262056_266960
what you guys said to do first is to take the core square and to
but which way though ? 273848_276400
it said turn right one half . 276400_278291
+< take the bottom corner flip it up to the top left corner xxx . 278291_279251
+< okay then hold on I need +//. 279251_281606
+< excuse me Amanda I need some tape . 281606_284098
wait for here . 284098_286408
up down flip . 286408_287808
I need to start +//. 287808_288443
+^ maybe we made a mistake . 288443_289853
here's the beginning core square I looked at my x@l I need to do an
looks good to me so far but remember if I was really testing one of
hmm . 306523_309156
it showed you to do a side do a do a up down flip with it
+< it fell . 315865_316100
+< yep it did it all on its own . 316100_317181
okay core square and I'm gonna try to do the piece
okay . 323500_325495
alright . 325495_326595
okay but if you were testing my work or if I was testing someone's
no . 334990_335716
no I'm not gonna know until they show me their
and for the last one oh easy one copy the core . 338751_342780
+< copy core . 342780_343080
all I have to do is slide that one into place . 343080_345481
alright so if I'm the tester and these are the directions that the
are we doing this with buddies ? 357573_358461
uh when you get to the testing part you'll have lots of different
yeah but we had done a lot of thinking we had done that together
(ex)cuse me Amanda . 384695_385481
your design . 385481_386083
+< they really did turn out for yours . 386083_387565
yeah they did but you'll have to watch the tester too (be)cause if
+< sideways . 399661_400078
so you'll have to be watching and working with that other person . 400078_402396
Kelly . 402396_403033
I was just stretching . 403033_404598
just stretching ? 404598_405121
well it's a great time for all of us to stretch (be)cause it'
