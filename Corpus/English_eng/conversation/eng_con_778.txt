&~www .
&-er yesterday a boy obviously bought a frog .
and he was admiring it for ages in a jar with his dog .
but then he went to sleep at night and when he woke up the next
uhhuh .
he was looking everywhere with his dog for the frog .
but he still couldn't find it .
the dog and him went to the window to look outside and search for
and the dog fell out .
he jumped out to help the dog away from the glass .
and they continued to search into the forest .
they looked everywhere in the forest again but still couldn't find
they looked in a little hole with a mole or something in it .
and they continued to search .
but there was no luck .
they still couldn't find the dog .
the dog then got chased away by a swarm of bees .
and the boy fell out_of a tree .
he ran to a rock where he saw an owl in the tree .
but he still looked around and couldn't find his frog .
he leaned over the rock and fell in a deer's antlers .
the deer took him over a cliff face and dropped him into a puddle
the boy and the dog then got up and walked to the ledge .
he told him to be quiet , as they peered over into a little crevice
they saw his frog and another frog who were obviously in love .
he jumped over the tree and saw lots_of baby frogs .
he waved goodbye to the frogs and took a baby frog with him .
