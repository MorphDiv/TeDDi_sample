a little bit of time to get that whole thumb out but worth how many
did you . 4740_4990
oh my goodness . 5540_6030
that's what you find out . 9100_9830
that's okay . 9980_10500
that's fine . 10520_10900
I don't mind to fold . 11040_11630
that's really neat . 12300_12940
now did you just no you didn't . 12980_14440
copy it each time . 14790_15560
fold . 16190_16430
it . 16480_16820
where were you thinking .
can I put these these perk . 18780_20940
wouldn't be symmetrical . 21510_22640
and these perks . 22980_23840
are . 24760_25670
okay . 24790_24970
how do you know that where . 25080_25750
where are you thinking about folding it to see that and this that .
so if you fold it this way up and down . 31020_33100
you're . 34540_34690
saying that this way . 34800_35290
way which way . 36460_36980
this . 38200_38310
way . 38400_38560
no that that's not . 38660_39510
a copy sideways a sideways . 39560_41040
so if I use here and fold it sideways or say it won't match . 42620_45830
what_about if I do it open down . 46230_47510
okay . 49350_49500
thanks for showing me . 49520_50260
quote one . 50380_50660
you can go out and go back to quilt . 50680_52140
two won't match . 52280_53820
then . 53840_54030
oh wait . 54190_54340
you won't let go out the door . 54360_55600
actually .
well now you'll just that's okay . 56240_57900
just explore . 57920_58420
and then say you wanna open a file 'cause you'll open a quilt too .
and go back to work on it . 61080_61940
okay . 61960_62110
okay . 62310_62580
great . 62960_63260
oh this thing would have nothing to match . 63500_66180
uhhuh . 66210_66510
because you could just cut off that . 66560_68940
uhhuh . 69170_69260
cut off these two right here . 69870_72060
and you fold it . 72820_73590
and this part right here is symmetrical . 73660_76460
I'm looking forward to what you . 83380_84390
you . 95550_95610
sure . 95680_96030
I don't know . 97520_97850
okay . 102840_103020
are we ready . 103040_103470
not yet . 103580_104080
alright . 104260_104430
I was sequence what . 105240_110540
&-uh well let . 123620_124260
okay . 126110_126230
yeah . 126280_126410
great . 126480_126620
go high on him if you want to move your shoulder . 127300_129220
and &-uh we're rolling . 130229_131660
okay . 131900_132020
okay . 132350_132590
Carmen &-um what where are we at on the now and what . 133280_137270
we are wrapping up . 138120_140030
we are culminating &-um more quickly than we would be . 140420_143550
probably . 143920_144100
&-um if winter break to start . 144610_146250
but all of the things that depend on talk about actual quilt
finishing actual clothing projects . 151310_152990
we're trying to finish up . 153590_154430
now we'll come back to ideas like area and perimeter and
and just count on them to have that background of experiences . 158770_161940
but we needed to finish their final quilt designs . 162060_164770
&-um so they worked in groups of three . 165220_166660
and &-um first each child designed &-um their culminating two by
they made their own course wearing and planted two by two design
and then each team had to choose between the three two by twos that
so what they were doing today is piecing their nine two by twos
I see like here we've got the standard &-um triangles . 199200_203190
but now in this one split one these triangle . 203500_206630
mhm . 206900_207270
in half there's a rather complex square as a result . 207460_211390
whereas over here . 212110_212580
square size . 212860_213450
oh a quarter size square . 214360_215210
that's even more complex . 215420_216480
okay . 217830_218070
oh wow . 218270_218470
and the very smallest . 220580_221510
yeah that has it doesn't a rectangle . 221820_223740
but it has the other shade that one is rectangle in the squares
so this would be a simpler . 228240_229030
mhm . 229420_229560
and actually it for that reason the other people in that group had
and the group members looked at those just way . 243780_246700
and they decided what . 247080_249480
do you think the kids have learned about symmetry design . 250000_255630
a_lot_of that has been coming up . 257760_259029
and we did some talking about symmetry based on their course . 259079_262040
we haven't really come back to that . 262530_263940
I mean we've been doing some art projects where I've been
but today each of the groups almost they were able to identify lens
whether it was zero or one or two or four . 276440_278620
uhhuh . 278990_279070
&-um and then they were able to explain very clearly what that
they didn't just say . 283320_284020
yes it's symmetrical or . 284040_284910
mhm . 285280_285430
it's symmetrical like this . 285560_286900
they by folding or they could point out this woman took with this .
this woman took with this . 290600_291580
mhm . 291640_291840
&-um they were very clear about that . 292040_294460
so <that was> that was good . 294740_296020
they were putting &-um putting that to use . 296040_298670
I see the nutcrackers on the board . 299080_300510
here is that &-uh thinking about the nutcracker been integrated
well not with the quilts . 305550_306500
but it was talking more about that word symmetrical when . 306520_308820
sent me . 309080_309380
oh so so symmetry came up . 309400_310510
and that was &-um much more challenging than you would think
and how will I make this symmetrical . 315160_316770
uhhuh . 317260_317350
was hard . 317540_318260
some kids did over a dozen tries of trying to fold paper and cut
well that's &-uh what do you think makes that . 326110_328670
core . 328720_330150
&-um it well just thinking about half of something . 329460_334870
and then trying to visualize what one half of it looks like . 335430_338060
so that when you open it out it gives you the whole that you have
&-um and then distinguishing between the two different ways to make
whether do I have to . 347160_347900
these two pieces are opposite parts . 348190_349900
but they need to match . 350090_350790
I'll cut them together . 350910_351820
so they match . 351940_352410
or this is one item that needs to be symmetrical . 352660_355760
so I need to cut on fold that . 355920_357470
cutting on the fold by second grade . 357590_360100
even if you would've <is not> is not there for some kids . 360150_362950
that's very very difficult . 363140_364210
Alex has struggling and has struggled . 364590_366740
and for others it makes perfect sense . 366860_369140
who's an example of someone who doesn't struggle . 369330_370980
the perfect . 371860_372120
sense . 372240_372430
&-um Katie had no problem . 372860_375100
Vanessa kids whose whose drawings are very detailed . 375310_378810
so anyway I've done a_lot_of those art projects and stuff . 379050_381940
I've really had their hands on that a lot you know not just cutting
that whole range of experimenting with those things . 386880_389670
and Alex and some other people <have not> have not had that . 389820_395500
I noticed that they really had produced quite a bit on the computer
mhm . 399720_399880
mhm . 400000_400170
well what was your impression of that . 400390_402160
utility of that . 402510_403230
&-um I think they they sat down even kids who have struggled
for example Brian sat down and with very little guidance we're able
he could use that to get into the designs he wanted . 420100_422090
no there was some trial and error . 422260_423430
some guessing stuff . 423660_424430
especially &-um the first time he worked he was confused by the
mhm . 429360_429540
we had only talked about turns . 429900_430820
so for a minute he thought it was doing something that he hadn't
but once he recognized that when it says rotate right or rotate
that was what he had been doing with the turns that made more sense
and he was actually predicting and planning before he &-um you
he knew what he wanted . 452300_453100
he wasn't just none of my kids sat down and just played and got
okay that's done . 457760_458430
now some of them have called designs finished that . 458840_461120
they could have spent a lot more time designing or tv here to make
but they they're thinking through <the whole> the whole process
so I was amazed at how well I wasn't amazed . 469940_472900
I expected that . 473080_473890
how easily they just sat down and knew what to do . 474420_477270
sorry . 478730_478850
&-uh what the computer does . 479140_480320
yeah . 481120_481310
I was gonna get to that . 481440_482310
okay . 482470_482610
so &-um the question in can I hold . 483360_485550
it lemme go ahead . 485600_486030
judge tape . 486200_486620
I'm just gonna ask you about what's the computer .
good for . 490670_491080
my kids want . 498100_498700
maybe you could also class say . 504660_506050
oh that would be so cool . 520720_521419
if just like on the back of our quilt belly . 521669_523140
there's just a little graphic up there that said . 523159_525350
rotate right right or copy . 525850_528470
rotate left before copy . 529540_531240
okay . 532150_532270
we'll make this . 532320_532830
okay . 533830_534030
so &-um so &-uh Carmen we were talking about the &-uh computers . 534570_539110
what what do you you just mentioned . 539350_540700
it's a design tool . 540720_541590
mhm . 541640_541910
and I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more . 542130_543980
what do you mean by that that it's a design tool . 544000_545750
what's it . 545960_546210
good for . 546320_546620
and . 546860_547010
&-uh okay . 547390_547710
so we haven't used it in a way like drill and practice . 547900_550030
I didn't use the computer to teach my kids the difference between a
I didn't use the computer &-um to teach them what a four square was
but we went through all of those activities offline &-um . 563090_566430
