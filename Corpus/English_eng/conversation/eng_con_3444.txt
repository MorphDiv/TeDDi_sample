one night a boy was watching his frog .
and then the boy went to bed .
and when the boy was fast asleep the frog escaped from his jar .
and in the morning the boy woke up .
and he found the frog was gone .
and then so the dog and him looked everywhere .
and the dog looks in the jar .
and his head gets stuck .
so then the boy pulls the window down and calls for his frog .
and the dog falls out_of the window and breaks the jar .
<then they go down the road> and then they go down the road
the boy looks in a hole while the dog barks at some bees .
while the dog is still barking at the <bee> bees the boy
the boy goes up in the tree and looks in a hole .
and the dog knocks down the bee hive .
the boy gets pushed out by an owl .
<and the dog> and the bees are chasing the dog .
the boy got up on a rock to get away from the owl .
and he hangs on to <a> a tree branch which is a deer's antler .
and the deer runs with the boy on his head and stops suddenly .
and the boy falls off with his dog into a swamp .
luckily the swamp isn't very deep .
and there's a log nearby .
so the boy tells the dog to be very quiet .
they climb on a log .
and they see his frog with another frog and baby frogs .
and they take one of the baby frogs .
and they wave goodbye .
the they're feeling kind of sad because they lost their frog .
<and the boy is saying> he's calling out to his frog come back
and the &-um +...
what was the other question ?
why things happen ?
the frog went away because he didn't like his home in the jar .
one night the boy and the dog feel happy because they were glad
and the boy is saying to himself oh I am sure glad I have a frog .
and no one else does .
and then they go to sleep .
and the boy is thinking that the frog likes his new home .
and the frog climbs out_of the jar to go exploring .
and I forget the other question .
www .
oh yeah I said that .
cause the frog wanted to go for an adventure and go exploring .
so the next morning the boy wakes up .
and he feels sad because he lost his frog .
and he says to his dog why would a frog go out_of a jar ?
and they +...
now why did this happen +...
it's gonna take me a long time to get through this book !
www .
okay so the boy calls for his frog while the boy has his fingers
and they are doing this to find the frog .
and the frog is not anywhere in the room .
so they open the window .
and he calls out to his frog .
and they think he would be somewhere in their garden .
and <the> the boy thinks that he'll find his frog around
and while he was saying that the dog tripped .
and he went falling to the ground and broke the jar .
and the boy was very mad .
and he said to the dog you better not break another jar in your
and so they went out searching .
they went all around the house .
and then the boy thought well maybe the frog went exploring .
and so he thinks that he would be in the forest .
so they go to the forest .
and the boy thinks that frogs are small .
so they might go in this little hole he finds .
xxx .
and he's calling down the hole for his frog to come out .
but when something comes out he says you're not my frog !
go back down there !
and why does he have his hands on his nose ?
because he doesn't like the smell .
and he thinks he sees another hole in the tree .
so he thinks he might be in there .
so he's calling to his frog while he thinks that his dog will be
and then the boy gets pushed out .
and he says to the owl it's very rude to push people out_of a tree
and when he sees the dog being chased by the bees he thinks <that
and why is the dog running away so quickly ?
because the bees are chasing it .
and because he said you that shouldn't knock &-um people out_of the
and he <ducks> thinks that if he ducks behind the rock the owl
so he does that .
and then when the owl's gone he climbs on top of the rock and calls
and he thinks that a deer's antlers <are> are a birch branch .
<so he hangs> so he holds on to them .
so he won't fall off the rock .
but the deer felt someone's hands on his antlers .
so he lifts up his head and the boy goes on his head .
I wonder how the boy feels now .
and <he> the boy feels very very mad .
and he says to the deer that is very rude to lift people on
so and the deer didn't like that phrase .
so he went charging trying to get <the kid> the boy off .
but then when he came to a cliff he stopped .
and the boy says thank you for letting me off .
but I don't wanna get off here !
and he falls off the deer .
and he says to himself oh_boy I better not land in the pond !
oh my gosh !
so how did that happen ?
the deer stopped suddenly .
it was cause he didn't wanna fall in the river .
and then they fall in the river back first .
and the dog falls on the boy .
and <he says to the deer> the deer says to him what a nice
and the boy says to the deer you better get me out_of this .
or I'll sue you !
and <he> he picks up his head out_of the water because he hears
and he listens for a while .
and the dog hears it too .
so why is he holding his hand up to his ear ?
because he hasta +...
because he's listening to something .
and then he hears a frog .
he says maybe that's my frog .
so they hear it from the log .
and the boy says to the dog be quiet cause if you don't be quiet
so the <dogs be> so the dog bes quiet .
and they climb over the log .
and they say ah one of my frogs .
but those aren't my frogs .
there's so many .
I only had one .
but then he notices his .
and then all the baby frogs come out .
and he says oh_boy I'm gonna take all of them .
they're all of them by my frog .
how does he feel ?
he felt happy because he said I could take home all the frogs .
but then he said to himself but if I take home all of the frogs I
so he only took &-um &-um away one being happy that he had a frog
and he waved goodbye
