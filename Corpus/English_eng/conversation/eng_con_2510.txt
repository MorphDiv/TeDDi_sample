he says he's reluctant . 121670_123050
he's reluctant to &-um to say at this point . 123180_126470

another lawyer . 169510_169810
it looks like tomorrow . 171160_172060
&-uh now &-uh . 173450_174770
all you got to today was Laro . 177020_178290
right now . 179950_180460
&-uh the &-um all additional information from you . 181140_186700
Larue said he had &-uh that he said that he had told Mitchell that
yes . 191340_191370
when did he do that . 191840_192260
you recently . 192380_193030
just recently . 193990_194340
mhm . 194360_194530
today yesterday . 194840_195350
before I see . 196140_197270
it thrown in the sponge . 198630_199820
I get it . 200320_200680
&-uh now &-uh we talked earlier today about about Ehrlichman
&-um a little additional detail on that . 209020_211900
mhm . 211940_212300
&-uh confessed to Dean on June nineteenth . 212740_216540
June The nineteenth . 217430_218090
&-uh June &-uh Dean then told Erlichman . 218820_221750
that he confessed that he what the deal or what &-uh . 225170_228420
that he was present in the Watergate . 228440_229980
mhm . 230020_230190
&-um then you also asked about Colson Colson &-uh and Dean &-uh
and thereafter . 244990_245830
Colson was there . 246380_247140
Colson was there . 247670_248140
so he's gonna be in the grand jury . 248410_249480
mhm &-uh with respect to to Hall in another matter &-uh in
yeah . 264000_264140
after after &-uh fact June seventeenth Mitchell Dean to
&-uh Dean felt like he didn't have that authority . 275980_279540
and he went to Haldeman mhm Haldeman gave him the authority . 279620_283460
mhm . 283660_283910
he then got in touch with Combat to arrange for money . 284160_287720
the details of which we really don't know it yet . 288300_290830
right . 291100_291260
so combat is also a grand jury witness to be called . 291510_296700
&-uh and I think those are the only additional departments . 298860_302370
right . 302480_302640
what is your situation with regard to the negotiation with Dean and
well &-uh the the &-um . 311530_312740
trying to get the trying to get the timing you see with regard to
Der's lawyers are still waiting to get back to us . 318240_320030
I see . 320710_320820
&-uh they're very much concerned about Judge Sarika and &-uh
or do they want ironed out that &-uh that . 338700_340400
he won't go to jail before the rest of them . 341660_343150
oh . 344230_344300
I see &-uh if he confesses that's . 344890_347030
right . 347160_347370
&-um that's you know pending on on meeting with Judge Rick . 348340_354580
but you've gotta have I suppose . 355180_356230
probably Titus nosing better than any of us . 357970_359630
sure . 360370_360460
probably Titus will handle that aspect . 360880_362540
of it . 362560_362740
mhm . 362800_363140
but that's gotta be very done . 364150_366500
he has he's got to blast us all publicly . 366580_368660
oh cka . 370380_370940
right . 371000_371110
&-uh then &-uh you know we'll see they will pick up the some urban
that doesn't seem to be the major issue . 380150_381870
though . 381920_382100
probably I can see that the main thing is Sarka he's concerned
well that's right . 385080_385540
sure . 385800_385980
(be)cause &-uh urban thing will become moot in my opinion . 386300_388140
now . 388500_388670
the other concern we have on that issue is &-uh you know how we
charge of . 393980_394520
in terms of &-uh &-uh in terms of the prejudicial publicity and
&-uh one of the things that concerning us is we don't feel like we
is unindicted co-conspirators at this point . 410900_412980
&-uh but we're afraid not to you know if we don't . 413890_416620
and it gets out you know it's gonna look like a big cover up again
mm . 419780_419790
&-uh so we're we're trying to wrestle our way through that &-uh
it's whether you indict &-uh Haldeman and &-uh Erman along with the
well we'd name them at this point only as unindicted
so you've gotta make a determination as_to what secondary . 440460_442540
issue is of_course we're gonna have enough corroboration to make
statement would be made &-uh as I understand it . 447640_450980
if &-uh you were telling me if &-uh . 451040_453730
open court . 456280_456700
you made an open court . 457520_458180
and you and then you would make a statement that the others . 458200_460380
you'd name them at that time . 460530_461700
well . 461950_462220
we no we wouldn't do it in those terms . 462260_463940
we'd simply &-uh do it in terms of stating the facts to the court .
that would be done publicly . 469470_470620
would you name Mitchell then too well would . 470640_472370
have to . 472480_472780
you see that would all the . 473430_474110
problem is . 474320_474710
it'd all be done in open court . 474950_476100
that's . 476260_476590
right . 476680_476780
once we do that &-uh or even if we don't &-uh s have it in custom .
and he is certainly gonna do it in this case . 482170_483580
harrogate the defendant himself . 484870_486370
right . 486850_487100
and if he the . 487630_488190
defendant who pleads guilty . 488480_489260
that's right . 489540_490060
if he interrogates Mcgruder and brings out the Ehrlichman Hamman
and we haven't mentioned them or included them in the conspiracy
right then . 500490_501520
we're all gonna have a black eye . 501830_502940
I get your point . 503320_503830
so . 504340_504510
these are the things we're trying to work out . 504860_506300
you've got quite a plateful . 508260_509260
you probably won't get it tomorrow then will you . 509280_510870
I doubt it . 511390_511810
I doubt it . 512320_512539
mhm . 513000_513220
and &-uh what_about Dean now in his case you've &-uh still
huh . 518539_518659
well . 518890_519070
we're still tying down facts with him . 519120_520940
we want to get as much as we can . 521270_522510
&-uh . 523659_523669
and basically with him you're the point is you've gotta get enough
right . 530280_530450
to make the decision . 531020_531780
yes sir . 531900_532300
depends on how much he tells you you is that it . 534030_535390
correct . 536200_536340
and and how much of it more than that . 536520_537910
how much of it we can corroborate . 538020_539340
if he can't corroborate enough then he doesn't get off . 542020_544060
is that it . 544080_544540
well . 544940_545140
if we can't corroborate it &-uh that's right we can't very well
and put him head to head against the witness who's gonna beat him .
I see . 553270_553580
well his people are playing it . 555260_556300
&-uh pretty tough with you then . 556510_557540
yes sir . 557700_558070
I guess we do that too . 558880_559820
I suppose . 560000_560200
indeed so . 560460_561010
prefer them to do that . 561980_562780
let me see if I get the &-uh facts in &-uh you'll hear strong
yes . 568660_568760
we expect you'll be in . 569290_569940
mhm . 569980_570290
come in with his lawyer . 571020_571660
again . 571720_571910
&-uh second point is that &-uh that &-uh that &-uh let me see about
dean says that . 580870_581900
&-uh no . 582210_582380
or . 582400_582540
on the nineteenth . 583800_584350
yeah . 584550_584610
that Liddy confessed to dean . 584950_586330
Dean says that . 588110_588540
Dean says that . 589140_589750
we confessed to him . 590540_591300
and that he told Erlichman that . 591420_592780
he told Erlich . 592800_593430
mhm . 596320_596540
well that's a new fact isn't it . 598370_599580
&-uh it's at_least yes sir . 599900_601860
mhm . 601900_602060
and &-uh &-uh . 602540_603980
that's . 606620_607020
a terribly important fact . 607150_608370
I think . 608650_609060
no disclosure made by either one of them . 610000_611660
either Dean or &-uh . 613890_615030
yes sir . 616060_616400
did Dean say this . 619380_620070
Dean . 622750_622820
told me this evening . 623230_624060
what . 624760_624870
I'm not quite sure when Dean said it . 625410_627570
&-uh yeah Dean . 627870_628220
you see the point is <Dean didn't> Dean didn't tell me that
well Mr President you have to remember that that we're
I see it's very difficult you know to get it all in . 640000_642260
I know I'm not talking about you but I'm talking about what he
you see . 645860_646110
yeah . 646450_646550
that's a key fact that he should have told me . 647550_648980
isn't it . 649000_649320
yes . 650620_650790
mhm . 653280_653430
and let's see the . 657000_657590
let's see . 657720_657990
that's the nineteenth . 658040_659470
and . 660940_661030
&-uh on the &-uh Haldeman thing . 661560_664480
which you have there again . 664560_665430
so I get that in my mind . 665560_666460
lemme get back over my notes . 669500_670460
&-uh a principal thing that I wanted to point out to you on
oh yes . 678160_678300
yes . 678400_678430
yes . 678560_678670
that was it . 678720_679080
after when Mitchell Mitchell told him to go to Haldeman . 680590_682620
Mitchell told Dean simply to activate combat to handle the money .
I see &-uh . 687640_688380
Dean then went to Haldeman Authority to combat &-uh to contact
now the details on the three hundred fifty thousand dollars which
I knew about the fund . 705670_706470
I don't know . 706640_706910
I don't know how it all went developed . 707280_708360
see . 709010_709070
you haven't got that that . 709300_710260
is related to Us as money over which Haldeman exercise control that
the portion of it . 721260_722220
some of it . 723180_723500
right . 723520_723670
<I think> I think Haldeman would &-uh would say . 726170_728060
that's true . 728230_728450
mhm . 728740_728960
I think he would . 730920_731380
I mean I don't know but we'll see . 731570_732750
you could you should ask I guess . 733550_735140
come back . 735300_735500
well the . 735520_735750
point of it is it went to Larou instead_of going to the committee
mhm . 739560_739740
and Haldeman &-uh and Lare &-uh &-uh apparently did not give a
mhm . 746420_746790
Haldeman had requested it . 747260_748260
mhm . 748780_748990
I think the &-uh bit that the the rule was the &-uh was a
I think that was the point that &-uh called him . 761040_763570
the buttock . 764160_764410
said . 764480_764590
who this money go to . 764780_765300
and he said . 765320_765580
I went to the rule . 765600_766000
the rule was a member of the committee or something like that &-uh
I dunno . 769680_769950
what that is . 770050_770300
is that . 770580_770870
correct . 770920_771120
or do you know that I . 771270_772200
don't know that . 772280_772620
all I know . 773020_773280
is . 773440_774880
he works for John Mitchell I'll check on that though . 773900_776950
went to Mitchell . 777260_777820
I say . 779040_779260
all I know is worked for Mitchell . 779280_780650
I think he yeah I think he was &-uh <worked for> worked for the
but I don't know . 786040_786390
you you ought_to check that out . 786440_787620
I will . 787800_788010
okay . 789630_789780
then the main thing I need of_course is &-uh thing on the &-um . 789800_793620
well before you wait you're not gonna have anything tomorrow and
so I don't . 796980_797450
I don't think so . 799070_799500
have to just tomorrow just continue to develop the evidence . 800060_802020
yes sir . 802220_802460
not think therefore no statement would be an order at the present
we against one . 807860_809580
today it just didn't seem to be I thought it would &-uh it might I
I thought it would jeopardize possibly the prosecution . 816120_819340
you know who knows well . 819360_820420
more questions in advance . 821360_822260
that's right . 822280_822740
