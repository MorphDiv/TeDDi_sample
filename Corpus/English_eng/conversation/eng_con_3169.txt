what we're going to do today, is to try to make, .
those units of measure you were using, .
and by the end of the day, .
you were all using them very skillfully, .
they were making sense to you, .
and you were getting very accurate measurements .
but, I don't think the way we were measuring .
is exactly the way most people measure .
in the everyday world .
do you see carpenters walking around, .
and they're wearing the toolbelts, and right next to them, .
oh yeah, my little bag of inches .
and when they want to measure something they pull out .
their little inches and they lay them down ?
and then when they're done measuring, .
+" Oh, yup, I wanted that board eighteen inches long .
yup, eighteen inches .
And they mark with a pencil, .
scoop those inches up, .
and tuck them back in their tool belt .
no .
they use a, um, they use a, um, ruler .
okay, they might use a ruler .
what else might they use ?
um, a tape measure .
a tape measure ?
well, could they use a ruler also ?
yeah .
yeah, Vanessa ?
a yardstick .
they might use a yardstick .
why do they use a ruler, a tape measure or a yardstick .
instead of, like we were doing, .
we were getting very accurate measurements .
we each had our little unit of measurement .
why don't they just carry around .
a little, ah, pocket of inches ?
you know they could lay them out just like you did .
if they don't use a, um, ruler, .
they have to keep on laying them out, .
and um, if they don't have enough of them, .
then you put them over and over and over .
right, now that strategy was successful .
it made sense .
if you ran out of units, .
you went back and you got the ones behind it, .
and you kept putting them ahead .
but, do you think that was the fastest way to measure ?
what makes this better, .
than having a pocketful of inches here ?
I want to know why people use something like this, .
instead of the things I gave you last week .
it's easier ?
why is it easier ?
sara said one reason it is easier .
is because they are all connected together .
do you think .
it would have been easier for you to measure, .
kevin, if your Kevins were all connected together ?
yeah, it would .
yeah, it would be easier because, um, like, um, .
they're all connected together and, um, .
if they were like, um, like how, .
if they went through like the process of .
how they make those things, um, .
it could, it would work good because those things, um, .
but, why, um, the things that we are using, um, um, .
those aren't, um, those aren't very good because .
sometimes we don't really get the right answer .
because sometimes one of them may be under one of those, .
or maybe on top .
so maybe if we were laying out our strips, .
even if we were trying to be very, very careful, .
maybe part of a Justin might overlap the next Justin .
that you laid down next to it .
or maybe when Alex was laying down his Alexs, .
just a little bit of space .
would end up between the first and the second Alex, .
and maybe you wouldn't notice .
so not only is this easier, um, .
it's more accurate, is what I hear Nathan saying .
it would be harder to make a mistake because .
do these inches slide apart or wiggle or overlap ?
no .
nope, they are all .
connecteded .
they're all connected together and they are all even .
we said that was important .
um, Brittany, what were you going to say ?
um, If you use, um, a ruler, um, .
for your measurement, like you, if you were, um, .
like if you were using one that you had in your hand .
oh, is this, would we call this a ruler ?
no, a yardstick .
nichole ?
a yardstick .
do you mean one of these or one like in your desk ?
these yardsticks .
okay, a Yardstick .
um, and for the, for the, .
and you are measuring the doorway, um, that, .
that's your measure that you gave the person, .
that you bought the yardsticks, um, .
you couldn't be able to fold it .
you'd have to find a different way .
to figure out the problem .
you can't fold it .
but why would I need to fold this .
to measure the doorway ?
you don't need to, because .
you don't need to .
it would be too long .
if it, if it's too long, you don't need to, because, .
the inches are marked on there, .
you can look where the door stops, .
and then you can look, um, where the mark is .
so, um, Brittany, Nathan is suggesting to you that if, .
I want to know how wide the doorway is, .
I can just put it right here at the start of the doorway .
and then can go across and see where it stops .
and what number it stops at, .
and actually, it stopped right here, um, .
so that means it's the same wideness .
so how many ?
so um, it's, um, thirty six inches .
and sometimes it may like stop like right here .
or something like right here .
oh, well what if we were going to tell Brittany .
how, um, how wide the, the height chart is ?
um, what would you do with this to tell her that ?
even though we can't fold it or bend it ?
probably go like this .
and then since it is right here on this one, .
but it's, um, it's seven inches and one sixteenth .
because, um, I don't think that this got sixteen, sixteen of those .
it has .
but usually there's, um, sixteen of them on there, and then, .
um, then usually what you say is one sixteenth .
okay, why do you think it is one sixteenth and not, .
it looks like it went right to that line to me .
what would we call it if it went right to that line ?
um .
cuz we just .
one probably .
how many equal parts just like that, .
does it take to get to the next inch ?
we just counted them .
um, eight more .
um, well, there's eight in all .
there's eight of those spaces in all, .
and we used up one of them .
yeah, um, so um, .
this is hard .
nathan is using something that he knew about .
measurement tools like rulers and yardsticks and stuff .
and he is saying, well usually .
those real little lines on there are sixteenths .
so when he saw that this, um, .
growth chart went to that first little line past the seven, .
he thought it was seven and one sixteenth .
but we checked and, .
there aren't sixteen of those spaces in an inch, .
there are eight of those little spaces .
so, if it went one of those little spaces past the seven, .
it would be seven and .
um, two probably .
two what ?
two, um, two sixteeenths .
does this, uh, .
does, does this ruler show marks .
that show where a sixteenth is ?
no .
no, but what do the marks on here mean ?
it does show you where .
uh, like, uh, half .
and then a half of a half .
those two would be a half of a half .
and then these ones would be a half of a half of a half .
and what would we call that, a half of a half of a half ?
how many pieces would that give you, if you took a half .
three three pieces ?
uh, um no .
four .
what I am gonna do is I am going to make a big drawing, .
of what we were seeing on just part of the yardstick, .
okay ?
here is, um, the line that has the number seven by it .
okay ?
and then there's .
I wanna make sure I make this exactly like this ruler .
and then .
okay .
cuz why am I making .
all these lines all these different sizes Nathan ?
because, um, um, because if, um, .
if you didn't have those there, .
you, um, um, .
because why you have the longer lines is .
so that you don't have to, um, like keep on counting .
so you don't have to kind of, so, um, .
because if they were all the same size, .
it would be pretty hard to tell where half of a inch was .
because, you couldn't be exact .
so then they make the, the longest, .
the two longest lines are the, um, .
those two longest lines, those are the inches, um .
these two lines mean where the inch stops and starts, .
then the second longest is where it is half .
then the two other long, .
then the two other ones, .
that are long but are third longest, .
they are the, they're, they're showing .
where the half on this side would be, um, .
where a half of this half, um, .
on this half of the side that would be, .
and where the half a half would be on this side .
and then, these would show where the half, um, .
of this would be on this side .
and this one would show the half .
of where this one would be on this side .
and this one would show the half of this one, .
on this side .
and this one would show the half on, um, .
on this side of this one .
so everyone of these lines is a half ?
um, a half of the one that was before it .
hmm, so the only number I hear you saying is a half .
and, can I call all of these a half ?
no .
so they must have other names, right ?
so, this would be probably the half probably the half .
okay, so you see what, um, Nathan is saying to you ?
he's saying that these long lines are the inch lines .
everybody's eyes should be up here .
he said so this, .
these longer lines are where an inch would begin and end .
so if something was exactly from here to here long, .
it would be an inch long .
it's not clear to me, I think, .
I don't understand Nathan's thinking here .
and maybe some of you can help me out here .
nathan says that he thinks that if it goes from .
seven to eight it is an inch .
but I'm looking at the ruler, and it says to me, eight .
so how come it is not eight inches ?
what if, we measured this clip, .
and we started at the seven and it stopped at the eight, .
wouldn't this be eight inches long ?
um, no, it would still be one inch .
because, um, even if, because, .
because it has to go from here all the way over to here .
to be eight inches and, um, and see like this, .
if, let's say you were going like this, it is even the same .
it would be only one inch .
this time what Nathan did, .
I don't know if you can see his fingers, .
he started the beginning of the metal clip .
at the six on the ruler and it stopped at the seven .
and he's saying .
well just because it stops at the seven there, .
it's not seven inches long .
it's one inches, one inch long .
nathan says because it started at the six .
and ended at the seven .
every, everywhere where, um, everywhere .
if you like measure it where it goes to the, um, .
next number, it is one inch .
do you think Nathan is right ?
if you start anywhere on the ruler, .
and go to the next number, it's an inch ?
anywhere on the ruler, um, .
where, where you start, and it goes to the next number, .
that's where you, that's where it stops, that's an inch, .
because, um, because you, um, if it goes to here, .
it goes like from here to here, .
you can't, um, you can't say that is thirty one inches long, .
because that means that .
that would have to go from here all the way to here .
do you believe Nathan, do you think he is right ?
yeah .
nathan's saying, .
if you start exactly at any number on this yardstick, .
or any number at the ruler at your desk, .
and you go to the very next number, .
then you have gone one inch, .
whether you go from twenty five to twenty six .
or from six to seven .
seventeen to eighteen .
he says it doesn't matter which number you started at .
you go to the very next number, .
he says you are going an inch .
um, .
let's talk for, um, a minute .
going back to Nathan's trying to sort out for himself .
and for you, .
katy, come in close and sit still .
um, what all those little lines .
because remember the very first day .
we talked about measurement .
and I said +"/.
+" what if I didn't have a ruler .
you said +"/.
+" just make a homemade ruler .
I said well +"/.
+" how would I do that ?
well, you need some stiff paper or cardboard .
and then you have to put the numbers on .
and all those little lines .
and you would have to get them in the right order .
so lots of you knew, .
before we started talking about measurement at all, .
that rulers had numbers and rulers had lots of little lines .
and they have them in a special order .
but what we need to figure out is, .
what that special order is .
what Nathan is saying is, .
that the reason when you look at a ruler, .
you see all different sizes of different lines .
nathan is saying, imagine this .
imagine the ruler, .
have the seven .
and have the eight .
and all the little lines .
dividing that inch up into smaller parts .
were same size and the same length .
he says, how could you tell where half of that inch was ?
who could show me where a half inch is ?
the seven half ?
between the seven and the eight .
who can show me where it would be ?
jillian, come up and show us .
right here .
how quickly can you find the half way point there ?
it's easy, .
because you just have to look for the second biggest line, .
and it's usually right here .
nathan is suggesting to you that this line shows half way .
between the seven and the eight .
and the reason it was easy for him to spot, .
is because he has figured out, um, like a rule for rulers .
people make rulers, .
and they use these lines in different sizes .
what he's figured out is that theses longest lines, .
nathan's saying, are usually the inch marks .
the second longest lines, .
he says are usually used to show .
where the half inch mark is .
maybe if we label this one we would understand it more .
because once Nathan got to this part, .
where this would be half way between the seven and the eight, .
and then he kept talking about half and I got confused .
so I think we need to sort through that, .
and see what we would really call them, okay .
he was right when he talked about half of halfs .
how do I write that, half ?
one line, one line two .
okay, so if that is the half inch mark, .
then Nathan said to me I look for the next longest line, .
I found it right here .
so, I knew that was half of the half .
well, .
did anybody ever give you a measurement that, well, .
I want you to cut your paper, .
so that it's six and a half, .
and a half of a half inches long .
that would be kind of confusing, right ?
but he's right that is half of the half .
how much of an inch is that ?
I want to see if they are thinking with you .
I know what you're thinking, .
and you told them what you're thinking, .
but I want to see if they can think .
one fourth ?
with you and figure that out .
katy, why do you think we should call this a fourth ?
because it was four and ?
ok, um, so she is saying .
that each of these halfs of a half is a fourth .
so, um, so Katy, it's not drawn very closely .
can you see that these aren't drawn the same size ?
but if we imagine that this is half of the half, .
katy is saying that this much is a fourth of the inch .
going to right there .
and then if you went two of those fourth, you'd get a half .
then what would this be, Justin ?
if I was measuring on here, .
how much, where would this be ?
if I had measured, Justin .
think about that .
justin, Katy is saying that if you went this far, .
you would go a fourth of an inch .
and if you went, Nathan said if you go this far, .
you go a half of an inch .
what if you go this far, from here to here ?
how far do you go ?
think of it in, how much is three fourths of an inch .
sort of like the spine of the science book .
was three fourths of a Justin long .
do you see how each of these parts matches, .
and I didn't go all the way to the eight, to the eigh .
I didn't go the whole inch .
I went three fourths of the inch .
all right, well, then, .
what about this other set of lines .
that are half of the half of the half ?
one eighth .
katy says an one eighth .
yeah .
yeah, it is an one eighth .
one, two, three, four .
it is a one eighth .
five, six, seven, eight .
it is a one eighth .
well, if this is an eighth of an inch .
this is would be two of an eighth .
that's an eighth still .
one eighths, the smallest ones are one eighths .
right, so if we go just this far we are going an eighth .
what if, what's this next little line gonna say ?
three !
three eighths .
why do you say three eighths ?
I thought somebody said two eighth ?
one, two, and then three .
so this would be the mark that would make it three eighth .
and, then, this would be, this would be five eighth .
because, because it's three, four, five, and then six and seven .
the seven would be seven eighth .
justin, what would you tell me ?
well, I have something to ask .
okay .
what if something stops .
in the middle of like here, or right here ?
um .
it's a sixteenth .
well, if we took one of those eighths and divided, .
if we took all of our eighth and divided them in half, .
remember, did we do this with your strip ?
did we have to do this with your strip, .
one eighth was small enough for you ?
well, some people I worked with that do this .
they had to divide all the eighths in half .
and then you took every eighth, .
and divided in half you would have, .
one two three .
well, what if it stopped in the middle of one of the one sixteenth ?
what if it stopped in the middle of one of the one sixteenthths ?
uhh, it would be, thirty six ?
that would be, uh, probably be a half of one of the sixteenth .
right, what is a half of a sixteenth ?
uhh .
that's what we are thinking about .
I'm dividing every one of those sixteenth in half .
what is that ?
how do we find out ?
if I took, if I had one sixteenth, .
how many of them did I have in an inch ?
how many one sixteenth does it take to fill a whole inch ?
umm, .
sixteen .
sixteen, okay ?
I took every one of the one sixteenth and divided them in half .
so, what .
I'd say it would be pretty hard .
it is usually on a real ruler, .
they just make it into one sixteenth .
because if you have that, .
it would be pretty hard to figure out where it stops .
you're saying that maybe one sixteenth .
because, um, like, let's say, like, um, um, let's say .
it stopped, like maybe right here .
it's pretty crowded, .
so it's gonna be kinda hard to figure out .
umm, Justin, tell everybody what happens .
if you take one sixteenth and divide them in half .
one thirty second .
one thirty second .
not like you have thirty seconds to get to the dinner table .
one thirty second meaning, how would I write one thirty second ?
so half, half of a sixteenth is a one thirty second .
you would go, um, thirty, .
if I wanna talk about just one of them, one, .
what number goes down here ?
so they'll understand what you're um, thirty two .
this is we're talking about, one thirty second .
meaning you took one inch, .
and divided it into thirty two equal parts .
and what you are going to do today is make your own .
measuring tape, your own measuring tool, .
using your units .
okay, if I, um, start doing that, .
and I put my Carmens on the adding machine tape, .
so that I can get them all connected like a yardstick, .
I get them all in a straight line .
then, will I have a measuring tape, .
if I just glue them all on there ?
no .
you have to lines on there .
inches and lines .
inches and centimeters .
am I going to have inches ?
well, .
no .
what am I going to have ?
carmens .
I'm gonna have Carmens, right, yeah .
you're gonna have Nicoles .
and you are going to have Justins .
we're not going to make a measuring tape .
that like you would go and give .
to your uncle the carpenter .
and he'd use to build a house .
but by using your own unit of measurement .
that you understand pretty well, .
I'm thinking, .
if you can learn how to measure with Justins, .
you can learn how to measure with inches .
if you can learn how to measure with Kevins, .
you can learn how to measure in inches .
if Brian can learn how to measure in Brians, .
he can measure in inches .
um, and so forth, as Nicole says .
well, then I'm thinking if I just go like this .
that's not an inch .
um, is it supposed to be an inch ?
no, yeah, no .
it's supposed to be a Carmen .
is it a Carmen ?
yeah .
so, I can tell when something is one Carmen long .
I can tell when something is two Carmens long .
and if I keep going, and use all twelve of my Carmens up, .
I'm going to have a strip that's twelve Carmens long .
that I can use to measure anything I want .
cool !
awesome !
um, when Katy was measuring she found out, .
+" Oh oh, it's not going to end exactly on a Katy .
she had to think about what part of a Katy it would be .
she solved that problem, she said, by folding her Katy .
into a half, and if a half didn't solve her problem, .
because the part left over wasn't a half, .
she folded it into one fourth .
if one fourth didn't work she made one eighth .
one sixteenth .
right, and none of us went smaller than one sixteenth .
how can I add lines like that to my measuring tape ?
cuz right now my measuring tape would only be good, .
if something was exactly three Carmens long, .
or exactly four Carmens long .
you need to add the lines to show the half of them .
so you think my measuring tape would be better, .
if it showed where half of every Carmen was ?
how could I do that ?
uh, we already glued them on .
we already glued them on ?
yeah, so how can I do it ?
how could I do it if they weren't glued on yet ?
like I have, the next one isn't glued on yet .
if I take this one and fold it ?
alright, so I folded this one, .
and now I am putting some glue on it .
and I put it down .
you put a line on the line .
a line on the line ?
yeah, a line on the fold .
a line on the fold, okay .
um, I put a line on the fold like you told me .
how would I label that ?
half one line two .
katy's idea was .
take one of my Carmens I haven't glue down, .
fold it so that it's in half, .
and then use this piece that is half of a Carmen, .
to line up here, .
against this other Carmen, .
and to mark it, .
and then to label it .
not as good as folding it first, .
and being able to trace right on the fold .
but since I haven't done that already, .
I really thank Katy for using her head, .
and making them something I could do .
so Nathan is right, maybe it is not the most accurate .
but it's going to be, if I, if I go slowly and carefully .
do we put one sixteenth and one eighth and those things on there ?
um, I don't know .
do you think I am going to need those .
when I'm measuring with this ?
well, maybe .
so you don't think that just having half .
is going to be enough ?
I don't know .
I don't know what you're going to measure .
I, I would keep one out, um, .
so that you can fold it in case you need, um, .
so that you don't glue them all down before that .
before you have them all, um, .
because you may need one, one with maybe one eighth .
and you, and you won't have one to fold it .
so maybe I should decide before I glue them down, .
how many equal parts .
I want to divide each of my Carmens into .
do you think just whole Carmens and half Carmens .
is going to give me everything I need ?
no .
you may need one fourt and one eighth and one sixteenth .
I may need one fourth and one eighth and one sixteenth .
you may need one thirty second .
I don't think I need one thirty second .
I don't know .
I'm going to leave it totally up to you .
how you make your measuring tape .
with Justins, with Ashleys, with Dannys, with Nathans .
it's up to you .
paul has to make the decisions .
but after your measuring tape is done .
I am going to give you things to measure with it, .
so think as you are making it, .
how can I make this the best measuring tool for me ?
I have a question .
um, I wondered why we couldn't hand, .
let, let's say that we made it out of metal, .
why we couldn't hand the Carmens .
to the builder or the carpenter and say, .
here, use this as a tool for your measurement ?
I mean, You all seem to agree .
that that wouldn't be a good idea, .
but I didn't hear your thinking .
I don't know why, why you think that .
so when my measuring tape is finished, .
and all the Carmens are marked or whatever, .
could I give it to a builder, you know, .
someone I had hired to build my house or whatever ?
no, no .
and say, here you go, use this .
this is my special unit of measurement .
no .
why, why can't they measure in Carmens ?
justin, did you measure the spine .
of that science book last week ?
yes .
and you found it was three fourths of a Justin long, right ?
so it is possible to measure with Justin's .
I know, but, it's not the same size as .
why couldn't the carpenter ?
it is not the same size, it's not the same size as .
hmm, was that an accurate measurement ?
was it true to say the spine of one of our science books .
is three quarters of a Justin long ?
so you did measure carefully .
you did measure accurately .
yeah .
but, is there anything that makes my measuring tape .
something that couldn't be used by a carpenter ?
I mean, if the .
he could use it if, he could use it if, he could use it .
he could use your Carmens, but he just couldn't use it .
for like measuring feet or inches .
right, right .
you can't use it to measure feet and inches, can you ?
you can only use it to measure Carmens, right .
yeah, but like if he was measureing the windows, .
and he wanted to get the glass for the house, .
and he just said +"/.
+" I want I want glass that would be forty eight Carmens wide .
and would he have a problem ?
yes .
did you hear what Nicole said ?
I think many of you didn't .
and I think you need to tune in .
nicole said, fine, give him that Carmen tape, .
tell them you want your windows forty eight Carmens wide .
but then after he builds them, .
and he goes to the place to order windows for my house, .
and he walks up to that man selling glass and says, .
+" I need some sheets of glass .
that are all forty eight Carmens wide .
he wouldn't know what the heck Carmens was ?
he wouldn't know what Carmens are .
yeah, do you think the man sold him the glass .
would be very happy ?
no .
do you think the glass when it was finally cut, .
would it fit my windows .
as closely as I wanted to fit them ?
no .
probably not .
so why, why doesn't everybody measure .
in anything they want to measure in ?
I mean, once you know the rules for measuring .
everything won't work !
vannessa's saying that if we all measure it .
any way that we want to measure, .
and we all picked our own unit, .
and used it whenever we wanted, she said, .
somebody might not understand your measurements .
so, Asratu's point was that you could build a house .
if you measured in Carmens, .
but every single person making anything with a house .
would have to measure the same, same way .
so why do you think we have inches and feet and yards ?
um, so it will be easier ?
so it will be easier to measure .
so everybody knows what they're talking about .
so everybody knows what they are talking about .
yeah, now I could go to any carpet store, .
and tell them how many feet of carpet I wanted, right ?
but if I walked into Carpetland and said, .
I really like the beige carpet over there .
give me seventy five Carmens .
they wouldn't know what a Carmen is .
you'd have to show it, and explain it and, .
yeah, yeah, and they probably wouldn't get it right .
+" What's a Carmen ?
because, they've had lots of practice .
measuring in feet and yards and inches .
and do they know anything about measuring in Carmens ?
no .
so why am I having you measure .
in Brians and Ashleys and Saras and Pauls ?
do you think inches and feet .
are going to make sense to you .
after using Justins and Brittanys and Jillians and Katys ?
yes, because it helped me with learning .
do you know more about what inches and feet, um, .
mean and how they go together, .
than you did two weeks ago ?
no .
yeah .
yeah ?
yeah .
I think you do .
I didn't know what all the lines meant on there .
I always, I didn't know what the lines meant .
I just thought that they were lines or something .
yup, yeah .
you just thought they were lines or something .
yeah, and we just on there for decorations, right ?
just on there for decorations .
do you think they are on there for decoration ?
no .
no ?
why don't I plan until the morning of ?
yeah, because you can can never plan .
what they're going to do .
who knew Nathan was going to say +"/.
+" well, it's about one sixteenth and those little lines on the
what was Nathan's statement about ?
uh, well, when Brittany said, .
oh, Nathan was trying to make the point .
of it would be easier .
to measure the doorway with a yardstick .
because everything was all connected and held together .
and you could just lift it up .
and Brittany goes, +"/.
+" but you can't fold it .
what are you going to do if you get there .
and there's some left over ?
and Nathan's point +"/.
+" well, you just lay it out there .
+" whichever number it stops by, that's what you look at .
so we go over and try that, .
and because it was thirty six inches wide that didn't do it .
okay, well, how about this ?
well, of course, .
I picked something that was seven and one eighth inches wide .
and, um, he's going well it's seven .
and there is this little line here, .
and he goes, +"/.
+" well, that must be a sixteenth .
but I'm like, okay .
we find that out, um, well there's eight of them .
but I don't know, .
those little lines on the ruler usually mean one sixteenth .
so, talking about all of those little lines on the ruler .
was not in the plan for today .
it was more like let's start out with .
what you had to do to make that unit .
work for you in all situations .
and what they had to do was .
learn how to think about parts of their unit .
and they knew you had to fold it .
if the half didn't work for you, you made it in one fourth .
and if one fourth didn't work you had to make one eighth .
and if it's smaller than an eighth, .
some of us had to make one sixteenth .
so, instead of loose, or in this bundle, .
or in your pocket or pouch and carry it around with you .
you know, for convenience sake, .
we connect units of measure together .
to make measuring tools, I mean, .
it helps you keep track .
whether you are putting them on a measuring tape .
or a ruler or a yardstick that reason .
and that reason that Nathan said, .
well, no matter how careful you were being, .
maybe one edge of my Nathan overlapped the next one .
or no matter how careful he was trying to be, .
maybe there was just some space .
do you plan to revisit this idea of, um, .
that these, uh, conventions come from agreement, .
and what they're good for ?
I, I +...
yes, you mean, the idea to say about how, well, .
but nobody can understand what you were saying ?
or people want to know what you were talking about ?
yeah, yeah .
but I want, that was good for then, .
but, and they got that idea .
and these things, and then, .
uh huh, and then talk to them about that idea .
right .
because everyone .
will have a different measure for these things .
oh yeah, yeah, everyone has a different measure, .
for everything they measure in here .
because they all had a different unit .
and then getting at the fact, okay, well, .
you measured it and you measured it very accurately .
it's whatever .
its five and three sixteenth Katys .
very accurate measurement .
but, she measured it and got four and half Brittanys .
right .
who's measurement is right ?
well, they're both very well .
whose measurement is going to make sense to Katy ?
the Katy to Katy and the Brittanys to Brittany .
but what if we want to go to Missus Wainright's room .
and tell them to, um, build a bookshelf .
you know, the same size or whatever .
they are not going to be able to, so yeah, .
I think that whole idea of a standard unit of measurement, .
what that is good for, will come up .
and then it will come up again in other situations .
you know when we do area and and stuff .
no, I wanted them to, um, .
to use units that weren't standard units .
because I thought that was important .
and I wanted them, because I wanted them .
to talk about does it matter what you use, .
and does it matter how you use it ?
and, you know, what does it mean to measure ?
and I knew I couldn't do that .
if I handed them things they've seen and .
supposedly used again and again .
you know, they all came in .
+" oh, you have to have inches .
I mean, they ground to a halt, .
for I don't know how many minutes there, .
when I said, now you have to tell me how to measure, .
and I'm not going to use a yardstick .
I'm not going to use a tape measure .
I'm not going to use a ruler .
so I knew I had to start with something else .
um, and a, and these are just the kinds of things .
I wanted them to figure out .
I wanted to, them to figure out .
the thinking that went into making this thing .
they called a ruler .
that they think you need to measure .
what are all those little lines ?
what are those numbers ?
why are they all put together like this ?
and, and, you know, .
why did somebody do that ?
why is this a tool ?
you know dunno, .
I knew I couldn't do that if I started out with inches .
I thought Justin's comment was very interesting .
when he said, +"/.
+" I just thought they were there .
yeah, I just thought they were there .
the lines were there .
all those lines were there, um, .
yeah, and that is what a lot of them were thinking .
and that first whole day, all talk, .
what do you know about measuring, .
knew, knowing they knew all of that stuff, .
but they didn't know how to say it, .
and no one had ever asked them to really think about it .
and then starting with something nonstandard, .
and discovering for themselves .
why rulers and yardsticks and measurement .
is the way it is .
oh, you do need to talk about that part .
and that's why it's half and three fourths .
I mean, you did have to express that .
and then once they had found that out, .
linking that to, .
+" oh, yeah, I know why they divided up on that inch .
+" Because everything doesn't always land on an inch .
+" It might land here .
so, this is going to do better .
today was chaotic, .
and it wasn't anything like we thought it was going to be .
but this is going to be, going to be better .
even if they are still only comfortable to, you know, .
inches and half inches .
they're going to have some sense .
of what those other numbers are, .
and down the road that is going to make sense to them .
I think, then they are going to understand, .
oh, the reason we use this tool is so .
when I give you a measurement you understand it .
because we use the same thing .
and we use inches and I know what inches are .
your assignment, whatever you want to call it, .
is to use your special units of measure, .
whether it may be Justins or Kellys or Asratus, .
or Kevins, whatever they are .
to construct a useful measuring tool .
useful meaning you will be able to use it, okay ?
so, we talked a little bit about that yesterday, .
and we talked about how .
if we just put the units of measurement end to end .
and glued them down and labeled one .
where the first Nathan ended and .
two where the second Nathan ended .
and three where the third Nathan ended and so on, .
that there would be lots of measuring situations, .
lots of times that you would be asked to measure .
that that wouldn't be very useful to you .
it wouldn't give you the information you needed, okay ?
so the decisions about .
what to make your measuring tool look like are up to you .
you have to decide .
but you need to keep in mind when they are finished, .
I will be giving you some measuring assignments, .
some things to measure, .
and I am going to ask you to use the tool that you make .
so if you make it carefully today .
and put some thinking into it, .
sort through the ideas .
we've talked about about measurement, .
make it the way you think it will be .
the best for you to use tomorrow .
or the next day when we actually .
do some measuring with it .
well Asratu, um, what, .
can you tell me what you're, um, what you're doing now ?
we're just making like the measurement .
with our measuring tools, .
and gluing and pasting them on .
and we're all like gonna put lines like inches and meters .
like half of a tool, half our tools, like half an Asratu .
half an Asratu ?
yeah .
uh huh, so, uh, so where, uh, what uh, where's one Asratu ?
how are you going to find one Asratu ?
are you going to number these, put numbers on here ?
yeah .
so, okay, you're drawing the lines right where, .
the, uh, right where you glued your pieces on .
how come you drew a line there ?
well, that's going to be an inch .
that's going to be an inch ?
yeah .
so each of these are an inch ?
this would be an inch of my tool .
oh, that would be an inch on your tool .
I'm sorry, okay, so this is one .
see there's the black, right there ?
that's one Brian, two Brians, three Brians, and four .
so you're measuring that like this .
you're saying that this is one Brian, two , three, four .
well, why did you, uh .
okay, so what are you doing now Brian ?
I noticed you folded that .
how did you fold that ?
I'm folding it in half .
you're folding it in half ?
why do you want to do that ?
cuz, well then I know where half of it is .
and I need to do that on all of them .
then I'll know where half it is, .
then if it ends up on one, I'll know where half of a one is, .
and if on two, half of two, half of three, and half of four .
I would want every kid to know what their unit was, .
and what half of that unit was .
and anything that comes beyond that is great, .
that's cake .
but, it's not going to happen for everybody .
and even some kids, as we talked yesterday, .
and they got so specific, and so into it, .
and it that was making sense, .
when it came to actually doing it with their own, .
this just shows, this is a really hard concept .
and I'm not looking for them to be able to measure .
accurately to a sixteenth of their unit, .
or an inch, or anybody else's unit .
the weird thing though, .
did you see how they all started with the left, .
and went to the right ?
and now when they measure, .
they have to go from the left to the right .
and it's sort of like, maybe what we're finding out is, .
it's just like kids start with the tens, and then do the ones .
they don't start over here and move over .
well, when they're setting up this tool .
so see, there are conventions that, .
you don't even think of .
like when you're teaching a kid to read, .
you go, I gotta teach them eye sweep .
when you're teaching a kid to measure, .
you need to teach them which end of the tool is for what .
now it doesn't matter to them at all, .
and why should it ?
because they're not, .
they don't agree .
to those conventions of measurement yet .
so, when they picked it, they used it the right way .
they didn't pick it up and go, .
start at from big number and go over .
they just measured like this .
so they knew how to use it, .
they just didn't know anyone was going to care .
if their numbers go from the right to the left .
and I don't .
but that was interesting, .
that's wasn't something .
that I thought through ahead of time .
and said, they're all going to do this .
um, Saad had this whole thing, all layed out .
look at this, he has these huge units .
um, and had done the whole thing .
of of course, just then, Brittany comes running up: .
+" Saad did it wrong !
well, what did Saad do wrong ?
he's one off on every one .
he put the one right at the beginning .
at the very start of his first Saad was number one .
and then it's the number two and then the number three .
and I told him, did you go one Saad, if you've gone this far ?
and he goes no .
and I go +"/.
+" How much have you gone ?
and he just kind of stared .
have you gone anything ?
no .
move your finger one Saad length .
and he went like this, and he stopped .
and I said +"/.
+" What number did you write there ?
two .
what number should it be ?
one .
no, but I think this is valuable .
because no matter how specific they got .
even if the only thing they really understand .
about what they did is those whole numbers, .
that, using that using that real tool, .
or the measuring tapes we're going to use .
with inches and centimeters, is going to make more sense .
and then this shows me, you can have an excellent, .
very specific, very detailed, whole class discussion, .
where some kids are racing ahead of the others .
and you need this to figure out, .
how, what do have they all really got ?
ok, what point is my group at ?
not at individuals, that are up and down on given days .
um, you know, cuz you need some of those .
like Sara and Katy who seemed to have really cool ones .
as you sit and talk, this still takes a lot of thinking .
this wasn't easy for anyone .
um, we'll finish this up tomorrow .
we'll talk about what we found out .
and then we're gonna measure some things .
with these and with a standard measuring tape .
and talk about what they learned from this .
that helped them do that .
that's the goal for tommorrow
