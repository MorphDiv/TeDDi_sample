⌊ &-um ⌋ .
⌈ &-um ⌉ okay . 53965_55205
&-um we hafta work on our goal too and maybe we should do that as a group because Glenda had the good point that it seems to presume &-um presumes that restoration is +... 56745_70525
is a definite outcome . 71705_74205
(0.5) and I tried working on it last night and I was getting nowhere . 74525_82405
it's just the first sentence she doesn't like . 84155_85935
yeah &~i but I mean &~a she +//. 86055_89395
it's not that she doesn't &~a it's not that she doesn't like what we're saying it's just how we're saying it +... 89635_93295
we've got to sort_of &-um +... 94215_96915
put a spin on it that is more openended . 98395_101575
okay +/. 101855_102135
and it's kinda hard or I was having trouble without losing the integrity of what we were saying or sounding you know . 103275_113995
mhm yeah but <isn't it> +... 113695_115115
&~G Glenda really has a problem with it ?
I was &-um let's see what I so what I tried to do was to work from our from the problem sorta the problem statement into a goal . 118255_127375
and we have a sentence in the problem statement now that says that identifies MEANDRS' goal &{l=READING as to improve the diversity and quality of fisheries and wildlife habitat as_well_as the aesthetic and recreational quality of the river while minimizing the impacts to the riparian land &~noter owners and agricultural interests . 130205_148925
&}l=READING and then we say in our our objective is sort_of to provide oh material +//. 150265_154765
you know provide stuff to MEANDRS +/. 154985_156225
mhm +/.
+, and that MEANDRS doesn't have the resources to undertake it . 157765_161745
+, mhm +/.
+, and so I was trying to sort_of combine those three things into our goal that we are sorta serving as &-um you know that we're gonna you know provide this information &-um you know to assist MEANDRS you know in their sort_of in their goal to improve this that and the other thing . 161985_182565
&-um I don't know &~h what you guys think about that that approach . 184345_187785
<I mean> I think <it doesn't> it doesn't &~a address that that Glenda's concerns . 188525_195225
yeah +/. 195765_195785
+, I think +/. 195965_196245
+, mhm +/.
+, I think what she wants &-uh &~i is to to more specifically say something like in &~g in nice words that we will be be presenting them with a package of information and that they could do +... 196685_211485
with it as they please . 213395_215615
basically .
+, mhm +/.
+, and <they can> &~in they can +//. 218375_220895

mhm I can't find something . 237895_239435
what are you looking for ?
something that I wrote . 241875_243115
(0.18) .
why don't we just why don't we just define as our goal . 246015_266415
well I think one way to &~m maybe make it easier is in the problem statement we defined MEANDRS' objectives <and I> and I think that's good . 267675_278335
and I don't think we need to really rehash those in our goal . 278855_281435
okay +/. 282055_282235
+, &-um so you know maybe we can just say given MEANDRS' goals as stated in the or as described in the problem or in section one point one or whatever of the problem statement &-um +... 282585_311465
you know our the purpose of this project is to &-um (0.5) to to explore the option of restoring MEANDRS +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, or restore the watershed &-um +... 313025_317025
something like that . 319805_320925

⌊ so you would just ⌋ . 345815_346675
⌈ removed the &~b ⌉ the bad part . 346835_348315

yep +/. 354535_354675
+, mhm +/.
+, let's not assist them let's just give them the thing . 356165_359185

that doesn't look good . 373165_374245
see that was the problem I was having . 375605_376905
when I would just try to take it out then you would sort_of lose the (0.19) how +/. 377475_387495
+, ⌈ (a)bout if we just ⌉ took a whole different slant and said something like the goal of this project is to evaluate the &~ex you know is to evaluate the existing conditions of the watershed predict possible change &~i predict changes that &~reha &~rehab changes from rehabilitation or predict changes that that &~ma that could occur from rehabilitation and &~th and the &~a pros and cons of those changes on the economy ecology and social structure . 400375_430355

mhm +/.

⌊ yeah ⌋ . 453065_453245
⌈ yeah ⌉ just just no way around trying to work this out . 453725_457965
let me just . 458085_458485
rephrase this .
let's just write it up here or something so we can take <note of it> so (0.11) . 459745_463545
what is it ? 474255_474775
to evaluate existing conditions or +/. 474875_476915
yeah +/. 479615_479935
+, we can change it .
or assess .
or yeah I think assess . 479935_482955
(0.4) or identify . 484795_488575
you want identify ? 489415_490095
I don't know +... 490375_490935
assess kinda sounds like you're gonna judge it . 494075_495835
yep &=writing:board .

I came across &-um I know we had problems with pros and cons before +/. 765885_770805
yeah +/. 771065_771245
+, what about practical possibilities and limitations ? 771325_774005
okay . 775225_776385
I don't know it was just another (0.5) . 776985_778445

two s@l-s ?
&-uh yes . 789155_789575
okay &=writing:board .
so +//.
or maybe you know even just possibilities and limitations or something I don't know . 790275_808275
(0.7) .
&-um (0.44) what do you guys think ? 813665_841325
<does that> does that get away from the presumptiveness of +... 858275_862915
yeah we're not biased now . 865855_868235
(0.5) I just think to go <on and> on and on . 868415_873875
yeah &=writing:board . 874735_874835
what is a feasibility study ? 878295_885815
it's +... 889365_889465
I mean I I think you &~can I don't think there's any set definition of a feasibility study but essentially you're just identifying the limitations and constraints <of a> of a proposed &-um a you know proposed project to determine whether or not it +//. 891465_913185
you know and then depending on what your +//. 913505_915165
you consider your your ultimate constraint is it financial ? 915925_919685
is it public acceptance ? 920025_921225
I think it's &~y you know based on your constraints can can this project be done ? 922445_927285
(0.21) .
I was thinking we could even maybe just cut the middle sentence out . 949785_952865
okay +/.
+, because that's kinda all within predict potential changes . 954645_957605
+, mhm +/.
+, maybe we could just predict potential changes to (0.4) the ecology economy and &~c communities &-um they &~m that may result from rehabilitation . 957905_973985
or you know <we could> we could essentially leave leave this out . 976165_980225
yeah (be)cause ⌊ we're ⌋ +/. 981045_981445
+, ⌈ for ⌉ the &~objec and leave that as part of our objectives . 981585_984025

⌊ and then ⌋ +/.

just broaden . 985965_986605
what if we put in here to predict potential changes you know limitations and possibilities ? 986965_994765
I I think like if we're gonna do the whole like start narrow and and and expand as we go out if we just leave it as potential changes &-um +... 997585_1007805

that's including this ? 1025705_1027085
yeah . 1027545_1027725
I mean that's just my take on it . 1028025_1030805
okay .
yeah that's what I . 1032265_1032825
that's valid . 1032825_1033325
what I think &~i is that feasibility encompasses most of what is there you know . 1033845_1040585
mkay (0.8) .
(be)cause I mean the first sentence . 1040825_1051605
so we say the ⌊ goal is &~t ⌋ . 1051745_1052765
⌈ the goal ⌉ .
what ? 1053245_1053385
I mean the first sentence is basically our goal is to like +/. 1053685_1056105
⌊ yes ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ predict ⌉ potential changes . 1056585_1057365
+, right +/. 1057945_1057965
+, and then give it to a +//. 1058145_1058945
give (th)em a report and educational material . 1059185_1062405
(0.12) .
identify I don't like the word identify ⌊ there ⌋ . 1063885_1078865
⌈ okay ⌉ okay +/. 1079165_1079305
+, &~ident (be)cause I see like &~i &~i identify as like +... 1083275_1088455
like pinpoint a couple pinpoint a few aspects of the thing . 1089535_1093555
do you see what I'm saying ? 1096215_1096855
xxx .
oh usually my English is not &=laughs so good because I &=laughs:S4 I think the perfect word that I pictured there was assessment . 1097295_1110355
okay +/. 1111425_1111605
+, and but then Martin says that assessment implies a judgment component . 1112225_1120225
the problem is is that when you get into syntax it becomes whoever's reading it is gonna interpret +/. 1120385_1126585
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ things ⌉ . 1126925_1127625
it's just exactly you and Martin interpret assessment differently &-um and &~an &~int &~in and &-um interpret identify differently . 1127805_1136165
so it's gonna be hard when you get into those words like that it's sorta hard to make sure that you know that that that word is gonna mean the same thing to everyone who reads it . 1137335_1147875
consider@q ? 1148855_1153835
that sounds a little fluffy . 1156535_1157635
<is to> describe or ⌊ research ⌋ ? 1159355_1164175
⌈ yeah I think ⌉ describe@q is better . 1167175_1167215
⌊ <write that down> ⌋ .
⌈ research ⌉ describe (0.4) .
but describe@q also also implies mm basically that all the information is all the things that are laid out right and we could come up and describe them . 1168415_1184935
what about determine@q ? 1185635_1186575
no .
determine@q (i)s very rigid . 1187895_1190975
yeah +/.

hm examine . 1196655_1197395
examine ? 1198295_1198955
that's kind_of like (0.9) I kinda like examine though . 1200555_1211495
it is a little bit better I would agree . 1212315_1213835
(0.6) okay . 1215495_1220395
you like examine ? 1221055_1221775
<what does it mean> &~wha what does it mean to you examine ? 1222275_1226475
more like explore . 1228295_1230995
