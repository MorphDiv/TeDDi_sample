bring them and knowing how to carry through on them . 0_1710
and the reasoning and the processing . 1780_3580
he handled that . 3690_4350
uhhuh . 4950_5020
doing . 5040_5180
well . 5240_5370
I think this is all just beginning to really sink in with Brian
I think this is making sense . 8960_10270
&-um when you ask him questions about what he's doing . 10900_14380
so that's good . 15110_15940
that was I when you had this conversation he he knows where he
and he will he also tries to make the turns . 21420_24230
and . 24580_24750
mhm . 25340_25520
not in his mind but . 25840_27110
yeah . 27290_27390
sometimes he can really follow up . 27570_29150
and we've also figured out that &-um he's a hard kid . 29700_32220
you can't look at Brian until if he's attending or not 'cause even
his auditory memory and auditory skills are good . 41700_44740
they're his best . 45010_45750
that's how Brian learns best is that listing . 46300_48420
and he'd never give you that impression on just a quick look at him
oh I've lost him he's not attending but I call him back to a group
but he needs those constant messages that &-um you're being held
so I don't you know he doesn't get messages from me . 68520_71060
like I need you facing the group or I need you looking up your or I
I I don't care where you're looking . 74830_76110
but I do need to sometimes check in or just sort of assess and see
yeah . 86440_86540
and I've noticed . 86560_87020
so when he participates I mean when when &-uh you have him do
yes he does . 93380_93870
he's &-um a_lot_of Brian's problems too . 94350_96540
time will take care of . 96560_97470
he's one of the youngest kids in my room . 97520_99000
so maturity wise that explains a_lot_of the things we struggled
I mean he's just not &-um just not ready for a_lot_of that . 105440_109180
so it's good that in here we're not allowed of stay in your seat to
and yeah &-um he gets more freedom to move around and kind of to
and then again the same thing to stay with a task long enough that
and we get accomplishing something before we have to to switch
that's still something . 124100_124900
we struggle with . 125110_125690
our time periods are never you know the appropriate length or Brian
but he's he's doing he's doing better . 131170_133390
so all in all we got all the two-way twos done . 133780_136100
today . 136160_136380
they know who's in their team . 136400_137460
they decided in whatever way . 138220_140020
that's always interesting . 140580_141740
I go . 142020_142180
well how do you think you should decide . 142200_143460
oh Anyy Miny mighty Mo's <could we> could we put a little more
and no . 150580_150980
and and at this time usually that's not if they can decide
that's usually &-um acceptable . 156300_159180
can you tell us something . 159980_160870
you have time for that of the groupings . 161020_162960
that . 163360_163490
&-um well no one who worked together on a strip quilt was together
&-um so that was a choice . 170350_171790
and then children who struggled &-um with time limits who were just
&-um . 181060_181210
particularly Brian Paul Alex Kevin . 181800_186340
Nicole and Danny were none of them were in the same group . 187330_190460
&-um 'cause the groups were only gonna be three and then also
Katie and Sarah and and some of the others mhm . 198130_200940
&-um were not in the same groups with each_other . 201100_204030
so the groups were a balance of &-um how hard this is for you . 204620_210420
how easily you take to this . 210540_211620
and then &-um how do I take that . 211900_215140
someone who's going to go at this at a much slower pace . 215220_217470
I don't didn't put them necessarily with someone who's gonna work
mhm &-um but so tried to give some added guidance to kids who
so I just divided up some of the most able and some who need
and then used kids who average and their pacing in their
right . 256339_256490
you know you weren't with your very best friend . 256740_258140
or I tried to design a group that wouldn't be wouldn't end up being
and you're kind of just yeah you're part of our group . 262240_263710
but you're off to the side . 263780_264990
I wanted them to be groups that would actually manage to work as a
we'll see how how well that went . 270090_271950
but not I mean it didn't take a_lot_of thought but I did you . 272420_276180
know .
black out . 276440_276820
okay . 276840_277060
you will need a group by yourself . 277080_278100
<and you and you and you> and you won't be with anyone else . 278230_280340
and then filled in the other spaces . 280420_281990
so what what are you hoping for . 282900_284390
you know these kids the kids I'm hoping they're finished . 284660_287370
what are you hoping for . 287590_288500
<in the> in the groups discussion about you know <as they>
now it's a some it's . 293120_294390
just a they'll talk some but more just that they can go through I
and it won't be that hard . 299020_300140
but I think they'll be pleased with the results . 300380_301900
I think it's a nice culmination . 302040_303250
they won't have to struggle the way they do with the . 303770_305380
but the end of the strip close some of those were losing sight of
and this one will be more fun . 313980_315750
it will happen . 315820_316230
they'll be beautiful . 316280_316980
these they'll get to name and write about and stuff . 317000_319300
we take it a little further . 319420_320180
they'll actually have to give a name to their quilt . 320200_322260
when it's done based on the designs they say and write about what
&-um and they work on that as a team together . 327980_330380
and just a pleasant time to end up where you're working with others
and yes you'll do some talking . 333940_335230
&-um most of the talking I think when they'll get they have their
and they have to decide how to group them . 339160_340600
okay . 340680_340780
but throughout the process they'll pretty_much just be doing you
and &-um repeating that . 346740_348870
so we'll see . 349180_350940
okay yes we . 352090_353050
need to go through you've already gone through some of the most
a brand-new intricate complicated wonderful two by two designs . 360450_364390
and your teams have already made decisions about which of those two
&-um you're gonna use to make the finished quilts what your group
that's a_lot_of work time is to begin making the copies of those
you've gone over this lots_of times . 383240_384510
but now everybody ones how many two by two designs will each of you
and will they all look the same or will they be lots_of different
they often be different . 394310_395320
Brittany will all three of the ones you made be the same or
and what_about the other group each groups is very different . 400410_403350
though . 403480_403670
I'm very pleased to you that our finished quotes are gonna be
I wanna find &-um make sure I find a place to display them where
&-um because your final core projects I can tell em already are
and there's still lots_of squares in each of the colors up there .
and if we start to run out toward the end of the . 439180_441040
finished quilt project . 441220_441880
I'll cut more just of the colors we need . 442370_443920
'cause some colors we're gonna have lots left over . 444490_445850
and some we might use up almost all of them . 445960_448200
and even have to cut some extras after you finish cooling down a
okay . 454290_454420
remember this is &-um for example this is Justin's two by two
Justin can't use this as one of his three . 458920_460920
he has to make three more just like this . 461370_463360
just like everybody in group because I I need this to display .
&-um I'm gonna put all your two by two designs &-um up around the
so it's a square and there isn't white showing anymore . 477740_479920
and then put your name on the back . 480380_482010
and we'll have a tray up front to put all the finished ones in
and then when we when your group gets online and then done we'll
and you can assemble them to them . 492820_494320
okay . 495230_495360
I'm hoping before lunch that every team member gets at_least one
and you may get more than one of your to be done . 502440_505150
not that the team gets on them but that every member of the team
okay . 515330_515450
each group needs its own space . 515929_517320
and we need to work together by each_other . 517520_519240
so you can help each_other out &-um knowing which shapes these and
&-um some groups for the strip quilt . 523799_525570
look analyze their design first and say we're gonna . 525840_529280
need like we're gonna need the large green triangles . 529300_532760
and we're gonna need large yellow green triangles . 533420_536100
and we made small yellow green triangles large blue green triangles
and they made a pile of each shape first . 543640_545900
and then started gluing . 546290_547380
you might choose to do that . 547420_548500
you might have each person in the group cut shapes of a certain
oh you do all the red orange shapes . 555030_556380
and you cut some of the orange ones . 556400_557550
and you cut the red ones . 557600_559390
and then we'll all begin blueing . 559680_560910
or you may just have everybody think it through themselves and cut
but just check to make sure that everyone is making this
