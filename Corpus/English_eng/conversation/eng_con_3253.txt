use the method, okay ? 0_1985
use the method listed on the blackboard . 1985_3810
tell whether they are identities or not . 3810_9201
understand ? 9201_11105
try to prove whether they are identities or not . 11105_15776
number one to number seven . 15776_17296
those simple ones, just write down the answers in the book . 17296_21408
but if you need to simplify it, for that kind of equation, please do your work on your class workbook . 21408_30438
all right ? 30438_32168
class practice number one to number seven . 32168_35548
any more questions ? 35548_51271
number one to number seven . 51271_54510
please complete that . 54510_55540
if you need to expand it, simplify it, please do it in your classwork book . 55540_77238
don't just write yes or no . 77238_79141
just in the case, both sides are in expanded form, you can completely uh, you can directly compare it, then you can write down the answer . 79141_90935
but if they are not exactly the same, in different forms, in your classwork, show some steps . 90935_99621
okay ? 99621_100411
how to simplify the left_hand side, how to simplify the right_hand side . 100411_103828
and then compare the terms . 103828_105261
okay ? 105261_106628
remember, before the conclusion, write down the result . 106628_112310
whether the left_hand side or right_hand side are equal . 112310_114715
okay ? 114715_115976
before your conclusion, you should have the result . 115976_120220
left_hand side equals, or does not equal right_hand side . 120220_125700
xxx . 125700_132021
classwork book . 132021_137406
&=bell is there any question ? 137406_159556
write down whether it is left_hand side or right_hand side . 159556_163881
okay ? 163881_164755
stop for a while . 164755_172978
after the expansion, remember, you must tell whether they are equal or not . 172978_182701
and then your conclusion . 182701_184811
okay ? 184811_186156
if the left_hand side equals the right_hand side, then it is an identity . 186156_191116
but if they are not equal . 191116_194155
then this one, or you can simply say that, it is not an identity . 194155_201131
all right ? 201131_205636
okay, finish the work at home and we will check it tomorrow . 205636_210325
stand up please . 210325_211380
bye class . 211380_217643
