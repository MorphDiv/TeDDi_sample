<mister> Justice , which chambers did you move into when
I moved into the chambers in the center of the south side of the
it's smaller than the other chambers , but that's where the junior
I was happy there until I moved until Chief Justice Burger
how many law clerks did you bring with you from the Eighth Circuit
as I recall , and this is a long time ago , I brought two .
one was Dan Edelman , who is the younger brother of Peter Edelman ,
the other was Mike LaFond , whom I had hired for the ensuing term
lafond and his wife were in Washington at the time and were eager
+" can you stand another year in Washington ?
I don't know how enthusiastic he was , but he did stay on for
then , as I recall , Robert Gooding came on after we got to
was he a Douglas clerk at the time ?
I guess he was originally designated as a Douglas clerk .
yes , that is correct .
bill Douglas always had designated clerks .
one was never sure whether they were going to be clerks or not .
bob Gooding cast a lot with us , and I was very happy to have him .
did you find that the press of work was dramatically higher than at
I thought I was busy on the Eighth Circuit , but the baptism of
I think October term , <nineteen seventy> , my first term
of course , I didn't know the difference at the time , whether it
your first opinion as a justice was written in June <twenty-nine>
it's a case called Hoyt <v@l> Minnesota .
this was an obscenity case .
I'm wondering if you have any recollections of that opinion , or of
I don't really , and that was a non-argued case , as I recall .
but I have no special recollection of that .
it seems to me that I was in the dissent , and joined by two others
how did the Court deal with these obscenity cases ?
did you actually go and view the films ?
the Court was struggling with a definition of obscenity , and
and we , of course , the term “we” did not include Black and
they felt the words of the First Amendment , +"/.
+" that Congress shall make no law .
meant exactly that .
so they never bothered with going down and looking at the films at
the rest of us did .
nearly all of those films were the same .
they went through chapter by chapter and got , quote , worse ,
each chapter , they were all alike .
they weren't very good films .
they weren't intended to be , that wasn't the measure , it was the
and , what is obscenity ?
when is something obscene ?
it's a tough question .
I think it was Potter Stewart , in one of his usual one sentence
in your first term , how did you spend the summer between the first
did you go back to Minnesota , or did you stay in Washington ?
you mean after the term ?
yes , after you first arrived .
in June , you mean .
in June , yes , June of <nineteen seventy> .
yes .
I was down there , it seemed to me , about thirty days , and
I was tired of living out of a suitcase , when I'd anticipated
the thing got a little bit out of control , so I was there for some
but I went back .
then I had the problem of what to do with the accumulated Eighth
my colleague Judge Van Oosterhout , very graciously called one day
+" don't worry about them .
+" I see they're piling Supreme Court material on you .
+" I'll take them over , and we'll peel them off one way or another
and he did precisely that .
he took them out of my hands .
he took on most of them himself .
the third judge who had sat took on the others , and I was relieved
it would have been a little embarrassing trying to write them when
I don't remember much about that summer except that the chief
I didn't know how to do it really , during that summer .
then of course , Dottie and I had the problem of getting to
then the term got started .
do you think that the difficulty of the term was a function of so
yes , I think so .
I think that was a distinct factor .
there was one day , I remember , when the four cases were all
justice Harlan came off the bench , in the cloakroom there , and
+" bill , why don't we let Harry go into conference with himself ,
he said , +"/.
+" we know how our votes are , but he's the one that has to make
that made it dawn on me that the ninth vote was important .
now , your first opinion for the Court was Wyman <v@l> James
what do you remember about this case ?
you've mentioned a little bit about it not being unanimous , but I
well , I mentioned , I think , about Justice Brennan coming in and
did you have a say in which case you got ?
no .
we pulled out the assignment papers for that first term .
they're really unhelpful .
all it shows for the first two weeks of argument is that that case
do you know why you weren't given a unanimous opinion ?
no .
I was too junior to ask questions at that time .
there it was , and I went to work on it .
it took me a while .
I had trouble with it , and I knew there would be a dissent .
I think we didn't get it down until after the first of the year .
I was slow in getting it circulated .
what were the differences you found in working on opinions here as
on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals , there was comparatively
it was seldom that we would write back to someone and say , +"/.
+" I'll join the opinion if you'll put the .
+" following paragraph in it .
there was a little difference , I remember , in terminology .
we used the word , “I concur” , on the Eighth Circuit , which meant
that isn't the term of joinder down here .
I remember the first note I got on Wyman against James was from
I didn't know what that meant .
I thought it meant that that was a summons to go down to his office
so I had to get used to a little difference in terminology somewhat
of course , with nine votes , you wait , and hope for that number
with three on the Court of Appeals , one knew pretty well how the
down here , there's never any hesitancy about making suggestions as
+" I don't like the third sentence on the second paragraph on page
+" can you make it read like this .
and so there's very little of that on the Court of Appeals , but
now , the technology has really changed since you first came to the
were there Xerox machines at the time ?
it's often mentioned that one of the causes of Justice Harlan's
we didn't have those at the time .
I remember the struggle that it was for secretaries .
I remember my splendid first secretary there , batting away on
what was her name ?
her name was Shirley Bartlett , and she had been the second
when I came down , she , with others , applied for the assignment
but that fact made one hesitate to make very extensive changes in
you didn't change “who” to “which” very freely because it meant so
now it's so easy to do it that one doesn't hesitate at all .
when did you start your habit of working in the Justices' Library ?
as I recall , I did it fairly early .
I liked it for two or three reasons , the main one being that it's
everything's up there , and what isn't there , I just call upstairs
it's quiet , there's a telephone , but for some reason when I'm up
I think the secretaries would bother me only if a telephone call
I never really understood why other justices didn't use it .
I was told that Justice Douglas used it a lot , and I used the
one time , Justice O'Connor came up for a day or so , and used it .
but , evidently my presence was bothersome , or she didn't find it
so I almost had a private library to myself .
it was great .
I liked it .
how was your first opinion received ?
I think the media regarded it as maybe an opinion to be expected of
I didn't get much in the way of acute disapproval from the justices
justice Harlan wrote a nice note joining it , and one or two others
you write and say , +"/.
+" it's a pleasure to join your first opinion , and it's a good one
that kind of thing .
those routine letters came in .
your first unanimous opinion for the Court also came down that term
this was actually the first of many opinions that you wrote that
do you have any recollections of this case ?
yes , I do indeed , and I think it was the last case where a court
after that , there was never a similar case .
but it sailed along and didn't seem to cause too much trouble .
I don't recall any pulling and hauling on it anyway .
this case is actually now a subject of discussion with regard to
to what do you ascribe your own support for aliens over the years ?
to begin with , these were aliens that were legally in the country
they were not illegal aliens .
I suppose , maybe I felt sympathetic toward their plight at times
after all , they were about to be , it was hoped , citizens of this
they'd come over seeking a better life , most of them .
there's nothing particularly in my background that led me to that .
of course , on my mother's side , her ancestors had come over , and
not so on my father's side .
he came out of New England and went back a number of generations .
I can't pin it on anything that would make me particularly
probably the two most famous cases of that first year on the Court
the Swann case of course was important .
I think it was particularly important to Chief Justice Burger .
he wrote it , and in conference discussions was always speaking of
and there were one or two members of the Court who felt that was
I'm not in a position to comment on that argument , but I know that
but it was important .
like many initial cases in a particular area , one can't answer all
the Pentagon Papers case was , of course , extraordinarily
as I recall , Alexander Bickel argued it on the one side , and
it was excellently argued .
it was one of those cases that one remembers as being excellently
there are few enough as it is .
it was seemingly rather vital at the time , and there were the
were we to look at them ?
if we did , it was a pretty casual view .
we looked at them and felt , maybe we shouldn't , and there they
+, there are a huge number of papers .
yes , there were .
and the case came up on a very fast track .
is that right ?
on a very fast track , and resented because of that fact .
I can still remember sitting way in the junior seat , and watching
do you remember anything about Griswold's argument ?
no .
it was a good argument , and earnestly given .
I think he was convinced of the rightness of it at the time .
I don't think I can say any more than that .
he was one of the very few solicitor generals to carry over from a
did you notice any change in the way he argued cases from the
I suppose the answer to that question would vary upon who the
I think that Erwin Griswold called the shots as he saw them and was
I think he was not at all responsive to the political affiliations
he felt that as <S_G> , he was representing the government
other <S_G_s> have not taken that kind of a position .
did you feel that the quality of oral .
argument was better at the Supreme Court than it had been at the
I have said publicly that I was surprised that it was not ,
now , when I say that , I do it taking all the cases together .
there are cases , such as the Pentagon Papers argument , that are
but , there are a lot of cases that are really pretty bad , and
in a way , this is understandable .
a lawyer who hasn't argued much has a case , and all of a sudden ,
and his partners , or other people will say , +"/.
+" oh , let me argue this case , I want to do it .
but he isn't going to give it up .
it's his case , and , I suppose , the lawyers feel that's a great
it isn't going to happen twice for most of them , and so they hold
and yet , at the same time it's surprising .
there have been cases where we anticipated the argument would be
I remember distinctly one time when a young woman was arguing , and
figuratively speaking , she picked herself up off the floor and
+" wasn't she good , wasn't she good ?
that's always a great pleasure to see counsel react that way .
did you feel awkward during the Pentagon Papers case having just
a little I suppose , yes .
not very , but a little .
there I was , I had a job to do , and so I thought maybe I ought to
I didn't feel like recusing or anything of that kind .
was this the most visible case of the term , the most highly
certainly it was one of them , although the October term ,
I didn't realize it at the time because I had nothing to compare it
I think it was Hugo Black who said it was the most important term
there were a lot of vigorous and important and determinative cases
I do recall that at the end of term I never felt more
I was glad to get out of town .
maybe it was in part due to the , not only my first exposure down
did it wear you down ?
did you find that you had difficulty gearing up , for the next case
no , not in that respect .
you just had to gear up , and move along .
now Justice Black and Justice Harlan , each wrote at the end of the
justice Black wrote a ease called Younger <v@l> Harris about
justice Harlan wrote an opinion in a case called Cohen <v@l>
do you have any memories of these cases ?
yes , both of them , of course .
the latter case brought us again into the confrontation with the
younger against Harris , was cited in case after case after that
lots going on in <O_T> <nineteen seventy> .
in Cohen you dissented , remarking on the immature antics of the
in the future , you became more generous towards First Amendment
do you think you changed in your view ?
no , I think I'd probably stay with it , although , I'd think twice
I still think it was immature .
but there's a lot of immaturity around , a lot of people don't grow
he was actually a smart-aleck .
I think I would stay with it .
I'm regarded as maybe a little more liberal in outlook now than I
several of these cases revolved around the Vietnam War .
was that a backdrop for the entire term ?
were the protests in the streets about Vietnam affecting the way
a number of cases certainly were affected by the presence of the
no doubt about it .
I don't believe that the presence of the war actually affected the
but times were difficult , politically and otherwise .
in a sense , I was in the midst of it because I was one of the four
did you know people who were fighting in Vietnam ?
yes .
and have you been down to the Vietnam Memorial here in Washington ?
yes .
what are your feelings now about the war ?
Robert McNamara has recently gone on record as saying that he
yes , and there will be a lot of to-do about that .
of course , this is only a week or so old now .
I thought that there was a certain amount of unfairness in the
so many people took the position as “Mister Nixon's War”
well , that war was going on before he went into office .
extraordinarily difficult .
a long , long way away , and no one had ever I don't know my
that will go on in our history for a long time , as to whether we
blame will be allocated all over the place .
would the justices ever talk about politics among themselves ?
strangely enough , not to my knowledge .
this surprised me a little .
even after an election , a presidential election .
and I was there , of course , through a few of them .
the day after there might be a comment or two about how it came out
but never a pre-election comment .
I don't believe it was a studied attempt to stay away from
I was gratified and surprised and pleased about it .
you've attended now many State of the Union addresses .
would the justices ever talk about the content of the remarks
I think my answer to that is in the negative .
in my experience at least , we always went , or some of us did
and there gathered in one place is governmental power .
mention has been made if a bomb were to drop in that assembly , the
right .
the secretary of Commerce .
0 &=laughter .
yes .
it's interesting to watch politics in action there .
when the Democrats will applaud at a certain place , and the
I've always been interested in the political process , and I found
of course , I always felt a little foolish .
the Court goes in robes , and sits up in the front row , it's
but there are times when one could applaud without being regarded
+" don't we have a great country .
or something like this .
you know , you'd like to applaud that way , but we sit there
behind us will be the Republicans or Democrats , one or the other ,
it's great fun .
did the justices vote ?
did you vote in elections after you got to the Court ?
always .
yes .
and yet there are those who didn't .
justice Harlan went out of his way to tell me that he never voted
there was someone else , I've forgotten who it was perhaps
it didn't stop me from voting .
I felt I was a citizen , too , so I voted .
maybe it's improper , but I don't know why it should be .
the summer after your first full term on the Court was the summer
what do you remember about that period and their decisions ?
their termination of service with the Court came at a very
it came in September of <nineteen seventy-one> , which is
so we went into that long conference with just seven voices , not
I know it must have been difficult for the chief justice at the
we didn't know who else would come along .
he appointed a committee , of which Potter Stewart was chairman , I
a four to three decision would carry the day all right , but four
I think the chief , properly , wanted to avoid that .
so we went along and selected cases for October and November
and we didn't do a very good job actually because there were a
they were argued to a Court of seven ?
argued to a Court of seven .
which indicated a couple of things .
one was that nobody realized how controversial they were going to
anyway , as I say , we didn't do a good job .
there were a lot of four to three decisions that sailed along on
they didn't do any harm anyway , but I'm glad that the abortion
at which point did you become fairly certain that Justices Black
well , of course , their retirement notices came in December , I
black died within a week .
he went very fast , really .
justice Harlan lingered and died in early January , I think the
that was not an easy time .
it must have been a very difficult time for the chief justice .
now the first names that were mentioned to replace them were not
one name mentioned as a possible nominee was a man named Herschel
another was Mildred Lillie , of California .
then in the end the president settled on Lewis Powell and William
do you remember anything about the process of nomination and what
well , this is all speculative in my mind .
I think the president wanted a southerner .
he certainly tried hard enough at the time I was nominated .
and Mister Nixon indicated at that time that a southerner
he made that flat statement which , the correctness of which ,
I think that Herschel Friday was a very valid and legitimate name
I knew Mister Friday fairly well .
he was out of Little Rock .
he was a partner of the old Mehaffy office , Mehaffy , Smith and
<mister> Mehaffy , the head of that office , then was
I , from Minneapolis ; he , from Little Rock , but in firms that
Herschel Friday , after Judge Mehaffy came on the court , became
he was a good advocate .
I was always happy to hear him argue , but he was in the
that was not a happy assignment at the time .
so you had sat on those cases ?
sure .
so he had argued before you ?
yes , indeed .
I had respect for Herschel Friday and felt that he was a
I mentioned this once to Thurgood Marshall , and he reacted against
now I don't know what his experience had been with Hershel Friday ,
did you know Mildred Lillie , the other +/.
I might say Mister Friday , of course , was killed in an
he was landing on a private strip about two or three years ago and
the woman that you mention I do not recall .
I don't think I ever knew her .
+, when the name of Lewis Powell came forward , was he someone you
he had a reputation , of course , as a former president of the
I don't know how anyone can accomplish a lot in one year as
but he was highly regarded .
he was the , in a way , the spirit of the Old Dominion , the
his biography says he was a reluctant justice and that he had tried
do you know that that's true ?
certainly there was rumor to that effect that he had been offered
he never told me so , that this was the case , but I suppose the
you don't , I guess .
but I think his appointment must have been a popular one everywhere
highly regarded , known by the general bar , and he just fit .
and William Rehnquist you had met before .
yes , because , Bill , if I may call him that , at the time was one
I'd known him in that respect .
he was then assistant attorney general in charge of the office of
as an interrogator , he was out in front .
he worked with Johnnie Walters , who was assistant attorney general
but he was obviously representing , in a way , the administration ,
he had a fairly controversial confirmation hearing , although he
he , himself , when he came on the Supreme Court ?
right .
yes , there was a substantial vote against him .
I think , as many as twenty-eight , or something like that .
bill was never afraid to enter a fight when he had to and carry out
when did the two of them finally come on duty ?
they came on as <one> remember , I'm guessing at this , but I
they came on together , were sworn-in together , and of course ,
so Lewis Powell was never the junior justice , but Bill Rehnquist
do you remember any steps you took to welcome the two of them ?
did you have any view about how you ought to be as a welcoming
well , I hope I'm right in this recollection .
it seems to me that , and this isn't very important , but it seems
I was the junior until they came on , wasn't I ?
I think I was .
I had hoped to establish a little tradition that the junior should
I remember that dinner party .
the table was set in a square , and the square was filled with
it was very nice .
Dottie had set it up extraordinarily well , and the dinner itself
it was a happy evening , I thought .
they started right in , in the middle of the term , several months
yes , that's right .
there are many famous cases from <O_T> <nineteen
you sometimes called it your favorite case .
is that so , and if so , why ?
well , many times , if I'm giving a speech somewhere , particularly
+" is it any fun writing opinions ?
+" have you ever had any fun ?
+" and , which case did you enjoy working on most ?
and I always say it's Flood against Kuhn because it was the
they seem to know about the baseball case .
I was always interested in baseball , and it gave me a chance to
I didn't want to get into present years of baseball and try to
I've forgotten how many .
I remember Potter Stewart calling up , and he said , +"/.
+" I like that history of baseball , but why didn't you name Eppa
and I said with embarrassment , “Didn't I name Eppa Rixey” ?
and he said , +"/.
+" no .
+" and you know what a famous player he was for the Cincinnati Reds
+" if you will add him , I'll join your opinion .
well , the name of Eppa Rixey went into the list right away .
as a matter of fact , I always blame my secretary for having
it's always a conversation piece , the baseball case is .
a lot of people , being baseball fans , want to know why “A” was
then they start reminiscing , and we have a lot of fun .
on the other hand , I've had a lot of criticism about that .
the chief justice , Chief Justice Burger , and Justice White didn't
I don't know .
he never told me .
but , I've always been surprised why Byron White didn't join it ,
maybe he thought it was beneath the dignity of the Court too , or
I've never asked him ; he's never volunteered .
one day maybe I'll ask him .
I'll get some blunt answer , +/.
another historical oddity of that case was that Justice Arthur
do you remember anything about that argument ?
+, yes , I do remember that .
I remember coming on the bench that day just as I remember coming
the latter situation , Justice Fortas was in the well of the court
I'll never forget that .
the same thing was true in a way when we came in for the baseball
it presented a little bit of a problem for the Court .
how do we address Mister Justice Goldberg ?
do we call him Mister Justice , and if we do , is that an
we can't call him Arthur , although , among ourselves , we're
so I think we all ended up , being rather neuter and spoke only of
I think it was a difficult argument for him , as it would be , I
he told me afterwards , as I recall he did it orally , that never
it was too much of an emotional experience , and he thought maybe
after all , an advocate wants to do well , and he knows he's being
I can understand his position .
I think he was troubled during the argument and afterwards .
did you ever meet Curt Flood ?
no .
I did not .
as far as I know .
I'm sure I saw him play , but I don't recall that I've met him ,
although Chief Justice Burger eventually joined your opinion , it's
is this correct , or do you recall ?
no , I don't recall that .
I certainly wouldn't want to say that Potter Stewart made the
I could look up in my files probably and find out if he did .
if he made the assignment it was because the chief justice was on
do you have any sense of why you were chosen to write the opinion ?
only because I had probably talked too much baseball during the
I was glad I caught it .
I never asked for it .
I never asked for any case , but it was fun writing it .
well , we're speaking at a time now where baseball is just coming
do you think that would be a good idea ?
or do you have any views about how this has all played out ?
well , in some respects that case wasn't very important .
I think it wouldn't have made much difference had it gone the other
but we felt at the time that saying that baseball was a sport ,
they could act .
of course , it was perfectly apparent that Congress wasn't going to
there were too many constituents back home who liked baseball , and
but now , times are a little tougher .
after all , why should baseball be different from football , and
why should it have a special status ?
it may be that had the baseball case gone the other way , in the
but it wouldn't surprise me if baseball were to lose its anti-trust
a last question before we end this taping .
is there any name that you should have added to the list that you
oh , a lot of people have suggested names .
I'm content with the list .
I thought I did pretty well as it was , especially after I got Eppa
okay , thank you very much Mister Justice
