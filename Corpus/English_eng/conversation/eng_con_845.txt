(be)cause I had my friend round on Thursday , he wouldn't leave us
and he kept coming in and &-um annoying us .
and he we were playing on my Sega Mega Drive .
and he kept coming in and pretending to switch it off and
and he started playing on it and everything .
and when we were eating something he kept nicking all our food and
and +/.

all the time he he's he gets all his friends all around
+" maggot !
