&-um and now I'm &+s I'm still trying to find somebody to . 252320_255290
to to finishing teaching me . 255460_256900
rolling I I I started to learn rolls last year and then . 257220_260510
&-uh we ran out of weather before I could really get it . 260950_263400
and this year I have . 263920_264620
well rolling in a sea kayak . 264080_266170
I don't even know anybody around here that rolls in sea kayak . 266440_269400
oh yeah everybody I know rolls in sea kayaks . 269240_271710
really . 271530_271910
well no I shouldn't say that but . 271760_272910
yeah I mean sea kayaking rolling in a sea kayak makes a lot of
&-eh &-eh . 274040_274360
it's a hell of a lot more convenient to be able to roll your kayak
oh yeah . 282220_282940
than it is . 282300_282780
to to have to get out and reenter . 282940_284780
than get out and then get back in in the cold water . 283670_286260
yeah . 285490_285810
yeah so that's why I want to be able to do it I mean it's just . 286140_288520
it's it's sort of knack you know you learn it in a couple of hours
uhhuh . 292520_292840
but &-um it's &-uh it you know you got to get the the expertise and
yeah . 297770_298120
so far I haven't had anybody to teach me but I'm still working on
but what I've done twice this summer is go . 301230_303610
inflatable river kayaking . 304170_306090
that's something else . 306620_307370
in an inflatable raft . 306610_308440
yeah . 308560_308880
it's it's a one person inflatable kayak . 308730_311100
that's wild . 311030_311700
and it's just like a little mini raft that's shaped like a kayak .
yeah . 314780_315080
and there's no cockpit . 315470_317550
yeah . 317880_318280
it's all open . 318130_319200
yeah . 319210_319510
and it's self bailing . 319830_321020
&=laughs yeah right . 321350_322290
so you can take it on class three waves . 321450_323950
how does it self bail ? 323780_325010
well it . 325020_325420
well . 325060_325700
it's so shallow . 325770_326700
the floor is not the floor is not attached to the sides . 325840_328970
they're both inflated separately . 329530_331370
oh . 330960_332040
they're tied together . 332020_333160
but what happens is because the floor is inflated . 333800_336110
the whole thing rises up with you in it . 336510_338590
and as it rises back up . 338980_340520
the water seeks its own level so it goes out . 341010_343220
yeah it bails out . 342560_343400
yeah . 343950_344300
yeah . 344130_344430
but don't you have to be able to roll that . 344620_346130
so it's just like a big . 344830_345940
no people don't roll it . 346960_348000
no . 348330_348780
if you fall if you fall out . 348350_349970
you just swim up to it and you &+clam clamp her back in . 350390_353450
but if you're in white water and stuff you're going to be out of it
well not in a class three . 356390_357980
no . 357960_358250
we don't do anything that's class four . 358520_360730

half the people made it and half didn't I made it one day and then
