well, the name of this story is O'Henry story .
and it starts late at night where a policeman is walking the beat .
and he's checking all the doors to see if they're locked and
as he walks along, there are not many people on the street .
he sees a man standing there in the doorway .
so he walks up to see what the man is doing there .
and what is this all about .
the gentleman standing there tells him that he is waiting for a
that twenty years ago, there was a restaurant there by the name of
and he and a friend had dinner there .
and his friend was leaving town .
they decided that they would meet in twenty years to see how each
and the twenty years had passed .
the policeman said okay .
and hoped his friend showed .
and he walked on to complete his beat .
the man waited for about twenty minutes .
and then he saw a gentleman approaching .
he had his collar turned up .
and looking all mysterious .
he walked up to him .
he called him by name .
and his name was Bob .
and so they greeted each other .
and were glad to see each other .
and, you_know, talked for awhile .
said they wished that the restaurant was still there .
but instead they walked down to a drug store .
in the meantime, as they were walking along, they were talking
and life had been good to both of them .
his friend, what was his name, Mister_Wells .
I can't remember his first name .
but anyway, Mister_Wells .
so Mister_Wells told him that he had done well .
he was in New_York .
and life had been good to him .
as they entered the doorway, there was light in the drugstore .
bob realized that it wasn't the same person .
and so he said, well you're not my friend .
and Mister_Wells says +"/.
+" no I'm not .
+" and you are under arrest because we've been looking for you .
Chicago wants to ask you some questions .
so he told him he was going to take him to the station .
but in the meantime, he handed him a little note .
and the note was from his real friend Mister_Wells .
and the note said that he saw him standing in the door .
he realized that he was a person that was wanted by the police .
and because he was his friend, he could not be the one to arrest
so he looked for a plainclothes police to do that .
and that was the end of the story .
I'm divorced .
and my exhusband is from Alabama .
and so he was a preacher .
and decided that we were going to live in Alabama .
and actually, I went to Alabama to be married .
my mother, who was totally deaf, said she would never fly .
but I was flying to Alabama to get married .
so she said well, I'm going because I'm going to be there .
so we caught a plane .
and went to Alabama to be married .
she said, she was from the South .
and I'm from Washington DC .
and she said +"/.
+" oh, you'll never make it in the South because it's totally
but +"/.
+" yeah, I'll be fine .
it really was a different experience .
so I guess, I hadn't been there very long when my husband and I
it was a new restaurant that they had opened right on the railroad
and so we went there to eat .
nobody in the town, no Black people in the town, went to this
my mother inlaw said +"/.
+" I can't believe you all are going .
but we went .
and when we got there, everybody was really very nice to us .
the food was very nice .
well, we had been there maybe about five minutes .
and the sheriff came in .
and he sat at a table across from us .
and we had a nice conversation .
it was all really nice .
and so when we got ready to leave, my husband said +"/.
+" do you remember where my mother lives ?
and I said +"/.
+" yeah I do .
he said +"/.
+" well, I want you to stay here .
+" I will go get the car .
and I was like +"/.
+" the car is right there .
+" I can walk over to the car .
he said +"/.
+" no .
+" stand here .
+" and if anything happens, make it to my mother's house .
I was like +"/.
+" oh_my_god .
+" what is this ?
so he went .
he started the car .
he waited a while .
he came over .
and got me .
and we drove home .
and he didn't say anything .
and I was like +"/.
+" what is wrong with you .
he kept looking in the mirror .
and so when we got home and we got inside, he said +"/.
+" you_know you are oblivious to everything .
+" first of all, we were followed home .
+" because this community is not sure of you are Black or White .
+" and the other thing is, you_know, Black people just do not do
so we went again to the restaurant .
I guess to make a long story short .
we went about three times .
and he said +"/.
+" now look at your watch .
and we would get in .
we'd sit down .
five minutes after we got there the sheriff would come .
every time he came .
<people would> it was fine .
I mean people treated us well .
they finally stopped following us .
but it was interesting because one woman said to my mother inlaw
+" we know her mother is White .
