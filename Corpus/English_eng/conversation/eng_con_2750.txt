he should um, perhaps, sleep out in the hallway more often . 54657_59737
you know, or, like you could probably blast out look, you could um, you could divide this room right in half, and blast out mike's wall, and then we could just have two rooms, two big rooms . 59737_72247
and mike could sleep in the hallway closet or something . 72247_74848
