yeah I could &=laughs:S1 not be an accountant &=laughs either never . 291115_294175
oh dear well now Doctor_Crown talked about rules and regs and degree requirements and what it is that you need to get out_of here and I don't wanna talk about what you need to do to graduate . 295505_307585
I wanna talk about how your interests will translate into the courses that you wanna +/. 308025_312405
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ take your ⌋ first semester . 312585_313385
so one thing you and I know is that you're going to be taking either Great Books +/. 314005_316885
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ or Classical ⌋ Civilization . 317005_317945
and the other thing we know is that by using the results of these placement tests we will kind_of decide what other courses you need to take , which other courses you want to take . 318745_328785
&-uh the first thing here is that you placed into the Spanish two thirty one +/. 329825_336565
+, mkay +/.
+, which is the third semester of Spanish . 337285_339245
+, okay +/. 339605_339625
+, so if you want to continue with Spanish it means that you are to take two more semesters of Spanish . 340105_345225
+, mkay +/.
+, and if you wanna continue with Spanish my strong recommendation is that you do it now instead of waiting until next year +/. 347465_355065
+, right +/.
+, or the year after that +/. 355425_356165
+, right &-um +/. 356485_357805
+, so that's one decision you're gonna make . 358445_360285
+, okay +/. 360325_360545
+" am I gonna do Spanish ? 360825_361965
+" am I gonna switch to another language ? 362105_363405
okay . 364185_364845
then &-uh math and chemistry are a little bit murkier because if you had said to me +"/. 366555_375635
+" gee you wanted premed you wanted a biology concentration that's really what you wanted to do . 375795_379775
then I would say +"/. 380275_380715
+" well you gotta take math and chemistry because you need chemistry before you can take biology and &~ma you need a year of math if you're gonna be a biology concentrator . 380775_390715
+" you need two years if you're gonna be doing microbiology or something like that +/. 390875_394015
right +/. 394255_396355
+, so you'd better get started with the math right away but your interests to me don't &~s don't necessarily demand +/. 394305_403165
+, mhm +/.
+, that you do chemistry and math right away +/. 403745_406145
+, mhm +/.
+, &-uh you may decide you wanna do that at some point but it's absolutely not necessary +/. 407545_412025
+, mkay +/.
+, especially if you are right now you know you can't decide which way you're going and you want to be able to sample both fields +/. 413035_423135
+, mhm +/.
+, so it probably makes more sense to you in your first semester to sort_of take something from the social sciences that might lead you toward international relations so +/. 424735_433355
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ like ⌋ you know international you know politics ⌈ or something like that ⌉ . 433595_439215

⌊ which is ⌋ Poli Sci one sixty . 442025_443085
okay . 443545_443785
you know you might wanna do that and then you might wanna take this biological anthro course or a beginning geology course or +/. 443965_450725
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you know ⌋ something like that and then if you decide you wanna do geology or bio anthro then you could use that poli sci for social science distribution . 450925_460085
+, right okay +/. 460465_461005
+, and if you decide you want &~so &-uh poli sci plus take some economics then you take these other courses for natural science distribution +/. 461085_467105
+, right okay +/. 467405_467665
+, so nothing is wasted ⌈ really ⌉ . 467865_469185

I'm not sure if I remember that one . 502285_503725
oh <you will> you will remember I guarantee you . 503945_507685
oh yeah okay right I ⌈ did see this yeah oh mhm right yeah ⌉ . 508245_511185

mhm +/.
+, &-uh has got an honors section . 518735_519835

+, oh okay +/. 522175_522555
+, okay ? 522755_522915
so there are a_lot_of different ways to do an honors course . 523475_526115
you don't hafta do Honors Math to do an honors course . 526255_528815
+, okay +/.
+, you can take all sorts of other options for honors courses . 529115_533455
okay oh <that would be> &~go that would be . 533855_535915
now &-uh one thing I haven't asked you is &~eh whether you took any AP tests in May . 537145_543085
I did and I know the the &-um . 543305_546285
the outcome ? 546505_546885

+, and whoa I bombed that chemistry test +/. 552285_554565
+, oh okay +/. 554865_555725
+, so I did decent in the class all year got an A but man that AP test sure . 555905_561345
so your English language AP was a four . 561605_564085
mhm +/.
+, now that will give you some credit toward graduation . 564945_568065
it will give me credit ? 568465_569185

+, and I don't know I just wanted to find something that combined working with people and still having like my science knowledge and stuff . 1378385_1386045
one of the nice things about the requirements that you have to take that Doctor_Crown talked about +/. 1386635_1393035
mhm +/.

+, everything that goes on here . 1396255_1397175
you know you're gonna hafta take some humanities you're going to hafta take some social sciences you're going to hafta take some natural sciences that aren't in your concentration +/. 1397375_1404415
+, mhm +/.
+, and that means that you know you get a chance to look at all of these various areas that you probably haven't taken classes in before or that you have taken classes in before and that you're really you know interested in +/. 1405475_1416575
+, mhm +/.
+, that you want to keep on doing . 1416855_1418335
and so that's one of the reasons why you know we look <at the> at the placement tests and say +"/. 1419115_1424015
+" okay what is it that you need to do and what is it that you'd like to do +/. 1424315_1427575
+, mhm +/.
+, &-uh and you know that you need to elect either Great Books or Classical Civilization for your intro comp and for an honors requirement +/. 1428745_1436645
+, right +/.
+, and then after that if you're premed you really should be taking math and science . 1437785_1442505
+, right +/. 1442805_1442885
+, and chemistry is what you should be taking for the science +... 1443085_1446345
because even if you took AP +/. 1447645_1450645
+, uhuh +/.
+, and even if you got a four or a five it doesn't place you out_of the organic which is what the two ten two eleven is that you placed into . 1451145_1456985
oh I did ? 1457505_1457805

I_mean I could recognize the things like I remember seeing that I'd been working with this but I couldn't remember for the life of me like +/. 1482045_1488205

+, what to do . 1489145_1489625
alright well +... 1490625_1491205
I think probably given this score &=laughs:S3 I might suggest that you do take the one thirty . 1492785_1500845
really ? 1501165_1501445
&-uh some of it is going to &~s seem like repetition +/. 1503595_1505775
yeah +/.
+, but I think you want a really good solid basis in general chemistry before going on to organic . 1506635_1515255
although organic isn't very much like general chemistry . 1515875_1518255

⌊ so are &~y ⌋ .
⌈ so ⌉ what does that do for me applying with sophomore standing ? 2366095_2369815
it means that you get an earlier CRISP date and so you &-uh some of the courses that are typically sort_of first year student courses +/. 2370355_2379415
right +/.
+, you get a first whack at the them +/. 2380095_2381695
+, okay +/.
+, before some other first year students will . 2382255_2384075

+, so you know that's really pretty good . 2384955_2386855
+, mhm +/.
+, yeah . 2387175_2387775
so you want to do sort_of a premed curriculum or just a free +//. 2388175_2393235
a prebiology curriculum or how how have you thought about it ? 2393435_2396935
&-um I'm not really sure which way I wanna go with that so +/. 2397095_2400395
mhm +/.
+, I guess probably for now prebiology . 2401055_2404355
mkay .
you're very very lucky because premed and biology prerequisites premed requirements +/. 2405035_2412115
uhuh +/.
+, and biology prerequisites are identical . 2412695_2414815
+, right +/.
+, so you're really pretty lucky that way . 2415735_2418575
+, uhuh +/.
+, &-um and so let's see now Doctor_Crown explained to you about &-um how there're some courses that you have to take +/. 2419215_2428935
+, mhm +/.
+, and then some there's &~cer you have some choices and then you've got particular requirements that you must meet by the time you graduate and it's +/. 2429115_2436815
+, ⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ better ⌉ to do some early and some late and and so on . 2436955_2440175
okay &-um so your placement for chemistry was into the Chem one thirty which is the &-um first inorganic chemistry +/. 2440425_2451505
+, mhm +/.
+, it's the general chemistry class . 2451705_2452965
&-um your math placement's real good &-um and then for French you were placed into one oh three which is that sort of &-um mm that course kind of between the first and the second years +/. 2453975_2469695
+, mhm +/.
+, so if you decide to go on with French then you would need three semesters of French . 2470555_2474615
+, okay +/. 2475135_2475215
+, and the thing to do I don't know sometimes I advise students to think about it . 2475655_2481495
I_mean is French really what you want &-uh or is there another language that you're more interested in +/. 2481755_2486715
+, mhm +/.
+, what is this a Hungarian name ? 2486975_2489475
&-uh no Polish . 2490215_2491235

&-uh I saw that I saw the Z +/. 2493475_2495755

+, &-um so you know you might want to take Polish +/. 2496315_2501515
+, mhm +/.
+, because . 2501875_2503355
yeah I was thinking about whether or not I wanted to take a different language . 2503635_2506275
yeah . 2506495_2506615
you might wanna take Polish or you might say to yourself +"/. 2506935_2509375
+" well gee I want &-uh you_know I want biology or or biomedical engineering . 2509365_2516085

mhm +/.
+, &-uh and probably the answers are you know German and Russian . 2521365_2524185
so you might wanna think about German and Russian . 2524825_2526845
+, mhm +/.
+, I mean if you really like French there's no reason to change but if you are thinking about you know if you really want to start another language +/. 2527705_2536365
+, mhm +/.
+, or if you just see other languages out there that you know make more sense to you ? 2536785_2540045
that's something that you might think about . 2541325_2542705
if you are continuing with French I strongly advise that you do it right away . 2543305_2548045
+, uhuh +/.
+, you know . 2549145_2549285
that you sign up for French one oh three for the fall . 2549465_2551345
if you're thinking about another language then you can wait a year or even two . 2551945_2557105
&-uh (be)cause you need the equivalent of two years +/. 2558765_2561125
+, okay +/.
+, and as long as you start by the beginning of your junior year you know you're fine +... 2561865_2565505
+, okay +/.
+, so &-uh have you thought about whether you're more interested in Great Books or Classical Civilization ? 2569745_2578745
I wasn't really sure what the Classical Civilization is about . 2579565_2583905
Classical Civilization is really a course in &-um cultural history +/. 2584525_2589105
mhm +/.
+, so &-um oh the examples I use is the example I always use is +//. 2590505_2595945
you know if you look at the Iliad okay which is an epic by Homer and it talks about the Trojan war which is the assault on Troy by the Greeks led by Agamemnon and &~Tele Telemachut not &~Telem not Telemachus . 2596385_2611485
ugh God .
I've got my I've got my Greeks mixed up . 2612765_2617325
but +... 2618505_2618625
and the hero of the Iliad is Achilles +/. 2620985_2625205
+, mhm +/.
+, really . 2625805_2626385
he is the great warrior . 2626805_2628825
and the whole story of the Iliad really basically is Achilles' wrath . 2630005_2636965
he is angry he is angry at Agamemnon for having taken away his prize of war which is a beautiful young woman . 2637885_2647025
+, mm +/.
+, and so he says I won't fight . 2649025_2651485
and when he says he &~won he isn't gonna fight then the Greeks start losing . 2652705_2658145
and Hector who is the great warrior on the Trojan side stirs up the Trojans and they <win and> win and win . 2658735_2665895
and so the whole +//. 2667195_2668595
a_lot_of this is why does Achilles not fight ? 2669275_2672475
what are these issues about ? 2672855_2674275
what are these themes that are being dealt with +/. 2674515_2677815
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ in the ⌉ Iliad ? 2678075_2678815

what is glory ? 2682795_2683775
what is anger ? 2684295_2685155
what is wrath ? 2685395_2686015
what is mm what really is the relationship between the warrior <and his> and his leader ? 2686515_2697275
you know things like that but &~th you know you're talking about themes and motives primarily and allusions and you're talking about it as a work of art as literature . 2698175_2706735
when you do the Iliad in Classical Civilization and you really have practically the same reading list in Classical Civilization as you do in in Great Books +/. 2707155_2715595
+, mhm +/.
+, you're looking at the Iliad as a &-uh <as a> &~historica as a as an historical document . 2716355_2723835
so what does this tell us about the governance of the Greek warrior states city states ? 2724235_2730635
what does this tell us about warfare ? 2730775_2732775
what does this tell us about their religion ? 2733055_2735195
what does this tell us about their state of technology and economics ? 2735795_2739435
so it +/. 2739995_2740195

+, mhm +/.
+, &-um because you're still doing the same literary works it isn't as though you're losing out on that +/. 2764365_2769905

+, mhm +/.
+, then Great Books might make more sense . 2785285_2786945
I think I'd probably wanna go with Great Books . 2787485_2789365
yeah about ninety percent of the students do . 2789645_2791845
mhm +/.
+, and it's it's a course that has a great following . 2792785_2795965

I'm up on North Campus . 2806985_2808405
oh okay . 2808785_2809225
so if you do decide on Great Books and it sounds like you're going to &-um tomorrow let's +//. 2809845_2814865
tonight in fact ask the &-um peer advisors +/. 2815245_2818385
mhm +/.
+, in the computing center to figure out &-uh the Bursley section of Great Books into your schedule . 2819125_2826005
because there's a section of Great Books recitation +/. 2826605_2830505
+, mhm +/.
+, that is only intended for Bursley students so it'll have all the people who are in honors in Bursley +/. 2831345_2835965
+, uhuh +/.

alright . 2842625_2842665
okay ? 2842905_2843145
mhm .
so do you have any questions for me ? 2843525_2845665
&-um I don't know I was wondering if whether like what kind of classes I should be taking . 2846145_2852525
should I take like math or chemistry ⌊ the first semester ⌋ ? 2852525_2855905
⌈ well you should take ⌉ chemistry you should take French you should take either Great Books or Class Civ and then for math you've got some options +/. 2855905_2865445
mhm +/.
+, because <you can> &~dec you can decide on whether you should take Honors Math or non Honors Math . 2866205_2872305
your math +/. 2872465_2872905
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ score ⌉ your ACT is very good your math placement score is very good . 2873245_2878025

+, to me you look like a pretty obvious candidate for Honors Math . 2878565_2881725
+, right +/. 2882225_2882625
+, so now the question becomes one eighty five or two ninety five . 2883165_2887745
and that's where we've gotta do some thinking and that's where you've gotta do some thinking +/. 2890125_2895085

your scores say you'd be fine but if you're lacking that gee I love math <then that's> then that's something you oughta think about . 2954605_2962905
what about one fifty six ? 2963445_2964685
one fifty six is fine for people who have AP credit for one fifteen . 2965265_2968965
