one boy had a frog .

one time he had a rest .
and the dog did too .
and his frog got away .
and when he got up he realized that his frog was gone .
<and> and the dog checked again .
&-um and he checked in his &-um boots .
and the dog got stuck in that .
the dog jumps down .
and &-um the boy gets mad at him .
and the dog &-um licks him .
&-um and he sees a bee hive and looks down where an animal is .
and the dog looks up where the &-um bee hive is .
and there's the chipmunk .
and there's a dog at the bee hive .
and the bee hive drops .
and the bees are going after the dog .
and the kid went up to the tree to see what was in there .
and then a owl came out .
and he fell down while the dog was trying to run away from the bees
and the &-um &-um parrot &-um flew away and got mad at him .
and he sat up and was looking for his dog even_though he was right
and then he tripped over &-um &-um a deer's antlers .
and he ran .
and they fell off .
and they splashed into the water .
www .
they felt good .

and they went up on to a log to find the frog .
and then they found him .
and then they got him .
and &-um they left all of the rest of the frogs there .
and they went back home .

&-um well +...
this boy had a frog .
they were happy they had a frog .
&-um and the frog wasn't happy he was in a can .
so &-um the boy got up on his bed and had a rest .
and so did the dog .
<and> and the frog got away .
<and when they got> and when they &-um got up they realized
and they were sad that they didn't have it .
so they started looking for it .
and the dog got stuck in the can .
and then the boy opened up the window and started yelling .
I wonder what he was yelling .
what do you think he was yelling Mike ?
come back frog .
www .
and <then the> then the dog jumped down because he wanted to
and &-um he fell down .
and it broke .
and then the boy got down and decided he was mad .
and the dog looked vexed .
and then the boy started yelling for the frog again .
and the dog found a bee hive .
and the boy &-um found a squirrel hole .
and the dog was looking at that bee hive .
and a squirrel hit him .
you know what ?
I see here he has his hands on his nose and I wonder why .
oh .
a skunk .
0 .
<and then the dog> after that he jumped off and knocked the
and it broke .
and the bees were mad because the honey from the bee hive was
so the bees started chasing after the dog .
and the boy paid no attention .
climbed up on to this .
looked in .
what might he be saying as he looks in there ?
are you in there frog ?
and &-um <then the> then &-um a parrot came out .
and he fell down .
and the bees are chasing after his dog .
<and> and the parrot flew away .
and he was mad .
and he started yelling for &-um the &-um frog .
and the dog was down there .
and then he fell on a deer's head .
<and> and the deer ran .
you know what Mike ?
I wonder how does the boy feel now that he's on the deer's head ?
sad .
I think so .
I think he would be sad .
<and then> and then <they> they &-um fell down .
and they were scared because they thought it was a hard ground .
and &-um they fell in the water .
and then when they got up <they> &-um they thought it felt good
yeah .
and I wonder why he has his hand up to his ear .
&-um he might have heard the frog ?
he might have .
yes .
so he went over to the log .
<and> and he needs his dog to stop barking .
and they look over it .
and they saw two frogs .
<and when they were in> and when they were going to get down
and how does the boy feel now ?
&-um &-um &-um confused because he doesn't know which frog he had .
that would be confusing .
so then one of the big frogs let &-um him have one of the baby
and then they started walking back home .
is he saying something to those frogs ?
bye .
and then they go home
