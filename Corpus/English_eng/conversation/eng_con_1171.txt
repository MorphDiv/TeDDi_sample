Oh yes . 92165_92395
today . 92395_92745
Oh yeah . 92745_93155
Not the question of the same horses doing a different job . 93315_95865
No that 's a different type of horse er . 95865_97545
Yes . 97835_98255
er the old fashioned working horses er practically extinct . 98255_104925
Yes . 105325_105805
And the shires are still there fairly strong still er some of
Mm . 114885_115045
Er registered you see Er Welsh colts and things of that nature are
But would I be right in saying that the everyday working horse the
Yeah . 142155_142265
not a purebred anything . 142265_143725
Not a pure no . 143725_144115
They 'd be good old heavy honest rough . 144115_146535
Yeah Yeah yeah . 146535_147285
hard working horses . 147285_148585
That 's right . 148585_148815
Not things of beauty really at all . 148815_150385
No No ooh no no . 150655_151395
And you hardly ever see that type now do you Gypsies . 151395_154165
No . 154165_154225
have them You still . 154225_155505
They were . 155505_155625
see gypsies with that sort . 155625_156715
built for strength . 156715_157635
Yes . 157635_157805
for the . 157805_158095
Yeah . 158095_158195
jobs . 158195_158425
Yes . 158425_158695
Work . 158695_159065
Yes . 159195_159435
Were they . 159435_159565
Yeah . 159645_159965
Purely for . 159965_160295
Yeah . 160295_160565
work and hardiness . 160565_161545
And they 're ornaments today they are n't working horses . 161545_164135
That 's right . 164135_164545
You put these horses into hard work today they 'd be dead within
Would they . 168395_168875
Ooh yes Yeah . 169015_170375
Yes the whole scene has altered And er as I say observing this and
Yeah . 203285_203375
Mm . 203375_203535
Would you like to tell us a bit more about that . 203855_205225
Well yeah that is I 'm I mean that 's a completely different er er
Yes . 224025_224595
is the hind legs in the front . 224675_226115
Yes . 226375_226785
they have a tendency to open them make them wider apart . 226785_229775
Oh yes . 229775_229895
by the backs . 229895_230625
G A I T . 230625_231415
That 's right that kind of gait . 231415_232455
By the back and swop them you see Well er with a driving horse that
Yes . 243755_243955
and have a tendency to punt the back . 244045_246785
Really . 247325_247575
so that pushes the legs fo closer together do you see . 247575_250905
Good heavens . 251045_251605
They 're more likely to . 251605_252065
And then they 're more likely to hit they 're more likely to hit .
Mm . 254545_254605
the front legs with the back legs . 254685_256995
Really . 256995_257125
when they 're going especially going down hill . 257615_259245
And of course there 's a word in the trade for that is n't there .
Yeah Forging . 262005_262295
What is it . 262295_262605
It 's what now there 's a . 263015_263935
Forging . 263935_264305
completely . 264305_264765
Yeah . 264765_264875
different use for the word forging . 264875_267075
Now is it related to forging ahead in any way Oh do is that where
I . 272585_272615
from When you 're really pushing . 272615_274055
Yeah yeah pushing . 274055_274345
It might well be It might . 274345_276385
Yes . 276385_276475
well be I would say the term . 276475_278295
And and then they can . 278295_278795
forging ahead has come from the use of that word in relation to
Yes . 284005_284135
Yes . 284135_284395
I would say because that . 284395_285305
Yeah probably . 285305_285725
dates back many many years does n't . 285725_287335
Yeah . 287335_287395
it . 287395_287495
Yeah . 287685_287965
Yes Because they . 288005_289305
That 's it . 289305_289535
do do it when they 're pushing ahead . 289535_290665
Yeah . 290665_290815
they they hit the front foot with the hind one . 290815_293135
Good Lord . 293135_293435
Occasionally you . 293435_294075
Yeah . 294075_294135
hear them do it . 294135_294895
Oh . 295325_295605
when they 're driving it 's quite a sharp . 295605_297265
Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 297305_297785
crack you . 297785_297995
Yeah . 297995_298095
hear . 298095_298185
It 's amazing . 298185_298505
Mm . 298505_298625
Er so that 's that 's completely different do you see So the
Mm . 305025_305335
Completely different . 305435_306275
If they do it too much then the farrier 's not doing a good job . 306275_309585
Job . 309585_309885
and his job . 310055_310885
Really . 310885_311035
is to re-balance the shoe so that er it just misses . 311035_315375
Miss . 315475_315755
the front foot as it comes forward If the . 315755_318445
Right . 318445_318595
if the horse is travelling fast on the road he 's at the trot I
Yes . 323095_323105
the done thing for driving horses to canter or gallop on the road
No . 326885_327245
Erm but at the trot when th the the legs are moving the diagonals
Ah that 's it . 335795_336585
at one point in the gait . 336585_337555
Yeah . 337555_337745
and if the . 337745_338545
Yes . 338565_338645
shoe is slightly wrongly balanced or the foot is slightly wrongly
Yeah . 345365_345435
also get what we call brushing do n't you . 345435_347245
Brushing When they . 347245_347665
Tell Edith about that . 347665_348835
when they hit both legs together like the hind legs when they they
They really they . 355785_356185
with other one you see . 356185_356825
They really . 356825_357035
Ooh . 357085_357385
wear . 357385_357475
They give it a . 357475_358545
a a a sore place . 358545_359125
Ooh yes . 359125_359425
on the . 359425_359815
Yes . 360165_360225
Like us banging our ankles like that . 360225_361735
That 's it . 361735_362215
Yes Yes . 362215_362375
Yeah . 362375_362955
They do it on what we call the coronet . 362955_364545
Yeah . 364545_365045
which is of course the little junction between the skin and the
Yeah . 368955_369195
Ooh . 369195_369515
Very tender place It 's like the quick of our nail . 369515_372365
Ooh yes . 372365_372885
where the . 372885_373575
I can imagine . 373605_373925
tissue grows from And they do . 373925_375595
And on the front . 375595_376095
damage their coronet . 376095_377045
On the front one they do it on the knee which is the er do you see
Yes . 383155_383435
Yeah . 383665_384225
But the knee comes sort of out . 384225_385895
Out . 385895_386055
does n't it Er inside . 386055_386485
Yeah Yeah . 386485_387515
there 's a . 387515_387875
Yeah . 387875_387905
nobble . 387905_388125
Yeah . 388125_388575
Yes . 388815_388995

Yeah yeah . 389625_389925
Yes . 389925_390015
Yeah so and that 's what they call cutting . 390205_393115
Mm . 393115_393455
Yeah . 393455_393515
Mm . 394325_394575
Really . 394575_394665
Yes . 395165_395495
Yeah . 395495_395775
Yes . 395775_396065
You 'd never dream And so people who go and usually into horses
Well er . 403625_404945
They should know about it . 404945_405625
They should know it . 405625_406185
Yes . 406185_406245
They should know it But er . 406245_407585
But it mainly it 's the farrier 's job to know . 407585_409665
Yes . 409665_409795
But course they do n't er . 410205_411485
It 's his responsibility . 411485_411715
they do n't do enough work to really create any problems today do
Yes . 420765_421035
they 're out half an hour . 421035_423665
Yes . 423665_424035
Hey We 'll go out for a drive probably out an hour whereas years
Course . 435445_435885
Probably later than that . 435885_437345
Mhm . 437345_437695
He 'd go the driving horses they 'd probably go to Wickham market
Yes . 454185_454635
0 .
And they really earned their . 455095_456915
Then they 'd go to Norwich . 456915_457775
keep . 457775_458015
Full time job . 458015_458445
Ooh they worked hard . 458445_458805
And then they 'd go to Norwich on the Saturday . 458805_460375
Mm . 460375_461065
I mean they 'd they 'd they 'd be doing probably anything up to
Would be Yeah . 468655_469715
Yes And I mean that was six days a week . 470395_472145
Yes . 472145_472615
But now they do er twenty minutes they think they 'd have done
0 .
Yes . 479415_479705
Or go from pub to pubs . 479735_480995
You know . 480995_481215
that 's about it . 481215_482125
Yeah . 482125_482215
0 .
And you think of these for instance Prince . 482215_484715
Mm . 484715_485085
Yeah . 485085_485145
Phillip who is . 485145_485885
Yeah Yeah . 485885_486565
presumably those horses do n't do long spells of that sort . 486745_489995
No . 489995_490085
of driving . 490085_490355
No No . 490355_490805
They 'll be exercised in other ways I imagine will they . 490995_493475
Exercised yeah they 're exercised normal exercise during the week
On the stage coaches yes . 511045_512275
Mhm . 512275_512365
Stage coaches . 512365_512765
Mhm . 512765_512995
Yes . 512995_513195
Er on the horses that 's understandable they can start off and
They 're tired . 524615_525055
They 're tired . 525055_525805
Mhm . 525805_526465
er and then they start and that 's when the trouble starts . 526855_530255
Just as we do walking a bit less . 530255_531625
Yes . 531625_531785
carefully . 531785_531915
Yeah Yeah . 531915_532395
Yes Yes the same . 532395_533425
Yeah . 533425_533665
thing applies . 533665_533905
Mm . 533905_534455
Exactly . 534455_534695
Mm . 534695_535425
And . 535605_535805
What about er in those days er possibly a few still when erm let's
Mm . 544755_544765
or let's say just erm odd tradesmen had a horse or a pony or
Yeah . 554455_554795
or something what about the amount of care they would get from a
Well they they got reasonable care because like I said that was
That 's the thing I suppose yes . 570505_572125
and he treated his horse well I mean a lot of these horseman good
I would n't be surprised about that . 579425_581005
Ooh yes . 581005_581585
Living in the East . 581585_582735
Yes . 582735_582845
End I would n't be surprised . 582845_583875
Mm mm . 583885_583985
at that . 583985_584455
Oh yes Er and they thought of I mean they thought the world of
Yes . 590795_591395
er when you were in the trade like mine if you did n't do a good
Yes . 606745_606855
Some villages had two . 606855_608935
Mhm . 608935_609335
And if you did n't do the job properly you did n't get the job and
Course . 615185_615335
So that er that made you do it properly . 616615_619245
Yes . 619245_619525
Yes they were a . 619525_620685
And there was no there was no if you had n't earned a shilling you
That 's right Necessity being a good driver . 626665_628745
Absolutely . 628745_628825
Well yeah Yeah . 628825_630535
Erm Hector often quotes one particular instance which illustrates
Yeah . 640585_640695
in your own business and everything er people often say what did
Six and eight pence yes . 650205_650845
heavy horse a land horse such as a Suffolk as most of them were erm
Yeah . 670195_670505
and one of them was doing them a halfpenny cheaper . 670505_673385
Ooh . 673385_673415
Six and seven pence halfpenny . 673485_675675
Halfpenny . 675675_675995
And the farmer thought that it would . 675995_677845
Payed him to do it . 677875_678915
to send them an extra mile each way and the extra . 678915_681805
Really . 681835_681975
time that took to get them shod a halfpenny cheaper And things were
As tight as that . 686155_686965
Yeah . 686965_687215
Yes . 687215_687365
Yeah . 687365_687465
Yes . 687465_687695
Mm . 687695_687995
So . 688335_688545
I suppose now would could that possibly be called a false economy
It probably was . 693125_693835
time . 693835_693935
Well if that was I meant that would be today . 693935_696685
Yes . 696685_696925
but er in them days there was no such thing as false economy I 'd
No . 704575_704815
else he 'd of I mean . 704815_705535
No . 706125_706255
er . 706255_706295
People did n't set the same cost value on time as they . 706295_710805
Time . 710805_711155
I was going to say time . 711155_711745
do now . 711745_711995
did n't count in the same . 711995_712945
No and er . 712945_713285
It really did n't seem to . 713285_714155
No . 714165_714175
it 's very funny that . 714255_714855
Mm . 714855_715115
If you 're if you had n't earned the money well you did n't go into
No . 723145_723575
in to look at the job did you Just thought . 723575_725755
That 's right . 725755_726115
well we 'd better pull ourselves together and see if we can put
That 's right . 729065_729965
Er you never really went into it to see where you had lost the
No No . 734055_734495
Er but you just grabbed a little harder so that you made ends meet
That 's right By the result you . 739145_741235
Yeah Yeah . 741235_741795
would see that you had to work a bit . 741795_743255
Yeah . 743545_743685
harder and . 743685_743815
There was no no working out to see how you could do anything
No No . 747365_747905
No . 747905_748585
Aha . 748585_748895
But any economy that was made or in the early days of Hector 's er
0 .
Yes . 760525_760915
Erm and the instinct remains does n't it . 760915_764375
Oh yeah . 764435_764705
Your your instinct is to save . 764705_765965
a bit harder . 766185_766295
an odd bit of se steel or iron off a bar which the modern man would
0 .
no point in saving that because by the . 771905_773575
That 's right . 773615_774135
time you 've looked . 774135_774555
Yeah . 774555_774685
for it and found it when you want it er it would have paid you to
That 's it Time costing as much . 779325_780845
Yes . 780845_781205
as it now does . 781205_781625
Time now . 781625_781825
Yeah that 's right . 781825_782825
is er is the main driving thing but in your early days it was
Oh material every time . 787325_788465
Erm tell Edith . 788465_789335
Labour . 789335_789395
about some of the er er oh normal economies that were made like erm
Well oh well the horse . 794495_795555
into staples and all that sort of thing . 795555_797525
well the horse shoes you see we used to we used to weld one and a
Really . 807355_807555
Ooh yes They were n't thrown . 807555_809925
One turned the other way on top . 809925_810975
We . 810975_811075
of the other . 811075_811575
used to get one shoe and a ta in the middle so that so that cut the
Yes . 817795_818245
turn it over on itself then the other one we used to half . 818245_822215
Oh . 822215_822415
and put the other piece in between the two and make a sandwich . 822415_826655
Golly yes . 826655_826905
so you 'd got a piece that shape half new one . 826905_830245
Yes . 830245_830605
and that was all welded together in the fire into a straight bar .
And then you 'd start all over again . 835095_836735
and then you 'd start all over again . 836735_837745
Oh I see You did n't use . 837745_839515
Mm . 839515_839745
that as a shoe you then . 839755_840415
Re 0 .
made it an a new . 841025_841965
Re-shape it . 841965_842135
piece of metal . 842135_842715
Yes And then . 842715_843085
Yes . 843085_843315
yeah and then re re-used it to shoe . 843315_844325
Mm . 845105_845215
Made another shoe out of a . 845215_846635
That 's right . 846635_847375
er . 847375_847615
yes . 848455_848485
And that was a genuine economy then . 848485_849445
Oh yeah Yeah . 849445_850205
Yes . 850205_850705
Yes Yes . 850705_850855
Er . 850855_851105
Erm . 851565_851775
old cart tyres we used to split them up the middle and made shoes .
Did you . 856925_857385
Oh yes Er . 857385_858405
Because they were made of the right kind of iron . 858795_861145

Wired . 885005_885205
Old chains . 885205_885355
And . 885355_885455
when they wore thin on the end and we had to put a new link in we
Really . 895555_895635
Because the middle part of the link was n't worn you see that was
Yes course . 901585_901805
Yeah . 901805_902215
Is n't it tragic to think how far from that we 've moved . 902215_906215
Yes it is really . 906215_906785
Yeah mm . 906785_907395
Yes it 's . 907395_907925
And it 's so wasteful u . 907925_908615
it 's all throw away . 908675_909095
Yeah . 909095_909195

Yes . 910035_910095

Yeah yeah . 914475_914545
Mm . 914545_914885
It goes against the grain terribly . 914885_915735
And I am if at five minutes to five or five minutes to leaving off
Yes That was ready for next time and you 've saved . 931565_934255
That was ready for when Yeah . 934255_935835

Used the crome as the rake . 1135085_1137225
Aha . 1137225_1137595
Now could that be . 1137595_1138915
Mm mm . 1139095_1139615
the same sort of thing that Noel bought last year when he saw one
I expect so . 1145865_1147005
I expect so . 1147155_1147955
it 's er i and it 's got three prongs like that and there 's I
Ah that 'd be the modern ones . 1152555_1153765
Yes . 1153765_1153845
Yes that would be . 1153845_1154915
Yes . 1154915_1155185
the modern . 1155185_1155385
The modern one but er . 1155385_1155815
adaptation . 1155815_1156115
Yeah . 1156115_1156205
Yes . 1156205_1156385
That 'd be the modern one . 1156385_1157615
Similar principle . 1157615_1157905
Yes . 1157905_1158105
Sim sim 0 .
Mhm . 1158535_1158985
Yes . 1158985_1159075
Yeah . 1159075_1159245
It is . 1159245_1159595
Yeah . 1159595_1159925
erm for getting up a lot . 1159925_1161045
Yes . 1161045_1161375
of weed . 1161375_1161595
Yes . 1161595_1161685
Yeah . 1161685_1161985
The old style crome would be a thing about as wide as that . 1161985_1164635
Yeah about ten . 1164635_1165385
What about . 1165385_1165815
ten inches wi and the . 1165815_1166395
Mhm . 1166575_1166755
would be . 1166755_1167205
Yes and and the would be parallel . 1167205_1168695
Parallel . 1168695_1168795
four times would n't they . 1169105_1170545
Four . 1170545_1171095
And e equally distanced . 1171095_1171495
Fo for that work . 1171575_1171845
Ah yes . 1172215_1172495
Mhm . 1172495_1172785
But for pulling the muck out of the tumble they only have two . 1172785_1176755
Oh . 1177155_1177355
Two tines . 1177355_1177765
Did they . 1177835_1178835
Yeah . 1179105_1179295
More like a pitch fork bent at right angles then . 1179295_1183015
But bent at right angles . 1183015_1183815
Yes . 1183815_1183935
That would be a muck crome . 1183935_1184725
That 'd be a muck . 1184725_1185735
Yes . 1185745_1185755
crome Yeah . 1185755_1185915
And was a lot of straw in with that . 1185915_1187745
Oh that was all straw do you . 1187745_1189375
Ah . 1189375_1189595
see . 1189595_1189995
Because otherwise you could n't have pulled . 1189995_1191195
No . 1191195_1191355
er sort of muck without . 1191365_1192285
No no . 1192285_1192685
No . 1192685_1193065

No no . 1193855_1194035
No . 1194035_1194125

Yeah . 1194525_1194655
of course 0 .
Yeah . 1194875_1195465
Mhm . 1195675_1195925
Yeah And the tines on a muck crome are flat whereas the ones on an
I see . 1204635_1205245
Yeah . 1205245_1205375
Yes . 1205375_1205855
So I came across these things you see when we were first married
Mhm . 1215015_1215115
and of I 'd come across these words you see I 'd think crome Crome
Yes Even to spell it . 1220205_1221255
And gradually the . 1221255_1221975
in the first place . 1222165_1222985
Yeah . 1222985_1223045
you needed . 1223135_1223325
So I had to . 1223325_1223805
to know . 1224135_1224425
yeah so I did have to guess a great deal . 1224425_1225915
Mm . 1225915_1226175
because no good looking in the dictionary for a lot of these things
No . 1229015_1229245
No no no . 1229245_1230015
Mm . 1230015_1230095

mostly a short one because . 1295105_1296095
Mm . 1296095_1296575
that 's a lazy language the Suffolk dialect in n it . 1296575_1300175

True cockney is a treat to listen to . 1328535_1330605
That 's right . 1330605_1331385
But there 's a lot of adulterated cockney in the home counties I
Yes . 1336205_1336515

Er but it was interesting all the same It was interesting to hear
Indeed . 1352245_1352345

Exactly . 1377765_1377945
Mm . 1377955_1377965

That 's true is n't it . 1382825_1384105
Cos they are n't talking the queen 's English . 1384105_1384845
It 's taking a . 1384845_1385685
Yes . 1385695_1385705
long time for dialects to be accepted but I think I think that
Well I hope . 1390345_1391355
frankly . 1391515_1391685
it will universally because . 1391685_1392445
Mm mm . 1392445_1393015
I feel the Scots make a tremendous fuss about their . 1393015_1395795

And yet they 'll a . 1405285_1406085
But they . 1406155_1406555

That 's very true . 1420885_1421725

It 's also true that up in . 1422245_1423845
Mm . 1423845_1424225
Scotland they do n't like to hear English accents on their
Well I never . 1427935_1428705
They much prefer to have their own people . 1428705_1430855
Ooh . 1430855_1431165
But how often do we listen to a Scottish accent . 1431165_1433265

Suffolk people do n't . 1525098_1525748

They give you time to listen and time to think . 1526598_1528478
