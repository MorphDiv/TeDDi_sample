okay &-um couple things I'm just trying to tell you what's gonna go on next week . 1035_5895
keep you ahead &-um you know that the exam is coming up again the second exam on the twenty first . 6175_10955
please print out the exam that's in the &~coursepa or on the &-uh website . 11595_15115
you should be able by now to probably do half of it at least okay ? 15695_18835
&-um there's a huge area of Meselson_Stahl's experiment that was nonmultiple choice last semester that could help you &-um and I think if you get a head start on it you'll be better off . 19425_29505
&-um we're gonna be doing the Sordaria lab on Tuesday . 30245_32685
you will probably wanna read ahead on that &-um because he's not gonna be discussing that in lecture prior . 33465_39365
and then you'll also have a five point assignment I will probably give you something like chromosomes are at two n@l equals six please draw them in <this stage> <this stage> this stage etcetera . 39825_50365
okay so that's one more little five point assignment that you'll be getting . 50725_53825
Thursday you'll have another quiz okay ? 54545_55905
we wouldn't wanna let you &-uh sleep or anything . 56005_57525
and that will be over what he does next which I believe is transcription and translation and will also be over the Sordaria lab . 58265_64945
and today &-um we're gonna end with a quiz so you guys will have a chance to ask any questions that you might have and I'm ending with the quiz because we're gonna do the chromosome dance which I think will help you for the quiz prior to that hopefully . 65705_77625
but &-uh before that I wanna go over a couple things that you need before we actually start the chromosome dance . 79025_87445
and that involves genetic recombination and what does recombination mean ? 87985_92865
if I say there's recombination Meagan ? 93865_96245
isn't that when the chromosomes overlap ? 96405_97945
could be that's called what ? 99085_101205
crossing over .
okay crossing over . 102345_104705
and when does that occur ? 104905_105545
meiosis .
which phase ? 106405_108265
⌈ prophase ⌉ .
⌊ prophase one ⌋ . 109025_110405
okay . 110805_110825
so you could get crossing over and that would lead to recombination . 111125_113965
can you think of another way you can get recombination ? 114385_116125
something that's not like the parent . 116305_117825
mutations ?
okay mutation . 119465_120265
but something naturally occurring with the chromosomes . 120905_123105
a mixture of the paternal &~per paternal genes . 123865_127665
okay good . 128245_129305
&-uh I just wanna illustrate that for you . 129785_131425
I'll use the same alleles that we used on Tuesday . 131625_136845
&=writes:board and let me just say we've got dad here . 137345_141285
and you had A and B . 141905_143445
okay ? 143865_144125
so I'll just say he's big a@l big b@l +... 144205_146625
let's draw it small . 150175_150395
and he mates with mom who's little a@l little b@l . 150835_155195
okay these are unreplicated chromosomes or unduplicated . 156055_160135
which means they're probably in g@l one they need to go through the s@l phase . 160795_163895
fertilization occurs . 164575_165635
okay and they'll be brought together . 166775_168655
and it's just random where they're gonna go okay at this point . 170075_174535
because they're unduplicated . 177235_178635
okay ? 179895_180715
once they duplicate if we're talking about meiosis what happens ? 180895_186335
okay if they're duplicated what happens next ? 186655_188975
in prophase one ? 189675_190495
pairing ⌈ of the chromosomes ⌉ .
⌊ mkay ⌋ .
homologous chromosomes are going to pair so I'll just draw them paired &=pause_while_writing okay ? 192325_212425
and this is just one option of the way they could be paired . 212705_216185
and what I'm trying to show you is that genetic recombination can occur through something called independent assortment . 216665_224225
&=pause_while_writing and that's just a fancy way of saying random alignment of chromosomes at metaphase okay ? 227165_241525
&=pause_while_writing and you should be able to follow this through . 248225_250285
if this was call it metaphase one picture anaphase one okay ? 250985_258085
and you get a cell and telophase cytokinesis one you'd get a cell with big a@l big b@l . 258265_262905
and you'd have another daughter cell with little a@l little b@l . 263425_265605
if you can follow that through post meiosis two &=writes:board okay you should realize that you get four daughter cells okay that one would have a big a@l big b@l so would the other . 266185_279405
and then you'd have two daughter cells that just had little a@l little b@l in (th)em +... 280925_283845
this is after meiosis two and what do you notice about the way they look ? 286245_291925
these daughter cells . 292545_293185
&~hap haploid appearance .
okay they're haploid . 296555_297695
that was right . 298495_299035
and they also look like the parents the original parents . 299535_303055
and we call these parentals for obvious reasons okay . 303615_306395
&=writes:board we just get A B like dad little a@l little b@l like mom . 306615_310835
so these are called parentals +... 311255_312555
and there's been no recombination there okay ? 314215_318555
but equally likely since this is just the nucleoplasm and these things are floating around you could've had big a@l assort with little b@l . 319425_330805
okay or vice versa . 331985_333185
&=pause_while_writing so now post meiosis two you'd get something quite different you'd have a cell with big a@l little b@l (0.5) and little a@l big b@l +... 340985_352845
okay .
and they look different from the parents okay ? 356365_359925
you could assign any traits you wanted . 360065_362025
but they don't look like either parent and for that reason they're called recombinants . 363345_366945
&=pause_while_writing okay ? 371075_371375
so you guys should understand the distinction first of all understand why this is random okay ? 371915_376575
just random alignment in this fluid the nucleoplasm that can't distinguish who's lining up with who okay ? 376935_382835
if independent assortment occurs it's just as likely that you're gonna get the same number of parentals as recombinants . 384095_393055
okay ? 393675_393775
why why do we want recombinants ? 394115_397535
why is that important ? 397615_398255
why do we care ? 398645_399305
variation . 400225_401125
okay variation and that'll become important for evolution down the road . 401785_405545
okay ?
okay . 407045_408245
so that's independent assortment understand that you can get recombination through independent assortment . 408605_414745
&-um alternatively we could show crossing over okay ? 415425_418625
and what that would look like is let's say you had a reciprocal exchange between the A gene on chromatids two and three okay ? 419205_431145
what that would look like &=pause_while_writing would be something like this +... 431425_440445
b@l-s were not involved so they stay the same . 442165_446285
&=pause_while_writing and you should be able to follow this through and see why you wouldn't get all parentals here . 452475_458415
okay so after meiosis two just picture this you'd end up with four daughter cells &=pause_while_writing one with big a@l big b@l little a@l big b@l big a@l little b@l and little a@l little b@l okay . 460775_479835
and this would be a parental type . 481595_483115
these two would be recombinants and that would be a parental . 483595_486475
okay . 487655_487995
(0.7) if crossing over occurs it doesn't occur all the time okay ? 493015_500275
and it &~h so far we've just drawn one gene on a chromosome but there are hundreds . 500495_505015
so you could picture a crossover at any locus mkay ? 505635_508235
it may happen at one locus and not another . 508715_510655
so with crossing over you always get fewer recombinants than you do parentals . 511535_515995
okay ? 516755_516875
with independent assortment it's a fifty fifty balance +... 517015_520095
okay &-um any questions on that ? 521155_525495
this is gonna be real important next week when you start to do genetics problems . 525615_528475
okay ? 529055_529275
(0.4) good ? 532035_534075
okay . 534955_535935
&-uh one last thing before we actually fill in a table that we're gonna go around the room and discuss . 536025_540985
&-um sometimes there're errors that occur in meiosis particularly meiosis one okay ? 541985_548685
and those errors may happen early late metaphase . 548725_555145
&-um more particularly anaphase one . 555585_557705
okay when the chromosomes are supposed to separate and maybe they don't okay ? 558125_562565
so if &=pause_while_erasing in meiosis and I'll just put it in parentheses (be)cause it's most common in anaphase one +... 563085_579425
this is called nondisjunction and what it means is the chromosomes don't separate properly okay ? 582765_589045
and nondisjunction the reason I bring this up is because &-uh there's a table in your book we're gonna fill out next that mentions nondisjunction . 589365_596325
it's most common in meiosis one anaphase one &=pause_while_writing and what that might look like is let's just say it's time for anaphase one to occur . 596745_609025
you're used to one A chromosome going in one direction <the other> the other direction . 609565_615305
let's just say an error occurs . 615795_617495
and both a@l-s go to the left side of my cell and no a@l-s go to the right . 618155_622115
okay so I'd end up with cells +... 622675_626635
after telophase one that were diploid for the A allele . 628095_633495
(0.5) okay so this cell would be diploid for the A allele and you know that's not what usually happens okay ? 638775_644675
and this cell would have no A allele . 644835_647035
that's called nondisjunction this cell would die <this cell> this cell could persist imagine this being haploid okay undergoing a second meiosis maybe this is an egg . 647735_659995
sperm fertilizes it dad gives his copy of A to the egg and his copy of B and now you have a trisomy . 660945_671025
mkay ?
&-um you have three copies of the A chromosome and many times that's fatal . 671705_678465
okay ?
&-uh in human situations that's how Down's syndrome comes about . 679205_682425
we have three copies of the chromosome twenty one . 682645_685405
and those individuals tend to be fine . 685985_687645
&-um the other two chromosomes thirteen and eighteen that this more frequently happens to those individuals tend most of them will die before puberty mkay . 688165_697145
so this is nondisjunction and typically it occurs during meiosis one . 697445_702205
mkay +...
okay . 703385_703945
&-um before we do the chromosome dance in your course packs there's a table (0.4) that I'd like you to fill out . 707005_718905
&-um we've already talked quite extensively about the difference between mitosis meiosis one and meiosis two now without looking at your notes and this should help pretty extensively for the quiz too . 719545_733545
just try to fill in the table . 733875_735235
and we'll go around the room and see how you did . 735615_737395
yeah Bryant . 737535_737695
do you happen to have any copies of that ? 737955_739335
no <I'll go> I'll go get one though . 739995_742095
(be)cause mine's mine's filled in and that would be cheating . 742615_744295
&-um so try to fill these out . 744815_747475
I'll go get you a copy and we'll go around the room . 747675_750535
and what I want +//. 750835_751375
how I want this to run is let's say Joel says generates two diploid cells from a diploid . 751535_756015
and he says meiosis one if that's wrong jump on him okay and tell him why that's wrong okay ? 756195_760235
and you guys figure it out and let each_other know what's wrong versus me telling you . 760705_766225
okay . 766865_767125
so try that . 767385_767845
I'll be right back . 767965_768485
I don't know if you wanna pause it or not .
&=pause_while_working .
somebody's in the lost and found .
okay +/.
+, it's old though . 858155_858975
(0.4) .
so it's okay if I write on it ?
yeah it's from last semester so I don't think they're gonna come back . 859695_866875
mhm .
is it the same thing ? 869435_870995
hm ?
+, are there any differences ? 871675_872995
no no . 873655_874475
I don't have my book either . 875015_876235
you don't . 876615_876855
&=laughs alright .
(0.6) let me steal this for one second and make a copy . 886535_888275
you can make two .
&=laughs:multiple .
this is discussion you guys you're supposed to have this . 890735_894715
somebody stole mine you have no excuse . 896255_898415
I don't even know &=laughs +/.
+, someone stole mine you just left yours at home .
I don't even remember xxx .
I don't care .
you're supposed to be prepared for class each and every day .
what happened to the xxx ⌈ alright ⌉ .
⌊ I don't think it's that good because <I don't even them ⌋ I don't even have a word> .
xxx .
okay who else +..?
actually just use this and you can just write in the book .
thanks .
&=pause_while_working .
that's just (be)cause there're hardly any men in here . 1200445_1201965
&=laughs &=pause_while_working .
you guys ready ? 1237305_1237865
yeah +/. 1239865_1240585
+, yeah ?
yes .
okay . 1240845_1242185
how about if we start with Erin and just go around the room read your question and then say what you think . 1242545_1248905
and if you think Erin's wrong or anyone's wrong &-um tell (th)em . 1249105_1254565
I got a question real quick . 1254925_1256045
can it be &-um more than +/. 1256505_1258265
yeah +/. 1258505_1258765
+, one +/. 1258985_1259145
+, yeah +/. 1259385_1259565
+, okay . 1259625_1259885
okay ? 1261405_1262965
&{l=READING generates two diploid cells from a diploid cell . 1263205_1265925
&}l=READING I put mitosis . 1267385_1268245
and after she asked that question I'm thinking meiosis two because it's the same as mitosis . 1269605_1276045
what do you start with though in meiosis two ? 1278145_1280385
haploid .
right . 1281765_1284505
mkay so you end with haploids too . 1285765_1288505
so just mitosis . 1289825_1291405
everybody agree on that ? 1291765_1293565
mhm .
okay so remember you have to start out diploid in meiosis but after meiosis one you have two daughter cells that're haploid already . 1294225_1301085
mkay ?
those two daughter cells undergo a further reduction division to produce four haploids . 1301745_1306525
okay ? 1307805_1308125
&-uh &{l=READING generates two haploid cells from a diploid &}l=READING meiosis one . 1309865_1314205
I don't nope .
okay she sounds confident . 1321885_1322865
&=laughs:multiple is that your final answer ? 1323345_1324025
yeah .
&-uh everybody agree ? 1324785_1326085
no . 1326905_1327045
I put meiosis two .
no ?
okay somebody thinks it's also meiosis two ? 1328105_1330925
no .
no <that creates> four . 1332205_1333565
okay Maria's right . 1333885_1337485
&-um you get two haploid cells from a diploid cell . 1337825_1340625
why isn't it meiosis two ? 1340845_1343245
you get four .
and what do you start with ? 1343485_1346245
haploid .
haploid .
okay you start with a haploid . 1346465_1348205
remember it's diploid at the beginning then haploid haploid . 1348765_1351385
mkay ?
so it's just meiosis one . 1351905_1355245
&-um &{l=READING generates two haploid cells from a haploid cell . 1357545_1361245
&}l=READING meiosis two . 1361925_1362485
mkay everybody agree with that ? 1364625_1366525
mitosis .
mitosis . 1367545_1368445
okay mitosis . 1368745_1369485
remember that haploids can undergo mitosis as well so don't forget that you start out haploid you make two haploids . 1369605_1374645
and you have ⌈ drawings ⌉ +/. 1374885_1376405
⌊ is it both or ⌋ just +/.
+, sorry ? 1377605_1377885
is it both of (th)em or just mitosis ? 1378085_1379465
&-uh both of them . 1379925_1380545
mitosis and meiosis two +... 1380805_1381765
yep ?
so like how would if by mitosis which kind of cells like wouldn't be the diploid (be)cause you know how like how could it be a diploid anyhow for mitosis ? 1384645_1399645
&-um okay remember the the drawings that I gave ? 1400245_1403645
let's just say +//. 1403925_1405125
I'll just use two alleles . 1405145_1406505
well like for &-uh &-um prokaryote it would be like two haploid cells right ? 1406985_1412145
where it just the difference from like . 1413285_1415905
&~i yeah it doesn't necessarily hafta be prokaryotic on fungus there are many fungus that are haploid all their lives like Sordaria is . 1416805_1423025
but if you picture +//. 1423525_1424145
okay this is a haploid let's just say it has one chromosome okay . 1424365_1427705
and it can go through mitosis . 1428185_1430345
&=writes:board and there's metaphase it's lined up okay here's anaphase mkay and then telophase cytokineses would produce two haploids . 1430915_1439055
mhm +/.
+, okay ? 1440415_1440655
so any ploidy can undergo mitosis . 1440975_1443015
it's meiosis that you need the homologous pairing on multiple of two . 1443235_1447075
is that for one and two ? 1448275_1449415
sorry ? 1449735_1450035
is that for one and two just haploid for meiosis one and two ? 1450275_1454655
&-um well &~thi this was wait where are we here ? 1456705_1459465
two haploids from a haploid . 1461045_1462605
so that's mitosis and meiosis two . 1463325_1464885
okay ? 1465505_1469525
okay .
&{l=READING homologous chromosomes separate during anaphase &}l=READING I put meiosis two . 1471345_1476885
anybody agree disagree ? 1479105_1480805
disagree . 1481265_1481865
disagree . 1482065_1482405
disagree why ? 1482605_1482665
meiosis one . 1484645_1484845
okay meiosis one . 1485205_1486065
you don't have homologous chromosomes at meiosis two anymore remember because the homologues have separated out and meiosis two is similar to mitosis . 1486725_1494645
mkay ?
so the homologues don't pair anymore . 1495905_1497865
so it's just meiosis one . 1499285_1500505
(0.5) .
&-um &{l=READING sister chromatids separate during anaphase &}l=READING meiosis two . 1507145_1510525
okay anybody wanna add anything to that ? 1512075_1513715
mitosis . 1514035_1514875
mitosis . 1514875_1514955
okay . 1515635_1515815
so remember sister chromatids will &~g separate during anaphase . 1516095_1519735
they won't during meiosis one anaphase one okay ? 1520195_1524315
but they do in meiosis two anaphase two . 1524395_1527435
okay &-um &{l=READING sister chromatids are not necessarily identical &}l=READING &-um I put meiosis one ? 1528815_1536415
and two ? 1536555_1537535
and why might they not be identical ? 1539215_1541055
&-um (be)cause they might have different alleles . 1542155_1543995
from how ? 1545215_1546095
crossing over . 1546955_1548035
mkay .
good . 1548475_1549255
everybody agree with that ? 1549655_1552015
meiosis one and meiosis two you might have nonidentical Katrina ? 1552355_1557015
when does crossing over occur ? 1557115_1558795
prophase one meiosis one . 1559095_1560815
mkay ?
&{l=READING sister chromatids are identical . 1563815_1566415
&}l=READING &-uh mitosis and meiosis one . 1566815_1568515
&-uh &-um yeah they they could be &~iden if no crossing over occurs sure they could be identical &~i I mean &~i actually it could be all three as long as no crossing over no recombination occurs . 1569015_1580495
but you know they're identical absolutely in mitosis for sure . 1582075_1585155
okay there's never any crossing over in mitosis . 1585475_1587015
okay .
+, so that's that's kind_of an arbitrary . 1587495_1589215
okay . 1590715_1591015
&-um &{l=READING DNA replicates prior to prophase . 1591875_1594075
&}l=READING I put mitosis and meiosis one . 1595095_1596395
mkay .
everybody agree with that ? 1596795_1599155
that you have replication the s@l phase prior to mitosis and meiosis one . 1599555_1603215
no .
why's this ?
why isn't it in mitosis I mean <meiosis two> ? 1604535_1608235
why what ? 1608795_1609675
why not be be okay think of what you end up with after meiosis one . 1609895_1614515
you end up with haploids . 1614715_1617915
&=writes:board but they're duplicated already right ? 1618315_1622295
they're still duplicated because the centromere has not divided . 1622395_1625075
mitosis and meiosis one +/.
+, mkay so they wouldn't duplicate again . 1627155_1630295
you're trying to reduce the amount of genetic information during meiosis two . 1630435_1634215
okay and that is what happens . 1634815_1636095
so the answer is mitosis and meiosis one ? 1636495_1639575
right . 1639635_1639935
(0.5) .
oh okay &-uh &{l=READING DNA does not replicate prior to prophase . 1643135_1649375
&}l=READING I just have meiosis two . 1652125_1653125
mkay .
is there anybody disagree ? 1653485_1655305
wants to admit it ? 1657105_1658385
no ? 1658545_1658625
okay . 1658845_1660485
&{l=READING crossing over can occur &}l=READING I put meiosis one and two . 1662785_1665425
actually . 1666385_1666605
wanna take something back ? 1668325_1669605
&-um not meiosis two . 1670645_1674725
mkay yeah just meiosis one . 1675025_1676465
why can't it occur during meiosis two ? 1676585_1678785
(be)cause they don't have homologous chromosomes . 1681285_1682865
right there's only one copy they're haploid then there's no &~ho homologue to pair with and cross with okay . 1683205_1688385
&{l=READING nondisjunction can occur &}l=READING I put &-um meiosis one . 1689385_1692665
okay . 1693185_1693445
nobody would disagree with that right since you just learned about nondisjunction &=laughs a moot point . 1693945_1698125
&-uh &{l=READING centromeres divide &}l=READING I put mitosis and I think does that happen in meiosis two ? 1699745_1709425
yeah +/.
+, that's what I put +/.
+, yeah +/. 1709785_1709985
+, but I wasn't sure .
does everybody like that ? 1712805_1714425
centromeres don't divide ?
no centromeres don't divide remember ? 1714805_1718305
why don't they ? 1718445_1718925
(be)cause isn't it the whole chromosome though ? 1719685_1721205
why ? 1721885_1722205
spindle attached to the wrong side . 1722905_1724365
right the spindle fiber's only attached on one side of the chromosome whoever asked that so they can't it just pulls one chromosome that way and one the other way . 1724705_1732385
unless nondisjunction occurs okay ? 1732485_1734305
&{l=READING individual chromosomes align at equatorial plate during metaphase . 1735965_1739985
&}l=READING &-um I said mitosis and meiosis two . 1740285_1743385
okay . 1743985_1744365
both with mitosis and meiosis one because they're &~l I'm sorry two because they're lining up single file . 1744685_1749985
&-um &{l=READING homologous pairs of chromosomes align at the equatorial plate during metaphase &}l=READING meiosis one . 1750985_1758025
okay . 1758985_1759385
everybody agree with that ? 1760025_1761445
mhm .
Rebecca . 1765025_1765445
&{l=READING &-um occurs in sematic cells &}l=READING &-uh mitosis ? 1765745_1768205
mkay sematic cells is mitosis . 1768705_1770365
so sex cells whoa . 1771505_1773365
&{l=READING occurs in sex cells &}l=READING meiosis one and meiosis two . 1773645_1776525
mkay meiosis one and two are for sex cells . 1776705_1779185
&{l=READING produces two daughter cells that are &~genen genetically identical to each_other and to the parent cell . 1780265_1786765
&}l=READING mitosis and meiosis two . 1787285_1789385
and what ? 1790045_1790485
meiosis two . 1790945_1791525
we're talking the the very original parent . 1793095_1795195
mhm +/.
+, so how does the original parent start out ? 1797075_1801515
in meiosis ? 1801695_1802915
what's its ploidy ? 1803535_1804695
meiosis is haploid . 1805435_1808875
right ?
&=laughs xxx .
anyone wanna help her out ? 1811875_1813835
meiosis hasta start out diploid why ? 1814575_1816595
mm so it can breed and cover one another .
because it can't replicate within meiosis .
right you hafta have a homologous pair okay ? 1822895_1825635
so you hafta have two of each so you have to at least have some I don't know some &-uh multiple of two . 1825775_1833335
so I'm just trying to get to the final answer why why it's not meiosis two . 1834535_1838415
if it starts out diploid what're your four products of meiosis ? 1839015_1841855
what's the &~pro the ploidy of your four end products of meiosis two . 1842055_1845615
they're haploid .
they're haploid right . 1847575_1848535
so can they be identical to the original parent ? 1848585_1851625
no . 1852205_1853305
they ⌈ have half the genetic ⌉ . 1853585_1854625
⌊ I thought that they meant ⌋ the original original . 1854625_1856045
⌈ like the ⌉ . 1857245_1857945
⌊ they do ⌋ and the original original is diploid . 1858025_1861205
okay +/. 1861465_1861725
+, and and so the progeny of the gametes have half the genetic information <as the> as the parent . 1861845_1866865
&-um &{l=READING produces two daughter cells that're not genetically identical to each_other and to the parent cell . 1867385_1874645
&}l=READING meiosis one and meiosis two . 1875185_1876405
mkay ?
everybody agree ? 1878155_1878975
okay . 1879235_1881735
I ⌈ think it ⌉ .
⌊ do cells ⌋ either have to like go through mitosis or meiosis one and two ? 1882615_1887055
yeah if you're a germ cell and you're gonna become a sex cell you undergo meiosis . 1887775_1891255
mkay if you're another type of cell in the body you undergo mitosis . 1891995_1894535
right so they never go through like all three . 1895015_1897735
&-um actually germ cells do . 1898655_1900255
&~li okay picture this . 1900475_1901315
a sperm and an egg come together fertilization occurs you have a single diploid zygote okay it's a single cell it's diploid . 1901645_1910025
somehow you have to grow into a multicellular being that includes the germ cells . 1910465_1914585
so mitosis occurs in each of you know skin cells nerve cells germ cells . 1915465_1919765
and the germ cells &~s starts out diploid . 1920145_1922005
okay ? 1922805_1922905
and then when it's going to become a sperm or an egg it goes through meiosis . 1923065_1926105
but the germ cell's the only one that will go through both . 1926565_1928205
okay we don't wanna leave you guys out . 1929715_1931335
&-um Katrina why is it important to +/. 1932035_1934855
oh my +/.

(0.4) .
I don't understand the question . 1948075_1952375
&-um it's right there the crucial difference between mitosis and meiosis is encapsulated by the statement mitosis is a mechanism for constancy okay ? 1950315_1957975
so if you have a liver cell why is it important to make more liver cells ? 1957975_1964155
why do you want identical an identical clone of cells ? 1965175_1968975

&-um (0.5) because if it's the liver cell you want more &-uh you wouldn't want it to be like +... 1973025_1987105
I don't know . 1990605_1991125
anyone wanna help ? 1991125_1993105
constancy ?
for the purpose of regeneration like for instance with your skin . 1993445_2000285
okay . 2002355_2002555
Bridget's saying for regeneration obviously if you want a skin cell you want that same clone of skin cells you you don't want it mutated so it's an abnormal skin cell . 2002715_2010395
&-um you don't want a liver cell growing in place of it so you wanna turn genes on that're going to express liver proteins or whatever to make a liver cell and turn those off that don't mkay ? 2010655_2020455
versus Rasheda why would you want diversity in meiosis ? 2021075_2025955

if everything was the same there'd be nothing for natural selection to act on okay ? 2047665_2051765
&-um and we're gonna start getting into natural selection pretty soon pretty much after exam number two mkay ? 2053025_2059365
okay Joel . 2059405_2060345
does chance play a role in either mitosis or meiosis ? 2060565_2062845
meiosis .
mkay .
and how ? 2063565_2065785
how is there chance ? 2066385_2067125
recombination crossing over nondisjunction . 2067445_2069885
mkay ?
crossing over nondisjunction or just independent assortment . 2070585_2073225
just the random role of about lining up chromosomes mkay during metaphase . 2073405_2076605
okay &-um this is a real good test for you guys to take again and like right before the exam it should +//. 2077555_2085155
if you can just answer these questions cold and don't hafta to look up in your notes you should be pretty well prepared for the exam as long &~a as you can draw things mkay ? 2085315_2093435
&-um okay hopefully this will help with the quiz as well this little chromosome dance simulation . 2094075_2101775
&-um basically this is set up to illustrate human chromosomes . 2102305_2106005
you guys are gonna be human chromosomes we're gonna start with four unreplicated human chromosomes and then you're gonna duplicate yourselves mkay ? 2106385_2114245
and I've got some alleles here . 2114425_2117645
being sort_of sex biased I have big b@l being bad breath little b@l being fresh . 2118145_2123405
big c@l being crabby little c@l being cheerful . 2123965_2126265
and I don't need four men with bad breath that're crabby . 2126985_2131605
but my male sperm is going to carry an allele for bad breath <and a> and a separate allele for the crabby gene mkay ? 2131965_2139725
notice that these are unduplicated chromosomes at the time . 2140105_2142585
and also notice that fertilization's going to occur you guys should be able to take these chromosomes through both mitosis and meiosis and understand what happens so it's going to be up to the individual alleles to move the way you should . 2143305_2157585
and the rest of you watch the way they're moving and if they're doing something wrong let (th)em know . 2158125_2161645
mkay .
alright . 2162545_2163625
&-um throughout +//. 2164665_2166265
first we're gonna do mitosis which is is pretty easy and then we'll go to meiosis so what I need is four volunteers I need bad breath mkay who wants to be the bad breath allele ? 2166375_2181715
&=laughs:multiple don't all stand at once right ? 2183175_2185555

(0.4) &=laughs:multiple nondisjunction in mitosis . 2424345_2424865
okay good . 2425385_2426085
&-um so this is anaphase now telophase is going going to occur followed by cytokinesis . 2426745_2431105
you guys are now two daughter cells your job is pretty much done . 2431465_2434165
show your alleles to everybody . 2434445_2435545
what do you notice about these two daughter cells ? 2436005_2437925
they're haploid <in appearance> ?
it's the same as the parents .
identical .
they're identical to each_other and the parent . 2440965_2443745
right . 2443905_2444125
you guys are not only identical to each_other you're identical to the original parent . 2444265_2447685
what's your ploidy ? 2447825_2448605
diploid .
two n@l . 2450345_2450765

&-um &~wh when I say partner &~wha what's going on now is semiconservative replication where the helicase comes in unwinds brings in all that stuff brings in the bases . 2570225_2578685
when when the homologous chromosomes find a partner that's when like chromosomes pair . 2579485_2583905
so there will be +//. 2584525_2585085
watch this okay . 2585805_2586505
alright we're in prophase one now . 2586985_2588745
so what should be going on ? 2589665_2590945

it's up to you to figure out who's homologous +... 2607005_2610725
what does homologous mean ? 2611805_2615665
the same .
carrying the same genes right ? 2615965_2619585
so I have the breath gene whether it's bad or good . 2619705_2622085
and have &~i the mood gene whether it's bad or good those are homologues . 2622345_2625565
okay so cheerful is paired with crabby fresh is paired with bad okay ? 2625975_2629915
now typically you guys are so close together that there's &~h you can't even distinguish between the four of you . 2630155_2636895

there would be a spindle fiber here on Natasha's arm and here on Naomi's arm . 2657815_2661495
and poor Felicia and Loretta have no spindle fibers so therefore they can't +//. 2662115_2666015
they're just very close together . 2668195_2669155
and they're not gonna be pulled apart from their partner ultimately . 2669675_2672575
I got a question .
okay .
mhm .
she wouldn't have a spindle fiber just . 2674275_2677035
oh Bridget does too . 2677555_2678475
yeah I was just using the front row . 2678595_2679895
yeah Bridget would have one and Joel would have one but in between poor Jerry Bryant no . 2679885_2684665
okay . 2685285_2685405
okay so anaphase one . 2686505_2687645
okay since these four had no spindle fiber . 2689365_2691485
are we staying ? 2691865_2692325
I mean I'll stay but you know . 2692605_2693185

but you can't detach because you had the four of you had no spindle fiber that's very sad so you have to go with your your neighbor okay . 2697865_2704925
and that's because of the what's that ? 2704945_2709125

it it can't it's just staying on his side yeah (be)cause you guys were so close together that there's no room for ⌈ it to get in there ⌉ . 2726305_2731645
⌊ but the centromeres ⌋ haven't dissolved yet . 2731645_2733065
is is that what it is ?
right +/.

+, right .
centromeres haven't divided +/. 2734625_2735845
okay +/.
+, that's why you're still attached . 2736005_2736805
so like the centromeres are even attached to the kinetochores on each chromosome +/. 2739085_2741325
right +/.

right . 2742585_2742685
yep .
everybody has a kinetochore . 2743165_2745085
that's not the problem okay the problem is the spindle fiber attachment . 2745245_2748065
okay so meiosis one would occur be over . 2749365_2752885
telophase one cytokinesis one and you'd end up with two daughter cells . 2753045_2756165
how do they look ? 2756485_2757205
those daughter cells ? 2757465_2758045
what alleles do you guys have ? 2758405_2759745
identical to their parents .
oh you guys ended up identical but it didn't hafta be that way did it ? 2760085_2765125
unhunh no .
no (be)cause Brian and Joel could've been over here Jerry and Bridget could've been over there and then they would look recombinant right ? 2765865_2771005
what's their ploidy ? 2771725_2772685
two n@l-s .
two n@l .
four n@l equals eight . 2773985_2778545
ah: .
no two n@l . 2778885_2779865
what is +//. 2780885_2781865
whose ploidy ? 2782185_2782665
this whole cell like this ? 2782805_2783985
this whole cell and this whole cell . 2784085_2785385
two n@l equals four .
two one n@l .
is that one n@l equals two ? 2785925_2787285
how many mood genes mood chromosomes do you have ? 2791345_2795105
one . 2795265_2795645
how many breath chromosomes do you have ? 2795765_2798425
oh I keep thinking it's +//. 2798445_2799365
oh I know what you're talking about now . 2799745_2800345
so one n@l equals two ?
one n@l equals two . 2800345_2801005
and that's because the centromere didn't divide +/. 2801265_2803225
yeah I forget .
+, these are still duplicated to chromosomes okay ? 2803425_2805765
so don't forget that you start out diploid after meiosis one you're two haploids mkay ? 2805945_2810725
now you guys need to go through meiosis two . 2811025_2813705
and so get in prophase two . 2813945_2815805
&-uh you are okay . 2816685_2818625
metaphase two +... 2818915_2819775
anaphase two . 2822275_2823435
+, separate +/.
+, okay . 2823715_2826295
cytokinesis telophase two . 2826595_2828135
now we have four daughter cells that look how ? 2828515_2830975
different ? 2831815_2834255
different because they have half the genetic information as the original unreplicated parent and it just so happens that they all lined up together so we don't really have any recombinants per_se here but we could've because it's random okay ? 2834415_2846195
now if you'll just get back together with your homologue one more time I'm just wanna show crossing over . 2846785_2851945
get back where metaphase one . 2852565_2854945
okay now I want just Jerry and Bryant to cross over so just swap tags . 2856885_2862385
yeah or swap sides whichever you wanna do . 2863145_2864745
what're you gonna do man ? 2865285_2866325
God it's not that hard . 2867245_2869165
okay &-um anaphase one +... 2869965_2871865
okay cytokinesis you're haploid . 2876115_2878635
okay now just go through meiosis two show me the end products of meiosis two . 2879035_2882515
okay good . 2883755_2884115
now Natasha and Joel have bad breath and they're crabby . 2884815_2887375
mkay .
that looked just like dad right ? 2887715_2889595
mkay &-um Loretta has bad breath but Bryant's cheerful . 2890335_2894495
is that parental or recombinant ? 2894775_2896355
recombinant . 2896595_2897055
okay that's recombinant mkay ? 2897155_2898735
Felicia has fresh breath Jerry's crabby parental or recombinant ? 2899115_2904095
recombinant . 2904255_2906095
recombinant . 2905125_2905465
and then Bridget's cheerful and Naomi's got fresh breath so those were parental . 2905805_2911125
okay ? 2912045_2912125
I think you can visualize what would happen with nondisjunction . 2912325_2915865
okay ? 2916225_2916525
if you'll all get back together one more time with your homologues . 2916565_2918845
okay nondisjunction we're gonna have Brian and Jerry separate but we're gonna have Felicia and Naomi come over here . 2919565_2927605
okay ? 2928385_2928545
okay . 2929305_2930045
so now poor Jerry and Bridget are gonna die because they are gonna be &=laughs:multiple in a cell with just one chromosome and they're missing the entire second chromosome that they need with all the proteins . 2930345_2941465
okay ? 2941805_2941865
but we have Down's syndrome &=laughs:multiple . 2941865_2942485
but that's okay . 2943265_2945705
&-um so these guys fertilization's going to occur right ? 2946385_2950185
we'll just call you an egg fertilization's going to occur . 2950325_2953105
and now I have bad breath . 2953325_2955125
okay ? 2955485_2955645
so there's three of us and my homologue does too . 2955725_2958245
now we have three alleles for bad breath and therefore it's called a trisomy for three . 2958225_2963905
and that's not too devastating we just go with bad breath for the rest of our lives okay ? 2964805_2969105
but that's nondisjunction where somebody ends up with none . 2969205_2971505
okay and somebody ends up with one . 2972225_2974285
does it matter that he's still &-um I mean like had a crossover ? 2974425_2978925
no . 2979605_2980285
no that's fine . 2980445_2981485
you can have you know nondisjunction with crossing over whatever . 2981725_2984485
okay thank you chromosomes you did an excellent job so hopefully try to visualize that (be)cause you guys seem to know what you're doing . 2985425_2990865
and if you can visualize what's supposed to be happening that's sometimes helpful for the exam . 2991145_2996785
but first for the quiz okay ? 2997705_2999665
you know what's on it . 3000865_3001825
there's all the &-uh <cricket lab> cricket lab's on it &-um DNA replication Meselson_Stahl the experiments where she chased Avery_Griffith mitosis meiosis . 3002505_3012745
&-um what's the ploidy &~af after meiosis one ?
what's what ? 3019735_3020135
the ploidy after meiosis one ? 3020515_3022495
okay after meiosis one what is the ploidy ? 3023015_3025015
one n@l equals .
eight .
one n@l equals thirty .
okay +... 3027755_3028395
&-uh the question is what's the ploidy after meiosis one ? 3030595_3036135
one n@l equals two . 3036935_3037475
one n@l could've equal any one n@l could equal ten . 3038215_3040895
oh okay .
+, okay ? 3041275_3041815
&-um sperm cells one n@l equals twenty three in humans . 3042375_3045655
okay there're twenty three different chromosomes in the sperm but there's only one copy of each okay ? 3045755_3050315
so you started out with forty six and after meiosis one you have two daughter cells that each have twenty three different chromosomes . 3050555_3057835
how many genes are on one chromosome ? 3058415_3060015
typically about a hundred . 3060335_3061155
mkay and that's sort_of a ball hundred hundred and fifty that's kind_of a ball park figure for how many genes are on chromosome . 3061935_3067255
yeah and and one thing we've done is we've just done unlinked genes but keep in mind you could have ABCD that're all linked and crossing could occur at any point on the chromatids . 3067675_3079515
so you may see crossing over with respect to one locus but not the other twenty three . 3079775_3084355
mkay .
so then N represents the copy of each chromatid ? 3084595_3090355
chromosome . 3091155_3091675
chromosome . 3091955_3092315
yeah . 3092495_3092715
don't even use chromatids in this class (be)cause it'll confuse you I think more than anything . 3093375_3096855
just know this a chromosome that's unreplicated this is a chromosome that is replicated . 3097195_3102855
okay .
okay .
Meagan ?
so when we're doing the the diploid then or like just whatever the ploidy you go by the letters like so if it's A and A even whether they're large or small then that's considered like one kind . 3105495_3118695
right . 3119535_3119675
+, and that so then like if you have say you have one chromosome with a big a@l and another one with a little a@l but they're not like replicated then you would say two two n@l ? 3119985_3129245
+, mhm +/.
+, but what if it's replicated and you'd be like a replicated one with a@l-s and a replicated with little a@l-s . 3129505_3135225
then it's still two n@l . 3135985_3136745
it's still two n@l ? 3136905_3137305
yeah okay what's the ploidy of this cell ? 3137325_3138745
&=pause_while_writing .
three n@l equals .
I knew you'd say that . 3156805_3158065
it's wrong ?
+, it's just two n@l right ? 3158745_3160445
there's two of each kind of chromosome . 3160645_3163185
sure there's three different kinds +/. 3163725_3165405
+, oh +/.
+, okay ? 3166145_3166245
but there's two of each . 3166365_3167545
okay so don't get that confused . 3168005_3169525
this would be two n@l equals what ? 3169665_3170965
⌈ six ⌉ . 3171225_3172265
⌊ six ⌋ okay ? 3173245_3173585
so ploidy the N means number of different chromosomes . 3174085_3179225
if there's one of each different chromosome it would be haploid . 3179525_3183085
okay ? 3183405_3183725
if there's two of each different chromosomes it would be diploid . 3183875_3187095
triploid I'd hafta have three of each . 3188295_3189775
and you don't wanna see that . 3191075_3191975
that only happens in plants . 3192075_3193175
usually and they live to tell about it . 3193995_3195895
mkay +...
mkay ?
Natasha ?
what's important about the crickets lab ? 3196615_3202955
oh well you should be able to put any of the substrates with any of the enzymes and tell me what would happen . 3203755_3208995
&=laughs:multiple .
Laury it's just like I can't remember exactly what those substrates did . 3211485_3213925
I can't even remember their names .
that was the first exam you can get xxx . 3214445_3218825

glycolysis .
glycolysis . 3234645_3236485

cytosols .
cytosol . 3240425_3241665
so if I put glucose with whole homogenate . 3241825_3244645
could glycolysis happen ? 3244985_3245865
yes . 3246085_3246505
&=writes:board could respiration ? 3246865_3247685
yes . 3247965_3248385
oh I remember that .
does everybody understand why both those processes could occur ? 3249885_3253785
yes .
did anybody say no ? 3254125_3256225
okay ? 3257045_3258165
okay . 3258305_3258485
glucose &=writes:board plus supernatant . 3258885_3262605
could glycolysis occur ? 3263895_3265095
yes . 3265455_3265775
why ? 3266115_3266275
because the cytosol .
okay . 3266635_3268495
so glycolysis occur could respiration ? 3268795_3270575
no . 3270875_3271195
why not ? 3271435_3271855
no mitochondria .
no mitochondria . 3271995_3273335
okay . 3273595_3273835
you know this . 3274155_3274975
&=writes:board glucose plus pellet can glycolysis occur ? 3275335_3279975
no . 3280195_3280435
why not ? 3280655_3281035
no cytosol . 3281215_3282175
no cytosol . 3282255_3282915
could respiration ? 3283035_3283595
yes no . 3283915_3285255
no ? 3285655_3285935
why ? 3286075_3286435
because don't you have to <go through> glycolysis before you can go to respiration ? 3286935_3290435
yeah yeah . 3290615_3291575
if you don't have pyruvate or succinate which is a pyruvate substitute then you can't go through respiration so this tube could do nothing . 3291825_3298425
&=writes:board okay and the only other thing you have to worry about is succinate succinate plus whole homogenate any glycolysis ? 3300485_3307825
no .
why ?
because there's no glucose . 3308285_3312205
no glucose any respiration ? 3312385_3313905
yes . 3314145_3314725
okay . 3314985_3315185
okay succinate plus supernatant . 3315325_3319405
glycolysis ? 3319895_3320615
yes .
no . 3320755_3322575
why not ? 3323275_3323755
(be)cause there's still no glucose right ?
no glucose respiration ? 3324195_3327135
no .
no no mitochondria . 3327955_3329855
no mitochondria okay so nothing there . 3330015_3332735
and lastly succinate plus pellet . 3335555_3337615
glycolysis ? 3338215_3338835
no . 3339095_3339955
no .
respiration ? 3340435_3340915
yes . 3341195_3341555
yes . 3341715_3342055
&=writes:board okay . 3342395_3344575
so if you can keep that straight I think you're . 3344875_3346675
you said pyruvate is a glucose substitute ? 3347425_3350285
pyruvate . 3350585_3351325
wait I'm sorry ? 3351705_3352665
what is pyruvate a substitute for ? 3352945_3355845
succinate is a pyruvate substitute . 3355845_3358205
okay .
+, okay ? 3359225_3359245
glucose is broken down into pyruvate which feeds directly into the Krebs cycle for respiration . 3359445_3363585
okay ?
&~s but you could substitute anything in the Krebs cycle for pyruvate and it would work . 3364465_3368465
okay ? 3369425_3370665
good ? 3371585_3373705
mhm .
(0.7) .
alright ?
you're good with everything you're ready bring it on . 3384485_3386405
no .
no the experiments . 3386665_3387185
oh no . 3387585_3388765
&=laughs:S1 .
I told you .
let's have a summary of all of (th)em . 3389085_3395085
no (0.5) .
okay &-um experiments anything specific ? 3400685_3403545
Griffith's was the s@l cells and the r@l cells . 3404165_3406245
okay +/. 3407625_3407765
⌈ that's the rats ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ you inject the mouse ⌋ hm ? 3407885_3409405
the rats right ? 3409925_3410505
yeah +/. 3410665_3410885
+, mouse whatever . 3411425_3411665
you inject the mouse with +/. 3411945_3413025
s@l cells +/.
+, S what happens ? 3414185_3414965
they die .
why ?
(be)cause they had pathogenic .
they had a capsule around it . 3415785_3420385
mkay .
&~cont contracts pneumonia and dies . 3421605_3423985
basically .
+, okay ?
mouse plus r@l cell does it have a capsule ? 3424785_3426645
⌈ no ⌉ .
⌊ no ⌋ . 3427005_3427565
is it virulent does it cause pneumonia ? 3427945_3429345
no . 3429625_3429885
no . 3430185_3430285
does the mouse die with it ? 3430425_3431285
⌈ no ⌉ . 3431425_3431565
⌊ no ⌋ .
heat killed S . 3432465_3433265
what's heat killing do to the s@l stain ? 3433685_3435505
breaks up the capsules . 3435965_3437885
breaks open the &~cap breaks up the capsule basically destroys the cell wall so it's just naked DNA in solution . 3437385_3442625
and what happens to the mouse ? 3443185_3444005
it lives . 3444105_3444605
okay it lives nothing's wrong with it . 3445085_3446445
so alone live R didn't kill the mouse . 3447085_3450225
alone heat killed S doesn't kill the mouse why does a combination of the two kill the mouse ? 3450585_3455305
(be)cause transformation . 3455445_3456385
okay transformation occurs and what &~di what's being transformed to what ? 3457145_3459885
the S and R . 3460205_3460805
R is transferring to S . 3462665_3467365
mkay so basically something from the S is getting into R transforming it to becoming S and killing the mouse . 3464585_3471185
did they conclude anything more than that ? 3471705_3473325
no . 3473665_3474205
no .
okay ? 3474805_3475265
and then it took Avery what'd Avery do ? 3475505_3478205
to a purified solution ? 3478445_3479365
he took the chemicals ⌈ from that and made them ⌉ . 3479505_3481165
⌊ killed the mouse ⌋ and killed the DNA .
okay you take DNase mkay that kills DNA . 3481665_3485465
and if DNase wipes out the DNA do you see transformation occurring ? 3485785_3489025
no . 3489185_3489385
no . 3489665_3489925
what about protease that kills the protein ? 3490065_3491925
it still transforms . 3492065_3494565
mkay .
still transforms and therefore what did Avery conclude ? 3495245_3498665
the DNA was the &-uh .
transforming agent .
mkay DNA is the transforming principle and not protein . 3498885_3503945
and protein's so much more complex . 3504465_3505965
there're twenty amino acids there're various ways millions of ways to hook (th)em up . 3506245_3510485
so it was disputed pretty heavily debated that &-uh DNA which is much more simple could be that important for the genetic material . 3511065_3519105
okay . 3519825_3520385
okay ? 3521685_3521905
(0.4) good ? 3525795_3526075
okay do you guys need to ? 3526455_3530855
&~ther it's quiz time so if &~yo . 3532015_3533355
