xxx .
I mean, there's probably some other articles about this, but I've just been reading more about what the revolutionaries thought, and I was going to ask who were the revolutionaries, and if they included the police, if the police were part of counter-revolution . 4525_21085
great question . 21545_22025
I mean, I have a question . 39325_40265
what is the xxx force, I guess xxx the revolution ? 43445_46545
who was going against it ? 47585_48925
yeah, counter-revolution .
no . 50685_52345
people that are going against the revolution . 55565_56925
oh, I didn't hear the +... 57665_58445
I thought you said, the resolutionist . 58565_59825
no .
counter . 60025_61185
my condolences .
what's the question ? 68145_68725
well, we both asked similar questions of who is the opposing side and what do they do to xxx . 69105_77285
I don't know for sure xxx but what I do know is that a lot of the lower class +... 77425_82865
I wouldn't say they were a hundred percent against it, but they also +... 83325_85645
they didn't really see any change going on . 86205_88405
I mean, the government was unstable, nothing was really changing . 89125_91245
so I think that they were getting kind of fed up with that at that point . 91485_94245
who's the government prior to the revolution ? 97295_99655
North Korea . 100475_103595
I would say that the counter-revolutionaries would've been the military and the government, because they were the ones supporting the dictator and whatnot, because they were like being paid to support them . 104515_118255
and they were probably normal people supporting them as well . 119215_121795
if anyone would like to add onto that . 153525_154285
those of us who haven't spoken yet, what are some questions maybe we want to ask to continue the discussion ?
how widespread was the revolution when it first started ? 155395_166755
I knew when it first started though, like how long did it really take to lift off ? 167835_173735
oh, so I think that like any revolution, just like the French revolution, it started in a small +... 176665_190565
couple people probably thought it was xxx and then it kind of took flight when +... 191745_200565
so I'm going to model what S_one would say here, or S_three in which case I would ask, can anybody sort of elaborate on what S_seven's trying to say ? 204545_216125
it may have just started off really small, but as word spreads on that, there's a revolution starting that more people might join in that support the same cause . 219265_230185
I just answered my own question . 233405_234725
well, what evidence do we have for any of this ? 235785_237945
there's no evidence . 238025_239085
it's all based off inference . 239405_240465
I think if you know the answer then we'll know the answer, but no one here knows the answer . 240725_244925
so this is just an inference based conversation . 245265_247865
I don't know how small or big it was in the beginning, but I can't find the exact +... 249925_256925
where it says exactly . 258005_259485
I remember reading it, that all this corruptions started in nineteen-oh-two, I believe . 259845_265865
so, it started a while ago and it was just corrupt leader after corrupt leader . 266425_270825
and the third class is trying to fight back . 271125_274685
oh, I have a good question . 275405_278545
all right, so do you think that the difference in how the French revolution had a king or a democracy and Cuba had a dictator, do you think that that affected the revolution in any way ? 279065_293225
and who was the enemy ? 293485_297765
I think that based on leaders, they had many similarities, like their tax and wages onto the lower class . 298685_307405
I think a king's going to be reelected unless he dies . 307865_317465
so then it just became a dictator such as Robespierre . 318325_320345
anyone else notice the similarities between Egyptian revolution and the solution xxx ? 324145_329325
the Egyptian ? 330505_332405
you lost me . 332645_333545
the Egyptian . 333545_333805
we did that at the beginning of year . 333985_335265
I'm sorry xxx . 335465_336525
why is that the thing I remember ? 336785_341625
why is that one thing I remember ? 341885_344325
that was brutal . 345085_346865
no, no . 347065_347445
it was different because like the Egyptian that was +... 347505_349705
that was different . 350225_350845
this one's pretty violent . 355535_356335
I was reading an article last night saying that it was talking about a bunch of movements and riots that they were doing and their fighting committees . 357555_367375
and it got to the point where police are making unfair arrests because they're just trying to get everybody controlled . 368335_375315
the police are beating people . 376275_377735
they weren't arresting people . 378115_379195
but still it's some sort of violence against revolutionaries . 379635_382295
you're saying that the military didn't act the same or the authorities didn't act the same . 385545_391365
there's lower classes . 391485_394065
third estate is the lower classes were . 395225_398465
as a whole, what could be said about the Egyptian Revolution and the French Revolution and the Cuban Revolution ? 402045_409445
because they all have some sort of violence in them because each one has xxx . 409785_413225
okay, can we get more specific ? 415875_417215
all had riots and that kind of thing . 417675_420055
but they also were all against either monarchy or a dictatorship . 420315_422995
they were all movements against the government like the women's march, where they went directly to the palace and they protested . 423935_432875
and then in the Egyptian, they went to the square . 432935_436335
can you give me an example for Egypt ? 436955_439995
she just did . 440895_441615
the square . 442095_443295
that was the Egyptian +... 444205_445225
oh, my God, I remember that . 445685_447405
wow, really ? 447785_448645
now I remember that one . 448705_449245
and then xxx the government and they all have +... 449785_458965
they all have had dictators in their line xxx . 459725_462765
I threw that memo in my brain . 463225_466145
again with the third state and the lower classes they were the ones who mainly did the +... 467935_472795
is the word what's the word, the verb for revolution ? 474095_481315
revolt . 481875_482335
revolt . 482335_482355
okay . 482635_482915
I couldn't think of that word . 483115_484095
the lower classes were mostly revolting . 484835_487375
I was thinking like isn't this revolution a little different than the other ones, because it wasn't just the lower class . 488715_493575
the upper class weren't fully supporting it either . 493585_497105
whereas with the monarchy, the upper class was working against the lower class, but it was more different here . 497385_502385
I think it wasn't as class-based as +... 502485_504665
I don't think that they cared, the higher classes . 505585_507705
yeah, because even the doctors couldn't even get jobs and doctors get lots of jobs . 507825_512105
does anyone want to agree or argue with that ? 512605_514485
no . 514745_515325
do you have evidence ? 515585_516305
I said I agree because like in the third estate, people also feel the same because the second estate also came in, but also in this Cuban Revolution how they didn't get paid, so they also had to fight with them . 516755_528975
but I think it all started with the lower class had to start it first and then the other classes had to come in if they wanted to benefit from it . 529455_537135
I have a clarifying question . 537655_539755
in the Egyptian revolution who were the revolutionaries ? 540625_545745
was it a class ? 546205_546985
it was more of a religious thing, I believe . 547105_548885
it was the Muslim Brotherhood versus the regular Muslims I think, or something . 549345_554185
no, no, it was original . 554885_555525
no, it wasn't Christian . 555925_556645
they're both Muslims, but they were both opposing each other . 556805_559205
it was a bunch of religions coming together . 559225_560645
it was the Muslim Brotherhood and the government and police versus the other Muslims . 560745_563865
it wasn't the government . 563865_564465
they were just against the government because the government was treating them unfairly . 564625_567205
yeah, but then the Muslim Brotherhood sold out . 567435_569495
they sold out just to +... 569855_572195
so then in Egypt, it wasn't a class situation . 572535_575835
someone said earlier there was a class situation, but then you said it was a class situation earlier and you just proved yourself wrong . 576035_583635
why are you putting me on the spot ? 584415_585835
are you saying there's no upper class in Cuba ? 585975_589015
yeah, there's an upper class in Cuba . 589655_591855
then what role do they play here ? 592135_594435
either they play the role of supporting the government or they just start +... 595245_601005
maybe they're just being xxx . 601285_602065
I don't really think that we're talking about the Cuban revolution anymore . 602185_608205
just talking about revolution anymore . 608485_609605
no, we're just talking about the similarities and differences .
I know .
alright .
alright, let's do the final question about New York . 610985_615625
should we start a revolution ? 615825_616385
no, no . 616645_617365
the reason we shouldn't start revolution is because we don't need one . 617485_619725
xxx .
we're not in a life or death situation . 625335_627475
our lives are not in danger . 627855_631555
xxx .
do we need a revolution now ? 633775_638195
of course, but this is going to take time and look how the French revolution last . 638335_642495
around thirty years . 643035_643815
I'm not going to wait thirty years to get my right . 643935_646675
I believe there's a lot of similarities between New York City and Havana, because it's like a tourist attraction, a lot of people come there for gambling +... 647205_657825
not gambling, but money and stuff . 658185_659745
but still, that's why you come to New York . 660045_665645
I guess my question is +... 666185_672145
don't ask a new question ! 673465_674485
then I won't ask a new question . 675005_676025
so, I was going to say that we shouldn't have a revolution because there's a lot of +... 676705_683685
I think that it would just be a waste of time . 685005_686925
you know what I mean ? 687205_687585
I think that it would just be a waste of time because there's a lot of opinions and there's a lot of people in this state and I don't think that it would be able to spread . 687945_696265
plus just a lot of tourists . 696905_698685
they're going to try to get involved . 699005_700145
I also don't want to die . 700265_702805
no one has the time to do it . 704345_706085
I got xxx, I ain't trying to do no revolution . 707245_710605
overall the message has to be sent to the president which I don't think that wouldn't really work . 710845_716305
I don't think the president would really listen to a bunch of fifteen- and sixteen-years-old . 716305_719125
yeah, exactly . 719125_719765
who would it be started by ? 719925_720785
I think he wouldn't really care if it was started by high schoolers or +... 720785_727345
xxx .
did anyone read about the Yanna ? 727825_731085
did anybody read that stuff ? 732405_732885
how might that connect ? 733145_735445
the Yanna was an underground group, I believe . 737165_740225
I need to find the article . 741105_741745
those of you who are saying that maybe teenagers and school aged people can't do this +... 742145_748205
yeah .
no, we could do this . 748745_750325
okay, I literally have an article so if you guys would quiet down that'd be great . 750965_755205
so on page fifty-six, it says the Yanna was a group of male college students who, including Fidel Castro, who staged an attack against Baptista and it was a disaster . 755625_776605
so it's around the same age . 777665_780225
why couldn't teenagers start a revolution ? 783545_787945
because not everyone takes our opinion seriously . 788425_792065
most arguments that are made against young adults is that our minds haven't fully developed yet . 792645_798705
so our opinions aren't really validated . 799025_801065
an example is voting . 801445_803625
we can't vote because I don't +... 804145_805965
what ? 806745_806985
in other states, xxx but we just can't . 807205_809545
talking about New York . 812045_812565
we can't vote at the age +... 813185_815045
you have to be eighteen and eighteen is considered an adult . 815345_818405
legal adult . 818825_819985
you could have been talked to as an adult . 820165_821905
you know what I mean . 822225_823365
we are still young adults and I don't think anyone, politicians or +... 823785_829525
we're young adults now . 829525_830325
yeah, but is a politician or the president going to give a crap about what you have to say ? 830645_836065
if I make a good point, I believe so . 836245_838565
I really don't think they'd care . 839085_840485
no, if I had enough problems +... 840925_841905
why would the government here give a crap about what they did ? 841985_843585
it wasn't made by teenagers . 844085_846805
S_six just had her hand up, guys . 847005_848005
I think it's because we're kids . 848185_851225
in the future, we're going to be the adults, like what we live in . 851445_854785
so, I think like what she said is important that teenagers do vote and stuff like that because we're going to be living in the world not like our parents, because they can be dead by then . 854865_865585
so it does matter that we vote . 865585_867525
the argument is true . 867985_870165
our brains are not completely developed . 870425_872205
it's not they're just saying that because to make us feel bad . 873045_876485
it's true . 877205_877645
but not every +... 877825_878605
I don't think for an example, one of the reasons that I don't think we can vote at this age is I don't think everyone our age takes it seriously . 879085_887925
so, I don't think if we were to start a revolution, everyone at our age wouldn't really take it as seriously as everyone else . 888225_894125
not only that bro, but even just looking at what's happened in schools recently and people making bad decisions, I wouldn't want that to be xxx . 894125_906985
yeah . 907745_909065
I wouldn't want that to affect our future because there's just people out there who don't really know what they're doing . 909325_915225
okay .
this seems like a nice place to pause
