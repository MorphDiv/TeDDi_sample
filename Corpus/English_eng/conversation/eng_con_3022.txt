+^ that's not something she had to learn this year or we had to
so Nicole is making the point to you that if a few weeks ago I had
do you think she might she's right ? 182636_184236

+^ she knows about up down flips . 216421_217473
+^ she knows about sideways flips . 217473_219208
+^ she knows about diagonal flips . 219208_220643
+^ let's talk about those for just a minute . 220643_222610
+^ use the ideas that you were gathering together in your mind and
who can explain for me pretend that I know nothing about flips
Brittany please try to sit real still and join in the conversation .
you've been adding good ideas but I keep turning my head to watch
who can explain to me did I pick up down flip first ? 252106_255640
yes . 255640_256649
+< yes . 256649_256868
Katie give it a try . 256868_257906
um an up down flip is when you take the core square and take it by
so an up down flip would allow me to see the back side of the core
+^ I would take it by the edge and can you what would
+^ I got the part about taking it by the edge . 281036_283036
and then you'd flip it like that . 283036_284786
and I'd flip it like that . 284786_286755
yeah . 286755_287388
does it matter which edge I take ? 287388_288740
no . 288740_289826
well you can't take well you could take a corner or a
I could take a corner or a side . 296428_298263
you could take anything . 298263_299636
you just have to pick it up and flip it over . 299636_302650
+< you can take a side . 302650_303318
you just have to pick it up and flip it over . 303318_305170
that's an up down flip ? 305170_306136
xxx . 306136_307513
okay then teach me more about flips . 307513_311000
how is a sideways flip I remember Nicole saying she's learned
Nathan I'd like you to try to explain that to me . 319981_322473
um it's because a sideways flip goes like this and an up down flip
an up down flip flips up or down . 332213_334530
I understand that part . 334530_335631
+^ tell me some words about +//. 335631_337676
+< and a sideways flip um turns right or left . 337676_340210
okay a sideways flip turns right or left ? 340210_343695
um I mean flips right or left . 343695_346096
+< okay so if I flip something to my right or if I flip something
um +//. 352860_354193
but an up down flip I have to flip it up or down . 354193_356846
what do I see the back side with a sideways flip ? 356846_359848
um yeah . 359848_361816
okay so I end up seeing the back side for an up down flip and I end
no . 370225_372070
oh . 372070_372541
can you tell me about that Jillian ? 372541_374391
+^ remember I don't know anything about flips . 374391_376360
well I think that an up down flip and a sideways flip is the
okay Jillian's saying what if an up down flip and a sideways flip
they are . 390195_391496
they are . 391496_392163
they aren't . 392163_393605
yes they are . 393605_394371
+< can you tell me can you explain to me and to Jillian how
I know that an up down flip goes up or goes down and I know a
+< but they both +//. 406420_406421
but if I end up seeing the back side of that core square or
but they xxx +//. 414045_414976
+< yeah because if someone is like flipping it up and down and
well we always know that's why we marked that special corner
+< well like if you knew it was Polydrons and there wasn't xxx . 430131_432505
okay Brittany go ahead and try to tell me why you think an up down
well they're kinda the same and they're kinda
they both they both um they if you have two pieces
if you flipped the green one to the to the left that would be a
+< but Jillian's idea is does an up down flip make something
yes . 482013_482565
no . 482565_483371
if you have the same if you have the same thing on both sides
yep you mean from the Polydrons we made some core squares
so if this is can you um talk to me about this then
well right now um if you turn it to the left or the right that
+< okay okay listen please and watch . 528221_530085
you won't be able to understand Brittany's thinking about this if
Brittany's asking you to watch this core square and she's saying
left . 546503_547015
left hand side of the design . 547015_548281
+^ do you think she's right ? 548281_549301
yes . 549301_550400
okay I'm going to do a sideways flip . 550400_552103
and if you do an up down flip +//. 552103_556030
okay wait wait I gotta go back to the beginning . 556030_558115
this is how it started I always have to put the core square
+^ what if I do an up down flip Brittany ? 561176_562761
+< if you do an up down flip then the um red one would be on the u
