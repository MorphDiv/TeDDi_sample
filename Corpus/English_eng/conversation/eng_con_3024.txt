we need some more of these . 0_1370
xxx . 1370_3695
+< (be)cause we're trying too many different things . 3695_5496
I'll make one ! 5496_7081
I'll make one ! 7081_8226
+< I wanna be no that's okay that's okay . 8226_10995
Jenna please click those together to look like this one and +... 10995_15398
I wanna make one . 15398_17700
can I ? 17700_18316
thank you for all being so willing to help . 18316_22440
Amanda's gonna click this together . 22440_23938
okay um let's see . 23938_29610
xxx . 29610_30685
someone has explained to me an up down flip someone has explained
okay I'm still looking for um a description um an explanation
Nathan what are you thinking ? 75678_77345
um it's where you take one of the corners of the core square or the
+< Sarah let Amanda do that . 99728_100011
+< I need two more yellows . 100011_101500
like this ? 101500_102065
no um like diangular@c diangle@c . 102065_106683
so if you're you're imagining holding on to the upper right corner
where will the top right corner end up after a diagonal flip where
it'll end it'll stop right here at the other side at the um
okay so a diagonal flip goes from the upper right to the lower
is that the only kind of diagonal flip you can do ? 133745_136263
+< no . 136263_136698
you can even do from the lower right over to the um um to the um to
lower right to the top right ? 150765_153075
no I mean to the top left you can +... 153075_158011
+< okay so lower right to the top left ? 158011_160063
and you can do from the lower um left to the um top right . 160063_168963
+< I know xxx . 168963_169278
+< okay so there are three kinds of diagonal flips ? 169278_172795
+< and um you can do from the top left to the um lower left up to
so four kinds of diagonal flips hmm there might be more ? 183600_189853
no (be)cause diagonal flips up top (be)cause you can only go like
+< okay so a diagonal flips are definitely different from sideways
+< yeah (be)cause you just can't the only way you can do a
+< okay so you have to go left to right and top to bottom or right
+< yeah . 233158_233159
so if you start in the bottom then you have to end up on the top
yeah . 240201_240795
good explanation . 240795_241926
Alex did you okay are you thinking about diagonal flips ? 241926_244828
&=nods yes . 244828_245178
what are you thinking about them ? 245178_246648
well the reason they're different from sideways flip and then up
just a second . 266800_267806
um Justin and Brittany make sure you're listening to Alex . 267806_270516
can you start that whole idea right from the very beginning ? 270516_272833
well the reason a up down flip and a sideways flip and a diagonal
uh huh . 283650_284106
is that um well if you do an up down flip with a yellow triangle at
okay a yellow I have to think about that for a minute and so do
okay if you did an up down flip you would end up on the upper left
yeah do you think he's right the yellow triangle would end up up
yes . 327131_328015
+< okay so tell me about the yellow triangle in a different kind of
and if you did a sideways flip you would end up on the lower right .
do you think he's right ? 340006_341991
&=nods . 341991_342943
I think so too . 342943_343713
but if you +/. 343713_345961
+< Nathan are you watching this is important . 345961_347461
but if you did a diagonal flip the yellow triangle would end up on
yep (be)cause remember the yellow triangle started in the lower
so did Alex just prove to you that all of those three kinds of
yeah . 369471_371155
nice explaining Alex . 371155_372855
it's easy to explain when you have something to show people it's
good explanation Alex very good . 383113_385468
these are ready so let's go get back to our test of what we're
and uh &~tuh I don't know if this is true either this isn't
what we've got here are three copies of the same core square does
+< yes . 411496_411828
thank you Amanda and Jenna and Sarah and others who helped us get
what we are gonna do is test that um idea we've been
Asratu and Nathan that's probably a poor choice I'd like you to
+< hey < pickle pickle pickle > ! 436175_436301
+< you're making this in the circle . 436301_436553
doesn't need too much room but everybody has to see the room in the
<okay everyone> and you have to sit Nathan and Paul good job .
okay so here's our beginning core square alright here's the
they're all three the same and they're all in the same position
yeah . 462230_462913
because when I look at the top what I'm calling the top and for you
this one we're gonna keep the same to remind us how
where that's gonna help us remember where we started
this one I'm gonna do an up down flip on . 484080_488448
will it look the same as our beginning or different ? 488448_491025
different . 491025_492825
let's try . 492825_493776
different . 493776_496685
it does look different it does look different . 496685_498490
on this we we're gonna do a sideways flip do you think
yes . 504575_505900
well let's see sideways flip . 505900_507960
it does . 507960_510100
it's the same . 510100_511163
+< so we did find a core square that looks the same after an up
so an up down flip can look the same as a sideways flip . 518246_521615
okay is an up down flip the same as a sideways flip ? 521615_525431
no . 525431_526283
sometimes . 526283_527001
is an up down flip the same as a sideways flip ? 527001_530135
the flip never right ? 530135_534221
flipping something up or down is different from flipping it
it does . 546498_547423
+< we know it does now maybe this is the only core square in the
do you think that's true ? 551276_552600
no . 552600_552900
+< do you think we found the one ? 552900_553756
no . 553756_555463
hmm . 555463_556493
a checker board um quilt . 556493_559311
let's try it . 559311_560478
a checker board quilt . 560478_562746
+< I'll make one . 562746_562936
I'll make one . 562936_563896
xxx . 563896_566100
that's okay I'm gonna um +/. 566100_568066
