okay ‡ this is &-um another interview &-um from Redacted_name &-uh for Oregon state university and today I'm interviewing Redacted_name .
&-um Redacted_name ‡ what's your first and last name ?
&-uh Redacted_name Redacted_name .
&=laughs .
Redacted_name .
okay cool .
&=laughs .
now ‡ this gonna be a a kind_of different type of interview .
it's gonna be a_lot_of freestyling but I got in mind how I wanna conceptually wrap this up .
we gonna be speaking for briefly forty five minutes or so .
&-um but really it's just more for them to get a understanding of your linguistics .
this the linguistics department, so they wanna, I guess, understand how you say your words and all that different type of stuff .
+< mhm .
so you_know ‡ just relax, be you, be normal .
we just gonna continue our conversation .
okay .
and &-um I'll just keep you posted with the check times but &-um yeah .
told me your name .
how old are you ?
I'm forty years old .
and I need like +//.
you_know ‡ I know that's not a long drawn-out type answers but give me a couple of those <when it> when it calls for it .
+< oo oh yeah .
I_mean ‡ you know how it go „ I_mean .
forty „ man .
like ‡ &-uh &+y &=exhales for &+f for one thing I_mean like$co my birth name in particular .
I don't really like using it that much, you know what I'm saying .
I like to use my other titles, well not really other titles, but other personifications, how I see myself „ you_know .
but I know your birth name is attached to the universe .
like ‡ that's the first label that you get when you come into this life so I'm not ashamed of my name neither .
it's just what people do with people's names nowadays, from identity theft to +//.
I know cats that been stopped and used other people's names in you_know situations that they put themselves in where <they can't> &+h <well or or> they don't have enough courage to just take a l@l .
+< mhm .
you know what I'm saying, so they'll put your name (be)cause they know you real good .
they'll say +"/.
+" oh ‡ my name is so-and-so .
you_know ‡ they get them to skate .
I know people who been caught up like that .
yeah .
and then you_know identity theft, all that stuff .
so ‡ I just try not to use my birth name but I know <that's the most> I can't change that about myself .
you can change your name legally and it &+w still won't matter .
because yeah ‡ you &+f changed your fate somewhat, but your birthright name, that wasn't given to you by mistake .
that was given to you on purpose .
because when you enter this system, you got karmic laws that you have to &+co to play out .
mm .
because the system is broken .
the system is trying to take a whole thing which is you, the true you, and break you down .
so ‡ it's like if I tell you +"/.
+" you gotta come in my crib .
for example, it's like +"/.
+" before you come in here, you gotta carry those bags outside .
+" then you gotta carry my bags .
+" then you gotta go through the bags and sort all my clothes out for me .
+" then you gotta wash (th)em .
+" then you gotta &+d go buy me some new clothes .
+" <when I don't like> if I don't like a couple of pieces, then you gotta go +//.
like ‡ it's all these strings attached to it when you enter the system .
and some people come with less because they know the system a_little better so they say +"/.
+" unhunh ‡ you ain't gonna put that on me .
but <the system is like> you_know the system is a fractalization .
it's like a body .
like ‡ I useta hear people say +"/.
+" a body is a temple .
nah ‡ a body is a prison .
you hafta make it a temple .
all these millions and trillions and billions of cells in your body, that's a lot to keep track of .
and once they start getting infected, then you got like this this battle going on with inside of you .
you know what I'm saying, if your body was really &+perf perfected you &+wo you shouldn't be getting sick „ period .
you know what I'm saying, but because you get sick and because your mind does things to you as a program to keep you like you always playing chess .
mm .
so ‡ if you ain't the true, you ain't really the one that's in control, that mind'll keep <checking you> checking you all the time „ like .
aw man .
damn .
you know what I am saying because <it's not really in> &+cl it's not really in sync with shit .
+< yeah &=laughs .
it's part of the system too .
oh_my_gosh .
I don't know .
I know I'm just going on and on but like$co this all started from you just asking me about my name .
you know what I'm saying ?
name and age „ bruh .
I'm amazed .
you &+kn word .
nah ‡ that's that's cool though .
that's cool .
I'm &+th I think we're definitely gonna +//.
we are already on five minutes .
we are through that .
&=laughs ay &-um .
word .
xxx .
so ‡ how do you feel about turning forty ?
I_mean ‡ I don't really look at time as age .
I feel like I was born in the same moment that I'm in right now .
I_mean ‡ <unless we freeze time> unless we freeze time , you cannot say the day changed .
+< oo &=laughs .
+< xxx .
the day is continuous .
there is no breaks in day .
our mind tricks us to think that we going to sleep and we waking up .
no ‡ you sleep in two cycles .
this is the part of the dream you can control .
and the one where you so-called fall asleep, that's when you actually awake .
you can't control your body (be)cause your body is made &+f as a suit to play around in this system .
when the true you come out, it's like that first person on Call_Of_Duty or something .
you don't see your arms and your legs and all of that .
like ‡ I think we was touching on this before .
you don't see all of that .
you only see a point of awareness .
and when you so-called wake up, you literally sleeve your body on and zip up a zipper and come out here and start playing .
that shit cool as fuck &=laughs .
yeah man ‡ for real .
on some realness .
you know what I'm saying ?
<and they keep> and the body is so sensitive to this system .
oh ‡ xxx .
that's why it's got nerves and pain <and this> and this .
it's just like keeping a ship with all the pressure right and keeping the compression chambers so ain't no air seeping and all of that .
+< oh_my_god .
that's exactly what it is „ man .
it's a spaceship &=laughs .
oh_man ‡ it's a spaceship .
and you gotta constantly &+g but it's <it's so> &+d it's it's not just a spaceship .
it's everything concentrated into this .
mm .
like ‡ you got stars, planets, empty space, dark space .
all of this is &+k smashed into your body and it's just exploded .
like ‡ this is just the bowels of another big body and we the bacteria in that body .
kind_of like how we talking about the cells .
it's somebody talking about us like that .
mm .
being the cells .
a upside-down pyramid magnifying glass just like we look at ants and shit .
&=laughs .
in their world it's a_lot_of them .
excuse my french, it's a_lot_of them .
but in their world <this looks like> just this yard looks like a whole planet to them .
you know what I'm saying, but to us we just looking at (th)em like +/.
oh_my_gosh that probably look like the coolest shit oh .
being deprived of that for so many years and then being able to see that shit .
+< we like we in &=laughs +//.
and then it's just like us .
we in a aquarium .
somebody's looking at us in a round fish tank, or I believe a square one, a flat square one with two holes in it like two records on top of each_other .
hold_on time out .
that's that flat earth .
so ‡ do you feel like the equivalent of us like jumping out_of a fish tank we would just be flapping on the ground of the floor &+o of the fish tank or some shit .
&=laughs no ‡ when you get out the fish tank, you truly free .
you trying to get out_of the fish tank .
all of this is +/.
<I_mean I'm> I_mean I'm I'm saying the the goldfish or whatever is is truly free when they're out_of the fish tank .
+< the fish tank .
but if they're in the real world and they're just a +//.
or if they're in the you_know world for that example and they just flopping around, <what they> what is the just gonna die ?
+< mhm .
or <they just gonna> nothing's gonna happen ?
well ‡ not in the literal sense &+w &+w when you looking at it like like this .
if you was in a fish tank inside of the ocean and somebody dropped you to the ocean floor and you see all these other &+fi fish just passing you up .
mm .
and you in this tank .
you can't get +/.
mhm .
but so far and you notice and everybody's going a_lot further than you are .
oh yeah .
once you get out, you truly free .
oh ‡ okay .
you see what I'm saying ?
hoo okay .
but the analogy wasn't a great analogy (be)cause <it's a> <somebody will say> a cynic will say +"/.
+" well ‡ that don't make no sense if you in the ocean and of_course you gonna want the freedom (be)cause you see the other fish moving around .
ah okay .
but the jump outside of the fish tank, what I'm saying .
like ‡ we saying this system is broken .
basically this system is okay but the system's been hacked by a virus .
mm .
a virus is in here changing the software doing stuff that it ain't sposta be doing to us .
so ‡ when you have these heavy influences, destructive influences on you, like with your mind and your thoughts and your emotions, it's because something is playing that up that way .
that ain't truly you .
the true you is a baby that knows how to enjoy themselves in the moment .
don't need no friends, don't need no toys .
just could &+m &+m play and just be happy .
get along with everything, love all animals .
you might have a_little fear or something .
some things might scare you because you got this internal defense when something's aggressive like a dog or something .
it might scare you know but it's still being taught by grown+ups to put that fear in you .
(be)cause it's some kids that +/.
so ‡ really you feel like it's the inner thing that that change you or makes you .
+< you're already complete .
yeah .
more or whatever than the outer I guess things .
+< it's the +/.
I_mean .
but the outer circumstance do play a big part in it „ you_know of_course .
but truly you_know if it was you_know just focused on that, it would be no problem .
the biggest punishment I've learned is losing control of your emotions .
okay .
it's not just losing control of your emotions .
you're putting destructive out in the world .
it's like a &+s whole slew of stuff happens .
oh yeah ?
when you speak in a bad way, you cursing somebody .
those are true curses .
mhm .
like ‡ spells are made out_of just words .
like ‡ <you could put> you see a a magician put a spell on somebody and they'll just use words .
they don't needta use a wand or no canteen, no potion .
they could just say something to (th)em somebody and they'd be in a trance .
yeah .
so ‡ words are powerful .
that's one thing .
then if you say real hateful stuff, <it turn some of it> it turn concern into these mortal soulless thoughts that are basically air parasites and they turn into insects and all this other stuff that we see .
+< okay .
so like ‡ you see a insect you ain't never seen before and it's got this long stinger on and all this other +//.
those are manifestations of our thoughts that are rogue .
some of them take shape and wanna whisper in your ear destructive stuff to you all the time .
damn .
you_know and then like say something is innocent you might think is being indecisive .
like saying +"/.
+" baby ‡ where you wanna go eat ?
+" let's go eat at burger king .
+" nah ‡ let's go eat at red lobster .
+" nah ‡ let's go to burger king .
+" nah ‡ let's get +//.
when you do that, you destroy your the gallbladder .
I remember you saying that and &-um .
&=throat:clears .
try not to be indecisive .
indecisive .
frustration attacks your pancreas .
&=laughs .
frustration attacks your pancreas .
mhm .
anger attacks your liver .
mhm .
worry attacks your stomach .
okay .
sadness attacks your lungs .
mhm .
anxiety attacks your heart .
mm .
depression attacks your spine .
and <everything from> &-um &-um &-um like &-um <a_lot_of people> everybody say there's no cure for fibromyalgia, whatever whatever .
fibromyalgia is caused by depression .
mm .
depression puts such a overload on your circuits in your body that they basically look like a bunch of overloaded circuits .
and then you start feeling pain everywhere .
it gets rogue because you done depressed yourself so much that your &+s your body can't take it .
like ‡ you press me down and now I'm short-circuiting .
it's like putting a robot &+in inside of a vice and turning it .
mm .
oh yeah .
you gonna start seeing sparks and them exploding and shit &+a after a while because it's too much pressure .
and then he's putting that on hisself, an internal vice .
we I'm trying to give you a visualization of a vice squeezing somebody in a factory .
oh_my_gosh .
but imagine a internal one that's around your brain .
and your brain is attached to your spine .
ah hurry hurry ‡ you're the worst .
and your brain tells your body what to do and your spine controls everything else .
once that stuff starts to dry up and get crippled and stiff and all that, and you get pain and all your whole body goes to crap .
and ain't no doctor gonna tell you depression causes fibromyalgia but I'm telling you it does .
mm .
and depression is caused by inflammation .
your body has got inflammation somewhere and it's keeping the circulation from getting to your brain so your brain is making destructive chemicals instead_of good ones .
know what that's kind_of reminding me of ?
I seen a movie &-um the other day .
+< what ?
dang ‡ I can't even remember the name of it but it was in theaters right &+n right now .
and they're they're on the plane .
I_mean ‡ they're on the &+s &+sh ship .
mhm .
and it's two of them woke up before the time they was sposta get to the planet and it's like$co six thousand years in the future .
what ?
what is this called ?
this is a movie bouta come out on silver screen ?
yeah ‡ it's already out right now .
it's already out ?
ah ‡ I want to say something like The_Blavity or something but it might not be that .
it might be something else, the ship .
okay .
<I'm 'a> I'm 'a actually look it up right now .
but &-um it's pretty cool .
like ‡ I like the graphics or whatever .
but &-um yeah ‡ they <they on a> they I guess they found another earth with the same type of atmosphere as ours .
right right .
so ‡ they was gonna go there, you_know colonize it, do what they do „ whatever .
but they had like$co I guess six thousand of some of the brightest people on earth .
and they was gonna send them off you_know to do you_know whatever .
it's gonna take six thousand years for the next set of people to come up there .
you_know ‡ that cryogenics, they just perfected it .
mm .
they said they can send human bodies into space as_of today .
and put them in a cryosleep@n state, &+a like frozen .
oh_my_gosh ‡ for just somebody gonna pick that shit up xxx .
&+a &+a <and it's> <and they> and they could go like$co a thousand years on a ship and wake up and still age just a little bit because they basically frozen at the right temperature that the cells don't crystallize and kill themselves (be)cause that's how you die .
when you starting to freeze your body's systems will slow way down .
and some people be frozen all the way solid and then thaw out and be &+f perfectly fine .
+< mhm .
so ‡ there's stories like that .
I've seen a lady trapped up under the ice that was +/.
what do you think your cells is doing when it's completely cold like that ?
see ‡ one of two things can happen .
it slows the heart rate down so slow that you basically &+i suspended in time .
or the &+ce &+s something happens where the cells crystallize, and once they start to turn into crystals, they bust through the cell walls .
and you basically bleed to death and ooze out all your cell matter into your body because there's crystallizing you in a artificial way .
+< &=laughs .
so ‡ your body's sposta be crystal .
oh yeah .
you know your phone and your tv, all that's liquid crystal display .
LCD .
that's what your body is .
oh ‡ for real ?
liquid crystal .
what happens to water when you freeze it ?
that's what that &+s stood for ?
&+hwa &-um I guess it look you_know crystal I guess .
yeah ‡ what happens to rock candy &+r when you put sugar and water together and you hang a string from it ?
it turn into crystals .
<oh yeah> oh yeah true true .
it crystalizes .
mhm .
you know what I'm saying, your body is the same thing .
it's made of water and all of that .
mhm .
and when you freeze it, water turns into crystal .
oh_man .
but there's a way of tuning up water where you raise the vibrational frequency of water and it turns into quartz instead_of rock candy, or it turns into rose quartz or calcite or mold, you_know something that you hafta mine out_of a cave .
and be like +"/.
+" yo ‡ water helped make this limestone like been dripping for a thousand years and now it made these huge stalactites that's in this cave .
water is some amazing shit but it could get polluted .
crystals don't really +//.
they can't get polluted .
they absorb energy off of shit .
and yeah ‡ they can overload but all you gotta do is put (th)em in the sun or under a full moon and they fully recharge .
you can't do that with water .
<you could pour> I could pour a sludge in that shit right now and fucking put that shit in the sun and the moon and it's still gonna be sludge in that shit in the morning .
you know what I'm saying .
it gotta be pure .
<it's gotta be> &+pu it's hard to keep water pure because we in such a fucking riddled virus environment .
the virus wants to keep shit polluted .
it wants you to think crazy .
it wants to put all this <on him> on &+s on you so you could keep feeding it .
because see ‡ the thing that is the reason why this virus is here because it needs to feed .
and the only way you can feed on something is by making it scared .
oh ‡ okay .
it's like <you can't> you can't +//.
like ‡ if some vampires came in here right now, if you just riddled with fear, you gonna get bit .
okay .
but if you standing there waiting with a stake and some holy water and a super soaker gun and some garlic and shit, you're ready for whatever .
+< yeah .
what_if you just standing there and you not with all that shit ?
see ‡ sometimes you could go to another place „ like .
mhm .
you_know ‡ that's the one dimensional way of defending yourself .
but then you might turn something on inside of you that (be)cause you different, and be able to fight the vampires, head up .
+< yeah .
oh ‡ shit .
yeah .
you_know ‡ but that it's it's all about keeping this defense up all the time .
like ‡ it ain't true peace here because the system's been hacked .
whatever jumped in here thirty five hundred BC really messed everything up „ man .
that's the real thing of everything .
oh ‡ the thing with the ship though, they built it to be an &+ish indestructible ship .
but &-um I guess somewhere in they calculations they didn't plan for a big-ass meteorite to just come slap that shit .
oh ‡ wow .
wow .
slap the fuck out that bitch but it destroyed .
so ‡ that shit still rolling around pretty_much impenetrable or whatever .
+< mm .
but shit malfunctioning now .
mm .
six thousand people still asleep .
you_know ‡ ain't nobody gonna survive being on that ship for six thousand years just to make it to that other planet .
you can't turn back around .
it's gonna take you like$co three hundred &-um years to get back home and shit like that .
or you was probably like$co halfway out or some shit .
right .
over with for your ass .
mm .
so ‡ they going around throughout this ship after they realize (be)cause they ain't realize til much later on that the ship was actually fucked up .
that's the reason they was out in the first place .
right .
and then &-um they actually hadta fix the ship or at least try to .
well ‡ see the sleep state is not to keep +//.
it's just to keep your body in a state of unconsciousness .
yeah .
well ‡ then you ain't on no planet .
there's no time .
that's why there's no such thing as time .
if you was in the spaceship right now, how would you keep track of the time ?
if you away from our sun and you away from our earth, how would you be able to keep track of time ?
oh yeah yeah .
it's impossible .
it's impossible because there's no way +/.
you gonna have nowhere to start either .
this is a program for you to count how many times the sun and the moon go up to make you age .
if you could tune that shit out and know you timeless, <you could> &+lis &+l your body will last <longer than> &+proba just as long as the earth itself (be)cause you made of the earth and you made of space stuff .
+< woah .
like ‡ it don't make sense that we dying in a hundred years or &+l &+li life expectally@n lesser than that .
it's because_of the emotions .
the emotions sink so deep into your organs, if you don't know how to get (th)em out, they stay in there .
and the only thing I've noticed that get (th)em out is those frequencies .
like ‡ you can take anger out immediately .
you can take somebody having a gallbladder attack and let them listen to a indecisive binaural beat and their gallbladder will miraculously loosen up .
like ‡ I've experienced all that, hernias and just listen to solar plexus healing and you_know opening your root up .
a_lot_of people's roots are closed .
all of this is is you_know the things that people +//.
+< okay .
like ‡ &+exa for example the police brutality .
okay .
or the police shootings .
mhm .
if <a_lot more> &+fuc a_lot more people was putting crystals and stuff in their car, you_know they have might have a quartz crystal here and some charcoal pile right on the floor smudging their car with white sage and stuff like that .
+< mhm .
yeah .
you're gonna have a less lot &+m run-ins than just jumping out here scared every time you see a cop .
that's true .
I_mean ‡ <it's the f> it's the &+f whole fear factor thing that makes you feel like the prey all the time .
if you stop feeling like prey, then you'll stop being hunted .
dang .
instantly right there .
I_mean ‡ I know some &+a some hard dudes, and soon as the cops come around, they be like +"/.
&=laughs .
+" don't look to the side .
+" don't look over your shoulder .
+" your seatbelt on and all this .
I'm just like +"/.
+" dog ‡ just be +//.
+" &+e I_mean ‡ you're not a criminal .
+" you out here, you just enjoying your vehicle .
yeah ‡ but sometimes you don't gotta be &=laughs +/.
you know what I'm saying, and even like I told you, my experience .
mhm .
everything will be okay when it's sposta be okay .
just when you know it's gonna be okay it's gonna be alright .
that's how I be trynna go in this situation .
(be)cause most of them motherfuckers I'm around don't +//.
excuse_me ‡ most of the people I'm around don't live they life like that .
mhm .
nah ‡ that's good .
you be keeping good company .
yeah man ‡ I've always been around a_lot_of humble good people like yourself „ man .
so ‡ where are you from ?
I'm from Redacted_address Connecticut .
Redacted_place Connecticut .
how long have you been living in Atlanta ?
since nineteen eighty eight .
oh ‡ nineteen eighty eight „ okay .
October twenty second, nineteen eighty eight .
so ‡ <you really pretty_much> even_though Atlanta I guess been a a &+s forefront type city, but you &+s definitely seen Atlanta on the rise though .
yeah ‡ I remember +/.
eighties and nineties til two thousands .
+< boy .
yeah man ‡ Redacted_place Redacted_place and Redacted_place , I've seen change dramatically .
wow .
I_mean ‡ before &-uh when Freaknik and AU and all of that was popping .
different world and all of those shows was on &-uh television .
like ‡ Atlanta was on the uprise then .
like ‡ I was really enjoying the city at around those times around the first Freakniks and all of that .
not like I was +//.
you_know ‡ I ain't know what Freaknik was .
I just happened to go downtown .
&=laughs .
actually I was going to buy some sneakers from Walter's and I got on the train .
+< oo .
legendary .
and I was at Doraville station and when we got to Chamblee the train kept going .
+< mhm .
xxx .
it was a whole bunch of people on the docks and I'm like +"/.
+" what's going on ?
they didn't stop the train &+un all the way until we got to Lenox .
yeah .
so ‡ I get off at Lenox and it's a bunch of people on the train waiting for the train to transfer .
okay .
I go to get to five points and when I walked outside it was just oceans of people .
like ‡ I've never seen that many people in my life .
and I was like +"/.
&=laughs .
+" what is going on ?
yeah .
and they was like +"/.
+" Freaknik .
like ‡ what the heck is a Freaknik ?
+< xxx .
Freaknik .
man ‡ and I_mean <that was a> it was aggravating to me (be)cause you_know the the traffic was just stupid .
the traffic was stupid .
and the way they treated those students was just ridiculous .
like ‡ there was venues and things for them to do and the cops just like it's a police state like blocking off exits and forcing people to stay on the highway .
that that's ridiculousness .
let people go where they want to go .
xxx .
you know what I'm saying .
if you it's making the city money and they enjoying your city +//.
and that's &+w a a what cities want, they want that tourist money .
like ‡ when them &+s kids useta come a hundred thousand strong, hundred and fifty thousand strong .
man ‡ I &+m +/.
they talked about the trash and all that but they ain't never talked about how many millions of dollars they made in that &+m that weekend .
they don't talk about it .
needta bring up the projections .
<it's been> it's been petitions to bring Freaknik back but I think it's over with .
I think .
nah ‡ <that was a> &+cl that's a closed chapter .
that's a old era from a great decade .
&=laughs .
the nineties .
&=laughs it a &+n &=laughs +/.
it's a old era from a great decade .
&=laughs I_mean ‡ it really is .
they brung back everything else from the nineties .
yeah man .
&+a it's like right now I'm just still living out a poor rendition of the nineties .
oo .
like ‡ &+n dudes is coming back with boxes and high rights and and dying their hair tips and all of that .
+< a poor rendition &=laughs .
like ‡ I seen that when I was young .
you not gonna see no dude out here with no afro, no butterfly collar, no bellbottoms .
you really ain't gonna see no dude in no flyaway break jacket .
but you might .
and some tight Levi's and +//.
you not gonna see that .
you might .
you might .
you gonna see a nigga &+w dressed like a nineties dude or a two thousand seventeen dude with just like +//.
I don't know, I just can't +/.
okay .
nah nah ‡ you you you definitely right about that .
you definitely &+r about right about that .
mm yeah .
do you think it's gonna &+b come a time where they go to the bellbottoms ?
or the +/?
I hope not .

+" use of bear's grease among their native americans on the hair to make it shinier was widespread .
+" other &+s popular substance included dear marrow and raccoon fat .
mhm .
+" in the northeast tribes of the Sauk Huron and Delaware, the daily use of bear grease on their hair was popular among both men and women .
mhm .
+" men in the Dakota Sioux and cow tribes also regularly used bear's grease .
+" Benjamin_West, who was one of the early american fine artists, said he was taught how to make paint as a child by a native american friend who showed him how paint could be made by mixing clay with bear grease .
man ‡ you know how many numbers I still know by heart ?
like ‡ I know your number by heart .
I know .
&=exhales .
like ‡ five or six of my &+n homies' numbers by heart, all my cousins in Connecticut .
I I don't let this technology dumb me down „ man .
(be)cause that's all it does .
like ‡ you gotta step away from things and keep doing stuff .
like ‡ I be correcting my kids so much just on common sense stuff .
common sense „ huh .
like ‡ what are you doing ?
&=laughs like ‡ won't you just do this and it just be the simplest thing ?
and they just don't get the concept of connecting it no more .
and I just was like +"/.
+" what is going on ?
it's gotta be this technology .
&=laughs .
&=throat:clears that's why I don't like being <in all> in front of no computer screen for too long .
no video game, tv, nothing .
man ‡ I know xxx &=laughs .
like ‡ I just be here trying to keep my brain so my body don't fall apart (be)cause that's all it's doing .
&=laughs .
&=laughs it it's making dudes lazy .
I got so much electronic stuff around me right now .
I can't stop touching it either „ man .
&=laughs yeah ‡ and that's so not good for you „ man .
that shit is got like &+s these heavy wifi signals coming out that shit &+cau +//.
you should see what wifi does to the body .
it causes cancer so quick .
and all these mutations in your cells and +/.
xxx .
oh_my &=sound_effect .
and then just being in front of AC stuff .
it's that's called electromagnetic toxicity because your body is DC .
you direct current .
your head is negative .
well ‡ actually half of your body's negative, other half is positive .
yeah .
but you could also perceive it as the hands and the feet being negative .
those are your outlets .
and the head being positive .
so ‡ <when you> that's like a battery you put in your remote .
AC is all your electronic devices which is <plus minus> <plus minus> <plus minus> plus minus real fast .
mhm .
it's a alternating current .
you a direct current .
yeah .
when that alternating current hits this direct current body, you got one that's flowing straight and another one that's jagged .
+< mm yeah okay okay .
when you intersect the two, the one that's straight, it's impossible for it to stay straight because it's got all this +//.
so ‡ what your heart, let's say, is v@l one oh three .
when that &+h shit hits it, &=exhales it's one oh three point one .
you can't barely hear the radio station just by <them two little> that one little turn .
oh .
your heart is not beating right no more .
oh_man .
your brain frequency sposta be at ninety seven point five and then that damn AC hit that shit and that shit turns it down to ninety seven point three .
you can't hear nothing but static .
and then the more shit you turn on, it &+kno keeps knocking the points down .
you know what I'm saying, like that shit is no joke „ man .
and that shit is hard to detox that (be)cause your body don't understand artificial toxins .
like ‡ it's hard to get rid of chemical toxins .
&-uh the best way to get rid of (th)em is to run them out .
that's why people sit in saunas and go exercise and get a good sweat .
that's the best way to get out chemical poison .
oh_man .
but &+electrom electromagnetic poisoning and emotional poisoning and that shit is some hard shit to get rid of „ boy .
hold_on so ‡ if let's say, hypothetically or whatever, if I start working out, like$co really physically going for it in a good healthy type of way, will will that have my my inner cells in my body living a better life amongst themselves or something ?
+< mhm .
+< that's a investment .
of_course ‡ because when you exercise you release chemicals .
+< oh_man .
okay .
your brain starts to spit out chemicals .
it's just like when you don't exercise, <your body's> your mind is basically saying or your brain is basically saying +"/.
+" this body don't really wanna shit so let me start killing it off some .
(be)cause you feel like you just ain't no motion to it .
oh .
oh_man .
so ‡ it lets cortisol and all of these these &+m these heavy hormones that make your body go out_of wack .
you start retaining fat and all this other stuff .
xxx .
but if you in motion +/.
mm .
yeah ‡ <but if you in mo> but it's about that sweating .
sweating ‡ can't fake the funk with that .
<it's not about> <you can't> yeah ‡ and ain't no beating that out .
it take a_lot more for some people to sweat than others .
yeah ‡ that's (be)cause a_lot_of people got diabetes and they don't know it .
oh_my_god .
like ‡ it's so many people out here with &+pr prediabetic or diabetic and don't even know they got that shit .
(be)cause it's just too much sugar in everything .
it's too much sugar in everything .
you can't eat a +/.
in everything .
you can't get away from that .
eat a piece of bread .
yeah ‡ you tripping .

eating at whole foods will get you all through that .
yeah ‡ more cooked meals with healthy options that'll clean your body out .

you would think <we would be> &+f we would be rocking with plants a_lot more .
<we could> we coulda made &+pl this &+a be a great home for plants .
we are plants .
we are not animals .
plants and trees .
we can't be animals .

when when you see a lion eat a buffalo, that lion has the power in its jaws and its claws to break the buffalo's neck, to bite through that tough-ass hide and eat that shit raw .
okay .
right ‡ the &+l way it is through fur and everything .
they don't spit it out .
they eating bugs and lice and whatever else and then they get to the gut and devour the bowels .
they have blood all over they face .
ain't nothing cooked .
I ain't even think about all of that .
and they'll eat that .
yeah .
you can't do that .
you go try and go bite a dog's skin off and see how far it gets you .
&+f &+m more_or_less a cow or a buffalo .
you can't even penetrate that without a knife .
oh_my_god .
your canines is underdeveloped .
