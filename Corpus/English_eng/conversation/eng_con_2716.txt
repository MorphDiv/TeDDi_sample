the school bus passed by when he fixed his shoelace when he ripped
and he hadta walk to school .
and his teacher said you're tardy .
and all the class was working working working .
and he told the teacher what happened to his shoelace .
and the teacher put him to work .
the end .
&-um once upon a time there was a boy and a girl .
and they went to the park to play .
and the boy was really scared .
but his sister wasn't .
he was excited .
but the boy saw those aliens that were coming out_of the ship .
and he said no wait stop there's aliens .
and he also saw an alien dog .
they were packing from their ship .
and he saw a mother a father a baby girl and a dog .
he saw the ship .
and they're going to earth to play .
so then he grabbed his sister's arm .
and his sister saw the aliens .
they ran home and told their mom and dad .
but then once they got there the aliens and the ship were gone .
