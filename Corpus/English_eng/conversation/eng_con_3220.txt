xxx . 1_2501
well, just talk about anything you want to talk about . 2501_3588
alright . 3588_4331
uh, xxx . 4331_13995
oh really ? 13995_14618
right . 14618_15075
well, that's an astute observation . 15075_17363
we'll keep that on tape . 17363_18373
just read it out loud for me . 18373_20626
topics, statistics, type one and type two errors, decision matrix,
ok, great . 30986_31906
thanks . 31906_32598
I whipped that out from under you . 32598_34935
&=laughs ok, um, just to start out with did you have any particular
well, I don't know if I really got the basic grip on all of
0 . 54780_55146
ok . 55146_55908
well, we can just go through it and see what happens . 55908_58850
ok . 59060_59598
if you, interrupt if you have any specific concerns you want to
ok . 65238_66373
you remember coming from last week, and just sort of the general
they allow us to make inferences or general, generalizations . 76998_81836
0 right . 81836_82236
about what the sample compared to the population . 82236_88428
in other words . 88428_89525
by using the sample . 89525_90493
we can, we can . 90493_92285
make an inference . 92285_92965
yeah . 92965_93396
and it allows us to determine what, to what degree we are sure the
uh huh . 102331_103668
what you said just in different terms . 103668_106091
ok . 106091_106645
alright, but even if a researcher has made sure that he or she has
no . 125270_129708
ok . 129708_130301
why not ? 130301_130883
um it could just be, um, by chance . 130883_136901
uh huh . 136901_137795
factor xxx . 137795_139931
that's fine . 139931_141226
in other words, you're right . 141226_142803
it could be error, it could be sampling error or measurement error,
that's the whole point, that's whole reason why we need inferential
it is, is a way, kind of assessing how much error we have in our
(o)kay ? 164086_164758
so that's really the whole point . 164758_166996
if you remember that, you know, even if you've done, very precise
there's still error . 177973_179196
there's going to be error . 179196_180085
this is not a perfect world, or whatever . 180085_182213
at least not our measure of it . 182213_184196
and that's the whole point of using inferential statistics . 184196_187796
xxx what happens and how much of that is xxx . 187796_194676
ok . 194676_196301
so, you've got xxx descriptive statistics . 196301_202131
but before we do anything in experimentation we've got to have our
right . 205980_206651
ok . 206651_207226
so, what two types of hypotheses do we usually deal with ? 207226_210860
the null and the alternate xxx . 210860_214403
ok . 214403_214826
so, what is the null symbolized as ? 214826_218795
h@l o@l . 218795_219426
ok . 219426_220083
and what does it state ? 220083_221105
it states that there is no difference between the means of the
ok . 228168_228656
in other words . 228656_230688
equals . 230688_232608
our population, our sample mean equals our population mean, or our
right . 240443_241025
to each other . 241025_241610
right . 241610_242210
if you drew two samples from the population then they'd be equal . 242210_247170
0 yeah . 247170_247730
in other words, you usually speak of testing, testing means, so you
so, xxx testing means, the null hypothesis means the means are
0 . 262201_262896
right . 262896_263360
ok . 263360_264440
what else does it mean then in terms of independent and dependent
our means are equal, that means our sample, our two samples
in other words, our independent variable had no effect . 294050_300360
or significant effect . 300360_304431
oh, I see what you're saying . 304431_306455
so . 306455_306950
see ? 306950_307575
what the null means is the population means are equal, I mean our
if it had an effect then you would expect them to be different . 318710_321330
ok . 321330_321955
that's the whole point of testing groups . 321955_324258
alright . 324258_324810
so no matter what you xxx independent variable . 324998_329413
well, you're usually only testing it as per one research endeavor .
right . 336168_336631
in other words, um, just using the example, xxx what might be an
0 . 351646_352013
if you had x@l one equals five hours of study; x@l two equals ten
ok . 364476_365805
in terms of this . 365805_366451
ok . 366451_368323
and our dependent measure xxx . 368323_377128
so these . 377128_378128
in terms of the null then, the null hypothesis is gong to say the
the mean performance, the mean test score these two groups is going
in other words, xxx . 387920_391046
0 ok . 391046_391448
I understand it . 391448_393416
ok . 393416_394280
so that's all it, I mean, it all says several things . 394280_397256
I mean, when you look, when you, when you talk about coming from
in other words, if the i_v had an effects, then, in other words,
they don't differ . 410320_410991
they do not differ according to this characteristic of hours of
you know . 415431_416748
0 . 416748_417700
that confusing ? 417700_419270
no, that's, that's clear . 419270_420548
I xxx confuse . 420548_421091
ok . 421091_422020
alright . 422020_422868
in other words, the null hypothesis states that the independent
right . 432940_433308
the mean for them is going to be the same no matter which condition
that's the null . 437331_438236
ok . 438236_440171
and then the alternative hypothesis . 440171_442906
xxx h@l one . 442906_447145
says what ? 447145_448368
the means are different . 448368_450896
right . 450896_451423
it means that your independent variable had an effect . 451423_456743
right . 456743_457846
when we, when we say “had no significant effect, effect” that means
by convention what's usually um, considered significant is the
in other words, ninety five percent confidence that our results are
in other words, you're ninety five percent sure that, there's
uh huh . 502953_503318
well, in this case
ok . 514598_514966
the way all this works &=laughs . 514966_515674
ok . 515674_515914
let's get into it . 515914_517179
alright . 517179_517436
when we speak about ok, let's probably in other words the
ok, first of all, the logic behind using the null and alternative
in other words, we speak of rejecting or failing to reject the null
ok ? 545296_545745
uh huh . 545745_546153
alright . 546153_546865
the independent, if you reject the null then you say that the
the null is an exact statement . 555391_558185
it says that the population means are exactly equal, Ok ? 558185_561658
this allows us to calculate precisely the probability of the
ok ? 568061_570538
if you calculated exactly it'd be the exact same because both sides
and you do that with our sampling distribution, Ok ? 577113_580161
ok . 580161_580786
you have a sampling distribution of the means, Ok ? 580786_584970
of all possible means . 584970_586536
ok ? 586536_589873
xxx distribution numbers xxx . 589873_592428
xxx people say it's a theoretical xxx distribution . 592428_597395
not a particular number of xxx, Ok ? 597395_599908
0 . 599908_600291
if the null hypothesis is true, that is if the population means are
ok . 613076_615371
ok ? 615371_615906
in other words, if we have xxx you know, kind of out there
and it's from that sampling distribution that xxx standard normal
to get probability out of ? 640561_642521
yes . 642521_643105
that's where that comes from . 643105_643840
ok . 643840_644385
this sampling distribution . 644385_646688
ok ? 646688_647288
um, well, when we talk about probabilities, we are looking at
ok ? 660410_660831
alright, when the null is true, that means the population is equal .
alright . 666215_666846
the population is equal, Ok ? 666846_668471
so, if we draw a sample from that population so there's, it's not,
your . 675335_676318
0 . 676318_676711
alright ? 676711_677623
we're going to get some variance, in other words, from error
yeah . 685510_685870
you're not just xxx the sample, Ok ? 685870_687766
um, we can look at the probability of xxx to the chances that that,
say if we got, uh, you know, the ten hour study people had
I mean a mean ninety five . 705605_707156
the five hours had a mean seventy five . 707156_708845
there's a certain, um +... 708845_711460
when you test the mean, there's a certain, we can look at the
have occurred even while the null is still true . 718700_723663
in other words, due to sampling error we got the result . 723663_726966
but, if the probability of the chances that that result could have
but that's, I mean we accept the alternative there and reject the
and, ah +... 747678_749675
what we talked about the confidence level at point o@l five is that
in other words there is a five percent change that there really is
right . 772726_774358
ok so that's what that deals with . 774358_776855
and as far as the you know, the five percent I mean, that's
ok . 785450_785896
in fact, a lot more xxx ninety nine percent point o@l one alpha
these days, point o@l one is a little more, xxx it's often
I don't mean reliable xxx aaaah . 804071_805720
&=laughs . 805720_806000
it's so hart to talk about statistics and use a word that you use
right . 811328_811696
&=laughing . 811696_812200
you know ? 812200_812591
it has some sort of meaning . 812591_814296
but, you know, Ok . 814296_816206
so did, did that answer what you were talking about ? 816206_818166
in other words, the probability is just what reference is used to
in other words, the differences between these, the samples, will
in other words, it's the question “what is the probability of
If the chances of obtaining that result are very small if only
+" Well <hey> something else is operating . 850316_851941
in other words xxx . 851941_855468
0 . 855468_855973
0 . 855973_858160
yeah, I, I +/. 858160_858840
see if you can explain it back to me a little bit . 858840_861688
ok . 861788_862140
so I can get a handle on what you think . 862140_863748
um proba, probability we're saying that there's a five percent
we're ninety five percent confident . 881818_883336
percent confident . 883336_885953
that the, um it turns . 885953_887185
the results couldn't have occurred by chance . 887185_889376
by chance . 889376_889745
there's a five percent chance that it still might be random error,
0 but we're ninety five percent sure that
that we can reject the null xxx . 900695_907435
right . 907435_908275
now can we, can we ninety five percent confident accept the
ok . 916043_917370
you usually &=laughs . 917370_919105
&=laughs . 919105_919561
sure . 919561_920866
well, the way it works is that you look at your probability is
you say that you are, we're ninety five percent confident of our
well, that could, I mean the confidence, I mean, what you're saying
in other words, the chance that +... 948705_950168
0 +... 950168_956336
you're ninety five percent confident means that you're ninety five
ok . 963120_964231
ok ? 964231_965128
so what you're saying is that you're ninety five percent sure that
if they are significant at the, at the point o@l five level, then
that means they're not due to random error . 979015_981438
ok, in that, if they have a true difference, then you accept the
right . 986575_986975
ok . 986975_987585
in other words we reject the null . 987585_989148
ok . 989148_989515
alright ? 989515_993506
&=chuckles alright . 993506_994451
ok . 994451_996386
alright . 996386_998041
when the sampling distribution xxx distribution xxx what you use to
ok . 1008595_1009658
in other words, we use the same conditions to figure out what are
ok . 1021561_1022690
sample size . 1022690_1023905
just to talk a little bit more about samples . 1023905_1026553
what happens as our sample size increases ? 1026553_1031100
the probability of random guessing decreases . 1031100_1037576
well, Ok, sure . 1037576_1039161
in other words, we're more likely to obtain an accurate estimate . 1039161_1043208
in other words . 1043208_1043856
right . 1043856_1044351
if we had a population, sometimes we have a population that
0 . 1066008_1066735
you know, there's much less, much greater precision just by virtue
in other words I mean obviously you're going to have to xxx to
right . 1085101_1089925
ok . 1089925_1090989
ok . 1090989_1097916
ok . 1097916_1098301
um, the t_tests and the f_tests xxx . 1098301_1101235
uh huh . 1101235_1101810
primary inferential statistics talked about . 1101810_1105378
when do we want to use that t_test ? 1105378_1108083
when you have xxx between two groups . 1108083_1113281
yeah, or xxx, right ? 1113281_1115018
right . 1115018_1116073
um the F_test then, helps xxx there's more . 1116073_1124771
more . 1124771_1125468
more than two . 1125468_1126291
right . 1126291_1126661
ok . 1126661_1127273
alright, so we need to either, either xxx statistical test we need
xxx our hypothesis xxx . 1134291_1140005
our null hypothesis in terms of this experiment are what ? 1140005_1144620
that uh &=gestures +... 1144620_1148868
study time xxx . 1148868_1150163
oh . 1150163_1151028
that five hours of study will equal ten hours of study on the test
in other words, the means are not going to differ . 1158291_1160588
right . 1160588_1160828
significantly . 1160828_1161608
in other words, those, changing the amount of studying make any
right . 1168403_1168723
according to the alternative hypothesis .
that there will be a difference . 1172681_1173721
in other words, studying different amounts will change the mean
right . 1178753_1179041
in other words, xxx . 1179041_1183830
ok ? 1183830_1185863
independent variables, that's another question . 1185863_1191263
independent variables xxx ? 1191263_1194110
ok, in this study independent variables, yes, xxx . 1194110_1198381
independent variable is the variable that you manipulate ? 1198381_1200870
right . 1200870_1201701
or, or if it's something like gender, xxx “hmm we're going to make
right . 1207541_1208045
complex surgical procedures anyway, it can be the observed, you
xxx . 1213796_1216045
but, you know, you're supposed to have xxx groups there's different
ok, and xxx . 1222636_1224556
0 . 1224556_1227820
xxx ok . 1227820_1231261
alright . 1231261_1232475
so, we've specified our hypothesis . 1232475_1234820
ok . 1234820_1235131
what else do we have to do before we xxx or a xxx test ? 1235131_1240836
. 1240836_1243051
have you thought about that xxx ? 1243051_1247995
xxx . 1247995_1248523
determine the probability, or significance level . 1248523_1251281
significance level . 1251281_1251496
ok . 1251496_1251881
we set our significance level, ok ? 1251881_1253225
and by convention in social sciences xxx use the point o@l five
ok ? 1258441_1258985
in other words, you're not going to, you're not going to believe
probability chance that our results occurred randomly under the
ok ? 1284648_1285865
in other words, only if you're ninety five percent sure, only if
and say “oh, xxx rejecting our null and excepting our alternative
ok ? 1304176_1306650
point o@l five means that there's still a five percent chance xxx
in other words, the statistical term that our results, there's a
ok ? 1322128_1323288
0 . 1323288_1324216
but, there's a ninety five percent chance that we're ninety five
so, do we always try to prove the alternative ? 1331063_1334415
ok, we don't, that's the tough part . 1334415_1336631
usually, what I get out of this book is that they're not as
xxx usually you speak in terms of accepting and rejecting the null,
you could, I mean if you think about it logically, how could you
right . 1354606_1354878
I mean, 'cause you can't with the null hypothesis . 1354878_1358425
that's not logistically even really xxx, you know ? 1359638_1363231
xxx what kind of population xxx, whole population . 1363231_1369020
um so you usually don't see xxx . 1369020_1374706
you know ? 1374706_1376211
I mean, how could you ever prove the null ? 1376211_1378578
you know, if you think about our type one and type two errors you
oh . 1386506_1386850
in other words, so, you know, but, um, I think different
you don't usually talk in terms of “proving” anything xxx . 1403171_1407273
I mean, like we were talking about there's always going to be some
uh huh . 1414673_1415136
but, it's just that statistics and a whole lot of social science
ok . 1424560_1426880
ok . 1426880_1429625
we've specified our hypothesis, we've specified our significance
what might you think this one would be ? 1441233_1443086
well two_tailed . 1443086_1453253
(be)cause you're specifying that there's going to be a
ok . 1463853_1464773
well, but that's really not what two tailed and one tailed is
you choose a two tailed test when you, Ok, for all this
do you see ? 1483325_1484205
no . 1484205_1484588
I mean, we don't go around in science trying to prove
we're trying to look at the relationships, Ok ? 1489508_1492716
ok, so a two_tailed test means that we, oh Ok, our alternative
in other words, we're not sure which one is going to be greater
but for, you know, intuitive reasons hopefully based on, you know,
then, it's a directional test, or a one tailed . 1528795_1532833
now one more time, what do you think ? 1532833_1534945
I would say one_tailed . 1534945_1540761
ok . 1540761_1541170
sure . 1541170_1541713
why ? 1541713_1542201
ten hours study would be positive direction over five hours . 1542201_1547200
right . 1547200_1547968
in other words, Ok, one_tailed means that one side is just greater
right . 1552488_1552776
obviously xxx . 1552776_1559953
ok ? 1559953_1561783
so, on the graph then, the one_tail is when we pile all of our
the two_tailed, on the other hand, is when xxx . 1570006_1581648
our interval xxx distribution
that would mean, let's say if you knew absolutely nothing about
uh huh . 1602608_1602846
ok, you'd use a two_tail and it would look like that
do you always divide your significance level by two in a
well, that's what it is . 1619685_1620931
it's whatever confidence level you choose . 1620931_1622931
if you tested at point o@l one for a one_tailed test, then all of
we want them to be, um, all at one end for a one_tailed . 1639621_1643540
uh huh . 1643540_1644003
so, that's point o@l one . 1644003_1645380
if it was a two_tailed it would be point o@l one divided by two . 1645380_1648163
that would be . 1648163_1648891
o@l o@l point o@l two, point o@l five or whatever it is . 1648891_1654515
xxx . 1654515_1654875
whatever . 1654875_1655523
yeah . 1655523_1656026
anyway, you'd have half of it over here and half of it over here
ok, so you xxx the critical t@l in any situation in which your
in other words, one group is greater than the other . 1674660_1676896
or you can run a two_tail in a situation in which you do not
and the reason you do that is, because like I said, the critical
0 . 1689941_1692730
alright if you look on page one hundred and
0 . 1698136_1699416
the critical value for a t_test, you have to exceed a critical
see that ? 1706296_1706848
Uh huh . 1706848_1707248
ok, whereas on the one tailed, with all this clustered on one side,
so the advantage of using one_tailed is that you don't have to get
the disadvantage is if you choose the wrong direction you're out of
so let me ask you one . 1726608_1730816
if something fell within this region . 1730816_1733775
uh huh . 1733775_1734183
I would, I would say that is not significant ? 1734183_1742238
no, that's when it is . 1742238_1743261
if your critical value, ok, your t_test, we haven't really talked
your critical value of t, in other words, let me rephrase that . 1748415_1755905
if you're xxx . 1756270_1759610
you do all the calculations and get a value . 1759610_1763561
it's called your t_value, Ok ? 1763561_1765033
Uh huh . 1765033_1765888
you compare that to a critical value of t@l which comes from one of
and if your critical value of t, like in this example xxx
xxx, ok ? 1789288_1791183
ok . 1791183_1791875
let's look at what goes on when we calculate a t_test . 1791875_1796226
o . 1796226_1814818
thanks . 1814818_1815210
it could fall down on top xxx . 1815210_1819010
ok . 1819010_1819641
a t_test is a radio of two types of variance, Ok ? 1819641_1829471
right ? 1829471_1830865
0 . 1830865_1833346
are you with me ? 1833346_1836495
xxx looking at my notes xxx . 1836495_1839863
ok . 1839863_1840436
so, in other word, what two types of variance ? 1840436_1846223
um the within group is on the denominator . 1846223_1854133
0 . 1854133_1861470
that'd be the top part . 1861470_1863053
um +... 1863053_1873675
ok . 1873675_1875296
xxx ok, what this means is xxx one dependent measure, Ok . 1875296_1889560
this is an estimate of how much these two
xxx in other words, how much the mean of this group differs from
0 . 1909118_1910231
0 . 1910231_1910655
ok . 1910655_1911101
the within groups measures what
the difference among them ? 1915006_1921045
xxx would that be the grand mean ? 1921045_1927998
no . 1927998_1928741
ok . 1928741_1929286
grand mean refers to another xxx . 1929286_1931508
that's an f_test . 1931508_1932573
we're talking about a t_test here . 1932573_1934846
ok . 1934846_1936853
within groups variability is to determine how much variability
in other words, xxx within the x@l one only how much variability is
ok . 1952731_1952971
so your response to xxx study five hours the difference between
right . 1956498_1956891
how much do they differ from each other . 1956891_1958450
ok ? 1958450_1959685
right . 1959685_1960333
right . 1960333_1960893
got that ? 1960893_1961541
yes . 1961541_1961900
ok . 1961900_1962356
it's expressed in terms, in other words, the x@l one people are
you know, there's going to be a, an average of each of those five
right . 1972788_1973300
how much does one of the people that studied five hours differ from
that would just, like, x@l one minus x@l ? 1979588_1984500
well, in that instance it would be a sums of squares or a, I mean,
ok . 2000276_2000770
in other words, xxx answer that for sure go back to your statistics
yeah . 2008395_2008675
standard deviation and then the variance and all that . 2008675_2011561
ok, in other words xxx . 2011561_2016268
0 . 2016268_2016941
and xxx . 2016941_2022011
right . 2022011_2022563
xxx how much is xxx ? 2022563_2029986
twenty two . 2029986_2031655
xxx ok . 2031655_2035525
alright . 2035525_2036971
so a value of t, just looking at it logically as well as
ok, the difference within the groups decreases, the estimate of
t_value . 2062850_2064411
will increase ? 2064411_2065380
because see, I mean, like, alright, the difference between groups,
say the difference between them xxx, Ok ? 2072586_2079171
the difference between them is five . 2079171_2081563
ok ? 2081563_2082083
and this is just looking at it algebraically, Ok ? 2082083_2085051
0 . 2085051_2085811
and our within groups, say we had xxx two . 2085811_2090203
well, if you, well let me xxx . 2090203_2093710
well, five divided by three is going to be less than five divided
right . 2098513_2098850
ok ? 2098850_2099561
I mean, it's going to be greater, excuse me, than five divided by
by the same token certainly, ten fifteenths or something is less
as the top part gets bigger, then your ratio gets bigger . 2114051_2118865
as the bottom part gets smaller, your ration gets bigger . 2118865_2123721
ok . 2123721_2124113
so, in other words, uh, the difference between, uh, you know, in
right ? 2141993_2142383
right . 2142383_2142951
ok . 2142951_2143463
well, if the difference between the means is so large that the
then, that's when we're glad to reject the null . 2156503_2159583
and so that, if I'm interested, let's say our, our, our mean here,
uh huh . 2173688_2174038
sure this is a little bit greater . 2174038_2175695
0 . 2175695_2176215
right . 2176215_2176575
but that could just be due to random error . 2176575_2178190
0 . 2178190_2178678
right . 2178678_2179381
but, if say, these people did, like, fifty and these people were
bigger and bigger . 2188198_2189438
then we're going to be “hey, you know, that looks a lot less like
right . 2193286_2193981
than if they were, you know, seventy five and seventy eight . 2193981_2196493
you see ? 2196493_2198156
uh huh . 2198156_2198908
so our probability, our chances, of looking xxx, so when we xxx
I mean, if you look at that, you think, well that is such a big
that doesn't look like it could have occur by chance . 2214955_2218251
uh huh . 2218251_2218651
so when the chances, the probability, that something could have
uh huh . 2228248_2228951
that is xxx reject the null xxx . 2228951_2232033
ok ? 2232311_2238195
0 . 2238195_2239021
so, when our between groups ratio gets bigger, our t_value gets
and so, xxx much more often, in other words, this would be a t of
uh huh . 2255496_2256056
xxx . 2256056_2256481
if your obtained value equal or exceeds that tabled value . 2256481_2261218
then if it did so you're saying, it's not just by chance that this
xxx reject the null . 2267786_2271301
right . 2271301_2271686
ok . 2271686_2272526
ok . 2272526_2275101
and the same thing happens if your within groups get smaller or
0 . 2283750_2284166
now, the f_value ok, the f_value, do you want me to
xxx, but I would be glad to explain the f_value to you . 2289941_2295948
um, xxx finish up . 2295948_2300758
xxx . 2300758_2301325
no . 2301325_2301918
0 finish up . 2301918_2303781
oh . 2303781_2304093
finish up . 2304093_2304511
ok . 2304511_2304871
sure . 2304871_2305208
if you've got time . 2305208_2306031
no, that's fine . 2306031_2307280
I mean, I've got time . 2307280_2309903
ok . 2309903_2311175
xxx . 2311175_2313870
ok . 2313870_2314191
we'll run through the f_value real fast and xxx . 2314191_2318670
0 xxx t@l was the ratio of our
oh . 2327790_2328693
between groups . 2328693_2331781
between and within . 2331781_2333758
ok . 2333758_2336030
that applies when you have two groups . 2336030_2339045
ok, the mean of one group that had five hours of study and the mean
well, that if we had a group of xxx fifteen hours of study . 2346990_2353246
xxx . 2353246_2353876
the f_test . 2353876_2356445
the f_test is for two or more . 2356445_2358125
xxx, ok ? 2358125_2360396
xxx on top . 2360396_2363531
this is equivalent to xxx between groups . 2363531_2371796
0 . 2371796_2372818
xxx . 2372818_2378508
they call it error variance I think . 2378508_2380706
0 xxx . 2380706_2391948
ok . 2391948_2392418
xxx . 2392418_2408518
x one . 2408518_2411980
and X two . 2411980_2413413
and X two . 2413413_2413811
ok . 2413811_2414323
now we have xxx for three . 2414323_2416370
so what is our systematic or between groups variance going to look
xxx . 2419986_2421858
yeah . 2421858_2423323
varialbity between all of them ok . 2423323_2426075
so in order to look at the variability in two or more groups, the
xxx grand mean, the mean of all the subjects . 2435170_2443273
ok ? 2443273_2443953
0 . 2443953_2444601
alright . 2444601_2445410
and our between groups we're interested in how much this one
it's the same thing . 2460410_2460840
it's how much each, each group varies from all the groups . 2460840_2467423
0 . 2467423_2467800
ok ? 2467800_2468431
in other words, it's the same thing . 2468431_2470911
but before we only had two groups, now we have three . 2470911_2473623
xxx . 2473623_2479295
alright . 2479295_2479638
within groups you can put . 2479638_2482383
the error, the number, the difference xxx that's within a single
in other words, what are you referring to ? 2491381_2493214
all the people that study five hours . 2493214_2495301
five hours . 2495301_2495750
might have been different from what ? 2495750_2497525
from the mean xxx . 2497525_2498790
ok . 2498790_2499261
in other words, how much one person who studied five hours differs
five hours . 2504341_2505821
and for the ten and for the fifteen . 2505821_2507668
ok . 2507668_2508036
so the f_test works on the same logic . 2508036_2510036
xxx, get your critical values, xxx, you get your observed value and
you have to do one more thing for both of them, and that is degrees
0 . 2523436_2524181
oh . 2524181_2524765
alright . 2524765_2525731
do you remember what those are ? 2525731_2526485
that's the, um definitionally it's the error, the number xxx . 2526485_2535371
you have six occurrences and you have five degrees of freedom . 2535371_2542140
xxx that one occurrence xxx . 2542140_2545020
&=laughs ok . 2545020_2545371
&=laughs is that ? 2545371_2546643
the example, I think you, the one in the book on page one hundred
ok . 2550645_2551083
the degrees of freedom, ok . 2551083_2555401
the degrees of freedom of the number of scores for each of xxx
xxx the means are know, Ok ? 2561378_2565730
so, it's how many scores can vary once you know something about
how it's, for the example . 2572873_2574455
if the mean of the group is six, and there are five subjects in the
so your mean is six Ok ? 2581630_2586838
and you have five subjects, Ok . 2586838_2589221
um, xxx you're getting tutored, it's gonna be on the tape . 2589221_2595885
do you have a calculator ? 2595885_2596750
I meant to bring one . 2596750_2597838
0 . 2597838_2599046
we can look at this mathematically, as well as logically . 2599046_2603341
ok . 2603341_2604245
we have five subjects in a group . 2604245_2606550
n@l equals five . 2606550_2608278
ok ? 2608278_2608733
ok . 2608733_2609501
alright . 2609501_2609948
and there, say you have four scores . 2609948_2611990
xxx logically . 2611990_2615580
well, if we have four scores and we know that x@l one equals four,
whatever x@l five is going to be has, Ok, these four values could
ok ? 2648783_2650080
but once we know these four, x@l five has to be fixed . 2650080_2654288
because it has to be whatever will add into all the rest of these
0 Oh . 2660440_2661080
ok . 2661080_2664736
xxx . 2664736_2665383
in other words, we know that the mean is six already, we know that
once we know any three, two of them could still be anything . 2670623_2674238
but once you know four, there's only one left and it has to be
ok ? 2682271_2683183
so that's you're degrees of freedom . 2683183_2685246
ok ? 2685246_2685711
calculator xxx . 2685711_2687171
0 . 2687171_2688173
ok . 2688173_2688836
so it's how many scores xxx . 2688836_2694260
ok . 2694260_2694741
got that ? 2694741_2695315
alright So we were looking at the f_test xxx . 2695315_2710830
uh huh . 2710830_2711613
xxx . 2711613_2715036
um, so just kind of looking at it in general, these tests . 2715036_2721396
our goal is to determine if our obtained results are reliable
xxx what's used before hand, how confident we can be with our
we are more likely to obtain significant results in our t@l or our
0 . 2746026_2746755
xxx . 2746755_2747986
so that's where the xxx . 2747986_2753041
but, xxx . 2753041_2755866
ok, do you have any other questions that you wan to ask about this ?
um, I have one . 2763353_2766388
ok . 2766388_2767613
um, if the obtained value of t@l is larger than the critical value,
right . 2774111_2776103
that's what you do . 2776103_2777015
the obtained value needs to be equal to or greater than the
right . 2783230_2784318
so you choose which value to look at by looking at what . 2784318_2786988
what was the question ? 2786988_2790916
when your looking up the t_table, the critical values of t@l are on
how do we know which value to look at ? 2807523_2809923
by looking at our . 2809923_2811233
over there in the left column . 2811233_2813601
oh . 2813601_2814041
degrees of freedom . 2814041_2814660
right . 2814660_2815058
in other words, you'd have to look at that and go xxx . 2815058_2819298
you have to choose your significant level, which you do beforehand
uh huh . 2826090_2826850
xxx, degree of freedom . 2826850_2829601
ok . 2829601_2830883
xxx critical value xxx . 2830883_2843146
your critical value is just a xxx . 2843146_2850016
type one and type two errors . 2850016_2853273
ok . 2853273_2853848
the best way is to look at it, I like the way the book xxx . 2853848_2858928
it's a good way xxx . 2858928_2860895
xxx . 2860895_2883208
our null hypothesis . 2883208_2894270
and our alternate hypothesis . 2894270_2911366
what are, in terms of the null, what are the two types decisions we
accept it or reject it . 2917108_2922293
sure . 2922293_2922585
in terms of our population, we can xxx, and they are what ? 2922585_2948690
um, xxx . 2948690_2952991
right . 2952991_2953416
either the null is true; or the null is not going to be true . 2953416_2959701
xxx it's all probabilistic xxx . 2959701_2970730
alright . 2970730_2973688
in, ah, our null hypothesis is that changing the hours you study
alright ? 2984015_2984423
0 . 2984423_2984463
ok . 2984463_2985695
if we do our experiment, analyze our results, and because of our
we get a really big difference between our hours of study . 2996511_3001055
say, we had xxx . 3001055_3002738
say that the ten, five hour people got a mean of fifty five, the
well, statistically we find that that is a significant difference
you know, that our independent variable does have an effect, so we
however, what if in some theoretical sense that this was just
that these results occurred by chance, and not really due the
we've rejected the null, but the null is actually true . 3036378_3039136
that would be a . 3039136_3041305
what type of error ? 3041305_3043471
which one ? 3043471_3044376
type I . 3044376_3045680
ok . 3045680_3046186
ok . 3046186_3051411
however, if we had, in that case, when we talked about the null
it could have been xxx . 3065123_3066656
xxx rejected the null with xxx . 3066656_3069313
well, what if we had gotten that and, and because of our sample
0 . 3080138_3081456
we failed to reject the null and the null was, indeed true . 3081456_3088808
what have we then ? 3088808_3089215
xxx . 3089215_3090800
no . 3090800_3092000
if the null is true and we don't reject it . 3092000_3095135
oh, Ok . 3095135_3095560
accept it . 3095560_3096471
in other words, we . 3096471_3098136
sure . 3098136_3098503
we've made a correct decision . 3098503_3099175
right . 3099175_3099583
xxx . 3099583_3102526
no, you're not . 3102526_3103495
ok . 3103495_3104431
in other words, let's say, let's jus hypothetically say, we got a
right . 3111823_3112526
and due to the statistical analysis we found that that is not a
in fact, in our population, we have some way of knowing that t
ok, what if we reject the null, in other words, we xxx difference,
xxx correct decision . 3150390_3155700
another correct decision . 3155700_3158988
in other words, we've rejected the null and our hypothesis is true .
i@l e@l our independent variable has an effect . 3164613_3167220
however, if we don't reject the null, we fail to reject the null,
xxx . 3179828_3181443
ok . 3181443_3183178
and in terms of this example, what does that mean ? 3183178_3185881
what is happening ? 3185881_3188746
that there is, um, there is a difference between the amount of
perfect . 3205690_3206210
right . 3206210_3207128
xxx there was no difference xxx . 3207128_3211081
that's a type two error . 3211081_3213448
ok . 3213448_3214525
the Type I error can be specified exactly . 3214525_3221245
xxx the chances xxx . 3221245_3227860
xxx probability ? 3227860_3229041
right . 3229041_3229410
by an alpha level . 3229410_3233500
xxx our chances xxx type of error . 3233500_3237715
in other words, xxx point o@l five we have a five percent chance of
alright ? 3242851_3243923
0 . 3243923_3245161
but you can't specify a type two precisely because it's specified
in other words, xxx one error decreases it's going to harder and
xxx type two error . 3261656_3264838
xxx . 3264838_3267050
right . 3267050_3267366
they increased . 3267366_3268158
and logically you can see that because what you do with it when
you make it harder and harder to reject the null . 3275358_3277190
0 . 3277190_3277846
well, obviously, if you've making it harder and harder to reject
in other words, giving you a much greater chance that you won't
0 . 3290250_3290544
in other words, you see some difference but it's not great enough
type one chances increase type two chances decrease . 3300003_3303515
um, what, Ok, let's just do some, look at some more examples . 3303515_3316475
ok ? 3316475_3316930
what if I study the effects of sleep deprivation on teaching
one group of teachers has had twenty four hours of sleep
0 analyzed my results and based on these
however, in reality the amount of deprivation xxx doesn't cause a
what type of error is that ? 3346048_3348456
um you've rejected the, um, H one . 3348456_3358096
right . 3358096_3358648
xxx . 3358648_3363466
no . 3363466_3363875
look . 3363875_3364378
that failure to xxx rejected the null, but in reality . 3364378_3370450
oh . 3370450_3370786
degrees of freedom . 3370786_3372521
xxx draw a matrix and you can't go wrong . 3372521_3381010
draw a matrix . 3381010_3381490
ok . 3381490_3381851
I said there was a difference, xxx H one was true, but the null was
so I've rejected the null, and the null was actually true . 3392708_3396598
in other words, H one is true xxx rejecting xxx . 3396598_3406196
xxx . 3406196_3414185
0 . 3414185_3416070
in other words, what I did was to set the alpha high for this xxx
ok . 3421846_3426081
if I, well, let's xxx, let's just consider more serious xxx which
type one or type two ? 3441595_3442601
type one . 3442601_3446185
ok . 3446185_3447073
why ? 3447073_3447568
xxx xxx if you make a type one error, then you're saying that
0 . 3486273_3487880
right . 3487880_3488240
in other words, xxx does something xxx . 3488240_3492255
xxx . 3492255_3492710
and a type one error is xxx something didn't have an effect when it
0 Uh huh . 3501221_3502255
xxx that would be less serious because we could just run another
0 . 3512865_3513636
and, and xxx, well, the same thing could be true if you made a type
0 . 3527813_3528430
you know, 'cuz you could say xxx type two error . 3528430_3534756
xxx . 3534756_3538411
xxx well gosh my study didn't show it but xxx run another study,
0 . 3550796_3551540
in a xxx study xxx method xxx consistered less serious . 3551540_3558985
um, the book example on page one hundred and forty six and forty
0 . 3567465_3567985
it would be much xxx for him to make a type two error, in other

&=laughs they'd both be serious, but xxx might die xxx if you did
xxx . 3591703_3598015
uh huh . 3598015_3598350
xxx class xxx type one or type two errors . 3598350_3602945
well, don't worry about it, I mean, provided that you remember to
you know, H@l one's true, H@l o@l is true, H@l one is true, xxx
xxx the null or xxx . 3613270_3618831
0 Ok . 3618831_3619216
you know, it's like, as long as you remember, memorize how to set

alright . 3626336_3626743
ok . 3626743_3627601
u, the whole reason why the type two error is xxx also xxx
they're kind of problem, they're problematic because you're looking
but, that's xxx not necessarily xxx to find a relationship . 3655648_3665198
0 . 3665198_3666600
you can find one . 3666600_3667150

um .
xxx another question ?
xxx .
no .
ok .
appreciate it .
oh, no problem .
it's what I'm here for
