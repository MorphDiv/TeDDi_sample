all right . 705_985
so we are running out of time . 1185_3425
so what we're going to do, we'll go through the guided questions together, okay ? 6045_11105
and then we're going to review and discuss our documents a bit . 11225_16105
all right ? 16245_16425
so, let's look at number one for document B, who is Elias Boudinot and what do you predict he will say about Indian removal ? 16605_23045
S_one ?
he's Cherokee and they have to force the removal and segregation of xxx . 28045_33925
okay, good . 34685_36365
so we know that he's a Cherokee . 36945_38085
the source says the letter above was written in eighteen-thirty-seven by Elias Boudinot, a Cherokee that supported Indian removal and who signed the treaty of New Echota that gave away Cherokee land . 38185_48065
the letter's to Chief John Ross, leader of the Cherokees, who opposed Indian removal . 48585_52605
okay, so we know that he was a Cherokee, he supported Indian removal and he's writing a letter to Chief John Ross, who's a leader of the Cherokee . 53075_63755
okay ?
Chief John Ross opposes Indian removal . 64835_67295
so S_one is definitely on the right track . 67575_69435
okay, I would agree . 70115_70875
how many people would agree that he is probably going to write something trying to persuade Chief John Ross to change his mind ? 71255_77835
okay, good . 78695_79715
all right . 80075_80395
let's look at number two . 80405_81425
what was life like for the Cherokee in Georgia according to Boudinot ? 81645_86005
what was life like for the Cherokees ? 86125_87705
S_two ?
they had to obey American laws and couldn't do what they wanted to do . 89505_94965
okay, they had to obey American laws . 94965_96785
couldn't do what they wanted to do . 97005_98265
S_three ?
it says instead of fix the evil, you would tie our people down in the chains of slavery . 98765_104685
okay, good . 105545_106385
you would tie our people down to the chains of slavery . 106405_108905
okay, how would that connect with the quote that S_two just gave us ? 110205_114405
maybe it was like unfair . 115285_118465
I never really figured out that much . 120065_121365
okay, can you repeat the quote you gave ? 121445_123565
they had to obey American laws and couldn't do what they wanted to do . 125045_131005
okay, they had to obey American laws and couldn't do what they wanted to do . 131325_135305
maybe because they had to be slaves no matter what they thought ? 136705_141565
and the Americans made them do it anyways . 142005_146005
okay . 147045_147265
S_four ?
I would think they feel a little restrained physically and emotionally because they said that they had to give up their religion to Christianity like Americans . 147645_157245
okay, good . 157665_158305
so they're feeling restrained and they can't live life how they normally would . 158355_164555
okay, all right . 167415_168335
what else does he say about life in Georgia ? 169855_172455
how are the people, how are the Cherokee in Georgia ? 173295_181655
S_five ?
miserable . 182915_183655
miserable . 184795_185055
can you give me your quote ? 185315_186055
look at our people, they are wretched . 188395_191215
they are wretched . 192035_192695
good .
look at our people, they are miserable . 193275_195095
okay . 196035_196215
so that's the first thing he starts out saying to Chief John Ross, our people are miserable . 196335_201595
they're not, okay, they're not good . 201935_205075
life is not great, okay ? 205275_207075
they have to follow American laws . 207135_210275
they don't get to live life how they normally would . 210475_215675
what does he say about the laws of Georgia ? 218355_220095
go ahead . 221355_223555
go ahead . 223835_223995
yeah . 223995_225735
I haven't heard from S_six in a while, so go ahead . 226095_228355
he says that the laws are unfair and that they don't really get the rights that they're supposed to . 230335_236175
okay, good . 236415_237075
right in the third paragraph, okay ? 237415_240895
you want the Cherokee to live according to the laws of Georgia no matter how unfair they are . 240955_246355
okay ? 247755_248175
all right . 248255_248855
what does Boudinot hope will happen if the Cherokees move west ? 249115_252315
okay, if the Cherokees move west, what is he hoping the outcome will be ? 253095_258055
S_five ?
that if they do they won't have to obey the laws of Americans anymore . 258175_266915
right, they won't have to obey the laws of the United States . 267135_271735
okay . 272295_272315
they'll be able to live freely . 272355_274195
good .
okay . 275455_275675
so why did Jackson and Boudinot think Indian removal was in the best interest of the Cherokee ? 275645_280665
let's go back to Jackson . 280845_281925
okay .
why did he think that Indian removal was the best policy ? 282845_286905
S_six ?
because the Indians were like savages, they weren't civilized and they didn't really belong . 287425_295465
okay . 295825_296405
they weren't civilized, they didn't really belong . 296505_298125
so maybe the best thing would be to move them west so that they could live how they're used to living . 299345_304805
okay .
S_eleven .
I think Andrew Jackson didn't think it was a clean and healthy environment, because he says in the same sentence where he says that they're savages, he also says what good man would prefer a country covered with forests occupied by a few thousand savages ? 307845_328925
okay . 329825_330145
so it wasn't the best environment for them . 330725_333585
it's not what they're used to . 333725_334765
so, it would be in their best interest to move west . 336025_338945
good . 339405_339425
all right . 339945_340145
what about Boudinot ? 340645_342045
what did he think about, why was Indian removal the best policy ? 342105_345805
S_seven ?
because they could live by their own laws . 348045_350705
they could live by their own laws . 351065_352665
okay . 353105_353425
good . 353965_354905
anyone else have anything different ? 355485_356905
do we agree ? 357005_357465
yes . 358085_359565
I see a lot of nods . 359665_360385
okay, all right . 360485_361505
do you believe them ? 361765_362885
do you believe Jackson ? 363465_364365
do you think his motives are pure ? 364425_367325
he's sincere, he's believable ? 367505_369185
they're actually going to take care of the Indians the way that he is saying they will ? 370305_376185
no . 376485_376805
okay, how many people say yes ? 378045_379745
how many people say yes ? 379765_381865
raise your hand ! 382345_383265
all right . 383965_384445
how many people say no, you don't trust him, you don't trust what he says ? 384625_387945
because he never did it . 388165_389485
all right, okay . 391425_392085
how many people say I don't know ? 392685_394325
a couple . 395205_397765
all right, okay . 398805_399985
so for those that say, okay, he's not believable, why ? 400285_405465
S_four ?
I saw your hand first . 405645_406705
go ahead . 406805_407045
it says in the Andrew Jackson thing however we must accept them the way we accept an older generation . 407985_415805
so he's kind of saying like caring about the Indians kind of died off with the other generations before him, so he seems like he doesn't care in that sentence . 415945_425965
okay . 426605_426785
S_three, what do you think ? 427605_428005
do you agree ? 428065_428425
I agree, but I'm not sourcing it, I don't have a quote, but I'm just thinking that if he didn't want to live with them in the first place, then he's not going to want them to live at all . 428665_442125
probably, he just doesn't want them to get in his way anymore . 443765_446585
well they didn't . 446705_447225
okay . 447345_447645
okay .
is there anything in the document that would show that ? 448865_456185
okay . 457165_458085
I'll come back to you . 458205_458765
S_eight ?
what do you think ? 458825_460845
I think when it compares them to generations, I think it's kind of saying that was the older generation and now it's time for them to die off so us, the new people of the land, can come and take over . 462355_473335
okay .
all right . 475255_476575
anything else ? 477115_478275
S_three ?
like S_four said, we must make room for the younger, so they're just going to let them go away and not deal with them anymore and they're just going to preserve the life for the new people . 478315_490195
okay . 490795_491015
okay . 491475_491735
let's look at what he says in document A . 491975_498395
all right . 498535_503895
okay . 505395_507495
so look at the, what is it ? 507595_509535
the third and fourth paragraph ? 509675_510735
nope . 511275_511475
all the way at the bottom . 511715_512515
last two paragraphs, okay ? 512595_514615
let's read it . 514915_517455
can it be cruel when this government offers to purchase the Indians' land, give him new and extensive territory, pay the expense of his removal and support him for the first year in his new home ? 517465_526845
how many thousands of our own people would gladly embrace the opportunity of moving west under such conditions ? 527065_533085
the policy of the government towards the red man is generous . 533705_536345
the Indian is unwilling to follow the laws of the States and mingle with the population . 537065_540825
to save him from utter annihilation, the government kindly offers him a new home and proposes to pay the whole expense of his removal and settlement . 540945_549965
that seems like a pretty sweet deal, you want to pay me to move and support me for the first year ? 550185_556305
it's kind of sounds a little sarcastic, but then again, it's kind of like, why would you offer me this if you could just give it to your own people and leave us alone ? 557225_566325
because in that sentence where he says how many of our people would love to have that given to them ? 567005_573985
it's kind of like, well just give it to them and we can still be safe in our land and just give it to them then . 574145_579265
okay . 580065_580285
so you think he's sounding sarcastic ? 580545_582185
okay . 582825_583025
things like that would cost a lot of money to do for all the Indians . 584425_588225
okay, it would cost a lot of money . 588685_590345
okay . 590765_590965
let's look at Boudinot . 591085_593205
do you believe what he's saying ? 594585_595965
do you think he's sincere in his letter ? 596585_599745
not really . 600205_600845
okay . 601265_602025
how many people say yes ? 602445_603785
all right . 604145_606665
how many people say no ? 606785_607685
all right . 608585_609305
for those of you that, who said yes ? 609485_611005
raise your hand . 611145_611605
all right . 612505_612705
S_eight, why do you say yes ? 612845_614045
why do you believe him ? 614085_614905
I believe him because he was, he is one of the Cherokee Indians and so I think he would understand more . 615485_622885
and also it's like him that's also having this trouble, and so he knows kind of what it's like and he is seeing all the advantages . 623665_632285
okay . 632945_633265
so he's talking about he's one of, he's one of them . 633545_638105
okay . 638665_638805
so in your mind, because he is a Cherokee himself, okay ? 638945_642905
he would have the best interests in mind for his people . 642865_646445
okay .
good .
for those that said no, why do you say no ? 647665_649545
who doesn't believe him ? 650065_652785
everyone suddenly believes him ? 654085_656885
I don't know . 657665_658445
how many people say I don't know ? 658965_660525
okay, S_nine, why would you question what he says ? 660785_665385
we're leaving . 665885_668325
I know, sit down . 668805_669725
he's kind of like on and off about this, he says that he wants them to leave, but he also wants to give them special treatment somewhere else . 677235_689055
so it's kind of like you don't really know if you should believe him . 689175_694035
okay . 694375_694795
so maybe it sounds like he kind of flip-flops a little bit ? 694995_697715
okay . 698255_698555
all right . 698795_699075
keep these in your binders . 699155_700655
we'll talk a little bit more about this tomorrow . 700735_702975
all right . 705305_705565
have a good night . 705645_706245
make sure your study guide is done for tomorrow . 706465_708065
please . 708285_708425
