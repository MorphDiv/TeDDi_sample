okay, um, we're doing revision from yesterday on the congruent triangle so do you remember what a &~con what a pair of &~tria congruent triangles are ? 0_9651
yep . 9651_10900
yeah . 10900_11355
two triangles that are the same . 11355_13378
same what ? 13378_14196
same angles same sides . 14196_17458
same angles and same sides so we're doing ten quick questions on this . 17458_21090
so all right, there's two right angle triangles . 21090_28306
all right, and they're supposed to be the same . 28306_31541
supposed to look the same . 31541_32898
all right, this one is a@l b@l c@l, and this one is d@l e@l and f@l . 32898_43715
all right, they are congruent . 43715_45481
so I'm going to ask you ask you ten quick questions on that . 45481_48560
all right, number one, which angle is equal to angle a@l ? 48560_55143
which angle is equal to angle d@l ? 55143_75481
number three, if angle a@l is thirty +... 75481_83471
and angle d@l is sixty +... 83471_86406
uh, what size is angle e@l ? 86406_96013
and number four, what size is angle d@l ? 96013_110390
which line is equal to b@l c@l ? 110390_113966
I'm sorry ? 113966_116956
which line is equal to b@l c@l ? 116956_123916
number six, which line is equal to e@l f@l ? 123916_131156
and +... 131156_137538
okay, if a@l c@l, if a@l b@l is five, all right, and b@l c@l is three, and a@l c@l is four centimeters, all right, how long is d@l f@l ? 137538_163365
number eight, how long is e@l f@l ? 163365_171336
number nine, the triangles a@l b@l c@l and f@l e@l d@l are congruent . 171336_177841
write that using the symbol . 177841_184465
do you want me to repeat it ? 184465_185618
yeah . 185618_185936
triangle a@l b@l c@l and triangle f@l e@l d@l . 185936_193481
and number ten, which is the hypotenuse of triangle a@l b@l c@l ? 193481_199846
the hypotenuse . 199846_205438
okay, who wants to answer them ? 205438_207176
okay . 207176_209145
number one angle f@l . 209145_211030
yep . 211030_211398
number two angle c@l . 211398_213311
yes . 213311_213806
number three sixty degrees . 213806_215190
yes . 215190_215728
number four ninety degrees . 215728_216936
yes . 216936_217391
number five a@l d@l . 217391_218775
yep . 218775_219263
number six a@l b@l . 219263_220285
yes . 220285_220783
number seven four centimeters . 220783_222358
yes . 222358_222823
number eight five centimeters . 222823_224246
yes . 224246_225038
number nine triangle a@l b@l c@l is congruent to three lines . 225038_230231
three lines . 230231_230998
to triangle d@l e@l f@l . 230998_233135
she hasn't got it right . 233135_234640
oh f@l e@l d@l . 234640_235798
triangle to triangle what ? 235798_239508
f e@l d@l . 239508_240348
d@l e@l f@l . 240348_241606
you said f@l e@l d@l . 241606_243076
why did I say f@l e@l d@l ? 243076_245348
because that tells xxx the same . 245348_250293
what's the same ? 250293_252051
like f@l equals a@l . 252051_253460
xxx . 253460_254350
so f@l equals a@l and what's equal to c@l ? 254350_260061
d@l . 260061_260579
d@l, and b@l equals e@l . 260579_262155
so you've really got to write these in the same order . 262155_264293
oh . 264293_264910
all right ? 264910_266180
and ten is a@l b@l . 266180_267108
why ? 267108_267553
ten is a@l b@l . 267553_269361
just to show the congruence to show the relationship between them . 269361_272348
I'm doing them in alphabetical order . 272348_273563
I know . 273563_273973
and I didn't say it that way did I ? 273973_276768
who got them all right ? 276768_278591
that's pretty good . 278591_279886
who got nine right ? 279886_281160
yeah I did . 281160_281613
yeah, right . 281613_283248
number ten was a@l b@l . 283248_284718
nine . 284718_285758
all right, okay, I've got a worksheet for you to do and you've got to work in groups of three or four . 285758_297268
so that'll be that group . 297268_300118
so if you two Angela and Laura, if you can come down the front and work with the front two . 300118_304478
just bring your chairs down, don't worry about +... 304478_311321
what do I need ? 311321_314320
what do you need ? 314320_315601
you need your protractors . 315601_317066
you can bring a desk down if you want a little bit more room to work on or you might just move your pencils . 317066_321568
just turn around till I finish talking to you, all right ? 321568_341583
so you've got five here . 341583_345928
yeah, one, two . 345928_347440
oh that'll do . 347440_348126
that'll be all right . 348126_350621
can you talk together ? 350621_352430
where did you want us to move ? 352430_353783
um, yes . 353783_356238
yeah, one of you move down there one so you've got a group of three and one of you can <move> work with one of these . 356238_362590
all right Angela, you can work with um Eun and all right ? 362590_370011
then you've got just one down there . 370011_371808
here's a all right ? 371808_377931
how am I going to work ? 377931_378861
bring a chair . 378861_379870
yeah, you can bring that yeah, bring the table over . 379870_384875
xxx . 384875_387515
no . 387515_387940
all right, I'll go through the instructions with you . 387940_398643
I'll read through the instructions and girls, read through the instructions as I go through it . 398643_417220
what you're doing is you're actually finding the rules for a pair of congruent triangles and you're trying to find the minimum rules . 417220_425353
so the task you need to produce a list of instructions so that anyone following them will construct exactly the same triangle . 425353_431656
oh . 431656_432576
it's got a list of what you need . 432576_434608
and the first part, steps one and two, each person in the group on the piece of paper on the back here it says your triangle . 434608_442855
you construct a triangle on that page without showing the rest of your group and you write down the steps of how you did it . 442855_449850
all right ? 449850_452391
then, after everybody's done that in your group, um, you take turns to read your instructions out to the group and they can use the pink, um, the paper at the back . 452391_464053
I've done a variety of colors . 464053_467160
you should be able to fit three on one page but I've given you an extra page as well in case you can't . 467160_471208
so you will be drawing three triangles or two . 471208_475181
if there's two in the group you'll be if there's three in the group you'll be drawing the other two triangles . 475181_479111
if there's four in the group you'll be drawing three . 479111_481533
so one person say Laura here will read out her instructions and the other two will actually follow her instructions, all right ? 481533_490495
if you then when she's finished you have a look at it and see if they're exactly the same . 490495_495053
if they're not you can go back and change your instructions so that they actually work . 495053_499668
all right ? 499668_501268
and then each other person in the group does that . 501268_504843
so each person takes a turn to read out their instructions to the others in the group and they follow it . 504843_509926
you're not to actually look at what they did . 509926_512245
you actually have to follow the instructions . 512245_515453
do you make up instructions xxx ? 515453_518116
no, you make up your own instructions, it depends on what you're drawing . 518116_520586
all right, you make up your own triangle . 520586_522891
and what you're going to end up with is a minimum set of instructions so that the least number of steps that you need to draw your triangle . 522891_531195
now there's four different ways of doing it . 531195_535740
so if there's three or four of you, you might end up with totally different ways . 535740_539841
so you've got to decide what how what you need for the minimum number of steps for your triangle, all right ? 539841_546656
is it going to be all sides, is it going to be all angles, what is it going to be ? 546656_550866
is it going to be all six ? 550866_553355
do you need all six angles and all six sides ? 553355_555951
