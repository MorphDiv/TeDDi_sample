tuesday tuesday night <&~li> Lisa and Raymond
I don't remember how the first part started .
what happened to the boy and the girl in the story ?
they went to Mcdonalds .
mhm .
and they ordered stuff .
but their mama left her purse on the kitchen counter .
and <I think> they went home .
<one afternoon no> one morning when mike got up <he fixt>
but he spilt the milk .
can I start over ?
mhm .
one morning as mike woked up he went downstairs
he spilt the milk because he was having a bad day .
when he tries to go to school he missed the bus .
his shoes were untied .
and he fell .
when he finally reached school he was late .
and (6.) &-uh he just went to class .
this story is called The_Alien_Family .
one afternoon Michael and Lisa were running through the park .
they saw a big spaceship .
<they didn't> they couldn't believe their eyes .
but <when people got out> when the people got out Michael and
they said that it was aliens .
they couldn't believe it .
so they ran back home to get their mom and dad .
and the family went through the park to find the aliens .
the aliens spoke .
but Michael and Lisa didn't know what they were saying .
so they just made friends and lived happily ever after
