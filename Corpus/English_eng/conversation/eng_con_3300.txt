all right, let me show you something from yesterday . 3280_17030
given enough time, and enough . 17030_28240
depth, what's gonna happen to the sediments ?
what's gonna happen, there yolanda ? 28240_30290
it's gonna become cemented . 30290_33050
that's good . 33050_38110
now if how are you gonna spot, how are you gonna identify sedimentary rock when you see it ? 38110_49270
what's it have ? 49270_54070
you have deposition . 54070_56220
well, you're telling us certainly how it's made . 56220_60240
yeah . 60240_61040
and, you know, that's certainly a good thing, all right ? 61040_69260
but I I just want to come back to this .
yeah . 69260_70010
you know, we know how it's made . 70010_73160
sediments get deposited, buried and cemented together, as yolanda tells us, and it forms sedimentary rock . 73160_83030
but my question is, how are you gonna spot it, how are you gonna identify it when you see it ? 83030_91060
there's a lot of roads that are cut from sedimentary rock, and you can see it if you know what to look for . 91060_100040
what's that, samuel ? 100040_102020
when it certain rocks might have layers on it . 102020_105290
oh . 105290_113030
let's see . 113030_117050
like that ? 117050_118030
yeah . 118030_119000
yeah . 119000_120030
now, how do you know that's sedimentary rock ? 120030_121280
how do you know ? 122110_129250
how do you know ?
how do you know, nikita ?
look at it .
because it's stuck together . 129250_131170
how do you know it's stuck together ? 131170_133240
because it's in layers . 133240_135200
say that . 135200_136140
because it's in layers . 136140_137090
okay . 137090_139280
that's what who said that ?
me . 139280_140200
that's what samuel said . 140200_145160
absolutely .
absolutely .
so, you know, just in a cross+section, looking at it from the side, it appears like that . 145160_154000
all right . 154000_162160
now, how do you why do you suppose you can see the layers here ?
because if this river wasn't here, you wouldn't see the layers .
what did the river do to the rock ? 162160_168110
at least the sedimentary rock ?
what's happening here, corey ?
xxx make stratas . 168110_170270
that's good . 170270_178010
you know, the word that's a good word .
another word for layers are strata .
okay, but what did the river do to the sedimentary rock ? 178010_185280
we did this . 185280_188120
what is that, eric ?
it cuts into it . 188120_189130
that's right . 189130_197090
and in canyons, if the river is cutting through sedimentary rock, you could see the layer . 197090_205020
now, let me ask you this .
suppose and this was our little model from yesterday suppose when the sediments got deposited in in some ancient sea . 205020_219070
sorry . 219070_221060
suppose suppose an animal, the remains of an animal, got deposited in the river along with the sediments . 221060_232080
so now we have an animal, you know, that could have been buried . 232080_245020
a million years ago, ten million years ago, fifty million years ago .
what do you think's gonna happen to that animal ? 245020_252030
rudy, what do you think ? 252030_253040
it's gonna blend into the rocks, with the rest of the sediments . 253040_258020
that's right . 258020_266270
now, there's a word for that .
there's a word for that .
what's that, sonia ? 266270_268230
becomes fossilized . 268230_269270
that's good . 269270_278140
very good .
I'd love to pass it around, but since it's sedimentary rock you can see the layers here I'm afraid that it's gonna fall down and crack . 278140_286250
so i'll just come around . 286250_292000
how do you like that, terrence ?
like it . 292000_293000
huh ? 293000_307120
you did good yesterday, antwone . 307120_314240
all right .
now, let me ask you another question .
suppose we dig down further into the sedimentary rock, into a layer that's underneath it . 314240_323100
is found below it . 337270_339240
what is that ? 339240_340200
well, it's called a brachiopod . 340200_358080
and to us it looks like a clam .
it's a shelled animal .
which would you say is older ? 358080_361280
the one at the bottom . 361280_363170
which would you say is older ? 363170_365280
what would you say, aisha angela ? 368030_371070
I'd say the one xxx . 371070_372000
this one is older ? 372000_373040
no . 374000_375000
the bottom one .
why is the bottom older ? 375000_376010
because it's more down . 376010_378070
that's right . 378070_381180
so I so obviously the the strata or the layers on the bottom are older than the ones on the top . 381180_389290
now, you could use this . 389290_390290
this is how geologists go about figuring out what animal came first and what animal came second and what animal came third . 390290_400250
so it's almost like looking back in a book, where the pages at the bottom contain fossils that are older than the pages on the top . 400250_414140
all right . 414140_426240
now, let me show you something .
let me shut this .
corey, you want to get the lights for a minute ?
don't laugh . 426240_427290
oh . 427290_429270
sonia, I told you not to laugh . 429270_434260
oh .
I love your pants . 434260_440280
loving it .
all right . 440280_443230
any idea where I am ?
any idea ? 444270_447290
well, I don't mean the exact I can tell you the exact location, but the type of landscape I'm on . 452130_459190
ice . 459190_460140
no . 460140_462030
it's not ice, samuel .
sonia ? 465040_466000
is it a mountain ? 466000_467240
it's a kind of mountain . 467240_469200
a cliff ? 469200_470220
I don't know if you can call it a cliff . 470220_473280
it's a rock . 473280_475290
I'm standing on rock . 475290_484170
sonia, got a clue here ? 484170_489230
delia . 489230_492070
I'm sorry .
no . 492070_495190
yolanda ? 495190_496220
maybe you're standing on a rock, and the sediments in the middle are eroding . 496220_502090
no . 502090_511040
that's not how this hole got here .
all right .
rudy ?
a river went in the xxx, and it dried out . 511040_515110
let me tell you where it was, all right ? 515110_522100
hawaii . 522100_525130
does that help ? 525130_527250
the island of hawaii .
oh . 527250_528230
I got it . 529040_530000
there's many islands . 530000_539250
the biggest one is is hawaii .
the one that has the the capital, oahu or honolulu is on the island of oahu .
but there's something about the hawaiian islands . 539250_543100
me . 543100_544090
what is that ? 544090_546030
what was that ?
jeffrey ?
they're all volcanoes . 546030_547110
they're volcanoes . 547110_548130
that's right . 548130_549270
you're on a volcano . 549270_551280
volcano ? 551280_552000
so I'm standing on a vol near the top of a volcano . 552000_564110
why am I not standing on sedimentary rock ? 564110_573170
why do I have to be standing on another kind of rock that we're gonna call non+sedimentary at least for the time being ? 573170_583160
why ?
paola ?
can't hear . 585290_586290
because it was probably hot, the rock or the lava was running or something . 586290_591230
well, you're getting close . 591230_592220
you're getting close . 594140_599130
what is it ?
what do you say, carl ?
because of the xxx going into the hole, it could probably break off . 599130_605240
no . 605240_607290
wait a minute . 607290_621230
they may be pressed into sedimentary rock . 621230_626100
now, I'm not standing on sediments, and I'm not standing on sedimentary rock . 626100_636060
what kind of rock am I standing on ?
mountain . 636060_637000
kyra . 643260_644100
kyra . 644100_645180
kyra . 645180_646020
you're standing on non+sedimentary rock . 646020_647280
yeah, but how is it different than sedimentary rock ? 647280_658030
think the way this rock this rock forms .
how did it form ? 658030_659120
how did it form, terrence ? 660000_664170
how does it form, samuel ?
by heat . 664170_665280
heat . 665280_670180
heat is necessary . 670180_673170
sonia ?
is it metamorphic rock ? 673170_677000
magma . 677000_678290
what comes out of a volcano ? 678290_681070
lava . 681070_682010
okay . 682010_683020
xxx magma . 683020_684090
we can call it lava if it comes to the surface . 684090_688030
some lava never comes to the surface . 688030_695120
we can't call it lava; we have to call it magma .
or magma that never makes it to the surface, stays underground . 701200_710140
now, look at your charts .
what has to happen to magma, or in other words, molten rock that's where the heat comes in in order for it to become solid ? 710140_722040
think about it .
it has to cool . 722040_723160
that's right . 723160_735290
so if magma cools, it becomes solid, much the same way that when water cools it becomes ice .
and what kind of rock is this non+sedimentary rock ? 735290_744090
it doesn't come from sediments .
what is it, terrence ?
it's igneous rock . 744090_746010
very good . 746010_759150
so there's another type of rock .
now, look at this .
let me lower the screen a minute .
so I I went down the slope of the volcano, I walked about four or five miles, and I came to this sign . 759150_782210
so I'm giving away my age . 782210_790020
what does it say there ?
sheba, what does it say ? 791000_794090
I know if you can see it, the rest of us can see it .
September nineteen seventy four lava flow . 794090_797200
okay . 797200_803060
what kind of rock do you think this is ?
igneous . 803060_804290
what kind of rock, antwone ? 804290_806210
magma . 806210_807150
huh ? 807150_808080
magma . 808080_809220
lava .
you're right . 809220_821290
lava is magma, but this long since cooled down .
this isn't hot anymore .
it became solidified .
what kind of rock ?
igneous . 821290_822240
okay . 822240_843010
so let's put that one on the board .
if you had to if you had to describe how igneous rock is formed, how could you say it in one sentence ?
one sentence . 843010_850140
one sentence . 850140_852110
cold lava . 852110_853000
what would you say, terrence ? 853000_864100
one sentence .
I don't know . 864100_867200
it's on the chart right in front of you . 867200_882050
you see it ? 882050_883140
yeah . 883140_884000
all right . 884000_892190
how does igneous rock form ?
how does it form, kyra ? 892190_895230
igneous rock is formed when magma cools . 895230_897290
can't hear . 897290_898290
igneous rock is formed when magma cools, magma . 898290_909280
now, when magma cools, what happens to the state of matter that it's in ? 909280_916100
there's a change in state of matter ?
yeah . 916100_917060
yeah . 917060_918160
so what's the change, rudy ?
solid . 918160_919070
from liquid to solid . 919070_920050
okay . 920050_929220
so it becomes solid so we could say it solidifies .
there you go . 929220_936270
all right .
now, look at this .
what evidence is there that this is igneous rock ? 936270_952210
look at look at the surface .
look at the surface .
look at the surface . 952210_960110
touch it . 960110_961290
how come you don't want to touch it ? 961290_962290
it's not hot anymore . 962290_968200
all right . 968200_976120
anyone see any evidence ?
remember, it was once liquid .
oh, oh, oh, I know . 976120_977280
what do you see there ? 977280_981140
what do you see, terrence ?
it's like the little holes inside of it . 981140_984240
well, you're right . 984240_987160
what do you think the little holes are from ?
bubbles . 987160_989080
bubbles .
what kind of bubbles ? 989080_990270
magma bubbles or lava bubbles . 990270_992280
oxygen . 992280_993200
well, what makes bubbles ? 993200_995200
heat . 995200_996150
air . 996150_997100
liquid . 997100_998050
air . 998050_999010
air . 999010_1001270
some kind of gas .
so when this magma came up through the volcano in hawaii, the magma that it contained had a lot of gas in it . 1001270_1013200
I guess it was something like club soda, has bubbles in it . 1013200_1019270
the holes yeah . 1020240_1029260
the holes became preserved .
all right ?
now, take a look at your chart .
I want to show you something .
right under the rock cycle chart is a scheme for igneous rock identification . 1029260_1040080
now, you see where it says vesicular ? 1040080_1043170
mm+hm . 1043170_1044120
you see ? 1044120_1045990
look where I'm pointing .
yeah . 1045990_1046030
vesicular means gas bubbles . 1046030_1060200
so what I'm holding is vesicular basalt, all right ?
gas bubbles .
you could write it right on your chart .
all right ? 1060200_1065000
now, I want to show you something else .
all right . 1065000_1076050
I'm gonna pass back two igneous rocks .
in a way they're almost the same, and in another way they're different .
it's hot . 1076050_1077020
well, that's because it was near the projector . 1077020_1083030
all right .
I just want you to look at it and then pass it back .
you can touch it, but pass it back, because one of these is a fairly rare rock, and I don't have enough for everybody . 1083030_1092190
pass it . 1092190_1094120
xxx pass it . 1094120_1095000
okay . 1095000_1102240
I'm gonna give one to antwone .
all right . 1102240_1106220
now, take a look at this .
now, i'll tell you up front that you're looking at igneous rock, two different samples . 1106220_1122220
now, if I if it's igneous rock, where did it come from ?
lava . 1122220_1123190
lava . 1123190_1124010
all right . 1124010_1129000
well, yeah .
don't call it mag don't call it lava .
let's call it magma .
magma . 1129000_1130020
okay ? 1130020_1133070
now, let me tell you a little story . 1133070_1142220
here's a cross+section of some part of the crust of the earth . 1142220_1155290
now, what do you think these horizontal layers are ?
bricks . 1155290_1156140
what kind of rock ? 1156140_1157260
bricks . 1157260_1159000
limestone . 1159000_1160000
what kind of rock ? 1160000_1161000
bricks . 1161000_1162000
what kind of rock comes in layers ? 1162000_1164110
sediments . 1164110_1165000
yeah . 1165000_1172270
all right ?
so these are different types of sedimentary rock, the layers .
oldest is on the bottom .
now, what does it say what does it say here, kyra ? 1172270_1179150
if you can see it, everybody can .
magma source . 1179150_1180000
magma source . 1180000_1181040
okay . 1181040_1191280
so at one time this was molten .
what happened to at least some of the magma ?
look .
it went up . 1191280_1192290
well, what happened ? 1192290_1194290
what happened, corey ?
it went up . 1194290_1195190
that's right . 1195190_1207270
and what we say is it intruded into the rock that was already there, so we call this an igneous intrusion .
sort of intruded into the rock that was already there . 1207270_1218280
now, let's follow this intrusion .
where did this intrusion wind up ?
on the surface . 1218280_1219180
ah . 1219180_1227160
okay .
because the magma is very liquidy and loose, so it spreads out . 1227160_1232160
now, why would this magma that came out at the surface cool faster than the magma, let's say, that never made it to the surface ? 1232160_1245290
I mean, there's a lot . 1246130_1254240
I'm just using this as an example .
cools slowly .
why ?
why is that, delia ?
because maybe the air made it cool faster, that's on the surface . 1254240_1257200
that's exactly right . 1257200_1265230
as a matter of fact, some magma cools even quicker .
and the magma comes up and freezes much quicker than it does in the air . 1265230_1276060
but, anyway, how many people have ever made rock candy ?
me . 1276060_1277090
all right . 1277090_1288010
the longer you let that string hang in the water, what about the size of the crystal ?
did you make it that way ?
all right . 1289000_1299000
let me show you something .
magma is a liquid, and in the liquid you have charged atoms .
when they became liquid form when the state of matter changes, they become ions . 1308200_1313290
now, since this is magma and it's a liquid, the atoms can move around . 1313290_1324280
what do you think's gonna be attracted by a positively charged ion ?
heat . 1324280_1325020
heat . 1326000_1327000
huh ? 1327000_1328000
electricity . 1328000_1329000
heat . 1329000_1331190
why ? 1331190_1332060
xxx . 1332060_1333020
right . 1333020_1346210
they'll line up due to electrical charges . 1346210_1364190
given enough time, they arrange themselves very orderly, and you might wind up with something like this .
that's cute . 1364190_1366010
what is it ? 1366010_1367150
a crystal . 1367150_1368010
it's a crystal . 1368010_1369040
it's a cry that's all a crystal is . 1369040_1371260
and the atoms align aligned themselves when the magma was liquid, when it was in a liquid state . 1371260_1379060
so the longer the magma stays liquid, what can you say about the size of the crystal ? 1379060_1385000
it gets bigger . 1385000_1386010
it gets bigger . 1386010_1395270
okay .
but suppose the magma comes out at the surface and cools real quick .
what's gonna happen to the charged atoms ? 1395270_1402280
no . 1402280_1403240
all right . 1403240_1409190
now, remember the rocks I passed back .
there was one that had big crystals, and there was one that had small crystals . 1409190_1418090
who has the rock now ?
all right . 1418090_1428190
do me a favor, shevaun .
hold up the one that you see has big crystals .
okay . 1428190_1431190
and how do you know it has big crystals ?
because it's kind of sparkly xxx . 1431190_1435080
yeah . 1435080_1440270
here it is .
well, here it is .
I put this down on my floor .
marble . 1440270_1441280
granite . 1443000_1444000
that's right . 1444000_1447150
it's granite .
all right ? 1447150_1456240
because it cooled very slowly, so you get large crystals . 1456240_1466180
atoms don't and magma freezes really quickly, atoms don't have time to line up, you get small crystals . 1472200_1482160
okay ? 1482160_1485280
now who else has the rock now ?
okay, antigua, hold up the rock that cooled quickly . 1485280_1492090
hold it up . 1492090_1495260
how do you know that cooled quickly ?
because it doesn't have a lot of crystals . 1495260_1498010
can you see the crystals ? 1498010_1499170
no . 1499170_1500250
can you see little specks in there ? 1500250_1504020
yeah . 1504020_1505080
those may be those tiny crystals, all right ? 1505080_1517260
now, one more thing .
if you're wondering how I'm naming these rocks, it's all on the chart .
first of all, is the rock that you are holding is it light colored or dark colored ? 1517260_1526050
light colored . 1526050_1527000
light colored . 1527000_1540080
okay .
now, notice on your chart it says color: light .
so these rocks over here are all light in color .
now, according to the chart, what the what's the color of these igneous rocks ? 1540080_1546120
dark . 1546120_1547000
yeah . 1547000_1559110
it says “dark” .
or even a rock called the pegmatite . 1559110_1569030
now, look over here where it says grain size .
that's a way of describing the crystal size . 1569030_1578080
you might want to write “crystals” here .
all right ? 1578080_1589260
which of these which of these word which of these correspond to something that has a fine grain or tiny crystals ?
look at the measurements .
okay . 1590160_1602240
less than one millimeter or less than a tenth of a centimeter, light colored .
that rock is rhyolites .
it's granite . 1610290_1611270
that's right . 1611270_1618200
then it's granite .
so it's really very simple .
now, if the rock took a real long time to cool, if it's one centimeter or ten millimeters or larger, then it's called pegmatites . 1618200_1634160
let me see . 1634160_1649080
here's the pegmatite .
look how big those crystals are .
there's one crystal right here .
it's feldspar .
all right ?
so this one took a real long time to cool . 1649080_1664230
the crystals are really big .
we say it has a very big grain size .
okay .
let's wrap this up .
how do you know by looking at an igneous rock, where the rock cooled ? 1664230_1669260
where the magma cooled ? 1669260_1675270
what's the general rule, yolanda ?
maybe because it has a different type of rock in it . 1675270_1679080
look at the rock . 1679080_1688060
how do you know that the magma that formed an igneous rock cooled underground ?
how do you know, rudy ?
probably because of the size of the crystals . 1688060_1689290
okay . 1689290_1696280
so as the magma cools underground rudy, what did you say ?
the size of the crystal . 1696280_1698070
well, tell us about the size . 1698070_1700000
big ? 1701000_1702100
little ?
big . 1702100_1703000
okay . 1703000_1707170
smaller . 1721160_1722270
then what's gonna be the size of the crystal ? 1722270_1728260
what, terrence ?
small . 1728260_1729010
okay . 1729010_1736280
all right . 1736280_1751150
now, listen to this question .
here's another igneous rock .
you see any crystals in here, eric ? 1751150_1753280
no . 1753280_1754250
okay . 1754250_1764160
tiny crystals .
what's the name of this rock ?
look at your chart .
look at your chart .
here . 1764160_1772020
I got one that was transported by a stream .
what's very ti well, it's round .
oh, my gosh . 1772020_1773240
it's really heavy . 1773240_1775250
yeah . 1775250_1777110
what's the name of it, shevaun ? 1777110_1779260
basalt . 1779260_1780070
very good . 1780070_1783260
how did you get basalt ?
since eric said it was tiny in crystal . 1783260_1786220
okay . 1786220_1787090
I looked at less than one millimeter . 1787090_1789290
very good . 1789290_1790190
and I looked at the dark side . 1790190_1791280
ah . 1791280_1807290
xxx dark .
basalt: small, tiny crystals, dark in color, and look here are the minerals that make up the rock .
here are the minerals that make up granite and rhyolite . 1807290_1812210
why do you think granite and rhyolite are light in color ? 1812210_1820050
what does that tell you about the minerals the color of the minerals that make it up ?
what ? 1821250_1822010
it has to be a light color . 1822010_1823030
yeah . 1823030_1831110
and look: quartz, clear to white; feldspar, pink to white .
so the rock is white light colored, because the minerals that make up the rock are light . 1831110_1838060
but on the other hand, different parts of the world have different magmas . 1838060_1846080
it's like soup .
so this soup, or this magma, contained dark ones . 1846080_1856030
here's a dark green .
all right ?
here's a little bit of black .
so now you know how to name the igneous rocks . 1856030_1866260
now, suppose you had an igneous rock that cooled so quickly no crystals had time to form .
what's the name of that rock ? 1866260_1875190
I can't pass this around because it happens to be very, very sharp .
ballistic glass . 1875190_1877280
that's right . 1877280_1884150
it's glass .
with rocks . 1891210_1892020
with rocks . 1893010_1894010
this . 1894010_1904210
and that's how they shaved . 1904210_1908280
was it like that ? 1909080_1910050
no . 1910050_1911020
i mean that's how they shaved, and another thing is, this is this is one of the items that indians used as arrowheads and knives . 1911020_1918020
yeah . 1918020_1919030
all right ? 1919030_1923090
now, here .
how did you know that, shevaun ?
what ? 1923090_1925200
where does it say that ? 1925200_1927030
it's at the top . 1928000_1929270
okay . 1929270_1930070
it's ballistic glass . 1930070_1932220
no crystals . 1932220_1939010
no crystals tells you something about how fast the magma cooled .
it cooled real fast . 1939010_1940010
right . 1940010_1949150
and you get obsidian if it contains these minerals or basaltic glass if it contains the darker ones . 1949150_1961170
all right ? 1961170_1966070
now, I sometimes do this .
or how did the american indians, people that or before they invented discovered metal, how did they flake these ? 1966070_1975040
how do you make a tool out of this ? 1975040_1977080
scrape it against another rock . 1977080_1978210
no . 1978210_1982210
they didn't do that .
they didn't do that . 1982210_1990160
and they made some very fine tools out of this .
I think the egyptians used this as scalpels . 1990160_1998230
they did operations .
so did the indians in south america .
they did operations .
they didn't have knives well, they had knives, but how do you fashion this into a sharp+edged tool ? 1998230_2006240
how, sonia ?
they could take it and they chopped it on the ground or something . 2006240_2015160
take a xxx the same thing . 2015160_2016130
all right . 2016130_2017020
they used their hands and another tool to bang it on . 2023240_2039240
if you hit it just the right way, you get these flakes that are real sharp .
mm+hm . 2039240_2044010
I think one went into my finger . 2044010_2047130
I feel a little splinter .
it's right there . 2047130_2053280
clean as a whistle . 2053280_2065260
it's as sharp as any razor blade .
all right ? 2065260_2070280
how many people saw the movie congo ?
me . 2070280_2071230
okay . 2071230_2077240
I didn't see it .
my son told me about it .
it has to do with diamonds, right ?
yeah . 2077240_2078120
all right . 2078120_2082100
delia, what about the diamonds ?
where were they ?
they were in some cave . 2082100_2084000
how big were the diamonds ? 2084000_2088000
I don't remember . 2088000_2089000
all right . 2089000_2095290
I read an article just two days ago .
they didn't use real diamonds .
glass . 2095290_2096210
it was fake ? 2096210_2097010
they didn't use glass . 2097010_2098270
stones . 2098270_2099060
diamonds ? 2099060_2100000
they used a mineral that you find in granite . 2100000_2108020
it's the clear one .
it's called quartz .
all right ? 2108020_2126080
now, this crystal of quartz, is kind of rare because it's called the twin .
it has a point on both sides .
not like this one that has it's only pointed on one side . 2126080_2136180
now, as far as I know, there's only one place that has these quartz .
it's called her it's found in the city of herkimer, new york, and they call it a herkimer diamond . 2136180_2144070
it's not really a diamond, but it has this shape like a diamond, and that's what they used as diamonds in the movie congo . 2144070_2154290
all right ? 2154290_2163280
now, I told you we talked about cooperstown cooperstown, new york .
remember cooperstown ? 2163280_2168250
remember howe caverns ?
yeah . 2168250_2169000
right, howe caverns ? 2169000_2170000
all right ? 2182290_2189240
right here .
I think it's a little north of albany .
and as soon as you get into the town of herkimer you see signs, “visit the Herkimer diamond mines” and that's where it is . 2198270_2205290
you go to the herkimer diamond mines . 2205290_2211180
they rent you antwone, you looking for it ?
yeah . 2211180_2212080
you see it ? 2212080_2225130
and that's how I found the this herkimer diamond . 2225130_2232240
they're there for you they're there for you to get .
yeah . 2233000_2247270
so it's it's kind of a neat geology neat geology trip to go to howe caverns, go a little further north, and find mine herkimer diamonds .
they're very I don't think they're found anywhere around the earth except in herkimer, new york . 2247270_2255270
all right, now let me ask you here's a tough question . 2255270_2272170
okay . 2272170_2278280
how many people saw et ?
does that look familiar ?
no . 2278280_2279010
that look familiar ? 2279010_2280040
yes . 2280040_2281000
no . 2281000_2282000
this is in yosemite national park . 2282000_2295000
it's called devil's tower .
I believe it's in yosemite .
it's out west .
now, this is solid granite .
how in the world can this piece of granite be above the surface ? 2302290_2317190
what do you think, paola ? 2317190_2322270
all right . 2324200_2338250
this has large crystals .
it cooled slowly, it cooled underground, but yet here it is .
what do you say, eric ? 2338250_2340270
I don't know . 2340270_2341180
what do you say, carl ? 2341180_2342270
huh ? 2342270_2344030
what do you say, corey ? 2344030_2348080
I don't know . 2348080_2349000
kyra ? 2349000_2350010
there is probably more than one layer of it . 2350010_2351100
no . 2351100_2353260
samuel ?
maybe since it's underground, maybe it was pushing up on the surface, and the surface just probably cracked, and it just came up . 2353260_2361020
oh . 2361020_2365030
you mean what are you saying ?
it really did cool underground ?
yeah . 2365030_2366020
all right . 2366020_2376070
so if it cooled underground, that would account for the large crystals .
but you see it now above ground so what do you say, yolanda ? 2376070_2382100
maybe it cracked the ground, and it came and it just kept rising . 2382100_2387230
so you mean something pushed it up ? 2387230_2390190
yeah . 2390190_2391270
okay . 2391270_2396260
that's very good .
almost . 2396260_2399030
it was pushed up, but at one time it was an intrusion, and there was rock around it . 2399030_2412240
and it broke off . 2412240_2414020
what happened to the rock around it ? 2414020_2417290
or what could have happened to the rock around it ? 2417290_2425050
and think back to niagara falls .
carl ? 2425050_2426000
because xxx . 2426000_2429230
water went over it, and it pushed up . 2429230_2432130
it might have been water, what ? 2432130_2434070
the thing that rubbed against it . 2434070_2436080
what wore away ? 2436080_2437140
the rock . 2437140_2438120
the rock . 2438120_2439000
the s why ? 2439000_2440250
because they were soft . 2440250_2441270
very good . 2441270_2445240
it must have been softer .
okay .
that was a good lesson . 2445240_2446230
thank you . 2446230_2446239
yeah .
all right
