okay so ‡ &-um growing up in Georgia you_know let's start with
what was &-um growing up in middle school in Decatur Georgia, or
how was it growing up in middle school ? 106204_107624
yeah ‡ what school you went to ? 107729_108759
&-um I went to Redacted_school middle school . 109058_110848
okay . 110992_111772
&+u &-um &-uh I would say you_know life in there was was cool
&-um I'd say it was more not tailored towards &-uh +//. 117222_121812
I wish education just in schoolwise would've been a little more
we would've learned a_lot_of more . 126906_128566
&-um we <I wouldn't say> I definitely wouldn't say we
&=exhales what is the words ? 137115_137765
we could've been tightened down on a_little more but I think we
&-um a_lot_of real world situations came in at the time, &-um just
&-um but it &+w <it was> you_know <we weren't> it
&-um so ‡ <it was like the> &+a it was like the middle class .
the middle class at that point in time was I'd say was still
&-um now ‡ it's kind_of fading to more either poverty or rich . 168143_172303
&-um I'd say that was probably the last days of the middle class .
so ‡ &-um &+m like I said, it was just kind_of being a middle class
either they went up to the upper class or they went to the lower
mm ‡ that's that's very very interesting (be)cause I be
+" dang ‡ maybe like$co almost ten twenty years ago, things looked
&-um . 200975_201355
yeah ‡ that quick . 202475_203385
correct . 204407_204497
and I didn't know that that's how it was rocking over in
&+m so ‡ was that school kind of &-um fairly new at that time ? 208451_213741
oh ‡ no . 214179_214639
or has that &+al always been around ? 214691_216331
nah ‡ that school was very old . 216414_217674
&-uh that &+sc Redacted_school middle school's been up
wow . 222295_222705
maybe the seventies . 222815_223465
so yeah ‡ that school is very old . 223585_224785
&-um . 224808_225498
mhm . 225591_226031
yeah ‡ definitely was a aged school . 226741_227781
okay ‡ but &-um you left old-ass Redacted_school school to
&-um well ‡ I &+w originally went in to Redacted_school
mhm . 242158_242718
&-um so ‡ when I did go into high school, yes I went to
&-um it was a brand-new facility . 246129_246759
I would say &-um it definitely was a new vibe . 246782_250472
&-uh <we had a> we had a interesting principal when I first
&-um definitely he he kind_of embodied what now I wish that
&-um I do understand you_know he was very tough, very &-uh strict
but now just being a a &+eld not a elderly man, (be)cause
kind_of just tried to get our heads on straight . 280397_282107
&-um we did a_lot_of different things that most schools in Dekalb
&-um it was because_of the fact that I do see now too as_well, &-um
so ‡ he was able to handle a less amount of kids . 294808_298208
he didn't have the typical a thousand, fifteen hundred high school
he maybe only had three to four hundred kids that he could control
&-um and <it kind_of> it started off as good because the
but then you_know <it just kind_of got> that whole thing
wow okay . 327130_328530
see ‡ &-um it's been a while since I personally been back to
so ‡ I &+w I would defer to you &+f as far as knowing you_know
+< mm . 344389_344399
&-um yeah . 344418_345448
<I actually> because I dj as_well, &-um I work actually with
she was a previous coach over there, coach Redacted_name . 349261_350931
&-um I actually dj a_lot_of the &-uh talent shows and &-um I've
so ‡ I do still go up there occasionally . 360668_362338
I haven't been up there maybe in about a year or two now, &-um but
&-um I have friends who have kids who are &-um at Redacted_school
<they didn't> <they don't> but of_course they wasn't
but them telling me the culture of what it is now, it's completely
mm okay . 385827_386107
just to &-um segue away from the school system for a second, &-um
like ‡ where were they born and raised ? 397431_398331
&-uh my mother was born in Cleveland . 398978_400468
my dad was born in Detroit . 400490_403410
&-um both of them met in Cleveland and they moved down to Atlanta .
okay ‡ that's what I'm talking about . 407878_409588
so ‡ they was up in there living the good life up in Cleveland and
ATL . 418923_419503
or or <was the good life> was it that that good of a
(be)cause I know it's it's kind_of different all around . 424397_426927
&-um . 427170_427680
<did you> &+b did you ever ask about that ? 428307_429537
I_mean ‡ I've asked . 429725_430675
my parents are divorced so of_course I can't ask questions that
mhm . 434871_435561
&-um but from what I was told, I_mean Cleveland is just very cold .
&-um it did not have a_lot_of progressing things going on at the
&=laughs mm . 442793_443703
&-um I think they came down in like$co the late eighties, mid
&-um and when they came down, Atlanta_Georgia was jumping . 454188_457648
&-um Freaknik was just bouta get started, you_know <the kind of>
it was nice and hot . 463283_464173
the prices of living was cheaper . 464194_465894
&-um there were more jobs here . 466396_467536
so ‡ that's kind_of really &+w it &+w it what it really
&-um they kind_of get &+n wanted to get away from their family
ah ‡ digging that . 476204_477194
so ‡ &-um you got any plans on what you gonna do with your family
&-um I would definitely say that I'm looking into branching out . 485713_488423
&-um I'm currently a single man so I'm not worried &+a so much
&-um when that situation does come, &-um of_course I don't think I
&-uh definitely the the the the east Atlanta area has definitely
&-um so ‡ I would say raising a childwise I'd definitely go to
but &-um at that moment <I don't have those> &+issu I don't
nah ‡ cool cool cool . 521330_522510
feel the same exact way &=laughs even_though I do got a girl still
<right until> yeah ‡ until other responsibilities are placed
definitely definitely . 530966_532156
what you call it again ? 533582_534872
&-um how_about siblings ? 536397_537197
do you have any ? 537697_538327
&-um I have stepbrothers . 538833_539703

&-um it's it's alright . 565655_567575
we have a relationship . 567591_568681
&-um they're a_lot older so of_course that &+b &-uh builds a rift
mhm . 571967_572817
&-um and then because_of just family issues, how years go down the
&-um but it's still all love . 579598_580698
I still definitely love all of (th)em . 580779_582459
&-um you_know whenever they need me, if they know they really need
but &-um just kind_of how family life is . 587121_589631
like I said, <I'm so worried> &+ab <I'm not so> I'm so
they have a closer bond because they share the same mother and
me who's being the only child by my mother &-um and raised like a
that makes a_lot_of sense . 611934_613124
I can dig that . 613325_613965

from the kilo Ali days, from the days when Atlanta was more +//. 1313317_1316317
&-um I would say it was definitely lyrical but it was definitely a

it was a feel . 1322930_1323690
mhm . 1323711_1323861
&-um and even to go all the way down to the Migos, &-um they still
they have that young urban culture . 1331636_1333456
they got that kind_of already swag with them . 1333476_1336896
but you can see now_that they're getting a little older, they're
it's becoming to sound more musical, more instruments, more
nah ‡ I I I definitely definitely agree on that . 1349080_1351940
you_know ‡ &-um I like to say you_know people been atlantanized@n
+< right . 1361176_1361266
do you feel like &-um the influence of the music alone is affecting
&-um I definitely think that how the people are affected the music,
but I think that when it comes to music, it's more of what got
it's not that there's other people in Atlanta who are not making
it's not getting that constant &-uh you_know videos and things like
&-um which at this point in time now so understandable (be)cause
we get sucked in by the tv and all the stuff . 1425064_1428524
&-um so ‡ it's kind_of that . 1429054_1431584
I will say that words are very powerful &-um and especially in
if if &+y if if we can feel your words, that's kind_of
even Earth_Wind_And_Fire ‡ people really felt those words . 1458804_1462194
so that's the kind_of words that the people of the times are
wow . 1474412_1474922
<it was a_lot_of love> think about it, in in the seventies
so ‡ of_course there was a_lot_of more love . 1480417_1482497

you_know ‡ we we do understand that that's what the times were

it &+i it's it's the music . 1521732_1523062
<it's the> &+s it's the different things like that &-um when it
so &-um you_know ‡ you got a interesting &-um job being a dj and
but I guess I don't know . 1545400_1548310
I don't wanna assume as a dj it's not about what you like or listen
it's about what the people who what sposta like or
what's your thoughts on just that in particular ? 1557963_1561503
&-um interestingly enough I'm very biased when it comes to djing .
now ‡ don't get me wrong, I do understand that there are certain
but I &+whe when I dj my goal is not to make you really listen
I want you to dance . 1580133_1581313

I didn't get the feel . 1601756_1602226
&-um so ‡ I just don't play it anymore . 1603578_1604838
&-uh and now if there's a special request or someone needed it and

I_mean ‡ because especially Atlanta, we party from monday to monday

you will remember the flow and it's either gonna stick to you one
you either gonna like it or you're gonna dislike it . 1669173_1670733

those same people that's working in that Chick_Fil_A are the same
there's no difference in really the hiring process or <the
