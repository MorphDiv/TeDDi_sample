so . 340_440
why . 1740_1940
use the computer .
why use computer at all . 2300_3390
what's a good for . 3730_4290
well it's much faster than second graders are . 4710_7510
it's much more accurate . 8020_9140
&-um it allows them to to find out just how much they've really
&-um you know a a finished quilt . 15770_17620
can take three or four days of very laborious cutting and pasting
and I think they lose sight of &-um all it was that they're doing .
when they sat down and did a finished quilt in ten minutes and got
wow . 33560_33620
I mean that was pleasant . 33800_34570
it was pleasing . 34820_35380
it was fun . 35480_35830
and they were very proud of it . 36460_37980
so once &-um it really made them aware of all that . 38460_42500
they had learned . 42520_43020
they saw how quickly and easily they could do that . 43290_45100
got a result . 45120_45700
they were entirely pleased with could show off to everyone . 45720_48740
&-um and . 49140_51100
&-um you know in in most &-uh classrooms when we talk with
mhm . 61940_62290
usually the kinds of answers you get the way people think about
they think about it in terms of the curriculum . 68620_70170
like where they're at and how far they have to go . 71140_73340
mhm . 73840_73990
or they think about where the class is that is as a whole . 75130_79560
but often throughout this you know we asked you about the thinking
and you've talked to us about particular children &-uh as or &-um
now I have three more units to go be done . 96900_100390
so where did that kind of thinking that you're doing about these
where did that come from . 106050_106800
and how does it &-uh influence your instruc . 107550_110160
well . 111480_111570
this unit &-um in my mind anyway isn't designed or planned to get
unless the goals I had for my whole class begin with like exposure
I don't have goals for where my entire class will get . 137590_141970
that I can pinpoint exactly their broader range like that . 141990_145010
because they all began at such different points .
they've all come a tremendous &-um distance . 147500_151450
they all know much more . 151470_153570
they're all able to do a lot more with shapes and designing and
but I didn't have a point that I was trying to get everybody to and
and this unit isn't a unit in and of itself . 165290_168090
there's all of these ideas we will be coming back to in other
so I don't have to get to a certain point before I can stop doing
I just have to &-um open up a whole bunch of doors and get them
sometimes when &-uh . 190880_191640
oh excuse me . 192020_192500
that's the progress your children have made . 194690_199530
mhm . 199840_200060
in mathematics . 200340_200800
mhm . 201610_201740
is this progress that they're aware of . 202150_203570
do you do anything to help them . 204560_205660
be aware of that progress that they're made . 206100_207980
I do I mean I make a point of that . 208480_210060
I am I try to stay really in tune with how far each of them comes
I look for growth in each of them in different areas . 221360_223550
but &-um I try to make a point too of asking them for me . 224300_231670
it's there . 232280_232510
so the question about that this conversation part of is I'm asking
mhm . 243340_243480
&-um I I'd like to know if you think that they're aware of their
and if so how they come . 250540_251920
&-um they are aware in a kind of vague sense all of them 'cause I'd
well what did you used to know about quilts . 259300_260920
absolutely nothing . 261540_262410
Alex would say . 262890_263610
and what do you know now a lot . 264040_265530
what can you be more specific . 266410_267360
what do you know . 267410_267900
but &-um while they're involved in a task or a project or some new
gosh . 275410_275610
I'm learning something new here or I've never done this before . 275840_278160
wow . 278520_278690
I know a lot . 279090_279410
if I'm able to do this some of them are some of them verbalize to
I'm doing something different or I didn't think I'd be able to do
and I can do this . 289210_290160
'cause I used what I did yesterday to help me . 290840_293170
but &-um that's the kinds of things I want all of them saying and
so I do ask them a lot . 297850_300340
so what did we learn yesterday or . 300810_302830
so what do you know about flips and turns that you didn't used to
we spent a_lot_of time at the beginning getting those baseline &-um
what do we know about or by doing a journal entry . 320310_322960
tell me what this word means to you or right what you think makes a
and then coming back to that . 328720_330220
so journal entries I'll say . 330530_331780
yes . 331830_331940
you've had this identical same journal entry before . 332050_334570
but I'm expecting to see very different answers . 335200_337090
you've learned a whole lot more . 337210_338380
you're able to do a whole lot more . 338510_340530
try to show some of that in your journal entry . 340980_343130
and then we . 343150_343540
come together as a class and talk about what have we learned from
when we made that first journal entry about what makes a good quilt
how are our ideas different today . 352170_353810
how has our thinking changed . 353990_355210
&-um they need to be made to do that so that they stay conscious of
we'll have spent over a month on this unit when it's concluded . 363770_367260
and they need to be aware that they came a long ways in a month . 368380_371210
they came more than a month in that month of learning about quilts
and they're able to do things they couldn't do before . 378510_380450
and things they thought they knew about . 380790_382180
they know much more about . 382730_383820
and &-um why do you place such premium on that because that's a
&-um well hearing what someone else has learned helps you think . 394620_399430
oh yeah I've learned that too or gives you &-um a chance to
well yeah she learned that and that made me think that . 405390_407270
I've also learned this . 407290_408400
and &-um building their self-esteem their good feelings about math
their confidence in math . 415750_416820
they can't be confident about themselves as mathematicians if
not just . 424690_424890
oh good job in math . 425030_425890
today . 425910_426140
no what is it that you did that was good in math . 426760_428930
today you thought about this . 429270_430060
and you're sort of do this difficult problem . 430220_432050
and you learned how to do this . 432370_434050
which you didn't know how to do . 434190_435890
I want those I statements those statements about themselves coming
and &-um what's challenging about math for them . 451010_453730
but why that's okay with them . 454050_455690
but that's something they learn all year long . 456090_457890
and at the beginning it means me specifically saying to them . 457930_461150
what can you do in math that you used to be able to do . 462220_464890
making them say it out loud . 465130_466140
not just oh yeah I learned a lot or I can do that . 466660_469730
and I couldn't &-um and using them as examples . 470270_474220
&-um you know when I see a child doing something that in the
oh my gosh . 484650_484930
they're the last group to finish their strip quilt . 484990_487780
their they've made those core squares and . 487830_489500
remade them and remade them . 489750_490970
when their quilt is finished we celebrate . 491180_493010
when the next project that follows that is finished both of them
and everyone hears me say out loud . 498650_500460
look how easily they made their core squares or designing came so
they were able to have more fun . 505470_506890
&-um so that they don't start to feel they can't do it . 507370_511210
and so that the class as a whole notices they're not still
so they need to know that everyone else needs to know that . 516020_518299
and &-um they need to yeah take pride in those accomplishments
and not just lose sight of them because we've already moved on to
self esteem . 535390_535950
you mean a confidence . 537700_538430
I mean I was gonna say a confidence in themselves and how that they
and they know a lot math reflections about their actions . 544740_547270
well that's right . 548640_549210
it's not just me saying . 549640_550190
oh good job or one work . 550540_552660
no . 552860_553030
I want them to be able to specifically say what it is that they're
it's that they can't do what . 558400_560380
it's that they know that they didn't used to know right . 560550_563970
sure that that is . 564830_565340
okay . 565470_565710
it's heard . 566150_566380
and the part about how you know . 566540_567310
