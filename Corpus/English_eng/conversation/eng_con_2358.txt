&=laughs well ‡ I don't really know . 789045_790195
best teacher . 791897_792477
well ‡ I guess each one was best in his own way . 794946_797766
I_mean ‡ I don't know . 798043_799523
which one I learned the most from, I really couldn't say either . 799721_803171
I don't know, I I'll say my chem study teacher this year . 803543_806053
he seemed like +... 806098_806818
it was a hard course to begin with but he we &+c &-uh at
at least what the formula for salt was or something . 815874_818684
but I don't know . 819547_820447
I think I've always liked science mostly anyway but I &+l I
and <he was> he was always prepared and everything, put
would you say that's an &-uh a main ingredient for a person to
what goes into a good teacher ? 838211_840101
+< &-uh preparation ? 839809_840809
<well I don't> well there's this particular teacher, he
the way I understand it, he had started teaching there three years
and the &-uh course doesn't really change from year to year . 850114_853224
so ‡ the &-uh one of the teachers told me <for the> &+f
but &-uh then you_know the next year <he wouldn't have to> he
because &-um each day in class he would have his notes that he had
mhm what other things would a teacher hafta do to be xxx ? 884125_888175
well ‡ besides preparation I think he hasta understand the students
and well ‡ he hasta be willing to help them when they need help and
that's good . 904631_906061
did you ever have a teacher that you just didn't like for anything
no ‡ I I don't know . 911784_912754
I always seem to get along pretty well with most of the teachers .
but then I don't know, sometimes at a_lot_of the students
but usually I just do what he said and not bother with it . 923260_927160
because I remember like my biology teacher in ninth grade . 927523_931133
a_lot_of you_know either most of the students &+d just hated
and then &+ei there were those that hated him and then those that
and then <there were> there were those that just wouldn't do
they didn't care . 945261_945851
but then this year when I went to Schoolname you_know it's
students are different and all the teachers seem to be more
hm what was there about the biology teacher that made so many of
well ‡ &-um I don't know . 972472_974672
I think he had been teaching high school before and the change +//.
<I don't> in <when you> in high school a_lot_of
but &-uh I don't know . 985623_987193
in in junior high school I think they kinda spoonfeed you or
and when he came in, that was his first year there . 991194_993714
and <he didn't> he would just come in and lecture and things
and students wouldn't understand what he was saying . 1001123_1003313
and they just got fed up with it, I guess . 1003359_1006309
and didn't they just didn't want to do anything else . 1006359_1009509
and then I know once in a while he'd give tests and +... 1010065_1013295
&-like the very first test he gave us was a essay test . 1013753_1016513
and most students don't like to do those type tests because it's
and I &+don I don't know, I usually do better on essay tests
and then <I don't> once in a while he'd give us a test . 1031340_1033661
and half of the questions on there would be things he had never
hm . 1039761_1040021
but because I remember sometimes he'd just put a_lot_of
&-like I remember one example was he gave us a test and it had the
hm . 1054665_1054985
and we hadn't studied the heart or anything . 1055149_1057009
and about the blood cells . 1058099_1059339
and I think that was a couple of chapters ahead of us . 1059687_1062047
but <I don't> usually he'd either throw the test away or he
because I don't know not too many students failed except the ones
were you ever in a class where the kids played a trick on the
well well ‡ last this past summer at summer school in
&-um well <I don> I don't know . 1090468_1093048
it wasn't really a trick . 1093064_1093924
they just took the teacher's car and put it +//. 1093976_1096466
there was a big +//. 1096691_1097201
all of the &-uh buildings led to one circle &-like where +//. 1098413_1102343
and each path from each building would just end up in one circle
and they just moved his car from the &-uh parking lot down to the
and it &+j it just looked kinda funny sitting out in the middle
and then this year, just the week we got out_of school, just
<they &-uh took the> one of the counselors, they took his
and they took adhesive tape and made a seven and taped that on the
and put racing stripes out_of adhesive tape on there which really
and they set it on the track like a racing car or something . 1152577_1155557
and then they &+pu I think they put a smoke bomb in it or
but <he got> I I don't know, he found out about that some
and &*INV:hm he took the smoke bomb out before he moved his car . 1165665_1169765
that was about the funniest thing . 1170523_1171763
yeah that is pretty good . 1172058_1173628
how did these teachers react to these things ? 1173682_1176472
usually they just laugh „ you_know . 1177425_1179255
<they wouldn't> <I don't know> they wouldn't get mad or
<because> but they just usually played practical jokes and
but I don't know, I think one time though the whole faculty got mad
they had a &-uh a wit committee which would play jokes on
and for one thing, they &-uh in &+f in front of the school
I don't know if anybody came in to rent an apartment or anything „
<and then> but I &+th the thing that the faculty got mad about
so ‡ the &-uh that day everyone was late for classes and everything
and they hadta announce every time a period was over . 1226605_1229055
and they said it cost about three hundred dollars to fix those
bet that was a_little too much „ huh ? 1235594_1238454
yes . 1238536_1238946
when you were a a youngster of around ten or so, was there a

<well I don't> well ‡ after he gets through high school I
and he I don't know, <probably at first> it probably
but first two years or so probably is just book work and learning
and maybe I don't know, they're probably required to take
because that brings up another point about my biology teacher, I
he wanted to be a teacher doing something else . 1637940_1640230
and he said the only reason he didn't take it was because &-uh he
well ‡ he said, to quote &-uh +"/. 1647727_1649567
+" take classes on what to do when Johnny wet his pants and things
and he didn't want to be bothered with that so he didn't take that
but I guess in dentistry school they &-uh even have courses like
and then I guess they have about two years of &-like a lab
and then they probably get about two years of experience or
working in well &-like probably &-like a free clinic or something
and then I guess after that they go out into the world on their own
