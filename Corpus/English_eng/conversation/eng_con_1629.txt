I see <a> a camel .
and I see an elephant bouncing a ball really fast .
&=coughs that hurts my voice when I do that .
and the ball got stuck in the beach .
and the camel was swimming for it .
that (i)s pretty silly .
and the camel got the ball .
<and she> and the elephant was so happy to have her ball back .
I did it .
they (a)re going in the water .
and she wants to just dive in .
she slipped and hurt her knee .
<and> and the camel got another elephant .
and <the other> the boy elephant put a bandaid on .
then the girl elephant was better .
and the boy elephant said do n(o)t slip again .
the end .
the boy camel had a airplane .
he made funny noises with it though .
and then the girl elephant took it away from him .
and then she dropped it in the water .
and then the camel was mad !
and then the boy camel got this elephant to get it .
&=coughs <and the> and the girl elephant explained what

but he did n(o)t get it .
and then the boy camel got another girl camel to fetch it with

the end .
I see a rabbit and a dog building a sandcastle .
and the rabbit is building a sand block castle .
and the rabbit dumped it on the sandcastle .
and then the sandcastle did n(o)t look like one no more .
and then the dog tried to build it all over again .
the end .
they (a)re fetching some food and baskets .
and the rabbit caught <a> a carrot and a big long
and the rabbit was too full from all that .
and then all that food made him so dizzy .
and then the dog went to get the mother rabbit .
and the dog was pulling the mother rabbit .
&=laughs that (i)s so silly .
and then the mother rabbit saw that <his> her son was so
and then <sh> the mother rabbit bring him with her .
the end .
the boy dog was pushing <the> this with a balloon on it .
and the rabbit was trying to get it off .
but no way .
the dog didn't let him .
<and he> and the rabbit was tying it off .
and the dog was so scared <that> that it would just .
I'll rope it off .
and it floated away .
and then the dog was mad .
and the rabbit was holding a whole bunch of them .
and he pointed right at the same one he had .
<it> but it was too much money .
but he wanted to pick one what was the same money as the other
<and he> and he did n(o)t get one .
and the rabbit was saying his mother to buy him the same
and the son rabbit was pointing right at this balloon .
<and> and she had enough money to buy him one .
and then they both got one .
the end
