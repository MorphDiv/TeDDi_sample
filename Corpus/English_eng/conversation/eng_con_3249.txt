but using using the information that we gathered from that little thing +... 0_2465
twenty nine ? 2465_2960
twenty nine ? 2960_4360
about thirty . 4360_4835
so where are you getting these figures from ? 4835_7391
from the mean . 7391_8288
the mean ! 8288_8538
the mean ? 8538_9225
okay . 9225_10176
let's just have a look at those three numbers again: a mean of thirty point five seven, a median of twenty eight point five, and a mode of twenty five . 10176_20135
so you are electing, in this case, to use the mean . 20135_24560
yeah . 24560_25308
yeah . 25308_25535
why ? 25535_26335
why did you select the mean rather than the, uh, the mode for example ? 26335_31903
yep ? 31903_32990
(be)cause that's on an average of, um, all of the +... 32990_36320
things . 36320_38086
yeah ? 38086_39041
yeah +... 39041_39376
(be)cause it's the largest number xxx get . 39376_42255
okay, so you're going to select the larger number, and just ensure that you're going to end up with the three, yeah ? 42255_50366
what about if you were a chocolate chip cookie manufacturer, yeah ? 50366_57671
and you were looking at ensuring that every cookie had three chocolate chips in it ? 57671_64910
you make a separate batch for each one, for each cookie . 64910_69166
you're joking . 69166_71663
mix up mix up the +... 71663_73285
well, that's that's a way to ensure it . 73285_74421
mix up the pan mix up the the, um, dough +... 74421_78516
yeah +... 78516_78910
put it on the pan, and then put three things in each one . 78910_83308
oh, I see . 83308_83701
yeah . 83701_84221
okay . 84221_84763
but what about if all of the ingredients were all mixed in, which I've got no idea if they are because every when you buy those chocolate, uh, chip cookies, they don't all have the same number . 84763_96691
there's no fellow sitting there poking in the same number of, uh, chips is there ? 96691_102268
&=laughs . 102268_103115
so all of the ingredients are mixed together . 103115_104675
and they would have some quality control and quantity control to ensure that there are a minimum number of chocolate chips . 104675_113585
they base it on weight . 113585_114701
they what they do is they say each cookie, say, weigh weighs, um, say, X number of grams . 114701_121061
yeah . 121061_121340
if they if it's under, then +... 121340_123803
well, what they do is they just mix it up so that even if it's a different size or shape, it still weighs the same . 123803_130061
so are you telling me that they weigh every cookie ? 130061_132876
yep . 132876_133173
yeah . 133173_133853
after xxx . 133853_134855
I doubt it . 134855_135525
well, that's what they do, that's what they xxx . 135525_137131
my my dad says they do . 137131_138046
yeah ? 138046_138446
and he's a quality manufacturer . 138446_140568
is he ? 140568_141173
&=laughs ! 141173_142753
yeah ? 142753_143128
what, where they make these chocolate chip cookies ? 143128_146303
yeah . 146303_146655
&=laughs aw, go on ! 146655_147815
is he ? 147815_148491
no, he does different companies . 148491_151011
okay . 151011_152115
but he's done it for xxx . 152115_153490
in your home situation, most likely you wouldn't look at the thirty point five seven . 153490_158683
yeah ? 158683_159146
if you were a bulk manufacturer, uh, of these things and you wish to ensure that you had them, uh +... 159146_168425
I guess the thirty point five seven, which you'd take is &~th uh, thirty or thirty one, would be the number that you'd pick . 168425_177321
yeah . 177321_178001
there were there were a couple of scores there, like the forty two and the forty three, that mentioned who got the forty two ? 178001_185025
we did . 185025_186031
okay . 186031_187216
we got +... 187216_187753
those those two scores seem very high compared to the rest, yes ? 187753_192385
&=bell . 192385_193040
and we are not going to have time to enter this data and check it . 193040_197208
so, second function, on . 197208_204303
put the covers back onto your calculators . 204303_209728
beg your pardon ? 209728_211350
yes, thanks . 211350_237376
yep . 237376_239853

we'll be back about three o'clock . 247301_249148
just wait, thank you . 249148_255355
just wait . 255355_257995
I wanna make sure that every calculator has been brought back . 257995_261586
is there anybody who has not returned their calculator ? 261586_280955
that's it ? 280955_284288
have a nice weekend, people . 284288_285698
do you want these, or xxx ? 285698_288113
you can keep those . 288113_288951
bring them back in on Monday . 288951_292288
bring those sheets back in on Monday, please . 292288_295088
we have to bring them in ? 295088_297673
yeah, bring them back and we'll just continue with that . 297673_300671
so we can get to check them with a calculator +... 300671_305386
yes, we will . 305386_319675
