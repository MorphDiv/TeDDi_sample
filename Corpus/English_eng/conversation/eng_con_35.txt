after about ten years, there was two men .
one was waiting for the other .
and the police came along .
and wanted to know what he was doing there .
he told the police that he was waiting for his friend .
the police was really the friend that he was looking for .
but after the police looked at him he discovered that he was a
and so he kept walking .
he didn't want to be the one to arrest him because he was his
but he sent another man back to arrest him .
and after they talked for awhile, they just left <for the>
and they wanted to have dinner .
but the restaurant had been torn down after while .
and they didn't have nowhere to eat .
but they walked around for awhile to find another place .
and then his friend, what supposed to have been his friend told him
and he was the man who <was supposed to have been> was wanted by
and after that they they took him to jail .
took him .
and I guess locked him up or something .
so that he was kind_of disappointed then because he thought that he
he had not too much to be excited about after waiting with a cigar
and I guess, what else was he supposed to do ?
and his friend was from the West, I think .
<and after> I don't remember all of this story .
after that I think he went on .
the restaurant was called Big_Joe's Big_Joe_Brady's restaurant .
and but they didn't go in there because it had been torn down .
and they went some place else to have dinner .
after they got there the guy told him that he was wanted by the
and after that I don't remember too much .
well, when I was a little girl .
I don't remember my mother .
my mother died when I was a baby .
and my grandmother had to send my uncle to pick me up from my other
I don't think they gave him <too much>
so my uncle took his coat off .
and wrapped around me .
so that I would stay warm .
but by the time I got from Hamlet North_Carolina to Rockingham
and my my dad's mother had to take care of me .
and raise me up to I got grown .
I'm here .
still here .
and hopefully I will continue .
but I had some aunts and uncles .
and they were nice .
and my dad's uncles helped my grandmother to rear me .
and my dad died in nineteen fifty .
so I still don't have no brothers and sister .
I never had any .
but I've been happy .
and so far I'm not doing too bad .
but I was fortunate myself to have six girls and two boys that made
so now I am doing okay .
I'm seventy six years old .
I'm not sick really &-uh .
I do suffer with a little high blood pressure, things like that .
I guess everybody have some kind_of complaints when they get a
but so far I'm doing okay .
