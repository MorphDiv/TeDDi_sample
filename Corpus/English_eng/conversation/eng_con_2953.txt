so now, what I'd like to do just for a few minutes, have a nice conversation, think of different situations that these people might be in where their opinion and what they believe might come in . 105_16505
practice a little bit using our vocabulary: stray, intentions, apprehend, regulations, designate, acceptable . 16805_27245
it's all hanging up there . 27325_28365
do a little discussion, see if you agree, use the word . 28805_31885
just talk about how you could use the word and then we'll try the fish bowl . 32085_35325
okay . 35705_36025
we'll give some people opportunities . 36185_37305
so I agree with +... 37725_39045
get into your groups, have a conversation .
I agree with xxx because you sometimes can have certain reasons to break the rules . 39765_47365
if you have to, then you have to . 47785_53065
but in this matter it wasn't really that you had to . 54505_57345
it was to make somebody feel better and happy . 57785_61905
but if you steal from the store, that's kind of bad but +... 62485_65885
to make someone happy or sad but +... 66045_69585
but he did also have good intentions . 69865_72945
and she kind of feels bad for him . 73265_79425
I don't think she thought there would be a huge consequence but there would still be a little consequence . 80765_88245
sometimes my mom says something not to do and then later after she says to do it and you're like you just told me not to do it . 89145_103245
if moms say it, you always have to do it . 104285_106745
you always have to . 108465_109405
but his mom didn't tell him to do that . 110145_114825
his mom didn't tell him to do it . 115265_117045
he just went ahead and +... 117145_118345
he just wanted to make her feel better because she's been sick in bed for a while . 118905_123025
I kind of agree with him because if my mom was sick, I'd pick her flowers . 124065_134925
so we were just talking about when the mom says to do something that +... 136625_141225
but the mom didn't say to do it . 141965_143425
the mom didn't say anything . 143425_144305
because, over there when TCH came and said that, oh your mother's dying . 145105_156765
you don't have to stop and get some flowers . 157525_160065
because, you can't do anything . 160465_162345
you kind of have to . 164665_164965
you don't want to be like, mom, you're dying . 164965_168105
I was just in a park with tons of flowers and I didn't get you any because the park ranger told me not to and I'm a responsible child . 168585_174225
well, look that would just be, never mind . 174305_176105
that would be just mean . 176105_176985
yeah, that's why we moved ! 177285_179465
that's why we moved . 179785_180785
he wanted to make his mom feel better . 180785_182445
only break the rules when you need to, when necessary . 182645_187625
you shouldn't in general .
sometimes my mom says that you are not to do it . 187925_191865
yeah, I'm telling them . 195355_196655
like, for instance, don't break a window and then if there's a fire in your room and you really can't get out you have to break the window . 197355_203255
there are times when you can break a window and then there's times when you can't break a window . 204015_209355
sometimes if there's an emergency sometimes you have to but when it's not necessary +... 210355_216315
taking flowers aren't going to kill anybody . 218735_219715
it's in a field and like three are missing . 220875_224015
my dad, when we were talking about safety things in the summer and then my dad said if you're ever stuck at a room and there's fires outside, punch the screen and you'll just jump out . 226055_239855
or put pillows and then he just did a drill . 240695_246875
he punched the screen and jumped out of the house and I'm like why did you just do that ? 246945_250425
it's just acceptable to be like, oh no I can't get out . 250425_256225
there's a fire . 256545_257185
should I die or break the window ? 257885_259285
oh but I'm a responsible child . 259565_261105
I'd rather die than break my mom's beautiful window . 261305_263385
that actually matters if they're like your flowers . 263705_265865
if they're your flowers, then of course +... 267205_273085
but, it's kind of important because the flowers that he picked were extinct . 268745_273905
flowers can't be extinct . 274965_277145
yes they can but they weren't extinct . 277465_279485
just like those old xxx . 280045_281225
we're talking about a sick mother and a kid wanting to get some flowers . 281885_285485
what if they weren't extinct and then they just +... 285565_287405
no, they were endangered . 288125_289645
here's the test . 290605_295525
so on the smart board is the perspective . 302105_304605
on the wall to the right of the smart board are the perspectives in a broader sense . 305805_312785
your job, four characters, is to support the perspective of your character . 315125_321525
keep the conversation going using as many of the vocabulary words for the week, the six that we have, as much as you can in the correct text, the correct way . 323275_338275
and the other thing that you need to do is show that you're a good listener . 338795_347875
okay, how are you listening, how are you responding back to someone who just spoke ? 349035_353715
okay, I'm going to ask that xxx come a little closer to the front and xxx can you go back a little bit . 354675_365935
xxx, if someone says the word designate, designated, okay, you're going to tally that up, okay . 367055_376675
all right, who would like to begin ? 377865_380605
go ahead, S_seven . 381885_382705
well, so you guys all think of the different kind of way but I don't think straying off is the right thing to do . 383465_392905
even that's not a good thing to do, but if your mother is dying and you don't have anywhere to go then you might need to just pick a few flowers . 394595_406515
and there's like a whole field just waiting there, so it's okay if you pick like three or four . 406755_413815
it's not okay to break the rule . 414455_417435
you're still breaking the rules . 418035_419395
it doesn't matter for what reason you're breaking the rules . 419585_422745
he shouldn't be judged because he was just trying to help his mom . 423405_428545
well, I bet it wasn't good that he got apprehend by one of the guards . 431185_435985
his intention wasn't to, he didn't mean to do anything bad . 437785_444665
he just wanted to make his mother feel better because she was going to die . 444985_450545
I think that, yes, his intentions were good but I don't think that his mom's going to be too happy about him breaking the rules even though it was for good intentions . 452645_464645
that's true . 466645_467565
his mom might not be as happy because she might be embarrassed . 467945_471545
because, that was put on the newspaper and on the xxx . 471675_476375
but it still is possible that he could have just picked a few and just left the other ones . 477815_492755
if he picked a few it's just as bad as picking a lot because you're still breaking the regulations and it's not acceptable . 500945_514425
I think that the park ranger since he was +... 515585_520125
I think the park ranger should have apprehended him because it was his designated job . 522245_530005
what about the rare ones ? 531045_533885
if he had taken a rare one, then he definitely would have gotten in some trouble . 535065_541925
yeah, but if there was only five hundred in the world, let's say, then other people would think it's cool to pick flowers if one person does it . 541995_554915
then they would all start walking off designated paths and then just start plucking out all the flowers until there's nothing left . 555855_566055
but, then there would be stray seeds and they won't be able to grow because they could have pulled out seeds when they pulled out some of the flowers . 566525_576165
that's true . 576645_577325
if you're going to break the rules, you should at least ask if you can take some and if they say no then +... 577725_589485
you can take the consequence and do it but you still have to do the consequence . 586945_593985
and what about the other animals too ? 594865_597745
what about the bees ? 597825_598525
they don't have any nectar to pollinate . 598825_601365
there isn't any flowers too . 601985_603825
so are the butterflies and all the other nice creatures . 604365_607045
you may be able to take the consequences but you have to think about what you're doing . 611585_617825
you have to think about what the consequence would be and think about different animals like S_seven mentioned . 618065_625285
yeah, even if you can take the consequence, the other animals need that to live . 625985_635845
you don't need a flower to live . 636045_637685
his mom was going to die . 645265_646565
it wouldn't be that bad if you didn't pick one flower . 647765_656885
it's like a fire and your parents say that you can't break the window but if there's a fire you would have to . 657165_672585
because if there was a fire outside your door, what else would you do ? 673765_678405
right . 679105_679245
yeah, well, maybe it's acceptable then but that's a life and death situation, it's not having a flower and not having a flower . 679485_692625
still having a flower can mean something special . 694885_697485
there could be a relationship if the mom really liked that certain kind of flower, it would make her feel better because she could die . 698405_710605
it might make her feel better . 711205_712425
