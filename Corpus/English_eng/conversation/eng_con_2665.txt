we we have two sites you haven't seen the xxx before have you ? 2275_5575
no . 5895_5995
&-um .
<or Mark> ? 6095_6275
okay . 6375_6555
we have two sites one is on North Campus which &-uh if &-uh this is the Pierpont Commons the Media Union and the bell tower this is Bonisteel here and Murfin goes up the hill here &-uh so the site is really largely where the current parking lot is to the north of Pierpont Commons . 6975_25795
or that slope . 26395_27015
that whole area was open for choice . 27605_30225
and the other site is &-um in town on Central Campus &-uh State Street is here &-um Student Union West Quad +/. 31105_43585
<looks exactly like> +/.
+, <Thompson Street> Thompson Street parking structure . 45345_46925
this is currently used as grade level parking . 47545_49725
alright &-um and Blimpy Burger is here <lying down> okay ? 51715_55775
just to set the context . 56095_57415
this is South Quad . 57895_58715
so the two sites &-uh you'll see schemes on both sites through the afternoon . 59255_63415
okay some students have been working individually and some have been working in pairs . 64715_69475
so &-um this is obviously a pair . 69975_71815
&=laughs .
&-um in looking at the &-uh North Campus we found that it's quite obvious &-um that there's a suburban feel to the environment and what we've tried to do with our scheme &-uh was kind_of two things . 75915_89355
one was try to reduce the &-um suburban feel like the Media Union has &-um on this side of the street to the the front of the building and as_well_as somehow try to address the &-um quadrangle &-uh which is &-uh presently which presently is starting to look like it's forming . 89515_108555
&-um and we realized that our building doesn't complete the quad and &-uh we're trying to attempt to somehow &-um get a sense of a new way of designing &-uh buildings for &-uh North Campus . 109115_121635
so what we've done basically is try to &-um bring over the Murfin Road and have our building interact with the street as_well_as with the quad . 121915_132135
&-um in a larger &-uh +... 132715_134455
master plan if you will . 136755_138355
<and are you going to change Murfin> ?
yeah Murfin currently goes straight down so what we've done is we &{l=SIC curve &}l=SIC it bring it over so that we could have the road &-um interact with the building as_well_as have our building &-um interact with the quadrangle . 139255_152535
oh .
&-um let me go through this &-uh programmatically if &-uh . 155975_166595
George I can't . 166595_166735
let me go through &-uh programmatically .
the &-uh the main entrance &-uh to our building is where the roof where there's an existing roof where this this is the &-uh ground floor plan where this is the Pier Commons and there's the &-um existing roof that exists there right now we're planning on keeping that and using that as the main entrance into the building .
whereby you can sorta see it in this view right here and &-um so the main entrance &-um is like this point right here . 185835_194155
it sorta edges you into a what you call vestibule because it's sorta separated from the rest of the building as a sort_of very public &-uh primary &~ci &-uh circulation space . 194635_207055
now this is <one of> one of three that we have . 207935_210295
&-um this is one finger primary &-uh circulation could be allowed publicly as long as this finger right here +//. 210905_217945
&-um when I describe this finger &-uh &-um my &-uh concept was that these fingers which is the circulation space were sort_of &-um &-uh cocooned in the studio space . 219765_230945
(be)cause we thought that studio space was was <very much> &-um very much &-uh the the sacred space of an architecture building . 231605_240245
so we wanted to to really &-um to &-uh enclose it and sort_of make this space &-uh you know not necessarily &-um closed to the public but maybe certain parts open to the public but &-um something that you you can go to but can't really see from the exterior of the building . 240465_260625
so &~s you enter through the building <and &-um> and &-um these are the two fingers as I mentioned before . 262185_271445
now in the ground floor we have all of our public spaces as soon as you enter you get an exhibition space right here . 272145_277885
&-um where we'd have a coffee shop we have a lecture hall auditorium a public ITD space which not necessarily is for the computing space for the whole School of Architecture but more for public use . 278865_292045
we have a computer xxx upstairs I mentioned . 292285_295525
and around this other &-um circulation space on the ground floor we have a mechanical space right here . 296145_304345
I'll talk a little bit more about that afterwards but on the right hand side of it we get our computer classes areas &-um you know you get your seminars right here you got your workshop right here . 305315_316575
and on the other finger of the circulation space we get our GSI labs we get our high bay spaces this is them right here . 318355_325855
now on the ground floor what we did what we decided to do for the parking was that we decided &-um we're gonna use the existing parking . 326895_334335
but we're gonna cover it so there is we're saying that &~th there isn't gonna be any sort_of an excavation . 334555_339855
we're building from the existing grade up . 340115_342175
so we're we decided that we're gonna have parking within our building coming off of a street off of Murfin entering into as a one way coming back out and out back out that way out to Murfin . 343635_359995
as our as programmatically for the parking spaces that are required . 360915_364835
&-um ways of getting &~on onto the second floor now there's a_couple_of ways of doing that . 366745_372145
&-uh from the main entrance there is an accessibility of &-uh a set of stairs and elevator here or you can go up &-um a one hundred and eighty foot ramp one to twelve ratio scale for the handicap accessibility up until the studio space . 373125_390505
&-uh you don't quite get right into studio space as soon as you get up . 391165_394485
&-um you get into this other catwalk that runs back the other way which actually connects you to this other piece which is another sort_of face of our building which is across the street which &-um is the admin &-uh offices on the ground floor plan and +//. 395505_415985
but when you come up the ramp onto the second floor you bridge across you get directly &~in into faculty offices which went two stories up from that and one more top for GSIs PhDs +... 416165_430245
so . 430365_432565
&-um getting back to over here &-um we get back into the catwalk right here . 432885_439765
this coffee space runs two stories . 440425_442645
so you can actually access &-um studio level floor from the studio level floor down into the coffee shop into this two story area space . 443055_451375
so basically you get up to this point right here . 453155_457235
right here &-um where we have our coffee &-um copy center sorry area &-um sorta publicly &-um publicly located and then after we get an extension of our studio space which is on one floor . 457605_473085
so an existing building on this side is only a two story building . 473805_476405
where studio spaces are subdivided +... 476825_480565
and <we get our> &~cre we get our &~c &-uh computer <pool areas> . 482655_486735
&-uh which is &-uh interconnected within within those studio spaces . 487715_492535
now that's one part of the studio but +... 493215_496155
&-um the crit@n spaces are located right here facing &-uh and so now this view right here . 496475_507615
alright that view is actually sort_of standing right here and looking up that way . 508305_511645
so I'm getting a view into studio . 512085_513505
but I +//. 514365_514565
<you get a> you get a view also of the crit@n spaces that's located right here on this other &-um circulation space . 515125_522265
whereby on the same level as the studio space I bridge across <over these> &-um over these three bridges that exist one two and three over into our classroom area &-um which is another which is sorta separated from studio yet somewhat connected by these bridges +... 523105_543145
and &-um we have our typical all the the fire exit &-uh requirements &-um two hundred feet <there'll be a> fire exit stair . 545545_555605
yeah &-um let me just explain some of the views if you can't read it this is the main entrance view up so as soon as you enter you get this round going up +... 556645_570065
you get your exhibition space will be right here and you get your auditorium lecture hall and your ITD in on the corner . 571225_578985
so you can kinda +... 580465_581205
could you talk xxx +/.
+, this is the studios &-uh this is the back this is the back finger hole which is this finger right here . 585025_590525
there by you know go by you &~tr you're trying to introduce &-um the public into the building because in a way this +//. 595775_600855
the +//.
there's there's a couple layers are full of <pull living> you can see that <you get> you get this you get this later and after you get you know sort_of this layer within a layer . 601715_612675
so you get your studio space encapsulated with as I said with the circulation finger space . 613075_619135
whereby +//. 620155_620355
where the public can sort_of feed in and so they'll start to interact with the architecture building a little bit better which &-uh I don't think that this building provides as much interaction they seem sort_of very closed off lately +... 620785_634205
these views right here as I said before <these are> &-uh these are the &-um the main entrance nook which exists and that's our main entrance with &-uh with the xxx center facing out . 637065_650765
this is &-uh looking south &-um +... 651305_653725
northwest coming up +... 656145_657465
⌈ but you can ⌉ .
⌊ but this is on Murfin ⌋ ?
this is &~fr .
yeah this is looking Murfin looking south and that's the Media Union and that's the Pier Commons in the background and this is looking from the engineering side so this is the Media Union on that side right there this is the bell tower and that's the architecture building right there +... 658585_675305
&-um we wanted &-um I guess you can see if I wouldn't wanna leave admin . 676695_680895
the admin was meant to be this space whereby it's I know it you know we wanted to make this sort_of a +//. 682115_692815
we wanted to use this space because we wanted to really interconnect the road with the courtyard . 693475_698515
so by us <putting this> putting this &-um this other face of our building on this side of the road we sorta try to use this <try to> try to use &-um use this green space to our advantage . 699135_713755
&-uh whereby it's it's very &-uh sparsely used right now at the moment so I think by by doing that I guess you <start to> start to get a sense of that +//. 713995_724635
of the interaction that that could possibly happen with that space and for future development we'd be rooting for this area between us our possible architecture building and the Music School . 724865_735645
professors now can't complain that they're away from students and they'll have their own private spaces so they're &-uh in the woods so to speak . 736725_744685
in the woods &-uh very sorta transparent in this direction . 744845_749545
you mentioned &-uh as the opening of your discussion of this project said that North Campus has a suburban feel it'd be more run throughout the entire building . 751625_761065
&-um what is ?
I agree I mean it certainly says organized office park feeling to North Campus what in particular were you addressing ? 761805_771425
I'm addressing more the the street frontage of the building face the long lawns similar <to like> ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 771825_777645
⌊ these kind of ⌋ areas here these very . 777725_779525
don't you have one ? 779985_780605
I mean have you . 781405_782105
well when we <very first drew this lawn> not really I mean we tried to do entrance ⌈ <beginnings coming from> ⌉ . 782605_789405
⌊ you know ⌋ you know like even in words you know we're defining this entrance it's it's beautiful fun of from mhm &=clears_throat excuse_me the street . 789745_795885
so ours was a little bit both so it's more pedestrian scale &-um ⌈ so what it's <a suggestion> ⌉ . 796305_801665
⌊ so is it &-uh it's just the &~en ⌋ it's just the entrance and not actually the &~s siting of the building <that you> that you mean ? 802005_809965
it's +//.
I would go more with the entrance then however we needed suggestions xxx to address certain issues I think we'll need you can keep the whole keep the street perfectly straight and have the building <how it looks> on the street and have it faced on the street I guess that's the way to &-uh &-uh . 809165_832385
(be)cause we don't need necessarily a right answer to it but we I guess you know since we started to try to do that because the coffee area sort_of leads right into this area right here you can see . 832085_839985
to the what ? 840485_840985
the coffee area so there . 841385_842405
the coffee ? 842705_842925
yeah the coffee shop area +/. 843125_844325
okay +/.
+, so it leads on top of the &-uh exhibition right after <you know> interaction with the +//. 844665_849885
this stairs is leading down into this area . 850885_852645
so the I I I I know that's not necessarily ⌈ <&-um &-uh> enough ⌉ . 853165_857745
⌊ I guess ⌋ but I mean I don't think this I'm not this <isn't > I'm just mentioning that &~th you have this huge large area here like this kind of this ambiguous maze xxx building so &-um you do in fact have a suburbanized siting of your project . 856365_870505
not that the entrance doesn't work as you're saying in a the way it does . 870745_875065
but I think you have a really interesting architectural problem <&-um (be)cause> the problem is is your building it has two fronts . 875505_882005
and you've made even a third . 882925_884345
right ? 884695_885055
so clearly the side on the street is a kind of front . 885115_887975
and clearly the side on the quad is a kind of front . 888435_891455
and yet you've placed your front in the back to the &-um south right ? 892615_898935
where you placed your entrance against Pierpont Commons in the back on the door which is where the coffee niche is . 899015_905355
and by doing that you made the two other edges your sides +... 905695_908995
I think you've done that &-um programmatically as well (be)cause on the sides &-um well it's pretty clear but how <can the> central access to your building ? 911805_919285
right ? 919985_921345
with the studio space and those crit@n tables kind of part of the that central access . 921765_925205
and then on the &-um on either side of that block which forms <in as> part of your project studio spaces you have circulation space . 925925_933865
and then it and the ground floor you have the circulation space coupled with this kind of &-um with lab functions and kind of poshay@u functions in a way utility functions &-um on those two flanking kind of sides . 934545_948185
so to me it does need to be done front back sides but really the site asks for front and a front . 948905_955185
and maybe a front down here . 955485_956705
so to me I think that there would need to be some reconsideration of the program for example or where where we could talk about people coming in . 957835_965295
and using your building to me a long circulation corridor on the quad side doesn't quite do that to me . 965375_971955
I would imagine maybe placing the &-um ITD computer rooms and probably the <copy bay> and things like that &-um along the edge so_that you're activating the quad which is really the social space of North Campus . 972055_983195
and it's along this edge .
it's in the corner +/. 985405_986185
it's on +/.

⌊ <and you need> a public space .

you're ⌋ definitely right it does go it does go like this . 989405_991705

you only have entrances at the two ends . 993105_994705
there's an entrance <here and> here and here . 995425_996665
and the other end . 996665_997165

the entire length of your building is a big glass wall and there's no entrance . 1008965_1012845
<not in> not in <that side> .
I I think there's something also that &-uh Teresa's comment on that in terms of what were you trying to accomplish in getting rid of the suburban ? 1016935_1025375
and my thinking is that you're trying to make it more urban is that correct ? 1026055_1030735
and I think about &-uh you know the idea of bringing the street to the building and that being the driving force in in making this more of an urban state . 1031255_1040235
&-um but I almost feel like you really need to you know in_order_to accomplish that it's somewhat set back as well &~wh whereas to achieve something really urban you kind_of need a continuation of pedestrian traffic along that urban side . 1041075_1057075
and what I'm &~s I think the difficulty that I'm having with that is that on what you would truly consider your urban side where the street is you've placed the mechanical room . 1057935_1068155
so you +//. 1068735_1069035
there's not even really maybe the potential for if something was to happen on either side for activity to happen along that urban side face of the building . 1069715_1080335
it's it's really kind_of conducive to to highway +/. 1081315_1084395

an interesting thing is you're not gonna +//. 1086395_1087715
with one building you're not going to be able to make North Campus urban . 1087855_1090775
it's just not urban it's a suburban office park type campus . 1091395_1096095
and I think that &-um I think one building on the street doesn't do anything . 1096165_1100185
the architecture building is essentially on the street and and Bonisteel isn't an urban street it's a it's very much kind of this just traffic prone +... 1100665_1111325
so in a way that desire to make it urban I think is a little bit misplaced . 1112285_1116665
do you think xxx .
<not that> not that I think that your project has nothing <of value> . 1117505_1121805
it's just different +/.
well +/.
+, I just think that the &~d that desire is almost impossible to accomplish right ? 1121775_1126395
to make North Campus urban . 1126575_1127615
yeah .
I know with one building .
but do you think if they described if they started off by saying &-um that the one of the things that happens on North Campus is that buildings &-uh fronts face the quad and their backs face the street . 1128295_1142615
and therefore when you're on the street you have sense that you're really not part of the campus you're out_of the action . 1143125_1149825
and I I think that one of the things they're trying to do is to break down &-uh begin to break down that meaning . 1150445_1156525
so that all backs don't face outwards toward the street and all fronts don't face inwards toward the quad . 1157405_1163265

you know there's a +//. 1171785_1172905
one green space everything that faces onto that is a first class citizen and everything which doesn't have frontage on that is a second class citizen . 1173265_1179705
that's the way it's beginning to look around here . 1180185_1182305
I I definitely I mean I can appreciate that notion too . 1182665_1185685
I I just feel like in_order_to really try to make that a little bit more successful +//. 1185965_1190245
and I think you you started with it +//. 1190365_1191825
is to really allow it to have a front other than something that's nonusable I mean <take the> take the classrooms or something like that and move your mechanicals in towards your open space where you have parking and and things of that nature . 1192325_1204725
&-um <it just> it just really feels like particularly when I look <at the> &-uh at the view looking back towards the Media Union from Murfin that entire &~s street side I mean you're looking at you know Louvers_Grilles and and things of that nature and and I think that that's starting to speak more about what you're talking about than than is actually the existing condition +... 1205485_1225545

you know not to get hung up on this issue either I I think that it's very interesting your exploration between the way the classrooms relate to the studios . 1229205_1238985

there could be some sense of integration there where they feel like they're a_lot more in proximity to one another and I like the idea <of the> of the bridging as well and having that open space &-uh between so that there is some sense of of separation but yet it has kind_of a dialogue between it that I think is somewhat interesting too . 1243865_1262045
could you talk a bit about about how you chose the form of your roof and how you chose to butt up to these circulation spaces on one side and how you chose what <wide reach of space it could be> and what form they should be ? 1264435_1278735

we wanted these fingers to be more the circulation to be more the dominant feature in the building and then after you get the recessed studio and then after the in studio it you know the circulation is actually reversed because it's +//. 1310395_1322475

or was it just an emotional response ? 1352425_1355085
<which is> still a little technical I gave you a picture of mine in the studio . 1355425_1358085

but then after &-um bounced around then after it bounced off the roof and sort_of just &-uh . 1373975_1379755
well you could look at the sounstitch@u roof and and look at how how how close do theirs need to be underneath the &-um skylights to make that work and still get the feeling you've got . 1379755_1393975
I mean a_lot_of folks have no problem with it but you've you didn't explain you didn't include it in your presentation and yet when you look at the model it's the first thing that you see .

whereas I felt as if if you had carried them before you moved the barrel vault out to the sides you would then xxx the studios even though there was the walkway in between . 1426155_1435195

⌈ <could this> ⌉ .
⌊ it's ⌋ it's very strange sort_of . 1451075_1454995
I think that's I mean that's been a recurring topic of discussion is what the relationship is between the the form of the studio space and the and one of the things about carrying the the &~studi the walls out is that &-um this studio is not a free standing building . 1453605_1471805
and so the junction conditions in each side are very different . 1472725_1475965
<and so when you> &~tr and so when you try to make the studio rooftop it ends up being a nightmare . 1476225_1481585
in terms of how it joins onto the things around it . 1481945_1484885
because the conditions are so different from side to side . 1485085_1487345

+, ⌊ the ⌋ quad to somehow articulating &-um the maybe the roof maybe something else at that end because really I mean when you think about buildings on North Campus one thing that they all have in common is that they're big &~she big shells in which the facade as a thin skin is kind_of the way you can describe these buildings right ? 1492745_1511365
that's how the Media Union is that's how this building is they're big enclosures big volumes enclosed by a very sheer thin surface . 1511685_1519545
and I think that that is one reason why they &~o they obviously have scaled to the scale of the building not to the scale of the pedestrian or the quad or a sidewalk kind of thing and to me this surface is about as sheer a surface as you can possibly get . 1520265_1536605
right ? 1537365_1537385
and even then having a layer of space inside that should be articulates <the continuity> of that surface further adds to the kind of large largeness of scale of the building through program demands . 1537505_1548565
right ? 1548935_1549335
and and &-uh economy wouldn't suggest you have a big <open front> . 1549395_1552275
but somehow I feel that surface needs to be broken up . 1553515_1555795
and one way would be doing with big roof and you notice this could extend down somehow maybe to kind_of somehow acknowledge the exterior of the building . 1556475_1563135
we tried some and maybe it's not successful of the sides out here at left perhaps &-um +... 1564175_1578775

we &~ha +/.

yeah .
<slight on that side> .
so we have on both sides xxx and a wide alley which <you know> creates <I mean higher on one side> . 1582915_1591575
so it's to add <a kind of depth to the scale> and kind of break up that long &-uh +... 1592095_1596155
so .
but it also separates the building from the quality of the lawn . 1598575_1604615

that's true .
sorry ⌈ it's interesting though that these things come <into the> ⌉ . 1607335_1610135

⌊ are you saying ⌋ the water separates from the quad ? 1612035_1613735
if it was one or the other you'd have a better opportunity for that . 1614355_1617515
but because <you have> you have the water element and that exterior seating that kind of physically makes that distance separation from the building and then you have the the layer of skin that gives you kind_of that &-uh separation in terms of being kind_of like tactile or auditory to the building . 1617465_1637685
you're you're really quite separated in seeing it as a distance of an entire skin . 1638725_1642805
rather than even if you had this skin you know somebody could approach the building and be in the same kind of pedestrian space as them but now you kind_of not allowed people to have either of those . 1642945_1655825
I mean for just for example like little things . 1656885_1659125
that cafe could be located maybe on that side or it could be something that extends out_of the building to make kind_of a canopy but <off the roof> or somewhere else you could have program which means from the inside to the outside so that you acclimate the edge of the quad . 1659285_1670545
see what I mean ?
that's one example . 1672945_1674065

<not quite you don't know &~ar art> well the woodshop maybe right ? 1677805_1681745

the idea of of vehicular traffic an idea of what's happening in the building you can see people moving through it you can see the the revelation of that vault happening through the skin but it gives you a very clear layer of definition of that skin that that kind of gives it some some protection from that . 1986365_2003565
it's like high west .

on North Campus it's been much more difficult to resolve this question of fronts sides and backs and people tend to have been &-um perhaps been a wee bit more blinkered about that so and saying okay this is the front this is the back and in a way maybe you can't afford to have a back . 2058805_2074105

Chris I'll tell you very quickly how we got to that . 2222895_2224695
there were originally &~m many more parking spaces in the building . 2224895_2227615
and &-um +... 2228715_2229695
there was a sense that it was probably &-um really unrealistic to think of putting lots_of parking up in the building but the idea being that if each building had some parking incorporated within it then there would be less need for grade level grade parking or parking structures . 2231795_2249515
and so that you try to mitigate the problem of parking structures . 2249625_2252485
although you can't possibly provide all the parking that's needed on campus under the building . 2253405_2257405
economically . 2257905_2258185
so that was the thinking and and it quite frankly it was also just a pedagogical tool to force students to confront the difficulty of designing parking within a building . 2259025_2271625
because it really governs what you can do above it and around it . 2272245_2275065
and I think that my question's valid therefore . 2275685_2279605
it's definitely I mean this scheme would definitely change if we had visitor parking . 2277835_2280715
yeah +/.

⌊ and I mean the whole thing ⌋ in you know having lived and worked in LA I mean there's this extraordinary thing where buildings have ground entrances which nobody ever uses . 2282195_2289195

&=laughs .
it would be interesting to see what would happen if we had visitor parking now . 2296695_2299395
so where's the nearest parking lot then ? 2299735_2301775

&-um can can the next group get pinned out please ? 2338005_2343725
somebody can pin up &-um &=recordingrelated_conversation . 2343845_2346445
we have this layering going through . 2458825_2460385
just to walk you through the plans &-um we have parking on our lower level that comes in from this direction . 2461385_2466465
and then we have on the ground floor plane this is the main entrance from either side this would be more of an entrance for the campus as_well_as this being the primary public grand entrance way . 2467665_2481585
&-um as you come in the entrance lobby you have the exhibition space on this side as_well_as the public auditorium space here . 2482625_2490105
this whole zone vertically through all levels is our public zone . 2490785_2494145
&-um as you progress through here we have high bay labs workspaces wood and metal shops and then building support at the very far end . 2495005_2502645
as you go up a level again you have the public auditorium on the second level you have the copy center ITD and then this public zone starts to stretch into the lobby &~sp or the library space excuse_me . 2504305_2514445
and then beyond this we have administration offices . 2514765_2518805
one thing that you notice here is when we start to break these pieces off these four towers house our faculty offices . 2520225_2526725
all the faculty offices will have &-um you know windows lighting natural lighting . 2527305_2532425
and then &-um then ⌈ you see &~th ⌉ . 2534145_2537105
<big luxury luxury> . 2537645_2538925
a &~luxur luxury luxury hotel this is &=laughs:multiple . 2538925_2540305
&-um as you proceed up again you also have the public space here you have the cafe and a student lounge . 2540545_2546225
&-um again you have another level of faculty offices some &-um more public offices like student related activities like &-um +... 2546825_2554505
like AIA those types of spaces . 2556355_2558555
and then again the library which occupies the &~thr these three floors and then you have student classrooms . 2559195_2565155
&-um the next level up again we have the public space here &-um some more offices the third level of faculty offices our library more classrooms and then on the top level you'll find the studio space occupying the the complete right side and then the tops of the towers become the crit@n spaces . 2566935_2584355
&-um with this &-um looking at it structurally we came up with a a bay system and <one thing that's> &~d one thing that's separate from the bay system is the library . 2587165_2597585
there's +//. 2598025_2598425
the library is kind_of unique and this is a perspective inside the library . 2599025_2602205
&-um it becomes three central books stacks with this bridge in the center that you see here in this section where this central part becomes &-uh a Verondale truss that supports it and so there are no there's no columns in there or or structural ties that go to the ceiling or wherever it's a free floating bridge . 2602895_2622615
and then up &~t from there you go up to the studio space and you can see in that model &-um where the +//. 2623515_2630735
&~th that's glued down you have to spin it . 2631055_2633295
&-um where the trusses this is a a close+up detail of the trusses become exposed . 2634755_2639815
and where where the trusses occur &~the the bottom truss occurs on a column line but in &~th where you'd think there would be a a a &~st a steel beam or something in the roof there's nothing it's a glazed skylight to get light into the &-um the studio spaces and those become the circulation points into the studio there's also one that runs along the whole main &-um circulation zone . 2640415_2664915
what we were trying to do with that is we were thinking of the Architecture School not only as a a building that teaches or a not only a building that is used for teaching but it also teaches as a building . 2666465_2678865
it's teaching &-um with our structure . 2679045_2681225
and then one aspect which we &-um have even developed a &~s a second model is this wall right here which we're proposing to be &-um concrete encased with glass on two sides . 2681765_2692725
and then also in our investigation of materials is also another teaching tool that we're using our building for . 2694585_2700925
yeah and we take that into the facade designs where in the facades the main element that runs through it is the concrete . 2701605_2708445
and the concrete ties the three parts of the building the the entry part the main &~s &-um the main core of the program and the towers . 2708725_2717245
but each one's treated a little bit different where this wall is as in the example is encased in glass . 2717905_2723665
&-um the main part of the building is concrete and then <at the> &~sh at the glazing systems &-uh we're proposing a metal grating for sun shading that you can see through but when you're at an angle to it it looks solid . 2724805_2737145
and &~s and so you get this different reading depending on where you're standing . 2737925_2740945
and then in the towers at the office &~s points where the windows are is metal is &-uh wood infill panels . 2741145_2747705
that's +//.
and they start to relate towards the residential zone of the site that's to the west . 2748685_2753645
(0.6) .
can you talk a little bit more about your siting and the decision to leave the houses there and how do you feel like your building responds to those houses ? 2755165_2767925
and also &-um the kind of big space that's in front of your building on the +/. 2768425_2773325
yeah +/. 2774485_2774605
+, east side . 2775085_2775545
oh this ? 2776445_2776825
yeah . 2777285_2777845
well &-um initially we were looking at our building as if we keep these existing buildings currently that for a future proposal you know if these buildings are no longer here the university owned them the campus is gonna start to spread . 2778085_2790725
and then &~tha this gives us the opportunity to start to you know rather than create a wall we're starting to bring the scale down to relate to this but we're also allowing this this possibility of expansion of the university . 2790985_2804005
⌊ <are those> are those ⌋ .

can't be a very nice place to live <with the> traffic . 2815905_2818345
&-um as far as the the space between &-um West Quad and our building when we first started &~w we were interested in creating &-um &~wa a public space that starts to relate back to the Diag and areas of the campus . 2819305_2833705
and with West Quad and South Quad right here &~tr <as a> as a way to try to get the freshmen and the sophomores that live here to use this space and even go into the school and use the library and the computers . 2833905_2845465
&-uh we were trying to relate our building back to this with a &~s <a &~f> a &~f <not a> not a formal space but kind_of an informal gathering type space where in the winter the freshmen or whatever go out and have snowball fights and it +//. 2846025_2859465

(0.4) .
did you look <at the> &-um at the entrance to the lobby ? 2865605_2872245
you've got this very large enclosure outside the building and then inside you've got almost the well you've got a bigger area inside for circulation and lobbies at all levels . 2872225_2881065

good job . 4111055_4111075
thank you .
thanks &=unintelligible_conversation .
so this is the North Campus +... 4122405_4123505
that's the bell tower the Media Union +... 4125765_4127785
and I chose to locate the new building on the slope the north side of what I see could become a larger public space for North Campus . 4128505_4139945
and +... 4140345_4142225
right now the way this works is it kind of bleeds out all over the place . 4143265_4146465
there's nothing up here there's some trees on the hillside and so what I decided to do was to try and not close it off but to extend it . 4146425_4152945
and so this public space would grow &~m maybe towards the Music School . 4153165_4156805
there's water over here . 4157025_4158005
and there's a nice forest so part of the strategy would be to bring that terrain in smooth out the contour where the parking lot is +/. 4158305_4166845
oh +/.
+, maybe grab on to part of the bell tower and leave this lower spot +... 4168285_4171485
maybe like a little rough park or maybe even it could have some some water in it . 4172835_4177255
but the road is still there ⌈ <Murfin's still there> ⌉ . 4177495_4178595
⌊ the road's there ⌋ . 4178595_4179695
this is Bonisteel and that's that corner so +... 4181215_4184875
what this is is parking and mechanical . 4185775_4188755
and that +//. 4189375_4189535
so that's an extension of the building and coming down Murfin I think that threshold would be the new entrance to North Campus . 4189635_4194995
so it wouldn't be a bleeding edge it would basically be a sort_of &-um an announcement . 4195725_4201485
and that's in this location so that's Murfin . 4202885_4206085
this is north . 4206185_4206705
this is the building . 4206965_4207425
and this is heavily wooded . 4207585_4208525
there's dormitories over here so there's a_lot_of foot traffic that way . 4209005_4211965
and right now there's a path that kind of crosses right at right across this roof to the engineering building . 4212725_4218125
and the engineering building's a real destination that's here because there's a huge atrium in there . 4218805_4223865
and a_lot_of students go over there and hang out and eat food and stuff so I basically rerouted that . 4223665_4228685
the concept here is to to to take all of the traffic from that side of campus and route it through the building this way and anyone coming that way would come through here . 4229065_4237485
so there's kind_of a public zone in this middle level on that gray sheet of chip board that's kind_of the most public accessible part of the building . 4237825_4247005
and if someone were to come to the building from the grade level which is right now the parking level so that would be this lower public enlarged courtyard they would come in underneath and slip under that public space . 4248105_4261105
and and I added some program for the North Campus site I added a bookstore and and what could probably double function as library and there was a cafe in the program so that's all on that lowest level . 4261425_4272225
and from there you you come up through that's here and through there this cavity here is a double height open to the sky void . 4272745_4283365
that comes straight through the that middle layer . 4284065_4287585
and that gives light to the offices on that level . 4288565_4290465
so you'd come up the stairs here and that would bring you right into this central <what I call the> gathering space and that would intersect your path with whoever was coming through the building the other way and that's basically the heart of the building . 4290705_4306665
in section that's here . 4307125_4309825
and it's kind_of a it's kind_of a jogged space and here so it it sort of does that but it's continuous . 4311105_4319605
so once you're in that space you the &~r the studio is above your head and it's ramping and the offices are off to either the left or right which would be &-um this is the office plate . 4320045_4332465
there's some offices in there which are kind of temporary thirty quarter partition sorts things ⌈ not +//. 4332825_4337765
yes ? 4338485_4338885
louder ⌉ . 4339405_4339905
⌊ Dale you need to talk xxx (be)cause you're just speaking to three people here ⌋ . 4340145_4342845
okay . 4343405_4343625
so on that level &-um +... 4345405_4349025
you can either stay as a public person and be part of the college &-um or <you can> you can get up on a stair that's at either end and that's the ramping studio space . 4349145_4361445
so the studio connects the bottom part of the program to the top part of the program . 4362025_4366545
where is the studio in this ? 4367165_4368065
okay this . 4368365_4368905
it's here on this level right ? 4369125_4371005
that's a tough not exactly (be)cause that level's continuous it slopes down here and then it goes ⌈ down there ⌉ . 4371605_4376545
⌊ so this is ⌋ studio ? 4376545_4377205
yep . 4377625_4377825
and that's studio ? 4377985_4378865
yep . 4379205_4379425
and that's studio ? 4379605_4380405
&-uh &~b only up to here . 4380965_4381985
and then it turns into a double height space . 4382605_4385325
at this end is +... 4385945_4386725
&-um workshops research big void stuff at this end each of these little knobs has faculty offices and on this perimeter are classrooms and research cubicles . 4388105_4400885
so basically <this is> this is the space of the building which is kind_of a &~non it's a space that's a nonspace and all the enclosure inside well the perimeter enclosure like the weather enclosure is is glazed but all this stuff inside is meant to be seen as temporary or movable or flexible or +... 4401585_4421005
so in the plan in that middle space there's &-um there's access to an auditorium and that auditorium &~c is sort_of half in the ground and half out_of the ground and thirty quarters of its shell protrudes into the gathering space right there +... 4423665_4439945
but the +//. 4441345_4441765
it sort of the lowest point like at the bottom of the seats is is at the same level as the cafe . 4442325_4447905
but you don't know that . 4448605_4449345
it's separated in plan but that's why it's shown here . 4450245_4452765
so going up from . 4454845_4456065
is that important ? 4456125_4456685
well I think it's in for me in thinking about how a person would understand the building it's it's through some kind of memory basically I mean I don't think it lends itself necessarily to program here program there and a little diagram . 4457385_4472225
so I think being in the +//. 4473165_4475765
coming up from the cafe let's say you were to come up from here and then go down into the auditorium you would remember . 4475765_4481745
so you would make the the public association . 4482665_4484305
that was the idea anyways . 4486285_4487485
&-um so the studio's a ramp <it's the part of the> it's the part of the building that has that connects the two sort_of horizontal spaces so this is a flat plate and a flat plate but the studio is like a parking +... 4488985_4502025

or it's it . 4506205_4506765
all the way around . 4506825_4507545
so how do the desks sit on that ? 4507785_4509065
well somebody asked the question the other day +/. 4509105_4510485

⌊ <it uses> ⌋ flat spaces . 4527845_4528385
yeah . 4528425_4528625
you know roughly equal to whatever you know thirteen sixteen students would be . 4530875_4535935
these are thirty foot bays so but I'm seeing this as totally flexible like the question of what is a studio came up for me right away . 4537075_4544315
I mean for me the &~p the possibility that the studio's not the end of the line . 4544575_4549095
but it is the line was was the point I mean so you'd you'd know what the students were doing by walking past them . 4549295_4557375
and ⌈ to go ⌉ . 4558445_4559645
⌊ is this ⌋ wait there this is studio obviously +/. 4559865_4561465

where is your studio below ? 4563185_4564425
on this level here ? 4564845_4566205
oh this this is studio right here . 4566865_4569285
this is studio . 4570305_4571005

this is . 4572445_4572745
this is all this is studio and that's studio ? 4572885_4574645

⌊ this part ⌋ is . 4576485_4577265
that part is flat . 4577565_4578145

except for this part which is atop of the auditorium which is sloped . 4591345_4595045
so it's not a it's not a continuously flat surface . 4595385_4598985

in this part of that upper this . 4658505_4660245
faculty .
yeah and then high bay at the end and back here in the site . 4661025_4664485
why <is there> a crosssection ?
well that's what these are they're a little light but you that's &-um right there is that is this hallway and that's one of these cutins@n seen there . 4667305_4679425
that's that hallway it's a double this part of the faculty is double layer of offices and that kind of references the high bay space . 4680085_4690405
so the delivery is here right ? 4691065_4692885
⌈ and and there's a parking ⌉ . 4693285_4694125
⌊ that's is that high bay ⌋ space on the back at grade ? 4694105_4695865
yeah .
except for a &~l it's partially sunk to kind_of deal with the building next door that it it's four stories high but it's only got two rows of windows so it looks like two stories . 4697145_4709065
so that that's the high bay space there and it gets some indirect light not superstrong direct light but there's a parking lot right here on this side of the sheet existing . 4710485_4722745
so I figure that the trucks will come that way . 4723545_4725985
&-um .
xxx .
why ? 4727905_4730505
well +... 4731145_4732505
more than what I said previously or &~d was it not I'm not sure . 4734315_4739235
&~w was it simply to take advantage of the circulation of the students coming from the dormitories to engineering ? 4739515_4744235
no . 4744535_4744815
well +... 4745395_4746595

⌈ maybe I missed it ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ the idea that this ⌋ is &-um this space here is becoming more completed and extended +/. 4763405_4768905
+, yeah +/.
+, because the building's on that edge rather than this edge which would close it off . 4769585_4773805
and so this edge which is right now &~l loose is more of a threshold because of that situation . 4774705_4782845
thank you .
I know I should understand this but I don't . 4786485_4789805
if I'm coming from the parking in the dorms through the building I go down these steps .
yep +/. 4793115_4793175
+, do I have to go through a door ? 4793575_4794515
well originally there was no door whatsoever but now there's doors . 4795735_4800595
but they're meant to be able to +/. 4801135_4802235
⌈ <both backwards and forwards> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to be open ⌋ yeah meant to be open when especially when the weather's nice . 4803135_4808555
so when the weather's nice they're they're sort_of disappearing walls . 4809775_4812335
yeah +/. 4812435_4812595
+, and when the weather's inclement they're &-uh keep the weather out but still let the . 4813025_4817325
right . 4817765_4817965
that's the idea . 4818925_4819445
so <one of> one of the big things here is that I I &~s I sense that although this space is nice &~cu in its size and it it's basically pretty functional it's &-um it's not flexible . 4820345_4832985
and so I think as programs change and the studio grows it can shrink down the ramp or grow up the ramp and continue and if there's +... 4833265_4841725
you know some faculty who wanna be close to the studio well you put (th)em in the last knob . 4842325_4847105
and if they wanna be closer to research you put (th)em in the knob next to and the idea of the courtyards is that it's a little more introspective space they look out on it they get some sunlight +/. 4847565_4856845
right +/.
+, so this is a double loaded corridor but each wall is its perimeter wall . 4857965_4861885
can you put it back together ? 4862505_4863465
yeah yeah sorry . 4863745_4865765
I know that's a little it's taken some knocks in the last couple days (0.4) . 4865985_4869425
that's why you should always build two models . 4873515_4875155
one for the first jury and one for the second jury . 4875395_4877495
&=laughs yeah okay +... 4877695_4879455
okay so the other thing is that the studio although it's you know sort_of sectionally isolated &-um +... 4880995_4893035
oh the other thing is there's an elevator here so that bridge goes to the workshop so you can short circuit all of this from this level to any level . 4895805_4903685
and this is a stair back in here which short circuits everything . 4904945_4908265
&-um one of the things is that &-uh &~th since this is a south facing broad surface it seemed like a good opportunity to let the students get out on there so they can get out there . 4910465_4922185
there's a stair right there and they can just cruise down and be on there and similarly get off . 4922365_4927905
originally I had it so you could get on all of the roof but I've sort_of removed that possibility . 4929385_4934485
so it's &~p it's pretty much just there now . 4936425_4938105
which roofs can you get on ? 4938385_4939585
just this one . 4940465_4941505
just that one . 4941665_4942305
and underneath that roof is what ? 4943965_4947765
it's +/.
+, administration ? 4948005_4948465
it's the college . 4948865_4949465
so there's . 4950555_4951215
the dean and all that sort of thing . 4951575_4952455
those types . 4952575_4953235
and that's show me that in the plan again is that the bottom plan ? 4953675_4956515

yeah +/.
+, the other time I tried to take care of that one of the things that this is on there is it goes all the way down to this level and so that's meant to light the rooms that are here . 4986165_4997725
so that's where your column is xxx . 4998465_4999585

but what lights the offices to left these offices ? 5004825_5007305
well I'm thinking that it's this . 5009595_5011475

I mean a_lot_of the schemes have actually not had windows in a_lot_of the rooms +/. 5041805_5044585
&-uh yeah +/.
+, but I would look at it a different way which is &-um or this is kind_of different than what you have right now but I think it would be interesting (be)cause I really like the siting actually . 5044945_5053725
I like it because first of all I think that edge where where it's really a drastic incline when you actually are in that space it's it's pretty it it's the one thing that kind of +//. 5054425_5063805
I feel like that that natural slope is what makes that quad more than any of the buildings around it I think to capitalize on that as a siting of a building is interesting . 5064025_5071985
but I really like it more because I guess I always wondered why given how beautiful the landscape is around here why North Campus didn't develop in a more kind of &-um you know campus in a park kind_of idea . 5072145_5085285
it seems like it would have been &-uh &-uh &-uh natural you know to kind_of have thought about it that way so I like the idea of bringing in the kind of &-um landscaped area of the Music School and the kind of existing these tall stands of trees that that are there into the site given that &-uh it's a little bit different than this . 5085585_5104245
but I'm just sort of remarking on Jane's comment which is that given that I could imagine that the building could have spread out itself a little bit more or that landscape could have actually woven through some of these spaces in the building and let the building actually spread out a little bit more so_that it was actually fully integrated as a building as_well_as as a siting strategy in this idea of of &-uh building a building within kind_of a more forced and a more treed landscape . 5104215_5130275
so you think pulling it apart in this direction ? 5130475_5131155
yeah .
yeah having these kind of pull apart a little bit more and thinking about the trees moving through and then +/. 5132305_5136325
mhm +/.
+, having a broad swath right down here in the quad I think that could be a really nice and that would just be pulling that idea into the the development of the building . 5136785_5143885
that's something that that it's certainly clear that this scheme touches on is that &~y it's almost not a building it's just a series of like strata of land that goes across and everything's clear . 5144445_5156365
but it's almost as if you could really begin to explore that in in one of the ways she's talking about pulling pulling that away to bring the land through the middle . 5156815_5165515
I'm also wondering in terms of of +//. 5166395_5168335

⌊ it could be ⌋ bigger and then that would . 5192795_5193995

or or the idea that the walls why not all the walls be something that could in fact &-uh you know if you staggered the glass they could all slide in together and have large areas of outdoor space . 5196095_5207495
so that it almost becomes +/. 5207755_5208915

I guess there was one other +//. 5218145_5219205
about the horizontal plates there was one other issue that I'd forgot to mention . 5219425_5224545
that I was trying to get at which is in this building &-um and in a_lot_of buildings <all the> &~ar all the architecture's basically in the ceiling . 5225405_5231185
and the floor is kind_of the thing you beat on mercilessly . 5231885_5235105
and ⌈ what ⌉ +/. 5235985_5236485
⌊ oh you ⌋ mean top ? 5236505_5236685
+, yeah . 5236945_5237345
and what I was thinking would be the difference in this scheme and the +//. 5238265_5242025
one of the reasons is the landscape +//. 5242345_5243785
was that &~a as a surface was kind_of the beginning thinking about this +... 5244725_5248805
but &~th all the architecture in this building's just in the ceiling and it's just gentle curvature and so there's no there's nothing there except the most minimal light in all the service is in the floor . 5249905_5260265
so in in there and whatever you can get in the ramp and in here and so the the floor is hollow and has tracks and you know you plug in your computer or whatever you need and it's totally so &~th that &~le that allows for what you're saying &-uh &~i actually because you can put whatever you want in there . 5260935_5280675
but in terms of the horizontal I don't know I I suppose it could be all the pieces could be and then it I sort_of wanted to &~com well if everything was horizontal and you just moved in the section I mean each plate then it would be totally the same as all the other buildings on campus except without the skin . 5280765_5304345
without the what ?
without their &~s their &~s external brick skin . 5306245_5308465
(be)cause it's I think Teresa was saying earlier that these buildings are all monsters with +/. 5309305_5313365
yeah +/.
+, big space inside but the skin on the outside and one of the things that I wanted to do is basically stay away from that . 5313685_5320725
and so that you you can see the space literally without its skin and then the other thing was &-um all these buildings are pretty deeply and complexly linked into the ground actually exactly the same as this . 5321725_5334405
they just don't show it . 5334745_5335525

yeah . 5360155_5360375
yeah you really want all those skins to slide past one another . 5362395_5365795
which makes me feel like they could be separated . 5366215_5367875

actually it's pretty interesting (be)cause one of the things about the section that I tried to get at was that it +//. 5386115_5390275
this void doesn't just drop straight in but it kind of jogs over and this vertical circulation does the same thing and always sort_of jogs over but that would be the exact same logic . 5390415_5402435
even the the skin would be something that would kind_of move over and &=sound_effect and open up so that that would actually be similar . 5403295_5410895
(0.5) .
is is there a swale like that or are you creating it entirely ? 5416225_5418825

it's +//. 5435245_5436665
up to the corner of Hayward and Murfin is about eighty feet I think so this is it still rises some . 5436945_5445165
well &~d you've said a number of things which have triggered things in my mind but I I can't quite put it together into a comment +/. 5445385_5450965
&=laughs ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so let me ⌋ just let me be episodic . 5451625_5453305
I &~me &~w one of the things that is happening in higher tech buildings be they office buildings or maybe architecture schools is that there's a is a movement toward services in floors . 5453985_5463205
you know &-um &-um support floors that have not only cable and conduit but they also have duct work and that the registers are no longer these things but they're literally things that come up as part of the furniture . 5463825_5476285
so you could have just the amount of ventilation and cooling and heating that you want . 5477385_5481245
it may even come out_of your computer . 5481805_5482885
I mean it's happened . 5483845_5485005
+, yeah +/.
+, and so so you're quite right in saying that the floor is becoming more latent . 5485785_5491485
and thick . 5492585_5493105
at the same time the &~r the roof still hasta span . 5494405_5496965
+, right +/.
+, so . 5498265_5498465
it's not paper thin . 5499105_5499885
it's not paper thin +/. 5500005_5500785
yeah +/.
+, or or if it &~i if you want it to be paper thin it could be but then it has implications for how often it's supported and and a whole bunch of things . 5501025_5508125
so <if you> if you wanna say okay the floor is gonna be this fat thing which sort_of sits on the grade there is this natural grade and more or less what I'm doing is I'm putting really smart floors on it . 5508425_5518985
and then I'm gonna put these really thin roofs because they can be really thin that can be +//. 5520435_5524595
strikes me as a wonderful conceit on which to start a project on . 5524935_5528495
maybe you're doing that . 5528915_5529535
I'm not a whole a hundred percent sure . 5529735_5531435
but but then you'd hafta make sure from the structural point of view that the the roof forms are such that they can be that thin thing so you can read them you know in the way you're wanting us to read them . 5532315_5542535
so that those windows . 5543295_5545035
and I believe you can do that but but I think that maybe the column spacing ⌈ and some of the other things you're gonna ⌉ . 5545315_5550275

+, it's not but one of the things that &-um now that it's come up is this main system of supports is this broad kind of flat pier sort_of things and that I think will make the interior seem like it's got this long space to it . 5563575_5579555

around the openings and and things like that and that's that's the real I think . 5590915_5596515
now in terms of the thickness . 5596735_5597895

the last project . 6023215_6023855
oh alright +/.
+, and it's light outside still +... 6023995_6025735
&-um we chose the Central Campus site . 6025975_6030175
&-um mainly thinking about what a studio was . 6031175_6033855
and &-uh we decided that this is what an architecture school is the studio is the heart and the soul and we wanted to represent that . 6034235_6041115
&-um so considering it as a jewel we wanted to sort_of show it off in a_lot_of ways and we started thinking about it as something which should be sheltered within a wrapper . 6041525_6050665
and then we wanted to expose it a little bit more . 6050865_6052685
and start to show it off and have it break through the wrapper in a_lot_of ways . 6053205_6055905
so &-um we ended up with the studio at the heart of the building with a strong wrapper on the edge of the site . 6056505_6062005
which &-uh breaks in certain parts . 6063325_6065445
with &~th where this site is Central Campus downtown in kind of more student sections the way the wrapper breaks to show off the studio occurs in different manners depending on which side of the studio it breaks through . 6066275_6080375
we really saw the idea as the studio as the heart of the Architecture School and the idea that this is where almost everything is created it's a construction base &-um it's where ideas are formed and it's also &-um really the intellectual hub of the Architecture School itself it's where most things happen most +//. 6080905_6096285
all hours of the day and really for most architecture students the focus of their academic life &-um as Tara said we were talking about the idea of a core with the studio in the center and that there would be this wrapper . 6096685_6108125
and part of this choosing the &-um downtown site was the idea that it was a somewhat more urban condition . 6108585_6113745
and we did take a fairly &-um I &~me I don't want to use the word harsh but +/. 6113925_6119625
defensive ? 6120365_6120605
+, defensive scheme against the rest of the city in the sense that we are really trying to use our site as a gateway for the rest of campus and we did close off this street from the main reason &~t as we saw this as one of the major elements for +//. 6120685_6134265
both vehicular traffic and pedestrian traffic and we really wanted to use that and to exemplify the site and have this really be a gateway to the corner of campus . 6134475_6142255
&-um .
and you also &-um are building on a plinth ? 6144015_6146375
we are also building on a plinth . 6146395_6147655
we are raising it up so that the building sits above &-um we'll explain later this will be used as public space as cafe as an expansion of the cafe out along the boulevard . 6147795_6157455
&-um starting with basic organization &-um when we had the studio as the core we started to break away slowly at the idea of +//. 6158345_6167765
&-um the site started to become involved . 6168125_6169765
and we really saw the studio as the core and also the auditorium as the core of the public space . 6170045_6175265
and so that's what's represented by the two Plexiblocks that this would &~b this is the studio and this is the auditorium . 6175465_6182185
this is a constant wrapper that &-um is part of the mechanism that we used for the site and part of the urban conditions and the studio and the auditorium are treated in somewhat different manners due to their function but in similar ideas and consideration to what happens to the wrapper that can +//. 6182635_6199755
that holds all of the functions of the building . 6200055_6202095
&-um this we have a central courtyard area external for public domain it really serves as the entry sequence you can see it in that perspective there +... 6203545_6215145
front door if this is Madison coming straight through . 6216145_6218625
this is one of the breaks of the arm . 6219625_6220785
you basically slowly this this site slopes down about sixteen feet from the back corner down to the bottom of the plinth so you would walk up a slow slight flight of steps or you would &~wal use the &-um handicap ramp and you'd be coming to the central atrium . 6221505_6236225
and in the central atrium space before you enter the building it's about the idea of . 6236605_6240405
it's not an atrium . 6241005_6242265
courtyard .
⌊ it's a courtyard excuse_me ⌋ . 6242765_6243825
⌈ it's outside ⌉ . 6243885_6243945
+, sorry I apologize . 6244305_6245005
&-um it's the idea of visual penetration into the idea of the studio . 6245485_6250145
the idea that you can see into the studio and all the services wrap around the studio so that you have constant visual interaction with the studio and the other public places in the building and Tara will talk about the break between the school and the public . 6250465_6264205
&-um being that we we blocked off the street we used that as our major entrance into the building so as you come through up you enter right at the knuckle where there's a central stair and you +//. 6265205_6275685
and we broke down the program into basically public and private functions . 6276005_6278205
where cafe exhibition and auditorium are on this end the more public functions and then all the classrooms studios at the center offices things that have more to do with the private functions of the building are to the other direction . 6278885_6290985
&-um but you always maintain this visual contact back and forth the courtyard through the glazed exterior . 6291365_6296885
you know back into the studio it's always you know something you have to acknowledge . 6297305_6300345
as you move through the building &-um we wanted to keep the studio as its own jeweled element but still have connections through it so you don't walk through it really but you sort_of pass through it over a catwalk and there are visual well there are actually &-um +... 6301125_6316725
little shafts through the building so you walk down a catwalk like penetrating the studio and you can always penetrate through it . 6318125_6324125
so you you're always mixing with it . 6324725_6326425
and the way that the program is broken down &-um with the classrooms and the offices they all sort_of open out into this courtyard . 6326765_6332845
the circulation goes all the way around and then through . 6333105_6336025
so you're always acknowledging the studio and the happenings of the studio the presence of the Architecture School . 6336265_6340845
&-um to complement the idea of the courtyard we also have an internal void &-um that is on the other side of the studio that allows for light in the inner core of the building &~a +/. 6341245_6349345
<this one> +/.
+, right there in the section and also &-um gives it a gives the Architecture School its own private courtyard as well the public so that there's that duality between the two &-um all the &~studi these are the two catwalks the studios open up into this &-um interior atrium space and &-um the &~f . 6351385_6369065

⌈ the roof is ⌉ unresolved . 6376865_6377925
the roof is unresolved . 6378445_6379065
it's gonna be like a skyline . 6379065_6380305
it'll work if that's the intended line . 6380645_6383545
the intended line is something like this . 6383765_6385465
we have ideas of the fact that it would float from either side so that it wouldn't be a &~v so it wouldn't be a harsh visual connection . 6385605_6390985
and there's also the idea that if it was coming from either side that there would be some venting to allow for crossventilation across the studios as for &-um open air systems . 6391605_6400705
but it is not a resolved element . 6401105_6402505
so basically it's open the studio is open to all sides and then classrooms and such get closed off around it . 6402705_6407305
so it becomes this open core . 6407945_6409945
the entire way through . 6410485_6411125
in terms of organizational structure &-um the eastern wing is primarily offices all of our offices have opening windows and have natural daylight . 6412065_6422045

the next thing we wanna talk about is the way the studio acts within the wrapper &-um we've already talked about how it's exposed visually through the open courtyard and from the atrium on the &-um vehicular facade where we took this urban scheme the studio actually punches through as a display of the interactions of the Architecture School <at a> &~l at a larger scale &-um . 6438415_6462735
more formally . 6463495_6463975
yeah it's more formal . 6464415_6465295
&-um basically the actual volume of the studio would puncture through the hard edge and be exposed to the street . 6465855_6474875
the idea that there would be a couple studios and in the center would be crit@n spaces &-um the catwalks get to look down over these crit@n spaces so you have visual interaction from different levels . 6475355_6485675
it's <the whole> &~m the whole part the whole scheme about this jewel is that you you see it in many different lights . 6486555_6492075
