model which &-uh we started talking about last time (0.5) so the idea is to &-uh to bring in &-uh the world economy +... 995_14315
after I finish this &-uh I wanna start talking about what's called the Static Neoclassical Model . 17155_21615
and then next time I wanna begin working on the second page of roman numeral one . 22965_30565
so on the second page there's an article <on the> &~m on the &-uh Multiplier Accelerator Model that's really what the first problem in the problem set is about . 31845_38205
&-uh on Thursday I want to &-uh talk about the Lucas Model which has a paper and a little bit of reading in the textbook . 39585_47385
and then &-uh next week on Tuesday I wanna spend one lecture on the Phillip's Curve there's a handout on that there's a little bit of reading in the textbook &-uh that introduces some ideas about differential equations and then &-uh next Thursday I wanna finish up talking about the Dornbusch Model which is an elaboration on the Mundell_Flemming Model +... 48325_68125
alright . 69125_71225
so we had new behavioral functions (0.5) &-uh last time &=writes:board we used these stars for desired we had &-uh desired net exports +... 72005_88805
and they were gonna depend on the home real GDP on the foreign GDP and on the real interest rate +... 92405_98885
let me just signify the signs of the partial derivatives by putting a sign here . 102285_106485
partial derivative with respect to the first argument was gonna be negative positive positive by &~as these were assumptions . 107565_113845
second new behavioral functions behavioral function I want CF star to be real &-uh desired net foreign financial investment in the US . 115305_130305
&=pause_while_writing so we'd started talking about this last time (0.5) let me write it like that with two arguments depends on the home nominal interest rate depends on the sum of the foreign nominal interest rate and the &-uh I did this wrong it should depend on the sum of the foreign nominal interest rate and the &-uh anticipated &-uh rate of change in E . 136325_166305
the nominal exchange rate . 168165_169345
so dot means time derivative . 170405_171725
E dot over E is like the percentage rate of change in E in the nominal exchange rate . 173365_179145
use the A for anticipator . 180285_182785
alright . 184085_184325
the &~as the assumptions I wanna make here are that the &-uh +... 186005_190325
that the sign here is negative and here is positive +... 192865_195365
let me talk for a minute though about this . 198305_200485
so we're talking about financial investment . 202345_204125
so you can &-uh take your &-uh dollar saving put it in a savings bank in the US or you could send it over to England . 205885_212845
if &~y if you took your dollar +... 213725_215125
and +... 228145_228165
invested it put it in the bank at home after a brief amount of time say delta it would grow to one dollar plus the interest rate which is yearly +//.
which is given in terms of of &-uh percentage change per year it's an annual rate times the amount of time that you've had so maybe you've &-uh put it in the bank for one day you've got one three hundred and sixty fifth of the yearly interest . 235135_255895
so you'd have this plus interest after this amount of time delta . 256775_260995
another possibility is you could take your dollar and &-uh send it abroad +... 262235_266615
now +... 268035_271895
remember the units on E are &-uh dollars per pound the foreign currency is a pound . 275515_283935
if I send it abroad I've got my dollar I'll get this many pounds for it . 285425_292305
if there's two dollars to a pound E'll be two and my dollar'll buy half a pound . 294205_299465
that'll be the number of pounds . 302005_303265
&=pause_while_writing those pounds will grow with interest now it's abroad the money's abroad so you get the foreign rate of interest and then when I bring (th)em home I'll get this many dollars . 310015_326315
⌈ question ⌉ ? 327535_327575
⌊ I thought ⌋ this foreign investment is it investment that investment into the domestic economy or ⌈ out_of ⌉ . 327575_333175
⌊ it's into ⌋ the US . 333175_333855
so shouldn't partials be +//. 334115_335415
have opposite signs ? 335795_336635
ah you're right . 337825_338605
I got (th)em backwards . 339985_340525
so when the interest rate at home is high it's attractive so it comes in . 341205_343885
good +...
thanks +...
so I I took my dollar it bought this many pounds grew with interest to this many pounds multiply it by this I'll get dollars . 345805_358625
the time is different by then if I started at time T it's now time T plus delta . 359505_365345
I can put a T on this one +... 366485_367685
alright . 369385_371165
well let's think about this for a minute . 371825_373825
&=pause_while_writing if &-uh E changes smoothly as a function of time I could make a first order approximation a first order Taylor series approximation of ET plus delta . 383385_395545
it would be E at time T &-uh plus the derivative with respect to time times that . 396205_409425
so it's like &-uh I've got a function of time +... 409785_415225
and I'm approximating it +... 418925_420505
like that with a first order Taylor series approximation . 422085_426585
so this is a function of time through its subscript there and I made a first order approximation . 427505_435045
if the thing is smooth and I'm talking about a small delta this would be a good approximation very good approximation +... 436025_442185
well then we could multiply this out so it's +... 446425_450465
we've got one times E we've got &-uh one times this thing E dot time derivative times delta . 453545_461285
we've got this times delta times E and we've got this times this . 462525_467665
&=pause_while_writing it's an order of magnitude smaller still and <I can> I can afford to ignore it if I'm letting the delta get very small +... 469045_488825
let's do that let's drop it now I've got one over E times each of these terms one over E times E is just one this thing is E dot over E times delta this thing is &-uh again the e@l-s cancel so it's just RF times delta . 492975_515015
so when I wanna compare investing at home to investing abroad both terms have got this one the results of both got this one in them . 517945_528985
investing at home has R times delta this one has RF plus E dot over E times delta . 530905_538325
so the comparison that I wanna make is between R and RF plus E dot over E . 539145_544765
and those are the two arguments here . 545625_546945
and as was pointed out we're talking about &~n net foreign financial investment in the US when the interest rate in the US is is higher that's gonna be attractive that's gonna pull money in financing in when &-uh RF plus &-uh E dot over E is high that'll take it out . 549285_566965
remember the way I've defined this exchange rate when this goes up the dollar is devalued . 568645_574765
if this is positive it's +//. 576225_578565
it means I'm expecting the dollar to lose value . 578745_580685
so <if the> if the interest rate in England is &-uh four percent but I'm expecting the dollar to be devalued by six percent I could have a ten percent return if I invested my money over there . 581665_592105
(be)cause if the dollar is gonna lose value I wanna be in town so bring it back &-uh bring my funds back later after the dollar's lost value +... 593375_600895
alright .
and in fact in the Mundell_Flemming Model we make the assumption that foreign financial investments and American financial investments are perfect substitutes so that all the funding goes where the interest return is highest . 605555_622175
so the Mundell_Flemming Model &-uh assumes that financial investments are perfect substitutes +... 622875_630435
and so we have the extreme case that if the home interest rate is higher +... 634235_639035
&-uh including the anticipated &-uh currency changes then there's a huge flow in if both interest rates are the same &=pause_while_writing then people don't care where they invest their money it's a matter of indifference and if +... 642475_671335
the home interest rate is lower (0.5) then all the money goes abroad . 675515_683415
so CF is inflow so it'd be negative infinity . 684355_687535
so this is like the purchasing power parity case now applied not to goods but to &-uh financial investments . 689015_696135
and that's that's the idea of the Mundell_Flemming Model . 698055_700395
&=pause_while_erasing okay questions about that ? 712705_713825
yeah .
what happens when the expectations are heterogeneous ? 715185_717445
if &-uh this announces that I'm going to at this point is &-uh simpler than that it's as if everybody has common expectations if they're different it'll be more complicated . 718685_730005
if you think the return abroad is better you'll be investing there if I think the return at home is better I'll be investing here then &-uh &-uh the model becomes more complicated and we hafta worry about how much heterogeneity there is and who's thinking what . 730665_745165
but it's simpler than that I'm assuming everybody has a point estimate the same one of &-uh E dot over E . 746065_750405
so that would be A ? 751245_752265
over E .
yeah I made it A I used to use E . 752785_755505
so I meant A for anticipated . 755845_757685
because this to know how the &-uh exchange rate is gonna change I hafta think ahead . 758925_763905
remember the derivative +... 764825_765545
&=writes:board remember it's a limit like this . 769905_773445
I gotta be able to think ahead a little bit . 775345_777765
and I so I'm I'm putting an anticipation on that . 778605_780945
we'll come to expectations &-uh pretty soon next week +... 782525_784805
how we might wanna model those . 789195_790475
(0.5) okay ? 791635_796655
so the superscript there is for anticipated . 796895_799615
other questions +..? 800475_801135
alright .
well let me put the Mundell_Flemming Model together then . 802055_806975
we've got it's basically &~h has the pieces of the model I've been talking about the ISLM Model plus these two new behavioral functions +... 807255_814595
so the &-uh &=pause_while_writing so the Mundell_Flemming Model has &-uh endogenous variables it has &-uh Y R <capital r@l> capital r@l is the real exchange rate R is the home nominal interest rate Y is the home real GDP and +... 817115_847095
exogenous got the whole list that we're used to plus international ones now as well so it's got real transfers from government taxes government spending stock of money at home government bonds private bonds in other words corporate bonds &-uh inflation anticipated home inflation rate price deflater for the home GDP for the foreign one foreign real GDP foreign interest rate +... 854005_883985
real net factor &-uh payments &-uh from abroad to the US and then this anticipated +... 902355_914175
guess I won't put subscripts on it anticipated &-uh &-uh rate at which E is is rising lemme just call that Theta we wanna treat it as a constant let me just write it as a a single thing Theta . 917085_936105
and the model is very similar to the one we've been working with has the following elements +... 936705_944985
question ?
okay . 949185_951045
it has behavioral function same as before . 952025_955505
&=pause_while_writing desired saving oops now we gotta be a little careful . 956625_964825
so we gotta take Y which is factor payments add to it transfer payments plus from government +... 965525_972325
add to it net factor payments from abroad . 975545_977665
so if we're thinking about saving of US citizens they have also these profits and &-uh wages from abroad perhaps +... 979225_988605
there's accounting I equals S plus T minus TR minus G plus CF now remember when we did the last the derived accounting identity looked like that there were three sources of financing &~deve domestic &~invest physical investment private US saving government saving net foreign financial investment ? 992635_1019215
there's gonna be an assumption as before that people can control their savings so that desired and actual saving are the same . 1021415_1030275
there's gonna be a behavioral function that desired physical investment depends on the real interest rate in other words the nominal rate minus the rate of inflation that is the same as before +... 1031475_1045175
&-uh we've got lemme erase this big list of &=sigh variables there . 1048135_1058075
we've got a behavioral function this new one &-uh number two over there the desired net foreign financial investment depends on that but I'm gonna make the Mundell_Flemming assumption +... 1061525_1078765
and it looks like this . 1082665_1083545
&=pause_while_writing so we just talked about that . 1100305_1101645
I'm gonna assume that people can control the amount of net foreign financial investment that they make so that the actual and desired always coincide . 1102845_1113125
I'm gonna have another behavioral function that desired real holdings of domestic currency +... 1114465_1124705
are this and these have the usual assumptions so the partial derivative here of this argument is negative here it's positive this one is positive and negative this one is positive and negative just as it was before +... 1127545_1145145
US citizens don't hold foreign currencies here they just hold domestic . 1147565_1151405
another behavioral assumption number one the new behavioral one NX star desired net &~f exports in real terms we talked about this last time . 1153935_1169895
those partial derivative signs and finally accounting . 1173255_1179235
as we talked about the first day there's the there's a balance of payments accounting equation that looks like this . 1183245_1192925
so if I take exports minus imports plus factor payments in from abroad plus &-uh foreign financial &~in net foreign financial +//. 1195305_1206545
investment those things have gotta sum to zero +... 1206945_1209045
so that was again something we talked about the first day . 1212375_1216355
and the notion of equilibrium . 1217875_1218975
(0.6) we'll say we have an equilibrium . 1222855_1226635
(0.7) if the endogenous variables are such that we're getting the amount the fiscal investment actual is equal to the amount people desired that NX net exports in real terms are equal to the amount people desired and the amount of money people hold is equal to the amount they desire . 1234095_1264075
so if those three things hold +... 1265985_1270085
we already have some other ones by assumption +... 1270545_1276125
but if the endogenous variables are such that these are all satisfied I must say we have an equilibrium . 1279085_1284685
do you sort_of assume that there are flexible exchange rates abroad . 1287225_1290665
I mean because you have nine the balance of payments items ? 1291005_1293325
I'm assuming that this R adjusts and &-uh P and PF are exogenous so I'm assuming that the E implicitly adjusts to make that foreign exchange rate &-uh or to make the foreign exchange market in my picture from the first day balance . 1294115_1313995
so that the inflow and outflow of dollars inflow and outflow of pounds from that foreign exchange market balance . 1314095_1319435
yes +... 1320855_1322015
so there's the model . 1326395_1327195
nine elements three endogenous variables three conditions here for equilibrium . 1328475_1335835
(0.6) alright let me talk about the equilibrium . 1338495_1344615
&=pause_while_erasing quickly +... 1350335_1351255
well for equilibrium one thing that's gonna hafta hold is that R is gonna hafta adjust so that's that's that's true . 1360085_1373365
otherwise this and this are finite if this is plus or minus infinity this is never gonna hold . 1374285_1384505
so &~th because the financial investments are perfect substitutes at home and abroad for equilibrium we're gonna need the interest rate at home to obey this . 1386115_1397355
notice that RF and the Theta are exogenous . 1398735_1402655
second thing . 1404075_1406655
part of the definition of equilibrium is that this be true . 1408455_1411195
once I've got number one . 1413725_1415265
(0.6) for this to hold +... 1416985_1423025
there's only one Y that's gonna work . 1426705_1430085
because I had the assumption that the partial derivative with respect to Y is nonzero M and P are exogenous expression number one fixes R from exogenous things the only variable left the only endogenous variable left in in this equation is Y it's gonna hafta be set by that equation it's gonna hafta adjust to make that equation hold . 1431805_1456905
finally +... 1460995_1461575
these other two are gonna pin down R now capital R +... 1463875_1469235
from this thing plus the definition of equilibrium (0.5) in the definition of equilibrium I star hasta equal I in this thing I hasta equal S but from from number three S hasta be S star . 1472915_1492895
(0.7) and then that plus government saving +... 1501745_1503865
plus CF +... 1509625_1509765
now from number nine CF has gotta equal negative &-uh NX but in equilibrium NX equals NX star &=pause_while_writing and then negative NFP . 1512625_1536125
so I'm gonna need this +... 1537485_1539205
in one I already see for equilibrium that R's gotta be equal to RF plus Theta . 1543385_1548725
from two I can solve for what Y has gotta be for equilibrium so Y is set there . 1549865_1557005
the only thing the only endogenous variable left in equation three is capital R . 1558645_1563465
it'll have to adjust to make three hold . 1564265_1566605
(0.4) three holds from this from the definition of equilibrium from this from nine and again using the definition of equilibrium . 1570215_1583775
so three will determine capital R the real exchange rate . 1586295_1590335
so the model has got all these elements to it +... 1593415_1596495
but it's actually quite simple to solve . 1601305_1604105
yeah .
<I think> I think I think you're missing a star in element four (0.5) . 1606225_1609685
yep . 1611045_1615485
good . 1616065_1616365
thanks . 1617725_1617785
(0.7) okay ? 1624605_1625125
other questions +..? 1625345_1626545
let me draw the picture that's in the book +... 1629555_1631115
before we could characterize equilibrium with an IS and LN curve to find our intersection the book suggests an analogous picture for this model again we're talking about equilibrium here characterizing equilibrium . 1632135_1651395
&=pause_while_writing we've got three endogenous variables it's hard to draw thirty dimensional pictures +... 1658415_1662695
given the Mundell_Flemming assumption +... 1665895_1667275
for equilibrium the interest rate at home is pinned down . 1670235_1673235
so the book suggests using a picture to characterize the values of the other two variables . 1674135_1682055
realizing that R hasta equal RF plus Theta +... 1682915_1685895
so this equation characterizes Y and they call that the LM curve . 1689065_1696325
(0.5) so it's the values of &-uh Y and R such that M over P equals K star of Y and &~l and little R but little R is set exogenously now by conditions in the rest of the world and anticipations about the exchange rate +... 1701585_1721785
so we find the Y that makes this work the equation doesn't depend on capital R therefore once you find that Y it works whatever capital R is so that the locus is just &-uh vertical +... 1724705_1740285
now in this one if we set R from here R is fixed so the left hand side is fixed . 1743725_1751125
the partial derivative of S star was gonna be positive . 1752945_1756385
then your ray of partial derivatives on NX star was gonna be that . 1757405_1762545
so if R little R is fixed this is fixed if we have a Y and a capital R that satisfies equation three . 1763925_1774925
then if we raise Y this'll go up this'll go down but it's subtracted . 1776315_1782395
so the &~chan if Y goes up it'll make the &-uh right hand side go up to counterbalance and and keep equality . 1783355_1791795
here I'll hafta make R go up . 1792155_1793615
so if Y goes up R'll have to go up . 1794375_1796795
so he calls this the IS his IS curve and it's the locus YR such that three holds . 1798785_1810605
(0.12) so such that this works . 1812305_1826665
where R is set at the what's internationally required here &=pause_while_writing so that's an upward sloping curve and then the equilibrium for the model we gotta have both two and three hold is there . 1828145_1858125
(0.9) so whether you use the equations or the picture you're talking about the same thing . 1872835_1877915
we could use our total derivatives to find the slope of the IS curve (0.5) &-uh lemme not take time to do that I'll just write it here +... 1879815_1892655
for a derivative in this picture I want DR over DY +... 1896975_1899215
so I totally differentiate this noting that little R is now constant because of equation one collecting my terms that's the partial of S with respect to its argument minus the partial of NX with respect to its Y argument over the partial of NX with respect to its capital R argument . 1902665_1928485
and by assumption this is positive . 1931025_1933785
this is negative but it's got a negative here so the top is positive the bottom is positive and slope is positive which is the way it worked out &-uh a minute ago . 1934405_1946925
(0.6) so there's the Mundell_Flemming Model <it's a> &~s it's a way to take that familiar Keynesian Model and &-uh make it into a open economy model it's implicitly assuming that the rest of the world is big relative to the home country because &-uh it's treating RF and YF as being fixed . 1954065_1981385
so if we do policy changes or something in the US &-uh you might think they would affect &-uh England if if the world was just the US and England and you might think that RF would change and &-uh we'd hafta take account of that . 1982905_1996845
but if it's the US trading with all the rest of the world and England is just a stand in for all the rest of the world &-uh maybe you'd think the rest of the world is so big that if we change around our government policy or something the world interest rate isn't gonna change so that RF being fixed exogenous is a legitimate assumption . 1997985_2017485
so it's &-uh it's just implicitly assuming that that the US is a small country in the world the small country assumption +... 2018945_2027005
alright .
well lemme quickly run through some &-uh comparative statics with this . 2031545_2039705
&=pause_while_erasing let's &-uh +... 2051695_2052655
first do the case that we have a open market operations let's expand the money supply at home +... 2056675_2062255
by buying +//. 2066015_2066935
having the &-uh federal reserve take currency out_of its vaults and buy US bonds takes US government bonds so it takes the bonds out_of circulation and puts more dollars into circulation +... 2067295_2078935
what's gonna happen ? 2082745_2083645
well let's think for a minute about a story +... 2084365_2087185
so if we start in equilibrium +... 2089405_2090505
&-uh US citizens are the ones that hold dollars &-uh they they have the amount they wanted in their portfolio relative to bonds &-uh now the government wants to induce them to take more so it wants to buy some of their bonds &-uh +... 2091905_2107945
that will tend to &-uh bid up the price of bonds . 2110715_2114635
if the bonds &-uh were originally sold with their face value their expiration date and their coupon printed on them if they become more expensive the &-uh implicit interest rate on those bonds has gone down +... 2116235_2130975
we talked about this before . 2133455_2134275
in the ISLM model when the interest rate goes down it stimulates domestic physical investment spending the little I . 2137105_2143345
here it would do that but far more important it will change &-uh CF +... 2144685_2151365
that's more important because the CF by assumption here is &-uh perfectly interest elastic . 2155865_2163105
if you lower the US interest rate a little bit we were at equilibrium before we were at the world interest rate you lower it a little bit all the financial investment turns around goes the other way and that overwhelms any effects you'd get out_of physical investment +... 2162865_2177585
well if the financial investment is &-uh surging overseas &-uh what is that doing ? 2181235_2191295
it's it's &-uh flooding the foreign exchange markets with dollars as citizens move their &-uh accounts overseas they'll want to change (th)em for pounds . 2191535_2201495
and and by the same token it's gonna create a scarcity in them of of pounds and to try and cope with this &-uh the foreign exchange market's gonna change the exchange rate it's gonna make &-uh &-uh dollars cheaper and pounds more expensive . 2202785_2220085
everybody wants pounds now . 2221205_2222285
but when that happens &-uh by assumption that stimulates net exports . 2223945_2230945
(0.5) but Y is equal to C plus I plus G plus NX here and if you can stimulate NX &-uh you raise Y . 2232125_2246385
and in fact this thing is so interest sensitive that this story works with an infinitesimal an invisible reduction in R it's just an infinitesimal drop is enough to make this whole thing work . 2248185_2265405
and the stimulus now comes not from physical investment C plus I plus G with I changing but from net exports changing . 2266385_2277745
in terms of the picture (0.5) well first we hafta realize that there's there's no change in the domestic interest rate for equilibrium we've gotta have that and RF and Theta haven't changed other than that from the picture we started like this &=pause_while_writing what changes ? 2279265_2309245
the IS curve's position doesn't change there's no M in that nothing exogenous has changed that's in equation three the LM curve does change though . 2314225_2326225
for the same R M went up we need a bigger Y to have &-uh equality in two . 2326745_2332945
so the LM curve shifts +... 2333825_2335345
so the equilibrium shifts like that what happens Y gets bigger this I just tried to say verbally . 2338745_2347465
R the exchange rate the dollar devalues and we have expansionary monetary policy that happens the interest rate doesn't change . 2349125_2357825
the reason Y can get bigger is because when the dollar devalues &-uh it stimulates exports . 2359845_2365325
net exports . 2367725_2368025
(0.5) we could do that algebraically (0.9) we have equation one +... 2369205_2386385
so we can differentiate R with respect to M directly R is just equal to a constant so DR is just zero . 2389105_2395745
so DR DM +... 2397225_2398085
open market is zero +... 2400445_2401805
equation two over there +... 2406265_2407245
we take total derivatives . 2408305_2411605
the P isn't changing . 2412105_2413205
the M is . 2414865_2415625
and we take the partial derivative of M over P with respect to M . 2416545_2419465
that's just one over P on the left hand side . 2419665_2422805
and then on the right hand side we take the partial derivative of K with respect to Y times DY . 2426685_2433825
and we could do the same partial of K with respect to R DR but we just saw that DR doesn't change here from equation one . 2435345_2443905
so we've got this +... 2445875_2446735
so we can &~cr collect terms here we've got DY DM we can flag it +... 2449555_2455015
as you recall what we're talking about here is it's one over P and then over KY star . 2457435_2464555
this partial is positive by assumption this is positive there's a comparative static result +... 2466405_2474145
when we did the closed economy model &-uh last time (0.7) this thing was one over +//. 2478525_2490945
this comparative static result was one over P and then it had a KY but then it had another term KR +... 2491765_2500965
times so partial of K with respect to R times partial of S with respect to Y over partial of little I with respect to R so it was positive but everything else being the same <it was> it was smaller . 2505095_2522815
(be)cause it had the same numerator and the denominator had the same first term but then it had another positive term . 2523735_2529495
so in this Mundell_Flemming Model monetary policy everything else the same becomes more powerful . 2530835_2536595
the the magnitude of the comparative static derivative is bigger . 2538055_2541755
(0.5) and then we could differentiate three lemme just write it let you get +//. 2543195_2552115
you could figure that D capital R DM (0.5) is &-uh where is it ? 2552875_2565015
one over P over KY now &~th over the partial of K with respect to Y times partial of S with respect to Y minus partial of NX with respect to Y over partial of NX with respect to R capital R +... 2565015_2585215
then if you look at that it's positive too . 2588355_2590075
so you can do it algebraically or geometrically . 2590715_2594895
question ? 2596755_2596775
well &-um I'm looking at the yeah number one and it says R equals RF plus Theta +/. 2597415_2603815
yeah +/.
+, now I understand that like that hasta hold at equilibrium and that we're dealing with infinitesimal changes but how do you elicit like the the CF changing so greatly if there's no relative change between R and RF ? 2604355_2616395
it's because that CF because the foreign and &~do and domestic financial assets are perfect substitutes that <if I> if I changed R by any &-uh finite amount &~nonfinitess noninfinitesimal amount &-uh I'd hafta get an infinite change in CF . 2617005_2638705
and that could if I was at equilibrium before I could never be at equilibrium thereafter . 2639705_2644105
but the thing is it's perfectly elastic so it was it had become a correspondence that CF could be anything as long as number one holds . 2645155_2654435
so this is where the story &-uh sorta breaks down . 2656695_2661195
I don't actually need to get any noninfinitesimal change in R just &-uh you could think of it as just going down infinitesimally . 2662635_2670675
but it actually CF is so elastic it actually doesn't even need to change at all +... 2671705_2677625
would the &-uh model also assume that domestic saving is not sensitive to domestic interest rates ? 2680905_2685685
yep . 2686185_2686465
so that you mean &-uh &-uh private savings saving by Americans that s@l star thing depended only on current income flow in this model . 2686825_2697345
so it's only on Y which is interpreted as factor payments in that case plus factor payments from abroad plus transfers from government minus taxes . 2698385_2705965
so it's a very simple model savings behavior only your current flow of &-uh resources &-uh and the interest rates are your interest income is in that it's in the Y but only that determines how much you're saving . 2707145_2723365
so in a more realistic model you might think if the interest rate is higher I'll save more +... 2724065_2728365
but in this model it's it's too simple for that . 2730165_2733325
but we'll come to more elaborate dynamic models later when things like that will matter . 2734525_2737605
so what's the motivation for Y increase in the star xxx when actually there's no increase in R ? 2738285_2744565
because to maintain equilibrium after I've increased M the CF has gotta go down +... 2744975_2752395
and that means there's less &-uh money coming in &-uh and from the &-uh balanced payments accounting identity NX <has gotta> has gotta get bigger and counterbalance that . 2756215_2769715
the NFP is exogenous . 2770355_2771475
so from the balanced payments accounting identity &=writes:board CF plus NFP which isn't changing plus NX has gotta be zero if when M went up &-uh this thing went down to hold equality this thing has gotta go up but that's a part of demand . 2773285_2795365
+, ⌊ (be)cause ⌋ Y is C plus I plus G plus NX . 2796205_2800205
but how can you have a finite decrease of CF ? 2801365_2804285
CF is a correspondence . 2804845_2808305
it's CF star +... 2808845_2811525
&=writes:board it'd be infinite +... 2815385_2816745
if that was true but it can be anything +... 2818765_2822425
people don't care where their money is as long as the interest rate &~h home and abroad are the same . 2826205_2831145
so I can have a change within this interval following monetary policy and the new equilibrium compels that . 2832185_2839385
and once I've changed that in the balanced payments economy identity NX has gotta go up . 2840825_2845625
and the way that that happens is the exchange rate changes to to cause that to happen +... 2846205_2850925
so it'd be a little easier to +//. 2854465_2855785
it would be easier to talk about if I didn't have the Mundell_Flemming's strict &-uh perfect substitutes assumption . 2856225_2862665
so if &-uh &-uh <if the> if the CF thing was not perfectly flat then then we could get small changes here leading through here . 2864385_2876225
but the Mundell_Flemming assumption is it's perfect substitutes that's what makes it a little hard to think about . 2877225_2882005
but that's the idea . 2882805_2883665
are there other questions +..? 2884525_2885225
alright well let's do &-uh fiscal policy . 2888765_2891025
&=pause_while_erasing it's the second comparative static result . 2896365_2899125
let's increase domestic government spending &-uh finance it with &-uh government bonds (0.7) so again we could think about a story it's a little as you can see it's a little dangerous to think about these stories &=laughs:multiple &-um sometimes they help to have &~int to establish intuition . 2902075_2932055
&-uh increased government spending +... 2933585_2934705
Y is equal to C plus I plus G plus NX so if G goes up that will tend to make Y go up . 2937465_2942985
if Y goes up people are making more transactions domestic transactions so k@l star should go up +... 2943585_2953725
&=writes:board if k@l star goes up &-uh people want more real money balances &-uh +... 2957645_2966185
but the real money supply hasn't changed so we all try to get money from each_other that means we're trying to sell bonds to each_other . 2968745_2974705
&-uh the price of bonds should drop we're trying to &~s we're all trying to sell bonds to each_other +... 2976285_2982565
that means &-uh if the price of bonds drops the interest rate is going up (0.4) but if the domestic interest rate goes up and the return abroad is exogenous &-uh you get a tremendous inflow of foreign &~f financial investment +... 2986295_3007135
when that happens &-uh all these foreign financial investors are stopping in the currency market to get dollars it's gonna create a shortage of dollars there . 3010775_3020395
the foreign exchange market'll make the dollar more expensive . 3022335_3026035
it'll give you fewer dollars per pound . 3026855_3028355
as the dollar revalues gains in value it should hurt net exports +... 3030655_3038055
in fact what happens is these two things end up counterbalancing and Y doesn't change . 3040865_3046365
and the reason is it it can't change the CF is is too elastic to have +//. 3047805_3054445
to tolerate any noninfinitesimal change in R and so if Y was actually going up there'd &~a hadta have been a change in R so the drop in NX has gotta be has gotta be big enough to offset the G . 3054665_3071165
in terms of the picture you can see it +... 3072505_3075365
first we can see that R doesn't change +... 3078565_3080265
but then from the picture itself . 3085985_3087565
&=pause_while_writing here we are originally . 3088725_3093785
(0.5) if you change government spending bond finance you haven't changed anything in the LM equation anything exogenous so the LM curve doesn't shift . 3096265_3109485
you have changed G in equation three and in fact you can reason that the IS curve shifts out but since the LM curve didn't shift +... 3110825_3123225
what you end up with is &-uh the dollar gaining in value but no change in Y . 3123765_3132845
so from the story you can see that what's happening is &-uh government increases in spending it ends up just being counterbalanced by a drop in net exports in this model . 3134385_3146365
so fiscal policy moves the real exchange rate but it doesn't change Y anymore . 3148045_3155125
so it loses its &-uh effectiveness for combatting a recession . 3155925_3160825
monetary policy on the other hand works better than it did before . 3163975_3166155
so if you believe this model &-uh last time we thought we can spend our way out_of a recession with more government spending or lower taxes or we can rely on the federal reserve to increase the money supply to get us out . 3167395_3180355
this time &-uh all we have is to rely on the federal reserve because &-uh +... 3181715_3188495
changes in net exports will neutralize the effects of fiscal policy . 3191065_3195625
it'll just build up the &-uh trade deficit if you have the government spend more money +... 3197765_3201105
alright so it's kind_of an interesting model . 3201685_3206985
are there any more questions ? 3207745_3208505
I'm gonna leave it for now and come back to it a final time either at the end of next week or +... 3209345_3217205
&-uh well I think at the end of next week for sure when I do the Dornbusch paper . 3220065_3225005
(0.8) a couple more &-uh remarks before I leave it now . 3228685_3235125
you can see that opening up the economy in this way (0.4) &-uh makes a big difference for policy implications for this model . 3237205_3247645
&=pause_while_writing so in general you might wanna keep that in mind that we think of the economy as becoming more and more open &-uh here is one example of where it can make a big difference for &-uh government policy . 3267985_3280425
if you're using a different model you might want to &-uh be sensitive to that worry about that . 3281365_3285965
another comment is we can see the need for &-uh dynamic &~a analysis . 3287605_3294805
&=pause_while_writing for example we can see we need to (0.4) to model where this anticipation about exchange rate changes come from . 3310145_3321365
comes from . 3321765_3322005
I mean the model tells us how the exchange rate changes &-uh (0.5) &-uh if we had it it it seems like we should be able to to deduce &-uh this E dot over E term &-uh in a more complete analysis . 3323405_3342185
it makes a difference makes a difference to these financial investors . 3342765_3345485
&-uh they should be interested in predicting it . 3346925_3348925
it seems like that should somehow be endogenous in the model +... 3349925_3353645
another example &-uh we should +... 3357265_3361145
track the effect of CF net foreign financial investment on NFP over time +... 3363965_3375865
so if we have net foreign financial investment in the US it means foreigners are buying up assets in this country . 3379445_3387225
over time that surely will affect NFP these net factor payments that are crossing borders . 3389605_3395645
if the foreigners are buying up a_lot_of assets here it's gonna make the &-uh NFP in the future go negative . 3395905_3401185
(be)cause profits'll be leaving . 3403105_3404665
so anyway we +//. 3407305_3408065
you can see a_lot_of instances where you would like to track the the implications for what we're doing now over time and how they're affecting the same variables &-uh in the future . 3409805_3421925
(0.5) okay . 3423125_3427325
any other questions ? 3428085_3428685
if not let me leave this model and I wanna start talking about the Static Neoclassical Model . 3431665_3437225
&=pause_while_erasing but before I do that I wanna digress for a second and talk about aggregate production functions which will be a piece of the Static Neoclassical Model . 3439405_3455925
&=pause_while_writing so there's a handout in the course packet let me give you a little &-uh quicker story about aggregate production functions . 3467385_3477905
suppose I think of an economy where there's one output good and +//. 3480285_3484885
but there's many firms that produce it . 3485085_3486525
but many firms produce it . 3502685_3504125
&=pause_while_writing one . 3507085_3513125
so let's let's think about &-uh an individual firm that's having a conventional production function . 3516805_3523905
(0.5) so an individual firm's output +... 3526605_3530385
suppose it has production function FI it's firm I index I and suppose it uses capital and labor and produces output . 3533875_3546255
(0.6) so if it's firm I it uses capital KIT and labor LIT produces output &-uh let's suppose that it has constant returns to scale . 3552545_3563025
it's the simplest case . 3566765_3567525
and the firm production function is conventional so it's increasing each argument concaving@n$part each argument I wanna assume it has constant returns to scale . 3568885_3578425
then +... 3579985_3580205
if we have a free market system you also learn in &-uh six oh one that &-uh &-uh if it's unimpeded it should should give Pareto efficiency . 3582865_3592145
so if there's &-uh that's the First Welfare Theorem . 3593725_3596625
so <if there's a> &~s if there's a stock of capital say KT and a stock of labor that LT and the labor and capital are going to be employed &-uh free market system will will see that they're allocated among the firms in such a way that that we get an efficient &~out outcome . 3597345_3616025
in this simple context that means that (0.4) a free market will succeed in in maximizing the sum of outputs given the constraint on inputs . 3617225_3631345
(0.6) so <if we> if we got all these firms indexed I +... 3632565_3640645
we're only producing one output and then we can add up the outputs of all the firms there it's all the same stuff . 3643535_3649495
so a free market should maximize the sum of this thing subject to (0.5) the fact that we can't be using more capital than we've got so let's let the aggregate be KT without an I . 3650705_3673285
(0.14) and subject to also that we're not using more labor than we've got in total +... 3686955_3691475
so let's let LT be the amount of aggregate employment . 3694215_3696995
so if if the &~f free market wasn't allocating the capital and labor in such a way that that sum was maximized a dictator could come along and and reallocate it and get more output that would mean that we were Pareto inefficient before and the the First Welfare Theorem shows that doesn't happen . 3699515_3720095
so if there're no distortions externalities taxes &-uh we should be getting this maximized subject to the constraints +... 3721495_3729195
well the aggregate production function (0.7) is just the mapping +... 3733075_3746315
that takes the total amount of capital and labor +... 3749355_3751875
into this total amount of output . 3755275_3756875
which we called little YT it's the total quantity of output . 3757935_3760655
&=pause_while_writing that mapping encompasses this idea that the total stocks of capital and labor are being used efficiently . 3775925_3784285
we've got a system that can use (th)em efficiently . 3785185_3786805
so given whatever aggregate employment there is and whatever amount of capital that's being used +... 3788445_3793665
we can go through this allocation problem or we can let the market do it for us and then we can look at the total output which is what we call little YT quantity of output and the mapping between the K and the L and that little Y is the aggregate production function +... 3796035_3810715
well (0.4) let's assume that that mapping is a &~f gives us a function that it's smooth so we can even differentiate it . 3814565_3827005
(0.9) let's go back and look at a firm's behavior for a second . 3829485_3839285
(0.6) &~u the firms in the economy &-uh are trying to maximize profits . 3845355_3850355
so the individual firms so let's look at firm I it cares about KIT and LIT the price is PT for output here's its revenues . 3853535_3867275
(0.4) if it's competitive it just takes the price it's given takes the &~w overall wage that's given +... 3872235_3878695
takes the rental fee on capital as given (0.10) that would be its profits try to maximize that . 3881775_3896435
if it's doing that it has first order conditions (0.7) you take the partial of this with respect to K it oughta be zero &=pause_while_writing so we could divide each side of that by P I could rewrite that then as this . 3898035_3928015
(0.4) so there's one that's picking the profit maximizing amount of labor +... 3934465_3940505
I don't +//. 3943245_3943625
this doesn't equal zero oops it does if I subtract it so let's just write it that way let's write it equal +... 3943985_3950445
so when it was subtracted to equal zero I just rearranged it . 3952125_3956005
let's write (th)em that way . 3957525_3958165
so if the firms are doing that that's the way we get the efficiency <out_of the> &~f out_of the complete economy +... 3959865_3968225
it turns out if we take note of the fact that all the firms are doing that we can find the a characterization of the partial derivatives of the aggregate production function . 3968605_3983585
so let's think about that . 3984945_3985765
let's go back to the aggregate production function . 3987485_3989545
(0.6) so the aggregate production function is F without a subscript without a superscript +... 3990785_4001945
it tells us for the overall amount of capital and overall amount of employment how much overall output can we get suppose that I care about the &-uh partial derivative of that mapping with respect to to K . 4004915_4020775
let's use our total derivatives +... 4021315_4023875
the total derivatives would say if I have a mapping like that induced by the allocation from the competitive market &=pause_while_writing there should be the total derivative . 4027125_4048885
(0.5) Y should also I could write it as a summation of all the firm outputs so when I take DY &~i'm I'm taking the total derivative +... 4055585_4064445
&=writes:board of that (0.5) and I know how to take a derivative of a sum I just take the derivative of each piece and add (th)em together . 4068285_4080285
it's the addition rule for derivatives . 4081685_4082705
if I'm differentiating F plus G I take the derivative of F and add it to the derivative of G . 4083485_4087985
(0.5) so it'd be that +... 4089645_4095125
so that's KIT there +... 4098405_4102445
now I know how to take the derivative of each of these functions the total derivative we just use our rule +... 4105985_4111585
&=writing_throughout_utterance you go partial of F with respect to its first argument times D of that plus the partial of F with respect to its second argument times D of that (0.8) but now think about the individual firm behavior . 4114985_4138085
these firms are going about their business in the free enterprise economy they should've set their partial derivatives equal to the &-uh real rental rate and the real wage . 4139695_4150475
so every place I've got a partial of F with respect to K no matter which I it is &~tha I can put in the overall rental rate over P for that . 4152575_4162855
and since that doesn't depend on I I can take it out_of the summation . 4165185_4168485
so I can rewrite this as rent T over PT times summation DKIT and I can do the same thing with the second piece wage T over PT times DLIT (0.11) but overall if the economy is allocating factors efficiently it must be using all the available capital it shouldn't be leaving any sitting around idle if the partial derivatives of those f@l-s are positive . 4168865_4198845
so overall +... 4212895_4213555
this must be true . 4217755_4218555
so if I'm making it +... 4220535_4221375
a change in Y I could get that from a change in K or a change in L . 4223995_4228495
&=pause_while_writing and the same must be true of L it should &~ho the constraint for that should hold with equality if I'm getting efficiency . 4241175_4247075
(0.6) so when I look down here and here (0.6) first one here should be DKT should be &~th if I sum up all the changes in the capital for the individual firms it should be the change in the aggregate capital . 4252815_4273535
(0.6) so &=pause_while_erasing the point I'm trying to make is +... 4280625_4290405
if we think of free market behavior as giving us (0.10) this aggregate production function (0.5) then +... 4294425_4313805
if I change Y by only changing K holding &~N L fixed &=pause_while_writing that would correspond to taking the &-uh +... 4316745_4345925
the first term here and setting DL equal to zero so that that disappears (0.4) by all of this that should correspond to this one'll be zero if DL is zero that should correspond to the rental fee &=pause_while_writing plus zero +...
there I I keep putting t@l-s in here lemme lemme just drop (th)em out all the way across . 4363385_4367065
(0.4) from this now you can then see what the partial derivative of the (0.4) so rental fee on capital over P . 4368065_4383385
if you have this aggregate production function if it summarizes &-uh what's happening in the free market economy in the simple case +... 4384445_4392845
&-uh if I have this mapping +... 4394285_4397165
I I know what its partial derivative is . 4398305_4402785
it's it +//. 4403025_4404805
what <it's equal to> it's equal to the rental fee in capital in real terms . 4405105_4409345
and I could do the same thing holding DK equal to zero and just changing DL . 4410045_4414245
&=pause_while_writing and get that . 4417385_4422025
so what does that say ? 4423245_4424525
it tells me that &-uh those partial derivatives in the aggregate production function are constant +... 4424865_4432605
they also give me the aggregate demand for capital and labor . 4436195_4441035
usually a demand function is a quantity as a function of prices these are giving me prices as a function of the input quantities they're in inverse demand function form . 4442735_4451835
that gives me the inverse demand function in aggregate for capital and the partial with respect to labor gives me the inverse aggregate demand function for labor in the economy . 4452575_4464615
so if I think of an aggregate production function I have amounts of capital amounts of employment I'm gonna let the free market allocate (th)em and look at total output and I call that mapping F . 4465415_4479095
the partial derivatives of it turn out to give me the factor prices . 4479585_4483525
they &{l=SIC ten &}l=SIC out turn out to therefore define the aggregate demand functions for capital and labor in inverse demand function form +... 4483905_4491925
I wanna keep that in mind it's not surprising when you think it +//. 4493085_4498165
think of it if the total amount of capital and labor being allocated efficiently if I bring in one more unit of labor if all the other units are used efficiently it really doesn't matter where I allocate that last unit it's called the envelope theorem . 4498155_4511895
as long as all the previous units are being used efficiently if I bring in one little additional unit I can allocate it to any firm . 4512875_4518715
how much is it worth to a firm ? 4518955_4520135
well it's worth a wage &-uh that's how much a unit of labor is worth . 4520535_4525035
that's &-uh they were setting their marginal product equal to W over P . 4525905_4530905
and that's what this is showing same thing for capital +... 4531945_4535845
alright well so much for getting to the Static Neoclassical Model I'll I'll do that next time using this aggregate production function . 4536985_4546625
&-uh and I'll also talk about the Lucas Model there's the Lucas paper is in your xerox course packet there's a little bit of reading on it in the textbook also . 4548025_4558165
but I'd like to do both those things next time +... 4559545_4561045
okay if you didn't get a problem set for Thursday I've got some extra copies . 4563465_4567345
remember those will not be graded but I hope you'll work on (th)em ahead of time +... 4568725_4573885
