what part of the story do you think was the saddest ? 995_4015
like what part of the story was the saddest ? 5015_8755
I think it was whenever +... 8955_10375
the saddest was for me was whenever Pablo died, because Elena had a really hard time . 11215_18675
she smashed all the flowers and she let all the birds free . 18975_22155
I think that was one of the really sad parts of this story . 22355_26495
why do you think she let the bird to go free ? 26745_28385
I think because her and Pablo, they got them together and since he's gone, why keep anything of his ? 29585_39705
so, just let the birds free . 39985_41765
another time it was when the soldiers burned down the whole village . 42365_48165
yeah . 48405_48725
why did the family move ? 54785_56325
do you think it was a good choice to move ? 56665_58725
yes . 59265_59725
they moved mostly because Elena's husband told them that there would be a war and to take the children and go somewhere else . 60025_72365
and I think it was a good, really good, decision to move . 73685_78625
because if they didn't they could have been destroyed and taken from the leaders or they could've just like +... 78935_90355
died . 91015_91095
yeah . 91315_91615
yes, I agree with S_four . 92635_97395
Pablo told them that there was going to be a war and that people would come and hurt either her and her family or other people and burn down the houses . 100025_112245
so, I think it was a very good choice . 113565_115425
how would you describe Elena's personality ? 117465_121145
and why would you describe it like that ? 121645_122625
I would describe it as brave and smart . 122625_126045
because she was smart to put the horses in the kitchen so that they didn't go looking through the barn to find horses . 126495_133735
and she was also smart to put her son behind the pans back there and she was brave because she didn't hide her whole family, but she actually opened the door for that guy . 134475_152175
I think that whenever Pablo died, she was really frazzled and she didn't know what to do because that was her partner . 156145_165765
and he was her other half and I don't think that Elena, she probably didn't know what to do . 166005_186645
that's why she probably let the birds free and swung the stick around . 187125_192745
I agree with S_five and S_four because she was afraid to open the door with her family right behind her to that man . 193885_205185
and she was also smart to hide the horses in the kitchen and her son in the pans . 206085_212085
she was kind because when the man asked if she had any more sombreros, she only had one and that was her husband's . 214385_224785
and that was the last thing she probably had left of him . 225105_229065
and it was probably really hard for her to give it away . 229945_232685
how would you feel and what would you do if your father died ? 234065_240485
I'd probably be crying . 246005_247085
honestly I'd be pretty sad if my dad died . 247745_250305
that would be really hard because xxx my dad does a lot of stuff . 251025_260365
my mom and dad, they do a bunch of stuff with me . 260785_264665
so it kind of would be hard to lose any of family members like that . 266745_270365
but I'm not really sure what I would do if I were at a younger age like Rosa . 271085_280945
I'm not really sure what I would do if I were younger because honestly I'm pretty sure that if I were as old as Rosa was when her father died, I probably wouldn't know what was going on . 281405_295225
and honestly, I think my mom would be really upset at the same reaction . 296575_303955
she wouldn't have the same reaction at all, but I think my mom would also be extremely sad if +... 304255_314735
I've had dreams about my dad dying and I don't really want to, I never would like my dad to die because my mom and dad, my dad proposed to her eleven years ago . 317025_332165
they've been engaged for ten years now and they still haven't gotten married . 332625_335745
they've gotten so many fights that I'm surprised that me and my mom, we're still living in that house because they've gotten so many fights about money, about the car, about legal issues, like bills and stuff . 336185_354545
because my dad got in trouble +... 355365_357225
why don't we stick to the question ? 358145_359905
how would the story have changed if they found Trinidad ? 362505_364845
I'm sorry, can you repeat the question ? 366945_369605
I couldn't hear you . 369845_370285
how would the story have changed if they found Trinidad ? 370465_373225
(be)cause their cousin . 373945_375145
oh . 376145_376405
do you think there's a place ? 376945_377825
I think no clue what +... 378305_379405
I think that probably would've helped (be)cause they would've had a place to stay and they would've been able to actually get some more food . 379905_386405
I think that would've actually helped a lot, but like it said in the story, I don't really know an address, so you know . 387285_394785
if they did find them, they'd probably be happy cause she hasn't seen him in how many years ? 395285_402825
and I kind of disagree with they would have somewhere to stay (be)cause it said that they had a lot of money to buy food and they got a shelter and then they got a job . 403505_416905
and I don't think that it'd help that much if they found them . 417725_423305
(be)cause they all still have to get a job . 424445_426345
I disagree with S_two because they would still have to get a job, but I think it would've helped, but they haven't seen them in a while and they might have a place to stay and they could help them get food and tell them where good stuff is and where not to go . 427805_444245
I also disagree with S_two because honestly Diaz, they said that he lives somewhere, so he has a house . 444765_453685
he probably has a place, he would stay . 453805_455505
and honestly, I also think that he lives in America . 456105_460265
so honestly, he actually could have helped with all the chores and stuff . 460945_465265
and he also could have helped the kids learn English . 465725_467525
he could have helped with a lot of things, so I disagree . 467525_471885
I think I disagree with S_three because even though, yes, he did have more things maybe, but I think that it helped them to learn to be on their own and it helped them to be positive and to know everything is going to be okay . 472565_494365
and I think it kind of made them a little more brave because they didn't have everything like a normal American had, they had to work for everything, you know ? 495185_505405
does this story remind you of another movie or story you've read or seen ? 507105_522145
this reminds me of Katie's Trunk . 525125_527365
because they had them, I don't know if they have a movie or not, but they were both in a revolution, Mexican and Katie's was American . 529005_541245
and Elena and Katie, they were both brave . 542525_545945
because Elena hid the stuff she wanted to keep and Katie went back in to try to save some stuff . 546315_554875
this story actually reminds me of the personality of Slow and the story of A Boy Called Slow because the personality trait I would compare to is they're both extremely kind, but they were also brave . 555935_572475
Slow, he was kind and he worked hard and Elena, she worked extremely hard . 573345_578825
I think they had a lot of things in common . 579365_581485
I mean they were brave, they were kind, they were hard workers, I think . 581605_586945
but her personality reminds me of Slow's . 587605_590345
the book Elena reminded me of like a book that was in the library called Remembering Mrs . 591065_597945
Rosie . 598045_598305
I'm not quite done with +... 599165_600645
