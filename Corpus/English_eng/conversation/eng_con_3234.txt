which lines ? 0_598
the beginning line . 598_2513
yes . 2513_2965
was a@l b@l ten centimeters long . 2965_4125
yes . 4125_4813
and then an angle of sixty degrees at a@l . 4813_6403
yes . 6403_6965
and draw a line six centimeters long . 6965_8350
from where ? 8350_9381
from a@l . 9381_9813
from a@l, yep . 9813_10646
so you've got two lines and an angle . 10646_12200
yes . 12200_13560
righty o@l . 13560_14591
and what did you end up with Tanya ? 14591_15825
uh +... 15825_16278
yours were all lines as well ? 16278_17551
yes . 17551_18168
draw an eight centimeter interval . 18168_19711
right . 19711_20151
make a radius of five centimeters, draw an arc, make a radius of six . 20151_24838
draw an arc from h@l bisecting arc from x@l to form point n@l . 24838_28651
bisect oh, you mean intersecting . 28651_30116
oh, crumbs . 30116_31828
yeah &=laughs . 31828_32755
so you'd end up with three sides . 32755_34578
no, no yes, it was +... 34578_36130
yeah, righty o@l . 36130_38195
what's the difference between bisect andâ†‘ +... 38195_39735
bisecting means to cut it in half . 39735_41485
half, yeah . 41485_41996
bi bi . 41996_42845
but it did bisect it . 42845_44016
it cut it in half . 44016_45533
it depends on how long the line is . 45533_46981
it was half a line . 46981_49565
&=laughs yes Louise . 49565_51341
how many times do you have to go through them ? 51341_52981
just once . 52981_53708
you have to do one each . 53708_54940
are you finished ? 54940_55688
is that all ? 55688_56663
yes . 56663_57225
she's just go to do hers . 57225_57943
righty o@l . 57943_58511
we did all ours and they all figured it out . 58511_62226
yes . 62226_62678
um +... 62678_63131
with Louise's, we did +/.63131_68875
when you cut them out you usually cut them out to see if they fit ? 68875_70575
yeah, but but they the angles were all the same . 70575_72656
<we measured the angles and all that> . 72656_72945
<yeah> . 72945_73126
<yeah, that's all right> . 73126_73673
<yes> . 73673_74856
<righty o@l> . 74856_75593
um, with Louise's, she didn't give us any angles . 75593_78936
yeah, that's okay . 78936_80256
but with um mine I gave the angles, is that is that all right ? 80256_84960
so which angles do you which angles did you give ? 84960_87050
I gave a five centimeter line . 87050_88710
yes . 88710_89281
and then a right angle with another five centimeter line . 89281_91370
right, okay . 91370_92068
and did you do anything different Nerida ? 92068_93916
yes, and Nerida's is good . 93916_95401
I like Nerida's . 95401_95980
oh, sorry . 95980_96521
yeah, so what did you start with ? 96521_98388
um +... 98388_99028
<I started with a six centimeter line> going horizontally . 99028_100888
<yes> . 100888_102170
and then found halfway three centimeters and put a dot . 102170_106631
yes . 106631_107453
you put the center point of a protractor on the dot . 107453_109680
yes . 109680_110113
and then you uh find seventy degrees . 110113_112975
yes . 112975_113801
and you draw a line then put a dot . 113801_115851
then you connect um the top point to the bottom right point of <the six centimeter line> .115851_121870
<right> . 121870_122323
yeah . 122323_123258
and Nerida's see how she has <xxx like that> . 123258_125058
<yes> . 125058_125955
yes . 125955_126418
and then you you put the pencil on the top dot again, and draw it to the xxx left hand side . 126418_131858
well that was very different . 131858_134163
I liked hers cause she had like +... 134163_135418
yeah . 135418_135770
yeah . 135770_136243
so you really what was the minimum number of instructions ? 136243_140761
so you ended up with an angle there didn't you ? 140761_142681
yep . 142681_143120
and that was a length so it determined a a point didn't it ? 143120_147081
so really you've drawn that triangle first haven't you ? 147081_150753
haven't you ? 150753_151336
yeah . 151336_152643
yeah, so it's it's that line and that line drawing that angle . 152643_155681
so you've ended up with two triangles . 155681_157105
yep . 157105_157755
that one and that one . 157755_159071
yep . 159071_159505
that one had a line a line and an angle . 159505_163663
yep . 163663_164096
that one had an angle a line and a line as well . 164096_166295
yep . 166295_166736
all right ? 166736_167590
is everyone nearly finished ? 167590_176423
yes . 176423_177015
so far we've only had two types . 177015_179985
there's four . 179985_181151
there's four types that you can do . 181151_187206
if I've had a look at yours +... 187206_191758
girls, if I've had a look at yours, see if you can draw the same triangle in a different way using different instructions . 191758_201381
do we write down those as well ? 201381_204678
you can right next to it yes . 204678_205948
how did you go with yours ? 205948_207811
what did you end up with ? 207811_209700
but what did you draw ? 209700_212413
I drew a triangle . 212413_215548
what did you start with ? 215548_216493
a six centimeter line and then I just used compass points and joined them . 216493_220563
so you just did three sides ? 220563_222725
the length of three sides . 222725_225315
no, I but I didn't include the length of length . 225315_228960
yes . 228960_229608
I just I just said um draw a six centimeter line set your compass to three centimeters, and draw an arc from each end and draw it . 229608_235601
so, that one's three centimeters and how long is that one ? 235601_239095
I don't know the &~compa yeah, that'd be three centimeters . 239095_243406
both of them are three . 243406_244195
so you've done two the length of the bottom line and the length of each side . 244195_248120
no, the length of this like how much apart xxx . 248120_250961
yeah well that's that determines the length of a line doesn't it ? 250961_253536
yeah . 253536_254103
yeah . 254103_254551
so what have you done, the same ? 254551_255726
no um +... 255726_257103
you've done something different ? 257103_257806
used a ruler and protractor . 257806_259283
and what did you do ? 259283_260318
um, did eight centimeter line . 260318_264501
yes . 264501_264981
and then I got the protractor and did sixty degrees . 264981_267075
yes . 267075_267755
and join that and then join these together and found the measurements of the +/. 267755_270791
so you found the length of that ? 270791_271888
yeah, six centimeters . 271888_273008
right, so it's two sides and an angle . 273008_274188
yeah . 274188_274795
yeah . 274795_275506
all right . 275506_277388
all right girls, we'll stop now . 277388_284020
and I'll discuss what you've been doing . 284020_286645
all right, there's been basically two different sorts that have come out . 286645_296563
all right, first of all most people are starting with a line of a certain length and lots of you are drawing, um another line here of a certain height +... 296563_307995
I'll probably make this cross first . 307995_309755
you're saying how long that will be by drawing an arc from the point, and you're saying how long the second line will be by drawing another arc from the end of the other point . 309755_318523
and you're joining it up . 318523_319930
so you're defining the length of the three sides . 319930_323818
okay ? 323818_325448
so three sides . 325448_327905
and there's another one that a lot of people have been doing which is the one that Justine did . 327905_335551
what's yours Justine ? 335551_337025
um, with a protractor . 337025_338856
yeah . 338856_339273
yeah . 339273_339761
first of all you started with a line didn't you ? 339761_341416
oh yeah . 341416_341863
yep . 341863_342320
and then sixty degrees . 342320_345280
right, so you draw a line sixty degrees here . 345280_348968
and then that's six centimeters . 348968_351576
so then you determine the length of the line and then you join those up . 351576_355008
so what she's done is what a lot of other people have done . 355008_357541
if you got the line, that line, so two sides and an angle . 357541_364630
in every single one of those that worked where did you notice the angle was ? 364630_370911
xxx . 370911_372415
in between the two lines, in the middle, all right ? 372415_374893
so the angle had to be between the two lines . 374893_377590
yes I put that in my notes two sides must be of the angle . 377590_382085
that's good . 382085_382596
must two sides must be . 382596_384318
the two like the two cause you said the minimum and I said the two sides must be of the angle . 384318_389828
yeah . 389828_390230
all right, so it's the two sides of the angle, yes . 390230_391765
yeah . 391765_392621
some people have done the angle on the left . 392621_393925
some people have made it a right angle but they're still defining it . 393925_396923
there's two other ways of doing it . 396923_398093
Helen . 398093_400003
is it different if you just if you say both angles ? 400003_402850
yes it is . 402850_404350
I just did it that way because you said xxx . 404350_406535
yeah . 406535_406928
so you've got a a line . 406928_408326
a line and then a@l b@l . 408326_409903
a@l b@l . 409903_411583
and at a@l you make it sixty degrees and just draw a line intersecting . 411583_415606
yes . 415606_416213
and at b@l you'd make an angle thirty seven degrees . 416213_419853
yep . 419853_420305
until their intersecting . 420305_422890
so that's another way of doing it . 422890_425236
yes Kate ? 425236_426226
uh, another way is you get +/. 426226_428380
hang on I'll just write this one up . 428380_430195
a side and two angles, all right ? 430195_433570
and what's the other one Kate ? 433570_435753
and you draw a ninety degree angle . 435753_437466
yes . 437466_438098
and you join the other side up . 438098_439058
and you join the other side up . 439058_441081
join the two ends . 441081_442265
right, you've got a ninety degree angle, what are you going to define ? 442265_444553
what else are you going to tell me ? 444553_448208
you said I've got a ninety degree angle, what else are you going to tell me ? 448208_451296
the length . 451296_451746
the length of the sides . 451746_453521
so you've got the length of that side and the length of that side, is that the same as anything I've done ? 453521_457568
no . 457568_459505
xxx . 459505_464505
like the bisecting ones . 464505_465890
you've got the bisecting one . 465890_467603
the two sides and an angle . 467603_468946
it's like the two sides and angle, only the angle this time is ninety . 468946_472058
but it is to do with a right angle . 472058_475121
the right angle can be special . 475121_476986
yes . 476986_479713
is it xxx ? 479713_483471
no . 483471_483945
doesn't doesn't the two angles add up +... 483945_485336
yeah . 485336_486671
yes yes, that's right . 486671_487598
the the angle up the top . 487598_490545
yeah . 490545_490998
has those two angles have to add up to ninety degrees . 490998_493718
they have to add up to ninety degrees, but if I define the three angles will I get congruent triangles ? 493718_497831
um +... 497831_500415
yes . 500415_501365
no . 501365_502976
why not ? 502976_503723
because they'll be different lengths . 503723_506213
they could be different lengths so I could have another one exactly the same only smaller with the same three angles . 506213_514206
so three angles is no good . 514206_517125
but I've still got this right angle here . 517125_521348
I can define it as two sides and an angle, or I can also define one side and the other side . 521348_531978
the hypotenuse and it will always be the same with a right angle triangle . 531978_535603
all right ? 535603_538035
so this one is written as s@l a@l s@l, side angle side . 538035_546270
and the a@l goes in the middle to show you that the angle has to be between the two sides . 546270_550895
this one is written as, can you guess ? 550895_553223
s@l s@l s@l . 553223_555096
s@l s@l s@l . 555096_556440
this one ? 556440_557951
a@l a@l s@l . 557951_560873
a@l a@l s@l or s@l a@l a@l, yep . 560873_564246
and the last one is r@l for right angle . 564246_567375
