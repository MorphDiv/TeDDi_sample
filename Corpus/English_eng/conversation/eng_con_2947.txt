Kondi passed some young children playing on an anthill . 127325_130085
One was Monday, the smallest sister of his friend, Gift . 130725_133865
She had a fine long piece of wire, which she stuck into the hard dirt . 134165_138205
little friend, Kondi called as he came near, you cannot catch an ant that way . 138885_143945
go fetch some water, for with that and a stick, we will fool them . 144585_149105
when Monday came back, Kondi poured the water around one of the holes . 149625_153165
now they will think that the rains have begun, he explained . 153985_156925
then he stuck his stick down the hole . 157505_159445
gently he pulled it out and on the end was a large ant . 160125_164225
my stick is better than wire for catching ants . 164605_167865
you may have the stick and I'll take the wire . 168305_171185
