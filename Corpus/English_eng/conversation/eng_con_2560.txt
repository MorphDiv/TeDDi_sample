&=micase_recording_announcement okay we've got two options today &-um . 158685_161105
excuse_me Maureen do you want the door open or closed ? 161165_163345
oh closed is better . 163545_164265
see you later .
&-um one of them is we could go over Kant &-uh the transcendental argument . 164685_172685
the second one is I had originally prepared a review of the whole semester comparing the epistemology and metaphysics of all the figures . 173125_180145
&-um my section yesterday opted to talk about Kant and sort_of coaxed me into having a review session next week on Wednesday at eleven &-um so I'm gonna be doing the sort_of review of all the figures at that point if you guys wanted to come to that you could &-um or we could do it today . 181145_202505
⌈ so ⌉ . 203745_203765
⌊ where ⌋ is the review session in ? 204065_205725
eleven o'clock and it's gonna be twenty four oh two I mean sorry that's this +//. 206265_211765
&=laughs &-um &=writes:board eleven o'clock Wednesday it's twenty four forty . 212425_217685
Mason Hall . 219405_219805
I'm not sure what the date is on that but next Wednesday . 221125_224065
⌈ when's the final again ⌉ ? 224645_225465
⌊ twenty second ⌋ .
&=writes the final is the following Tuesday . 226005_227625
it's April ⌈ twenty second ⌉ . 228025_229205
⌊ it's the twenty second ⌋ . 229985_230885
the twenty second ? 232905_233305
alright &-um so how many people would want to talk about Kant today ? 233255_238075
alright that's what we'll do . 238095_240195
&-um so you guys are welcome to come to this to talk about the other part . 240475_243935
&-um so the main thing that we covered is the transcendental arguments in the last two lectures . 244815_251015
and we've covered four of them . 251375_252835
so the key first thing to do is understand the style of a transcendental argument so or what it is and so this handout explains what it is for starters . 253695_262275
and you guys might remember from a_couple_of times ago when we talked about Hume that we talked about the design argument . 263235_269475
and we said you could think of it as an inference to the best explanation . 271055_275455
so &=writing_throughout_utterance what you have in the inference to the best explanation is a kind of &-um phenomenon or fact that you wanna explain . 276255_286095
and then what you do is adduce several different possible explanations for it . 287515_295035
so we talked about God being a possible explanation for the design in the world or the order in the world . 295215_300175
&-um and then <I think it was> I think it was in response to Eve she said well you know aren't there other possible explanations like evolution +... 301655_309915
or another one evolution and God +... 310455_314375
and that's true there are always several possible explanations of any phenomenon that you're gonna try to use in an inference to the best explanation . 317875_325575
so what happens is in the form of one of these arguments you take this phenomenon as your premise and then try to argue towards one of these particular explanations in your conclusion . 326335_338215
so like in the original form of this argument &-um this is kind_of actually an interesting historical fact the first time this came up these guys were not even on the board the only other possible explanation was chance and this was in the eighteen hundreds when Paley gave the argument . 338815_357335
so what Paley did was say look at this amazing design . 358115_361015
two ways to explain it God and chance . 361555_363655
I wanna show you that God is really the only explanation that's gonna do a good job of explaining design . 363805_368325
&-um because chance alone could never produce the sort_of methodical patterns that you see in the world in the laws of nature . 368925_374845
so what Paley did was just ignore these guys for a moment these evolution ones Paley said chance can't do it there's only two possible explanations God or chance so there must be a God . 375565_385485
given this phenomenon that we know about . 385625_387245
so that's a standard inference to the best explanation form . 387965_390585
questions about that +..? 391805_392505
okay great . 394865_396125
so basically a transcendental argument is just a fancy name for an inference to the best explanation . 396585_401765
&-um and so what we have on the handout there are sort_of several obvious facts so take take the second one unified consciousness +... 403185_415245
and the idea is Kant says look +... 417285_419405
it's an obvious fact that we have a unified consciousness by which he means it's obvious that Maureen's thought states and beliefs and desires and mental states all kind_of hang together in a unified way inside of her in the same way that Matt's kind_of hang together inside of him . 420835_435015
and Matt's perception of the board and my perception of the board are sort_of in two separate unified consciousnesses or not +//. 435655_441275
or &{l=SIC consciousni@u &}l=SIC &=laughs +//.
we're not at all &=laughs &-um tempted to think that we have +//. 442295_447995
that your states and my states are unified so he he wants to explain how it is that we just have single unified consciousness &=background_conversation and he says +"/. 447875_455855
+" look you know sure there are several different possible explanations for this . 456195_460295
Jen thanks . 461075_462095
&-um so you've got Locke trying to do it with memory right ? 462555_467215
and you've got Hume trying to do it and even explicitly saying out loud that he fails to do it with his causal connection theory . 467705_477125
remember his his ah sort_of explanation at the end of the treatise where he said sorry I guess I wasn't able to really present to you the unity of consciousness you've got &-um Descartes trying to do it with the soul theory +... 478285_489545
and basically we all have already walked through the whole idea that each of these ones failed right and Kant says look I'm gonna offer you a new explanation one which involves the categories of the understanding &=pause_while_writing and it's the best explanation that we have for a unified consciousness . 493105_517565
in fact it's the only adequate explanation . 517965_520065
so we know the categories of the understanding exist . 520465_523785
so see the similar structure you're trying to get to the existence of something and in design case you're trying to get to the existence of God in Kant's case you're trying to get to the existence of the categories +... 524785_533165
so do you guys see the structures here ? 535525_536665
this making sense +..? 537365_537725
xxx okay . 541065_542125
so somebody explain to me how it is that the categories explain unified consciousness (0.12) this is pretty tricky . 542465_562585
it involved a game +... 562985_565145
Monopoly ?
yep +...
(0.26) .
these lectures are really hard I think +... 594575_596175
okay . 596835_598735
&-um the categories are like rules (0.5) of the understanding . 599095_607835
and here's here's kind_of the analogy is you're supposed to think about &-um just think of a Monopoly board and think of moves being made on the board . 608595_620415
right and to an alien who's just kind_of watching these moves made on the board it looks a little random sort_of like there's nothing hanging together about the activity on the board except for that it's all happening on the board but it's just sort of like moving six spaces this way and moving three spaces that way . 620775_638215
who knows why people are doing it +..? 638355_640535
but once a person who's playing Monopoly or knows the rules of Monopoly looks at the board and sees what's happening there's sort_of a unified thing happening on the board . 642635_652875
the rules unify the game . 653575_656235
so and it might sound a little farfetched but actually think about it like when you're playing a game rules really do constitute it . 657795_663695
(be)cause &-um like for example if when you rolled the dice you started playing Twister on the Monopoly board instead . 664795_670975
&=laughs like you roll and then you get a six and then you think +"/. 671835_674215
+" okay that means I gotta put my big toe on Park Place . 674415_676455
and <then you> then you roll it again and that means you gotta put your pinky on you know jail or something like that . 676615_680955
you're playing a whole different game right ? 681335_683055
so and that's just in virtue of having changed the rules . 683175_686995
so the rules actually constitute and make up the game or unify it . 687815_693675
so in the same way there's supposed to be an analogy here where the rules or the categories of the understanding which are rules unify our consciousness . 691385_702545
<what is> what is meant by rules of understanding ? 703005_704925
ah right . 705565_706685
this is a really great question . 707185_708065
okay so remember back to last week and the Play_Doh machine ? 708545_711105
&-um &=pause_while_erasing_board we have +... 711805_715825
our cognitive faculties and there were a couple &~fi couple kinds right ? 722305_726445
there's the human sensibility &=pause_while_writing and the human understanding . 727625_735765
we never got to that . 736125_737825
huh ? 739005_739285
&=laughs we never got to the human understanding . 739685_741505
right well that's actually what we're getting to today . 741565_744965
&=writing_throughout_utterance but there's the outer sense and the inner sense and the outer sense &-um was kind_of like sense perception and what it did was impose or squish the Play_Doh into &-um a spatial framework and then remember the inner sense was kind_of like introspection and what it did was impose a temporal framework . 745545_773885
&=pause_while_writing and then as Jen said we never quite got over here to the &=laughs understanding but &-um what there are in the same way that there's two kinds of human sensibility two species of it there's twelve kinds of human understanding which are called twelve categories of understanding . 778225_799125
so in effect what Kant is trying to do in this transcendental argument is prove to you the existence of the set of cognitive faculties so make that connection (be)cause I think that might not have been clear . 800945_815065
&-um so he's really trying to show our something about our psychology with this argument . 816065_820305
these categories the most important of them for us are substance and causation and Jen's question is well so how is that a rule ? 821215_833175
right how <how does> how does this category constitute a way of unifying a &~r a rule for our mind ? 833835_841155
here's my best way of &=laughs explaining it . 842215_845015
&-um remember when we had the dough &=writes:board which was like the numina and then we said basically you process it through the human sensibilities and it comes out oops that's like a fun factory sorry &-uh fun factory over on this side sensibility's over here &-um and it came out all shaped up right ? 845795_872775
I think it was like a spaghetti shape that was the one that Mark chose I think and then over here what you get is &-uh &-um sense datum I'm really using that word roughly but it connects it to stuff which is shaped through shaped in terms of time and space . 874265_893365
okay ? 894705_894865
so you see something well you've got the numina you're trying to connect to it and as you try to connect to it it gets shaped in time and space . 895345_903205
so I start seeing things in succession and I start seeing things at particular places &-um in relationship to each_other then comes +... 903745_913345
ah not enough room the &-um human understanding and in a way we can think of it as further processing the already processed numina . 916305_927745
so what you end up with is sort_of processed processed numina right which is numina that not only is shaped in terms of time and space but now is gonna be shaped according to one or more of these categories . 928325_943825
so now if we just focus for a second on the category of cause . 945425_950025
I've got this numina I'm seeing everything in terms of time and space and now the category of cause is gonna help me shape it further . 950545_957845
and so when I push this and see it roll instead of just thinking of that in the way that Hume did as a constant conjunction of events namely in terms of my pushing being a cause and the rolling being the effect I construe it in terms of a causal relationship where my pushing is a cause and actually makes the effect occur . 958585_986445
so in a way I'm imposing a way of understanding my sense datum by using the category of causation when I see that thing and say hey I just caused it to roll . 989025_1003245
yeah Elton ? 1004425_1018905
okay my question is how do we know that the numina does not already have these processes already involved like could &~it could have a spatial framework and a temporal framework but since we're using our sensibilities a fun factory if you will we're assuming that that is causing those things to be in there where they could actually be in it already how do we know that it's our . 1006425_1028325
contribution . 1029485_1029525
yes . 1029805_1030025
this is the question that even everybody was asking last week and &-um the main way we're supposed to know that is just by being convinced by these arguments that it's us . 1031155_1042635
okay ? 1043415_1043495
that the best explanation is the categories . 1043855_1045915
⌈ wouldn't &~Occam's ⌉ +/. 1047275_1047415
+, ⌊ that's not really ⌋ convincing what you're gonna say is something like . 1047635_1051055
wouldn't it be simpler just to say that the numina already has that ? 1051695_1054055
I mean wouldn't Occam's Razor say the simplest explanation is the best one so you could just say that the simplest explanation is not that we add something to it ⌈ that it already has it ⌉ . 1054405_1063625
⌊ mhm ⌋ I see where you're going and I think it's a really good point to press him on &-um . 1063665_1067245
too bad he's dead .
pardon ?
too bad he's dead &=laughs .
too bad he's dead . 1067545_1068205
&=laughs it is actually (be)cause I think a_lot_of people would have a_lot_of questions for this man . 1068685_1074725
&-um . 1075705_1076065
<mail bomb> . 1076525_1077085
&=laughs I mean one thing to start thinking about is that we know that in several cases we are contributing something . 1079685_1085445
&~wha I ⌈ mean ⌉ +/. 1086285_1086465
+, ⌊ in terms ⌋ of like say bent sticks in water right ? 1086505_1089685
we know that the stick isn't really bent and that we're seeing it as bent because we straighten things or ⌈ that we <do that in our> perception ⌉ . 1090025_1095065
⌊ the temporal framework <of things> ⌋ if like if you were blindfolded and you had your hearing like stopped and you were like locked in a dark box &~pe it's +//. 1095065_1103385
people lose all sense of time real quickly when they're deprived of outside sensory information so wouldn't that indicate that something on the outside or some &~o not the inner sense as he calls it would contribute to our temporal framework ? 1103305_1116645
mm .
&~anoth another thing is that you talk about the bent stick we know the stick isn't bent . 1116785_1121165
because when you pull it out ⌈ you see it ⌉ . 1121825_1124005
⌊ but I mean ⌋ when you see the bent stick you kind_of you know . 1124005_1126025
well anybody ⌈ who's gone spear fishing ⌉ . 1126445_1128065
⌊ you know we might be ⌋ imposing it but . 1128105_1128785
well that's just an example it's true there are ways that we could figure out that it was straight &-um but it's an example of the ways that we do contribute and all I'm saying is Kant kind_of takes that sense of we definitely contribute something we all know we contribute something and tries to order exactly what it is that we contribute . 1129345_1145405
&-um but I know this isn't a totally &~sat satisfactory way to respond . 1146705_1149945
yes ?
I don't understand what you mean by imposing a temporal framework . 1150745_1153365
alright &-um +... 1154325_1156625
well temporal framework for starters is gonna be seeing things in terms of before and after . 1158305_1162665
or in terms of succession . 1163705_1164885
so a_lot_of people want to say that God for instance is not in &~a any temporal framework whatsoever and is in some sort of eternal now right in which &~whe whatever you were you know like let's say you had Cheerios for breakfast and now you're here somehow your eating Cheerios and your being here is happening all at the same time (be)cause there's no time . 1166005_1187025
I mean there's no way to talk about this easily . 1187225_1188645
but the idea is for us it's really hard to wrap your head around what that could possibly mean to say every single event happens at once . 1189405_1197205
right and Kant is trying to say that's just I_mean the difficulty we have with doing that is just testimony to the fact that we see everything in terms of succession and before and after at just the word go@q . 1197945_1210725
like we don't know how to think of things any other way . 1211305_1213585
and so that's he would say our inner sense at work in ordering our experience . 1214525_1220505
does that help ? 1221985_1222285
yeah but it just seems that if we can't think of it in any other way then why do we assume +//? 1222865_1230645
it seems like we're getting back to the same question . 1231485_1233045
I_mean how can he even say that we impose it if he himself can't even think of it in any other way ? 1233365_1238565
like we can't understand how it could not be the way we think it is . 1238705_1242485
how could we think +//? 1242525_1243345
you know you just crossed your legs after I started &~talki you know what I mean ? 1243985_1247425
but I guess I don't understand how we could've imposed that on the ⌈ world how could we make ⌉ +/? 1247625_1254305
⌊ right you guys are &~rea ⌋ you're good to press on this I mean so for example what you're doing is saying &=writing_throughout_utterance one is +//. 1254305_1259605
this is the second one on your handout . 1259745_1261025
but there's this other one which is &-um an argument from some set of a_priori truths in geometry to the existence of the human sensibilities which include the inner inner sense which imposes space or imposes time on it . 1261005_1276465
and what you guys are saying is +"/. 1276865_1277725
+" but look I_mean isn't there another good explanation of this which is the existence of time and space right ? 1278085_1285765
am I hearing you guys right ? 1286085_1287025
so then what you're doing is playing Kant at his own game in a way you're saying look &~i I'll I'll agree with you +/. 1288225_1294765
mhm +/.
+, that we've got some kind of thing that needs explanation here namely the fact that every time we think of things we think of them in terms of time . 1295105_1303025
every time we see things we just kind_of put them in space . 1303825_1306325
but we're not ready to just assume it's the human sensibilities which are responsible for this fact that we both agree on . 1307045_1313245
we think actually there's a better explanation which is the actual existence of the temporal framework and the spatial framework which you're saying we impose may be really out there . 1313985_1321785
and so basically you're +//. 1323285_1324725
I don't know what Kant's reply would be exactly . 1325025_1328305
&-um but you're trying to say &=writes:board that's not the one this is the one and Kant is trying to say that's not the one this is the one . 1329305_1337785
but it just seems like he doesn't even take it seems like actually saying that time and space exists is sort_of the most natural first assumption that you would make whether it be true or not it just seems that I mean &~w I think as humans we naturally tend to think that if something seems like it's out there our first guess is to say it exists . 1337945_1357185
right +/.
+, seems like he doesn't even take that into consideration . 1357825_1359965
it's like his first thought is we must impose it and then he just says that's better than the rest and it seems like well how can he even claim to have thought this out or have done anything good here if you ignored the most obvious first thought on it ? 1360675_1376015
do you wanna try to respond Mike and &~th and then Mark ? 1377055_1378835
&~i I'm not really responding but it just something which strikes me as strange is in Kant's text with the rest of the people is that there's a_lot_of skepticism about whether the real world exists and I &~w I was wondering maybe if that's where he gets the idea of you know that's why existence of time and space isn't a real possibility because of all this skepticism . 1379625_1396025
but the thing is if that was true then he still does believe in the existence of the real world . 1396745_1400205
⌈ so it's like ⌉ . 1401525_1401605
⌊ because he ⌋ believes in the existence of the numina ⌈ you mean ⌉ ? 1401605_1403945
⌊ yeah ⌋ .
or +/. 1405185_1405525
+, the dough whatever ⌈ that is ⌉ . 1406565_1407925
⌊ right ⌋ that's the numina ⌈ yeah ⌉ . 1407255_1408575
⌊ okay ⌋ yeah .
okay . 1409495_1409675
so I mean it's kind_of like the one argument it seems that he would be able to use to justify &-uh crossing out existence of time and space he still holds on to the fact that there is a real dough out there or something with the numina . 1410335_1421275
mhm mhm .
so &~y that part really kinda confuses me . 1422475_1424255

Laura ?
I was just gonna ask going back to the whole like why everything's blue we assume though that it's not just us imposing the blue it's that the world is actually blue . 1435765_1443045
mhm +/.
+, can you maybe explain that ? 1443905_1444725
(be)cause maybe that would help . 1444845_1445525
like if we saw a <negative argument> ? 1445885_1447325
right well so the blue one I mean I was thinking about that this morning (be)cause I thought Laura's gonna ask this question &=laughs:multiple &-um you guys have such great questions but I never know the answers &-um okay one thing about the blue example is you're probably just not gonna be able to get it off the ground because we're all gonna agree that that's a phenomenon to be explained . 1448215_1468755
right so so you hafta be able to put it up here in your premise and your premise is supposed to be something that says you know okay it's obviously true that everything is blue . 1469535_1479015
right and people are just not gonna go yeah . 1479695_1481935
&=laughs so that's I mean I know that your example was not meant to be sort_of &-um +... 1483315_1487675
something we would all agree to but I'm saying in a way that feature of the argument is so critical that the example doesn't really fly unless it is . 1490195_1498275
(be)cause (be)cause the features that's that's one of the main aspects of what Kant is trying to do is pick out something that we'll all agree to in the premise and say that's a fact . 1498915_1507155
and we're curious about why it's like that . 1507815_1509495
and get us curious enough and knock out enough other explanations which he did I think more successfully in the second argument than he did in the first . 1510315_1516475
&-um you know get us enough curious so that we end up saying well yeah we're open to a new explanation and actually yours does a good job of explaining it +... 1517385_1524645
does that help any ? 1526165_1526965
&=laughs so so that's why the blue example isn't isn't gonna work I think . 1527385_1533365
but I think the blue example is a good example of the kind of structure that's supposed to happen which is sort_of like here's something to explain and tell me how to explain it +... 1534065_1541725
&-um okay . 1544465_1544845
Adam ?
this is a side issue . 1545975_1546835
what are the other ten categories of understanding ? 1547235_1549875
they're in your book . 1550395_1551275
are they ? 1551575_1551875

⌊ I think ⌋ it's the second part but it might be the first part . 1563595_1567075
page forty six . 1567675_1568635
&-um under the transcendental table of the concepts of the understanding . 1569535_1572455
oh I remember those now ⌈ yep ⌉ . 1572475_1574555
⌊ just so ⌋ you know that's a tricky thing that you might not have picked up &-um the categories and the word concepts of the understanding are two ways of saying the same thing . 1573855_1582995
&=laughs:multiple ⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ so there're ⌋ categories concepts and rules . 1583795_1585575

now I remember that ⌈ chart ⌉ . 1586995_1588355
⌊ yes ⌋ .
yeah .
&=writing_throughout_utterance so categories of the understanding equals concepts of the understanding equals rules of the understanding . 1589155_1593415
this is one really hard part about Kant is that you think you've got it and then you start realizing he's identified two things and you've kept them separate . 1593985_1602685
&=laughs so just if that helps a little . 1604445_1607185
can we go over the &-uh the argument for human sensibility ? 1607445_1612085
sure . 1612905_1613285
&-um okay so that's the first argument here &-um and actually if you guys have your old handout on Kant one through three &-um get it out if not it's coming around right now on the left side in this yellow folder +... 1614265_1628465
&-um okay (be)cause (be)cause basically +/. 1629725_1635905
&~cop yeah .
+, as you can see the first supposedly obvious premise &=laughs and one which is supposed to be as obvious as unity of consciousness or as obvious as design in the world or whatever is the existence of synthetic a_priori knowledge which you'll remember from the first couple of lectures was actually contestable right we were trying to figure out whether there was anything like that . 1637105_1658025
and now Kant is assuming that there definitely is and it's so obvious that now we can try to use that fact to explain . 1658505_1663905
did he ever show +/. 1664625_1665325
⌈ something else ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ why it was ⌋ obvious ? 1665585_1666245
yeah so that's why I'm having you look at Kant one &~throu the the first handout on Kant one through three and I mean I think he tried to do this in a_couple_of different ways but I always thought this was the clearest one . 1666685_1677805
so &-um so what we're doing right now is just in service of showing you why you're supposed to be convinced that p@l one is obvious okay ? 1678725_1685365
so here's why you should think there are some synthetic a_priori truths . 1685765_1690185
and here's one about geometry . 1690385_1691705
think about remember &~th what synthetic means and what a_priori means for starters . 1692615_1696795
somebody remind me what's synthetic . 1697195_1698375
it actually gives you information . 1699415_1700675
okay good . 1701335_1702095
in a way synthetic is sort_of like the garbage category analytic is &=laughs it's not analytic . 1702795_1710255
and then so you define it that way and then analytic means &-um that the concept of the predicate is in the concept of the subject . 1711015_1719855
okay ? 1721495_1721735
so something like bachelors are unmarried is analytic because the concept of the predicate namely unmarried is already in the concept of bachelor which is your subject . 1721815_1733035
so it's gonna be +//. 1733955_1734635
analytic truths are just true in virtue of the meaning of the word bachelor and unmarried . 1735075_1739535
synthetic truths are not analytic . 1740155_1742515
that's basically what I think they mean . 1742835_1743995
&=laughs so you're gonna note something as synthetic just because you couldn't figure out whether it was true or not by looking at the meanings of the words . 1744885_1750525
so something like Maureen has brown hair it's not obvious from the word Maureen that I'm gonna have brown hair . 1751285_1757005
or bachelors are fun it's not obvious from the word bachelor that they're all gonna turn out to be fun even though many of them are right ? 1757645_1764605
mhm +/.
+, so &=laughs so then basically synthetic is going to be something that's not true in virtue of the meanings of the words and it's it's gonna give us information <they're the> they're the kind of exciting truths you don't just sit around with your dictionary to create them you have to go out and experience the world to figure them out you synthesize something new onto the concept of the subject . 1766165_1784845
doesn't he distinguish synthetic &-uh knowledge from &~th experience knowledge ? 1786345_1790265
or is that the same thing ? 1790645_1792285
oh he definitely does distinguish okay and this is where we get the a_priori versus a_posteriori . 1792385_1797965
so a_posteriori is knowledge from experience . 1798125_1800225
and a_priori is the garbage category . 1801485_1803385
&=laughs:SUm it's not a_posteriori . 1804645_1806265
okay ?
okay +/. 1806965_1807225
+, which means any way that you get knowledge except from experience . 1807745_1810925
so where would synthetic fall in both categories ? 1811645_1813965
these are crosscutting distinctions so right you could the big point of a couple times ago is to show that you could get &-um +... 1814255_1821615
&=writes:board &-uh here's ⌈ synthetic ⌉ . 1823915_1826235
⌊ I thought ⌋ it meant more than that to Kant . 1826355_1827695
I thought it was +//. 1827835_1828415
I thought a_priori wasn't just not &~as a_posteriori but that it was actually necessary . 1828555_1833215
nope and it's actually critical that it be a garbage category to Kant . 1834115_1837595
so hold on a second . 1838315_1839715
well Gold did a bad job of explaining that .
so analytic and synthetic this is a distinction about what makes the sentence true &=pause_while_writing and analytic is basically the relations of the concepts in the sentence just say the concepts make it true . 1844705_1864425
and synthetic is something else makes it true . 1867185_1869605
so like in the case of bachelors are fun you might say the world makes it true . 1871425_1877845
right and Kant's gonna wanna say something about the structure of our mind makes it true . 1879185_1884005
so those are just examples of things that could make it true besides the concepts . 1884425_1888645
then the distinction between a_priori and a_posteriori is not a distinction that's being drawn about what makes the sentence true but how we came to know its truth +... 1892115_1902575
or came to know the sentence . 1904675_1905795
(0.4) &-um so in a_posteriori we come to know it through experience and a_priori is we learn it some other way than experience . 1910345_1922445
I'm confused then why does he keep making references to a_priori and necessary being the same thing ? 1923825_1928545
oh I'm sorry I see what ah I see what you mean . 1929425_1931505
yes yes . 1932585_1933285
it turns out &~tha &=laughs well +... 1933565_1935125
that's a really good question it turns out that one of the ways we can know it is through reason and that's generally thought to be the key way and things that you know through reason are necessary . 1936585_1947005
because the only way to know something through reason is to find out that its opposite was a contradiction +... 1947885_1952765
and so +... 1954765_1955545
it itself would hafta be necessary if its opposite were a contradiction . 1957185_1961405
(be)cause contradictions just can't be the case . 1962125_1963885
so like if let's say not a@l is a contradiction then A hasta be necessary . 1964865_1968705
so if that's how you come to know the truth of the sentence in hand then the sentence you've got is necessary . 1969525_1975545
and that's why you get this kind of relationship between a_priori and necessity . 1976305_1981905
&=laughs because the main way of doing something other than using experience to come to know something is reason and that's gonna be a necessary truth . 1982785_1990785
did +/.
⌈ so then &~i ⌉ +/.

yeah +/.
⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 1992065_1992305
+, ⌊ &~s so ⌋ so <is it> is it a distinction between necessary and contingent ? 1992465_1995945
is a_posteriori a contingent truth ? 1996785_1998445
or is that oversimplified ? 1999205_2000405
(0.4) I'm not sure if you could know a necessary truth from experience but I guess I wouldn't want to rule it out . 2002725_2012945
in which case I'm not sure I'm ready just to write contingent down here . 2014445_2017505
okay . 2018205_2018225
okay ? 2018365_2018545
so if it's a_priori it is necessary but that +//. 2018385_2021105
it doesn't mean that if it's necessary it's necessarily &=laughs:S1 a_priori &=laughs . 2021385_2024965
right and in fact what's a little confusing about this is that I don't think I don't think every single a_priori truth is gonna be necessary . 2025345_2033885
because here's an example . 2034465_2037465
remember another way that Descartes but not Locke &-um but Descartes and other people think that you can come to know something without experience is innatism . 2038885_2049685
right ? 2050445_2050465
so that you could come to know something by the fact that you were born with this thought . 2051205_2056865
so what's been puzzling me is sort_of like okay so that's another way to come to know something without without using experience . 2058165_2065565
you just look inside of yourself and introspect an innate belief or concept that you had . 2065935_2069755
&-um that would be a much easier way to get to a synthetic a_priori truth than all the stuff that Kant is doing . 2070735_2079315
if it turned out that there was a synthetic truth that you innately had . 2079895_2083615
but somehow that never came up in lecture so Mike ? 2083975_2086415
it seemed like something innate would be something synthetic since it's something else that makes it innate like that you were given that knowledge in the beginning . 2086495_2095155
try me again . 2096035_2096635
remember this distinction is just based on what makes it true +... 2097195_2099935
it could maybe it could turn out that you had an innate belief like bachelors are unmarried . 2100355_2108135
in fact Locke thought that most people confused well most people thought that innate beliefs were reason +//. 2109555_2115995
they got from reason remember that part ? 2116335_2117835
so like when they were reasoning along and they said &=laughs they said see it's innate because when you use your reason like you just remembered it you &~r recollected something . 2118675_2127115
&-um and and and the idea was supposed to be Locke was saying well I could have just figured it out without having it be innate just by using my reason just the fact that I used my reason didn't all of a sudden show that it was innate these are separate ideas . 2128035_2143515
&-um but okay . 2144735_2146815
okay so these are the distinctions and it's a little confusing but I think the easiest way to think about it is the way I've described where the a_priori category and the synthetic category are garbage categories . 2147665_2158365
okay ? 2159425_2159505
⌈ so ⌉ .
⌊ seems ⌋ like it messes a_lot_of stuff up or maybe it doesn't but it just seems like if we've been +//. 2160305_2164285

because one of the here's one of the key things is that Kant thought he was gonna show us a third way we could come to knowledge . 2201505_2209645
which was &-um through analyzing our cognitive faculties . 2210525_2216185

⌈ and ⌉ that's kind_of critical . 2218745_2231485
okay but I'm looking through my notes and he did write he wrote a_priori is not dependent on experience could be reason alone or innate knowledge and then he put distinctly Kantian is that a_priori requires necessity and is strictly universal as well . 2219065_2233125
so unless I wrote the wrong thing down Gold actually said that Kant had this &~dist that a_priori didn't usually include innateness but &~i for Kantian's view +/. 2233845_2243685
⌊ ah I see ⌋ +/.

yeah so synthetic these ones are definitely the case . 2261365_2265445
all analytic truths are gonna be necessary . 2266225_2267885

alright &-uh I I'm probably just like you know ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 2287735_2289335
⌊ what it means to violate the principle ⌋ of contradiction is to have &-um something be both itself and not itself at the same time . 2289735_2296535
and and nothing in reality at least according to an analytic philosopher does that okay . 2297315_2301635
&=laughs but here's the important thing about analytic truths is that their opposite would violate that principle . 2303385_2311065
and that's not the case with a synthetic truth generally . 2312545_2315325
okay . 2317005_2317345
&-um the reason I'm hedging on that is because some synthetic truths are gonna be necessary and so some of them look like their opposites would violate that . 2318185_2330825
but this is getting really technical and we don't really have to know all of this stuff in detail . 2331145_2334965
and I think Jen maybe you're right . 2335445_2336865
we should just take a_priori truths to be necessary and just kind_of forget about innatism for now and just &=laughs just say necessary and just think of two ways then . 2336985_2346605
for a truth to be a_priori one of them is that it's coming from reason and the other one is that it's coming from Kant's way which is gonna be an analysis of the cognitive faculties okay ? 2347145_2356425

one of the things that it would encompass is human sensibility . 2385955_2387955

⌊ so do you ⌋ think you can just discuss the difference ? 2388915_2390375
yeah yeah yeah . 2390495_2391075
&-um you're right to think there's a similarity here because both of these things are imposing frameworks on the numina . 2391555_2397635
so there's something something really similar going on . 2397795_2400235
but the important difference is twofold . 2400705_2402565
one of them is this one if you think about it sort of in a very naive but sorta accurate Kantian way this one processes first and then this one processes what that one processed so in a sense what happens is you've got your numina and it comes down and processed first by your sensibilities . 2403105_2423125
you get output number one . 2423765_2424885
which is a sense datum that's organized in terms of space and time . 2425585_2428585
then it's processed next by your human understanding and you get output number two okay ? 2429355_2434935
which is gonna be not only processed by space and time but also processed by the categories of the understanding . 2435115_2441255

⌈ if we go back to the <it's all> ⌉ I'm looking at the Play_Doh and I see its color or I feel its texture . 2498705_2502885
okay +/.
+, so at that point when I'm using my sense perceptions do I not understand . 2503425_2506285
you wouldn't know that it's a +//. 2506825_2507705
here's here's like a really obvious thing you wouldn't know like that it's a building right ? 2508085_2511845
until you start organizing like right now let's just say I'm I've processed this numina outside me &-um right out there and I've used my human sensibility and what I know is that it's like at a certain distance from me and it's right now at that distance from me . 2512375_2527615
okay ? 2527915_2527955
then I'm gonna use my understanding to start putting on some more layers of concepts onto it . 2528755_2534115
building is not one of the twelve categories &=laughs (be)cause it's it's a concept that'll become +//. 2535295_2539515
that's less &-um universal but just think of it as an example of something that the human understanding does at some later stage in the process of being at work on your sense data . 2539745_2550545
and then I'll say hey this sort_of reddish brownish object twentyish feetish from me is a building right ? 2551085_2557565
and I can't do that until I start thinking about my sense datum . 2557665_2560585
and in this sense I guess I've always liked Kant (be)cause I feel like he's the only one who's sort_of distinguishing sort_of pure sense datum inputs that you might get at an earlier stage from more organized ones which are really interpreted right ? 2561185_2573985
and &=points_to_board so in a sense these guys are a little bit more fine or something and these guys are really prior and really elemental in basic ways of processing . 2574305_2583345
does that kind of +//. 2583865_2584265
okay Mark and Elton . 2584805_2586205
⌊ okay ⌋ I've got an example maybe +/. 2586205_2587425
+, ⌊ like ⌋ if you're playing basketball and you have like people that are on your team and people that are on the other team like initially you process it as +"/. 2587785_2594605
+" okay there's like shapes and basketball player somebody with socks on . 2594905_2598065
<but when> but &~y when you start distinguishing it between opponent and teammate that's something that it's not there . 2598805_2605245
but &~y that would be your understanding when you make that distinction but the the when you view it as just like people and colors and shapes and +/. 2605425_2613145
+, mm +/.
+, that would be your sensibility . 2613485_2614925
no even people colors and shapes are gonna be the understanding (be)cause all your sensibility does is space and time . 2615345_2620085
okay ?
okay . 2621705_2621965
&-um but you might right now be sort_of showing that there's tons of different levels of interpretation which are gonna happen and think of the twelve categories as the most basic of those additional levels of interpretation beyond space and time . 2622285_2635565
mkay .
but that's good &-um . 2636365_2637765
in my example you're like next to the biggest mountain of Play_Doh . 2638025_2641005
you have a knife with a clock on it . 2641465_2643065
and you cut off a chunk <of the> of the Play_Doh so that's like your sensibilities and that gives you a shape and a time when you did it . 2643305_2649005
and you stick it in the fun factory and get the shape out which would be your understanding . 2649345_2652605
and then that's what you perceive what comes out the spaghetti like Play_Doh . 2652965_2655925
would that work ? 2656525_2656905
&-uh so wait you're doing the fun factory twice then ? 2657925_2660345
yeah in a sense ⌈ would that ⌉ . 2660625_2661645
⌊ yeah that's ⌋ that's good yeah . 2661665_2662345
but the second time it's a little different +/. 2662885_2664425
+, it's got a different sort of shape &-um okay just to really quickly finish up this thing (be)cause I know &-um we've gotta have ELI come back up here for just a minute &-um okay so this was all an attempt to explain synthetic a_priori distinctions so that we could understand why premise one of this argument was supposed to be really obvious just take a quick look at this argument . 2664995_2682435
think of a straight line is the shortest distance between two points . 2683835_2688455
a straight line is your subject shortest distance between two points is your predicate . 2689285_2694525
is the predicate already in the subject ? 2695845_2697265
no . 2698485_2699605
&=laughs oh no the answer's supposed to be no . 2700365_2702105
Mike thinks it's yes ⌈ but ⌉ . 2702745_2704065
well I had a problem with that in general I mean even does the seven plus five +/. 2704105_2707765
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ isn't ⌉ really twelve he says that's synthetic that I mean even in more basic examples I have a ⌊ lot of difficulty with that <but I won't start> ⌋ . 2708405_2715865
⌈ well we don't have time ⌉ .
⌊ okay .
okay .
yeah ⌋ so that's +//. 2715865_2717105
let's just assume the answer's obviously that it's not contained okay ? 2716975_2720535
that it's supposed to be obvious that it's not analytic okay ? 2720935_2723415
and then the other idea is so how do you come +//. 2723995_2726375
so it's +//. 2726735_2727075
whoops sorry so it's synthetic . 2727175_2728655
and then how do you come to know it ? 2729075_2730915
well you don't come to know it by just comparing bunches of little lines everywhere right ? 2731195_2734855
you can figure it out by using your mind and the facts of &{l=SIC mathematic . 2735255_2737995
&}l=SIC so you don't come to know it by experience you come to know it in some other way namely by reason okay ? 2738415_2743875
so then he's trying to say look these truths of geometry are synthetic a_priori +/. 2743865_2748325
okay .
+, so that's supposed to be obvious and that's the beginning point up here see that ? 2749985_2754305
and then you're supposed to be able to find out that the human sensibilities are the best way to explain this obvious fact . 2754625_2759965
but <that was> that was the part I didn't ⌈ understand ⌉ . 2760105_2761885
⌊ right ⌋ right I know we only have two minutes but ask me at the review or else read through this (be)cause it should be relatively clear okay . 2761885_2768025
I read through it that's why I asked the question &=laughs &=students_get_up_to_leave . 2768065_2769805

I have a quick question <on like the putting> time thing and causation together . 2940305_2945605
yeah . 2945925_2946145
like if if all times are just at once how can one thing cause another ? 2946355_2949495
wouldn't there hafta be like a procession it's things have to come +//. 2950055_2953635

wouldn't there hafta be a procession ?
if &~i we might experience like the present +/. 2958295_2962575
mhm +/.
+, but how could &-um like isn't he trying to say that there's causation outside of our mind like these objects are causally connected ? 2963055_2969155
well +... 2970395_2971795
that's debatable actually . 2973295_2974655
especially given that causation is one of the categories of understanding it looks like we contribute causation to the world not ⌈ causation ⌉ . 2976075_2983995
⌊ so if it's &~irre ⌋ if it's irreversible how can like the objects outside our mind it +//. 2984075_2989075
I think like Gold said objects that are outside our mind can't be reversible ? 2989415_2992995
yeah numina . 2993675_2996235
so wouldn't that be that causation's outside our mind ? 2996495_2998775
well or at least that irreversibility is . 2999375_3001595
right +/.
