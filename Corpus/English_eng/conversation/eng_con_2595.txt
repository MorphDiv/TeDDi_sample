and that last question &~th I know I told the TA to be really easy <on the> on the terrains question . 2055_7235
you know that very last one . 8535_9715
I have a question +/. 10415_11415
⌈ sure ⌉ +/. 11695_11835
+, ⌊ about ⌋ the &-um the one question &-um where we hadta find the coordinates of the Atlantic Ocean . 12415_19015
if we have the longitude and latitude mixed up . 19995_23235
oh that's a small +/. 23975_24835
just one point off .
+, yeah . 25195_26515
I mean I think the total +/. 26915_27775
+, ⌈ just the right numbers ⌉ .
+, ⌊ for that question was ⌋ something like five points . 28015_30055
+, oh okay .
+, and &-uh <four was implicitly suited for> . 31395_33835
what ?
is this is that a mistake ?
thirty two points ? 34535_39595
yeah . 39895_39915
like a mistype doesn't it . 40775_42055
probably meant three so &=laughs . 42115_44375
it was one of the ones I didn't know and I was like uhoh . 44995_48635
I didn't catch that . 49695_52695
&=laughs .
are the tests graded yet ?
they're graded but I haven't checked over with (th)em yet . 57225_60405
&-uh I &~d I wanna do that before I hand (th)em back . 60505_63865
and are they curved ? 64005_64545
are you gonna curve ?
oh yeah . 64945_65625
well I never know what people mean when they say curved you know . 65865_69425
adjusted to the rest of the class ? 70405_71725
yeah it's a +//. 71985_72845
yes .
that's true . 73525_74065
but &~i it's not to the extent that I say okay Gaussian distribution tells me that &~the there's there's a thirty thirty two percent one standard deviation above and below the means . 74255_88955
curves always should push up grades .
they should never bring (th)em down .
I beg your pardon ? 89635_92555
curves should always push up grades <and help those who are on the edge> .
that's right .
good +/.
+, pretty hard to do it that way yeah . 94455_101035
it's &-uh +... 103065_103565
generally what I do and this is why it's hard to say what the final grades are gonna be &-uh (un)til you actually do the averaging now I put the BC boundary somewhere near the median . 106505_117905
but what I always do is look for breaks in the distribution (be)cause there's never a perfect Gaussian distribution . 118725_124125
so I try to put put &-uh the letter boundaries where there's a little little gap . 124695_131815
so that there's not a_lot_of people affected by this boundary problem . 133075_137015
and then by having the extra points available always it's always for that for those one or two people that are close to the boundary it gives them a chance to hop over it . 138615_147995
are we having a quiz today ? 153295_154335
yeah . 155015_155675
actually .
&=laughs:multiple we wouldn't want you to get out_of shape . 158315_159535
&=laughs it's a real short one &-uh multiple choice . 159975_165075
real easy . 165935_166475
the last one was multiple choice too but it was twelve multiple choices . 166875_170595
&=laughs that's right . 171315_172435
+, is this a real multiple choice ?
well this is only three . 172775_175635
you got a better shot at this one . 175815_177135
is it based on the reading or the notes ?
the reading . 178215_178775
you did do the reading ? 180625_181645
right ? 182425_182925
<I didn't want to> .
&=laughs it'll it's comparatively easy +... 183325_189625
and remember it doesn't count against you . 190785_193365
just a chance to make some points . 193825_195405
it counts against you if everybody else gets it right .
yeah well . 196985_201465
if everybody else is right I mean the letter grades are determined before I add in the points so it doesn't +//. 202105_207825
it's not a competitive sort_of thing . 207885_210085
the tests are competitive . 211065_212245
but but not the actual points . 213285_214705
(0.11) I I wanna talk a little bit about the movie before we start on the other thing . 215265_228405
and &-uh . 229525_230125
it needs a better plot .
pardon ? 231125_232625
it needs a better plot .
it needs a better plot . 232845_233505
it needs a better plot yeah . 235735_237015
well it's too it was too this way and that right ? 237275_240315
well they were that's one of the reasons I wanna go over it . 240815_243015
is there were a_couple_of key points made that I wanna emphasize . 243415_246275
&-uh for instance . 247475_249695
now we it focused primarily +//. 251055_254215
it told you there was a_lot_of geochemistry going on . 254515_256595
but it really didn't go into great detail there . 257095_259895
they just said it's it's cool stuff . 261455_262895
and it's building these big polymetallic sulfide chimneys that are +... 264385_268625
if it was cheap to get (th)em &=laughs and get (th)em back they might even be economically important . 270265_277025
but it's not . 278185_278665
so if you go by the +//. 279365_282645
just say okay geochemistry is interesting it's building these big chimneys there are sulfide deposits fine . 282945_288445
now the geology and geophysics part the &~w guy that &-uh Ken McDonald the chief scientist's husband his his main point was what ? 288825_301045
do you remember what he he said about exploring the deep and all that sort of stuff ? 301405_306525
he showed that little model of what the area looked like . 307505_309965
what +/.
⌈ miles ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ was his ⌋ main point ? 310545_311325
what ?
if you can do fifty miles you can do the rest of it pretty much .
you what ? 313365_315645
if you did a fifty mile stretch you can do the rest of the four thousand . 316715_318975
well he he said that was a very special area . 319175_321895
that he could predict that this was gonna be an active area just by how it looked . 322635_328075
you know <it was> it was slowing up it was &-uh higher than stuff around it . 328375_333415
and there weren't any real central valleys in it it was just one big warp in the ridge . 333855_340015
and so he predicted that this was gonna be an active area . 340715_343255
so . 344495_344655
this is +//. 345035_345415
being able to predict in science is a is one of the great things . 345675_350135
being able +//. 350435_350715
that means you semi understand it . 351195_352835
and understanding is the ultimate goal . 353975_356275
now from the biology point of view they said several times in there the fact that this same this whole community first of all it was completely decimated by this eruption of lava . 357675_372095
they didn't know that that had happened but when they got there the first time it was decimated . 373555_378315
&~wi I I don't think they used this phrase but it was called the the tube worm barbecue . 379995_383595
I mean everything was &=sound_effect and then what seemed to really surprise them was that within two and a bit years everything was back . 383875_397655
complete community the &~s tube worms the dandelions the crabs the fish dedadedadeda@i . 398285_404105
this whole community living off of bacteria had completely reestablished itself . 404785_410285
ninety percent . 410565_411165
but what he didn't go into was why was this surprising ? 412685_416525
where did it come from also ? 417025_420145
that's why it's surprising . 421145_423125
where the hell did it come from ? 423545_425145
I mean these things are except for the fish which are following the the &-uh tube worms the tube worms don't sorta hike up and march off you know . 426445_436445
they're stuck there they're they're what we call benthic organisms . 437685_441085
they're screwed into the bottom . 442605_443805
they're attached to the rock . 443965_445565
so how the surprising thing is how did they get there ? 447545_453165
I mean +...
I mean this +//. 454645_458605
we're leaping way ahead in the course here because oceanography's all tied up and it's hard to teach anything in a sequential order without jumping back and forth occasionally . 458625_467465
and here we've leaped into the biology part of the course . 468105_470665
but it's a primary question . 471785_473045
yes . 473345_473365
could it happen in a series disaster don't they +//.
the only thing I can think of is kinda maybe how plants have seeds but I don't know if . 473605_481365
that's not a bad idea . 481465_482385
she's talking about seeds well I mean we talk about the &~dan dandelion for instance right ? 483975_488935
I mean we knew how the dandelion reproduces . 489155_491595
affects our lawn and even they've got it what they call an analogy <in the> in the film . 492515_497595
dandelion puts out seeds that are picked up by the wind and blow to your neighbor's lawn . 499455_505835
that's how it works . 508295_509135
and so your suggestion I take it is that the these organisms must do something similar . 511785_517645
the logical +//. 519845_520345
anything it &~i &~i unlike dandelions where they reproduce by putting out these seed floaters &-uh but if you've ever done the battle with dandelions you know that it's also &-uh they have roots that will just if you don't get (th)em out will just regenerate no matter what . 521325_542745
now tube worms don't have that advantage . 544065_545645
they don't have any roots . 545845_546685
you you wipe those guys out and they're gone unless they &~re in &~e in essence reseed . 546865_552565
and so that is really the the working hypothesis that there is some &~s sort_of way of reinfecting this area . 554525_564805
and if you think about it this is a this is a interesting process here . 565865_571025
here we are in the &~di deep ocean with this long linear feature where there are hydrothermal springs spaced out at some distance apart . 572235_584655
sort of like little &{l=SIC oasises &}l=SIC in the desert . 586015_588355
spewing out hot water and bacteria that can form the base of the food chain the organisms that other organisms eat . 589555_597855
and somehow these other organisms the ones that feed on the bacteria find these hot springs and colonize them in a in two years +... 599945_610705
and that's really what is surprising . 611945_617025
because our vision of the deep sea is a place that is dark cold and relatively still . 617645_626445
it's not like thinking about the dandelions where a good strong wind like we've had in the past few days I understand can pick those things up and spread (th)em all over the place . 628925_641105
in the deep ocean we think about currents in general being very slow . 642745_648325
you &~re you remember the films you saw the the bacterial snow it was coming down very gently right ? 648505_655665
there wasn't like it was &=sound_effect in a blizzard a a current . 656565_660945
so whatever motion's down there is not real fast motion +... 662405_665985
well I I'm not claiming &-uh that they know everything about the biology but your hypothesis that somehow these benthic organisms are just throwing seeds little &~s eggs and gametes and immature organisms out into the water and hope that some portion of (th)em land in a place that's suitable . 671125_699725
not on the asphalt not on the sidewalk but on somebody else's lawn . 702345_706465
<that is a> that is a a a biological strategy for recolonizing places or just colonizing places that are suitable . 708925_719085
and you think about that that's that's terribly inefficient . 720045_724545
I mean that means that if you're gonna be really successful you've gotta produce one hell of a_lot_of seeds . 727485_732765
and then you've gotta be prepared to keep those things coming . 734685_738465
because any moment your colony may be wiped out . 739925_742805
but you can infect or establish another colony . 743745_746405
interesting problem . 748065_750345
now that's one of the reasons it was so surprising it was trying to find out I mean and they still have not totally worked this out . 752965_759445
for instance they don't know for sure how long how much variation there is in the age of a particular colony . 760085_767445
how long will one last ? 767885_769045
I mean that was one of the &~th questions they left unanswered . 769265_772705
will it be here next year ? 772805_774325
or the year after . 774365_775245
in the same place or will it everything quiet down the spring sort_of die back and the supply of food diminish and the colony sort_of die off ? 775865_789905
it's one of these questions we really are still investigating . 791085_795065
very expensive to go down there and look for these things . 797085_799685
they can't do it <year after> year after year . 800445_802305
any other questions about the movie ? 806385_807705
what'd you think of it ? 809305_812525
did you like it ? 813045_813665
should I show it again next time ? 814545_816125
yeah I I sorta liked it . 819185_821265
there's so much covered in it though it's real worth talking about it . 823465_826685
geology geophysics predictability at the ridge crests what's going on . 827485_830945
geochemistry that you can actually see the the development of these &-uh chimneys and the water spewing out . 832785_838985
&-uh the metal oxides and iron and manganese mainly &-uh turning the smokers black in places . 840105_845965
and then all that biology . 846445_848585
yeah . 849245_850145
what was the temperature inside that ? 850365_851785
the smoker or whatever . 852285_853465
&~the they said it was three hundred fifty degrees centigrade . 854065_856985
why doesn't that boil ? 857605_858365
I mean .
why doesn't it boil ? 858545_859545
yeah .
+, it's sort &~o it's because of the tremendous pressure down there you know when you &~i you ever been camping at at high altitude ? 860155_867315
and you know how it's really hard to get the damn thing to water to boil ? 868495_873115
+, yeah +/.
+, well it'll boil at a lower temperature because the pressure's lower but the the heat conduction is is not as good either . 873415_879695
so down there under those pressures the water hasta be a_lot hotter to really vaporize to overcome the pressure problem . 880345_888865
it doesn't usually happen . 889925_890825
and there's some there's a tremendous amount of debate &~a as to what the &~up upper limit of temperature in which bacteria can live . 892745_900865
the conventional wisdom right now is somewhere around a hundred and twenty degrees centigrade . 901885_905765
&-um but not being a biologist and not being constrained by conventional wisdom &-um it's not gonna surprise me if they come back in a few years and say well we found (th)em at a hundred and fifty or two hundred . 908765_922625
I mean I don't think there's anything magic about a hundred and twenty frankly . 923665_926285
anyway . 926525_929685
speculation . 930525_930865
now what we've &-uh what we were &~c covering after we finished the sort_of plate tectonics which is a tremendous +... 933245_942085
subject and I could spend the whole course on it but of_course they won't let me do that if I'm teaching introductory oceanography . 945245_951825
take out a piece of paper put your name on it real quick and you've got exactly one minute to give me an answer to a thirty part multiple choice question . 952865_965285
(0.8) yall ready ? 967465_973485
okay . 975185_978545
of the three basic types of +//. 979085_981205
oops I didn't deep sea sediments or sediments of the deep ocean which accumulates accumulates most slowly on the sea floor . 981925_991785
which type accumulates most slowly in general . 992205_995585
now they discuss examples of each of this in each of these types in your reading . 996805_1001325
the &-uh biogenous sediment which comes from the skeleton skeletal material of &~organims isms@n that live in the deep sea the terrigenous sediment that comes off of &-uh land one way or another and the hydrogenous sediment that is sediment that is actually precipitated from sea water as a chemical precipitant . 1002445_1023305
and occurs not just at ridge crests but throughout many parts of the oceans . 1024465_1029005
okay go . 1059855_1059955
one minute .
(0.21) all you need to write is your name ID number and either A B or C or you can write the whole word out if you want .
(0.32) .
is that it or ?
were you joking about the six part thing ? 1091185_1091965
I'm sorry ? 1092245_1092765
were you serious about the six part thing <or not> ? 1093085_1094865
well I mean there's three choices . 1095265_1098305
that's what I meant .
but at first you said we had a six part multiple choices . 1099145_1103285
no thirty part I meant to +//. 1103365_1104525
just three choices . 1105525_1106885
I thought it had six different questions . 1107065_1108045
no no no this is just one question . 1108445_1110185
three choices . 1110505_1111825
okay pass (th)em over . 1112725_1114185
(0.7) I'll do the best I can . 1119785_1120945
(0.7) why don't you <give it> that way . 1122625_1128245
let me get it over here .
I already got yours ? 1148205_1151045
yep .
xxx .
have I got everyone's ? 1151085_1153125
one more over there . 1153885_1154825
<I'll just> run around +...
okay that's everybody's the answer is +... 1156405_1163285
A .
hydrogenous . 1165365_1166385
some of these &-uh manganese nodules and such accumulate at &-uh you know a millimeter per thousand years it's very very slow . 1166505_1175165
we'll go over that in lecture . 1176805_1178325
(0.7) okay +... 1179825_1185305
sediments of the oceans . 1188185_1189045
now why before we go into distribution and names and stuff like that you remember when we were talking about plate tectonics that one of the interesting things about the sediments of the ocean when we started figuring out how thick they were was that they weren't very thick . 1189415_1208155
and so the oceans could only have been accumulating sediment over a relatively short period of time +... 1209075_1214695
and so therefore the ocean basins hadta be young compared to the continents . 1218135_1221855
but these sediments they come from the land they come from the ocean they're blown in by the winds they're carried by currents +... 1224075_1233615
and they're laid down on the sea floor <layer by> <layer by> layer by layer and always I mean this &=laughs is a a big principle of geology is the oldest stuff is always on the bottom . 1235485_1248325
I mean this is pretty self-evident . 1249145_1251105
but it's &-uh called the Law of Superposition . 1252685_1255605
it means stuff on top is younger than stuff underneath . 1256245_1259145
not hard to not hard to buy . 1260305_1262825
but all this stuff coming in see is is it's it's like a record . 1264815_1268355
it's keeping track of what was coming off the continents what was coming down from the ocean what was coming out_of the atmosphere as time went by ever so slowly . 1268975_1281315
it's a a way of exploring the past is to look at these sediments . 1282095_1288535
so when we talk about the various types of sediments and how fast they accumulate you can &~s sort_of translate that into thinking well now what could I learn from these sediments ? 1289375_1299595
if they're coming down very slowly that means &~m my time resolution is gonna not be very high because that means each millimeter only &-uh represents a thousand years +... 1300515_1312675
it's gonna be hard to get much detail out_of that record . 1315375_1318435
but if it's coming down fast so that each millimeter represents a few years then you can get a_lot_of detail . 1318555_1325975
so let's look at the various types . 1326895_1328935
(0.6) and first by by source and these are the ones we talked about this is a fourth type here . 1329915_1341555
not very important . 1342595_1343335
but you have to include it to be complete . 1344405_1346305
terrigenous &~s stuff that's carried to the oceans by rivers and and the wind biogenous shells of organisms that live in the ocean they die and their shells fall to the sea floor hydrogenous minerals that precipitate on the sea floor and then cosmogenous dust and stuff from outer space . 1346805_1368785
(0.5) pretty easy . 1373515_1374355
now the other way of classifying sediment is where do they come from . 1374975_1381155
&-uh where are they deposited . 1381515_1382475
and so if they're deposited close to shore they're called neritic and of_course close to shore means close to continents and so most of that stuff is terrigenous but it will have some biogenic components . 1383195_1395435
that is bits and pieces of things that were actually created by organisms . 1395635_1400535
hemipelagic means sort_of pelagic so let's just skip down to pelagic . 1403095_1406675
pelagic &~ar &~i the word pelagic is from the Greek and it means of the oceans . 1407575_1413575
and so this is where you have your &~biogen biogenous oozes that is the very fine grained sediments composed of microfossils from diatoms and other &-uh plants and animals that have shells . 1414535_1428935
deep sea clays which are the wind borne dust and the hydrogenous sediments and then hydrogenous crust and nodules . 1430515_1438735
solid pieces of &-uh chemical precipitates that formed in the ocean . 1439175_1444155
hemipelagic means a mix of terrigenous material and these other types of material +... 1445535_1451115
now here the varying rates at which &=break_in_recording <here are the> here are the rates at which things come down . 1458275_1466235
on average . 1466655_1467215
&~cl the terrigenous stuff comes in various sizes all the way from very fine &~glain grained clay all the way to sands and it comes in at various rates . 1469995_1477875
five centimeters which is about <two inches> two inches per thousand years up to a_lot more than that . 1477925_1488265
per thousand years . 1489325_1490145
biogenous oozes generally are one to two two centimeters per thousand years . 1490825_1495505
but can get as high as ten centimeters per thousand years in areas that are very biologically productive . 1495965_1503545
that is in which it's +//. 1503765_1505485
the waters are rich with planktonic organisms . 1505555_1509375
and we'll &~s see where those &~ar areas are . 1509935_1512335
and what they call red clay come down at fractions of a centimeter per thousand years . 1512915_1518215
red clay is is just a &~s mostly the &~s hydrogenous and wind blorn blown sediments . 1518675_1524235
and the hydrogenous &-uh a millimeter or less . 1525135_1528355
so the average is somewhere from point two to two centimeters per thousand years . 1529985_1534245
that's not very fast . 1535085_1536125
and so you can see if it were say one centimeter per thousand years somewhere in the middle there if the oldest part of the ocean is like two hundred million years old &-uh a thousand years is ten to the third a million is ten to the sixth so it'd be one times ten to the third centimeters thick on the oldest part of the ocean . 1537745_1564865
that's not very thick +... 1565925_1567165
so &~u usually on the average you expect to &~f find a few hundred meters of sediment . 1568085_1576505
and that is indeed what you do find . 1577305_1579385
now let's talk a little bit about each of these types of sediment . 1580945_1587025
and we'll start with the terrigenous stuff . 1587385_1590185
(0.9) it's very difficult +... 1598495_1599235
to carry sediment out into the ocean very far . 1603675_1608375
if you think about it what happens ? 1609255_1611475
the the rivers flow down to the ocean right ? 1612575_1614435
in general in most places not every place but in most places as you come down from the mountains down through the hills down through the coastal plain the level <or the> or the &-um the steepness of the slope of the river gets lower and lower . 1615465_1632905
and then when it hits the ocean in a way it's like hitting a &~s a rock wall . 1633885_1638405
I mean that it can't go any deeper than that and so the flow stops in terms of river flow . 1638265_1645105
and other processes take over . 1646305_1648045
currents tidal flushing in and out longshore currents wave generated currents things like that will then take that sediment that's delivered by the rivers and move it around a little bit . 1650265_1664185
but it's hard to get it out out far into the ocean . 1665545_1669865
so the terrigenous sediment just tends to pile up around the edges . 1671845_1674985
unless it's carried by the winds . 1676185_1678725
and of_course dust <in the> in the atmosphere can go a long long way . 1679425_1686265
in fact &-uh people have traced dust storms &-uh via satellite well clear across the Atlantic . 1688045_1699145
they can pick up Saharan dust dust from the Sahara desert in the &-uh Caribbean . 1699405_1705465
over clear across the Atlantic in the islands of the Caribbean . 1706325_1709885
they can track dust &~sto storms coming off of the Tibetan plateau easily to Hawaii . 1711475_1716795
so this dust it may not be a_lot_of it and it may be very fine grained but it goes a long way . 1718975_1724735
I'll show you some patterns of its distribution later . 1725155_1728095
so terrigenous sediment dominate the near shore areas where the rivers empty and where there's no river near shore then you get other stuff . 1731355_1740915
you get carbonate reefs in tropical regions because carbonate &-uh the reef growing animals don't like &~m murky water they depend on sunlight to as part of their plant animal interaction . 1742355_1759155
and so they don't like muddy water and they'll grow where there's not in tropical areas where there's not a_lot_of river water coming in . 1760975_1767695
shell debris things like clams and scallops and mussels and stuff like that . 1768075_1773095
sea urchins . 1774235_1774995
all sorts of animals that live in the oceans that produce hard shells can accumulate and actually make sand and other debris like for instance the the sand on the Bermuda islands &~a &~a any of you ever been to Bermuda ? 1775295_1791495
yes .
+, nice place isn't it ? 1793075_1796355
+, yeah +/. 1796375_1796815
+, they're famous for their pink sand &~b beaches and they're all made out_of shell fragments . 1797095_1801295
Bermuda's an old coral reef sticking up there off of North Carolina . 1802985_1806825
and &-uh most and and it's the weathering <of the> of the ancient corals and of the various other &~mo mollusk and sea shells that actually creates the sand on those beaches . 1809045_1819705
glacial debris that's debris carried out by mountain glaciers such as those in &-uh the Rockies that feed into Canada from Canada and Alaska into the Pacific or from &-uh Norway and Northern Canada into the North Atlantic . 1823365_1844265
they can &~j they carry terrigenous sediments to the ocean but once they get there you see it's &~it they can go a little bit further than the rivers (be)cause the ice doesn't melt right away . 1845705_1857965
and it floats off into the ocean drifts around the ocean until it melts and as it melts it gradually drops the sediment that it's picked up along the way when it &~flo flowed down the mountains and across the continent area +... 1858765_1871465
now a couple of years &~ag back I <took a> took a cruise out_of San Diego . 1877455_1884375
headed for Hawaii . 1885615_1886795
and just for the fun of it I measured the maximum sediment thickness as I headed away from the coast and plotted it up here for your amusement . 1888035_1900135
now what it shows is that when you're very close to shore +... 1901455_1907895
the sediment is comparatively thick and then it's very +//. 1911355_1918775
it's uneven because remember there there're lots_of sea mounts and ridges and fractures on it and stuff like that it's uneven in it's distribution but &~i every set bit of distance <I would> I would take another reading and then I plotted it up and you see a general it's sort_of an exponential decay . 1918915_1936395
that it drops off rapidly at first and once we get about a thousand kilometers out from shore then it sort of flattens out . 1937095_1945775
flattens out at about maximum sediment thickness of only about ten meters . 1947035_1954935
even though the crust here close to shore is younger than the crust out here . 1956095_1963555
in other words the crust close to shore has been around a shorter of amount of time than the ocean crust that exists two and a half or two thousand five hundred kilometers offshore . 1963545_1975785
so it's been there a long time could have collected more sediment . 1976705_1980065
but because it has always been far from shore it hasn't . 1980805_1984965
it's actually collected less sediment . 1985825_1988065
because all this terrigenous material just couldn't get out there . 1990475_1993455
(0.20) this is a map of &-uh of a particular mineral called quartz . 2013595_2021035
you guys ever heard of quartz ? 2022055_2024095
yeah it's it's pretty common . 2025375_2026795
it's what most beach sands are made out_of . 2026935_2029635
not Bermuda but . 2029975_2030595
very resistant makes these &~bur beautiful clear crystals you know . 2031435_2035395
see (th)em for sale sometimes . 2036435_2037695
very resistant to &-uh chemical weathering . 2039535_2045955
&-uh very &~r hard mineral . 2047295_2048695
and it's a common mineral in continental rocks but a very uncommon mineral in the crustal rocks of the ocean . 2050035_2062675
the crustal rocks of the oceans have a very very different chemistry and practically no quartz in those crustal rocks . 2063005_2071365
so if you go out into the sediments of the ocean and measure the amount of quartz in those sediments you're looking at stuff that &~a almost certainly came from the continents +... 2071925_2088045
so then <if you> &~s if you do that and then <look at> look at it as a percent of the total sediment that is a percentage of &-uh quartz in the sediment on in terms of weight then you see patterns of quartz distribution that are very far from sort_of even and they're very far from from just exponential decay from the continents like I showed in total sediment thickness . 2093045_2118965
and in general here's what you see . 2119685_2121765
you see a big band across the north the northern oceans here <in the> &~c in the &-uh North Pacific and in the Atlantic . 2122005_2132785
and these this band of quartz is delivered from the continents to the oceans by the winds that blow from west to east . 2133805_2143785
picking up dust and taking it out over the ocean . 2145395_2147935
here are the trade winds . 2148895_2150015
they're blowing off offshore from the east out into the ocean and the Pacific and they carry a little bit of dust that are that is &-uh dominantly quartz . 2152075_2164715
and you see a similar sort_of pattern in the South Pacific but not as clear . 2166135_2170895
here's the Saharan dust coming off the &~S Sahara over here . 2170975_2175055
this is off of Mexico this is off Peru Ecuador . 2175955_2178355
now you do see some river influences here . 2179415_2183655
here's the Ganges Brahmaputra flowing into the Bay of Bengal carrying a_lot_of quartz from the Himalayas . 2183895_2191855
here the +//. 2192335_2192875
some winds coming off the Arabian desert carrying quartz that way . 2193455_2196675
so it's not all windblown some of it comes from rivers . 2196805_2199385
but most of that is windblown material . 2200245_2203065
so right away you can think well if I go out there and sample take a vertical pipe and drive it into the sediment at some place +... 2205045_2216925
say I do it out here +... 2220705_2222745
and I look at the amount of quartz and in the size of the quartz grains back in time what's that gonna tell me ? 2225805_2236105
(0.7) see I'm developing a history of quartz . 2237665_2244005
now how would I interpret that ? 2244225_2245765
I've got going down the the sediment through the sediment back into time and I'll see variation in both the relative amount of quartz collecting at at time and the size of the quartz grains themselves whether they're very very small or just small . 2246295_2266115
what would I deduce from that ? 2267035_2270615
would that give you a measure of the wind direction and the strength over time ? 2271095_2274055
direction and what ? 2275975_2276895
the the velocity or ? 2277475_2279195
yeah . 2279395_2279615
the size will give you an idea of how vigorous the wind was . 2280815_2285095
faster the wind the bigger the size . 2286435_2287855
right away that tells you something about past climates . 2288615_2291635
how how much activity the wind had . 2292955_2295475
now what would the abundance tell you ? 2297375_2298875
yes . 2298975_2299235
like if a continent +//. 2299695_2301975
how close was that spot to the continent as the as it progressed because because when the continent was closer to that particular part of the the sea larger grains could get there because it was a shorter distance and then as it moved away smaller grains could collect +/.
mhm +/.
+, because they were carried by the wind . 2318615_2319675
it's all very very logical and &-um but not quite right . 2320255_2325515
&~n no points off . 2325855_2327975
&=laughs no it's a good idea . 2329125_2329705
and if you just if you get very close to land it's absolutely right on . 2331045_2334445
if you're within a thousand kilometers within that band of where terrigenous sediments can come in by rivers too what you say is correct that the the size <and the> &-uh and the rate is &-uh very dependent on the vigor of the stuff and the proximity to a &~c &-uh vigor of the transport and the proximity to continent . 2334705_2354525
but if you get this far out out in the middle of the ocean the dust that gets out that far hasta be injected very high up into the atmosphere . 2354965_2364425
and so by the time it starts going out over the ocean the the very coarse stuff falls out very fast . 2365565_2373065
and so it's it it mixes in the atmosphere and has almost a constant grain size of the finer end except it is influenced by how vigorously it was thrown up to start with . 2373525_2383885
so if there're big dust storms throwing lots_of stuff up you'll get a little coarser material out here in the middle . 2384725_2390725
now what about the abundance with time what's that gonna tell you ? 2392465_2395465
if it's only from the wind +... 2395945_2398085
you were close . 2401585_2402285
what what we think it tells us is that the more dust you get it must mean something about how arid the source of that dust was . 2402765_2415545
I mean if it was lush forests everywhere it's hard to get dust right ? 2415745_2419445
but if it's like a desert like the Gobi desert or something out there it's easy to get dust . 2420345_2425045
and so the more dust in general per unit time you can think of it being the more arid the climate . 2426965_2435225
generally . 2435605_2435985
there are some exceptions to that but in general the size tells you about the vigor and the relative rate at which it comes in tells you something about the aridity of the climate . 2436665_2449025
(0.6) interesting thing about the dust record up here is that both the &~s size and the accumulation rate is very low up until about eight million years ago . 2455685_2470405
and then it kicks up and goes back down again and then it kicks up again about two and a half no about three and half four million years ago . 2470985_2478565
and this was very puzzling why it should do that . 2480425_2484445
why there should be big changes . 2484625_2485825
and what we think it is is that it's all tied up into the +... 2487125_2493685
how'd I get this thing on backwards ? 2497845_2498945
no wonder I couldn't tell what was going on . 2499105_2503265
we think it hasta do with the creation of the Tibetan plateau when when &-uh India plowed into the southern Asia it lifted up the Himalayas lifted up the Tibetan plateau and it created all this high altitude dry area behind the Himalayas .
that just generated the Gobi desert was created and it was an area where you got lots_of dust and vigorous winds . 2518385_2526945
and we'll come back to that when we talk about atmospheric circulation . 2527985_2530985
but what we think that dust record is out here in the &~Nor North Pacific is a record of the development of the Himalayan and Tibetan plateau . 2531765_2542065
so it's a history of how plate tectonics the movements of continents has changed climate . 2542985_2551705
interesting history . 2555125_2555825
(0.5) now here's a &-uh figure <from your> from your text . 2556965_2564965
and it shows in a very general way the distribution of calcareous sediments . 2566285_2576125
red clay hydrogenous sediments and siliceous oozes . 2578525_2583805
calcareous and siliceous lets talk about for a minute here these jargon terms again . 2584105_2588925
anybody know what siliceous is ? 2590325_2592225
you know what does that what does that mean . 2592605_2593845
silicate ?
pardon ? 2594505_2596265
silica or silicate ? 2596465_2597345
yeah &~s it's got silica in it . 2597565_2599205
you know the element silica siliceous there are a_lot_of organisms that that &~sh that live in the ocean they live in lakes too for that matter but that actually precipitate SIO two &~sili silica dioxide as a shell . 2599825_2615885
sometimes it's called opaline silica because it doesn't have a real crystal structure . 2616885_2621425
it's like glass . 2622405_2623565
like window glass . 2624025_2624565
it's &~no window glass is not a crystal it's SIO two that has cooled rapidly from a melt of sand and a few other little chemicals and created this perfectly clear pane almost pure SIO two and organisms build their &~sh shells out_of much the same material . 2625835_2644355
calcareous .
what does that you know what the chemistry of that is ? 2646255_2649575
anyone who yes sir . 2650175_2651415
calcium . 2652715_2652815
calcium . 2653415_2655095
primary positive side <of the> of the equation .
it's calcium carbonate that is CA CO three . 2660515_2664875
calcium carbonate and that's what you always see when you see a clam shell . 2665755_2669635
or a a mollusk of any type . 2670835_2673815
what you see when you see coral reefs . 2675135_2677115
there're a_lot a_lot_of organisms that build their shells out_of calcium carbonate . 2680445_2683085
and there are a_lot_of organisms that are planktonic that is single cell floaters that just live out in the upper layers of the ocean all over the world and produce their little teeny one millimeter and less sized shells out_of calcium carbonate . 2683785_2699005
now if you look at this distribution you'll see there's a_lot_of calcium carbonate in the Atlantic . 2699765_2706625
there's a little bit of red &~ca clay . 2707295_2709335
red clay is usually defined where there's not much calcium carbonate and there's not much &~bioge biogenic silica in the sediment that's all that's left . 2709755_2719195
so calcium carbonate all over here all over there all over the South Pacific but not much in the North Pacific . 2720635_2727755
we'll come back to this . 2728115_2730695
mostly red clay there . 2730895_2732195
now here &~th look where the siliceous oozes are . 2732655_2734715
there's a bit up here in the far North Pacific and it dominates the Antarctic region . 2734935_2743455
(0.6) we're gonna explore in the next lecture what controls these distributions . 2745095_2755795
but let me just make it clear about one thing . 2756255_2758255
what this is is it's telling you what the dominant sediment type is . 2758415_2762755
it doesn't mean to say there's no biogenic silica in this blue area it's just that it's mostly calcium carbonate . 2763345_2771665
it doesn't say there's not any clay in this gray area it's mostly siliceous &~oo oozes . 2772305_2779885
so it's what dominates . 2781865_2783025
that's what this map shows . 2783185_2784245
now it also shows manganese nodules which are hydrogenous sediments . 2784405_2789165
and they usually occur where &~sedi because they precipitate very slowly they usually occur in red clay areas or on bare rock where other things are accumulating very slowly as well . 2789665_2804365
it's hard for them to accumulate if they get buried . 2804945_2808285
so it you usually find manganese nodules and other sorts of things that are chemical precipitates like that &~hydro &-uh hydrogenous sediments in areas of very low sediment accumulation . 2809545_2821085
(0.5) now let's we've now covered the types of sediments and we'll come back to some of (th)em in detail but let's start with the terrigenous sediment first . 2822025_2835525
and remember I said that this sediment is carried to the oceans by rivers . 2837915_2843495
but what happens to it next is a very interesting part of oceanography +... 2844555_2851295
we're gonna talk about waves later on when we talk about physical oceanography but you all know from going to the beach that waves are very energetic things . 2851735_2865935
I mean they've got a_lot_of energy associated with them . 2866525_2869705
energy that can erode beaches and cut into cliffs and carry houses away and dump your boat upside down . 2870785_2878045
so these are very active agents in stirring up and eroding sediment . 2879485_2885025
there're also currents tidal currents in the oceans moving moving water back and forth and anything that's suspended in that water will go with it +... 2887625_2897685
and they will continue to move it about until whatever's suspended settle out_of suspension by gravity . 2902325_2907845
now while the sediment is in suspension +... 2909445_2912945
it actually adds its density to the density of water . 2918485_2922065
and when you know the density of rock even in the finest particle clays is more than twice as dense as water so if you're adding this suspension of clay to its density to the density of water you're really creating a fluid that is denser than water . 2922205_2940085
muddy water is denser than clean water . 2941085_2944725
to put it in very simple terms . 2945925_2948505
so if that's true then sediments in suspension may actually flow as a separate dense liquid . 2950185_2960885
and we can observe that happening &-uh especially during storms &~wh which have stirred up a_lot_of water and a_lot_of sediment from the bottom created this muddy water and this &~mo muddy water can flow out across &~any even the gentlest of slopes across this the outer shelf over the shelf edge down the slope and out onto the continental rise as literally turbid rivers of water . 2963845_2992425
it's salt water it's got clay in it it's denser than the sea water around it and it flows as a separate fluid carrying this sediment out . 2992815_3002875
and that's how much of this &~terre terrigenous sediment gets out so far . 3003055_3009115
it can get out up to about a thousand kilometers away <from the> &~s from the shore line and much of this is through these turbid flows . 3010855_3022475
(0.8) now remember we +//. 3024395_3030895
I think earlier on in these &-uh courses we talked about sea level changes right ? 3031355_3036315
remember that ? 3037115_3037675
and how much did I say that &-uh sea level could change between a glacial interglacial period ? 3039345_3044245
you remember ? 3045545_3045825
it'll be on an exam so you better remember eventually . 3047025_3049585
could you say the question again ? 3049825_3050465
huh ? 3050465_3050605
what's the question again ? 3050785_3051785
how <when we> &~ha when we had an ice age twenty thousand years ago how &~mu and we took water out_of the oceans and put it onto land to form these big ice sheets how much of that removal of water from the ocean onto the ice sheets will lower sea level ? 3052025_3068085
&~sev seventy meters ?
Dave ?
a hundred and twenty meters ? 3068385_3071025
spot on . 3071025_3073105
a hundred and twenty meters . 3073285_3074165
right down to the shelf edge . 3074425_3076445
remember ? 3077305_3077325
that was a +//. 3077485_3077885
that's where we brought it up . 3078185_3078985
why is the shelf edge at a hundred and thirty meters ? 3078865_3081285
well it might have something to do with the fact that we lowered sea levels down to a hundred and twenty meters thirty &-uh twenty to a thirty thousand years ago . 3081505_3092305
so let's let's look at the model of what happens there . 3094365_3098665
now the <this is> &~t this is a cartoon but it's pretty accurate where you view +//. 3100405_3105445
here's the edge of the continent here in these little blocks . 3106465_3108965
you can think of this continent initially rifting apart with sea floor spreading starting to subside as it cools . 3109605_3115865
and here the rivers are starting to flow into it and of_course they start dropping their sediment pretty fast but it does flow out with turbidites and stuff and it starts building up this pile like this . 3117165_3128685
and this pile looks like what we see now . 3129005_3132405
here's here's the shelf here's the &~s shelf edge there's the slope and it just builds up and out as the edge of the continent gradually cools and subsides . 3132545_3144385
you with me +..? 3145545_3145925
up here here's the beach somewhere it's stirring up the sediment and moving it off a little bit down the slope . 3147905_3157145
and then we drop sea level with an ice age +... 3158025_3160205
now this is what I was talking about suddenly the rivers that were originally dumping their stuff up here somewhere are winding their way across this old shelf and dumping their load right out on this steeper slope . 3164015_3178775
and so what happens is it starts to build out another bit of shelf here . 3180015_3184935
the part in the dark shading +... 3186315_3187815
sea level rises again this floods back and you get another area of buildup slowly out to the edge . 3191905_3202785
so if you had repeated sea level rises and falls which we have over the last few million years then you'd see this whole thing repeated <again and> again and again . 3203505_3213825
and you can see a whole series of big progradations big building out then small packages and then big ones over the top and then another small one and so on all the way out until off the east coast of the US where this has been going on for a hundred and forty million years as we calculated in our exam the width here today is a hundred miles or so +... 3213885_3241365
huge broad shelf . 3244095_3245535
(0.10) now +... 3246635_3256275
you might think if you've ever had &-uh hadta try and &-uh decant stuff that is let very fine grained sediment and muddy water settle out like if you go camping and the lake water's a little muddy and you'd sorta like to drink it but you'd prefer it to be &-uh something you could see through before you'd put it down your gullet +... 3258925_3284785
then you might sit around if you didn't have a filter mechanism with you which would be the best way to do it to filter it out you might just let it settle out . 3288495_3295555
to do that in most lake waters you'd wait quite a while . 3296515_3300695
you could build up a thirst . 3300855_3301875
it takes a long time to settle it out . 3302695_3305735
and the reason I bring that up is you might think that the very fine grained stuff even though I've told you it can't go more than a thousand kilometers you might suspect it could really go further than that if it &~ke kept stirred up in all the waves all the time . 3307835_3321835
but lemme show you what really happens +... 3322815_3324335
that's the settling rate of measured scientifically measured +... 3327455_3333755
of a clay particle +... 3336115_3337415
in water . 3340315_3340695
ten point five times ten to the minus four centimeters every second . 3343495_3348655
now the average depth of the ocean to the nearest thousand meters is four thousand meters or four times ten to the tenth &~ce centimeters . 3349155_3359615
and so if we calculate how long it would take for a clay particle to settle by normal settling techniques or normal settling processes you can figure out that that settling rate divided into four thousand meters or four times ten to the fifth centimeters ends up with a three hundred eighty million seconds or equivalent to twelve almost twelve and a half years . 3360345_3390065
to settle out . 3392025_3392785
now most ocean currents near the edges of continents we'll talk about later but let's just say they a good fast one will be &~r moving at something under a knot but say say half a knot . 3394305_3410085
that means half a mile an hour . 3411485_3413245
half a nautical mile an hour . 3413625_3414905
you can go a long way at that speed in twelve years . 3417145_3420245
and in fact you could go across the ocean no trouble at all in twelve years . 3422045_3427905
so you would expect from just this simple calculation that a clay particle dumped into the Chesapeake Bay carried out into the ocean could make it to Spain without any trouble at all . 3429065_3443985
and that when you look at the clay &~min &-uh clays all over the world's ocean they they'd be very &~f broadly distributed . 3444945_3452825
when in fact they're not . 3454445_3455465
so what's going on ? 3456125_3457125
(0.7) it took twelve years for it to sink to the bottom . 3458505_3465345
well it just doesn't happen that way . 3465885_3467305
it doesn't go out there and just float around and gradually sink down get stirred up occasionally gets down to the bottom and gets deposited . 3468345_3476485
what happens is +... 3477765_3478865
biology that's what happens +... 3479765_3483525
what an uninteresting world this would be if we didn't have biology . 3486825_3490225
biology sticks its active nose in almost every &~f part of this world . 3492235_3500595
and this is no different . 3502215_3502995
have what we call filter feeders . 3504855_3506895
you know what a filter feeder is ? 3508015_3509295
I bet you can imagine . 3509975_3511895
take a guess . 3512555_3513115
what do you think Rebecca +..? 3513195_3513935
xxx sediments <something like that> bottom feeders xxx .
&~the they're nonselective eaters . 3523925_3525725
it's like my son . 3526625_3527345
anything that comes by (th)em &=sound_effect they eat it . 3529605_3533445
now there're all sorts of filter feeders . 3534585_3536265
Rebecca Becca talked about the bottom filter feeders which just go in and just eat mud . 3536485_3542565
anything that's in the mud that they can digest they digest it and they excrete the rest . 3543205_3547645
are these like when I was reading today it was saying like something to that extent but wouldn't it also be kinda like they get a_lot_of these particles like that they ate other things or something ? 3549835_3558155
like it wouldn't be it wouldn't necessarily be a filter feeder but what if another fish ate another fish ⌈ <and then the particle's gone> ⌉ ? 3558815_3563475
⌊ oh yeah <you can> <you can> you can ⌋ send it up the food chain for sure . 3563475_3567555
but down right above the plants which is which are the base of the food chain and the surface ocean there are a_lot_of small planktonic &~or organisms who do nothing but rake through the ocean with these arms with little hairs on (th)em and grab anything that's there . 3568545_3589005
anything at all . 3590425_3590905
and it's just like the bottom feeders that Rebecca mentioned they ingest it anything they can digest they do anything they can't cannot they excrete . 3591815_3601855
and in fact +... 3602335_3603075
I mean &-uh <if it's> if it's really rich and everything is &-uh plentiful they often don't even digest it all . 3604955_3612815
they just eat it and excrete it . 3613835_3615495
pull out a little bit of it . 3616995_3618835
now . 3621325_3621565
what happens then this clay gets out there and <it gets> it gets treated just like it was a diatom or some other plant and it's filtered out_of the ocean literally filtered out just like the zebra mussels in the Great Lakes are filtering the clays out_of that we're seeing the bottom of the Great Lakes now where we've never seen it before . 3621705_3645045
because these are very +//. 3646005_3646985
the zebra mussels are very efficient bottom living filter feeders filtering the water not the mud but it's very effective . 3647115_3655275
and what happens ? 3655995_3656515
well filter it out put it in little turds and you excrete it as bigger particles and the big particles sink fast +... 3656675_3664555
that's why you don't see this clay dispersed all over the world's ocean . 3668055_3673155
the way they prove this I told you earlier that that &-uh war and and &-uh military establishment often has side effects that are informative . 3674235_3686915
they discovered this because they started picking up after the bomb tests of the fifties and early sixties they could pick up dust particles from these explosions that had reached four thousand meters down to the bottom of the middle of the ocean within weeks of the explosion +... 3688835_3712035
it was a clear demonstration that this dust even though it was very fine did not settle as individual particles but settled as little baggies . 3714915_3727215
of particles . 3728955_3729575
including dust the remains of organisms that were filtered out in the upper ocean and excreted to the bottom . 3730415_3738595
and that way what we do is preserve patterns in the oceans that exist on the sea floor . 3740675_3748215
things that come into the ocean and live in the ocean and they die they're usually eaten or eaten before they die excreted and where they live is where you find them on the bottom . 3748975_3759695
where the dust is transported and falls &~o into the ocean go down there's where you'll find it . 3761755_3767515
that's why those patterns of quartz are clear . 3768425_3771985
they're sharp . 3773525_3774005
they fell into the surface of the ocean they were filtered out by organisms excreted to the sea floor . 3774605_3781185
good place to stop . 3782345_3784045
I'll see you folks &-uh on next Tuesday have a nice weekend . 3784865_3789245
can I ask a just quick question about that ? 3791085_3792905
sure . 3792945_3793205
+, it would seem like like so you're saying it would take a shorter amount of time for stuff to settle ? 3793405_3797825
but wouldn't it have to reach the bottom first before the bottom eaters . 3798285_3828265
