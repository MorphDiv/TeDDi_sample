okay . 0_522
but alright . 522_1588
what we're gonna talk about today are the three shapes you see here
a little more space between them . 7833_9304
and to help us talk about xxx +/. 9304_11811
and we'll call this one shape C „ okay ? 11811_15139
just so that if someone says +"/. 15139_16878
+" well ‡ I think that that one &=points:board . 16878_19445
and we're gonna go +"/. 19445_20019
+" which one ? 20019_20650
+" what are you talking about ? 20650_21615
okay . 21615_21812
so ‡ just to help us know what other people are talking about or
(be)cause someone might say +"/. 27847_29158
+" well ‡ the skinny one . 29158_30334
a_lot_of you might think +"/. 30334_31364
+" well ‡ maybe this was the skinny point &=points:a . 31364_33403
but maybe someone is saying +"/. 33403_34760
+" no no no I think this one is skinny too so which skinny one are
just to help us know what everyone's looking at . 38326_41071
okay ? 41071_41905
alright ‡ I want you to look at those three shapes A B and C . 41905_48374
I have quilts . 48374_49404
and I have part done . 49404_50610
and that's what you see here &=points:shape_a . 50610_51440
that's A . 51440_51943
and then I started a part here . 52290_53688
&=points:shape_b and that's this part here that we're calling B . 53688_56148
&=points:shape_c and I've started a third quilt . 56141_57775
and I have this much sewn together . 57775_59611
and that's the shape we're gonna call C . 59611_62264
and I'm working on three quilts at once . 62264_64529
and I have some done on each of those quilts . 64529_67495
but when I sewed my patches together when I started sewing the
what I want us to talk about is how much space each of those shapes
okay ? 86886_88071
if you think about how much space shape A covers and how much space
www . 97923_99125
any others ? 99125_100024
xxx . 100024_101027
what do you think Mike . 101027_102103
A ? 102103_102838
you think A covers more space than B and C ? 102838_107291
or just maybe more than one of them . 107291_109435
+< yes . 107291_108142
+< yes ‡ it does . 108645_109795
it does ? 109795_110579
nothing . 112248_112871
he has two what ? 112871_114072
squares . 114229_115037
xxx when you covered them +... 115037_117081
if you had the quilt and &+y you instead of having two squares
what do you mean Becky when you say that B has two squares ? 126165_129460
what kind of squares are you talking about ? 129460_131959
this one . 131959_132899
+< no ‡ I know which one B is . 132399_133797
right there &=points:middle_b . 133797_135036
I know it's equal . 138631_140645
xxx . 140645_141611
well ‡ <I can> I can fold this shape if that will help you see
well ‡ Becky ‡ so ‡ you have two shapes like that now „ right ? 148550_153051
&+w how does that help you know whether A covers more space than B ?
www . 158785_160286
can you make pieces or shapes this size &=points:halves out of A ? 160286_164826
yes . 164826_165853
yes . 165853_166758
yes . 166758_167326
no . 167621_168199
yes . 168199_168633
Stephanie ‡ tell me what you're thinking . 169057_170722
xxx pieces . 170722_173633
+< on A we could like cut off half of this &=points:a and then put
&=points:a and then cut out another half and <put it> &=points:b
and then cut off another half &=points:b and put it right here . 183681_186679
hm I'm a_little confused . 186679_187852
you just talked about I think three halves . 187852_190177
how many parts do you wanna make from A ? 190177_193485
three . 193485_194318
to cover B ? 194318_195552
two . 195552_196195
three . 196195_197222
three ? 197222_197986
so ‡ would those be halves ? 197986_199470
+< no ‡ two &=fingers:two . 199000_199826
two ? 199826_200619
you want me to divide A into two equal pieces ? 200619_203906
you couldn't do it . 203906_205098
okay . 204806_205438
yes ‡ I can . 205438_206472
+< (be)cause that would be three . 205638_207032
+< now ‡ Becky ‡ I can do just what I did &=folds:a . 206472_208407
yeah ‡ but it wouldn't be a square . 207032_209406
&-um did I say anything about being a square ? 209406_213272
no ? 213272_213939
(be)cause these aren't finished quilts „ are they ? 213939_215708
they're just parts of quilts . 215708_217406
so ‡ does Stephanie doesn't have to make this . 217406_219609
now ‡ what's your idea Steph ? 219609_220846
thanks Beck . 220846_221643
+< so ‡ half would go here . 220846_223155
+< okay . 222155_223291
and then &=points:b xxx . 223155_226312
+< well ‡ I'm not gonna cut these or anything . 225812_227832
but let's see if +//. 227832_228731
Stephanie says that half covers that . 228731_232465
and if we took the other half and put it there +... 232465_235831
there . 235831_236933
huh . 236933_237568
so what does that mean ? 237568_239266
it means they're the same . 239266_241299
the same what ? 241299_242465
same size . 242465_243130
same size . 243130_244101
hm . 244101_246538
they covered +... 246538_248201
what did you say ? 248201_249506
they cover up the same space . 249506_250937
they cover up the same space ? 250937_252273
<how can they> how can they look so different and cover the same
they can't . 256741_257740
yes ‡ they can . 257740_259192
Ryan's troubled by that . 259192_261465
he's looking at shape A and shape B . 261465_264228
and he's saying that they look very different . 264228_267392
is Ryan is right when he says that shape A and shape B look very
+< yes . 269000_269593
+< they look very different (be)cause one's skinny and one's like
if you cutted that &+um +... 275074_277579
are you thinking xxx ? 280201_281353
B . 281053_281449
B ? 281449_282235
+< if you cut part of it off it would just look like C . 281449_285088
so ‡ Ryan thinks that if we cut part of B off we could make it look
yes ‡ you could . 290089_291013
+< shh . 290513_291522
you can use <the other> the bottom or the top to put it right
+< no . 293013_294024
you couldn't do it on C too . 295813_297789
+< Ryan . 296789_297789
tell me more about that idea . 297789_299464
<what part> what part of B would you cut off ? 299464_302760
alright ‡ come up and show me . 302760_304194
well +... 304194_305465
he doesn't even know what he's talking about . 305465_307545
right ? 307045_307506
yes ‡ he does . 307506_308645
it's his idea . 308645_309565
he knows best what he's talking about . 309565_311328
&-um maybe here &=points:b_middle we'd need to cut +/. 311328_314750
+< so ‡ if I cut it right where in half ? 314250_316483
+< if we cut it off like how much that has xxx cut off it would be
like <if we> &-um if we &-uh like +//. 321591_325446
yeah ‡ if you look at that one it's the same as that one . 325246_328387
&-uh you mean if we fold this one &=points:c in half ? 328387_330422
no ‡ I mean this one . 330422_331926
if we &-um +/. 331926_333434
+< yeah ‡ but then there would be two folds on it . 333234_336128
+< &=points:child shh . 334234_335005
this is Ryan's idea . 336128_337868
just a second . 337868_338495
he's trying to explain . 338495_339592
he thinks that he can make B +//. 339592_343376
I don't know . 343376_344009
what do you think ? 344009_344583
do you think you can make B look like C ? 344583_347510
if you cut part away xxx +/. 347510_350574
+< okay . 350074_350408
well ‡ show me where I would need to cut . 350408_352038
do you need to see this &=holds:b on top of here ? 352038_354185
yeah . 354185_355347
xxx . 355347_358348
alright ‡ maybe &-um right here &=points:b . 358348_362678
yeah ? 362678_363485
and then all you would have to do is we'd have to put something here
and now &+t see ? 371805_374008
&-um <if you> if you didn't cut this part off &=points:b down
if you had some parts going down there it would look like that one .
what if we move it so there's only space showing on one part of it ?
what if we move it like that ? 389308_391578
I don't know . 391578_392050
do you think B and C are the same size ? 392050_394086
or do you think B is bigger than C ? 394086_396230
+< no . 394086_395060
+< then you could take half just a little bit of A and put it
oh ‡ well ‡ you have to think about shape B all by itself and shape
so ‡ you couldn't use pieces of A to make B cover C (be)cause then
okay ? 413966_414937
Ryan ‡ good ideas . 414937_417314
thanks for sharing that . 417314_418277
so ‡ Ryan's pretty convinced . 418277_420213
he doesn't know exactly how he would do it . 420213_422189
but he thinks maybe we could make shape B look like shape C . 422189_427024
does anyone agree with Ryan ? 427024_428690
they think he's got an idea there that the more they think about it
or maybe you can tell me some of the thinking you were doing about
does anyone agree with Ryan that maybe shape B could be made to look
Christopher ‡ what are you thinking ? 442910_444369
0 . 444369_456552
I'll get this out of your way . 456552_457734
if you cut this in +//. 457734_459955
no ‡ you let me cut . 459955_461551
you can move it anywhere you need to . 461551_468024
would it be easier if we took that clip off ? 468024_474261
I'm gonna put them both together . 474261_476344
&-um yeah . 476344_477479
0 . 477479_480578
xxx ? 480578_482501
okay ‡ so ‡ what Chris has done is he's lined up the edge of shape B
+< and then you cut the leftover that was xxx this . 487022_492813
and then you cut it in half . 492813_495089
+< mhm . 492813_493445
and then you put one half of it like this . 495089_497916
okay . 497916_498821
the other half like xxx . 498821_500700
I'm gonna use my &+pi piece of chalk to show you what Craig
+< I know what he's saying . 502000_504004
well ‡ good . 504004_504659
keep watching . 504659_505553
Chris says if we cut it here +//. 505553_507769
do you see how I'm that would make it even with the bottom ? 507769_510590
and then what would we have to do with this piece . 510590_514676
mkay . 514676_517712
well ‡ that's imagine that that's exactly in half . 517712_520544
and then what would we do with those pieces ? 520544_523022
xxx take this one and we'd place it kind_of on the top half of this
uhhuh . 530001_530501
and I taped the other one over here . 530501_533326
so ‡ they would fit +... 533326_536554
I'm just trying to see where half of that is . 536554_538826
<they would> one would fit here ? 538826_542012
and one would fit here ? 542012_543211
yeah ‡ I think . 543211_544244
okay . 544244_545011
so ‡ think try to think about Chris's idea . 545011_547777
Chris thinks that if we cut it here this &+mar much would be covered
if we took the part that was leftover and divided it exactly in half
xxx . 559630_561751
okay . 561751_562519
Andy ‡ what are you thinking about any of these shapes ? 562519_565088
I don't xxx . 565088_568888
we'll talk about that in just a second . 568888_571032
that would be great . 571032_571905
I'd love to hear that idea . 571905_573076
+< can we put this in the middle ? 572076_573510
okay ‡ yep . 573510_574189
let's let's separate our shapes again . 574189_576806
xxx . 576806_578716
+, do or make B into C . 578716_580974
make them look the same . 580974_582403
what would that mean about B and C ? 582403_584741
xxx . 584741_587879
a big fat +... 587879_590014
&-um B just was &-uh <a little bit> &-uh a little bit not fat as
okay ‡ so ‡ Stephanie's saying that B is not quite as fat as C . 601614_606600
but it's a little bit longer . 606600_608470
and you can take <some scraps> some parts from it and make it
well ‡ we can make B into C . 615574_617670
with Chris's way would there be any leftovers ? 617670_620504
no . 620504_621506
so ‡ what does that say about shape B and shape C ? 621506_625060
they're xxx . 625060_627627
+< &-um <B's used all> xxx shape up to make C . 626827_633260
so ‡ what would that make +//? 633260_635137
does that mean anything then about shapes B and C ? 635137_637661
yeah . 637661_638664
are shapes B and C the same or are they different ? 641664_645031
they're different in a way . 645031_647770
+< they're different . 647070_648821
but they go together . 647770_649968
+< but <if they> &+di but if we did Chris's idea it would
it would be the same ? 654889_655937
but <are they> is there anything about them that's the same if
no . 660921_662256
yes . 662256_663131
what yeah ‡ what do you think is the same about B and C if we
+< instead of changing xxx . 668333_671139
well ‡ they're both xxx two shapes with the two &+s small sides and
+< okay ‡ what do we call those shapes ? 679013_680713
xxx . 680713_682683
mm close . 682683_683686
+< rectangles . 683486_684817
+< rectangles ? 683886_685151
okay ‡ is Ben right ? 685151_686300
is shape B and shape C are they both rectangles ? 686300_689950
yeah . 689750_690383
okay . 690383_691390
+< yes ‡ and so is shape A . 690690_692491
+< so is shape A &=points:a ? 692091_693314
okay ‡ so ‡ that's something we found that's +//. 693314_695488
+< yeah . 693314_694016
+< no . 694016_694960
yeah . 695488_696054
I don't know . 696054_696614
is shape A a rectangle ? 696614_698089
no . 698089_698931
yes . 698931_699522
xxx . 699522_705141
okay . 705141_706625
Andy ‡ you're being real patient . 706625_707924
hold on . 707924_708661
Becky ‡ I'm gonna try to xxx . 708661_710567
maybe if you see the whole thing it'll help us talk about it . 710567_713479
&-um +... 713479_714801
well ‡ it's a big rectangle if it's not a rectangle . 714801_717327
if you call it a rectangle it's a big one ? 717327_719645
okay . 719645_720037
but Becky something's making you maybe not want to call it a
what what makes it not look like a rectangle to you ? 724684_728833
well ‡ it's really long . 728833_730281
xxx shorter . 730281_733436
so you think B looks more like a rectangle to you than A does ? 733436_739057
does C look more like a rectangle than A does ? 739057_742507
I think C looks like a square . 742507_745336
you think C looks like a square . 745336_747671
could C be a square ? 747671_749440
maybe . 749440_750607
well ‡ maybe yeah . 750607_753444
yeah ? 753444_755411
is there a way we could test to see to find out if C is a square ? 755411_761276
I like the way you guy are talking about these shapes . 761276_764359
but could you listen to the ideas that we're sharing and then save
Tim ‡ what's your idea ? 769099_770366
we could make &=points:c &-um C a square . 770366_773436

+< oh . 2287604_2288884
she just divided the strip into four equal parts . 2288884_2291827

how we splitted all of into A . 2413642_2415909
all of them ? 2415909_2416643
and so we how we could turn B into A and C into A . 2416643_2419942

I thought we couldn't <turn A into xxx> turn A into C . 2419243_2423977

that's four . 2466888_2467556

one was then when we came over here we found out that we already

right . 2494056_2494823
Tom ‡ share your idea . 2494823_2496488

right down the middle ? 2629294_2631047

and then I'd just put xxx here . 2641875_2645652
hm . 2645652_2647832

xxx . 2680668_2682316
four . 2682316_2682837
and what would you do with those four parts ? 2682837_2684600
these I'd put here this one here this one here and this one here
okay ‡ so ‡ if you could make C into B what does that say to you
+< they're the same xxx . 2695724_2697139
&-um they take up the same amount of space . 2697139_2699621

so ‡ if I had started quilt B and quilt C both <am I> &+fir am
no . 2707966_2708726
no ‡ not if I'm trying to make two quilts that are the same size . 2708726_2711530
good ideas Macaela . 2711530_2713262
and A too right . 2714062_2715364
but when we first looked at them lots_of you thought that

a_lot_of you thought that C &+ha I had the most done with C

okay ? 2733022_2734156
Jordan ‡ you haven't been here for the last couple days . 2734156_2736129

&-um we can &-um make them all into the same and change B to A or C
yeah . 2756290_2757039
and that was surprising „ wasn't it ? 2757039_2758405
that was interesting . 2758405_2759888
so ‡ do shapes have to look the same to cover the same amount of

no ‡ they don't . 2765762_2767361
Stephanie ‡ go ahead with your idea . 2767361_2768659
thanks for raising your hand . 2768659_2770092
you you can make C into B . 2770092_2773129
then you could just take these four and then put one there and there
+< mhm . 2780834_2781362
right . 2783505_2784617
xxx I noticed that this one right now is folded so_that there's four

fold in half first . 2822249_2823937
and then fold it in half again and ended up with a rectangle like

exactly . 2836755_2838960
+< xxx like this . 2836755_2838960
and you had the whole that &-uh A out like that . 2838960_2844113

you made your thinkers work xxx . 2932952_2934733
what I'm gonna let you do is try this for yourself . 2934733_2937731
try taking twelve squares that are all the same size . 2937731_2942483
and &+fir which one of these do you think is the easiest to build

you &+go if I gave you twelve squares and said build one of
what do you think Katie ? 2965366_2966500
A . 2966500_2968301
why ? 2968301_2968716
because &-um you don't xxx fold it . 2968716_2972570
like and kind_of squares xxx . 2972570_2977879
you can make it kind_of thin . 2977879_2980703

okay ‡ what I'm gonna +//. 2989478_2990342
Holly ‡ what do you think ? 2990342_2991711
I think C is the easiest because you only have to put three &-uh in

okay ‡ what I'm gonna have you do +/. 3010529_3012564
+< I see the easiest is A . 3012064_3013961
why ? 3013961_3014771
well ‡ because it's thin and you'll only need four parts . 3014771_3021244
<you need to> you need four parts to make A ? 3021244_3023878
so ? 3023878_3024711
no . 3024711_3027360
what did I say I wanted you to build these shapes with ? 3027260_3029925

but &-um <they would have> you would have to use twelve
