should we talk . 510_860
it's not right . 950_1320
should we talk about like these last three slides . 1540_3630
should we even mention that . 3890_4750
should we include that for tomorrow . 7480_9380
I think we should keep the risk . 11200_12380
but implementation strategy . 14040_15020
I think we can get rid of . 15200_16020
well wait . 18120_18380
don't delete that . 18400_18970
let's can you copy it . 19420_20820
and like . 20990_21240
can you copy or . 22430_22940
just delete it and keep save it in a different version . 23080_24540
yeah . 24670_24900
can you save this as it's something else . 24960_26420
well it's in the one that's on . 27220_28710
ids . 29180_29250
yeah . 29400_29630
oh you're right . 29680_30030
you're right . 30160_30340
you're right . 30360_30580
this is just for tomorrow . 32150_33100
are &-um are we gonna keep that . 34540_36980
same background was saying it was pal . 38420_41450
I like it though . 41950_42480
okay . 44060_44300
unless you wanna make it look blue or something like this . 46410_49220
anymore . 58680_58870
do these even apply anymore . 68030_69180
&-uh . 70530_70540
&-um yes I think so . 71200_71980
because . 72650_73090
future for the future of_course like we know . 72810_75180
it's funny . 75300_75690
well . 76520_76700
no . 77240_77330
I mean just want to keep it's . 77550_79220
dude . 79740_79980
just because we've hit like one audience . 80030_82690
Cfa majors . 83010_83500
I still don't think find this all that funny . 83590_85140
why . 86580_86750
they're not at a cluster eight hours a day . 87950_89870
they're in studio . 90700_91220
they they get a bigger kick out_of like . 91470_93460
most of my Css friends are finding it . 94060_95740
funny . 95950_96090
Css people find it funny . 96300_97300
C I t finds it funny . 97800_98650
just when it gets to like C F A gets to be I've never programmed a
why would I even show us some other majors . 105500_107100
like . 107890_107990
I mean they feel the pain . 109600_110510
they know their friends who are like stuck there . 110530_112750
that's not . 122620_122810
I think another risk we have is lack of users . 123350_124850
'cause our thing that our site is so like user driven like so many
and just basically matching everyone that's entered their
but that's also publicity . 137640_138610
it's . 138940_139180
not necessarily users . 139230_140010
it's that the users do stuff . 140180_141740
mhm . 142200_142370
the users actually interact with the system . 142610_144540
more than just like sit there and like absorb what we have
lack of user contribution . 151010_152430
we could talk about the gooey elements during the walkthrough as
yeah . 157140_157230
so we can get what it's . 157340_157990
the slides . 158310_158670
what_if you go up like slide six maybe . 158840_162150
