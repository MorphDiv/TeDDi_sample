okay, um, alright, so animal rights .
alright .
uh, I just had a page open about it .
I closed it when I was trying to find the recorder controls .
oh, here it is .
okay .
so, this is basically a radical vegetarian organization that
and that they should be placed in homes to live out their natural
I think it's hard to say, though, that it's doing more harm than
well, I guess from a purely net gain standpoint, more people profit
well I don't know if that true is true actually .
don't you think, uh, humans eat more animals than humans enjoy
than humans enjoy eating ?
well, I mean, we need to eat .
if you, if you put it that way it's really all or nothing, we're
well you don't have to eat meat to survive .
no, but, if you're going to say that we do eat meat, given that we
not necessarily, why do we have to keep eating it ?
if we're saying that for the purpose of animals as food, they're
yeah I know but, if we're taking the stance that they're +...
well I dunno, but let's for, say for the sake of argument that they
or maybe +...
it's not +...
well +...
I think it's just really hard to say that um we should be like
well, what do you mean ?
done to them ?
what's done to humans ?
aside from whether or not it's right, putting that aside for one
so you d- well, the animals can do work, they can be work animals,
so you're fine with like, animal testing and stuff .
yeah .
you have no objection to that .
well, it depends what you're testing, I guess, but yeah,
what about lab rats that are specifically bred to have a higher
well if it's going to help solve cancer in humans, then from a
well it's not like, it's not like what they did during the
have you ever read about those surgeons who were basically like
yeah that's really pretty horrible but +/.
it's not like we're doing that .
well there are some places where we might be doing that to animals,
but cause they I mean they are animals rights groups that actually
well I'm not saying at all that we need to take a step back and say
I think where we have now maybe a little bit more regulation on
well let's I mean the question is, are animals in fact in you know
are they similar, like mammals, are mammals similar to humans
well true so +...
you can't test, like, you can't run a medical test on a bacteria,
so let's +...
well, I mean, uh, no, you actually can run a medical test on a
you're testing whether an antibiotic works, but you can't test
okay, yeah, but what about this then .
would it be justifiable, okay, so, we're going to say that we have
is that what we're saying ?
I guess .
or do we just not care about the animal harm to begin with ?
well we don't want animals to be harmed if it's avoidable, we
well actually, you probably would kill animals in the streets, just
&=laughs okay, but so obviously you don't want to just kill animals
within reason .
well, okay, within reason, sure, but .
if, obviously .
it's a slippery slope .
obviously this would never actually be useful, but if electrocuting
you think that's in the wrong .
yeah cause even though +...
but +...
it's really like a cost-benefit type thing, with the cost being the
well I'm definitely partial to the cost-benefit model for anything,
that depends, I think that really depends on, in the first place,
um .
do we know that ?
uh, yeah they are .
they are suffering and so are these other fourteen .
yeah .
okay, well that's obviously a point for that it's advisable to
no, they're it's uh, unwilling for some large percentage of them .
it's five people .
what's a large percent of five people ?
uh .
I'm gonna say either three or four .
four .
so, four of them do not want to die even though they're going to
yeah, or yeah well, it might not be a fatal disease it it can kill
but the other fourteen are definitely going to die .
yes, because their disease has pr- advanced to the final stage that
well, I think this is a bit of an odd example, (be)cause there are
(be)cause there are two stages to the disease and only we need to
so .
or fatal .
so, these fourteen people are definitely going to die and those
right, but we're going to guarantee their deaths to guarantee the
but you guarantee the lives of the fourteen ?
well we don't guarantee the lives .
how do you guarantee that this cure is going to be successful ?
we don't guarantee it .
it's a ninety eight percent that it will be successful .
but these five will certainly die .
yes .
but those five also could've died .
they might die .
and based on the data they die about half the time .
so two and a half of them are going to die .
in theory, yeah, so is, does that mean the solution is to kill half
there are five people .
so kill two of them and then chop off one of the guys' limbs .
in a lot of instances sometimes that's just fitting anyway .
laughs .
but I think in this instance you kind of need to jut let those five
okay, so let's do the whole situation with animals, except you
let's just assume that there are no humans and you have no way of
I don't think so .
I don't think with the majority of animals you can even say there
so you don't think animals have desires ?
I think they have desires in the form of base instinct .
okay .
I don't think they have enough comprehension to say, well, to even
well but wouldn't you agree that to a certain extent humanity is
I mean don't people do things a lot because of their instincts even
but how can do you seriously think a lab rat has a grasp of a
uh, no, but just because you don't have a conception o something
so we're dealing with a creature that does not understand what it
well I would argue two things to counteract that, what you said .
um, first of all, that it's not that it doesn't understand what it
I mean do we really understand what it is to die ?
well, that's fair .
that's fair .
plus, um, the thing that it really does understand, which is the
that even if it doesn't understand death it certainly understands
and wouldn't, we're assuming that +...
does it hurt though ?
it hurts, yeah .
we don't know that it hurts +...
no, it does .
we know that it hurts ?
it involves removing organs while the creatures alive and +...
well, why can't you sedate it ?
so we'll give it anesthetic, right ?
but, if we're giving it an anesthetic, then aren't we already kind
I mean, if we're giving the animal an anesthetic, then how can we
don't you only give anesthetics to things that you want to morally
that's true .
I mean, that's a valid point, but again, this really depends on
this goes a lot deeper .
do you believe in the death penalty ?
do you think that the death penalty is considered cruel and unusual
personally I think it is but +...
well I would agree with you on that, but I would also argue that
okay, but if you would permit me to take a stance that I don't
economic, right ?
what ?
economic ?
economic, no .
oh okay, go on .
um, the death penalty is not in fact cruel or unusual punishment .
(be)cause it's painless ?
but torture would be, so therefore we have to state that there's a
s .
law, between death, and um +...
and pain ?
homicide, essentially and torture .
we have to say that death for the purposes of U .
s .
law specifically is not painful and not torturous .
well I don't know if it matters so much the law as what the U .
s .
does, and they do torture you know .
well that's a different matter .
but when the I mean +...
whether or not they do torture they're not actually allowed to .
yeah I know but they're not allowed to because its politically
okayay, um .
and that by the same token +...
what you said before there is an economic side a lot of people are
I believe that an average human in general calculations is
yeah okay economically speaking the death penalty is expedient but
I'm not talking about the death penalty; I'm talking about like
um, cost-benefit again .
would you save these people ?
is it economically sound ?
uh, well we'll say it is .
there, maybe it wasn't seven million; maybe it was like seventeen
okay .
but when calculating whether or not you should intervene to save
okay, but umm, the argument against the death penalty and against
so in other words, what, you know, what's the morality that we're
you know, like there may be an economic reason, we both know that
but the reason why I would be opposed to the death penalty is
that's true .
personally, I just think that regardless of the cost, I think that
I just think that this is a violation of everything that the
well I agree, but then I guess I am, there is sort of an impasse
the same human rights, yeah .
and, there're definitely dumb people who are less intelligent than
uh, well, yeah .
I mean they do exist they might not be very common, but there
a lot of those people are, it's a little hard to find people like
well, okay, fine .
well even then, some of those are killed .
yeah, true, well, that's another one I guess .
I mean the whole vegetative state thing .
well I don't know what I would decide in a situation like that .
oh, well, I mean, I certainly wouldn't tell anyone to pull my
oh, yeah, but what if, well, do you support, do you think people
yeah, definitely .
so you don't think there's even if someone's not necessarily in
uh, if a psychiatrist says they're not in their right mind then no .
but how do you, so what do you, go to your local, um, district
uh yeah that's one way to think about it .
and then you have to like make your case, this is my psychiatrist,
well first of all, I think most people could probably manage to
so I think that they'd probably be okay with it .
the main +...
but I'm saying +...
in the case, in the case that you described +...
this would never happen in practice .
well It would happen .
I'm saying in your idea, if you're saying that suicide should be
yeah well I'm talking about in the case of someone +...
but how would you legalize suicide ?
in the case of someone being hospitalized or imprisoned that wanted
like in the case where you're under the protective care of the
well then that becomes assisted suicide .
it's not assisted you just need permission to kill yourself .
but for someone to pull your plug, that's assisted suicide .
yeah that is, and in that case you need the forms .
but I would argue the same thing applies for a suicide where you're
like if you're in a psychiatric hospital or if you're in a prison .
if you just want to commit suicide cause you're unhappy, then that
so you think prisoners should be able to apply for the death
yeah, and think a lot of them would take it .
but then where do you see the line that they're not in their right
uh, the not in the right mind, well a prisoner is different,
but I would argue that offering death is sort of a necessary humane
I think suffering is worse than death .
in a lot of cases, it's hard to judge suffering, and no one knows
right, which is why I would rather have a mystery over a guaranteed
well sometimes the evil you know is better than the evil you don't
that is a saying, but I am not necessarily sure that I agree with
you don't think that's ever the case ?
well it could be the case, but the evil you don't know assumes that
something after death could be good .
or if there is an after death; it's probably nothing, in my
I'm just saying, uh, it's not the evil you don't know it's the, you
but it could be evil .
but also could be good .
but just as easily evil, that's why it's the evil you don't know .
but it's not the evil you don't know, because that assumes that it
no, that's just the expression .
well I only buy the expression that applies in the case that you
but the whole point of the expression is that you don't know what
yes which it could be and it's a good word of advice to make sure
yeah .
but if that's bad you might really want to just go .
it depends you know +...
but if it's so what if it's so easily worse, that's what the saying
but what are really the chances that death could be worse than
I think that kind of depends on whether or not you see the torture
if someone has a life sentence and if they consider their life
exactly .
maybe they're better off dead .
that would be the case I refer to .
if they've got parole in twenty years, then I think they're making
well I think it's okay if people make rash decisions, that's fine .
people make rash decisions to do lots of stupid things all the time
well to kill yourself, that's a little final .
yeah I know, but eventually it'll weed itself out of the gene pool .
then you're getting into something completely different .
yeah I know, uh, well, let's go back to animals though .
I think our gene pool sucks enough already, like just walk down the
wait, say that again .
I think the human gene pool is pretty bad already .
oh, yeah .
if you could just walk down the street and tell me how many people
good point .
<it's not> it doesn't lookay good .
yeah good point .
um, but let's go back to the animals though .
okay, okay, yeah we've gotten a little off topic .
<so do you> I'm pretty sure that there are there're, uh, some
because they're deemed humanoid in one way or another .
yeah, but isn't it a spectrum ?
I mean, aren't all mammals kind of like humans, like, I mean, we
I don't think we're in the best place to decide where, but there is
then, why not any other protist, then why not any other bacteria,
okay, but why are we drawing the line and what's the rationale for
the line right now is the line at which we think, maybe the lines a
uh, well I guess the question is, is sentience relative ?
I mean can you be, is there, just you're sentient or not, or can it
well, yeah, I think that any human, well, not any human if we're
okay I agree but so then .
hello ?
hello ?
uh, I'm trying to phrase this .
couldn't you then say, I mean, so we're drawing the sentience line
we're trying it relative to ourselves .
we see our own sentience as our ability to think abstractly, to uh
