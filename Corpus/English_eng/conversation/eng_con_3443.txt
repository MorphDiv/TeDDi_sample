in the first picture &-um a little boy and his dog found a frog .
and he kept it in his jar .
while they were sleeping <the dog> <the> the frog <got>
and the next day when they woke up <they> they saw the jar was
and they started looking for him when the dog looked in the jar .
and he got his head stuck .
and <they> <when they went out to look the window> when
and the boy picked him up .
and he started licking him right there .
the boy doesn't look very happy .
and so they went outside .
and they looked or him .
they saw +...
they went out +...
they went +...
and the dog looked at the bee house .
&-um and he looked in the beaver's or whatever that guy is .
and the beaver came out and started yapping at <him> the boy .
the dog knocked over the bee hive while the boy was looking in the
and the bees started flying past .
he fell off .
and the owl came out and chased him on <the> the rock .
<the> a deer was hiding behind <a> a rock .
and he leaned over and held on to the deer's horn .
<he fell over> the deer ran over to a cliff .
dropped the boy .
the dog and the boy fell down .
<and they found> and they found a log .
and then they looked behind the log .
and in that page he's telling the dog to be quiet .
and there they are .
there's the frog .
and there's I guess the mother and the little babies .
and they the mother let them take them a little baby home .
and that's the end of the story .
well <the> the boy and the dog look like they are not saying
they're just like like very happy that they caught the frog .
and they're happy because they caught the frog .
and then in this picture no one is talking .
the frog's happy because he's gonna get out_of the jar .
and the boy and the dog are <probably> probably happy because
and they're asleep .
the next morning the boy is saying like uhoh where's where did
and he probably sees the window was open .
and he knows the frog <jumped> probably got out_of the jar and
they look sad because they lost the frog .
and now they're sad .
<he's> <he's saying oh> he's probably saying oh I can't
where would he be ?
the dog's under there .
looks like he's smiling maybe .
and &-um he got stuck in the jar .
and <they're probably> he's probably saying like uhoh because
and there they are looking out the window .
he's calling for the frog to come back .
he's looking I don't know that you would say sad ashamed .
he fell .
the boy is like there did the doggy go ?
and the dog's like frightened cause he's falling off the window .
and now he's mad because he broke one of the frog's jars .
the dog is happy for some reason .
so he's mad and he's happy for some reason .
and how did that happen Brian ?
because &-um <he fell> he got his head stuck in the jar .
and they were looking out the window .
and he fell out .
he's still calling for the frog to come back .
and <he's like a> he is looking like a hunting dog .
and &-um I don't know .
looks in_between happy and sad .
and he's probably happy or sad because he lost the frog .
there they are again <looking> looking around for the frog .
<he> <he's look> the boy's looking or calling for the
and he's barking at the bee hive .
he's still barking at the bee hive .
he's holding his nose because it probably smells .
theres the dog's like scared or frightened
xxx .
when the bee hive got knocked down he got like chased by the bees
he's whispering probably into the owl's home .
and what is he whispering ?
I don't know .
he's probably calling the frog .
but I don't know why a kid would think the frog is there .
&-um the owl got mad .
and the boy fell off the tree .
and there's the dog frightened .
and the bees are chasing him .
and the owl finally like gave up gave up and flew away probably .
he climbs a rock to look .
and he's holding on to a stick which really was the horns of a deer
and the dog's over there weeping because he probably got stung or
and is he saying something again ?
oh yeah he's calling for the frog .
he fell <off> off .
and now he looks like worried because he fell off of here .
and <the he was> the dog's barking at the deer to drop the boy
and <the boy> the boy looks mad .
and finally <they dropped> he dropped him off the cliff .
and the boy is screaming like ah: !
and the dog looks frightened like really bad .
and there are not saying anything just under water .
and now <they are like> he's smiling or something like that .
and I wonder why he's holding his hand up to his ear .
oh because he probably heard the frogs .
there he is telling the dog to be quiet .
and the dog's sitting there .
there they're looking over the <frog> the log .
and <they> they found them .
they are not talking at all .
there are the frogs .
that's the babies .
and he's saying like wow .
and how does he feel there ?
happy cause he found the frogs .
and <they> he's thanking the frog that he found for like
and he's barking .
and that's it
