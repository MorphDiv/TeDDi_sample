duh well I ain't so sure what we're gonna do today to straighten up .
my horror of_course is the idea that I talk like other professors .
surely that's not the case .
tell me that's not the case .
&-um we have a little housekeeping business to attend to today .
&-uh I have the first &-uh set of papers to give back to a handful of you who &-uh wrote on &-uh this topic .
I'll do that in just a second .
&-uh but let me make a_couple_of points to you &-uh about these writing assignments .
first &-um I don't want you to rely on me to give you the assignment if you're absent from class .
&-uh partly that's simply a practical matter and that is I only check my email about every third day because I forget I have it so &-uh &-uh &~y &-uh you're much more than likely to &-uh get no answer from me out_of sheer inadvertence .
but also I don't wanna do that &-uh &~e &~b even by choice .
so what I suggest is that you think summer camp did you all go to summer camp ?
you get a buddy &-uh you_know you look out for each_other so that if you're drowning you have a buddy that'll say hey he's drowning &-um so if you miss class and want to find out if there was a writing assignment then I suggest you not email me much less call me but email your buddy .
maybe that &-uh Nick where did Nick go ?
Nick ?
he may &-uh &-uh be softhearted and answer for you but I'm not going to .
so that's my suggestion to you find somebody in the class who'll who'll &-uh do that for you .
now secondly I'm about to take up the writing assignments that you did last time .
but let me remind you if you have &-uh elevated this writing assignment to be one of your formal ones that you want it graded again designate that with a big &-uh &-uh W at the top which stands for writing or woe is me or will this never end or whatever .
some W though so that Nick will know that's &-uh your paper .
&-um let me then hand back these this first set Nick did you wanna say anything about these &-uh ?
no <they were> they were look good so far .
&-um don't be afraid to use the I &-um and .
&~ha students are though aren't they ?
yeah I don't know I &~sh &~i I remember being taught that ⌈ somewhere along the line so ⌉ .
⌊ I was too and ⌋ I think it's the dumbest thing I ever heard about .
yeah go ahead and use the first person .
and you can assume that your reader has &-um is familiar with the text .
I mean again <with a> with a thirty page response there's no real need <to get> to get too &-um ah expositional with &-uh your explanations about plot or or you know sort_of the action the narrative action of the story so you can just assume straight off the bat that &-um your reader has read the text and yeah it's &-uh .
knows who the characters are +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ &-uh just just assume you have a &=laughs:S2 knowledgeable reader so that you don't hafta tell the story we don't want plot summary or &-uh thumbnail descriptions of who the characters are assume that's all known and get on to the problem .
+, yeah +/.
+, okay ?
&-uh Pun Din Fan ?
right .
&-uh Gail Chadwick ?
here .
Mary Jaralin ?
&-uh Lillian Heffner ?
and Shelly Zimford .
do yall remember that that +//?
did you see the story on the news ?
there was some professor I think over at &-uh Macomb Community College &-uh and he was getting in all sorts of trouble for using such profane language , an English professor of_course using such profane language .
so I'm tempted to do that today , just riddle my speech with you_know all of this profanity and see if they would give us an X rating .
&-uh okay &-uh I had asked you to &-uh give me your opinion today on a particular topic &-um having to do with Christopher Newman's disposition of the letter that &-uh comes into his possession from the the old Marquis +...
and I wanna take those up now &-uh but I also wanted to &-uh pose one fact question for you to answer my daily factoid on the same sheet it's this .
&-uh when Christopher Newman &-uh last sees Noemie Nioche in London &-uh with whom is she walking ?
huh +/.
+, when Christopher Newman last sees Noemie Nioche in London &-uh with whom is she walking ?
(0.8) okay so pass those up .
(0.23) oh I should say +//.
I think I've said this before .
but let me say again &-um if you're here and hadn't done the writing assignment but just want to get credit simply for attending , &~a and you should get some , &-uh just give me a piece of paper with your name on it .
if nothing else that will say you're here you may not have done the work in advance but you're here .
okay do I have some ?
(0.10) this it ?
(0.14) why don't you sort those and take what's yours .
(0.13) last time I tried to suggest to you <the agenda that> &-uh the conscious agenda that Henry James had in writing The American .
&-uh that in the preface that he wrote about almost thirty five years later &-uh &~i and he's remembering the origins of this novel how the idea came to him what he wanted to do in it .
&-uh and if you recall that he said that he wanted to create a situation in which an American , in some ways a a typical American &-um going to Europe &-uh &~i is dealt some grievous injustice by a society that thinks itself &-uh superior to him in every way .
&-uh and that the occasion would arise for him to be able to exact some kind of &-uh retribution or revenge for that injustice .
&-uh and the question that fascinated James was what would he do &-uh in that case ?
&-uh and &-um so we get to that situation today when we &~co we'll come in a bit to talk about &-uh the letter that he has that would inflict some significant damage presumably &-uh on the Bellegardes and his decision not to do it not to use it &-uh in that way .
but with that in mind , the part of the novel that I had you read for the first day , and that's a_lot , over three hundred pages , in some ways really doesn't develop that particular &-uh complexity very much .
&-uh the wrong that is done to Christopher Newman that comes only in chapter eighteen .
&-uh and even then &-um &~i &~i in one sense we wonder is this &-uh a grievous wrong ?
I_mean &~i &~i &-uh I guess in one way it is when her family forces Claire to break off her engagement to him .
&-um but in that &-uh chapter when &-uh &-uh Newman goes to the Bellegarde's home +//.
&-uh that's after the night at the opera &-uh where &-uh Valentin &-uh becomes embroiled in this situation that will lead to the duel and his death .
&-um when when &-uh Newman enters the house , their house , the next time it says on page thirty twelve +"/.
+" &-um &{l=READING he felt as_soon_as he entered the room that he was in the presence of something evil .
&}l=READING now there were a_lot_of reasons not to like the Bellegardes .
&-uh you_know they're snobbish , they're hidebound , they're on a high horse and all this sort_of +...
&-uh but just <the night> a few nights before &-uh Newman was &-uh well sort_of teasing the old Marquis at the ball .
&-uh he was in such a good mood and he was sort_of &-uh joshing with her and joking with her and all this sort_of thing , &-um &~i &~i you_know needling her .
&~ag &-uh &-uh and she obviously didn't like this .
but the the relationship between them is not one where he felt that there was something evil .
what what accounts in effect for the shift from a comedy of manners ?
what I suggested to you last time is that the first part of The American is really a comedy of manners where you just have two cultures clashing .
&-uh the brash frank spontaneous openhearted good+natured rather ignorant American , Christopher Newman .
I_mean even that name is so symbolic isn't it ?
new man .
Christopher , the <founder of> &~the &-uh discoverer of the new world at least in the old history .
&-um so you have this &-uh this figure on the one hand and then you have the Bellegardes on the other , the upholders of &-uh tradition and form and protocol and all the sort_of the aristocratic prerogatives .
and the clash between these two is not really a moral one .
there's no right or wrong here so much as there is simply the ways that two different cultures behave and the clash that occurs when one a figure from one of these cultures tries to insinuate himself into the milieu of of one of the others .
and so there's a certain degree of of sort_of comic misadventure going on here &-uh that in its own way is is &-uh more amusing than anything else .
&-um &{l=READING suddenly then &}l=READING in this next chapter &{l=READING Newman felt he was in the presence of something evil .
&}l=READING so that at this point the novel turns from being &-uh novelistic &-uh to being what James himself later identifies as +//.
&-uh we're &~tur talking genre now .
a romance .
&-um I said some of this to you last time but let me repeat it very briefly .
the novel &-uh deals with the true to life , the ordinary , the everyday .
&-uh and a great degree the criterion for judging a novel is verisimilitude trueness to life .
&-uh does that represent life as we live it , as we experience ?
does it seem to us then true ?
this is not the criterion of &-uh of the romance .
the romance &-uh by its very nature deals with the extraordinary , &-uh often with the supernatural , if not that maybe with the preternatural , &-uh so_that you get extreme situations &-uh and things happen in romances that &-uh don't happen in everyday life .
I remember when certain critics were objecting about that movie Pocahontas .
did you see that ?
that it wasn't historically accurate .
and Mel Gibson said +"/.
+" for God's sake there's a raccoon in it that talks .
+" &=laughs of_course it's not historically accurate .
so &~i you_know in other words you don't expect historical accuracy of a work that never claims to be a work of history .
&-uh but it is instead a kind of fantasy so_that romance &-uh certainly shades into fantasy or to the extraordinary the extreme the preternatural something like that .
&-uh and so we we suddenly move from being in the world of the novel where we have this comic clash of manners to &-uh to a world of romance in the literary sense .
this has nothing to do with kissiekissie@n &-um but &-uh to the strange , the ominous , oh inexplicable .
so so &-uh how is James going to make the Bellegardes seem not just stuffy not just arrogant but evil ?
and in what way then does that impact &-uh on on Christopher Newman ?
&-uh after all &~i &~i I think James later in his career would have been perfectly able and willing to have made a novel out_of nothing more than their forcing Claire to break off the engagement .
see ‡ &-uh you can get great literature out_of families getting in the way of love , you_know Romeo and Juliet , all that sort of thing .
&-uh and I think James would have done that .
here however he complicates it by wanting to make this in a sense really a kind of melodrama of good and evil .
&-uh and the Bellegardes then in some way hafta be &-uh &~b &~i or transmogrified +//?
okay .
that's a big word for our recording today .
&=laughs:multiple &-uh hafta be &-uh transmogrified into something far more sinister than simply &-um arrogant aristocrats who say to Newman +"/.
+" &{l=READING we made her break it off .
says the Marquis +".
+" I could not in the last analysis reconcile myself to a commercial person .
&}l=READING now you_know okay that might be , how would you say &-uh , unfair .
<it might be bad> it might even be in bad faith .
they &~ha &~a they had after all made a bargain &-uh of sorts with Newman and then they're now acting in bad faith .
all that may be true but it's a long way from that to saying +"/.
+" I felt I was in the presence of something evil .
and that the reader is supposed to share I think that feeling that there's something very dark and sinister going on in the house of Bellegarde .
and indeed on his dying bed Valentin divulges that there's some great dark family secret and that there's a letter that contains all this and if Newman could only come into the possession of that letter +...
well okay if Newman could come into the possession of that letter what +..?
you see &-uh early on after they force Claire to break off the engagement <as she> which she does she enters a convent .
that's almost right out_of romance <or Agatha Christie> .
you have a unhappy love affair , you go to a convent .
it happens all the time in medieval romance .
&-um so what use will this letter be to Christopher &-uh even if he has it ?
it won't get Claire back for him because she's now for a very different reason unreachable .
will it give him simply the satisfaction of revenge ?
he says to Mrs Bread &-um on page thirty seventy five +"/.
+" &{l=READING I want to bring them down , down , down .
+" I want to turn the tables upon them .
+" I want to mortify them as they mortified me .
&}l=READING notice Claire's out_of the picture now .
this is not gonna get Claire back .
+" &-um &{l=READING they took me up into a high place and they made me stand there for all the world to see me .
+" and then they stole behind me and pushed me into this bottomless pit where I lie howling and gnashing my teeth .
+" I made a fool of myself before their friends but I shall make something worse of them .
&}l=READING or he says to &-uh the Marquise herself &-uh on page &-uh four fourteen when he's presenting them with the evidence that he has of the murder &-uh and that he will be able to use it against them .
but again it's not clear to what end .
there's nothing practical or instrumental that he can achieve by this .
as I say , it won't get Claire back .
&-um about halfway down the page &-uh +"/.
+" &{l=READING no .
he says +".
+" I want to say a few words more .
+" I want to say that I hope you quite understand what I am about .
+" this is my revenge „ you_know .
+" you have treated me before the world convened for the express purpose as if I were not good enough for you .
+" I mean to show the world that however bad I may be you are not quite the people to say it .
&}l=READING so is this then in some ways a kind of status battle ?
hm ?
&-uh they acted so high and mighty .
they mortified me in front of all the world , made a fool of me .
well ‡ two can play at that game .
and I think I have a trump for their ace that I am planning to play to show the world what they're like .
so that's the the initial motive for his &-uh wanting to find this letter and &-um his stratagem for &-um for planning to use it .
and we'll come <in to a minute> to the question in a minute of why doesn't he .
&-uh but let me take up one other matter for just a moment .
&-um one of the difficulties of this novel from almost every critic &-uh that I've presumed for a_lot_of you ordinary readers , what Virginia Woolf calls the common reader +//.
she means well by that .
she she admires the common reader .
+, &-uh is that &-uh the figure of Claire is very nebulous , very indistinct &-uh in this novel .
she doesn't emerge very vividly in her own right .
&-uh and all sorts of questions arise about Claire's motivation .
is she really in love with Newman ?
does she have none of her family's aristocratic distaste for his commercial background and origins ?
if they're so appalled by this , that he once made washtubs , why not Claire ?
&-uh why is she so willing to accept him when everyone else finds him +//?
even Valentin .
remember when &-uh just for first &-uh broaches the subject of the +//.
even Valentin his his friend is shocked by the idea .
you can't marry my sister &=laughs it would be unheard of .
so why is Claire so &-uh pliable in this ?
why is she so accepting ?
&-um is it some enormous charm that he has &=laughs or real love ?
okay is she simply wanting to get away from that wretched mother ?
you can certainly understand that .
&-uh <is there> <is there> &~i does there seem to be any real spark between them or chemistry between them ?
&-uh if we were reviewing this as a movie you_know &-um what would Roger say ?
+" there's no real chemistry between these two characters .
&~a &~a and there may not be .
and then if so , if there really is some &-uh deep affection , why does Claire so easily break off the engagement ?
her mother says +"/.
+" I demanded that she do so and she obeyed .
not much of an explanation .
<do you think> ?
so_that the whole figure of Claire in some way remains &-um sort_of vague and &-uh nebulous .
and again many years later when James is writing his preface for the New York edition of of The American &-um he perceives that weakness .
but he tries in a certain way to make it into a virtue &-uh when he tells us what he was trying to do .
reading the prose of James at that later period is always a challenge .
it's extremely difficult .
&-uh but let me try a &~f a couple sentences on you of what he was saying about &-uh &-uh Claire and indeed all of the other characters in the novel except Newman .
&-um &{l=READING he was the lighted figure &}l=READING that is Newman .
&-uh &{l=READING the others even doubtless to an excessive degree the woman who is made the agent of his discomfort &}l=READING that is Claire &-uh &{l=READING were to be obscured .
&}l=READING again Newman is the lighted figure if you think of this as a play .
the spotlight's on Newman .
&{l=READING the others including Claire &}l=READING he says &{l=READING were to be obscured .
by which I should largely get the very effect most to be invoked that of a generous nature engaged with forces with difficulties and with dangers that it but half understands .
&}l=READING the other characters hafta be mysterious obscure their motives not apparent because the perception of them that &~i we have is only Newman's .
he doesn't understand them .
he doesn't know what they're up to .
he doesn't &-uh gauge the complexity of their motives and so forth .
so James said I hadta leave those characters obscure to the reader because they were obscure to him , you see .
&-um &{l=READING he &}l=READING that is Newman again &{l=READING he therefore supremely matters the rest matters only as he feels it treats it meets it .
&}l=READING so &-uh to go into the background of that statement would take us too far afield but what's happened by the time James comes to write the preface here is that literary modernism has begun to emerge .
&-uh and &-um often in that literary mode &-um the concentration is entirely on the single &~s figure as it experiences the world .
and therefore it becomes an exercise in subjectivity rather than writing the kind of &-uh sociological novel where you have a vast cast of characters and we can enter in the mind of any one of these characters at any time because we have an omniscient author .
&-uh and therefore you can see this is what this guy's thinking , that's what this girl's thinking , this is what this man's thinking , this is what his mother's thinking .
&-uh &-uh the the &~om the omniscient author allows us to enter into the mind of any character at any time and so we &~the they're in some ways all equally imagined .
if you think of a great novel like say Middlemarch , I think Eliot must have there thirty or so major characters and at any moment <she can> she can tell us what this character's thinking , what his motives are , why he's doing what he's doing .
but with modernism &-uh and the increase in subjectivity &-uh we begin to get the world as experienced only through one sensibility .
&-uh I suppose the most &-uh famous example of this is James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man where Steven Daedelus is the only &-uh reality of the novel .
everybody else exists only as Steven perceives them .
&-uh and when he quits thinking about (th)em , for all practical purposes they cease to exist .
it's a very sort_of solipsistic novel .
&-uh &~th that is , the the only reality that things have are are in the mind of the perceiver .
&-uh and &-uh in that novel his even his very obscure love , the woman Amarata , &-uh we don't even know her name .
we know he has a girlfriend .
<we know her name is EC> her we know her initials are EC .
but we don't even know what her name is &-um &~i so_that she remains simply a floating fleeting figment of &-uh of Steven's perception .
&-uh so_that modernism will come to &-uh elevate that mode <to a a> &-uh to a particular &-uh: sort_of aesthetic modus_operandi &-uh that the only character that you really hafta give great reality in life to is the central consciousness , the figure who possesses that central consciousness .
now as I say James writes the preface thirty five years after he writes the novel and he wrote a novel in which you have a_lot_of <not very well or> not very believable characters .
&-um certainly they don't have the the richness and depth that we would expect from James's later characters .
and so he's in some way trying to make a virtue out_of that by saying +"/.
well ‡ you hafta understand the only character who really matters in this novel is Christopher Newman .
&-uh what we wanna see is a novel from his point of view , from his perspective .
and he didn't understand these people .
he didn't know what the depth and complexity of Claire's motives and personality were .
&-um and &-uh &-uh therefore she remains to some degree an enigma &-uh in the novel because she was an enigma to Christopher .
and I suppose that &~the there's some degree of &-uh legitimacy &-uh in that claim .
I think am I right about this ?
I don't think there's any scene in the novel that he's not in .
we never have some scene where Claire is confiding in someone why she's engaged to &~h +//.
of_course I_mean who would you confide to in that house ?
but but you see the the &-uh the problem that that if Newman is in every scene then there is never any sense of what's going on behind what he sees what the intricacies are and so forth unless some other character tells him .
but then you hafta wonder what their motives are .
they are they always telling the truth and so forth ?
so <when you> when you limit the novel as James does here to the experience and perceptions of a single character then it means that the &~m motives and and inner lives of the other characters remain this to a great degree a kind_of closed book .
does that make sense to you ?
+, mhm +/.
+, so &-uh there is a_lot_of reader dissatisfaction I think with how obscure and in some way unreal then the character of of Claire is .
because for example Valentin is a much better developed character .
&-uh James doesn't hafta sacrifice &-uh the depth of character development &-uh as you can see with with that character who's who comes much more to life , has much more reality to him , than than his sister does .
but in a way &-uh James is committed to keeping Claire as this kind_of ideal &-uh this treasure this &-uh &-uh sort_of almost unattainable item , the best item in the market you_see which Newman is wanting to buy .
to some degree that may depend upon &-um the distance from it .
you_see if you get up close then you begin to see you_know maybe she has bad breath &-uh or &-uh you_know there may be a a wart on her her nose that he hadn't seen before .
in other words the the the the this idealization of Claire may to some degree depend upon &-uh her always remaining sort_of this distant &-uh idealized figure .
&-uh &~w but then we come to &-uh &-uh I think the even more difficult figure of the the Marquis her mother .
&-uh there's a kind_of comic figure early on in the novel .
&-um you_know appalled that her daughter might marry this &~a not only this American but this American businessman , this this savage , this boor .
&-um and certainly &-uh that scene where they're giving the great ball and &-uh Newman is pushing it for all it's worth , you_know &-um making her walk around , meeting all her friends , and you_know she's chagrined by the whole thing .
&-uh &~b but all of that has its its its sort_of comic side .
and then suddenly we're told in this chapter &-uh there's something evil in this house something sinister and indeed there is because it turns out the Marquis in addition to being a stuffed shirt is a murderess .
now where did that come from ?
see straight out_of romance you think they the family's keeping this great dark secret that &-uh the Marquis had murdered her husband .
but then again if you start looking at it in detail that doesn't make a_lot_of sense either .
&-uh what has she murdered him &~f why did she murder him +..?
(be)cause he opposes the marriage of their daughter to Count_De_Cintre who the hell is the Count_De_Cintre ?
turns out he's a fraud .
there's no money &-uh treats Claire badly .
besides this family prides itself on being one of the most important distinguished old families in France there's no great gain that I can see by marrying Claire off to this guy even if he were who they thought he was which he isn't .
so if anything the Marquis comes off not only as a murderess but kind_of a dimwit .
the &~th &-uh this is the best way you can arrange a marriage for your daughter by killing your husband ?
and it really doesn't make a_lot_of sense the the whole thing is contrived and creaky .
but what James is wanting to do here is find some great terrible crime that the Bellegardes have been hiding all these years .
mhm ?
I thought the passage where &-um Mrs Bread is talking about the ribbon that she kept like all her life I mean I thought there must be something going on there .
between the two of them .
between the two of (th)em I mean even if it wasn't official ⌈ officially consummated ⌉ .
⌊ yeah .
but &-uh but ⌋ &-uh &-uh would that be a motive for murder ?
in France particularly .
&=laughs:multiple &~i when President Mitterand died at his by the his graveside were his wife and mistress both standing there holding hands you know &=laughs I mean they do these things differently in France .
but I don't know &-uh &~b &-uh &~b &~b there may &~i she says Mrs Bread says that the Marquis accused her of that accused them of having something going on but I'm British she says .
&=laughs we don't do that sort of thing .
&-um so I don't know &~i &-uh &-uh &~i again I would think the later James would probably have taken up that sort of possibility making this far more but I think this is just sheer melodrama that he's &~concoct that James is concocting here .
I mean writing this letter on your deathbed I've been poisoned you know my wife is killing me and writing this letter and &~s secreting it to the servant I mean you know the whole thing is out_of bad opera isn't it ?
&-uh &-uh &~a and and you know as I say James himself later came to feel this when he +//.
you you can tell he's kind_of embarrassed &-uh when he writes this introduction all those years later at &-uh the the sort_of &-uh clumsy creakiness of his plot in this part +//.
it is George Sand &~i &~i it's straight George Sand .
as I told you she used to write this kind of novel .
they were immensely popular .
they're sort_of &-uh you_know the harlequin romances of their day .
&-uh and and so in in in some sense you_know the gloomy castle and the family with the hidden secrets and murder being committed there and &-uh all you_know everybody knowing it but nobody mentioning it to the other .
they carry around this great guilty secret all these years that now falls into &-uh to Newman's hands .
so I I I think it in other words in_order_to get &~thi to get this transition from the comedy of manners to this melodrama which is really about questions of crime great moral questions &-um &~in involves a great leap on James's part from &-uh one kind of fiction to another , from one kind of world into another .
we're now into this world of dark sinister forces at work &-uh in the house of Bellegarde and it just doesn't really &-uh convince I think .
&-uh &~th this is the problem with the latter part of the novel .
but he's doing all of this &-uh to bring us to that scene that I asked you to write about for today .
&-uh that when Newman has in his possession this letter written by the Marquis as he's dying &-um and can +...
exact a revenge for all of the indignity he'd done him what does he do with it ?
and why +..?
and in a &~w a very important way this was James's initial idea .
this is the germ of the novel he wanted this great moment that when the American has been so terribly wronged you know as he says dealt this grievous wrong and has it in his power to pay back with interest what does he do and why does he do it ?
and is it the right thing to do ?
that's what I wanted you to pine on today .
mhm ?
well I thought that that there was no choice like as far as his character goes for him to do anything else but burn the letter .
because like he's so noble like he's presented as such a noble figure that like even as I read the last few chapters I'm like yeah right he's not gonna use the letter +/.
⌈ <did you> did you know that ?
oh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ he's just gonna like ⌋ yeah he's just gonna like get rid of the letter because it seemed so out_of character you know I'm gonna bring them down down down +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, I'm like but it was so melodramatic to me that it was just like no he's just ⌈ he's he's <not he's just> ⌉ .
⌊ do you and do you remember ⌋ an earlier scene we don't see it but he tells us about it where he had a business rival +/.
yeah +/.
+, in his power and he could have destroyed the business ⌈ rival ⌉ ?
⌊ but he ⌋ didn't .
and he didn't .
he was too what ?
he was too noble ⌈ for that to <to do it> ⌉ .
⌊ too noble too magnanimous ⌋ he's not that type ?
so you &~di you knew ahead of time are you you're sort_of prepared for this huh ?
yeah &-uh +/.
+, anybody else wanna jump in here ?
okay can we get a debate in any way going ?
should he have used the letter ?
Jean ?
&-um maybe he was sort_of you know he was set up there's a scene in which he meets the Marquis and her son I can never remember the title +/.
yeah +/.
+, in the park in which he says couldn't you have met me without my mother ?
and <I'll belittle> them as well I thought .
and there were a_couple_of scenes in which &~th there seemed to be a sort_of understanding between the two men between &-um Newman and the son the the &~the the Bellegarde .
<yeah the> yeah <the young> the young Marquis ?
yeah the young Marquis in which &-um each recognized the &-uh talents of the other or the the ingrained nobleness of the other .
well &~h he feels that way more about the mother I think doesn't he ?
he says to the &~Ma <the the> the the titles here are hard Marquis is the feminine and I guess Marquises is the plural <jumping in> &-um and he says to the Marquis &-uh I would have been your greatest admirer .
&-uh he in fact he sees some kinship I think between himself and her &-uh that they are you know in the way they're both sort_of daring bold &-uh the son is kind_of a a factotum isn't he ?
kind_of a wimp &-uh yeah his mother's always saying do something he says what ?
&-uh you_know and <he's not> he's not a great figure in the novel I think but but Newman does see a kind of +//.
you wonder if the Marquis had if the roles were reversed and she had a letter she could use on Newman not too much question she'd have stuck it in him and twisted it is there ?
I mean she &~i she's a pretty ruthless figure .
I mean anybody who would kill their husband over a question of who shall our daughter marry and if they disagree she poisons him &-uh I mean you know and <&-uh you_know> I think in some way &-uh James is meaning for us to see her as this great the as the French would say formidable@s:fra you know this this imposing sort_of figure &-uh and and Newman really admires her .
&-uh but is it that that keeps him from playing his trump card ?
mhm ?
&-um I guess I thought that in a way I kinda hoped that he would tell everybody about it just because they were so mean that you kinda didn't want them to get away with it .
that they deserved it .
yeah .
yeah .
&-um any of you feel that way ?
maybe I should have put it in this way if you'd been in Newman's place what would you have done with the letter ?
(0.6) not much juice in this question ?
&-uh <is it> is it is the story too stacked so that there's not really much doubt of what Newman's gonna do ?
and is that indeed not in some way James's point ?
you see &-uh +...
to take revenge would have lowered Newman's character to their level .
yeah .
&-uh I think that throughout the novel Newman was so built up to be this noble and great person just in_order_to have a shot <at even> at even ⌈ marrying her that ⌉ .
⌊ that's right he hasta ⌋ yeah .
that at the end of the novel he &~c he hadta burn the letter in order because that was in his character .
⌈ if he ⌉ +/.
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, if he would've if he wouldn't have burned it it &~wouldn't it would've been totally out_of his character and wouldn't have represented the first half of the novel at all .
okay .
okay &~that &~that he is so good and you know this is what Mrs Tristram says to him right at the end the Bellegardes never really feared you very much .
and that's the reason why mhm ?
that's that's what I think is so interesting (be)cause how I read the end was that after you know Mrs Tristram says you know you're a great person they were never <scared at the beginning> he kinda he looks back +/.
that's right +/.
+, and he wishes and he's you know he wishes he weren't that way or &~somethi you know ⌈ you kinda wonder if he does not ⌉ .
⌊ yeah that ending is ⌋ very interesting isn't it ?
&-uh this has caused of critical ink to be spilled .
&-uh what does that mean ?
that very last sentence where she &~sa says they bluffed you they they knew they could bluff you .
they counted on your good nature .
you see so that they they really you know if it's like a poker game they knew they could yeah .
and then so the last sentence as he sort_of looks back to see the letter to see if it was all burned does that indicate then that he wishes he hadn't been so gullible that he's having second thoughts ?
if he had the letter back now would he do something or is it just &-uh maybe she's right the letter's gone that's you know and <you can> you can interpret James loves these sort_of ambiguous endings you know that don't wrap everything up for you quite as &-uh concisely and neatly as you might have desired and so so there're there're there're very different ways of reading that great ending .
but clearly I think &-uh what James is wanting to do was to make Newman superior to the Bellegardes .
there is a passage in Shakespeare's The Tempest that I wanted to read to you &-um you probably don't know the story and I'm not gonna try to fill you in much on it but &-uh the central character Prospero &~i is a a a man who's learned magic and &~ha has in his power a group of people who did him a terrible wrong .
much more than the Bellegardes did to Christopher Newman &-uh they meant to kill him in fact &-um and now they're in his power &-uh and he can do with them &-uh what he will what he will &-uh and his servant of the air Ariel &-uh says &{l=READING your charm so strongly works on (th)em that if you beheld them your affection would become tender .
&}l=READING and Prospero says &{l=READING do you think so spirit ?
&}l=READING and Ariel says this is such great Shakespeare &{l=READING mine would sir were I human .
&}l=READING and &~i Prospero says &{l=READING and mine shall .
though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick .
yet with my nobler reason (a)gainst my fury do I take part .
the rare action is in virtue than in vengeance .
&}l=READING that's that's that's the great line .
&{l=READING the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance .
&}l=READING &-uh so in a sense he's saying paying people back in kind for what they did to you is never as noble never even as reasonable he says &-uh as acting virtuously kindly forgivingly .
it's a wonderful sentiment .
I don't buy it for a moment I'm the revenge type .
&=laughs:multiple mhm ?
&-um I also think that part of it is at the end of the story he's tired .
you know ?
he's he's endured so much &-um action and so much like injustice that at the end he comes he only has his himself and his character to draw upon his past &-um and he realizes I think that &-um to act to disgrace the Bellegarde's name would also be &-um to hurt those that he's come to to love most .
⌈ well but Valentin's dead and Claire would never know about it she's in a ⌉ .
⌊ because that's all he has yeah yeah because that's ⌋ all they had protecting them &-um Claire and Valentin that's the only thing .
he had everything you know he had money he has his personal honor he has all of that he just doesn't have a noble title and especially for those two and Valentin being dead his name his family name is pretty much all he had he didn't have &-um wealth or a career for himself ⌈ and so ⌉ .
⌊ but that would be ⌋ do you see that then as having a kind of an ulterior motive ?
I mean that <that he> that he does have a kind of what would you say &-uh reason other than just the goodness of the action itself to motivate him ?
does my question make sense to you ?
not so much .
I mean &~the &~a &~a <are you> are you saying that that &-uh there's still a certain amount of calculation in what Newman is doing where he says well if I did that I would hurt &~s these people or I would hurt myself in this way rather than it just being this completely generous disinterested which I hope you know doesn't mean uninterested action on his part ?
and I think part of it is a big part of it is calculated just like in the story even his affections for Claire part of it was calculated .
part of it was genuine I think you know that he actually +/.
⌈ that's right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ felt special ⌋ around her but part of it was +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, &-um his own motivation and his knowing that you know they had that she had that thing to +/.
+, yeah that's right +/.
+, offer to him and so I think the same way in the end part of it's virtue part of it's genuine and part of it's &-um his his knowing that &-um that that would hurt them +/.
+, okay &~l +/.
+, (be)cause there's nothing they can do to to defend that ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ let's look for just a minute at the ⌋ at the scene where he'd &~ac he actually decides that he's not going to take the revenge &~b a little before he &~bu burns the letter .
he's gone back to Paris after being in America for a while &-uh he you know is wandering around he goes into Notre Dame this this &~pa passage always amuses me greatly &-uh I I I don't know if you any of you have ever been to Paris have you ever tried to get into Notre Dame cathedral these days ?
it's like being in a New York subway at rush hour I mean you know it's just like and here he's all alone he can sit down and he can think and contemplate that sort of thing and I thought lots_of luck trying that these days .
&-um but here he is in Notre Dame &-um at the top of page four forty six +...
&{l=READING he leaned his head for a long time on the chair in front of him .
when he took it up he felt that he was himself again .
somewhere in his mind a tight knot seemed to have loosened .
he thought of the Bellegardes he had almost forgotten them .
he remembered them as a people he had meant to do something to .
he gave a groan as he remembered what he had meant to do .
he was annoyed at having meant to do it .
the bottom suddenly had fallen out_of his revenge .
whether it was Christian charity or unregenerate good nature what it was in the background of his soul I don't pretend to say .
but Newman's last thought was that of_course he would let the Bellegardes go .
if he had spoken it aloud he would have said that he did not want to hurt them .
he was ashamed of having wanted to hurt them .
they had hurt him but such things were not really his game .
&}l=READING so &-uh James is just wanting in a sense to present Newman as too noble to do anything vindictive or vengeful .
so that in the novel there's been a kind of complete reversal of values .
who is now the real nobleman what Benjamin Franklin would call nature's nobleman ?
&-uh and it's clearly Newman .
and what are the aristocrats except hypocrites forceurs@s:fra you know opposers xxx &-uh phonies ?
&-uh who have no real nobility for all of their blue blood for all of their title there's no real nobility in their behavior at all &~th this is the American's .
mkay so that rather than the novel in any way being a condescension on the part of Europe to the American the tables are turned &-uh it's a kind of condescension on the part of the American toward the Europeans .
which is not too surprising &~o we think in an American writer except that James in some ways &-uh was so much more attuned to Europe and its values than he was to America and its that it's in a way surprising of all writers for James to be the one to in a sense celebrate elevate &-uh almost &-uh canonize this this American +//.
not only an &~America American businessman .
you see that type so not exactly reviled but mocked &-uh &-uh and &-uh the the butt of so much &-uh criticism &-uh to make this figure then in some way the noblest figure in the book &-uh is in many ways a very striking reversal I think of &-uh expectation .
I think there was some nobility in &-uh when he goes to the older lady &-um Madame_D +/.
Outreville the duchess +/.
+, Outreville ?
right and the way she behaves where she doesn't allude to any of the bad things that have happened to Newman I think she behaves very nobly in that scene .
well he thinks she's just simply being &-um how shall we say it &-uh super subtle rather cunning .
&-uh &~le let me take this up with you just for a second &-uh this is in the stage where he still wants to expose the Bellegardes .
he's got that letter in his pocket and he's going around this is the the beginning he thinks of showing them up for what they are and the first person that he goes to is is is the old duchess the supposedly the most &-uh what ?
venerated figure in aristocratic France .
and he doesn't do it he doesn't show her the letter .
is it because &~h her the nobility of her character dissuades him +..?
his own view of this is &~wh what do you recall +..?
she would have believed it .
he had no he didn't doubt that that she would've believed him .
but &-uh she would in a sense have closed ranks with the Bellegardes .
she might even later who knows this is pure speculation she might even later have in some way criticized them .
but not to him not publicly not to an outsider you see .
so that he saw suddenly that he's dealing with &-uh people who even if he divulged this information they might indeed think much less of the Bellegardes but it would always be contained within those private walls <of the> of the Saint_Germaine .
does that make sense ?
and he realized in a way I don't know that +//.
I don't know how this affects our idea of his nobleness but he realizes in a way what's he gonna do with these letters if not burn them +..?
was there no National Enquirer in Paris then ?
no Hard Copy ?
no gossip columnist that you know couldn't you do something with this letter ?
it's it's partly it seems as if Newman doesn't have an avenue for his if he +//.
although I don't think that's what James wanted us to conclude .
you see that he didn't expose them because he simply had no means to do it I don't think James wanted us to view it in those terms but rather to see it as this act of great magnanimity .
there's another problem with this that I wanted to raise with you although in a way it's an illegitimate consideration &-uh I've always thought &~th &~tha that Newman did the wrong thing by burning the letters because I thought he owed something to the old Marquis .
the old Marquis &-uh gave the letter to Mrs Bread and said &-uh &-uh on page four fourteen &-uh &{l=READING he put it into her hands she said &~sh he put it into her hands with the solemn injunction that she was to make it public .
&}l=READING well she didn't she sat on it all these years (be)cause she didn't know what to do with it .
she gives it to Newman and tells him that what the Marquis wanted was for this to be made public .
we worry about the good name of the Bellegardes he didn't worry about the good name of the Bellegardes he said &{l=READING expose my wife for the murderers murderess that she is .
&}l=READING you see and I think that's what he should've done I &~would've I think he should've taken the letter to the police and turned it over to them and said do with it what you want to but &~i this woman &~o or her husband at least thinks this woman murdered him .
here's the evidence he has there's &~s we we the whole &~s situation is set up as if it's only a question of his revenge .
can Newman use the letter to get his revenge ?
nobody ever asks the question what about the justice to &-uh to the Marquis ?
mhm ?
I think like not only that but I think Valentin wanted him to expose them too (be)cause he knew .
⌈ yeah why he would tell him otherwise ⌉ ?
⌊ and by not ⌋ yeah and by not doing it like he kind of destroyed Mrs Bread's and Valentin's and the old Marquis not just the old Marquis and like if he &~w didn't wanna do it himself he should've just told like Mrs Tristram and the whole world would've found ⌈ out ⌉ .
⌊ &~i &~th ⌋ that's true she'd have +/.
⌈ there ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ spread the word ⌋ .
but I mean I I I would see this not as a moral matter but as a legal matter .
now he says to Mrs Bread later that she's beyond the reach of the law .
but how does he know ?
he never tried .
⌈ mhm ⌉ ?
⌊ that's ⌋ what I was gonna say I thought the book had like kind_of a a decent discussion about how she would never be convicted .
and maybe she wouldn't .
but it was that was it Newman's judgment to make ?
in other words isn't he burning evidence of a crime &-uh purely for his own moral &~self-satisfact as I say I think this is an illegitimate consideration I've injected here because James doesn't make that really part of the calculus of the novel .
but still when I was reading the novel I thought hey wait a minute you know +/.
mhm +/.
+, he owes something to this dead man who wrote this letter you know this dying letter almost with his life's blood &-uh saying &-uh &-uh <I want> I want this crime to be known you know I don't wanna just die +...
what with no consequences .
take this letter give it to the police .
Newman has this letter in his possession he looks at it and says oh I would feel bad I would feel bad if I used this letter you see &-uh &-uh &~m my moral character would suffer if I were to in any way be &~s be seen as getting <in there> I say screw that &~gi you know give the police the letter that's the way it should be done .
there's that conversation about slinging mud which I thought was really interesting and there really is no way I mean it's still true today there's no way to sling mud without getting your hands dirty .
and so I mean ⌈ even to go to the police ⌉ .
⌊ well but going to the police ⌋ wouldn't be slinging mud would it ?
mhm .
⌈ I &~b I &~b they what they don't hafta know ⌉ .
⌊ it &~wa <he would> he would be involved ⌋ .
well all I can say is if I were in Newman's place I (woul)d've gone to the police and said &=laughs:S4 +"/.
+" here here's a letter .
+" this crime was committed we believe .
+" do with it what you will .
maybe they'd do nothing but you've done what you could to see that +...
&~ju no one ever said should justice be done in this case .
but James doesn't +//.
you_know that's outside the realm .
James doesn't even include that as a +...
well I think he briefly alludes to it .
but that would so deflect from the ideology that he's trying to develop and I I do think that there's a kind of argument .
let's not say ideology argument the kind of argument that he's wanting to develop in this novel would &~ha simply have been sidetracked and deflected by that kind of consideration .
he is wanting to make this novel he says the the light is always on Christopher Newman so he's always wanting to know what in Newman's character would his disposition of this letter reveal .
and what he's wanting to do is give us the noblest gesture of Newman's life to &~s show his superiority to this world that condescends to him .
that they are in fact &~o morally compromised and he's the one who emerges (0.5) sadly perhaps even tragically but nevertheless ennobled by the events of the story .
and and if we look at it then in terms of national characters &-um in a way the American triumphs over the French morally .
you see the American values insofar as Newman embodies them triumphs over the aristocratic value that &-uh which includes sort_of this hypocrisy and double dealing and subterfuge &-uh of the world of &-uh of of the Bellegardes and that's why I think that really his visit to the duchess &~i is a kind of reinforcement in that he sees that that they would not ever condemn openly for all the world to see one of their own .
they wouldn't wash their dirty linen in public so they'd rather in some way close ranks around a murderess than they would in any way to have the truth come out .
so that it's not simply the Bellegardes I think that scene is put there in my opinion &-uh in some way to show the the kind of corruptness <&~tha &-uh &-uh> a sort_of moral what would you say ?
&-uh laxity of of their whole class .
which after all going back to James for a &~s pretends to a kind of moral superiority .
what he's wanting to show is that's a complete counterfeit .
does this make sense to you ?
mhm ?
&-um I just actually had a quick question about that scene with the duchess .
&-um I'm &~l trying to find the page number so I'm gonna keep talking as I look for it .
but like it seems like <in that> &~s in that like that scene the point of view changes like really quick like to her point of view when she says she's gonna act charming and then like she won't like speak to him again is that like is that just our &~imagination or is that like +/.
⌈ no ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <at the time> ⌋ really just ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ no I I you know his his feeling is ⌋ she receives him +...
but <he doesn't> &~r he doesn't really matter to her she's in a way now ready to brush him off you know ?
&~b &-uh &-um he's had his few minutes with her and she's got other things to do and he you know &-um &~th <that he> that he sees that <he doesn't> he doesn't really count to them .
particularly now that he's not going to marry Claire .
he was kind_of getting an entree into their world now this is my interpretation of it he &~wa you know he &~m to some degree he mattered at the ball when he was being introduced to all these important people because he was about to marry Claire .
even then they were kind_of looking at him like he's this dancing bear .
and they &~ha they'll they have all these stories about him .
they said +"/.
+" &-uh is it true that you're the duke of California and &-uh you give land away to people who agree not to smoke cigars ?
and and then there're all these sorts of crazy legends about +//.
remember him when you read Gatsby .
there's an awful lot of Christopher Newman in Gatsby .
the same love of opulence and display and wanting to marry a woman who's &~inex so and so I've I've always thought that probably &-uh &-uh Fitzgerald had had read The American he certainly draw if he didn't draw from it they certainly are parallel in character but &-uh &~w despite their interest in him at the ball he's still an alien he's still a a a this curiosity .
and &~s so when he comes to visit the duchess again you know she receives him she sees him she's charming to him in her way but he realizes &-uh and this is what &~im he realizes that on her radar screen he doesn't really register .
you see ?
he doesn't matter ⌈ anymore in her world ⌉ .
⌊ yeah I understood ⌋ that but what I was just it was more like a stylistic question because &~i I found it it's on page it's like at the very bottom of page four twenty two .
⌈ four twenty two ⌉ ?
⌊ and like ⌋ yeah and like James writes &{l=READING he had come so reasoned the duchess &}l=READING and then like he puts a dash and like does it change to her point of view for like a sentence ?
like &{l=READING heaven knew why he had come &}l=READING +/.
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &~s after ⌋ <what happened> .
well I I think he's he's &-uh that that's &-uh you're right that is an interesting stylistic device because it's he's gonna give us the motive and then he kind of indicates Newman wasn't quite sure why he did it .
is that &~the &{l=READING he had come &~s &-uh so reasoned the duchess heaven knows why had come after what had happened and for &}l=READING I see &~you that this may &-uh oh I I oh you're right .
I'm sorry I was just reading it that this is the duchess's mind not his ⌈ xxx .
yeah ⌉ .
⌊ yeah that's what I was wondering was it ⌋ him or her ?
therefore she would be charming &-uh but she would never see him again .
okay yeah you're you're right for a minute at least we are in the duchess's mind .
I'll see him <I'll see what he> &~w I'll see what he wants I'll be charming to him &-uh but he's not +...
he doesn't matter to me I you know I've always wondered if he pulled out the letter and read it what would have been her reaction ?
I'm always wanting to rewrite people's books for them terrible fault .
&-um &-uh but when he tries to broach anything she always has ways of what deflecting it .
&{l=READING but then as the duchess went on relating a <&~m &~mo> which her mother had &-uh snubbed the great Napoleon it occurred to Newman that her evasion of a chapter of French history was more interesting to himself .
might possibly +//.
was more interesting to himself .
might possibly be the result of extreme consideration for his feelings .
perhaps it was delicacy on the duchess's part not policy &}l=READING .
see the &~w the the affair's been the not affair the engagement's been broken off what's she to say to him ?
&-uh and so what he's trying to convey I guess is something like the sense that the duchess was trying to talk to him without really saying anything ?
do you know those kind of conversations ?
yes +/.
+, where you talk to people and what you're really concerned with doesn't get discussed is that what's going on here ?
hm ?
and he he realizes this is sort_of exercising that Gallic &-uh finesse you know where you just get shown out_of the room and you realize I never got to say what I came to +//.
or I never said what I meant to say is that the situation here ?
&-uh I I I guess as interesting as the scene is in itself and it is a very interesting scene it's there probably to show that Newman realizes to some degree the complicity of that whole class in this kind of corruption +...
is that right ?
I mean is it &-uh what good would it have done to tell the duchess ?
what what would she have done with that information ?
would she've immediately started calling all of her friends and saying we can never have the Bellegardes to dinner again they're murderesses ?
&-uh you_know what what what do you +//.
and he says when he leaves why did I come here ?
<what did I> what did I think I was going to achieve ?
what did I expect ?
&-uh and in a sense there really was not much (0.7) I I I don't know what quite the word I'm searching for &-uh potential I suppose that of getting any satisfaction from telling the duchess .
was he going to feel better ?
if he could somehow besmirch the Bellegardes would he feel better ?
and he kind of comes away I guess thinking not really so &~a already you may have a kind of &-uh &-uh foreshadowing of his later complete &~reje burning of the letters .
what am I gonna do with these letters ?
nothing .
what can I do that would matter ?
nothing .
why did I even think about it ?
I'm embarrassed that I ever even considered <that so> .
although I'm a little bit bothered by the fact that James can't quite decide whether it's a purely noble generous decision on Newman's part or if it's just a practical consideration .
it has nothing to do with the letters .
&~i &~y you know there's no way to to get the kind of revenge I want .
I don't think he means I don't think James means to do the &~la the latter I think he very much means to do the former which is to make Newman's gesture seem all the more noble generous forgiving the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance that's what he wants to concentrate on .
but he does complicate it a little bit by showing in some of these other scenes that practically how would he get any revenge ?
&-um could the end also be a contrast ?
because it seems like throughout the majority of the novel &-um Newman's built up you know like his character's built up and you know he's so persistent and so strong and so invincible that maybe at the end he's presenting a contrast ?
like I remember reading on four thirty eight &-um you know he's talking about &~h he had no desire to make acquaintances and you know he thought a great deal of Madame_De_Cintre .
he lived over and over again the happiest hours he had known &-um he starts to think &{l=READING he asked himself in his quieter hours whether perhaps after all he was more commercial than was pleasant &}l=READING .
I think that he's &-um like in retrospect I think he's thinking about a_lot_of things that he may not have hadta think about before like in his solitude and in his &-um +/.
yes yes +/.
+, I I still feel that he's to a certain extent tired or a little bit down .
oh he is ⌈ yeah .
yeah he is ⌉ .
⌊ you know ⌋ I don't think it's like a you know carrying the flag up to the mountain and .
I see your point yeah .
no +/.
⌈ xxx strength ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you're absolutely right in fact ⌋ &-uh &~thi &-uh this is a very Jamesean denouement too in this sense that Newman who's always been <a a> a a practical gogetter a doer .
you know if there's a problem you grab it and you solve it this is what he's always saying to Valentin .
you've gotta take you know you've gotta take hold of life you've gotta grab it and and do things and make things happen you don't just you know let things happen to you .
so you can see that Newman had always been that kind of &-uh &~dr driving &-uh aggressive sort_of figure you know if there's a problem in the world you slap it around and get it into shape and take charge .
and now for the first time he realizes perhaps this is gonna sound a little pretentious but sort of the tragic dimension of life that there're things you can't control there're things that lie beyond your ability to to change .
&-uh and &-uh then that <he he> he he's a different man at the end I think he is noble you know and certainly James is wanting to say if you're contrasting these two societies these two characters surely surely we would agree I think the American emerges as the the better the nobler you know the the the victory goes in that &~sen in the moral sense clearly to the American .
but at the same time , that sort of American belief that every problem has a solution , the can_do attitude +//.
what's the CB's motto ?
you know sort_of the can_do &-uh that that &-uh that that's shown to be an illusion to some &~e +//.
and that in a way Newman has met the complexity of the old world all the subtlety and intricacy and to a degree he's been defeated by that in that sense that that the world is a much more complex +...
and confining you know he he one of the &~w interesting questions that I always say where would he and Claire have gone to live if they had gotten married ?
<where would> &~th where would they belong ?
and he sort_of says to her we have the whole world to choose from you know we could go anywhere we can do anything that notion that you've got all sorts of possibilities and Claire is sort_of well you know is that is everything really possible ?
you know to her European sensibility his American optimism seems to be really over generous .
well perhaps also &-um Newman's aggressiveness always came from his self-interest .
he always has something to gain by his solving problems and in this case he really has nothing left to gain from the situation +/.
that's right .
+, he's not acting for the higher noble cause of exposing French aristocracy but rather it's just you know he wanted to find a wife well he can't do that now he wanted to learn of the higher you know learn about this higher society and he doesn't like what he sees so there's really no motivation for him to continue with his ⌈ actions xxx ⌉ .
⌊ that's that's true but ⌋ &~i &~u &-um &~i we &~b we may be saying in a way the same thing in sort_of different ways .
when he has the letter &~h first he wants to use it .
you know .
&~h I've got this letter he has a sort_of aggressive attitude I've gotta do something with it .
so first he thinks he can get Claire back that's his original plan he thinks <he can> he can in a sense sort_of leverage Claire out_of the &~Be Bellegarde's grip with this letter .
he finds out she's at the convent that's over so there's no practical use in that .
he's still got the idea okay you know maybe I can't get her back but I certainly can in some way pay them back for what they did to me so he &~think that's his next line of attack he's starts to do that but then he realizes this thinks so what ?
so that in one way he he's left with that sense of &-uh of no more possibilities there's nothing to do .
if you're a doer all your life you know and suddenly you're faced with a situation where there's nothing for you to do there's nothing you can do +...
it must be a really maturing sort_of insight and a very in some ways a very depressing one you know .
are there things in the world I can't change &~i you know I I have to face this and there's nothing I can do about it .
and so in one way I think James would say that Newman has learned that lesson &-uh and I don't mean to make this altogether nationalistic but I think he's saying in some way it's the naive American who thinks everything is possible coming into this contact with Europeans who are much more aware of or accepting of the limitations of life .
you know again going back to to Valentin .
Valentin is saying to him you're so lucky .
you've got the whole world you can go out and do anything and he says to so could you .
and Valentin says no you don't understand I have a position in life that in a way traps me or limits me .
&-uh there're all sorts of things I can't do .
there're many things I can't do most things I can't do .
and Newman says ah come to America with me .
if we go to America you have all these possibilities you know I'll put you in a bank you could make some money .
and Valentin says that sounds good .
but but on the other hand the reality of his situation is that he's much more confined much more limited .
&-um and so again to kind_of reduce this to nationalistic attitudes the Americans are more optimistic they see everything as possible why not ?
let's try it you know if you haven't tried it how do you know you can't do it ?
so that that you know sort_of pushing can_do attitude on the other hand we think of the European attitude as being much more we've lived longer we've seen more we know what the limitations are we accept them .
&-uh and so in a way you could say that &~New Newman is almost Europeanized by his experience into the limits the limitations of life and sort_of the tragic dimensions of life .
but as is often the &~ca <I don't> I don't want to say The American is a tragedy that's too grandiose but that in a way as in tragedies out_of the suffering the hero learns something &-uh and so he learns a kind of &-uh chastened nobility .
his his original good nature and generosity &-uh is in a some sense refined &-uh by the &~b by the experience that he has in Europe .
&-um &-uh so he he's a sadder but wiser man at the end would we agree on that ?
but he I just wanna &~th &~i I don't mean to overstress this point but I just wanted to say what's in some ways so surprising is that if there is some +...
battle going on some contest going on between what it is the Bellegardes represent and what it is that Newman represents there's no question whatever it is that Newman represents emerges from this novel as the morally +...
superior element &~s &-uh the &-uh if it's a clash of class and money we often think &-uh Newman only represents money .
and the the Bellegardes class in the sense of status and so on but &-uh the there is a sense in which James is kind_of subverting those categories and that that &-uh the real nobleman of this novel is Newman I think &-um Newman .
well what else do we wanna say about the novel ?
Jean do you have a comment or a question ?
I'm just you know &~i I'm for the noblemen though .
&=laughs I mean there's there's still a comment that and and Mrs Tristram's character I find +/.
⌈ yeah .
yes very ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ so interesting too because she ⌋ travels through two worlds like James does .
+, she does +/.
+, and you know I don't know what her underhanded motives are necessarily for getting him started on this journey +/.
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ to ⌋ begin with and they're they're obviously not single+minded necessarily on her part .
and they talk about that right at the end where he says to her why did you ever start this in the first place ?
was it just curiosity on your part ?
and she says &-uh what ?
do you remember this ?
&-uh can we get it's very very near the end &-uh it's an interesting passage &-uh four twenty eight .
he says to her &{l=READING was it &~cur curiosity that you urged me to try and marry her ?
a little said Mrs Tristram growing still more audacious .
Newman gave her the one angry look he had been destined ever to give her turned away and took up his hat she watched him for a moment and then she said that sounds very cruel but it is less so than it sounds curiosity has a share in almost every thing I do .
I wanted very much to see first whether such a marriage could actually take place and second what would happen if it should take place .
so you didn't believe said Newman resentfully .
yes <I believed> I believed it would take place and that you would be happy .
otherwise I should have &-uh been among my speculations a very heartless creature but she continued laying her hand upon Newman's arm and hazarding a grave smile it was the highest flight ever taken by a tolerably bold imagination &}l=READING &-uh I thought she could pull it off but it was the most audacious or the most daring idea I ever had .
xxx could but I thought you could mhm ?
it kinda seemed like she did it for like her own like entertainment .
yeah .
+, like just to like sit back and watch the soap opera unfold and +/.
+, yeah .
+, what's gonna happen so .
exactly .
I don't think xxx +/.
that's what she means by curiosity I just wanted to see what would happen .
I don't think that's a good enough reason .
&=laughs:multiple .
yeah .
James the James's fiction is full of people like this .
&-uh I think the greatest of all James novels although obviously xxx is Portrait of a Lady .
and in it &-uh a young man Ralph Tuchett manages for his cousin Isabel Archer to inherit a_lot_of money a great deal of money because he says he wanted to see what would happen to her in the world if she had wings to fly anywhere .
this money's gonna free her he thinks .
give her all this money I just wanna see what would happen to her .
<do you> do you remember that old show the the Millionaire ?
not Who Wants to Be a Millionaire it used to be the guy who would go around and give people a million dollars .
someone would show up and knock on your door millionaire and say Jean what Tipton Thomas something &~Ja well anyway .
&-uh he and because he just wanted to see what would this person do if you said they had a million dollars what would this person do ?
and of_course a_lot_of times the stories were terrible .
&~tha you know awful things would happen .
but they were just satisfying their &~curios so Ralph Tuchett in Portrait of a Lady just wants to see what will happen to my cousin if she's suddenly made extremely wealthy ?
you see and pretty awful things happen to her &-uh and to some degree that's what's true of Mrs Tristram here .
I just wanna see .
you remember when he goes to her and tells her about the party he's planning she says &-uh it's &-uh what's her first word ?
odious .
it's delicious .
you see ?
it's a terrible party to give .
I love it .
you you so you know her kind of character don't you ?
she just likes to see in a way she likes to cause trouble or you know just &-uh throw the golden apple in the midst of all the people and see how they're gonna fight over it .
so yeah I think that <she's a> she's a fascinating character as a kind_of a &~obser and if you wanna make it psychological you could say she's bored you know her husband's a dimwit she has nothing else to do so why not just arrange people's lives meddle a little see if I can't cause some excitement hm ?
&-uh &-uh James says as I say this often catalyst sort of character who looks and says let's see what will happen if we do such and such .
Jean did you have a ?
I don't know I I was just trying to I wish I could've found the spot then I mean I I sorta wanna discount her now when she talks about how aristocratic it was for the Bellegardes to you know &~g get rid of him in ⌈ spite of the money that they wanted ⌉ .
⌊ yeah yeah yeah no you ⌋ no you you she said it &~wa they gave you up for an ideal +/.
mhm +/.
+, she says .
that really &~a she says that really was aristocratic .
that they would sacrifice all this money for a you know for a principle .
&-uh and that you know if you believe that then you would say yeah they really +//.
&-uh is that &-uh they they had in effect lived up to their principle they were about to sell out but at the last moment the Marquis says I could not reconcile myself to a commercial person .
we just we tried to swallow it and we just couldn't .
we gagged .
&~a and so that in some way you could say she was really acting out_of principle .
on the other hand when Lord Deepmere comes to the ball that night isn't she trying to get him to court Claire right under her fiance's nose ?
&-uh you know the very night that their engagement is being announced the mother's over there saying to somebody else I take it that's what they're talking about &-um and Lord Deepmere has no great interest in Claire but he's &~v filthy rich and so the mother is the one who's behind the scenes trying to sabotage this engagement and maybe get Lord Deepmere to .
but was it you know there was a comment made that she maybe she did she do this well he was getting at revenge but wasn't the final straw where she hadta escort him +/.
⌈ yes ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ around ⌋ to meet her friends anyway ?
I mean she was already at that point .
⌈ yeah at the end of her yeah ⌉ .
⌊ &~w &~sh I think without yeah ⌋ Deepmere whatever &~his I couldn't remember &~th on your factoid either &-um &=laughs:multiple I mean she was gonna give him up I mean +/.
yeah +/.
+, they were gonna ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ well ⌋ that that night &-uh &~h &~p he put +//.
and he kind of knows he's doing this too Newman kind of you know knows that he's pushing this to the limit .
he says take my arm and let's walk you know so that they kind of do a &~h it's like a victory lap for him .
you see this is the he says this is the greatest night of his life .
he's now reached the pinnacle .
poor boy lived on the streets made his money for himself climbed the ladder to him now if what he's after is status this is it .
you see all of these French aristocrats gathered together he's nabbed the daughter you know he's he's he's got the prize and now he makes the mother kind +//.
who's really in some way the one he's defeated if you see this as a contest you know he's he's bought from them his money has trumped their status .
and that this this kind of victory lap around the room with the old Marquis on his arm is is is he's showing off .
and it's &~a &~i &~th <there's a> there's a scene +//.
it's kind_of a_little farfetched .
but there's a scene in &-uh Agamemnon where &-uh the the wife is wanting to destroy her husband , persuades him to walk on the purple carpet that's sort_of reserved for the gods you_know .
and &~i it's it's it's that moment where his hubris his his what pride in himself is pushed to the extreme .
and so that that that scene's been this scene has been compared to something like that that Newman just pushes it so far and that perhaps it's at that moment when the &~duch where the &-uh Marquis realizes as much as we'd like to get our hands on all that money &-uh we can't swallow it .
you know so that the next it's not the next day but it's a few days after he comes and that's when she says I've told my daughter she must break off her engagement .
&-um and I love that line .
+" I cannot reconcile myself to a commercial person .
you_know somebody who used to make washtubs .
&-uh so that that you can see okay that that &~i they are in a way living up to their aristocratic ideal .
although it is undermined a little bit if you think she's got Lord Deepmere waiting in the wings so she can dump this guy and still marry her daughter .
but there's no great clear indication that Lord Deepmere has any interest in Claire .
and indeed &-um it's very interesting I think that we see him again at the end this is the answer to the question I asked you today did you all get it ?
with &-uh &~Neo Noemie Nioche who's this courtesan now he's obviously taken her up she's there as his what would you say these days squeeze ?
&-uh and they're &-uh &-uh her father always said so you know if my daughter dishonors our name if she becomes a fallen woman someday I'll shoot her and Newman says I kept looking in the newspapers but I never saw any &=laughs news story that he'd shot her so but the +//.
I think the reason for including that scene at the end is to show that Lord Deepmere whose cousin in a sense she's whose death &-uh &-uh she's responsible for &-uh has nevertheless taken up with her .
he's forgotten eh Valentin .
you_know that was then , this is now .
and she's a real good lay .
&-uh and so their you_know their &-uh this kind of corruption their keeping company <at that> &-uh at that stage is again I think showing something of the &-uh &-uh &-uh +...
what would you say selling out &-uh that the aristocrats are willing to do for for Deepmere to have taken as his mistress this woman who's implicated in his cousin's death .
&-uh and and he's embarrassed by it he kinda you know he he tries to explain it away to Newman but &-uh the very fact that he's embarrassed by it shows that he's having to rationalize &-uh a choice that's +...
questionable to put it mildly .
well anything else about The American that we wanna touch on +..?
well lemme shift gears for a few minutes then &-uh to prep you for &-uh what we'll do next week .
&-um if James was a little bit too rarified for you did I ever quote to you that wonderful line of Clover Hooper's ?
Clover Hooper was a very witty woman married to Henry Adams who was one of the great American intellectuals and she knew all the famous people of her day .
and she had one of the best comments about Henry James and his novel .
she said it's not that Henry bit off more than he could chew but that he chewed more than he bit off &-uh and a_lot_of readers sort_of feel that way .
James does go on &-uh and it it gets more elaborate the older he got where he could +//.
&-uh HG Wells once did a parody of James where he imagines this great cathedral with stained glass windows and the organ playing and this huge edifice and you get toward the altar and there on the altar you see a dead cat a bit of string .
that &~a that all of this whole elaborate edifice is built up for this kind of you know very minor little payoff .
and so there are readers who have felt that way about James's you_know overelaborateness and oversophistication too many nuances and this sort_of thing .
&-uh and The American by contrast is quite for James quite a simple novel , an early &-uh kind_of straightforward sort_of novel compared to what he did later .
but &~i in any case &-uh if &-uh you've had enough James to satiate you for a while &=laughs &-uh you'll see Jack London who we'll look at next is a very very different kind of writer .
James as I suggested to you was from the old money &-uh you know Cambridge Newport set &-um who spent most of his life in in Europe anyway &-um but insofar as he is an American was very much part of that eastern seaboard Eurocentric &-um class .
Jack London &-uh was the illegitimate child of &-uh &-uh a fortune teller &-uh and &-uh an itinerant spiritualist .
&-uh his mother when she was six months pregnant married a different man who was named London also John London .
and so that Jack had &~th this man's name all of his life .
but he found &-uh early in his twenties that that the man he had thought was his father really wasn't .
and &-uh he as people in that situation often do went looking for his real father who who was really just a kind of con artist a charlatan <that sort of thing> .
&-uh they were very poor his whole life &-uh or in his childhood his parents were very poor living sort_of hand to mouth &-um and London belonged not so much to the working class as to what Marx would call the the lumpin@n proletariat &-uh the class below the working class &-um the the sort_of unemployed &-uh &-uh what semicriminal class .
&-uh at a very early age Jack London was &-uh &-uh an oyster pirate which meant that used to go around at night stealing the catches from other men's boats the oyster fishermen who'd gone out and caught their catch would dock overnight and and London and his compatriots would rob them &-uh of their catch .
&-uh &-uh &-um but &-um and that that &~th that was I guess his earliest job was to be a thief &-uh he was a hobo &-uh joined &-uh something called Cox's army that was gonna march on Washington except he and some of the other guys went ahead of it and claimed they were gathering up &-uh supplies for them and &=laughs would run off with the food .
they had &-um spent some time in jail in &-uh Niagara Falls New York &-uh for vagrancy &-um so that he had you know here was Henry James going to Harvard and +...
spending his days in the Louvre here's Jack London hoboing it spending his time in the Niagara Falls jail .
&-uh he went to &-uh Alaska in the gold rush and prospected for gold &-uh all of this before he was twenty one .
&-uh he had &-uh well London died &-uh when he was forty one having written fifty books .
that always astounds me I I kind of wanna blot it out .
&-um but &-uh that old &-uh &~p saying live fast die young leave a good looking corpse &-uh was pretty much the credo that London lived by .
&-uh &~a and &-uh &~h the novel then that we'll read &-uh of London's Martin Eden is &-uh highly autobiographical not totally so .
this whole question of &-uh autobiographical novels is a very tangled tortured one .
&-uh but in its broad outlines the story of Martin Eden and the story of Jack London up to a certain point &-uh run remarkably parallel so that what we're going to &-uh get in some ways for the first time is the Horatio Alger story told from the inside .
&-uh clearly &-uh Horatio Alger's telling us the story of Ragged Dick is really told by an adult who is trying to imagine what it was like being this street kid but in some ways really giving &-uh &-uh Dick the perspective and the motives of an adult &-uh he very quick you know almost overnight Dick suddenly gets converted to what ?
cleaning himself up going straight &-uh working hard banking his money &~th &~th those are not the &~f fourteen year+old attitudes would you agree with me on that ?
and &~th &~v very in a sense very much Alger makes Dick a kind of premature adult so that he can teach thrift and hard work and &~provi &-uh &-uh providence and that sort of thing .
&-uh and &-uh then when &-uh Henry James takes the same kind of character he passes over it so quickly .
there are those few pages in which we have &-uh Newman's childhood and his making himself a millionaire but James really had no knowledge of that no firsthand knowledge of that .
and so he gets it you know over with in very short order and just sort of decrease it .
that's gonna be the given of the story .
&-uh here we have this self-made millionaire .
where do we see him ?
we see him sitting in the Louvre looking at art .
that's where the story opens .
and everything before that is is very very lightly sketched because James had no idea at all what it was like to have been &-uh a poor kid you_know living hand to mouth sleeping in a box on the street .
London did London is going to write now &-uh from the perspective of someone who's been down and out what he called in the abyss .
he decided in fact one day when he was I think when he was sitting in jail +"/.
+" two things can happen to me .
+" <I can> what can happen to me is what happened to all the people around me .
+" they're losers .
+" they're in this pit the abyss .
+" they're never gonna climb out .
+" they're gonna be victims all their life .
+" &-uh <you can> I can accept that or +//.
he says +"/.
+" &-uh I can find some way out_of this .
+" &-uh and I don't want it to be manual labor .
+" that's no way out .
+" it hasta be intellectual labor .
so London just sort_of said to himself one day +"/.
+" I'm bright .
+" <I can> I can think my way out_of the abyss .
and indeed he does .
so what we're gonna &-uh Martin Eden is then that very personalized account of &-uh &-uh of this climb out_of the abyss off &~livi off living <in the> in the streets to &-uh well you'll see to what .
&-uh there're some things in Martin Eden that will seem improbable as there were in in Ragged Dick the only difference is they happened to London .
so that &-uh &-uh when the cards start falling in in &-uh &-uh Martin Eden's direction &-uh or in his favor &-um that's almost exactly what happened to to London .
so from being this poor obscure &-uh nobody to almost overnight fame and fortune was exactly what had happened &-uh to &-uh Jack London .
so there're things I'll try to fill in for you &-uh &-uh that I think help in comparing the &-uh the life and the work &-uh since I haven't given you a writing assignment for &-uh +...
to take home with you today you can assume then that you're gonna have one in class next time &-uh and if you want a hint I'm about to give you one &-uh think laundry +...
that's my hint .
think laundry .
so I think you'll see what I mean .
okay .
xxx .
mine yours .
okay <very good> very good
