okay, your last one . 275665_277011
what is the answer ? 277011_278586
so Chi Yan . 278586_282275
why are you thinking about it for so long ? 282275_284430
negative four . 284430_286486
so you must know that, if uh, a a@l squared is equal to nine, there is two sorry, there are two answers . 286486_294461
there are two answers +... 294461_295611
to make uh, a@l squared equal to nine . 295611_298230
the values of a@l may be positive three or negative three . 298230_303556
why ? 303556_303990
because negative three times negative three is nine . 303990_307676
and three times three is also equal to nine . 307676_312723
okay ? 312723_313243
so there are two answers . 313243_314295
so if uh, before the square root, there is uh there is no sign, it shows it is a positive . 314295_321775
if, in front of the square root sign, there is a negative then the answer is negative . 321775_328070
okay ? 328070_329078
do you know do you know how to express ? 329078_331285
okay . 331285_333510
so now, we'll go to another question . 333510_337188
if now, I want to find what is the value of, uh, a@l if the square of a@l is nine . 337188_345890
now, I'm I just want to find the values of a@l . 345890_349323
I only to uh I I want to find the value of a@l . 349323_352283
okay ? 352283_353978
but now uh is is there any request about a@l ? 353978_359148
a must be positive or negative ? 359148_361393
no . 361393_362626
so how do we &~wri write this ? 362626_364481
so in this case, it's similar . 364481_367330
a squared equal to nine because it is given that the square of a@l is nine . 367330_374583
next, so we know that there are there are two answers . 374583_377608
so how to write this ? 377608_379105
so a@l +... 379105_380423
the one of the answer is negative nine or +... 380423_386351
there are two answers, one of these is square root of nine . 386351_394911
the other +... 394911_396711
the other is +... 396711_398970
La Lai Chi Fu . 398970_403871
negative . 403871_407480
negative +... 407480_407878
square +... 407878_409478
root +... 409478_411790
square root of nine . 411790_413845
of nine . 413845_414268
okay . 414268_414830
so that means square root of nine . 414830_417103
so you just combine the two questions, okay ? 417103_419940
so before, uh, if it is positive, then it is positive square root of nine . 419940_424861
so, this is the positive square root of nine . 424861_427636
and then this one, you want to find a negative, then there is a negative . 427636_431461
it's the same, okay ? 431461_433460
so in this case, you can find the answer, this is equal to one and then this is equal to negative three . 433460_440980
so if in the question, uh, you you want to find, uh, the value of a@l +... 440980_446086
and then, you know a@l may be positive or negative, so you can express like this . 446086_453451
so there are two answers . 453451_455215
do you have any questions ? 455215_457468
if there is no question, please do it by yourself . 457468_460683
ah . 460683_461533
yes, do it in your classwork . 461533_463670
okay, find this do these two classworks okay ? 463670_519070
two questions . 519070_519508
so each of uh each of the questions, you can find two answers, okay ? 519508_525973
two answers in each question . 525973_558960
