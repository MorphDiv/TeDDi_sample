will we get the computer to do that for us ? 0_3186
you need to do a little can I just do this ? 3186_11995
before you do that, you just need to select the angles that you want . 11995_16521
or any other measurements for that matter . 16521_18540
then go calculator . 18540_20808
now what it allows you to do is, you say that angle plus that angle plus . 20808_29306
it will actually build it up for you like so . 29306_31416
oh, thanks . 31416_32340
how do you do a degree sign ? 32340_67310
um, mm . 67310_70913
good question . 70913_72003
let me try . 72003_72896
I'm not sure if you can do it easily . 72896_75433
something there . 75433_80136
maybe that looks like a degree sign . 80136_82240
thank you . 82240_84130
xxx . 84130_87330
I also have another question . 87330_88058
if these three have to go go into a new sketch and make other . 88058_92618
yeah . 92618_94233
that's, that's what they're asking about down here where they talk about some of the measurements in these polygons . 94233_100680
they're talking about ones +/. 100680_103258
okay . 103258_104383
because if you have more sides you might get a higher total might might'n you ? 104383_107778
so +... 107778_108391
but we don't . 108391_110095
um, Mister Brown ? 110095_110920
do we have to go on to do +... 110920_113726
do we have to go on to do +/. 113726_120903
what's hang on I'm trying to read that . 120903_122326
when you move parts of the pentagon angles change in degrees, but this does not affect the sum . 122326_132368
yes the sum of the exterior angles are the same for any convex polygon which is three hundred and sixty degrees . 132368_141391
is that right ? 141391_142235
yeah, I'd sort of maybe suggest that you put the bit about the three hundred and sixty degrees first . 142235_149496
and then say, and discuss the change if you change the uh polygon . 149496_154961
okay . 154961_155456
but yeah, it's good . 155456_156256
do we have to go xxx ? 156256_159488
yes . 159488_160025
I don't think we really have time to do much of that today, but save this one before you go any further . 160025_164871
uh, that's probably about all we're going to have time for . 164871_168823
people, I think we're going to have to finish off for now . 168823_175040
so, if you haven't already saved, you need to save it at this stage . 175040_180688
if you've saved it before then, re save it just to get the most up_to_date thing . 180688_188615
we'll come back to that later . 188615_189886
can you save and close off, log out . 189886_194040
and if you go back to your seats in the middle of the room please . 194040_196918
when you're choosing a name for it, try and choose a name that actually means something . 196918_206318
Mister Brown, when we use the computer calculator, we got three hundred and sixty and when we did it on my calculator, got to three hundred and fifty nine . 206318_226485
yeah . 226485_226935
the reason probably is these one's these one's are rounded off slightly . 226935_233068
now the computer probably knows that that's really ninety point two and that's really seventy three point one . 233068_238820
so it's it hasn't displayed the decimals, but it's sort of got it in it's memory and it's included that in the total as well . 238820_245013
pack up ? 245013_274045
yes you can pack up . 274045_275216
people, just before you go, we got about as far as I thought we would in that amount of time . 275216_283418
and obviously that's only about half way through the thing . 283418_287106
but just before you go, who found that their conjecture or prediction was confirmed by what they did ? 287106_295848
now not everyone had a prediction that the total was going to be three hundred and sixty . 295848_301960
some predicted one hundred and eighty . 301960_304368
a few people had quite different predictions such that all the angles will be less than ninty degrees . 304368_309296
um, which is another one, others might not have thought of that one but you could test that conjecture as well . 309296_315440
okay, we'll be continuing on with this at a later stage . 315440_319873
