you guys all proved, all the students here just proved that nine students are wearing laces and five are not . 7215_15435
so who could make a statement or who could say a sentence using the words more or less ? 16235_25575
who could make a sentence ? 25835_26815
I wonder, S_one ? 28065_31285
I don't know . 31285_37465
do you want to, what do you notice ? 38405_39945
are there more students wearing laces or less students wearing laces ? 40285_47385
less students are wearing laces . 48605_51145
okay . 51865_52525
so you think less students are wearing laces . 52845_56045
but how many students are wearing laces ? 56525_58125
what's this number here ? 58365_59325
nine . 60045_62205
nine ?
okay . 63125_63325
and what's this number here ? 63445_64405
five . 64665_65205
five . 65225_65425
S_one, let me ask S_one this, which number is bigger or more ? 65805_70565
is nine bigger or is five bigger ? 70725_73605
nine bigger . 73985_75025
nine's bigger . 75305_76325
thank you S_one . 76785_78405
can someone else help us make a sentence and use the word more ? 78165_82005
let's just use the word more . 82185_83925
S_two ?
the nine is more than five because if you put nine blocks, it's going to put five blocks and it is more than five and the nine is more than five . 88365_106405
can you come on up and prove that to us ? 106465_108125
how do you know that ? 108265_109045
you're saying, do you see, just wait one sec . 109665_111925
do you agree or do you disagree with S_two ? 112425_115725
do you agree or disagree that nine is more than five ? 116125_120285
okay, I see a lot of students that agree . 120545_123245
I see a few that disagree . 123405_124505
okay, all right, let's see S_two . 125845_128045
see if you can prove it to us . 128125_129845
because this one is taller than the five, because the five is shorter and the nine is bigger . 130845_138705
did you all hear S_two ? 139065_140165
yeah . 140525_140885
who can restate what S_two just said ? 141145_143465
who can say it again ? 143525_144405
who could say what S_two just said ? 144825_148865
S_four, did you hear S_two ? 149045_150625
yes . 150965_151565
can you say it in a louder voice ? 151905_153265
you said the nine +... 153725_154665
what did you say ? 154845_155445
the nine is more than the five because the nine is bigger and then five is shorter . 155705_164365
all right ? 164825_165345
so, and we're sure there's nine here ? 165645_168145
yes . 168365_168805
okay . 168985_169245
do you want to double check ? 169405_169705
you have to count with everybody . 169725_171465
okay . 171455_171855
let's double check . 172055_172815
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine . 173355_182955
okay . 183015_183315
so we have the correct amount of cubes there . 183495_185315
now double check, make sure we have five cubes here . 185535_187975
one, two, three, four, five . 188195_193515
so the nine is taller right here and the five is right there . 195345_201285
so, the nine is more than five and a lot of people choose this and least people choose five . 201645_212985
very interesting S_two, very interesting . 213245_217125
thank you . 217585_218005
can anyone else say what S_two said in different words ? 218545_222885
because there was a lot of information that she looked, she looked at the data here . 223765_227725
she looked at where we chose and she decided that this tower of nine is what ? 228365_235785
is taller than the tower of five . 236125_240245
so does that mean nine is more than five ? 240465_242945
S_five, you want to come on up and tell us ? 243345_245565
this one is too big, not big . 248555_252535
okay . 252755_253035
this one is not big . 253215_254815
is this one big ? 255055_255635
yeah . 255915_256395
oh, so that one's bigger ? 256935_259135
mm-hmm . 259495_260035
so if this one's bigger +... 260475_263295
touch which one has more cubes . 264095_265995
this one . 267015_267675
this one has more cubes, it's bigger . 267895_270195
so nine is more than five . 270775_273475
so are more people wearing shoelaces today ? 274025_278065
yeah . 278105_278645
thank you S_five . 279045_280365
