uh@fp no, I'm gonna take my team members out to lunch . 59340_62140
that is +//. 59340_62140
using it to redecorate the lab ? 61350_62680
maybe . 62970_66270
&=breath &=smack it depends on what kind of ideas you guys come up
&=laugh &=breath I I think uh@fp Matthias should be
uh@fp yes . 70370_77650
Matthias should be permanently on the desk . 70370_77650
we need uh@fp &=breath three couches . 70370_77650
&=breath what do you think ? 70370_77650
<couches who do you've got> couches . 77450_80470
<who do you've got> do you have a place to put them ? 77450_80470
couches ? 77790_78620
couches, yeah . 78450_79450
l@i &=noise l@i leather . 78530_80380

&=laugh . 84580_85970
&=laugh . 84630_85740
&=laugh . 84920_85860
<one of them can go> &=breath I don't know . 86690_89310
<behind th@i> behind there ? 89230_90670
yeah . 89900_95950
we could do something with that area . 89900_95950
&=breath <if we c@i> yeah, if we move out all those monitors,
yep . 95690_96190
&=smack <as a coffee> a coffee table or something ? 96500_98700
wh@i +//. 96680_97090
yeah . 99500_101060
sure . 99500_101060
put a couch in front of the cables so nobody messes with them . 102000_104290
that actually would not be a bad idea . 104480_106650
&=breath . 104480_106650
&=laugh &=breath no, it has been pretty good . 105380_112100
people don't mess with them too often . 105380_112100
it is not like the old lab . 105380_112100
&=laugh that was +//. 105380_112100
&=laugh . 110890_111700
well, &=breath hes@fp there was no semblance of order there, even .
<I mean> &=throat the hes@fp you know, I mean, look
they were all on the floor . 112550_125600
every single one of them . 112550_125600
that was a pain . 113570_114470
no ? 116220_116780
yeah . 124600_125110
in various corners, yeah . 125750_127390
yes . 127030_134290
&=breath &=smack so, you had to like, you know, know the exact
mhm . 134110_134560
there is a big problem in my office . 135950_138100
&=laugh . 137810_138880
did we say that ? 143040_144030
what ? 144170_144850
the I think the message to the terminally ill decided to
yeah . 150460_151460
&=laugh . 151410_152110
I think we're having some problems today . 151740_153700
well, what was funny was th@i hes@fp earlier in the thing, it
yeah, it was doing that yesterday when Alex started . 157440_163090
<is that a> uhm@fp what do you think <that is> the
could be anything . 162780_164120
&=breath . 162780_164120
just when it starts up, though, and then it seems to catch +//. 163940_166320
&=smack no, no . 165290_168710
I've seen it in the middle of things, too . 165290_168710
and now it is not dropping ? 169960_171280
now it is not dropping, but the real time factors are &=breath poor
well, &=breath sure . 174430_182060
'cause &=laugh now it is not dropping . 174430_182060
but , I'm writing on Paprika, too . 174430_182060
&=breath I'm writing two of them, but that is a dual+processor,
oh, well . 178380_179800
&=breath . 178380_179800
that is not that much slower, either . 181570_183360
yeah . 183930_184720
yeah, well . 185570_193510
&=breath yeah, so the lab never sort of never recovered from
so . 186890_187430
which ? 193620_195730
t@i uh@fp uh@fp this +//. 193620_195730
the State_Department visit . 196100_199920
&=noise you remember this ? 196100_199920
oh, God . 198200_202040
&=breath oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . 198200_202040
that that was here, this lab . 198200_202040
the one a few weeks ago . 199400_200620
yes . 201870_204000
we never recovered . 201870_204000
okay . 202470_203230
why ? 203910_204940
what ? 203910_204940
well, the desk moved and it never moved back . 204550_208500
no but we xxx +//. 205430_206520
the desk moved and it never moved back . 205780_208310
but we decided we liked it better over there . 206890_210030
<it was out> yeah . 206890_210030
it wa@i +//. 206890_210030
we did ? 208850_211710
did we make a conscious decision or were we just inert ? 208850_211710
yeah . 210470_211000
no, it was conscious 'cause <it was out of the way> it kept it
&=smack and that stuff never went . 214790_218970
that never recovered . 214790_218970
<kept it out of the> yeah . 215940_217210
that never recovered . 216430_217830
and nobody sits at that other desk, so . 218990_222940
I mean, we use it <for c@i> for the C_tar demo, but . 218990_222940
right, hm@fp yeah . 222770_225270
so, there is no need . 222770_225270
&=breath . 222770_225270
right . 222810_223420
and for Nespole, I guess . 223640_226820
but but, you know, nobody sits there, so . 223640_226820
still, I would like to redo@n this entire area . 227100_241000
&=breath uh@fp just because &=breath <I no longer like th@i>
&=breath that power supply needs to be in a different place . 227100_241000
&=breath . 227100_241000
yup . 241970_247560
well, go for it . 241970_247560
yeah . 241970_247560
well, and then people start stringing cables here that should've
I disagree with you . 247610_250110
audio cables +//. 247610_250110
video ? 249690_252240
<that is not a> that is a video cable . 249690_252240
where is the video ? 250680_251780
&=breath . 250680_251780
yeah, that one could've gone in the ceiling . 252520_254440
and, we have a network cable . 254510_261850
uhm@fp and uh@fp two other cabl@i miscellaneous . 254510_261850
<that one I think> <is that the one> that hes@fp
yeah . 266310_267120
&=laugh . 266310_267120
that one . 268170_270350
so, it comes out of the column . 268170_270350
&=laugh . 269090_270020
and goes all the way over there . 270180_271790
and goes all the way in the back . 270890_272460
and goes all the way over there . 271090_272670
what the hell is that ? 272760_276570
we &=laugh we have a connector over there . 272760_276570
hes@fp y@i hes@fp I don't know, maybe that is a DSL . 275940_281970
or, not a DSL . 275940_281970
maybe that is an ISDN thing . 275940_281970
&=breath . 275940_281970
<it might be one of the> yeah, I was gonna say it might be one
no, the I_C_Ns got moved . 282010_285940
or, they were suppose to . 282010_285940
oh . 284290_285270
the I don't have +//. 284290_285270
so, that is just an Ethernet ? 285510_286800
should be . 286830_287710
<it has got a> it has got a strange sticker on it . 287380_289800
oh, no . 289480_293810
maybe it is . 289480_293810
DSL never got moved . 289480_293810
it was suppose to get moved over there . 289480_293810
<yeah I would> I mean, unless we find a cable long enough,
&=breath I don't know that we do find a cable long enough . 294610_303850
I don't know . 294610_303850
yeah . 295410_295930
yeah . 297690_298790
yeah . 297690_298790
that was the one that started it all, though . 302970_311100
&=breath strung the DSL and uh@fp &=breath &=smack then other
&=breath yeah, this place is full of cables . 311000_312690
I know . 311300_311890
well . 313190_314040
&=breath . 313190_314040
well, <it is not> <it is really> <it is not nearly>
don't you remember ? 313310_326540
<we used to have> &=breath <we would trip> <we were
we would occasionally trip over the cables . 313310_326540
they're just everywhere . 313480_314850
really ? 316800_317420
not even close . 317750_318890
&=laugh . 321940_322800
and you know machines would fall down . 326430_329870
and +//. 326430_329870
yeah . 329480_330330
right . 329750_330490
well, that was only when Bridget was around . 329830_331610

yeah . 381620_382670
&=laugh . 381620_382670
she looked at it sitting on the ground . 382160_384060
and then she just kept on going ? 384030_385500
&=smack &=laugh . 384110_384770

&=laugh . 390300_391640
mhm . 394900_395630
&=smack and we were doing the uh@fp integration of their

it is a big lose . 412900_415230
&=laugh . 412900_415230
it is a big lose for me . 413740_423690
and I thought to myself, <are you > hes@fp wow . 413740_423690
why . 413740_423690
hes@fp you know, I didn't know where to start . 413740_423690

yeah . 424120_424850
&=breath . 424120_424850
&=breath I would've thought she was like undergraduate or something

&=breath . 438650_439580
but, yeah . 439750_446220
so, hes@fp this this lab is far from Bridget proof, but
&=smack it is better than what it was . 445440_446910
yes . 446740_447390
&=smack well, what else would you add to it to make it better ? 447440_449750
well, I would get rid of that stupid looking mirror . 450080_454510
&=breath and +//. 450080_454510
&=laugh . 453650_454980
&=laugh . 453910_454810
why is that there, anyway ? 453980_455420
it is to project +//. 455240_456860
yeah . 455570_458130
oh, be careful . 455570_458130

it is held up with string, yeah . 466150_467800
there is nothing uh@fp noth@i +//. 467170_468770
nothing else . 468260_469510
that is just +//. 468260_469510
it is not like fishing line ? 469150_470970
it is string ? 469150_470970
it is twine . 471010_475220
<it is str@i> it is fairly strong . 471010_475220

it is not gonna snap, I don't believe . 476190_481060
and besides, it is not just one length of it . 476190_481060
&=breath . 476190_481060
well, actually, it is on this side . 480170_482310
it is one . 480170_482310
on that side ? 481740_483720
it is one thing ? 481740_483720

&=laugh and it all it takes is that, you know, one . 482510_486950
&=laugh that one goes, it comes down . 482510_486950
well, if that one goes, I'm not sure it does come down . 486320_495560

yeah . 492990_493550
okay . 495480_496290

so, this is like way way too big . 517940_520320
&=smack oh . 519570_520260
it is way too big . 519980_521190
yeah, but it needs to be able to hang down at the proper angle . 522700_527410
so you need to +//. 522700_527410
