and there's another one . 0_1601
so there's convex . 1601_2691
it certainly must be important since it occurs more than once . 2691_8403
quadrilateral . 8403_9146
okay, we've got quadrilateral . 9146_12555
polygon . 12555_14888
okay . 14888_15713
polygon . 15713_16490
the actual heading says Polygon, doesn't it ? 16490_19483
so if, uh, you certainly need to look in the heading . 19483_23570
some others, words or phrases ? 23570_26738
exterior angle . 26738_27778
okay . 27778_28401
who, who had exterior angle, uh, picked out as something that they need to know about ? 28401_33378
okay . 33378_34401
so exterior angle, polygon, convex, quadrilateral . 34401_38905
they were the main ones I saw when I looked around . 38905_41511
were there any others ? 41511_42326
rays . 42326_42848
rays . 42848_44033
okay . 44033_44561
it says construct rays . 44561_48608
so that's something that we need to know about as well . 48608_51801
let's have a look at these words . 51801_59895
polygon . 59895_60655
can anyone help us with what a polygon might be ? 60655_63368
it's a five sided shape . 63368_64973
five sided shape . 64973_66343
who agrees with the five sided shape ? 66343_68965
hmm, not a lot . 68965_70223
any two d@l shape ? 70223_74143
any two d@l shape . 74143_75958
okay . 75958_76868
so +... 76868_77295
would that be a polygon ? 77295_80335
any two d@l shape which is enclosed ? 80335_86068
mm, oh, that's enclosed . 86068_90171
mm, a many sided shape ? 90171_94331
many sided shape . 94331_95900
straight . 95900_96618
oh, straight . 96618_97675
okay . 97675_98631
that's getting a bit closer, to it . 98631_99880
so +... 99880_100358
a shape that has a number of straight sides . 100358_105318
how many sides has that got ? 105318_108358
six . 108358_109525
six . 109525_109908
what's it called if it has six straight sides ? 109908_111990
hexagon . 111990_113118
the diagram up there has in the middle of it what sort of shape ? 113118_119478
pentagon, because it has five sides . 119478_123020
if it Polygon is just a name for any number of sides . 123020_127135
now exterior angles . 127135_130280
there is something that tells you what an exterior angle is . 130280_134991
who has found the spot that actually tells you on the page what an exterior angle is ? 134991_140831
Peter . 140831_142406
um, an exterior angle lies outside the polygon ? 142406_146368
okay . 146368_147493
exterior angles lie outside the polygon . 147493_150615
it says that in the second sentence underneath the heading . 150615_153550
what does the first sentence underneath the heading say ? 153550_156790
um, exterior angle xxx polygon xxx is formed when of the sides is extended . 156790_164158
right . 164158_164596
it's formed when one of the sides is extended . 164596_167350
so, suppose I took that side +... 167350_170156
what choice have I got about extending it ? 170156_172620
Emma ? 172620_173926
xxx . 173926_175921
okay . 175921_176183
you can go in two directions . 176183_176990
but suppose we choose to go down . 176990_178655
then +... 178655_180720
I've turned it into a ray now, haven't I ? 180720_183910
because it goes on in one direction . 183910_186408
the exterior angle is the bit that's formed in there . 186408_191471
and it does lie outside the original polygon, does it ? 191471_194716
yes . 194716_195213
yes, it certainly does . 195213_196543
how many of those could you get from this hexagon ? 196543_200845
six . 200845_203686
you can get six of them because there are six sides to extend . 203686_206335
and you can see from the diagram that you've got on your page that they've all been extended in the same direction . 206335_215708
someone asked about +... 215708_219390
this note down here +"/. 219390_224828
+" this construction creates only one set of exterior angles . 224828_230046
+" another set could be constructed if you went the opposite direction with your rays . 230046_235215
so I could have gone +... 235215_238941
all of them around in that direction . 238941_241905
but we just choose one direction . 241905_244538
okay, we'll be moving across to the computer soon . 244538_247161
and you'll be doing that construction . 247161_249881
it gives you some fairly specific things to do first . 249881_253176
just think about how this is going to be constructed and read what it says there . 253176_259408
how do you actually construct that diagram ? 259408_267141
xxx . 267141_274456
okay . 274456_274841
first thing is, you need to go to the segment tool bar and change it to a ray because you want to draw rays rather than segments . 274841_281876
and then ? 281876_282663
um, start from one point and then go xxx create a ray . 282663_292743
and then somewhere along that ray draw another one across . 292743_296263
okay . 296263_296711
just listen carefully to what he said there . 296711_299133
you create one ray +... 299133_302525
let me get rid of this and start again +... 302525_306366
it'll look like that, won't it ? 306366_311145
okay . 311145_313345
now the next thing he said was you go somewhere along that ray and do another one . 313345_318208
now think carefully about that . 318208_322288
you go to the point . 322288_324543
right . 324543_325541
you actually start at this point that's already there . 325541_328456
you don't pick a point somewhere else . 328456_329760
start at that point to make sure that the new one you draw is joined on to the old one rather than separate . 329760_337596
so, you actually start with that one . 337596_340593
when you read through this you'll see that it does all of that . 340593_343853
now what haven't we explained yet ? 343853_345796
convex . 345796_346550
convex . 346550_347280
anyone know what convex is ? 347280_348986
anyone know there's a word that's the opposite of convex . 348986_354348
oh . 354348_355475
doesn't convex mean, its like, um, when you have glasses there's uh, xxx convex lens is the one which is curved ? 355475_371820
curved . 371820_372773
yes . 372773_373413
curved which way ? 373413_374613
that's the key thing . 374613_375311
outside . 375311_376408
inside . 376408_377460
outside . 377460_378731
yeah, curved inside . 378731_380290
the the other word that means the opposite of that also starts with that . 380290_386283
concave . 386283_387460
concave . 387460_388310
yeah . 388310_388810
now convex polygon is the sort we just drew . 388810_394683
but for example, a concave polygon +... 394683_399356
looks like that . 399356_402123
and the easy way to remember it is, is that part of it is caved in . 402123_406911
okay ? 406911_407340
it's pointing inwards . 407340_408116
convex polygon, everything is point outwards . 408116_411746
so you have to make sure that your polygons stay like that . 411746_416151
the investigation is to find out something about these +... 416151_422923
exterior angles . 422923_424726
and you're starting off with five of them . 424726_427461
in the space up here just write down what you think might be something, a fact, that you might discover about those angles . 427461_441346
there are some sentences starting +"/. 441346_487258
+" I think that all of the exterior angles will . 487258_490385
some people are getting a bit more specific than that . 490385_495388
ah, some people are saying +"/. 495388_503491
+" they may . 503491_505610
hedging their bets a little bit . 505610_507563
take a guess anyway, because it doesn't matter if you're wrong . 507563_515523
but it will be interesting to test and see if you're correct . 515523_518945
okay, there's a few different ideas written down there . 518945_556460
and we'll actually have a look at everyone's later on, but for the moment it's just you thinking about your own one and seeing whether it proves to be correct or not . 556460_564213
what's that sort of thing called that you've just written down ? 564213_566653
conjecture . 566653_567946
