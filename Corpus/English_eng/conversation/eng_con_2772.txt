this is the Harry <A> Blackmun Supreme Court Oral History
it's being held on January <seventeen> , <nineteen
<mister> Justice , today's session is about the rest of
Washington , <D_C> to take your place on the Supreme Court
at the end of the last session , we had started talking about your
what I wanted to ask you about today were some of the other cases
we'd like to start by talking about those cases on which you sat
the first of those is a procedure case about jurisdiction .
it was called Durfee <v@l> Duke .
do you remember this case ?
I do indeed , yes .
what happened ?
as I recall , this was a question of jurisdiction of Nebraska on
for me it was a difficult case .
I think not only for me , but for the three of us who sat on it .
we were uncertain of our decision , and so it passed on up to the
and what did they do ?
+, I think they reversed us .
and how did you feel when you got reversed ?
I was glad to get the law clarified .
those reversals never bothered me , particularly by that time in my
the first time it happens , I think , one's a little bit bothered ,
at one time , I gave a little speech to new federal judges and
I was reversed more times than I was affirmed .
but then , of course , when a case is taken , the chances of
then there's always the situation where one is affirmed , but
do you remember writing many decisions on the Supreme Court
not many , no .
usually they were assigned to someone else .
did you ask for them to be assigned to somebody else ?
not particularly .
I think it was more or less that feeling that , well , it was a
when you would go back to the Eighth Circuit Judicial Conference
well , yes .
when I went back to those annual conferences , I always had a
there was no particular lesson to be gained .
everybody gets reversed , and , sure , I spoke to the judges and
there was one case that you called a happy reversal for you .
a case called Jones <v@l> Alfred <H> Mayer , in
do you remember that case ?
I do .
I think there was more than one case that was a happy reversal .
we had felt that Supreme Court cases on the books dictated a
in retrospect , maybe we shouldn't have felt so confined , Maybe we
for the most part , I think the Eighth , Circuit felt that it was
if I had to do it over again , maybe one or two situations I would
stirred things up a little bit .
now the Jones case was about private discrimination and housing .
do you remember anything more about that case ?
no , nothing that I can comment on right now .
another case which you also seemed to think was a happy reversal
it was a double jeopardy case .
that was another case in which you mention being constrained as
was Ashe against Swensen the poker case ?
right .
where a number of people were playing poker , and one was
a question of double jeopardy there .
, <one> don't think we minded too much getting reversed if we
we're all in this together , and we're striving for the truth ,
there's another case in which you were on the court , but didn't
it's Tinker <v@l> Des Moines , about the rights of school
do you remember how that case unfolded ?
I remember that one really very well .
it concerned , of course , the right of children to certain
as I recall , and I hope I'm right on this , it was heard en banc .
there were eight of us sitting en banc .
I'm telling tales out of school and all , I suppose .
but the initial vote was five to three , in which one of the judges
+" well , I'll change my vote .
+" we'll make it four to four , and those jokers down in Washington
that's precisely what he did .
so that we affirmed that case by an equally divided vote and didn't
was it five-three to reverse or to affirm ?
to affirm , as I remember .
I could be wrong on that .
it was a good case .
which side were you on ?
I was on the three .
so we bounced it up there , and I think it was an important ease .
that was one of the early cases about the Vietnam War .
did you have a lot of cases about the Vietnam War during your time
I don't know about a lot of them .
we certainly had our share , and the war stirred up legal
it was not an easy time in the federal courts , but we all survived
that was also the period of the demonstrations at college campuses
a number of your opinions suggested some concerns about the
do you remember those feelings ?
do you think that those points are ones that you would feel now ?
it was a difficult time , and it was brought back to my
the <twenty-fifth> year class reunioning , of course , was
they were there , sort of in , almost in an apologetic mood for
it was difficult in educational circles , but we survived again .
your daughters were in their twenties at that time .
did they have any , involvement with this mood of demonstration ?
no active involvement as I remember .
we talked about these things a little bit .
it seemed to be a time of rebellion against authority .
did your daughters rebel against you ?
oh , they always are in a state of rebellion , <Mrs>
they have enough votes to override a veto on my part all the time .
there's a sort of a fun case , in <nineteen sixty-nine>
can you tell us about that ?
I think this was an important civil case .
standard of New Jersey brought the suit to obtain permission to use
the opinion was assigned to me to write .
I've forgotten whether I was the one who made the assignment , but
out of it , I think , came the use by Standard of New Jersey of the
they were denied the use of Esso , which they wanted to use .
it was a great case .
there are a lot of issues involving civil rights that came before
one area was school desegregation .
kemp <v@l> Beasley in particular was a case about
do you remember much about these cases ?
not a great deal .
it was a long time ago .
there were also issues involving racial discrimination and jury
how did you feel about the civil rights issues as they were playing
they were troublesome .
of course , most of them centered in Arkansas where the issues were
I'm not so sure the Eighth Circuit at that time was as liberal as
but there was always the comfort of knowing that there was a
where did you fall in the spectrum of the judges on the Eighth
I suppose I was more to the left of center than the rest of them .
you were later described when you were nominated for the Supreme
do you think that was an accurate description ?
that's a pretty general description .
maybe it's fairly accurate , for the most part .
but that's pure speculation .
looking back on those Eighth Circuit years , you were quite frank
did you ever feel that your candor made your colleagues
I never had that feeling , and they didn't express concern about it
they took it in stride .
I never felt any spleen on their part .
later on , when you went on to be nominated for the Supreme Court ,
is this something that you were particularly attuned to ?
were there any cases that you recall from that period that stood
I suppose I have to give you an affirmative answer to that one ,
+, how about +/.
+, without elaboration .
+, how about tax cases ?
did you have a lot of tax cases ?
we had a lot of tax cases in the Eighth Circuit , and I suppose I
one was that I had had six years in practice doing nothing but tax
I didn't dread tax cases .
I thought they were interesting .
everybody else thought they were very dull and difficult and wanted
so I caught more than my share of tax cases and didn't mind them at
fairly early on in your tenure , you had an interesting case about
a three judge district court case called Honsey <v@l>
what do you remember about Governor Rolvaag , about that case ?
the governor was the son of a very prominent writer who had oh
governor Rolvaag himself was controversial as was evidenced by his
but he was , of course , a <D_F_L> 'er , as we called
whether he equated with his father in intellect and ability , I
we had the old Stassen versus the <D_F_L> group , and
I liked Governor Rolvaag .
you never were too sure of where he was going to be , but I always
did you have much personal contact with him ?
a little , yes , sure .
due to some domestic aspects of his life , I was brought into
what kind of domestic issues ?
well , maybe I'd better not go into those .
okay .
in <nineteen sixty-five> , the Minnesota Twins won the
do you remember much about that period , and what you were doing
well , I was always interested in baseball , and they indeed won
sandy Koufax , a few other guys .
did you go to a lot of the games ?
I went to all the games that were in Minneapolis and Minnesota at
I didn't go out to the <L_A> games .
but as I remember , the first six , the home team won , then came
did you get up to Minneapolis much during this period ?
whenever I could .
it was not too far .
eighty miles , roughly .
I would go up to see Judge Sanborn every now and then .
other things took us tip there , three-judge cases and the like .
but it was always a little strained because I usually came back
wasn't much good the next day .
did you see your mother very much during this period ?
yes .
I don't know whether one could characterize it as very much , but I
do you think she had a good sense of what your daily occupation was
I think she had a pretty good sense of what it was like .
she was far wiser than I was in many respects , and forecast some
she was just as right as she could be .
public events or personal events ?
personal events mainly .
it would have to do with my relationship with the chief justice and
what were her predictions in that regard ?
well , she said , +"/.
+" harry , you're going to disagree at times , and it may affect
+" you should be prepared for it .
well , I thought this was a lot of foolishness , but she was never
did she know the chief justice well personally ?
oh , very well , yes .
we grew up more or less together with a couple of other guys , and
during this period , Chief Justice Burger was nominated to the
how did you feel at the time ?
that he was nominated ?
yes .
I think those of us out there in the Midwest were rather
in some quarters , it was a surprise in a way , and yet , I think
this attracted some national attention , or at least it attracted
was he known as something of a civil libertarian in the <Saint>
there's at least some suggestion that he was more liberal as a
I think this probably is true .
he took pride in his activities with the Urban League and some
I think it is true that he was more liberally inclined as a
did it occur to you when he was put on the Supreme Court that that
there were those who thought it too much as it was .
the only Minnesotan theretofore before the two of us was Pierce
chief Justice Burger took the position when my nomination came
after all , he'd been in Virginia for almost two decades at the
this is just some other political winds that were blowing .
but there are some states that have never had a Supreme Court
Missouri , a big state had had only one .
who was that ?
Charles Whittaker .
were there some cases in the Eighth Circuit that you remember just
you've mentioned most of them that occur to me .
there were one or two funny ones .
I can't give you the names of them , but it was interesting work in
I liked it .
we had a good group of judges .
we were friendly and supportive of each other .
looking back on those Eighth Circuit years , when they came to a
I certainly had anticipated staying on there the rest of my service
if I remained in the judiciary there was no other place to go
I was content to be on the Eighth Circuit .
I was working up in seniority .
how high were you in seniority when you went to the Court ?
it seemed to me I was about third , +/.
did the chief judge of the Eighth Circuit have a lot of power over
+, only in the assignment power , and the selection of panels and
there was Harvey Johnsen and Charlie Matthes , and as long as he
how long do you think it took you to become comfortable on the
three to five years .
but , that isn't due to the Circuit .
that's due to me .
I found over my lifetime that any new job , any new assignment ,
looking back now , how do you think you've changed since those days
well , of course , one always would give an answer to that question
+" oh , I haven't changed at all .
but I suppose one does .
I think when one comes to Washington to this Court , as I may have
he has to grow in it .
if that falls within the definition of a change , then one changes
did you have a constitutional philosophy as a circuit court judge ?
that's hard for me to answer .
I don't know what a constitutional philosophy is , really .
my approach always was to call the shots as I saw them and not to
did you find your role as a lower court judge constraining , or was
a little bit of both .
I think the Eighth Circuit at that time felt itself and went out of
it was not a court that went out on its own and established new and
we felt constrained in that respect .
that was not an uncomfortable feeling .
sometimes it was , that's what the law is , if they want to change
maybe that was a wrong decision , but that was the attitude of the
do you think it's different now ?
do you think that courts of appeals are more likely to strike out
perhaps .
when you put it that way in the plural .
do you think .
that the Eighth Circuit has remained one of the more conservative
well , no .
I wouldn't want to admit that .
I don't think it's so to be characterized , not any more so than
what are the main lessons that you think you learned about judging
+, that usually , of course , the main one , I suppose , is that
one learns sometimes that counsel are very unhelpful .
one learns sometimes that counsel are very helpful .
there's plenty of work to be done .
of course , we had a happy Court at the time .
one reason was that we lived in the field and came to <Saint>
it wasn't as though we were all in Chicago the way the Seventh
we had a happy group , for the most part .
did you ever feel that there were some cases that you'd prefer not
later on at the Supreme Court you had the freedom of a cert denial
you didn't have that freedom at the court of appeals .
the cases were on the calendar , and we had to take them on .
some were uncomfortable , but all cases have to be decided .
somebody has to write the opinion .
it's not very easy to take a cop-out , in some respects , and avoid
that's the way the system works .
of course , down here , why , it's the end of the line .
on a court of appeals it isn't .
how did you work with your law clerks on the Eighth Circuit ?
how did you go about drafting opinions ?
it depended a good bit on the law clerk .
for the most part , we had just one .
the chief judge , I think , maybe had two .
I always liked to have bench memos prepared by the law clerk .
maybe too much so .
I overdid that factor as I look back on it .
not all cases require a bench memo .
they were pretty good law clerks .
would you draft the initial opinion , or would the law clerks draft
well , one shifts about .
I started off trying to write all of my own , and then when I had
how did you select your law clerks ?
did most of them come from Minnesota ?
when I was on the Eighth Circuit , most of them came from Minnesota
I had one disadvantage in that I was living in Rochester , and some
they wanted to stay in the Twin City area , but they came down and
<nineteen seventy> , you've often said , was the moment
I wanted to talk about this period in some detail .
the vacancy on the Supreme Court came about because of problems
what are your memories of that ?
I think I'm correct in this , that vacancy existed for over a year
of course , the president went through the experience of having two
he felt , I think , that he wanted a Southern appointment , and
what are your memories of Judge Clement Haynsworth ?
I never met Judge Haynsworth , but he was a fine judge , there's no
I think he was caught in a period of changing ethical approaches .
one of the nicest letters I received when I was nominated came from
I think the country lost a good public servant when his nomination
to his great credit , of course , he stayed on the federal bench
do you remember what he said to you in the letter ?
no .
I have the letter , fairly long , handwritten .
how about <G> Harrold Carswell ?
judge Carswell I never met either .
of course , he was a Nixon appointee of recent vintage , as I
it was a rough time for him .
senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska at one point during Judge
+" if he's mediocre , the mediocre people of America need a voice
do you remember this period ?
I do indeed .
of course , Senator Hruska took a beating for that comment
those are political overtones that were being battered back and
his state is in the Eighth Circuit .
how did the Eighth Circuit judges react to the whole Carswell
you mean the judges themselves ?
yes .
we didn't say a great deal .
I think we all watched it develop and unravel .
of course , Senator Hruska was a power in the Senate , not only in
he had great seniority and never hesitated to speak his mind .
going back to Justice Fortas , did you ever meet him ?
yes , indeed .
and what was your impression of him ?
he argued a few cases .
I well remember when I first went on the bench , he was in the well
we came in , I was over on the left .
his eyes were on me , and our eyes locked , so to speak , and he
I've often wondered what he thought at that time .
it was not easy .
did you ever have a private conversation with him ?
not very private .
later , after his death , <Mrs> Fortas on occasion had
she was very friendly .
they were nice little dinner parties .
did she ever talk about how he had reacted to that whole period ?
no .
how was he as an oral advocate ?
good .
he was fine .
he was excellent .
no question .
one of the better ones .
he could have been chief justice .
came close to it .
indeed , he was a favorite of President Johnson , +/.
how do you think he would have done ?
+, he would have been a passable chief justice , I'm sure .
he had the ability .
how does anyone do as chief justice ?
you really don't know until they serve for a while .
I think he would have served presentably well , despite the things
did the other justices on the Supreme Court ever talk about Justice
occasional remarks were made , largely of disappointment , that he
I think it was basically disappointing .
did they ever say anything about Haynsworth and Carswell ?
no .
I think the answer to that is in the negative .
we didn't discuss it .
when did you first have the inkling that you might be the third
I hope I'm recollecting correctly here .
it seemed to me that President Nixon made two statements along the
one was that he would not appoint a “crony” to the court .
I didn't know what he meant by that , but I think it was clear
then he made another statement , a little later , to the effect
it was at that point I began to be a little concerned because there
I've always felt that point is about age <sixty-one> for an
but , going down circuit by circuit at that time there weren't very
there was Ted Goodwin out on the Ninth Circuit , Paul Roney on the
so there weren't very many , and that's when I was concerned .
so there was no other Southern candidate who was considered at that
I suppose so unless one would say that Frank Johnson was a
frank was fine judge , as you know .
did people start to call you and say you're under consideration .
not that I recollect .
so when did you first start to think it might be a real possibility
about the time that I described when he made the second of those
I wasn't very happy about it .
did you talk to your family about what it might mean ?
yes .
I talked to Dottie , <Mrs> Blackmun , about it , yes .
what was her reaction ?
Dottie takes things as they come .
I would say she was neither anticipatory or enthusiastic about it .
she's pretty pragmatic and knows how those things come about .
who were the people who you think were urging your candidacy on the
that's hard for me to answer , Professor Koh , because at least a
who were some of them ?
Louis Johnson , the Secretary of Defense , and , of course , there
anyone who had any connection with Nixon let me know that he was
did Warren Burger ever tell you that he had done anything ?
no .
I think he was content to let the facts speak for themselves .
I think at the time he was pleased the nomination came along .
when did you first hear from the White House ?
I was called down there sometime in April of <nineteen seventy>
and I think it was Lawrence Walsh who called me down .
what was his position at the time ?
I think he was an assistant attorney general at that time .
he had been a federal district judge .
so I went down .
so you were not called until the Carswell nomination was defeated ?
that's correct .
but was it shortly thereafter ?
very .
almost immediately .
and this was a look-see kind of a thing , find out what kind of a
and who did you meet with in Washington ?
initially with the attorney general .
john Mitchell .
yes .
<mister> Mitchell .
he turned me over to Richard Kleindienst .
the deputy .
what was your impression of John Mitchell ?
it was not a bad impression .
I thought he was , at the time , was able , conducted himself well
what about Kleindienst ?
for me Kleindienst was a little less impressive , distinctly , well
seemed to be a little bit more concerned about his own stature than
how did you feel about these two people later on as they were going
a great disappointment , of course , but , hardball politics in
did you ever speak with them , personally , again after this ?
I don't recall that I did , no .
did Kleindienst deal with you himself , or did he turn you over to
he dealt with me himself for a good bit .
both the Mitchell and Kleindienst interrogations were sort of a
session trying to find out what kind of a guy I was and whether
did they seem to know much about you ?
I think they knew as much about me as I knew about myself , yes ,
were they focused on your opinions or more on your personal life ?
a little bit of both , I think , and rightly so .
what were some of the questions they were asking you ?
that's hard to remember .
we covered the waterfront , generally .
they asked some questions about opinions .
they weren't objectionable in their inquiries at all .
you never felt that they had run across some trouble spot or
the only troublesome spot which came up , and of which I was very
but times were changing .
one would not do that nowadays .
on the court of appeals , whenever we recused ourselves it was a
so that we hesitated to do this .
he always groused about it , whoever was chief judge at the time .
in particular in the Ford Motor case , Harvey Johnsen spoke to you
I raised it with him , yes , indeed .
I think he was either unaware of it or had forgotten about it or
Harvey Johnsen was the chief judge , and it seems to me he either
he said that he encouraged you to sit on the case .
he did indeed , and was thoroughly annoyed when I suggested recusal
he said , +"/.
+" don't you see it's upsetting my assignments ?
he didn't like to have them upset .
one thing that is very striking about the confirmation hearings is
they seemed very proud of the fact that you had been nominated .
judge Van Oosterhout wrote a very strong letter expressing the
do you remember the reactions among the Eighth Circuit judges as
I was surprised at the enthusiasm that they demonstrated .
they were all good friends , but on the other hand , I suppose any
why wasn't I nominated ?
or something like this .
but I saw nothing of that type of thing .
it was completely and enthusiastically supportive , I'm always
were any of their names mentioned during this period ?
as possible nominees ?
no , I don't think so .
after you spoke to Kleindienst , did you speak to .
anybody else in the Justice Department , or was that pretty much it
no , I think , as I recall , and , my+goodness , it was a long time
one of them was Johnnie Walters , and Johnnie is his name , Johnnie
he asked a lot of questions about tax law and the like .
later , he and <Mrs> Walters became good friends of Dottie
we haven't seen them for a long time now , but I have the utmost
he asked you about your tax returns ?
yes .
as a matter of fact , he came out to Minnesota at the time I
he went over all of them .
I still have his report on those tax returns .
he said that this nominee is I think I shouldn't say this
he was impressed by my nickel inclusion .
did you do your own tax returns ?
yes , always .
always have .
am I right that there was at least one point where there was a
I think that's probably right .
there was another point where there was a mathematical error a
the other interrogator of the two was none other than William <H>
that was the first time you had ever met him .
+, yes , I think so .
what was your impression of him ?
I was impressed .
he was able , articulate , and knew what he was asking about .
I don't remember the questions he asked me particularly , but the
it went on for some time .
did you know anything about Rehnquist , his background at the time
I suppose I have to answer that in the negative , really .
he was quite a young guy at that point .
yes , and , of course , he was assistant attorney general in the
young , and had clout , too .
and what kind of issues I assume he wasn't asking you about tax
no .
everything else .
Johnnie Walters did the tax work .
was he focused on any aspects of your jurisprudence .
I suppose yes .
I really have forgotten a good bit about it .
he didn't ask any offensive questions .
he asked questions I thought were reasonable questions to ask , and
did you hit it off personally ?
I thought we got along all right .
that's a long time ago .
now he's chief justice .
do you ever talk with him about that first meeting .
well , I kid him a lot about it at times , during conference when
+" you surely must regret having approved me back in <nineteen
he rose to the bait , said of course he regretted it .
but , we've had a lot of fun in that respect .
do you think he's changed in his personality or temperament ?
I don't think so , fundamentally .
like anyone else he becomes more like a chief justice every day ,
it's not easy being chief .
did he have a good sense of humor back then ?
I would say so .
he's a charming guy when you're with him alone , at a dinner table
have you socialized with him very much ?
no .
I wouldn't say so .
occasionally .
as you know , we have court dinners on occasion .
people often have asked , did you have close , intimate friends in
my answer to that always has been in the negative .
I think we see too much of each other to develop close friendships
the only exception to that would be , in my view , the friendship
last question before they change the tape .
after you met with Rehnquist and Walters , were you pretty
I had no knowledge of it .
I suppose I was up in the air , and I didn't feel one way or the
I think there were too many personal aspects to it to what it
after we take up again with the new tape , we'll talk about you
