did you guys finish writing it down ? 6865_8305
not yet . 8445_10385
yeah, I finished . 11525_12065
what'd you say for the +... 13045_14485
I said the answer was log seven +... 14585_16725
the simplified version of these ? 18325_19825
mm-hmm . 20085_20445
how'd you get that ? 21205_22125
log two plus log five . 23185_25265
oh, right . 25765_27845
we wrote that down yesterday . 27845_29025
mm-hmm . 29485_29765
this part, the exponents ? 35185_38365
yeah . 39765_42545
wait, when did the +... 46745_47805
multiplication +...
yes, wouldn't it be log ten ? 50525_52205
yeah, yeah, yeah . 52645_54985
because you don't add them to simplify, you multiply them . 55755_59775
because when you add logs, you multiply them, and when you subtract logs, you divide . 61435_66155
exactly . 66555_66835
okay, thank you . 66975_67875
it would be log two times five +... 70055_77255
I should write this down +... 77355_78655
would be log ten +... 79935_82715
oh, I just got a paper-cut . 82905_84245
they hurt, but you eventually forget about them after a few minutes . 84585_92045
yeah . 92345_92485
I see all the cameras . 93065_98945
smile .
in a few years they'll dig this out of the time capsule and be like +... 100725_107185
xxx .
you have two and a half minutes left . 122805_123945
please discuss this . 124185_124985
but if it was an exponent, you would add them . 127025_128985
but since these aren't exponents, you would just multiply them together ? 129485_132685
mm-hmm . 133325_133745
so if it were like, log two squared plus log five squared, it would be log ten to the fourth ? 133985_141825
I mean +...
say that again ? 143665_150645
let me write it out . 153185_154125
if it were log two squared plus log five squared, would it equal log ten to the fourth ? 154565_169285
or would it just remain ? 170625_171365
you would +...
yeah +... 172025_172405
technically yeah . 173725_174285
you times exponents as well . 174425_177145
no, you add them together . 178405_179945
that's what this says . 180645_181625
so a to the n-power times a to the nth power equals a to the n plus n-power . 183485_193565
so you would add the exponents, then multiply the whole numbers . 195025_198385
wouldn't that just be what he said ? 199725_202245
yes . 202745_204665
but since this one doesn't have exponents, it would just be log ten . 206265_210865
yeah . 211405_211765
okay . 212125_212565
so we've got another thirty seconds left . 218385_229905
please discuss . 230525_231225
anyone else want to add anything ? 231625_232705
we all got the same answer, right ? 234645_236045
yeah +... 236525_236845
yeah . 237285_237645
log ten, because when you add together log functions, it's like multiplying . 237905_241425
wait, I have a question . 242305_246185
if it were log two minus log six +... 246585_250445
log two to the sixth +... 250765_252005
okay, so one third . 253745_255865
okay .
just checking . 256505_257545
let me write this down .
same way, the opposite way . 263315_264575
if it's log times a log, it's add, addition . 264795_269715
the learning target is, know how the rules of logs are related to the rules of exponents . 299695_304435
simplify the following expression: log two plus log five . 305815_309315
what did you get for this ? 310515_311435
I got log ten, because adding together log functions is similar for multiplying +... 311775_318575
when you add to the log functions, you multiply them, you don't add them . 318975_324455
when it's log two plus log five, imagine it as two times five . 326635_331915
log two plus log five equals log of two times five, which equals log ten . 333815_342175
perfect . 342835_343215
anything else ? 344255_345095
I also got that log ten could simplify to one . 351125_354645
yeah ? 357525_361065
it simplified to one, because ten is squared to the power of one to get ten, right ? 361505_365465
does this make sense ? 366425_371825
any questions ? 373025_376085
S_three .
uh, never mind . 381485_383625
do you think there's a different method to solving that ? 384465_387625
I suppose +... 389125_394665
you know that log of a to the x equals y, right ? 400875_411875
that could +... 413315_415495
x equals +... 416595_418355
I have to check my notes on this one, actually . 424155_426475
yeah, a to the power of y . 429025_430105
and so we know that a for this one, if it's just nothing, that means it's ten . 430645_439625
and X would be this +... 441805_445345
xxx one, because ten to the one equals ten . 463785_468285
yeah, it solves everything . 468605_469825
cool . 470805_474305
thanks . 474505_474625
in the interest of making this as clear as possible, let's remember that this ten is there +... 483685_493185
hold that .
and this ten is there . 495305_504005
right ? 504425_504905
okay . 505605_506285
is there another way to do this ? 506645_510165
sure . 510405_511185
I'm sure you could graph these and graph that, if you really wanted to do that . 512885_519305
but of course, in order to graph those, you probably need a calculator, and it just sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it ? 519685_524725
so, let's not worry about that other way . 525025_528125
let's worry about being able to apply these rules . 528505_530425
what are we supposed to do next ? 531705_533565
