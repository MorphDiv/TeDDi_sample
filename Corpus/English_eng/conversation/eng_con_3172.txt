oh, we can begin again ?
ok .
so Justin, I saw, um, you measuring this .
and you had said you had figured out .
it was a little bit more than eight .
and you weren't quite sure how much .
so here's the one and here's the eight, .
you said it was a little bit more than eight .
uh hm .
so, how much would that be ?
oh, eight and eight and one fourth .
eight and one fourth .
well, suppose I start the ruler here, at the two .
now what would the measurement be ?
it would be nine and a fourth, it would still be nine and
well, this would have to be a one .
it would have to be a one ?
this would be an eight .
oh, so you think the right .
it would still be exactly the same .
so you think the right way to use this ruler, .
is to start at the one ?
yeah .
ok, I'm wondering .
oh, but it says that it's nine, nine and a quarter, .
if I start at the two inches .
I know but how much am I off by ?
I know but, you have to count that as a one .
ahh and that as an eight .
and that as an eight .
so I'm off by one whole inch ?
so you go like this, cuz you go, .
cuz you start at that number .
one two three four five six seven .
seven .
eight .
I thought you just, didn't you just, .
can you count that again for me ?
it goes starting at two .
two three four five six seven .
seven .
and then eight .
and then eight ?
didn't you just say and then nine, that would be ten, that would be
could you point at the end of each of these inches .
you're counting ?
could you start that count again ?
ok, what one is that ?
this is the end of two .
that's the end of two .
it's the beginning of three, and the end of two .
two inches ?
so from here to here you're saying is two inches ?
right .
can you show me ?
and from there to there is one inch .
that's one inch .
here to here is two inches .
here to there is two inches .
so okay, that's two inches .
and here to here is how many inches ?
it would be four inches .
four, okay, here to here is how many inches ?
seven inches .
seven .
well, I don't know .
one two three four five six .
six inches .
six and what is this one ?
that would be seven .
seven, okay .
eight ?
where's the eight ?
you just said you just said that would be seven .
that right there would be eight .
oh, now you say its eight .
I'm a little confused .
right here would be seven .
I see .
what would happen if I started the ruler at the 0 Justin ?
and now I did it that way .
what answer would I get then ?
cuz, I go, I start right here and I go like this, I go: one .
you start at, you call that 0 a one ?
right .
you just said that's 0 .
I know, but I'm thinking okay, one what one what ?
one inch, one inch .
so I'm, I was a little confused by your reasoning, .
I have to tell ya .
I'm not understanding it very well .
because, first you said that was a zero, and over here is a one .
but then you said no no, that's one .
because this would stand, represent from .
the beginning of one inch .
oh, that's the beginning of one inch .
right .
oh, and the end of one inch is right here ?
right, and it would be the beginning of two inches .
and that would, so it would all be, sort of .
if you start at the zero, it would all be moved over .
oh, okay, I see .
alright, thank you Justin .
thank you for helping me out with that
