ok, the first thing I need you to do is go ahead and read this .
ok .
factorial design, independent variable, values on independent
all in the time of forty five minutes we're gonna cover this .
ok .
have you read the chapter, chapter seven ?
uh huh .
ok .
now, you can go ahead and turn your head around for a moment and,
um, we're asking what you think your, um, level of understanding of
and just go ahead and select a number that you feel comfortable
this is not a test or anything, so, I mean, honestly, if you can .
probably around three, because there's a lot of questions .
ok .
so you think it's a little poor in some places ?
yeah .
ok .
well, hopefully, when forty five minutes is up, you'll not feel the
&=laughs .
um, how do you want to do this ?
do you want to go from front to back in the chapter or ask
what's your preference ?
um, maybe front to back and when we get to something .
ok +...
that I'm having, you know, real &=mumbles .
ok .
now what I do is I tend to ask a lot of questions .
uh huh .
and again, like all your other tutoring sessions, all this is is a
it's not a test, so try not to get real nervous or anything, and
um +...
the chapter we're dealing with is complex experimental design .
do you have page ninety three ?
uh huh .
ok .
great .
&=mumbles .
&=laughs .
um .
well the very first thing you should do is the idea of complex
uh huh .
what do you think is the difference between a simple experimental
ok, a simple has, um, one independent variable and one dependent
in a complex, it has, um, two independent variables .
uh huh .
and one dependent variable and it makes it more complicated
what, what is a variable ?
&=mumbles .
a variable is, um, like to give you an example, um, &=mumbles .
is, um, gender a variable ?
like male female ?
is that a variable ?
uh huh .
is, um, blond hair a variable ?
you mean a value ?
a variable, is blond hair a variable ?
no .
and again, this is just a &=mumbles, so you can get a firm idea in
&=laughs .
of I know what a variable is .
is blond hair a variable ?
it depends on how you use it .
right .
um .
what I did when I started thinking about, Ok, what is a variable,
uh huh .
so you could say globally, stress, you know, and then what do you
um, blond hair, when you said you mean level on a variable ?
that would be if I was saying blond versus brunette .
uh huh .
but then you can always argue that there are different colors of
uh huh .
so anything that's a category, if you're using anything and you're
movie is a variable .
you know, there are all kinds of different movies .
uh huh .
so, pretty much anything you can call a variable, anything that you
ok ?
and a value is an instance, a specific example of a variable .
like blond hair or brunette hair under the variable of hair color .
uh huh .
ok .
it's real important when you start saying, “Well, a simple design
uh huh .
what do you mean by that ?
you know, just to make sure, because, because you'll never see then
ok, um, when you talked about one, can you have a complex design
no &=mumbles because it was three levels, three levels .
right, right .
so anything that doesn't have one independent variable with two
and that's what we use when we use factorial designs .
ok ?
&=mumbles .
why would somebody do a study that wasn't simple ?
I mean, simple's kind of nice, you know ?
I, um, like if they were predicting that it had a curvilinear
uh huh .
and, um, if they were, um, gonna show &=mumbles um like in a
uh huh .
and you have different categories like &=mumbles .
certain environments cause more stress, &=mumbles less stress .
uh huh .
or if you wanted to look at say the worker being the assembly line
yeah .
or the CEO and that would be three different people that three
so you use the word complex and simple designs, because they only
and we all know a line is the distance between two points, so if
you would have to look at more .
um, just like, um, if you have a light with a rheostat of it, you
uh huh .
and you know, some light switches are just on and off, and if it's
uh huh .
if you have a rheostat, you can get a lot more accurate, and you
you can see the whole spectrum, Ok ?
there's a big difference between simple design, either on or off,
it's more accurate, Ok ?
um, what is a, you said something about curvilinear, curvilinear
uh huh .
what, give me an example of what you think would be the &=mumbles .
um like um could say, when somebody is real young, um,
uh huh .
like if they get older it increases, and if they get a lot older .
uh huh .
they'll go down, or &=mumbles .
so using that example, if you say you were gonna look at the
theoretically, the little child will probably hit the ball a lot
uh huh .
well then you could say if you only had a simple design where you
uh huh .
so that's really important to remember .
and in the real world where there are things either or, that's why
uh huh .
alright, we've covered independent variables and values .
um .
why would you, um, complicate matters by, uh, uh, adding more than
um, um +...
how about &=mumbles if you say he either hit the ball or he doesn't
it'll just give you a better understanding of it, un, &=mumbles .
right .
&=mumbles .
ok, um, on page ninety four they show, show an example of the
uh huh .
so if on an exam saw only the broken lien, and you didn't see
complex .
ok .
now it could be if you looked at one of these you could say,
but what happens, I mean it's possible also, that you do have a
uh huh .
you know, so you can't look at one of these and say, “Oh, that's a
uh huh .
ok, &=mumbles So if you look at a chart and you see a line and it's
but if you see a straight line, you don't know, Ok ?
ok .
great, um, let's go on to page ninety five where it talks about
um, on this wonderful board, which I will hold against the wall, I
and again, this is not a test xxx .
two by two .
ok .
what does that mean ?
there's two independent variables and they each have two levels .
ok .
how do you know that the first independent variable has two levels ?
by the number two .
which number two ?
0 .
ok .
how do you know the second one has two levels ?
by the second two .
so would it be fair to say that the number of places is the number
yeah .
ok, and the number that sits on that place is what ?
the number of levels .
ok .
say I've got a two by three up there .
uh huh .
what does that mean ?
there's two independent variables and the first one, the first one
ok .
and you have, you have that cold, right ?
you are Ok with that right ?
now, what .
if I say tell me about the cells that are supposed to be in your
first of all what is a cell ?
um .
0 .
um, the table .
how you set up the table .
uh huh .
the cell would be um .
you, you can draw it for me if you like .
think out loud .
draw it .
xxx .
this square you've just drawn is a table .
yeah .
it would be like each one of these like represents what that
ok .
so if you've got a two by two, what is your table gonna look like ?
what do you mean ?
how many groups or cells will you have for a two by two design ?
xxx you have a +/.
a box .
uh huh .
and each of those little boxes is a cell .
uh huh .
ok .
so, um, for our example right now, let's say we're looking at two
the first one, and why don't you go ahead and label it, is gender,
do it right here ?
yeah or or right above the number two would be great, Ok ?
0 .
ok .
and, Ok, the second thing that I'm gonna look at is, um, hair
and you can write hair .
and I'm interested in knowing if, gender and or hair color affect,
xxx question, Ok ?
how, um, do I go about labeling, um, that box ?
um, that table you've drawn ?
ok .
you say that it's affecting our, you know .
our independent variable is gonna be say scores on an exam,
that's gonna be our dependent variable .
xxx and you put your dependent right here
ok, now hold on a just a second .
this is <not> graph, Ok ?
uh huh, yeah .
this is gonna be a table .
uh huh, Ok .
this is a real important concept, but one that you will &=mumbles .
&=laughs .
ok .
you've got two independent variables .
where do you put them on that table ?
how do you label the table ?
put gender and hair .
no .
ok .
now, I'll show you how it goes, and then you'll know it for ever,
um, this is independent variable A, and this is independent
uh huh .
and it can go on to z@l if you have the rest of your life to spend
alright ?
ok .
uh huh .
independent variable A always goes here, Ok ?
so this is gonna be A and this is gonna be B, alright ?
and then you're gonna have gender, say this is male, Ok ?
uh huh .
and female .
hair color ?
this is gonna be the black haired person and this is gonna be the
uh huh .
so if you shut your eyes, now what's the question, shut your eyes
in the right column .
I mean of the side column .
ok, and where does the variable B go ?
on the top .
ok .
&=mumbles and the number of cells for a two variable two levels
uh huh .
now, if you didn't have a pencil and paper and weren't allowed to
independent variable A has four levels, independent variable B has
how many cells am I gonna have ?
eight .
and how did you get that number ?
multiplied two times four .
ok .
so that's real easy, right ?
you just multiply the number of cells .
and of you've got a list of them, a string of them, you just keep
uh huh .
ok .
great, right, um, also, if you, if you would see on a multiple
cells are also the same thing as groups or experimental conditions .
so those little boxes could be called cells, they could be called
when you say “boxes” what do you mean ?
these little boxes in here
ok .
ok ?
that's not the same as &=mumbles ?
that's a cell .
you see in this cell, you're gonna have a male with black hair, and
ok .
and in this cell you're gonna have what ?
a female with black hair and a female with blond hair .
0 .
ok .
are you sure on that ?
that wasn't anything you xxx .
well, just setting it up .
but kind of, I wish I knew exactly where to put it .
the way I was getting confused .
like the way I described .
uh huh .
&=mumbles .
alright, um, Ok, now we get to our interpretation of these
uh huh .
there's two big questions that you look at when you're talking
can you think of what they are ?
the main effect and the &=mumbles .
ok .
what is the main effect ?
that was something I had a question about .
um, I know it's like what effect does independent variable have,
uh huh, uh huh, uh huh .
but I just know it just like &=mumbles .
by measuring .
yeah, I don't really understand the concept, you know .
&=sighs .
when you're looking at the main effect, what you're really asking
ok ?
uh huh .
which you only have one independent variable on, Ok ?
so, for example, um, if you've got, in this design here, a simple
uh huh .
you're gonna have two main effects .
you have a main effect for A and a main effect for B
so really what you're asking is, ok, A is gender ?
you're saying, “does gender matter in my exam” ?
that's all a main effect is .
does gender matter ?
ok .
and for B, the main effect of B is does hair color matter ?
regardless of this .
so if you're looking at the main effect of A, what you're, you're,
uh huh .
so you know how, how you, how these two numbers say a four and a
you're just gonna average those, and then you'll come out with a
ok ?
it's exactly the same, see this is an average and
uh huh .
and then what you'll come out with is the same exact number as if
ok ?
ok .
so say you had five people with blond hair and five people with
what you're looking at is you're saying “ok, I'm looking at these
and then, for the female, say you had five people here and five
ok .
so what you're doing is pretending that division is not there at
0 .
so you're looking at all these people here .
so that's why you put the numbers here on the side .
ok .
so when you come out with a main effect, of a, say gender, say this
you get a number here on the side .
ok .
that's your average for female and your average for male .
I was getting confused because when it said the overall, I thought
what it, you always see, it's weird the way they write it, they
uh huh .
and then they write the main effect underneath it .
yeah .
usually in parentheses .
what that's saying is overall males get a two .
overall, females get a two .
ok .
so it would be just like you had an experimental design, a simple
you get two averages, right ?
uh huh .
and so you're saying, “ok, overall, for males, overall for gender,
is what you're asking, ok ?
and then you erase this out of your mind
and you say, ok, overall, say you came out with a four and a nine
ok .
say those are averages .
overall, does hair color, is hair color different ?
0 .
where, see you're looking at the difference between these two
ok .
do you understand what a main effect is now ?
yeah .
so you wouldn't ever separate the black and the blond ?
you wouldn't ever say the main effect of the black hair ?
yeah, “yeah” .
for, for a, see this is, this is, um, for A, and this is for
ok .
ok ?
uh huh .
do you feel real good about that ?
I feel better .
cause that's real important .
so an overall main effect, say I've got a study where I'm looking
ok ?
and I said “what is, how many main effects do I have” ?
you have two .
um .
if I'm looking at, uh, the main effect of stress, do I care if it's
well, if you take summer, take the main effects of summer, you
&=mumbles .
yeah .
what you're kind of doing is erasing that barrier .
you look straight down for B, and you look straight across for A .
ok ?
uh huh .
now .
why do I give a hoot about interactions, and what are interactions ?
alright, interactions are when, um, the independent variable
let's use the example of the teacher being male or female or being
uh huh .
um .
why don't you go ahead and do a box xxx and erases board ok ?
and we're gonna do just a couple of these and then we're gonna move
go ahead and, you've got two levels there, ok ?
variable A is gonna be gender .
and you can put M and F if you want, that's fine .
ok, And say we're gonna have hair color, black or or blond, black
just put Y for yellow .
sorry .
now, uh, let's go ahead and say that my mean, ok, when I found exam
if they were male and they were blond, they got a five .
if they were female and they were black headed, they got a five .
male or female blondes, they got a five .
now, what is the main effect of gender ?
is there a main effect ?
of gender ?
uh huh how would, how will I be able to answer that question ?
the main effect of male is gonna be five and the same for female .
ok .
what about blond hair ?
it would be five .
and black hair, not the blond, I mean it doesn't matter .
yeah it would be five .
ok .
now, I wanna ask three questions about this simple factorial
I'm asking if there is a main effect of A meaning gender ?
if there's a main effect of B being hair color ?
and if there's an A times B interaction, ok ?
uh huh .
how do I answer the first question ?
is there a main effect for A ?
would you, you look at the difference between this ?
why would you look down there for A ?
well, you look at this .
ok, right, now, did males and females get the same score .
uh huh .
so the answer to A is no, right ?
uh huh .
there's no main effect there .
ok ?
what about B, hair color .
does it matter what color the teacher's hair is ?
no .
now, uh, why don't you erase the numbers real quickly, or you can
&=mumbles .
ok .
say, um, let me go ahead and put numbers in the box .
put a one and a one on the top level and a nine and a one .
what does that tell me ?
xxx .
well, first of all, for females, if you've got black hair, what did
a@l five .
and if they had blond hair what did they score ?
a@l one .
ok .
now, the book points out that a good idea when you're looking at
that way you can go ahead and see it .
ok ?
(be)cause it's kind of confusing to look at the little boxes and
but what we need to do first before we graph anything is get our
uh huh .
um, what is the overall mean for the male ?
um, it would be .
how would I ?
it would be one .
ok, What about females ?
it would be five .
how did you come up with that number five ?
um, add the nine and the one and divide by two .
ok .
what about, um, for black headed people ?
what's the mean for them ?
five .
ok .
what's the mean for blond headed people ?
one .
now, if I'm gonna graph this to look at interaction, do you know
&=mumbles .
would you take each one ?
ok .
let's go through this step by step .
you've got three things you're looking at here .
right ?
uh huh .
you've got one independent variable, you've got a second
uh huh .
you've got gender and you've got hair color, right ?
then you also have scores which is your dependent measure .
alright ?
so you've got three pieces of information that you need to put on a
uh huh .
so when you start off on a graph, you start off drawing a
uh huh .
ok .
so why don't you just go ahead and do the axis just to start with,
now, ok, um .
remember how we said we had three pieces of information ?
uh huh .
but you have only two lines on the axis, right ?
it's real important to remember what goes where, 'cause if you mix
do you know which goes where ?
xxx .
yeah .
xxx .
ok .
you've got three pieces of information .
you have independent variable A, right ?
uh huh .
you've got independent variable B@l .
and you've got your dependent measure .
ok .
which is really scores ok ?
uh huh .
so what you need to do first is say, ok, what kind of scores am I
I've got a five and a one, a five and a one .
ok ?
0 so really you only
where does this dependent measure go on your graph ?
the axis here ?
0 .
right, it goes on the vertical axis, ok ?
so dependent measures on the vertical .
ok ?
then what would you do ?
0 .
the scores ?
yeah, or how do you know them, but that's fine .
the one and the five .
uh huh, right .
ok .
now why don't we deal with independent variable A first &=mumbles .
ok ?
where does he go ?
it was um xxx .
male and female .
would you put xxx ?
yeah .
xxx and then a line going down ?
no, ok .
um, think that, think of the &=mumbles for a moment .
you've got three different pieces of information, and you've got
you've got a vertical axis .
you've got a horizontal axis, and then you've space, ok ?
the dependent measure goes here, ok ?
0 the independent variable here .
uh huh .
this guy goes inside, ok ?
0 .
ok .
so for the dependent measure in this instance, all the, the only
uh huh .
so you put five and a one .
there you are .
here you've got male and female
uh huh .
that's what you have to deal with here .
so you put male and female .
ok .
so what you're putting here is levels or values .
right ?
uh huh .
cause it's a chart .
you've gotta kind of put notches in it, Like you have notches in
you put notches in it, ok ?
yeah .
then, these people which are
ok ?
now, um, if I'm a male teacher, what main effect do I have, er, uh .
if I'm a male teacher and I've got blond hair, let's say black hair
if I'm a male teacher and I've got black hair, where do I put my
or what, what do I do ?
xxx .
ok .
if I'm just gonna show you right here .
&=mumbles, ok .
what you're gonna do is .
remember how we say we've got one more thing to graph ?
uh huh .
this is gonna be one line and this is gonna be another line .
ok ?
0
uh huh .
so it's real important to xxx .
this is a line, and that's, is a line, ok ?
0 .
so the blond people are gonna be line one, and the or the black
the blond headed people are gonna be one line .
ok .
xxx .
well, yeah .
or else you just know them or whatever, ok ?
so if I got .
if I'm a male and I've got black hair, I'd put a dot where ?
xxx .
ok .
let's go ahead and do the other black headed person .
what do I do ?
it would be a nine .
ok .
now let me ask you a question .
see that nine ?
uh huh .
um .
why did you put it over the male ?
oh, ok .
yeah, right .
now .
what do I do ?
ok .
and I've kind of misrepresented something long ago .
I wasn't paying attention .
remember when I said we were gonna do a five and a one ?
what you need to do are the scores inside the cell .
you need to make sure those are all represented .
ok, now, what do I do ?
um, you say a male with blond hair &=mumbles .
female .
ok, what is that line you just drew ?
it's the um, female .
it's the black headed people .
0 .
yeah .
ok .
it's the black headed people .
ok .
so why don't you put a B next to the line, for the black headed
now we need another line for who ?
for the blondes .
ok .
what do I do now ?
um, xxx .
why did you out it above the “F” ?
I don't know .
0 .
it would be on top .
uh huh .
and then, um, you'd have a female with blond hair .
xxx .
uh huh .
uh huh .
now, in s, sentence what you see here .
if you didn't see this at all .
ok ?
we could say, “my+goodness, if the person has blond hair, it
the students still score a one if the teacher's a male or a female
doesn't matter ok ?
uh huh .
but if the teacher has black hair, and they're a male, they get a
they get a one .
if the teacher has black hair, and she's a female, people score a
uh huh .
so you can't say .
what you're saying here is, it depends, as far as hair color, it
if you only looks at blond headed people, you wouldn't know .
but if you looked at black headed people, you'd say definitely if
uh huh .
so what does that mean ?
it means &=mumbles the level, the level of the independent
right .
xxx .
are you one hundred percent happy with that ?
yeah .
ok, um, turning away from it, um, if you've got two independent
xxx .
if you were gonna draw a graph, how many pieces of information are
xxx .
right and you've got to find a place for all of them, right ?
ok .
uh huh .
um .
are you real clear on the fact that when you're drawing your graph,
going this way, graphing xxx .
yeah .
so that's real important, ok, um .
uh huh .
when you're, say you were not able to draw a graph, ok ?
and when you're looking to see of there's an interaction, and
uh huh .
and for example, on page ninty eight, um, on the first one, for
for level number two, they got a five in both instances .
so those those are two horizontal lines, ok ?
so that you would know that there would be no, no interaction .
but here, for example, see of this one is going from a one to a
uh huh .
right ?
you can picture in your mind, “oh, one to nine” .
that's going up .
one to one is going straight across .
uh huh .
ok ?
so down here they've got a one to a nine .
what direction would that line be going in ?
if you're going from the first floor in a building to the ninth
going down .
ok .
if you were going from the ninth floor to the first floor, which
going up .
from the ninth floor to the first floor in a building ?
oh, no, down .
ok .
so you're saying, if I'm over here, I'm under variable b@l one I'm
if I'm under variable b@l two, I'm going down, ok ?
so it's kind of like if there's say if there's an earthquake,
if there's a flood, you'd want to go upstairs .
it depends .
but if you're saying, in a disaster, should I go up or should I go
say it depends, right ?
ok .
uh huh .
um .
in this example you've got, say you're going from the fifth floor
which direction are you going ?
you're going down ?
you're going from floor five to floor nine .
you're going up .
ok .
if you're going from floor five to floor one, which direction would
down .
ok .
see that's a real good way to see it, you know, visualize someone
ok .
uh huh .
let's look at this example, um .
see, it's kind of easy here .
you can say, “Oh, there's nothing, because they're all the same
but when you get numbers mixed up, it's important to realize what
ok ?
that's a question of direction .
uh huh .
so, if for example, in this one, he's going from the fifth floor to
this person is going from the first floor to to the fifth floor .
and they're both going up at the same rate .
uh huh .
xxx ok, so always look down .
and the way I visualize it is people going up and down stairs .
if they're going from one to one, they're not changing, they're
uh huh .
but if they're going from five to nine, which direction ?
they're going down, I mean, five to nine, are going up, ok .
if they're going from four to nine, which direction ?
they're going up .
if they're going from nine to sixteen ?
up .
sixteen to eleven ?
they're going down .
sixteen to sixteen ?
it would be straight across .
ok .
so that's an easy way to remember it, right ?
uh huh .
ok You feel comfortable with that ?
uh huh .
ok .
so independent variable A is on the bottom, the horizontal axis .
dependent variable is on that vertical axis .
uh huh .
and you know what you need, what kind of notches you need to put on
uh huh .
ok ?
uh huh .
great .
let me see what else we have .
um .
main effects, interaction, cells .
um if, if all you see, you don't see numbers at all .
ok ?
uh huh .
and you've got a graph and, you see this .
is there an interaction or not ?
xxx .
I remember looking .
this is A and this is B .
is there an a@l time b@l interaction, with that parallel line ?
no ?
right .
say you've got these two things .
A and B .
is there an A@l times B@l interaction ?
no .
ok .
the easy way to remember it, if you can't remember .
see, see this thing with the multiplication ?
it crosses, doesn't it ?
uh huh, uh huh .
ok .
so if these things are crossing and you look up here and they're
is there interaction there ?
uh huh .
yeah .
um .
yeah .
um .
no .
yes .
ok .
so you know how to identify it usually ?
uh huh .
and numerically .
uh huh .
right .
numerically you think of stores in a department store .
and you say, “How many levels in a department store” ?
“do I have to go upstairs or do I have to go downstairs” ?
ok ?
um one last thing and then we'll quit .
um Let's go on to a little bit more complicated design, ok .
and that's just the last thing .
um, on page one hundred and three, no actually it's not page one
it's on page, uh, one hundred and four, ok ?
I've got a two by two by two factorial design .
ok ?
uh huh .
you know how, do you understand that, the way they did it and the
um, I think so .
you just put, um, one there, one here, one there, one here, and
um, what you do, ok .
let's say you've got a two by two by two, ok ?
this is A@l and this is B@l and this is c@l .
ok, you go ahead and do a grid, ok ?
and for B you can go ahead and do a cross down the middle, ok ?
first of all, how many groups am I gonna have here ?
how many are there ?
&=mumbles .
ok .
now, obviously this is not right .
uh huh .
ok .
what you do, um, is you've got B@l and you've got level one and
uh huh .
but what you do is you do A here one and two .
and a B@l A@l and a two .
then you go like this .
ok .
uh huh .
and this is gonna be C one is gonna be this whole box, the whole
and this is gonna be C two down here, ok ?
so see here you've got B one, B two A one is in these two boxes,
this is an A one and then A two is here, and then C two is all of
so of I want to know xxx If I want to know the main effects of B, I
there's a B one here, a B one here, B one here .
this is B one .
so this is B one down here .
&=mumbles .
right .
and then for B two, it's over here .
all I do is average all these numbers, ok ?
so for main effects of B, all I do is add these up in the bottom .
I'll get an average, ok ?
for A one There's an A one here and an A one here .
uh huh .
so I've got these two numbers, A one is here and A one is here .
so I have to get those and average them .
uh huh .
to give me the main effect of A one, A two here and A two here .
so to get those two main effects and then average them, ok ?
with C one, I have to add all these up, and for C two I add all
ok .
alright, that's it .
ok .
um, if you turn around and look at the wonderful chart behind you
I'd say between a five and a six, probably .
so, we'll say a six moderately good .
ok ?
yeah .
I feel about it, it's confusing .
when I looked at this, I thought, down here, graphs and all this .
it's kind of hard to figure out, on your own, exactly the graphs .
so it's really a help, a lot .
if you're looking at graphs long enough, remember, all you're
is there an A times B ?
do they cross ?
if you're looking at it in table form, you go, all you look at is
go down, or, in one column, down in the second column .
you'd say, “am I going upstairs or downstairs” ?
xxx .
ok ?
uh huh .
great .
thank you very much .
uh huh .
I appreciate your turning up
