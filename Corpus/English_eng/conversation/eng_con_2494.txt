<good good> good . 7280_9270
no I didn't . 9570_9990
and I got nothing on Watergate too . 10040_11440
Mr President well basically we have to face the fact that it's a
mhm and a media story . 19310_20710
but it hasn't reached the country . 20790_21880
but eventually of_course if they keep pounding it will . 22350_24750
but somebody told me the night that Jack Barr had some kind of a
he said . 28890_29120
you know I I can understand if there's rape or murder right
this is just eave dropping or some damn thing . 31770_33640
that's right . 33690_34040
and and really we you've gotta keep the damn thing in
but it's terribly difficult for people here . 38070_39990
everybody's in battle you know and thinking this is the only story
you get out_of town . 43710_44260
you find it isn't the only story . 44980_46230
no . 46710_46770
and yet <it is> it is a terrible story for those that are in
isn't that the problem . 51020_51710
yes sir . 51990_52270
that's right . 52640_53030
that is the problem . 53050_53640
you know . 53830_54040
let's face it . 54090_54590
it's tough for Mitchell it's tough for Magruder it's tough you know
oh it's hell . 58000_58470
it's hell question being rest because those guys you know they know
that's right . 65570_65910
right if it weren't for that it would be &-uh be a hell of a lot
but &-uh sure . 71050_71890
and well and I think it's a terrible diversion from other things .
that's what bothers me . 75930_76760
oh that's the point you know that here we get we've we've done
we've got greater things to do in here . 81300_82790
they're talking about this goddamn Watergate no that's that's
well <I had a> I had a it it is . 87620_89230
and I had a press conference last night . 89250_90590
before this dinner . 90630_91360
and I I talked about all the great accomplishments of this
now when you were up here five years ago at this dinner you the
the spirit of the country was was I there five years ago . 100630_103190
yes sir five years ago you did the &-uh huh . 103470_106190
where was it . 107610_107930
where'd they hold it at the Staler and &-uh you oh <yes yes>
told the place . 111690_112150
and that's when you said . 112190_113030
I'd rather be stoned at the Middlesex Club than stoned in Caracas
I huh I was with you . 118250_120390
and &-uh Charlie Morin my law partner now was &-uh yeah the bastard
so you told him that and what happened . 124510_126110
well I I went through all this last night and and all the
the depression and the national spirit . 129590_131110
the way you've lifted that . 131520_132430
the ending of the war . 132550_134110
the ending of the arm . 134350_135070
I mean the slowing of the arms race . 135210_136560
the recognition of China a different world we live in today . 136710_140040
and that's the thing that's the way to talk . 140570_142510
I went through all of this in the press conference . 142770_144470
I did it in the speech . 144570_145040
but I get one I did it in the press conference . 145090_146510
and and then it answered some questions on Watergate and
Watergate that's what makes you so mad . 151650_154390
you'd like to be able to get out . 154410_156390
and I know hammer away at &-uh what a I wonder if you would sit
I told &-uh Bob Holman Ehrlichman this today that I thought it'd be
then just write your as_to what the hell how you . 167130_171280
see this thing unfolding and how we should handle it . 171410_173990
you know it's a I'm sure you've thought about it because you see
that's that's not good but no what you really gotta come down
now what in the hell do we do . 184280_186030
here you see because &-uh I &-uh I I think I think that the
that's what the press wants . 197360_198390
it's what the it's what Urban wants . 198540_200700
and the partisan Democrats that's right . 200780_202510
god . 202940_203070
it's a terrible mistake . 203190_204540
it is what do you think at the moment . 205660_206660
no that's precisely what I think my view is that it's a my view is
everybody follow it . 215690_216610
and whatever it's whatever the decision is has to be made . 217510_221010
I feel a decision has to be made . 221290_222510
I think that that &-uh <where this> where this Watergate is
Mr President is not with the man in the streets . 226830_228670
doesn't give a damn . 228980_229590
and he really frankly doesn't see much wrong with &-uh well it's
it's with the elite . 234180_234750
but it but the the worst place it is is with the party
that's what I mean by the elite by I mean the finance contributors
precisely . 242970_243310
that's right . 243510_243870
that's right . 243890_244330
that's right . 244510_244990
I sometimes think it doesn't matter anyway (be)cause they're never
anyway well that's right except that exit . 248380_250790
that's why the arms strongs and and the gold waters pop off . 251350_254920
well it's they're not strong for us . 255280_256800
but but <it's a> it's a hell of a . 257010_258670
depressant when they're not with us I mean it's a I agree with you
I know perfectly honest . 263500_264390
but but <I know> I know but you gotta have (th)em I know .
yeah they're bad to have against that's the very thing that
but Bridges plus the party elite knocked his ass off . 273990_277240
well I go back I have to go back I'm afraid &-uh Mr president <to
and I don't I've never known . 288990_290470
&-uh mhm he ought_to come forward at this point . 290830_295190
he needs to because that's right . 295210_296910
what's gonna happen is that eventually <he's gonna be> he's
and &-uh that's right . 302270_303120
but in the process it's going to it's gonna turn things to you . 303390_307360
and it's going to &-uh frankly there'll be other things falling out
now my god . 316550_317190
they'll put (th)em up before a firing squad . 317210_318760
that's right . 318810_319270
the thing you wanna do is it seems to me . 319640_322150
yeah <all of the> all of the perfectly legitimate but hard
well god dammit they're not but you see they'll that'll be the case
that's the point that the case . 334490_335550
but the point is somebody's gotta step up but who the hell's gonna
well that was the case that that was the point that Dave
yeah brilliant trial lawyer . 343210_344410
and he . 344510_344730
said . 344810_344880
look there's a time in every case when you &-uh simply have gotta
he said . 349790_350160
you otherwise you're gonna get in the end . 350230_354110
the real problem will be the fallout from a_lot_of of other things
yeah . 359140_359260
and &-uh true I'm afraid that's that's where I would have to
well the finger at the present time unfortunately goes to the
doesn't it . 370120_370470
yes sir very much . 370520_371670
so you think that's accurate . 372260_373580
there's just a hell of a_lot_of circumstantial evidence that's
and &-uh they're all jumping ship over there . 378380_381660
you know the lower levels are all talking to different reporters .
and it's are they yes sir . 384120_385570
and it's what are they saying . 386580_387350
oh they're pointing fingers . 388020_389100
everybody's accepted you know whoever's talking to the particular
but otherwise he's playing at everybody else . 394340_395940
&-uh I've developed since I left the White House some kind of new
I know everybody who walks in and out_of Jack Anderson's office
good . 411520_411700
that's good . 411900_412540
this is from co-opting a few people like &-uh Shapiro and &-uh mhm
they're now on our team . 420230_420980
we find out a lot that we didn't know before right . 422250_424190
well but &-uh <my only> my only I'm going John called me a
I've got you three of (th)em &-uh that I'm gonna come over and see
they so we want to get his and yours right apart from me because I
the business of the country . 443920_444550
you know I just can't get I I'm trying to keep people from keeping
no that's right part of the problem . 452290_453420
no that's exactly right . 453840_454700
I I so they all come trotting in and say . 454800_456820
look what do we do . 456840_457580
and I said . 457620_458070
well goddam it find out . 458120_459370
mhm . 459780_459900
that's right . 460650_460860
don't you agree . 461060_461470
yes sir I think you should . 461780_462860
and I I'm the one fellow that can attest to that . 464100_466840
I remember talking to you the week after <you were> you were
I mean this this is something that should not well I should not
anyway well isn't the question whether I was horrified or not . 474440_477260
I didn't know about it . 477360_477940
but no . 477960_478230
&-uh I mean surprised it mean it was un unbelievable that &-uh and
but all of us felt that way . 484800_486700
it was all it was of . 487100_488280
I I think you should keep outta this . 489450_490820
I the biggest negative to the Watergate in my mind . 491200_494060
eventually it's gonna come out . 494730_496540
there's just too damn many people involved . 496670_498540
oh sure the whole goddamn story's gonna come out . 499300_501180
the whole story's gonna come out . 501260_502300
and therefore I come to the conclusion that let it out fast . 502870_505620
get it out and get it over with and cut off these hearings and stop
and let's start reminding the American people of the extraordinary
sure that you performed in this country . 515789_518270
you know I had so many people come up to me last night after the
you know thank God that's it's great to put it all back in
all that our they tend to get all tied up with this crap exactly .
and our fellows should be out and our people should be out to being
I I think it's because after all sure we got some inflation . 535200_538910
but there's a this the goddamn boom is unbelievable . 539140_542380
you know it's move this country's moving right now . 542760_544940
oh I had a meeting with all the bankers in Boston today this was
and I never heard anything like it . 548920_550340
they're they're of_course the with inflation . 551360_553580
but well of_course but they they prefer a boom with inflation
yeah they don't see any recession ahead at all next year or the
they just think we're in one of the great uplifting cycles . 563800_566220
they think you can increase productivity like &-uh has never
you &-uh international Monetary actions were very healthy
&-uh mhm a period of sustained expansion . 576570_579300
I think the country's in in great shape . 579680_582060
and &-uh that's what kills me about sitting around ringing our
that's right . 587520_587880
everybody is sort of in a bomb shelter at the present time . 588080_590740
and then you know sort of but <I I> I you know what I mean I
oh good god . 595840_596540
what are we gonna do . 596560_597260
well &-uh we mustn't do that . 597350_600580
we just <it's like> it's like I tt look we could three months
didn't mean that god damn thing . 605000_606220
no Watergate is worse because it involves some of our closest
that's right . 610390_610700
but what the hell we do about (th)em I don't know . 611330_612910
well I I think of_course I t t involved Mitchell Flanagan
who else . 619980_620300
oh Mitchell . 621280_621780
East Kleine &-uh a_lot_of other people . 622270_626270
and they and that was a hell of a sensation front page every day .
it it just it just doesn't affect the how the average guy is
and that's &-uh that's what's important . 637580_639970
I mean that's what they . 640230_640970
no I think there's a tendency for everybody to get obsessed with
you know what I mean . 654000_654540
gam it . 654930_655380
oh they say this is this this is gonna destroy the president to
no it isn't going into the prison . 659540_660490
but if they are right the country's in a hell of a shape . 661250_663780
that's right . 663830_664220
but but they're not rightful . 664690_665820
when you stop to think of the fact <that that that that> that
I didn't nobody even remembers Adams today . 672750_675090
no but this which involves political crapping around . 675500_679020
I don't know you know the damnable part about this is it has a
nobody can but they remember that name . 692030_694050
that's right . 694260_694570
they remember the goddamn Watergate name Adams &-uh yeah you know
so that's sort of right passed off . 698570_700730
but the I think the the terribly important point is &-uh
they have to once they come out as long as someone takes action
gonna be and you can't keep then talking about the goddamn thing .
someone takes action . 721660_722620
you mean against who . 722770_723990
well <whoever whoever> whoever did it . 724410_726220
yep . 726370_726460
yeah that's pretty tough . 727390_729740
that's you know when when that happens . 731150_732980
well then then that's the end of the that's the end of the
then you have a complete defense to &-uh course they're not just
they're gonna go onto Segretti which is just crap as you know they
but we ought_to be defense . 744720_745480
we ought_to just take the attack on that . 745740_747390
say for christ sake . 747580_748540
what_about burning on our headquarters and all that sort of thing .
oh absolutely . 751410_751820
and and apparently &-uh and I've told also you're them to get
(be)cause Buchanan was working on this . 758440_760100
and he said . 760120_760380
we don't have anything . 760520_761190
oh hell . 761490_761740
we had a_lot_of . 761760_762220
and I said . 762340_762840
well god Dammit Coon's office was working on this for months . 763100_765420
so they've got something . 765460_766350
well I've sent them all . 767200_767940
I've sent them all back into the files . 768290_769660
I I saw them all Wednesday and &-um &-uh good yesterday and the
you see it's terribly important that at the highest priority put
not only that Mr President but but &-uh a government today is
leasing them out . 801610_802060
people can buy them or rent them from what's the same thing that
taking political money and converting it to your personal profit .
I well I who'd you give that to any some stupid ass or somebody who
I gave it to Adams today to research . 815650_817040
he's a bright young fellow . 817160_818070
mhm . 818550_818670
we'll get it out . 819280_819750
&-uh if if we can hang it on him got out or get it out . 820070_822990
that's the kind of stuff that . 823010_823720
what the hell . 823810_824160
that's I mean that's personal &-uh profit from political tions
they hung out on selling his funds sure is is that's right . 830130_833750
yeah they're not his list . 834130_834910
they belong to the party . 834930_835720
that's right . 836130_836470
who you know distribute . 836750_837990
well let event &-uh do your study and &-uh tell the people to get
but I personally you know I'm not &-uh sorry . 844930_847400
I'm not a bit &-uh depressed about the thing . 849350_853200
I think that there's a tendency though for most of our people to
oh Christ everything's coming to apart . 863350_865630
well we've got a few things that we should be proud of you know . 865760_869070
oh Mr President you know I was thinking of that last night . 869300_872230
Cambodia or I remember after Cambodia we were all cowering . 873410_876150
well we should have been out proud as hell . 876170_877830
that's right . 877870_878160
it's this thing . 879700_880550
the most important thing if I had any advice at all for you the
magnificent things that are and the difference in this country
and when you became president is is every one of us who have
much to be proud of about and talk about it . 900600_901990
that's the point . 902300_902900
just not god . 902990_903740
dammit . 903760_904060
yeah . 904210_904340
and the whole damn White House staff and everybody else gotta be
well that's right . 910950_911940
and and this this thing is going to one way or another this
and then <so it's> so it's do you believe that . 917530_920390
the quicker &-uh how do you get it &-uh brought to a conclusion . 920440_924610
nobody knows . 926300_926910
I'll give you some ideas on that . 927110_928140
I know how that can be done . 928520_929420
alright . 929440_929670
give me a paper on that . 930460_931180
will you I'll have one for you . 931200_932300
