Remember to speak out so that your comments will be audible on the
okay, the topic that you have been asked to discuss concerns ethnic
Does the presence of such organizations in school promote
Do you have any other ideas for reducing segregation within the
I think that of ⁎course⁎ they promote segregation, but I think I
I don't like using that word self segregation as far as those
yeah .
and talk the way they want to talk and share share an identity that
yeh . 46601_47042
and so I I think if segregation is the word you want to call it
they do do it and I think it's okay . 50572_52661
I do too . 52661_53439
because I think that and <so like> so much of your experience
I think segregation makes me think maybe like a negative
in that that's what like Emily just said like if that's what
But I agree that they are healthy . 99030_100725
I think the only negative aspect that I can think of is that when
inclusive err . 107287_108065
ummm . 108065_108855
that: number one I think people view them as as: a reactionary
and that's not I guess maybe that's not the best perception for
and kind of relating to that the second thing is that if you
like you can't you can't expect the majority whose not included
like after you decide to start that you know this
to get motivated . 148781_149130
yeh which is . 149130_150256
not segregated . 150256_151347
kind of one+sided and it kinda sucks but I guess it just
Like the BSA for example . 159182_160889
I think a lot of people have a problem with, number one with the
Well no, it's just the context in which a lot of African American
uhhuh . 173250_173644
that they may not, may or may not be able to address during the
but if you ever want anyone else to come then what do you do ? 176524_179310
Put up flyers . 179310_180273
right . 180273_180668
send out emails . 180668_181573
right . 181572_181967
blah blah blah, you know no one's ever come and you know hey, why
Umhmm . 184752_185240
because I mean that's just I guess the exclusionary element of . 185240_187934
segrated .
yeh . 188979_189327
yeh . 189327_189722
It's the same thing with Foster because . 189722_191370
yeah . 191370_191939
I don't think that . 191939_192206
I don't know what Foster is . 192206_193077
Foster is forum on sexuality to encourage respect . 193077_195898
Okay . 195898_196467
And like I don't think that we're at the point yet like at
You know just saying hi I'm gay and I'd like to be in your club . 215542_218503
You know, but, still at the same time like <we have to do> we
to make people feel comfortable . 223896_224558
because you know if you say if you say well umm we're gonna
and . 235355_235842
right . 235842_236017
I understand that but at the same time, there is something that is
and there is some uhyeh, I mean that, that, but like there is
you know . 248994_249563
who kind of understand like or who kind of are dealing with the
you know ? 264491_264886

It's an opportunity for you to be able to be comfortable . 266279_268810
Yeh . 268810_269368
And so the question is, <does that &~cou > does that
well, no because that's who you interact with all the time . 277820_279863
You know ? 279863_280687
yeh . 280687_281175
