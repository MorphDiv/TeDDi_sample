conversation number thirty eight . 2860_4430
dash nine portion of a telephone conversation between the President
Colson's in with Eman apparently he said he had some urgent to talk
I don't know what the hell . 26080_26710
it's about . 26760_26980
I don't know . 27200_27460
and he came over with his attorney Jewish friend . 28740_31460
mhm . 32180_32390
that's one thing I'm a little disturbed about . 33740_36020
yeah aren't you . 36400_37270
yep . 37560_37660
yeah I am I just don't know what the hell . 37960_39940
they're up to half the time Colson thinks he's he is smart . 39960_43780
but you know sometimes you just goes and talks pretty freely . 43940_47620
and you never know whatever it is . 47640_51110
what are you &-uh analyzing this Dean thing and so_forth . 51990_56950
&-um it's your view that Dean probably didn't know the time after
I don't think he knew for sure . 66890_67780
that's what he he guessed it might be . 68060_69500
I think . 69720_70340
well we all guessed didn't didn't think he had any choice . 70470_73100
well we didn't really <did we> did we thought it was some screw
I mean that was in fact if I thought of about it at all . 76800_79180
and I'm afraid it didn't think enough about it . 79200_80620
but remember I thought . 80700_82220
oh this is just nuts you know . 82470_83990
and of_course I couldn't I didn't dream that Mitchell would do
yeah no I'm talking about after the election back at the beginning
but oh <no no> no <I mean> I mean when we first heard about
oh yeah that right . 95640_96740
but when Dean had his conversation . 96930_97900
oh after the election we all knew . 98250_99300
yeah I mean we all had a pretty good idea . 99470_101740
but I mean &-uh right after in June for example when we first heard
and Dean had his meeting I don't think any of us really thought . 106260_108670
that that &-uh Mitchell could possibly be be involved . 109210_111420
I think that's right or Mcgruder for that matter . 111760_114180
that's right . 114880_115100
I mean we thought with these guys just went off on a caper . 116120_118340
yep . 118550_118660
hmm . 121120_121160
well I'll tell you that I've just listened to this Magruder tape
yeah . 126720_126870
tell me what you think of it . 126920_127780
there's not there's it's all there . 127830_130180
it's an extremely valuable thing to have . 130979_133580
(be)cause he he flatly says that he did it . 134090_138270
and you know that he was he says he's got a hundred years worth a
and &-uh he says . 149960_151040
I'm gonna when I talk I'm gonna tell the truth . 151140_152620
and &-uh so he's gonna get off the perjury . 153610_155430
yep . 156030_156180
but that's what Erlichman told me that he he was gonna talk so
no . 161460_161630
if he had said he hasn't decided yet whether he is gonna talk or
he might go the fifth I suppose and say nothing . 166020_168060
yeah . 168700_168780
&-uh but it would appear that he's thought through and prepared for
and and his lawyers are advising him to talk . 172780_175780
mhm and &-uh he says . 176410_178010
when I talk it won't &-uh in any way implicate Haldeman and
mhm . 185380_185500
and there was no no involvement and no knowledge of either . 186060_189500
and &-uh well in this respect Bobby he is telling the truth . 191340_193820
but he says it will hang Mitchell . 194020_195300
hmm .
what the hell . 201030_201620
do you think this . 201640_202420
of_course we we'll see what Colson's latest vignette is . 202700_205260
but yeah I just gotta say what in the name of god <is is> is
I mean &-uh I don't know what's your guess though . 211910_213820
I mean it's a curious thing . 213870_215300
self defense . 215760_216190
I mean just part of this game and almost making it up though . 216480_220380
Bob because I don't he may be victimized on it . 220420_222910
I'm not sure he's made you mean by his lawyer . 223640_225100
yeah or somebody else or by the press . 225550_228780
you know this that was my first impression was that this was a
mhm . 234640_234760
they call you and say . 234880_235790
&-uh yeah the other guy's stuff . 235860_237580
&-uh you better let let's us talk about it . 237760_240020
and so Riter is going to has already he's he's talked and he's
you see this . 247320_247890
this went so far that but when you examined Chuck he said he backed
huh . 255890_255940
that's right . 255960_256390
oh god damn him . 257480_258230
he shouldn't do that with you . 258339_259300
I mean really not I mean I understand with others but not with you
no . 262510_262620
but he just does he he is compulsively unable to limit himself
he has to embellish . 269980_270990
well you know the real problem is John god . 276340_278630
damn . 278680_278910
I feel for him . 279120_279780
yep . 279980_280070
and &-uh geez . 280700_282590
if I were advising him I'd advise him to come forward and say . 282690_285190
gee I you know I've told the truth all along . 285300_288310
and but I take the responsibility for this thing you know I mean
he really ought_to do that rather_than go at a hard line . 293980_296620
this damn thing . 296640_297270
he says . 297700_298010
I didn't know about it . 298120_298940
I didn't approve it . 299080_299820
but I take the responsibility for it . 299930_301340
right . 302540_302630
yep . 302860_302950
and they'd let him off . 304340_304940
they'd say . 304960_305150
well you know this great man was that's right screwed up and ill
and that's too bad . 310390_311140
and that's right . 311220_312740
obviously he had other pressures on him and you know one of those
but he really ought_to do that . 317960_318740
but who the hell can talk to John Moore is the only one . 318760_322180
and I don't know whether he's got much influence anymore . 322200_324200
well I think I'll get more in tomorrow and talk to him a little
I think that would be helpful . 329230_329820
I don't know &-uh or is that bad . 330160_332070
yeah I guess it's bad . 333220_334470
I really ought_to stay away from it . 338100_339460
you know because basically &-uh it isn't just the consumption of
but I really don't know what the hell did happened . 345660_348300
you know <I don't> I don't really know you know . 348360_351060
and &-uh and I I feel for all these people . 351080_353910
I'd like to do something to save them all . 354140_356820
but there isn't a goddamn thing you can do is there . 356840_359220
do you think of anything . 359470_360180
nope I don't I mean you say don't let Dean go like John says . 360500_363820
well for Christ's sake we don't let him . 364000_365100
somebody else is gonna go . 365440_366150
isn't that it . 366540_366950
yep . 367540_367630
I think you're sure you I think you just cannot obscure the the
you've just got to whatever it is . 377100_379180
we've got to be prepared to live with it . 379380_381540
and we will live with it . 383340_384200
let say . 384620_384920
<don't be> don't be too damn worried about it . 385040_387670
and we've gotta live with that too . 388020_388980
don't be too damn concerned about it . 389450_391100
and they say . 391180_391640
Mitchell the attorney general and the president's campaign manager
it's gonna be lemme tell you . 394870_395790
yes . 396540_396570
that's tough any any tougher than Adams no my god Adams was
he was with him with the heart attack . 403400_404470
he was president . 404520_405230
actually that's right you know let's face it . 405600_407330
and it was personal . 408910_409780
ity and not just a caper . 410080_412110
this is just a caper . 412370_413380
like your poll showed . 413470_414520
yeah . 415030_415090
this concludes the abuse of government power segments for
dash nine . 426390_427180
