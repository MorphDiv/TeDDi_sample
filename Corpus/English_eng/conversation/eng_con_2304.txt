Right, so the background for this is that it's for my child psych class . 0_6937
and these are qu-, these are questions that I've written based off the suggestions that um were given for the paper assignment . 6937_15211
Um, so for all these questions please keep in mind how you would answer them specifically in terms of your own childhood slash how you were raised or you intend to raise your own children, and how you see children being raised in society as a whole . 15211_28485
those a- those are the three things you should keep in mind . 28485_31291
but otherwise, it's quite ⌈straight-forward . 31291_34263
⌊but otherwise it's quite straight forward, exactly ha ha ha . 34430_36409
so question one: how do you see nature, that is genetic makeup, and nurture, physical and social environment, contributing to a child's development ? 36409_48699
nature and nurture, not nature or nurture ? 48699_53995
you can treat is as an and or question if you would like . 53995_57087
they're fairly open to interpretation . 57087_60994
well, I see both of them making a contribution . 60994_62873
and uh, especially the oh the nurture, the environment or lack of it . 62873_73512
hh hh hh . 73512_75392
children coming from a good home versus a so-called broken home, children with access to good food and good education versus no access . 75392_89771
so I think it makes a tremendous difference in how the child turns out 89771_96919
ok, excellent 96919_107577
question two is: what do you think influences the development of specific traits such as athletic ability, food preference, choice of friends, and intellectual ability ? 108367_118014
oh boy . 118014_120236
well, let's see choice of foods and friends is mostly what you grow up with . 129046_142082
you eat what your parents eat, or what you're forced to eat 142082_147714
Um, you may be influenced by your friends in the sense of being introduced to junk food, for example . 147714_161434
but again, a lot of the primary influence is you either get good or bad eating habits from your immediate home environment . 161434_172658
um athletic ability that's a tougher one . 172658_183871
Well basically the question is looking for whether or not you think it's something that is inherantly biological or something that you acquire through social interaction or environmental factors . 183871_197725
I don't think people are born athletes . 197725_206371
Certainly if you decide to become an athlete of a particular kind your genetic makeup will help in a sense you'll have longer legs or good bones or whatever, but if you don't have parents who are willing to encourage the ability or if you don't have access to a running track or a gymnasium or whatever it is ⌈ the environment counts for a lot 246655_252809
⌊mm
in my own mind, I'm an olympic gold medalist ! 252809_262586
hh hh hh indeed you are . 262586_265976
&=coughs right, so what child-rearing practices do you view as most and least effective, in terms of discipline, encouragment etc what is the right role for a parent to play in a child's life ? 265976_278341
most effective leading by example . 279244_283314
least effective coercion by punishment . 283314_292645
very concise, wow . 292645_295131
°so Dad° 295131_303139
°where'd you go° ? 303139_307153
I should say most effec- or least effective coercion by reward and punishment . 307153_317761
ok, I'll add that Um, but in terms of, then discipline what, how do you see discipline working, then ? 320351_329287
aaah &=thud Most effective least effective ? 329287_335753
yea 335753_336737
&=clanking aah 335753_344518
that looks ridiculous hh hh 344518_349059
the village stocks 349059_352256
I know, right 352256_353346
&=clanking I mean, you didn't beat the crap out of me when I was little . 353346_363299
right, and I never once felt I had to either but why, I mean I can't re 353346_371192
well, I mean cuz we were talking about it in class, like different, different methods of discipline, different methods of enforcing rules in a house and I mean, how-how do you communicate to a child this is how we do things in this house, and if you don't do things this way, this is the consequence ? 371192_390742
I mean ok, well it doesn't even have to be specific to me as a kid, like what, how do you see like an ideal scenario like that playing out ? 390742_405890
if you, if- if the kid's not allowed to put their feet on the chair, like what, how do you communicate to them they can't do that ? 405890_412568
do you like scream at them, do you hit them, do you say I'll give you a candy bar if you don't do that, like 412568_417697
I think, no it's ⌈ I would say explain the reason for it 412568_424657
⌊ I mean, those are all ridiculous extremes, but y'know
and try to get the kid to understand why that ⌈that's rule exists I mean, the last thing you want is that's the law because I said ⌈so . 424657_446218
⌊ok
right ok, so no handing down of ⌈ ha ha commandments
⌊no, as they say, no appeals to authority 446218_470268
&=clanking ∬he's ironing right now, by the way just for the record &=clanking, that's why he keeps disappearing he just put away the ironing board and we're at Pap's∬ 470268_470997
&=muffled that's easier said than done, of course 470997_474963
ok, so the next question is: do you believe that children learn more from their peers or from older children and adults ? 474963_482226
oh, I think they learn more from their peers, simply because their peers are the ones they associate with most, and however well-, aah, I mean obviously you learn from your parents 482226_504923
you learn the roles from your parents, you learn the interesting stuff from your peers hh hh and for older children naaah &=sigh I don't know, I don't think I, uh, it depends on how yeah, I'd say more peers 514741_532927
mkay &=turning:pages hoooo, let's see This is the one for you !
No, actually that't the next one my bad um, what changes in child-rearing practices have you witnessed across generations ? 532927_550460
⌈so it was primarily for Pap, that one, but 550460_555623
⌊well, for my- what ?
well, for my generation there were certain things that you did that brought out the leather strap 555623_560679
jumping on the bed was one, I can speak to personal experience ⌈from there ehm . 560679_572530
⌊ooh that was administered by your dad ? 572530_577587
yea, but I think sometimes my mother, but usually my dad 577587_582955
and then of course there was the corporeal punishment in schools with the the cane . 582955_596330
and was that at the Christian school, or +/? 596330_604180
well, they're all Christian in Ireland, so 604180_607619
that's true, k +...
well there was a oh no nuns, no, teachers this was a- this was at
but they would've been brothers handing down the whacking or nuns or
and what kinda things would you get caned for and like, to what exent ?
God . 621605_628344
Um, not doing your homework, or answering questions incorrectly when you should know them 628344_635518
god ! 635518_636651
yea when you're supposed to learn something about a subject, and you might get away with one or two wrong answers, but if you're consistantly &=smacking . 636651_651505
and it was a hand ? 636651_653377
yea, six . 653377_654326
Six ? 654326_655361
if it was really bad I don't think I ever got six, but six of the best, it used to be called . 659550_661806
god what'd the cane look like ? 661806_665262
it looked like a walking stick, but made of really skinny bamboo, so it would go whshew ! 665262_671274
oh god . 671274_672166
would sting when it came down ! 672166_675033
it was a very skinny walking stick flexible 675033_680443
and ⌈why the hand ?
⌊and if it had followed that trajectory we would now have an advanced design carbon fiber model 680443_690105

oh brother 690105_695842
and why the hand ?
because it was easier than the buttocks hh hh . 696926_698948
ok so have you noticed any cultural differences in the ways that children are raised ? 698948_716988
Mister resident alien . 716988_719723
oh, I dunno if it's ⌈ cultural so much as generational the fact that when I'm in a restaurant and I see the parents, the Yuppie parents smiling indulgently as their little brat almost goes head-first through a display case hh hh . 719723_743079

tyha ! 771000_773000
no, but I mean you say that but you didn't beat the shit out of me when I was little, so . 773000_777750
but you weren't a monster for some reason . 777750_780500
an I think part of it was, you learned to talk very early on and we could commun⌈icate with you I think it's a big difference-we never had the Terrible Twos be-because you could talk well before two, and 780500_793429
⌊that is true, I think I mean it really does play a big role
see, you should've had a nother one, ⌈ then it would all have been different . 794299_809209
⌊it's not that there wer- it's not that there weren't some battles, but it was just, y'know I heard the horror stories from other people because I think they were just trying too hard
they had this idea that . 809209_819459
although I mean ther-there're kids who can't actually produce speech themselves, but they-they still undoubtedly understand a lot of what you're saying, ⌈so it is possible to reason with them, even if they can't respond to you in words, but I still definitely think it makes it more difficult ⌊yeah
alright, nearly there um, have you noticed any sex differences in the way that children are raised ? 828069_838700
not apart from the the stereotypical stuff, you know the boys play with the tanks and guns and the girls play with the dolls because that's what people will give them . 838700_851839
the same thing with dressing them . 851839_857489
but in terms of attitudes of parents towards the children discipline-wise, chores, career encouragement, that kind of thing no differences ? 857489_871000
I can't say I have because I haven't really paid attention to what other people do unless they're blatantly setting the child up to be a psychopath in later life 871000_886879
ok ⌈ and I mean, if you reflect on your own childhood though, I mean, obviously I know the way that you guys raised me, I wasn't told that I was destined to be a secretary or whatever, but um I mean the way when you were growing up, did you notice differences in the way that boys and girls were raised ? 886000_905939
um∬I can't say that I did, ⌈but they were probably there, I just never ⌈ if there's anything to it I'm oblivious∬ . 905939_919000
⌊ok ⌊nnnuh, that's fine
alright, and the last one is comparing two like the most prominant theories of this type of child development, there's stage theories and continuous development the-theories . 919000_931249
and so stage theories, the kind of dumbed-down explanation is that children go through distinct stages as they mature and they have to be ready to be ready to move out of one stage before they can go on to the next one ⌈ Piaget . 931249_943359
⌊yea
um, and the continuous development is that children gradually learn new things as they mature and kind of master each task as they go, that there's no specific st⌈age . 943359_957900
⌊specific stage
and so my last question for you is which one of those theories do you think most accurately represents your views, and why would you say that ? 957900_965059
that's funny because ⌈ well, yea when we we talk, there's a thing included in some topic of computer science called process improvement . 965059_979679
it's an essay question !
hh hh .
and there are process improvement models that have been put out by the guy who died recently, Ross Hunter and there's a stage model that he used . 979679_992000
hh, that's funny . 992000_994639
and there are computing theories about, you know this company in that stage one, stage two, stage three whereas this one is yea, they're doing a little bit of this, but here they're doing that from a higher ⌈level .
⌊but in that model they're two things that can co-exist ?
uum . 1012509_1014000
because, the ⌈ the the proponents of the two respective theories are like bitter enemies in psychology, and +...
yea, I think well
they're not in this, yea
yea ⌈ I mean they, th-the the stage theories came first, so continuous development references stage theories, even though they don't agree with it they're like 'oh, well you see such-and-such a kid is obviously exhibiting elements of this stage but also of this stage' but they don't actually believe in the concept of stages 1022629_1041539
⌊ so, I think it's more two models that
Whereas Piaget in the stage theories idea was really hardcore about like you have to have accomplished all of these developmental milestones within this stage before you can move on .
Doesn't correspond to age ⌈I-I mean it roughly does, but th-the individual markes are the things that you gave gone through, the things that you have mastered, and until you have done all of them, you are stuck in whatever stage 1041539_1066879
yea, but not, but not necessarily
ah I mean so it's it's .
so which one of those would you go for ?
well the problem is, it's never an either-or 1075000_1079989
well yea, I mean I understand that, but like or d'you have any kind of leavnings or or you just ambivalent about it ? 1079989_1085649
I duno, I think practically I would just with continuous, but the uh, I can certainly see how there are some adults that they may be chronologically adults but they're still teenagers . 1085649_1105709
ok so that's the-the stuck in one stage kind of idea ? 1105709_1113500
yea . 1113500_1138000
(...) &=footsteps mkay, well unless you have anything that you would like to add, or things that you think I left out or whatever, then that the end of the questions . 1113800_1172299
