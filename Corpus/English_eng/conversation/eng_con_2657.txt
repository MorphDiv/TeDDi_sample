&-um okay so I &-uh without further ado we'll start with &-uh the recently named JAIL group &-um &=laughs:multiple and have +//. 335475_342595
hear hear their thoughts on why the drug war was a good idea and and especially why we should sentence crack offenders more harshly than cocaine offenders . 342835_350395
take it ⌊ away ⌋ .
⌈ okay ⌉ . 350835_351535
<I'm gonna start> &-um I'm gonna start just by giving a little overview of the justification for the drug war explain why it's necessary then Jorge will be talking about how crack in particular causes crime or contributes to crime and then Justin will go into a little more about the sentencing &-um of crack versus cocaine . 352355_374935
so as we all know just from watching the news drugs are a very serious problem in the United States . 376265_381385
over a million people are arrested each year for selling or possession of drugs . 382125_385865
given the magnitude of this problem obviously something really needs to be done . 386585_390865
if it's not the war on drugs then what is it gonna be ? 391985_394285
there're several alternatives that've been offered there's legalization or semilegalization but personally we don't think that this is really an option it will increase the access to drugs it will increase the addiction of drugs it will increase criminal behavior and the cycle of poverty will be perpetuated in inner cities . 395325_413785
we could reduce try to reduce the supply . 414565_416665
but as we saw in the Reagan administration this won't work either . 417305_420045
we can try to reduce the demand but through &~pro educational programs &-uh such as DARE but as we see without that program it doesn't work and actually encourages rather than discourages drug use . 420745_432665
instead we need to make crime not pay penalties must be swift certain and severe in_order_to be effective . 433705_438365
as one of the articles that we read this week says &{l=READING the problem with the get tough approach is that it is not tough enough . 439485_444205
&}l=READING a couple examples of this drug offenders only serve on average one third of their sentence . 445505_449725
a hundred and forty three out_of every thousand serious offenders are punished . 450665_454185
it's a very small number . 455225_456025
&-um the likelihood of those caught receiving a punishment is only fifty percent and drug dealers only have a four percent chance of being punished per drug transaction . 456645_466345
as all this evidence shows the current war on drugs is neither swift certain or severe . 467505_471545
do the crime do the time needs to become our motto . 472595_474815
everyone who snorts smokes inhales or ingests an illegal substance should be punished for it . 475875_480895
because there has been some evidence that drug policies affect only people of color is somewhat irrelevant . 481695_486815
we should punish everybody who does an illegal substance regardless of the color of their skin . 487235_492135
&-um it just so happens we haven't yet devised a plan to target necessarily middle+class &~n drug users but that doesn't mean that they are any less culpable for their crimes . 492915_504235
&-uh drug abuse as we can see from looking at any popular media report is increasingly concentrated in inner city areas . 505035_512075
most crimes are committed by poor minority citizens and they are committed against poor minority citizens . 513075_517535
my question is as policy formulaters how can we sit back and ignore this entire population of people ? 518385_523685
if we don't focus on this population and target their drug use &~i in an attempt to reduce crime then we are perpetuating the cycle of poverty by ignoring this entire group of citizens . 524505_533345
so now we need to figure out how we are going to more effectively fight this war on drugs . 534725_539145
&-uh deterrence and prevention through incapacitation is the key . 539985_543145
since nineteen seventy three incarceration rates are at the highest level ever . 543805_547125
however crime rates are in a at an all+time low something is obviously working right . 547885_552945
we are safe now more safe than we have ever been before because there are less crimes being committed . 553245_559525
mandatory minimums are an effective and efficient way to address the severe societal impact of all types of drugs they are swift they are certain and they are severe . 560565_567865
we need more police officers stricter enforcement in of the laws and quicker and stricter punishments . 568535_573315
we need to increase finally we need to increase spending on the drug war . 574095_577835
currently only about one cent out_of every federal dollar is spent on the war &-um and as is evident we cannot effectively fight this way unless we are given the resources to do so . 578135_589235
finally the United States is a constitutionally &~guaran has a constitutionally guaranteed interest in protecting life liberty and property of all Americans . 590025_596745
we are failing at this task unless we step up the war on drugs to protect all of our citizens not just the economically privileged . 597485_602785
(0.4) .
okay my intervention is about a connection between drugs and crime . 605865_611965
and drug and especially crack cocaine is associate with &~system systemic crime . 614175_618995
research allowed the enforcement official report that much of the violence associated with crack cocaine stem from attempts by competing factions to consolidate control of drug distribution in urban areas . 619695_634895
for example &-uh twenty seven point nine percent of the crack offender possess xxx weapons compared to fifteen point one of powder cocaine offender and are more likely to have more extensive criminal &~rec record . 635935_652635
&-uh twenty twenty point four of crack &~defen &~defend defendants have the &~high highest criminal history . 653635_661015
United States Intensive Commission shows that crack cocaine defendant also are more likely to have a recent criminal &~reco record . 662955_672395
thirty three percent are under a preexisting criminal justice sentence at the time of they most recent federal offense . 673535_684675
the Commission &~f found that forty eight percent of men and sixty two percent of women who use crack engage in petty property crime and a significant minority of the main committed fairly high high number of violent or potentially violent offense . 685655_708335
this history also report that sixty nine percent of women crack user engage in prostitution . 710185_716825
the prevalence of cocaine supports babies children neglected or abandoned by mother addict to drugs an increase an illegitimate births or an increase in gratuitous violence . 717885_734645
heroin cocaine crack and methamphetamines are highly toxic substance and xxx of to then engage in all kinds of destructive behavior from preying on family member to assaulting a stranger to abusing children . 736435_755975
okay &-um I'm gonna to get into a little bit more now about the sentencing disparity between powder cocaine and crack cocaine . 759265_766065
we think it's pretty self-evident that drugs are a real problem &-um that they are very destructive that they create lots_of destructive behavior . 766445_774065
&-uh but what I think is maybe not so evident to people who criticize these sentencing laws is the fact that crack cocaine simply results in greater harms to society . 774925_784845
it's more dangerous it's more destructive &-um it's basically the worst drug that is out there on the streets today . 784815_792695
now because of that we feel that like the sentencing disparities currently in effect under federal guidelines are legitimate . 793215_798815
they shouldn't be lessened and in fact you could even make a case that they're not stringent enough . 799135_802915
&-um so lemme talk about why crack is is worse . 803615_806175
first off &-uh pharmacologically &-um it's worse than powder cocaine you can +//. 806835_812935
you know some people try and claim they're the same drug that's simply not true it's true that they have the same active chemical ingredients you know crack is produced from powdered cocaine but to say the two are the same is like saying that hemp is the same as marijuana . 813735_826375
they're sure they're the same plant but there's a vast difference in potency . 827015_830175
the same is true of crack and powder cocaine and this of_course comes from the method of administration &-um by smoking the crack the effect is much more intense it's also much more short lived . 830335_841495
&-um because crack or and powder cocaine are not pharmacologically or physically addictive but psychologically addictive the shorter more intense high leads to a quicker and greater craving which leads to more addiction so this obviously makes it a more dangerous more destructive drug . 842165_859385
in addition this shorter more intense high leads to binging . 859945_863825
&-um this can lead to all kinds of problems . 864465_866045
it leads to more crime as Jorge talked about &-um to fuel these cravings it also leads to more destructive &-um behavior like sexually risky behavior sex for drugs &-um that sort of thing . 866125_881305
so I think that to say that they're the same drug is naive and not at all true . 881525_887605
now another set of factors that makes crack more dangerous can kinda be grouped under the heading of the characteristics of the crack market . 887925_897005
&-um Jorge's already talked a little bit about &-uh the violence that's you know highly correlated with the crack markets across the country . 897925_905285
but there's also other &-uh things that fall under this heading . 905865_908345
there's the marketability of crack &-uh it's able to be sold in small &-uh packages for only five to ten dollars . 908485_914625
&-um this means that it's basically accessible to everyone particularly children particularly the people who are economically disadvantaged &-um and you know that's actually born out by &-uh the statistics that the Sentencing Commission &-uh looks at . 915225_929405
you know of those who've used cocaine in the last year &-uh the more &~twelve to seventeen year+olds used crack twenty six percent than any other age group . 929845_938045
so it's not just a a theory that it's more accessible to children there's more children using crack . 938545_943625
&-uh which you know obviously disturbs us due to its high potential for addiction . 944265_947625
&-um also there's a high rate of involvement of juveniles and women in the crack trade . 948465_952405
&-um because of way the trade is organized a_lot_o(f) street corner selling it's very sort_of &-uh disorganized lends itself well to the type of employees if you will and also they're viewed as less susceptible to prosecution . 953105_967025
so we feel like getting people involved in crime would maybe you know we would like to see involved in positive &-um things in life as opposed to crack and the crack trade . 967705_978205
&-um also as as we've talked a little bit about the more likelihood of high risk behavior the binging factor again also means that if a pregnant woman is smoking crack as opposed to snorting it there's the likelihood that she'll expose her baby to higher levels of the substance so that also comes into play . 978985_994925
&-um I guess finally you know to talk about &-um the issue of well you know <a a> a a certain amount of powder cocaine can be turned into a much greater amount of crack cocaine . 995705_1008545
we sort_of think that regardless of what powder cocaine may or may not be turned into at some indeterminate point in the future the fact is that once somebody takes that step and converts it to crack they're then selling a more dangerous drug . 1009145_1021265
and they need to be punished . 1021365_1022165
&-uh you know they need to have a harsher punishment levied on them . 1022705_1025585
I mean we wanna see the day when no crack is sold at all . 1026065_1028265
we wanna see the day when no drugs of any kind illegal drugs that is are sold on the streets . 1028445_1033045
&-uh but as crack is the worst we want to see that go down first . 1033685_1036625
so we think that you know the &~pu the penalties are already very stiff and yet you still have people producing crack selling it on the streets we want to see the penalties so stiff that dealers don't want to touch crack . 1037465_1047725
you know if you want crack you'll have to convert the powder into crack in your own kitchen . 1048305_1052205
&-um you know that right there would eliminate a certain segment of the market . 1053325_1056685
children who don't have access to that you know or don't have the ability or the access to a kitchen to turn it into crack some economically disadvantaged I mean . 1056905_1064405
you know &~i &~i we we think that perhaps frankly that the penalties and or the disparity isn't high enough . 1065305_1070285
(0.5) .
okay . 1071625_1074485
great that was great . 1074805_1075845
and I know they all firmly believe all that stuff . 1076865_1079505
okay . 1080465_1080885
&-um I'm gonna start us off . 1081445_1082945
I'm gonna basically provide kinda introduction &-uh to our arguments &-um then I'll turn it over to the two of them . 1083025_1089165
I'd I'd like to start out with some statistics actually just to get us thinking about some of the issues involved in the war on drugs . 1089385_1095545
&-um first in nineteen ninety six ninety three percent of all federal drug war spending went to law enforcement efforts while only seven percent went to treatment and other strategies . 1096065_1105425
&-um in the early nineteen seventies in New York the Rockefeller Drug Laws mandated harsh prison terms and forbade plea bargaining . 1107325_1114005
a massive multiyear evaluation concluded implementation of the laws had no effect on drug trafficking drug use or drug related health problems . 1114565_1121725
in nineteen eighty twenty five percent of federal prisons were drug &~of excuse_me nineteen eighty twenty five percent of federal prisoners were drug offenders by nineteen ninety two this number had increased to fifty eight percent . 1123665_1134245
typical estimates of the average annual cost of holding one prisoner ranged from twenty thousand to thirty thousand dollars &~highe higher on average than the annual tuition at Harvard University . 1135305_1145365
under nineteen eighty eight federal law possession of more than five grams of crack cocaine triggers a minimum sentence of five years in prison . 1147495_1153975
simple possession of any quantity of powdered &~quar cocaine or any other drug is punishable by a maximum of one year in prison . 1154755_1161415
after ninety after nineteen eighty nonwhite drug arrest rates rose steadily and then skyrocketed . 1163335_1168215
by nineteen eighty eight they were five times higher than white rates . 1168475_1172375
and then finally average time served in federal prison for drugs is seventy eight months for rape sixty seven months . 1174065_1180305
okay so those statistics were basically like I said just to get us thinking about some of the issues . 1181985_1185985
&-um there are two themes to the arguments that we're gonna present . 1186545_1190585
&-uh the first theme concerns &-um &-uh the two different ways you can categorize &-um approaches to to drugs . 1191025_1199785
&-um the first way is supply side &-uh the supply side approach and second &~si second is the demand side approach . 1200375_1206735
&-um &~suppl supply side efforts include law enforcement &-um general law enforcement in cities local communities &-uh interdiction along borders like the border between the United States and and Mexico and &-uh financial support to other countries that &-um from where a_lot_of drugs that reach the United States originate . 1207635_1226215
&-um demand side efforts &-uh target the demand for drugs . 1226855_1230535
&-um mass media education programs drug education programs in schools such as the DARE program &-uh drug abuse treatment programs . 1231315_1239395
and finally law enforcement efforts aimed at possession of drugs . 1240095_1243275
&-um so basically you know there are two main &-uh categories of efforts &-um supply side and demand side . 1244195_1251415
&-um our argument is simply that there should be a balance we're not saying that there shouldn't be laws against drugs we're not saying that that shouldn't be a a a one of the one of the central foci I guess of of &-uh drug &~enf drug strategy . 1251905_1265485
but we're saying that there should be a balance between the two . 1266065_1267865
right now as a statistic on the federal spending indicates there's a huge imbalance ninety three percent versus seven percent . 1268365_1275525
&-um research has shown that both types of strategies can be effective supply and supply side and demand side strategies . 1276185_1284025
&-um so we are simply advocating for for a balance of the two . 1284145_1286905
&-um furthermore &~if &-uh an imbalance towards the supply side &-um is very expensive and a_lot_of research shows that the difference between a balanced approach a balance between supply and demand and an approach that's completely supply there's no there's basically very little added benefit to that . 1287265_1305665
so and the second argument basically &-um is about &-uh the equity issues or the second theme I should say in our argument it is is equity . 1306725_1314725
&-um basically one of this one of the main strategies of law enforcement &-um is actually a a demand strategy . 1315345_1325865
&-um &-uh sending a message by these laws &-um like mandatory sentences and &-uh those sorts of laws . 1326545_1333945
sending a message that drugs are wrong and that if you do drugs &-um that you'll pay for it . 1334245_1339205
that that's also a demand strategy . 1339485_1340925
&-um we think though that making that a demand strategy has resulted in a_lot_of inequity &-um between &-um blacks Hispanics and sentences that they receive &-um and and the law enforcement presence in their communities versus whites . 1341395_1357755
&-um &-um and we think that given given statistics show that &-um most felony defendants are poor badly educated &~un or underemployed not part of a stable household and black . 1358595_1373595
&-um the efforts of the government which is made up of largely white middle and upper class people the effort of the government to &-uh make law enforcement a demand strategy basically results in lots_of poor people ending up in jail &-um when their efforts are really directed &-um at middle+class and upper class white kids . 1374075_1395355
so that's the second theme and so I'll turn it over to Ally now . 1396195_1399615
okay &-um the first question that I would like to ask is whether the successes of the drug war are balanced with . 1400405_1408425
and I would say that they are fairly limited successes whether they're balanced with &-um the costs which I would say are fairly high both &-um in terms of economics and in terms of the effects on communities and on individuals &-um as_well_as sort_of the detriment that they have to some of the ideals that we hold like equity as being pretty fundamental part of the rights that we enjoy as citizens . 1408755_1432775
&-um first of all I would say that the supply side approach hasn't accomplished very much of what it hopes to . 1433765_1440545
although granted as the other side said &-um there are tremendous increases in prison population &-um which has led to some decrease in crime . 1441245_1450465
but the next logical step to that argument I think is fairly obvious that of_course if everyone was in prison then the whole community would be safer . 1451265_1458565
in fact traditionally the upper classes tend to be very happy in police states . 1458645_1464585
&-um you don't have a_lot_of people who are really unhappy under &-um say for example Franco in Spain . 1465305_1471245
during his reign a_lot_of the upper and middle classes really enjoyed that the power of the police &-um and that presence in the community . 1471825_1478885
so just something to balance out sort of what their argument is over on that side . 1479445_1483545
but as in terms of it actually being a success &-um if the war on drugs was indeed a success then the risk of dealing would be so high that the availability of the availability of drugs would be much lower thus increasing costs . 1484645_1496965
however the the increase the costs of drugs has not significantly increased to &-um dissuade people from using them and massive arrests if they were indeed able to reduce this &-um supply we should have have our streets cleared by now we have tons of people in prisons . 1497535_1514035
however as has been shown &-um these massive sweeps on drug sellers has really just +//. 1514595_1520275
they're replaced almost immediately upon being arrested and placed in prison . 1521135_1524835
that particular approach is clearly unsuccessful .
&-um the other costs Jim already touched upon some of them &-um including the harsher penalties and how they've led to an increase in not not just in terms of enforcement but also in the cost for court costs prosecution and the increase in the prison costs which would include not just the twenty to thirty thousand per year per prisoner but also the cost of new prisons which range between fifty thousand to two hundred thousand dollars per prison . 1528125_1556705
&-um when you multiply that out by states and federal &~tha that turns out to be quite a_lot_of money . 1557235_1561535
&-um but on top of sort_of the costs of of balancing the cost versus the effectiveness of this particular strategy we also have to look at the question of equity &-um in terms of sort_of &~sen strategy that's really made our prison &~popu population disproportionately minority . 1562675_1581655
&-um in terms of where blacks fit in cocaine use they are <fifteen percent> fifteen percent of the black population is involved in use of cocaine whereas they represent ninety percent of those who are imprisoned for &-um cocaine drug offenses . 1582315_1599815
&-um that's obviously a huge disproportion in that particular arena . 1600655_1606115
I'd just like to throw out a little quote here I'm gonna try to wrap up I'm not trying to be over long here . 1606585_1611345
but going into the war on drugs there was a certain amount of awareness that this was going to &~targe target this particular populations disproportionately as &-um senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said &{l=READING it is essential that we in making these choices understand that by choosing to focus on the supply of drugs and on these types of policies we are choosing to have an intense crime problem concentrated among minorities . 1611825_1639125
&}l=READING I think that that is something which is &~r really does raise I think a very valid moral question and something that we need to consider . 1640175_1646395
&-um and I'll turn it over to Missy . 1647455_1648835
okay I'm going to talk about the &-uh sort_of what Jim talked about the intro the two pronged approach that we think should be taken to reforming the war on drugs . 1649215_1658075
two prongs are fifty fifty even treatment in supply controls and second reform of sentencing laws like our crack cocaine disparity law well the disparity in those laws . 1658555_1670715
&-uh first is fifty fifty even treatment . 1671735_1674015
like Jim said our current spending is of seven percent on demand side strategies and nine three percent on supply side strategies and these failures are costly . 1674255_1683115
for every dollar we spend on supply side strategies we lose money . 1683475_1687055
we lose <somewhere between> somewhere between two dollars and an additional dollar . 1687355_1691535
and I guess that the three of us think that this loss of money could be acceptable if results were being produced but they're not . 1692415_1699615
as Ally and Jim talked about we have exploding prison populations which are costly in and of themselves huge racial disparities we haven't seen a massive decline in the amount of drugs used . 1700195_1710795
and so we think there should be a more more even distribution between &~s treatment and enforcement . 1711075_1717755
and treatment includes things like education rehabilitation and harm reduction strategies . 1717955_1722395
and &-um doing harm reduction strategies education rehabilitation studies have found &-uh that for every dollar you invest you save about seven seven dollars and forty six cents which is fifteen times more cost effective than a law enforcement strategy . 1723525_1739425
&-um we understand that there are are some problems with treatment . 1740765_1744365
you can people can take some swipes some whacks at whether or not treatment works &-um but I think we think that there's three things that are important to keep in mind when you look at whether or not treatment is effective currently . 1744425_1754865
first keep in mind that it is competing with a resource deficiency of seven to ninety three percent . 1755645_1760685
second keep in mind that it's judged only by abstinence programs and that honest drug education or some reform to drug education might be a good idea . 1761925_1769685
and third keep in mind that it's still more effective than locking people up for drugs strategies which gives them no chance for treatment and is more expensive and more inequitable . 1770115_1779035
second thing that we want to talk about is reform of sentencing laws . 1780095_1783835
&-uh like Jim touched on in the early seventies we did have mandatory minimums which we repealed because we found that they were not solving for rehabilitation were increasing social alienation were not solving for drug use and thus we got thus we got rid of them . 1784345_1798925
and so we propose that maybe we should change the mandatory minimum laws that we have for disparity between crack and cocaine . 1799105_1805165
&-uh I think that you're pretty clear on what those laws are . 1805725_1808045
there's a gap which is one hundred to one of possession . 1808185_1811005
you're the sentence is a hundred times or a hundred times more harsh for crack . 1811345_1815605
&-um the &~per the change that we would propose would look at the severity of the crime and not just put people in jail for a mandatory minimum . 1817285_1824485
I think a_lot_of the things that Justin discussed are things which are reasonable if there's more crime being associated with the trade if someone gets killed during the trade &-uh <of a> of a drug if someone uses a gun . 1825065_1836945
those are things that should be taken into account in terms of severity but all those things while reasonable don't justify a mandatory minimum of one hundred to one different disparity where you don't look at any aspects of anything that happened during the crime you just immediately put someone in jail or actually in prison for for five years . 1837055_1856815
and &-uh so so I think that I'm gonna kinda read I know that's not always thrilling when somebody reads at you but some of the things that would be taken into consideration if you got rid of mandatory minimums you'd use these sort_of guidelines . 1857685_1869125
&-um you could take into consideration &{l=READING the form of cocaine involved whether or not a firearm or dangerous weapon was involved whether or not the &~s the offense resulted in serious bodily injury or death to another person the extent to which powder cocaine defendant knew the drug would be converted into crack &}l=READING etcetera etcetera . 1869705_1885945
these are all just things that you look at the &~severi there's thirteen of them that you look at about the severity of the crime which we think makes a_lot more sense than just locking people up &-um immediately . 1886025_1895105
and the reason why we think why think is because and Justin did quote a little bit from the Sentencing Commission &-um Study well I just wanna finish their thought that there aren't a_lot_of studies which prove the difference between pharmacology between &-uh deaths and the amount of crime that's committed how much crime people commit when they &-uh use drug violence how many youths &~tha youths are involved . 1895915_1918035
there just aren't many many many &-uh studies that prove this and the ultimate conclusion of the Sentencing Commission report that Justin quoted from is not that we should increase our mandatory minimums or that we should even retain our mandatory minimums but that we should look at the severity of the crime and look at other factors involved when you determine sentencing . 1918045_1937665
and that's it . 1939125_1939685
okay great . 1940885_1941465
WEED and JAIL have their positions on the table . 1942865_1945205
and &-uh now why don't we start with some rebuttals before we go to questions <from the> from the audience here . 1945735_1951015
you guys wanna take it away ? 1951835_1952635
whatever .
okay . 1953235_1956715
well first of all you guys talk about the prison populations and overflowing etcetera etcetera changes in drug arrests and imprisonment policies since nineteen seventy four only account for eight percent of the increase in the prison population . 1958185_1974325
this is not &~a an enormous increase compared to how much the prison population has grown drugs are not necessarily the cause for the bulk of it . 1975085_1984185
changing the sentencing to &~e encompass all of the thirteen points that you mentioned Missy would take too long . 1985165_1992505
it's already already as I mentioned before only four percent of every &~tr of drug dealers are punished &-uh and if we want to for all of their deals we want to take them to trial and take into account all of the different variables that you mentioned it will take too long . 1993085_2012685
punishments will not be swift they will not be certain and they will not be severe . 2012995_2016635
because since the drug war has started the crack market has is no longer expanding is evidence that the war works and because there is no market expansion competition among dealers has increased which has led to increased violence . 2017795_2032035
this increased violence is not associated with powder cocaine and if we don't punish them more severely and more strictly it will the violence will continue to increase &-um +... 2032995_2046475
don't know .
&~w &-um I I can keep going there <if you> if you want &-um I guess to talk about again about punishments &-um versus treatment . 2047495_2059775
you guys talk about a fifty fifty split &-um that you wanna see . 2059995_2063775
&-uh I mean &=laughs when you wanna talk about &-uh uncertain successes I think treatment is &~basici basically your poster child . 2064675_2071555
I mean never have we &=laughs you know had a treatment program that's really been shown to work effectively meanwhile you talk about uncertain successes on the law and order side . 2071795_2080995
well you know I mean crime rates in Michigan are at a basically I think a twenty or thirty year low . 2081795_2086055
&-uh the crime rates across the country are are you know at levels people haven't seen for years . 2086515_2090555
&-uh I think that that's &-uh an indicator of success that's you know that has never been matched by treatment programs . 2091155_2097355
so I don't understand why you're claiming that we should move &~progra or move money to programs that offer us you know that we don't know what they offer us we don't know if they're going to be effective or not from from programs that have been proven to work . 2097875_2110055
&-um when you talk about looking at the severity of crime these are <the thirteen> the thirteen points Holly was talking about . 2110835_2116795
when you do that that's fine for that individual crime . 2117355_2120015
but we wanna squash the market . 2120735_2121935
we feel like you know sure individually &-um you know you can look at what this person you know whether he or she used a weapon etcetera . 2122435_2131955
that's fine for the individual crime . 2132235_2133755
but we wanna make the costs of dealing in crack in general so high that nobody not the violent felons that are certainly out there not the non violent offenders that nobody's gonna wanna deal in crack cocaine . 2133935_2146555
&-um and so we think that the mandatory minimum's the best way to do this . 2147135_2151495
in addition none of those &-uh factors you know looks at the increased addictiveness of crack cocaine . 2151655_2157575
none of them deals with the increased attraction due to cheap marketability of crack cocaine . 2157795_2161935
so you know I think that that's that's an incomplete solution and I don't think it's the cure all that you're you're claiming it is . 2162515_2172395
&-um then you talk about as as evidence that the increased sentencing in the war on drugs hasn't succeeded the fact that costs haven't increased &-uh you_know and that a you know dissuading the populous from using drugs hasn't happened you know . 2172265_2189045
I I think that the best indicator of success in the crime rates and as far as the cost not having increased you know I I agree I think the penalty should be more severe . 2189205_2198285
I think that &-uh we should make the cost so unbelievably high that nobody will want to deal crack cocaine . 2198915_2204355
so you know I don't think that that's necessarily an indicator of failure though . 2205075_2208955
&-um &~a and one last thing . 2210515_2214975
you guys talk a_lot about the costs of &-uh of these programs and &-uh I don't think that we can put a price on some of these issues . 2215415_2222515
again we're we're looking at people twenty six percent of &-uh you know of people who had used crack cocaine last year twenty six percent were between twelve and seventeen years old . 2222985_2233805
can you put a price on the health and safety of well+being of our children ? 2234445_2237945
&=laughs:multiple I don't think you can and I'm not willing to do that I'm not willing to do that . 2238325_2243285
finally about about racial disparities . 2243565_2245425
&-um you know <we wanna> we wanna prosecute everybody who deals in crack cocaine . 2246325_2249825
&-um I don't care what color they are &-um those who are dealing in crack cocaine should be punished . 2250355_2255395
and if you look at some of the other mandatory minimums on the books I think it is clear that they're not racially motivated . 2255995_2261575
&-uh the methamphetamine laws for example . 2261915_2263655
they have the second highest mean and median punishment &-uh second to crack cocaine and those laws affect eighty four percent of whites okay ? 2264055_2271915
so the laws are on the books that have the same effect and in fact in many popular media they say that &~me the methamphetamines will be the next crack cocaine the next big drug and if that happens that it will be mainly white you know white white folks going to jail . 2271955_2284455
that's you know that's not not neither here nor there . 2284815_2287255
that's just if if they're dealing with dangerous drugs they deserve to be put away you know &~wha no matter what color they are . 2287415_2292515
one last point is that &-um all federal circuit courts have upheld these sentencing schemes and they have declared them constitutional . 2292995_2300555
so I think that's important to look at <when you> when you talk about issues of equity . 2301535_2304855
&-um I mean equity also goes to protection under the law . 2305815_2309755
&-um and you know I think that we need to you know prosecute people who are committing crimes in low income neighborhoods as well . 2310975_2319435
I don't know do you have anything else ? 2320655_2321815
(0.5) .
okay great . 2322955_2327675
one last word and we'll open it up . 2328935_2331315
go .
&-um I'll start . 2332055_2335215
&-um I'll talk a little bit about some of the different things people have said about sentencing or reforming sentencing guidelines and a little bit about about treatment and then if any of you have anything to say just jump in whenever I'm done . 2335715_2346255
&-um the first concern I think about reforming sentencing laws is that &~sent the reforming them would take too long . 2346825_2353205
it would have +//. 2353405_2353725
there's you know there's a_lot_of factors that you have to consider but &-uh I I do think we can be judicious we can have a little length in order that we preserve racial equity in this country . 2354105_2363905
I feel that you know fifteen more minutes is probably worth it to say to have &~s things that are much more racially fair particularly when our original laws aren't based &~o our original laws are based more on conjecture when we don't really have studies which prove a_lot_of the reasons why we have the one hundred to one it's based mostly on conjecture . 2364205_2385585
&-um I understand there's a concern that sentencing if you reform sentencing it won't be swift and severe . 2385945_2391145
but &-uh the way +//. 2391545_2392725
reforming and sentencing or changing to a mandatory minimum really doesn't doesn't massively increase whether it's swift and severe . 2393085_2398825
it only shifts discretion from judges to prosecutors . 2398965_2402025
it's just a shift of that discretion while the prosecutor determines whether or not you'll implement or how you'll what you'll do with the law or the sentence . 2402425_2411445
and so I'm not sure that the mandatory minimum <gets all> gets all these great benefits of being swift and severe . 2411745_2418805
and &~l and like we said before there's not much of &~e evidence of &~de of declining of a massive drop in drug use . 2418985_2426525
there might be a decrease in crime rate but that's not the same thing as the decrease in drug use which is what the war on drugs is supposed to produce . 2426945_2433945
and we haven't seen that decline which I think also takes away one of the main reasons why you want to immediately lock &-um everybody up for drug use . 2434565_2444545
&-um does anybody have anything they want to say about that ? 2445505_2447725
&-um I was just going to jump on what you said before about the prosecution . 2448285_2452385
&-um they do have a big hand in punishment and that has been often pointed to as part of the reason for racial disparity because they do have a certain amount of &-um authority to determine whether or not someone's charged on the state or federal level &-um whether they get charged with dealing versus possession obviously dealing being a more stringently punished crime . 2452825_2474585
&~u to go to &-um some of the points that were made on this side as well &-uh I agree with you that we should punish equally . 2475535_2483195
&~tha that was a point that both Justin and Holly ? 2483515_2486075
made earlier . 2486075_2487375
but the point is that currently we aren't punishing equally . 2487735_2490835
currently fifteen percent of cocaine users are african american but as I said before &~ni they are ninety percent of those who are convicted on crack cocaine charges and forty percent of those who are &~con convicted for powder cocaine charges . 2491145_2504785
&-um I think as it's been pointed out previously it is more difficult to &-um sort_of round up those white suburban kids because they have a_lot_of they don't hafta deal on the corner they can deal in their houses . 2505325_2517985
but until we are targeting them just as much as we're targeting these poorer communities there will continue to be a disparity . 2518425_2525465
that point that also hasn't been raised which I think definitely &-um goes into this is the whole idea of &-um in terms of cops and who they pull over there's definitely been a huge debate in the past in really recent times about whether or not you know using racial &-um criteria can be a reason for pulling people over . 2525915_2546735
and it is been shown to be something that even though it might not be mandated by or allowed by different police forces it's certainly one of the criteria that they use for who they pull over . 2547125_2556685
&-um that's definitely worth keeping in mind so Jim ? 2557625_2560465
yeah I I have a_couple_of points to make about sentencing imprisonment . 2560465_2563845
&-um you guys use a_lot_of correlational research &-um in your arguments and I'd &~i I'd like to question that &-um one of the things I'd like to question is you talked about how &-uh crime rates are at an all+time low right now &-um while rates of imprisonment are at an all+time high . 2563825_2581245
therefore putting people in prison is reducing crime . 2581785_2584125
well &-um I read the paper the other day and read that &-um &-uh unemployment <is at> is at a thirty year low right now . 2584825_2590925
so perhaps one of the reasons that crime is at is an all+time low is that employment is an all+time low . 2591085_2596665
we need to start looking &-um at some of the other causes &-uh potential causes of crime such as economic situations . 2597465_2603485
and I think that's doubly so when you look at some of the communities &-um that are so affected by crime and specifically crack cocaine since <we've been> we've been talking a_lot about that . 2603685_2612665
&-um what is it in these communities <that are> that are causing a_lot_of people to turn to the crack trade for their source of income ? 2613165_2620625
&-um and what's causing a_lot_of people who are so &-um &-uh who're having such a a tough time to turn to crack for some kind of enjoyment ? 2621645_2629405
&-um so you know I think we need to consider those those situations . 2629705_2633585
we need to consider the context . 2633765_2634645
&-um and we need to look beyond simple like one on one correlations to explain &-um why crime has gone down . 2635205_2642025
&-um furthermore I I guess I'd just like to add there is a_lot_of research that shows that if you put someone in &-uh prison in one of these communities someone will take his place . 2642605_2651625
&-um you know why is that ? 2652445_2653785
<why is there> why is there a constant demand for people to to deal drugs in these communities ? 2654165_2658185
and &-um and I I think we need to look at contextual factors to determine that so . 2658245_2666545
&-um I just wanted to I was talking a little bit about treatment and sort_of the the risk of uncertain success and whether or not drug treatment is an effective strategy and &-um let me well let me first begin by saying that &~w there are some &~s it is uncertain whether or not the war on the drugs is an effective strategy as well . 2667165_2687285
&-uh the war on drugs like we've talked about before hasn't really decreased hasn't decreased drug use and has put a_lot_of people in prison . 2687505_2694125
we have certain racial impacts so I think that those are important to look at . 2694185_2698105
certain disenfranchisement of of a of one group proportionately and the second thing is that we do agree I guess concede that treatment in &~s a treatment is &~yo you know there's some &~cert some levels that make it effective some levels that don't make it effective I think we talked about some of those before . 2698405_2716565
the reason why treatment might be &{l=SIC uneffective &}l=SIC now is because one major reason might be its resource disparity . 2717065_2722025
that it receives so little of the funding and so little of the attention . 2722065_2725145
&-um and also might be the types of treatment and I guess in the question and answer we could get in more to that to the types of treatment . 2725885_2732145
that we do in in that we currently use in the status_quo and whether or not those are the most effective kinds . 2732725_2738365
but that that treatment is in many ways comparatively more effective than locking someone up like Jim said there's often you have someone else who will substitute to continue to commit that crime and you basically put a person who is addicted in to jail in an attempt to create a solution . 2738485_2758205
there's no treatment in jail or prison to stop that addiction . 2758625_2762065
and when their five year mandatory minimum runs out they'll have the same problem that they had they'll go back on the street with the same problem that maybe we need to be honest and realize that we need to address that problem . 2762085_2773265
and that locking up a bunch of people and putting them somewhere where we can't see them doesn't mean that they aren't addicts and don't have a problem that we could treat with other solutions . 2773805_2782125
and so although we concede yeah it's tough it is tough to do treatment it's it's way more difficult I think than locking people up and throwing away the key . 2782205_2790845
it is the solution to the problems that we have with drugs . 2791265_2795385
it is the only real effective solution . 2795505_2797385
⌊ do you wanna answer ⌋ ?
⌈ just one brief point ⌉ . 2799365_2801105
I think also that by &-um our focus isn't just on treatment in terms of cutting down the demand we're also Missy has a whole list of other things like education . 2801345_2811085
&-um things like &-um harm reduction strategies that are also part of what we're trying to push for in terms of shifting the balance between supply and demand side &-um where the focus is on that . 2812005_2824685

&-uh does the audience have any questions they want to ask either of the teams ? 3197585_3200165
yeah Harry ? 3201385_3201825
&-um I guess I would address this mostly to the JAIL group . 3201985_3205385
&-um and reflecting on a_lot_of what &-uh Tonery said about this being part of a a wider political situation . 3205865_3214285
why in the universe of things that you could address as a social policy issue in_order_to get at crime would you target crack ? 3215445_3223605
I read a statistic that eighty percent of the people who commit crimes are under the influence of alcohol by the legal standard . 3224305_3231885
&-um it seems to me that there's there's a_lot behind the fact that crack is singled out as something to be addressed that hasta do with demonizing poor minorities . 3232785_3244405
so could you react to that +..? 3245245_3247405
well you know I'll start I mean &-uh I mean alcohol is legal for starters . 3250465_3257685
so &-um I mean I I don't know that we could really target alcohol per_se . 3257665_3264105
&=laughs we could target crimes committed &-um in general and some percentage of those would be under the influence of alcohol but I don't know that that's really I think when we're looking at crack you need to compare it to other illegal drugs . 3264765_3276445
to compare apples to apples . 3276925_3277905
and when you do that &-um I mean even Tonery when he talks about the type of offenders who are sentenced &-um for crack offenses they have much more prior arrests they have much more they have a more violent history . 3278445_3293325
&-um they're in general they're more violent individuals . 3294185_3296545
&-um and you know I think that that's one kinda indicator that in fact you know there is more systemic violence associated with the crack trade . 3297265_3305545
&-uh there's more crime that arises out_of it . 3306285_3308185
&-um you know and like I say I I don't think that &-uh you_know methamphetamines <like I> like I was pointing out are the second &-uh most stringent mandatory minimum sentencing that's currently on the books and those are &-uh eighty four percent whites that are affected . 3309325_3326905
so I think they are very real issues but &-um I mean I I think that we can't you know ignore a very serious social problem simply because a large percentage of one part of the population is engaged in it . 3327705_3342565
I mean they talked about only fifteen percent of minorities use cocaine but eighty percent are arrested for cocaine offenses but I think the more revealing statistic would be what &-uh percentage of minorities are involved with trafficking cocaine . 3342605_3358085
I mean you can you know be involved with selling cocaine and not necessarily be using it . 3358545_3361885
and I think that the numbers bear out the fact that there yeah there unfortunately is a higher number of minorities who are involved with the crack trade . 3362265_3368305
&-um . 3369165_3369185
I wanna comment .
just going back to the +//. 3371635_3373375
how alcohol eighty percent of violence . 3373815_3376675
there are those who what was the statistic ? 3376955_3379535
I'm sorry . 3379775_3380075
eighty percent of those who commit crimes are beyond the legal limit for intoxication of alcohol . 3380495_3385475
okay . 3385935_3386195
&-um I think that just I think that that is a very serious the implications of that are very serious and that is a problem that needs to be addressed . 3386695_3395715
having said that I think that we also cannot ignore the problems associated with crack and the violence associated with it . 3396585_3405845
&-uh I read in one of the articles that &-um crack is associated with crime relating to its marketing and distribution more so than powder and it gives four reasons . 3406225_3415685
it because of competing dealers because of volatile dealing areas . 3416025_3419345
crack dealers are more likely to carry weapons and they're more likely to have an extensive record . 3420215_3425355
to have committed a_lot_of other crimes and a_lot_of other violent crimes . 3425815_3429135
it is a problem and just because alcohol is a problem doesn't mean that we should ignore crack . 3430755_3436075
we have to target both of them . 3436275_3437475
and alcohol is a legal substance that we are legally allowed to use . 3437815_3441015
because crack is illegal it contributes more to the crimes associated with the &-um I can't xxx at this point . 3441115_3450815
can we colloquy or ? 3451475_3454095
sure . 3454295_3454515
what I'd like to ask about <is the> is the +/. 3455015_3458815
⌊ especially xxx ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ fairness of it though ⌉ . 3459155_3459875
(be)cause it seems like we go off the Von Hirsch cliff of like getting into this black area where you trying to make one cause of a specific act more blame worthy than another . 3459845_3474165
and shouldn't we be focusing on the crimes and not the person ? 3474885_3478485
in_order_to be fair ? 3479625_3481065
or not just target the &~or I mean if more crimes are being done then that should be the standard . 3482025_3486545
and I don't think people would have an issue with fairness . 3486665_3488885
but if you're looking at what's causing people to do crimes and and ascribing it a a higher level of blame worthiness because they happen to be intoxicated with one form of substance as opposed to another I just don't buy it from the standpoint of fairness . 3489465_3506205
well &-um first of all like like I was saying before if you wanna look at simply the particular crimes being committed that's great for that individual crime . 3507365_3516765
you know that that's perfectly fair that's fantastic . 3517385_3520045
but the market as a whole the crack market has specific public health and violence and crime issues associated with it that aren't present in other markets . 3520345_3531405
we wanna squash the market . 3531505_3532425
we wanna make the opportunity cost of dealing crack so high that the market is not there anymore . 3532435_3537075
now that doesn't exist with any other drug at this point . 3537695_3541615
those sort_of &-uh you know the market factors &-uh that Holly mentioned that &-um you know have to do with its marketability you know the types of things that we talked about that certainly doesn't exist you know at the corner liquor store . 3541915_3556175
it doesn't exist in the powder cocaine trade it doesn't exist in the marijuana trade it doesn't exist in the heroin trade . 3556355_3560695
&-um and so you know maybe for each individual crime that approach's acceptable . 3561695_3566715
but there are other issues here that aren't addressed by that type of approach . 3566995_3571255
and you know I think that you know we ascribe more blame to cocaine because of the problems associated with its marketing . 3571915_3580175
with &~i associated with &-um its methods of distribution and that don't exist for other drugs . 3580555_3586515
and that's why I think it's justified . 3586675_3587915
I just wanna add one last thing and it's a quote from the US Sentencing Commission . 3588635_3592015
they say &{l=READING if a particular form of drug results in greater harms than a different form of that drug then logically a harsher penalty for the more harmful drug can be justified . 3592695_3601415
&}l=READING .
can I comment ? 3602795_3603395
sure . 3603895_3604215
&=laughs:multiple .
okay . 3604475_3604735
&-um &-uh well <I just wanna> &~com I just wanna just sort of talk a little bit about how that statute has been implemented . 3604825_3612785
I think that sort of well I'll just give you some statistics about how the statute's been implemented . 3612985_3617985
I think we sort_of talked about how if you have this really harsh penalty then that means you break down all the distribution networks for crack and that's not what's happened . 3618285_3625825
&-um only five percent of the people that we have arrested for crack are high level crack dealers . 3626305_3632945
people who are the high level crack dealers are smart and what they do is they have their young kids or they their mules &-um that's what that's just the term . 3633705_3640805
young kids people on the street corners carry the large amount of crack . 3641545_3645705
you're not punished &-uh under the law because you're punished for how much of it you have on your person . 3646065_3651465
and so you get your younger kids you have your women your low level dealers carrying all the crack . 3651585_3656425
they're the people who get busted for having fifty five or fifty grams of crack and that's why &-uh seventeen percent of people who are in federal prison for &~dr for drug offense related to cocaine had no prior violent history . 3656725_3670225
and fifty five percent are only low level relationship to the crack trade . 3670425_3674425
and that means that our laws &-uh it sounds nice but our laws we that people who deal crack have found a way to get around the laws . 3674785_3682645
and we don't have high level crack dealers in jail . 3682865_3685885
that's not what's happening whatsoever . 3686045_3687945
and so I I think that if we looked at severity if that was maybe part of something when we determine sentencing we might be able to target getting we might be able to target people who committed more severe offenses and get them in to &~ja jail and prison at a rate that made more sense than the people that we have currently behind bars for our crack offenses . 3688025_3707265

I <I'll just> I'll just say pretty briefly . 3715665_3717365
&-um common sense would dictate if you wanna solve a problem you have to find the the root cause of the problem . 3717765_3724045
&-um if we have if if crack is if crack is an epidemic in poor black communities you know why is that ? 3724905_3731625
what's the cause ? 3731745_3732405
is the cause that poor blacks are genetically predisposed to doing crack or that there's if they have some if there's some kind of moral deficiency ? 3732805_3740405
I mean <I would> I would argue that's not the case . 3740585_3742265
if if you eliminate those as the causes then you have to look at the environment . 3742985_3747365
something in the environment is causing poor blacks to engage in drug trafficking or &~e &~e &~e engage in in crack trafficking or use crack . 3747785_3756565
and if you really wanna solve the problem of crack since that's what it that's what the concern is then shouldn't we look at those factors ? 3756745_3763385
&-um actually Holly mentioned earlier when you &-uh were talking about children using drugs &-um that wouldn't it be better to have kids involved in positive things ? 3764625_3777065
that's one of the things that we're advocating by shifting towards &-um decreasing the demand . 3777125_3782285
we're advocating programs for children we're advocating educational programs alternatives to drug use like recreational programs after school more jobs for these high school age kids who &-um you are so concerned about being heavy drug users . 3782615_3797355
&-um if there are no objections I think we should take a quick break here . 3798635_3803135

John you got something ? 4534865_4535265
yeah &-uh I well I heard &-uh WEED &-um rattle off the statistic about ninety three percent of federal dollars are going toward supply side strategies while only seven percent are going towards demand side strategies . 4535465_4548985
and I agreed with &-uh Justin's contention about that that about the fact that you know &-um &~i it's very hard to prove kind of causal relationship &~b between &-um some of the prevention education and and &-uh treatment measures that would go with the demand side strategy and you know measurable &-uh measurable effects and and less drug use . 4549385_4574625
&-um but at the same time I didn't hear kind_of a an alternative proposal &-um from the JAIL side . 4575065_4581525

are you I guess <are you> are you proposing to keep kind_of a status_quo with a ninety three percent and a seven percent or are you completely giving up <even though> even though <you can't> you can't &-um you know measure you can't demonstrate a causal relationship &-uh for some &~dema demand side strategies . 4590285_4609065

do you want the ninety three seven kind of ratio to stand or what ? 4615145_4619065
I I'd like to respond to that actually &-uh the statistic that I was working from was a seventy thirty split . 4619245_4624745
okay . 4624965_4625225
+, that seventy percent was spent on law enforcement and personally I think that's a great split personally as a member of JAIL . 4625345_4632285
&=laughs:multiple think that that's a great split . 4632705_4633925
&-um that seventy percent on law enforcement does seem to be effective and thirty percent on education does seem to be targeting groups of children &-um that need this type of +/. 4634345_4645545
+, &-um okay .
+, educational treatment programs . 4646885_4647725
I'm just is <is there> is there a point at which you know you've been talking about the fact that we need the supply &~strid supply side strategies to get the people off the streets to get them in jail you know . 4647905_4657905
that crime crime has been going down because of &-uh &-um the sentencing policies that you guys are propounding and and stuff . 4658445_4665505
but is there a point at which that that funding will change ? 4665965_4668525
I mean there's only there are only so many people off the &~str I mean by your theory we will get all the people off the streets and that's our priority and we get the crack out_of people's hands . 4668665_4676865
but don't we hafta at some point change kind of funding priorities to prevention ? 4677325_4681405
you know once we've got these people off shouldn't there +//. 4681825_4684025
&~i is there going to be a change in the funding ? 4684525_4686365
is or is this going to stay seventy thirty or ? 4686465_4688945
I think part of the thirty does go to treatment . 4689305_4691425
but I also think that private organization should be the one to provide a_lot_of the treatment &-um I think that the &~ment mental health care industry in general in the United States today is a large chunk of it is privately funded . 4691585_4705565
and I think that corporations do a better job than the government of providing drug treatment . 4706065_4710525
yeah I'd like to say a couple things on that . 4711045_4712705
&-um &-uh for starters you know I'm not necessarily opposed to more treatment programs but I don't want to cut into the law enforcement budget . 4712985_4722845
I don't wanna lessen that I don't wanna lessen the penalties I think that's a a key component . 4723365_4727605
like <I don't> I don't I don't think it's right to keep the amount of funding for this &~progra this problem the same and shift some of it to treatment . 4727765_4734545
if you want +//. 4734865_4735245
you know I'm sure there's some environmental programs or something we can cut to give more treatment &=laughs:multiple <aw shucks> I'm just joking . 4735285_4745125
but I'm sure there's money in the budget for treatment issues . 4745325_4748125
if &-uh if we want to increase that budget as long as you don't cut into our funding that's fine . 4748865_4752645
&-um one other you know point that I would like to make just kind_of as an aside . 4753025_4757105
you know this team talked about how oh you locked somebody up they come out with the same problem nothing's changed . 4757545_4763725
I just wanna say that is not always the case . 4764185_4766265
and I can give &-uh one clear cut real world example and that's David Crosby . 4766725_4770765
went into &-uh prison &=laughs:multiple went into prison a crack head and a junkie and came out sober kicked kicked drugs cold turkey in prison . 4771485_4779965
so it does happen you know there are individuals who can use that time &-uh in prison to kick drugs . 4780105_4786585
I just wanna just make that point . 4786805_4788645
alright .
one point . 4790125_4791685
David Crosby &-uh . 4792565_4794685
Stills and Nash +/.
+, yeah Susan ? 4797465_4798205
I had a question about the fifty fifty split of resources . 4798385_4801385
now I think it was Missy who said that the one hundred and one ratio for crack and powder cocaine is is not backed up by studies it's an arbitrary number . 4802725_4809445
fifty fifty also seems to me kind of an arbitrary crowd pleasing number . 4810125_4813945
&-uh and I was wondering &~wh how do you arrive at it ? 4814725_4817125
and &-uh whether it really reflects how much it cost to do a treatment program versus how much it cost to to run an enforcement program . 4817305_4824245
oh well . 4824425_4824705
&~co the cost of doing a treatment program like the most expensive treatment programs that we have cost about sixty eight they range it ranges from eighteen hundred to sixty eight hundred dollars a year . 4825145_4833845
in contrast the cost of putting someone in prison for a year is about twenty five thousand dollars . 4834565_4837865
so I mean the cost is much less for a treatment program . 4838105_4841985
fifty fifty is that a_lot_of lot of some certain public policy institutes like the RAND corporation have done studies trying to look at a balanced approach . 4842305_4851185
and balanced get +//. 4851605_4852645
they used fifty fifty as the balance . 4852645_4854665
and that's sorta so where took the fifty fifty balanced idea . 4854865_4858265
I guess it is sort_of crowd pleasing (be)cause it's you know like even but and they tried to look at an &~id of an idea where you had treatment adequate amounts of treatment and some changes to treatment which I we really haven't talked about but some changes to treatment and &-uh had the law enforcement . 4858505_4873965
and then they did I mean a_lot_of what we're talking about does come from their studies about the cost and about the effectiveness and they concede you know some problems with the effectiveness but they think that it's a much much better solution than law enforcement . 4874005_4886345
so that's where we got fifty fifty . 4886765_4888125
but what does it mean if it doesn't mean that you said there's a high high price for putting somebody in jail as for your low price program . 4888245_4894245
it doesn't mean have ten programs for every person in jail so it's balanced out . 4894465_4897645
oh oh are you saying like does it mean fifty fifty in terms of dollars or does it mean fifty fifty in how far the dollars go ? 4897665_4903385
is that the question ? 4904025_4904685
I I'd like to know what it means <that's it> . 4904785_4905805
I mean &~i I think that fifty fifty means in terms of the money spent . 4905905_4908745
half the money is spent on treatment half the money is spent on law enforcement . 4909025_4913225
maybe the half that's spent on treatment goes a_lot farther . 4913825_4916385
&-uh you get more bang for your buck in that fifty than you get in the other fifty . 4917105_4920405
but it means a split of the the federal money . 4920905_4923825
they would spend half and half . 4924045_4924865
but how does that make sense given that law enforcement is so much more expensive than social programs ? 4925505_4930005
because I their argument is law enforcement doesn't law +//. 4930025_4933385
yeah it's more expensive law enforcement doesn't work and produces worse results so it's fine &~i I mean it's better to spend less money on it and you get more effective spending when you spend on decreasing the amount that people &-uh use when do prevention . 4933505_4947605
basically reducing the amount of people who would be involved in trade or in possession . 4947865_4951105
and I think that that's where they're coming from when they +... 4951565_4955325
I can speak to that a little bit as well . 4956895_4958495
a_lot_of the the mayors who have looked at addressing &-um sort_of drug problems within their own cities have looked at Baltimore as &-um good example of that . 4959175_4969315
have looked at increasing availability of drug treatment programs . 4969495_4973035
&-um the mayor of Baltimore argues that unless every person who &-um wants drug treatment has it available to them like on demand . 4973635_4982895
because &-um of the way that drugs cycle . 4983205_4986225
you may want drug treatment real bad when you're &~o in withdrawal but by the time you score your next hit you're not particularly interested in receiving treatment at that point . 4986585_4996225
unless it's available on demand for people that its ability to actually help people is much reduced . 4996705_5003765
and in_order_to make it available on demand for people there hasta be a huge increase in expenditure in that particular area . 5004345_5010805
(0.5) .
okay . 5015605_5015845
any more from the audience right now or Leslie did you have a question ? 5016385_5020685
yeah I have a question for JAIL . 5020705_5021625
I just want to know if if the &-um harsher penalties were meant to have like a deterrent effect in themselves . 5021685_5026965
(be)cause they mentioned deter people from using drugs people from selling drugs or both and how effective do you think that would be ? 5027445_5032285
&-um you mean the mandatory minimums ? 5035505_5038025
yeah +/.
+, whether they're supposed to have a deterrent effect ? 5038025_5039565
&-um you know I I my feeling is that they're supposed to have the same deterrent effect that all &-uh punishments have . 5040895_5050215
&-um I mean that all criminal justice &-um you know has in terms of knowing that if you get caught you know you're going to go to jail . 5050955_5060315
&-um I don't know that I I think the best deterrent is keeping the individuals who are locked up from committing crimes you know the incapacitation effect . 5060655_5069775
I mean because drugs are addictive &-uh I think the deterrent effect is negligible . 5070235_5075115
because you know if you're addicted to cocaine you're probably going to use it despite society telling you that it's not right and that you'll get locked up if you do so . 5075995_5085655
but I think the incapacitation effects of putting criminals away who would be dealing &-um putting users away who are addicted and maybe forcing them to examine their addiction &-um rather than being out on the street committing crimes to feed that addiction I think that's more of the you know that's the more effective part of the strategy . 5086295_5105855
not so much the deterrence +... 5106215_5107355
if I could follow up on that . 5108575_5112435
&-um the +... 5112875_5113655
&-uh we made you know a very strong argument that there is not much evidence that there has been any sort_of public safety benefit whether it's from deterrence or from incapacitation . 5117335_5126635
and you know though the person locked up &-uh can't commit a crime we all know that &-uh &-uh that somebody will take his or her place out in the world and and and cause the same level of mayhem that that that the person locked up would've caused . 5126935_5141675
&-um and so they've provided all this evidence that suggests that whatever the mechanisms that these public safety benefits aren't materializing . 5142135_5148515
that &-um if the risk had been higher the cost of &~coc of crack would've gone &-uh up but in fact it went down . 5149115_5155535
that if &-uh arrests stopped crime the streets would be +//. 5155975_5159175
you know we're arresting at you know at enormous rates and we would've cleared the streets of a_lot_of these dealers and that's doesn't seem to be happening . 5159355_5166095
&-um &-uh &-uh and you know and and you know Jim made some some points about you know your large argument about &-uh you_know about &-uh you_know that crime rates &-um have gone down as incapacitation has gone up isn't really valid because you know the gross national product hasn't gone up while the number of pet hamsters in Nevada has has gone up . 5166585_5184265
and so you know &=laughs:multiple that level of correlation doesn't doesn't quite work . 5184425_5187845
so I mean given all these you know it &-uh &-uh &-uh counterarguments to your public safety arguments I mean <where does that> where does that leave you ? 5188225_5194225
I mean does it still make sense to have these strong penalties if &~i &-uh I mean do you think that we're getting something from it and that these counterarguments are invalid or or ? 5194285_5203585
how would you respond to that ? 5203965_5204865
well &=laughs &-uh I I think we are getting something out_of it . 5207105_5211945
I think that &-um I mean I trying to think of how vast to structure this argument . 5212105_5216465
I I think that if you look at &-um +... 5221925_5224565
&=laughs &-uh well you know you can claim that the overall picture you know could be &-uh you_know that it's correlated with many things and and that there's not necessarily a causal relationship there . 5226045_5236865
&-um and that that may or may not be true . 5237745_5239725
but if again if you look at some get tough &-uh programs in certain areas of the country like New York City like the New York City subways you can kinda see it's you know some of the get tough programs it's hard to believe there's not some causal relationship there . 5239745_5252525
and <I would> &~s I would say that I believe there is at least some causal relationship on the national level . 5253145_5258125
although it's very difficult to prove because there's so many things going on . 5258505_5261545
and in addition I think that if you look at how dangerous this drug is and what a serious problem and the serious problems it causes . 5262225_5269105
you know I don't think that the right approach is simply to just sort of say well there's no &-uh you_know we should just give up . 5269785_5277085
you know this is a very serious problem these people are serious criminals they cause a_lot_of violence they cause a_lot_o(f) crime and yet you know since there's not a direct causal relationship that I can show on a national level over twenty years . 5277305_5288245
you know therefore we we shouldn't be &-uh locking (th)em up . 5289265_5292405
I mean I I think that you know they're committing serious crimes the drug itself is more dangerous than other drugs therefore these kind of penalties are justified . 5292585_5300265
mhm so even if they don't necessarily have public safety benefits that ⌊ these people have done wrong ⌋ . 5300625_5303785
⌈ I I would say I I believe ⌉ that there are some public safety benefits it's not directly provable . 5303785_5309825

&-um &~a as an aside the +//. 5317305_5319185
I don't know if anybody else noticed this but Tonery's argument he's the one who mentioned this thing about you know crack prices went down when they should've gone up if the drug was working . 5319845_5327145
but then later on he talks about for other reasons the proportion of the population that was using drugs went down . 5327765_5333705
well those for other reasons should also the cause the price of crack to go down . 5334465_5338725
and so even the drug war was increasing the price then that effect would not necessarily be that it would go up . 5338885_5343985

I think one of the criticisms of the drug war in general &-um by a_lot_of people who were against it in the public policy arena and and in the political arena is that the fact that there's first of all this that the causal relationship you know is kinda sketchy as far as if it's really if this is what's really &-um lowering crime rates or drug use . 5383555_5404475
but but also the fact that it doesn't look like there's any end in site . 5405015_5408355

it's going to be off the streets you know you're gonna stop when there's not one more gram of crack on the streets and and in kids' hands &-um but I'd kinda like to hear what your measures of its success are . 5430825_5443005
because I'm I'm I'm just I I think one of the criticisms is people think we're just gonna keep building prisons &-um keep locking people up until there are kinda no more prisons to be built and no more people to be locked up &-um I guess what's your response to that ? 5443265_5458765
I mean I guess that maybe that will keep happening for a while but it hasta peak at some point and then start going back down I think that our ultimate goal is we have decided as a society that drugs are illegal because they're bad drugs in general . 5460455_5476475

and until we either decide that drugs are not necessarily bad or that it's not an interest it's not important to society to prevent the use of them the drug war will continue . 5478075_5494175
and I guess that's a good thing . 5495615_5496735
because it will make our streets safer &-um it'll make our people healthier we'll have more . 5497735_5504095
well we can have I mean the society can think drugs are bad and we don't hafta fight a war on them . 5504765_5511125

&=laughs &-um okay good . 5549495_5550695
&-uh are there other questions from the audience I know I have some +... 5551475_5553655
&-um well I'll I'll while you're thinking I'll &-uh ask some of the questions that I had . 5555655_5560255
&-um I wanna ask a question of of WEED you make a_lot_of this &-um you know &=laughs &-uh you make a_lot_of this &-uh racial disparity argument . 5560515_5572455
that &-uh the drug war in particular the crack cocaine disparity has had a greater impact on on blacks than it has on whites &-um but &-uh as as you know Justin pointed out that's that's true of &~m &~methan I mean all all laws have some sort of disproportional impact that methamphetamines you know disproportionately affect whites . 5572705_5595845
&-uh if you look back at the you know racketeering statutes that were passed earlier in this century I mean they had a disproportionate impact on Sicilians . 5596455_5603035
why &~w why is it that the fact that a law has a disproportionate impact on some racial or ethnic group why does that invalidate the law ? 5604315_5611495
we know it's constitutional but &-um why why is that an argument to to repeal this law ? 5611675_5617035
I'm not clear on +... 5617175_5617915
&-uh well I guess I I . 5618435_5623175
you can I I thought that Ally might wanna +... 5624775_5626095
⌊ sorry ⌋ .
⌈ no if you ⌉ wanted to Jim ⌊ that's okay ⌋ . 5626535_5627715
⌈ oh no go ahead ⌉ . 5627715_5628375
&-um well I I think that part of the reason why it's questionable is that &-um we were talking before they mention that obviously drug &~u use of this drug doesn't occur just in the black community . 5628895_5641495
&-um whereas in the case of perhaps racketeering and Sicilians there was &-um a direct correlation . 5642255_5649055
I mean definitely the &~who the idea that &-um that a particular law can keep everyone from doing something like sure that's definitely constitutional . 5649235_5658575
and in theory the law is constitutional . 5658915_5661895
but in practice that's that's what we're concerned about is the way that it's actually &-um sort_of doled out . 5662135_5668255
and that that &~partic that is the part that's inequitable . 5668655_5671535
mhm .
did you wanna ⌊ <say anything> ⌋ ?
⌈ sure ⌉ &-um well I guess I'll go ahead and reveal myself as a flaming liberal &-um &=laughs:multiple basically I think the difference &-uh the fundamental difference is &-um when you compare the situations &~wh where Sicilians are unduly affected or whites are unduly affected because they you know perpetuate more of those crimes . 5675705_5695565
I think you have to ask yourself like &-um is this country in a situation where the different races you know traditionally have had equal status . 5696235_5704215
and I think no . 5704915_5705755
I think when you have a law that unduly affects a group that has been in you know a group that's been in power and has not been discriminated against I think it's different . 5705995_5714635
when you pass a law that affects a group that has been discriminated against and has maybe doesn't have the status or the resources because of this long history which continues to this present day . 5715115_5724715
&-um and so I think you to be aware of kinda the power differential between different groups . 5725735_5731215
&-um and and society needs to address that power differential and that status differential rather than look at the symptoms of that which might be crack trade in inner cities where there're &~n there are no jobs and where inner city residents suffer from discrimination &-um rather than addressing the crack trade looking at the sort_of the larger issue . 5732105_5750545
mhm mhm well that's a interesting argument but probably not very popular on the &~hal floors of Congress these days . 5751645_5757545
but &-um &-uh but one follow up to that . 5757865_5759825
&-um I mean you guys suggest I think it was Missy who in her talk suggested that you could capture some of these additional harms that you concede are associated with crack through the use of guidelines that say +"/. 5759865_5770025
+" you_know if the person who is dealing you_know either in coke or crack has &-uh you_know weapons on them or is &-uh involving &-uh youth in the distribution of their drugs or all the other you_know thirteen or so things that &-uh were in your list that you could make guidelines that would capture those harms and make larger sentences for them and not directly ask +"/.
+" you_know what form of cocaine are we talking about here ? 5790885_5792825
but those guidelines would still probably have this disproportionate racial impact so why would they be any more just than than &-uh than the straight differential between crack and cocaine . 5793065_5804005
well I think that that I was waiting for someone to say that &-um <I think that> &-uh I think that though that that underestimates the way that the sentencing laws are enforced now . 5804405_5814205
mhm +/.
+, &-uh because it's not that . 5814785_5816645
oh well this &~th xxx the assumption of that question is that sentencing laws are enforced fine now so that if you were to for instance target people who who carry a gun or have a firearm which more often happens in the crack trade than in the cocaine trade or use children which more &~ave often happens in crack than cocaine well then you just you'd replicate the same thing . 5817585_5834825
+, mhm +/.
+, but the I think the problem is that they're not being enforced correctly now you do have a_lot_of people who are nonviolent offenders . 5835025_5840665
you have a_lot_of people in for just the possession part +/. 5840825_5842805
+, mhm +/.
+, of the mandatory minimum which you know is just holding it . 5843345_5847105
&-uh you do have a_lot_of disparity in the enforcement the &~r initial arrest and the ones that get carry on to prosecution so I think that &-uh in &~som we're not saying just because you know you have there are some more people of a certain racial class arrested than people who are white then obviously there's a problem there's a mass disproportionality . 5847585_5869185
it exists in the enforcement and I think that our guidelines would make it better . 5869625_5872765
would they eliminate all racial would they eliminate it entirely ? 5872945_5876345
<I'm not> I'm not a hundred percent certain but I do think that taking I I don't know if they'd eliminate a hundred percent but &-uh taking into account that those levels disparities I really do think would make it much more just than the the way the mandatory minimums exist now . 5876625_5890345
mhm that's sure responsive . 5890705_5892585
other questions Harry ? 5893025_5895185
DiIulio points out that most of the crimes committed around the drug trade are committed against people &-um who are minorities . 5895965_5905845
so &-um how would particularly the WEED group balance the the &~bord the burden of enforcement which is disproportionate on these communities &-um with the need to &-um in_order_to be fair in terms of &~e equal protection of the laws to be there and to fight the crime so that economic &~demon development can come in ? 5906265_5927925
(0.5) .
well &-um I can speak to that a +/. 5932595_5934675
+, just to start off &-um that yes initially the black community was strongly in favor of disproportionate sentencing for crack offense as opposed to cocaine that's definitely true . 5935435_5946675
but as they've witnessed sort_of the impacts of &~disp disproportionate in sentencing a_lot_of very visible black leaders have sort_of switched sides and said okay is it really worth +//. 5947035_5956635
they're asking sort_of the same questions that we are is it really worth the tradeoff here in terms of damage to family structure in our community ? 5956605_5964365
&-um the fact that the second &~gen for the second generation &-um there's a huge proportion of black wage earning men being removed from our community are those costs worth you know sort_of +//. 5965125_5977685
I mean they're &~ma they're trying to balance that as well . 5978065_5980065
and so I think that &-um &~w I think we need respond to that community's what they're +//. 5980145_5986445
I agree with you . 5986685_5987145
we do need to respond to what they're asking for . 5987265_5989185
but I think now they are also asking the questions that we're asking +... 5989305_5992385
yeah I'd I'd just like to add to that I think that I think that if you ask members of these of &-um of these communities would you rather have us protect you by helicopters constantly flying over your neighborhood and a police person you know a police officer on every corner or would you rather have you know near your neighborhood and accessible to your neighborhood jobs that pay a living wage &-um and schools that aren't dilapidated and &-um +/. 5995715_6019375
<I thought the same> community +/.
+, &=laughs:SUm but I mean I think that you know this this argument that like if you +//. 6021705_6025325
because it's black on black crime if you don't wanna have these kinds of law enforcement you know procedures in these neighborhoods that you're not interested in in in protecting them is you know pretty disingenuous (be)cause I I think it assumes that's the only option that's the only means that you can protect an area like that . 6025985_6041005
I was gonna say the same thing . 6041125_6042085
it also kind_of assumes that treatment doesn't do anything to lessen those problems . 6042225_6045985
and I think that we think that it probably would . 6046265_6049085
I mean if you get have less addicts you &~d decrease the demand for drugs you do decrease the &~cri some of the crime and some of the problems involved with drugs and so I think that that I should tack that on . 6049405_6059625
beautiful .
&-um I gotta a couple points I wanted to talk lob over in your direction . 6060665_6065325
alright .
+, &=laughs &-um one is &-uh is just on the the issue of the the deterioration of neighborhoods . 6066045_6072785
I just wanna reiterate the point that &-um that basically inner city crime breeds poverty as well . 6072925_6079265
that you know it's not as though &-uh you_know those two exist completely separate in a vacuum so I think it's important to deal with the crime problem . 6079525_6085905
and also this idea that &-um that &-uh you know these enforcement strategies have no effect and I just actually wanted to cite &-uh James Q Wilson who looked at studies &-um that found a reduction a in heroin use among young blacks in Harlem . 6086225_6101965
&-uh and when the youths were asked why they stopped more than half answered quote trouble with the law or the high cost and the high cost is of_course &~res the result of the law enforcement . 6102565_6110285
so I think it's &-um you know I think there's some &~e you know evidence albeit perhaps anecdotally that that these kinds of types of strategies do work . 6110365_6118525
and finally &-um on the disproportionate &-uh level of drug use among blacks versus drug arrests , this is something that Tonery talks a little bit about . 6119085_6127585
he says that the arrest rates are out_of sync with the drug use and he cites &-uh I think several studies . 6127805_6133225
but in an earlier part of his his work he he talks about how the &-um I think it's the &-uh it's basically the percentage of male arrestees by race testing positive for any drug or cocaine . 6133385_6146865
and if you look at that it's clear that for both any drug and cocaine among blacks that are arrested there's a very high percentage as high as seventy percent in some cities like Houston &-uh generally hovering around forty five to fifty percent who test positive for these drugs . 6147195_6162775
so I &~thi and he makes the point that there is a small you know portion of the population that are hard core users that has not mirrored the national trends . 6162935_6170995
and I think these are the the people who are being affected by these laws . 6171075_6174815
so I think it's you know it's not accurate to say well these are racist laws because they don't mirror the actual drug use because when you look at there is a certain population that they do reflect the drug use accurately and then they're applied fairly in those cases so I kinda wonder how you would respond to those three . 6174915_6193435
do you guys wanna respond ?
okay .
well that that very well may be true but I think you can't make an argument that no whites use crack cocaine . 6196965_6204645
however &-um there has been no white person ever who's been convicted of a crack offense in Boston Denver Chicago LA Dallas Miami and numerous other cities . 6205445_6216845
&=laughs:SUm <how do you> how do you explain that discrepancy unless you say like there's absolutely no white use of crack cocaine which is clearly not true . 6217265_6224385
kinda kinda lob that one back to you . 6225715_6226715
hot potato &=laughs well I'm not from Boston LA &=laughs:multiple Houston or any of those cities so it's hard for me to speculate on law enforcement in those cities &-um you know if &-uh you know perhaps the &-uh the white market is different from the black market in those cities you know I I don't know . 6228535_6247155
&-um ⌊ yeah ⌋ . 6247835_6248355
⌈ just ⌉ because the law enforcement is not adequately doing its job +/. 6248375_6251175
right .
+, does not mean the laws instituted are bad or wrong . 6251355_6255515
well we I don't think that we originally said that the laws instituted were bad I mean clearly as you've already pointed out they've been declared constitutional . 6254285_6261325
again what we're concerned about is the way that they're implemented and we've said that previously and I think this is a clear example the the fact that there have been absolutely zero &-um convictions of whites for crack offenses in in any of +//. 6262305_6274805
those are major US cities +/. 6275045_6275945
yeah .
+, with huge populations . 6276125_6276985
&-um I think it does show a disparity in the way that those those laws are actually implemented . 6277505_6281685
and that's what we're majorly concerned about . 6281685_6283705
I think therefore we need to &=sound_effect step up our law enforcement and &=laughs:multiple and ⌊ work harder ⌋ &=laughs:multiple . 6284125_6288065
⌈ well the other thing is we're ⌉ like we've talked about our main concerns are with the crack market the violence it causes and I think the crack market in many cities are certainly concentrated in areas where it's not likely &-uh on a random sweep that you might find a high percentage of white &-uh people I mean they're mostly minority neighborhoods they're mostly poor . 6288065_6308025
so I think &-um yeah there's gonna be you know there's gonna you know it's gonna be hard to pinpoint &-uh where white people are getting crack in some cities but &-uh I think by targeting the market it's just it's gonna be a natural xxx . 6308145_6322365
yeah but I &~ki I kinda think two things about that I think first you have to look at the reason why you target why crack is targeted and if there is a motivation &~behi . 6322745_6332005
and obviously I mean the result when you target the crack market is that you target african americans with less money . 6332555_6337895
and there there might be something behind the original motivation behind why you decided to target . 6338255_6342855
you've kinda gotta examine that . 6343135_6344055
second thing is that I think that and you kinda I mentioned I think that &~cra that +//. 6344215_6348775
I don't know if I agree that the only segments of communities of of the african american community affected by the drug war are hard core drug users . 6350175_6358135
I don't know if that like that you just said a minute ago I don't if I agree with that . 6358045_6361205
I think that it's broader . 6361325_6362825
and I think it has affected I think it has affected a_lot_of lives that were people who weren't hard core crack users . 6363125_6369745
and I I just I I'm not sure that I a hundred percent agree that it's as targeted it's as direct as ⌊ go xxx ⌋ . 6370145_6376145
⌈ right ⌉ .
well well my response to that is how many people've been affected by the systemic violence associated with the crack trade ? 6376285_6380905
stray bullets that kills kids ? 6381025_6382265
how many people have been affected by the spread of HIV through high risk behavior ? 6382665_6386865
how many people have been affected because they've been you know crack babies and they haven't yet even &-uh they come into this world and they come in disadvantaged ? 6387185_6394545
I mean you know you're talking about the effects that &-uh take place you know presumably criminals and there families . 6394845_6401485
&-uh and you know that's certainly that's &~ce that's that's an issue and that's a problem but I think just as much of an issue are the effects that you know law abiding people in those communities have to face every day . 6401865_6412125
because of this you know this high systemic violence associated with the crack market . 6412465_6416625
yeah but I mean I do think I mean I think about fifteen minutes ago we talked we had a long discussion about black on black crime and how we think that that relates back to whether or not there should be whether or not that justifies the war on drugs . 6417645_6429545
I mean yeah there's there like I think that that Ally said there originally might have been a high level of support and that high level of support has really eroded after you know communities are really trying to balance a_lot_of these issues . 6429605_6441525
Leslie did you have a follow+up on this point ? 6442825_6444205
you had your hand up earlier . 6444365_6444825
I just I had wanted to say something about the quote that Justin read which I think is a little bit misleading in in portraying how many &-um that are arrests that actually use drugs and trade . 6444825_6454345
because a_lot_of dealers hafta like I guess like you were talking about earlier how they transform the powder into the rock cocaine . 6454365_6461285
and a_lot_of dealers that sell crack cocaine hafta go through that process . 6461385_6464625
and in that process &-um of I guess they call it cooking crack or whatever they do , &-um the potency of crack cocaine is that it gets into your system just as if you were using it . 6464765_6474065
but a_lot_of them don't actually use it . 6474285_6475625
it's just in their system because as a dealer or whatever they have to go through that process and that so I don't know <just get tested as kinda> . 6475705_6484205
mhm .
so that some of the people that &~s purportedly have it in them they weren't actually using it but it doesn't exactly paint a picture that they're not culpable I mean they were cooking it and &=laughs:multiple and that to me doesn't suggest that &=laughs but point taken . 6483105_6495785
&-um I I think this is a &~lit a little bit related to some of what we were just talking about . 6497125_6501525
I wanted to ask &-um JAIL a question they &-uh especially in in Jorge's &-uh talk he he described how you know as evidence of the idea that crack is more destructive than cocaine &-um you talked about how &-uh you know almost twice as many crack defendants versus cocaine defendants have criminal records . 6501325_6521585
&-um &-uh that they're more likely to already be under criminal justice sanctions that they're already say on probation when they're arrested for for crack . 6522305_6531405
&-um Justin had some similar points about how &-uh you know people who were arrested for crack are the most likely of of people arrested for any drug to have a criminal record . 6531925_6540545
but those things are already taken into account in the guidelines . 6541205_6543545
we already have an axis that says what is your criminal record . 6543805_6546625
&-um and we increase your your sanction if you have a criminal record . 6547145_6550585
why do we need to take it in account in effect a second time &-um in making this distinction between the mandatory minimum for crack versus cocaine ? 6550825_6558525
aren't we double counting in effect these these harms ? 6558805_6561665
(0.4) .
&-uh I well I don't think that +//. 6564325_6567525
&=laughs I think we already talked a little bit about this I don't think that that the sentencing guidelines address increased addictiveness &-um <they don't> &~incre they don't deal with &-uh the increased attraction due to cheap marketability &-um and they don't really have any effect on the market they only have effects on the certain individuals being +/. 6567975_6585435

so you might withdraw those other statements about why crack is more dangerous in favor of this more modest list . 6589355_6594595
well I I think it's certainly &-um I think it's more dangerous for all those reasons . 6595195_6600195

well &-um in terms of whether or not whether or not they're it's more addictive or etcetera etcetera . 6706525_6713085
I mean it what the Commission basically said was that there weren't very good pharmacological studies that could prove whether or not &-uh crack or cocaine was more addictive what you could prove was that crack has a more intense high even though cocaine had a high which lasted longer . 6712545_6728945
so shorter more intense crack longer lasting with cocaine they had really a_lot_of ran into a difficulties in sort_of determining well okay <what does> what does that mean ? 6729425_6738285
&-um in fact a in fact a_lot and throughout a_lot_of their recommendations they just kept finding they didn't have any studies to prove crack or cocaine were different for any of these things . 6738925_6748585
that there was no study that proved the difference between how much crime you commit with crack or cocaine no study that proved &~b big differences in death no study that proved that in in some some were so &~s ridiculous that they were finding like three studies across the entire country that looked at crack and cocaine and how much more crime you committed . 6748645_6766185
you know they they only had three that surveyed like seven hundred they had nothing to base these +//. 6766625_6770565
and I think that their feeling was a_lot_of this seems to thus be created on conjecture . 6771285_6775665
the idea that we think we have this gut feeling that crack is worse . 6775825_6780225

is there a basis for them ? 6788965_6789745
we should have a study about that . 6789745_6790625

well yeah we'll come back to that &=laughs:S2 in just a minute . 6860015_6861735
John ?
well it seems like that's that's a fair argument as far as sentencing policies for users . 6861915_6865955
&-um but as far as sentencing policies for sellers and guys who cook this stuff up I think the fact that I think Justin's and JAIL's point &-um &~i is pretty well taken the fact that &-um when you convert cocaine into crack form it's more easily &~accep accessible . 6866535_6883815
&~i it's easier to sell and &-um basically it's easier &~acces I &~i it's more easily accessible to &-uh poor people and and younger people . 6884435_6893735
and and I think that's that's a real problem and &~the that's a problem of prevention as well if we're talking about prevention . 6894095_6899415
&-um so what would you say about different sentencing policies as far as as far as &-um sellers go ? 6900355_6906655
&~we well I think that in those thirteen guidelines I didn't read them all . 6906915_6909435
but they are like some of them are like &~wer like they address those concerns who who was targeted I can even I can find them I don't know where they are but . 6909675_6919415
but I mean those would be different between &~coc you you would say that those should be different between cocaine and crack then right ? 6918895_6925195
I mean &~the they use &~y I mean it's since I mean my guess is since those are things that say would be that you determine to increase the severity and if those happen more like more readily in a crack trade then yeah it would cause a distinction between crack and cocaine . 6925615_6941095
okay +/.
+, &~d do you see what I'm saying ? 6941915_6942375
so there should be I mean there should be a difference between how we treat cocaine and crack as far as selling ⌊ and and preparing those but not using ⌋ . 6942455_6950855
⌈ as far as what happens in the individual crime but not ⌉ what what happens in the individual crimes with the aspects of an individual crime . 6950855_6955755
not just we should blanketly have a distinction between crack +/. 6956395_6959275
right +/.
+, and cocaine and it should be a hundred and one because we already have these ideas we have an idea what happens in every crack crime . 6959575_6966575
if that doesn't happen in every crack crime then we should look at the individual crime to determine if those things happen . 6966625_6970965
and maybe some of those things also happen in cocaine crimes that we haven't captured in the way that we have our mandatory minimums . 6971405_6976505
I just wanted to point out real quick that the the &~thirty thirty six states don't use the hundred to one ratio . 6977445_6982905
and don't necessarily apply the mandatory minimums and do &~a &~a allow discretion in their cases . 6983925_6990745
yeah <is that> is that the loophole thing that they they were talking talking about in the . 6991385_6994905
what we're debating here is all everybody understands this is all ⌊ federal ⌋ +/. 6994805_6997705
⌈ federal right ⌉ +/. 6997905_6998065
+, law and that &-uh there is a_lot_of discretion about which forum we try your . 6998065_7001005
&~w there's also and I mean I also know that in nineteen ninety four there was a federal they tried to institute a federal loophole . 7001165_7007625
to try to make to try to lessen . 7008085_7009665
although the only only I think it was something like thirty people have had their sentences lessened so that the loophole doesn't really get used ever . 7010305_7018385
&-um I I had one more &-uh question for JAIL and I wanna wrap up unless people have some burning questions . 7021115_7027075
I I don't think we've covered this one yet there was a discussion in &-uh the report by the Sentencing Commission of of what seemed to me a a pretty serious disparity and it was the disparity between &-um the sentence that the the the guy with the cocaine that distributes it to people who make crack what sentence that person gets versus what sentence all the people to whom he distributed . 7027375_7049535
and so you could have somebody who had four hundred grams of cocaine &-uh and distributed it to you know fifty different crack dealers and those crack dealers would all get five years in jail and the cocaine dealer would not because he hasn't reached that mandatory minimum . 7049795_7063815
doesn't this strike you as unequitable unjust ? 7064295_7066295
I mean that this is clearly where the the person high up on the distribution chain is getting off &-um and the people much closer to the street are not getting off just because by virtue of being <at the> &~l at the retail level they need to &-uh you_know they have to convert it into crack and so they have the harsher punishments . 7066535_7083335
⌊ that's right ⌋ +/.

well I'll I'll start us off I guess &-um you know I my my feeling on that is that the &~f the the distributor is high up on the powder cocaine tree . 7093775_7106715
whereas the retailers are &~a actually the people who've taken the extra &~tre step converted that cocaine into crack cocaine . 7107655_7115375
&-um they are the ones who took that step and are now selling and distributing a more dangerous drug +/. 7115805_7122125

⌈ were they &~b <were they> were they forced to ⌉ change that into &-uh crack cocaine they could have sold that on the street as powder cocaine . 7129265_7133165

the fact is they took the extra step +/. 7136045_7137925
mhm +/.
+, and and not you know it's not exactly a a step that's taken with an eye towards anything other than their own economic interests . 7138545_7145405

+, so you know I I think that you know they you know frankly they deserve it I mean they . 7149925_7155485
but couldn't you look at it the other way the the distributor with the cocaine did not take the step because they knew this issue of punishment they &~kn they they +//. 7155585_7164285
in their heads they are in the crack business but they're not gonna convert it into crack until the last minute &-uh because they know the punishments are more severe . 7163545_7171525
right .
if the other if the people who do convert it don't wanna get caught if they see that what the penalties are then they don't hafta they can wait . 7172305_7178865
they can buy it in powder form take it home to their kitchen add some baking soda some water and microwave it . 7179185_7184165

&=laughs:multiple I'd like to see how people who actually do believe this answer that question (be)cause it's a little bit boggling to me . 7220445_7225605
&-uh are there any many more burning questions or should we wrap up ? 7226045_7227805
I wanna get into a little bit of what happened to this report afterwards . 7227885_7230845
&-um unless people have other questions they wanna ask real quick . 7231205_7233525
&-um okay great . 7234065_7235805
that was very good and &~esp with you know a few exceptions about you know taking away from environmental &-uh policy for support . 7235925_7242665
&=laughs:multiple I the the what I liked about this the the realism factor that you both took moderate positions and you still took you know positions on your respective side but they were moderate enough to you couldn't you know have the out_of simply taking an extreme position that nobody really believes so &~i I think that was very good . 7243155_7258475
so &-um &-uh I wanna follow up on &-uh you know what &~happen we we read the nineteen ninety five I think it was released in February &-uh of ninety five the Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy Report that the Sentencing Commission had put out . 7259585_7274705
and that sort of had some vague recommendations that were along the lines of what &-um the WEED group was discussing . 7275905_7282905
&-um and the vague recommendation was we should reduce this disparity from a hundred to one to something less than that . 7283585_7290265
and we should &-uh try to take in +//. 7290965_7293185
&-uh would they concede that crack has more harms than cocaine but they argued that &-uh &-uh &-uh the guidelines could could account for the harms better . 7293385_7302345
and in fact I thought that the interesting argument was that mandatory minimums had been passed in eighty eight and then the guidelines came along +//. 7302585_7308165
I'm sorry the mandatory minimums in eighty six and then the guidelines came along in eighty eight and the guidelines actually counted things that were considered when the mandatory minimums were counted so that in effect you were punishing the same harm twice . 7308425_7319865
&-um so anyways they thought that it should go to a more or less a complete guideline system . 7320745_7325225
&-um although they were a little bit vague about how complete . 7325925_7328665
whether or not it should be hundred +//. 7328925_7329805
how how much less it should be should it be one to one should it be five to one or whatever &-um then in April a couple months after this thing came out &-uh the Sentencing Commission voted for a more specific recommendation and actually for a specific set of guidelines . 7330305_7345785
and they voted a split vote . 7346345_7348105
it was four to three for a one to one ratio . 7348245_7350665
&-um four people in favor of of one to one and four people or I'm sorry three people who thought it should be higher than one to one &-um and then it goes to the Congress and the Congress has until November if Congress does nothing that becomes law . 7351345_7364605
&-um Congress hasta affirmatively reject that &-um by November of that year and the &~pro President hasta sign Congress's bill and this had never happened before but the Congress did reject that recommendation they did reject the one to one ratio and the President on October thirty first signed the rejection so it that was in fact rejected . 7365265_7384465
and they told the Sentencing Commission to go back and revisit this &-um and to come up with <you know> &=laughs you know nice try come again basically . 7384745_7393605
&=laughs what do you think happened ? 7394365_7395045
I mean what do you think happened ? 7395285_7396105
then then they released another report which I have here any predictions on on how they came down on the second iteration of this report ? 7396285_7403565
⌊ &~wh ⌋ .
⌈ the ⌉ same way . 7406205_7406665
twenty to one ratio . 7407185_7408005
some kind of compromise +/. 7408165_7408825
yeah +/. 7408945_7409065
+, fifty to one +/. 7409305_7409905
+, yeah +/. 7410585_7410745
+, ten to one .
and &-uh what was especially interesting is they &-uh so they they &~tr wanted to raise the the &~leve the amount that would trigger a mandatory minimum for crack and so it was from now it's at five &-uh grams and it became their recommendation was between I think twenty five and seventy five grams . 7412185_7429445
and they lowered the amount for cocaine it's now at five hundred grams and they &~r they recommended that it be between I think a hundred and twenty five and two hundred and twenty five something like that . 7430245_7439865
so they brought the ratio closer together by both being softer on crack and being harder on cocaine to try to I guess diffuse that argument . 7440145_7448145
&-um . 7449445_7449525
was that the original approach as well ? 7451025_7452345
like when they their first proposal when they ⌊ proposed a one to one ⌋ ? 7452925_7456445
⌈ you mean in in &~s the ⌉ +/.
yeah .
+, yeah it it wasn't +//. 7457245_7458305
I I think they left it vague to be honest . 7458465_7460385
I mean I saw &-um a little bit about what they said in their actual amendment &-um in the one in April I talked about that the voted on and it seemed to me that they left it vague . 7460605_7469865
it just said a one to one and there must be more &-uh stuff that I haven't found that says exactly what they thought it should be but as far as I could tell <it was> it was a little bit vague . 7469985_7479125
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um but you know the problem seemed to be in that first I mean what are the political issues why do you think Congress rejected this ? 7480805_7488065
&=laughs I mean when they recommended one to one ? 7491355_7493055
if they accepted it they'd be soft on drugs . 7493855_7496015
yeah I mean it's a &=laughs it's a tough sell . 7497595_7499895
so it was once I mean once you have you know a a strong penalty it's very difficult to to go down from there &-um politically . 7500715_7508135
&-um &-uh so anyway I I mean I don't know it was all very interesting . 7509135_7514555
and the thing is so then in ninety seven that just put out another one of these reports that was sort_of a recommendation and not actually passing an amendment . 7514545_7522325
a recommendation for it to you know be changed to roughly these ratios . 7523025_7527045
&-um and as far as I can tell &-um and I actually asked a guy yesterday in the US Attorney's Office in Boston and I'll also ask him about Ally's question . 7528125_7535145
&=laughs why haven't they prosecuted any whites for crack ? 7536005_7538445
&-um you know what had happened to it and he wasn't sure either as far as we can tell &-um nothing has changed and they again they recommended &-um &-uh you_know this sort_of compromise solution . 7538925_7550205
and it apparently hasn't been implemented &-um and what happened with the Sentencing Commission is &-um and seems to have a_lot to do with this report it became very politicized . 7550925_7559965
&-um it's a seven member body and it gradually sort_of eroded and right now I think every position is vacant and if not every position there's like one or two people on it but they don't have a quorum so they can't work anymore . 7560485_7572905
there were a_couple_of years and I think that includes this April ninety seven when this came out it may have been a little bit after this where they only had four members which is the bare minimum you need and so everything they did hadta be unanimous or else it it it wouldn't apply . 7573025_7585205

and there's all this attempts at log rolling that just aren't working out because &-um &-uh you know it's a very crime policy is is a very political and emotional issue . 7598495_7608015

+, I don't if they'd ever +//. 7655475_7656155
that's a good question if they'd ever &-um even address the issue of &-um drug penalties before I don't know if anybody else here knows anything about it &-um but if you're interested in the second report it's very short it's not the monster this other one was . 7656165_7671045
&-um there's actually oh in this one I can't remember . 7671785_7677485
no it &~wa <it was a> it was a unanimous opinion recommending the compromise but there were sort_of concurring opinions so they sort_of disagreed about some of the rhetoric . 7677585_7684845
and and so there was this you know ten page opinion and five page concurring opinion and if you're interested in looking it up &-um the web page is &=writing:board &-um U S S C dot U S Sentencing Commission dot-gov@n and there's a little section called reports where you can look (th)em all up . 7684945_7709285
&-um and it also has some of the other background too like &-uh &-uh you know statements that were made to the Congress by a Sentencing Committee minutes of their meeting stuff like so it's sort_of an interesting little little archive of stuff . 7709825_7722245
&-um there were some things in readings that I wanted to cover but I guess we're close to out_of time and it probably doesn't make sense to start a new topic did anybody have any general thoughts on the subject and the readings or anything that you wanted to chat about for a_couple_of minutes or ? 7723305_7737305
I think most of it kinda came out in the discussion . 7740085_7742005
yeah I think . 7742765_7743125
&~a all the issues <that I> that I remembered from the reading . 7743825_7746365
okay .
I mean &~the &~ther there was I mean yeah the big you know the big issues hadta do with this idea of you know harm . 7748005_7757065
I mean the idea that cocaine has more harmful effects than than other drugs and +//. 7757325_7762365
I'm sorry crack does and that's why it's punished more severely but then the question is &-uh do are there other ways of getting at that that &-um you know that don't have all the other costs that we talked about . 7762465_7774645
yeah Justin ?
yeah just the one &~s reading that I thought were well the Body Count the stuff from body count . 7775545_7782225
like about how like everybody is going to prison or like really serious violent offenders who you know you've got those horror stories interspersed throughout I just thought it was it's interesting I wondered how (be)cause you know they talk about prior conviction sometimes they say specifically violent offenses but it's not always clear what the prior convictions were . 7782775_7800795
mhm mhm +/.
+, and I wondered +/. 7801475_7802035
+, yeah +/.
+, you know about &~s what some of them were I kinda questioned some of the figures but overall it was pretty you know it was kind_of a different +/. 7802935_7809255
+, yeah .
+, something I hadn't &~s seen or read in you know in a while . 7809915_7813055
yeah and &~h William Bennett you know who he is ? 7813255_7815495
do people know who William Bennett is ? 7815575_7817175
he was the he's very you know sort_of intellectual conservative figure who &-um was I guess education secretary under +/. 7817315_7825055
mhm +/.
+, &-uh Reagan +/. 7825895_7826235
+, mhm +/.
+, is that right ? 7826395_7826715
and then he became the drug czar for for Bush . 7826795_7829575
&-um and then he cowrote that with our friend John DiIulio and &-um some third guy that I don't know &=laughs . 7830115_7838055
&-um but yeah that was &-uh &-uh this has I mean this has been a theme for a &~b certain you know group of people that &-um as they put it there that you know when everybody says there's all these people in in in federal prison for drug offenses &-um that's misleading because &-uh the drug offenses simply as they put it they're latest &-uh grade in plea bargaining one oh one . 7837425_7860585
and that in fact the drug offense is an indicator of a torrid history of &-uh of of serious criminality . 7860935_7868055
and and so that these people are in fact culpable much more culpable than it looks like when you say oh they were in jail for a gram of crack but in fact they'd been you know a menace to society for years before that's their argument and the question is whether we believe it or not . 7868995_7884175
&-um yeah ⌊ Ally ⌋ .
wasn't wasn't that article significantly older than a_lot_of the other ones ? 7884575_7888635
I mean that was the thing that I sort_of questioned (be)cause it was like from nineteen seventy six . 7888915_7893075
oh no the Bennett one ? 7893655_7894455
yeah that ⌈ wasn't the <Bennett one> ⌉ . 7894735_7895195
⌊ no <that was> that was from the nineties ⌋ +/. 7895195_7896695

okay . 7897655_7897855
+, it was from the nineties yeah that was ninety five I think . 7898575_7899975
okay (be)cause ⌈ one of (th)em ⌉ . 7900055_7901055
⌊ and the other ⌋ the other thing about that is when they talk about releasing all these people early a_lot_of what I have read suggests anyway that we're having to release people early because of over crowding because +/. 7901475_7910915
mhm +/.
+, of like a_lot_of the types of offenders we're now admitting to +/. 7911315_7914195
+, right +/.
+, you know that are not maybe as dangerous as though who we're letting out so I I was sorta confused and I didn't how how much &~cre credence to give it basically . 7914175_7922835
yeah yeah I mean I thought they're I mean you know they make some some I mean they have a &-uh <I think a> &-uh I think a perspective that's important to think about but that they're a little sloppier than some of (th)em . 7924235_7935055
&-um I thought &-um like the you know the contradiction the main contradiction I saw in there is first they're saying how we're not punitive these days &-um and our evidence of this is that the ratio of &-uh people in &~priso people incarcerated to &-uh crimes committed is very very low . 7935175_7952115
&-um but then later on they go on to say how &-uh &-uh you know each criminal commits dozens of crimes well then the the the I mean you have to factor that into the ratio of crimes to criminal because crimes isn't the number isn't the relevant denominator . 7952775_7966435
the number of criminals is the relevant denominator and you have to divide the number of crimes by the rate of criminality so that I mean I'm being a little bit babbling here but I think you get the general sort_of point that they were a little bit inconsistent &-um &-uh in along that dimension but anyway . 7966475_7981675
but the argument that &-um you know people who are in jail for drugs are not in fact you know as they put it you know misplaced angels this has been a powerful and important argument in these debates so anyhow . 7982295_7993635
&-uh &~di did people like reading through the the the Sentencing Commission's stuff ? 7996115_8000155
&=laughs:SUm was that helpful ? 8000575_8001215
interesting +/.
+, yeah <I think> I think it focused this session even more directly just on that issue would be a good way to go but alright . 8001655_8008975
without further objections let's take off &-um . 8009395_8013175
I was gonna make a real quick announcement . 8013175_8014495

+, I was mentioning to Missy &-um they did this expose on kind of &-um well not really an expose . 8022245_8028265
but they they tracked six women in a central California federal prison &-um from I guess the time of about &-uh the last month of their imprisonment through kind of their release and &-um kind_of tracked how many of them what they did after they were released what kind of situation they were in and then how many of them went back . 8028585_8048725
&-um so a_lot_of recidivism &~is issues . 8049265_8051545
<it was> it was very interesting and +/. 8052465_8053865

mhm .
yeah I know I just I know that I taped something last Tuesday and I accidently ran the tape like through Nightline which was about like &~man minimums +/. 8072275_8081035
yeah +/.

so they might be doing a theme thing so keep your eyes open . 8086375_8088675
but it was a really very interesting (be)cause it kinda put a human face on all the stuff we're talking about . 8088915_8093055

xxx like when we were I was doing research to this last night . 8097875_8099995
there's this totally interesting website . 8099965_8101345
I don't know if any of you would be interested in it but I was . 8101545_8103245
and I don't remember the thing but I could email it to you guys but that was basically just every woman who's incarcerated in a federal prison for a drug offense . 8103405_8110985
it was like just a picture and sort_of a bio of like every single woman . 8111205_8114645
and I mean they were really fair like some of them were like +"/. 8114905_8116985

&=laughs you know like all these +//. 8119365_8119925

huh yeah interesting . 8130305_8131545
yeah I'll see if we can't &-um get a copy of those Nightlines . 8132065_8144045
&-um one quick announcement there is &-uh I passed around this just &-uh one sheet that has a &~sh a very short article that's a little more positive about rehabilitation for next week &-uh together with a table from something that was released that describes how much different regions of the country spend on &-uh treatment versus other things so pick a copy up . 8136185_8154985

yeah that's a &~ide (be)cause &-uh &~wi the stuff that we did on rehabilitation when it lumps everything together that's a little bit unfair to the drug treatment stuff because it tends to work better than the sort_of behavior xxx +/. 8301765_8310885

that's why you triggered it when you said special rights . 8430875_8432195

+, they do a_lot_of reintegrative shaming +/. 8457045_8458685

+, and so that's what I was originally looking at then I kind of stumbled on this issue and I thought it kind of incorporated a_lot_of our issues of sort_of our justice system +/. 8459345_8465045
+, mhm +/.

+, the status of a racial minority how heavily is that weighed ? 8474665_8477745
does that matter does that not matter is that different ? 8478005_8479965
+, mhm mhm +/.
+, and so I'm kind_of sort_of interesting in researching that's what I was kinda looking into . 8480605_8484745
yeah no that I mean <that sounds> that sounds good . 8484745_8486125
it could be I mean there's there's some big issues there about &-um you know the the how sovereign a nation an Indian nation really is +/. 8486165_8495065
right +/.
+, &-um as and and all that .
and and that is directly you know related to the criminal justice stuff in that there's some inequity stuff of if you know there's which form you wind up in can can determine which sentence you are . 8496325_8506245
and that's always that always troubles people although it's not very different from what we were talking about today whether you end up in state court or federal court and is it a good predictor of what your sentence is like for drugs . 8506245_8516585
yeah .
except for I think that yeah it's &~pro I just think that there's a_lot_of there's huge fear +/. 8516725_8522205

so that would be interesting and to frame it the way you framed it at the beginning . 8531635_8534855
yeah that's what I &~wa +/.
+, <is it> is it a good idea to do it one way or the other is is I think exactly the right way to go about it . 8535295_8540175
right because I know that they like in in like South Dakota and Florida they've done it like two different ways and I actually +/. 8540375_8546415
mhm +/.

&=laughs you know and like upheld both of them at the same time as like being a model . 8553795_8556955
so I was just sort of interested in seeing like what I would think +/. 8556945_8560245
+, mhm +/.
+, about kinda like reading through and figuring out . 8561185_8562305
nah <that sounds> that sounds really good that sounds really interesting just do it as a you know what do you think what is the right way to go about it . 8562785_8567845
it it's ⌊ what you wanna do ⌋ . 8568005_8568145
⌈ yeah trying to ⌉ you know how +//. 8568145_8569925

&-uh it could matter I don't know you know and I don't know who the people are who are getting arrested xxx . 8584145_8587845
yeah I guess the hard thing will be to to separate out the specifically criminal justice issues from the much more anticriminal issues of of the sovereignty you know sovereignty of the xxx nation &-um but I don't mean don't don't go into them and xxx and then it gets interesting xxx xxx . 8616085_8633745
