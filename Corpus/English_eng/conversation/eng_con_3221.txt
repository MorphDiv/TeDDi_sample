&=mumble
so what did you did you learn trying that↗ 31187_32947
h:uh↗ 32947_33668
what did you learn trying that stuff↗ 33668_35299
different light → 35299_36579
if we have different colors (0.5) 36579_38149
it's a different color→ 42501_43637
it gets darker each time→ 44220_47166
blue sky 52077_52997
because it says, why is the sky blue↗ 55478_57192
it's because of this &=point:polarizer 57192_59279
And and what's &~th 59962_61232
the sky 65288_65980
because, I mean 67850_69195
okay → 72342_73098
excuse me→ 73098_74010
it does↗ 74010_74698
yeah::→ 74698_75179
I am not → 75179_76226
°I am that's° → 76226_76802
that's why that's why the sky is blue → 76802_77964
because the water (1.0) 77964_79038
I think it's, ugh:: → 80268_81405
from the ozone °layer or something°→ 82630_83902
it's the water (1.0) 84733_85493
°mmh° → 85493_86148
I'm telling you it's the water→ 87359_87910
°I am° → 87910_88542
It's +/. 88542_89033
+^ it's all the chemicals in the sky that makes 89033_90148
⌊well, actually⌋ actually, actually, °actually, I mean° → 90860_92812
what what makes the sky blue↗ 92812_94105
what makes it what makes it blue↗ 94553_96502
oh, we were just ⌈talking about that⌉ hhh→ 97068_98673
⌊we were just talking about that⌋→ 98673_99450
the water→ 99450_99712
this is imagine this is the earth's atmosphere → 100466_102252
and we used lemon flavored jello 103027_104315
Here is the sun, here is the earth→ 109355_110796
If you put these ↑polarizers↓ in front of the light→ 111659_113483
Can you see the blue light here↗ 113740_116556
Yeah→ 116556_117043
And what do you see down here↗ 117043_118388
°Clearish° ↗ 119797_120523
°Orange°→ 120523_120916
Clearish↗ 120916_121130
it's kind of a yellow↗ 121130_121880
The energy that comes from the sun 122636_124938
Red, yellow, orange, green, blue→ 128489_131129
they are all there→ 131129_131791
And the ∇blue light∇ that comes down to us 132633_134785
it's oscillating faster than any of the other types of light→ 135938_138762
red is the slowest→ 138762_139875
so blue is kind of like this and red is like this 139875_142311
You ⌈see (1.5) yeah::⌉ → 143007_143809
⌊I thought, I thought ⌋ 143809_145165
°How does it the sky turn blue:::°↗ 147404_147764
well when We're still going→ (1.0) 147764_148984
So when they, when they hit, 148984_150538
And we see it 158493_159474
Now you see the red light on occasions → 165194_167657
when if you have the ocean and the beach→ 168804_170411
that's like °when we get dust°→ 170746_171489
way off in the distance → 171489_172027
even if- 172428_173138
because there is so much atmosphere between you and the sun→ 173475_175041
eventually that red light starts to get scattered into 175754_177913
That's like ⌈when we⌉ get dust↗ 179963_181483
⌊or red:⌋→ 181483_182140
⌈°Yes::°⌉→ 182140_182960
⌊What I thought⌋ what I thought 182960_184023
∇and that's why the sky °was blue°∇ → 186160_187097
the water reflected → 187097_189112
°on the ocean° → 189112_190536
the light↗ 190536_191622
yeah 191622_192150
⌈°The ocean water reflected°⌉→ 192545_193264
⌊&=mumble⌋→ 193264_193576
Well, the ocean reflecting on the sky ⌈up high⌉ → 194136_195658
⌊But what⌋ What, what, ⌈what reflects it⌉↗ 195658_197247
⌊and makes the sky⌋ °blue°→ 197247_197966
°What reflects it° ↗ 197966_198746
Well, it's the sunlight→ 199802_200521
usually you were saying the sunlight was 200521_202071
⌊yeah::⌋→ 202534_202914
bouncing up into the sky↗ 202914_203439
Yeah→ 203439_203912
Hhh, wow that makes that's a good assumption→ 204519_205859
But what we found out is that it starts way:: before that→ 206531_209370
before the sun even 209370_210297
All right↑→ 214899_215187
Can I take you guys down to see the super computer↗ 216497_218729
