good morning, class . 0_16128
good morning Mister Leung . 16128_19158
okay . 19158_19541
hello, hello, hello . 19541_28421
okay uh, boys and girls uh, for today, we are going to discuss a topic, okay ? 28421_33548
uh +... 33548_33908
polygon . 33908_34775
&=writes polygon . 34775_40510
okay ? 40510_41015
uh, for last Friday, I have asked you to prepare for this topic, have you read over this chapter ? 41015_48668
yes . 48668_49270
yes, okay . 49270_50276
uh, I try to ask some someone to tell me what what you have, uh, read over for the, uh last weekend . 50276_58078
okay, close all your textbook . 58078_59485
okay, uh, first of all, you know what what I am now going to do ? 59485_66596
okay, try to draw some diagram, what you have read from, uh, one point, uh, four . 66596_73973
okay ? 73973_74981
thirty three . 74981_78571
yeah . 78571_80178
okay, very good . 80178_91628
uh, this kind of the, uh, polygon we call a &~con a convex polygon, okay ? 91628_100980
it is, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, we call it a convex hexagon . 100980_107548
I use the number to present that it is six sided . 107548_113723
the polygon is six sided . 113723_115096
okay . 115096_115755
and I want another boy or girl to come up to draw another type of +... 115755_121345
polygon . 121345_122538
okay, another type . 122538_126571
seventeen . 126571_128418
seventeen ? 128418_130091
okay . 130091_130770
you draw the diagrams only . 130770_136176
yes . 136176_137755
ha ha . 137755_139898
you you you you draw it here, okay . 139898_143281
I I I I I want you to draw &~an another type of polygon . 143281_149785
uh, okay, thank you . 149785_154730
for uh, how many sides ? 154730_158833
five . 158833_159423
five sides, it is, we call +... 159423_160783
do do you know the name of this, uh, polygon ? 160783_164223
you forget it ? 164223_166455
okay, it is a pentagon . 166455_168031
it is a pentagon . 168031_169041
I I want you to draw another type of polygon another property . 169041_174510
okay ? 174510_175003
uh, for for these two types, they are the same . 175003_177828
we we call them convex . 177828_178758
okay, convex . 178758_179780
I I I want you to draw another type, do you know another type ? 179780_183093
I I don't know whether you you know or not . 183093_184883
uh, another one . 184883_188963
thirty five . 188963_189793
who's thirty five ? 189793_191480
yeah . 191480_192455
you try . 192455_196055
an an anyone you like . 196055_211263
okay, okay, thank you . 211263_219535
uh, do you find that such kind of a polygon is different from these two ? 219535_226078
okay ? 226078_226781
we call this one +... 226781_227836
a concave polygon . 227836_231916
concave . 231916_232996
and at the same time, how many sides for this polygon ? 232996_236285
one, two, three, four, five . 236285_240180
do you still remember what to call this kind of polygon ? 240180_244188
you have five sides, you pentagon . 244188_249051
how to spell pentagon ? 249051_249971
p@l e@l n@l t@l a@l g@l o@l n@l . 249971_255246
p@l e@l n@l t@l a@l g@l o@l n@l . 255246_256165
okay, we read it together . 256165_256940
pentagon . 256940_257723
pentagon . 257723_258548
okay . 258548_259051
I do you find that +... 259051_260603
uh, for this one we call that convex convex polygon, this type we call concave polygon . 260603_267525
do you find that what is the characteristic between them ? 267525_272355
what is the difference between them ? 272355_274026
okay ? 274026_275115
I'll give you, uh uh one minute to discuss with your neighbor . 275115_278025
okay ? 278025_278675
can you tell me the difference between these two kind of polygons ? 278675_281738
can you tell me the difference between them ? 281738_301250
okay . 301250_308305
anybody try to tell me the difference between them ? 308305_314435
anybody ? 314435_318145
anybody try ? 318145_319175
okay . 319175_322160
twenty six . 322160_326455
who is twenty six ? 326455_329503
yes . 329503_330168
uh, you can come out and draw anything you like to to tell me your your your result . 330168_335480
yes . 335480_336951
xxx . 336951_338391
what is the difference between the convex polygon and concave polygon ? 338391_341760
yes . 341760_343136
come up here yes . 343136_345303
huh ? 345303_351078
what does it mean ? 351078_352536
yes, okay . 352536_358368
xxx . 358368_361053
uh, your neighbor . 361053_361768
you you should help him because you discussed it together . 361768_365910
can you come out ? 365910_367645
what what what ? 367645_372310
yes, yes . 372310_373340
what what does it mean ? 373340_379908
what does it mean ? 379908_382836
what does it mean ? 382836_383748
uh, more than one hundred and eighty degrees . 383748_388003
more more than one hundred and eighty degrees degrees ? 388003_390276
yes . 390276_390723
okay, that means uh, this angle is more than one hundred and eighty degrees ? 390723_394005
yes . 394005_394516
how how about this polygon ? 394516_399151
can we find any angles more than one hundred and eighty degrees ? 399151_402503
no . 402503_402856
no . 402856_403341
okay, can can you get the meaning of of of your thank you, thank you, your your classmate say ? 403341_410335
yeah . 410335_411606
okay, what are the differences between convex polygon and concave polygon ? 411606_416128
we look at the concave polygon . 416128_417886
at least at least one or more of the interior angles is greater than one hundred and eighty degrees . 417886_427055
we call this concave polygon . 427055_429260
understand ? 429260_430125
but in this chapter, we don't discuss the concave polygon, we just only discuss the convex polygon . 430125_435660
okay ? 435660_436523
another thing, you have learned in Form One . 436523_439868
you have learned in Form One, these two words . 439868_442396
sorry . 442396_446748
it is uh, uh, you have learned it in Form One . 446748_449445
it is the equilateral polygon . 449445_454996
and also equiangular polygon . 454996_462141
what are they ? 462141_464621
what is meant by equiangular polygon ? 464621_467645
and what is meant by equilateral polygon ? 467645_471175
okay, first of all, do you still remember equiangular polygon ? 471175_476205
what is meant by equiangular polygon ? 476205_478731
that means okay, I I I I I give you some time to think . 478731_485863
what does it mean by &~equilat equilateral tri polygon ? 485863_488530
equiangular polygon ? 488530_490685
do you still remember it ? 490685_493031
yes . 493031_493951
yes . 493951_494608
what does it mean ? 494608_495195
for for for the first type . 495195_496475
I'll give you some hints . 496475_499738
all the sides ? 499738_501576
are equal . 501576_502185
all the sides are equal . 502185_502993
okay ? 502993_503951
all the sides of the polygons are equal . 503951_506410
how about equiangular polygon ? 506410_508473
xxx . 508473_509730
all the sizes of the angle ? 509730_511761
are equal . 511761_512353
equal . 512353_512753
get it ? 512753_513881
okay, I want you to try to help me to try to draw two types of polygon . 513881_520768
they are four sided and five sided polygons . 520768_526438
that is, equilateral but it is not equiangular . 526438_535598
and it is equiangular and it is not equilateral . 535598_541025
okay, you try take out, uh clas your classwork exercise book +... 541025_544818
to try to draw . 544818_546073
and then I will ask you to come out and help me to draw the four sided polygon . 546073_553800
it is equilateral but it is not equiangular . 553800_557925
another four sided polygon, it is equiangular . 557925_566513
