you won't be given like if we're just talking, of course, I'm not going to say write down, but +... 0_5331
you'll be given expressions and asked to evaluate for a certain amount of money or numbers . 5331_10428
so I'm going to give you an example . 10428_25163
here's what you were asking me Jen . 25163_26665
evaluate the expression, four h@l plus three . 26665_30138
now the part four h@l plus three is the expression and then it says for h@l equals two . 30138_36568
what are we going to do with that ? 36568_37521
what are we going to do with h@l equals two ? 37521_41925
Marcus ? 41925_44348
I guess like four times two . 44348_47535
four times two plus three, <would be eleven> . 47535_50000
<good> . 50000_51213
okay . 51213_51845
what we Marcus did here was, wherever he saw an h@l in our expression he substituted a two . 51845_60750
so that was the first step . 60750_63956
and remember, if there is nothing in between a number and parenthesis what operation do we do ? 63956_72195
multiplication . 72195_73346
Patrick ? 73346_73730
multiplication . 73730_74258
good . 74258_74841
and as Marcus said then, the answer is eight because four I mean eleven four times two is eight, we add three, and we get eleven . 74841_83610
any questions so far ? 83610_105683
okay . 105683_123658
now, I'm sure you often hear, probably on radio ads or or maybe even here at school . 123658_133465
phrases such as twice as much, three times as long, half as heavy . 133465_142125
yes ? 142125_142893
so my answer to the question is, four times two is eight, plus three is +... 142893_149238
is eleven . 149238_149670
all right . 149670_150213
okay ? 150213_150636
so you hear phrases like that . 150636_153468
twice as much . 153468_154541
you hear that at the store, right ? 154541_155915
or, things like that . 155915_157876
three times as long . 157876_159708
social studies class is three times as long as math . 159708_164741
it is ? 164741_165790
because math class is fun, Tim . 165790_168430
oh, no . 168430_169255
oh, I get it . 169255_170636
I just like math . 170636_172221
no, it's not really three times as long . 172221_174385
they're all the same, but that was just an +... 174385_176221
I thought fifth period was the longest ? 176221_178371
yeah . 178371_178701
okay . 178701_179083
well we have an extra ten minutes because we read, but that's all . 179083_182220
okay . 182220_183228
what we're doing there, is we're taking words and translating them into variable expressions . 183228_193188
now, there's two parts to that . 193188_196475
taking words and putting them into numbers or the opposite . 196475_201583
so people, if you're sitting at your desk taking notes, write the opposite . 201583_206308
you don't have to write both of those things up there . 206308_207728
as long as you understand . 207728_209320
remember, you don't have to write everything I write . 209320_210681
take words, change them into numbers . 210681_214528
take numbers and change them into words . 214528_217193
you can do one of those ? 217193_220441
yeah, and then just write either opposite or vice versa . 220441_224313
I'm gonna give you an some examples . 224313_234475
wait +... 234475_259560
okay . 259560_260341
say I give you the words, a number plus negative three . 260341_269356
how would I take those words from a word phrase +... 269356_274468
now this example is on page one_o_six, people, so you have your choice here . 274468_278421
how do I take the words, a number plus negative three and make it a variable expression ? 278421_285845
Patrick ? 285845_287803
a plus negative three . 287803_289180
okay . 289180_290045
a plus negative three . 290045_291386
you chose a@l . 291386_292530
I chose n@l . 292530_293273
again, the letter doesn't matter . 293273_295156
so we took a word phrase and changed it from words to a variable expression . 295156_306033
I'm going to give you another yes ? 306033_309001
why'd you put the parenthesis around negative three ? 309001_311595
good question . 311595_312140
why'd I put these here ? 312140_313673
only because you don't get mixed up with the signs . 313673_316761
if I put +... 316761_318816
oh . 318816_319130
okay ? 319130_319991
I don't that's why I do it that way . 319991_321871
Andrea ? 321871_323250
do you have to put it down there ? 323250_324496
you don't have to but I think it's it makes it clearer to see . 324496_329341
okay ? 329341_330265
tim ? 330265_330853
would it make a difference if we put it around n@l plus or not ? 330853_335575
well, in this case, we have two operation signs technically, so that's why we I did it here . 335575_341836
Marcus ? 341836_343150
what if you switched it around xxx negative three before ? 343150_346325
before n@l ? 346325_347518
yeah . 347518_347925
that would work okay . 347925_348748
but it's but It's backwards here from what the words are . 348748_352701
oh . 352701_353203
technically in math that's not incorrect . 353203_354998
yes ? 354998_356346
so a number means like you put a letter ? 356346_359578
yes . 359578_360611
that's the variable part of it . 360611_362810
any letter . 362810_363645
so that means oh . 363645_364948
okay, what if I say six less than a number . 364948_372941
six less than a number . 372941_377285
Michelle ? 377285_377860
six minus n@l . 377860_379748
six minus n@l . 379748_381420
what do you think Aubrey ? 381420_382566
n@l minus six . 382566_383785
why do you think that ? 383785_385026
oh because +/. 385026_386865
you're right . 386865_387170
tell me why . 387170_387696
six is less than the number ? 387696_390096
right . 390096_390705
do you see the difference ? 390705_391648
six less than a number . 391648_393490
oh . 393490_393911
yours was a number less than six . 393911_396903
what you gave me . 396903_398526
this will that's the tricky saying right there . 398526_400785
questions so far ? 400785_403881
Alex ? 403881_410351
so then when it says +"/. 410351_411263
+" less than in, like, a question, you always minus the number from the letter ? 411263_415873
like go, the letter minus the number ? 415873_419086
I hate when I say always, Alex . 419086_422036
uh, nine times out of ten, yes, but there may be like something else here . 422036_427536
like may it may say two plus a number then less than . 427536_434270
so you've got to be careful . 434270_435401
it's not always . 435401_436135
okay . 436135_436935
yes ? 436935_437415
who did do you have to put the parenthesis around the minus six or would that be considered a negative six ? 437415_443966
well in here there's not another sign so it doesn't matter here . 443966_449101
well, we're going to learn next week that it's negative this also does mean minus . 449101_454845
but we don't need to put parenthesis here because there's not another sign, okay ? 454845_459181
all right . 459181_460980
now, we're going to do it the other way . 460980_463011
we're going to start with a variable expression and go to words . 463011_466148
start with the variable and go to words . 466148_470620
so I'm going to give you this time yes ? 470620_475211
is this in the book too xxx ? 475211_477235
yeah . 477235_477546
this is still all page one_o_six . 477546_478921
k@l divided by eight . 478921_481688
try to write that in words without using the word divided . 481688_486113
can anybody do that ? 486113_487828
Jen ? 487828_488913
k@l over eight . 488913_490113
okay . 490113_490601
that's Steve ? 490601_491475
k@l into eight . 491475_492551
okay . 492551_493280
well no . 493280_493946
that would be eight into k@l . 493946_495225
oh . 495225_495616
Christy ? 495616_496888
k@l of eight . 496888_497658
no . 497658_499343
what does of mean in that ? 499343_500850
oh . 500850_501218
times . 501218_502745
okay ? 502745_503258
it's okay, you're thinking . 503258_504610
all of those what Jen and Steve were correct, I chose the big math word, quotient . 504610_511481
k@l divided by eight, the quotient of the number and eight . 511481_515860
what if I gave you fifteen minus b@l ? 515860_521875
fifteen minus b@l . 521875_524088
Patrick ? 524088_526153
fifteen less than b@l . 526153_527861
or less b@l less than fifteen . 527861_531471
b@l less than fifteen would work . 531471_533001
I chose an easier route . 533001_535143
fifteen minus a number . 535143_536983
either one is correct . 536983_540063
questions so far on this, people ? 540063_544031
any questions ? 544031_549615
Andrea ? 549615_555028
what does quotient mean ? 555028_556061
quotient means divided . 556061_557823
see my my sign up there in the corner has all the math words . 557823_561326
okay . 561326_563101
okay . 563101_564835
the last thing then, variable expressions with more . 564835_567858
