Well, the exercise of lectures is not in limbo, it's only that I
I think you'd get, then, much more of a feel for how you might go
Before I get into that, let me just review quickly what I want to
I want to be going through a hell of a lot of stuff on what I'm
But before we get into that, I'll be glad to entertain any
I'm not talking, yeah I'm talking now about this article . 136154_180674
Is there anyone are there any questions around any remark or
Okay, can I assume then that we'll take it up as we then come to
In the lectures article, there's a long discussion of what there
Particularly, the thing that makes of lectures, that poses for
In that section in the lectures paper, it's being discussed as what
I'm simply doing a sketch of that very quickly because I'll assume
Let me then go through it however very quickly just by way of
The idea that ethnomethodological studies could be, could have an
That the idea that there would have been something completely and
That is Sacks' observation . 337459_369894
The observation is made or was pointed out as a curiosity, he
The curiosity was motivated by the accumulation of the findings of
That is, the thing that the conversational analyst's were finding
He specified it in conversations with me, in something like the
It's not encountered by seeking out favorite instructors or
Okay, By normally thoughtless, I mean that there are available
And together with the sensible appearances of the things, they're
so we'll call that the availability of these, the omnipresence of
The list is a familiar one, it's repeated in many places now:
Those you can hear then as accountable organizations of ordinary
So, that's the first notable, a first thing that's observed . 563235_575105
A second thing observed is that along with these accountable
it's not that there a huge number, Manny Schegloff likes to speak
I mean, you'd have to think of an insane multiplier . 607075_611364
So that of these insanely endlessly many inquiries .
You lose your keys, there is now a search, right, in the house . 611364_639308
And in, of and as the search is the question: where could they be ?
You're in traffic, the traffic ahead stops .
You slow down, you stop .
You're sitting there for awhile, after awhile it begins again .
As you begin to accelerate, you begin searching ahead: What was
I think that's enough to make the point . 666373_673222
Now, of those endlessly many, those insanely many inquiries, there
And by a technical phenomenon, I mean it's available to the parties
They know the how of it as a something to get done in, of and as
The driver who searches the traffic ahead or the places to the side
But instead, he's undertaking it in the same way that he's party to
Another way of saying it is, the competency of the inquiry is a
A vulgar competence means no credentials are offered or even
When he undertakes the inquiry, he's already in the midst of the
Now then, those are the two big observables .
Then Sacks put them together in the third thing that makes it one
He points out that both of these taken together compose in
And that phenomenon could be spoken of then as a prevailing,
That is, the relevance of that “of” the occasioned, embodied,
Now that phenomenon we'll understand is, for ethnomethodology, the
It's its great pre-occupation . 927443_935240
It's, as Sacks would say, criterial . 935240_939629
There's further to say of it, that it's not to be imagined, since
To say it is a discoverable is perhaps a verification of existence,
Now I'm going to refer to that phenomenon as the missing what, the
That's not even too hot a way to say it without our getting fancy
Think of it as organizational things and we'll get to that perhaps
In any case, my colleague, Ed Rose, prefers to speak of “the most
The most ordinary things of the world are to be heard not only in
Now, what I would like to do this morning is to propose that, I'm
The candidate phenomena we're looking for what we want to do is
The matter that's so curios, well I won't repeat that .
I want to review a way, a source, of such candidate phenomenon .
A candidate phenomenon, by the way, is also discussed in the
I think I might have discussed it before, didn't I ?
Yeah, okay fine . 1121933_1132006
Well then, let me go through some materials to tell you about them,
These would be research lessons . 1143794_1146636
Alright ?
One of them is already discussed at considerable length in the
The candidate phenomenon there is called and is spoken of, on
Since it's there to be read in considerable detail, and I think I
The phenomenon he's speaking of is that despite an elaborate
And coming together that way provides grounds for all analysis that
So that's a great curiosity, to now come on the essential absence
In fact, musicians are treated at length in describing their work .
Alright then, what Sudnow's conjecture then provides for us is at
One is that the very availability of reasonable procedures for
So you can't interrogate any of the literature to recover the
So the first phenomenon is that somehow you have, despite this
Then that's an issue, That is to say, a candidate phenomenon then
So that would be studying musicians while omitting the thing that
There's an ancillary phenomenon that accompanies that .
It's also mentioned in the lectures paper . 1434420_1448651
And that is, that if you go looking for literature, you find that
So it's not enough then .
I point that out because as a matter of fact the conjecture is
That's a different story . 1487752_1515114
That is to say, that there we're not dealing with the practices and
But in any case, that thing that I want to point out is that we
I mean by that, it's pointless to entertain the phenomenon as
Or better or worse than it could be, or should be . 1551058_1567500
I think that what you'll find is that these ironic stances are very
You can get them done over a long afternoon, and then without even
Okay, that's a first one . 1600715_1618835
Now a second candidate phenomenon I want to talk to is provided for
I want to provide now another candidate phenomenon for our
Here's what he was doing: He's concerned with many things in the
He takes note of the fact that within, say, roughly from about
now you're going to have to understand that I'm incompetent with
And they're pretty much delivered in paraphrase of Eglin's
Roughly from about, let's say in a two hundred year period, from
And the question is whatever happened to it ? 1754324_1761074
The prevalent view is that it went into the grave . 1761074_1769304
Eglin doesn't think that's so .
Here's what his argument is .
This is a reasoned conjecture . 1769304_1778813
He says when you come to examine the histories that provide for
Which is to say, says Eglin, you can have a chemist, who begins
So starting with that kind of an apparatus, then, the historical
Documents are located, they're examined, what can be read in them,
And as you read back along that trail, says Eglin, the analytic
That is to say, he finds a beginning for analytic chemistry, and in
Finding laboratory alchemy that way, he then reads back up that
And putting those rivals together, with respect to what they could
So it was in that way, it lost out to a powerful rival . 1960600_1966535
And in two hundred years, it was then dismantled, demolished it
Now Eglin proposes that that has to be puzzling there's
He says the thing that's puzzling is, first of all, that wherever
Not only in western Europe but in ancient China . 2002776_2006933
And not only that, but it seems to have flourished for thousands of
And you can't really lend credence to the chemists' claim that it
He asks instead, if it has to be viewed that way, by reason of the
What he finds is that that period between sixteen hundred and
That is to say, it was in effect being turned into an enterprise
Which is to say, it was being subjected to recordings of the
And this was a critical development in the development, not of
Now, he says, the thing that's peculiar about laboratory chemistry
So that its discoveries were discoveries about the structures of
His conjecture then is that laboratory alchemy didn't lose out in
However, what it could do was nevertheless to provide for the
What he says happened was that that laboratory alchemy lost out,
If you want to find out then what happened to laboratory alchemy,
That laboratory alchemy wasn't run into the grave, it simply
That's a candidate issue .
That is to say, the candidate issue is not to recover alchemy
That would mean then that the big issue that's being pointed to is
In fact it didn't flee . 2471002_2475741
It's that it consists of it's available in the local occasion
So the candidate issue we're finding is the discovering practices
That's a reasoned conjecture, the documentation is of the most
Mike Lynch is probably the closest of any of us to taking on that
The problems, the troubles that accompany Mike Lynch's work is that
So that means that although he can undertake the investigation, he
it isn't in the places that his movements find and organize as the
In any case, if you want to know where might you go with any of the
It isn't that you would then recover the scandal that, let's say
Alright, The big news would be that it would give you access now to
Which is what a lot of philosophers of science are pretty much
So that's what the issue consists of and some sketch of what it's
By the way, there's a footnote on that . 2662000_2671676
A great hero of American sociology, whose name will not be
And the shoulders, those shoulders were men just like, not like
That's a really miraculous kind of finding, I mean, that Newton
Alright, So that sets up at least the possibility that things might
There's something else .
Eglin offers this as the alternative: Newton was allowed what we'll
His lunacy was that, together with being a productive scientist, he
Right, That is, he had good words for this . 2799000_2802527
Now that stuff mystifies his biographers, but they allow it of him,
Okay, And besides he was young in the whole process, so let it go .
Wittgenstein, by the way, is similarly allowed that lunacy . 2822359_2826415
well, after all he had so many nice things that he came up with,
He simply seems to go to pot . 2844554_2846897
Well, then, he was slightly crazy but he can be forgiven . 2846897_2852350
Eglin says he doesn't think that Newton was interested in alchemy
He thinks in fact that Newton was praising the alchemists, that he
Now that's a crazy conjecture . 2899563_2904683
I mean it's absolutely reasoned, there isn't two cents worth of
Nevertheless it would make a really lovely term paper for someone
It would be really nice to know if in fact it's even a defensible
Suppose it is a defensible proposal, then we have it on the hero of
He's like any other sociologist of knowledge who's dreaming his way
Okay, that's the second . 2968106_2974706
I want to tell you now of some issues that can be found, candidate
That is to say yeah okay that'll do it .
There's a way in which a literature on personal troublemakers will
Let me give you some examples . 3102697_3106807
What kinds of things persons, are doing, and what kind of objects
Issues are originally being posed in, let's say with respect to
So what it is for instructions to be passed around as the work of
Now, Bob Edgerton has a really lovely book called The Cloak of
It's about adult mentally-retarded persons . 3260762_3281327
The thing to understand about adult retarded persons is that they
So what you have then, in reading the Cloak of Competence, is
One is what I'll simply speak of as the distinction between a
In one collection of instructions you have a catalogue, a
So we'll call that then the small g collection . 3403417_3409001
It consists of the recitation of instructions conforming to, in the
It doesn't mean that it corresponds to the original, it means that
The prototypical case of that then would be the set of instructions
“yes” . 3453654_3454536
“how do you play it” ?
Then he begins to list rules . 3454536_3457329
Then there's the matter of taking the recitation, what you find in
It doesn't say this is all of it, but it says for this list, it
They carry in the reading, there, the showing that they're
Now the thing that there's another collection now that the
And that is: There's that collection that provides for the issue of
For example, you're on the ward at Pomona State Hospital, it's'a
He calls these xxx together at one end of the ward and now he
Alright, “Joey, you clean the toilet”, etc handing out now the
“Joey, you clean the toilet” .
Joey turns and starts for the toilet .
The attendant says “where are you going” ?
So he's going to the toilet . 3565887_3585768
Then comes the instructions, right ?
“Not to the toilet, to the closet you're going to get the broom
So there we'll call that then, the in situ explication of a rule
So it's what it is that wouldn't have been heard that nevertheless
Quote “intersubjectively-adequate” . 3619666_3637571
Okay, It would have been then that thing specifically omitted,
That thing nevertheless bearing on the reading or the hearing of
And for the one who gives it, it provides for him the grounds for
Then that collection, heard and hearable with that second property,
Now the existence of these two collections, as a structure with
Okay, that's another candidate phenomenon . 3710119_3726811
How is your explication of what isn't said in any instruction
Are you asking how is it different ?
Is it an issue to provide for the difference ? 3754090_3765961
It would be a phenomenon, it would be something that you would be
Look, where instructions are concerned you can find this thing with
If you want, you can make it very very strong, with respect to
A game with rules is a game of the sort where if you ask a person
You're talking at the outset . 3825609_3828701
Now the strong case I mean you can get really really lovely
What happens for instructions in games, however, you need to be
I mean, even from, let's say, the Pomona State Hospital they're
So what happens is that that distinction, we'll say the Gamma, is a
It's powerful in the way in which the documenting method of
What you would like, after you've been ranging around, is to start
So, immediately, organizationally, it may get you into it but
Now the same thing holds for what you're finding is, look, it
And that would be I think there this advice would be: Well
that would be, this distinction as a locating device, as a
It seems to me that when you find a bit of stuff like this
It's a museum collection, I'm filing them off in folders and giving
That is to say, that structured the difference between “g” and
It would then be such as to build a theory of action in which we
So it would then look as if, having found this nice looking thing
That kind of thing is done by several persons who are prominent in
That is to say, ethnomethodology is itself being used to construct
I can't see where the ethnomethodology remains, although I can see
Thats is to say, the departmentally-based consequences of
You're making departmental capital, and more . 4180623_4187040
Who's doing that ? 4187040_4190300
Cicourel, That's Cicourel's prominent way of working . 4190300_4194906
I don't know that may answer your question in too great a length . 4194906_4207771
In a summary, I would say yeah, of course it's general, but why
I mean it just seems like what you, if I understand what you're
The distinction is not clear as to what particularly the reference
If there are two, why the two ?
What are the two things that are being provided for . 4268233_4274141
Well, the listing of rules that represent an original list of
that it seems like that's very specific and there's very little
So it's like if you pursued the small “g” collection, it just do
As I see it, the small “g” collection is kind of very
It consists of that listed catalogue as a thing under the
That it consists of a heard catalogue is something available as a
It's not merely I mean we're not here faced with the question
That's not it at all it's that the three thereby are available,
So, since they're examined to see of them that they provide for
So the “g”, that so-called Gamma collection then goes to the first
I hesitate to call that gamma thing the background expectancies, or
In fact, I think it's a rosy trail to speak of it that way . 4445667_4452166
It's a cheap shot . 4452166_4457371
You can then set up the whole goddamn thing by providing that the
Well the cheap shot resides in this: We're using like a
We're after the in situ problem, right, of producing instructions
Well, the phenomenon we find is that whenever we come on these
It was a very early presumed finding of someone who will remain
you know this little goofy device of just using, say, parallel
Years ago it might have been worth the time but, hell, it's not
I mean it's not worth anybody's time to take up that issue of
What I'm pointing out is that what we're after is the production of
And of that catalogue you find, whenever you encounter it, it has
So it's the catalogue available under a recitation and reading,
And with it as well, this enormously important feature of its
Harold, you were saying that the interpretive rule that Cicourel
Well, when he began writing it .
well, I don't think I should comment on it .
I oughtn't to call it a cheap shot, I think it's being done with
Where does it lead ?
Well, I think it leads to an endless ethnography of sentences, like
I say evoking because the ethnography calls to our attention to the
So it poses as a mystery that persons, in the face of the fact that
That is, they seem to be able to count on that as enough . 4702497_4725322
If now you want to address, with that ethnographic stuff, the issue
And their methods of play exhibitably or accountably
Now persons playing games are doing that of their play as a
That the play when you ask of the work of play, what is it such
I mean it's seeable in every xxx the familiar events of chess .
Now you can't do it via the ethnography of sentences .
That's out of the question . 4870086_4884634
And if you do it via the semiotic, I mean if you do it via a theory
You can turn pieces, for example, into signs of pieces so that they
This is a castle, this is a knight, this is a rook xxx . 4903967_4908540
What that leaves entirely unanswered is what is it that persons in
It's not that theory of signs is a resource for ethnomethodology .
It's not .
It's one of the reasons why, for example, there's no reconciliation
Harold, you made a statement that the documentary method was too
I've been mulling over the last couple of days how it is that .
I wonder if you could play that over for us . 4941522_4966142
By powerful, I mean that when you have a way of speaking of it,
And now comes that flukey I called it an experiment at the
But, never mind . 5040781_5062864
Now that thing, which you come to explicate is the same things now
So now we get the explication, the idea that there were questions
When I say it's very powerful, that it'll get a hell of a lot of
I mean, you collect all kinds of things in this way . 5103454_5110577
You tell it to students and you say “Alright, let's say this is
No matter how many students you have, they'll do it, okay . 5128750_5133750
Now that's a really interesting research enterprise if you only
That is to say, thinking of the formula you can now open up, you
That is, what can be seen, since now you need to make it
The thing that you're depending on in finding examples or finding
In fact, to produce things that will come to mind . 5193731_5197937
That's not searching the world, that's searching the world's talk
It doesn't even turn up in the head 'cause Christ knows what's
So I think it has to do then if there's this suspicion, the
What I mean, then, by the power of it is that it's suspiciously a
That doesn't mean that it's of no goddamn use, alright, it's
You mustn't think that's of no I might be appearing to be
Remember that I said at the beginning look, I think of there being
And I proposed reasoned conjecture as one source, one way of
That documented conjecture includes the ways of ethnography . 5313760_5316852
And then there's the analysis of organizational items where Sacks'
And then the analysis of what I call naturally-organized or
I think of the results of the ethnomethodological studies as being
That is, they have varying degrees of strength .
I've already given you now what I would consider to be very, very
Well, fragile in this sort of way, they're for whoever wants to use
They're strong enough if that's what you have to start with . 5372110_5375768
But if you distrust it, then that's okay that's simply a shop
The idea is that there's that progression, and they also provide
And I've roughly sketched them as for the use of reasoned
The idea is that I don't think you go the route from using
xxx . 5441935_5453471
I don't think xxx . 5458471_5465656
Could we take about ten minutes to get some sense of the papers ?
Is the discussion you had this morning about chemistry is that xxx
xxx .
Okay, it's just curiosity it turns out, I'm not certain what it
Formal discussion is theoretical and informal is practical “and you
Oh are you talking about an actual lecture ?
Oh good .
yeah, and you know, he writes down these formulas, and you're
Then he just looks at you, and he tells you “here's the way it
Is this the kind of thing you're talking about ?
It's exactly what I'm talking about .
Not only that but I haven't yet talked about, and it's a pity if we
I didn't have a chance to look, it's very interesting to watch when
Yes and not only when they do it, but they're also watching each
Yeah that's really neat . 5465656_5585554
I'd like to give a few more sources of candidate phenomena . 5585554_5601146
As reasoned conjectures, I want to show you two more .
Both of them the following two are kind of alike in that in
Do you understand what I mean by reasoned ?
I don't mean that they're worthless, I mean that you mustn't
But you must take them seriously; you might as well take them
then certainly that would be the best you have in hand . 5659265_5675672
So, okay .
Now one of these texts is a very familiar way of proposing how one
And I want to offer you first of all how would a question like
And then I want to introduce, I want to put brackets around that
Then a second thing, that I want to do is to start with a really
That comes from nowhere, right ? 5769401_5772561
I want to show you how you can operate on that so as to find
Let's take the question “what's really happening” . 5796449_5800040
There's a way of understanding how a question like this would be
Ordinarily, here's how a question like that would be understood:
In the strongest sense, or if we were addressed now to the
Which is to say, you'd provide in that language for a way of
I'm not talking now in the brazen sense of the world as a big
So you would construct a language for a world and then you would
Then you would analyze that ontology for the properties that the
In that way, then, you would have invented a language that would
Now those procedures are familiar, they're well understood, they
Now I want to show you that there's a variation on that we want
what we're going to do is to put tic brackets around the question
&=writes:blackboard We're gonna do that .
Now doing that means that everything that's going to be of interest
Here's an inquiry: “what's really happening”, and the thing that
That's to say, the question “what's really happening” is itself a
So everything now that Alright, the idea now, what we're
Now let's rephrase it again . 6107807_6112279
What we would be looking for are actual places, actual materials . 6112279_6117316
We're going to search them in writings of various persons . 6117316_6123599
We're looking now to get some specifics, get some handles, trying
Now what would thematic be ? 6147723_6149584
Well to begin with the question “what's really happening”, as a
Now don't take a principled notion of “focus of consciousness”,
Put brackets around “focus of consciousness” because you're going
So you don't want to close it down with a definition, you only want
Similarly, then, you have not only the “focus of consciousness” but
That would be another way of making explicit .
now, understand that figure and ground is not a principled
But instead, to say that it's thematic means, for example, that it
Since we're saying that these organizational objects are productive
Well, is it that we're nevertheless importing the analytic
After all, “figure-ground structure”, that looks like it could be a
Now the answer to that is “No”, we'll treat it as part of an
You're bringing things out . 6322295_6325138
Well, there are more specifics to the notion of the thematic but I
Now, in order to specify the kind of thing I'm talking about, let
I mean by that that it's in the reportage of others that I've
None of the ethnomethodologists have done this work . 6364156_6371200
So what I'm speaking about is, I'm recommending this now on the
One such setting where the question “what's really happening” is at
Let me show you what I'm talking about . 6409508_6421544
In the writings of Dia Vernon, who is a dean among professional
And he makes this really interesting comment .
He says that a good trick is a simple one, a good trick is one
they'll say “he picked up a deck of cards, he shuffled them, he put
Now, what Dia Vernon points out is that the parties to the trick
That is to say, they're left with that account of how the trick was
And beyond that as well, it's in answering the question “what's
There's another trick, it's a very, very common one .
They do it at the Magic Castle in Los Angeles, which is a great
And right in the center is a very small table and the two parties
And he has these coins in his hand, and now he shakes those coins
I'm going to pound them right through the center of the table
Now comes all this patter, and he's shaking these coins and then
“I just want you to look at” +...
But you're not looking, and then he shoves them in your face and
So with their own very eyes, they now have the story to tell .
What did he do ? 6640820_6646422
He had those coins in his hand, he shook them at her and said “do
yes, you see them .
“I'm going to put them through the center of the table” .
“Ha ha” .
He then says “Now, look”, you watch but you're not paying
And he insisted that you pay attention and then, when he had her
Now then, here's what the issue is .

There is in comparison to this Dia Vernon's description of how the

Okay, that's a first example . 6867243_6872781
Here is a case where the question “what's really happening” is
And it's thereby produced as well in its thematic character . 6881575_6886827
So the case in point is two kinds of things would be happening,
So that's number one . 6910003_6911780
Now there's a second case I want to bring to your attention .
In the book “Survival in Auschwitz”, Carlo Levi speaks of the
They go there to form a queue not knowing what it is that they're
And there is then in the period, in the course of the queue that's
What is it that's really happening ?
where that question is distributed over the parties who, the

then you want to be up far enough so that you might be chosen for
But if there are those who now will go to the gas chambers and
Those questions, then, what it is that's really happening are now
That would then be another case of materials consulted in order to
A third example . 7053969_7060186
There are some confidence games the Badger, for example

That starts it, right ?

At time two, let's say five seconds later, you have a bunching of

As it does, the drivers are now proceeding ahead . 7306045_7343933
A very characteristic thing happens as the drivers proceed now to
Regardless of where they are in the traffic, they go searching
Now, for a traveling wave, what happens is that they're looking for
It turns out that when they go looking, they don't find it .
But you'll see one driver after the other xxx so here we have an

That would be a contrasting case of coming on the question “what's
Now one more example . 7452489_7459821
I want to give you another way of exploiting a bit of textual
We just found as an issue that inquiries can, if we treat them in
they're really in situ xxx ; that is, they're part of the object as
Let me take this other case where we have a bit of text .
There's an introduction to Sense and Non-Sense, translated by Bert
Sense and Non-Sense by Merleau-Ponty .
Dreyfus writes as follows: He says that at the end of a Pinter
So he says, like the characters the audience can make sense only in

What we want to do is to develop the formula . 7602541_7608300
That is, we want now to ask .
look we want to find what kind of things, what kind of
Worldly things . 7624884_7629273
We want to find now, without exploiting the term “hitherto
We want it as a part of an organizational arrangement, we want it
And we're asking, well, what various things can they be ? 7660809_7665631
And we want to do it without, as I say, merely imagining what
Well, let me give you some examples, then, of how they could be
I'm reading the newspaper one day in Los Angeles, and here's a
Like a big transport, and it comes down and kills something like
And the newspaper is simply filled, then, with the details of the
But it has something even better . 7725612_7728022
I'm not being callous, I'm saying it has something more impressive
It has “but for” stories, and the whole paper is loaded with “but
It's true that they have a story about how the plane fell, but then
Not the ones that got killed, but the survivors .
And here's what they're reporting: In light of, now that the

And if I hadn't called him back, he would have been under the

It is also found, indeed, that he was thereby imperiled . 7851076_7855167
It is found as well in the story, that how he could have been
It could not have been told .
I mean it could not have been foreseen . 7869446_7880252
So that gives us then what I'll call the first case of the hitherto
By “reasoned organization of a course of affairs” I'm talking about
It's not any way that they live, and it's not any way that the
By the way, these “but for” stories can be found all over the

When it got invented they could hardly wait to get into the

So now we have another version of the hitherto meaningless . 8225507_8229498
The bags of feces, of God knows what, available then as garbage,
And then, under that, the procedure will turn that garbage into
So that would be one more case of the hitherto meaningless as
It takes on its full, depictable, accountably rational
So that's what “meaningful” is, that's what the stuff can be made
So that's another example .
You get the idea . 8375092_8382857
It's a work procedure . 8382857_8390987
