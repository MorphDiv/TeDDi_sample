&~www .
okay &-um she &-um says that I haven't got any friends .
and she abuses me .
and and it's quite nasty .
&-um and she always gets on my nerve if I hafta work next_to her .
like she pokes me or steals my pen or something .
and &-um she &-um whispers to her friends about me behind her back
and &-um and then she like acts as_if I smell or something .
and 0 sticks up her nose whenever she walks past me .
and &-um &-um that's about it .
+< that's plenty , that's perfect thank you .
