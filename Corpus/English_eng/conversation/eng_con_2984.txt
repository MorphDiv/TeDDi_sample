all right .
so I think they should be prevented from assisted suicide because in extreme circumstances if the person was just about to die then I would understand . 2545_13045
but if it's not in that way, then the person should die naturally, and not by a doctor assisting them . 13345_21185
to die this way, is basically the doctor is being a murderer . 21625_24165
well, I think they should allow a doctor to assist suicide because if the person is in coma or something, I think they should write a paper, sign a paper that says, oh, I can die, or something like that . 25395_44155
like a release form ? 44495_46235
yeah .
I think the family member does that . 46315_47595
it's called pulling the plug ? 48155_50855
it's a similar contract, when someone who has the right to say what going to happen after and some kind of stuff +... 57165_64385
it's the family member though, right ? 64425_65185
yeah . 65285_65365
I think doctors should be prevented from helping people suicide because I thought doctors were supposed to help people live . 65705_75925
even if they in much pain and they want to die . 76325_78825
I think they just should let them live for how long they going to live . 79385_83925
I know, but +... 84405_84545
I think a doctor's job is more to get rid of the pain than to help the person live . 85565_91065
I think it should be allowed as long as the patient approves of it and the family approves of it . 91065_96505
because I mean, doctors say that they want to pursue happiness . 96865_99645
so if the patient feels happy, they want to commit suicide because of the pain, then do it . 100565_105245
a comment on what S_seven was saying, you know, if you think about it, like you could be in extreme pain and you know that there's no hope . 106525_113265
I mean, you don't want to go through all that pain . 113965_115705
just to know that you're just going to end up dying . 116025_119025
I mean, that's a good circumstance where you should have the ability to end your life with the help of the doctor . 119745_127885
yeah . 128045_128165
but then knowing that you're sick and that you're in pain, but then knowing that doctors actually helped you die . 128085_134965
that's just +... 135785_136045
the patient's approving it so it's okay . 136445_138405
I don't think so .
it's not like the doctor's killing you . 139105_143065
you're saying, doctor, kill me . 143565_146365
but in a way, the doctor is kind of killing you because he's the one that's pulling the plug . 146765_150745
but you've approved him to pull the plug . 151365_154105
but still, he's still killing you, no matter what you do . 154425_156425
they need to make everything legal, because like in this country you had to have everything written down, which is better . 157805_165005
so yeah, a contract and signed and they should get the family involved as well +... 165165_170905
I'm not talking about how expensive . 171365_173265
we're not talking about expensive, but at least get papers signed or forms signed stating that you gave permission and get the family involved as well . 174215_184675
because it's not +... 185135_185475
yeah, I think it's good that she said, get the family involved because if the person is in so much pain, all they're thinking about is the pain . 185855_194095
they just want to get rid of it . 194215_195095
so they might not be thinking about the fact that the doctor could somehow get rid of the pain without having to kill them . 195505_202465
but listen to this, I was in civics class and I was looking at the amendments and in one of the amendments, it said that you have the right to life . 202465_210825
and it was in one of those amendments . 211565_212625
I mean, if you have the right to life then you have the right to end it . 212805_215465
if you want to . 215785_216825
I'm not going to end somebody else's . 217125_218845
but you know +... 218885_219205
that would be jeopardizing all the things that they worked for because we're called to prevent suicide . 221765_227265
so in a way that statement totally alters what people normally think . 227845_234505
but, but it's not suicide, suicide . 236145_239865
it's not like +... 240185_240725
I didn't jump off a building . 241885_243125
time is approaching . 244025_245925
so if you have not had a chance to talk, this is your chance . 246185_248905
I never had a chance to talk . 248985_250265
guys . 249955_250535
I know this is a radical approach, but if you think about it, it's alot better than just sitting in a bed with extreme pain or extreme sadness . 250695_261035
think about it . 261415_262635
your family members are probably absolutely depressed because they see you in this bed, complete pain and you can't do anything about it . 262735_271175
and it's a lot cheaper probably . 271655_274115
they don't think about it . 274135_275035
they'd be like, oh yeah, just do it . 275515_277015
because they don't think about like the pain . 278075_280015
they only think about the pain . 280175_281155
it's like when you're in labor and they want to do it natural labor . 281715_288135
and then when that time comes, they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no . 288315_291215
I want an epidural . 291215_291715
I want an epidural . 291795_292555
epidural . 292655_293995
that's a good analogy . 294335_298255
let's stop right there . 298895_300255
people on the outside of the fishbowl . 300315_302035
okay . 303175_305075
so an extra challenge being in the second group is whether or not you xxx where they left off . 305045_310965
so if everybody can take a second to think about stuff you've just heard . 311645_314785
and if there's something that you want to say in response to something you just heard, that might be an appropriate starting place . 316065_321445
okay ? 322625_322845
you're on . 324205_324765
why would you want to do that ? 333385_334865
speak louder . 335405_335825
why would you want to do that ? 336405_338025
what does it do for you ? 338645_341445
even though, what if you're not going to die, but you still want to die . 342345_348125
what's going to happen then ? 349225_349945
you've never know . 350005_350545
what I think should happen, it should be the family's decision, but I think the doctor should give an opinion or say how long they have left to live before they make the decision to kill them or not . 354235_367575
yeah .
and sometimes when they tell them the time that they have left to live, sometimes we hear on the news that people survive it . 368035_381575
so I don't really agree with that . 382225_385405
sometimes, I think it depends on, first of all, their pain, which might me be +... 386665_393245
like it says here . 394165_395305
what page is it ? 396185_397525
it says the patient might be in so much pain that they might not know what they're saying, but they still want to do it . 397785_409565
and it also depends on if they have a long time to live . 410025_414305
but I think it depends how long or short it is . 414665_420065
and if it's like a week or two away, they might just want to end it there . 420285_424385
and it depends if their life left is going to be painful or not . 425165_430625
because I hear some people aren't in any pain, but they know they're doomed . 430785_435025
so they'll just live the rest of the life they have . 435265_441425
I think it should be like a three-way decision between the family, the doctor, and the patient to see if they should just end their life . 442845_452425
and I think a doctor has to be positive that he won't last . 452625_456325
but if there's a chance, they should make it against the law to let them kill themselves . 456465_462605
the family doesn't know how much pain the person is in, so they can't really tell which decision they should pick . 466445_472925
it's not the family choosing, it's all three people choosing . 473345_475685
something I didn't like was the family filling out the decision of the patient . 476705_490465
it's not your decision . 494195_495215
it's not the family's decision . 495715_496995
so why would you want to kill your own family ? 497575_500335
I guess, in order to pay the health stuff . 501235_503735
I feel like the doctor should only assist if it's very serious for the patient . 505035_513015
like the patient is in very excruciating pain . 513415_516495
xxx like if they're just in pain, they're both +... 520795_524615
physical pain and mental pain ? 525595_528075
and emotional . 528295_528915
yeah . 529335_529715
go for it . 530235_531495
yeah .
the patient can't think straight because they could be so sick, they'll be on so many different medications . 533315_540695
and so that's why I think it should partially be the family's decision because they can't think straight then they're just going to be like, yeah, do it . 541945_551385
yeah because the family doesn't know how the patient feels . 551845_554565
yes they do, they know the patient very well . 555045_556945
okay, but +... 557425_557965
it's their family . 558065_558365
they don't know what it feels like . 559225_560925
they don't feel his pain . 561245_562725
they don't know what he's going through . 563765_564925
yeah but sometimes you can tell, they could be out of it, they'll be saying random things . 565025_569705
they'll think different things in their head . 569665_571405
they'll know if they're not themselves completely . 571945_574065
only if they think they're completely lost . 574505_576425
think he's crazy . 577145_577905
I think it might be kind of selfish if the family overrides the patient's decision because the patient might argue and the family would override him or her . 578905_594585
and so if the patient continued to live then he'd probably live an even more unhappy life . 595605_602905
if the family completely disagrees with him . 603085_609265
and so we're approaching the end of the cycle . 609705_612385
if you've hadn't had a chance to talk, this is a good time . 612645_615225
hey S_nineteen, what side do you support ? 624855_626215
well, I think that the family should decide because I was in a similar situation when my nana passed away a few months ago and we got to decide what we wanted to do . 626815_638815
so yeah . 639095_640735
and what did your nana think ? 641255_644155
she just wanted to come home with the hospice and spend the rest of her time with her family . 644855_651275
so, that's what we did . 651935_652655
that's what my dad's dad did like twenty years ago . 654685_658945
okay, let's stop for a sec . 661825_684565
