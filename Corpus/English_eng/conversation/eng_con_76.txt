there is a policeman walking down the street checking on various
and then he came up upon a man standing in a doorway with a
and he asked the man what he was doing there perhaps .
and the man said +"/.
+" what I'm waiting for someone that I had known twenty years ago .
+" and we had promised each other that we would meet here after
so they kept talking .
and then let's see what happened after that .
I think he asked the man about the restaurant that they both had
I think the place was called Joe_Brady's restaurant .
he said +"/.
+" oh Joe_Brady's restaurant .
+" well, that restaurant is no longer here .
he said I'm said +"/.
+" I'm sorry that it isn't here because we could have had dinner here
so he asked him how was he doing .
one of the men named Bob perhaps had moved to the west coast to
and Jimmy the name of the other man asked how he been doing out
he said +"/.
+" well moderately well .
+" so how have you been doing back here on the East .
+" I've done rather well for myself .
so then they kept talking .
and one mentioned the fact of how he missed the old
and the places they had visited .
and how most of them had gone out of business or had just faded
so then the policeman at that point wished him well .
and walked away .
so after that another man in a long coat across from the other side
and while the other man saw him he said +"/.
+" is that you Bob ?
he said +"/.
+" Jimmy you are Jimmy_Wells ?
he said +"/.
+" yes .
+" yes I am Jimmy_Wells .
so then somehow or another a young man lit a cigar .
and the man said +"/.
+" you are not Jimmy_Wells .
+" Jimmy_Wells had a Roman nose .
+" yours is a pug nose !
he said +"/.
+" well you know how things change over time .
got to the point where one in the long coat turned as it out to be
and told Bob that +"/.
+" you are under arrest .
+" you are wanted in Chicago .
+" and I'm here to arrest you .
in the meanwhile another gentleman passes another a note that read
+" I've been watching you .
+" you are wanted in Chicago .
+" you are not who you say you are .
and that kind of thing .
the lady that directed the group, the Jubilee singers that I was
I was given notice of her passing .
and they asked me would I come down .
and xxx join some of the former members to be a part of her funeral
so I purchased a ticked .
and xxx drove out to National airport to get on this plane to go to
I went through a gate seemingly the gate I was supposed to go
but I went through the gate .
xxx got on the plane .
so then one of the stewardesses came to me .
and xxx said +"/.
+" will you be having lunch ?
I said +"/.
+" I don't think so .
+" I don't I have time to do that .
+" because I'm getting off in Nashville .
+" I'll just bypass the offer to have to have lunch .
she said +"/.
+" I beg your pardon .
I said +"/.
+" I'm getting off at Nashville .
she said +"/.
+" there must be some mistake .
+" this flight is a one way direct flight to Miami Florida .
I said +"/.
+" you're kidding me .
+" there must be some mistake .
she said +"/.
+" I'm sorry, .
+" but you'll have to go all the way to Miami .
+" hopefully we'll be able to get you a return flight to Nashville in
but there was no return flight .
they offered me dinner at the airport in Miami .
made all kinds of apologies to me .
and <gave me a> refunded the fare that I had paid for this
but there was no comfort to me at all for me to attend my dear
so I got back to DC probably some time late that evening .
and I called my wife from the airport .
and told her to pick me up .
she said +"/.
+" well you're not supposed to be back this soon .
+" what are you doing back this soon ?
I told her the whole story about the mixup about the airport .
and that's how my little story ends
