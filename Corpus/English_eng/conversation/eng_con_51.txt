one night Michael, Alvin, Willie, and I were riding on the
it was amazing that we were on the parkway because at New_York
we should have stopped right there .
but we didn't because I was driving .
and I was Firstname_Lastname .
I was unfazed .
and flying down the highway in the fog .
after a while what I thought was thick fog got thicker .
the only thing that I could see was not the line on the ground but
there was no way to get off of the parkway .
<if there had been> the fog was so thick that we couldn't
so, I'm driving along following the tail light of the guy in front
Michael, Willie, and Alvin were all praying that the guy wouldn't
then, I get a flat tire .

they said +"/.
+" you got a spare in the trunk .
I said +"/.
+" yup but I don't have a jack .
they say +"/.
+" what do you need a jack for ?
+" we got a spare in the trunk ?

we had a sheet in the trunk too .
now, if you could imagine four idiots standing out in a goddamn
