and then for our y@l we got sixty . 73911_77071
good . 77071_77792
so ‡ <I think there's> you &+ha this is correct . 77792_80863

<what'd you> how many laps ? 133545_135248
0 . 135248_137550
&-um thirty two minus the square root of eight over two . 137550_142356
that many laps ? 142356_144072
wait a second . 144072_144576
+< that's a_lot_of laps . 144072_145170

shoot . 152697_156059
0 . 156059_160055
your &-um how'd you get a negative ? 160055_164638
because thirty two minus eighty eight . 164638_167209
0 . 167209_169435
so ‡ are these your answers ? 169435_173164
yeah ? 173164_176231
those are your answers ? 176231_177818
no . 177818_178751
no ? 178751_179237
+< xxx this x@l . 178837_180060
what ? 180060_181822
we need to find the &-um for that . 181122_183789
so ‡ what's x@l ? 183789_184990
put x@l into the other equation . 184590_186531
yeah . 186531_187387
wait . 187387_188071
what is your x@l ? 188071_189204
is it negative twenty eight or is it sixty or is it both ? 189204_193345
wait a minute how did you get negative twenty eight over sixty ? 193345_197800
divide by two . 197800_198969
remember ? 198969_200420
there is no square root to eighty eight though . 200420_203589
eighty eight is the square root of seventy eight thousand so xxx . 203589_208483
yeah . 208483_210211
0 . 210211_212715
okay ‡ so ‡ anyways are these both your answers one your answers
one ? 218051_219901
one ? 219901_220739
hm ? 220739_222119
(be)cause you can't have a negative xxx „ right ? 222119_225407
+< one will be but one is +... 224407_226711
you gotta put it into the equation . 226711_228325
+< yeah ‡ it's just you gotta put it into the top equation then . 227211_229876
so ‡ if x@l times i@l +... 229876_233363
where's the other xxx ? 233363_234692
0 . 234692_245012
are you guys getting +..? 245012_246627
I know . 246627_247520
okay ‡ stay +/. 247520_248518
&+sh you have a coach over here . 248518_249921
you guys work together . 249921_250996
stay focused . 250996_252296
&-laughs you forgot to mention xxx . 252296_255644
okay ‡ so so ‡ then you have that . 254744_257317
so ‡ make it so this side is zero . 257317_259504
so ‡ subtract one sixteen off of each side . 259504_261969
so ‡ are they working on the way that +/? 261969_263306
had they even started on trying to find it with the way ? 263306_265740
did they have a method ? 265740_266872
yeah ‡ yeah ‡ they they got it . 265872_267381
they had it right . 267381_267918
except then he didn't tell them it was x@l squared instead of x@l . 267918_272172
+< no ! 269380_272172
well ‡ tell us everything . 272172_273689
maybe it's right . 273689_275397
+< are you coaching or are you telling ? 274089_275797
one I'm starting out . 275797_277043
you starting ? 277043_278564
www . 278564_285313
thank_you . 285313_286168

0 . 291659_298439
thank_you . 298439_299724
you didn't check yesterday's . 299724_301013
I know . 301013_301675
0 . 301675_304045
yesterday's homework wasn't exactly impressive so I decided not to .
0 . 308549_310499
I didn't know the answers though . 310499_311871
you know what the answers are ? 311871_312984
0 . 312984_317003
so ‡ were you guys on the right track ? 317003_321739
were you guys on the right track ? 321739_324345
what he said was it completely different than what you guys were
no ‡ <we just had to figure out> we just had to figure out how
+< no . 327863_328322
+< get it by yourselves . 330851_332362
solve for something . 332362_333122
0 . 333122_340316
do you guys know what you're gonna do now ? 340316_341792
0 . 341792_362074
I'm confused . 362074_363066
did you subtract y@l from both sides ? 363066_369947
is that the right answer ? 369947_371215
or no ? 372215_373110
&-um <but don't> but don't &=grabs:paper &=grumbles . 373110_383691
&-uh &-um +... 383691_388035
so ‡ what how did you get that x@l by itself ? 388035_391316
Firstname ? 391316_393008
&-um once we did times multiply by two to get +//. 393008_398004
no ‡ this one right here . 398004_402008
I don't know xxx . 402008_404018
what'd you guys do to get the +..? 404018_407539
where'd you get this from ? 407539_414048
0 . 415069_425311
so ‡ <you divided both sides by> you guys divided both sides by
I would +... 430899_432333
0 . 432333_439303
so ‡ you said subtract . 439303_440614
but actually what was happening here wasn't subtracting . 440614_442495
so ‡ you subtracted . 442495_443224
you &+ha you don't have any y@l to subtract . 443224_445025
what happened was you were dividing by y@l . 445025_446744
0 . 446744_453863
are you +..? 453863_455179
0 . 455179_459671
so ‡ you just have this written there that came from the x@l times
equals one eighty ? 464019_464842
no ‡ it doesn't . 464842_465863
www . 465863_470426
now you're completely lost ? 470426_471229
okay ‡ so ‡ how about you guys get this unlost together . 471229_473487
and you should have some steps too . 473487_476498
and once you guys are +... 476498_479053
are you guys stuck here ? 479053_480091
0 . 480091_483518
are you guys stuck there ? 483518_484306
okay ‡ so ‡ first figure out where you guys get this equation from .
0 . 486863_496946
after you guys are done with this problem . 496946_499209
0 . 499209_503012
okay ‡ are you guys doing it ? 503012_505229
no . 505229_505772
okay ‡ so ‡ you divided by y@l . 505772_507361
what happened when you divided by y@l ? 507361_510285
x@l times y@l divided by y@l . 510285_512352
www . 512352_516889
(be)cause y@l divided by y@l is ? 516889_519590
one . 519590_520413
one one one . 520413_522054
(be)cause three divided by three would be ? 522054_523712
one . 523712_524103
one . 524103_524430
five divided by five would be ? 524430_525570
one . 525570_525901
y@l divided by y@l would be ? 525901_527298
one . 527298_527715
one . 527715_528106
so ‡ we have x@l equals +... 528106_532387
go ahead Firstname . 532387_533143
yeah . 533143_533706
0 . 533706_540058
okay . 540058_541677
so ‡ this is something you guys should all be talking about the
so ‡ you have this . 546842_547678
and then where did this go ? 547678_549137
<you have> where did this come from ? 549137_552784
&-uh this is +//. 552784_553603
oh ‡ from this first equation ? 553603_555287
you multiply both sides by two . 555287_557025
okay ‡ so ‡ now you have two equations . 557025_558835
you have x@l equals this . 558835_563010
except for you guys have two different things here . 563010_564931
not since you were here . 564931_566595
oh ‡ she plugged in ? 566595_567874
