well there's a boy .
he had a pet frog .
he went to sleep .
and then the frog got out .
and the next morning the boy found out .
that the frog was gone .
and somehow the dog got his head stuck <in the> in the bowl .
so he fell out the window .
<and the boy> and the boy got mad .
and the dog licked him .
and then they went looking for him .
the boy looked down a hole .
with <a &-um something> an animal in it .
the dog knocked <the honey> the beehive down .
and now the bees are after him .
and the boy looked in a tree .
with an owl .
and <the boy> the dog was running away from the bees .
and the owl came out_of the hole .
then the deer went on a log .
that looked like sticks from a branch .
and the boy climbed up on it .
and fell over onto the deer .
ran off with him .
<that> he pushed him off the cliff .
and <fell> they fell into the water .
then they found <the> the frog .
that married another little frog .
that had babies .
and they let him have &-um one of the babies .
and the boy headed home .
