it was twenty years ago or something .
a policeman came to some businesses .
and they were closed .
and mostly closed .
and he was checking out in each doorway .
and he saw a man standing in the doorway, I guess .
and he asked him why was he there, I suppose .
and he said he was waiting for a friend .
and they were supposed to meet twenty years from the day .
and he was, they grew up together in New_York .
one was eighteen .
and one was twenty .
and he had a square face, square chin with a scar on his right .
and he had I think it was +...
okay, I don't remember it .
and they set a date to meet twenty years later while they were
and one left .
the other one stayed in New_York .
the other one went to the West .
and when he came back, they were going to tell each other what
so he came back to the same exact place twenty years later .
and as he was standing in the doorway he was talking to a
and the policeman was asking him why he was there .
and about the friend he was waiting for .
and he said that he probably would be on time if he's still alive .
but if not +...
if he was still alive .
but he was going to give him at least thirty minutes to show up .

and <he was> he was saying that everything was okay,
and that he +...

I don't remember what happened after they met .
and then they, he said that everything was okay .
that's all I remember .
then they talked .
and, oh, he said something about a man that was wanted in New_York .
and he had to end up arresting his friend for this wanted man .
and I believe that was the end of the story .
well, I was sick a_lot in my childhood .
so that's mostly what registers in my mind .
I had this rash on my arm for a long time .
my mother used to take me to the doctor .
but nobody ever found out what this rash was .
and some foreign doctor came to the clinic one particular day .
and she was the only one that knew what it was .
and gave me some pink pills .
and after I took those pills this rash on my arm cleared up .
and I never had it since .
