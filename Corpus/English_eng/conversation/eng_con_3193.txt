whoo . 119484_119913
you are the kith of the Celts . 119832_120889
0 &=laugh .
0 &=laugh .
okay . 122792_123384
uhm . 124290_124859
so you have basic(ally) +//. 125451_126588
the way +//. 126670_126844
in +//. 126844_126960
do you know how Civilization works ? 127123_128423
well you have to build a civilization . 129071_130372
yeah . 130685_130929
you have basically a set of uh +//. 131266_132728
come on &~dip . 138022_138673
i think will turn the sound down . 139763_140889
turn up or ? 141226_141865
that's probably better . 143270_143862
<so> . 144280_144628
<okay> . 144280_144628
eh will ignore the city tutorial . 145092_146567
okay . 147655_148038
right . 148723_148909
so you have basically carried piece . 148898_150384
you have uh pieces . 150442_152427
uh these are settler pieces . 152623_154178
okay . 154353_154724
and what you can do is move them around . 154863_155990
a:nd you can build basis now . 155978_157336
that's actually a good place to start . 157754_159136
now what you see . 159482_159947
you see where the little dots in the middle of some of the
it's kinda of a two D map that's got a three D perspective on
<yeah well but> +//. 166276_167321
<so you have a mountain> there . 166334_167995
that's a mountain ? 168018_168529
yeah . 168668_168912
now , whenever you build a city . 169539_171094
what you can do with the city contains or makes use of uh the
okay so . 179510_180419
<basically> . 180419_180975
<okay> . 180975_181158
all the squares you can see there . 181158_183947
if you created the city where <the> the settler is then
and they us(e) +//. 191593_192058
those squares are use for resources . 192116_193590
different types <of s(quesre)> of uh squares give you
okay . 197906_198324
so you can se <the> the fish in the corner that means you get a
all right . 201749_202097
how do we move this guy around ? 202179_203200
<you can use the cursor key> . 203375_204443
<is that a mountain or a rock> ? 203375_204443
that's a mountain . 205174_205871
holy+moly . 205929_206440
he <is very big isn't> he ? 206944_207617
<so> . 207002_207490
yeah . 207606_207838
there's kinda not scale (..) <unfortunately> . 207861_209835
<okay> . 209230_209579
uhm . 210148_210937
so . 211030_211982
basically city will only ever take one square . 212280_214347
but you can move by basically moving your cursor . 214720_217600
like <that> ? 217727_218018
<and> then over the square you want to go to . 217936_219643
okay . 220049_220386
so . 220882_221289
i was just going to <look around> . 221649_222496
<now you> see you've got +//. 222206_222833
click <end_of@g> (..) end_of_term@g . 222844_224121
press enter@g . 224133_224621
i think you can just click on the . 224806_225735
oh man that's gamy . 226335_227240
so that meant that then the other (..) <com(petitors)>
is that the idea ? 230918_231336
yeah . 231552_232016
i never said it was a good spot . 232864_234048
but that's the advisor saying . 234570_236045
really ? 236300_236660
so to build a new city you press B@g . 236812_238425
you think i should do that ? 239052_239610
yeah . 240222_240362
<it won'(t)> it doesn't matter really . 240327_241581
make it somewhere . 242405_242962
cardiff@g . 244676_245071
cardiff@g . 245001_245489
okay . 245570_245849
we'll call it cardiff . 245907_246650
0 &=laugh .
0 &=laugh .
so . 250251_250704
so the cities allow you to make <more m(en)> more settlers
<okay> . 255368_255867
alright . 257085_257456
okay . 257456_257758
and build up resourses . 257758_258652
<holy> . 258710_259035
<so> this is the city screen . 258954_260045
so you can see the squares around (..) the city <that you can
mkay . 264388_264736
basically . 264978_265362
an(d) <each character you ha(ve)> each member of the
so you've got the four sets of city resourses . 270791_273380
the first one is food . 273415_274576
and there at the moment you are creating two extra food (..) per
yeah ? 279222_279443
okay . 279431_279803
<so> +/. 279768_280140
<the> second one is trade then you've got (..) uhm (...) taxes
you have basically a sort of a se(t) +/. 284431_285464
and then <a certain amount of> uh uhh a certain value of uh
and certain of this can be gone to luxuries and certain goes to
oh no it's not that . 296348_297219
it's how much of the (..) money you get from the trade . 297219_299413
okay . 299704_299948
can i build there another citizen there or something ? 300014_301627
no n(ot) +//. 301527_302026
well what you do is see down way <see the> on the right
you can see there <you got buy> and change . 307583_309464
<oh here> ? 308327_308872
uh where ? 309964_310509
<be(low)> on the right handside . 310719_311567
okay . 311741_312136
yeah . 312136_312345
yeah ? 312449_312658
these are the characters you can build . 312623_314005
so if you click on change@g . 314005_315085
at the moment you can build settlers . 315867_317808
it'll <take> you twenty turns to go through . 317808_318180
<okay> . 318180_319666
you can build warriors for five turns . 319666_320659
so it's easier to get a soldier than a settler . 320659_323918
yeah . 323918_325860
okay . 326627_326999
but basically <so(ldiers)> <warriors can't> warriors can
<so they can> +/. 331623_331911
alright <yeah> . 331911_332550
so .
<fair enough> . 332550_332800
<warrior> can't make another city . 332800_334202
but the settler can make another city . 334202_336265
warrior can attack people but the settler can't . 336265_338577
okay . 339039_339492
so . 339642_339933
what do you think i should do now ? 340095_340850
well i would tend to build a warrior first . 341297_343166
so at least would give you some +//. 343143_343979
cause you get something build quickly . 344130_345628
