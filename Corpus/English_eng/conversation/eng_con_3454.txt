he must be &-um +...
and then when <the &-um> he falls <he's> the boy comes
and he must be thinking oh you clumsy dog you .
and how did this happen down here ?
because he had the &-um jar on him when he fell .
and he keeps <calling him> calling the &-um frog .
and the &-um dog he looked at the bees .

and <the &-um> it falls down .
and the dog he's like uhoh !
and the boy goes up in the hole .
and he's like I wonder if my frog's here .
