not no, you don't have to, but that is the reason why, when we do these box plots, yeah ? 0_7560
you show those five points on the scale . 7560_13748
you mark them as actual points +... 13748_16059
because it's going to be very difficult with a scale like that to actually determine what the exact median, for example, is . 16059_24203
so that's not right, here . 24203_25001
so that's not right . 25001_26355
yes, that's right, but you now have to show what scale the scale that you used on the actual line there, don't you ? 26355_35463
yeah . 35463_35971
so what what scale did you use ? 35971_38346
where did you start ? 38346_39506
on this xxx . 39506_42426
did you start at twenty two ? 42426_43833
yep, twenty two . 43833_44353
okay, so you might go up and say, uh, twos, twenty two, twenty four, twenty six, twenty eight, thirty, all the way up to forty four . 44353_51755
yeah ? 51755_52845
okay . 52845_53348
um, so we don't put we don't put the, um xxx the the five points ? 53348_59606
that's correct . 59606_60406
okay . 60406_61078
yep . 61078_61523
okay . 61523_62301
your box plot is created using that five number summary . 62301_67220
you don't need to show the mean or the mode . 67220_70491
that looks all right, yes ? 70491_74425
but now you've gotta show what these actual points are, right ? 74425_79825
look, let me just run through that with you again . 79825_83448
watch in, please . 83448_84983
if you have created your scale and your scale is starting at twenty and going up to forty four, right ? 84983_96023
so you've put your increments in here, say each of those increments is worth two +... 96023_101823
so we've got twenty two, twenty four, twenty six, twenty eight, thirty, thirty two, thirty four, thirty six, thirty eight, forty, forty two, forty four . 101823_115186
okay, so that was the scale that you elected to use, let's say . 115186_120886
we then mark on that our five number summary +... 120886_124421
twenty two, there it is . 124421_127060
twenty five . 127060_128293
well, if that's twenty four and that's twenty six, twenty five is going to be right in the middle . 128293_132653
twenty eight point five . 132653_134253
if that's twenty nine, twenty eight point five is going to be there . 134253_138045
you understand what I'm doing ? 138045_139645
thirty six, an easy one to locate . 139645_144013
and forty three . 144013_145695
forty three is going to be there . 145695_148685
we then draw in +... 148685_150931
the box . 150931_154301
show the whisker . 154301_159458
yes ? 159458_160801
and then, so that anybody else looking at our graph is able to determine the exact values of those five points, we mark those normally above the line on the scale . 160801_176651
so we've got twenty two . 176651_178618
what is this point here ? 178618_179843
twenty five . 179843_181033
twenty five . 181033_182075
put in a dotted line there, twenty five . 182075_185875
this point here ? 185875_187495
thirty six . 187495_189455
uh, that's a bit wonky . 189455_191973
what was that point there ? 191973_199535
twenty eight point five . 199535_201348
twenty eight point five . 201348_202708
this one ? 202708_205061
thirty six . 205061_208400
and the last . 208400_210998
forty three . 210998_211501
forty three . 211501_211918
now there is no doubt what each of those points is . 211918_217380
you agree ? 217380_218140
yes . 218140_219093
mm hm . 219093_219525
anybody got any questions ? 219525_221516
yes ? 221516_222670
if you just told them the range, wouldn't they be able to determine all of the other values ? 222670_227093
sorry, say that again . 227093_228563
if you just told them the range, wouldn't they be able to figure out the other values ? 228563_233013
well, what is the range ? 233013_235245
um xxx . 235245_237365
beg your pardon ? 237365_238068
oh no, I think I missed that one . 238068_239803
high score minus low score, so what is the range ? 239803_244003
twenty one . 244003_245470
twenty one . 245470_245891
now how is that going to help them determine what the five point summary is ? 245891_251090
all right ? 251090_252251
and like if I had drawn that, if I had drawn that like so and hadn't marked those individual values on the scale +... 252251_263233
who's to say whether that is twenty eight point five or twenty eight point six ? 263233_268746
do you follow what I mean ? 268746_272145
so we want you to show the exact value, twenty eight point five +... 272145_278218
above your scale line . 278218_281378
okay . 281378_282880
yes ? 282880_284090
is this right ? 284090_284911
that looks good . 284911_287688
all right . 287688_288278
yes . 288278_288658
all right, let's check to see how we go . 288658_293210
would you pass one to each person please ? 293210_302006
Tam . 302006_303991
here, Josh . 303991_305281
yes, please . 305281_308368
one each, six . 308368_309985
now, don't do anything with your calculators until we all get started, please . 309985_328216
where have you indicated the exact value of that point ? 328216_334665
oh, so we have to write it in . 334665_336591
above the line, yeah, at there . 336591_339776
so that is twenty eight point five that's it . 339776_342785
is this right, Mister Learoyd ? 342785_343320
for all five points . 343320_344473
that's it . 344473_345535
that's it . 345535_347288
is there anybody without a calculator ? 347288_351136
all right, let's have a look and see if we can get our calculators to +... 351136_382448
verify what we've done . 382448_386588
take the cover off your calculator . 386588_406516
can we clear all the stuff in it ? 406516_422548
just wait . 422548_423940
we'll all do it together . 423940_425618
that way, we'll get to the end . 425618_429240
okay, at this stage you've got nothing on your screen . 429240_440281
all right ? 440281_442001
press the on button +... 442001_445225
bottom left hand corner . 445225_449128
if you've got any statistical data already there, press clear and have your flashing cursor top left hand corner . 449128_463225
everyone at that stage ? 463225_464521
yes . 464521_465126
would you go to stats, press the stats key . 465126_469631
everyone got that screen ? 469631_474695
yeah . 474695_475790
press enter . 475790_477535
up arrow, so that the cursor is on L one . 477535_485830
clear and enter . 485830_492493
you have now deleted all information from list one, yes ? 492493_498333
right hand arrow, bring the cursor onto L two . 498333_505438
clear and enter . 505438_511003
left hand arrow, bringing your cursor back to L one . 511003_518325
let's now enter our data . 518325_522001
this is for the data we're going to work on, your chocolate chip cookie one, right ? 522001_529673
and just before we go on there +... 529673_533233
how many chocolate chips do you think you would need to ensure that you ended up with three ? 533233_540823
twelve million of 'em . 540823_542970
at least forty . 542970_544520
at least ? 544520_545511
forty . 545511_546521
there's no way you could tell because if all the cookies all of the chips xxx . 546521_554330
well let's face it, you know +... 554330_555468
if we if we put these chocolate chips into the mixture and mixed them around, we would expect them to get mixed a little bit and not sit in one corner, wouldn't we ? 555468_563916
right ? 563916_564655
