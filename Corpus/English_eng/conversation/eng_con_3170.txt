yesterday I asked you and it was really hard .
I said +"/.
+" Okay, so what does it mean to measure ?
+" how do you measure ?
what did we find out that you guys know about measuring ?
vanessa ?
you can't leave spaces in between .
okay, Vanessa says, .
you can't leave spaces in between when you measure .
okay, remember what, what we were .
talking about yesterday .
what else do you know about measuring ?
alex, go ahead .
you concentrate .
okay, it takes concentration to measure .
yesterday we talked about some things .
you have to keep a lot up in your head, .
to make sense of measuring .
measuring isn't something you can do without thinking .
good idea, Brittany .
the things that you measure with have, .
um, if like if you were, if you, .
if you were using the books .
to get to line up against the bookshelf .
like, they, all the books they have to be the same size .
okay, so what ever you're measuring with, .
whatever you're using for your measuring tool, .
have to be the same size .
yeah, and so we look for something .
that all comes in the same size, and something .
that we know once we put it down, .
or put it next to the next one, .
coral reefs ?
its not gonna +...
like those coral reef things ?
yeah, coral probably wouldn't be a good measuring tool .
because coral's never, .
it's not the same size or the same shape .
plus you could like, get hurt by it .
xxx .
could you use, like, pieces of paper that are equal ?
you probably could .
and you know what ?
that is what we are going to do today .
how about that Jillian ?
what I'm going to do today is give all of you .
a different unit of measurement .
and a unit of measurement is just um +...
one of what you're measuring with .
yesterday the unit we used, .
to measure the two bookshelves were science books .
that was a unit that we used .
that was, one of them was science book okay ?
just like we've been saying there's different things .
you measure with ?
well, what we usually call those things .
that we're keeping track of when we measure are units .
what I'm going to give to you today each of you .
is a different unit of measurement .
okay, your unit isn't going to be like anyone else's unit .
okay, so which every ones I give you, .
those are going to be your unit, .
and that's how were going to talk about that .
because these are not inches, these are not feet, .
these are not centimeters, these are not yards .
they're nothing like that .
teddy and Brittany knock it off .
nope, no, no .
they not even metric .
because you guys are all so hung up on those words .
you've heard people use to talk about measurement, .
that you don't think about what you do with them .
you just say +"/.
+" oh it's eight inches long .
and I'm like +"/.
+" what does that mean ?
and see yesterday, yesterday we wrestled for for oh .
an hour and half before you guys, .
before you guys could even tell me what measuring was .
because you were so locked into +"/.
+" Oh yardstick .
+" Oh yeah inches, you just tell how many inches it is .
well that's not what measuring is, necessarily .
measuring is what we just talked about, .
about thinking about those things and making sense of it .
so today we're not going to use any of those things .
that tricked you into thinking they were measuring, .
and kept you from thinking .
we're going to use different units .
cool !
okay and you're, you will be the only one using your unit .
and they way we're going to talk about them .
is by using your name .
if I give these green one, green ones to Vanessa, .
that's her unit and those are going to be Vanessas' .
they are not inches, they are not feet, .
they are not yards .
they are Vanessas .
okay so when she's done measuring, .
and we ask her to report to us, .
she's going to tell me how many Vanessas long .
the thing she had to measure was .
now we all Okay .
so that's how we're going to keep track .
of all these different units .
these are Teddys, these are Nathans, .
so you will be working by yourself today to measure .
I want you to sort through some of .
your own thinking about measurement .
I need to see you working by yourself is .
because no one else has a unit of measure .
exactly like yours .
and then we're going to figure out, .
what's the same about all of units, .
what's different about them, what's good about them, .
and what's bad about them .
okay, everybody has a unit of measure to explore with .
okay, what we're going to be doing is, .
measuring some things that are here in this classroom .
okay ?
you need to use your unit of measure to measure them .
what Brittany ?
what happens if you have like a bigger one that, .
um that some goes off the desk ?
that's what you have to figure out .
you have to use what know about measurement .
to figure that out .
because does that ever happen when you're measuring ?
yes, uhhuh .
it does, and that's why today .
we're going to sort of, hmm, .
what do you do when that happens ?
good question .
what if we don't have enough ?
you will have enough .
how to figure that out ?
you gotta solve that problem we had to solve .
a problem like that yesterday, didn't we ?
you've already asked yourself .
the two trickiest questions that you're going .
to have to think about while you're measuring .
what happens if I get to measure something .
that is smaller than my unit of measurement ?
and, what happens if I go to measure something .
that even if I use all my units of measure, .
it's bigger than that ?
and, the third question, what happens if .
some of my unit of measure is left over, .
or hanging over, or goes too far ?
yeah .
okay, I mean, that's two .
is that okay ?
no .
oh, then what did you do here ?
how come it's don't work .
oh, okay .
isn't that just three ?
uh Yeah .
that's three units .
that will work ?
no .
how come this hangs over ?
because I have I don't know .
oh, can you just cut it off ?
no .
well, how much of that ?
how many does that measure ?
I mean Nicole units .
three !
it's three ?
yeah .
okay .
cuz you can't use a half or something .
how come you can't use a half ?
because you are only supposed to use this, .
no halves, .
no halves ?
no feet .
yeah .
so you can't say that it's a half of your Nicole unit ?
is that what you'd say ?
what if you could use a half ?
what would you say at this point ?
um, that's not even a half .
that's not even a half ?
could it be close, close to a half ?
yeah .
or is this a half ?
yeah .
okay, so your unit .
so what would you say if you could use a half ?
uh .
for how big it is .
maybe, one, two, three and half .
one two three and half ?
yeah .
huh ?
actually it's three and half .
it's actually what ?
three and half .
three and half ?
why do you say three and half ?
because that thing .
so where is the three ?
just, could you count it for me ?
three plus a half ?
yeah .
okay .
can you count, can you show us where the three and half is ?
one two three and half .
these are the three of them, then the three is a half .
asratu is running out of his measuring unit .
oh, you don't have enough to go all the way across, huh ?
what are you going to do now ?
not sure ?
how, how many units do you have ?
twelve .
twelve, can you say that your desk is twelve Asratus long ?
xxx .
can you, can you do you, do you think that .
I've noticed that you've lined up all twelve in a row .
so is the desk twelve Asratu units long ?
no .
why, why not ?
because you have to fill up the whole desk .
ah, it has to fill up the whole desk .
so, what are you going to do now ?
well +...
can you just spread them out ?
maybe that'll do it, maybe that'll reach that desk .
no .
why not ?
because you make holes in there it won't work .
it won't work to make holes in there .
xxx .
uhhuh .
why wouldn't, why wouldn't that work ?
umm because it's if you just put one right here .
and like another one right here and another one right here .
you can't say its three Asratus, because +...
because you have to put what ?
put more ?
I didn't hear that last part .
you have to fill up the whole space .
you have to fill up the whole space .
she measured this book, .
uhhuh, .
and she realized that it's almost one Nicole unit because, .
it's one inch .
one but there is a little bit more left, .
so she was saying, she wishes, she wished that ah ahh .
Missus Curtis gave her at least one or two Asratus .
oh yeah, now what ?
so then she if you had two Asratus, .
now what would you do then ?
yeah how would that help ?
one, two and take this one, and go three .
and then take that one and go four, .
and then take that to five and six .
oh, oh I see .
no I'm going to use but needs one inch .
but needs one inch ?
so you used one Nicole unit and one inch unit ?
okay .
and .
okay, how's that ?
half of this .
and half of that ?
how many ?
how many and half ?
just a minute Saad .
what would you write down ?
so, what would you write down as your measurement ?
actually, come here, you can look .
it's a similar problem .
five brians and half .
okay so you found out that something that you were .
looking at and you thought well that would be inch .
if I was measuring the way I used to think .
that was the way I should measure .
and really you found out that ended up being about .
an eighth of a Justin ?
what does mean to say something is, .
to say something is one eighth of a Justin ?
or one eighth of anything ?
what does it mean to say one eighth ?
if you have like a stick like this that's not folded, .
and then fold in half and then fold it again, .
like this, and then uhm you have a fourth of it .
take a fourth of it and fold it again .
what did I just do to Kelly's Kelly ?
fold it in half !
so if I was measuring something and it was this long, .
how would I talk about that measurement ?
half of a Kelly .
half of a Kelly .
okay now Katie said if I want to keep thinking .
to get myself into eighths, if I took that half .
and divided it again, .
so that I had how many equal pieces did I make ?
four .
four, what could I call just this much ?
fourths .
fourths or ?
eighth .
no this .
fourth or a half, fourth or a quarter .
a quarter, a fourth or a quarter .
somebody might say one quarter of a Kelly, .
someone else might call it one fourth of a Kelly .
they would both be right .
katie says that to get eighths, .
you have to take those fourths and divide them again .
so that instead of four equal parts, .
how many equal parts do you have then Katie ?
umm you've got umm .
I took Kelly's, I took Kelly's fourths and folded .
you've got eighths, right ?
these are eighths, so how many equal parts .
would you have ?
eight .
eight .
that's what eighths means, it means .
eight equal parts .
something that you learned, .
even if you're not sure you learned it, .
you learned that umm there are special numbers .
to tell about parts of unit, .
sometimes when you're measuring .
it's doesn't work out perfectly in whole units does it ?
what are those numbers called ?
they are not a whole thing, right ?
one is the whole unit, .
and if you measure the bookshelf that was six, .
that would be six whole units .
but one sixteenth is a different kind of number .
brittany, do you remember the names of those ?
or Katie ?
we talked about it, it's any name for a number .
that tells about part of something .
they are called fractions .
and next week, we'll follow up on this .
we'll use those units to make, um, measuring tapes .
and putting in those, um, .
fractional numbers that we talked about today .
not all of them, just halfs and fourths and things .
but those who want to, yeah, .
can put in eighths and sixteenths, and stuff like that .
though my original intention was only to put, um, .
I thought that by the time we got to measuring tapes, .
we'd put in halfs, .
and we'd measure to the nearest half unit, for kids .
but immediately, the first thing most of them measured, .
they found out oh my gosy, ou know, .
they, they'd look and say +"/.
+" it's not a half, .
that's when they knew, .
that was a strategy they already had, .
I could say +"/.
+" it's like five and half .
but they would say +"/.
+" I know it's not a half .
+" so how do I figure out what it is ?
but all of them did struggle with that idea of, .
what do I do when there's space left over, .
or what do when there's part of my unit hanging over .
how do you, uh, why is that such a problem for them ?
why is that such a problem ?
well no, it's not a problem .
but I mean, that's what they had to wrestle with, .
and think about today, and make a decision, .
and what's good is, .
none of them decided you just forget that .
so I think this, um, this has been, um, .
the best way ever to get my kids talking about measure .
I mean, I've done things other years where, yeah, .
measure this in Unifix cubes, .
and then measure it in dominos, .
and then measure it in pennies or whatever .
and what do you find out ?
and if he says, the table is, you know, two hundred pennies long .
and you said, its one hundred fifty dominos long, or whatever .
how can that be ?
you measured the same thing, and stuff .
you know, I don't ever get the link to real measurement .
this is better .
I mean, yeah, they say things like +"/.
+" Well of course it took more pennies, .
+" pennies are smaller .
so I mean, I get at different units, .
but I don't really get at .
the system by which measurement works .
you know, I mean it is a system, .
and you've gotta learn that system .
and there are those rules, .
that they've internalized already, .
that we talked about yesterday, .
but they didn't even know they knew about .
so now they're applying them in a much better way, .
I think by talking it, .
because they knew what they were supposed to be doing .
they were saying +"/.
+" oh yeah, you know, the rule ?
so even like Justin said +"/.
+" I thought this would be so hard because you didn't give me
but then what he found out is, No, its easy .
because I knew I could think about this the same way .
actually, he could think about it better .
than he could think about an inch .
because he really doesn't have any clue about inch .
he just knows it's a word, and it's about this big .
as we go on, I want to do more talking, .
we just ran out of time today .
about, Okay, what's the best unit, out of all of ours ?
if you could pick anybody else's unit to have, .
when you had to measure the crayon, .
which one would you pick ?
you know ?
and if you could have anybody else's unit which one .
would you want when you measure the chalkboard tray ?
I mean, if they're tr , .
they want the Kellys, when they measure .
I think she's the eighteen incher .
so they want Kellys .
when they measure the chalkboard tray .
you definitely do not want Asratus .
who would ?
um, and I want them to talk about then, why ?
because I don't think they know why there are yards, .
and feet, and inches .
why are there ?
well because the yard is a, you know, its .
first of all it handy, it's three of those feet .
and the other thing, it makes more sense .
I don't want to measure the football field in inches .
