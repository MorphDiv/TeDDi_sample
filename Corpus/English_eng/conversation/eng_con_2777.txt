<mister> Justice , the Jeffries biography of Justice Powell
because you were passionate about Roe <v@l> Wade and he was
at that point , Jeffries says that Justice Powell went out to the
you helped him to go out , and that sort of healed the wounds
do you remember this , or does this strike you as ring true to
I don't remember any of that aspect at all .
I never thought that there was any strain between Lewis Powell and
I haven't read John Jeffries' biography , which everyone acclaims ,
he also recounts that Justice Powell , as a partner at Hunton <and>
and in seeing the torment that this woman went through , this is

I don't know .
by “he” , you mean the justice ?
justice Powell .
well , I certainly have it in my memory .
someone must have spoken to me about it , and I'm sure he must have
I think that Lewis Powell was deeply disturbed by that incident ,
another case that came out in March of <nineteen seventy-two>
now you didn't join that language , but many people thought that
do you remember this decision as having any sort of influence in
well , it must have , because it and one other case were the two
there it was , and as I recall , it was a great favorite of William
when you talk about the doctrine of Roe <v@l> Wade the
you could have gone on the Ninth Amendment .
you could have gone on equal protection .
you went , instead , on due process and the right to privacy .
can you explain a little bit about the reasoning that went into
oh , I don't know whether I could give any explanation that would
the main thing , of course , was to try to get the Court together ,
and it seemed to have an appeal , and that was it .
I put a lot of myself into that opinion , I must admit .
and George Frampton did , also .
did you work on the trimester view while you were at Mayo's ?
I might , but Mayo's had absolutely nothing to do with it , but I
but I never discussed it at all with any physician .
but , for example , the choice of where to draw the line at
well , by reading by doing a lot of reading that summer and
that attitude , for instance , the American Medical Association was
again , all that is set forth in the opinion .
I found it fascinating , and I'm sure it influenced the ultimate
well subsequently , the reliance on substantive due process has
and other people like , including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ,
what's your reaction to that ?
well , Professor Ely , of course , could hardly wait .
he got his first critical writing out before the ink was dry , on
there's no question that it created a stir in the academic
however it would have been decided , a stir would follow .
as far as Justice Ginsburg's criticism is concerned , it's a valid
William <O> Douglas was dead set against approaching the
so with all respect to Justice Ginsburg , I just regard her
she has a right to make it , but she wasn't on the firing line at
so at the second conference , the one which led to your finally
views with details such as the trimester kind of thing ?
no , because I'm not sure it had developed finally in my own mind .
much of that came out in the writing and it came rather easily in
of course , it's been a matter of controversy , but it's also been
at this point you had a new law clerk working on the case .
yes , I think that Randy Bezanson had moved in with the new quartet
Randy , I should call him Professor Bezanson , he's now he's
he moved in and was helpful .
and uh , what kinds of , um when you circulated the opinion ,
oh , I don't know what I was thinking at the time .
I knew that William <O> Douglas would be on that side .
as a matter of fact , he joined immediately and said he was going
and uh , White and Rehnquist , being on the other side , I knew one
and uh , I think both of them wrote .
white , of course , had the lead dissent and was pretty bitter .
it's a bitter dissent , there is no question about it , where he
those are pretty strong words .
I kid Byron White a little bit and say he's done the same thing in
of course , we all do .
but it was an exciting time .
do you remember any justices asking for changes to join the opinion
only one .
potter Stewart asked for the addition of oh , it seemed to me
I think if I had the book in front of me , I could point them out
they're fairly early and have to do with whether a fetus was a
I put it in .
I wish I hadn't , in retrospect , but as soon as I put it in ,
we could have gotten along without it .
but then that's the way we develop opinions .
and Brennan and Marshall , did they come in pretty quickly ?
they came in right away .
and how about Powell ?
I can't answer that .
I'd have to look in my file , but I he wasn't too long , and
the vote we waited for was that of the chief justice .
what do you think was going through his mind ?
again , pure speculation , but the case was argued the second time
October <eleven> , <nineteen seventy-two> .
and I got the opinion out obviously it was easy to get it out ,
the chief justice was the last vote .
I wondered why he was taking such a long time .
I know of some problems he had personally on this kind of an issue
and of course , when it did come out , it was fairly short .
it seemed to me not over two pages .
one thing I was always grateful for in the chief justice's opinion
+" the Court today is not holding for abortion on demand .
I've always been grateful for that .
I think the majority opinion said that , certainly implied it , but
now , why did he delay ?
again , pure speculation .
<mister> Nixon had been reelected in <nineteen seventy-two>
now whether that was a factor in the chief justice's delay , I do
I've never spoken with him about it .
and he may have had a good reason for putting this very
was there some sense that President Nixon would have been
oh , I wouldn't want to say that , but it was so controversial ,
again , whether that was in Chief Justice Burger's mind , I don't
he'd have to be asked .
did you ever talk to the chief about the abortion question , just
no .
no .
and do you think that the opinion in some way drove a wedge between
well , I think it probably was a factor in drawing a wedge between
although he had assigned it to you .
yes .
when you announced the opinion , do you remember what that day was
well , I don't specifically remember too much about it .
Byron White announced his dissent orally , which was fairly unusual
we do it once or twice every year .
I don't recall that Justice Rehnquist announced his separate
it happened to be the day that President Lyndon <B> Johnson

I think the , um +...
did you have the feeling when you announced the case , +"/.
+" this is the biggest case I've written since I've been on the
+, no , I didn't feel that at all .
I just didn't appreciate it at the time .
of course , now over the years it's always been with me .
I'll carry it to my grave , for what it's worth , although I think
but I suppose one catches cases like that , and certainly it has
maybe that's the wrong description ; certainly it's emerged as a
ambassador Sol Linowitz , when I was visiting with him one day ,
+" this is the kind of case every justice should have once in his
and I hadn't looked at it in that respect .
well , the result was , of course , that the mail started to pour
did this begin immediately ?
it began within the week , anyway , after Mister Nixon
then the newspapers turned to this .
but as I recall , I can see our officers at their respective posts
they had nine baskets in front of them , and they'd go and put the
I've retained all of that mail .
I still have it , thinking that some day some <P@l h@l D@l>
I would think it would be an interesting psychological analysis .
when did you see the first demonstrators ?
well , it seems to me about ten days , a week or ten days after it
I had a commitment for a speech in Iowa City no , in Cedar
the first time I was ever picketed , but certainly not the last
so as you were flying out , you weren't saying to yourself , +"/.
+" there might be some sort of demonstration about this ?
no , I didn't expect it .
no one had warned me about it .
no , I'm usually advised when there's going to be a demonstration
on occasion this happens , even to this day .
people like to personalize Roe against Wade as though it's a
even many professors do that .
you haven't done it , Professor Koh , but some of your colleagues
how did you feel , reading all this hateful mail and being picketed
were you discouraged or angry ?
I wasn't discouraged , I was , uh it was an experience I'd
and , of course , it continues to this day .
the mail right now has dropped off , but every now and then
even now people feel as strongly about it , and they're not all on
I've read most of the mail .
there was so much of it at the time that there are several boxes in
some of the most beautiful letters I've ever had , on the other
what would they say , these nuns ?
they would express gratitude for the decision , that there were
there was a feminist side to a good bit of it , of course .
it's an experience in human emotion that was educational for me ,
were you ever reduced to tears by reading these letters ?
almost .
almost .
even to this day , of people who have had the experience of
now did you ever meet either Roe or Doe ?
not to my knowledge .
whether they've come up in a line somewhere , I don't know , but
one of the shifts that's been charted in your thinking about this
was that a conscious shift on your part , or how did that come
I'm not sure it's a shift at all .
I've been accused of making a shift .
certainly in writing Roe against Wade , I was particularly careful
but I think to this day there ought to be a physician's advice in
I don't believe in abortion on demand .
it may be , however , that the issue of Roe itself is receding into
the votes were there , I think , in the Supreme Court , and no less
there's a very interesting argument made by Charles Fried ,
it's interesting to read that brief .
but the Court has never gone that far , although , as I say , if it
when you retired at the press conference at the White House , you

and you said , +"/.

is that the way you felt about it at the time that you were
at the time , I don't think I felt much of anything in that respect
I think it's a step that had to be taken .
I make no apology for Roe against Wade .
as I say , I think it was right in <nineteen seventy-three>
have you ever thought about what your career on the Court would
well , I assume it would have been less controversial , or
I suppose all of us live in a certain state of controversy for one

so in the end , you're happy about the experience or , it's not
oh , I think that is a correct statement .
I wouldn't want to go through it every day or every year or
no .
as I said before , I think it was right when it was decided ; I
I think maybe there's a little element of contribution to society's
how did your family feel about this furor ?
I don't know .
of course they've seen the criticism , and they've seen the
I think that they share my feeling that it was right .
we've never discussed it at any length .
our daughters have seen picketing and gone through with it .
our middle daughter is a lawyer herself .
there's never been a note of criticism on their part expressed to
apart from the language that was added at Justice Stewart's request
oh , a question of that kind is often asked .
would you decide cases differently , or this case differently from
I suppose I'd write a case today differently from maybe the way I
I think I'd craft it about the same way .
it worked , and it seemed to be welcomed among those of us on that
as I think I said before , if not I'll say it here , that I put a
at the beginning of the opinion , right at the beginning , you say

this is often cited as another example of your putting a personal
how did you come to the decision to include that passage ?
well , my memory is a little faint , but it's the kind of thing
it violated , of course , Justice Black's argument to me , which I
+" harry , never agonize in public on opinions as to how difficult
and that's precisely what I did in this case , but I thought of all
it was an emotional issue .
it is an emotional issue today .
and all the things that I've mentioned , one's background , one's
and why not say so ?
it wasn't easy .
and no one else on the Court objected to that .
I don't know what Hugo Black would have done , but no one else
I'm glad those words are there .
do you think that Roe <v@l> Wade was a liberating experience
maybe so .
maybe so .
I don't know exactly what you mean by liberating , but for those
I think it was a worthwhile experience .
in other places , I've spoken of the fact that when one comes to
and that here's an opportunity to think about things that he's
and that as he thinks and develops and decides case after case , I
do you think it made you feel that you had nothing to lose by
I felt obviously there was nothing much to lose by putting in those
nobody's ever really criticized me for putting them in .
other justices joined it , and there we were .
how do you think Roe <v@l> Wade changed your thinking about
you had mentioned in your confirmation hearing your concern for the
but after Roe , there was much more in your jurisprudence +...
uh , really sticking up for the underdog .
do you think that that grew out of Roe ?
well , it may have .
I've never really thought about it , but it well may have .
after all , there are a lot of women that desperately need help at
what was the response from the medical community , your friends at
well , I think the medical community , as every other branch , was
by and large and I was interested in this I think the
I've never had , as I recall , any strenuous letter of objection
I don't want to say that as a positive fact , but I think that's
how do you think the case affected your relations with some of the
for example , Justice Brennan or Justice Marshall ?
it probably surprised them at the start , particularly Justice
I'm sure they felt a sense of relief at not having to write it ,
I think there was that element .
did they ever console you about the mail or the criticisms , the
no , because I think they were subjected to similar abuse .
we take it .
one gets it for almost every type of opinion that he writes .
did the case affect your relationship with Justice White ?
well , I'd like to say it didn't .
it didn't , as far as I was concerned , toward him .
I was always a little surprised he was so adamant about it , but ,
after all , he grew up in not the easiest of circumstances in the
I just never discussed it with him .
he wrote .
he wrote with forcefulness , obviously feels very strongly about it
chief Justice Rehnquist , I think is a little easier to analyze in
I've never been able exactly to determine why Byron White feels the
we've never discussed it on a one-to-one basis .
in the farewell letter when you left the Court , Chief Justice
+" you will be remembered as the person who wrote Roe <v@l>
how do you take this ?
well , I was amused by it , because he , as chief justice , wrote
the chief always seems to write those letters when somebody steps
but there it was .
I can't escape it .
it's going to follow me around .
at first that bothered me .
it doesn't bother me anymore .
when did you think you started to feel more comfortable with it ?
oh , when I sat down , thought it through , that this is part of
if he doesn't like controversy , perhaps one shouldn't think about

but I guess it was Holmes that said , +"/.

and maybe that's where lawyers belong .
at least that's where they find themselves if they haven't thought
in the years after , did you ever think that Roe <v@l> Wade
well , yes .
there was a period , as I mentioned a little bit before , today ,
I still think the votes were there for it on an initial counting .

+" I can't retire if Roe <v@l> Wade is still in jeopardy ?
well , I'm sure there are those who will accuse me of doing that .
I can count .
I know how old I am .
maybe I was in kind of a dangerous position .
I didn't want to make a record of longevity as an active jurist .
holmes has that record , I think .
and I didn't want to stay so long as to have the Court , through
I saw Hugo Black struggle in his last year .
I didn't want to go through that .
on the other hand , I know how old I am , and people to this day

but I think when one is in his mid-eighties , he'd better be aware
in the Casey case , when Justices Souter , Kennedy , and O'Connor
did that come as a surprise to you ?
well , somewhat .
roe against Wade was having some rough seas , rough going in that
justice Kennedy came in and talked to me about it , told me
as I said before , I think we're in a position to carry on and get

do you think you rose in the stature of your colleagues as a result
did they begin to turn to you , to look to you , on this issue ?
you're going to have to say that again .
let me be sure I understand your question .
do you think that after this opinion came out , your colleagues
on this issue , yes , I suppose .
whether they took me more seriously on other issues , I'm not in a
but it's been an experience , no doubt about it .
in the balance of the <nineteen seventy-two> term from
oh , pretty much the latter , I think .
that's a long time ago , of course , but there were opinions that
one never wanted to be the last one getting his opinions circulated
I can rightly say I never held the Court up , although there are
but it's a hectic time of year .
the Court utterly ruins the beautiful spring months here of May and
the pretty spring months are gone by the time we reach adjournment
let me ask you about another case that came along in that term ,
the Court was asked to apply strict scrutiny and came very close to

right .
in time , you became more sympathetic to this view , although at

well , it turned out that it wasn't , of course .
but the Court has held short of saying something like gender was a

maybe it's just as well that it hasn't , but I suppose if this case
that's speculation on my part .
were you a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment ?
well , I don't like tinkering with the Constitution very much , and
well , I can say , no , I wasn't a supporter , because I think the
I would fear the stricture that a constitutional amendment would
I think the Court did well and handled it well and didn't really
of course , it sounds wonderful .
let me ask you one final question .
as a result of this opinion in Roe <v@l> Wade , which upheld
did you ever find that ironic ?
did that make you value your privacy more ?
oh , maybe it's a little ironic .
we certainly lost our privacy , there's no doubt about that .
I always felt somewhat chagrined , as far as our family is
I'm sure it has affected their lives somewhat , because they've
privacy is pretty valuable , and we , as a family , lost it , no

I'm glad there is that aspect to it , and I hope it stands for the

as I've indicated in prior answer to your question , I think the
as I've said publicly many times , it wasn't much fun , it wasn't

so many people use that term ; it's the wrong term .
but it's been a fantastic experience .
I'm indebted to the nation for the privilege of having had it and
that doesn't mean there haven't been moments of pain every now and
thanks very much , Mister Justice .
we'll continue here next time
