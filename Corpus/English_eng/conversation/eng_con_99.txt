No you 've done .
Mm .
you 've done very well Have n't you really Your first your first
Yeah we did well but erm we should n't have like you learn by your
Yeah .
erm and now the tax man has hammered us so hard .
Yeah .
that we 're really struggling .
Yeah Yeah .
And we 're really having to struggle to sort of make ends meet .
Yeah I know what you mean You it 's a diffi it 's difficult .
It 's wrong int it .
just striking up that balance int it .
Yeah .
Is n't it really .
And of course now they when we originally moved in here we asked
Yeah .
and nobody had paid rates and they would n't pay rates until they
Yeah .
Anyway when the accountant came in to do the books he said er oh he
Yeah .
but of course it had kind of stirred up a hornets' nest Next thing
Yeah .
three thousand eight and of course well Neil said there 's V A T I
I did n't I did n't you know I do n't .
You know .
Yeah .
Er anyway so tha that 's sort of you know made .
Mm .
a big difference That 's suddenly four thousand a year we 've to
Yeah .
I mean if it 's crippling us is this place .
Yeah .
If it was n't for this we could be it would be quite good .
Yeah Yeah .
But what can you do there 's nothing else about .
No it 's that 's it And a lot of businesses up and down are er are
Yeah .
Some very sailing very close to the wind .
Yeah They 're all finding it hard are n't they .
Well there 's less and less work and the work that does seem to be
Yeah .
you know it 's negible whether you can make anything even if .
Yeah .
you get the work .
Yeah And then of course er money is floating round very quickly No
Yeah .
and we 've had invoices outstanding since October .
Yeah .
So Neil said well these invoices were n't forthcoming so I said to
And you have to fund it .
So we asked for twenty thousand pound upfront .
Tt .
So anyway and they said and before we wi we get this twenty
Yeah .
Erm the twenty thousand eventually arrived no V A T You know .
Yes .
and all this sort of things So of course we were getting a little
Well tha that 's always the catch is n't it .
You know .
The last one .
Yeah So we actually wrote down erm th the equipment that we were
Yeah .
By them .
Yeah .
And we sent this letter up to them Well we 've had their director
Yeah .
and if you do n't want the work we 'll take it elsewhere and all
Mm .
Erm .
Puts you off does n't it .
Well I mean what on earth do you do .
Yeah Very difficult is n't it .
You just well Ne both Neil and I have sort of felt well to be quite
Yeah For what you make at the end of the day on on somebody 's .
No it 's not worth it It .
Yeah .
well it the running the business is n't I do n't think because by
Yeah .
you know the V A T man wants his money I mean the V A T man 's been
Yeah .
and I still have n't got the money in .
Yeah Yeah .
You know Everything 's against you .
Really V A T's I think and I think it should only be paid when it
Exactly .
have been cleared rather than always paying .
Exactly .
for that quarter .
Yeah .
even if you 've not got paid .
Yeah Exactly Erm mm I do n't know whether there 's any way round it
Yeah .
does seem unfair .
Yeah That 's right .
I mean now there 's a couple of people quibbling about actually
Yeah .
There 's still six hundred and odd pound outstanding Erm I ca n't
Yeah .
Erm the funiculars they 're quibbling about the final payment .
Yeah .
About them being late and everything else Er you know it 's just a
There 's extenuating circumstances like that .
Oh dear .
though is n't there As Neil said .
Well yeah .
Changes in specification .
Yeah .
er equipment coming in late er .
Yeah .
you know I mean .
They do n't seem to want to know though I mean Neil 's tried to
Yeah .
But all you know they 've just not listened to him .
Yeah .
So .
Yeah .
I guess it 'll .
It 's er stal stalling they 're .
Yeah .
cos that 's all it 's doing in n it .
Yeah Well solicitor said she it sounded to her as if there 's
Yeah Yeah .
And they 're stalling all the time .
Yeah Yeah .
But erm you see they suggested going down for a meeting he 's up to
Yeah .
And .
Yeah .
he ca n't honestly spare time to go down there .
It 's costing you money is n't it .
Well yeah .
And chase your own what 's due to .
Yeah .
you That 's that 's the .
And we know you 're gon na have an argument So is it worth it .
Yeah Yeah .
I I I personally feel that give it to solicitor and let her deal
Yeah Yeah .
just not worth the hassle Alright .
Yeah .
that 's gon na cost .
Yeah .
but but I mean you can only make it worse by like you say you 're
Yeah .
you 're not gon na get anywhere .
Yeah Yeah All gets .
I mean .
a bit acrimonious does n't it And er .
Yeah Do n't it .
er that sort of thing starts happening .
Oh it 's painful .
Yeah .
It really is painful .
Yeah It 's getting ever more difficult is n't it Doing .
Yeah .
business Ever more .
Yeah You just I th all this bumph about sort of trying to help
No No I know that .
They do nothing at all .
Yeah No it 's er as you say all all the cards are stacked i in .
Yeah .
such a way that it makes it ever more difficult .
Yeah The trouble is see you know you 've nobody you can go to you
Yeah .
to all this and do something about it higher up .
Yeah .
I mean they just keep hammering and hammering and more and more are
Yeah .
Alright th the saying in the paper they 're talking about stopping
Yeah Yeah It 's a .
In the meantime there 's more and more going bust every week .
Well the trouble is a lot of these mps and people on these
Yeah .
so it 's not in their interests to push this through The longer
Yeah .
like that .
Yeah .
er you know the better it is and particularly when you look at the
Yeah .
is is no big business is n't it .
No that 's true I mean maybe I should go and see local erm mp or .
Local M P .
whatever and and about the rates .
Yeah .
And see you know if they can do something about that maybe it 'd be
Yeah .
Bu cos we 're actually the only ones that have their rate bill
Yeah .
So you know they 're .
Yeah .
just expecting us to pay .
Yeah Yeah I would .
And it 's Yeah .
That 's what they 're there for .
Well yeah that 's true .
Whether you 've voted for them or not .
Yeah .
And you know in fact .
Yeah .
you pay your taxes and and .
Yeah it 's very true that .
you know it can have .
I might do that .
Yeah Because if if they 've singled yourself out it 's obviously it
No it 's not Well I said well I 'm not paying mine until somebody
Yeah .
And have to pay theirs .
Yeah .
But erm I suppose next thing 'll be a court demand and how d' ya
Yeah .
So .
It 's all a worry in n it .
Yeah int it Oh Headache stuff Never mind .
Yeah Yeah .
Never mind .
Oh well keep your head down .
Yeah Yeah At least there is n't the same hassle as there was at
Yeah .
I mean alright yes you sort of have worries but most of the time I
Yeah .
It 's only just recently that we sort of starting our de we 've had
Yeah Or at least like .
So .
with this a all the benefits are you get them personally do n't you
Yeah Yeah .
Er rather than .
Yeah .
doing the same amount of hours er and somebody else benefiting .
That 's it Yeah that 's it .
Yeah Yeah .
I mean it 's like his car for instance I mean that 's always been a
Yeah .
you know .
Yeah .
And er of course that 's like a dream come true for Neil so .
Yeah .
that 's .
Yeah .
why we want to make a success and he do n't lose it all .
Well you know you 've got to have er benefits of of taking a course
Yeah .
otherwise you know .
Yeah .
what 's the point .
That 's it .
What 's the point I mean i .
That 's it .
It 's not that people want to get rich it 's just that you make a
Yeah .
what you like doing and that 's it .
Yeah .
You know .
