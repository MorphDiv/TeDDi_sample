so they're redoing the three copies of their strip . 140_2940
because they really copied their strip . 2960_4810
made a different strip . 5920_6780
where's that paper that we cut the guys ladies . 6870_15150
it is time to dress for recess . 20380_22190
you may leave all of your things right where they're . 22450_24630
so what do you think . 26180_26860
&-uh I mean Sarah Sarah and Katie had to kind of redo it . 27000_30340
but mhm . 30360_30820
I noticed earlier you kind of had to back them up a little bit what
what do you think that is about . 35790_36620
well they're they're working are handling this easily . 37430_40140
and they both &-um and they haven't had to slow down for each_other
so instead_of like Sarah being paired with someone who needs more
so when I saw them pair up that was okay with me because I knew
but yeah they just simply got going they knew what to do . 66820_69630
they had thought it through they were interesting . 69710_70900
and they zipped ahead . 71020_71870
and but <they didn't> they didn't fall apart either one of them
when they they had they said . 77440_79150
why can't we do screw over these . 79660_80900
but it was two thirds of each of the three core spurs that was
it wasn't just one piece . 84660_85630
so I was like . 85700_86140
nope you're gonna have to make three new strips . 86260_87620
I won't throw these away or anything . 87640_88590
we'll save them and see what else we can use in four . 88640_90500
or we'll explain explain to the group that you had made these .
but I'm just gonna take (th)em right outta your way . 93800_95300
so you don't look at these again . 95320_96190
'cause that was what their mistake was . 96630_97580
they made one and made the other two just like that one . 97600_99790
so they had three none of which matched their original strip . 100180_103180
because the first one they did that was supposedly a copy of their
didn't copy their strip . 106470_107340
so it wasn't because they weren't working accurately or carefully .
they were . 111030_111500
they did a very nice job and thought through the pattern . 111710_114140
they just &-um were thinking of it too easily . 114270_117420
they looked at those first two they had done and just repeated it
and then they did that two more entire strips worth of times . 120220_123220
and said . 123240_123470
huh . 123900_123990
and they never would've noticed &-um that their design didn't match
they had just made a different strip . 132830_134900
they had done an arrangement that wasn't their original plan . 135270_138510
so they handled that well . 138700_139750
and they also knew they had plenty of time . 139800_141430
if anyone else had already been finished they would've both handled
particularly Sarah Sarah would've wouldn't have I think Sarah
if anyone else had been finished now she would've still had to fix
but she would've tried to refuse to fix that . 158140_160700
and the fact that they recognized their miles ahead of any other
they know that the the strip pools should be finished tomorrow
and they know that unless something goes terribly wrong they'll be
totally I'm completely finished . 172630_173910
and theirs will be the first one hung up . 174110_175430
and . 175580_175670
mhm and they're pleased as punch . 176660_177980
mhm so how did annex then today I I forget . 178040_182340
yeah we they're still designing their first strip . 182500_184700
ah so I have a feeling when their first strip is designed I think
I mean this is not accurate enough for anyone to use to plan a
so I don't how we'll handle handle that . 204790_205950
it's hard to say . 206670_207300
huh . 207320_207380
it's hard to say . 207790_208380
I'm not sure I actually think because more of it's done . 208540_210460
it's Kevin's I think that still has part of the tough . 210480_212610
yes you may is Alex's because that's gonna have to be what they use
they're not gonna have time to design three more strips let alone
&-um because I think they both understand that you can rearrange
but just the recording takes first of all making the two-sided Cor
it's just a it's speed a speed thing . 239860_242700
and they're both small motors wise . 242720_244500
they're both behind I mean that is a struggle that is a need for
neither of them have developed to the point yet where they have
mhm drawing and coloring especially in these tiny little squares .
yeah &-um is hard for Kevin and Alex so in one sense it's good that
and Paul and Brian are still recording the first four square . 269150_271700
you don't have that kind of lag . 272460_273710
I think that would get frustrating if they were &-um if they were
but in another sense I think that &-um I think we'll just &-um
&-um well actually they won't they've designed a strip that looks
same . 312780_312900
when you flip it actually to make mistakes . 312920_317450
did you zip this today . 318300_320180
only then you have to be able to do it . 320200_321790
okay . 322070_322310
okay . 322670_322780
but this is only day 'cause I'm . 323220_324590
oh good . 325020_325350
is your other zipper almost fixed . 325400_326660
yeah . 326790_326850
this is . 327260_327470
a different isn't it . 327560_328650
oh cool . 329180_329550
it can sit but . 329940_330830
I'll help you with this one . 331110_331870
when your new one is all fixed . 331950_333180
that's it for . 333330_333780
you'll be able to handle every day . 333800_335070
great . 335690_335940
Ashley &-um so actually maybe it is very good . 337740_339930
so it won't matter if they plan <copy flip flip> copy flip flip
yes . 352500_352660
but these are play . 353660_354430
snow but that they'll be talk to Mrs Gilbert when you get outside
not me you're you're right . 361540_362820
they're not shoes . 362840_363470
they are boots Amanda and we wet boots all day . 363550_367230
&-um so yeah maybe that's just maybe it's good that that
because I mean then no matter what they think they're making in
you know if he says . 377360_377820
well I was making a flip . 377840_378940
he will be or if he says I was making a copy of it . 379420_382700
and no matter what their pattern is it will work out . 383090_385260
and then when they're all done maybe we can talk to them about
'cause so far I think theirs is the only strip like that . 399190_403180
I think they have the only strip that looks the same after a flip
mhm &-um because yeah because even theirs will look different their
yeah because the corners were reversed they they have the only
yes . 421110_421220
Nicole &-um you should be on your way outside . 421350_424900
I'll talk to you after recess . 425550_426510
thanks Danny bye . 427850_428530
and another peer . 429720_430180
I'm choosing the groups of three for the final quilt project . 430470_432820
I let them choose pairs . 433080_434190
uhhuh . 434490_434680
too many like personalities gravitated toward each_other . 435860_438980
which is okay in a way if you're Speedy Gonzalez but it's not okay
if you are someone who has a hard time staying on task and stuff .
now some . 448380_448590
of them were good mixes like Brittany she keeps us on to right on
she gets ahead of them . 453780_454430
but then she waits . 454520_455230
and she coaches him along . 455320_456310
uhhuh . 456560_456750
and others . 457260_457550
but you know there are some who are just yeah like Nicole and Mandy
not that either of them will shy away from being directive . 470010_472500
but I mean in terms of knowing just what to do and how to know when
and you just say . 478320_478780
fine . 478800_478980
it's the top . 479000_479460
and you keep working instead_of . 479590_480900
no it's the bottom . 481010_481470
no it's the top . 481620_482220
well I want to call this the top . 482490_483540
no I really think we should call this the top . 484360_485980
I don't know if you heard that discussion today or not that went on
I mean they didn't fight or come to a extent . 490370_492300
so but they just spent all that time on that one issue . 492320_495420
should we call this the top of the strip or this the top of the
and I was like . 500840_501260
okay ladies . 501950_502530
&-um so yeah Alex and Kevin will get out this morning . 503400_507620
and I think at noon they'll have to come here . 507660_509260
and and I am sure at the end of noon they'll just barely have
but just the task of getting that quilt design down on paper will
but I can't skip that stage and just let them start making their
it so they'll know what's supposed to happen when they arrange
but I do want them to finish . 536540_538300
so . 538460_538550
so so what's the next step after this in the quilting stuff . 539180_541710
I don't know . 542040_542350
I mean <I have to> I have to look again . 542820_544180
and we do have we do do another whole final quilt project where
a much more complex one . 551570_552660
though we learned that you can divide one of those squares into
or we talk about &-um dividing that square into two rectangles a
and
