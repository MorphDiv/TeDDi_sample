++ and you would like fold it +... 40683_41530
okay &~s . 41530_42148
and now these two these two +/. 42148_44393
so can you use your finger to draw an imaginary line where the line
+^ where's the line that divides their strip in the middle to make
0 . 51826_52676
okay he went right down the long way the middle of the strip . 52676_55091
Sara had shown us the short way through the middle of their strip
so their strip is symmetrical . 59343_60548
hmm is that quilt symmetrical ? 60548_63775
+^ yes ! 63775_64331
both ways that xxx . 64331_66995
let's see where would that quilt divide so that it would be
+^ who can use their finger to trace a line of symmetry for the
how could I fold their <whole quilt> so that it would be
<there's two ways> . 85876_86921
Nicole can you show me one way ? 86921_87610
and then if there are more ways I'll let I'll let other people show
Nicole how could Kevin and Alex fold their quilt so that it would
0 . 96686_104811
I know it's kind of hard to reach . 104811_105051
okay did you see where Nicole +//. 105051_106873
um can you do that one more time Nicole ? 106873_109103
+^ everybody watch . 109103_110285
0 . 110285_111283
right there &~wh and then I would be folding it down . 111283_113485
do you see ? 113485_114003
so right across the middle we would be folding the top down on to
would they match ? 117753_118775
yes . 118775_120168
yes they would, yes they would . 120168_121818
who sees another line of symmetry in that quilt ? 121818_124931
Amanda . 124931_125731
careful . 125731_127838
careful of the cords . 127838_129003
how could I fold the quilt that Alex and Kevin made so that each
I know with that table in the way it's kind of hard to reach their
that way ? 142913_143503
0 . 143503_144350
um okay just a second let me um let me pull the table out of the
can you show us where you were +//. 153703_154970
0 . 154970_156450
okay but where would the middle line be ? 156450_157285
where would the fold be ? 157285_158506
I know you want to take this part to fold it over on to here +... 158506_162638
0 . 162638_164001
oh yep see where she's going xxx right up through the middle of
do you think she's right ? 169283_170365
yes . 170365_171398
yep . 171398_171765
what about um a diagonal fold like corner to corner ? 171765_176005
no . 176005_176565
yes . 176565_177181
no . 177181_177586

yes . 178686_179670
yes . 179670_180208

no . 186846_187830
no . 187830_188498
no ! 188498_189146
no because no because uh +/. 189146_194795
because that would mean the fold was going to be here guys and
Nicole's and Dani's you could do it . 198195_199645
uh to fold this corner from here to here it would mean the fold
no . 206428_206828
no because look right here <where those> where those parts came
I see another place where it it couldn't work . 212043_215381
just a second um um I need to get a yardstick to show you this . 215381_221141
um Amanda just said +//. 221141_223375
actually this will work better than a yardstick . 223375_226641
Amanda just said that she thinks we could do a diagonal fold on
or you could do it xxx . 241226_242156
an she says it would work that way too . 242156_244643
can I let them look at this way for a minute ? 244643_245940
do you see why it would work with their quilt ? 245940_248976
yes . 248976_249555
see the green would touch the green the red square would touch that
when I lay it on Alex and Kevin's in that same position their along
it's sort of like those um designs you've been creating on the
that wouldn't have been um that wouldn't have been how you made it
well parts of it are symmetrical but not all of it . 289538_294171
well like here and here it's symmetrical diagonally just right
and Amanda wants me to show you this too . 301338_303550
she's seeing that this quilt has both diagonal lines of symmetry
let me see hang on here and just hold the ends . 308773_312380
do you see how that does work ? 312380_314420
great ! 314420_315415
okay going back to our main idea guys and ladies what I'm
first of all we'll wait for everyone to join the group again . 322831_326995
