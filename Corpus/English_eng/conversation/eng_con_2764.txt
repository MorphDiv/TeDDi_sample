this is the Justice Harry <A> Blackmun Supreme Court Oral
my name is Harold Hongju Koh .
I'm a professor at Yale Law School , a former law clerk to Justice
the subject of today's session is the justice's last term as an
<mister> Justice , could you tell us about your retirement
well , there were a lot of factors , of course , that enter into a
I'd been thinking about it for a good while , and I knew how the
I didn't want to set any records , so far as staying on the Court
I think the record for an active justice is held by Oliver Wendell
I think the next one was Chief Justice Taney Justice Black , I
I realized I was getting up in there .
reaching the age of eighty-five and still being an active justice
I didn't want to fall apart and eventually be asked to retire .
so I thought that maybe it was high time .
when did you finally make the decision ?
did it happen over a number of months ?
yes , indeed .
probably over a year anyway .
I had told the president when we were at Renaissance Weekend on New
new Year's of <nineteen ninety-four> ?
yes , <ninety-three ninety-four> .
I thought I'd let him know in advance so that he could he thinking
I was fairly certain at that time that this was my last term .
where did you tell him ?
we were in one of the sessions that Renaissance Weekend has , there
I had arranged to meet him at a certain time .
the session was still going on , but we both went out and sat on a
did he seem surprised ?
no .
had I been he I wouldn't have been surprised , knowing how old I
how did he react ?
in no particular way .
I think he was pleased that I had told him that I was thinking
the president of the United States has so many things on his mind ,
that was it .
we let it go until latex when the formal announcement was made .
I told him I didn't know when I would make it formally and make it
how did you pick the day that you actually made the announcement ?
I didn't pick the date specifically although April <sixth>
justice White , the year before , I believe-and this is pure
I knew that with March passing by it was time that I move along and
it just happened that April <sixth> must have been at the
it seemed to me to be a pretty good time .
when did you tell others ?
others on the Court , your clerks ?
I did it at one Friday conference .
I remember Justice Marshall , the year or so before , when he made
+" say , Fm going to turn in my suit .
it caught everybody by surprise a little bit .
I didn't do it exactly that way but told them that this was my last
did they say anything ?
did they respond in any way at that time ?
oh , yes , sure .
they always respond .
and then they wrote letters I have them here actually that
how did your clerks and your secretaries react ?
I haven't asked you , but you maybe could tell us something about
well , I called them in one day .
I don't remember whether it was after breakfast .
I can still see them .
I asked them to come in the chambers , and we're all standing
the silence was deafening for a little while .
they were very nice about it , made the usual cluck-clucking sound
just one of those things to do , and we carried on-from there .
in making the decision , who did you take counsel from ?
no one in particular .
Dottie and I , Dottie being <Mrs> Blackmun , had talked
Sally , our lawyer daughter , our middle one , I think had been
+" what do you want to do ?
+" work this way until you collapse ?
+" you ought to spend some time with the family .
and so forth .
I think that Dottie was in favor of it .
it would affect her life considerably .
but it didn't upset the family particularly , We sailed along .
were there any times before this that you felt close to making this
yes , for the last year and a half , or two years maybe .
because the years were mounting up I knew I'd have to do it
I wanted to take the step when I felt , at least in my own mind ,
I would rather retire when people thought I could continue than to
what do you remember of other retirements ?
which happened in the way that you thought shouldn't happen or
did these have any influence in your decision ?
it didn't have any particular input into my decision .
I remember how difficult it was for William <O> Douglas at
of course , he was stricken when he was active and sat for a while
I remember they had a ramp for him to be brought up on to the bench
it was hard for Bill Douglas , I think , as Thurgood put it , to
he loved the court , and he wanted to be there and participate in
I didn't want that to happen to me .
the others , I have no particular recollection about the others ,
each does it in his own way .
there are famous stories , historically , about deputations of
did anybody ever go ask another justice to retire , or suggest it
of course , I don't know because I wasn't chief justice , and I
it was largely his responsibility .
of course , the Field situation is a very noted one .
I think that's the place where he said , +"/.
+" yes , and a dirtier day's work I never did .
something to this effect .
it must be an excruciating task to do that and tell another justice
I guess that happened to Holmes .
actually .
but to the credit of Oliver Wendell Holmes , <Junior> , he
but all of us , I suppose , the natural tendency of a person is to
he doesn't look upon his failing facilities and accept the fact
some commentators have said that you waited until you thought that
well , there are those comments , from I think more than one , and
I don't know how true all that is .
maybe the advent of Mister Clinton as president of the
I'm not sure that it was .
he at least was sympathetic to Roe against Wade .
we had decided cases that were part of its progeny .
made me feel that the precarious situation , if it was precarious ,
when did you first meet Bill Clinton ?
I met him first , as I recall more than once , at Eighth Circuit
the Eighth Circuit was the circuit that was mine in the sense that
we had annual conferences and when they were held in Arkansas ,
Dottie and I came to know them casually just as we did other
that was the first time .
then , of course , later , when we were invited to attend and did
we met them during those weekends .
at times , I was assigned to a seminar where he and I were the two
would you say you had private conversations with him ?
<h_a_b> : Oh sure , sure .
did you think he was going to be president ?
not initially , but you never know .
one of the most interesting Renaissance Weekends , of course , was
he was president-elect at that time .
but it didn't seem to affect him particularly .
it gave me a chance in the final seminar that we had , and we
to have a president-elect as a captive audience was a great feeling
I could say things , and he couldn't answer me until it was his
it was a lot of fun .
do you remember what you said ?
yes .
I told him that I hoped there would not be any litmus test for
that's what we needed and what we wanted .
when you made the formal announcement , how did you convey it to
I wrote him a letter .
I have a copy of it here somewhere .
it's a little hard to decipher , but it makes sense to lawyers ,
but in any event , no later than the last Monday in September .
I thought it would be inadvisable for +/.
me to work on cert petitions all summer long when I would have no
that was delivered , as I recall , I gave it to Joel Klein , who
deputy White House counsel .
I didn't send a messenger down to the White House just addressed to
I sent a messenger down with a letter to the president but with
and the next thing I knew was a call from Joel that <Mrs>
I took my whole staff with me , the clerks , the messenger , and
and what happened when you got there ?
the President and <Mrs> Clinton most graciously waited for
we visited with them for a while .
they were very nice to us .
the rest of the group stayed out and , I think , passed the time of
and then , at an appropriate time they were all invited into the
we had some photographs taken .
and then it seemed to me we were taken into , I've forgotten the
the Roosevelt Room ?
+, yes , the Roosevelt Room , where to my surprise the press were
I believe there were in that group , it looked fairly large to me ,
I hadn't realized that it was to be televised because I stood with
he made the announcement to the press .
I think I responded a little bit .
there's some photographs about this .
of course , what the press wanted to do was to hold an
they asked one question , which was the obvious one about Roe
I answered that and then cut off all other questions at the time .
what was your answer ?
I said essentially that I thought that Roe against Wade was correct
it was a decision that had to be made if the country was to go down
period .
and then when you left the White House you went back to the Court .
yes .
and what happened then ?
I don't remember .
I went to work I guess , more than anything else .
I don't remember anything in particular happened .
we just went back into chambers and carried on .
I think there was a press conference at the Court .
at least you are pictured at the press conference raising your arms
maybe that's where the press conference was .
I'd forgotten whether it was at the White House or there at the
yes , at the end they were applauding ; they were all very nice and
how did you feel about your relationships with the press over the
relationships with the press , of course , are up and down and
even at that time there were some very critical comments by certain
there seemed to be no bitterness expressed , and it almost put me
the kindness of people is something that sets me blubbering at
if they're nasty , I can stand that ; my hide is so thick now .
but when people are kind is when I quiver a little bit .
they were kind that day .
in the days immediately after the announcement , did you get lots
yes .
we were actually overwhelmed with an unanticipated avalanche of
calls .
a lot of people called , good friends , and my secretaries kept ,
I just couldn't speak with everybody .
the mail still is piled up .
there are some letters from April that I have not yet acknowledged
we're peeling it off folder by folder .
a lot of friends , a lot of people in the academic life .
a lot of letters from unknowns , actually , they sign their name ,
and some of it , of course , is pretty critical .
I would say it runs about seven or eight to one favorable comments
I've always had over the years a certain amount of hate mail .
in that very press conference the president and I exchanged jokes
+" I'll take over his hate mail if he'll take over mine .
mine took a little different tone from this point on , I'll leave
+" why didn't you do this twenty-four years ago .
and this sort of thing that people like to write and get it off
some of the nastiest letters I've ever received came in at the time
some of the most beautiful ones too that I've ever received have
do you remember any of the nice ones ?
do any of them particularly stick in your mind ?
yes , depending on who wrote them or something like that .
of course , I think one should look on the bright side , not on the
it's an experience I never thought that as a law student or even a
part of this is the penalty one pays for public life .
you're going to get criticism ; that's the American way , and one
did you think back to when you were appointed and the differences
you must have had a press conference back then .
yes , yes .
I thought at the time , and this was <nineteen seventy> ,
one's sitting out there at a table all by himself .
there's a ring of senators around with the Democrats on one side
they question you by seniority .
down one side first , then the other side .
it' bothered me a little bit until all of a sudden it dawned on me
once I realized that , I could relax a little .
I think the experience of that hearing before the Senate Judiciary
I almost don't have to look at the transcript .
I remember exactly what happened and what each senator said .
this was political hardball at the time .
I thought it was not an easy day .
of course it was nothing as compared with what Justice Thomas had
about a month after you announced your retirement , Richard Nixon
I wonder how you felt about that ?
yes , he did die about a month later .
I never felt very close to Mister Nixon .
as a matter of fact , the first time I ever spoke with him was when
I had heard him give speeches , that kind of thing , and had seen
but I'd never spoken with him until I was called from Minnesota to
the attorney general at that time made that call .
I visited with him and with the deputy attorney general .
was that John Mitchell ?
that was John Mitchell as attorney general , and the deputy was
they examined me rather carefully , I thought , and then turned me
the two interrogators were the first one was Johnnie Walters of
Dottie and I learned to like Johnnie Walters and Donna , his wife ,
they became friends although we haven't seen much of them .
the other interrogator was no one less than William <H>
he asked a lot of pertinent questions .
ever since then , on certain occasions , when he and I disagree ,
+" you made a mistake in approving me back in <nineteen seventy>
and he always allows as how he did make a mistake .
we josh about that back and forth .
what do you remember of your own conversations with Nixon ?
after that interrogation , which lasted for about an hour ,
I think my memory is correct , but no luncheon was served up .
I was rather hungry , but sure enough at two o'clock , or just
at that time one entered by the southwest door .
we drove up , and the guards there recognized the attorney general
<mister> Mitchell obviously didn't want to give names
but he got us through , and we went on into the White House and
I well remember that conference with Mister Nixon .
it struck me as being a little unusual in some respects because
and they allowed as how I could sit in a chair at the end of the
+" would you like a cup of coffee ?
“well , sure” , If I could get a cup of coffee out of the White
so I sat there silently while these other two spoke .
but what struck me was the fact that here were two former law
there was none of that during that conversation .
it was wholly formal .
the President would say , +"/.
+" <mister> Attorney General , what is your recommendation
and Mitchell would say , +"/.
+" <mister> President we recommend that the judge be
I thought this was rather nice but certainly most unusual .
so it went , and then there was a little bit of conversation as to
at the time one of the Apollos , I've forgotten whether it was
and it was then and there decided , , right in my presence that the
and it happened that they got back safely , I think over the
but the decision was made to make the announcement , I believe , on
that's what happened then .
did you ever meet Nixon again before he died ?
yes , once .
after I was sworn in on the ninth day of June , <nineteen seventy>
in those days , contrary to the current system , there was no big
I can remember some of the presidents coming to the Court for the
<mister> Nixon did this with , I think , when Chief Justice
well , to go back to your question , Chief Justice Burger suggested
and we did .
he was very cordial .
he didn't ask any particular questions at that time , and we
I think there were one or two photographs taken of that call , and
and that's the last time I ever spoke to Mister Nixon .
in all the intervening' years , I do not recall anytime when he and
did he ever come into the courtroom ?
I don't remember that he did , but , of course , we always attended
we the Court did .
so I saw him in action at those times .
but I don't recall his coming to the Court on any occasion .
I ought to be careful about .
when Justice Powell and Justice Rehnquist were sworn in , they were
he may well have come up , but I don't recall .
coming back to your own retirement .
did you ever make any suggestions about who your successor should
no .
no .
I don't know whether I should say this .
it comes close to a different answer than I've just given you .
I was visiting with Joel Klein one day , and I said , +"/.
+" Joel , it's always struck me as being rather curious that when
+" why didn't you do this ?
because we knew who the sure-footed judges were and who the ones
and if they were persons that were not judges but had appeared
and it seemed to me that the members of the Court were a good
Joel allowed how he had never heard of anybody calling .
so after that , he did call and ask me for thoughts about a number
the other names that were being bandied about at the time ,
to that extent I did make comments .
did you have strong , positive feelings about any of them ?
no , I couldn't say much about any of the others .
other than Richard Arnold , whom I knew well and who would've made
but I'm sure that had the president made a selection from the heart
good judge , nice person , good chief judge , and just a delight to
did you know Breyer ?
well , to an extent .
the judge had been a participant in the seminar at Aspen that
and he was out there , I would say , as a participant four or five
at the end of the first week , the chairman of that committee
+" we're having a vital committee meeting , you must come back .
and so he left .
he didn't stay the full two weeks .
but having been there , as is always the case every year , we were
that's the way Aspen operates , you're on a first name basis ,
did you ever talk to him after your opinion upholding the
mistretta ?
mistretta .
no , I never talked to him about it , no .
what did you think of him ?
did you have a strong impression of him ?
oh , he's obviously able , articulate , in some respects Bostonian
I think he was a fine judge on the First Circuit , a good chief
how interested he was , how compassionate he was , how interested
time will demonstrate that to us .
but , he's able , he's fully qualified to sit on the Supreme Court
when the announcement had all been done and then you had to go back
no , not really .
actually , a little less difficult than in previous terms .
I think you can remember from your own experience that May and June
we finish oral arguments in April and then devote the rest of the
it takes a bit of doing to get those things out .
we always aim for the first of July or , in any event , by the
sometimes that's a hard deadline to meet .
this year it didn't seem too difficult .
that , in part , was because we took fewer cases this year .
but the ones that were assigned to me to write seemed to roll off .
I was worried about one or two , whether they'd roll along and get
we got them out .
in that respect it was just like any other year , you were working
did you feel at any point any sense that you had made the wrong
no .
this question has been asked of me a number of times over my
+" is there some case where you wrote and wish you hadn't written
and the answer to that is definitely no .
there are one or two instances where I probably would have written
there's one case , and I can't quite give you the name of it ,
apart from that I have no feeling of having decided or having made
tell me about the last day on the Court and how that went .
well , of course , this year was different from other years .
for me it was a much more emotional year .
knowing it was the last one .
the others didn't have that feeling ; I did .
of course , after twenty-four terms , the last one I suppose is a
I do not deny that there is some pain in this transition from being
but I think the last arguments sailed off as they all do .
I felt a little inward quiver when I walked off the bench at the
knowing that while I'd be back on the bench for announcements and
it's just like closing the chapter in one's life and moving on to a
and the last day of the term , how did that go ?
as I recall , this was the thirtieth day of June this year , and we
the chief justice had the Madsen case to announce , and so I
so that was a little unusual ending the term with a voice raised in
I had the feeling , I may be completely wrong in this , that the
we all have a right to read a dissent , of course , if we want to .
but at least I remember , I thought he kind of huffed off the bench
but that was the end of it , and the chapter was closed .
your exchange of letters with the Court , the farewell letters ,
the letter that was signed by all of the justices to me was read
that's a letter that normally is written , is composed by the chief
and I'm sure that Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote this one .
and they signed it , and then I had a response to it .
those too were read from the bench .
to my amazement , the Washington Post published my response the
it just put it in the box , published it .
when did you write it ?
when did I write it ?
sometime in advance of that day .
actually in advance of receiving the letter from them .
I knew a letter would come in ; it always does .
I took a little time in writing it .
I didn't want to dash it off and not have it in the form I wanted
so maybe a month beforehand .
went through a few drafts and fixed it up .
did you have visitations from other justices ?
yes .
yes , David Souter came down .
Ruth Ginsburg , to my surprise , came down , into my chambers , yes
then of course some letters came in from most of them , not all of
and then they were plagued with what the media does all the time .
they want comments from the remaining justices about the one who
there were those , they're usually syndicated , some papers publish
they're in my files .
this is actually a very exciting term , apart from your retirement
one of the things that you just mentioned was the arrival of Ruth
what had you known about her before she came and how did you find
well , let me speak generally about the term .
I think the term as a term was rather ordinary .
we didn't have any major blockbuster cases like Bakke or the
this is not to say that the cases were not important .
every case that comes is important at this level , It's
but apart from that I thought it was rather routine , and I haven't
it affected me more than the others because I knew it was the last
did you start the term knowing it would be your last term ?
well , pretty well , pretty well .
and certainly by mid-term I knew it was because Renaissance Weekend
the thing went along generally .
of course it seemed a little strange for me to sit to the right of
I remember others preceding me who had sat there , particularly
with it , of course , comes the assignment power to the extent that
that comes along .
I suppose the term was notable for the fact that it was the first
it was interesting to me to watch the reactions between the two .
they're very different .
they're very respectful of each other .
I didn't sense any political leaning that was demonstrated , that
justice Ginsburg had argued a number of cases before the Court as
she was an able advocate , she knew her way around , did a very
I suppose I was a little surprised at her appointment as I am with
I mean , how does any person get to be appointed out of the
the president had certain things in mind I suppose .
she , Justice Ginsburg , is able and articulate , she knows her way
she's a little late in conference sessions .
she and Justice Scalia are always the last to come in .
it annoys the chief justice on occasion .
I don't believe that Justice Ginsburg is aware of his annoyance ,
who hadn't come in yet .
as we go on to the bench , the three in the center go first and the
to my surprise she , Justice Ginsburg , asked a lot of questions .
that prize had always been taken before by Justice Scalia .
but whether she wanted to emulate him or to out-do him I don't know
justice Souter , who sits between them , I think in self-defense
one time in a couple of related cases that were argued in tandem
justice Souter had about ten or so in the two cases .
the result was often that counsel never could get his case argued .
one of them always said , +"/.
+" now counsel , before you begin your argument , will you answer
and from then on poor counsel never got to his notes .
it was a little disturbing at times .
and I'm told Justice Ginsburg , when she was on the court of
we should probably wrap up this session .
after they can change the tape , we can start with the term as i
