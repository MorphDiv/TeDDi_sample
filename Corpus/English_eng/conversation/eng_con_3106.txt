thinking of another way . 0_1160
they could have arranged that course square to get a symmetrical
no . 4740_4880
is there another way . 5610_6350
they could have . 6480_6780
yes . 7780_7870
what . 8300_8390
do you think Justin what do you think . 8440_9780
okay . 12280_12380
if you had done that . 12420_13190
and then where would the red square of their course square end up
yeah . 17030_17090
right there . 17490_17980
and then how many lines of symmetry . 18100_19950
would that design have . 20000_21110
two . 21980_22130
uhhuh . 23290_23370
actually look closer . 24320_25980
d mhm . 26990_28030
right here down right through the middle diagonally that way . 31140_34900
remember the other red square would be here and then right through
four four . 40990_42990
ways this this way would be four ways . 43040_45310
yeah . 45510_45570
different way . 47590_48150
okay . 50270_50540
okay . 51390_51630
let's Justin can you slide back . 51680_53060
we're gonna let Sarah show a different way . 53090_55500
she'll pull out way as_soon_as she arranges . 56440_58140
but it was yellow touch blue . 58260_60050
and the other there'd be another yellow triangle right here . 61160_64750
and it would have the same triangle . 66020_67680
okay . 70120_70340
so she wants you to imagine the fourth core square . 70430_72310
making finishing that yellow part of the center . 72730_75220
and be and then the other yellow triangle next_to the other one . 75500_79180
this is also a four way . 80630_81750
yeah . 82420_82630
it's <this way> this way . 83630_84870
and then going <this way> this way . 85300_87510
and it could be . 90710_91420
no no it doesn't . 92420_93450
oh the . 94540_94900
oh wait . 95040_95470
blue square . 95670_96220
in this one . 96300_96830
you're right in the way . 97070_97860
she has it now . 98300_99070
that's why meant the last time Blue Square went over the yellow and
the . 103400_103680
let's see . 103730_104150
let's put it back to the way it was with the red in the center . 104200_106210
yeah . 106860_106990
check that one again . 107580_108020
no . 113580_113750
because the Moose square . 113800_114740
and you're right . 115100_115820
it wouldn't . 116030_116390
but . 117380_117510
there are ways Brian and Alex do you agree that if you had had
is it possible to take your core square . 128250_130330
Sarah and Katie can you just slide back . 130699_132190
thank you . 132370_132640
is it possible to take your core square . 133300_135220
and &-um and get a symmetrical &-um get a symmetrical two by two
yeah . 147610_147790
and here we were gonna put one in exactly the same position . 148190_151900
right . 152070_152160
that is the way Alex and Brian wanted to show you that they were
but it is symmetrical . 156550_157510
and you found other ways to suggest to them . 157530_160020
&-um ways that they could have made a symmetrical two by two design
huh . 166750_166920
that you can &-um hold it this way . 169000_171660
mhm . 172630_172830
and &-um this way . 173710_176990
okay . 177920_178010
and was that Corer that you started with really asymmetrical . 179610_182510
it was like a symmetric . 183400_185540
not symmetric . 186300_187000
okay . 187660_187750
alright . 188620_188870
&-um what Teddy's do . 189620_191980
&-um can you leave the those two pieces . 192020_193550
and Teddy's just put her in that position . 193600_194920
and Nathan can you move the the two by your right hand away . 195260_199300
can you slide those for me . 199720_200630
Teddy made a difference . 200810_202030
two by two design . 202280_203110
is that two by two design . 203370_204550
symmetrical . 204700_205300
yes . 205740_205830
yes . 206220_206250
it is how many ways . 206800_207750
<two two> two . 209160_210520
okay . 212270_212380
can't . 218320_218480
because &-um these ones two would fall over . 220770_224330
then these ones would fall over . 224970_227220
oh can you lay on all six again . 228910_230640
please . 230660_230850
well you had them . 231780_232120
I thought &-um symmetrical meant that there was a way to divide it
where would the halfway point of those six be so that they would
is there a way to divide those six squares in half . 245640_248520
one way . 249860_250090
one way . 250710_250880
do you see it show . 250960_252840
yep . 253200_253290
are you thinking the way . 253990_254730
Katie just showed us . 254780_255640
Justin yeah . 255710_256680
yeah . 258490_258640
if you folded it that way it's yeah . 259200_261810
okay . 262130_262370
thanks . 262420_262600
guys Jenna what'd you find . 262770_264450
out . 264500_264880
okay . 272850_273090
she's gonna have to say what she just said in a bigger voice . 273140_275770
but the people sitting close we're gonna have to make sure they're
what we can . 279810_280170
here Jen go ahead . 280320_281120
Jenice . 281140_281470
this way . 284090_284530
okay . 286630_286720
can you flip it back up . 286760_288410
but we see your whole two by two design again . 288820_290640
okay . 291610_291770
what_about &-um the other way is Jenna's design symmetrical if we
yes . 298720_298850
no . 299560_299660
because look at the blue section . 301810_303730
right . 303990_304180
nevermind . 304950_305360
Brittany says . 305780_306080
okay . 306140_306310
what did you find out . 306850_307760
Jillian . 307780_308050
&-um that way . 309300_313170
okay . 318410_318560
can you put it back in there . 318690_319410
can those green and red ones . 319760_321060
can you move those out_of the way . 321220_322240
because those weren't helping you in this test . 322290_323750
were they because is that course or symmetrical . 324120_329670
yeah . 330980_331120
yeah . 331760_331870
and we were only starting with ones that weren't symmetrical for
thanks . 335010_335390
Willie I bet we'll use those soon though . 336780_338360
thank you Jillian Dust talk to us about the two . 338610_340710
that it could go <this way> this way also this way . 347200_353540
okay . 354440_354680
so how many lines of symmetry does that . 354790_356870
two by two have . 356890_357760
two . 358140_358310
two lines of symmetry . 358870_359870
a diagonal way would work on your design . 360040_362150
would it . 362340_362510
orange . 364660_364900
okay . 367910_368150
Kelly what did you find out . 368690_369830
okay . 371820_371910
the same thing for you that we did for Brian and Alex Alex . 372620_375630
in the circle . 377340_377830
and I need . 378240_378580
you paying attention as everyone shares . 378640_380550
we can imagine if you show us <what you> what you have started
okay . 386930_387100
where would the green square on that . 387120_389670
extra courseware . 389770_390620
if you had found it . 390640_391260
Kelly where would it be or in the middle . 391400_394390
can you see how &-um Kelly's two by two would be symmetrical . 394900_399580
I don't know or wait . 400680_401470
<would it> would it . 401670_404590
I'm looking I need to slide your design . 405700_407500
we in the center Kelly so that we can . 407540_409460
I . 411250_412230
it's okay . 411600_412110
and it can be gon . 412370_413860
yeah . 414310_414470
well it can't be because here . 415230_418690
right . 419680_419950
is there a way she could get it so that it was symmetrical though .
how would she do that . 424660_425430
yeah . 426040_426190
if you do a . 426510_426830
okay . 427130_427270
so Kelly do you see what . 428700_429470
okay . 429630_429810
slide back . 429920_430420
Kelly do you see what Justin did he wanted . 430710_432940
instead_of you had the green squares all in the center was your
but the way you had it was like this . 437500_439430
so that if we invited it the red square was &-um going to be folded
so by so what he did watch what he does . 450260_452430
he flipped and turned . 454340_455260
the green square is still in the middle . 455540_456690
but see how the red square is here . 456760_458220
so that &-um the red and the green squares would match up . 458660_461500
so if you got the green square in the middle here you just have to
if you had a green square . 467140_468100
here and a red square . 468160_468980
here . 469000_469110
look at it . 469470_471350
can be di . 471460_472030
that matches why do you say that . 474270_478900
&-um Nicole . 480320_481100
here . 483550_483620
no . 488100_488240
because they'll be touching red red . 489390_493370
I'm still hoping we find some that can be divided by originally . 509660_512620
okay . 513190_513360
thank you . 514289_514700
Kelly we're gonna leave that . 514720_515690
right there of_course . 515890_516700
that's fine . 516919_517309
here . 517549_517640
Ashley did you &-um . 518190_519950
okay . 520750_520850
I can see them there . 521100_521940
she definitely had an asymmetric core square . 522309_524700
and you put them together in a two by two design . 525380_528950
right . 529090_529300
yeah . 529940_530030
is it symmetrical . 530660_531660
that one's kind of curling up . 534170_535540
it's sort of hard for me . 535660_536700
&-um to see here . 537100_538420
can we &-um can we see they need to be the edges of (th)em need to
so I'm just folding this one so that we could lay it way had it . 546400_549750
and then this one I'll just fold this little extra bit of way so
okay . 557590_557680
&-um is what you have there . 558380_560890
symmetrical . 561150_561740
yeah . 562810_562980
show us where we could divide it . 563500_564900
so it would match exactly . 564970_566030
&-um I don't think so . 568620_573380
I think one of them when we were folding it and straightening it
excuse me let Ashley move them around as we adjusted her so that
she wants to make some changes in our design . 585940_587940
diagon . 593180_593550
okay that way . 595340_595830
but what_about the other half has to be able to go diagonally too .
if you divide it diagonally
