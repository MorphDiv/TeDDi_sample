graphing, frequency distributions, histograms, and graphing means
ok, great .
ok, first I wanted to ask if you had any questions about anything
um, no I don't think so .
it was clear ?
uh huh .
stuff you've been exposed to ?
yeah, I had it in stats, but I had to go back and review the
ok .
well tell me then what a population is .
a population, um, like a group of people, um, a group of subjects .
then what would a sample be ?
a sample is like, let's see, you take a portion of the population
alright, so you do think it would be pretty safe to say that most
ok, well what are some of the obvious reasons ?
well, the population would be too big .
uh huh .
it would take too much time, it would be almost impossible to try
&=mumbles ok, there are two main reasons for using the stats or two
um, it's used to describe the population .
yeah, right or it describes the sample .
yeah, yeah .
and that would be called what kind of stats ?
it would be descriptive .
yeah, sure .
and then inferential would be you use what you learn from the
right .
in other words it's important to remember that the results of an
so, findings rarely come from a whole population, and sort of the
ok, um, the inferential then to kind of expand on what you said
how applicable to the real situation or to the whole population
ok, do you see how those are kind of interrelated ? 46256_49353
uh huh . 49353_49871
in other words you use the descriptive statistics to sort of
if you can describe and summarize it, then you can you use your
ok, alright, um, what then is a frequency distribution ? 69831_77318
a frequency distribution is, you put like you list the scores in
you just list the scores and then from that you can get the sum,
ok, that's not exactly it . 108750_114061
basically what a frequency distribution is, it's just a um, count
uh huh . 128876_129324
in other words, you have your, they often refer to your dependent
how many people scored two's, three's, four's, five's, and so on . 145611_149378
so it's basically just a tally or a count of how many subjects
ok, alright, um, what I'd like to do is sort of come up with a
so, let's just suppose for example that you were looking at, um, a
what is the client's outcome ? 192145_193968
and so it would be for our measures, we'd have the high empathy
that's our independent variable that's the manipulation, one group
ok, so in other words you have two groups . 208113_212913
x@l one, they get low empathy, and x@l two gets high . 212913_225656
ok . 225656_230235
alright, if we wanted to, let's say our measures, for our dependent
um, how much have you improved in therapy ? 242705_255281
and rate it on a one to ten scale . 255281_258524
ok, so that's our dependent measure, and our independent measure
so if we wanted to do a frequency distribution . 267741_272108
for our scores, Ok, let's say in our low empathy group we had x@l
ok, how might we draw a frequency distribution of that ? 293413_300020
this would be the frequency ? 300020_301260
sure . 301260_303420
0 . 303420_309355
and, um, would you put x@l one ? 309355_312915
0 . 312915_314298
ok, what you usually want to look at in a frequency distribution is
ok . 321498_322010
so what you'd want to do is put each, yeah, empathy goes down . 322010_325441
there, one mark for each one down there . 325441_334726
0 . 334726_335175
0 . 335175_344686
ok, so now there's two ways that we could do this, or picture the
do you know what those are ? 353558_354828
a bar graph and a frequency . 354828_362446
they call it a polygon . 362446_363453
yeah . 363453_363685
the frequency polygon or the bar graph . 363685_365428
in other words the bar graph is . 365428_367388
is a histogram . 367388_367956
ok, great . 367956_368756
let's start off then with the polygon . 368756_370853
ok, three . 370853_377208
how many three's do we have ? 377208_378341
one . 378341_378990
let's do one variable at a time, Ok, so how many of this do you
one . 410826_411145
0 . 411145_411888
seven . 411888_415576
ok . 415576_418065
0 . 418065_419896
ok, how would it change if we had two three's ? 419896_422808
it would be there
great, ok, now draw the line . 437818_440185
0 . 440185_440970
ok, so there we have a dependent measure and we have an independent
ok, let's look at the other one . 447593_448816
umm . 448816_451168
xxx . 451168_458791
0 . 458791_459338
just do a dash or dotted line where they overlap . 459338_467778
ok, good . 467778_472681
now, try it in a histogram form . 472681_477656
do we just erase ? 477656_480505
0 . 480505_480785
ah, yeah that's fine . 480785_482936
I'll go ahead and give you some more measures . 482936_488025
let's say . 488025_490001
go ahead and try that . 490001_499615
ok, two three's, it would be in the center with the bar over; Yeah .
ok . 508696_515368
if you want you could draw like two bars on there and make the
like a solid bar and then a stripe . 538088_542813
0 . 542813_546476
0
ok, super . 568061_587116
and that just gives you a kind of a way to compare what are the
well looking at that it looks like possibly . 593463_597398
xxx . 597398_612088
ok, alright, just one last time from last week . 612088_621276
the independent variable was the what from last week ? 621276_626185
the independent variable was how much the improved . 626185_629650
ok, that was the dependent variable . 629650_631281
ok . 631281_631825
the one that you manipulate or change is a quick way to tell which
the dependent was the one with a score on the test . 639801_644481
ok . 644481_645465
ok, um descriptive statistics then . 645465_656671
we've talked about descriptive and inferential statistics . 656671_659808
so descriptive statistics usually fall into two categories, Ok, do
ah, descriptive, um it would be central tendency and &=mumbles .
right, right, so what then is central tendency ? 682103_685200
what would that be ? 685200_685926
um, the central tendency is, I know it's the mode, the median, and
but what are they all kind of doing ? 693838_695590
ah, like telling you what the average score is, what the average
average not as in the mean, but what is sort of the representative
which score appeared most, um, which score was the middle score . 708733_714348
so in other words the central tendency sort of tells what the
every score is figured in . 726566_735295
ok, ah, so you just named the three types . 735295_737886
xxx . 737886_744085
ok, the mean you sum up the scores, like you'd say three plus three
which would be . 755063_755965
six . 755965_756885
alright, and so it's just the average . 756885_761628
what about the median ? 761628_763150
the median is like the number that has fifty percent of the scores
ok, in other words if we had something that looked like this, where
0 . 777301_778430
it would be between five and seven . 778430_779621
ok, alright, the mode, what is that ? 779621_794723
the mode is like the score that appears the most . 794723_799080
ok, like we have here . 799080_801031
seven and nine . 801031_805528
in other words, there's two modes . 805528_809816
uh huh . 809816_810031
so, it's possible that you have two modes &=mumbles . 810031_818558
ok, so when might the median or mode be a better measure of central
I mean, usually when you think central tendency you think of the
when there are extreme scores . 834776_836250
the mean wouldn't take that into account . 836250_838721
it would make it seem like the mean was more than it would be . 838721_846370
let's say you had a plot that looked like this . 846370_850718
0 . 850718_855053
well, if you just had that &=points:a then a score would be more
ok, the book, used the example on page one hundred and thirty
it said it could look like, you know it said if you had a
the average person had more income than was actually the case . 889380_891451
ok, um, Ok, what then if you wanted to draw some of these, what
um, bimodal . 906636_911195
bimodal distribution . 911195_915378
since the mode is the most frequently occurring score it would be
0 . 924330_925233
ok, alright . 925233_930180
what do you think of this one ? 930180_932988
do you remember what the normal distribution looks like ? 932988_940908
it's just a bell shaped . 940908_943021
bell shaped curve . 943021_944300
0 . 944300_946283
ok, so where would the mode be on that ? 946283_954091
the top . 954091_960663
the median ? 960663_961046
in the center . 961046_961486
0 . 961486_962255
the mean ? 962255_965510
it would be like the score in between, like the center about . 965510_971110
the mean would be the same thing . 971110_973790
0 . 973790_974285
ok . 974285_974741
by definition, a normal distribution is one in which the mean,
that's what makes it normal . 982021_983695
but like if you, on our bimodal distribution that we had drawn a
0 . 993908_997540
ok, here were our modes, here the mean and median were here . 997540_1014523
0 . 1014523_1015698
but with a normal, they're all the same . 1015698_1018786
and of course it's possible to have a distribution where they're
0 . 1022501_1022910
in other words in a skewed distribution the mode would be where ? 1022910_1027466
the top again &=points:a . 1027466_1029178
sure, and then the median part would be about here &=points:b since
and the mean would be around in here &=points:x . 1036658_1052666
so it's possible to have them all different xxx . 1052666_1066411
ok, ah, we've covered central tendency and what is the difference
so what is our other . 1086861_1087795
variability . 1087795_1090955
variability, and what is that ? 1090955_1093546
um, it's like the standard deviation . 1093546_1100850
like how variable the numbers are . 1100850_1106506
um, I don't know what I'm trying to say . 1106506_1118066
I know it's like the standard deviation, how variable the numbers
well, let's think about it a minute . 1133978_1135110
if it's variability that means the numbers vary . 1136191_1142005
yeah, how the numbers vary, how the scores vary . 1142005_1145750
so what might be another word for that ? 1145750_1146525
how they deviate ? 1146525_1153356
ok, deviate or different xxx . 1153356_1155108
um, the standard deviation is like the standard, um, deviation of
uh huh . 1188901_1189475
and, um, the formula xxx . 1189475_1196786
see if you can tell me . 1196786_1197745
basically in words, the standard deviation indicates the average
so what then is the variance, or how is it related to the standard
well, I know like variance you take the square root of it to get
right, and so the standard deviation, Ok, the variance is the sum
it's kind of looking at the xxx average distance . 1236225_1249170
it takes into account each of the single raw score's deviation from
alright, for example, a standard deviation of two point thirty six
so that leaves one more measure of variability that the book talked
do you remember ? 1285095_1287523
the extremes, the range . 1287523_1305586
oh, yeah . 1305586_1306201
I remember . 1306201_1306753
what is the range ? 1306753_1309583
it's like, um, when the scores fall within a range of numbers like
sure, it's just the difference between the highest score and the
xxx ok, alright so we graphed some frequency distributions, and we
so in a frequency distribution you're kind of just looking at the
but you can also graph means . 1362388_1366473
why do you think we would want to do that ? 1366473_1370465
um, to graph means ? 1370465_1375481
it would probably, it would make it easier to see, I mean usually
the mean would like narrow it down . 1390168_1393040
in other words the mean would make it a lot easier to look at, well
yeah . 1399246_1399895
first of all, literally and simplistically it would make it easier
second, it would make it easier for a person looking at it to
it's kind of easy to get lost xxx so to speak . 1410038_1412558
and then thirdly and related to that it kind of summarizes the
summarizes or represents a whole distribution then it's just a
so in other words, in a sense it gives you a sort of essence of all
ok, so it looks like our mean is about six point five
maybe seven . 1455520_1457805
so, if you wanted to calculate it you'd add up the scores and
uh huh . 1463510_1464451
let's say the approximate mean is equal seven, that's just our
up here it looks like about five maybe a little more than five
how could we go about graphing these means ? 1493515_1497296
would you do it kinda the same way as you did . 1497296_1512801
ok, first of all look at it . 1512801_1515393
your independent variable again is . 1515393_1518543
empathy . 1518543_1520296
ok, and it needs to go on which axis ? 1520296_1523416
this one . 1523416_1525095
that leaves what, the X axis ? 1525095_1527520
xxx . 1527520_1536071
well, no, the score values . 1536071_1540028
the scores are how much they improved . 1540028_1548961
it's scores on this test but what it's theoretically tapping is
so we've got client outcome as our dependent measure and empathy as
so, we need to draw little lines or graduations . 1568680_1573271
well, we only had two, high and low . 1573271_1580126
xxx then you need to put graduations for the scores . 1580126_1600808
ok, alright . 1600808_1609421
so we're guessing our approximate mean for our low empathy group
seven ? 1622045_1622596
that's not right . 1622596_1624420
our data is not supporting our hypothesis x@l one is seven . 1624420_1634243
ok . 1634243_1635325
0 . 1635325_1636148
and x@l two is, now wait that's right . 1636148_1649045
where did I get three ? 1649045_1657555
that should be a five . 1657555_1660155
so x@l two is seven ! 1660155_1666010
seven would be the high empathy . 1666010_1678273
you got to call me on these things . 1678273_1691328
and that would be a five instead of a three . 1691328_1694596
let me get my head cleared . 1694596_1704260
so we've got x@l two our high empathy is a seven, and x@l one our
if you wanted to do it in the line graph form you need to draw a
and if you wanted to do it in bar graph that would be what . 1719590_1728821
0 . 1728821_1752181
so, we graphed the means . 1752181_1758340
and you can see in our frequency bar graph
alright, did you pay any attention to what was going on on page one
turn to that for a second . 1810333_1813638
can you see how both of those are, neither one is actually a lie or
but do you see what they've done ? 1827678_1828716
they made the increments a lot different such that it looks a lot
uh huh . 1837295_1838133
and there's other ways of doing that too such that the data look
in other words, using their cola as an example . 1841740_1841756
if you had cola a and cola b and the percent, forty percent chose
ok, that's one way to look at that . 1883093_1884378
another way to make it look more dramatic would be to top the
it's the same size increment but just showing the top increment . 1891538_1906018
or you can do something really dramatic like they did in the book,
if you wanted to make this increment by ones . 1916920_1939473
cola a is way up here, everybody is drinking it, and poor cola b is
so any way, the reason you want to keep this in mind is so you'll
uh huh . 1971063_1971541
so, just to review then . 1971541_1974461
what are samples and populations ? 1974461_1977990
um, population is like the whole or entire group and a sample is a
ok, in other words subjects scores have some kind of common
ok, and two reasons for usig the two types of stats would be ? 1998788_2006756
um, two reasons would be to describe and to infer . 2006756_2013171
to describe would be descriptive and inferential would be where you
in other words you use your descriptive to describe what happened
how certain are you ? 2036971_2041683
how well does it apply to the population and how certain you are
ok, um, so it's important for you to know that the results of an
ok, um &=mumbles . 2063700_2071960
a frequency distribution then is what ? 2071960_2077558
um, like the scores put down . 2077558_2083150
the independent variable is on one line and the scores on the
the frequency of the times they occur, you graph those . 2097271_2100390
you usually look at your dependent measure . 2100390_2102381
yeah, dependent . 2102381_2103148
you put your dependent measure down here
ok, so it's a count or a tally of how many times, the occurrences
ok, um, and the frequency distribution can then be presented
um, a histogram and, um, a polygram . 2134693_2140715
a polygon . 2140715_2141551
similar to the line graph . 2141551_2152175
ok, and, um, descriptive statistics then looking at those in
um it would be, um, central tendency and variability . 2164526_2179248
ok, so, in other words, descriptive statistics usually looks at
how much they vary, sort of, and in a sense how much they're
ok, so the variability looks at the difference, the discrepancy,
ok, and so the three measures of central tendency you usually think
the mode, the mean, and the median . 2211053_2213140
which are ? 2213140_2213830
each one of 'em ? 2213830_2216061
uh huh . 2216061_2216718
the mode, the mode is more like the score that occurs the most . 2216718_2220166
uh huh . 2220166_2220566
and, ah, the median is the number if you count from the center the
uh huh . 2228590_2229076
and the mean is just the sum of the numbers, or the scores divided
the average . 2237013_2237893
yeah, the average . 2237893_2239691
and you notice how in a distribution it's pretty easy to pick out
ok, first of all what is the variability then, what does that look
how they differ . 2261256_2261951
from each other, sort of the spread . 2261951_2265120
uh huh . 2265120_2266510
of the distribution . 2266510_2267608
ok, really technical terms but it's the extent to which the scores
ok, so the standard deviation and variance are two sort of related
variance is like the average, um, average deviation scores around

ok, and we went through that . 2368070_2369685
um, now did you have any questions, or is all clear ? 2369685_2374510
