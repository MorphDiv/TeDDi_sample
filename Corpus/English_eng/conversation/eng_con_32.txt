it was a story about two friends .
and he had parted some twenty years ago .
and they'd promise one another in twenty years they'd meet again in
and one of the young men came back .
and he was there .
and he was sure his friend was going to show up .
and he waited .
and he waited .
and when the friend hadn't shown up a little while later somebody
and asked him some questions .
and he explained to him why he was there .
so forth and so on .
and he noticed that his friend didn't look quite like he thought he
though he hadn't seen him for twenty years .
so he didn't say anything to the man .
but he just really realizing he just didn't think that was his
of_course, it turned out it wasn't his friend .
it was a police officer .
whom his friend who was a policeman now .
had called to tell to come to lock him up because he was the person
and he didn't want to lock him up because he was his good friend .
and so it ended with him being locked up .
and receiving a message from his friend .
I guess that's it .
well, I'll tell you this story that made me depressed and unhappy
I been going to this gasoline station for more than about I'll say
but I think it was longer than that .
I don't know .
lately, it belonged as far as I know to a Black young girl .
and I thought I always patronize her because of this .
I like to see her get ahead .
but the people that she has working there <are just not> they're
they don't smile .
and they take my money .
and I don't like it .
and this morning I was on my way here .
and I told them that I wanted .
I smoke also .
I told them I wanted a pack of cigarettes .
and I wanted ten dollars worth of gas .
well, they were their same old dried up selves .
they can't even say “good morning” or “good evening” or “good night”
so anyway, when I went outside the pump wasn't on .
and that was why I couldn't say I don't get depressed because all
it hurt my feelings so much .
that you know for all these years I've been patronizing these
they look like a whole big family .
but also all this time I been taking their little &-um +...
I don't even know the word to call it .
I felt like they were almost using me because there are many
I don't have to go there .
and it just hurt me so bad .
and I've never done that before .
just cry .
now I don't think that was depression .
I think that was anger .
I never had it happen to me at all .
so I when I went back in, .
first thing, my gas pump didn't start when it should have .
and I was trying to get here .
and then I went back inside .
and then he wanted to know what kind of gas I wanted or something
then he wanted to know what kind of cigarettes I wanted .
and I been buying cigarettes there forever .
and so I just couldn't hold it anymore .
and I told him +"/.
+" I don't know what's wrong with you people .
+" evidently you don't like me very much .
+" I won't use your gas station anymore because there's no way that I
+" buying the same kind of cigarettes .
+" that you so stupid you can't even remember that unless you sick .
so I had never done that before to anyone .
but this morning it just was too much .
and I don't know why because I hadn't had any other problems during
nobody had made me unhappy .
fact, I've been here for several days .
and I've enjoyed the new ladies that I met .
and the food that we've had .
you_know, everything was fine .
so I don't know .
and I got a little worried about it my own self .
and I wondered whether that was depression .
am I depressed or something ?
or I'm just not usually one to just break down .
and cry and mess up my makeup .
I was really upset .
am I finished with this story ?
but that's the truth .
so I really don't know what that was .
so now you_know when I say I'm not sick, then I decide well maybe
I really was so hurt .
so awfully hurt .
I mean tears just running .
I just can't believe this .
one thing, my brother passed two weeks ago .
we had his funeral last Saturday .
you_know, I'm always trying to figure out what happened to me and
so maybe I'm just coming down with something .
and I'm paying for that now because I didn't have time to be sick .
and trying to go through that .
maybe that's the problem .
I don't know .
but anyway, I got make up my mind now whether I'll go patronize
it might not even be her gas station I been trying to help all
so, but I'm going to have to tell her .
and then I'm going to tell everybody at church .
and then tell everybody everywhere .
