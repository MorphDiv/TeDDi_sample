<mister> Justice , this is a room in which you spent a lot
can you tell us about it ?
this is the so-called Justices' Library in which I do spend a lot
I like to get out of the chambers and get up here and work because
but it's a splendid library .
in this room are the volumes that I usually use the most , the
and what isn't available , all I do is get on the phone , call the
but it's quiet up here .
and to my amazement other justices don't use it , William <O>
at least he said he did when I arrived ; I never saw him work up
and Justice O'Connor spent one day over in that corner desk
it's almost been a private library and a very luxurious one .
I've liked it .
when did you first start working here ?
oh , almost from the beginning , I think .
I would say back in the early seventies , anyway .
what is your average day like , or what is your schedule when you
well , I leave our apartment at <seven fifteen> and get
and then I have breakfast with my clerks everyday in the court
that's the one hour of the day that I can have with my clerks
we talk about anything , about yesterday's arguments and
but it's a good way of sharing the start of the day with them .
and then back to chambers .
if we're hearing arguments of course we go on the bench at <ten>
from <ten> to <twelve> and <one> to <three>
if we're not , I'll work on whatever there is to work or get up
I usually go home around <six thirty> or so and have
I put in those long hours , I guess , because I'm dumber than the
but that's the only way I can keep up .
can you talk a little bit about how you work on opinions .
how do you work with the clerks on the opinions and what do you try
it varies from clerk generation to clerk generation because of the
the last two or three years , I've indulged in the luxury of
the clerk that does it is the one who wrote the bench memo .
but I've noticed a habit has developed : the first draft doesn't
the other three criticize it and suggest changes and changes are
so by the time it comes to me , the first draft is almost a
they approve it , then I take it and go over it , read all the
I spend about a week before that opinion circulates .
I haven't done that with every generation of clerks .
but the last two or three have been proficient , and I have
you've become famous for some statements made in opinions , “Poor
when you're working with someone else's draft , how do you make it
well , “Poor Joshua” was my personal addition in that particular
I usually put in things of that kind .
they're hesitant to put in things that are so personal .
of course , I get criticized for it .
many commentators , since the announcement of my retirement , say
well , that doesn't bother me .
was there a time when you were more reluctant to put your feelings
oh , yes , I think so .
when one comes here first , those early years , one isn't very
but as he's here longer , it's easier to put in his personal
but I did it on the Eighth Circuit too at times .
I remember one capital punishment case out there where we upheld
so I wrote both the majority opinion and my little addendum , which
I see nothing wrong in a judicial author expressing his personal
how did you feel about separate opinions and your duty to try to go
well of course criticism has been leveled at the Court and properly
I think that we write too much .
it's much easier to write at length than it is to write briefly .
and if one wants to get an opinion out in a hurry it ends up at
I've yearned for the time that I could get an opinion concluded and
and the Court has been criticized for writing too many separate
everyone seems to want to add a concurrence .
recently some commentator said : +"/.
+" justice X wrote a concurring opinion , which said the same thing
and if that's true then the concurring opinion isn't adding very
but there's much to be said for getting an opinion out in which
but we're under pressure ; we get these things out , and I don't
how do you feel about maintaining consistency with your past
how did you ensure that you did or didn't ?
well that's of course , part of the clerk's job to be sure I'm not
but I think I've been consistent .
some commentators have said that I've changed over the years ,
my response to that has been the easy one of saying that I haven't
it has become more conservative than it used to be .
but I think when one gets down here , in this Court , he has to
+" what is due process of law ?
and +"/.
+" when is something a denial of equal protection ?
all those great phrases .
before one gets here , he doesn't have much of an opportunity to
on the Eighth Circuit , of course , we had constitutional cases ,
and we always had the comfort of knowing , if we were working on a
here , however , one has to develop that philosophy to his own
but if one says that , why , then , one changes down here .
I think over the years I've been consistent .
I don't think of a case where I would have changed my vote .
there's one , I've even forgotten the name of the case , where I
but by and large I think I would have reached the same result in
I might have written them a little differently or said some things
I think I've been consistent , and I haven't seen any commentator
they have said that I've changed or grown more liberal or that kind
could you talk about the assignment power ?
early in your time here , you were very junior but over the last
what are your feelings about the wise use of the assignment power ?
well , it's a very potent power , really , and the general public
who assigns cases to write is not established by statute or court
here , and this is true of most American courts that I know of ,
and that isn't an inconsequential power , really , because first of
and it is true , as you know , that some justices write more
and then of course he tries to balance the load , and all those
on the other hand , if the chief is not in the majority , then the
and sometimes that may even drift down to the third or fourth .
and of course , as one gains seniority here , he rises in the
the last year when I was senior associate there were a lot of cases
those were cases where the chief justice and I were in disagreement
it's an interesting exercise and , as I say , it isn't written in
you had over thirty years of opinions to write .
and I guess it's a craft .
what do you think you learned about opinion writing over those
how did you get better at it ?
well , that assumes I got better at it .
I'm not sure I did .
one has to develop a facility in writing .
I think he should like to write .
I'm sure each of us does it in a different way .
if I'm writing an opinion , I always tackle the facts first , get
justice Douglas , I well remember , if he was in the dissent ,
and when the majority came around , he would circulate his dissent
but then on the second and third drafts , he'd zero-in on the
but he had a facility for writing .
he did it fast , and at the height of his power , he did it well ,
some of the rest of us struggle with it .
and one can struggle a good bit with some of these cases .
a lot of them are terribly close .
and you think about the future looking down the line as to what
we have to be careful about that .
of the justices you sat with , were there some whose facility for
yes .
I sat with seventeen over the years .
of course , one tends to think of the old-timers as particularly
black wrote convincingly and quickly and perceptively , I think .
yet John Harlan , the second John Harlan's writings , I always
he had a sensitivity about him .
he and Black , as I recall , were distant cousins .
but they didn't always agree on things , and they struggled and
but each wrote with facility .
William Brennan , of course , wrote with great facility and
but the words seemed to roll off his pen very easily , and he
those are the three I think and they're the older ones that
do you plan to sit on the Eighth Circuit ?
well , chief judges of the courts of appeals have been very nice .
I think five of them already have written and invited me to sit on
justice Stevens and I , when we were in a little rest moment the
we're qualified to do it if we're invited , but the risk you run ,
when Tom Clark was in that position , there were a number of his
justice Powell has sat on the Fourth Circuit and I think once or
but that's a risk one runs .
and after all , who really is right ?
is the reversing court correct or is the reversed court correct in
because sometimes a dissenting opinion becomes , in due course , in
we're all in this together , and we work the best we can .
I think that one shouldn't be too upset by being reversed .
some judges don't like it at all .
but we shouldn't have pride of authorship .
take it as it comes .
last question .
I know which your most famous opinion is .
which is the opinion you most enjoyed working on ?
well , as far as sheer enjoyment is concerned , the baseball case ,
this court in two prior opinions , some years ago , one of them by
but , at the same time , the Court and other courts have held that
in effect , this Court has thrown the ball to Congress , telling
but in part one of that opinion I indulged in a sentimental journey
I didn't want to bring it down to the present day , but it gave me
they're all listed .
I've named , I think , over a hundred .
and I took the advantage , in a footnote , referring to “Casey at
but two of my colleagues , though the opinion was <seven two>
and I think they thought perhaps it was beneath the dignity of the
but it's been a great conversation piece .
I can go to Chicago , and somebody will come up and say , +"/.
+" I read your list of the great heroes of baseball , but why
and then we'd have a conversation going as to why I didn't include
he didn't bat well enough over ten years or something .
sure .
can I ask one more question ?
other justices might not have put in “Poor Joshua” or might not
why do you think you insisted on having these ?
well , I thought that the DeShaney case , in which I used that
this youngster was subjected to the punishment by a brutish father
the majority of our Court held that the social service agencies and
I went the other way and tried to emphasize what it meant to this
and it seemed to me that he was the issue in the case .
after all , these cases do involve people and usually they involve
they're just an ordinary person that is seeking justice in this
and this little boy got a bad shake and nobody seemed to be very
that's why I referred to “poor Joshua” .
but I never try to forget that there are people at the bottom of
in every case in the <U_S> Reports , there are people
less so maybe when corporations are involved , but there are still
but certainly in the criminal field and in the personal injury
I think that our judicial system should never forget that .
thank you , Mister Justice .
we'll have to leave these <books>
then we can keep coming back .
we could do all the interviews here .
I'll come up and put the books away because the cases have come
but they've been good about letting me pile them up here and use
where did the Minnesota bookshelf come from ?
the bookstand ?
as I recall , there was a Minnesota group that came in headed by a
and I usually did if time was free and we weren't on the bench .
and one day they came in and presented that to me , the outline of
I use it a lot ; it's been very handy here .
that's where it came from .
you pick up a lot of little things like that , you go around and
I never take an honorarium , so I always get a plaque or a

that's why I have so many artifacts down in my chambers .

I also wanted to find the source and significance of the

and I had no assurance it would come to me on the second argument ,
and in any event , I was prepared to write separately if it didn't
it was not consistent , any more consistent than the attitude of
I learned a lot .
well , we'll come back to Roe <v@l> Wade .
well , yes .
that isn't the only thing I wrote .
