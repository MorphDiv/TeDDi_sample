and s:o . 38619_39524
well that's basically your primer space . 40139_41080
if you gonna build up as <qui(ck)> quick as you can
<okay> . 42055_42357
<okay> . 42055_42357
okay . 46633_46935

yeah . 51099_51239
<okay> . 51509_51834
<and you can> choose +//. 51543_52356
basically you see the +//. 52403_53111
you can choose your +//. 53482_54144
you're safe there that's basically where the race is . 54295_56164
<okay> . 56218_56520
<and> different races have different kinda attributes . 56427_58378
okay . 58610_58958
and uhm . 59225_59817
<i suppose> i i i don't don't know them off hand but i
<yeah> . 62225_62376
i'll start for any , i think . 64794_66094
okay . 64795_64860
and uh ? 66706_68099
so ? 68397_69860

anybody ? 72484_73076
yeah . 73103_73300

basically i suppose you can go through this thing . 74182_75657
okay . 75738_76028
so like Egyptian or ? 76028_77236
well they +//. 77499_77754

<that's what the other> <people> players <are> . 78149_79554
<is that what you mean> ? 78150_78428
<these are> ? 79298_79554
okay <so if i go choose> +//. 79577_80657
so if you just choose . 79983_80738
okay (o)kay (o)kay . 80610_81353
you can choose any of <those> . 81535_82603

<i think that's p(retty)> +//. 91548_92175
oh no well well <you have to be> they have to be computer
so you can +//. 96534_96778
<all right> . 97099_97401
<probably> handier just have two players at the start <as
<okay> . 99100_99367
and then basically ehm any other thing . 102676_104870
age defaults . 105056_105868
yeah . 107327_107501
i think the rest of it is <just> just just settings you can
or maybe you wanna wanna change the difficulty <letting>
<oh yeah> . 113275_113635
eh <to> easy ? 113600_114599
<yeah > . 113705_113937
yeah . 114703_114924
so how do i change that ? 115307_116096
i think if you go up to settings connect . 116189_117628
to settings . 117814_118290
up the top . 118731_119184
okay . 119846_120241
settings . 122009_122427
there you are . 122427_122682
alright . 122462_123147
easy . 123379_123797
easiest . 124285_124714
and uh you can change the map or any other stuff you want . 127028_129118
does it make a difference ? 131769_132303
<not real(ly)> not really depends on what one likes +//. 132828_134558
like different races are better at like on land . 134911_137082
other races have big ships and such . 137082_138672
<so it's a> . 139172_139532
okay <so> +/. 139173_139508
<let's i don't know> . 139787_140321
<what would you> recommend ? 139787_140588
<as far as i> go for large armies i suppose . 141408_144020
<i mean> . 144067_144218
<okay> . 144195_144438
pencil . 144638_144905
that's probably where they're the best . 145183_146449
starting aid what's that ? 146205_147366
that's <basically you can start> basically these are +//. 147774_149423
there that's his . 149585_150305
as all one thing as you go along you progress through ages . 150700_152917
<okay> . 153089_153507
<it's like> <like> m like i suppose +//. 153391_154935
through history basically you get better inventions like i stone
<yeah> . 157839_158118
<all right yeah> . 158443_159023
<okay> . 159801_160103
<so> default is just <you start> <with basically with>
<okay> . 164030_164425
well i <do that> then ? 165098_165945
<so> . 165446_165678
yeah . 165911_166027
okay . 167139_167499
and then <victory> conditions . 167522_168555
<victory conditions> conditions . 167523_168750
basically if you uh you you can either basically est(ablish) +/.
ehm standardly presumed is <you are sup(erior)> you are the
conquest is as you have to go and take over certain people as
i think (..) as i'm not sure what standard was but (..) probably
<okay so> . 181878_182412
+, of the above probably will be a <time ever target> .
<so we'll go with that> then <will we> ? 183437_184540
<yeah> . 184320_184517
so that's everything . 185283_185852
<s:o> +... 185852_186433
<yeah> . 186282_186421
<just start> . 186542_187042

the mouse ? 198811_199101
<okay> . 199128_199535
<so you> so if you click on one of those guys . 199291_200684
this guy like ? 201218_201729
yeah . 201741_201892
<and basically> you can basically click on somewhere . 202809_204562
uhn uh . 206168_206412
all right . 207131_207340
sorry . 207352_207561
oh sorry . 207654_208025

<that guy> again ? 211042_211553
yeah . 211553_211658
<and if you> . 212087_212470
<okay> . 212145_212424
just double click somewhere on the map . 212796_214270
okay . 214467_214769
so i go to th:e . 215628_216580
i don't know here ? 216940_217567
oh but that's that's your home base . 218174_219068
<basically> . 219159_219402
<all right> . 219300_219683
oh if you see +//. 219683_220171
if you hit the two buttons there . 220252_221506
see the man ? 221515_222072
yeah . 222156_222330
in more people . 222446_223247
or see the wooden thing ? 223779_225242
<yeah> ? 225521_225730
<you can> build stuff . 225555_226299
oh no that's advance settings . 226844_227901
yeah . 228063_228203
you can't actually (..) build any . 228064_230026
so basically the first thing is is basically advance to tool age
requires two <Stone Age b(uildings)> Stone Age buildings and uh
<five hundred> . 236427_236857
<five hundred> . 236520_236949
so basically that means you have to get five hundred food . 236949_238854
okay . 239202_239504
and uh i think you also need a (..) building . 239597_241965
i'm not sure <where> where's ? 241973_242913
you should have an earth where you can build (..) actual +//. 243033_245100
oh actually <hit the> hit <the> that tool again now . 245920_248068
yeah ? 248463_248695
you can't do that yet . 248737_249434
i'm trying +//. 249411_249817
should be somewhere where you can actually build . 249864_251187
cause they only seem to have one building . 251373_252789
oh <wai(t)> wait . 254218_254543
that's it . 254567_254741

so this guy here ? 256204_256947
yeah . 256958_257098
and see <the> the two different <tools> . 258010_260030
<yeah> . 259798_260030
you can either repair or build . 260123_261029
and if you click on the build . 261098_261888
okay . 262399_262712
that was repair . 263339_263885
oh that . 263908_264210

and then go to build ? 268722_269500
yeah . 269570_269732
yeah ? 269906_270139
and you can build any of those things . 270464_271497
houses are for people . 271497_272484
store if it you . 272870_273729
barracks granary . 274588_275563
granary is probably the best one to build cause it helps you build
okay . 279093_279476
and you see you've mine(rals) you have your things up the top
okay .
<you've got two hundred wood> . 282830_284003
