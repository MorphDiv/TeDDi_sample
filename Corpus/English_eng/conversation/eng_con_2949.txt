so we've been thinking a lot about subtraction problems and different ways to solve them . 7185_11305
and last week, we actually solved this using a number line and a picture strategy . 11865_16345
do you remember that ? 17085_17945
xxx .
can you remember back to Friday ? 18545_20145
so I want you to take a look at this and think about what's similar between this strategy using a number line and this strategy using a picture . 20985_30565
so I want you to take a couple of seconds to think about it . 31325_33505
give me a thumbs up when you've thought of one thing that's similar and one thing that's different from these two strategies . 34545_40685
now, I want you to turn and talk and share what you think is similar and different about these two strategies . 47205_53065
xxx .
I don't know .
yeah, they both get the same xxx . 54725_57205
I can't understand xxx .
I'm going to ask you to share that strategy . 58505_62625
so why don't you practice talking with S_four about what you're going to say ? 63185_66185
if you want to share with me what you just said, that's great . 66405_69805
xxx .
so now I want you to turn back to me, and I'm going to ask S_five +... 70185_74205
S_five shared with S_four . 75545_76265
S_five, what did you and S_four say ? 76265_78345
what was similar about these two math strategies ? 78425_80785
they both took the four away . 81105_82605
because if they took the two away, it would be harder to get back to the easy number than to take the four away . 83845_91265
what do you mean by the easy number ? 91285_92645
thirty . 93065_93925
so you think thirty is an easy number ? 94425_96365
yeah .
why is that ? 97005_97705
because it's a ten or a couple of tens . 98005_101065
is it a couple of tens ? 101445_102365
well, it could be a hundred, a thousand . 102815_105195
oh, you're talking about easy numbers . 105755_106995
yeah .
how many tens is thirty ? 107455_108535
three . 109415_109575
so you and S_four said that first they did what ? 109915_113075
take away four . 113775_114555
in both of these strategies . 114835_116175
yeah . 116275_116455
S_five said that the first step that either group did was take away four . 117115_121775
here it is on the number line, and here it is on the pictures . 122795_126035
take away four . 126815_127655
what was the second step they did ? 128395_130055
so after they did take away four, what did they do next ? 131165_134765
turn and talk with your partner about the second step for this problem . 135065_138085
they took away four, then took xxx . 139045_142045
I'm going to call on you for this one . 142045_143405
okay ?
so how do you know they took away two ? 144625_145965
do you agree with her ? 146045_146785
yeah, I do . 147165_148565
I know that they took away two . 149225_151805
wait +...
they took away two, because four, five, six, that equals six, and they wanted to split the numbers up . 152895_163715
okay, I'm going to call on you when I go back up there, so practice saying what you're going to say to S_seven . 164135_168735
okay ? 169115_169335
so four plus two equals six, and then they wanted to split it up so they can get a round number . 170395_178215
yeah, that's it . 178615_179435
yeah .
yeah, they wanted to make a round number, so they took away four, and then they took away two to make twenty-eight . 180075_186515
to get to six .
are you ready to talk about the second step ? 186755_188575
S_eight, what was the second step that they did ? 189075_192135
so the second step was that they wanted to take away six, but they wanted to get a round number first . 192535_200695
okay . 200975_201235
so we knew it was thirty-four take away six . 201515_203775
so first they took away four to get to the round number . 204315_207255
I see that here, and I see that here . 207885_210065
and then what was the second step ? 211105_212265
and then they took away two and then they landed on twenty-eight . 212605_217265
why did they take away two ? 217505_218685
because four plus two equals six and everyone wants to take away six . 219185_228105
so we were trying to solve minus six, and we split it up into what two parts ? 229165_233725
four and two . 234205_235325
who can say what S_eight just said ? 235625_237125
who can repeat what S_eight just said ? 237205_239045
you can, S_nine ? 239725_240445
great . 240645_241385
they first took away four to get to the round number, and then they took away two because they know that four and two is six, and they wanted to get to the round number . 241745_256465
so when we were trying to solve thirty-four minus six, we know that the first thing that both of these groups did was take away four to get to the friendly or round number . 257465_267285
and then we took away the extra part, two, because we know that four plus two is six . 268245_272865
and then we landed at twenty-eight . 273605_275125
here's the twenty-eight here, and here's the twenty-eight here . 275605_278785
two tens and eight leftover . 279165_280885
