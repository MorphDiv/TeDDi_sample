this group usually leaves me with a very a very good sense of
but I think they take pride in the way that their class on the
and by later in the year they know the things they're doing are
or maybe some thrid or fourth graders are doing .467636_470099
and I think they start to relize that it's because of that
xxx sideways flips . 500672_515845
uhhuh .515845_517379
okay .517379_518099

all year these kids have gotten the message that I care about what
what they are thinking . 547525_549007
and how their thinking is changing . 549007_551138
and how they decribe to someone else what it is they are thinking .
and defend their ideas .555266_556877
or how they challenge someone elses ideas to help them sort through
that's what we do . 560754_562248
all day . 562248_562794
