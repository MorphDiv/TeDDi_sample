⁎u:m thank you⁎↗ 16_1157
we will now move to the next section of the test↗ 1328_3627
task three↘ 3829_4522
Task three↗ is a role play↗ in which you are the 5073_7345
teacher↗ and we are your students↘ your task xxx is 7350_10753
to teach us a common term or a concept ↗ from your 10823_13458
field of study 13741_14648
if you ◉cannot◉ think of a term↗ we will provide you 14935_17575
with a list of terms from which you can choose↘ 17548_20156
you will have seven minutes ∇seven minutes∇ 21002_23754
teach us your term or concept↗ 23895_25841
as you explain this term or ◉concept◉↗ we may interrupt 26203_28902
questions ⁎after you have finished⁎↘ 31899_33350
there are four issues to ⁎consider↗ as you prepare⁎↘ 33860_36462
can you give a formal definition of this term↗ 37052_39495
can you explain ◉why◉ this term is important in your 39895_42327
field of study↗ 42282_43269
How will you being your explanation↗ and how can you 43798_46416
be sure that your audience understands what the term 46454_49014
means↗ 49155_49581
can you make the definition clearer↗ or simpler↗ by 50283_53355
using examples↗ analogies↗ or the ⁎blackboard⁎↘ 53360_56528
you will have one minute↗ to prepare what you want to 57332_59738
During this time you may use a scrap piece of paper↗ (0.3) 60753_63585
◉or◉ blackboard to ⁎prepare⁎↘ 63829_65573
do you have a term or concept in mind↗ 66639_68709
⁎°yea°⁎ ⁇°hmm°⁇ 68771_69523
⁎°alright°⁎ (0.3) you now have one minute to ⁎prepare⁎↘ 70075_72704
°you ready°↗ 110491_111483
⁎so I can use the board⁎↗ 111469_113581
yep you can→ 113664_114560
e:h so↘ today↗ I'm going to talk about an important 119912_123261
term↘ in ⁎civil engineering ca:lled stress⁎↘ 123323_126550
⁎so based on the (0.3) uh academic definition↗ stress⁎ 127176_130936
⁎is a internal resistance of the material⁎↘ 130673_133910
to xxx ⁎several loads such as dead load⁎ light load↘ 134401_137889
xxx or ⁎earthquake (0.3) so any kind of load that we are⁎ 138494_141518
⁎expect our structure will be exposed⁎↘ 141391_144521
∆this is an important∆ term↘ and uh all engineers↘ they 145676_149393
⁎have to calculate⁎ the amount of stress (0.4) in different 149427_154083
members in a structure like uh beams or columns to make 154081_158774
sure that the structure will stand against the 158763_162368
external loads and will not fail↘ 162175_164255
so we have different type of stress ⁎uh::⁎ it's in 165009_168129
engineering so: I mean again (0.4) I: give you four different 168133_172896
types↘ 172895_173327
so it's a xxx stress↘ compression stress↘ ⁎and⁎ sheer stress 173320_178856
and xxx stress↘ so today I want to talk about the first two 178858_183471
uh types↘ which are more common↘ and as it's kind of the basic 183479_188882
uh I think based in civil engineering in the different 188869_192154
courses↘ structural xxx or uh material xxx 192128_196944
so the thing about the the first one is uh (2.8) 203249_209127
tensile stress↘ 209115_210742
and the next one is the compression→ (7.6) stress↘ 212155_223019
so imagine we have a a f- a member→ for example a pin↘ 224289_230380
so this is a simple→ (1.9) pin→ that it can be made from 230381_236050
uh steel→ or concrete→ or wool↘ so regardless of the material↗ 236059_240912
we expose→ equal→ (4.4) so if we expose equal forces→ 240910_252163
and then this is the ⁎length of the ⁇beam⁇→ for example f⁎↘ 252142_256345
so we- uh- we- uh→ there are two equal forces at the two ends↘ 256347_261595
and they are equals↘ and they are normal to ∇the∇ cross 261577_265252
section of the beam↘ and it's a xxx the section↘ 265224_268696
so the ↑stress→ which is represented with a signal→ 269393_274577
and because it's a tensile stress→ we call it ⁇sigma⁇ t↘ it's 274550_278225
equal to acting force divided by ⁎cross sectional area⁎↘ 278221_283192
so what is the cross ⁇section⁇ area↗ ⁎if we→ um:⁎↘ 283182_287971
°don't have another color°↘ but if you ⁎uh⁎ (1.9) 287974_292580
do a section here↘ create a section A↘ A↘ and see the: 292581_299368
inside the member as a xxx→ so→ ∆because it's a-∆ 299369_303325
because xxx is a→ ⁎it's gotta be any sh- ⁇shade⁇⁎↘ 303326_306389
⁎but for example it's a concrete beam⁎↘ so you have the 306390_309451
height→ and the base↘ 309440_311366
so the area is→ A xxx by B↘ 311954_315846
so this is the area that's ⁎uh:→ actually resists against the⁎ 317722_323351
load↘ ⁎which emits uh in this case is a tensile→ tensile force⁎↘ 323349_329397
so uh at the same→ kind of the concept→ so we have the same (1.7) 329395_334646
beam and the same length↘ 334643_338483
⁎and uh⁎ (1.2) we have two equal ∇forces∇ (1.8) acting normal 339824_347515
to the cross section→ ok↘ 347512_349688
I'm sorry I have a question→ um kind of going back to the area 349688_352547
that you mentioned↘≈ 352547_353403
+≈ yep 353403_353728
um→ is it possible that- you might be doing this with something 353724_356495
that has like→ that is like hollow on the inside→ but like 356487_359367
has a whole going through it↗≈ 359361_360382
yep yep→ for example ∇if the:∇→ ∆for example∆ if uh: we have the 360373_363538
hollow here→ ⁎so the area would be the affected area⁎↘ 363538_367050
⁎so it mean that xxx kind of the:→ (0.6) just calculate the:⁎ 367599_372500
⁎affective area without the whole⁎↘ 372500_374238
so we would subtract that area ⌈then↗ 374239_376170
⌊⁎yea→ ⌈subtract⁎↘ 376164_376497
⌊ok↘ 376489_376692
kind of from the whole↘ 376692_377772
ok↘ 377765_378112
⁎yea⁎↘ 378109_379045
(1.9) 379043_380961
Actually I xxx the example in the homeworks→ 380959_383183
you need ⁎to do ⌈that⁎↘ 383177_384212
⌊oh ⌈ok↘ 384207_384628
⌊⁎yea→ it's xxx for that⁎↘ 384626_386061
so eh→ in the→ hm compression stress→ so the force is acting 386373_390080
normal to the xxx↘ the cross section→ but it's eh kind of 390086_394195
⁎push the member⁎↘ ⁎squeeze the member⁎↘ 394181_396237
uh: the same→ (0.5) kind of the metal→ (0.8) sigma↘ this time 397677_403109
the compression stress sigma ⁇C⁇ is ⁇default⁇ to acting force 403106_407858
divided by ⁎barium⁎↘ 407854_409582
but one thing that's uh:→ all the engineers they accept it 412609_416713
that is a kind of rule↘ 416703_418028
Tensile stress is→ uh: ∆we are talking about the∆ sign of 418437_421933
⁎the stress⁎↘ 421924_423126
so→ tensile stress we assume that this is positive↘ 423786_427775
⁎and uh compression stress always is negative⁎↘ 433802_437831
Uh: (1.2) so→ because the ⁇scope⁇ is a structural analysis→ 439547_445099
⁎yea⁎↗ 445096_445325
um so: can you explain about how→ we can apply this situation 445323_450827
to the real life→ is there ⌈any xxx↗ 450811_452646
⌊⁎yes yea exactly I wanted⁎↘ 452647_454066
so this- I mean- this step- so we were talking about the 454268_457922
structural analysis↘ 457910_459158
so we determine the (0.6) different stresses→ tensile and 459305_464211
compression for different members↘ 464198_465809
so we have to do the same thing ⁎for columns⁎↘ 466181_469232
⁎for the beams⁎↘ ⁎for the bracing⁎↘ 469237_470896
so→ at the next step→ so eh ∆°I'm gonna explain it here°∆↘ 471233_476657
sigma T and→ 479450_481076
so the next step→ so we have to eh keep these stresses 495623_499901
⁎as a internal resistant to the uh ⁇sum⁇ ranges and limits⁎↘ 499898_505562
so this is- we call ◉now◉ we call it ⁎just call the values⁎↘ 505872_508966
they are available in the civil engineering ∇standards∇→ 508966_511883
or codes↘ 511862_512838
so for example→ eh: we have a concrete beam that's 512823_517986
uh exposed to the beam- for ex- in the tensile stress↘ 517974_521691
if you check the codes→ so it says that the tensile 521698_526024
stress should be less than twenty-five megapascal↘ 526012_529852
so we have to always be in these in these limits in order 530437_533589
to in order to make sure ⁎that the structure will stand⁎ 533587_536691
against the lot↘ 536689_538107
this number→ the code ⁎values is different based on the⁎ 538600_542029
⁎different stresses→ differents members→ and uh: what's⁎ 542016_546704
⁎the- I mean working with a code→ is uh: (0.5) regar- I mean⁎ 546702_551480
is related to the other course↘ design course↘ 551485_554146
so we take a different steel design course→ concrete design 554392_557234
course→ 557229_558104
so that will apply to that section↘ 558290_561565
but before that→ the structural analysis→≈ 561708_563244
+≈ well actually we'll cut you off there↘ 563244_565399
I think we've reached the ⁎time limit⁎↘≈ 565400_566867
+≈ ⌈oh↘ 566893_567202
⌊right ⌈yep↘ 567202_567692
⌊yup→ 567686_567980
⌈so 567984_568640
⌊°thank you° 568636_569254
