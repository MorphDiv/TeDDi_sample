the beginning he's still real hesitant sometimes to share his ideas
but he you know as_soon_as he speaks you know . 4860_6790
okay . 6840_7100
you've been thinking right along with us . 7120_8540
you've been listening and sharing . 8690_9830
so I am yeah I'm wondering what will I'm really interested in how
'cause I think it's gonna show you're right on and right there . 17650_20740
and mhm at the beginning he floundered some too not in the same
for one thing . 26380_26790
his small motor skills are better . 27020_28660
and his just ability to manipulate those shapes in his head and
but some of the other things the organizational things have been
it is just &-uh yeah . 45300_46020
because &-uh in the couple first classes I have noticed that he did
so I I was wondering if he may have realized that he's not
and then he decided to be quiet instead . 61460_64739
no it kind of goes in streaks I've noticed like in part of a unit
it just takes to a little his hands . 71680_72860
and then he kind of eases back and watches and listens . 73410_76860
and then he contributes more . 76980_78660
and &-um I don't know I think it's just and part of it I think is
how much do I know about whatever this is already . 89700_91910
and if he answers himself well . 92180_93620
quite a bit . 93760_94300
he's ready to jump right in . 95020_96100
and if on that first initially it's like . 96580_98430
well maybe not too much . 98480_99550
he tends to hang back longer . 99660_101060
yeah . 101170_101300
try to really scope out what's going on . 101340_104390
and then start to make contributions . 104550_106210
and he he does lots_of times . 106420_108340
wait until I call . 108470_109950
then he he doesn't just sit . 110910_112230
I don't know he does . 113520_114530
but he doesn't necessarily even when he's thinking things raise his
but I have a_lot_of other kids like that too . 118980_120590
Ashley does the same thing . 120640_122110
it streaks her hands up all the time . 122160_123670
and then it's not . 124300_124820
but when you call she's thinking with you and Kelly same thing some
and then for days I miss we walking on . 131660_134970
no . 136930_137100
we should come in and sit down at your desk for right . 137120_139020
we need to get ready for Tess's visit for the . 139240_141180
