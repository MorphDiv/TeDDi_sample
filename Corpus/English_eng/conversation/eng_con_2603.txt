&-uh another handout is a replacement page for the last page of the syllabus because &-um you need this one too ?
&-uh because I have no less than three different dates listed for the due date for your &~u if you're opting to do the web version of your project &-um &~propo not your proposal but your project presentation .
so between that and &~a also leaving out one short reading on the last week that I forgot to put in .
&-um and then I wanted to give you on the back some suggestions for additional reading .
may or may not help you in your &-um research projects because I &~ex expect your research projects to be quite artifact specific .
you may not find stuff in necessarily in the readings on your artifacts .
but if you want more information about &-um some classic works in historical archaeology or or particularly some recent work &-um and what the state of the field is , &-uh there're some good suggestions there for library reading .
&-uh the third any questions on the syllabus ?
so take the syllabus rip off the last page and replace it with this one .
okay ?
the corrected version .
there are three handouts if you need them I have them up here .
the third one you're probably most concerned with at the moment and these are guidelines for your project proposals which are due a week from Wednesday .
so they are due May thirtieth .
it +//.
I tried to make it pretty clear what I expect &-uh basically I expect a one page &-uh outline just tell me what topic you settled on what kind of artifact &-uh what basic questions you're interested in &-uh and what methodologies you're gonna use .
and based on that I might be able &~t to &-um give you some suggestions for reading or resources .
okay ?
I expect that some of your research questions or methodologies may change as you start to work on it .
that's okay but I want you at this stage to start thinking about it because the end of the term will &~c come before you know it we're almost at the halfway point already .
okay ?
&-um and I do want you to settle on your your artifact of choice that much you should get decided by next week .
any questions on this ?
I don't think I need to read it verbatim .
(0.4) okay &-um (0.7) let me do a really quick &-uh attendance .
make sure I really do have all your names down .
it's just a couple people and hopefully it won't be clear who those who I'm still a little hazy on .
but Latoya's not here right ?
alright .
Taneesha xxx Dorothy xxx Ashley I saw you Matthew I saw you xxx David xxx Elizabeth I saw you xxx &-uh did you notice the article ?
<did you> &~w did you author this article the one that got passed around ?
I'm sorry ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ look ⌋ at the article look at the author's name .
oh .
you're famous and you didn't know it huh .
&-um Jamie is here Krista <I saw you> you're right there that's why I saw you .
&-um Hugh Hugh's not here ?
Courtney ?
she had some great comments she's not here though huh ?
Monica I saw you didn't I ?
Raoul there and Stephanie .
Kelly ?
Kelly is is not here right ?
Michelle I saw you .
Emily Sarah Shivane Keith xxx Jennifer Carrie Jeff is Jeff here ?
and Rachel Mandy Mandy ?
and Tiffany I saw you xxx .
alright .
(0.11) the reading commentaries that you guys have been emailing &-um are really good so I'm optimistic that we'll have more lively discussion today &-um and thank you the the leaders taking the the initiative of &-uh putting questions in front of people ahead of time .
&-uh I think that's also a great idea .
&-um on reading commentaries just a reminder &-um most of them did this but just in case yours didn't be sure in your reading commentaries that you're making a reference to the readings that you did themselves .
I mean it's wonderful to bring in &-uh outside experiences and knowledges and knowledge but +//.
knowledges make that a plural .
&-um but be sure that &-uh &~p you know part of the purpose of the reading commentaries is to demonstrate that you have done the readings .
so make sure you kind_of relate them back to the readings okay ?
&-um and Mandy and Latoya there's some handouts you wanna get right ?
and what else do I have for announcements ?
&-um after break I'll pass out a sign+up sheet for Greenfield Village would you please remind me if I don't start doing that right at the beginning .
&-uh I'm still not entirely certain we have a final headcount .
I need to get that to get the funding together .
&-um I think that's it for announcements .
heavy day of announcements .
<I need this one> .
+, someone is hoarding extra final pages of the syllabus someplace .
(0.9) no I'm hoarding them .
there's three handouts for those who came in late .
just come up and get them while I start talking .
hey Shannon &-um you said that the trip to Greenfield Village is worth two commentaries right ?
so does that mean that we're only required to send in four or do we just have extra xxx grade ?
no &~you you're only required to do four .
+, everyone hear that ?
if you're doing Greenfield Village it's worth two reading commentaries which doesn't mean that you're getting extra credit I don't do extra credit but it's replacing two so you only have to do a total of four .
okay .
are we writing up something or just <kind of> .
&-um I I thought about that &-uh I think (0.6) I I think you're grown+ups I think if we can integrate it into the discussion in the the following meeting that we have and and have a a you know devote some time to really discussing our experiences there I think that's satisfactory .
so I would suggest taking notes as you go along so you can remember &-um what kind of questions or issues the exhibits bring up for you .
okay +..?
alright &-um today for +//.
yep you have another .
just a quick question about the commentaries &-um +/.
uhuh +/.
+, how are we gonna get feedback to just know if we're on the right track in what we're talking about xxx ?
⌊ basically xxx ⌋ .
⌈ oh &-um yeah I'm not I don't give them grades it's like ⌉ you did it or you didn't .
unless you know it'd be kind_of like zero if you didn't .
&-uh plus which is what most people got and and then you might get a a check you know meaning it's okay but you really didn't show that you did the reading .
and you know so far there's only been one of those and I'll get back to that person .
otherwise if you don't hear back from me just assume everything's fine .
okay ?
you know and I like +//.
a_lot_of them are are creative they're they're written quickly that's the whole idea of the commentaries they're not supposed to be finished polished writing .
it's supposed to be your thoughts spilling out on the page about the reading .
okay ?
which is why I don't think it should be graded they should just be your thoughts and I'm not here to evaluate whether or not you're thinking is A thinking or B thinking you should you know this should be feedback for you and <feedback for the class> .
okay ?
alright any other questions or announcements ?
news ?
okay .
&-um in terms of lecture &-uh I have two discrete things I wanna do today and I hope hopefully I can get through it .
I think I can .
&-uh number one is to +//.
<if you> if you're following the syllabus we're kind of behind on one kind of discussion slash lecture &~to lecture topic which was to talk about eighteenth century life particularly urban life .
(be)cause part of what we're doing in the class is looking at you know theoretical &~methodo methodological issues about artifact analysis material cultures and looking at generally the development of the subfield of historical archaeology .
but we're also doing this going historically and trying to understand what's going on in American material culture through the centuries and what kind of transformations are occurring leading up to our quote_unquote modern era right ?
&-um and this kind of goes along with the the Cliffs Notes version of US history .
which hopefully most of you don't need it's just a little bit of an overview to kind_of to put our material culture studies in some sort of historical chronological context .
so what I wanna do is to kind_of pick up where Deetz left off &-uh with the late eighteenth century , the period of the revolution .
in the &-um mid eighteenth century colonial towns <started to> really &~st started to be transformed into cities .
&-uh and this was in part because of a population increase that was happening &-um across the nation and in part because of economics and certain changes that were &-uh occurring in the colonial economy .
and it is <a process> this urbanization process &-uh that led to the American Industrial Revolution as_well_as significant changes in everyday life and material life .
you &~n need to remember that before the revolution only five percent of the &-uh American colonial population or North American colonial population to be the United States in the future .
only five percent of the population lived in cities .
the vast majority of the country &-uh lived in rural settings and possibly villages or hamlets .
but this would change rapidly &-uh over the next &~s several decades , about &-uh seventeen sixties forward .
so and you see a a number of trends beginning in the seventeen sixties in cities such as Boston , &-uh New_Orleans , Philadelphia , Charleston , New_York .
&-uh <these were &-uh cities or> these were towns that really became cities in this late colonial period .
you see number one population growth two &-uh an increase in ethnic diversity three increased importance of these cities &-uh to regional trade and regional government .
there's a kind of &~s &-uh centralization going on of economic powers where as_well_as political power .
number four you see in these cities the creation for the first time really of an urban elite .
and this urban elite &-uh started to purchase food and clothing not only from abroad but also started &~purchas purchasing it from other colonists .
and this leads to a whole new wave of domestic manufacturers which Deetz does begin to talk about .
but &-uh in his earlier period , in that Americanization period , this really hadta do with &-um development of regional folk cultures .
well ‡ in this later period it really starts to &-uh conform to elite urban tastes and to really supply this kind_of cosmopolitan culture that's developing .
number five <you see a> &~r you see rising levels of consumption for all classes (0.4) &~a and this means kind_of two things .
<it means> when you talk about consumption it means people are buying more of their goods rather than making it themselves or or bartering with neighbors .
so you're using a cash economy to purchase goods made elsewhere usually .
and it just means simply an increase in the amount of goods that are going into their everyday lives .
(0.6) but overall despite this kind_of emergence of an urban elite and rising levels of consumption for everyone , at the same time you're also getting number six an increase in the stratification of classes .
you know what I mean by stratification ?
mhm +/.
+, no ?
+, you wanna .
well just like the rich get richer and the poor get poorer ⌊ xxx ⌋ +/.
⌈ yeah .
yeah ⌉ +/.
+, xxx .
right .
greater differences between &~d different socioeconomic classes .
the poor are poorer the rich are richer the middle might be more middle .
a larger gulf with more significant differences .
okay ?
any questions on these kind of urbanization trends in this late colonial period ?
and this was really starting in the seventeen sixties and continues into the early nineteenth century &-uh you_know until you really get the identifiable beginnings of the American Industrial Revolution .
it's &~st it's kind_of the precursor social &~eco and economic conditions that are gonna lead to an American version of the Industrial Revolution .
by the way <where does> classically what where do historians talk about the Industrial Revolution &-um beginning ?
Detroit ⌊ xxx ⌋ +/.
⌈ what ⌉ ?
+, the automobile &~industr or ⌊ before that ⌋ .
⌈ no what ⌉ do I mean by the Industrial Revolution I mean that that's a fair question I could mean many different things .
use machines .
what ?
+, use machines for production .
⌊ for <mass production> ⌋ .
⌈ the use of machines ⌉ for mass production yeah .
didn't it start in Europe like in England or something ?
yeah .
it's classically &-um most classically identified with &-uh what would be &=laughs antebellum England .
but really we'll talk about early nineteenth century England is the beginning of what we would identify as machine generated mass produced +/.
⌊ assembly lines ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ manufacturing ⌉ .
assembly lines the use of capital particularly to invest in &-uh machinery and complicated manufacturing processes .
okay .
you start to see a greater dependence on machine labor than human labor .
alright ?
&-uh what I would like to do is then kind_of bring these historic trends down to a more local level and talk about four example cities and some things that were happening on the ground &-uh in daily life there .
and my first example is Philadelphia in the seventeen sixties &-uh just to give you an idea of ethnic diversity and to remind you about the also the context of slavery which we'll talk about &-uh on Wednesday .
one fifth of Philadelphia's population was enslaved in the seventeen sixties .
and at this time Philadelphia was not only the largest city in North America , it was the largest city of all the British colonies .
it was the Megapolis as Ken Azure liked to talk about .
(0.5) it had a population in seventeen seventy of thirty five thousand .
which doesn't sound like very much now right ?
what's the population of Ann Arbor ?
hundred ⌊ twenty thousand ⌋ .
⌈ anybody ⌉ know ?
⌊ what ⌋ ?
⌈ &~hund ⌉ hundred ten hundred twenty thousand .
yeah somewhere a hundred and teens I think .
&-uh so it was one third approximately one third maybe even one fourth the size of Ann Arbor but it was the largest city in British in the British colonies .
&-um (0.4) commerce grew &-uh quickly once things started to be &-um centralized in &-uh through Philadelphia particularly in iron and textiles .
those were two areas of kind_of American Industrial Revolution that kind_of had their beginnings in Philadelphia .
I_mean ‡ textiles are obviously &-uh important also in Massachusetts and New England but &-uh Philadelphia they're important to the kind_of explosive growth of Philadelphia .
and there are two things that we &~sp see especially clearly &-uh socially is a trend in stratification that I talked about .
&-uh in &~ph Philadelphia <they calculate> historians have calculated looking at &-uh economic &-uh figures that a male laborer , you_know someone who maybe &-uh laid bricks or &-um &-uh plastered houses , dug ditches , something like that , a male laborer could not support a family .
could not support &-uh say give house and and food to &-uh a wife and children .
it simply was not possible in late eighteenth century Philadelphia .
so as a result women and children &-uh were employed .
they either worked jobs , sold &~g goods on the street , perhaps the woman took in some piece work &-uh sewing to do .
so at the lower levels all members of the family were &-um involved in production or work of some kind in some fashion .
on the other hand you do see one of the other trends very clearly in Philadelphia and that is that the elites of Philadelphia as the elites of the larger largest and at this time most cosmopolitan town <in &-uh British> in the British colonies really started to create a culture of their own .
and to really start to to define what it meant to be an American elite .
&-um they did participate in &-um &~w what Deetz starts to identify as kind_of Anglophilia , the love of all things English .
(0.5) and remember this is where Georgian architecture comes from .
and if you look at Philadelphia , colonial townhouses are kind_of a a miniature squished &=laughs &-uh urban version of Georgian architecture .
they're very symmetrical , very clean .
they have very simple &-uh Greco_Roman elements to them .
and this Georgian architecture is really an imitation &-um of country houses of the aristocracy in &-uh eighteenth century England .
but they get transformed in in Philadelphia &~t to the those classic narrow townhouses .
&~any anyone know what I'm looking thinking of ?
been to Philadelphia ?
&-um (0.5) part of this Anglophilia also meant that the elites were &-uh really interested in imports coming from England through the river system .
Philadelphia was a port city of sorts , supported by its &-uh river port .
and there , colonial merchants , doctors , lawyers &-uh tried to emulate British upper classes &-uh not only through their architecture but through concerts , plays , &-uh dance , &-uh dress , fashion .
and they also filled their houses with fine furniture .
however &~a &~a as much as they had pretensions towards emulating the British aristocracy they didn't really quite have the resources .
particularly once you start importing things that greatly increased the cost .
you hafta add transportation &~co costs as_well_as duties .
so what they started to do was to &-um to give support to and to start ordering copies of British type &-uh elite &-uh furniture in particular to local American craftsmen .
and they were known +//.
and as a result Philadelphia artisans became particularly known for producing &-uh &~magni magnificent copies of works of Thomas Chippendale which many of you might have heard about .
&-uh Great Britain's most famous furniture designer .
and the <the work> the name Chippendale is so associated with &-uh US artisans right now you may not realize that the original Chippendale was actually British .
because now there is a widespread &-um American furniture style called American Chippendale .
it has nothing to do with the dancers &=laughs:multiple that I'm aware of .
<maybe there's some> maybe if someone wants to research this and let me know if there's any connection .
&-uh but if you watch like the Antiques Road Show or something like that you'll they'll often talk about Chippendale style furniture .
and trying to authenticate +//.
a_lot_of the authentification &-uh goes back to identifying either British examples from the original Thomas Chippendale but more likely some well known Philadelphia craftsmen who &-uh were carriers of this Chippendale style .
so this combined &-um with some folk elements in furniture design (be)cause the craftsmen who are producing it &-uh you_know weren't necessarily &-uh coming out_of this British tradition .
they may have been &-uh in the colonies for &-uh a number of generations already .
and &~e and eventually the style , &-uh much as the &~graves gravestone styles that Deetz identified , changed through a combination of urban popular culture .
and this would be an example of popular culture right ?
(be)cause it's being imported &-uh into an urban center and diffusing from there „ right ?
but in this case one thing that happened was that this popular American Chippendale furniture &-uh design melded with some folk designs to become identifiably American Chippendale .
such_that you_know connoisseurs can tell the difference with one look .
whether it's a British Chippendale or an American Chippendale .
does &~any anyone know what I'm talking about in terms of the furniture ?
and what it looks like ?
yes ?
no ?
anyone want to describe what a classic +//.
like a Chippendale mirror there're lots_of mirrors in particular xxx .
it's kinda +//.
it's still used for furniture xxx but it's so just used because of the name that you don't really know what it originally looked like .
it means +//.
in all furniture catalogs now like every designer has something called Chippendale .
yeah I &-um I can try to bring in some &-uh books with pictures xxx .
&-uh a classic Chippendale mirror might be an oval shape gilded with &-uh a_lot_of &-um a_lot_of circular facets .
and then what's classically American Chippendale is you would put an eagle at the top , an eagle design .
and particularly after the revolution right ?
because the eagle was one of the &-um symbolic representations of liberty .
so that was one example of in in &~wh in which this originally British popular style got transformed into something American and became quintessentially American .
a_lot_of people identify this Chippendale furniture as somehow very very very root American +...
alright moving on to my &-uh next example , Williamsburg .
Williamsburg was kind_of a Southern capital city in in many ways .
&-uh it was made the capital of Virginia in sixteen ninety nine .
and in another kind_of &-uh fit of Anglophilia it was renamed from +//.
it useta be called Middleburg .
it got renamed Williamsburg in the honor of William the Third of England .
not that important but just a little trivia there .
and it subsequently became a social and cultural &~c center and it was especially notable for political debates &-uh held in the House of Burgesses there &-uh preceding the American Revolution .
in terms of +//.
if you think about the American Revolution and the kind_of coalescence of political action and political life in America , it it had three basic centers , Williamsburg , Philadelphia , and in a more kind_of chaotic state in Boston .
I say chaotic because it was more put on the streets through popular movements in Boston .
but in Philadelphia and Williamsburg it was happening &-um in the local colonial representative bodies .
<they were called> it was called the House of Burgesses in Virginia .
in Philadelphia I'm not sure .
it might have been called the Colonial Congress .
&-um and what's interesting about Williamsburg is that +...
&~wh who here (ha)s been to Williamsburg ?
know what I'm talking about ?
wow .
you_know this is like &~th the second most visited tourist site in all of the United States and only two of you have been there .
after what ?
what's number one ?
New York .
no .
New York .
no .
LA .
Grand Canyon .
it's the Grand Canyon , Williamsburg , and then &-uh maybe Disneyland and New York .
something like that .
and you guys have never heard of Williamsburg ?
how many people +//.
I I really want to know this (be)cause +//.
how many people have never heard of Williamsburg ?
oh no one's gonna admit that much okay you will .
alright .
<what is> what is colonial Williamsburg ?
what is it ?
like a park +/.
⌊ isn't it like a resort of something ⌋ ?
+, ⌈ or like a ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ they have ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ tourist ⌉ attraction ?
resort ?
where they have like .
what's it look like ?
reenactments .
don't they like have reenactments ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ mhm ⌉ .
xxx .
they what ?
they have like a &~l it's like a town set up +/.
mhm +/.
+, right +/.
+, right and you can go and walk through .
right .
it's a reconstructed historic town and it's on the original site of Williamsburg .
and it's kind_of frozen in time around the period of the revolution .
and architecturally what's interesting about what's going on there is there is kind_of +//.
&-um whereas in Philadelphia you see a real kind_of bifurcation in in styles and housing +//.
&-uh particularly the elites are getting these huge mansions in one part of town whereas &-uh the laborer and people who work <on the> &~sh &-um in the shipyards are living in another part of town in these very dense tenements .
in Williamsburg everyone has some little Georgian piece of architecture .
and <if you look at> if you visit Williamsburg you'll kind_of be struck because all of the buildings are reconstructed in Georgian style .
I_mean down to outhouses being in Georgian style , having perfect symmetry .
and they do vary between &-um brick which will be the most +//.
like the Governor's Palace is made of brick .
which would &-uh really is kind_of the divider between rich and poor is the difference between &~b brick and wood .
the vast majority of the structures in Williamsburg though are made out_of wood or clapboard .
but &-um even though in England there would be no such thing as a wooden Georgian structure , in Williamsburg in_order_to let everyone kind of participate in this new style , &-uh there &~w is a local style that developed of wooden very simple wooden Georgian architecture .
&-um (0.5) one of the things &-uh that happened to Williamsburg was after &-um seventeen eighty after the revolution the capital of Virginia was moved to Richmond and the city for all intents and purposes died completely .
almost completely .
it was it just a tiny little village afterwards but had some remarkable preservation of its colonial buildings which inspired &-uh John_D_Rockefeller to invest in its reconstruction .
and we'll see a little bit about that in a film we're gonna watch on Wednesday .
one thing that is kind_of &-um typical of the South in particular is this +//.
you_know I've painted this picture of this overall urbanization going on in late eighteenth century America .
one exception is the South .
there're only a few places <where cities really> in this period where towns really were becoming cities .
Williamsburg is kind_of a great failure that way .
it had potential but you took away its political capital and it had nothing there .
<it didn't> &~off it didn't have an economic engine to it .
it was not a port .
the political center was moved away &-uh before the Industrial Revolution so there was no industry there .
the exceptional cities who &~whi actually deserve the name are basically Charleston and New Orleans at this time .
we'll talk about New Orleans next .
(0.4) New Orleans &-um obviously started off as a town , an administrative center of <the French colonial> the French colony of Louisiana .
it was taken over by Spain though in seventeen sixty five because of some complicated wars and political maneuvers happening in Europe .
it remained under the Spanish &-um up until a couple years before the &-uh &-um the Louisiana Purchase that Jefferson coordinated in and &~eight that was finalized in eighteen oh five uhuh ?
what year did you say ?
that is was taken over by Spain .
&~eight &-uh seventeen sixty five .
the colony starts +//.
the French colony really starts around sixteen ninety nine .
there were a_lot_of French traders moving through the area before then but it kind_of officially started in sixteen ninety nine when the there really starts to be a a French military presence in the region .
the city is established +//.
and you don't need to know these dates .
but the city is established around &-um seventeen eighteen .
remains under French control until seventeen sixty five then goes to the Spanish and remains under the Spanish for &~ano another basically a couple generations until the Louisiana Purchase of eighteen oh five .
so basically it's under the Spanish during this time period I'm talking about , late eighteenth century .
(0.5) and New Orleans was always an important port basically from its beginning for illicit &-uh trade &-uh between the Caribbean colonies , going to Mexico , on up the Mississippi into Canada , for the French concerns as_well_as &-uh Spanish colonial concerns .
and <under the> even under the Americans &-uh a little later it became very important for the transport of &-uh Midwestern produce .
New Orleans is actually still the second largest port in the United States because of that , because of the combination of ocean access as_well_as controlling the outlet of the Mississippi .
so this was its real economic base .
that was the first one and continues to be the most important one .
however in this period in the seventeen nineties one interesting &~h thing happened in the island called Saint Domingue .
anyone want to explain that ?
anyone know what happened in Saint Domingue in the seventeen nineties ?
+, Saint Domingue ?
well ‡ it's now known as Haiti .
it was +//.
which is its revolutionary name .
but I'm just saying Saint with the French pronunciation .
this is its French prerevolutionary Saint Domingue .
what happened in the seventeen nineties ?
slaves revolted and took over .
yeah slaves revolted and took over the entire island .
and as a result there was an exodus of French elite &-uh free people of color as_well_as &-um some slaves .
and a large number of them ended up in New Orleans .
and the economy of &~Sain Saint Domingue &-uh was fueled by sugar which was extremely profitable .
it was a very valued &-um precious commodity in Europe .
there are very few places that it would grow .
it doesn't really grow &~m much of anyplace in Europe .
a few parts of Spain is about it .
so when these people came to Louisiana in the seventeen nineties they had &-uh the know-how to produce sugar profitably .
people had tried in Louisiana before but <it really> it didn't take off .
and as a result of particularly the knowledge that &-uh imported slaves brought +//.
because they were really the ones who understood the day to day operations , how to grow the cane , &-uh how it needs to be tended , how to process it .
it was their kind_of technological know-how that created a kind_of agricultural revolution in Louisiana that led it to be &-um by the antebellum period the basically the wealthiest slave state in the Union .
and ironically it was as it was a direct result of the slave revolt in Haiti xxx .
it's one of those things about history .
one of the things in terms of &~mater other aspects of material culture in in this period that's really interesting is that if you've ever been to the French Quarter +...
you know what those buildings look like „ right ?
they're brick townhouses +/.
balconies +/.
+, with lots_of iron balconies &-um tall tall &-uh interior walls and doors and windows .
as_well_as some cottages and smaller styles .
the cottages &-um probably like the shotgun house were influenced by Haitian architecture but also some French Caribbean styles .
however &~a the majority of the houses in the French Quarter aren't French at all .
they're Spanish .
the city burned down to the ground in seventeen eighty eight and when it was rebuilt the Spanish decided they didn't want to go through that again .
so they established all these building codes that said that structures hadta be of brick , they hadta have firewalls , they hadta be so tall , they hadta have tile roofs rather than &-uh cypress shingle roofs .
what year did it burn down ?
seventeen eighty eight .
what year was that church built in New Orleans I +//.
by +//.
I think it's the French Quarter right ?
yeah Saint Louis Cathedral ?
there was a church on that site from the beginning in seventeen eighteen that structure that you see there is the third structure &-um +/.
just built on top of it or something +/.
+, built one right on top of the other .
so that one dates to after the fire .
like the seventeen nineties .
what was the fire from ?
&-um it was it &~suppose the rumor is it was a a candle in a kind of devotional corner of someone's house that &-uh fell over +//.
I'm trying to remember what day it was .
it was on a special day <in the> in the Catholic calendar and someone just wasn't wasn't ⌊ paying attention ⌋ +/.
⌈ so it was actually ⌉ accidental ?
+, yeah .
+, oh +/.
+, so but as a result what's really interesting is that the architecture of the quote_unquote French Quarter which &-uh local residents will still interpret as French was actually Spanish through this one you_know kind_of accident , a@l the fire and b@l through building Spanish &~c through the Spanish building codes .
and so one of the things that's interesting that we might talk about a little later is how the kind_of cultural memory of the physical environment jives or doesn't jive with what actually happened .
and I think this really gets &-um connects to in part the that first Yench article that we talked about last week .
and how she was talking about the folk mythologies that build up about houses .
and what what's remembered is what the contemporary community thinks is important but isn't necessarily based in historical reality .
and the French Quarter was another really good example .
that it became really important for the community to remember its French heritage .
it was not so important to remember the Spanish heritage .
so as a result <that kind_of> that kind_of folk history of French Quarter architecture has been really clouded over .
another &~w way it has is through &-um food .
anyone know about jambalaya ?
what's &~j what's jambalaya ?
how do you make jambalaya ?
xxx sausage ⌊ <I mean I don't> ⌋ .
⌈ and rice ⌉ yeah .
and rice .
yeah .
there are African influences definitely in jambalaya but there wasn't any rice in Louisiana until the Spanish arrived .
not a whole lot of it .
and it looks a heck of a lot like paella .
you know about the Spanish dish paella ?
it's indistinguishable except that Louisianans put a_lot_o(f) hot sauce in in their paella .
basically is paella .
so that's another thing that's classically kind_of Louisiana material culture .
it's a contribution from the Spanish but that Spanish &-uh heritage for whatever reason that I'm still interested in figuring out myself +//.
I don't have a real clear answer .
has been forgotten in &-uh folk collective folk memory .
couldn't it just be because like the Spanish were the ones that kinda took over .
like if it had been the other way around wouldn't it have been called like the Spanish Quarter ?
like if the French had taken over ?
yeah I think part of it is that &-um there there was actually a revolution against the &-uh Spanish when they tried to take over .
it &-um it failed and a_lot_of people lost their heads over it .
&-um so there was some animosity between the Spanish administrators and the French populace .
but that after a generation or so actually calmed down and the Spanish were integrated into French Creole culture .
not only that but just from the dates it was French for &~hu almost a hundred years and only Spanish for forty .
yeah although the city itself I was just talking about New Orleans really only starts in seventeen eighteen so it's about equal .
xxx (be)cause it's seventeen eighteen to seventeen +/.
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ sixty five ⌉ seventeen sixty five to eighteen oh five .
so sixteen ninety nine was .
sixteen ninety nine was when the whole territory of Louisiana starts to be settled .
oh +/.
+, the city +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ doesn't ⌉ get started until seventeen eighteen .
and then it's just a little hamlet of huts in the mud +...
the other thing about New Orleans architecture &-um and some changes that occurred there is that the French +...
you_know we know about &~th this architecture only archeologically (be)cause there are no +//.
&~th there's one standing example that I excavated &-um but <it is> I disagree with architectural historians about how old the structure actually is .
&-uh it's called Madam John's Legacy .
if you're ever a tourist in New Orleans or wanna check it out it's in the French Quarter .
if you go and look at it , it gives you the clearest idea of what houses in the French Colonial earlier period actually looked like and they're radically different from the Spanish architecture .
but one thing that they incorporated &-um that French architecture did not have , and this was an example of an adaptation to the environment the colonists hadta make , was building the house basically around a courtyard .
an open air &-uh room was basically how they used it and what they called it .
I_mean if you imagine Louisiana has &~t you_know temperatures in the nineties and ninety percent humidity for four or five months out_of the year .
you really just don't wanna be indoors .
&-um there and the houses are built such to get as maximum ventilation that you can especially breezes coming off the river .
when it's that hot even that doesn't help .
so a_lot_of activities in the summer occurred outside .
so one of the very &-um &-uh quickest adaptations to the environment that occurred architecturally was to start using &~out outdoor space in a different way .
and part of the idea of this +//.
just like we talked about the idea of porches coming from Africa , &-um the courtyard tradition may have also &-um been an idea influenced by &-uh Louisiana's early African &-um pioneers .
(0.5) moving on to my final city example &-um is New York .
and you may be surprised to learn that it was the second city &~o of late eighteenth century America .
it was quite a bit smaller than Philadelphia in seventeen seventy it only had twenty three thousand people .
it's growth like New Orleans &-uh was also driven by river and ocean trade .
it is <the big port> .
and after the &~rev revolution it really that's when it really started to grow and its great period of expansion though doesn't actually happen until later &-uh after the Erie Canal goes in in eighteen twenty five which connects it to the interior &-uh markets of the Great Lakes area and Midwest and upper +...
upstate New York .
(0.4) and it was only then that New York &-uh became a major center &~u center of commodity exchange banking marine insurance and manufacturing .
basically a center of capitalism .
(0.5) it was kind_of the +...
it was the brain center the nervous &-uh system center of the American Industrial Revolution .
(0.5) immigrants &-uh particularly the Irish German Jewish and Italian begam &-uh began to arrive in large numbers in this early nineteenth century .
I'm moving kind of quickly here since it wasn't much of a town to talk about in the late eighteenth we're kind of looking forward to &-uh some of the articles we'll talk about really dealing with the immigrant experience in the antebellum period .
between eighteen twenty and eighteen forty the city's population more than doubled +...
and <ten years later> ten years later in eighteen fifty it had doubled again .
a tremendous rate of growth .
now in terms of an example of material culture what's really interesting to consider about New York at this time there're a_lot_of things and we'll be reading some articles &-uh that deal with really specific domestic space &-uh in New York in the mid nineteenth century but one thing to consider is how the landscape of New York changed .
basically it started off as a kinda hodgepodge town slowly growing town were you just get people creating new streets and houses wherever they needed to go where the ground wasn't too marshy .
that's it so it had kind_of a a fingery funny disorganized &-uh town layout .
but around the time of the revolution you start getting a real adaptation of town planning and grids .
a gridded street system .
being imposed in cities across &-uh the colonies .
this was happening in Europe a little earlier &-uh but there didn't seem to really be a need for it &-uh in America or a kind of cultural value attached to &-uh a real well organized town plan until the Revolutionary era .
it's what the architectural historian I've mentioned before Dell Upton what he calls the Republican City .
in terms of republican values .
a well ordered &-um cityscape influenced by the Enlightenment thinking that everything should be clear and understandable and natural everything in its place .
and this is similar to the Georgian mindset it might be another extension of the Georgian mindset really the Georgian mindset is kind_of a +...
British and American version of this Enlightenment culture .
generally that's coming out_of Europe .
an intellectual movement that's in Europe .
so by the eighteen twenties in New York one way that they were dealing with this influx of population was actually by tearing down parts of the town and rebuilding in a well ordered grid .
the streets intersecting at ninety degree angles .
and part of what this allowed is it allowed you to assign different areas to the poor and the rich they were no longer living side by side cheek by jowl .
there started to grow neighborhoods in New York with distinct ethnic and class identities .
people became uncomfortable &~i it didn't used to be a problem but people started to become uncomfortable living next to people of different colors ethnicities different economic levels .
not across the board xxx from a general trend where this the cityscape itself the landscape itself it starts to get stratified and reflects that general trend in &~strati social stratification &-uh &~h started to &~accu occur in the late eighteenth century .
the other thing that's occurring is this kind of segregation of commercial and domestic space .
where you don't manufacture you don't shop you don't shod a horse on the same street in which gentile people live .
so there start to be commercial &-uh streets and neighborhoods divided off .
and buildings themselves it used to be quite common in the eighteenth century for people to &-um middle class people to build a structure where the the lower part of the structure was for their business whether they were a doctor a grocer a pharmacist even a brewer you could imagine it was quite some smells coming out_of a brewery .
and then the upstairs would be your family's residence .
well that kind of architecture really started to go by the wayside .
at this time .
(0.5) and this kind of &-um reorganization of the urban landscape gradually took over other cities and to to the &~se extent that when you started getting new Western cities built &-um like Cincinnati they were built from the ground up on this grid system and as a result evolved very differently .
and very rapidly .
it also really promoted rapid growth all you'd hafta do is keep extending the grid lines .
it's very easy to do .
okay that's it for my spiel on urbanization around the turn of the eighteenth century any questions ?
okay .
last thing I wanna do before we turn to the readings this shouldn't take too long is that I've realized that there's some +...
archeological vocabulary that's being thrown at you in these articles that I expect might be going over your head but no one's only one person's really emailed me saying that you don't understand X .
and I would like to encourage you +...
to as we keep going through some of these readings are are &~wriv written for a general audience many of them are written for specialists in the field &-um so they're going to assume a level of knowledge and comfort with &-uh archeological terminology that I don't expect you to have so I want you to email me and let me know when you come across terms or concepts that you don't know .
but I've identified a few I'd like to go through .
&-um one that keeps recurring &-um is actually some words invented in &~ei in nineteen sixty five by Lewis Binford &-um archaeologist out_of Michigan we talked about before who really &-uh is considered the the daddy of &-uh &=laughs perceptual archeology .
and he wrote an article in which he tried to really break down the different functions of artifacts if you're gonna take a functional analysis .
have you guys seen authors use this ?
technomic +...
sociotechnic &=writing:board and ideotechnic .
Emily do you remember <any of these> ?
no <I don't> &=laughs I don't know those .
you guys come across these in the readings it's &~co come up a_couple_of times .
&-um technomic it +//.
they're basically what they sound like .
what he tried to do is to say that artifacts can be classified into these three basic types of of functional categories .
so technomic artifacts are &-uh tools that primarily &-uh function to cope with the physical environment .
+, ⌈ and ⌉ uhuh ?
I'm sorry could you repeat what you just said ?
sure .
tools that function primarily to cope with the physical environment .
(0.5) and they're variability is largely &~ex explicable explainable &-uh according to Binford in ecological terms .
in other words you can &-uh you ought to be able to explain why &-uh the Zizi culture uses &-uh flint spearheads whereas the Lulu culture uses only &-uh granite &-uh +...
spears or something .
does that make sense ?
they wouldn't use granite but anyway .
that it should be explainable by the different ecological conditions pertaining to those two cultures .
alright .
sociotechnic are artifacts that function primarily in the social system .
pretty transparent .
(0.7) they have a social function .
ideotechnic artifacts reflect &-uh the most clearly the mental or cognitive component xxx .
and that's their main purpose .
to communicate ideas .
so some historical examples of these might be &-uh a technomic artifact might be a hunting rifle .
it's primarily used as a tool to deal with the environment .
a sociotechnic might be a petticoat used in women's dress it mainly has a social aspect IE to communicate femininity .
it has some we'll talk about this some technomic function too to keep you warm .
but it but since women continued to wear thick petticoats even in very hot weather it hadta have some more some other function besides ecological .
and an ideotechnic historic artifact might be a rosary .
a set of rosary beads .
mainly &-uh communicates religious ideas has symbolic significance for its user .
now the main problem as I kind of hinted already with this typology is that you can have one artifact do all three things .
anyone think of an example ?
candles .
candles ?
you wanna +//.
that that actually was one used in the reading wasn't it ?
yeah .
yeah what did they say ?
who who was it that did that ?
I can't remember .
+, ⌈ was it Deetz ?
yeah ⌉ +/.
+, I think it mighta been Deetz .
the first Deetz reading .
and what did he say ?
&-um well it was technomic because you could use it to light your house .
mhm +/.
+, and it was &-um +//.
I forget the &~soc socio one xxx .
candlelit dinner I think ⌊ to create a &~r ⌋ .
⌈ people gather around it ⌉ .
was that it ?
people gather around it .
⌊ a social function ⌋ .
⌈ mhm ⌉ to create an &~at an atmosphere either for romance or entertainment .
mhm to &~s to facilitate social interactions .
uhuh and what was the third ?
&-um like a church in a church xxx .
mhm .
like a prayer candle .
signify a prayer .
so these are useful things to think about but don't ever like with your using these ideas in your &-uh research projects don't get in the habit of thinking that your artifact type only only serves one function .
it might actually be a really good challenge to think about like a hunting rifle &~wh what &~i &~i its technomic aspect is quite clear but what can you do to identify its &-um sociotechnic and ideotechnic does it have those functions ?
what might they be ?
they may not be as obvious but there might be there .
and that might be a good way to spur your analysis .
okay other &-um simple &~s &-um vocabulary much of which I expect you know some of this is vocabulary and some of this is &~so &~li like the toolkits of historical archaeologists just to wanna make sure you understand .
&-um stratigraphy I think we've talked about this +...
anyone wanna just define stratigraphy for me ?
like the layering of the it's like the levels of an archeological site like that which is below is older than that which is above .
right .
it's the layers in the ground .
and feature &=writing:board very generic sounding word that archaeologists they use it a_lot to mean something specific .
or relatively specific .
<that one> ?
+, mhm ?
isn't +//.
I think it's the manmade stuff .
⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ mhm ⌉ .
yeah &~i a manmade &-uh change that you can read in the ground .
(0.4) so a strata layer itself is really a kind of feature .
if it's a cultural strata .
you can also have &~na what's called natural &~strat strata which is just geological they have no traces of human activity .
right ?
so a layer in the ground that's a result of trash &~depos deposition or a living surface where people have been living for a long time and things have accumulated that's a kind of feature .
a trash pit .
this create a hole in the ground is a feature .
a trench for a building foundation is a feature .
if you have some of the foundation itself that's a feature .
if you have a stain in the ground where you had a rotted piece of wood from one of those earth fast buildings for example that would be a feature +...
okay ?
&-um context a very generic word .
but when archaeologists use context it can mean two things .
they either mean it's excavation context what they call the archeological context which means where was an artifact found in &~rel in the strata in the layers of the ground .
maybe there're different strata .
what was the context was it found in .
was this &-um sixteen seventy six coin found in a nineteenth century level ?
is that its context ?
then what does that mean ?
other context is obviously cultural context historical context .
if this coin was found in &~a in the archeological context of the nineteenth century layer what does that mean culturally and historically ?
was it a charm ?
was it an heirloom +..?
make sense ?
okay these are more specific types of features midden .
what's midden ?
like a trash pile or a trashlike pile .
yeah .
corner of the cave or whatever where +/.
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ there's ⌉ trash .
a trash deposit .
it can a layer it can be in a pit it can be in a pile it doesn't really matter .
it means a archeological feature that was gradually usually gradually yeah it's midden it's gradual .
a gradual accumulation of trash .
as opposed to a trash deposit which could have +//.
that's a more generic term it could have been done very quickly as in Deetz's &-um discoveries at Flowerdew of those huge trash deposits that look like they happened in a weekend .
okay but midden is a gradual accumulation .
sheet refuse &=writing:board and also midden usually has the implication that there's a_lot_of organic material food remains biological remains you know what that is .
sheet refuse .
this is more used in &~historic midden's used prehistorically as_well_as historically .
sheet refuse is a little more common for historical archaeologists to talk about .
it's a little more visible historic xxx .
(0.5) there were some definitions in the reading anyone wanna take a stab at it ?
mhm ?
mhm like people would just kinda like throw their trash out instead of putting it in one specific place so it just kind_of covered everything .
yeah kind_of a a blanket distribution of accidental trash as opposed to intentional trash deposits which a midden would be .
I guarantee you that wherever you live &~un unless your backyard or front yard has been &-um recently graded and filled in that if you were to do a little archeological dig you would find a button here a the tab of a &~c Coke can there maybe a few bones .
not very dense but kind of scattered around accidentally dropped you know on your way to taking the trash to the can the bottom fell out and some stuff fell down things like that .
that's sheet refuse .
okay it's scattered around the yard .
and it hasta do with +//.
usually a yard it can be a living surface as_well .
it's very thin .
but particularly in cases where you're where on a site that trash has been &~r particularly in the historical area era or an urban context the trash has been moved off+site because it's smelly accumulates too much in a dense urban space sheet refuse might be your only archeological context .
&-uh other than architectural features .
okay .
&-um going on to the kind_of toolkits what about mean ceramic dating .
we talked about these a little but I just they're getting used so much in the articles I really want you to have a firm idea of what they're +//.
they mean .
you don't need to know how to do it necessarily just understand what they're talking about when people say well we've performed this kind of analysis on the ceramics .
what does this mean ?
isn't that when you have &-um you count how many pieces of which types of ceramics you have and then you can &-um find out the percentages and compare that to xxx different ceramics .
mhm right .
+, ⌈ exactly ⌉ .
yeah .
you take a sherd count you figure out where the peak is and you average things out and you end up with a date that should be the midpoint of occupation for whatever context you're analyzing .
and usually you would perform this if you were a good archaeologist you would only perform this on one level at a time .
one stratigraphic layer or one feature .
sometimes they lump (th)em altogether which is okay if you have a short occupied &~s &~si site that's built up really quickly it's only been occupied for twenty years you might get an accurate date .
but if your site's been occupied for two hundred years and you try to do mean ceramic dating on it you you'll get a date that won't make a whole lot o(f) sense .
(be)cause as we go through time what happens with ceramics in general with material goods ?
thinking from the seventeenth century forward ?
turn to dust .
what ?
they disintegrate ⌊ eventually ⌋ .
⌈ right ⌉ the older they are the less likely that they preserve but also for the later types from the Industrial Revolution forward from the eighteen twenties forward you get a huge general increase in the number of ceramics and material goods that people have in their houses .
so that if you average those numbers out you you're gonna get a falsely late date <just because &~const> because people just had more stuff the later you go in time .
so that's one caveat you really need to keep in mind .
&-uh ceramic price indexing this is really important and we'll continue to rereference this xxx when we get into class analysis .
but it also came up in the readings for this week .
what is this ?
how do you do it ?
(0.7) .
you know how much usually the different kinds of pottery are worth so you can tell kind of the economic status that &-uh whoever occupied that site .
right very similar to &~ce to mean ceramic dating the way you apply it you need to apply it to a very discrete context .
you take only the ceramics from one level hopefully no more than about twenty years about one &~h about a half a generation .
and you total all the sherd counts put them into the different types creamware &~pu pearlware porcelain whatever and then you look up in these tables that are actually based on &-uh on manufacturer's price guides you know recommended retail what what do you call that ?
manufacturer's suggested retail ⌊ price ⌋ .
⌈ yes ⌉ .
exactly .
there were lists for those that the &-uh English potteries that were creating the majority of the ceramics &-uh put out in the &-uh eighteenth century and early nineteenth century .
and so this archaeologist found these lists buried in the archives and just said hey look now we know how much people are paying for their goods .
then you need to apply it in as careful a way as you do the mean ceramic dating (be)cause if you apply it to too large a span may not be +//.
you're not +//.
it makes no sense .
and the way they they calculated it is they made creamware number one it's worth one it's it's &~a arbitrary it can be worth one penny one dollar it doesn't matter .
but then everything's in relationship to one for that time period .
does that make sense ?
okay so it's a way to figure out how you can compare sites how much people were paying for ceramics .
how much money went into their ceramics .
it may not tell you a whole lot about economic status if that wasn't an important form of display of economic status .
do you understand what I'm saying ?
how much did ceramics cost &-um in comparison to maybe a week's salary ?
that's a really good question .
I mean you'd hafta ask that question really specifically like say for one of those Philadelphia laborers .
and you pin it down to an exact year .
&-um in one of the articles I believe it's the Yench article she talks about how laborers couldn't afford creamware &-uh in the +//.
when it was really at its peak amongst the elites .
but twenty years later because it had become outmoded they could .
make sense ?
mhm +/.
+, I would say for most of the time period prior to the &-um Civil War most laborer class people could not afford new fashionable ceramics .
they'd be purchasing used or at least outmoded styles .
okay &-um three more in@s:fra situ@s:fra +...
another term people I'm underlining (be)cause it's usually italicized this is Latin .
they'll use this all the time and just assume you know what it means .
xxx Emily you wanna xxx ?
xxx where it's found like without having it been disturbed like by the people that are excavating it or whatever .
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ so ⌉ you can study it in@s:fra situ@s:fra like where it was found in the ground .
okay .
in place it means literally .
so if it's +//.
so if you're studying a house foundation in@s:fra situ@s:fra it means that as you've excavated you've revealed the house foundation and you're leaving it there you're not gonna pull it up as you excavate .
one thing you need to realize about excavations is that by and large archaeologists destroy what they're interested in studying as they go layer by layer .
if I remove this twentieth century layer and I might remove it with a trowel and and put it in a screen and and get all the dirt out pull out all the artifacts but once I've pulled it up it's gone I can never look at it again .
but if I find a a brick foundation +...
here .
I can either remove the bricks as I'm going one layer at a time or I can leave it in@s:fra situ@s:fra .
remember we talked about pedestaling that neat technique that Deetz talked about that's a way of leaving things in@s:fra situ@s:fra is leaving them in relationship to where they were found in the ground .
alright and two more that you guys probably already know +//.
well we already talked about these but you might as well make them clear .
terminus@s:fra post@s:fra quem@s:fra &=writing:board and terminus@s:fra +...
anti@s:fra quem@s:fra &=writing:board what are they and what are some examples ?
isn't &~termi@s:fra terminus@s:fra post@s:fra quem@s:fra is just the last possible date that an artifact is used and anti@s:fra quem@s:fra is xxx the earliest ?
well it's not necessarily &~rela it's an artifact telling you about the date of a context of a feature of a strata .
so so you use an artifact to tell you one of these two things .
so it would be an example of an artifact that can give me a terminus@s:fra post@s:fra quem@s:fra date it gives you a date is what is does .
meaning that literally terminus@s:fra post@s:fra quem@s:fra means it hasta have ended after this .
what is the this ?
the context .
the context whatever that is archeologically a layer a feature a foundation it hasta be older than this .
anyone think of an example ?
ceramics .
mhm .
and more specifically or .
well you could like look at the style of ceramic and then you would know the date that like the decade or whatever that that was you know popular or ⌊ whatever ⌋ .
⌈ that it ⌉ or that it first +//.
what you wanna do for a terminus@s:fra post@s:fra quem@s:fra is not look at popularity which is what you look at for mean ceramic dating you &~lis look at the earliest time that it was created +/.
oh +/.
+, when it first showed up on the scene when it was first manufactured .
so underneath this &~founda foundation I find a sherd of creamware which is usually abbreviated CC .
creamware is really &~w the first record of it being manufactured is seventeen sixty two .
so that's buried directly beneath the &~r the last row of bricks of my foundation here .
so what does that mean about &~tha the structure for this foundation ?
it hasta be later than seventeen sixty two .
yeah it hasta be later than seventeen sixty two .
it doesn't mean that the structure was built in seventeen sixty two it could have been built in nineteen twenty .
but we at least know it doesn't go earlier than that .
okay so terminus@s:fra anti@s:fra quem@s:fra is a little less common .
can you think of a a a way in which when you get say that same sherd or a coin or something .
where you would get an indication that something hadta be before ?
in other words &~th well +//.
use the example of the brick foundation .
what could you find in association with the brick foundation that would give you a final ending that that this say +//.
well I don't wanna put a date on it yet depending on what your example is but that tells you that that building hadta have been constructed before X date ?
(0.9) .
type of material that was no longer used or that you couldn't find anymore after that date ?
yeah that's a possibility .
you might want +//.
that that is a very good possibility &-um say bricks imported from England and say that you know that bricks were no &~lon were never imported in from England anymore after eighteen seventy .
then you could say well that &~h that structure was probably +//.
now in this case you can't be as sure because what happened with brick ?
reused .
<it can> get reused .
so that one you you'd need some other thing .
&~a another a better example might be see this xxx here this is actually an asphalt parking lot that when I went into the city records I found that it was paved over in nineteen twenty .
well that's kinda early for an asphalt parking lot let's say nineteen thirty +...
so I now have this wonderful dating I'm being ironic here .
I know that this structure was built sometime between seventeen sixty two and nineteen thirty when it was capped and covered over by an asphalt parking lot .
okay does that make sense ?
so that's why terminus@s:fra anti@s:fra quem@s:fra is a little less common because you you don't it's not always clear when something really ended because of reuse particularly <in Michigan> .
xxx take a break we'll come back &-um .
let's come back in a few minutes before a quarter (un)til .
right ?
everybody come a few minutes early xxx
