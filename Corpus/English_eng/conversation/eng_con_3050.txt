and &-um Amanda came up with the idea of just holding their core
you just see them doing that . 5340_6140
so they found the speediest way in the whole class to make through
so that helped them . 12240_13020
anything surprising . 14480_15140
you didn't expect . 16600_17120
no . 17920_18030
unlike yesterday . 18230_18950
no nope nope not yet today . 20230_21870
so &-um no nothing really they're they're going well because
the overall I was like . 30130_30870
uhoh . 30920_31120
what_if today when I say make two-sided core squares . 31170_33070
we are back at square one . 33160_34710
and maybe this is the time that they have trouble with that .
but no not really they didn't . 37500_39590
and I think they enjoy the chance now to work in pairs . 39750_42440
and I saw them doing lots_of &-um appropriate talking with
so . 49890_49960
what do you mean . 50080_50560
can you give some examples of that . 50750_51830
I'm not sure when I heard them talking about flips and turns .
oh you can just do an up down flip . 54890_56110
you know they said that . 56330_56880
and the other kid reached out and did what one had said . 56930_58910
not the person who said it did it . 59070_60510
one person said it . 60630_61470
the other did it the other . 61490_62390
and the person who said it was going . 62630_63670
ah-huh so that way communicating about motion . 64500_66670
but also just talking about what part is the core where what part
what you you know &-um you have to divide that . 71620_74110
just &-um they were thinking together . 74130_76790
and that was good . 76870_77510
so it shows that that quilt family booklet that comes first is
it gives us a chance to &-um cement in lots_of that important
which is why when we quit even_though there's several kids who
we were all at the point where we all shared enough income . 96070_98630
and that we were ready to go on and make &-um 'cause two weeks from
but it's usefulness been served . 105110_106840
and I saw that today because kids who didn't finish that knew what
and they didn't . 112730_113240
and they handled that . 113290_113910
so we'll see how some of them scale down those designs on graph
because there are several kids who never got to that point for the
so that will be challenging . 122210_123030
but they have someone to help them . 123050_124160
they don't have to do it on their own . 124710_125840
so I think . 126510_127200
nope . 128000_128100
no surprises . 128660_129229
just that we a couple days behind schedule . 129280_131080
we're hoping by the end of tomorrow day that's . 132690_134150
what schedules are for . 134210_134690
and that probably won't happen . 135230_136310
anything else . 136930_137070

strat . 400690_400860
well this is I invented two by two design . 401040_403300
and we sort of made a pattern . 403320_404740
see here it's &-um two green triangles two red triangles two green
and then on the bottom it's two red triangles two green triangles
Astra do you like this . 417370_418460
pet . 418580_418750

can you call me when you are on your next design . 488100_490110
no . 491710_491830
I'm not on my next design . 491900_492860

now I'm gonna check . 507600_508090
okay . 509750_509960
I'll start with red . 510040_511110
this one . 511190_511530
I'll start with green this whole second . 511990_516950
can you tell me girls . 520830_521510
what is the pattern on this one . 521559_523270
how did you make . 523500_524179
flip . 525150_525370
this is sort of like a triangle . 526830_528170
this is sort of ten . 528590_529870
it looks like a tent right there . 530980_532470
and then a rectangle then a tent and then a rectangle and then a
and then a that would be a rectangle . 537790_539350
so what how did you make it . 540500_541900
so we did flip copy core . 543220_545220
we yeah we flipped it . 545780_548110
we did which one do you like . 548420_554810
better . 554880_555070
this one or this . 555610_556260
make two more . 559190_560510
after this flipped it and copied what copy the core copy core . 560560_566710
