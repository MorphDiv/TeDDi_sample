xxx okay a few announcements +...
a few announcements .
before we begin I get a_lot_of email questions and you can keep telling me lots_of questions about project number three . 50415_56075
just to remind you for project number three which is due on Wednesday +... 57315_61395
&=writes:board you have to basically combine everything you learned from project one and project two . 63775_69415
ultimately that's the goal . 69615_70695
the idea is that instead of looking for a homolog that is only homologous with amino acid residues at particular places in a protein you are now looking at homologs in space . 71115_83115
so it's spatial or structural homologs that are the focus for project number three (0.4) you use the DALI server . 84355_95495
the DALI server superimposes two thirty dimensional maps right on top of each_other . 96795_102955
the problem with the DALI is unless you have the proper plugins on your computer that you're using you can't print directly from the DALI server . 103455_111075
so you download the file that is the thirty dimensional superimposition &=writing:board I think most things that you download are given for whatever reason the name QZ I have no idea why don't ask me why . 111515_137075
but the PDB hasta be appended to the end of the name so that RASMOL will recognize it . 136325_141285
download it directly into your folder that carries RASMOL on your computer and then you have a kind of abbreviated thirty dimensional layout . 141445_148845
so it's really important that you recognize that the superimposition is not the combination the straight linear combination of two of these files because in_order_to superimpose things in the space you have to move the positions of all of the atoms of the u@l one protein to meet up with the atoms of the other protein . 149565_168705
so these are not either of them this three d@l superimposition they are not directly the same RASMOL files for the &~indivi individual proteins okay ? 169405_179225
is that clear ? 180085_180865
you cannot often manipulate this thing that you call a downloaded three d@l superimposition . 181445_187705
alright ? 188665_188685
you can't manipulate it . 188765_189825
you can only print this in &=writes:board backbone because it is not a continuous file . 190025_196385
so unless you're very lucky and you just happen to pick proteins that can be very much &-uh conserved when they're put into the three d@l superimposition you will have a discontinuous point by point array that shows the three d@l overlap and you only can print that using backbone or I think points . 196985_214545
I'm trying to remember what it is . 215485_216665
you can do individual points that don't help you at all to trace the backbone of the molecule . 217265_221725
so print that in backbone . 222185_223625
you are only required to print one superimposition . 223945_228245
if you wish you can print more . 229105_231085
you can select things in that overlapped view if you want . 231545_234945
but often it's harder to deal with this particular file rather than going +//. 235345_239245
once you download the three d@l superimposition be careful to write down what the P PDB file number is for the other protein . 239745_247245
you have to check it off in_order_to get it superimposed . 247785_249985
so check that other &=writes:board PDB file number okay ? 250465_257005
that's important . 257245_257845
you have to use that as an extension code then you go to the PDB Searchlite . 258065_262025
you plug in that PDB accession number &=writing:board then you use RASMOL on this three times +... 262325_274625
to highlight residues that are in your paper . 278205_281005
because the other thing that the PDB Searchlite gives you when you plug in your accession number is a primary citation that tells you the paper that shows you where the paper is what article it was what journal it's been published in that &~dir that is directly the report of this guy's structure . 281805_298905
whatever that protein is if it's that structural paper . 299205_305245
then you can get the citation there if you're very lucky and some of you I think have gone to great pains and at great lengths to make sure that you only get a paper that you can download directly . 303365_312345
that's okay just anything to avoid going to the library isn't that true ? 312705_316405
is that what you guys are doing ? 316965_317965
anything +//. 318125_318545
no okay . 318965_319305
some of you are not <out_of the loop> . 319485_321025
no not too many .
I have a feeling I'm gonna see a_lot_of Medline reports +//.
structural paper you should have you do not need to turn in the paper but make sure that you give me the +//. 329365_332445
you can &~a actually just printout this Searchlite &-um that's as good as a FAFSA report actually . 332825_338805
if you just print out that page that has the citation in it . 339265_342285
one page discussion and that discussion should include the three pictures +... 342685_347325
I wanted you highlight the certain things &=noise_disruption in those pictures . 350045_354925
some good examples would be highlight the catalytic residues . 354975_358855
what does your protein do ? 359275_360395
some of you will have a protein that's a homolog but only overlaps with a very small portion of your protein . 360655_366995
&~o of SQD one . 367275_368175
they only overlap a small portion that's fine . 368295_370495
some of you pretty much the whole proteins will overlap . 370615_372975
that's fine too . 373335_373855
you don't hafta necessarily highlight what is conserved spatially if everything in the protein is conserved except that little loop in the SQD one right ? 374305_383805
I mean just highlight the whole homolog so keep that in mind . 383885_387625
catalytic function whatever +...
structural analyses you hafta read the paper to do that part +... 388165_399865
any questions whatsoever on this ? 402855_404675
is it okay to have one area of sequence homology or do you not want that at all ? 405635_409715
oh that's fine . 409875_410555
absolutely you mean highlight it ? 410835_411835
amino acid &~homo homology . 412235_413855
yes but did you &~me are you saying that you have one sequence highlighted on your protein ? 414975_418475
that is an amino acid sequence &~homo &~homo &~ho &=sound_effect homolog ? 418895_421775
yeah .
even though it's structurally it's &-um amino acid also ? 421955_426115
it's not necessarily . 426835_427955
it would depend did you do multiple line ? 428235_429655
yeah .
okay . 431305_431525
so it depends if you have done multiline you &~wou might be dramatically &~disc &-uh &~suh actually dismayed to find that a_lot_of your proteins are not sequentially homologous . 431705_442005
but the GG X G . 442425_444265
yes that's fine . 444265_445065
and if you wanna highlight that that's great . 445185_446665
you are not required I don't believe I dropped multiline out_of the requirement because it would take a_lot more time to do a sequence analysis of your proteins . 447105_455405
but if you want to don't be amazed if your proteins are really not homologous in terms of their sequence . 455655_462415
it's the space that that's the +//. 462715_465015
that's what the DALI server is doing is showing how they look in space . 465215_467735
any questions whatsoever ? 468415_470055
I haven't even been on email yet today just in case you're wondering why I haven't replied . 470555_475795
I have this haunting suspicion that there's lots_of email so I hope I'm getting a_lot_of your &~a of your questions answered here which should do that . 476655_483915
yes Andy ?
by looking at the two overlapping structures how are you supposed to determine where it is structurally homologous . 487605_491085
by looking at the two overlapping where you're supposed ⌈ to &~t ⌉ . 492225_493945
⌊ when ⌋ you have the superimposition picture would it how does it help you determine where each molecule itself ⌈ xxx ⌉ ? 493945_499325
⌊ you're ⌋ gonna hafta guess where they're homologous . 499405_502025
that's what I'm saying if you've only got a small section you can probably trace the backbone . 502105_505845
if you've got the whole overview look for things in SQD one that you're used to &-um identifying . 506325_511725
look for the Rawson fold . 512005_513205
if you can see where that is then you can see where yours is with relation to that . 513445_518265
you can in many cases select things that you've already selected in SQD one . 518725_522445
you can select them in the overlap view . 523025_525165
and that might also give you some idea as to what is actually homologous . 525705_529045
if you know for instance the &~se the sequence of amino acids that make the Rawson fold select it on your +//. 529445_536045
really overlapping see whether that's where the homolog is positioned . 536485_539305
but taking a guess is just fine I mean the overlap will show me where the homology is . 541225_546625
so don't worry that you hafta get exactly that residue on any of your RASMOL . 547165_550805
I don't care if you don't highlight that at all . 550885_552745
and highlight other specific things that you think plays an important part of function or structure of your homolog . 553145_558545
okay ? 559405_559765
okay remember there's an exam on yes ? 560085_563485
⌈ Friday ⌉ .
⌊ did you want ⌋ the article <with the> with the report ? 563925_566965
did I want the +/. 567365_568005
+, do you want us to put the article ⌈ with xxx ⌉ . 568025_569025
⌊ no ⌋ it's just gonna make +//. 568985_570205
you know don't kill any more trees +/.
&=laughs okay +/.
+, to make me an extra copy of that . 572065_573425
think of all the plants and what they do for us with this bill and everything . 574165_577465
exam Friday ten to twelve your last exam . 578205_581765
that's cause for celebration alone isn't it ? 583145_585305
and you might think that's why the bagels are in here today but they're not . 585525_588825
they're in here because this is the lecture on insulin and glucagon so I am feeding you to help you see firsthand the effects of hormonal signals . 588925_600725
okay ? 601905_601965
that's the key . 602025_602605
so again let's make this real casual you come down here anytime and help yourself to this this wonderful feast . 602825_610025
there's a_lot_of bagels left so feel free . 610565_612705
to come down at any time . 613445_614425
let's review . 614985_615725
this by the way is a great diagram it's on page seven fifty six in Leninger . 616005_621065
let's review what we've looked at so far . 621585_623285
for all of our studies to date the catabolic and the anabolic pathways we've pretty much been focused on a few different kinds of cells in us . 623625_634065
those kinds of cells are the liver cells or the &=writes:board hepatocytes &=writing:board which also have a very dramatic role in anabolic and catabolic regulation and to some extent we've looked at fat cells . 635345_654285
&=writing:board storage diglycerides and let's just review again what's going on here . 685315_687715
in the liver cells what's the liver do ? 688115_689775
what's the major important thing that the liver does ? 690075_692655
it's the major place for production and distribution of what ? 692975_698055
glucose .
glucose that's one thing . 698375_700335
&=writing:board glucose production main goal . 704995_708675
so it does a_lot_of glycogen breakdown &=writing:board it does a_lot_of glycogen synthesis which is xxx a major storage place of sugars . 709195_724555
it does a_lot_of glycolysis well actually relative to other cells it doesn't do a_lot_of glycolysis . 725655_730775
it does far more gluconeogenesis . 730915_739175
it doesn't necessarily need a_lot of metabolic you know input to keep its own system running . 733265_740645
so its major focus is the production of glucose . 741245_743745
and the production of glucose because it is a central molecule can happen both from glycogen breakdown &=writing:board and from +... 744165_759005
gluconeogenesis .
that is the reproduction of glucose from wherever we've stopped the pathway . 763145_769325
pyruvate even beyond in some organisms . 769505_772685
and that's called &{l=WRITING gluconeogenesis &}l=WRITING and what's a premier example of this ? 773965_781585
lactic acid that builds up in these cells can't go right back into glycolysis whatever lean muscle cell . 782025_789765
they hafta be shipped lactic acid molecules hafta be shipped all the way to the liver liver can turn it back into pyruvate and who wouldn't take pyruvate through those three bypasses &=sneeze:SUm that's +//. 789955_801595
god bless you that's what's really noticeable and notable of the &~glyc &-uh &~gluconeogenis gluconeogenic pathway . 801835_809355
it's the fact that it's pretty much the same as glycolysis that there's only three different enzymatic reactions in glycolysis having to be reversed with the use of bypasses +... 809955_820015
can you name me the bypasses ? 820615_824615
do you remember the first bypass ? 824895_827615
it's that really ornate one that goes out into the mitochondria out_of the mitochondria that's a very complex one with the pyruvate carboxylase and two other enzymes the malate dehydrogenase . 828435_839935
so that's the first very ornate bypass . 839755_842655
the second bypass would be which one ? 843155_845635
it's the bypass of PFK one . 846755_849415
so it's done by &~FB s@l f@l one six bisphosphatase more than a mouthful . 850015_855675
you guys I know just remember the abbreviations are define FBPase . 856755_863455
what's the third and final bypass ? 864755_866475
hexokinase +/.
+, hexokinase &=writing:board hexokinase bypass is what ? 875725_877145
(0.5) what is the enzyme ? 878245_881965
hexokinase doesn't produce itself +...
what's it called ? 882105_887265
glucose six oxidase .
(o)kay ?
that's the bypass .
alright and very notable the liver's the only set of cells that carries the final bypass . 897495_906275
this is probably the most important one in distinguishing liver atrophy and muscle atrophy . 907355_913075
okay ? 913895_914295
huge glycogen stores what else is the liver involved in ? 914435_918355
what else is the liver involved in ? 919275_921935
it's the garbage collector . 921975_923635
it's involved in sending out sterols and in picking up sterols and fatty acids you know HDL and LDL you should know that whole trafficking idea let's just call it sterol glycogen trafficking . 924665_941685
&=writing:board so it's got a very big goal . 942465_948565
and that's just the liver . 949405_950445
muscle is dramatically different . 951265_953365
what is muscle's main goal ? 953245_954625
activity that's it's main goal . 954885_957425
all activity all the time even when resting it's actually active by most cellular standards . 957745_964525
so it has very little glycogen stores because think of the mass of the muscle cell . 965185_971325
you know they're not big in size they're not a big organ individual set of muscles for instance . 972065_978305
so it has very little glycogen stores +... 978925_980405
it breaks it down in times of activity . 984105_986225
immediately to glucose one phosphate and glucose six phosphate . 986705_989825
it is brought and the skeletal muscle for instance goes directly into glycolysis . 990685_1014085
&=writing:board so the goals are very different at this point . 1010575_1013155
the main goal of the liver is to produce glucose . 1015135_1017255
that is not so of skeletal muscle . 1018535_1020535
more activity more breakdown it does very little gluconeogenesis by itself . 1021595_1026835
in fact what would be its point to making glucose ? 1027175_1029955
what would be the point for the muscle to make glucose ? 1030655_1033975
to use it ? 1034515_1036335
to use it it's already using it there would be no point to reverse that . 1036095_1039315
so it's always <gonna do> this as much as it can . 1039975_1042035
but it doesn't do the muscle any benefit to be able to reverse all of glycolysis . 1042335_1048835
yes ? 1049255_1049415
would the muscle create glucose if the blood &~gl glucose dropped precipitously and there was like danger to the whole organism or something ? 1049715_1055295
no &~be &~w <it might> it might reverse this to some extent but it would never be able to send it out to other cells . 1055395_1061795
oh that's right (be)cause it doesn't have the ⌈ &~hexokina xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ it has no bypass ⌋ . 1063495_1065735
it has no bypass so you would never even if it can reverse with the first bypass the pyruvate bypass it could never send it all the way to glucose itself . 1066315_1075895
whatever glucose is in there is trapped in there and that's why muscles have another storage molecule &=writes:board which I am sure any of you who have ever been to the General Nutrition Center <have you> have you seen it ? 1076215_1085235
the General +//.
creatine or creatine phosphate . 1091865_1093365
it actually is a very similar molecule to one that we've looked at before &=writing:board . 1094285_1100885
&-uh &=writing:board xxx it doesn't really matter xxx . 1105085_1115245
I think this is it &=writing:board . 1124075_1124935
what this molecule allows the muscles to do is xxx &=noise_disruption allow glycogen storage . 1127435_1133875
it allows itself to become phosphorylated directly using ATP <by an enzyme called> creatine kinase &=writing:board on the terminal nitrogen . 1134455_1154055
&=writing:board so what this does is just continue the balance of this enzyme's activity it can store a_lot_of potential energy in creatine phosphate . 1171585_1201445
because if the enzyme gets a total amount of this that's rising it can drive its reaction forward or backwards as long as the levels of this increase &=writing:board as a result of driving this reaction ? 1183435_1208355
you make ATP . 1209035_1211415
this is one of the major &~stor storage molecules in muscle cells . 1212665_1217525
and they can <slow out> this concentration is very high in muscle cells . 1217805_1220965
and in just by shifting the equilibrium harvest ATP enough ATP to keep their muscles going even without having to go through this whole pathway . 1221485_1230505
so lactic acid is a way that muscles have developed to bypass the need for NAD plus . 1231025_1237445
you remember lactic acid in the Cori cycle ? 1237885_1239705
muscles who are working very quickly can't afford to have to wait all that you know aerobic kind_of exercise . 1240825_1248645
they hafta be able to regenerate NAD plus very quickly in_order_to keep just this part going . 1249145_1255565
so lactic acid builds up and you've regenerated NAD plus . 1256745_1264025
&=writes:board just a reminder Cori cycle that's where the formation this so that glycolysis can keep going . 1265545_1272545
this whole idea this enzyme which is very heavily regulated by hormonal influences &=correcting_writing_on_board influenseses you know what I mean . 1275365_1295405
a hormonal regulation that's what causes this kind of storage to be able to keep the muscles going even when they're not being fed glucose for great periods of time (0.4) different roles completely different roles . 1287855_1304415
same with this one a different role in general . 1305135_1307395
it's mostly storage of fats fats are not the premier compound for metabolic purposes . 1307855_1312995
they are something used when sugars are in short supply . 1313485_1316785
all these cells have different hormonal signals targeting them . 1317505_1320705
because they have different roles . 1321085_1322225
mainly from liver glucagon is the major hormone that targets the liver . 1323265_1328445
&=writing:board I'm not so concerned that you read the first part of chapter twenty two for information that would be on the exam . 1329845_1341305
that is what cells produce all of these things the &~pa pancreatic d@l cells those I'm not concerned with . 1341335_1348455
I don't care that you know exactly which part of the brain or which gland produces any of these things but you should know which ones target which kinds of cells . 1348995_1356135
glucagon major major influences are probably the cells . 1356695_1360015
that's where the biggest pool of glucagon type receptors are . 1360335_1365795
muscle cells epinephrine &=writing:board can hit them too . 1363515_1378475
&=writing:board insulin affects all of these . 1378835_1387255
insulin will have a different kind of affect on all of these cells . 1388205_1392305
it targets all of them . 1392505_1393365
that means you will find insulin receptors on all of these types of cells . 1393445_1397485
somatostatin &=writing:board vasopressin +...
the blood pressure one +... 1432265_1433305
that targets these cell types and specifically the cells that bind the capillaries and things that's when that's why this has the most &~bla blood pressure effects . 1437425_1448465
it's also involved in the kidney functions so kidney cells those have a_lot_of vasopressin type receptors . 1449045_1454765
it's the blood pressure one .
&=writing:board okay what is somatostatin's effects ? 1463475_1465635
somatostatin is what actually regulates glucagon and insulin together . 1465895_1469615
yeah ?
is vasopressin a hormone ?
it is yes +... 1469975_1473755
yes &=writes:board xxx here we go . 1479275_1483515
somatostatin is mainly involved in the balance keeping the balance on the insulin and glucagon signals . 1484235_1489015
so what kind of ordinase@n is signaling others when the glucagon especially in those cell types that would have both signals going on . 1490105_1497225
for instance which ones would have both insulin and glucagon ? 1497665_1500505
&=points_to_board this one .
this one .
not so much in the &~mesa muscle cells right ? 1500725_1505025
because glucagon glucagon isn't going to really target those muscle cells . 1505125_1508705
so this one is basically regulates +... 1509085_1512725
insulin +... 1515845_1516745
with and versus we can have it <as a> &~conta as a competition . 1518875_1522575
insulin versus glucagon . 1523075_1525795
and it's mainly in liver +... 1526315_1529015
okay ? 1529735_1531955
so let's talk a little bit more about what these coordinating signals do +... 1532335_1538115
&=changing_blackboard don't be worried it almost never falls . 1541255_1543575
I've been told that . 1543995_1544775
okay hormonal signals how does a hormone work ? 1545835_1550495
it is produced by very specialized cells +... 1550915_1556915
in organs or in glands . 1558035_1561395
&=writing:board so we're mainly talking about hormones like the peptide and the amine hormones . 1561875_1573695
okay we're not talking about those steroid derived hormones that are locally produced and locally effecters . 1573835_1579415
&=writing:board through the bloodstream which tells you a little bit about their solubility . 1583115_1596535
they target only those cells that have specific receptors . 1599195_1604155
&=writing:board these are of_course I better put it up here peptide and amines because at the very end we talked about steroid hormones and those have a different mode of activity . 1615455_1629995
specific receptors that means they don't just get picked up from the bloodstream wherever there's a low concentration and have their effects in their cells . 1630995_1638175
they actually target only very specific cells . 1638575_1641415
so when those glands turn on the production of these hormones they're going through your bloodstream at high levels . 1641715_1649495
and turning off that signal means that it will take some time for the bloodstream's hormonal levels to decrease . 1650075_1655915
there is a turnover time involved . 1656235_1658075
so with every hormonal signal the key hasta be and for every signal at all for every signal in every cell all the time the key to signalling is that there hasta be an on and an off switch +... 1658595_1676475
otherwise it's not a signal . 1680355_1681575
otherwise it's just a continuum . 1682115_1683535
&=writing:board so the regulation of all these hormones is involved with how to turn on the signal and how to turn that signal off by itself there hasta be to some extent the autoregulation . 1694295_1705515
and that's what we focus on . 1707815_1709255
&=writing:board now if it is a signal it somehow is a pulse . 1711355_1718595
it is not a continuous thing . 1719715_1721755
so that what would be the point of signalling then you +//. 1721855_1724235
then you'd hafta have another signal come round to turn it off . 1724235_1726675
consider autoregulation . 1727135_1728555
that's really important . 1728835_1729655
and how do cells determine what effects those particular hormones will have on them ? 1730355_1736635
well the individual cells that are targeted by hormones can choose how to have those effects . 1737135_1743035
and one of the ways that cells can choose is by putting what receptors it has on its surface . 1743375_1748995
if a cell produces a receptor to a particular hormone that means that it wants to be turned on or off by that hormone's activities . 1749575_1757395
the cell types &=writing:board that's one word influence by +... 1758155_1775575
having receptors +... 1778135_1779195
or not <having receptors> having receptors at high concentration on the cell surface or in low concentration where have we seen this before ? 1781995_1789215
having nothing to do with hormones ? 1789695_1791035
what kinds of cells can say kind_of tailor oh I wanna have this much of that receptor on my surface or I wanna bring it in and hold it within the vesicle so that it can't be targeted +..? 1792495_1801115
you're whispering the answer what ?
what do you think ? 1807115_1808975
no you don't know ? 1809535_1811435

⌊ yes ⌋ LDL receptors . 1812755_1813955
okay <they can> &~con they can determine how many receptors what's the concentration . 1814435_1820275
so in these cells how many receptors are you going to transcribe translate and make on the cell surface . 1820795_1827095
they can also change the kinds of second messengers that are turned on by these receptors &=writing:board and we're gonna talk about that in a minute . 1828635_1841355
and they can ultimately determine the kind of effects that these hormones will have by choosing which enzymes are going to be turned on ultimately by the second messengers . 1841995_1851695
by selectively having enzymes like glucose six phosphatase or choosing not to have that enzyme like the skeletal muscle . 1852105_1860125
what enzymes it has those are the ones that will be affected by the hormonal cascade . 1860525_1865305

that was a little sideline . 2167635_2168775
but it was still fun wasn't it ? 2169075_2170315
so let's go on to what is actually going on . 2170375_2173795
are you feeling the effects of what you've eaten ? 2174015_2175595
what are you feeling ? 2176015_2177675

shall I send them circulating ?
should I send them circulating ?
can you pick out_of the bag ?
I can't circulate the cream cheese .
what are you thinking ?
are you feeling sleepy ?
yes you're feeling sleepy do you know why ? 2182995_2195435
do you know why ? 2195875_2197615
(be)cause you are in debt . 2197605_2199585
because you're thinking to yourself wait a minute I just ate . 2200185_2202845
and I've got all these carbohydrates and they should be circling and they are circling . 2203485_2207165
except the energy that you expended in chewing has put you in debt . 2207585_2213385
okay ? 2214305_2214685
&=laughs:multiple it has put you in debt .
&=writes:board you have eaten +... 2215045_2218485
and also if you haven't eaten for a while before actually maybe you bite into these things you're thinking to yourself okay <so why> you've eaten basically simple sugars . 2222435_2232555
that's basically what the carbohydrate that's that's the bagels here the cream cheese I mean sometimes you have to make those simple sugars taste a little bit better . 2232675_2240055
&=laughs:multiple but you have eaten simple sugars . 2240415_2243495
but you chewed them . 2245035_2246815
and bagels are notoriously chewy . 2246995_2249075
and the chewing process has not only probably made your jaws ache depending on how many you've eaten but has actually put you in a little bit of skeletal muscle &~de debt . 2251175_2261895
&=writing:board and why if your jaws are aching why are they aching ? 2263015_2270555
because you were chewing so quickly that lactic acid was building up there and now it's being transported to the liver for regeneration to the glucose . 2271465_2280265
okay ? 2280685_2280925
but the good thing for you is glucose is on the way . 2281125_2283485
because your stomach has started digestive processes . 2283925_2288265
&=writing:board and as a direct result of eating this ultimately within a half an hour probably you will have a much elevated glucose concentration . 2293215_2304155
and that elevation will be seen . 2304775_2306595
and it will be seen immediately . 2307175_2308955
and as the high blood glucose increases insulin is produced by the pancreas +... 2310115_2317075
it says okay I've got a_lot_o(f) glucose +... 2320545_2324605
insulin is sent out . 2328365_2329265
&=writing:board and insulin targets every single cell that contains an insulin receptor . 2329685_2341545
and insulin receptors are pretty much the easiest kind of receptive systems . 2342265_2346225
and we'll &~s start with those +... 2346225_2347225
so where're we ? 2352425_2353345
we're at that first level of regulation . 2353545_2357225
only the cells that have a receptor will feel the effects of what you've eaten . 2358105_2362045
&=writing:board what does the insulin receptor look like ? 2363345_2372645
<there's this> nice little drawing +... 2373625_2374845
on page seven hundred and seventy in Leninger and I'll draw it in a cartoonlike way for you . 2378115_2385935
four subunits two each of two different kinds of subunits cell surface +... 2387175_2393235
&=writing:board it's kind_of like &=writing:board legs sticking into the cell . 2397395_2407355
so you have two of these shorter subunits I'll point them out here . 2406715_2414075
these extracellular domains the alpha domains . 2414755_2417955
these are the ones that actually bind the insulin itself . 2418535_2421815
&=writing:board they are linked to the beta domain which actually cross the cell surface they actually cross into the intercellular space . 2430095_2437615
&=writing:board these are the ones that have the catalytic function of these receptors . 2446615_2449915
this catalytic function is the phosphorylating of anything in its immediate vicinity that can be phosphorylated . 2452935_2459375
so this receptor is itself an enzyme with kinase activity +... 2459935_2467435
&=writing:board they are kinases .
and specifically they are tyrosine +... 2470815_2475435
kinases .
we may put phosphates the group itself on tyrosine residues of proteins that can take phosphates . 2481605_2488025
so there it is it shows this particular cytosolic domain . 2488625_2493405
let's move it up a little bit . 2495165_2497045
and the key is the binding of insulin to these receptors causes a huge conformational change in the whole protein . 2498345_2509365
what in fact happens is that these these domains intercellular domains climb into each_other . 2509995_2515595
they have this huge shift and they actually I don't want oh I'll just write climb into each_other +... 2516535_2523715
and almost as if it were spontaneous ATP in the cytosol was used to phosphorylate the receptor itself . 2525955_2535955
so ATP at the expense of ATP +... 2536915_2539975
you put phosphate groups on tyrosine residues that are actually in this protein this part of the protein chain . 2544255_2550795
&=writing:board this is so+called autophosphorylation . 2556575_2562815
so they're climbing into each_other ATP is in the cytosol and phosphate is getting put on the individual domain . 2559985_2567705
and once they're on one domain that domain can phosphorylate another domain . 2568225_2573125
and they go back and forth and phosphorylate each_other whichever happens to be in the immediate area of ATP at that time . 2573785_2580225
so they can do this continuous kind of phosphorylation then . 2580505_2583385
they can put phosphorylation on themselves different tyrosine residues of the other domain so they're literally littered with phosphates now decorating their intercellular domain . 2584915_2597855
only on tyrosine residues . 2598375_2599835
and what happens is of_course these are membrane bond proteins these receptors and they can slide along the membrane . 2600095_2606455
and they do . 2607235_2607635
and they slide along and guess what they run into every now and then . 2607895_2611555
other receptors .
other insulin receptors . 2613205_2615085
so what'll happen is this guy'll slide next to another guy &=writing:board and what do you think will happen to its intercellular domains ? 2615545_2628705
&=writing:board .
and those phosphorylations allow them to run into other cytosolic proteins . 2639385_2645985
cytosolic proteins like creatine kinase for instance . 2646505_2650585
they can become phosphorylated and become active or become active in reverse right ? 2651165_2657085
(be)cause you hafta be careful about enzymes which way you're activating them . 2657165_2659865
for instance you could run into glycogen synthase versus glycogen phosphorylase . 2660185_2665405
it can run into the enzymes that directly phosphorylate synthase and phosphorylase . 2666085_2673045
so you can imagine these guys the insulin receptors' tyrosine kinase activity &=writing:board ultimately can be felt to other cytosolic proteins that're floating around and happen to run into because they have a specific domain that will run into these intercellular tyrosine xxx domains . 2672825_2699865
&=writing:board and what kinds of proteins do you think that go phosphorylate or regulate ? 2712615_2717835
what is insulin a sign of ? 2718095_2719775

it can't be directly phosphorylated and turned on . 2752225_2754465
so it hasta be affected at one level before that right ? 2754945_2758545
why would that ? 2758705_2759405
(be)cause glycogen synthase is in what form when it's phosphorylated ?
do you remember glycogen synthase ?
it's inactive when it becomes phosphorylated . 2759545_2768625
so presumably the insulin cascade is a protein and activates a protein that does what to glycogen synthase ? 2769255_2776255
takes the phosphate off okay ?
&=writing:board what else does it tell the liver just for instance ? 2776495_2787695
okay does it need to do gluconeogenesis +..? 2788595_2790695
you've already got a_lot_of glucose in the blood . 2792735_2795555
what do you think ? 2795895_2796335
<do you> do you want your liver cells to be saying oh I wanna make even more glucose ? 2796895_2800355
no turns on glycolysis . 2800815_2803495
&=writing:board glycolysis is turned on PFK one is stimulated . 2805135_2815495
PFK one is stimulated by what +..? 2815815_2818195

f@l two six &~visc &-uh bisphosphate that's the signal molecule . 2824935_2828295
that's the signal molecule that's gonna be affected . 2828755_2830395
it's not directly affected by insulin itself but its production is really affected by the cascade that happens inside . 2830615_2837635
this is called a cascade because it's one event that directly leads to another event and directly leads <on and> on and on until ultimately way down here something gets phosphorylated and the effect is seen . 2838115_2851635
so it's an indirect multistep cascade . 2852065_2855265
in the skeletal muscle what do you think it would do there ? 2856165_2858645
you've got a_lot_of glucose that you can obviously import into the skeletal muscle . 2858785_2862825
so what do you think ? 2863465_2864585
should you be breaking down your glycogen reserves ? 2864725_2866585
why bother you've got plenty of glucose being transported in directly from the bloodstream . 2867805_2873285
what should we be doing right here in the skeletal muscle ? 2873865_2875765
glycolysis and the muscles are saying <break down> break down +... 2877785_2880365
what else are you saying in the skeletal muscle ? 2881125_2888045
storage storage and you may have plenty of glucose coming in store this make creatine phosphate have a storage of this high energy molecule . 2889225_2901985
because you have plenty of energy to make the ATP and you can directly transfer that &~en energy into this high energy intermediate . 2902195_2912035
so creatine kinase +...
is affected +...
store creatine phosphate +...
store it it's a high energy intermediate . 2929595_2930815
you've got plenty of glucose coming in . 2931295_2933015
that means you're doing plenty of glycolysis which means your making plenty of this ATP it's there in high quantities . 2933155_2938655
drive it into the production of something that can be stored in high quantities in the skeletal muscle . 2939315_2943695
okay insulin no signal is a signal unless it can be turned off okay ? 2944335_2950015
so how do you think insulin receptor can turn off its activity ? 2950575_2953075
for every receptor system that we look at we have to consider how is it turned off . 2959585_2960665
&=writing:board how is the receptor itself turned off we've already talked about all of these things . 2961585_2973725
only the cells that have an insulin receptor will bind to the insulin . 2974385_2977645
those are the only cells that will feel this cascade . 2978425_2980505
the second messengers are what proteins are on the receiving end of this tyrosine kinase activity . 2981385_2987745
what enzymes that's the same thing for this one because you don't have a very big cascade wait til we get to the next cascade then you'll see the cascade . 2988505_2995245
so how do we regulate it ? 2995945_2997525
no signal works unless <there's a> there's a method to turn it off . 2997765_3001365
of_course you could always just shut down insulin &~proju production right ? 3002285_3005685
so that's one level that you can shut this down . 3006245_3009165
but still there will be insulin circulating in the blood for quite some time after you've stopped producing it . 3009465_3014385
the concentrations will go down very slowly there's a turnover rate for these signal molecules . 3014885_3019565
so you hafta have a more direct shut off mechanism . 3020245_3023445
any receptor will only be turned on in a pulse . 3024805_3028145
that means ultimately this receptor hasta be shut down directly by something that happens in the cell and that happens because way down here <protein after> protein after protein ultimately you phosphorylate a protein that comes back around and phosphorylates this enzyme this receptor this tyrosine kinase activity on a seriate or a threonine residue and it shuts it off . 3028955_3054655
okay ? 3054915_3056035
ultimately way down the line phosphorylation of a protein +... 3056565_3060805
that specifically &=writing:board phosphorylates the receptor and not at the tyrosine of_course because that would just serve to add more tyrosine kinase activity . 3063485_3083965
but add a &{l=SIC serinine@u &}l=SIC or a threonine and it's shutdown +... 3084705_3090325
that's one way it is known . 3094645_3096365
when it is phosphorylated at a residue other than the tyrosine kinase activity this receptor goes through another conformational change the insulin is booted back out and it is shut off . 3096965_3106365
so it's an automatic thing it does it itself autoregulation self-regulation of this enzyme that is part of the receptor . 3107215_3115475
another way there has been some talk over the years years and years this has been talk about the insulin receptor actually becoming internalized . 3116075_3125115
like the LEL receptor . 3125715_3126915
because a_lot_of insulin receptor is found in internal vesicles . 3127835_3133815
so that's a great method that's how we shut down LEL receptor activity . 3134765_3138345
what do you do ? 3138965_3139485
bring it into the cell . 3139785_3140845
it can no longer bind insulin so it's shut off . 3141265_3145305
&=writing:board (o)kay ? 3150945_3152465
those are the methods that it can be turned off +... 3153085_3155665
in the most straightforward way . 3157125_3159005

+, that to actually turn it off by taking phosphates off . 3184245_3186425
presumably there's so much ATP accessible to it and it has its own activity that it could always replace it . 3186435_3192775
you have to do something else that is independent of the fact that the tyrosine keeps its phosphate . 3193555_3197735
yes ? 3198275_3198475
&-um do all the phosphates that are attached to to the &-uh tyrosines end up going to other proteins ? 3198815_3204395

all of (th)em ?
+, well I mean there's no way to really trace one for one but the fact is that the tyrosine kinase activity is heavily phosphorylated so the the protein itself is heavily phosphorylated and it is known to deliver phosphates to other proteins whether all of them on a one for one basis can be seen to do that . 3205515_3222775
there's just no way of labeling that to find out . 3223075_3225035
that's a good question very good . 3226115_3227895
okay regulation at the point of what receptor you have regulation at the point of what enzymes are turned on let's look at another a little bit more complicated receptor system . 3228395_3239295
epinephrine .
okay ? 3240495_3241735
hopefully by now course you are writing so that's a good sign . 3242995_3246975
epinephrine and for that matter glucagon belong to what is called (0.5) the adrenergic system of receptors . 3248365_3260845
specifically glucagon is considered to to take part in what is called the beta adrenergic receptor system . 3261825_3268985
somatostatin connects with receptors that are part of the alpha two adrenergic system so it's a whole family +... 3271095_3277095

adrenaline . 3290915_3291455
it's the receptor that was found to be directly involved in binding adrenaline which has since changed its name to epinephrine so &=writing:board epinephrine binds to these receptors glucagon binds to these receptors course adrenaline will bind to these receptors in what kinds of cells ? 3292245_3317685
mostly skeletal muscle . 3317825_3319325
glucagon will bind to these kinds of receptors that are carried in what kinds of cells ? 3320095_3323775
mostly hepatocytes so liver cells . 3323995_3326395

the beta adrenergic receptors is what we talk about for mostly epinephrine and glucagon . 3352725_3357385

the beta adrenergic +... 3362285_3363685

there's a great little description of what goes on on page seven hundred and sixty three in your book if you wanna follow along . 3368325_3374565
it is a receptor that is produced and put on biological membranes . 3375245_3382625
it's kind_of different than the insulin receptor in its general structure . 3384425_3387905
and in the fact that it has no catalytic activity by itself . 3388485_3392645
it does not specifically catalyze reactions . 3393345_3397765
not like the insulin receptor which is in its intercellular domain an enzyme . 3398065_3402105
this does not . 3402825_3403525
this is a receptor that's mostly performing a structural role . 3403665_3406605
it has a binding site +... 3407185_3409345

this could be epinephrine or glucagon that basically go through the same series of events +... 3416205_3420805
just depends on which cell you're talking about first level of regulation . 3425155_3429595
which cells you're talking about that would determine which hormone and in which receptor you have and also which enzymes are inside and can be turned on and off . 3430055_3438135

are you getting hungry again ? 3446835_3447615
you can always come up for more bagels if you are getting hungry . 3447815_3450235
but if you are getting hungry that's a sure sign that glucagon has been sent out . 3450545_3454565
and glucagon's saying to the cells okay wait a minute . 3455025_3457525
you're in low blood sugar now . 3458205_3459465
when your glucose in your bloodstream gets to a below a certain point a certain number of milligrams per deciliter or whatever that can be monitored and are monitored by patients certainly insulin &~pa &-uh diabetes patients with insulin problems . 3459705_3472145
it gets below that point it drops below that threshold concentration what happens ? 3473345_3477205
glucagon's made glucagon's sent through the bloodstream and glucagon hits those cells in the liver especially and especially quickly they bind to their receptor part of the beta adrenergic family and a huge conformational change occurs in this receptor . 3478625_3493905

and these proteins this whole family comes from a whole family of RAS genes I'm sure you've probably heard that name before RAS the RAS family of genes is a big oncogene family . 3524725_3542205
a_lot_of cancers are a direct result of having &{l=SIC misproducts &}l=SIC . 3542665_3545645
they are mutants or somehow they've been altered in this family of of &-uh proteins and they can cause horrible effects and uncontrolled cell division and uncontrolled cell growth . 3547935_3559215
tumor promotion right there &=points_to_board from this family . 3559535_3562655
and it's the g@l protein family . 3563255_3565075
and they're involved in many cellular processes this is only one of (th)em . 3565275_3568695
they're involved in huge numbers the RAS the RAB the RAM the all of them that are directly related . 3568755_3576195
and their whole job is to bind GTP and hydrolyze it . 3576395_3581615
but what it's interacting with while it's doing its job is causing conformational changes in those proteins that it's interacting with and turning on and off their activity . 3582935_3593155
so its whole job is to bind GTP and move around and hit and run into other proteins . 3593385_3600105
there're three subunits on the +//. 3601005_3602805
on a typical GTP binding protein . 3603045_3604825
the alpha subunit is the catalytic subunit . 3605685_3608425
the beta and gamma are basically regulatory . 3609585_3612045
&=writing:board it has this confirmation that puts it in close proximity to actually cozying up to its beta and gamma subunits . 3630295_3637755
and the gamma subunit of this protein of this class of proteins actually adheres very nicely to the beta adrenergic receptor . 3638235_3646035
okay so these are in close proximity . 3646535_3648415
they are closely they're not covalently bound but they are in close attachment +... 3648715_3654155
noncovalently .
so when GDP is bound +... 3662355_3664435
this threesome is tightly adherent to this receptor . 3668315_3674515
when the receptor binds to its hormone what happens is there's a shuffle . 3675115_3681315
GTP boots out the GDP and the binding of this alpha subunit to GTP causes such a huge conformational change in that subunit that it sails away from the alpha +//. 3683825_3699025
from the beta and gamma subunits . 3699385_3700785
it actually goes sailing across the intramembrane leaf alright ? 3701005_3707045
(be)cause this is a bilayer . 3707145_3708145
so +... 3708505_3708805
this alpha subunit is actually kind of cozying up to that &~pho phospholic that heads along this bilayer . 3712295_3718115
and it gets sent out . 3718495_3719675
it binds GTP and it gets sent out and it's skating kind_of skating along the membrane at its intercellular surface . 3719895_3729535
and it skates along and remember this is a cell so this is three dimensional . 3729715_3733815
this is skating in all directions and it's in this GTP bound stage so it's skating until it runs into a protein that in this confirmation it actually attaches to not covalently but intermolecularly . 3734175_3747195
and the protein that it attaches to is also a membrane bound protein right here . 3748475_3752915
your book calls it adenylate cyclase other books call it adenylyl . 3754535_3758655
so don't be worried if you're seeing different spellings +... 3759845_3763345
adenylate cyclase or adenylyl cyclase . 3766845_3769605
and what does this guy do ? 3771205_3773065
so even though it looks like a kind of stoichiometric thing here where one epinephrine's bound to one receptor and one GTP protein is floating along to one &~aden adenylyl cyclase . 3773365_3783545
it's not remember this is happening in three dimensions . 3783865_3786065
so it's not like they're in an electron transport chamber and one feeds directly to the other . 3786445_3791125
this is skating all over and it's seeing as many of these adenylate cyclases as it can and when it hits it +... 3791545_3797845
this is the alpha subunit it turns on the adenylate cyclase . 3803085_3806465
and the adenylate cyclase has a cytosolic domain that does a very important catalytic event . 3806805_3814525
it makes a second messenger . 3815305_3816845
&=writing:board and turns it into cyclic AMP +... 3839285_3841485
pyrophosphate is the least so you're going from a triphosphate molecule to a monophosphate molecule . 3842225_3851625
and this monophosphate is actually linked +... 3852225_3854965
in a thirty prime to five prime prime way &=writing:board okay so it is a cyclic thirty prime there's your three carbon to five prime phosphorylated molecule . 3859135_3878395
we call it cyclic AMP . 3879095_3880435
and as long as that alpha subunit binds to the adenylate cyclase it's catalytically active . 3882375_3888515
and it's chugging out CMP left and right . 3888795_3891475
and cyclic AMP is what we call a second messenger +... 3891875_3894915
it was hard to define second messengers in the insulin cascade . 3895335_3902395
because so many different proteins were directly affected by the insulin receptor itself . 3903015_3907435
but in this case the receptor had no activity and this concentration of this internal &-uh if you will metabolite increases dramatically and it has cellular effects . 3907855_3919715
so that the second messenger its levels +... 3920135_3921915
increase as a direct result &=writing:board of adenylate cyclase which is only turned on by the alpha subunit of the GTP binding protein +... 3925365_3941725
and which is now ultimately leading back to the receptor binding event +... 3946685_3952045
direct effects indirect effects +... 3956745_3959605
directly it's turned on by this enzyme making it . 3964745_3966765
but that enzyme is turned on by GTP binding protein attaching to it . 3967225_3971845
and that's turned on by the hormone binding to the receptor . 3972265_3975725
(o)kay ? 3976385_3976785
so it keeps going . 3976845_3977565
and cyclic AMP is made in a_lot in huge concentration a_lot_of events . 3978085_3983305
so it's often thought that second messenger systems and these cascades that directly result no matter how many steps are in between from hormonal binding events are giving you what what the cell would call what you would call &~ampli amplification of your signal +... 3983625_3998805
you get an amplified signal with every second messenger that is turned on as a result of this hormonal binding event . 4002065_4012365
you don't just make one cyclic AMP for every one hormone binding . 4012645_4016365
you make seven billion cyclic AMP for every one hormone binding event . 4016685_4022145
so your signal is now seven million times stronger within the cell . 4022225_4026485
&=writing:board &{l=WRITING with every second messenger . 4036515_4040675
&}l=WRITING okay ? 4042075_4042675
so beyond that +//. 4043395_4044415
yep ?
&-um is the glucagon that binds to the protein is that what stimulates the GTP to attach to the . 4045235_4051915
yes +/. 4051975_4052315
okay +/.
+, it's what makes the first placement . 4052575_4054655
it binds with it it its beta and gamma subunit only when the GDP is in that pocket . 4055315_4060655
when GTP boots out the GDP so basically you're &~gi you're you're losing your GDP that was bound and you're putting in place of it a GTP a high energy molecule that's what sends it sliding along . 4061195_4073055
so what do you think sends it sliding back ? 4073795_4075495
what's it's whole job +..? 4076355_4078655
it hydrolyzes GTP .
that's its whole job . 4082995_4084415
so as long as it still has GTP bound it will be in search of adenylate cyclase in every direction . 4084865_4091985
and transiently bind to it and turn it on until it makes a_lot_of cyclic AMP and then it'll bounce off of that and go to another one maybe . 4092365_4099885
but at a certain point it's actually going to do its catalytic event and what's it going to do ? 4100585_4105765
it's going to hydrolyze that terminal phosphate on the GTP and what will then be in its place ? 4106305_4111705
GDP .
and what +//. 4113915_4114215
where will it go ? 4114595_4115135
and that's the main way that this has a shut off switch . 4115675_4118795
it has only GTP bound for as long as it can keep it in its active site before it actually does its job hydrolyzes the the third phosphate and has GDP and then it has a different conformation that makes it bounce back into the beta and gamma subunits . 4119495_4135155
so let's actually write that . 4135595_4138795
&{l=WRITING the regulation for these types of receptors at first level the GTPase activity +... 4139755_4147455
of the g@l protein +... 4150255_4150855
&}l=WRITING mkay ?
that's the first way that that's regulated . 4156135_4159675
there's another enzyme actually that's affected by other hormonal signals that we'll get to tomorrow that actually breaks down cyclic AMP . 4160775_4168455
this enzyme that takes &=writes:board cyclic AMP and turns it just into AMP is another way in which regulation happens . 4169485_4179545
so it's no longer at the point of the receptor anymore that you're regulating this cascade . 4180065_4184065
you're actually shutting down and reversing production of the signal molecule . 4184365_4189445
this enzyme that does this is called phosphodiesterase +... 4190005_4192905
and we get into this in a big way +... 4195345_4196605
tomorrow when we talk about another cascade that directly turns this enzyme on . 4199505_4202765
&=writing:board okay ? 4207005_4212105
how many of you have heard &~fro of cholera toxin ? 4213005_4218025
cholera toxin results in &~i it <is a> direct result of an infection that causes the alpha subunit to be what is called ADP ribosylated it actually gets in place of the GTP that's put on it you get a covalent attachment of an ADP ribose which effectively turns this alpha subunit on constantly . 4217975_4238235
so cholera toxin is a direct result or directly results in turning this on constantly making all of your cells that are affected by this hormonal cascade turned on constantly and you end up with a whole series of symptoms that are a direct result of this &=points_to_board guy being permanently affixed <in its> in its on position . 4238765_4259905
and I think that whooping cough pertussis toxin affects the inhibitory subunit which we're gonna talk about in a minute . 4261085_4267885
there's a there's another somatostatin it's a receptor that has instead of an active &~G what we call GS protein a stimulatory g@l protein this one it &~ha it actually activates an inhibitory protein a GI . 4268405_4282465
let's look up here second okay what happened to this one ? 4283265_4286025
cyclic AMP levels increase in the cell let's follow this to its completion and then we'll talk about somatostatin and the others . 4288315_4292675
what happens ? 4293075_4293655
inside the cell cyclic AMP is in huge concentration . 4294035_4298215
and it specifically binds to proteins . 4298955_4303695
and those specific proteins that bind it quickly there's one specific one . 4304395_4312215
that is called protein kinase do you know ? 4313405_4316545
(o)kay ?
it's a cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase that's been called protein kinase A +... 4317445_4325305
&{l=WRITING dependent protein kinase PKA .
&}l=WRITING so what happens ? 4329245_4340565
there are two regulatory subunits on this protein kinase and two catalytic subunits on the protein kinase +... 4341015_4346915
regulatory regulatory each regulatory subunit so how many if I did an SPS page how many protein bands would show if you have two identical regulatory subunits and two identical catalytic subunits on this protein ? 4349795_4365475
+, two +/.
+, only two . 4365895_4366275
and each would be a duplicate but you can't tell that on a gel . 4368025_4370645
cyclic AMP binds to that regulatory subunit in two places on each regulatory &~mole protein chain +... 4371025_4379505
and get this what happens is when all of the cyclic AMP spots are filled the regulatory subunits let the catalytic subunits go . 4380405_4391425
so this guy's completely inactive . 4392285_4394805
these catalytic subunits are completely inactive when they are tied up with the regulatory subunits . 4395525_4398005
but binding of the regulatory subunits to the cyclic AMP releases the catalytic subunits . 4404725_4406865
&=writing:board and so what do you think protein kinase A does ? 4411845_4426025
well it phosphorylates a_lot_of proteins that's why it's called protein kinase . 4426165_4430185
protein kinase A phosphorylates a ton of proteins one of which &=writing:board is phosphorylase B kinase . 4430435_4446495
do you remember phosphorylase B kinase ? 4446855_4449335
so what'll you think it +//. 4450075_4452535
what'll +//.
what do you think that effect will be ? 4453015_4454335
if it phosphorylates phosphorylase B kinase and activates it then phosphorylase B kinase will phosphorylate phosphorylase B and what will it do ? 4455025_4466025
activate phosphorylase B and glycogen breakdown will begin +... 4466505_4470765
&{l=WRITING phosphorylase B kinase &}l=WRITING and ultimately glycogen breakdown begins . 4482105_4485685
&=writing:board what else does it do ? 4487025_4492645
oddly enough in the liver glucagon stimulates fructose two six bisphosphophatase@u . 4492885_4500145
why ? 4501165_4501465
as that signal molecule . 4501845_4502945
when glucagon is high the physio@u molecule is diminished . 4503525_4507405
two six bisphosphate is the activator for glycolysis . 4507745_4511125
and in the liver you don't want glycolysis going on . 4511825_4515465
in the liver your role is in producing glucose . 4515705_4518225
you've got your glucose as a signal . 4518405_4520205
so the liver is saying okay I'm in trouble I wanna shut down glycolysis which means my PFK one hasta be inhibited . 4520605_4528125
so I'm going to lower effectively lower the concentration of fructose two six bisphosphate +... 4528405_4532705
that signal molecule that does that . 4537565_4539765
and that means there's less activation of PFK one . 4541385_4545145
don't get lost in the cycles here they're they're very complicated so just get the major input . 4545805_4551545
what's the problem ? 4551665_4552365
glucagon low sugar . 4552565_4554285
you're getting hungry you're for glucose production . 4554965_4557405
the liver hasta produce glucose and the muscle hasta make itself use the glucose that the liver is sending out . 4557545_4564305
so that's the cascade . 4565235_4566895
now each activation we get doesn't just result in one other activation event . 4567375_4573175
so every time you have this release you have these enzymes active for as long as they can do their job before cyclic AMP is released and lowered enough in concentration for these to swing back to the regulatory subunits . 4573655_4588115
so again you have amplification +... 4588435_4591035
it doesn't just do one phosphorylation event . 4595155_4598235
it does thousands because it's active for that amount of time . 4598435_4601935
same with this . 4602475_4603355
when it activates phosphorylase B kinase it doesn't just mean phosphorylase B kinase turns around and does one activation on glycogen &~pho phosphorylase . 4603795_4612755
it does lots_of it so you get amplification again . 4612995_4625135
&=writing:board now it seems to me this hormonal cascade runs circles around this one . 4622675_4630455
do you see why ? 4631455_4632135
I mean this guy has almost virtually no second messengers . 4632775_4635795
you know none that you can identify as being consistent in every cell it's got its own activity . 4636535_4640775
it's rather rather simple and beautiful <in its> in its method . 4641515_4644375
but this guy has an enormous number of proteins being turned on and being affected by other cascades . 4644545_4652045
it's a whopping cascade . 4652485_4653805
it is a huge cascade of events and with every event in this cascade there hasta be regulation . 4654405_4661545
with every event . 4662705_4663905
just like glycolysis you couldn't just have one bypass at the front . 4664485_4668025
you hafta be able to &~re regulate every step along the way . 4668465_4671465
and to some extent you can . 4671745_4673225
at least the irreversible ones . 4673805_4675065
so for this one regulation hasta happen at every event . 4675485_4678825
so at the same time as you have self-regulation by the GTPase activity you have another enzyme involved cutting back this signal . 4679565_4689865
you have other enzymes involved in regulating this whole set of protein phosphorylations . 4690325_4696785
so you have the counteractivity of numerous enzymes . 4697305_4706025
&=writing:board along the way . 4708145_4712245
and this kind_of competition if you will between the activities of different enzymes whether it's going to go yes to the closed cascade or stop the cascade that's called crosstalk &=writing:board crosstalk is different cascades affecting other cascades . 4713025_4736425
so there is crosstalk between the insulin signal and the glucagon signal . 4736765_4740645
there is . 4741505_4742085
if the cell has an insulin receptor and a glucagon receptor insulin the whole cascade effectively turned on by insulin binding will shut down this guy's cascade . 4742505_4754605
and not just that one event all the way along . 4755185_4758005
there are proteins being phosphorylated here by this binding event that will directly reverse these steps . 4758285_4765405
&=writing:board another cascade that we're gonna get to tomorrow is the vasopressin cascade a whole different set of enzymes . 4771775_4777635
and it also crosstalks at all these different places . 4778235_4781495
and there are specific places where they will overlap and they will shut each_other off . 4781755_4785395
so one other way that it's regulated is you hafta think again you have to back off and get a whole cellular picture . 4785995_4792955
this doesn't do justice to the fact that this is going on in every direction . 4793695_4797895
okay you have to imagine the whole surface has these kinds of little ships that're all these g@l proteins these alpha subunits these stimulatory +... 4798335_4807595
what're called GS proteins because they stimulate adenylate cyclase +... 4810715_4816855
they're floating and they're hitting as many adenylate cyclases as they can in the same cells there are somatostatin receptors . 4818715_4827235
and somatostatin is involved in a_lot_of the crosstalk between these two cascades . 4828235_4834015
it's moderating the insulin versus epinephrine and glucagon signal . 4834175_4837575
somatostatin has the same kind of receptors . 4838155_4841575
they belong to the same adrenergic family . 4842335_4844675
but they have a different overall structure and they're called alpha instead of beta adrenergic receptors . 4845225_4851365
and instead of using g@l proteins when somatostatin binds to its receptor it sends off g@l inhibitory proteins +... 4851925_4860585
&-um &{l=WRITING somatostatin &}l=WRITING has an alpha receptor and it binds to an inhibitory g@l protein . 4863545_4875065
so somatostatin effectively sends off these inhibitory proteins and where do they bind ? 4875605_4881165
to the adenylate cyclase . 4882105_4883345
so if somatostatin is released because these two signals are going on at once what's going to happen ? 4883665_4890705
it's going to shut down this pathway here . 4891435_4893775
&=points_to_board because those inhibitory g@l protein alpha subunits are gonna be sailing forth and what're they gonna hit ? 4894615_4900015
&=points_to_board these . 4902195_4902655
the same things that the stimulatory ones are hitting on all sides of the cell . 4903015_4906795
they're gonna float around and they're gonna shut it down . 4906895_4909135
so that's one way that crosstalk happens . 4909695_4912955
you have an inhibitory subunit instead of a stimulatory one . 4913295_4916555
so it's in effect blocking this guy's activity . 4916795_4919295
because presumably both signals <are being> are being considered at once by the cell . 4919555_4925195
is this pretty frightening so far ? 4925735_4927015
+, yes +/. 4927295_4927495
+, it is . 4927795_4928155
I knew it would be . 4928295_4929095
you see I'm so used to +//.
that's why I fed you these before . 4929575_4931535
there's always a reason . 4932955_4933775
