it's about two old gentlemen who decided to meet up with each other
Bob and Jimmy were their names .
I believe Bob was there at this old restaurant where a restaurant
it was one cold and windy night .
a policeman was on his beat .
as he swung his stick and came around, he saw the man .
he approached him .
and asked him who or what he was waiting for .
and he said he was waiting there to meet a friend .
they were friends .
they grew up together .
and they went their separate ways .
and they decided for twenty years that they would meet back at this
so as he waited the policeman sort_of stuck up a conversation with
Bob told the policeman that his friend was going to meet him there
once the policeman realized or felt that he was there waiting for
he went on .
and began to continue to check the businesses .
try the doors and all .
and pretty soon the gentleman +...
well, once the policeman left, I think the man lit a cigarette .
there was a match .
he lit a cigarette or a cigar .
and Jimmy came around the corner .
who Bob thought was Jimmy came around .
and he asked if that was him .
and he said +"/.
+" well you know I didn't realize that you'd grown two
they grew up together .
he said in time a_lot_of things happen .
they both inquired how they had fared within the last twenty years
(a)bout their jobs and all .
and as the conversation went on it came to a point where he
oh, Bob I believe had a scar .
when he lit the cigarette he could see that he had a scar on his
and as the conversation went on he realized that this was not Jimmy
he said because he changed from a Roman nose .
nobody could change from Roman nose, I believe, to a pug nose .
or from a pug nose to a Roman nose .
one or the other .
and later this is when Jimmy confessed that he was not who he
but he recognized him as being wanted by the police .
his friend had turned him in .
unbeknownst to him .
he sent a plainclothes man to pretend that he was him .
and because he realized that he had seen the Chicago newspaper .
or on the news that Bob was wanted .
and he was unable to do it because he was his friend .
he didn't want to turn him in .
he was unable to do it .
so he sent a plainclothes man to come and arrest him .
the plainclothes man asked if he was going to come peaceably .
or put up a fight .
and that's about as much as I can remember about it .
my mother was a musician .
and we sang, my mother, my sister and myself .
she taught music .
and we were always singing someplace, my mother and my sister and
and one night we were at this church about to go on program .
and it's real funny .
believe it or not, we all sat up .
and we sort_of nodded .
and we missed our turn .
it was unbelievable .
it was a week that we had just been going continuously singing and
and I guess we were just tired because it was like a day like we've
and it was during the night .
during the week .
and when they called for us we were all sort_of nodding .
and that's one of my bad faults or habits even now .
so an usher had to come .
and shake my mother .
and wake her up .
and then she like my sister and I we were both sitting on each side
so when the usher shook my mother and told her they'd call for
and she sort_of hunched us .
and we all jumped up .
and it was pretty funny .
it was very embarrassing .
it was pretty funny .
but we did do our trio .
and we got a good applause .
and I guess that's about the funniest thing I can remember about my
but we had a_lot_of good times together .
I guess that's one of the most outstanding things I can remember
