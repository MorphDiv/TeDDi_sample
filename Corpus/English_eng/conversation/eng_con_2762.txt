this is the Justice Harry <A> Blackmun oral history .
this is taping session number one , on July <sixth> ,
I'm Harold Koh .
I'm a professor at Yale Law School , and I clerked for Justice
I'll be the interviewer for these taping sessions .
we're in Justice Blackmun's chambers , in his personal office .
<mister> Justice , how long have you worked in this office
oh , I think I've been in this office approximately twenty years .
I haven't checked the exact date .
this used to be the clerk's office , the clerk of court , and it's
and I can remember when the clerk himself sat before this window
and do you sit before this window a lot ?
yes .
what do you usually do there ?
have lunch , when I'm alone and don't want to be with anybody else
I can look outside , and see who's picketing us and what's going on
have they been picketing you ?
oh , once in a while , yes .
I'm often the target of good picketing .
well , Mister Justice , this is a big-day because your
so we thought that in this first taping session we would go through
just remember where you got them and what they mean to you and what
so why don't we start with this one over here ?
with the baseball bat ?
right .
well , a lot of these things have something to do with a day or an
but I wrote the so-called “Baseball Case” a while back called Flood
the Court twice had held , particularly in an opinion by <Mister>
and the issue was whether that would be overruled and we well ,
but I embarked on a sentimental journey in the first part of that
I tried to set forth a history of baseball in the early days and to
but , unfortunately , I left out the name of Mel Ott , the great
one of my clerks , who is a baseball fanatic , at the time called
of course I blamed my secretary and said that it was in the
anyway , that's a Mel Ott bat .
it's made by the Louisville Slugger Company , to his specifications
did you actually say that , “I'll never forgive myself” ?
oh , probably .
probably .
<mister> Justice , we have a seal here from the Nashville ,
can you tell us about it ?
oh , that's just a shoulder patch .
the last time I was in Nashville , Illinois , the place where I was
just one of those things one picks up when he gives a speech here
I was interested in having it .
were you popular with them ?
was I what ?
popular with the Nashville Police Department ?
the police were fine .
I wasn't particularly popular with some of the citizens because of
and how about in the cabinet ?
well , in there are just a couple of sentimental things .
there's a cane that was given by his children to my
it just came into my possession , and I thought I'd preserve it
the sword is my father's dress sword .
he was in the National Guard , Minnesota National Guard , for a
I just put them together .
this is my father here .
just a way to display it is all .
is that in his National Guard uniform ?
yes .
when they were federalized in <nineteen forty-one> ,
that was as he went off to Riverside , California with his regiment
you have another sword up there .
oh , that's a machete .
that comes from the Bahamas .
we spent a couple of Christmas holidays down there , and there were
everybody has a machete .
they use it to cut sugar corn , clean their fingernails , and
they gave that to me as we were leaving .
I had a terrible time getting it on the airplane , of course .
now we have some prints here .
one says , “<Saint> Paul from Dayton's Bluff” and then
<Mrs> Blackmun arranged this more or less chronologically
I wasn't born there , but I certainly grew up in <Saint>
and others here have to do with the little German village where my
how old were you when you moved to <Saint> Paul ?
about three days .
my father was on the road , and they were living , I'm sure , in a
mother decided she didn't want to have me alone , so she went to
and now we have two other pictures here .
well , this is my paternal grandfather .
he was a veteran of the War between the Mates .
that was taken on , they called it Decoration Day in those days ,
he and some other old soldiers were reviewing the parade as they
that's a newspaper picture , photograph , from the <Saint>
I think it's a very handsome head .
what did he do after he was in the service ?
well , he fanned a good bit in West Central Minnesota .
and then in the diphtheria epidemic , I think it was <eighty-one>
he sold the farm , went into the cities and did carpentry work
he was a great guy .
I well remember him .
right below ?
oh , this ties into some musical aspects .
my mother's next oldest sibling was a pianist of some promise , and
brazilian , named Carreno .
he and she were about to embark on an Australian tour from Berlin
my mother never quite got over it .
but I remember one rather celebrated German +/.
pianist came to the door in my office , and saw this from a
she knew right away who it was .
but so it goes .
there was a lot of music in your house when you were growing up ?
yes , to a degree .
mother was musical .
she wasn't as talented as her older brother was after whom I
yes , that affected her all her life .
now we have the scales of justice .
<Mrs> Blackmun bought that at a Mayo Clinic auction one
it's an old pharmacist's scale that they used before drugs ,
she thought it was representative of justice and the scales of
up above are the two medallions of the Mayo brothers , <Doctor>
I happen to have those and like it because I was with the Mayo
it turned out , I think , to be the happiest decade of my
if I had it to do over again , I'd probably go to medical school .
I'm glad you didn't .
how about the squash racquet ?
well , that's an old squash racquet that I won a minor
I've always been kind of partial to it , and there it is .
when you were at law school or college ?
well , if it was in the thirties , it was in law school , and I've
I think it was <nineteen thirty> , probably .
up in Boston .
it didn't amount to anything , just a minor tournament .
but I liked squash ; it was good to me .
well , we can't leave this area without looking at some of the
well , those are miscellaneous volumes that I use .
of course , what stands out is a baseball encyclopedia .
these are photographic and biographical material volumes of all the
that's Dorland's Medical Dictionary which is-it's an old
down there in that kind of a messy pile are the sentencing
and then a certain number of standard texts to which I have
I won't make you bend down , but I see there's some hats down there
what are those ?
in getting ready to move out , we uncovered the issue that they
it's kind of a little French skullcap that supposedly we wear on
I've never really worn it .
Byron White and I refuse to wear them , but supposedly it keeps our
it looks great .
it reminds me of the time you wore the Mao cap to the conference .
oh , yes .
that was on a dare from one of the clerks .
they're always daring me to do something foolish .
so it is .
now here's a big picture of , what looks like the White House .
well , it is at the White House .
I was in the Harvard Glee Club for six years , not my freshman year
and that was taken of the full club in Boston Symphony Hall back in
this is a certificate .
but this was the spring trip in <nineteen twenty-nine> .
we had been up in Syracuse the night before in a snowstorm and sang
you could see all the heavy suits and the hats .
then came down and sang at the White House .
that was my first time in Washington , actually .
but there was no air-conditioning in the White House ; you can tell
it was a hundred degrees in early April , cherry blossom time , and
he came out and had this photograph taken with us .
in those days , the president was inaugurated on the fourth day of
just one of those photographs .
was that the last time you were at the White House before you met
I'm not sure I can answer that question .
probably so , probably so .
did any of your Glee Club classmates go on to fame and fortune ?
yes , some of them have done pretty well , I suppose .
of course , nearly all of them are gone now .
one of them over here was my roommate during my law school days ,
what voice did you sing ?
baritone , and I got in with the lowest possible quartet grade .
doc Davidson , the director , I'm sure regretted all his life
we come along here to my Mayo days , largely +...
well , actually some of my days in the Dorsey offices .
this happened to be a time when one of the partners left the firm
greyhound was an early client .
he took along a couple of the cubs and non-partners with him and
among others here is William <L> Prosser , of torts fame .
we used to have dinners , have a lot of fun with him .
is that everybody in the firm at the time ?
oh no , those were just the cubs , the cubs , the associates .
no partner was there .
when you arrived , how many lawyers were at the firm ?
it seemed to me about fifteen .
when I left , there were thirty-two , and we thought it was much
this is Harry Harwick , who was the man that lured me to go to
he was the lay administrator of the Mayo organizations , one of the
chuck Mayo .
that's <Doctor> Balfour , one of Mayo's leading surgeons .
<doctor> Samuel <F> Haines , who occupied a similar
that happens to be William Mitchell , former attorney general , who
right ; there's a law school now named after him .
yes , indeed , there is .
and what was Chuck Mayo's relationship to the original Mayo
I should correct that last statement .
William Mitchell was named after his father , who was on the
chuck , Charles <W> Mayo , was the son of Charles <H>
one thing that he did , he'd stop by at the end of the day once in
that put me in difficulty .
+" daddy , why can't you do that ?
you know , that sort of thing .
he loved to show me up .
how many lawyers at the firm did work for the Mayo Clinic ?
it started off I well remember the day that somebody came up
we had not represented them before .
looking back it was , I think , a test case , because of the tax
our tax partner was ill at the time so he landed at my desk .
we took it from there , and eventually they became a very valued
now we have some nature shots here .
well , that's a , I think it's a lovely photograph of a lake up in
that's rather typical of that lake .
it's a beautiful place .
have you been going there since you were at the Dorsey firm ?
oh , no , maybe the last eight or nine years or so .
we are always able to get a cabin up there and enjoy it .
and this picture ?
well , this is Aspen , Colorado , where I've been fortunate enough
the three of us there , that's professor Norval Morris , of the
he and I conduct the seminar and the third person is the late
we're just walking up from what's called Aspen Meadows to the
it's one of the most beautiful short walks I've ever known .
this is Aspen Mountain in the background .
of course , this is the summertime but one can <see>
some people have said that that run is among the most challenging
I'm not a skier , so I can't attest to that .
we're hiding something back here .
oh , that was my tax partner in the Dorsey office , who taught me a
this little arrangement of stones is in the form of the Big Dipper
a lot of things at Aspen like that , you know .
and here , is this the Dorsey firm ?
those are the partners in the Dorsey firm , taken shortly after I
a lot of them are gone now .
it wasn't a very large firm at the time .
<mister> Justice , this is sort of the Eighth Circuit area
can you tell us about the Sanborns and yourself ?
well , as you point out , this is essentially the Eighth Circuit .
this is the original Eighth Circuit panel taken in the old
that was the court in <eighteen ninety-one> when the Court
judge Caldwell , of Arkansas , in the middle , and the first
these others are largely photographs of the Eighth Circuit at
these are some of the judges on the court that were friends of mine
this one , of Judge Gunnar <H> Nordbye , is a district judge
those are two non judges .
that's it , largely .
and Judge Sanborn , when you clerked for him , how long had he been
he was appointed as a federal district judge in <nineteen
I was his first clerk .
this is a great picture .
that photograph was taken when I was sworn in as a federal judge on
that's in a building now called the Landmark Center in <Saint>
judge Sanborn's chambers .
I succeeded him , and he swore me in .
that's our family there , <Mrs> Blackmun and our three
that's a long time ago .
and then you sat with him that same day ?
well , we went to <Saint> Louis about a week later and sat
I was on the panel , sitting with him my first day on the court .
it happened to be my birthday , I think , November <twelve>
yes , he was a good friend and a great mentor , and I learned a lot
these other things here are just little tokens of some awards and
this happens to be the place where the bullet that came through our
Dottie thought it would be well to keep it , so there it is .
that was about five or six years ago .
these , of course , are photographs of the Supreme Court , largely
these are just Viking footballs that the past clerks have given me
we get over here into well , Abraham Lincoln is one of my
this was in Judge Sanborn's chambers , and I always admired it ,
<that> one is , the
I think it's an excellent portrayal of the president at that time .
this is the courthouse .
there's a photograph of the court out in front of this building ,
we're all lined up in protocol order .
a number of those are gone since then .
you asked about this thing in the blue .
well , I have more things in front of it .
that's a bill of sale , <eighteen fifty-seven> in South
but I point it out to children , when they visit the chambers ,
this is a favorite quote from Lincoln that I like , when the
it has taken on some there we are .
this stand-up desk I brought with me from the Eighth Circuit ; I
it tends to keep me more brief in my writing than if I were sitting
but you do most of your opinion work in the justices' library ?
yes , nearly all of it up there .
down here it's largely correcting things and the like .
well , trinkets generally +/.
would you say that Lincoln was your hero ?
+, well , he comes close to it , certainly .
he's my favorite president .
I think he had a terrible time in which to try to be president .
yes , I would say he comes close to being a hero .
over there are a couple of , for me , interesting photographs .
one is taken by <L_B_J's> official photographer , Okamoto
I like it .
he followed me around the building .
I used to walk around the block in those days .
I think it's a good photo .
the other one , the clerks and the secretaries in that day formed
they got up at half-past-seven in the morning .
the one clerk , the one on whose back my secretary is perched in
and that's a long time ago .
did you take a walk around the Court most everyday ?
I did at that time .
I don't do it so much anymore .
everyday when the weather was acceptable .
not only the one block but sometimes more than that .
today is July <six> , <nineteen ninety-four> .
this is the Harry <A> Blackmun oral history .
my name is Harold Hongju Koh .
I'm a professor at Yale Law School and a former law clerk to
justice Blackmun and I are sitting in the courtroom of the Supreme
<mister> Justice , do you remember the first time you ever
yes , I do , of course .
it was just as a cub on a case that our firm , our Minneapolis
I had written the brief and was allowed to come down and sit at the
I did not argue the case .
but I remember how impressed I was with this very impressive
it certainly is different from what I had anticipated .
but the more I've sat here , the more I appreciate the
if someone had told you then that you would be sitting on the Court
I would have laughed about it .
that would be impossible .
who was on the Court in that case ?
it seems to me , I should have looked this up , but I think Chief
now if we roll the clock forward to <nineteen seventy> ,
yes , I remember it very vividly .
I think anyone who joins the Court always remembers that particular
there are a couple of oaths to take , of course , the judicial and
and then the nominee always has to sit in the John Marshall chair ,
then he's called from there to take the oath here and to be robed
the habit in American courts as in the British courts is for the
the next senior is on the other side and so it goes , back and
I guess I've sat on every chair here except the one on the extreme
so those two were filled simultaneously by Justice Powell and
and do you remember your feelings when you +/.
when I first came here ?
+, when you were sitting in the John Marshall Chair and being robed
yes , of course .
I don't know how it affects other people but I think there is a
after all , this is the end of the line .
I well remember beforehand going into the robing room and the then
but that comes to everybody unless he is a person of great arrogant
was there a period when you began to feel comfortable sitting in
well , yes ; it took a while .
but this has been true with me all through my lifetime with any job
but it always takes me from three to five years to feel comfortable
this was true when I started practice , it was true when I went to
each job is new , and one has to learn it .
and feelings of comfort , if that's the right word , for me , come
I'm sure it's shorter for other people and maybe still others don't
I know there are many electric moments in this courtroom .
can you remember any that particularly stick in your mind ?
well , yes .
of course , we haven't had any severe disagreements and arguments
we can disagree without being disagreeable .
but that has not always been true .
there have been times when one justice wouldn't speak to another or
but every now and then , perhaps every term , there's a case or a
I look back , of course , on the arguments , in Roe against Wade .
the case was argued twice , the two cases , which meant four
the Pentagon Papers case .
and I'll never forget one time when Justice Black , who was sitting
and Black , in his canny way , stopped the <S_G> and said ,
+" <mister> Solicitor General , I don't believe you have
+" let me read it to you .
and so he read it .
+" it says that “Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of
+" he said .
doesn't that mean what it says ?
+" and I , sitting over in the junior chair , wondered what
+" and I'll remember to this day , he said .
oh , Mister Justice , you know as well as I know that the
I wondered what I had gotten into down here when words that seemed
but there was a lot of humor in it , and , of course , Justice
I thought it was an excellent response to a very difficult question
when you were listening to the argument in Roe versus Wade , did
did you ever have any inkling of what kind of impact it would have
during the oral arguments , that is , during the first one anyway ,
in my seminar out in Aspen , Colorado , I spent part of a morning
I've never done this publicly except there and once in France when
there were a number of reasons .
it's pure speculation on my part , but I caught it .
somebody has to write those cases ; we can't all duck them .
I wasn't too enthusiastic about it because we knew it was an
but one does a job ; he's assigned these cases , and you do the
can you think of a few advocates who you thought were really the
well , yes .
they're rare , the good ones ; they're rare .
those who've had long experience here are usually the best .
they know their way around , and it's a joy to listen to them .
I'm not going to name many because I'll insult others by not naming
Erwin Griswold of course was always a good one .
I have named him before , and as <S_G> he was here
but he was always prepared , never exceeded his time , hit the
archibald Cox was another good one .
I think I'll stop at that point .
<mister> Justice , last week was the close of this term ,
could you tell us about the last day and what happened ?
well , I think the last three weeks here were certainly the most
the end of a term is always difficult .
the cases that aren't down yet are usually the tough ones where we
they get stacked up .
we have those .
I have always found the end of the term to be a hard period , from
and then of course it was the realization that this was my last
a lot of things happened in those closing weeks .
I had to go up to Harvard for commencement for one thing , and some
then , of course , I brought down my dissent on the death penalty
the more that people talk about the death penalty , the better ,
but those were all mixed up in this final term , final days of this
when did you write your farewell letter ?
the Court has a tradition that a letter is written by the court to
they're all published in the United States Reports , various
and usually on the last day of the term that letter is read and
as I recall , the chief justice's letter was written on June
do you remember the main thing you wanted to tell your brethren and
do I remember what ?
what I wanted to tell them ?
what you wanted to tell them ?
to thank them for their compassion and sympathy and encouragement
I didn't try to bring in the bad things that happen here and there
but your main memories are of good things in this room .
yes , I think so .
of course these cases , the vast majority of them , despite a <nine
in the majority of those issues , the lower courts have divided .
and it isn't easy because this is the end of the line .
there isn't any other place to go from here except in criminal
but one has to be careful in whatever he writes in not establishing
because so often we're not deciding just the particular issue in
we're establishing a principle that will have a lot of effect on
and the last time you rose from the bench , how did you feel ?
not very different from any other time because my retirement isn't
but I knew it was the last time I'd sit on a bench as a , on this
and it was kind of a sad parting in a way .
I was speaking to Justice O'Connor this morning , and each of us
we feel as though we've just come on the court a year or so ago .
and I think that's a good way to feel because it means that one is
it was the end of the line , of course .
last question .
if you were speaking to a young cub lawyer sitting up here thinking
well , the law is a great profession .
it's not for everybody .
as you know as a professor of law , it's a profession of
its role , at least in the litigation area , is to resolve cases ,
in great contrast is the profession of medicine , where for the
but we need both .
I think one probably , a young person should not go into law if
it's a great profession .
I'm not sure if I had to do it over again I'd go into law .
I've often thought of medicine , which is a rather favorite pastime
but I'd be a poor physician , probably .
thank you very much , Mister Justice
