I mean is this . 416595_417035
it's reviewing yeah . 417035_418015
so you get the final product and say you say yes or no you're not somebody knocks on your door and say you know could you read through this and okay . 418115_427615
alright . 428015_428715

if you you look at the publication record it there &~s sort_of seems to be quite a clear trend . 442685_450525
it seems to me that if when you're working on on systematics right ? 451205_455805
&-uh of of fungi you tend to write on your own or sometimes with one other person . 456365_461085

<when I> when I look through it seems to me that the kind of the systematic stuff over your career seems to go in certain kind of bursts . 610725_619765
and now this may be just be because there're there're there're delays and time lags in publications but there's sort_of some stuff in sixty six sixty seven there's a_couple_of papers in eighty five there's some papers +/. 621365_632225

you know I do some sort of &-uh quite serious birdwatching and the ornithologists you know tend to be &-uh kind of lumpers or splitters I mean they wanna divide species or xxx but it seemed to me if I looked at for example your two &~n papers in &-uh nineteen eighty five in one case you're setting up a new genus on the other case you're saying these six species are actually all one . 677555_701935
so you don't have any predisposition to +//. 702955_706275
