shortly after ten o'clock on a dark, windy night, a policeman was
trying the doors as he goes, doors of businesses as he goes .
most of the doors are locked .
but he notices a man standing in a doorway holding an unlit cigar .
and he walks up to the man .
and as he approaches, the man says +"/.
+" everything's okay, officer .
+" I'm waiting for a friend .
and he tells the officer that twenty years ago he and his best
and he was leaving New_York the next day .
but Jimmy had refused to leave New_York .
so they parted .
and agreed to meet at the same location twenty years later to see
and he mentioned the name of the restaurant, which I cannot
and the police officer told him that that restaurant had closed
and that this new business was there .
told him that he hoped his friend showed up and that he was well .
and proceeded to move on his way .
shortly after that, a tall gentleman in a raincoat approached the
and says +"/.
+" Bob, is that you ?
and he says +"/.
+" Jimmy ?
+" Jimmy_Wells ?
and they began to talk .
and the tall gentleman in the raincoat says +"/.
+" well, I know a place we can go .
+" and talk .
+" and catch up on old times .
and they proceeded to walk .
and then the first gentleman, Bob, looks up .
and he says +"/.
+" you're not Jimmy_Wells .
says +"/.
+" twenty years is a long time .
+" but not long enough to change a Roman nose into a pug .
and the tall gentleman says, in effect +"/.
+" yeah, you're right .
+" I'm not Jimmy_Wells .
and you have been under arrest for ten minutes because we know that
and here is a note that I was asked to give you .
and as he reads the note in the light from one of the doorways, .
it's Dear_Bob@q .
+" I recognized you when you lit your cigar .
+" I recognized your face, as a person wanted for questioning in
+" but I couldn't be the one to arrest you .
+" so I went around the corner .
+" and got a plainclothes detective to come back .
+" and arrest you .
and it was signed, Jimmy@q .
and that's all I can remember .
the first time I discovered the outlet stores in Reading
and it was middle seventies .
and one of the supervisors there who was also an evangelist
and I decided to go with another girl that worked with us whose
I think her name was Barbara_Chambers .
and she said +"/.
+" Sharon, you've got to go on this trip with me
so I said +"/.
+" okay .
+" a chance to go shopping .
so we had a good time on the bus going up .
I remember that Barbara sat on the bus .
and cornrowed her hair herself on the way on the bus .
and I thought that was amazing because I never learned to cornrow
and certainly couldn't do my own .
so she was cornrowing her hair .
the evangelist was preaching at the front of the bus .
and there was a couple in the back that had a cooler with pretty
so we get to Reading .
and neither Barbara or I had ever been there before .
and the first place we stopped was Vanity_Fair .
and we were walking through .
and we're looking at the lingerie .
and we said +"/.
+" oh this is really pretty .
+" and oh, this is very nice .
but we're looking at the prices .
and we said +"/.
+" I thought this was supposed to be an outlet store .
+" what's going on with these prices .
and we didn't know until ten minutes before we were supposed to
she just said +"/.
+" it's a shopping trip .
so in the last ten minutes, we start grabbing .
and just grabbing and grabbing .
we said +"/.
+" half price oh yeah .
you_know and we're grabbing .
and I remember there was a little bra and panties set on a rack
it was black lace .
it was a black underwire bra .
and a little matching bikini panties .
and I'm reaching for it .
and someone just hits me .
and just knocks me out of the way like I'm in a football game .
and they're tackling me .
and a hand reaches out .
and grabs it away .
and I turned around, highly upset because this was like the main
and it was only the one in my size .
and I said +"/.
+" I don't care who pushed me out of the way .
and grabbed it .
I'm turning around .
and cussing this chick out because that was mine .
and I turned around already to let go with a few choice names .
and it was a nun in her black and white habit .
there was a whole group of nuns there with children they had
so the nun was the one that grabbed the bra and pantie(s) set away
and Barbara stood there and looked .
and she said +"/.
+" what in the world is this nun going to do with
so we did manage to shop .
and we went to a few other outlets .
and very happily coming back on the bus, which would normally on a
noisy coming up and quiet coming back .
so evangelist Ann is no longer preaching .
she's now telling this story of how she caught her husband
and she went after the girl with a knife .
and that, of_course, she still carries the knife .
and I knew that was true because she had shown it off at GPO at
and while she's telling this story in the front of the bus, the
and they've brought out the joints .
and they're all getting high in then back of the bus .
and Barbara and I are caught in the middle .
and we're sitting there looking at each other .
and it's like +"/.
+" okay, did you have a good time shopping ?
+" yeah, I had a great time .
+" I'm coming back to this place .
+" but not with this group .
and, I guess, basically that's about it .
