what I want you to do now there are all the results, okay ? 24023_27621
from our experiment, I want you to now draw up a frequency distribution table . 27621_33141
there are your scores . 33141_34703
do your frequency . 34703_36668
um, we got forty three . 36668_37316
forty three . 37316_39293
thank you . 39293_41356

get the rest of your table completed . 174598_185660
don't forget your headings, Jacques . 185660_258871
is there anyone who hasn't completed the frequency column ? 258871_272088
come on, hurry up . 272088_275731
would you just check your frequency columns, see if you agree with this . 275731_299670
otherwise, your results will be wrong . 299670_304626
who had one, three, one, one, one, one, one, one, two, one and one ? 304626_312058
yeah . 312058_313228
and sigma f@l will be ? 313228_315483
fourteen, correct . 315483_318301
okay, get the other two columns complete . 318301_320821
you can use your calculator . 320821_345756

what's the problem ? 370286_371458
all right . 371458_372860
anyone not completed the F X column ? 372860_377358
you're finding multiplying by one and two difficult ? 377358_384108
oh, you're adding, okay . 384108_389380
okay, let's just check the F X column . 389380_392435
twenty two, seventy five, twenty six, twenty seven, twenty eight, twenty nine, thirty one, thirty three, seventy two, forty two , and forty three . 392435_410731
agreed ? 410731_411841
four twenty eight as sigma F X . 411841_416498
thank you . 416498_417936
anyone not completed the cumulative frequency column ? 417936_422511
here we go . 422511_423295
one, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twelve, thirteen, fourteen . 423295_432588
when you have completed that &~fre uh, cumulative frequency column, what should you check ? 432588_437691
Josh . 437691_439520
that the, um, total that the last number in the cumulative frequency table is equal to sigma F is equal to the sigma F . 439520_447096
sigma F, good . 447096_449006
okay, would you now find for me the three points of central tendency, please . 449006_453951
finished, Josh ? 453951_514996
xxx . 514996_517531
is there anyone else having difficulty with the median ? 517531_528411
okay . 528411_530185
just stop what you're doing, listen in for a moment please . 530185_533280
what is the median score ? 533280_535591
the middle score . 535591_536916
how many pieces of data do we have ? 536916_538335
eleven . 538335_539061

fourteen . 539796_540541
fourteen pieces . 540541_541628
okay, now think of it, fourteen pieces of data balanced, how many on each side ? 541628_546691

have we got any piece of data for the center ? 547695_549630
no . 549630_550821
so we haven't got an actual median which is one of our pieces of data . 550821_554796
what are we going to have to do ? 554796_556390
get the seven and eighth pieces of data, add them together, and xxx . 556390_561043
find their average, okay . 561043_562603
do you understand that, girls ? 562603_564316
