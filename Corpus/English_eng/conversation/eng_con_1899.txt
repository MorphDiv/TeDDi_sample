Five three erm seven times twenty four . 1311993_1317483
That 's right which is . 1318503_1319543
Erm a hundred times twenty four . 1319543_1323683
Well it 's a hundred and sixty eight seven times twenty four but
Okay but I got some right I got the actual question wrong on that
Have you got the second one did n't you get the second one oh you
Yes . 1349593_1349733
Right so yes do that one this is what this is Dublin to Cork . 1349883_1356363
Erm one hundred and ten no one hundred and twenty . 1366273_1373193
Dublin to Cork it 's two hundred and sixty six . 1373193_1377423
Oh I 've done the wrong one a hundred and six I 've got that and
What did you divide by . 1404283_1405283
That . 1409113_1409213
What . 1411673_1411963

Right so two point five is two hours thirty minutes but it 's not
Fifty minutes . 1466633_1466993
Right so what have you got to do You 've got to change the minutes
Oh . 1473443_1473673
have n't you . 1474653_1475623
Eight eight point eight three . 1478013_1483633

Right . 1576603_1576973
Nought point one three . 1577803_1578803
but you 're not gon na divide by nought point one three are you . 1580953_1583403
No ninety one . 1585863_1588173
Right now what I shall do before you go any further is divide that
Nought point four seven nought point four seven . 1606073_1612353
What was it erm six hours twenty eight minutes was it . 1612353_1614613
Yes six point nought what did I say . 1614613_1618783
Yeah . 1618863_1619153

Right no it 's not look it 's ten o'clock to two thirty seven what
Thirty seven . 1679353_1680433
Right so it 's four hours thirty seven minutes is n't it We want
Nought point six two . 1692833_1694593
Right . 1697333_1697633
ninety eight . 1715073_1715703

six eight seven . 1751403_1752273
Erm eight six . 1762463_1764043
Right just do n't do it again . 1765083_1771803
Six . 1775013_1775203
Is this the seven hours thirty nine minutes . 1776163_1777813
Yeah six eight seven . 1778023_1787823
Seven hours . 1787823_1788433

I 'm doing Spain that 's what I 'm doing anyway oh I 've got that
Right so West Germany . 1857203_1860133
One hundred and six . 1860533_1861313
Right . 1861583_1861943
One three seven . 1863913_1866003
Right right what you did n't do almost all the time was to change
Okay . 1889893_1889983
Now just let's have a little help here because you wo n't have this
No . 1899533_1899613
Right so how can you find out what forty minutes is . 1899613_1907343
Divide it by ten . 1907343_1908433
No what decimal fraction of an hour is forty minutes How can you
Quarter three quarters . 1924113_1925963
No what 's what 's a quarter of an hour . 1926083_1928753
Quarter of an hour twenty minutes fours into sixty fifteen . 1928753_1936023
Right so three quarters of an hour is . 1937133_1940753
Forty five . 1940753_1942503
Forty five minutes if you 've got forty five minutes what 's what
Over sixty . 1955393_1957743
Right it 's forty five over sixty you want to change that into a
Erm divide into . 1963293_1968773
No how do you change any fraction into a decimal now this is
Divide it by ten . 1974273_1975383
No no no no you 've got fractions here look erm now how do you
Nought point five . 1996813_1998043
But how did you do it You knew that but how do you do it . 1998223_2002973
Erm . 2002973_2003043
How do you do it on a calculator What does that really mean one
Two over four . 2014673_2017833
Yes but I do n't mean that erm could you would you write it as one
One multiplied . 2031943_2033093
One multiplied by two Two ones are two Does a half equal two So
One . 2047243_2047533
What 's one plus two . 2056893_2057753
Three . 2057813_2058073
What 's one minus two . 2058483_2060553
Nothing minus . 2060553_2062203
0 .
one minus two . 2063783_2067373
One no nothing . 2067373_2071843
One minus two . 2072913_2081163
Minus two . 2081223_2084023
Minus one come down two come down one you get to nought come down
Minus two . 2092543_2092843
so one minus one one minus two is . 2092843_2095283
Minus one . 2095283_2096053
Is minus one what 's one times two . 2096093_2100193
Er two . 2100193_2104203
What 's one divided by two . 2104203_2108273
One . 2108273_2108533
If you 've got one apple and you divide it . 2108853_2115463
Half . 2115463_2115563
Right one divided by two is a half so which of those answers is
Erm one divide . 2129413_2133183
One divided by two right remember that so how can I write that . 2133183_2140633
Forty five divided by six . 2140633_2143283
By . 2143523_2143683
Sixty . 2144273_2144633
Right do that on your calculator . 2145163_2148463
Nought point seven five . 2148463_2156213
Right so that equals nought point seven five what 's a half Do it
Nought point five . 2163283_2165013
Right what 's three quarters divided er as a decimal . 2167923_2175663
Nought point five nought point eight seven five . 2175663_2191673
Right so how do you change a fraction into a decimal . 2191783_2196533
You divide it by the bottom . 2196533_2198063
You divide the top number by the bottom number so supposing you 've
Fifty seven over sixty . 2221353_2222373
Right so how do you change that into a decimal . 2222883_2227143
Nought point nine five . 2232233_2233443
Right nought point nine five so now you can see how easily you can
Thirty . 2255743_2255863
seven minutes so it 's four hours four hours and thirty seven
Erm . 2266083_2266483
Thirty seven minutes . 2267383_2274743
Forty . 2274743_2275093
Thirty seven minutes . 2275703_2277153
over sixty . 2277153_2278143
Right thirty seven over sixty what 's thirty seven over sixty Cos
Mm . 2285393_2285893
so what 's thirty seven sixtieths as a decimal . 2287163_2288773
Nought point six . 2288773_2298523
Right so what 's four hours thirty seven minutes . 2298653_2304713
Four point six . 2304713_2305573
Point six . 2305693_2306103
O . 2306143_2306503
Well six . 2307073_2307823
One . 2307823_2308273
to the nearest two decimal places what 's that gon na be Nought
Nought point six one . 2317743_2318833
to do decimal places . 2319813_2321243
Oh two . 2321243_2322873
Right because that 's bigger than five is n't it . 2323133_2325683
Yes . 2325683_2325813
So it 's nought point six two so for our thirty seven minutes it 's
Mm . 2337723_2338143
Right . 2338143_2338223
Mm . 2339243_2339553
So do this one what is this . 2339983_2343223
Four . 2343223_2343393
Eight hours and four minutes . 2344293_2345563
Four six . 2345563_2347043
So so what 's that gon na be eight hours and four minutes . 2347043_2350093
Nought point nought . 2350093_2354963
It 's it 's eight hours . 2354963_2358343
Yes . 2358343_2358833
so it 's gon na be eight not nought is n't it . 2359393_2361293
Mm . 2361493_2361603
It 's gon na be eight point . 2361603_2363223
Nought one . 2363303_2364653
Nought what . 2364723_2366393
One . 2366393_2366713
Nought one what 's that . 2367113_2370803
Mm erm nought . 2370803_2372793
Nought six six so it 's gon na be to two decimal places it 's gon
Nought point nought seven . 2377213_2377963
Right so it 's gon na be eight point . 2378713_2380213
Nought seven . 2380243_2381283
eighty point nought seven right . 2381553_2383053
Yeah . 2386633_2387003
So you now know how you can change your minutes to decimals . 2387153_2393273
To decimals . 2393343_2393773
Right now you may have to do that on this next one . 2393773_2400153
Tired . 2401033_2402153
I can see that . 2409023_2411113

Has he . 2470803_2471603
He might have I do n't he probably has . 2471603_2473803
Right so it shows a Silverstone motor racing circuit . 2473983_2480643
Yeah . 2480643_2481073
Right so what 's the first . 2481303_2483193
circuit has five corners and ten kerbs car start . 2483193_2488323
0 .
ha car start near Woodcape Corner and go clockwise which corner do
0 .
aha Copse Corner . 2501983_2510993
Right Copse Corner what would you expect to find at Copse Corner .
