she's agreeing with the statement . 397065_398105
and then she says I'm gonna give examples . 399005_400705
&{l=READING Beowulf contains the songs of bards and stories and monologues that tell stories of family feud and bad women to emphasize the traditions of familial relations and acceptable social behavior . 401945_416425
&}l=READING &-um (0.5) &~ho so how is that fitting in with your . 418185_427025
I was confused as to whether like just the sake of tradition was accessing the past or are you looking for like examples like like I have in there like Clovis like how how Gregory of of Tours says you know he &~em he imitates how &-um Constantine &~comp is that more what you're looking ⌈ for or it that this tradition <is making the> ⌉ . 427145_448165
⌊ well I'm I'm ⌋ I'm concerned now I don't quite understand what the point of your example from Beowulf is . 444725_450145
what I read here is that Beowulf contains a number of stories . 451205_456885
stories that are about feuds +... 457465_459565
the only thing you have that refers to the past is &{l=READING they emphasize the traditions of familial relations and acceptable social behavior . 462325_470305
&}l=READING .
so it's &~al it's always been that way like as far as they know . 470745_473545
so what you can say is <that would make> that would make your point more forceful is that these stories celebrate +... 473845_481025
&~ha the heroes and traditions of the past . 484645_487745
and the stories are intended to model present and future behavior on past heroism . 489665_499965
mkay +/.

+, ⌊ but what ⌋ you've written is not precise about the past . 508365_511705
+, okay +/. 511945_512245
+, &-um then you you move to Roland &{l=READING the blood feud is still strong Thierry represents tradition and the pressure to continue in rituals established generations ago when he is demanding that the fictional Charlemagne punish Gamelon he says by virtue of my ancestors I must make this case . 512655_531615
&}l=READING now I think the example from Charlemagne is a very good one . 532115_535155
that's a super example to use . 535835_537315
there is when you're referring to Thierry I think you might put it more precisely give the example more precisely and say the discussion over how to try and punish Gamelon is the discussion of . 537855_559055
like innovation versus tradition or ⌈ something <like that> ⌉ . 559055_563055
⌊ tradition ⌋ versus innovation . 563055_564175
okay . 564395_564655
+, that's a super point . 565205_566245
you're burying it here +... 566825_567825
right if you don't agree with me about what I'm reading into what you've written +/. 570045_572685

+, ⌊ let ⌋ let me know . 573125_573745
+, okay +/. 574125_574165
+, so I think the point is to to <make the> make the example as precise as possible . 574505_579825
then you turn to Gregory of Tours . 582005_585185
and and the life of Clovis . 585905_588645
here is is a tactical mistake . 589865_592705
because Gregory of Tours wrote in the year five ninety four . 594065_600245
+, later ?
+, earlier . 601865_602385
wasn't Clovis in five hundred ? 603405_604585
Clovis Clovis is maybe four ninety six . 605085_607985
but the point is you've just you've done Beowulf and Roland +/. 608565_612425
⌈ oh chronologically ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ Roland is ⌋ ten ninety and now you're going right . 612625_615905
so I should list them chronologically ⌈ all of the examples ⌉ ? 617085_618465
⌊ so I think the best way ⌋ to do it is to do it chronologically . 618485_621205
and that would be before Beowulf ? 621385_622605
and that would be before Beowulf . 622785_624145
okay .
+, &{l=READING &-um he uses a literary convention established in the story of Constantine . 625305_629505
the process of their conversion to Christianity is extremely similar like the celestial vision of the cross &~ma &~ba mass baptism of soldiers and successfully conquering in the name of the Christian God . 630265_642285
&~Clov Gregory has looked to establish validity in Clovis' reign by using parallels to Constantine the first Christian emperor . 643585_650225
&}l=READING Gregory has looked to establish validity in Clovis' reign . 652725_656905
establish validity doesn't . 658365_659885
well he wants to make Clovis more like he's not really Christian but he wants to make him more christianlike@n$adj by emanating . 660405_666905
that's a good point . 667785_668985
establish validity is +//. 670515_671415
you go to the &~s the the state fairgrounds and you get cotton candy . 673915_677915
and you know what is cotton candy ? 679155_680675
it's sort_of air and sugar and finally you hit the cardboard . 680835_684195
you know I don't mean to pick on you +/. 685195_686395

⌊ how about legitimacy ⌋ ? 707685_708485
&~legitimac legitimacy . 708585_709445
validity and legitimacy are two different things . 710145_714645
now lemme tell you what's really going on here . 714785_718325
what's really going on here is +... 718685_720785
&-um I can teach grammar I can teach spelling I can teach punctuation I can teach even a certain amount of history . 725305_734585
but there's one thing that takes time to learn and that I can't teach in one term . 736045_741685
&{l=WRITING and that is diction &}l=WRITING which is the art not the craft of choosing the right word the one that fits . 744465_753865
and that diction is the difference between &{l=WRITING an A and a C +... 754525_759005
&}l=WRITING and if you don't believe me all I ask you to do is to take a look at the admissions essays of people with identical grades and identical board scores the person who comes here and the person who goes to Harvard . 762545_779765
and I've done admissions in both places . 780845_783445
has nothing to do with the quality of your mind or anything like that . 785805_789505
it hasta do with word choice . 789965_792425
and those are really significant things and that is and also the right word will shorten the essay . 795045_801265
it'll give you more time . 801465_802465
so &-um you would put the Clovis example further back +/. 805265_808805
mhm +/.
+, really at the start and say what Gregory at the end of the sixth century is doing is he is using the example of Constantine as a way of legitimizing Clovis . 810085_823425
do you understand that legitimizing is is more accurate than saying what was it +/. 824445_829625
+, mhm +/.
+, establish validity . 831345_831885
yeah that was what I was looking to say I just couldn't verbalize it that way yeah . 832265_834845
this is right and <this is> this is what +//. 835125_837185
the only way to do that is is to read good stuff . 837735_839795
&-um you know . 841495_843435
now I'll tell you in your defense . 843935_844955
&-um the biggest bookstore in Cambridge Massachusetts is the Harvard Coop . 846255_850495
they have something like I dunno a huge inventory something like a hundred and eighty thousand books . 851155_857395
the problem is that a hundred and twenty thousand of them are by Steven King and the other sixty thousand are by John Grisham . 858395_864075
&-um so something is happening in Cambridge maybe that MIT is gonna be the last bastion of the English language . 865105_871225
and you know John Grisham and and Steven King are great writers . 871905_875185
but their vocabulary is severely restricted . 875865_877825
&-um okay +... 879145_880485
now the next example and this is also out_of place is Charlemagne the real Charlemagne . 883465_889805
that should go before Roland . 890945_892365
but after Beowulf . 893225_894225
+, so let's let's in fact just to help you out look at possible examples that one could use . 894345_899605
&-um &=writes:board Clovis who was next ? 900565_904365
+, Beowulf +...
+, then we have Charlemagne spelling Rudi &=writing:board how about somebody between Clovis and Beowulf ? 910635_933675
(0.5) not necessarily a political figure in fact not a political figure . 939345_943025
(0.6) yes ? 943685_949445
Augustine ? 949725_950385
no +/. 950705_951625
⌈ I mean &-um ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ &-um ⌋ Augustine Augustine died in four thirty so Augustine is is further back . 953265_957905
&-um <I want> I want somebody from five twenty nine . 958405_962285
(0.5) not a political figure . 966925_967905
(0.6) yeah . 968525_973345
&-um not five twenty nine but four ninety two Gelasius the First looks back to the Bible with the gospels of two swords . 974265_981925
I hadn't thought of that . 982005_983005
&-um so one example would be Pope Gelasius who who justifies the power of the papacy on the basis of a a biblical text . 983485_996525
now you could actually argue that this is depending on how you feel about it that this is a misuse of the text . 997125_1005445
(0.7) that's that's good . 1012205_1013485
&-um so we have &{l=WRITING Gelasius the first &}l=WRITING the person I was looking for &=writes:board . 1014725_1022405
Benedict . 1023125_1023305
was Benedict and why ? 1023925_1025265
he borrows from Roman kind of civilization the abbot <a la> father in the way he constructs his rule . 1025965_1032285
&-um is <is the> is the abbot of a monastery is no more and no less than &-uh &~ju kind of the model Roman father . 1032805_1042225

I talked about that in in in lecture so not all the +//. 1045805_1049365
&-uh the reason I you know I I I mention these just to point out that not all of your examples need be political examples . 1049685_1057485
yes ? 1058805_1059625
they had had great contact with Roman civilization the people who were basically like speaking or writing Beowulf and possibly the monastery I can understand that but would there be a_lot_of kind_of looking back at the past in that work ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 1059975_1072135
⌊ well ⌋ there was as I tried to suggest to you +/. 1073215_1076275
mhm +/.
+, and I think if I remember correctly you all didn't buy it . 1077255_1079435
&-um one thing in Beowulf where there appears to be some some tissue of misunderstanding and that is . 1080265_1090225
the giants or ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 1090485_1091565
⌊ &-uh ⌋ the race of the giants who you know constructed the barrow with the vault and the arch &-um but that's an example of their having some very vague sense of the Roman past but I think that that would be &-uh it would be a &~wo <it would> it would not it doesn't serve in this essay . 1092425_1114985
mhm that's what I thought +/.
+, because this essay is not simply about what was the memory of Rome this essay is how did people they how did they actually solve problems . 1116235_1126275
and by relying on the &~e example of the past . 1127355_1129735
let me go on . 1131075_1132235
&{l=READING by crowning Charlemagne in eight hundred Leo the Third and the Catholic church are &~use are looking to establish a Roman emperor like those who lived hundreds of years ago . 1136105_1144745
the unifying impact of the Roman emperor would benefit the church in eight hundred by protecting it much as the ancient Roman emperor did for the city of Rome . 1145345_1153305
&}l=READING perfectly straightforward clear excellent example to use I have one nit to pick and that is that the term Catholic has no meaning before &-um let's say fifteen hundred . 1153395_1168915
+, so could ⌈ you ⌉ +/. 1169795_1170195
+, ⌊ but ⌋ that's such a minor . 1170195_1171195
&~i so then would church be lower case or upper case or like how +/. 1171435_1174475
oh +/. 1174955_1175395
+, I mean so you just say the church ⌈ and you assume that ⌉ . 1176175_1179035
⌊ oh I think you can ⌋ I as far as I'm concerned you could use have it on a lower case or upper case . 1178385_1182645
in handwriting &-uh I find it difficult to distinguish . 1183205_1186225
&-uh but just simply refer to the church . 1187145_1188445
okay +/.
+, &~cr the the the Christian church <it's a> <it's a> &~s it's a fine point but it's it's it's important to bear it &-uh to to bear in mind . 1190245_1198765
that's a fine example . 1200245_1201245
&-um and that would go that would've gone here . 1202705_1207985
&=writing:board &{l=READING Louis the Ninth looked to the life of Jesus twelve hundred years ago to give meaning and guidance to his life . 1209685_1221225
often in Joinville's Life he relates how Louis wanted to be humble and imitate Jesus' gestures . 1222345_1226585
&}l=READING fine . 1228045_1228545
<you could> you could give an example depending on how the time constraint was but that's perfectly good . 1230255_1238075
(0.7) &=writes:board &-um notice that I mentioned earlier how Gregory the Seventh looked to the past or claimed that nothing he was doing was new . 1239715_1251335
so you could around the time of Roland put in Gregory the Seventh . 1252035_1256375
&{l=READING Galileo quoted numerous men is in his letter who lived long before he did . 1261155_1265435
he used the examples of work by Tertoli and Aquinas Copernicus Saint Augustine . 1265595_1269315
by quoting them he tries to establish his work within the context of others which came before him . 1269955_1274255
&}l=READING &-um and I think you should say he was using them to bolster his case by saying what I say about the relationship between observation and authority is the same . 1275225_1291765
as what they said . 1292905_1293485
+, uhuh +/.
+, it's like that old ad my broker is and my broker says that's an excellent example . 1295345_1301845
that's an excellent example . 1302345_1303505
then you the SANs all these men have taken something from the past and mimicked or used what they have found there . 1305205_1313925
sometimes the resemblance is striking other times subtle but it is still exhuming the traditions of the past to base these &~a actions of the present upon which is &-uh perfectly good . 1315125_1323925
so I think the what I would suggest would be to check the diction a little bit organize chronologically &-um and I would &-um I don't remember how ever many examples I might add to . 1325565_1343985
&~hit add two more . 1346545_1347225
add add two more I didn't make a count but . 1347445_1349445
and then like expound on what I had like and then go ⌈ into more in depth each one ⌉ . 1349445_1352725
⌊ yeah yeah I well ⌋ I when I <when I> when I say more in depth I think that you know I thought that that Leo the Third was really good I thought that the Beowulf example wasn't precise +/. 1352465_1363985
mhm +/.
+, and I think you could actually rewrite that and even make it &~s make shorten it . 1364945_1369165
&-um can you do the Beowulf example in one sentence ? 1370445_1372685
I think you could it might be a complex sentence but you might be able to do it . 1372845_1375505
+, mhm +/.
+, &-um here &-uh the main point is clear . 1376165_1380285
and then you have examples . 1382685_1384245
and it is the examples that lift the essay and make it a really good essay . 1384685_1387985
so it's okay to have that many examples ? 1388345_1390325

okay +/. 1466035_1466335

do you want me to look at the other essay ? 1469055_1471155
someone else can go that's alright . 1471935_1473555
&=laughs .
okay . 1473895_1473935

you can you yes you can do that . 1492885_1494825

that this man who's who's the who's fundamentally an illiterate killer &-um &-um so it's it's a you can say that you could make the argument they say they're doing this but they sure aren't . 1523785_1542545
and that's why I that's why I <put that> &~e put that example in . 1543485_1548785
I mean yeah Galileo uses Augustine . 1550045_1552985
but Augustine never observed nature and made the observation of nature . 1554605_1560265
Augustine never did experiments . 1561045_1563245
so yes <you could> you could you could turn it on turn it on its head very easily . 1564865_1569365
would you have other examples that you'd had in mind about ⌈ that Ken ⌉ ? 1569885_1574325
⌊ well &-uh ⌋ Beowulf is a great one . 1574325_1576145

+, one of the reasons why pilgrimage is so significant in Catholicism and is not significant in Protestantism &-uh is is because of that distance . 1633545_1643005
and so it's it's a question of we're trying to look back to the past but it's a past that they've constructed with their present . 1644245_1651445
made it up +/. 1651465_1651985
+, made it up . 1652745_1652965
&-uh I can give you an example I can offer you an example of of a case which is &-um &-uh a direct case of rejecting the image of the past and that is the transformation the movement from Merovingian kingship to Carolingian kingship . 1653785_1669825
when Pepin Pepin knows how the Merovingians arranged their government . 1671065_1678805
and he says this doesn't work nuts to it . 1679745_1683945
long flowing blond hair forget it . 1685625_1687745
descendent from a seahorse forget it . 1689285_1691725
&-um &-um warriors clashing their swords together and you know yelling forget that . 1693665_1700485
no . 1701225_1701405
so Pepin is gets a a a kind_of a letter of permission from the Pope &-um he is anointed that's a case where there's a very explicit rejection of the past . 1702165_1718085
another case of_course <is is> is is Francis . 1719625_1721925
so <you can> you can either agree and I think <in a> <in a> &~g in a graduate seminar it would probably take the case that and agree with it more than disagree that there would be a hefty part of an essay in a graduate that would do this . 1722605_1745025
you can disagree . 1746445_1747005
and you can say you know a little bit of one <or or> or or or or the little bit of &~anoth <you can> <you can> you can disagree as Ken is doing or you can disagree on the basis of actual fact <where they> where they know what they're doing <and they> and they look they they they look elsewhere . 1748565_1765065
yes ? 1766225_1766365
but with Saint Francis and Pepin couldn't you both say couldn't you say for both that although they may have +//. 1766745_1772005
&~the there was still an element of looking to the past (be)cause Saint Francis &~t had the element of looking back to Christ for an example while sort_of rejecting current authority . 1772855_1780235
and &-um Pepin &~ha was anointed just like you know the Roman emperors in in ways looking back that ⌈ way too ⌉ . 1781215_1787395
<you can> you can make the case though on one level I mean you can make the the nebbish case which is a little bit of this and a little bit of that which is a perfectly acceptable case . 1787415_1796035
Pepin is saying the tradition of the Merovingians screw it . 1796635_1800395
nuts to it . 1801525_1801645
no more . 1802345_1802605
I'm gonna do something new except that part of it is very old . 1803865_1807105
what is new is I'm getting papal sanction what is old is I'm doing &-uh what happened to David I'm going to be anointed +... 1808145_1814385
so so you could do that . 1817685_1818565
and there are &-uh Francises on the one hand &-uh very much looking to the past but what what Francis ends up doing is is throwing down the gauntlet to the entire system including including the historical church . 1819585_1835125
when Francis said says take your money throw it away and and and and do what Jesus did that is a threat to every cathedral +... 1836995_1848655

but he as himself was never ordained . 1888225_1891145
&-um and didn't have the kind of powers of delivering sacraments that that that that a priest did . 1893205_1899525

⌈ yeah they changed it ⌉ +/.

⌈ Franciscans &~w ⌉ there was a change in the order that occurred partly because the people who followed Francis's injunctions most closely ultimately were convicted of heresy in large part because of what they +//. 1909435_1927815

&-uh now there're Franciscans I mean I don't know what the +//. 1931315_1934955
I don't know the history of the order later after thirteen twenty two so I don't know and I'm not certain <what the> what the textbook hasta say about that so &~s &~s since it's so long since I've looked at it . 1936245_1946705
so I it could well be . 1947565_1949205
yes ?
wouldn't that also be a case of like the church twisting Francis's image basically to fit into their institution like with Saint Bonaventure's &-um biography ⌊ xxx ⌋ . 1950305_1960885
⌈ well ⌉ I I think that Francis <is the> is the classic case &~i is the classic case of doing that . 1961115_1966555

&-uh I think Francis was aware of that . 1977755_1979775

&=laughs you might've you might put something in &=laughs:S5 about the Renaissance . 2036265_2038825

good good set of examples there . 2052005_2054185
&-um now the way you could make Ken's case would be to say yeah you look to the past &-uh but what happens as soon as they discover the Americas or they land in the Americas and they realize all of a sudden that that past authority that no one had mentioned the New World . 2055465_2077525
no one had mentioned the Americas . 2078505_2079365
by the way I don't care if you use New World or discovery of the Americas or whatever but be aware that in nineteen hundred and ninety two there was a whole big schmear about it that you know they didn't discover it it existed already the Arawak they all knew that they who they were they didn't need Columbus to say guess what guess who you are . 2080865_2101765
&-um you don't hafta get into that . 2102785_2103745
&-um &-uh &-uh I will not mark you down if you use the the the phrase New World even for it was not a new world &-um (0.5) &-um but the there are the examples of and and the examples in the Renaissance I mean &-uh you know Copernicus is to some extent a figure of the Renaissance . 2106225_2131085
so you can use that but I think that that &-uh that the the search for answers was to some extent a search for &-um examples from the past . 2133545_2148205
Machiavelli's Prince it's really dazzling how little &~evide when Machiavelli wants to say something about how you should govern and he gives examples he takes examples from Rome and from Greece . 2148525_2161465
he does not take examples from say the thirteenth century history of Florence which he might well have done to make the same point they don't have the same value to him as do the examples from the past . 2161945_2171965
(0.10) as you can see the easiest answer to write to that particular question is one that searches for examples that support it . 2172605_2190865
(0.5) that's the simplest way to approach it . 2194085_2195925
in an an upper division course <it would not be> &~a it would not be as correct an answer we'd want as something that has more what what Ken was suggesting +... 2198965_2206025

the custom of the manor this is the way we've been doing things for <ages and> <ages and> ages and ages . 2278965_2283065
and so someplace around between the real Charlemagne and Roland &=writes:board I would prefer that you use the phrase feudal regime words that end in ISM have no meaning . 2284235_2299915
I mean if you think about it they really don't . 2300615_2304015

the systems of homage and vassalage that're set into motion <and that> and that persist for four or five hundred years . 2321145_2327725

a breadth would be good any other questions about this essay yes ? 2349005_2352265
can we also use the example from &-uh Roland about how Charlemagne was confused in this &-um period of transition from using custom into &-um getting a a number of vassals to decide what's the right thing to do ? 2352365_2366625
<you could> you could do that . 2366705_2368105
you could do that then you would be then you would be dealing in part with +//. 2368525_2372145
that that's a counterexample to this quotation . 2374185_2376905
and you could build up you could build up the the &-uh the the set of counterexamples as we as I've given you some . 2377525_2387545
but that would certainly serve +//. 2388345_2389305
the whole question of the trial of Gamelon could be you could say you know this demonstrates that in the year ten ninety you have people who're puzzled about whether past experience should be the guide because past experience isn't working out . 2389725_2408245
you could put Beowulf stand Beowulf on his head and say they say they're looking to the past and all the stories are about the past but all the stories you end up with failure . 2409405_2424065
they look to the past and say kinship is crucial and Beowulf has no sons etcetera etcetera etcetera so <you could> you could make you could use &-uh Beowulf to to to argue that case . 2425655_2438295
the the real answer is of_course it's a mixture of of this and Ken's point . 2440615_2445935
(be)cause that's the way it really was . 2447195_2448415
but at a hundred level course I'm not gonna to to make that crucial . 2449445_2454525
you had your hand up partly . 2455265_2457765
yeah I was just gonna say that is there not also could you not also point to like Roland and &~O versus &~Ol and Oliver ⌈ because xxx in Europe ⌉ . 2458685_2463105

and here're some examples of that . 2485645_2487005
&-um one example a really good example would be &-um the difference between Joinville &-um and Louis . 2488525_2496425

law student . 3786365_3787185
law . 3787985_3788705
so (0.6) no ? 3790185_3796565
Roman law ? 3796965_3798365
Roman law . 3798585_3801785
Roman law is is &~i it permeates European law just get tossed in the jug on the continent and and you'll find that it is unbelievably different from what we have here and that is because &-uh European legal systems are fundamentally founded upon principles of Roman law which work very differently from our own . 3799095_3821555
very differently . 3822295_3822975
&-um so &=writing:board you see here you have authority emanating from an office +... 3824305_3835145
(be)cause you're gonna have a nebbish who's an emperor +... 3838305_3839625
whereas you can't have a nebbish who's the leader of a war band right ? 3843405_3845865
you will never see a movie of Beowulf that stars Woody Allen . 3846165_3848865
whereas you can see lots_of movies about Roman emperors that can star &~Wo Woody Allen . 3850705_3854885
he's gonna hafta do something about the accent but &-um and so there's office and a written law . 3855225_3863065
(0.9) yeah ? 3864145_3871165
with the &-um the question of the war like the king is &+th +//. 3871545_3874065

⌈ the leader ⌉ of the war band +/. 3877485_3878165
+, yeah could you bring in the idea then of gunpowder and then the change from the kind of chivalry feudal knight who's the most powerful warrior to the notion of like because that would be a big change in ⌊ authority right ⌋ ? 3878235_3889915
⌈ I never ⌉ thought of that &-uh would that have a bearing on what a source of authority is ? 3889915_3896215
(be)cause if you had money wealth power . 3897095_3899415
I think you could make it somewhat broader than that . 3899855_3904375
I think you could say that after fourteen twenty five or something like that that that +... 3905555_3914855
&-um (0.5) that technology +... 3918435_3924595
and the ability to control technology is an important base for authority . 3928825_3935365
I mean +... 3937065_3937325
otherwise why would you +//. 3939005_3943425
notice that that that +... 3944045_3945625
the three field system the horse collar things like that they were these were invented by individuals . 3947805_3952365
we have no idea what their names were because it didn't mean anything to people at the time . 3952625_3956225
but &-uh one one wants to know &-um who is the deviser of technological items . 3957015_3964675
&-um because those things confer both profit and power over a period of time so that you can say that control of technology is a basis of authority after about fourteen twenty five . 3965535_3980395
that's about as well as I can do kind of thinking on my feet about it but it certainly is true . 3981575_3986635
it certainly is true . 3987455_3988095
&-uh notice that that &-um (0.5) &-uh one other thing that enters into this question is that when you talk about the Renaissance Era you may say that well theological works no longer are bases of authority but &-uh the example <of the> of the Greco_Roman past is now in authority . 3990095_4017035
you don't wanna know any more what Aquinas hadta say about something you wanna know what Plato or Aristotle hadta say about it . 4017815_4024415
and later on &-uh when you're dealing with the rise of of science you can say that &-uh what confers authority is is is &-um right you no longer look to see what Ptolemy hadta say now you look to see what &~e experiment and observation have to say . 4025855_4043935
so this is not simply a a a political matter . 4045335_4047975
(0.15) what else did you wanna offer on the matter of of authority ? 4050055_4066175
&-um I guess I think next we talked about &-um &-uh I I guess sort_of the &~m I &~don I don't know if this would be any different than Beowulf necessarily but with the Merovingians and the Carolingians and sort_of well I guess there's a difference between the two but . 4066295_4082255
well what gives &-um +... 4082795_4085155
for the for this society and for the Merovingians +/. 4087975_4091335
mhm +/.

+, strength +/.
+, is is is military power . 4099495_4101815
isn't it also mysticism though in a way ? 4102355_4104015
well not mysticism . 4104315_4105975
again I'm getting here to this this matter of diction . 4106235_4109155
&-um &-uh because because none of them were mystics . 4110235_4114215
I mean they write they they just weren't mystics . 4114855_4117815
&-um but what I think you're suggesting is that +... 4118705_4122425
what made &-um what gave some of the authority to the Merovingians was not only the fact that that their leaders at least of origins were powerful but these folkloric aspects . 4125945_4138265
such as the long blond hair . 4140145_4141385
&-um things like that . 4142985_4144085
<and then> and then &-um I mean for instance <you could> <you could> you could build an essay let's see . 4145445_4154945
let's say you don't wanna spend half the essay on law . 4156625_4158505
let's say I'm going to spend half this essay talking about political authority . 4159665_4163645
therefore I'm going to talk about what makes somebody a king . 4164645_4166985
what makes somebody a king in Augustus' time is possession of an office and the protection of the law . 4168525_4179365
what makes somebody a king in Beowulf's time is military prowess generosity heroism . 4180685_4188345
what makes someone a king in the time of Pepin is &-um yeah approval of the troops military power but also you need to have papal sanction anointment . 4189645_4203025
what makes somebody &-uh &-uh a &-uh good king &-uh in the time of oh I don't know Philip Augustus eleven eighty to twelve twenty &-uh is &-um you need now a bureaucracy you no longer need to be very +//. 4203805_4221505
you no longer hafta have physical strength (be)cause you no longer need to lead the armies &-uh you need to have full control of feudal law feudal custom at your disposal you need to have lots_of vassals things like that . 4221975_4235895
what do you need to be a good king in the year fifteen hundred ? 4236295_4238975
guns . 4239115_4239855
guns &-uh a good &-uh internal revenue service you know you could look at it you could look at it that way . 4240715_4248455
but certainly that would only be half of it the other half would be to look at some other aspect of it which is &-um intellectual authority . 4249055_4258155
I've given a_couple_of examples of of of that . 4260035_4263615
yes ? 4264335_4265315
&-um the way I constructed this essay I just wanna see if this is &~wro &-uh true if this is an acceptable way or not is that I define authority in either being with the king with religion or with science and then I said the first tension that &-uh &-uh time we covered in class was between the king and religion and then I gave examples . 4265895_4284935
and then the second tension . 4285315_4286155
give me an example . 4286215_4286775
between kings and religion ? 4287675_4288835
yeah +/. 4289015_4289215
+, &-um Leo the Third and Charlemagne . 4289775_4291775
okay &~w it's not kings and religion kings and the church +/. 4292315_4295675
the church yeah ⌊ yeah I'm sorry ⌋ +/. 4296155_4297535
+, ⌈ okay yeah alright ⌉ .
and then the second tension which came later on was between religion and science for example Galileo . 4297875_4303515
yeah +/. 4303735_4303895
+, so is that an &~accepta . 4304515_4305335
that's a way of doing it +/. 4305615_4306475
mkay +/.
+, that's a way of doing it . 4307355_4307955
that is to say that to to think of it in terms not of what defines authority but in a given period what were the alternatives and how did they &-um &-uh clash with each_other . 4309235_4324395
yes ? 4326135_4326155
what about like a change to from like the divine right of kings +/. 4326695_4329615
⌊ same thing ⌋ +/. 4330575_4330835
+, ⌈ to the ⌉ kind of okay . 4330835_4331795
that's the same thing . 4331855_4332535
same thing and notice that you might say there's a notion that power &~f I mean for a thousand years power descended . 4333145_4340905
it descended to kings it descended to to popes or to priests as well . 4341705_4347525
and in the eleventh century there was a big dispute about who got more of it . 4348325_4353345
and part of the end of that dispute was a notion that the subjects have the right to rebel and to &~po &~a rebel against and to &~de depose a a &-uh &-uh an unjust ruler . 4354975_4368795
and that gets the camel's nose inside the tent . 4369675_4374955
and then later you can talk about how that is you you have a beginnings of notions of government which are ascending rather than descending . 4375935_4386215
papacy never accepts that but it certainly is something which is a part of the Reformation . 4387375_4391935
what is an example of the people deposing a ruler that early ? 4393415_4398175
oh there is no example of people well there is no example of people deposing a ruler that early but what you do have is already in the eleventh century at the time of the investiture contest there's a_lot_of literature that says this is justified . 4399605_4412745
just the uprisings on the manor ? 4414245_4415425
is that . 4415705_4415905
no that <when you have an> &-uh when you have an unjust monarch that it is legitimate to to depose him . 4416305_4422505
&-uh the first example in which there is a monarch whose will is is curtailed +... 4423705_4431345
we have that we have that from the year twelve fifteen . 4432825_4435005
and what is the document that's associated with that ? 4436325_4438185
Magna Carta ? 4438365_4438945
Magna Carta . 4439025_4439585
Magna Carta is I mean if you read Magna Carta and in the long course we do read Magna Carta if you read Magna Carta there is nothing in it that looks anything like that that will lead to to to modern constitutional government . 4440935_4455315
but in fact there're bits and pieces of it which are just &~ex they're time bombs . 4455955_4458935
very explosive . 4459535_4460395
(0.5) I I chose authority because I wanted to give you the opportunity to think about various options (0.5) I know people sometimes tell you that an exam is supposed to be a learning experience and I know what joy that gives you well at least I remember what joy it gave me but I do wanna &-um I wanna give you the opportunity to to to think about these things and develop some ideas . 4467685_4495585
and I always find things that I never thought of before which is good . 4496405_4499045
&-um ⌊ I guess ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ yeah go on ⌉ . 4499545_4502485
then we went to &-um Pepin and Charlemagne just +/. 4502685_4505825
⌊ yes ⌋ +/. 4506225_4506405
+, ⌈ you see what ⌉ I'm saying about that brings up the first fundamental penchant of authority not sort_of lying in an individual but sort of there being an institution +/. 4506445_4513485
+, ⌊ yes mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ the church and stuff ⌉ and then I guess we went on to &-um Roland and it being this really increasing feudal custom that gave authority so &~th &-uh the lord &-um became the the authority figure . 4513765_4528085
like a decentralized power ? 4528465_4529725
well there there's a pyramid +/. 4531005_4532645
mhm +/.
+, and so authority +... 4533245_4535785
the the the primary authority is is whoever your primary lord is . 4539255_4544875
on the manor +... 4547635_4548315
the lord of the manor to the serfs is the person who tells them what to do . 4552395_4557455
but power on the manor is twofold there's on the one hand the authority that the lord of the manor has but there's also the power of custom +... 4558955_4565895
custom plays a larger role I think overall in the countryside on the manors . 4570535_4574975
whereas <in the> <in the> in the the feudal regime involving lords and vassals not serfs then there was a pyramid of of authority . 4577155_4585635
there's an understanding of of what the obligations are both ways but there is a pyramid of authority . 4586055_4590375
and again there's nothing written . 4591375_4592435
neither on the manor there's nothing written because nobody could read and nobody could write &-um and &-uh the lord and and vassal &-um until the twelfth century or (un)til late in the twelfth century also it's it's &-uh &-uh there there's custom but it's it's a clear indication of a pyramid and and of one person &-uh <they're both> they're both &-uh nobles . 4592865_4617665
but it is your lord <who is> who is the the the authority figure as Roland shows us . 4619295_4627515
I &-um we did &-um sort_of a brief outline but then we went on to in terms of Louis and Charlemagne &-um where the king has the king is more like of a actual power figure himself . 4627635_4642875
&-um and that this is although it's in a time of of deep feudalism that it's sort_of this rise of individualism with king Louis saying +"/. 4643145_4650265
+" alright &~w tell me what you think . 4650585_4651925
and then he says +"/. 4652365_4652765
+" mm never mind I'm gonna do it my way . 4652885_4654765
that's good . 4656265_4657085
okay . 4657865_4658185
+, that's good . 4658785_4659125
that's good . 4659385_4659645
+, &-um and then ⌊ there's ⌋ +/. 4660745_4662705
+, ⌈ that's that's ⌉ very good . 4662825_4663625
(0.6) it's not the first example but certainly the first example that you have of the reading list for this particular iteration of this course is is &-uh where you have a &-uh &-uh: a ruler for whom there we can really see the taking of council in a number of different ways . 4669685_4688485
there's one thing that I mentioned to you about that book <which is> <which is> which is problematic . 4690305_4696705
and that is that that &-uh that Joinville hides from us &-uh the the layers of administration (0.6) . 4697315_4705035
but at the same time there's a constant struggle between the church and the state with Louis with the whole example with the friar . 4706475_4717395
yeah but that's that's not a struggle between church and state +/. 4717955_4721095
but within +/.
+, &-um because what there is however +/. 4721355_4724755
+, mhm +/.
+, what there is is is lemme first of all deal <with the> with the what +//. 4726385_4730405
it's not a struggle it's that Louis wants to have some of the the borrowed charisma that he can get from this Franciscan and the man says no . 4730405_4739265
thank you no this is +//. 4739965_4741125
sorry this is government is by nature corrupt . 4741485_4745025
but where there is an interesting tension is when the church excommunicates somebody . 4750275_4756055
and they ask Louis help us and Louis says I don't happen to agree with you . 4757055_4761175
and here we see a monarch who turns to the church which after all has all kinds of authority and says my independent judgment is sufficient authority for me to act when it comes even to matters of the presentation or the safeguarding or the defense of the faith . 4763505_4788945
that's not the example you had in mind but that's I think a +/. 4790805_4793465
+, okay +/.
+, that fits much better . 4794305_4795585
that was part of one of our one that we had thought about before &-um +/. 4796125_4798845
yeah +/.
+, when he was listening to sort_of more like his counsellers or his +/. 4799245_4801925

+, sort_of a bigger institution than he ⌊ <was and he> ⌋ +/. 4802105_4804365
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, <threw (th)em out> but &-um .
one thing to to to think about is &~i with that particular essay is (0.7) do yourself an organizational favor . 4808345_4823485
&=writing:board &-um there's another one (0.9) &=writes:board I guess we could call it independent judgment . 4841765_4856925
(0.7) and you might because we've talked of a number of different ways about thinking about &~insti about about authority . 4864085_4870845
&-um and what times are institutions really significant ? 4871845_4877705
I guess at the beginning and towards the end of the class . 4878805_4882265
and what time is authority a matter that is personal ? 4883085_4889785
clearly +... 4891665_4892325
Clovis on for quite a while . 4895145_4897185
and remember institutions is not simply royal but also ecclesiastical papal . 4901165_4909465
are there points when ideas or books have authority ? 4911305_4915605
this is I &~a again could be really early antiquity could be Renaissance could be later on as well age of science and is there a time when independent judgment and that includes technology age of technology and science . 4917785_4935905
that is to say a point when authority rests in something that is new something that is devised by individuals a time when we care about people who are not kings and not soldiers +... 4938055_4953495
and there there is clearly such a time later on Galileo Kepler Tycho Copernicus Newton see that's another way of +//. 4956315_4965095
I want you to think about how you're gonna organize your answer . 4966065_4970525
+, yeah . 4975345_4975425
and then we went on to we I mean discussed the thirteenth century conflict between Innocent the Third and the German monarchy as being just this just sort of this <water shedding down> the institution of religion ⌊ versus this German monarchy ⌋ . 4975625_4993225
⌈ <yeah a> yeah a second yeah a ⌉ second &-um &-uh &-uh that's that's the act two of the investiture contest +/. 4989825_4995545
right .
+, that would do . 4997105_4997485
&-um and then the &~fo how fourteenth century and sort_of like post Black Death is leads to the end of feudalism with the rise of the middle class and sort_of a more free . 4998085_5010605
those things happened but I would not necessarily say that those are that there was the one cause which would be the Black Death &-um . 5011415_5021255
I didn't &~sa I just said it was sort_of post Black Death . 5021255_5023515
okay &-um +... 5023795_5025255
think here for just a second +... 5027795_5028915
just the destruction <of feudalism> of feudalism . 5030695_5033215
&-uh the decay I think of feudalism . 5033655_5040315
you know if you wanted to you could certainly in in this &-um might not work so well here well it might but you might &~s you might want to ask yourself notions of authority . 5040185_5058785
do those +... 5059405_5061305
what does a Black Death do to those ? 5063485_5065265
and you can point out that since it was so unexpected . 5066265_5068525
&~i that did like questioning the authorities and the &-uh &~i help the rise of universities and new religious ideas and all that kind of stuff . 5069625_5076985
well the universities are older +/. 5078045_5079585
right +/. 5080145_5080285
+, and so are a_couple_of the other things that you mentioned what what it does do is (0.5) it is like the the voyages of the Portuguese and of Columbus . 5081065_5097185
it's that the things that one had relied on for authority before seem helpless or ignorant . 5097685_5108245
(0.6) so the whole idea of what constitutes authority is &~so something that people have to ask themselves again . 5114825_5120845
church argues that the Black Death is of_course punishment for our sins +... 5123385_5126165
but the the the devastation was so great that people thought anew about all kinds of things . 5127645_5137785
hadta rethink them . 5137785_5139525
and then the fifteenth century with the discoveries . 5140105_5142485
the fact that no book written prior +... 5143865_5147985
&-um mentions them is a stunning blow to the authority of the Bible and of &-um the works of classical antiquity . 5150925_5162905
and it raises the question of the growth of the notion that authority resides at least in part in personal observation and in experimentation . 5166345_5174525
I guess we went kind of on to the Reformation and &~i &~i &~i it questions religious authority and sort_of the Pope's actual authority over people's ideas and sort_of spirituality +/. 5175785_5191505
yeah +/.
+, and what not . 5192405_5196185
for Luther what is the what is the source of authority ? 5192555_5196495

I I don't know if you wanna distinguish it in terms of classes of people but you can say that that certainly a new source of authority lies in &-um observation experimentation those who have the power to derive general laws that is people who can perform mathematical manipulation so it could be tinkerers it could be people sitting &-um like like Newton under an apple tree (0.7) does does that ? 5305855_5335835

by the time of like Newton has the church &~a actually become secondary ? 5346795_5350335

&-uh (be)cause <I took> I took a seminar in in <Catholic law> Catholic law of marriage and divorce actually <from a> <from a> &~fr from a former professor at Notre Dame who's now a regular appointee to the federal appeals court . 5497955_5513095

you know our law and the law of the church are really very different . 5522225_5525225

&=laughs .
there are traditionally &-um two ways of approaching that question . 5618795_5623355
the first is +... 5624335_5625375
each one talks +... 5627535_5629675
and explains the views that he has +... 5632795_5637955
a second approach is &-um that you think okay what are the possible ways in which one or the other of them might say this is what Caesar means to me . 5642275_5654435
and then have them go back and forth about that . 5655755_5658115
and and I I'm not looking for something witty &=laughs:SUm I mean I have in the past had some some really really great essays on that as works of literature and some of those also were great works of history as well . 5659195_5675015
but the trap is the trap is to start a food fight . 5676115_5679195
&-um &-uh so you could decide what Caesar means what what what are the things that are Caesar's what are the things that are Christ's ? 5680545_5690705
and and &-uh (0.5) Beowulf might be thinking simply &-um he might have to ask somebody what Caesar means and then kind of decide on his own &-um what that means . 5692105_5712985

&-um yeah ? 6536485_6540305
I have a question concerning this quote from Galileo +/. 6540645_6543325
yeah .
+, &-uh how could he be justified &-um in the fact that he's actually sending this letter to a woman how would she have felt about it ? 6543805_6550625
well I don't know you know what she would have made of it and as far as I know about the documentary record of it which I don't know well &-um that that wasn't so much the argument because he was using the quotation from an earlier source . 6551235_6565735
the fact that what the salon really was was I mean she was an intelligent woman she would ask questions about it and he wrote this to respond to her objections to the Copernican theory and to this whole question of of the goal of theology and what we would call science . 6566865_6586265
&-um so he certainly felt that it was worthwhile doing so . 6586625_6590545
he also felt that this would &~s in responding to her he would this would be a way of responding to his critics <and that> and that she would be an appropriate person because she had a certain amount of influence and power and authority in among the governing circles . 6591145_6609825
so I think on a whole the fact that it's addressed to her is much more important than <this particular> this particular passage . 6610905_6620165
but isn't he actually contradicting himself ? 6620985_6623305
(be)cause he is he in on the one hand he's trying to use her authority and her influence +/. 6623705_6628825
yes +/.

&-um most of which I have not read many of which I never will read &-uh but I hadta do that because the schedule +//. 6907115_6913995

there's only one last thing that I could tell you I swear this to you on God's God's right arm . 7021515_7027735
