once upon a time there was a boy who owned a frog and also a dog .
and he was up in his room .
it was almost nighttime .
so soon he hadta go to sleep with his dog on his bed .
and the frog was trying to get out <of> his jar that he put
and when the boy woke up his frog wasn't in his jar .
so now the boy was looking everywhere .
<he probably> now he's looking under the boots .
and the dog stuck his head in the jar for some xxx reason .
now the dog and the boy are calling out the window .
but even if the frog could hear him he couldn't hear the dog
the dog jumps out and hits his head on the ground .
but it doesn't hurt because he has this jar over him .
then the boy <has a mean face on his> has a bad face on his
now the boy is calling for the frog with the dog looking up in the
the boy is calling down a hole .
and the dog's barking <or> and jumping up at a beehive .
then the boy looks and sees I think it's either a weasel or
and the dog's trying to climb up the tree to hit the beehive .
he is successful .
and he hits the beehive .
now the bees are after him .
and the boy is calling in a hole in a tree .
the bees swarm by .
<so he hasta fall> so he hasta fall down on the ground .
or he'll get hit .
and they're still after the dog .
soon a bird comes nearby .
and the boy is trying to duck from it .
then he climbs up on a rock and yells to see if he can find him .
then <a moose> a moose comes up from behind the rock .
and he gets caught between his antlers .
now the moose is running after the dog .
and the dog is looking at the boy while he is running .
both the boy and the dog fall off the cliff into a big pond .
at the pond they land swoosh right into the water .
the dog landed on the boy's head .
and they thought they heard something .
they looked <behind a tree actually> over a tree branch .
and they found two little frogs .
one of them was their frog .
then they looked at all the little frogs .
so then the boy said goodbye to the frog because he knew he was
and the dog went with him home .
that was great .
so let's start with the first page .
once upon a time there was a boy who lived with a frog named
he felt happy and joyful with it .
and also he felt happy because he had <a pet> a pet dog .
his frog looks like a new pet .
and they were happy .
so then they went to sleep .
and as they were sleeping the frog got up and hopped out_of his jar
then when the boy woke up &-um he said oh no where has my little
and the dog <looked> just got up behind him and was looking
I wonder how they feel ?
<they> &-um they both feel sad or &-um mad that the frog went
mhm I bet they did .
so then the boy looked under the boot .
and he didn't find him .
and then he was really &-um sad or mad at the frog for getting out
<and then> and he was also sad .
the dog stuck his head in a jar I guess trying to be funny .
and the boy was <looking> looked under both boots and didn't
then the boy called out croaker where are you ?
and the dog tried to bark .
but <it> <it> it just wouldn't break the glass .
so then the dog jumped out by accident and crashed his head on the
and the jar broke .
then the boy felt mad at the dog also because he jumped out .
then once again he yelled croaker where are you ?
and the dog just looked up and barked .
and there were bees swarming by beside them .
the dog was jumping up trying to knock down the bees when the boy
then a weasel popped up .
and he's like <wrong> uhoh wrong place .
and &-um the dog was now trying to climb up the tree to hit the bee
I'm wondering why do you suppose his hand is there on his nose like
maybe it had some sort of odor or something like that ?
that could be why .
then the dog finally does knock down the bee hive while the boy is
the dog is barking or yelping for help .
and &-um the boy is feeling where in the heck could this frog have
then <he> a owl comes out_of the hole .
so he falls down while the bees go swarming by after the dog .
the dog's still barking .
<a bird swarm> a bird flies by .
and he hasta duck .
and he's like where has this frog gone ?
he's causing so much trouble .
so then he climbs on a rock and holds onto a stick he thinks .
and an owl's peering out at him .
he yells croaker again .
but then he finds out the stick is a moose .
and he's like uhoh some more trouble .
and now the moose is chasing the dog .
and the boy is on the moose's head .
&-um <the moose bust> the moose must not even notice that the
so then he stops at the edge of the cliff .
both the dog and the boy fall out yelling for help .
they land into the water with the dog landing right on his stomach
then they thought they heard a croak .
the boy tells the dog to be quiet .
and then they climb over the log .
and they see <two little> two frogs .
one of them their own frog .
<then then> then the boy looked and said hey look at all the
and the dog was looking at all of the little frogs .
how do you think he feels from the look on his face ?
he probably felt happy because the frog was happy .
and then he said bye because he knew the frog was happy and he
and the dog barked bye if a dog could have .
and <he> the dog looks .
he was smiling too on his way home .
that was a great story
