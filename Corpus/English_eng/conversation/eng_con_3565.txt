one night there was a boy who had a frog .
one night the frog snuck out_of his bowl .
the next day <he was> he looked in his bowl .
and the frog was gone .
he looked in his boot .
he looked almost everywhere in his room .
then he looked out the window .
didn't see him there .
then he yelled outside frog where are you ?
they looked in a rabbit hole .
not there .
he screamed it into the <squirhole I mean> squirrel hole .
not there .
but guess who was there .
an owl .
he pushed him out .
he put his head against this xxx to block the owl from scratching
he got saved by a deer .
and then he went tramping off .
+" whee !
+" uhoh .

and the boy fell off and his dog right into the water .
he smiled said ssh there's a log right there .
