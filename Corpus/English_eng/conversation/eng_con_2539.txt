maybe I'll take this opportunity while the &-uh light bulb is getting changed to &-um welcome you all on behalf of the Environmental Faculty Steering Committee to the last of this &~semi &-uh this semester's seminars in the series Research in the Interest of the Public and the Environment .
this is a series that is about environmental challenges and their interdisciplinary &~s solutions from the perspective of faculty and students at the University of Michigan .
the seminar series is sponsored by the Office of the Vice President for Research and the Urban Environmental Management Institute .
before I &-uh mention today's speakers and their title let me say that this seminar series will continue into the next term .
the first of the seminars next term will be January thirteenth that's also a Thursday afternoon the seminars next term will run from four to six instead of from three to five .
they will all be held in the Michigan League &-uh not all in the same room but all in &-um one of two of the nice seminar rooms over there and we will have a &-um a schedule set by the time of the first meeting .
and the first &-uh seminar next semester will feature a group of faculty and &-uh graduate students who are designing an energy track for the University of &~Mini Michigan that will involve collaboration among about half a dozen units across campus .
by an energy track I mean a program in research and education at all levels and outreach .
it focuses on the sources uses of energy alternative energies the problems created by energy use for both technologies and for society .
so this is a very interesting &-um subject that has been the &~s &-uh that has been the focus of several informal meetings over this fall and we'll hear about that &~f &-uh for we'll hear about that in January .
today we have &-uh this the theme of sustaining agriculture and our speakers are John Vandermeer of the Department of Biology and Ivette Perfecto of the School of Natural Resources and Environment .
the title of their talk is Challenging Old Assumptions about Agriculture and Finding the Ecological Bases for New Forms of Production .
okay thank you Katherine .
&-um what we plan to do here +//.
I don't know if I can get out_of the way of this or not .
but what we plan to do here is &-uh I'll talk for a little bit &-um about sort of the underlying theoretical framework that we think we're operating under here and then when I finish that +//.
that'll just be about five minutes or so .
and then I'll talk about the work that we're doing in Nicaragua .
and when I finish talking about the work that we're doing in Nicaragua why Ivette will talk about the work that we're doing in Mexico .
and then finally when &~fe she finishes why I'll come back up here talk &-uh &-um a little bit &~s more reflective about how the &-uh theoretical framework fits into the work that we're doing and we'll be planning to do in the future and how other people might be might &~b &-uh be wanting to join us okay ?
so first of all I guess the first thing that we have to talk about is why agriculture at the University of Michigan .
the University of Michigan is an ivory tower school &-uh it's not Michigan State we're not the cow college obviously we really shouldn't be doing agriculture .
&-um and so we have to justify that to some extent I suppose &-um besides the fact that most of the terrestrial surface of the earth is agroecosystem whether &~y people like to admit that or not &-um the truth is that the modern agricultural system when I talk about the modern agricultural system I'm principally talking about the agricultural system that has evolved since World War Two .
&-uh that &~agri modern agricultural system has been in fact and and everyone hasta admit it cornucopian I mean we now produce more than enough food for every person &~a way more than enough food for everyone in the world .
as a matter of fact the principle problem with agriculture right now is &~over overproduction &-um so it has been cornucopian and in that sense very successful but successful in very narrow terms .
along with that success has come kind_of a Faustian bargain that people are beginning to realize now or a_lot_of lot of people are realizing &-uh strongly at the present time and that Faustian &~ba bargain hasta do with the problems that agricultural is &~cau &-er agriculture is causing .
this is first highlighted by Rachel Carson in her book Silent Spring .
which is sometimes sometimes cited as the &-uh the beginning of the modern environmental movement and you'll recall that that book was mainly about agriculture as a matter of fact about pesticides .
and more recently we have been seeing the human use .
and second of all we need to get away from this narrow traditional &-uh this narrow technical specialization where &-uh people are cubbyholed into their particular disciplinary units .
and we have to get out +//.
agroecosystems involve all sorts of different disciplines and so by very by its very nature the ecological approach to studying &~agro agroecosystems is going to be and needs to be by the very nature a interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary &-uh approach .
so this this focus that we're we're trying to develop here is an ecological focus where we're looking at &~agricul &~agri an agricultural an &~agroecol an ecological approach to agroecosystems at multiple scales in multiple disciplines .
okay ?
that's the background .
now let me show you some slides to talk about the Nicaragua work that we've been doing and I will definitely &~n need the lights out as &~ne as much as I can get because my slides will not withstand a_lot_of light pollution .
no I think we ⌈ should ⌉ +/.
+, in the Peten in Guatemala with a very similar project actually it's a paired project to the project that we're working on in Nicaragua but I won't say anything about the the Peten site today .
and then in addition to that where Ivette will talk about is the work that we're doing up here in the highlands of Chiapas in in Mexico .
next slide .
&-uh this is in the &-uh National Geographic map that was published several years ago of the of forest cover in Native American lands in Central America .
and I just wanted to show you in the to put this whole thing in context this is Nicaragua and as you can see the Pacific side or the western side of Nicaragua is almost entirely deforested .
and as you move from the Pacific side to the Atlantic side why you get more and more forest although it's &~ve highly fragmented forest of_course as you can see .
once you get on the eastern side you see there's a big chunk of forest here this is the Indio_Maiz Reserve and a big chunk of forest here in the Uaxactún Reserve and and &-uh well and nonpreserved they're just rain forests here okay ?
but what you also can see is that the agricultural frontier is pushing in through here and it's kinda cut through the forest right here .
we work in general in this area right here .
next slide .
the context of the work oh excuse_me I did wanna show you some aerial photographs to give you an idea of the overall landscape .
the landscape itself is very is &~r really quite heterogenous .
this is &-uh this particular slide here is of a meandering &-uh meandering river meandering through swamp forest .
this is all forest here but it's swamp forest and then herbaceous swamp that's in through here .
this is pretty much natural vegetation which has not been &-uh too &-uh influenced by Homo_Sapiens other than some sort of traditional agricultural &-uh agricultural rice production that goes on in the swamp areas .
next slide .
&-uh many areas that &~y &-uh that you find around there &-uh in &~th in the area are pretty much continuous forest .
this forest was damaged by the hurricane in nineteen eighty eight which I'll tell you about in just a moment but you do see landscapes like this .
the next slide &-uh shows you &-uh a much more common type of landscape you see natural forest here but then you see a patch of agriculture &-uh a patch of forest that has been cut down ready for slash and burn agriculture here .
here's a patch that's been in agriculture and may have been abandoned I really don't know .
but &-uh you you see this kind of mosaic there next slide .
&-uh and this is a very common feature here you see forest in the background and cattle pasture in here .
not very good cattle pasture but cattle pasture next slide .
&-uh and here you see the mosaic of a combination of forest and cattle pastures .
&-uh much of this forest is sort_of riparian forest others of this is highland forest but also much of this is agroecosystem you can't really tell that it's agroecosystem which is part of the point which I'll get to in just a moment .
next slide ?
&-uh &-uh historically the area has been not nearly as important agriculturally &~a as it has been as &-uh for forestry .
and &-uh wood gets a variety of uses sort_of the &~artis &~ar &~ar artisanal uses of wood &-uh making canoes which is the only means of transport in the area .
there are no roads in the area it's all by water .
next slide .
and here is &-uh a a family wood production system .
I mean they just &-uh <these are> these are crude boards cut with a chain saw like that cut with a chain saw and they're for sale on the side of the river here .
and if you want some boards to build a house with why you come up here with your dug out canoe and and you buy them from the person who lives in that house .
and in addition you can see these bags of charcoal also are here are displayed here in this very nice &-uh Kmart type fashion &=laughs:multiple for anybody who wants to buy a bag of charcoal .
&-uh next slide shows we do &~indis in in &~a in addition we do have your sort_of garden variety of clear cutting &-uh so there is some extensive forest cutting going on although the present time &-um at the present time that's sort_of stagnated because of &-uh a lack of organizational &-uh efficiency I would say .
next slide ?
&-uh the the &~ar the the natural vegetation of the area is tropical rain forest .
and indeed it's very it's a &~beau beautiful tropical rain forest no question about it .
it's highly diverse although not nearly as diverse as the upper Amazon in Ecuador but it still is very diverse and there's no doubt about it .
I don't hafta go through the &~thr though the litany of all of the things that are important about it .
&-uh it's important aesthetically it's important in terms of its biodiversity .
there's undoubtedly somewhere in here there's a compound which will provide us with a cure for cancer for AIDS for anything else you like .
okay ?
and of_course it also is being chopped down as most tropical rain forests in the world are being chopped down .
&-uh the next slide shows just very briefly the next slide please miss ?
&-uh &-um &-um this is the reason that we originally started working there .
in nineteen eighty nine Hurricane Joan came through the area and turned that tropical rain forest into a &~la &-uh a landscape more or less like this .
that is there was complete devastation .
and what &-um there the &~uric hurricane hit in October of nineteen eighty eight in February of nineteen eighty nine we went down there to do an assessment of the damage that the hurricane had done .
and the next slide shows the kind of thing that we found and the important thing about this slide to note about this slide is that &-uh these are very very damaged trees but they're not dead trees and that's really the whole point of it .
they're resprouting these are all resprouts here .
this is a palm leaf that has resprouted in four months .
these are all resprouts coming out_of these trees all every single one of these trees that you see here has resprouts coming out_of it .
and basically the forest had a tremendous &-uh capability for rejuvenating itself after this extensive damage .
that led us to ask the question about how damage or what we call in ecology perturbation &-uh what perturbation or disturbance <how that> how that &-uh affects the natural processes of &-uh &~biolo of of the ecological functioning of the system basically for those of you who know ecological succession okay ?
and &-uh we've been working on that now for about ten years .
but that's just the background for why we're working &-uh there .
now the results of these studies looking at this perturbation or this damage that's caused by a natural event the hurricane .
which by the way hits this area about once every hundred years according to what we can figure out from the historical record .
and from the point of view of a rain forest of_course once every hundred years is actually quite frequent .
okay ?
so the rain forest naturally as you would expect has kind of adapted to be responsive to this kind_of a damage event .
now the question arises what about other kinds of damage events that you might have there ?
like for example agriculture .
from the point of view of a rain forest agriculture is a damage event .
for us from the point of view of &~w of us &~a agriculture is something that we do to try and produce something that we can eat or wear .
but from the point of view of a forest agriculture is a damage event .
so the idea is to ask to what extent is the damage event caused by agriculture similar to the kind of damage event that's caused by the hurricane ?
can we make any predictions at all can we gain any insight about what's gonna happen to the forest after agriculture compared to what happened to the forest after the hurricane ?
now in a sense this seems like sort_of a silly thing to do I know because agriculture is not a natural damage event or anything like that .
the real point here is that agriculture is not permanent .
okay ?
in contrary to what an awful lot of sort_of preservation minded conservation people would like to think that once the rain forest is gone it's gone forever that really isn't true .
that rain forests do as a matter of fact come back and the question of how they come back is a very important questern question for the future .
and the one thing I always like to cite is that one tropical country that everybody knows of in the world that has had in the past thirty years has had an actual increase in cover of forest &-uh the only one in the world everybody knows what that is right ?
+, ⌊ <United States> ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ huh ⌉ ?
+, tropical country that has had an increase in forest cover in the past thirty years ?
+, Costa Rica ?
+, no Costa Rica has had one of the highest rates of deforestation .
+, Sri Lanka ?
+, no unhunh this is good keep guessing .
I &~do I don't have time to let you guess until you go through all the countries .
and I guarantee you won't get it .
it's Puerto Rico as a matter of fact .
and there's a pretty obvious reason why okay ?
and the reason is that Puerto Rico went through its industrialization program .
I don't want to defend its industrialization program especially in front of Ivette .
&-um but &-uh it did in fact go through an industrialization program and people just left the countryside .
and so the notion of a Puerto Rican landless peasant looking for a piece of land to form a farm on is pretty silly for anybody <who knows> who knows anything about Puerto Rico .
so the whole industrial &~fr &-uh &-uh the industrial program in the fifties in &~th in Puerto Rico caused people to move into the cities caused &-uh caused basically caused development albeit the fairly &-uh unequal and sort_of distorted form of development .
but people left the countryside and indeed the forest came back and it's still coming back and we have much more forest cover in Puerto Rico than we did thirty years ago .
+, is any of this &-uh protected reserve ?
+, no no that's not a the the the well no excuse_me I shouldn't say none of it is protected reserve some of it is yeah but that really isn't the major part of it .
the major part of it is well I don't wanna tell you what the major part of it is because it'll give away what I'm gonna say next +/.
+, okay .
+, okay ?
&=laughs:S2 &=laughs:multiple so &-um the the logic of what we're trying to do here is that you know when we're thinking of forests we're thinking of long term things .
and we're thinking of landscapes we're thinking of long term things .
and so agriculture isn't forever .
it really isn't .
and we don't know what's gonna happen either in the Peten in Guatamala or in Nicaragua who knows they might industrialize soon I doubt it .
but they might .
&-uh who knows we might even have the kind of government which will permit us to plan land use better than the current governments do .
but when any of that happens it will be useful for us to know what as a matter of fact are the processes that happen in the post disturbance phase of forest recuperation when the disturbance is agriculture itself .
now it's not just agriculture there's agriculture and there's agriculture there's a variety of different kinds of agriculture that occur in the region that was that's the rationale for the project .
let me just go quickly through the types of agriculture that there are in the region .
next slide ?
&-uh first off I &~hav all we have your your your standard sort_of slash and burn agriculture where you cut the forest down next slide you set it on fire next slide it burns next slide &~t try to get (th)em in focus before I say next slide &=laughs:multiple it might not be easy .
&-uh so you have <your nice> &-um your nice burned area and the next slide and then you &-uh in this burnt area why you have this wonderful ash here which is really rich with nutrients .
the next slide you take and you plant your corn and beans in in the case of Central America usually or some other crop you plant that right into the ash the next slide &-uh shows you <your little> your little plants coming up through this wonderfully nutrient rich ash the next slide then shows the kind of production you can get out_of this &-uh the first year at least .
now this is not a small person .
this person is six feet tall .
okay ?
and this is the corn that you get out_of there that's the first year of work in production in a slash and burn system .
which is very very high production .
however the soils are of the type as probably most of you have heard they don't have a great nutrient holding capacity to them so the first rain &~sea rainy season comes and the nutrients all either flow out or flow down to the deeper levels and the second year you might get a cornfield that looks like this .
which you can see that there's a difference there and the next year something sorta like this .
and at that point what do you do ?
and at this point the nutrients are all leeched out_of the system the weeds are all coming into the system the pests are all coming into the system and you're not left with much left to do but migrate on to a different place .
this is the classic migratory slash and burn agriculture and this is really quite common in the area that we work .
it's very complicated but it's common .
okay that's one kind of agriculture .
second we have &-uh at the other extreme actually we have a very modern form of agriculture .
this is a sugar cane field .
this is a very very monotonous &-uh highly chemicalized form of agriculture .
this is what we're referring to as intensive agriculture .
this is the closest we have to what you would call the modern model of agriculture with large amounts of &-uh chemical fertilizer and chemical pesticides applied to the system next slide .
in addition there's a sociological component to the whole thing sociological economic component to the whole thing .
these are Miskito Indians that migrate into the area every year to cut the cane by hand .
okay another very important component of the whole process .
&-uh so that's the second kind of agriculture .
&~f first of all you have slash and burn then you have &-uh intensive agriculture .
next slide thirdly you have cattle pastures the famous cattle pastures <that are> that are eating away into the rain forest .
&-uh next slide shows a &-uh cattle pasture that we're working in .
these cattle pastures tend to be highly degraded .
they tend to &~gr degrade fairly rapidly once they're set up as cattle pastures .
that's the third kind of agriculture .
and then fourth well I'm standing in a cattle pasture right here and I'm taking a picture of this .
well &-uh that sort of looks like you know a &~sec second growth forest or something like that well the point is that that is itself that is also an agroecosystem .
okay ?
that is a traditional agroforestry agroecosystem .
the next slide shows a slide from inside here .
&-uh and as you can see there's a coconut tree here there's &-uh this is actually a a timber tree that was planted .
another timber tree that was planted there's fruit trees all over the place next slide shows a component of this system .
this is the owner of the farm his name is Daniel Daniel Cuthbert .
and &-um and well one of the things that you have to do when you visit his farm is you have to eat coconuts and he's up there cutting coconuts down for us another sociological component of all of this .
next slide shows a &~p piece of the farm &-uh in what you might might call a a light gap inside of the farm where you have this kind of production .
that's not really a crop but this is &-uh for those of you who know the terminology this is a buen@s:fra monte@s:fra actually .
this is what he calls a good weed .
this is Heliconia &-uh which sorta keeps out the bad weeds and when you chop this down when you plant corn and beans in here .
and then you let this go back to fallow after you do that .
that's just one component of the whole thing and you can see the coconut trees on either side of these coconut trees are in the process of growing up .
this field will not be a corn and bean fields after these things grow up but then some other part of the farm will .
so it's sort_of a little bit of shifting cultivation right within the farm itself .
okay ?
this is what we refer to as a traditional agroforestry system next slide shows another example .
&-uh here we have what's a combination of a pasture with fruit trees .
this is what's called a silvopastoral@n$adj system again a very traditional form of production in the area .
and you have all these fruit trees around here .
fruit trees and timber trees also .
and the cattle graze underneath them .
this is a system that's been in operation at this one site on these supposedly very bad soils for at least thirty years &-uh without any kind_of a rotation system going on at all .
mkay ?
so what we have are we have these four systems of agriculture we have the &~s traditional slash and burn .
we have the intensive agriculture the the sugar cane we have the cattle pastures .
and we have the traditional agroforestry systems .
now the &~i the idea of the research is to ask the question what happens when each of these types of agriculture is abandoned ?
does the same thing happen in all cases or is it the case as I strongly expect that this kind of system when abandoned would lead to a totally different process of forest regeneration than for example the sugar cane field will ?
and that's the context of the research .
I won't go into any more details about it because I wanna talk just a little bit before my time runs out here I wanna talk a little bit about some of the bigger &~con contextual elements of it .
and that hasta do with the sociopolitical aspects of what's going on in this region of Nicaragua and I will add that there're equal complexities in the place that we work in Guatemala also but I don't have time to go into those next slide ?
&-uh this is a a small fishing community on the coast and this is called Tasbapouni .
this is where the Miskito Indians live where some of the Miskito Indians live .
next slide shows &-uh <it's a> it's a it's actually a very very picturesque place looks like sort_of like paradise until you realize that there are crack addicts all over the place but that's another story .
next slide ?
&=laughs:multiple this is what they do for a living this is one of the things they do for a living .
this always gets conservationists really really upset .
but I must say that the dent that the Miskito Indians make into the sea turtles is far far far less than the dent that the WTO is making into them .
next slide ?
I hadta get something about the WTO into this talk of_course .
this is Raulston he's a Miskito Indian .
what I'm really talking about here is I'm talking about the ethnic complexity of the area .
okay ?
&-uh the Miskito Indians constitute a a a small but very significant minority of the people in the southern Atlantic region where we work .
they fish .
and they do forestry .
they do some agriculture also .
but it's mainly fishing and forestry that they do .
and this slide I can't tell the whole story here but this is a this is a woman who is cutting this forest down .
and this forest belongs to the Tasbapouni people &-uh traditionally belongs the the Tasbapouni people .
and here Raulston is having a &~in fairly intense debate with the people who are cutting it down &-uh about whether or not they should be cutting it down .
next slide ?
&-uh this is another ethnic group this is perhaps the most common ethnic group about about forty five percent of the population .
these are Creole people &-uh they speak English oh the Miskitos by the way speak &-uh mainly Miskito but also Spanish and some English .
this is the Creole population their first language is English but they mainly speak Spanish also .
<this is> &-uh this is Miss Mora which is one who is one of the farmers who we worked with and this is her grandbaby .
this is &-uh Branchinski .
next slide ?
&-uh these are more kids these are kids from Pearl Lagoon which is another Creole community in the area .
now the Creoles are fisher people .
they also work on boats that &-uh &-uh that're are what do you call that a merchant marine type thing and they're also farmers .
&-uh they're not the most common farmers in the area but they are the most common traditional farmers in the area .
next slide ?
&-uh this is the &~th &~th this is the next most common ethnic group .
probably &~anothe another approximately forty five percent .
&-uh these are the Mestizos .
these people are of mixed blood usually Spanish and Native American of some sort .
this is Lorena and &-uh her husband &-uh Don Sergio and these are their three kids .
these are the people that we work with in one of our farms also .
next slide ?
&-uh and this is the community at &~o another one of our sites the Fonseca sites for those of you who know the sites .
again these are Mestizo people .
so you have basically these three major ethnic groups the Miskito Indians who speak Miskito the Creoles who speak English and the Mestizos who speak Spanish in addition to that next slide we have some smaller groups .
&-uh excuse_me this is another Mestizo kid this is I can't remember his name but he lives on one &~o he lives at one of the farms we work on also .
next slide ?
&-uh these this is a small group of Native Americans these are the Rama Indians &-uh there're several small communities very near to where we work we don't work directly with any of the Rama Indians though .
next slide ?
&-uh and this is a group of a &-uh a very curious cultural group a really interesting cultural group the Garifuna &-uh these are the people that &-uh were escaped slaves from French colonialism .
and &-uh they've &~devel devised their entire their own culture in Central America .
they're mainly concentrated in Belize but they also have major communities on Honduras and two small communities in Nicaragua .
&-uh we don't work very we don't work with them either but &-uh they're in the area .
next slide shows there's just another another Garifuna a Garifuna girl that I thought was kind_of a nice slide .
okay the next slide shows you &-um a &~th this is &~s symbolic of the kinds of things that we face here .
this was &~an what they call an almendro tree a Dipteryx &~pana Panamensis and this tree was was as you can see it was burnt here right ?
this tree was a traditional individual tree that Miss Mora and her husband Mister_Cloide gathered fruits from every year .
they gathered the fruits from this tree every year .
and they use the fruits <to make> &-uh to make a juice and they use the well they &~ju use the fruits for a variety of things .
so this is a tree in the natural forest that they traditionally used .
now a Mestizo family migrating in from the Pacific side remember that's where I told you where most of the people were a Mestizo family migrating in from the Pacific side decided that this would make great charcoal .
so this is the way they kill this tree so that it falls down so they can chop it up and make charcoal out_of it .
and the reason I'm telling you that story and I could have told you a variety of other stories there's tremendous ethnic tensions that are happening right now on the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua .
the Mestizos against <the Miskitos> the Miskitos against <the Creoles> the Creoles against the &~Mes the against the Mestizos .
and this is symbolic of what's happening there .
that's part of the whole story .
&-um that's part of the whole context within this &~resear within which this research is happening .
and finally the next slide &-uh once again the slide of Nicaragua pointing out the difference between the Pacific coast and the Atlantic coast we work on the Atlantic coast which is where rain forests are it's dry on the Pacific coast and which is where most of the people live .
now traditionally there have been &-uh incredible antagonisms between the people on the Atlantic coast and the rest of Nicaragua because the people on the Atlantic coast are Native Americans and Creoles for the most part and Mestizos who have lived there all their life .
they regard themselves as a different culture .
they refer to themselves as Costeños@s:fra or coast people and they refer to the people on the Pacific side as a matter of fact they refer to them as the Spaniards .
and so there's a tremendous division between the Atlantic coast and the Pacific coast .
and because of the neoliberal model that has been imposed on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua through <their current> &-um their current administration &-uh there's enormous pressure for peasants who used to have their own land here but now are being kicked off their land because of this new model .
and the only place that they can go is to the Atlantic coast .
so you have new Mestizos coming into the Atlantic coast and doing things like burning the almendro trees and that is creating all sorts of new ethnic tensions .
the historical division really is between the coast and the Pacific side .
the new divisions are amongst the various ethnic groups .
so that's the overall context that's the research project that we're doing &-um and now I'll turn it over to Ivette .
(0.5) .
okay I think I need to change the is can you change that for me ?
okay well you can see now or begin to see that our more general theme &~a of both &-uh John's research and my research is related to the interaction between agriculture and natural areas or between agricultural activities and conservation activities .
and that is illustrated also with this other project .
can I have are you okay with doing this ?
yeah .
I'll do it .
+, okay .
well I think that when we look at agriculture &~e from an ecological perspective one of the main thing that we have to do is figure out what's there .
what organisms live there and what are their function and this is a spider of_course which is a an important predator in many agricultural systems .
can I have the next one ?
&-uh when we think about agriculture I think if if I asked you to envision an agricultural system most of you are gonna envision something like this .
primarily intensive agricultural production monoculture &-um very very &-uh low diversity of &-uh crops and something pretty much like this .
however there are many system many agricultural systems that are highly diverse .
next one ?
and one of them &-uh is the the system that John called slash and burn agriculture I call shifting cultivation .
and shifting cultivation &-um <is a> is a very important system that is practiced .
I think there's about half a million people in the world half a billion people in the world still practice this type of agricultural system .
it's one of the main agricultural systems &-uh and it covers about &-um between three hundred and four hundred million hectares in this kind of system .
this is a the kind of system that is very dynamic because after like John mentioned before you have this kind of agriculture going on but it cannot go goes on continuously after a few years it gets abandoned and then you &~le &~lea let it fallow for &-um anywhere from two three to forty years depending on on the region where you are .
okay so you have this kind of system you have &-um other type of systems like like &-uh this is an agroforestry system similar to the one that John show you before .
very diverse type of systems .
next one ?
so my approach or our approach in &-uh studying biodiversity in agroecosystem is to look at biodiversity as having two main components .
one is the planned biodiversity and that's basically the crops .
that is the &-uh the the things that the farmer include in the agroecosystem intentionally .
and the other one is the associated biodiversity .
those are the things &-uh that live there because the planned biodiversity creates the conditions for those other organisms to live there .
those are the spiders those are &-uh the microorganisms in the soil etcetera etcetera .
both of this type of &-uh components of biodiversity promote the functioning of the agroecosystem .
and I think that in agroecosystem the &-uh functioning when we talk about the functioning of agroecosystem it's actually makes more it actually make more sense than in a natural system because you know &~what <what the> &~fun what the function should be .
and &-uh in this particular case for example pest &-uh the pest dynamics nutrient cycling even including some of the other &-uh aspects of an agroecosystem socioeconomic aspects of agroecosystem like market &-uh efficiency or risk immunization and that kind of of &-uh functioning .
can I have the next one ?
so most conservationists more most conservation biologists when they look at agroecosystem or when they think of agroecosystem &-uh they pretty much a_lot_of the literature assumes that the loss of diversity within the intensification of agroecosystem is something like this .
that there's a dramatic decrease in biodiversity as agroecosystems get intensified .
or as you transform a forest or a natural area into an &~a &~a an agriculture area .
however there are very few studies that have look at the loss of biodiversity in different type of agroecosystem comparing them with the forest or the natural vegetation that used to be there before and we can have +//.
these are four possibilities of the way biodiversity is lost with the intensification of of agriculture and the main idea here is that we really don't know how biodiversity is lost .
and the other thing is that possibly many different organisms or different organisms in different taxa are &-uh reacting &~di are gonna respond differently to the disturbance or to the intensification of the agroecosystem .
can I have the next one ?
okay &~so that's what brings me to the case study that we are &-uh studying .
and that is coffee .
&-uh why study coffee ?
well next one ?
I'm used to doing it .
&=laughs:S3 well coffee is a very interesting crop .
let's call it a crop .
it's a very interesting crop because in its traditional form it's cultivated in an agroforestry system .
very very diverse system with a_lot_of trees that are used as shade trees .
coffee originally was &-uh domesticated from the understory of &-uh upland forest and when it began to be grown &-um and domesticated it was grown under the canopy of trees .
so you have this very diverse systems can I have the next one ?
and one of the most important thing related to coffee is not that much the extension of land that is cover with coffee plantations like the one you saw before but the actual location of specifically coffee Coffea_Arabica which is one of the main &-uh species of coffee that is cultivated .
and this is &-uh what is called café@s:fra altura@s:fra or coffee that grows in the highlands .
and in Mexico for example this is southern Mexico .
&-uh and this here are these areas here the dark areas represent areas that the &-uh CONABIO which is the the conservation agency in &-uh in Mexico have designated &~a as highly important for conservation purposes because they have a_lot_of endemic species or because they have a very high &~bi biological diversity .
those areas correspond this is a study that was done by <Movela Toledo> and they correspond pretty much to the main area where coffee is produced in Mexico .
so and many of these plantations that are distributed throughout this area are like the one that I show you before highly forested plantations that preserve or conserve a_lot_of the species that live in in &-um the conservation areas .
can I have the next one ?
another example of the importance of coffee you can find in El Salvador .
El Salvador is Central American country &-uh this is &-uh these are the coffee plantations the distribution of coffee plantations in El Salvador .
it turns &~out El Salvador is one of the most deforested countries in the world .
it turns out that the only practically the only forest that is left in El Salvador are coffee plantations .
about eighty five percent of all the forest what is classified as forest in El Salvador are the coffee plantations that are in production .
and &-uh the rest &-um of the forest was cut down long long time ago .
can I have <the next> the next slide ?
and that's why the proposal for the biological corridor which is a part of &-um &-uh Conservation International proposal to connect many areas conservation areas throughout Central America it basically includes the areas that are coffee plantations for El Salvador because there is very little natural forest that is left in this country except for the coffee plantations .
so these plantations the shaded plantations are very important &-uh for conservation purposes in many of the Central American countries .
next one ?
now &-uh this is not I couldn't find a slide of the disease that I wanted to show you but &-uh in the the in the nineteen fifties there was in Brazil there was a problem with coffee production because &-uh of a disease &-uh the the coffee rust that came from from Africa and started devastating coffee plantations there .
they started a breeding program to try to come up with varieties that were resistant to the coffee rust and they came up next one ?
next slide ?
they came up with &-uh varieties that were resistant to the coffee rust but then it turned out that actually coffee rust was not such a big problem after all .
&-uh at least for other countries .
but these new varieties of coffee had another characteristic as and and it was that they were high yielding varieties as well .
they yield much &~m they produced much higher yields than the traditional varieties but it was a whole technological package .
it's not just that they could be continued to be producing the same system they hadta change the whole production system .
and in the case of of &-uh Central America what they started doing was eliminating the trees the shade trees .
so <these are> &~tradition these are a &~eh high yielding varieties that produce much higher yields of coffee but then you have to eliminate or reduce significantly the amount of shade where this coffee is grown .
can I have the next one ?
and so it's a whole process of technification of what was called coffee technification started in Central America and Mexico and northern South America .
many plantations &-uh that looked like this now look like this .
they eliminated all the trees .
this is the most intensive type of transformation obviously .
but in Costa Rica for example a_lot_of the plantations about twenty years ago a_lot_of the coffee plantations used to look like the other slide I already showed you like a forest .
and now they look like this .
&-uh Costa Rica has really been has been one of the country that really intensify their plantations especially in the central valley which is the prime coffee growing region in Costa Rica .
Colombia was another country .
can I have the next slide ?
this also &-uh includes it's not just elimination of the trees or the reduction of the shade but also the application of a whole variety of &-uh agrochemicals .
&-uh fertilizers em em herbicides and insecticides etcetera .
can I have the next one ?
&-uh obviously you don't have just that those two systems that I show you before .
there's a whole gradient of different systems that you can find throughout Central America and &-um you know from the very rustic traditional plantations that have a very high diversity and dense shade to &-uh specialized shade .
these are not complete monocultures of of coffee .
but they have the their shade is just one species of tree and that's it .
and &-uh in this particular case they didn't included the monoculture because in Mexico they don't practice that that much .
you hardly ever see any monocultural plantations in Mexico .
but there's a whole gradient of different systems .
can I have the next one ?
okay so this is a technification of coffee in northern Latin America .
and you can see that &~i it has been a gradual process but &~e the countries that have really intensified a_lot_of their plantation have been Colombia primarily and and Costa Rica &-uh with a large percent about forty percent of their plantations .
but about ninety percent or eighty percent of their plantations in the central valley of Costa Rica were transformed to &-uh highly intensive coffee plantations .
&=slide_change thanks .
so given this context then &-uh obviously one of the things that we started asking us <what is> what is the impact of this on biodiversity .
what's happening with all this diversity ?
obviously we know that the planned biodiversity or the crop diversity is gonna be reduced dramatically in the case of those monocultural plantations from from like &~ele a hundred species of trees that were living in the system before to one species .
which is coffee only .
but also what's gonna happen to the associated biological diversity ?
can I have the next one ?
so we conducted +//.
just to find out what was there .
what's up there in those trees ?
that we are definitely gonna lose because you're eliminating those trees you're eliminating the habitat for those species .
so we started with a very simple &-um survey of trying to &~fi find out what's up there and we use a methodology that is used commonly for for studies of of arthropods in the canopy of forest because we wanted to compare our &-uh data with &-uh that of forested habitats in in the tropics as well .
so &~i basically you fog the canopy of the tree &-uh with an insecticide unfortunately &=laughs:S3 and then &-uh the insects start dropping here you collect them and and then you quantify them .
can I have the next one ?
okay and just to give you I won't go into the data that extensively but just to give you an idea of how dramatic this is in one single tree that we fog one single tree a relatively small tree a Erythrina_Poeppigeana which is one of the common shade trees in coffee plantations in Costa Rica .
we found thirty different species of ants three hundred thirty three individuals a hundred and twenty six different species of beetles living in the canopy of a single shade tree in a coffee plantation .
and &-uh a hundred and three different species of wasp mainly Microhymenopteras .
and then we fogged another individual of Erythrina in the same plantation about two hundred meters from from this one and we found twenty seven species of ants a hundred and ten species of beetles and sixty one species of wasp .
but the most impressive thing was also that the overlap of species &-uh between these two trees for example the beetles less than twenty percent overlap of species in these two trees so what are those things doing up there all these beetles most of them undescribed ?
&-uh we don't know .
&=laughs:S3 I mean it would take a lifetime to find out to figure out what's what's what are these things doing in the canopy of of these trees .
but what we do know is that you gonna lose all of those species &-um with this transformation <of the> of the agroecosystem of that agroecosystem .
can I have the next one ?
the next step then was to figure out well that happens we know that we're gonna lose all those species up there that are in the canopy .
what's gonna happen to species or to groups that are slightly more resistant or that that live in other areas that do not need the trees really &~w to nest or something like that ?
so we started looking at the ground foraging ant community .
&-uh they they nest in the ground they go up to plants and forage in the plants or forage in the ground so they shouldn't be that affected by by the transformation .
can I have the next one ?
this is just to give you the trend that we found .
these are different &~plan these these are different categories of plantation going from the monoculture to the more diverse plantations in different indices of diversity here .
and you can see that there was a significant increase in terms of biodiversity of ground foraging ants &-uh in these different plantations .
can I have the next one ?
but another thing that was important from our studies in Costa Rica was that even though on a plot basis let's say we do an &~anal a a a study of the ants that are in a particular plot seven by seven meters only .
and you find about ten to twelve species of ants in that plot .
in a system like this in a diverse agroforestry system every time you do that type of of &-uh sampling in a different plantation you also find more or less the same number of species of ants but they tend to be different species .
so the bed of diversity or or the the &-uh regional scale type of diversity the heterogeneity of &-uh of ants <in this> in this &~a area when you have traditional plantations or shaded plantation it's much higher than &-uh than than for the monoculture .
if you have can I have the next one ?
<in a> in a plantation like this we found on the average about four species in the using the same methodology four species per plot but every time they were the same species .
you go to this plantation and then you go three miles down the road to another plantation do the same dating the same thing happen &~sa more or less the same species .
so at the landscape level then the impact of transforming very diverse &-uh shaded plantations to monocultural plantations is is &-uh eh is very significant .
can I have the next one ?
okay so at the same time that we were doing that kind of study eh other people were studying other organisms in coffee plantations .
&-uh there were studies looking at &-um epiphytes in coffee plantation that found a very high diversity of epiphytes in shaded plantations .
the next one ?
and also &-uh birds .
there were studies that were looking at &-uh diversity of birds in shaded coffee plantation that that documented a very high diversity of birds in the shaded plantations .
and the next one ?
it was precisely birds that captured the imagination of of of the general public of_course being the charismatic fauna that they are .
&-uh it cause a_lot_of &-uh attention and in particular because the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center &-uh was doing some of these studies and the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center documented &~m primarily &-uh Russell Greenberg from the the Migratory Bird Center documented how important these plantations were for migratory birds that were coming &~f &-uh during the winter months .
and they in nineteen +//.
next one ?
in nineteen ninety six they &-um had a conference &-uh with several workshops and and one of the main one of the main &-uh purposes of this conference that the Migratory Bird they call it the the Sustainable Coffee Conference .
and one of the main purpose of the conference was to talk about this transformation that that was happening throughout central &-uh and northern Latin America and also to come up with some alternatives to try to maintain the plantations &-uh as shaded plantations rather or prevent that these plantations would be converted to &-uh coffee monoculture or their shade would be eliminated from the system .
and &-uh can I have the next one ?
out_of that conference came a whole series of of different &-um alternatives and one of them was &-uh this person who owned Thanksgiving Coffee .
he began marketing his &~cof he began visiting the farms where he was buying coffee from .
and &-uh basically marketing the the &-uh making sure that these were shaded plantations and then marketing the coffee as Songbird Coffee shade grown you can see here say shade grown coffee .
so this was <one of the> &~w one of the ideas that came out_of this conference was to look at the &-uh coffee market and try to to &-um eh stimulate the conservation of these shaded plantations through some market &-uh forces .
like for example trying to stimulate people to buy &-uh shaded coffee .
can I have the next one ?
and so a whole variety of different systems started to appear .
this is for example Eco_K which is the &~f Rainforest Alliance .
y@s:fra &-uh they develop a certification program .
they went a step further from Thanksgiving Coffee and they develop a certification program with a whole series of criterias that were based on the studies that have been done on biodiversity in in coffee .
&-uh that hadta do with the shade &-uh the height of trees the diversity of trees etcetera etcetera .
and they go to these plantations they check for those criterias if their plantation pass those criterias they give them &-uh a seal that is an Eco_K seal and then they sell it as shade coffee .
can I have the next one ?
the Smithsonian came up with their own &-uh idea and that was a basically they started a a venture with &-uh &~caf with &-uh the Audubon Society and they started also eh certifying coffee as shade grown coffee .
so these these were the main things that were coming out_of that conference essentially using these market forces to try to first of all &-uh <eh em> educate people about &-uh the way coffee is &-uh is being transformed and the impact that that has <on the> on biodiversity , primarily on birds in this particular case .
but also to try to promote &-uh the consumption of coffee that is shade grown bird friendly biodiversity friendly environmentally friendly or whatever you wanna call it .
next slide ?
&-um this is just I'm gonna go through these really fast but these are just some examples of of the kind of interest that all that has generated .
even here in Ann Arbor in your Caribou coffee shop you can see the rain forest blend coffee .
which also they they argue that this is coffee that is grown under shade trees and if you buy this coffee you're helping preserve biodiversity because it's shade grown .
and so eh I forgot can I have the next one so we have these these are the the shaded plantations .
&=laughs:S3 can I have the &~n &~c the next one I forgot what is oh okay &~th what I was going to say with this is that the one problem with this is that there &~ar there is shade and there is shade .
how can you tell that the plantation your &~co the coffee you're drinking is coming from that type of really you know very dense forest or if it's coming from something like this which also has shade .
I mean this can be certified depending on whether it's certified or not or whether this is a shaded plantation .
so the idea now is to try to fine tune a little bit more this issue of the shade and see well really what level of shade do you need to support higher levels of biological diversity .
and that's why we started +//.
how much time do I have now ?
you got about fifteen minutes .
fifteen minutes ?
okay so that's that's when we decided to that it was time to &-uh move on from Costa Rica and go to Mexico can I have the next one ?
and so we started this project in Mexico just about a year and a half ago .
and &-uh this is here is a map of Mexico we're in Chiapas which is the southern part of Mexico .
and &-uh and so this is the state of Chiapas .
and within Chiapas we're working &~i very close to the frontier with &-uh Guatemala here and so in this whole area which is called the Soconusco region is one of the primary coffee growing regions of Mexico .
now why go to Mexico ?
it's several reasons .
first of all it's one of the most &~impo coffee is one of the most important crops in Mexico .
it's the second &-uh most important &-uh generator of of &-uh of income in Mexico after petroleum .
&~ch coffee overall in the world is the second most traded &~como commodity after petroleum .
so <it's a> it's a very important economically it's a very very important crop .
and in Mexico it's extremely important and it has been very important for many years .
next one ?
it's also &-uh Mexico also didn't have a very strong program for technification .
so what you find in Mexico is a_lot_of areas that &-uh a_lot_of coffee plantations that are shaded plantations and also because the topography where coffee is grown at least in this region in in &-uh in Chiapas the topography is &-uh so steep that there are many areas that cannot be cultivated at all .
so you have a_lot_of fragments of forest distributed throughout the whole area throughout the whole coffee growing region .
things that &~wait some in some cases it's &-uh small fragments that are there to protect the watershed and in other cases it's just because it's it's just impossible to cultivate to because it's so steep .
people cannot get there to harvest the coffee so they just leave leave it in in the natural forest .
next one ?
in addition to that &-uh &~e about eighty percent of the coffee plantations of the coffee farms in Mexico are manage are small farms less than five hectares .
so if you develop a program that will benefit the producers it will tend to benefit more people if &-uh in Mexico than in other places like in El Salvador that's &-uh there are a_lot_of large producers .
and also about sixty percent of the population in &~Mex &~in that produces coffee in Mexico are indigenous people as well .
can I have &-uh the next one ?
the other thing &-uh important about Mexico is that they have the most important market of organic coffee .
and most of these these are the different organic coffee cooperatives .
they are all cooperatives .
primarily of indigenous people that have organized themself and they have develop strategies to market their coffee directly .
because in most cases you market your coffee through intermediaries .
and so the farmer the producer ends up receiving a very miniscule part of &-uh what the what what you pay here for a cup of coffee .
&-uh in Mexico for a whole variety of reasons people have organized really well .
producers have organized really well and have taken advantage of the &-uh increase in the organic market and <they are> they are marketing their coffee as organic coffee and they have these cooperatives that have become very very &~efi efficient .
and so you already have kind of an infrastructure there social infrastructure that could help if you're trying to in addition to do organic coffee .
do something like shade grown coffee certified shade grown coffee that people will receive a higher price for their production .
can I have the next one ?
and another thing that attract us to to Mexico of_course was &-uh that as you know in nineteen ninety four there was a eh an insurrection of &-uh indigenous people there the Zapatista insurrection .
this is a poster in San_Cristobal_De_Las_Casas that say el@s:fra mundo@s:fra que@s:fra queremos@s:fra es@s:fra un@s:fra mundo@s:fra que@s:fra quepan@s:fra en@s:fra donde@s:fra quepan@s:fra muchos@s:fra mundos@s:fra the the world that we want is a world in which many worlds can fit .
is that +/.
mhm .
+, good translation ?
so the &-uh and then eh can I have the next one ?
many &-uh coffee had been a very important crop also for the Zapatistas for indigenous people that are within &~these these regions that are now autonomous region autonomous &-uh Zapatistas region .
this is &-uh coffee that you can actually buy on the internet .
the web it's called Cafe &-uh Cafe eh Zapatista and they are +//.
at the beginning they didn't mention anything about shade and now you read the literature and one of the things they mention is that this is shade grown coffee produced by small producers in &-uh in the autonomous regions .
so this is +//.
with all this good thing going on in Mexico we decided to go there .
&=laughs and this is &-uh a few a subgroup of the group that's been working there this is John &-uh myself Jay West from the Biology Department and Dan Griffith from the Biology Department and Alex Mas from &-uh the School of Natural Resources .
next one ?
so just very briefly &-uh what we have decided to do now is to study different taxon as I mention before we we're interested in looking at the loss of biodiversity in the different with the intensification of the system .
and but one thing that we would really like &~s to to look at is how different organisms in different taxas eh respond to that intensification .
so we &-uh &~s we did some studies with butterflies next one ?
with ants of_course which is what I work and with birds .
and this is Tom Dietsch who is also another one of &-uh eh he is a graduate student here that's doing +//.
he's right now in Mexico doing some work with &-uh birds in coffee plantations .
so it's I <I don't have> &-uh I won't get into the details of what we have found up to now except that basically we're seeing the same trend going from forest a natural forest habitat to a more intensive coffee plantation .
<we have> we have four different system the &-um the forest a forest reserve for example next one eh &~dr eh rustic coffee plantation like this one this is a coffee plantation eh a less less shaded plantation like these two like this one but organic and the next one &-uh also a less shaded plantation but &-uh that is not organic .
so we have those four levels &-uh of of habitats let's say and we have been monitoring the butterflies ants and birds in the system &-uh and &-um we started also doing small mammals as well this year .
and so basically &-uh we see the same trend in terms of the decrease in biodiversity with the intensification of the system but each of these taxon respond completely different .
one of the thing that we're noticing is that for example ants seem to be very very robust .
they seem to resist disturbance much more than things like butterflies for example .
and so the response in if if you remember the curves of loss of biodiversity that I had showed you before the response of the butterflies is like that and the response of the ants is like that .
so they respond very different and <these are> these are being &-uh sampled in exactly the same plots in the same farms .
can I have the next one ?
and so the other thing that we are just beginning to look at is the the &-um role of these small fragments of forest .
because as I mentioned before in this region &-uh you have the whole region with a_lot_of &~s small fragments of forest .
we're talking about ten fifteen hectares of forest &-uh that are scattered throughout the whole landscape the agricultural landscape .
so what is the role of &-uh these fragments of forest in preserving biological diversity .
and &~what what is the role of the agricultural matrix matrix in which these &-uh these fragments are embedded .
and in this particular region the agricultural matrix consists of coffee plantations that's that's what's grown there .
so we're talking about these fragments of of forest surrounded by coffee plantations .
and we have different qualities of these matrices .
can I have the next one ?
so for example we started a study in Finca Irlanda which is an organic farm fairly shaded plantation that has eh eh forest a small forest fragment &-uh I think well you cannot see the forest fragment from here can I have the next one ?
and <this is> this is a map of Finca Irlanda .
the the plantation that you just saw is in this side here .
and this is <a small> &-um a small forest fragment that .
that's all Finca Irlanda ?
this is all Finca Irlanda this is a small &~fo this &~i I'm sorry this is all Finca Irlanda here &-uh and this is here is a small forest fragment .
there's another forest fragment here .
and so what we're doing what we did last summer was to sample the ants in the forest and then also sample ants a different distance from the fragment in Finca Irlanda which is what we consider high quality matrix because it has a_lot_of trees very diverse very dense shade .
and then in the other side of the forest fragment there's another plantation which have a much lower density of shade trees and is a much more intensive plantation .
so we're looking at at a very small scale we're trying to look at these landscape level phenomenons .
can I have the next one ?
and so we have for example this is the reserve it's about fifteen hectare &-uh big and then these are the plots that &~we where we sample the ants inside the reserve in Finca Hamburgo which is more intensive and in Finca Irlanda which is less intensive .
and just to give you some preliminary results here all the black dots are Finca Irlanda and all the white dots are Finca Hamburgo and there is a significant difference in terms of &-uh the diversity that you find but also there is a significant decrease in diversity as you go away from the forest .
this is distance from the forest .
so as you go away from the forest in Finca Irlanda you have a significant &-uh decrease .
&-uh Finca Irlanda is what we're considering the high quality matrix .
and they the difference was not significant or the the regression was not significant for for the other farm but that's because the drop occurs at very close distance from the forest .
so you really have and we actually had some some &-uh very small scale plots looking at the drop of diversity as you get out_of the away from the forest just <the first> the first &-uh &~fif &-uh twenty meters or fifty meters or I can't remember .
but anyway you you do see a very dramatic drop right at the beginning and then everything stays more or less the same .
so that's that's one of the thing that we're beginning to look at .
we're trying to get a grasp at the landscape level issues as well .
&-uh because if you're start looking at just you know the diversity in the farm you're missing a big part of of what's going on in terms of preservation of biodiversity at least in this region .
can I have the next one ?
the next phase of the project is looking at the function of that diversity .
what are these things doing in the coffee plantation .
and that's gonna be for the next three years I think that's what we gonna be doing primarily is looking at &-uh in particular the effect of birds the diversity and density of birds most of them &-uh many of them that are &-uh herbivores and the diversity and density of ants and spiders .
what impact do they have on the herbivores of coffee ?
so that's that's gonna be the next stage in in this research and next one ?
oh <these are> these are ants eating ants are also generally &~s predators so these are ants eating a caterpillar .
and the last thing that I want to say the last comment is related to &-uh the overall picture .
I think that one of the main thing that we should not do is lose perspective of the farmer .
the person who is making the decision as to whether to have shade or not have shade or or how much shade to have in these plantations and when we start looking at a system like this from a purely conservation perspective what &~w our conclusion will be well let's have these very shaded plantations .
I mean that that's the best thing .
that's that's what preserve the most biodiversity and we have data that shows that those very shaded plantations are the best for preserving biodiversity but it might not be the best for the farmer .
and so we need to look at &-uh &~inclu incorporate the farmer into this whole &-um decision can I have the next one ?
one of the &~sa <let me> let me just go back there .
can I just +//.
I'm sorry .
&=slide_change one of the main thing here is that even though farmers especially small farmers don't base all their decision only on the criteria of yield .
yield is one of the criterias that they use .
and one thing that we do know can I have the next one is that at very dense levels of shade cover you lose yield .
in the the productivity of the plant the the the yield of the plant goes down when they are grown on &~a under a very dense shade .
this is a study that was done by &-uh Lorena Soto from from Ecosur and this is for small plantations in Mexico .
the curve might be completely different from other plantations in other places but this is &-uh what she found in terms of the level of shade and yield of coffee and we do know that at certain levels of shade and actually you know going a little bit &-uh after sixty or something like that of shade that you &-uh reduce the the yield of the plants .
so can I have the last one ?
so one of the main thing here then is to try to come up with some sort of middle point let's say or some sort of a system that will satisfy the farmer and that will also serve &-uh or or have some conservation function as well .
so it's extremely important to incorporate farmers into this whole process because they are the ones who are going to make the decision as to whether &~ha to have shade or not or whether to &-uh how much level of shade to have .
and so I'm &~c just gonna end with this that the best cup of coffee will be one that will help preserve biological diversity but also have people at the center of it .
so John ?
okay can I have the lights please ?
&=applause I'm not finished .
oh .
go ahead .
&-um .
it's not for you John .
what we I'm not finished and you can't leave yet .
&-um we we've shown you two specific examples okay and they're just just two examples and they're examples of looking at sort of the finetuning level of particular aspects of an agroecosystem .
&-um <what we> what we what <going back to> going back to the beginning going back to the beginning where I was talking about the approach that we're taking the agroecosystem the industrial agroecosystem <that we> that we have <in our> in our midst today needs to be changed .
and one of the reasons that we're making these studies is to understand how agroecosystems works in general because we're totally convinced that understanding at an ecological level the details of how agroecosystems works &~i is what we're going to need in_order_to be able to effect change .
but when we talk about effecting change there are various models of effecting change that &~s change themselves and the models that we have seen since the World War Two have been what what I refer to as the autoroute models .
and <the the> the the image that I have in mind here is a topographic map and what we're aiming to do is get from one place to another on the topographic map so we're here and we wanna get to point A .
now the one way we can get there is we can draw a straight line from here to there .
and then we can go and <we can> &~dr we can follow that straight line .
if we're out in the woods following that straight line we may have to climb down into gullies scale up cliffs and fall through through rivers and and swamps and everything like that in_order_to follow that straight line .
or we can blast our way through and create an autoroute &-um &-um &-um a &~s a straight line that goes there .
but that might not be the best way to do it .
Best way to do it probably would be to look at the contours on the contour map and try and get a pathway along the contour to try and get from where we are now to the point over there .
now metaphorically of_course what I'm talking about is these contours are the ecology of the system .
&-uh agriculture occurs in the context of an ecosystem and that ecosystem creates these contours which I believe and we believe they act as signposts to tell us where we can make this contour pathway to get from point A to point B .
&-um so <the the> the the model that we're working on for transformation here is to be contrasted with the typical model that's &-uh the the autoroute model to be contrasted with that is the contour pathway model .
now in saying that I definitely wanna say that we're rejecting any sort_of romantic notions that what we should be doing is going <back to> back to nineteen thirty nine &-uh or back to the last century and the way they did agriculture in the last century .
we're not talking about that at all .
we're not talking about &-uh eliminating all the scientific progress that has been made since that time .
and we're not talking about eliminating or ignoring the scientific progress that has come since World War Two in agroecosystems .
indeed we'd reject the notion that many I think romantic &-uh &-uh romantic &-uh &-uh agroecologists have that we need to reject the scientific approach .
rather we're seeing we're saying actually we need more science we need more technology it's a question of what kind of science and what kind of technology that we actually need .
&-uh the kind of science that we need <the kind of> &~tech the kind of technology that we need is that kind of science and technology that enables us to see where these contours are where these ecological contours are .
it enables us to see where the contours are so that we can gently make a pathway through these contours .
as opposed to the old model of dominating nature with the autoroute and blasting our way through to point B from point A we need to gently make the pathway along the contours so that we can get to that other point .
and to see these contours we need to approach the ecosystem as the complex system that it is .
it is a complex system .
and &~pros approaching it with sort_of this sort_of brute force and I would say rather naive reductionist approach that many scientists approach it with is simply not going to work .
&-uh we all believe in reductionism as a tactic of_course I'm talking about &~reductioni reductionism as a philosophy .
what we need to do is we need to have a thoughtful approach a creative and thoughtful approach to these very complex systems &~and &~t &~n &~i to understand them in that way .
in putting those two things together emphasizing this gentle approach to finding the contour pathway .
and the thoughtful approach towards the complex system reminds me of the comment by Richard Levins &-uh that what we really need to approach here in in in aiming towards the transformation of the agroecosystem is a technology which is not an old technology but a new technology , as a matter of fact a more new technology &~tha &~th than the technologies that have emerged since World War Two .
we're looking for a gentle thought intensive kind of technology to replace the sort_of domineering autoroute kind of technology that we've had in the past .
so with that now you can applaud .
&=laughs:multiple &=applause and so we'd be &~hap we would both be happy to take questions +...
any any sense how long it takes for rediversification &-uh in an area that's been pretty well wiped out does it happen quite quickly again ?
well I can &~a answer <in the> in the case of Nicaragua I mean &~dep it it looks to us like it depends on what the wiping out has been .
it depends on what the kind of what the damage has been .
if it's a hurricane &-uh it's all very complicated because in ten years now since the hurricane we have much more biodiversity than was there before the hurricane .
that's a natural ecological process .
what happens after agriculture we don't know this &~proj this project that we had is just underway right now .
our expectation is that the accumulation of biodiversity is gonna be larger in the traditional agroecosystem than it is in the other ones although you know so far initial results don't really show that .
but we really don't know .
we don't know .
yeah ?
&-uh just the graph that you have of four different ways to move from the forest and biodiversity +/.
mhm ?
+, I I I wonder and this is hardly a response to &~y &~y you &~j just the &~st statement you just gave if if you might not have &-uh a rise in biodiversity when you move from the forest .
you you certainly see this with the decline of Alpine farms in Europe decline of rice farms in Japan &~wh on a larger &~s &-uh landscape scale you've got a rice farm in a valley surrounded by trees .
when the rice farm when the farmers go away and the rice stops growing you &~ha get a reduction of biodiversity .
a reduction of species compound and the same is true &-uh in Alpine Europe .
you get you know from from spruce and farms with lots_of birds and and &-uh different kinds of trees &-uh to solid spruce and a reduction in &~s in species &-uh count .
that leads me to another question .
what's what's a &-uh an operational definition of biodiversity is it species richness ?
<how do> &~yo how do you know when you've got more of it or less of it ?
&=laughs .
well it depends on what how you measure it +/.
yeah +/.
+, &-uh but &~me I was using the term biodiversity just in general meaning all the living organisms there but obviously that's not what I was measuring .
+, mhm +/.
+, you know I was measuring the number of species that were present in a particular plot that came to my baits .
+, yeah +/.
+, you know the the depending <on the> &~meas on the method you use to sample the diversity and then the indices that you use to quantify it .
&-uh species richness is one thing that people use frequently but that just tell you the number of species .
it doesn't tell you much about the the &-uh eh the densities of the organisms or anything like that just a count of the number of species +...
if you could give an incentive to a farmer in the States to diversify his crop would you do that first of all and second of all how would you do that ?
a farmer where ?
I'm sorry .
in the States .
in the States +...
&-uh yeah <I would> I would and I &~th I think that it's it's a very complicated issue because &-uh there's &-uh all sorts of political and policy &-uh effects that a farmer make a decision based on &-uh many many different factors .
but I think that one of the problems that we have like John mentioned at the beginning one of the main problems in agriculture and that's particularly true in the United State if you read you know the New York Times last Sunday or a_couple_of Sundays ago they had a big article on farming in the United State agriculture in the United State and farmers are in big trouble .
economic trouble .
mainly because the price of corn and soybean is so low and the reason for that is because that there's such a high overproduction .
so my argument is well if if that's the main problem overproduction then let's achieve a lower production and diversify these systems .
and have the farmer then at least have a a way to that would give the farmer a little bit more of of you know a a way to avoid drops in prices and things like that because they will have a diversity of crops .
now how farmers here in the United States are gonna react to that obviously right now the way policies are written and all that is there's no &~inc incentive to do that kind of thing .
the incentive right now is to produce as much as you can in your plot you know .
fence to fence production as much as you can .
and try to survive &=laughs:S3 with that .
⌊ you you have any questions ⌋ .
I think that I yeah I &~w I would like to add to that .
I think you also have to look at what causes that .
and that's caused largely by political decisions .
I mean the large grain companies &~an a as a matter of fact are making out like bandits on the whole thing .
and they the large grain companies through their lobbying efforts they were the ones who influenced the change in the legislation from what we used to have in the past supply management where farmers were only basically allowed to or &~re seemed to receive subsidies to plant a certain amount so that the supply of commodities on the market would be such that the price was set so that they could make a profit .
that changed to encourage fence rail to fence rail planting so that they actually forced to sell below the cost of production .
and then the subsidy comes to the farmer as a payment to make up for the shortfall that the farmer has had .
now who's actually benefitting from that whole thing the large grain companies are benefitting like crazy because they get to buy corn and wheat at below the cost of production .
which of_course then translates it into the third world because they're not buying corn in way below the cost of production and even farmers peasant farmers in Mexico and Costa Rica cannot compete with the &-uh with &-uh with farm grown in the United States because that farm is effectively well because the large grain companies are effectively subsidized by our tax dollars .
but it brings up another issue which &~sh that &~i I'm sorry for going so long such a long answer but it it brings up another issue and this is something that Ivette and I have talked about quite a_lot and that is the whole &-uh this whole question of overproduction in coffee .
I do recall several years ago at a coffee conference that we went to in Costa Rica where there were coffee experts from all over the world &-uh economists agronomists absolutely +//.
well not agronomists really but economists sociologists &-uh all people that dealt with coffee production people coffee finca@s:fra farmer owners and things like that .
and everybody everybody agreed what is the problem with coffee right now what is the problem with coffee right now is overproduction .
the economists agreed .
the economists from right to left agreed .
overproduction is the problem overproduction is the problem .
talk to any farmer what's the problem ?
overproduction is the problem .
then you go talk to the agronomists .
and you say to the agronomists what is your main research goal ?
to increase production .
&=laughs:multiple now there's a contradiction there there really is .
if you look at the history of the way coffee prices have been set <we have> we have precedence in the past for emergency situations .
I think I'll I'll cite just one of them which is World War Two where for political reasons the United States went into &~co went in +//.
went into coalition with various other countries to help devise means &~d devise ways of setting &-uh production goals for coffee which would effectively encourage an international supply management system to maintain coffee at a lower production level to save coffee farmers .
there's no reason why we can't do that again in terms of biodiversity preservation if people would see the question of biodiversity preservation as an emergency issue like World War Two was .
but &~anyway but that's that's a very long long argument .
was it you who had a question ?
&-um yeah &-uh &-uh &~a actually <with the> with the complication of the Natural Academy of Science's piece on I think that they called it sustainable agriculture about four five years ago .
&-um they really talked about traditional methods of &-uh diversifying agricultural production for the family farmer in in the United States and so I think I &~w the the the theme is out there about +/.
mhm yes .
+, diversified farming .
but I really &-uh but when I was interviewing family farmers in Michigan for a a related project &-um they would talk about becoming more monocultural as the family structure changed .
&-uh and so those who've got a small family or sometimes even single farmers they tended to go to a less diversified crop because they didn't have person power .
+, mhm +/.
+, I guess my question is related with your coffee examples &-um what kind of labor &-uh is involved the sort_of labor utilization in the sort_of the three or four models of cultivation .
well that's a very important question &=laughs and primarily in in &-uh in Mexico all this is &-uh hand picked coffee .
so none of it is mechanized none of the coffee is mechanized and hardly in any place in the world is mechanized either .
I mean there are very few places that have some machines that knock the plants and you know vibrate the plants or something and capture the the beans &~th that fall on the ground or something like that .
but for the most part it's all hand it's manual labor .
and in Mexico even small farmers that have the five hectare let's say a five hectare for for coffee five hectare is a small farm .
so even a farm that is about five hectares they have to hire labor during the peak of the harvesting season .
and most of that labor that they hire are indigenous people from Guatemala migrant workers that come from Guatemala .
and in my opinion if it wasn't for the migrant workers from Guatemala coffee would have disappeared from Mexico a long time ago .
(be)cause there's there's no &-uh I mean that's that's the primary primary &-uh hands that pick the coffee .
and currently &~goi to going back to Costa Rica currently the all of the coffee in Costa Rica is harvested by migrant Nicaraguan workers .
but then also I I thought that part of your question was also related to the different system of production and &-um one thing that that +//.
there's some studies that have looked at organic coffee work for example .
no study have been done to look at labor &-uh and &~n the &-uh the whole economics including labor of the shaded plantations .
but it has been done for for organic plantations many of which are shaded plantations .
and they tend to consume higher labor than &-uh the nonorganic &~a and and in the case of organics@n it's primarily because of the whole &-uh the compost and they have to put the &~compo compost in the plants &~an and all that .
so it requires a_lot_of labor .
in the coffee plantations that are highly diverse you also save some labor in terms of weeding in terms of fertilizing and things like that because <it's a> it's a really &~integra integrated system .
a_lot_of &~the &~the &~the canopy of the trees is controlling the weeds .
and also a_lot_of the &-uh the leaf litter that falls add nutrients to the system and they they don't and so especially in weed control it's a big saving &-uh labor saving &-uh method to have that that canopy of trees +...
anyone ?
&-uh &~y you this very interesting &-uh talk about the the agreement of everyone except the agronomists &-uh you_know focuses attention on something we're all interested in how do you build interdisciplinary activities ?
&~ho how can you organize things to draw that agronomist into a team that tries to work together to increase not just yield but &-uh a a balanced kind of production .
got any ideas about that ?
no .
&=laughs:multiple .
the thing is the &~s schools are highly fragmented like for example John started this talk by by saying well we're not MSU you know why do agriculture here .
and I think that the importance of doing agriculture here is that we have a very different perspective .
you go to MSU and yes there are people there that are doing sustainable agriculture there's a whole group of people but they are like this in comparison to the whole establishment of the land grant institution .
and so an agronomist that get trained there gets trained ⌈ in the same ⌉ +/.
⌊ in agronomy ⌋ +/.
+, &~i in an agronomy fashion .
and so &~i in agronomy schools I think it's very important to try to to come up with this &-uh interdisciplinary approach where you don't look at just this single issue but you look at the whole system as a &~s system as a whole .
I I think you know that &~i in a curious way part of the problem might be just because of the the way the history of interdisciplinary research has gone in recent years &-uh <part of the> <part of the> &~st part of the the the solution might be to stop using the word interdisciplinary .
because for so many &~disci disciplines like agronomy +/.
yeah +/.
+, interdisciplinary means I have to put up with a sociologist and then an economist for long enough to write the grant proposal +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, to get the money +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, that's all that it means to them .
and so perhaps if we changed the &-uh +/.
+, problem oriented +/.
+, yeah look at problem oriented +/.
+, ⌈ system &-uh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and that's ⌋ one of the reasons <that I that I> that I that I talked about the agronomist's point of view and then the ecologist's point of view .
and just argued that there's another way of looking at nature and argued this with the agronomist that there's another way of looking at nature .
and that's from an ecological point of view and this ecological point of view implies some other things .
now they imply what you and I would probably call interdisciplinary but we don't necessarily have to say that you know .
we can just say it implies well there are these economic problems there are these sociological problems etcetera .
+, ⌈ so you ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ just ⌋ a thought .
<when you> when you think of for example buildings organizational structures that would promote this value you have things like the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis which does very good interdisciplinary work because you've got a_lot_of disciplinary folks from different regions working on a problem .
and people are thinking here now at University of Michigan what kind of organizational structure should we have that would deal with environmental issues broadly rather than with one specific discipline at a time ?
well I think these kind of seminars is you know is part of it .
because I am sure there are a_lot_of people here that are not from the ecological side of things and so I I think &~i it does bring up a a_lot_of &-uh interdisciplinary things .
&-uh &-uh I I guess my question about labor utilization was related to that because you know when you're talking about development models which I think John is talking about when he talked about sort_of science based green revolution technology versus a softer impact .
&-um the question of you know are people going to be sustained and and the sustainability of social structures relates to having a job so I think one very interesting component of your really fascinating work would be to know what the implications were for the sort_of diversity of employment and &~sus subsistence opportunities +/.
mhm +/.
+, of the different markets .
yeah +/.
yeah +/.
+, yeah .
actually one interesting thing that happens related to this thing in in Chiapas in particular is that coffee of_course is not a traditional crop from Mexico and but it had it it started by being &-uh it was imported &~m primarily by Germans .
to Mexico and usually these were large farms .
and indigenous people started working in these plantations and that's where they learned how to produce coffee .
when many of them started migrating to other places in in Mexico then they started their own coffee plantation but they learned to do coffee in these areas .
and now &-uh as I mention in the Zapatista region a_lot_of producers there are coffee producers .
and they all were &-uh not well I shouldn't say all but a_lot_of them were workers in the large coffee plantations in the Soconusco area .
George ?
do you guys have enough information yet to know <what the> what the relative comparison is between the decrease in diversity <from a> from a forest &-uh to a shade plantation and the relative increase going from a shade plantation in terms of coffee yield to the high yielding full sun varieties .
because for example if if you can think of the tradeoff if you just look at yield even if you just kept yield the same in the diversity it it might work out that it's better to put more of the shaded plantations into full sun varieties and take that land and put it into just let it return to natural forest .
so if you get a if you get a greater yield per unit area a a little bit greater out_of that then you get a species increase and .
and what you do with the all the people that depend on coffee &=laughs:S3 ⌈ for their survival ⌉ ?
⌊ well I I just ⌋ well I'm just saying .
⌈ that's where that's the other component ⌉ .
⌊ you're &~s producing ⌋ the same amount I mean that ⌈ I I see your ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ but in terms of the amount of people that are involved in producing and benefitting from this activity it's much more reduced if you have an intensive coffee plantation .
in terms of the amount of coffee that you produce you're probably right .
&-uh but then you have to do something with the people that used to produce coffee and now there's a forest here that they cannot use .
yes &-uh I &-uh I would approach that with a multidimensional answer .
I &~can I agree with Ivette .
that is one thing &-uh the fact is you're dealing with facts on the ground here people produce coffee .
okay now if you wanna have an industrial program where are people gonna stop producing coffee which did happen in Puerto Rico okay that's one thing but that hasta be one component of it .
the second component of it &-uh is the the one that I think you were getting at and the one that you were getting at was the was whether you can have this this tradeoff with producing a_lot_of coffee over here &-uh and still preserving the biodiversity by having all that forest and everything .
&-uh it turns out that you don't reduce ant biodiversity hardly at all when you go as just &~I Ivette showed you here &-uh when you go from a forest to a shaded plantation &-uh you just don't .
but you do reduce butterfly diversity quite a_lot .
so it actually depends on what kind of biodiversity you're really interested in and it's not clear <how that> &-uh how that actually would how that actually would shake out it really isn't .
but then there's a third component too George .
and that is this whole productionist mentality .
we don't wanna produce more coffee in the first place .
okay there's too much coffee in the world as it is .
&-uh the price of coffee isn't high enough for most coffee producers to actually make a living .
&-uh what we're after and what we should be after is reduction in the &~c in in in the production of coffee .
not more &~c <not more> not more coffee .
⌈ so ⌉ .
⌊ but ⌋ what do you do with the people who if you reduce yield what do you do with the people who +/.
excellent +/.
+, were working to I mean +/.
+, ⌈ excellent ⌉ +/.

⌈ point ⌉ I'm glad you brought that up .
higher ⌊ price ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ the point ⌉ is the point of no no what you do with those people you +//.
they're on their plantations but they have shade trees on their plantations .
so their production goes down .
they have more biodiversity .
and in_order_to in in_order_to satisfy their needs well the production goes down first overall so the price of coffee goes up so they make more money and then you have governmental structures just like we had in World War Two during the Cold War and other times where we subsidized the production of coffee .
it all works out it really does .
but that's ⌊ also a different political system ⌋ .
⌈ also the &~o especially ⌉ +/.
⌊ it hasn't yet yeah ⌋ +/.
+, especially but also the other thing is that especially the small plantations &-uh small producers a_lot_of the time the shade is also &~i &~i it also produces something that they use .
it's a fruit tree or there're a_lot_of fruit trees they either commercialize or they use for for their subsistence .
so there's a a whole other component to to it as well .
why don't we have one more question and then we'll break as a group and anybody else can stay on and talk with John and Ivette I'll let you choose .
&~he this gentleman here .
well &~i it seems that you have exactly the same sort_of problem as you do with population that's growing in India .
in India one has a greater sense of security as a family by having the largest number of children .
the whole belief for India it's a disaster .
and coffee plantations what is desirable globally is not optimal for a guy who owns his five hectares .
he gets more coffee he gets more money gets more income employs less labor if he makes a modern and &-uh agricultural &-uh plantation .
without the biodiversity .
so you essentially have to legislate this or impose it so that &-uh the individuals can accept this .
because for the individual owning the land it's not his optimum path .
<we can> we can ⌈ make it ⌉ +/.
⌊ that ⌋ +/.
+, I'm sorry go ahead .
just one problem related to that and that's that's what the strategy &-uh that came out_of the Smithsonian I &-uh addresses .
and essentially their main point is that you have to convince people that they should pay more for this product because the the yield is lower so the farmer is not gonna want to have a lower yield and still receive the same price .
but if you can assure this farmer a higher price for a lower yield he's gonna break even or he's gonna be more or less the same .
he's not gonna end up losing by having it in the shade of his plantation or her plantation .
so that's that's one of the &-uh <market oriented> market oriented &-uh strategies to the xxx grower .
that's that's that's that's one strategy but I think you've made a good point there before .
the other strategy is a legislative strategy .
in the places we've done it before we've done it over and over again before .
when the public at large and especially the political leaders of the world acknowledge that there's an emergency situation .
it happened in World War Two it happened during the Cold War and it happened at several other points also .
if biodiversity loss is regarded by the world as an emergency situation which I think it should be .
unfortunately it's not .
there is an emergency situation there we can get the world to legislate the way coffee should be produced .
and that's what I think needs to happen .
I'm not nearly as sanguine about the market approach that Ivette &-uh ⌈ seems to love ⌉ +/.
⌊ &-um no ⌋ +/.
+, so much &=laughs:multiple .
I don't I don't I see a_lot_of problem with that approach .
but that's an approach that actually has received a_lot_of attention right now .
so you need an OPEC of coffee producers &=laughs:S2 ⌈ if you wanna fix the price globally ⌉ .
⌊ that's what we had &~i ⌋ that's what they had in in the past George .

well on that note have another cup of coffee on your way out and let's thank John and Ivette for a really nice xxx &=applause .
