what that reminds me is we go back to our list of what all the living organisms need . 875_7095
who remembers what all the living organisms need ? 7295_9775
name one thing . 10075_10855
well they need +... 11295_12435
one thing .
air, and by the way plants don't need +... 12875_14695
stop .
yes . 14875_15115
water ? 15735_16075
water . 16395_16995
yes . 17235_17795
nutrients . 17955_18395
nutrients . 18735_19435
waste disposal . 19795_20655
waste disposal ? 21135_23075
yeah . 23275_23415
light . 23675_24195
light . 24835_25295
air . 25555_26695
air and gas exchange . 27545_28825
so as with animals, we take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide . 29565_38005
xxx you need to stop, you've been asked to stop this is irritating me as well . 39765_43905
plants are doing the reverse . 45805_48145
S_seven, what are plants doing ? 49825_51365
they're doing the reverse . 55785_57385
they're doing the reverse of us, so if animals if animals are taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide, what are plants doing ?
if they're doing it in reverse what are they doing ? 64855_70155
S_eight .
they're taking in CO_two and they're letting out oxygen . 70295_74535
they're taking in CO_two and letting out oxygen . 74615_77455
okay I wanna see thumbs up, thumbs down . 79675_81775
are plants living organisms ? 83075_84635
I'm not seeing everybody participate . 86015_90775
are plants made of cells ? 92435_94095
are plant cells alive ? 95195_100935
okay we talked about what plant cells need to survive . 107795_111295
water, food, gasses, and waste disposal . 113295_116175
so here's the question: how do plant cells get the resources they need for life ? 118975_124015
that was our focus question . 124215_125335
any guesses ? 125495_126075
what did you put in ? 126715_128135
what did you write in your, anybody ? 129835_135735
S_nine ?
well plants get food from the sun . 136455_140755
it's they use a process called photo, photosymp +... 141135_145955
synthesis . 146295_147615
synthesis . 148315_148435
and the plants get water from rain or their roots go underground and find ground water . 149075_156155
okay, anybody add to that ? 157395_159795
S_ten ?
um, oh shoot wrong page . 159915_162795
um so they use their leaves to um and use photosynthesis to, like the veins of the plants distribute the nutrients and then the gas exchange from the, also when the roots suck up the water from the ground +... 163295_183935
so we've heard a couple of times that the roots are sucking up the water from the ground . 188185_191725
S_eleven ?
I kind of didn't mention the part about the food +... 192105_195125
loud voice please . 195745_197045
I think food and water gets transported by vascular plants by water coming up through the roots that carry nutrients in the soil . 197105_204185
then water travels up through the stem and branches off giving nutrients to the whole plant . 204585_208485
okay . 209145_209425
S_twelve .
um the roots actually don't suck up the water more, they absorb it . 209965_215725
and the leaves have photosynthesis which creates sugar, and those then travel through the stem and branch off to other parts of the plants . 216425_224685
okay so you're saying in the leaves we've got sugar up here +... 225445_229225
yup .
in the roots we've got water down here +... 229345_231345
yup .
and all of those are getting to all the cells in the plants +... 231825_234685
yeah . 235465_235625
by ? 235625_236045
I'm not really sure . 237105_239165
okay . 239445_239705
I think it has to do with the stem though . 240385_243005
okay through the stem . 243305_244225
on how they make the sugar .
they get carbon dioxide and they get water H-two-O and C-O-two, and they split some of the oxygen off and I don't think it really matters which splits off and then they expel it and they're left with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and then with that they make glucose or sugar and then they burn it for energy . 249115_276995
I'll tell you what .
I have a whole challenge for you this morning . 282845_285205
I raced out into my garden this morning, and this is an unusual variety of celery . 286385_305565
this is a red celery that my son planted . 305805_310465
so this is what I have . 322545_323785
I've got stems . 323945_324625
I have leaves . 325325_327385
what am I missing ? 329885_331325
what am I missing ? 332265_339525
S_eleven ?
the roots .
I'm missing some roots . 340185_344525
will these plant stems be able to get the water for their cells without their cells, do you think ? 345125_350005
yes ? 350145_350465
no ? 350705_350885
okay I'm seeing yesses . 351325_356685
explain it to me . 357125_358665
S_thirteen .
well +... 359145_360965
why do you think it could get water to its cells ? 362205_367025
um, well, uh they have a stem +... 368165_374645
okay . 375305_379625
and the stem goes to the leaves +... 376785_379005
okay .
and the leaves have cells in them . 379745_383325
are there cells in the stem ? 384465_386265
yes . 386985_388165
okay . 388485_388685
so you think that whatever the transportation system is +... 389165_395825
do leaves and things +...
will still work ? 396325_398465
yes .
that's how they get their water to their +... 399045_404145
okay .
S_one .
I'm not sure and I might be wrong, well I'm probably wrong but anyway, they might use some sort of vacuum, not like a vacuum cleaner but like a vacuum that vacuums water up, probably mistaken but +... 412225_435065
okay . 436145_437785
S_seven thank you for your quiet hand . 438935_440235
connected to the bottom of the plant +... 442235_445275
excuse me I'm hearing too much talking in Table A I can't hear you . 445635_450535
you could like flip the plant over and then pour it into a place with the roots it could work . 451335_455695
oh you think that if I turn this over and poured water in here that that would do it ? 455795_459715
maybe . 460335_460755
okay . 461095_461435
that's a theory . 461995_462615
S_fourteen .
well I have a clarifying question for S_one . 463275_465655
thank you . 466435_466775
so, do you mean that once rain falls on the leaves it sucks it in and drinks it ? 470185_477285
no .
okay .
like what do you mean ? 477485_480745
I think, no I'm probably wrong that the root I mean that the roots get the water when it sucks it up the vacuum sucks it up +... 480845_496765
oh okay . 497285_497605
so S_one ? 498785_499925
S_one, are you saying that there is some mechanism that sucks up the water from the roots ? 499925_510825
yes but on second thought that's wrong . 511285_514765
on second thought, I don't really believe myself . 515565_518645
okay so now you're changing your hypothesis . 519305_523265
yes . 523565_523765
S_ten .
so, well I agree with S_one but I respectfully disagree with S_seven because um +... 526745_538825
yes, I'm sorry . 540625_546525
um so I agree with S_one (be)cause um most of the roots are gone from the plant, I think that the stem and the water, and the stem acts as the roots because but not for the, as long as it has the roots because the roots well they'd spread across, well they spread, they get so many roots that they um +... 546825_576805
okay I sort of lost the train of your thinking, can you sort of summarize what you just said ? 583595_588495
so I agree with S_one and once the roots are gone then the stem can act as roots, and also +... 589195_595635
okay so once the roots are gone, the stem can continue to act like roots forever ? 595675_600195
well not forever because uh, the, because it's, roots and also to help that happen if you cut of the end because the end of the stem can get dried up and +... 601075_615775
okay so once we've cut off the root the end of the stem can get dried up, and if the end of the stem gets dried up what will happen ? 617215_625335
the plant will die because it can't get enough water . 625755_626995
oh (be)cause then, the act of drying the end, when you cut it off, will prevent the water from going up and it'll just die . 627865_635765
well and also, I disagree with S_seven because if you hold the plant upside down um that's uh it's not really like a straw where you can pour water in it, it would just drain down . 635725_656225
if you hold it upside down even though that's the way that the gravity would go, the plant would just like float xxx the plant would have to have some xxx to go up into the plant and also if you hold it upside down like string it to a wall or something, that makes it dry out faster . 656705_677965
S_fifteen .
I don't know I just thought about this, that when the plant and you put water in the soil, it doesn't just go down, it the soil absorbs the water with the roots inside the soil and maybe like they, I don't know . 679645_694245
so it has something to do about absorbing the water from the soil ? 695005_699045
and it has water in the soil . 699185_700505
okay roots in the soil . 700905_702005
S_sixteen .
well actually the stem is basically a root (be)cause it has roots inside of it, kind of . 703235_711095
like the xylem and phloem that's like how it brings the water up and takes out all the other xxx . 711595_716575
okay do you +... 716855_720275
(be)cause then it'll snap .
does anybody have a clarifying question for S_sixteen ? 721295_723915
we just heard some new terms . 723915_725255
S_seventeen ?
well I can repeat them (be)cause some people didn't hear them . 730885_733245
okay .
he said xylem and phloem . 733785_735325
has anybody ever heard of xylem and phloem ? 736845_739425
thumbs up if you've ever heard of it . 739565_740925
okay so can you elaborate a little bit ? 741385_746005
I think the xylem is like it's all water and nutrients up at top of the leaves and branches xxx and then the phloem, it kind of does the same thing just the opposite . 748605_767385
okay .
but if it has roots, then the roots go, connect to the xylem and phloem so that it can go through the outer part . 768645_774825
okay so there is a transportation system in plants similar to animals in that we've got veins and arteries that take nutrients to all the cells in our body, you're saying that something similar in plants in phloem and xylem ? 775675_791755
okay yeah you want to add to that ? 792375_793815
yeah well um say if you take, if you did uh also you can also change the color of the xylem and phloem if you take celery and you cut the end of it and put it in water that's dye and you change the color of the xylem and phloem because then it goes through it . 794395_818115
okay last comment and then I've got my challenge for you . 818435_822155
okay I think S_one is correct in saying that there's a vacuum up at the top because if you suck through a straw what you're doing is you're creating a vacuum in the top portion of the straw which is sucking water up into that portion and you keep doing that it puts it in your mouth . 821755_836395
so I think because leaves are using gas in the top part, and then expelling it, it turns into a vacuum in the leaves and then the top portion of the stem . 836675_848975
so water gets sucked up into it so all the water needs to do is just to get xxx moving you cut it to do that, um so (be)cause there's no air at the top to get pulled up and it would keep getting pulled up the leaves keep making xxx . 850225_869285
oh interesting . 870645_872525
so you think that even though this plant has been cut off, it will continue to do photosynthesis ? 873505_881285
yes, and I think what would happen if I think that's why if you cut, if you cut portions of the stem off that have no leaves on them, but you give them glucose in a way, you give the stem glucose in a way where it could use the glucose, I don't know how you do that but this is just theoretical, the stem would still die because it can't suck water up because there's no glucose . 881505_907605
okay so you're sort of making relationship between being able to suck the water up and having leaves . 908555_914415
yes . 914955_914975
