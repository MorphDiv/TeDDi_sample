different looking strips . 380_1550
and she's gonna be able to choose the one that she and Jenna will
so all you she has to do is get this one down . 6620_8500
and then I'll be back to talk to you when you choose the one you
finished . 12040_12340
but when I'm done with that one how how are how am I gonna pick
you have to pick one out or it means you get to pick 'cause the
tomorrow . 21960_22340
okay . 22570_22710
so you'll get started on your part of the finished quilt . 22900_25630
and she'll be working with you . 25680_26630
tomorrow . 26880_27110
okay . 27270_27420
okay . 27910_28050
so you'll probably get to the construction part today and then be
okay . 33110_33240
she'll be able to use the plan that you do on graph paper for what
and she'll be able to pick to make a two-sided strip like yours to
and she's making them with colored paper . 42900_44940
okay . 45510_45750
because you guys designed the four square together . 46400_48430
and she'll &-um . 48660_49370
and . 51780_51950
that that will be fine . 52000_52690
she'll still have you helping show her the pattern that you think
okay . 56790_56980
so once you get this recorded I'll be back to talk to you about
okay . 63750_64019
I think that's the problem <you were> you were looking at right
you were looking at what Justin's doing . 72080_73980
and Justin's not seeing the script from the same direction anymore
your . 78070_78190
paper doesn't have to match Justin's exactly . 78240_81550
you just have to make a draw the script . 81740_83500
so see the way you're looking at the strip on the top of the strip
the two triangles coming together . 87100_88260
red meat the top of the way you're looking at it . 88820_91120
the way Justin's looking at at the top of the meds . 91620_94190
so it'll look different on his paper . 96210_98420
but look you look around . 98940_100550
and if this was one whichever chose you'll to do that . 101740_104150
so you'll still have he's just looking at . 104950_107700
Brian there's . 129729_131660
no part in the strip . 131720_132980
you guys have planned . 133000_133830
now where Arrow's all . 133940_135110
not . 136060_136140
at the beginning . 136200_136740
I mean not at the beginning of it . 142360_143440
green red red green green red red green green red .
so . 154620_154790
this isn't how . 155870_156870
it looks Brian you need to start over also . 157380_159600
'cause there's there's no place where the first one come out
so just leave that one . 165860_166670
Brian you need to do the same . 167250_168480
thing come over here right where I'm now right here watch the mic .
and take a look at it this way . 174670_176180
and do it this way . 177070_177680
you're trying to you were trying <to sit> to sit . 178000_179110
you had no room to look at it . 179160_180400
so pencil . 181900_182960
okay . 186790_187030
six four squares will be your first four square second square
there's one two three four six that'll help you see where you're on
make this . 205430_205950
I know that's fine . 208440_209140
to keep in from getting mixed up . 209300_210500
that was a perfect solution to problem . 210520_212150
yeah . 212950_213050
can you you'll leave a step over this . 213260_214950
so you don't knock any of their thanks for walking around . 216110_219310
good job . 221220_221570
and I know that when Nathan comes back in also step . 231640_233940
okay . 236590_236830
don't look at the one you did before you started over is because
okay . 263700_263860
the first half of your verse four square . 263940_265580
but look at how it's divided . 265660_266870
you need to be right looking at it sideways is confusing you to
so it's on a nice straight line going the same way as your paper .
and then see where the two green triangles are gonna be . 274740_276950
and where the Ss red ones are gonna be . 277000_278900
okay . 279670_279860
okay good . 280270_280870
start this one . 280920_282450
why don't you help finish . 289220_290430
okay that that but it's going a different way . 291150_302630
it is a green triangle . 309020_309910
but it's not arranged that way . 310140_311350
it's not in the same position as the first green triangle . 312550_314760
great . 316410_316660
it does feel green red green triangle . 316780_319310
alright . 321470_321620
so Brian is right that a green triangle will be touching the red
&-uh you already said that you knew that . 330500_339700
Green would be touching that ranch . 339720_341010
looks good . 350680_351220
that's . 390900_391030
exactly right . 391240_391990
and all you do is go into . 392830_393780
the grade at Sugar Creek &-um somebody at creek . 394310_425060
that's looks good . 427220_456720
like Nathan get through . 459470_460460
thanks . 463260_463660
Nathan . 463680_464020
okay . 466590_466720
keep going . 466880_467300
Paul Brian . 467680_468270
it's . 485310_485400
hard . 485600_485720
you have to kind of take them apart with your eyes and figure out
ends . 489390_489660
and the next one begins . 489770_490820
and . 493300_493390
even when you know it's another red triangle and a green triangle .
how they're arranged . 496300_497150
makes a_lot_of difference to the design . 497290_499070
does &-um take a look . 499310_500660
at that one . 500680_500990
yep . 501580_501670
that's right . 501800_502120
because it's gonna make the second half of that looks cool . 503550_509100
because right here it looks kind of like . 509880_511830
I mean there's like the backside . 512840_514230
mhm . 514780_514980
mhm . 515700_515870
but it's kind of harder with the backside . 516460_518400
mhm . 518950_519070
yes it's . 520539_520850
but once you get it all on the graph paper it's easier to see just
good job . 538820_539150
I can see exactly where that's going there . 546200_549670
okay . 550910_551110
the second one and the third one . 553340_554610
and it was the third . 556200_557030
mhm . 557530_557670
the first half of the third one . 557940_559330
yep . 560400_560500
I'm gonna you guys keep going . 560780_562340
you're doing a great job . 562360_563350
now Justin you keep helping them out . 563620_564870
