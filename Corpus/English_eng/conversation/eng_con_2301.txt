before to come up with the idea . 0_1753
yeah +/. 1753_2998
then after I used the methods to test that design then you just
yeah . 6668_7165
so you're supposed to use like keystroke level modeling and stuff
and U_A_Rs . 10716_12708
and that's like supposed to support that our idea is a good
<so, &~act> so actually I guess like that we should just look
what are we supposed to like do for our keystroke level modeling
are we supposed to compare it to the keystroke level modeling
I guess we can . 40663_41293
technically when we did that homework they said that it wasn't for
yeah . 44996_46338
so, I guess, yeah, we can just like have some sketches of
mmhmm . 53843_54356
I think it would +//. 54356_55935
it's going to be hard to like top google notebook . 55935_57278
or the right click context menu . 57278_59916
yeah, like +... 59916_60896
yeah but see, if you make it (..) +//. 60896_63900
you can offer a feature google notebook doesn't . 63900_67136
that justify +/. 67136_68581
even if it's a little bit longer, it would justify using our method
that's true . 72850_73246
I think that's what we are supposed to do . 73246_74523
even if it's not faster than google notebook, it would be something
yup . 78873_80085
yeah . 80085_80466
yeah, its go +//. 80466_81080
its gotta let them you know +//. 81080_81976
it's not only about buying a couch, it's more about building a
I feel with like the google notebook all it really does is a +//. 86126_89248
like all it does is allow you to like (..) takes a where the page
yeah, it just like link and then subtext there . 95805_96816
yeah . 96816_97165
so, yeah I mean we could just argue that it takes really like small
and discuss . 111775_112238
but yeah discuss you know like maybe list them by price or like
so, it's only like a small portion . 117271_119941
I feel like, yeah . 119941_121833
you could argue that the time it takes longer . 121833_125218
it talks about the group meeting time . 125218_127776
do we need to like set up a group meeting time with like Bonnie or
umm, it's in like two weeks or so, they'll have another sign up
it's one of the mandatory times . 134210_135856
so, wait, it is it we'll have a sign up thing in two weeks
I can bring up the schedule . 140998_144003
is the final report, the thing that's worth twenty percent ? 144003_151340
yes . 151340_152501
okay . 152501_152883
and that's due tomorrow ? 152883_155106
no . 155106_156585
no ? 156585_157000
oh, okay . 157000_158096
it's due December third . 158096_159538
then what's due tomorrow ? 159538_161130
nothing . 161130_162523
oh, okay, wow . 162523_164963
I totally thought that it was due tomorrow so oh my God . 164616_168000
but <we wanna get> we wanna get started now so that we don't
so basically what they said was you guys don't have homework for
yeah, yeah . 177198_177778
okay . 177778_178341
<so we ah> did we had three homeworks so far or four ? 178341_182508
we had three . 182508_184151
yeah, there's four and five at some point . 184151_186808
yes . 186808_187355
one's a think aloud and the other's the cognitive walkthrough . 187355_190061
yes . 190061_191041
homework three was Cog_Tool . 191041_192218
and cognitive walkthrough is November fifth . 192218_194510
and our group meeting is November tenth . 194510_197446
so are they going to talk about cognitive walkthrough tomorrow ? 197446_200651
umm +... 200651_202875
because I probably will not be able to go to that . 202875_204818
no, the subject for tomorrow, like I know one of them is speed
and tomorrow was +//. 211640_214730
I know I read the paper on it that we had to read and it was about
and stuff and how like people and like how some cultures are
I need to go to the DMV and get my learner's permit . 227293_232090
get my (..) xxx xxx . 232090_238066
yeah, looks like the topic for tomorrow is products and
there's no reading though . 245070_247063
uh, there is they put is on umm +/. 247063_250825
it's not on the syllabus schedule . 250825_252053
it's on blackboard . 252053_254543
and they also have a new schedule on blackboard . 254543_257115
ah, yeah . 257115_257648
it just says TBA but yeah it is on blackboard under the folder . 257648_263788
okay, so ah . 263788_275958
so, it looks like we need an idea and some evidence supporting our
yeah, so I guess we can look through the model that they
the correct model . 290261_291110
then we can figure out like exactly which aspect we xxx . 291110_297185
it seems like a good idea like I don't +//. 297185_300520
remember when we went through in class we talked about like role
we would want to build something that supports that . 305598_307043
and reduce double work . 307043_308423
yes . 308423_309550
key phrase . 309550_311193
double work . 311193_312106
it's more economical . 312106_315708
and tomorrow's October twenty-seven . 315708_324141
there's nothing on like this new scheduling even . 324141_328953
it says to be announced but it's under every file for every lecture
I know but like +... 332656_333876
they suck at +//. 333876_336733
I'm going to check . 336733_338693
so, it seems like google notebook is kind of what our orig
like it saves the link and then you can put a comment . 352388_354761
yeah . 354761_355556
so why was John so against it ? 355556_356846
John wanted us to build community . 356846_361311
apparently google notebook does not . 361311_363023
oh my God . 363023_364963
do we call something community notebook +/. 364963_368266
but it's the most efficient . 368266_368930
it java that's the word really in the title no less . 368930_372218
are we meeting with Bonnie next time ? 372218_375355
yes please . 375355_376913
please, yeah . 376913_378360
I mean some people who met with John . 378360_381298
like Alyssa was, they met with John and they were like oh yeah, he
dude, the guy forgot that we had five members in our group . 385598_390840
he mentioned like you forgetting his name . 390840_394460
uh, so I uh hi +... 394460_398643
what are you like +/. 398643_400423
aren't you the guy that teaches the class ? 400423_402111
yeah . 402111_402643
yeah, I saw you are you the TA ? 402643_403990
are you Aruna's TA ? 403990_408735
okay, so I guess like on here it says even though John and
yeah, you have to make it like +/. 420506_421815
or at least like explain it to a regular audience . 421815_424455
act like this is like you know a project that a company like or
so, do we +//? 429568_431691
should we like decide an idea first ? 431691_433320
I think that would probably be a good idea . 433320_437486
like go through ideas that support what we've found in the +... 437486_440501
so, are we going to like go through ideas and see ⌈which one is
⌊yeah, yeah . 444051_444613
maybe we should start by kind of going through the models and
kind of what we were doing in class, seeing what the problems were
and also that really can like you know figure out +//. 460965_464301
can get a very narrow target where on xxx and everything else xxx .
yeah, we can work on like +//. 467653_470573
I guess this would be the part where we have technology that we are
yeah . 475935_476483
this wiki is like private, right ? 476483_480221
yeah . 480221_481596
okay . 481596_482143
okay, let's look at +... 482143_488318
the name of, oh flow model that's it . 488318_498845
what, uh +... 498845_499971
I should have brought the homework . 499971_501000
it's on the slides . 501000_502845
which lecture is it in ? 502845_504303
number eight . 504303_504753
ah, there there ah . 504753_505948
model solution to the model problem (12.4) . 505948_509015
which +//? 509015_522841
ah . 522841_523886
number eight . 523886_524918
no no no, like which lecture ? 524918_527091
methods of making . 527091_528070
I've been counting (6.) . 528070_530123
hhh . 530123_540896
I just watched the office last night (15.) . 540896_545151
okay . 545151_563941
so should we like focus on ah +... 563941_565301
these are nice . 565301_568091
I like the colors . 568091_569220
uh, should we like focus on the breakdowns ? 569220_577023
they said don't only look at breakdowns . 577023_583378
yeah, okay . 583378_584558
so, I guess the first thing that caught my eye was like the the
so I mean that's a good starting point that we can build on and
so we want to replicate +//. 610121_615300
it's kind of like replicating what they do in real life but we give
we'll have to make it so that when they are not home they can still
yeah and not xxx their conversation . 626503_628811
that's community . 628811_631101
so we should like let them put in their like preferences before
I get the +//. 638340_641675
yeah I guess +//. 641675_642723
yeah I mean +... 642723_643355
and then like xxx could be like a page where you can like at a
we're supposed to support all shopping, correct ? 649211_651900
not just couch shopping ? 651900_653363
yeah . 653363_653943
okay . 653943_655620
well yeah, I mean it would be kind of awkward if there was like
couch shopper dot com . 662740_665148
you can basically you know +//. 665148_667058
you can basically like have a +... 667058_669828
like a say for whatever they're buying like if they're buying a
so, they start a kitchen table shopping session and then every
key it in and then uh so everyone at a glance here can see
do <do we wanna make it like> do we wanna make it like
<do we wanna> do just wanna people like answer in like I don't
I think we can enter in free form and do the same thing use natural
yeah, see like where's the line between like what is possible and
well, I know NLP is technically possible . 713631_718328
but what is like feasibly possible given our like +/. 718328_718630
I feel like free form might be a little hard . 718630_721980
like people might forget to like put things in that they feel is
we could like have certain like questions like what is your price
to me its like certain categories, right, and then whether this is
yeah, you could have like plus minuses . 738481_740955
that's a problem like stuff for price . 740955_744273
what ? 744273_745886
like when you got uh +... 745886_747410
okay for price lists and stuff there should like be a price range
and usually price ranges are better . 752326_754183
yeah, okay . 754183_758431
so (..) it's an idea . 758431_762431
yeah, you wanna go +/? 762431_765850
did we ever like go through the ideas on the wiki ? 765850_768541
yeah, we can go through them . 768541_770383
we were going to but then had that meeting with John . 770383_773136
yeah, the community meeting . 773136_776890
wait no, on this wiki like +/. 776890_780541
yeah, we haven't haven't gone through it . 780541_782301
that was we made this after the ⌈meeting with John . 782301_785171
⌊after the meeting . 785171_786398
hhh yeah, that's why you put like ⌈ community . 791256_795885
⌊ all the community stuff . 795885_796381
yeah . 796381_798456
xxx I was just reading Dave's and digital affinity diagram
we can probably make some features of our system too that you like
like something you you can say the space you have to put the couch
that way like it will check the dim +//. 849285_852023
like if you want to search for couches you can like put the
but like none of the couches umm I mean guess not none but like +/.
some of the couches on craigslist had the had the dimensions .
the stuff on Macy's definately had the dimensions . 865138_868323
yeah, I mean you could just parse it . 868323_869883
have like interns like parse this code . 869883_874100
I mean technically the person could just like, if they wanted to
so, so like having users entering in their preferences is like the
yeah . 889555_890251
I was thinking like each user can designate like five top
they can like base it upon their preferences instead of +//. 907583_912263
I don't know it's kind of hard visualize I think but +... 912263_916711
I mean like in an ideal word world you can just like rate your
but the thing is like the repeat +//. 930376_934308
I mean its just like John would be against this because as you look
well, he'd also say it's that it's not supporting communities
well, what what if the system just does the community work for you ?
like it, I don't know because it knows +/. 954376_957298
afterwards it would give a report of this person likes this type of
you know like ma maximize the you know total happiness or like min
it's like It's like pandora or something . 968451_970043
a bunch of couches just show up and you're like yes no yes no and
yeah, <based on your> based on your selection this is the kind
you are a psycho . 979988_982576
yeah . 982576_984903
okay, so <what ki> what kind of like preferences do we want
price range . 995346_995943
yeah, because we have to make sure they're they can like go
like ah uh, you know what we can do ? 1002546_1008638
you know like how in the cultural model, we can just base like the
they +/. 1019730_1021718
they're definitely influencing preferences . 1021718_1022381
yeah, so pri price like you bought you duh really . 1022381_1028143
uh, location ? 1028143_1031978
slash distance I guess . 1031978_1036460
xxx or we can put it as like location or shipping options or
cause if you're like buying off like Macy's they'll deliver if for
yeah, you don't really care where the Macy's is that's delivering
you just care whether or not how much the delivery is and when they
so <how would you> how would you enter that in ? 1054005_1056561
would there be like a check box I okay with being having it
or you can say umm +/. 1064346_1068976
like who would be again against like getting a couch shipped
if the shipping cost too much and you can are within driving
like I guess someone's gonna +/. 1079088_1083968
but is that like isn't it like combine in the price ? 1083968_1090091
if you buy from Macy's doesn't it show you the prices ? 1090091_1092913
to ship it . 1092913_1093926
it doesn't show you with the shipping . 1093926_1095405
the shipping is added on . 1095405_1096348
another issue we have to have though like with letting them enter
John's like well Aruna has allergies and she says she won't get a
but then we could just as Annie said we could just have them rate
but then she might end up rating it really high on the preference
but that could be a factor . 1126778_1128618
yeah, she k +/. 1128618_1129681
she keeps saying that she won't get one with a cat but then like
yeah, like now you say that I'm wondering if even having them
or does it actually hurt ? 1144456_1146331
so you know how like people enter +//. 1146331_1148521
like think about this you know how we enter so much info about you
you meet someone but you like actually know like what kind of music
you know everything about them . 1157088_1158068
there's like less to talk about . 1158068_1159726
you can't really say you like the kind of music because you read it
so its gotta be like really clear that you stalked that person . 1166066_1169801
so you get to act like . 1169801_1173835
are you talking from experience ? 1173835_1175363
no speaking there was an XKCD comic that made me think of it . 1175363_1181188
xxx umm, so . 1181188_1193805
so like what if +//. 1193805_1197255
okay, so if each user had five like five preferences and then
wait, where the hell were +... 1224498_1226371
no, no, no . 1226371_1226818
they will add up everyone's number like per item . 1226818_1229408
but +... 1229408_1230753
but that would mean they would have to look at the same items . 1229761_1233096
but what happens if their preferences are different ? 1233096_1235088
like you can't like yeah +... 1235088_1237096
be, well the thing is like it's okay if their preferences are
like +... 1243321_1243920
but then you end up with getting data from some people and not
like if, if Aruna was the only one with allergies and she's the
yeah, you would be comparing apples and oranges . 1258793_1259971
yeah, you would only have one data point instead of five . 1259971_1261748
oh crap I'm speaking with a stats xxx . 1261748_1265730
but I I think that like price is like you know like
I think price and location . 1273650_1276888
those this I thought should be just separate like because it seems
yeah, so like +/. 1284420_1285610
like I think it should just be like a thing you can filter or sort
sort by price or by like distance . 1290518_1294833
or and then like maybe filter by method of delivery . 1294833_1301970
you know what it could do ? 1301970_1304210
if other people enter in like price and like location thing, so
or like if if something doesn't fit, it could just like like it
okay, well but then then again like when Aruna xxx can compromise .
yeah, because the thing is that she only compromises when because
if she's the one buying the couch then allergies rank really really
yeah, but 'cause yeah, because even when cat when Kate came in and
well, Aruna's like well maybe because it has cats and a little
jeff was like I don't like that . 1368833_1371736
so, like, it's kind of hard like unless they actually meet
how are we going to like simulate that ? 1387441_1389615
build a community around this . 1389615_1391955
well, could you do something like how google notebook, how you
so you can see like what she says like I like the color and price
then if you type in color or something you can see like what
but like what if she says I don't like the color ? 1416490_1418200
it's going to come up with +/. 1418200_1419760
yeah, but then you get to at least see that she doesn't like this
or you gotta have like two different like tagging fields like
then that will take time . 1435313_1437820
fitt's law . 1437820_1439828
but it would be like really convinient . 1439828_1442385
xxx . 1442385_1443896
because then you actually have to drag stuff into boxes . 1443896_1449140
rather than telling someone, hey, I don't like that color . 1449140_1455166
which one's faster, entering it in or like dragging it ? 1455166_1459731
it depends on how big the box and target you're looking at . 1459731_1463696
you are the equation . 1463696_1467665
but what if people just prefer dragging though no matter how long
the we have to study that . 1475640_1479388
uh, where I guess we can have positive and negative fields . 1479388_1486743
it's a good idea . 1486743_1489746
wait so, are we making the users enter in their preferences
I think that that's a good idea . 1496670_1498480
uh, what are like the preferences we're having ? 1498480_1501831
price range . 1501831_1503191
well it seems like because each item that they might be shopping
so, it's not going to be set . 1515211_1517416
but like, okay, we have to have like a set of preferences that
yeah, basic all like when +... 1519776_1521968
but why though ? 1521968_1523161
but like how how are we gonna how are we gonna have people entering
like say, say like . 1528938_1529835
they're not programmers . 1529835_1530465
they're not able to . 1530465_1531128
each each person enters in five top preferences and then
but like think of it like though, implementing the perspective like
it'll just be by the value . 1549240_1550635
you know, like you could designate price as like ten and then
but like if you don't set up the uh, implementation for
like suppose that there's nothing set up like how how is a not
like am I making sense ? 1586443_1588081
like +/. 1588081_1588795
yeah, you're talking about having predefined stuff versus uh
yeah, you have to have like some sort of options that their
could we like technically just not have them do preferences ? 1598905_1603903
'cause I mean, like if they leave a comment, obviously you don't
but if they do decide to leave a comment they're probably going to
so that's like google notebook then . 1626048_1627605
it is like google notebook slightly but we have to like umm, change
well, you can umm, compilate preferences on the fly based on
yeah, that's possible . 1638626_1640718
so if a like say if you bought if you looked at a couch and you
it's gonna look to the page to find the price . 1651018_1652280
<look through> look through the page find the key points, try
the only problem with that is that it's it doesn't give you a list
could you +/. 1676748_1677528
but it it could like, you can once you figure out what people
just like John prefers couches like you can say like according to
john prefers couches within this price range . 1692251_1695023
he prefers couches around Shadyside and this color . 1695023_1700686
that way the problem with that approach right, generating the list
so, you rank, you rate it like a two out of five even though if it
so right now the system would look at it and say he doesn't like
so you end up with false data . 1732756_1735310
couldn't you do somethign like +/? 1735310_1738031
could you also support the explicit data entry ? 1738031_1741021
well, you can, I guess . 1741021_1743910
you just need to figure out how it fits into the work flow . 1743910_1746615
well, what about something like you know google notebook how you
well, what if you could also have other features where you could
like so instead of having to enter something like manually, the
that would be kind of cool . 1777443_1780213
like that would be really cool . 1780213_1781540
it would be really time consuming but it would probably be faster
it wouldn't be that time consuming either, like, you could just
and then you click on one of them and it has everything . 1800881_1802970
it's like, you don't have to like click, you can just pull your
yeah, kind of like any thing like up here . 1807355_1809760
it has +/. 1809760_1810705
yeah, kind of like up here where it has like and arrow and then you
yeah . 1815170_1815836
you can actually save time by not highlighting . 1815836_1818971
just right click over the word and then you can generate an n best
yeah, yeah . 1824601_1826791
I'm sorry . 1826791_1829463
I'm sorry man . 1829463_1831405
you just said n best list . 1831405_1832716
