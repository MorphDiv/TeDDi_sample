oops . 2580_2730
then we have to make a sided . 4670_7350
why do you think you have to make a two sided . 9540_11480
so we can't we have to flip . 11900_14540
we gotta get to work in the pool . 18140_20590
it's gonna be a long time with the glue girl . 21080_24510
oh nice . 27180_27390
so can you explain it to me . 30340_35120
the whole classes that you did . 35540_37190
this one was just copy core . 38870_40460
then I flipped it over . 40480_42210
and . 42940_43110
flipped it down . 43390_44330
three . 47850_48150
oh that's . 48860_49260
this . 49590_49810
Ising that's . 51040_51430
okay . 53110_53250
so you flipped this one down . 53600_56500
here . 56550_56820
yeah . 57330_57430
okay . 57980_58100
you thought about flipping . 58140_59070
yeah . 60400_60510
I to see . 60760_61890
okay . 63070_63310
okay . 65830_65930
how did you know how it looked like . 66180_67740
do you have a no you didn't . 72420_77070
you just did it in your head . 77880_78790
&-um . 79340_79480
one of these . 80180_80590
and looked . 81220_82080
and then I dragged it over there . 82520_83790
and then I went in the right spot . 84090_85820
so you had one inside . 86290_87430
no I didn't . 88400_88780
you . 88800_88950
didn't you just did it in your head . 89070_90230
can you tell us how you did it . 91660_93020
&-um . 94180_94310
I used one of these that was &-um separate not these . 95680_99540
and then I flipped it over . 100230_101830
and . 102380_102510
then I dragged it over to this part . 102560_104220
and then glue it off . 104240_105100
and how_about the other . 105750_106460
like over in here . 109200_109780
mhm . 109800_110010
these ones I just knew how they were gonna go . 110730_112590
oh . 112780_112950
you did . 113000_113190
mhm . 113640_113820
mhm . 114410_114660
they're the only ones that I had problems with . 115310_117470
very nice . 120950_121270
great . 121410_121710
why did you select these colors . 122140_123830
you like them the most . 126680_127350
mhm . 127540_127870
they're most brightest . 128110_129110
okay . 132590_132830
it almost matches . 133680_134350
yeah . 134990_135190
how did you . 138260_138710
how are you . 138940_139430
&-uh how are you deciding where these go on . 139540_144390
the second one . 145480_145970
well . 146190_146310
'cause I'm looking at this squeal . 147060_149190
and . 150380_150540
oh . 150970_151060
is this a is this like this one . 151660_153590
yeah .
'cause it's the exact same . 154900_156510
but . 156700_156900
uhhuh . 157130_157230
it was supposed to like make something different that matches . 157460_161060
uhhuh . 161770_161830
and I just said I wanted to do a sideways flip . 162180_165130
so it would look like this . 165380_166640
I see . 168120_168510
okay . 169030_169180
so you're doing a sideways flip . 169200_170870
and then you put that up there . 171640_172620
so you know what's there . 172690_173860
mhm . 173880_174170
and when . 176780_177230
I put . 177400_177820
good job . 181120_181620
the . 182140_182300
school takes forever . 182400_183260
don't mind . 183730_184170
I don't mind . 184960_185350
I'll just go this is green . 185950_187380
and put it green . 187640_188190
this is blue . 188870_189540
I put it blue . 189800_190420
this is green . 190770_191300
I'll put it green . 191510_192110
this is green . 192500_192970
I put it green . 193430_193870
this is blue . 194070_194710
a put a blue . 194880_195610
this is green . 195790_196410
a a put a green . 196870_198260
this is green . 198600_199100
and put a green . 199240_199640
this is blue . 199870_200540
I mean green . 201160_201860
rule of . 201880_202180
put a green blue . 202390_202990
alright . 203410_203620
I . 204200_205310
think I wasn't taking . 204200_205110
so can you ask Danny I think Jane was on standby . 206030_208760
I I I'm afraid . 209560_210430
so can you ask her again . 210770_211660
oh the whole thing . 212150_212660
okay . 214670_214940
well Danny can you explain to us again . 215520_217420
why are you . 217500_217870
why are you doing against the window . 218620_219780
I I kind of forgot . 220560_221420
can you ask it again . 221900_222740
I I'm sorry . 223110_223500
yeah . 223550_223670
what . 223840_223950
because &-um because you can then you you can see the more
so . 235580_235730
you're so you're but why would you want to . 235800_238740
why would why again would you want the &-uh colors on this other
because when you do an up down clip you could then you could do the
so when you do an uptown flip . 253740_255420
oh okay . 255800_256269
&-um . 258860_258970
so you why would you want to do an uptown flip in you in your foot
because . 267430_267630
&-um then you can it would be the . 268330_273180
same . 274440_274530
so <the core> the core clear where you could see the back of it
the core square would be the same . 280060_281300
and how does that help you on your qui family though . 281980_283840
because you could tell how to how . 288080_290210
&-um . 291500_291570
like if you did the up down flip you would over what what was
oh okay . 305410_305620
are you planning to use an up down flip from your quilt . 305860_308550
family . 309220_309620
oh why . 310760_312260
why why do you want to use an up down flip . 312380_314190
'cause then you can see the other side . 315840_317750
and it . 317880_318180
uhhuh . 318650_318750
makes a different design . 318810_319920
makes a different design . 320180_321060
I see . 321280_321510
does it you think it's more interesting when you make a different
well it's the same . 327110_328070
it's the same . 328350_329060
it's the same kind of &-um design . 330190_334460
but <it's a> it's a different &-um Pi picture . 334700_339390
oh oh I see it's the same design on the core square . 340460_343940
but then when you flip it it's kind of makes a difference . 344550_346620
alright . 347990_348140
what are you gonna do now with that . 348910_350100
you are you done color . 350460_351450
color that with Kevin's blue because it it's . 352110_355390
oh it's lighter blue than the others . 357690_359060
uhhuh . 359530_359630
good . 359960_360140
alright . 360960_361110
well that was a good idea . 361500_362240
that was pretty clever to think of this window . 362320_363950
the &-um it's a that we're making for our parents . 364420_367460
oh . 368940_368980
or our Christmas presents . 369340_370410
oh . 371060_371090
that's can see almost finished . 374220_375930
is it is this . 377260_378030
oh I see this is the &-uh . 378690_379830
yeah . 379880_379940
is this what the class decided would . 380000_382190
no . 382500_382660
Mrs Curtis made that one . 382780_383900
and that she picked with what we're making . 384240_386580
and everybody's Cing hers . 386660_387910
just copying that's . 388150_390070
oh okay . 390500_390950
so you're using that as a model . 391580_392780
yeah . 393190_393350
so . 394390_394540
are the parents going to visit your classroom . 394940_397420
and . 397550_397660
see . 397700_397760
no . 398090_398230
we're gonna take it home . 398280_399060
uhhuh . 399570_399700
everybody's going to take . 399910_400990
one home . 401140_401470
mhm . 402400_402630
and Miss Curtis wants it everyone done by today . 403820_407060
so she can get (th)em laminated tomorrow . 407560_408840
oh she's gonna do the lamination like that to make it . 410350_412630
smooth . 412840_413070
there's somebody . 413390_414110
lemonade . 414600_414790
too great . 414940_418220
finished . 418560_418640
great . 418800_418990
uhhuh . 419320_419430
not finished quite yet . 421900_423000
uhhuh . 423550_423630
I just can can you . 424350_426980
show us &-uh what this is the core . 427630_432380
which one is the core square . 432450_433500
yeah . 433580_433730
which one is the core square . 433800_434900
I think it's maybe the Core square . 438920_441010
but I'm not sure . 441220_441950
this that one up in the corner . 443430_444740
yeah . 444910_445020
this one . 445200_445450
I'm not sure though . 445810_446350
okay . 446970_447070
whoops . 447730_447900
so she did that . 448810_449660
and then . 449950_450180
huh . 458180_458290
right there . 458490_459790
okay . 461270_461540
so this . 464310_464540
okay . 466470_466660
this maybe is a core square . 466870_468660
you're saying or no . 468680_469900
that may be the core square . 469920_471140
and this would be if we looked at this one in relation to that . 471500_474860
sideways flip . 475160_475500
a sideways sideways flip like that . 476400_479390
is that it . 480810_481230
let me think it's hard for me to picture sideways flip . 481800_486430
how_about but where would the white one be there if it did a
it'd be be in that . 493670_494570
where would it be corner . 495410_495980
it'd be up here or up here . 496350_498550
oh . 499280_499340
are you thinking diagonal flip like this or sideways . 499360_502390
are you . 503910_504060
I don't know what kind of look it would take . 505840_507500
uhhuh . 507810_507860
you're not sure what kind of foot . 508500_509510
do you . 511700_511920
think how how many two by two designs are on this . 512039_515340
field strip . 515830_516419
you know many different ones or how many . 525840_527220
no . 527240_527360
to how many . 527440_527900
and . 527920_530960
then how many . 528080_528550
total . 528640_528830
okay . 529110_529350
twelve twelve . 541780_543550
what twelve . 543950_544780
what two designs . 544990_545690
well show me one . 546590_547470
no . 548910_548980
I always count <course first> course first . 549040_550590
yeah . 550710_550860
okay . 551080_551200
yeah . 551380_551510
okay . 552290_552420
and things you write about four course . 553460_558510
this this is like one course square . 559750_561540
uhhuh . 561730_561940
and so and go around one two by two . 562540_564790
decide
