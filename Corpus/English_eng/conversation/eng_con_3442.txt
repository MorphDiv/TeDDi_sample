and it's then that he gets toppled over by the dog with the bees .
and like then like a hawk comes .
and like then the boy like gets up on a rock .
and like the branches <that he were> that he was holding they
and then like the deer like ran toward the end .
and they fell down .
<and they like> I don't know what's this is about .

where +...
and then they are falling in .
and little boy is all right .
and he sees the log .
then he said to the dog quiet .
and then they go over .
and then they see the frog .
<and it's then that they see> and it's then that the boy sees
and little boy took one home .
www .
like the boy looks like he's like happy that he has a pet frog .
and like then when he was sleeping the frog escaped .
and like then when he wakes up he is like where did frog go ?
he's saying where did the frog go ?

how does he feel ?

www .
and then he looks in his boot .
and he can't find him .
and then the dog gets his head stuck .
<and then> and in this over here little boy like is probably
and the like dog is probably getting scared like where did he go ?
and then like he jumps down .
and little boy looks scared .
and then he breaks the glass .
and it's then the dog's happy .
but the boy is sad .
or he's mad .
he probably thinks why did you break that ?

they just like yell into the woods .
and here he is yelling down there .
and the dog is probably playing with the bees .
and then the thing came up .
and he probably went ow .

and like the dog's still crying .
so that's why he has his hands on his nose ?
yeah .
like something came <and went and> and bit him on the nose .
he went ow ow !
yeah it must have really hurt .
then like the dog gets the bee hive down .
and then I guess the bees like are like going to chase him .
and then little boy looks like he's looking up in the tree .
and then he falls down by the owl .
or by this .
you know what ?
I was wondering something back here .
is he saying something when he's looking in that hole ?
yeah .
he's probably saying his name .
oh yeah .
like say his name was well like greenie .
he's saying like greenie are you in there ?
greenie would be a nice name for him .
yeah because he is like all green .
and then he falls down either like because from the owl or from
and then the dog starts going like ah !
<and then like> and then the owl chases him .
and then he gets up <there> like there .
he has his hands by his mouth .
yeah he's saying greenie !
oh yeah .
and like then those things they happen to be antlers on a deer .
and like then the deer started like charging .

and like then like the deer stops .
and he falls in .
oh he falls in ?
yeah .
he's like ah: !
now what could the same picture be about ?
you think maybe it could be one picture .
oh it is .
yeah .
look .
and then it goes down there .
you're right because these lines are connected .
well it's not too good .
no you're right .
they sort of stop but they're more connected than the other ones
I think this just sort of shows us the rest of the forest right ?
really nothing happening there .
but there is the rest of the pond .
yeah .
you're right that is the rest of the pond there .
I hadn't noticed that .
but instead of that <they kind of put> they put this here .
they used two pages .
yeah .
and here he falls in .
and then he founds out that it's not too deep .
no ?
and look he has his hand up to his ear .
I wonder why ?
maybe probably he's listening to something .
and like then he tells the dog ssh .
and then he goes over there .
and he sees the frog .
and then he sees the frog had babies .
and he's probably happy .
who's happy ?
him .
yeah I bet he is .
it was then that he would take the frog .
mhm .

yeah saying thanks or something like that .
I wonder why he's telling him thanks .
because they gave him a baby .
