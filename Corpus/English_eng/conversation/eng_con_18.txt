on a windy night about ten o'clock a policeman was walking .
and he saw a man leaning in the doorway .
the man was named Jimmy .
the police asked him what he was doing .
and he told that him he was waiting for a friend .
the friend was Bob, an old friend of twenty years .
then the police went on his way .
and finally, a man came up .
tall man came up .
about the time that Jimmy said he would come up .
and then he went across the street .
saw this figure, old figure .
they had been not together for twenty years .
so he saw this figure of this man .
and he went .
and asked .
Jimmy had a peculiar scar on his eyebrow too .
and he went .
and asked him +"/.
+" are you Jimmy ?
and he said +"/.
+" yes Bob .
+" I knew you would come after all these years .
and they were standing in the dark .
and Bob said that +"/.
+" the place where we used to go is not here anymore .
they were talking about the place .
told the policeman it had been torn down .
and so when Bob got there he knew it wasn't there anymore .
so they went to a place that he knew was there .
and when he looked in the light at the man, he says +"/.
+" no .
+" you're not Jimmy .
+" you're somebody else .
and he said somebody that, I guess the police must have been
so he didn't have the heart to <tell him that about> tell the
so he didn't have the heart to tell him .
that he was going to be arrested .
and he told the policeman .
sent the policeman to arrest him .
and this Jimmy, .
no this Bob had been for years and years out in the West .
and they wanted to know when they first met how had the West been
and he said it had done him well .
and so then he said something about “bye thanks” or something,
this happened in Murfreesboro Tennessee, at a school,
we would have recesses .
and kids would play .
and when we played they would have rings that we played in .
and every recess we looked forward to coming out of the school
and that was three friends .
and we would always try to jump in the rings before anybody else .
so they could form a circle around .
and they would play things like Little_Sally_Walker or
and little things that were really African oriented because we knew
and our parents were older .
and we enjoyed hearing them tell stories of slavery .
and how the kids used to play then .
so we kind_of copied that .
and start playing .
and answering .
some one would answer .
one of the girls would call the story out .
+" have you seen my cow ?
and we said +"/.
+" the old cow's dead .
the other two or three who was playing .
and then we'd do a little dance .
we'd just shake ourselves, our hips and things .
so that was the first introduction since we didn't have books on
taken from the people that we actually knew that hearing them talk
so that was what we enjoyed a whole lot .
