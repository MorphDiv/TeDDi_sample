exciting isn't it ? 2325_2905
it is so exciting . 3025_3745
&=laughs:multiple coming from the back forward are the blue sheet for today and the handout which I promised you from King . 4545_16125
the reference not king as in king of some country . 17825_22265
on +... 24825_25365
the height equivalent to a theoretical transfer unit quiet please . 27945_32525
height equivalent to a theoretical transfer unit and the height equivalent to a theoretical plate . 34245_40605
so that's just some fun reading for you . 41105_44125
(0.5) &=walks_to_microphone I really wanna go over here and &{l=SINGING feelings &}l=SINGING oh sorry . 47865_52265
&=laughs:multiple (0.4) but I'm gonna restrain myself . 57665_59145
twenty two we had done all that example we had gotten the height of the column calculated it out and then I had gone through solute three concentrations down at the bottom . 60085_75285
(0.5) your new mass balance I did not do but that is carried over onto this sheet twenty three . 81155_90095
(0.5) there is this one point that I wanna make sort_of backing up and I guess I'll do that first which is the log mean driving force . 92895_107715
okay so let's start with this . 108355_110715
we're doing absorption or stripping columns packed columns we have fluid flowing no equilibrium stages we want transfer between the two phases liquid and gas . 112615_124235
and we had those assumptions CEL right ? 126175_131535
so this was constant flow rates &=writing:board we don't have any more equilibrium stages and this one it can be linear +... 132705_147565
equilibrium &=writing:board or not . 150525_155465
for this particular case for the simplest case I'm gonna just give you a quick equation you can use instead of having to do the integration . 156305_163805
okay and that's what the log mean driving force +//. 164965_166785
have you done heat exchangers yet ? 166965_168405
xxx .
no ? 169465_171085
we're doing it now .
oh you're doing it now . 171725_173065
so have you done the log mean driving force for a heat exchanger ? 173285_176285
no . 176525_176825
not yet .
okay . 177585_178725
well you will and you'll enjoy it . 179025_183985
&=laughs:multiple &=writes:board (0.4) so the log mean driving force (0.5) it's just +//. 189265_196665
remember that integral that we had for the driving force one over Y minus y@l star ? 197085_201045
that's the driving force for &~absorp absorption ? 201505_203705
remember that ? 204785_205505
so this is just if you're if they're two straight lines <you can> &~r you can integrate that area very simply . 206085_213665
I'll show you how . 214305_214825
(0.6) so the end result of this will be an equation and I'll just take you through how we'd come up with that . 221505_225785
we have a certain y@l in and a y@l out and a linear equilibrium line (0.5) you then have a particular x@l in and x@l out +... 226865_246065
and if we're running a countercurrent system the two points on the operating line will be here and here and it will be straight if we have constant flow rates . 249065_258045
so this is linear equilibrium and constant flow rates no equilibrium stage (be)cause it's a packed column . 258865_264405
so with these two systems sorry those two assumptions you come out with a system that looks like this +... 265105_271205
now what you normally have to do is then get these y@l-s +... 274245_276805
and these y@l stars and that's your driving force right ? 280665_285045
and do that equation what equation is that ? 285525_288365
on twenty +//. 289165_290505
top of twenty two that integral one over Y minus y@l star DY okay so I'm gonna eliminate that now and just say let's call this delta . 290865_302485
okay and let's just call +//. 303825_306265
so that's just Y minus y@l star it's just delta . 306785_309105
and we'll call this one over here this Y minus y@l star delta in and this one down here delta out . 309605_322425
just by the y@l in we'll call that delta in and the y@l out we'll call that delta out . 323805_329305
(0.6) so if you plot delta +... 335865_337365
from let's say delta out delta in from y@l out which is the low concentration to y@l in (0.8) looks something like that right ? 340465_361065
for what I've drawn there approximately . 361645_363725
okay ? 364435_364695
it's a straight line . 364795_366255
(0.9) so this slope is equal to the change in delta with Y and that is constant . 370995_385055
okay (0.6) so now if I +...
if I have my LC equation where I had G over let's say KGAP integral from y@l out to y@l in I can change this instead of one over Y minus y@l star I'll just put one over delta (0.5) DY . 398585_418625
and now I'll just convert variables so everything's in terms of delta (0.16) so this is from delta out delta in one over delta (0.5) and now I have to put in a conversion (0.5) this constant that we're gonna multiply by is delta in minus delta out for y@l in minus y@l out . 422265_452245
(0.7) so I've gotta convert from DY I solve for DY right that's d@l delta over DY is equal to that quotient right . 477785_485985
so I just solve for DY and stick it in for DY so I get out this y@l in minus y@l out over delta in minus delta out d@l delta +... 486385_500205
and now I integrate that we still have this G over KGAP out here . 503745_511205
I integrate that I get pull out this y@l in minus y@l out over delta in minus delta out (be)cause that's a constant . 512165_523725
that integral is just the natural log of deltin@n over deltout@n (0.7) and now if I rearrange this +... 525395_540715
this is all getting to the equation this is merely to help you understand where this equation came from I do not expect you to rederive this . 545135_551415
you get down to LC is equal to G over KGAP or KYA times y@l in minus y@l out over (0.4) Y minus y@l star log mean . 554525_576805
or del_log_mean@q . 578145_584405
where Y minus y@l star log mean is equal to del_in@q minus del_out@q over the natural log of del_in@q over del_out@q . 584015_602175
this log mean thing is just that . 604295_606735
it always has that form of you take the difference of the two in the numerator and then it's the log of the quotient of the two in the denominator natural log the quotient of the two yes ? 606865_617325
&-um on your graph I seen where you got delta from how that was &~ya Y minus y@l star . 617685_622345
but is &~del delta in is that y@l in just like the distance of y@l in to the equilibrium line ? 622625_628145
right delta in is y@l in minus y@l in star . 628185_632465
it's just that +/. 632865_634025
oh ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ Y minus ⌋ y@l star at that one end and Y minus y@l star at the other end . 634645_638105
(0.6) is this okay ? 639165_643885
(0.4) the whole point is that if you know y@l in and y@l out and then you could find y@l in and y@l out star that means you'll have delta in and delta out and then you can just calculate the length . 647805_661145
there is no you know graphing or integrating or anything like that it's just a straightforward equation +... 661495_666395
the only thing weird that you have to worry about is if the two deltas are equal . 668995_676255
then you get a zero up here and like a zero down here and the thing blows up . 677855_683855
so if they're precisely equal which is really an easy integral to do you just have to realize that so if you ever get it that it's zero just realize it's a straight horizontal line and you just have to take either of the dels and multiply it by the Y okay ? 684745_698585
(0.4) so that's the only caveat for this . 699505_704525
caveat that's a good word . 705905_707025
&=laughs:multiple that's an excellent word . 707825_709145
any other words you want to throw up here I can use . 709445_712185
caveat wow . 713585_714685
there's no quid_pro_quo that's for sure . 716545_718825
&=laughs:multiple I never knew what that meant anyway . 719225_720925
&=laughs:multiple &-um (0.4) so (0.4) so let's +... 722365_733105
remember our example that we did +..? 734945_736645
right ? 739845_740325
and we remember this ? 741105_743545
we got &-uh LC is equal to twelve point something feet twelve point five ? 743905_749705
yeah twelve point five feet . 750625_754265
let's do it and pretend that that equilibrium is linear when it really isn't we'll just take the del y@l star one end minus the other end &=writing:board forty which is G pound moles per hour over the one point five feet squared is a crosssectional area so that's now the G . 754695_784675
and then we had the KYA down here pound moles per hour per feet squared . 793075_799575
and now we have to multiply by this thing which is y@l in minus y@l out so it's zero point zero seven minus zero point zero one over that Y minus y@l star log mean which is +//. 802635_817115
and I'll write it down . 817915_818655
zero point zero seven minus zero point zero four two minus zero point zero one minus zero +... 819275_827715
over the natural log of zero point zero seven minus zero point zero four two over zero point zero one minus zero . 831435_840355
&=writing:board and that gives twelve point seven feet . 848705_851725
so we went through all of that graphing that stuff (0.7) hard to do here we just assume it was &~line even though the equilibrium line curves I do it &~sp specifically curved in there so it should be off a little bit that's how much it's off . 853325_873345
okay ? 874745_874905
questions about that +..? 878485_879445
seem okay ? 883545_884145
(0.10) .
excuse_me ?
(0.4) how do you get the y@l in y@l star in this example ? 889445_896645
&-uh you just go over here and y@l in is like point zero one and the y@l star is zero and then for the input it's point seven and you go down and it's point zero four two . 897385_907385
you just go go over and go down alright (0.7) other questions ? 907505_918005
(0.6) did I answer your question ? 924505_925485
is that okay ? 926745_927225
okay . 928245_928525
everyone clear on that ? 929265_929925
(0.4) yes ? 932525_934105
what is the units on the &-uh seven point two ? 934385_936405
&=writes:board &-uh pound mole per hour per feet squared feet cubed isn't it ? 937445_944985
or is it feet squared ? 945105_945765
cubed +/.
+, feet cubed right ? 947445_950585
yeah thank you . 951185_952105
(0.19) okay that was the assumption of +... 971795_980315
linear equilibrium and constant flow rates . 980795_987455
(0.4) if we no longer have linear equilibrium then we have to go back and graph that one over Y minus y@l star do the integral of that to get <that nog> that number of theoretical transfer units based on overall gas phase resistance . 992185_1013305
and now what we're moving to is what &~a if we don't have the constant flow rates . 1015905_1019865
okay ? 1021075_1021395
(0.5) so what we did is +... 1021575_1027275
define the solute free flow rates (0.14) and I apologize I shoulda started with that simple log mean driving force equation . 1030905_1052905
but I kinda like to do it after you do the &~f the first equation so you know where it's coming from and just plug in for the simplification . 1053565_1058785
now I'm gonna do the more complicated one . 1089165_1089185
so we have G is equal to GS over one minus Y and L is equal to LS over one minus X .
so our flow rates are now in terms are solute free . 1089585_1092765
and I think we went through and and derived the concentrations . 1094065_1100185
capital Y was solute free and one minus sorry Y over one minus Y and X was X over one minus X . 1106395_1118475
(0.9) okay ? 1120275_1127395
(0.15) and we came down with the fact that if you had a curve now in units of X capital X and capital Y +... 1142105_1153705
with the equilibrium data (0.7) plotted as capital X and capital Y you can't do little X versus little Y on that plot you have to convert to capital X and capital Y . 1157155_1180095
okay ? 1180735_1180855
so if you do capital X and capital Y plot the equilibrium data now if you do your operating line +... 1183305_1191445
the slope of that is gonna equal LS over GS . 1195725_1200885
okay ? 1202145_1202525
yes ? 1203265_1204765
is our equilibrium line straight or curved ?
doesn't matter . 1204865_1208245
okay . 1208685_1209565
okay .
I do a curve purposefully to say that it can be linear or nonlinear . 1210325_1213825
(be)cause &~yo what you're gonna do is get those Y +//. 1214745_1217865
now it's gonna be capital Y and capital y@l stars and then you convert them and plug them into the equation and that's what I'm gonna show you . 1218125_1224625
okay +..? 1225585_1228985
okay .
(0.7) .
Mister_Burns ?
yes ? 1230965_1237605
&~wh what again are LS and GS ? 1238155_1239735
&=writes:board LS and GS are the solute free streams . 1240055_1244335
they're the streams of inert gas and inert liquid that are flowing in without the solute . 1244935_1251595
okay (0.8) so now we can just plot the op line the operating line and the equilibrium data on our capital X capital Y plot . 1252315_1274855
find capital y@l star and capital y@l-s +... 1279155_1284735
you then actually need to convert to the small y@l star and the small Y . 1288335_1295075
(0.4) you plug into +... 1297695_1299995
a new equation which I will now give you . 1302915_1305575
okay ? 1306575_1306735
(0.9) and don't forget this conversion you can just rearrange that equation and small Y is equal to capital Y over one plus capital Y and X is equal to capital X over one plus capital X . 1317905_1333685
(0.9) and what I handed out what did I hand out ? 1334565_1345645
what'd I just hand out ? 1347395_1348175
+, I'll get it I got it +... 1348855_1351915
I handed out now that problem redone with X capital X and capital Y . 1352395_1363615
okay ? 1364695_1364775
the op line's a little different I used the other equilibrium line the solid line now not the dashed line and I plot the op line for both A and B . 1365535_1375235
okay ?
(0.16) I have to do a new mass balance to cut to the chase this is what I'm gonna give you for variable L over G the new line is just now GS outside instead of G GS instead of G and you have an extra one minus y@l squared in the denominator . 1392965_1414985
okay ? 1415425_1416885
you would think it would just be a one minus Y because that would just be replacing G &~str straightaway but it's not you have a squared in there and I'll show you why . 1417305_1427405
okay ?
and you can see you just get slightly different results . 1428805_1431865
(0.7) new mass balance we have a particular cut at Z and Z plus delta z@l coming out as g@l at Z plus delta z@l going in is g@l at Z flow rate changes now so you have to keep track of the different flow rate going in and going out_of the stage it's going to change . 1438825_1463765
concentration going in is y@l at Z this is y@l at Z plus delta z@l the liquid side is going I don't care and this is the flux . 1465285_1474485
(0.10) mass balance now y@l at Z g@l at Z minus y@l at Z plus delta z@l g@l at Z plus delta z@l is equal to the flux of A times little A times delta z@l that's the same thing as before . 1484715_1507455
and now you take the limit and rearrange things and the only difference you have and here we're gonna plug in just to be the same NA is equal to KGP times Y minus y@l star the only difference now is when we do this &=points_to_board difference y@l at Z plus delta z@l times g@l at Z plus delta z@l minus y@l at Z plus g@l at Z divided by delta z@l . 1511105_1536725
before we had just DY DZ now we have DYG DZ . 1538185_1546665
because G is changing &~t you cannot pull it out of that derivative . 1547585_1551865
this is exciting isn't it ? 1554185_1555485
&=laughs:multiple you guys just &~d there's nothing like a good derivation on a Friday right ? 1556245_1560485
&=laughs:multiple am I wrong ? 1560845_1562025
yes . 1562325_1562665
I'm wrong ? 1563345_1563925
&=laughs:multiple .
I didn't mean to say that out loud &=laughs:multiple .
you just thought it really loud and then heard it . 1567395_1569855
&=laughs:multiple &=laughs that happens to me a_lot . 1573835_1577395
there's a_lot_of things I don't mean to say out loud +... 1577515_1579395
KGAP Y minus y@l star . 1579855_1586735
(0.8) okay ? 1588135_1594655
(0.9) so let me just put in what that derivative is +... 1603265_1606085
(be)cause this is where that one minus y@l squared comes from DDZ of YG is DDZ of Y GS over one minus Y . 1606725_1624105
which if you do the +//. 1625685_1628505
what is it ? 1629165_1629465
the denominator times the derivative of the numerator minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator all over the denominator squared . 1630025_1636785
and I'll save you the time . 1637605_1639705
GS over one minus Y squared DY DZ . 1641385_1660005
(0.17) so that's what you gotta plug in due to your extremely short attention span I will now skip right to the end &~unle unless there's popular demand otherwise which I fear there is not going to be . 1664585_1681385
that gives you just GS and you have that KGAP down here you're still integrating from y@l out to y@l in . 1683435_1692875
it's one over you've got that Y minus y@l star is still there DY but you have this correction term &~mon one minus Y squared . 1693515_1705655
it is not just replacing this with GS or its definition it comes from the YG varying and then taking the derivative of that . 1705865_1716265
(0.7) questions on that ? 1717425_1724405
<I have a question> .
will you repeat what you just said about the varying ? 1727865_1731865
I don't know the very last thing <that you> .
oh yeah it's this this term we're taking the derivative of it that's where we get that one minus Y squared +/. 1734905_1742145
oh ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ in the ⌋ denominator . 1743125_1743605
it's not just +//. 1744265_1744925
the equation we had before was this and this so it's not just saying oh G is equal to GS over one minus Y let me just stick that in there . 1745125_1753485
you you can't do that . 1753845_1754665
okay ? 1756365_1756545
(0.4) any other questions ? 1756805_1761845
(0.15) what am I erasing here ? 1776845_1777645
so if I go back to the example &=writing:board and I do the conversions now x@l in was zero so that's zero over one minus zero which is zero . 1778045_1801485
y@l in was zero point zero seven now I convert it that's one over +//. 1804165_1810845
sorry point zero seven over one minus point zero seven . 1811245_1814085
what a lecture to translate it's going to be all letters and numbers . 1816045_1818905
sorry about that +... 1819865_1820345
&=laughs:multiple zero point zero seven five (0.8) which reminds me of that time I was out on route seventy five and I was driving &~alon oh sorry . 1822795_1838055
&=laughs:multiple &~tr trying to get in there non technical stuff . 1839335_1844555
one minus zero point one (0.7) what do you notice about low concentrations of Y ? 1845825_1858985
Y is <approximately equal to the> capital Y ? 1859765_1863885
how does Y compare to capital Y when the concentration is low . 1863885_1869285
I'm sorry what did you say ? 1869665_1870445
I said Y is approximately equal to the capital Y . 1871445_1873885
yes . 1874065_1874405
they're about the same . 1875505_1876625
once you &~g start getting up above point zero five it starts changing and up above point one is really concentrated . 1877825_1885505
okay ? 1886285_1886425
so typically &=writing:board five to point one . 1888345_1910945
why don't I give you an exact number ? 1911605_1912945
I can't . 1913225_1914085
if it's below point oh five almost always you get the same answer whether you assume dilute or concentrated . 1915305_1920005
between point oh five and point one it's usually off a little bit above point one it's usually you know significantly off five or ten percent . 1920985_1928585
(0.4) so now you can see on this new graph instead of plotting y@l in at point zero seven I plot it at point zero seven five . 1930025_1939485
(0.4) exciting huh ? 1943525_1944245

this slope if you draw it out is zero point seven eight +... 1995315_1999675
you then have to get GS which you don't have which is one minus y@l in g@l in . 2003355_2011975
which is twenty four point eight pound moles per hour per feet squared . 2013595_2020915
and then you know that LS Min is equal to zero point seven eight times GS . 2023265_2031265
which is nineteen point three +... 2034265_2037165
pound moles per hour per feet squared . 2041305_2043045
(0.8) which did I convert back ? 2050255_2052275
I did not and I should've and I don't have a calculator . 2052715_2057175
but you have to convert back that's L is equal to LS over one minus X . 2057855_2066875
(0.6) so you have to convert back the nineteen point three divided by one minus X what is the x@l in ? 2073785_2083205
oh it's zero . 2084085_2085165
(0.5) right so we're okay . 2086825_2092625
(0.4) questions ? 2093925_2097505
is LS .

per crosssectional area so it's like a velocity . 2112285_2115425
right this is the weird unit that I always forget pound moles per hour per feet squared . 2116505_2120985
it was that KYA that had the cube . 2122185_2123845
okay +/.

&-um just like the y@l-s are similar for dilute solution is &~i is it the same for L S and M ? 2137035_2143835
they're ⌈ the same ⌉ ?
⌊ yes ⌋ y@l-s or x@l-s are similar for dilute solution same thing . 2145435_2150515
this was zero so it doesn't matter it was all solute free coming in . 2150715_2155455
right ? 2156375_2156415
so it's pure water coming in so that's solute free . 2156955_2159115
okay .
(0.9) .
quiet please . 2170215_2171135
if you go through and then do part B (0.4) if you plug in all you have to find your Y +//. 2171755_2182095
capital y@l-s and capital y@l stars convert them to small y@l-s and small y@l stars . 2182575_2187275
you cannot not convert you will get the wrong answer . 2187715_2190855
you convert them and then you go forward and sum the integral you should get LC equals twelve point eight feet . 2192105_2199685

(0.9) questions ?
yes ? 2253705_2253945
&-um is this equation L equals LS over one minus X <I mean it's> or is it capital capital x@l in or small X ? 2254125_2263105
I know it doesn't matter for this case but . 2263225_2264885
well if I want l@l in then I use x@l in . 2265305_2267985
which is +/. 2268325_2269805
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.

so if that helps yes . 2271905_2272765
I was just writing it down in general terms . 2273145_2274765
but does it matter if that's the small X or the capital X ? 2274965_2277465
I mean I know it doesn't matter ⌈ in this case ⌉ . 2278105_2278945

&=laughs:multiple I will not pick on anybody unless I really get upset and then I will . 2299635_2303975
&-um any questions on that ? 2306555_2308295
we've done now a packed column . 2309575_2312055
we had &~assu these assumptions constant flow rates equilibrium stages linear equilibrium . 2312865_2317445
we no longer have equilibrium stages . 2318285_2319705
we do the simplification for linear equilibrium . 2320445_2322525
we then did the simplest case for nonlinear equilibrium . 2323185_2327285
then we went forward what happens if the flow rates aren't constants ? 2328085_2330485
these flow rates are changing because the solute is absorbing ten percent almost of the solute might absorb through the length of that column that's gonna be a big change in the flow rates . 2330605_2339965
turns out it doesn't affect our design very much because we come out with twelve point eight feet versus twelve point five . 2340765_2347405
and actually that is wrong . 2348105_2350865
this is an example of and it's in books it's an example of a little bit of knowledge is dangerous . 2352185_2358365
(be)cause what you should also do is this concentrated stream if we're taking into account these high concentrations of solute will actually do something which is called diffusion induced convection +... 2359485_2374845
+, mm +/.
+, whoa +/.
+, you did not cover this probably yet in mass transfer . 2377385_2380065
so we will cover it here . 2380585_2384725
it will be so much fun that you won't want me to stop in like six or seven minutes you'll want me to go on because it will be just riveting . 2385185_2394005
&=laughs:multiple right ? 2396565_2396745
yes .
and you won't want to go to heat and mass transfer because we're doing mass transfer here . 2397325_2402625
so what's the point ? 2403765_2404505
&=laughs:multiple alright so there's that heat thing so I guess you can go on there . 2405845_2410785
(0.15) oh what to teach you in this section +..? 2427305_2429545
what to do ? 2431565_2433805
what to do ? 2434005_2434485
lemme do it this way . 2434785_2435985
you will never stand for this derivation I know it . 2436345_2440245
&=laughs not today . 2440965_2441625
the weather's too nice so I'm gonna cut to the chase and I might come back and fill in some details on Monday Monday which is gonna be like probably dreary and rainy and and you'll all be depressed that the weekend is over so you'll have no other thoughts on your mind but you know depression and this class so I naturally make it kind of low key . 2441955_2465115
&=writes:board so we have LC I gave you the first equation which was KG oh sorry G over KGAP integral from y@l out to y@l in one over Y minus y@l star DY correct ? 2465505_2487405
this was for dilute solutions . 2490675_2494555
(0.8) if the flow rates +... 2496375_2504075
are not constant that's what we just did . 2506175_2509715
so that's LC is equal to it now we have to put a GS up there (0.4) KGAP integral from y@l out to y@l in one over +//. 2512225_2527045
now we have that one minus y@l squared term Y minus y@l star DY right ? 2527365_2536785
(0.13) that's only part right (be)cause you have to include diffusion induced &~diffu when my voice cracks will you write that down as sort_of like an accent on the syllables ? 2548745_2559565
&=laughs:multiple the diffusion induced convection . 2560425_2566825
this derivation usually takes a couple days complete explanation even when I teach graduate heat and mass transfer it takes a while for people to pick up so I'm gonna do it in like one and a half minutes right now verbally . 2571115_2583855
&=laughs:multiple you ready ? 2584455_2586195
no .
go .
(o)kay . 2587975_2588435
so heat if it's really hot and really cold over here heat goes that way right ? 2589955_2595955
yeah +/.
+, more heat goes it doesn't push anything right it's not a mass right ? 2597075_2600915
so if I have like a mass here a concentration high concentration low concentration . 2601495_2607435
it gets dilute those molecules just kinda diffuse over . 2608095_2611495
if I have a huge concentrated stuff here low concentration here now there's gonna be a_lot_of stuff moving . 2612035_2619335
if there's mass moving is that diffusion or convection ? 2620015_2623115
xxx .
I I don't know . 2626725_2627285
right ? 2627965_2628365
it's kind_of diffusion (be)cause it's moving by diffusion but the diffusion itself causes some convection of mass and if you were standing here if there were molecules here they keep getting &=gesture hit on this side by that concentrated stream . 2628525_2643985
so they might push or sweep along some other molecules . 2644665_2648165
that is diffusion induced convection . 2649085_2653285
only happens in very concentrated systems . 2653995_2656755
what's my time ? 2657975_2658455
anybody get my time ? 2659375_2660175
is that under a minute ? 2660435_2661155
it's about a minute and a half . 2661735_2663155
okay . 2664095_2664815
so what we accounted for was in the column these changing flow rates but we never accounted for this sweeping of those molecules along . 2665935_2676155
if we do that what you have to do is go back in and correct the mass transfer coefficient to include not only diffusion through that film layer but some convection through that film layer which you can calculate based on the diffusion . 2678945_2699945
if you do that the only thing that changes in this equation is you have LC we're using GS now (be)cause we're in concentrated regime KGAP integral y@l out to y@l in +... 2701745_2716105
<on the> &~deno on the bottom we have Y minus y@l star DY we have a correction one minus y@l squared for the nonconstant flow rate and on top we have an annoying term one minus Y star m@l . 2719985_2740845
which accounts for that diffusion induced convection . 2741245_2745465
and that what'd I call it ? 2748265_2750725
one minus y@l star m@l is +... 2751025_2753845
it's like a log mean driving force kinda thing it's one minus y@l star +... 2754845_2763805
minus one minus Y over LN of one minus y@l star over one minus Y . 2766695_2777495
alright &~a and I like to write it like this you can also just simplify the top which turns out to be Y minus y@l star and then put that over LN of one minus y@l star over one minus Y . 2780865_2795605
but to me I can't remember where it comes from whereas if I just remember <it's a> it's a log mean thing with a star in there then I can remember how to write that down . 2796245_2807725
(0.7) so what I'll do is depending on how I feel on Monday go into a little bit more detail on that term this is actually what you'll find in your book but it won't look like this . 2814785_2824025
I'm trying to get to where the book is and I'm trying to make that comparison okay ? 2824485_2829385
is that a question or a thank goodness we're done back there ? 2831025_2835005

yes . 2843185_2843385
