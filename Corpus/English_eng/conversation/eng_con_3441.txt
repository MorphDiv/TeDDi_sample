well this kid had this frog .
and then &-um see when he's asleep his frog escapes .
he wakes up and doesn't see him .
and he looks in his boots and looks out the window .
and then &-um his dog gets up to the window and looks .
and he's calling for him .
and he looks in the gopher hole .
he isn't there .
and he looks in <a> <a> a hole in a tree .
and there's an owl there .
then &-um <then he goes> then he's calling for him .
and there's a deer .
and then he chases him .
and then he falls off this cliff .
and he lands inside a pond .
and then &-um <he> <he> <he steps> he looks a little
then he finds his frog and with the kids .
and the he takes him away .
that's it .
<he's> he's looking at his frog .
and &-um he's just looking at his frog !
and then he falls asleep .
and the frog is gone .
and then the &-um boy is like uhoh !
his frog had escaped .
and then the he's looking in his boots .
and he looks out .
and there's nothing there .
and he's screaming out the window where are you ?
and the dog has <the> the &-um bottle on his head .
the dog falls out the window .
he says bad dog .
so I wonder how the boy feels there .
he probably feels mad .
and he broke the bottle .
and &-um then he's calling for him .
and then he's looking in the hole and calling .
and the dog's looking at a bee hive .
and then the bees come out_of the bee hive .
and a gopher comes out_of a hole .
he has his hands on his nose .
I wonder why .
it smells .
and <then> then the &-um bee hive falls down .
and then he climbs up a tree and looks in this hole .
is he saying something ?
<he> he's just looking .
and the owl comes out .
and he falls off the tree .
and the bees start chasing the dog .
and <then &-um> then &-um the boy is trying to run away from
and the he goes on top of <a> &-um a rock calling for him .
and he holds on to this branch .
but it's really the antlers for a deer and carries him .
I wonder how he feels now .
he's like ah: !
in the next picture he went over here when he fall off the cliff .
<and then> and then &-um +...
how did that happen ?
well he was stuck to the animal .
<then he> then he &-um ran over here and fell off .
and then he fell into a pond .
and the he looked over +...
and then &-um the dog was on his head .
and then +...
I wonder why he has his hand up to his ear .
oh <he hears> he hears frogs .
he looks over the log .
and there is <the> his frog .
and how does he feel now ?
happy .
and then he says goodbye and takes his frog .
one thing I know they don't feel happy <cause> cause this is
it's one of their babies .
so why don't they feel happy ?
cause their baby's getting stolen .
and they don't even care .
they're just sitting there like this
