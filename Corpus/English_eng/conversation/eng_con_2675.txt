okay +/. 209465_209705
+, okay ? 210025_210245
so it's goes +//. 210505_211105
it starts from DNA to RNA to proteins . 211265_213725

&-um replication . 224385_225225
+, right +/. 226285_226345
+, right ?
and then &-um it'll go on to to &-um . 226645_229705
but it it goes on to make proteins as well . 229845_231225
right it does . 231365_231925
and transposons are sort_of mysterious or what ? 232465_234945
transposons . 235425_236765
yeah I didn't really understand how it moves around the genome ⌊ xxx ⌋ . 236805_238965
⌈ yeah and it's really vague ⌉ . 239345_240265
⌊ &~wha I forget what &~th ⌋ what &-um . 240265_241765
the segments of DNA that move from one location to another in the genome . 241785_244665
discovered in nineteen forties but not accepted until later . 245865_248265
yeah .
I forget what ⌈ what I forgot what he said that about it ⌉ . 250125_250745
⌊ he said it was like a defective virus ⌋ so it can't get into a particle without a protein I didn't really understand like . 250745_256185
I remember when we were talking about there +//. 256665_258645
remember how we were talking about there're different &-um phases of like virus tacking <if it's> &-um if it's goes into the lytic cycle or the lysogenic cycle +/. 259005_267425
right +/. 267965_268005
+, right ?
and like . 268125_268465
he didn't really talk about that in class though did he ? 268485_270005
⌈ lytic and lysogenic ⌉ .
⌊ yeah <he never> &~men he never mentioned ⌋ the lytic ⌈ or the lysogenic ⌉ . 270025_273005
⌊ or the lysogenic xxx ⌋ .
⌈ the the ⌉ terms are mentioned in the lab book but we didn't go over it in class . 273145_275965
right he never talks about ⌊ it ⌋ . 276025_276885
⌈ okay ⌉ . 276885_277165
well &-uh the one of them is where DNA material is being inserted into the genome and then &-um it can stay dormant for a while which means that it never it +//. 277355_288115
gets expressed for a long time after several like replications of the cell . 288455_292995
so like this virus is being replicated along with the rest of the genome as it you know what I mean like when the cell divides and forms two and then something in the external environment signals the cell +//. 293345_306825
signals that virus to like start like producing its own &~vi like taking over the cell and like producing its own virus and things like that . 307245_315085
⌊ right ⌋ ? 315385_315405
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, so like that's when I +//. 315525_317405
that's what immediately what I think of when you say like it jumps from one part <of the> of the genome to the other part of the genome . 317445_322725
+, oh +/.
+, do you know what I mean ? 323065_323465
like that &~i maybe it's a sort_of like maybe he's like indirectly talking about &-um like the lysogenic versus lytic cycle . 323685_331685
do you know what I'm saying ? 332445_332985
like it +/. 333165_333405
+, ⌊ I thought ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ can go ⌉ from +/. 333565_334105
+, ⌊ sounds like it ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ different parts ⌉ of the genome . 334545_335285
but isn't lytic and lysogenic just whether it dies or not ? 335285_338345
whether the cell's destroyed after . 338485_340285
right . 342065_342285
because in in one condition in one case like the cell that's gets infected will explode and like whatever . 342285_350125
right ?
but like in another case it could be two or three cells that after several replications that it does that . 350765_356525
so what does that mean for the transposons ? 358265_359785
what like the thing is that like the transposons it &~s it says like it jumps from like from parts of the genome to other parts of the +/. 360245_366765
⌊ right ⌋ +/. 366865_367105
+, ⌈ genome ⌉ right ? 367285_369865
and like what I'm saying is that like during one of &~th either the lytic or the lysogenic cycle either like one of the cycles when it &-um DNA's inserted is inserted the cell automatically dies .
right ?
it +/. 379685_379785
+, ⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ automatically ⌉ jumps to the &~viru virus attacks the cell makes a cell produces the virus and like the protein coat and explodes right ? 380085_387105
but in the other cycle what can what it can do is it can &~in insert <that information> that information can go into the genome right ? 387185_394125
and like the cell will +//. 394385_395745
like the virus will stay dormant . 396005_397145
&~af and the &-um DNA may or may not be replicated during the +/. 398625_402245
+, ⌊ oops ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ next ⌉ couple phases and it could be replicated where like ⌊ &-um ⌋ . 402505_406865
⌈ are you talking &~ab ⌉ when you say the DNA do you mean the ⌊ transposons ⌋ ? 406865_408845
⌈ the the ⌉ transposon . 408905_409645
or the viral DNA . 409865_411385
right +/. 411745_411925
+, right this viral DNA will like be replicated along with the rest of the genome and now two cells have it now . 412085_418505
the virus . 418745_419305
⌊ but it hasn't ⌋ . 420025_420805
⌈ and like ⌉ it has +//. 420945_421485
it &~st the &-um virus still hasn't attacked the cell yet . 422065_424125
do you see what I'm saying ? 424905_425485
<so the> so the viral genes haven't been ⌊ translated ⌋ +/. 426005_430185
+, ⌊ you mean ⌋ ?
⌈ yeah ⌉ . 430665_430765
⌊ but they're there ⌋ ? 431545_432085
⌈ they have +//.
⌉ right they're ⌊ there ⌋ . 432185_432725
⌈ they ⌉ just moved about ⌊ in the genome ⌋ . 432845_433365
⌈ they've just moved ⌉ . 433365_434085
⌊ so like this gene ⌋ isn't expressed yet ⌈ but it's there ⌉ . 434085_435665
⌊ it yeah it's ⌋ it's still there . 435685_436265
right . 436465_436625
so like okay so cell number one right ? 436805_438725
yeah +/. 439045_439205
+, this is let's say it's just a bacteria it has circular DNA or whatever right okay it's got that DNA . 439325_444145
and then somehow like some virus gets inserted inside and its DNA's like that . 444465_449825
okay ? 450235_450475
and like in one cycle this DNA may take the cell and like make more of this DNA . 450555_456395
you know what I mean like make more of this DNA . 456735_459855
+, mhm +/.
+, and then it'll like burst . 461895_464615
you know what I mean like normal . 464895_465635
right ? 466195_466275
this is like &~mo &~th &~th this is like the case that you guys have been learning like it like infects the cell takes over <the cell> the cell bursts and like releases this thing . 466375_476515
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ this ⌋ virus right ? 476815_477415
and that's how the virus grows . 477465_478585
another case like what it could happen is that the cell this like viral DNA can like insert inself itself into the regular DNA . 479405_488265
okay ? 488965_489045
and like when this cell divides it's gonna form +... 489245_492345
two of these . 495005_495545
right ? 496305_496665
and like this viral DNA still hasn't like done what it's supposed to do yet . 496805_500945
do you know what I mean ? 501545_502105
like it's still in the genome . 502125_503185
it can maybe move round maybe +//. 503485_504925
you know what I mean ? 504945_505545
like &~st but it's still in the genome . 505765_506785
it hasn't been expressed yet . 506985_507885
so after like maybe one cycle two cycles whenever the conditions are right for that &~cy virus to like replicate or like be activated those genes to be activated that cell would &~g go into here . 508385_519505
you mean this'll ⌈ lead ⌉ . 520585_521605
⌊ those will be lystar@n ⌋ .
⌈ these will lead into ⌉ here +... 521625_522805
but it could be like two or three like like stages after that . 524725_529605
like this can replicate again . 529765_530905
you know what I mean and form like two more cells that look just like that . 531545_535905
you know what I mean ? 536605_536985
and it you don't know when it's gonna do that that's ⌊ the ⌋ . 537045_539345
⌈ so ⌉ you don't know when it's ⌊ gonna come out <as a> plasmid ⌋ ? 539345_540205
⌈ you don't know when it's gonna go into ⌉ yeah you don't know when it's gonna come out and like attack the cell . 540205_544365
so why do they say it's like a defective virus ? 544745_547565
that it can't get into a particle without like a protein ? 548105_550085
it guess I don't understand that part of it then . 550365_551865

&-um I think those are just like more like if there's an insertion or deletion it's going to be shorter or longer . 1363145_1368425
you can detect it when when you do PCR . 1368645_1370085
you're gonna get like replications of &-uh the chromosomes so say you have like an insertion in yours that I don't have yours are going to be longer than mine . 1370925_1377585

or yours would be shorter if you had a deletion . 1380645_1382345
I think it just does like ⌊ the length ⌋ . 1382985_1384425

that's just a way to . 1398105_1398965
right but I'm saying that &~l you produce (th)em in there and it says detected by PCR that's what he said in class I think didn't he ? 1399145_1404325
or what what did you put down ⌊ xxx ⌋ . 1404425_1405345

so maybe what she's saying is that like yeah you have detected by PCR caused by insertions or deletions . 1419945_1424525
okay so pretty much what she's saying is that like you don't &~p okay you put your &-um DNA into PCR to get replicated &~se several times +/. 1424905_1432865
⌈ right ⌉ +/. 1433105_1433165

like you want several copies of your genome . 1436965_1438705
mm .
okay . 1439355_1439755
right . 1439755_1440535
does that help ? 1440635_1440995
yeah . 1441155_1441375
okay so you make several copies of the genome . 1441435_1443035
let's say that Diana has like insertion of like nine and +//. 1443615_1447335
nine like amino acids or something like that in hers . 1447815_1450695

do you know what I mean ? 1462835_1463155
+, right +/. 1463155_1463255
+, so there's no restriction enzymes that's actually going to be put into it . 1463255_1465995
so like the way they would detect it is that you put your &~d put both of your DNAs into PCR . 1466145_1470225
+, okay +/.
+, and then &-um you run (th)em along the gel . 1471165_1474025
+, okay +/. 1474145_1474705
+, okay like difference between here is that they would actually put in a restriction enzyme before you &~b run it on the gel to look at the length . 1474745_1479665
and so there was actually going to be two only one band . 1480185_1482445

when you run it . 1484685_1485165

⌈ so those are like really like colonies ⌉ . 1734165_1735285
⌊ right ⌋ .
⌈ those ⌉ are different . 1736255_1737155
see okay there's two different things right . 1737455_1739135
but there's plasmids . 1739555_1740435
you have a normal plasmid +/. 1740595_1741695
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ you ⌉ cut it with a restriction enzyme to add your fragment in there . 1741995_1744655
okay ? 1745235_1745275
+, mhm +/.
+, so your plasmid originally has &~ampicill ampicillin resistance . 1745615_1749335
+, ⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ ? 1750055_1750155

+, right ? 1756155_1756275
+, oh okay +/.
+, okay ? 1756635_1756855
so there's two checks . 1757135_1759295
one check is to make sure that you have a plasmid in there . 1759575_1761975
&~th so and that's &~ampicill ampicillin resistant . 1762655_1763715
that plasmid may or may not have that fragment inserted inside . 1765205_1768485
but it'll still be amp ⌊ resistant if it's just out ⌋ . 1769205_1770605
⌈ &~i but it'll still be amp &~re resistant ⌉ right ? 1770605_1772425

⌈ as long as the ⌉ plasmid got into the cell . 1773325_1775125
okay ? 1775745_1775845
so then you like do this to your sample and you get samples that are ampicillin resistant that grow on the on that petri dish . 1775885_1782445
⌊ uhuh ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ ?
okay so now you know that those cells have your &-um plasmid in it . 1783345_1786525
but you don't know if all those plasmids have that fragment in there . 1786885_1790025
+, right +/. 1790225_1790685
+, right ? 1790805_1795025
so then you put it on some other like gel and it gives a color or &~someth like I don't know ⌊ what exactly gives it ⌋ .
⌈ no you grow it on the ⌉ ampicillin on the ampicillin &~re ⌊ resistant ⌋ . 1796225_1799125

+, right +/.
+, right ? 1802205_1802345
and then you know that either either your blue colonies you want or &+s your white colonies you want right ? 1802605_1806865
+, right +/. 1806945_1807145
+, so like now now you know that your plasmid those colonies have both your plasmid in it and that fragment that you want . 1807165_1813485
okay . 1814005_1814265
okay . 1814505_1814705
⌊ <so there's> ⌋ .
⌈ so the ⌉ color has nothing to do with whether it's . 1814845_1817625

okay .
so next one ? 1849425_1852265
when you say plasmid like when you're looking at the &~plas does that mean that like those colonies that are colored whatever are they those cells ? 1853265_1861825
what are they ? 1862185_1862585
they're like colonies of plasmids ? 1862825_1864685

yeah . 1890105_1890425
okay . 1891185_1891545
(be)cause part of them like gets transcripted and translated or whatever to make the blue ? 1891945_1895405
okay . 1895605_1895945
yeah . 1896265_1896505
like what she was saying was okay . 1896955_1899155
well let's use this example again . 1900035_1901195
(be)cause plasmids are just circular DNA . 1901935_1903655
yeah +/. 1904215_1904475
+, only in bacteria right ? 1905035_1906375
yeah . 1906715_1907415
I think so . 1908095_1909055
I think so .
xxx I don't know whatever . 1909435_1911475
okay so you have this thing right ? 1911775_1913175
you have this plasmid okay ? 1913455_1915655
okay . 1916335_1917435
and then you have this plasmid . 1917595_1918715
right ? 1919015_1919915
so like step one was to get this this recombinant plasmid . 1920335_1924915
right ? 1925095_1925575
and this recombinant plasmid inserts into the &~lac &~whate +/. 1925655_1928715

once MRNA is made it doesn't +//. 2053225_2054965
it like the introns are already spliced out . 2055185_2057285

you can put +//. 2075785_2076265
now you can insert that into bacteria and have &~pr bacteria produce that insulin that you need . 2076485_2080665
okay +/. 2081125_2081405
+, okay ? 2081565_2081865
problem is like like we can't find insulin for diabetic people we need to mass produce insulin . 2082155_2088055
okay ? 2088735_2088775
so what they did was and you can't just take that you can't just can't take the DNA from a human being . 2088955_2095155
right ?
the part of the human genome that's that &-um these these diabetic people are missing and like just like put that in some &~p just type of bacteria make it produce insulin . 2096075_2104875
because it has introns and extrons . 2105235_2106495
+, okay +/. 2107655_2107675
+, right ? 2107915_2108175
does that make sense ? 2109175_2109895
yeah I think so . 2110595_2111415
but why are you putting into bacteria to begin with ? 2111935_2113975
just to replicate it ? 2114095_2115015
to well okay &-um like number one like when you like +//. 2115255_2120735
gene therapy . 2121195_2121675
reason why gene therapy doesn't work . 2122055_2123275
right ? 2123775_2123795
you like insert some DNA into your cells you don't even know like just like this case right here you don't know if your cell's gonna <take up> &~w take up like the DNA +/. 2123895_2131515

right ? 2138135_2138395
and it it'll work for like a couple replications but after that like it's gonna attack it and like it's gonna attack that DNA and it's gonna like send it right out . 2138505_2145665
you know what I mean like it's +/. 2146065_2146705
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ not ⌋ gonna be +//. 2146885_2147205
it's not a &~pro it's not like a a prolonged like &-um prevention of like diabetes or like treatment you know what I mean it can't be the treatment . 2147405_2155045
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ ? 2155485_2155585
so what they're saying is that like why don't we just inject insulin into these people for diabetic people right ? 2155705_2161365
like insulin that they don't produce by themselves that we produce elsewhere you know what I mean so that we can like cure their like you know like sugar lows and highs and things like that . 2161595_2171075
okay ? 2171495_2171575
so like one way of doing this is that like I remember one way is like you can get insulin from pigs . 2172335_2178995
&=laughs you know what I mean like purify the insulin that's in pig's blood and give it to people . 2179475_2182775
and that works sometimes . 2183175_2184055
but another way +//. 2184575_2185235
but like okay like you're killing all these pigs just for insulin right ? 2185375_2188795
but they +//. 2189465_2190125
another way that they can do it is through this process of like making these bacteria produce like insulin or make rats produce insulin like extra amounts of insulin . 2190365_2200305
+, oh ⌈ so you ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ do you ⌋ see what I'm saying like . 2201125_2202125

⌊ exactly like the &~bac ⌋ just in this case right ? 2203865_2205905

okay +/. 2211605_2212185

okay .
does that make sense ? 2235075_2235795
yeah .
⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ yeah so ⌉ then when you (be)cause like I know it was one of the questions says like why do you use retroviruses in ⌊ humans ⌋ ? 2236335_2243575
⌈ oh yeah ⌉ the human gene therapy using defective retroviruses is that what you're talking about ? 2243705_2247985
in the question ? 2248265_2248765
right because in order you wanted to use retroviruses because okay remember you have different types of &-um infection of of viruses like DNA virus RNA virus like things like that . 2249085_2259865
right +/. 2260105_2260125
+, right ? 2260385_2260525
okay &-um DNA virus . 2260825_2262765
why can't we use just the DNA of insulin that's encoded in your body right now and put it into a cell and make it produce ⌊ insulin ⌋ ? 2263045_2269725
⌈ yeah ⌉ see that's what +//.
(be)cause &~i the our cells have stuff to like +//. 2270005_2272485
why do you need to use a retrovirus to do that ? 2272665_2274405
(be)cause ⌊ our cells can ⌋ . 2274625_2275365

okay .
I think that like &-um pretty much the thing is that there there are regulations everywhere in eukaryotic cells and in some cases like some &-um regulation will occur at this level and some will occur at this level and some will occur at that level and all of it is a sort_of a regulation . 3813955_3830035

on that note I have a question about one of the regulations he talked about . 3849945_3853545
okay . 3853805_3853865
&-um at the transcriptional level he talked about &-um this and I kinda &~un I &~un I think I understand that but then he said that the +//. 3854465_3861805
because there are no operons and the genes are spread around pathways need to be on at the same time so the same segment in front of all those pathways needs to be on or something it's like the last thing he said on the transcriptional level . 3861755_3873775
⌊ I didn't understand that ⌋ .

like it's the same promoter but it's just in front of that gene &~i where that gene is in different places ? 3889505_3895205

this is the way I I I kinda think over that is that in like eukaryotic cells like there's a_lot_o(f) things that can affect just a production of protein or like things like that like you &~m several genes may code for like your hair color +/. 3911225_3923725
