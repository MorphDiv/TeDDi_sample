+, &+st can you see it in the table ? 0_1464
or maybe in the t@l table can you not see it at all ? 1464_3990
+< it's invisible . 2712_3990
<is it> &+invisi is it just implicit in it or can you see it ? 3990_6628
it's implicit . 6628_8724
Firstname ? 8724_9518
I think the only like significant xxx detail is +/. 9518_12845
(be)cause like if you do the function of n@l times one +... 12845_18325
but if you do this one . 18325_19357
+< what ? 18725_19357
never_mind it doesn't xxx . 19357_20702
it doesn't show up . 20702_21511
you don't think it shows up ? 21511_22896
yeah . 22896_23529
xxx . 23529_24502
yeah ‡ Firstname ? 24502_25447
for the first step it just starts on one . 25447_29518
the first step what +//? 29518_30471
+< so ‡ the zero step . 30171_31613
the zero step ? 31613_32804
the first xxx . 32804_34421
it starts on one ? 34421_35428
what do you guys think that that's it ? 35928_37485
xxx . 37485_39545
is this it ? 39545_40365
yeah . 40365_40891
+< it's zero one ? 40365_41665
+< yes . 40765_41665
yeah . 41665_42478
why ? 42478_42844
+< just just write xxx . 42478_43795
write . 43795_44155
+< is that just it by chance „ though ? 43795_45262
like why +/? 45262_47036
+< oh oh . 45936_48162
+< we have_to have a reason . 46636_47550
if it is gonna show up here we have_to have a reason why . 47550_49893
is this just by chance ? 49893_51006
or does it really show up on the zer(o) . 51006_52331
will it always show up on the zero step ? 52331_54532
always . 54532_55244
why would it &+al +/? 55244_56357
so ‡ Firstname says it's always gonna show up . 56357_58575
can you xxx ? 58575_60199
why would it always show up on the zero step ? 60199_62368
xxx a theory ? 62368_63670
well ‡ I think it's only gonna show up on the zero step because you
and since it's zero then you're always gonna get zero . 68074_70737
and then when you have_to add that one there's gonna be one . 70737_73669
whereas the other numbers you can't see it because you've added on .
like you've multiplied and stuff . 76839_78398
you've added it on . 78398_79565
so ‡ it's just like in the final answer . 79565_81899
so ‡ you're not gonna like point out in the answer where it is . 81899_84937
you can only see it in the zero . 84937_87795
okay ‡ Firstname . 87795_89531
okay ‡ like you said like with these equations we've been doing it's
and then like all xxx zero if you like multiply zero by anything
so ‡ whatever you add on is gonna be the extra to zero . 101285_106572
does that make sense to you ? 106572_107957
+< xxx or whatever . 106572_107957
so ‡ you guys all seem to think this is alwa(ys) +/. 107957_109761
so ‡ that's something that I want you to look at tonight in your
is think about that some more . 112197_113322
is it always gonna show up in your zero step ? 113322_115619
I wanna make sure that you're including that in your graph . 115619_117901
so ‡ if you're gonna graph this +... 117901_121060
I'm gonna go ahead and graph it myself . 121060_122455
and I wanna ask you some questions about it . 122455_124139
so ‡ &-um zero y@l . 124139_128372
so ‡ you should always label this „ right ? 128372_130604
yeah . 130604_131112
so ‡ the x@l axis xxx . 131112_135269
&=writes . 135269_139883
so on and so forth . 139883_140908
I'm not gonna spend the time right now xxx . 140908_142772
+< it's zero . 141908_142772
so +... 142772_149074
can we get to label xxx ? 149074_150609
+< &=hums . 149509_153493
you forgot something . 153493_154661
0 . 154661_157548
what did I forget ? 157548_158815
zero . 158815_160599
right here . 160599_161236
+< and you can go up to like n@l and xxx . 160734_163269
but I have the n@l and the f@l of n@l there for . 163269_165738
oh ‡ okay . 165738_166573
why is that xxx ? 166573_168390
+< okay ‡ so ‡ (..) I'll write it . 167890_172168
felt like f@l should be up . 172168_175278
so ‡ we didn't end up getting to bring up Firstname's what
like with &-uh looking at the four quadrants xxx again . 179020_182688
but we're not gonna have time today since it's very very short
&-uh &-um so ‡ we'll have_to talk about some more about the
oh_no I did it . 188257_190508
oh_no . 190508_191673
+< bad bad bad bad bad . 191041_192412
okay ‡ so ‡ this &-um this graph is this all that there is ? 192412_199081
this graph . 199081_201468
&-um is this all that there is to the graph ? 201468_203152
<is this> does it end here ? 203152_204306
does that pattern end ? 204306_205338
(be)cause if I just stop it like this &=bell_rings . 205338_209289
oh_well . 209289_209816
we'll have_to talk about this tomorrow . 209816_210928
oh_man dang_it we have_to leave math . 210928_214027
0 . 214027_217751
Firstname . 217751_218610
yes ? 218610_220082
