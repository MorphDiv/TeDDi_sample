to introduce your debate and share your evidence to support your claims . 2335_7315
at the end of your debate, you're going to allow the other team to ask questions . 7975_13075
this side is going to go first with their debate and presenting their argument . 13455_16815
and when they're finished, you are going to ask some questions that will challenge them . 17575_21315
when we are finished taking questions, we will swap . 21635_24495
we're going to do two minutes for questions as well, so timekeepers make sure that you are on your job . 24805_29185
okay ?
all right . 30545_30945
so we are going to start with Char's side . 31205_33005
let's go . 33185_34045
xxx, do me a favor . 34045_38045
have a seat over there . 38745_39705
our team believe that Char is powerful . 39705_41425
she is powerful because she forced Malika to do things she didn't want to do . 41685_44965
the first reason we believe that Char is more powerful, because on page one-forty-one, it says, Char grabs my hand and says, do it, or I ain't never going to bring you no more clothes . 46295_55195
this example shows that Char is more powerful because she forced Malika into doing something she didn't want to do . 55735_63155
in addition, Char is more powerful because on page one-forty-two, it says, Char squeezes my shoulder so hard I hear my bones crack . 63595_71835
I grabbed the lighter with my other hand and set the money on fire . 72235_75695
this shows that Char is more powerful because Char forces Malika to set the money on fire and she didn't want to . 76055_82815
and in closing our team believes that Char has more power because in the whole end of the story Char was forcing Malika to do things she didn't want to do . 83655_92855
also, she was controlling Malika whole mindset . 93495_95815
so they've presented their argument . 99895_101435
I'm hoping that you guys were listening and what I'm going to need you to do now, do you have any questions for this side ? 101695_107695
you have absolutely no questions ? 108315_111475
I do . 111635_111875
you do ? 112155_112395
yeah .
okay . 112635_113335
so direct your questions to them . 113655_114835
what if Malika didn't listen ? 115195_116295
what do you mean, what if Malika didn't listen ? 117555_121695
what if she didn't listen and still ended up xxx ? 121855_123615
well, we know what happened in the books so we're not going to go with what is, when you ask questions I want you to direct them . 125105_130065
you're making them prove something . 130185_131585
so you're saying that their argument was clear and you don't need them to +... 131825_134285
can I answer that question ? 134405_134865
no . 135885_137305
S_six, go ahead . 137825_138885
when Char didn't pick on Malika, who had the power now ? 139145_141305
you said what ? 141785_142185
when Char didn't pick on Malika, who had the power then ? 142525_144985
when did Char never pick on Malika ? 145225_146465
so clarify, he wants you to clarify when, give him an example of when Char did not pick on Malika . 147305_152845
or some evidence . 154035_154315
when she, she told Malika that she shouldn't listened to him . 155015_159555
still, I would like some evidence to be said from the story . 161855_164655
that is evidence, so answer the question . 164675_166335
so question +... 167215_167795
tell me your example again . 169475_171015
when Char was talking to Malika and Char was like, she should have listened to Malika . 171855_178935
so in the end, when Char was reflecting on Malika and she said she should have listened to her, S_six is asking, how was it that Char has the power when she was reflecting on it ? 179865_190345
she said that she should have listened to Malika . 190785_192365
xxx look this up, Mr .
S_four .
it's page one-fifty .
have you set your timers ? 194405_196085
should be already set . 196925_198625
okay, thank you . 199325_201765
what paragraph is this ? 202845_204145
so is there a rebuttal, do you have an answer for that ? 206145_208945
I would like to see this in the text . 209325_212005
why would you think that Char felt like she should have listened to Malika ? 212345_215405
anybody on this side want to answer that ? 215665_217605
yes . 217905_218265
okay . 218525_219305
the reason Char wanted Malika to listen to her, is because Char didn't want to get in trouble . 220105_226165
she didn't want to repeat the grade once again . 226765_228305
but she already is . 228765_229825
okay . 230865_231025
are there any other questions ? 231245_232225
no other questions ? 233705_234465
okay .
xxx .
how much time do we have on the clock ? 234745_238505
we're only seconds in .
so the first one you had was seven seconds . 241005_243865
okay . 244425_244585
all right . 245425_245545
so there are no more questions . 245705_246525
what we're going to do is move to this argument, make sure that you all are jotting down your questions so that you can ask them . 246685_252365
yes ? 252665_257445
xxx and that's where you were talking, the question .
okay . 266475_266875
well, it's your turn to present your arguments . 266915_269115
put two minutes on the clock . 269695_270755
xxx, is that in your shot ? 271255_272195
okay . 272775_273195
so who's going to start the argument over here ? 273595_275275
you can begin . 275395_276355
okay, our team believes that Malika is more powerful . 276835_279615
she is more powerful because she stood up to Char for everything she had done . 279855_283775
the first reason we believe that Malika is more powerful is because she stood up for herself by saying Char was too old for seventh grade . 288745_295805
this example, shows that Malika is more powerful because she stood up for herself when Char was being mean to her . 296725_303705
in addition Malika is more powerful because Malika told on Char told her not to . 304945_309265
this shows that Malika is more powerful because Malika didn't listen to Char when she told her what to do, she did it anyway . 309665_314425
in conclusion, our team believes that Malika has more power because when Char would tell her what to do and be mean, she would stand up for her herself . 315335_322175
okay .
all right, so can we restart our times to two minutes now that the argument has been presented ? 324995_331035
does this team have any questions ? 331935_334435
by show of hands . 335015_335755
we'll start with S_two's question . 336355_337555
question, if she had power, why does she burn the money when Char forced her to ? 337925_343645
because she, I remember in the text when it said she grabbed her to hand and she basically made her do it . 343725_350305
because she wasn't going to do it if she didn't grab her hand . 350465_352245
exactly, and who has the power there ? 352765_353625
xxx forced her to .
or, when she squeezed her shoulder because it hurt . 354405_359705
did you hear what she said ? 359965_360625
she made her do it . 360705_362505
so that means Char has the power . 362565_363825
because she grabbed her hand . 363945_365185
she couldn't do anything . 365185_366205
she forced her +... 367005_367225
and she was weak . 367285_368005
exactly !
remember one person is talking at a time . 368365_370945
Char has the power . 371825_372465
excuse me, but you asked her a question and it was her time speaking, you speak over her . 372525_376645
may you please let her talk, please ? 376745_377805
thank you . 378025_378205
thank you, S_five . 378325_379205
I respect that . 379625_380385
yes .
when she was grabbing her shoulder, she got weak . 380765_384285
and she said she had a little bone in her knee or something, something happened to her knee and then she grabbed her hand and she basically made her do it . 385325_392465
she wouldn't have did it if she didn't grab her shoulder . 392825_394945
she couldn't defend herself . 394985_395685
so it wasn't really fair . 395785_396785
okay . 397445_397665
is there another question ? 398105_399905
no, but I do have a rebuttal . 400405_402285
and so when S_two was saying, yes, Malika does have the power in that situation, well no, I mean Char has the power and this situation, what am I talking about . 403545_409325
you want to know why ? 410605_411265
because Char forced her to do it, which means Char has the power because Malika didn't stand up for herself . 411425_415705
what she did, she went in a corner and cried . 415885_418145
one person's talking . 418425_419225
one more comment on this side . 419665_424705
well, I wrote before she burned the money, Char just asked her to do stuff and she said no . 425445_433865
and then she asked her again and she said, no . 434925_436785
okay .
does anyone have another question that's separate from the money ? 437825_440965
me . 441325_441525
no, only this side is asking questions . 442945_445025
does anyone else on this team have questions for this scene ? 445085_448025
no .
no, sir .
that's the only question ? 449865_450465
xxx .
okay . 450645_453825
S_six has one more thing she has to say . 455805_456985
y'all keep saying that Char made her do it . 457105_461005
she didn't make her do it . 461205_462525
she basically did it herself because +... 462625_464925
it's okay .
go on talking . 465605_467485
I can keep going ? 467605_469345
mm-hmm .
okay . 469745_469965
she basically did it herself . 470105_471825
okay . 473235_473515
really fast, I have a question coming from upfront . 473595_475475
one second xxx, go ahead . 475955_476855
okay . 477375_477595
so my question for this group, if Char has more power than Malika, why doesn't she stand up to her own sister ? 478235_485935
that's her sister . 487035_488915
okay . 489095_489315
really fast, that's a great question . 489415_490675
yes, S_four ? 491055_491595
okay . 491835_492295
so this situation is not Char versus Juju . 492695_495135
it's not Char versus Juju, it's Char versus Malika so we probably not going to answer that question . 495415_500675
Juju has nothing to do with that .
okay . 503355_503675
really fast, are there any other questions from team to team that you want to challenge the other team on ? 504115_508775
all right, we're going to take two more questions . 509135_510755
so I'll take one from S_five . 511315_512395
I just need to know, if we was only working on certain pages, why y'all go back into the text and use other stuff ? 512495_518435
we was only working on pages and y'all went to go to other stuff . 518575_523675
yes, y'all went back . 524115_525035
because y'all like +... 525215_526335
we didn't go back . 526535_527155
y'all didn't go back, but we needed to +... 527195_529495
she's talking .
see what y'all was talking about because y'all could be making it up . 529585_531825
all right .
so with us focusing on the facts +... 532585_534545
she didn't have the power because xxx so they go back in the text and they found it . 535285_539505
okay . 539985_540245
really fast +... 540385_540745
but y'all xxx .
bring it back . 540965_543225
all eyes on me . 543345_544045
are there any more questions regarding the debate for chapters twenty five to thirty two ? 544685_549365
no .
no . 549745_549965
all right . 550925_551305
so we're going to keep +... 551385_551845
yes ?
why, why did Malika start being herself after Char went to Alabama ? 554345_559645
why was this ? 560005_560545
because she was getting bullied . 560985_562585
so really fast, so the question is, why did Malika go back to, or why did she start being herself once Char was out of the picture ? 563065_572345
so he wants to know, before Char was sent to Alabama, why was Malika acting a certain type of way ? 572585_578345
yes, S_ten ? 579065_580085
I believe that she wanted to be like Malika because, I forgot what chapter it was, she went to the party with Malika then she realized that it wasn't really her . 581085_589385
so that's when she started acting different, started changing . 589585_591985
and she you saw that how Char's sister was bullying her . 592465_595025
so that's what I think, yeah . 595605_597005
okay . 597885_598265
so you're saying you felt like Malika wanted to be like Char up until she got to really know Char and then she realized it wasn't . 598465_604925
okay, it's a good response . 605385_606745
last question that we're going to take . 607085_608305
yes, S_six ? 610905_611065
oh, it's not a question .
not a question, answer to what he said ?
yes .
okay . 612345_612385
last one . 612785_612945
go ahead . 613085_613225
okay, so your question was, why did Malika start acting like herself when Char moved to Alabama ? 613525_621245
mm-hmm . 621825_622505
okay . 623085_623305
if Char was still there, I feel as though she would have still act like herself because they had that whole when she stood up for herself . 623605_630505
but why ?
because she stood up for herself, when she tired . 631285_634765
you said she was tired ? 635665_637405
tired . 637965_638285
okay . 638565_638945
all right, so her response is that she was tired and so similar to what S_ten said . 639385_643105
you guys did a great job +... 643605_644605
