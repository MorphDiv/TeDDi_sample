okay (0.2) em thank you we'll now move to 1392_3899
the next section of the tests 3920_5339
task three↘ (0.3) 5329_6412
task three is a role play in which 6406_8140
you are the teacher and we are your students (0.3) 8181_10757
your task is to teach us a common term↗ 10769_12939
or a concept from your field of study↘ (0.3) 12942_15150
if you cannot think of a term↘ 15161_16755
we'll provide you with a list of terms→ 16739_19043
from which you can choose (0.3) 19038_20638
∙hhh you have- you'll have seven minutes to→ 20486_22486
teach us your term or concept↘ (0.3) 22491_24352
as you explain this term or concept↘ 24340_26153
we may interrupt you to ask questions↗ 26142_28323
and we may also ask questions→ 28318_30104
after you have finished↘ (0.4) 30083_31614
here are four issues consider as you prepare↘ (0.3) 31644_34332
can you give a formal definition of this term↘ (0.2) 34418_36759
can you explain why this term is important↘ 36818_39154
in your field of study↘ (0.4) 39148_40674
how will you begin your explanation↗ 40708_42564
and can you be sure that your audience↗ 42585_44772
understands what the term is↘ (0.3) 44863_46975
can you make the definition clearer or simpler↘ 47087_49865
by using examples analogies or the blackborad↘ 49860_53065
you will have one minute to prepare→ 54129_55857
what you want to say↘ (0.3) 55846_57078
during this time→ 57089_57985
you may use xxx ⁇peice of⁇ paper or→ 57980_60028
blackbroad to prepare↘ (0.3) 60022_61484
do you have a term or concept in mind↗ (0.2) 61532_63590
yes I have→ 63612_64220
+≈ okay→ (0.2) 64305_65052
you now have one minute to prepare↘ 65052_66934
°okay°→ 66836_67780
all right↗ are you ready↗ 126489_127886
emhm↗ 127939_128382
em:::: (0.3) I would like to introduce→ 129093_131349
the concept of the→ 131344_132752
xxx xxx of xxx dynamics (0.4) 132746_135264
⁇now⁇ first or second the xxx (0.5) 135359_138501
eh this concept is very important↘ (0.2) 138580_141306
because (0.2) eh::: it can- we can determine→ (0.2) 141292_145489
the concept of temprature by using this concept↘ (0.4) 145590_149056
eh:::: (0.3) and you may think the tempreture 149150_152361
is very basic easy and common concept↘ (0.3) 152333_155960
but if you don't completely understand the 155958_158566
concept of the xxx xxx→ (0.2) 158551_161026
you wouldn't be able to get it↘ (0.5) 161114_163135
ehm:::::: (1.5) 163228_165425
and again and I will give you a- the definition→ 165532_168924
of the xxx xxx→ (0.2) 168913_170375
the definition is→ (0.3) 170454_172016

ehm::: (0.7) let me give you an example↗ 181594_184431
em let me give a drawing→ 184426_186159
to make the concept clearer↘ (0.3) 186149_188192
eh::: can I use ⌈this↘ 188240_189547
⌈°yeah° 189262_189598
of course 189550_190505
eh we have three object→ (0.3) 193890_195618
A (1.5) and B (1.3) and C (0.8) 195694_202659

they can have different temperature↘ (0.3) 283334_286401
so here uh:::→ (0.3) 286484_288650
the more important concept ⁇come⁇ xxx here↘ 288669_291256

so::: (0.8) oh when we (0.2) understand the→ 307542_311382
xxx xxx of xxx dynamics↗ 311364_313828
we can get the concept of temperature↘ (0.3) 313869_316946

that's it (0.3) ⁇and⁇ ⁇have⁇ question↗ 321657_323892
