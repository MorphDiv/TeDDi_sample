right this little boy had a pet frog and a pet dog .
and he he was asleep when the frog escaped .
and when he woke up he was really worried (be)cause it wasn't there
and him and his dog were looking everywhere for it &-um in his room
and then they started to look outside .
and the dog jumped out_of the window .
and then he got angry with and started hugging the dog
and then they were calling it .
and they kept looking outside &-um like in holes and up trees and
and &-um &-um .
it's alright you are doing well .
&-um .
it's alright flip to the next one and see how you do .
and the dog was licking the beehive .
and the bees started to chase him .
and an owl started to come out_of the tree that the little boy was
and so they ran away from that place .
okay .
and &-um then they carried on calling him .
but then they got attacked by a deer .
<the deer> and the deer took them away .
and like threw them down a cliff thing .
