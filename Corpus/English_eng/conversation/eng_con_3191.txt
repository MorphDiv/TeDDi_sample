eight year yeah . 165342_166016
m . 166329_166619
ah okay . 183720_184393
it'll do . 184382_184869
right . 185705_185949
so <the> the thing i was talking about making things is down at
this one . 189026_189397
<uh no> . 189822_192086
<or> . 189911_190411
the bind_change@g <buttons> .
<right> . 191885_192292
so you've gotta . 192617_193615
see you've got one <co(rner)> one road there you have to fill
and the <production> +/. 197183_198227
<this one> ? 197670_198053
then that goes through every turn . 199017_200549
and every turn you create <two> two shields . 200573_202837
that's the two shields in your production . 203316_204698
so do you have to buy these things ? 204721_206149
no they are made over time . 206474_207797
you can speed off <the> the buying of them . 207774_209492
<by> (...) using the produc(tion) +//. 210111_213304
<by> by using your money in the treasury . 213342_215177
oh so i can make their production increase by buying more instead
yeah . 220203_220737
okay . 220912_221260
so . 221941_222208
<by default> there you're gonna get two (..) uhm (...) two
<uh> . 222393_222556
excuse me . 228232_229208
and then you have like food at the top . 229881_231530
uh here you've got two extras bits of food being generated . 232412_235349
<<this> this> +//. 235837_236406
<the extra food> . 235860_236406
this here ? 236464_236951
yeah . 237009_237346
okay . 237860_238255
that goes into the food storage . 238499_239857
and when that fills up you get an extra +//. 239869_241773
the population now goes up to a certain level and you get an extra
right . 246366_246616
<so where> do i begin here ? 246616_247564
<this guy> . 247852_248135
<or do i> ?
<you can't> do anything at the moment . 248135_249793
so . 249793_250164
<how do i> what do i do to get rid <of it> ? 250290_251799
<well> you have one decision to make . 251695_252867
if you click on change@g . 252844_253842
you can either build a warrior , a settler , or a barracks next
<okay> . 259000_259859
<so whichever you> think you want to make . 259360_260962
let's build <a settler> . 261740_262947
<settler> settlers are people that can build new cities . 262251_264886
so which do sh(ould) which should i g(o) ?
<should i> go for the warriors or <the b(arracks)> the
<a ha> . 267169_267506
i tend to go for the settlers first <because you can> make more
<yeah> . 271445_271770
<yeah> . 273482_273726
<and> then you can grow the cities up . 273593_274696
and then you got much more power . 274754_275903
so <what> what does this change for me here ? 276649_278635
<just> . 276731_276951
now he's just changed the person that's been made . 279157_281305
<okay> . 281630_282118
<and you see now> you've got four rows instead of one row . 281634_283352
<cause a settler> takes a lot more production . 284200_286626
<yeah> . 284292_284560
so . 287102_287496
okay . 287682_288146
he is an expensive resource . 288170_289470
yeah . 289424_289841
more expensive . 289853_290503
they get much more expensive than that later on . 290538_292175
okay so . 292407_292941
what do i do <now> ? 293092_293626
<hit> <the exit@g button> . 293662_294311
<click exit@g> ?
so now you just hit the end of turn . 295298_296400
which is <receive> +/. 296888_297701
<where's> <that> ? 297503_298084
<the end of turn> is flashing in the bottom corner . 297712_299291
press enter . 299431_299883
yeah . 300235_300549
so's . 300676_300967
now . 301907_302186
so . 303222_303524
this is basically a throne room . 303733_305080
now you can build up yourself . 305242_306287
<every t(urn)> every so often after you get a certain level
<uh huh> . 311229_311589
<and uh> . 311230_311670
people are <sufficiently happy in you> . 312212_313558
<they give you a bigger crown> ? 312479_313570
they give you a bigger crown yeah . 314000_314870
they'll either build a bit . 314870_315718
so you select one of the bits there and it'll add it into the
basically now you've got a chair to sit on . 320841_322362
<and the chair can go up> as you continue . 323622_325875
<click on the isle to continue> . 323623_324551
