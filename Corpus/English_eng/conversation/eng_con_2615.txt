okay everybody have a copy of this handout ?
okay &-um excuse_me .
I was going to &-um once again make an attempt to &-um &-uh place names to faces but &-uh seeing that we're a couple minutes behind I may have to wait and do that on Thursday .
so again to xxx assist me what I would like you to do is &-uh &-uh keep more or less the same seats you had &-uh a_couple_of weeks ago or a week and a half ago last time we met &-uh to assist me to &-uh make a correlation with what I wrote down .
okay what I would like to do today &-uh is continue the discussion about time and in doing so what I'd like to do is to make sure that you have &-uh a good understanding of the difference between absolute time and relative time a topic that I think you discussed with &-uh &-uh Professor Lohman last week .
&-uh so to lead off today's lecture we're going to be I'm going to be asking you questions about these terms and what they mean to you and then very quickly review &-uh the Geologic Time Scale .
&-uh the handout I just gave you has a summary of the Geologic Time Scale .
it looks like it's a very involved &-uh list of names and so on but there are a few basic concepts I'm going to point out that you should remember in_order_to facilitate future discussions .
you're not going to hafta memorize all the names you see on there .
I'm just going to point out the important &-uh items in a minute .
&-uh after we've done that I am going to again ask you some questions about &-uh &-uh sedimentary units how they become so extensive as to cover an entire state or perhaps even &-uh a large section of a continent and partly to answer the questions we're going to ask about stratigraphic correlations we will go into what are known as transgressions and regressions .
so number four is really the answer to number three .
and then if time allows at the very end I will introduce &-uh radioactivity .
okay ?
so let's begin by revisiting &-uh this issue of relative time versus absolute time .
anybody else need a handout ?
you need one as well ?
okay (0.7) okay &-uh Professor Lohman told me this morning that he talked about relative dating &-uh versus absolute dating &-uh and &=writes:board very quickly I would like somebody to remind us of what relative dating is and actually what it is that it accomplishes .
what is relative dating ?
this is a course about the evolution of the earth right so that means that we're gonna hafta put things or events in their proper sequence and you can do this either by actually putting a number on the event that this happened five hundred million years ago .
or we can do it by using relative dating techniques .
so what is relative dating ?
saying something is older or younger than something ⌈ <else of the same> ⌉ .
⌊ okay so this ⌋ is simply to place events in their proper sequence .
&=writes:board okay all we are doing is putting events in their proper sequence without necessarily saying exactly when those events took place .
and one example we could use here &-uh is a cross sectional view &-uh of let's say a road cut .
&-uh and you may identify in this road cut that there is some sort of an undulating line that we call an unconformity .
(0.4) okay this is a line along which there's been some erosion &-uh take place .
&-uh you may find that &-uh immediately below an unconformity like so &-uh there are series of intrusions we call dikes .
and let's have them represent several different &-uh &-uh generations okay so let's call this one dike A and this one is going to be dike B &-uh and to make it interesting let's put in a third one .
okay so this is cross sectional view &-uh we're looking at a road cut and we see sedimentary layers that are horizontal like so (0.4) okay and these sedimentary units have been cut &-uh by these intrusions that I'm calling &-uh dikes .
okay so sedimentary layers would look like this .
this would be say unit one two three and four .
and in fact you may find that on top of that there are other sediments deposited .
let's call this unit six seven and eight .
okay so relative dating is the exercise of placing geologic events in their proper sequence .
and if you came across a cross section like this in a road cut as you traveled to Arizona or New Mexico or a place like that would you be able to tell me what happened first and what happened second and third and so on ?
this is a cross section that has sedimentary units one through eight &-uh those sediments have been cut by these features we call dikes .
they are basically igneous material that came up and solidified in features that we call dike and it happens to be in this case that we have three of them A B and C we have an unconformity and we have sedimentary layers on top of that .
what we would like to do therefore is put a history together and in doing so we are going to be carrying out the exercise of relative dating placing geologic events in their proper sequence ⌈ yes ⌉ ?
⌊ what happened ⌋ to five or is the unconformity ⌈ considered five ⌉ ?
⌊ well that's ⌋ part of the story .
⌈ oh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I ⌋ purposely omitted number five &-uh because as we put the history the geologic history of this cross section together you'll have to tell me what happened to number five +/.
+, alright +/.
+, okay ?
so what do you think happened first in yes Cliff ?
&-uh I think like that layer one sediment was deposited +/.
⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ one one ⌋ through four was deposited .
okay so the first thing that happened .
one through five was deposited ⌈ one ⌉ .
⌊ first ⌋ thing that happened was the deposition &=writing:board of sedimentary layers one through four .
now we can't be absolutely sure that unit five was deposited .
and that is an issue I'm going to come back to after we've discussed what this unconformity is .
so unit five may have been deposited &-uh more or less around the same time that one through four were deposited .
&-uh but there are some other possibilities that we should consider .
but before we do that what would you say happened next &-uh yes .
&-um the dikes C B then ⌈ A ⌉ .
⌊ are ⌋ you Jerry ?
Drew .
Drew excuse_me Drew dikes .
C B then A .
okay dikes were then emplaced in that order C B and then A .
&=writes:board okay so we can say that it was the placement +...
&~ha how do you know they're in that order ?
+, of dikes +//.
maybe Drew can tell us how he knows it's that order C B and then A in that order .
okay how do you know they were emplaced in that order Drew ?
because B overlaps C and then A overlaps B .
okay it is because of the concept known as crosscutting relations okay so this is cross cutting &=writing:board relations you can see that &-uh dike C must have been in place already before dike B was emplaced after all it's truncated by it or it's cut by it and you can also see that dike B is cut by dike A .
so of the three of them C hasta be the oldest one it was here when this one came in to cut it and likewise B must have been in place before A was emplaced because it's cut by A .
so A hasta be the youngest one .
okay ?
alright then what happens +...
after these dikes have been emplaced in this sedimentary sequence something very dramatic happens .
what do you think it is from the evidence you can see ?
Emmanuel .
sedimentary rock &-um layer C &-um &-uh is placed on top of the .
you mean most sediments were were deposited ?
the sediment after one two four ⌈ six ⌉ +/.
⌊ yes ⌋ +/.
+, was placed ⌈ so ⌉ .
⌊ okay you're ⌋ saying that number six is then placed on top of this ?
yeah .
well that will happen at some stage but before we worry about the deposition of unit six what I would like us to worry about is what happened along this unconformity .
an unconformity being really a surface of discontinuity in other words it's a surface along which there has been erosion .
but before erosion can take place okay let's revisit the issue of deposition .
units one through four were deposited let's say in the ocean this is a marine sequence if I didn't mention it already .
&-uh can we erode units that are still underwater ?
can sediments that happen to be underwater be eroded ?
yes .
they can ?
<a hurricane> .
there's a movement of water +/.
okay +/.
+, yeah they can be eroded .
okay now if we have significant currents in the oceans yes sediment can be moved around .
but when it is moved around it goes from one place to the other .
alright and we still have deposition taking place .
so in other words if my ocean basin is like so &=writes:board and you and I are looking at a cross section that developed &-uh for sediments that sit right here &-uh if we have strong currents there is sea level &-uh the currents could indeed move some of this sediment from right there and deposit it someplace else where &-uh currents are not as &-uh strong .
but to have a very profound erosion or surface develop is our mountain or our pile of sediments going to be underwater or exposed to the elements ?
exposed .
it hasta be exposed right ?
in_order_to develop a significant erosion or surface our sediments hafta be exposed to the elements .
in other words we need rain we need rivers we need &-uh wind all of those &-uh factors that are going to &-uh help weather down or erode the surface &-uh so that &-uh we develop what is known as an unconformity .
so that brings us to the point of what happened to number five .
it could very well be that unit five had been deposited along the surface right on top of number four .
but because of the erosion that occurred unit five was removed .
but it is also possible that unit five was never deposited in the first place .
how would we know then that unit five ever existed if it wasn't deposited right here +..?
yes .
it wouldn't be if if it was ever deposited it wouldn't completely erode it away right ?
okay &~w &~w what we're saying here really is that &-uh we would be comparing the cross section we are looking at right here to a cross section we might be able to see in another cliff let's say a hundred kilometers away .
so a hundred kilometers away and by the way that's where we're going to start talking about stratigraphic correlations we may be able to observe a hundred kilometers away units one two three four five and then six .
that's how we infer that a unit five ever existed .
(be)cause we see it some other place where it was not eroded away .
okay ?
that's how we know that unit five existed but in this particular location &-uh it has been eroded away .
okay so having said that &-uh you know profound amounts of erosion will take place only if these rocks are exposed to the elements what would you say then happens after the emplacement of dikes A B and C .
what must happen Cliff ?
like the sea comes back or &~wha it gets deposited under water again ?
okay we need sea level to do something don't we right ?
in in in other words if these rocks are initially under water but now we want them to experience a period of erosion that means that either sea level drops &=writing:board sea level drop is one possibility what's the other possibility ?
weathered away ?
what's that ?
it's weathered away ?
eroded ?
+, &~e what's that ?
it's eroded by .
by currents is that what you're saying ?
no look either sea level can drop so that my rocks become exposed to the surface so that wind and rain and so on are going to start working on those rocks and erode them away or what else can happen mountain building processes ?
couldn't that part get pushed up ?
okay we can have tectonic deformation exactly .
the sediments themselves can be uplifted .
and that's what we can summarize as &=writes:board tectonic deformation +...
okay so we either have sea level change sea level drop or the land itself came up by tectonic deformation .
either one is going to accomplish the same thing .
okay &-um then it looks like in order for more marine sediments to be deposited so let's call these &=writes:board marine sediments +...
and these as well are marine sediments okay so what happens then in order for us to be able to deposit units six through eight ?
after this surface has been exposed to the elements and weathering erosion and so on have taken place then we have what happening ?
sediments from other areas ?
well yeah sediments will eventually come into a basin but I'm telling you that these are marine sediments &=writes:board so we really just have to reverse what we're talking about here so we either have &-uh sea level rise okay or we are going to have tectonic deformation in this case by the way created uplift and in this case tectonic deformation is going to create &-uh subsidence in other words sinking .
the ground sinks and it goes below sea level yet again and therefore we can start depositing new sediments &-uh on top of the original units one through four .
so number five is we have finally &-uh the deposition of units six through eight .
okay so the exercise we just went through is one of placing geologic events in their proper sequence but I haven't really told you exactly when &-uh units one through four &-uh were &-uh deposited okay that is something we can do through what is known as absolute dating okay so what is absolute dating again ?
from what Professor Lohman told you last week ?
putting in <time on it> .
okay so putting in numerical value to a geologic event .
how can we put a numerical value to a geologic event that this must have happened fifty three million years ago .
how do we get that number ?
looking ⌈ at radioactive decay ⌉ ?
radioactive decay ⌋ ?
okay radioactive decay alright so this absolute dating as we shall see at the end of today or beginning of next hour is going to be based on this is a numerical value and the numerical value's going to be based on &-uh radioactivity .
now well before radioactivity was discovered anybody know when radioactivity was discovered ?
⌈ eighteen ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ how ⌋ long ago was that ?
eighteen ninety six .
eighteen ninety six right eighteen ninety six was when radioactivity was discovered but by that time &-uh geologic mapping had been going on for probably two hundred three hundred years okay two hundred or three hundred years .
and the geologic mapping that was done early used concepts of relative dating to come up with divisions and this is where I'm going to mention what I think you should remember .
divisions of time that we can cut into sections like there is a section right in here known as the Cenozoic &=points_to_overhead a section in here known as the Mesozoic a section in here known as the Paleozoic and the earliest time for the earth known as the Precambrian .
where is the word Precambrian ?
right there the Precambrian .
now it was much much later after radioactivity had been discovered that the values that you see here were added to the Geologic Time Scale .
okay so this is the recent addition to the time scale but prior to that we already knew about the Precambrian the Paleozoic the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic .
how were these divisions put in place ?
okay that's the question we should ask ourselves now .
well the Geologic Time Scale okay the most important thing I can tell you about the Geologic Time Scale is based on profound changes in life+forms .
if you walk your way from the Colorado River at this section of the Grand Canyon you will discover that close to the river you're seeing very primitive life+forms .
halfway up the section as you come out_of the canyon you will discover that you begin to see things that you recognize in today's life+forms .
and then near the very top just about everything you see is something that still exists today .
for that reason the Paleozoic is known as early life okay the word Paleozoic means early life and among the creatures of the Paleozoic can anybody think of one what was the dominant life form of the Paleozoic ?
this would have been five hundred and thirty to two hundred and forty four forty five million years ago .
what was the dominant life back then ?
there were a few fish in the oceans but the dominant life+form was actually amphibians .
okay this is before the emergence of reptiles so this time segment in here is dominated by amphibians .
Mesozoic everybody has seen Jurassic Park okay so from that you would be able to tell me that this time horizon in here is dominated by reptiles and Cenozoic which means recent life is dominated by marmal &-uh mammals like you and me okay ?
now I would like you to remember those three terms Paleozoic Mesozoic and Cenozoic the reason being that &-uh later on in our discussions we will need to know what they are I'll simply tell you life+forms of the Mesozoic and you should know what Mesozoic means .
<if you> if you want to you can remember &-uh exactly when each one of these ends but it's not absolutely necessary &-uh the Paleozoic begins five hundred and thirty million years ago ends two hundred and forty five million years ago and everybody has probably seen these &-uh &-uh doomsday movies about asteroids bombarding the earth and so on .
well we think that one may have happened sixty six million years ago when the dinosaurs go extinct .
in other words reptiles &-uh many reptiles go extinct at this particular time and mammals become the dominant life+form &-uh subsequently .
the only other thing I'd like you to remember about the Geologic Time Scale is that ninety percent of geologic time is actually squeezed into just the bottom right here .
okay so ninety percent of geologic time keep in mind that the earth is four point six billion years old four point six billion years old but ninety percent of the existence of the earth or time for the existence of the earth is something that we don't know very much about .
and so we put it more or less under the rug way down here and most of what we know about evolution and so on is since five hundred and thirty million years ago .
now has anybody worried about how we know the age of the earth ?
how do we know that the earth is actually four point six billion years old yes .
don't they &-um they assume that all the whole universe is or all the other space were made at the same time and then they find the age of the rocks then .
okay so this is an assumption that &-uh she's pointing out that we'll come back to a little bit later .
we have to make an assumption about the age of all the objects in the solar system .
our earth has been churned around so that the rocks that existed on its surface initially are no longer there .
okay those rocks have disappeared they've gone inside the interior of the earth so that we have to make the assumption that all the other bodies in the solar system that haven't undergone this churning of the surface formed at the same time as the earth did .
and we'll be evaluating that assumption when we come to that &-uh &-uh discussion in another &-uh few lectures from now .
okay so this age for the earth four point six billion years is really based on dating meteorites .
okay these objects that come flying through space and fall right here on on earth are the ones we use to date the earth or dating the solar system in general and we'll be &~re evaluating that a little bit later on .
so most of what we know about geologic time comprises only about ten percent of the entire history of the earth .
that's very very important .
any questions about this yes .
I read that &-uh the rock found in on the moon ?
yes +/.
+, it's used to &-uh help date the &-uh the age of the .
right right +/.
⌈ I mean ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <no no> ⌋ this churning I'm talking about where the surface of the earth renews itself &-uh probably every two hundred million years or thereabouts every rock on the surface have pretty much &-uh disappeared .
in the ocean basins that is .
on the moon on the other hand &-uh there is absolutely no movement of any crustal blocks so that the earliest rocks to form on the moon are still on its surface .
and when you date rocks on the moon the oldest ones are about four point four billion years old .
so they're not exactly four point six which is what we are claiming the age of the earth to be but they are awfully close to the age of the earth .
so the oldest &-uh rocks on the moon are about four point four billion years .
and in fact if you look at our syllabus you'll discover that &-uh we're going to talk about the origin of the moon and one of the issues we're going to be addressing at that time is why the moon is slightly younger than what we think the age of the solar system to be .
okay ?
another comment ⌈ yes ⌉ ?
⌊ how ⌋ do we know that the moon hasn't been <changing since> its formation ?
that it hasn't been churning its surface ?
well partly because we find very old rocks on its surface but also because it's so small okay because it is so small it is not able to sustain &-um convection in its interior to be able to destroy its original crust .
so its original crust is is still there still preserved .
and that is a topic that &-uh we're going to address in detail when we talk about the origin of the moon &-uh in another few lectures .
now another topic I would like to bring up &-uh which as I said a moment ago was very influential in putting the Geologic Time Scale together okay remember that in identifying recent life middle life and early life correlations were being made over very large distances .
and on the handout I gave you the example I would like to use is of sedimentary layers very much like the ones we drew in our cross sections over there but in this case we are looking at northern Colorado .
&-uh I found this convenient to show you because an oil company went and drilled five holes right here in northern Colorado &-uh over a distance of about a hundred and fifty kilometers they put in five different holes and discovered the following .
there's hole number one they went all the way down to whatever that is &-um a hundred meters or so perhaps deeper than that and they found a sandstone layer there they found a shale right there and they found this &-uh formation that I colored in yellow right there .
then they moved about what &-uh thirty forty kilometers away put another hole in the ground and discovered exactly the same relationships they had seen over here and repeated that five times and you can see this &-uh orange unit appears in all five holes and the yellow unit likewise appears in all five holes .
does that bother anybody ?
that you can actually find a unit like a sandstone shown in orange over a distance of a hundred and fifty two hundred perhaps even a thousand kilometers ?
the reason I ask you &~wha whether it bothers you or not is the following +...
okay this is something I've given you as_well .
if you ever stood at the waterfront at the beach where sediment comes into a standing body of water like the ocean you would be the first one to tell me that right next to the beach here &-um it is not a terribly wide zone over which we're depositing very coarse grains of sand and pebbles and cobbles and so on .
okay so if we take a picture that is an instant in time what we'd discover is that in areas where sediments are deposited we have a very narrow zone over which coarse sediment is going to be deposited .
and if we go in slightly deeper waters it's a very narrow zone over which sand is being deposited and in deeper waters a very narrow zone over which mud or mud stone eventually is being deposited .
so the question I'm asking you is how do we go from very local deposition of sediments in a zone that's no more than a kilometer or so in width to having such a unit actually cover an entire state .
everybody see what the problem is here ?
okay the oil wells that we just drilled in northern Colorado show us that a sandstone unit can actually exist all the way from the Utah border to the Nebraska border .
this is a very very wide area and yet when we look at environments in which sediments are being deposited today we see that any given unit like a sandstone or a conglomerate is being deposited over just a very narrow belt and my question to you is how do we go from having sediments deposited in a very narrow area to having that particular sediment cover an entire state .
how does that happen ?
+, yes ?
conditions were different ?
&-uh in what sense it's gonna hafta do with conditions yes you're right .
as far as like well &-um .
conditions are changing but in what way ?
Drew .
&-um maybe it was all covered by ocean before .
okay what did the ocean do ?
+, so I mean what you're saying is if &-uh if we have an ocean that's rather extensive okay it will still have a beach somewhere .
and what I'm pointing out is well let's take the example of &-uh the eastern seaboard of the United States .
okay there's Florida New York City is over here somewhere Long Island what I'm pointing out here is that we are depositing sand over a very narrow strip if we assume that all of this is beach from New York to Florida .
so it's a very very narrow belt how do we go from having sediments deposited over such a narrow belt to actually covering &=writes:board several states like so as I showed you in the example of Colorado ?
yes .
glaciers ?
what did the glaciers do ?
they carried sediments ?
&-uh they're going to do it locally okay they are going to do it locally .
when we talk about the sediments you find in let's say the Grand Canyon &=writes you know if this is a map of the United States the four corners area &-uh New Mexico Arizona Colorado and Utah are all covered by more or less the same sediments .
okay it's a very very large area .
and glaciation had nothing to do with it .
so you're kind of beating around the bush you say conditions will change the oceans you're all mentioning the right things but in what way specifically did the ocean change ?
if you want to cheat a little bit you can look on the next page that I handed you +...
okay the answer to this question or the answer to this riddle hasta do with the fact that sea level +...
is not invariant .
it actually changes through time .
okay so the image I just showed you a moment ago of having a beach along which we're depositing sand this image right here is just a snapshot if you came back a thousand years from now sea level would not be where you see it today .
that is illustrated by these two diagrams right here .
where in the first diagram we can see that the shoreline is right there .
and if we fast forward in time we can see that the shoreline has moved to over here .
okay so in the first image the new shoreline would be somewhere over here and that is because sea level has risen .
or you could also argue that the basin in which these sediments are being deposited has gone down .
so the idea of shorelines moving inland from where we find them to be today is known as transgression .
transgression is the movement of a shoreline inland from where they are at any given time and regression is the opposite .
okay that would be shoreline moving away &-uh from the continents .
okay so if shorelines can transgress in other words they can move inland what is that going to do to where we're depositing sediments ?
and what does that have to do with sediments being able to cover a very very large area such as several different states ?
in other words I'm asking you to compare picture A to picture B .
okay what happens when the shoreline transgresses moving inland .
(0.4) let's see I have a pointer right here .
&-uh let's consider a particular point such as right here this is a depositional environment that early on you can see is ideal for depositing fairly large pieces of rocks so that the rock that's going to form is known as a conglomerate .
in that particular area .
but now <shoreline change> the &~sh shoreline changes in other words sea level has gone up and the area that we were monitoring before which is right there corresponding to right there is now in deeper waters .
and you can see that where before we were depositing fairly large sediment we are now depositing fairly fine sediment .
okay you appreciate that ?
so in other words we've changed the depth of the water at that particular locality and we asked previously was ideal for conglomerate to accumulate now after the shoreline has moved inland that particular point is under deeper water than previously so we are depositing sand +...
well imagine the shoreline being able to move even further inland in other words that basin is either sinking or sea level is rising very very rapidly and therefore this particular unit being able to form a very very large area that keeps going <on and> on and on for several hundreds of kilometers &-uh inland .
so typically therefore &=writes:board what we would find is what is known as a transgressive &-uh sequence of sediments .
in a transgressive sequence of sediments what you're likely to find as a package is that at the very bottom you're going to have conglomerate +...
okay immediately above that you're going to have sand sized material so the Rockies are sandstone .
and immediately above that you'll have fine grained material the Rockies are shale and then finally you'll have the limestone .
now if you're hiking into the Grand Canyon and you look in these cliffs and you see conglomerate then you see sandstone then you see shale then you see limestone you can actually begin to tell us what sea level was doing when those sediments were being deposited .
you can be reasonably sure that when those sediments were being deposited sea level was rising .
okay because we've just demonstrated that right here &-uh again to continue with the example I was providing before +...
the first rock to be deposited for this particular locality was what turned out to be conglomerate sea level rose so that right above conglomerate we deposited sand &-uh later to become sandstone .
and you can imagine that &-uh if I raise sea level even more to this level right here eventually at that particular locality water will be so deep that I can't deposit sand there anymore .
but instead this unit right here is going to march inland and it will be deposited on top of that .
so I'll have the sequence of conglomerate sandstone and then on top of that I'll have shale very much like we've illustrated here .
okay does everybody get that ?
you can have transgressions that actually cover &-uh hundreds and hundreds of square kilometers so that eventually you might have sediments that cover almost half a continent .
yes Emmanuel .
so the different types of &~ro &-uh rocks have been deposited +/.
⌈ yes ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ due to ⌋ due to their suitability to the environment ?
exactly right what we deposit in any one location is going to be a function of how far we are from the shoreline in other words how high sea level happens to be &-uh in that particular locality okay ?
so eventually over geologic time keep in mind that we're talking about millions and millions of years you will build a transgressive sequence like the sediments we find in the Grand Canyon today that are not just &-uh randomly distributed but there is indeed a systematic order to what you see and that represents sea level rising .
now this invites the other question okay &-uh of if sediments are deposited during sea level drop what order should they exist in ?
as we look at a stratigraphic column very much like this one but those sediments happen to have been deposited when sea level was going down what order should they exist in ?
again it's something you can figure out by looking at &-uh &-uh &-uh a column &~li or rather by looking at a cross section like this okay now let's say that well let's begin with this unit right here .
it's a shale okay where it is right there .
if sea level drops so that now sea level is right here what's going to be deposited on top of the shale ?
sandstone .
it should be sandstone right ?
because the water's going to be now relatively shallow so that the environment here will be ideal for sandstone and &-uh if we drop sea level even further what should be deposited on top of the sandstone ?
conglomerate +/.
+, conglomerate .
so really for regressive sequences you should simply flip this upside+down and you'll see conglomerate on top sandstone shale and then limestone is going to be at the very bottom .
but why is it then that when we go into the Grand Canyon it's very common to find transgressive sequences like this but it is not common to find regressive sequences .
why would that be ?
I mean you should be able to figure this out .
it's easy to find transgressive sequences in any sedimentary pile you look at anywhere in the world but it's very rare to find a regressive sequence preserved Cliff .
it got eroded away ?
okay why ?
mm because &-uh after the sea regressed it was exposed to the elements again and +/.
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ caused the ⌋ unconformity ?
exactly okay notice that during transgression the sediments being deposited are immediately covered up by others by younger sediments so that there is a much better chance of that section being preserved in the geologic record than it is if sea level is dropping .
if sea level is dropping the moment you deposit something like this sand right in here okay and then sea level went to down here well those loose sediments are immediately exposed and they're going to be eroded away .
so regressive sequences are not very common in nature because very shortly after deposition of the sediments they're eroded away simply eroded away .
okay anybody have a question about that ?
transgressions and regressions ?
so basically sediments exist as a unit over very long distances because of sea level transgression .
and in fact I think &-uh I give you a_couple_of examples to finish off here .
&-uh one example is a modern modern example of sea level transgression which &-uh the Netherlands are experiencing today .
okay so I have a_couple_of cross sections here .
on top we are looking at the North Sea and here is the Netherlands or Holland right here and you can see that &-uh four thousand BC or rather four hundred BC so that this is a mere twenty four hundred years ago the shoreline was actually right here .
in the Netherlands .
and at the present time the shoreline has moved to way over here this is why the Dutch have to deal with these dikes in_order_to keep sea level &-uh from inundating their land .
okay the shoreline used to be there now it has marched all the way &-uh to here and you can see that in a place where previously sand was being deposited that's what these little dots are the water now is so deep that mud is what's being deposited so on top of sandstone we are now having &-uh shale being deposited .
and when you go north of there to the Scandinavian countries &-uh you see exactly the opposite .
okay so let's see where was &-uh sea level at &-uh let's see where does this go ?
six thousand BC &-uh the shoreline was way over here okay and at the present time the shoreline is right there .
so it has actually retreated so in other words sea level happens to be dropping in Scandanavia .
how do we explain that ?
let's see if we have &-uh a map to show the region we're talking about here .
okay there is &-uh &-uh Great Britain so the Netherlands would be somewhere in here and here is Scandanavia .
so the area we're talking about is actually not very large right ?
&-uh Holland over here Scandanavia over here we're saying that sea level has gone up over here sea level has gone down over here .
how could that be ?
how could it be that sea level is doing two different things not very far +...
from each_other those two localities .
how could that be ?
different rock formations .
different rock formations ?
that +/.
+, can you think of anything that has happened in the last say fifteen twenty thousand years that might be influencing what we're looking at here +..?
the last fifteen thousand years or so ?
+, ⌈ <it was glaciers> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ fifteen thousand ⌋ years ago could we have had the University of Michigan right here ?
<we couldn't> .
why not ?
⌈ <covered by> glaciers ⌉ .
⌊ glaciers ⌋ .
there were glaciers okay there were &~s about three kilometers of ice right where you're sitting .
okay very very thick ice and certainly there was a tremendous amount of glaciation in the Scandinavian countries and believe it or not when you have several kilometers of ice sitting on top of the crust it depresses the rocks .
very much like putting a big chunk of rock on a sponge okay the sponge &-uh is depressed downwards .
rocks that form the crust can likewise be depressed and after the glaciation has gone away &-uh Scandinavia happens to be rebounding very much like a sponge would rebound and guess what happens to &~s to &-uh Holland over here ?
when this rebounds it's almost like pulling on a handkerchief or a shirt you can see that a moat hasta build around this topographic high and okay so Scandinavia's going up and all the area around Scandanavia hasta be going down .
this is known as isostatic rebound reequilibration &=writes:board isostatic rebound .
okay so it is not that the North Sea is changing &-uh &-uh its sea level what is actually happening is that &-uh over here the land is going down and over here in Scandanavia the land is going up as a result of &-uh glacial rebound .
and &-uh okay so we've run out_of time the final page on the handouts is just an illustration of a transgressive sequence in the Grand Canyon .
okay and of_course you'll notice that we have sands at the bottom &-uh then shale then limestone very much like we've just described &-uh over here .
okay on Thursday I'll begin by describing or defining exactly what radioactivity is and we can continue on from there .
see you Thursday
