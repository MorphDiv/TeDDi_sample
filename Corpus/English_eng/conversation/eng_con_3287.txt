okay, I don't get it . 0_928
okay . 928_1215
well +... 1215_1473
maybe you divide it by one or something, so that would be +... 1473_4208
well, how would you get a negative n@l up there looking at your rules of exponents ? 4208_8776
look at your rules of exponents up there, and where do you think you can get a negative n@l ? 8776_16088
oh, a@l times m@l over a@l times n@l equals a@l m@l minus n@l . 16088_21016
okay . 21016_21455
so therefore m@l would have to be larger than n@l . 21455_24448
right ? 24448_24848
yeah . 24848_25473
so you can prove that to me using that law . 25473_29473
think about it . 29473_30543
we don't understand this . 30543_31815
okay . 31815_32445
now, Ryan, I figured you'd have this solved in no time . 32445_36125
I I I can't work with them . 36125_37381
work with us ? 37381_39040
it's weird . 39040_39800
we don't under +... 39800_41828
I remember learning this a long time ago . 41828_44800
like, it was one of those questions xxx . 44800_46913
it was like one of those brain stumpers . 46913_48201
yeah . 48201_48480
and +... 48480_48776
where you had to like xxx . 48776_49551
okay . 49551_49851
so let's look at of our laws of exponents . 49851_51446
we can add, we can multiply, and we subtract, and we can divide . 51446_56206
right ? 56206_56898
and we can divide . 56898_57683
yeah . 57683_58068
so think if I want you to set up a problem so that the solution would be a@l to the zero power . 58068_64025
what kind of problem could you give me ? 64025_66138
I don't know . 66138_67361
a multiplication problem . 67361_68513
with exponents . 68513_71435
with exponents . 71435_72935
with exponents . 72935_73911
a@l to the one . 73911_76705
yeah . 76705_77926
okay . 77926_78423
a@l to the one and then what would I have to do to a@l to the one so that it becomes a@l to the zero . 78423_81911
divide it . 81911_83335
minus it . 83335_83855
xxx divided by what ? 83855_84568
one . 84568_85208
one . 85208_85606
by one or by +... 85606_86855
zero . 86855_87995
let's see . 87995_89345
write that down . 89345_89858
a@l to the one . 89858_90763
divided by okay . 90763_95096
now since we're doing division, what does the rules of exponents say ? 95096_98313
oh you have to minus, right ? 98313_101266
so it says that what you're going to do to get this, and we want this, put this equal a@l to the zero . 101266_106793
to equal ? 106793_108386
a@l to the zero . 108386_109435
okay . 109435_110146
what do we do about division rules ? 110146_111740
what do we know about division rules ? 111740_116185
what what's what's one of the rules ? 116185_117785
you have to minus, minus . 117785_120281
you subtract the +... 120281_121285
you subtract the top exponent from the bottom . 121285_122515
yes . 122515_122958
so how am I going to what am I gonna put down here +/. 122958_126348
one a@l ? 126348_128303
+, such that this would be zero when I'm done ? 128303_130845
a@l to the one . 130845_131651
a@l to the one . 131651_132260
okay . 132260_132963
so it'd be a@l to the zero, and +... 132963_136885
now is a@l to the one over a@l to the one equal to a@l to the zero ? 136885_139765
yeah . 139765_140580
no . 140580_141228
okay . 141228_142068
is it ? 142068_143073
by your rules, what do you do ? 143073_145035
yeah . 145035_145411
you subtract . 145411_146186
(be)cause you subtract xxx . 146186_146890
you go one minus one is zero . 146890_147700
okay . 147700_148083
now, what do you know about math when a number is over itself ? 148083_152586
they cancel out . 152586_154360
and what does it equal ? 154360_155610
zero . 155610_156441
one . 156441_158025
one . 158025_158666
one . 158666_159068
no . 159068_159698
come on . 159698_160106
what does a@l divided by a@l equal ? 160106_162208
one . 162208_162691
okay . 162691_163871
so, now if we do this division, what answer do we have here ? 163871_166755
one . 166755_168250
one . 168250_168890
and what's that equal to ? 168890_169585
zero . 169585_170041
no . 170041_171745
what does that say ? 171745_172870
a@l to the zero . 172870_173983
and what is that equal to ? 173983_175575
one . 175575_176613
one . 176613_177048
now didn't you just prove it ? 177048_178550
yeah . 178550_178958
yeah . 178958_179333
so how do you write that out ? 179333_180783
oh . 180783_181676
I +... 181676_182238
can we just show that ? 182238_182685
all right . 182685_184283
that's it . 184283_186105
that's real easy . 186105_187493
now, see you guys figured this out . 187493_188388
so now with the next problem, we use the same type of logic to solve the second set . 188388_194271
okay . 194271_194588
all right . 194588_195085
okay . 195085_195613
now was it as hard as you thought ? 195613_197101
yep . 197101_197853
sure . 197853_198548
easy . 198548_199903
okay . 199903_202720
you guys, we need to wrap it up . 202720_204353
shh ! 204353_205495
we need to wrap it up . 205495_207551
I will give you time in class tomorrow to finish up . 207551_210583
I know most of you will probably take this home and go, Mom and Dad help ! 210583_215528
don't worry about it . 215528_217435
if you don't come up with a solution, we will work through and prove this for you . 217435_223143
okay ? 223143_224053
do we have homework tonight ? 224053_225113
yes, you have your assignments . 225113_226695
you have homework tonight . 226695_227576
oh . 227576_228080
see ya . 228080_230341
the first one . 230341_231615
bye Miss Scott . 231615_232401
I love you . 232401_232955
you're the best teacher in the whole wide world . 232955_237025
we think you're the bomb . 237025_238875
