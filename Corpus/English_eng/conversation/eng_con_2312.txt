yes so obviously the big thing to talk about is . 0_3774
release . 3637_4460
release . 4460_5764
because apparently no one knows what we're doing 5695_7822
I mean we do but no one else does 7822_10636
so 10567_11528
so we're recording them using your iPad and then making transcripts 12420_16948
no I might bring an interface and an actual microphone probably 16880_21134
I wasn't sure if we were gong for like the subtle like people aren't aware that they're being recorded 22438_27721
the idea is that they should know but we shouldn't make it blatantly obvious 27721_31015
we should know but we shouldn't like put a cam 31221_33348
we shouldn't like stand in front of them like shoving a mic in their face and be like 33356_36786
that would just make them nervous 36573_37945
exactly, that's 37945_38700
that'a what we wanted to avoid 38700_40415
a big giant microphone is staring at them 40347_42748
well usually in Japanese class they record all of the presentations and stuff 43983_48512
what they do is just take a regular old tape recorder and put it on the table 48443_51943
okay 56197_56952
I'm just not sure if 57158_58187
I feel like I can type fast enough 59010_60383
You're sayig that it's not necessary ? 62579_64980
I mean we're bound to miss something 64980_66764
okay I mean as long as 69097_71156
as long as we are fine with taking the time afterwards to go through all of them and that we know that we can tell people that in a way that 71156_79390
because the whole point is that we just need to make sure that people actually talk about something and then we can get a written version of it 81517_88104
yes
part of the thing is that nobody ever took notes before and didn't even try 89103_92123
I think as long as they're okay with being recorded I think that's the better solution because it's more thorough and that's more correct 93564_102758
if you think taking notes is a viable alternative 103650_107012
it could also be very distracting 106944_108728
someone's like typing away and it's like 109345_111198
and like and at thi at this hour they said something so insightful and now they've said something really dumb 111747_118746
don't put that on the record 118677_119707
whipe that from the record 121010_122177
um 122451_123549
but yes um food 125264_127254
are we going to have food for release ? 127254_130205
I think I think before we talk about food we should talk about how we want to 130205_133842
yes this is true 133842_135420
so we've got uh how many groups do we have twelve, thirteen ? 135420_139056
thirteen 138851_139331
thirteen 139262_140017
um 140508_141400
well okay Space Game was the fourteenth one 141949_145037
no, the fourteenth one was Not Asteroids 145037_148331
oh right that was the one that died 148331_149978
yeah 149978_150389
uh Space Game I think should still present 150321_153408
they went long enough that they 153340_154987
yeah 154918_155536
I think I I think their postmortem could actually be useful 155536_159653
if he sticks at all to the postmortem thing it will be useful and if he completely doesn't do anything relevant to what a postmortem is 159447_165897
then 166171_166789
it's not a very good postmortem 166926_168641
well if he uses this to start another politics debate 168161_171729
maybe have him do some 172141_174199
right 174131_174611
cause you can say what about GCS's policies didn't allow the project to do whatever but 175846_180924
well if it gets 180992_181816
instead of starting like a flame war 181541_182845
yeah if it gets into an off topic flame war 182708_185590
was he saying that before ? 185384_186482
yeah 186413_186962
last meeting 187236_188128
not not last meeting 190118_191216
it was the last meeting of Space Game where he said he was cancelling the project and we asked him what the problem was and he basically went on this flame war rant about why GCS sucks 191010_203087
yeah that was fun um 204253_206792
but if it gets to that we'll just tell him to stop and move on 206724_210429
I think we're gonna have to time limit them anyway 210360_213311
yeah, we're definitely gonna have to time limit them 212899_215644
we're gonna have to cut it off at five minutes ? 215438_216948
we we wanna have room for Q and A 216948_218457
that's cause that's what happened the last Spring was a bunch of people left as soon as they could 218732_223192
but a lot of peole stayed 223123_224770
but not nearly as many people as you would who were there 224682_227633
so do you wanna try four minutes and just no Q and A ? 228113_231819
I would just say keep it at five minute cause some groups might have less to say and we might have more time for questions 232711_238131
well we could mention that you should try to be concise and not take up time if you don't need to in the email 237994_245130
yeah but also like when we play the games a lot of the times it's the creator that's standing right next to the game and that's another time you can ask questions 245062_252198
that's true and then and then they don't feel like they're being grilled by the whole club if they're the one up there whereas like you can like as an alternative we can go up to Chris afterwards and then say all right why don't you think like the club is condu conducive to your games 252129_267980
well but the real reason we like Q and A during postmortems is because there are interesting questions that can benefit the rest of the club 267911_275390
yes 275322_275802
yeah 275733_276145
and they would also be good to have on record 276145_278409
would an hour and a half be too long to do all of them ? 278409_281223
I don't think so 281703_282595
okay cause if we gave everybody seven minutes and said 282526_285271
just like five minutes for 285202_286300
well well we could say five minute cutoff for speaking, two minute cutoff for Q and A 286575_291927
an hour would be fine which is about five minutes 291858_294397
well how about four minutes for speaking and a minut for Q and A ? 294672_298034
well I don't wanna like restrict anybody to anything but I would just cut it off, see how it goes and cut it off 297965_302357
I don't think that everyone will be seven minutes 302288_304758
um 304964_305856
you'd be surprised 305788_307160
five minutes and then at the end of five minutes whatever just cut them off, have the next person go and that should be a little over an hour 307137_313038
yeah 312969_313518
okay 314685_315302
and then we can have food and games 315371_317018
I still think five minutes is, I dunno, i it's a problem because we have so many groups and 319099_323559
but it's, but that's still only, that's like an hour and ten minutes cause if you, if you give every group like thirty seconds between 323559_331244
we could try to do food during the Q and A so people would 331175_333783
I'm not sure if that would be distracting and that if that would also like encourage people to stay by saying that there's pizza 333783_341056
all right, I have an idea; why don't we try something different ? 341163_344113
why don't have them speak with a five minute cutoff and then have all of them stand in front as as a panel and then have people ask whoever they want questions or just the 344281_354299
there's thirteen groups, people will forget what the people at the very beginning said 354230_358896
cause it's like what happened at Pitch Fair when everybody did their thing and at the end nobody could remember 359857_365209
who said what 365141_365964
yeah 365964_366513
yeah 366513_366925
that was actually the biggest problem with Pitch Fair 366856_368914
it's a little bit different but I feel like it's easier to ask questions like right when everybody's thinking about whatever you're asking about 367885_374747
I I think that's the case 374747_376119
I guess it depends on what kind of questions we want them to ask 375982_378727
if they're questions specifically about the things that were just said then sure, but if they're more general things like 378658_387647
I remember asking Chris like really general general questions last time just cause I knew that he'd have interesting things to say, um, and that would be the kind of thing for like a panel but my, the problem is that it's a lot of people and I think that would work better for like five people or something, but for thirteen I think that's probably too many 389774_407889
cause when you add with Lisa and Sanchez and, and uh Paul and Audra 408675_413890
this is why we seriously need to start limiting the number of projects that get made 413478_418556
well 418487_418899
how ? 418899_419379
that's, I mean the whole 419791_420820
we'll discuss that later 420752_421507
the whole point of the, having smaller projects is that there are going to be significantly more of them 421438_425486
yeah, there would actually be more projects if we had shorter projects 426516_429192
there wouldn't necessarily be more semester projects, there would just be more projects 429398_432279
we probably handle those a bit differently 432211_434338
there'd be less at a given time 433995_435642
right, if we had smaller projects, you wouldn't have one day when there are like seventy-x that you'd need to present 436740_443327
so yeah, the food 446689_447855
um, are we gonna have food during the, uh, you know, during the postmortems or after ? 448061_455335
wait, what did we do last 455335_456433
well, last Spring, it showed up when we were sitting there and it was just sitting there 456433_459795
yeah, yeah, and it was really awkward cause everyone kept looking at the pizza 459795_463363
so why don't we let people eat ? 463363_464735
yeah 464735_465215
we could just order it so it comes an hour into the meeting 465215_468578
see I could, the only problem that I have is that when you server greesy pizza while people are playing games 468578_473449
the thing is though, it's fine as long as there are napkins 473381_476880
yeah 476880_477292
I think eating pizza while the postmortems are going on is kind of distracting and rude because people would be constantly getting up and getting pizza and not really paying attention, and it's the most important part, I dunno 477363_489370
if it's the most important part, why are we compressing it so much for the other thing ? 489302_494105
because playing the games and talking to people individually is also really important and it's kind of, we can't have everyone play their game while giving a postmortem but if nobody gets a chance to play everyone else's game because everyone's a lazy-ass and doesn't give their builds, I think they're both just as important 495272_511945
right 511945_512426
I'd say we don't wanna sacrifice one for the other because they are equally important 513935_519425
postmortems are a thing that happens only once a semester, but those games will be played again when they're more polished in the future 519425_528482
yeah 528413_528688
for example the arcade, uh, late night, there would be plenty of chances 528688_533354
and Release in the Spring 532942_534452
to be actually getting to get 535069_536304
it is in the Spring, but 536304_537677
seeing your hard work from this semester pay off in the form of someone playing and enjoying your game, I think is a big part of feeling like you're done, like that the semester is actually over 537951_548244
why don't we do the game-playing thing first, and then postmortems, out of curiosity ? 548381_552910
because people would leave, well that was, I thought, the initial problem 552841_557164
yeah, I think postmortems are a tougher sell to keep an audience than games 556752_561967
like let's play games, and then everybody gets really into it and they're like, guys stop having fun, let's talk about this 561575_566996
there's really no easy solution 566928_569261
well, no, if you want the pizza to come an hour in, I can do that too 569192_572760
what do you guys think ? 574132_575436
it's fine 575367_575985
I think that would be good 576054_577357
having, having postmortems then pizza come right as they're ending 578249_581200
well, it is gonna take time for everybody to set their laptops up, then get the games ready to play anyway, so we might as well be able to eat 581063_588130
and I'm thinking the pizza could bribe them into staying 588062_591218
well that's, yeah that's when we're eating 591149_593276
like, they'd have the pizza to look forward to after the postmortems are done 593318_597229
I'm trying to imagine what an exodus would look like if we said like all right, we're gonna stop playing games now, and then, you know, postmortems, and everybody sit down in a chair 597229_607110
everybody but the project leaders would leave 607110_609237
I'm trying to, yeah 609237_610129
I don't think it would be that bad 610060_611913
well okay, two thirds of everybody but the project leaders would leave 612462_616510
assuming they came in the first place 616853_618569
let's see what else is there 628861_630234
is there anything else ? 630234_631469
um, we need to send out an email, we should do that as soon as possible, like today 631537_635243
about Release ? 635997_636958
about, about just telling, telling project leaders, well about Release to the whole club, but also to the project leaders specifically 636958_643065
I can do that today 643408_644231
we also, um, need to ask for builds of the games from last semester's right now only Moonwalk is up, cause I put it up there, um 644231_653906
can somebody who has the list of the projects from the last, this semester and last semester, I guess, send that to me so I can check off what I have and 653838_663650
bother people ? 663650_664405
okay 664405_665091
I mean I was going to, at the end of this semester, just bug everyone 665571_669102
okay, then you can do that too 669034_670475
make sure when you ask them about builds, you ask them about like the people who were on their team and, and uh, like a description or something like that too . 670406_679463
right 679875_680561
what do we do about the people who graduated ? 680904_682688
oh 684541_684884
like Sarah 684884_685913
well, I was on that project 686462_687835
that was fun 688452_689481
I think I can find a way to contact Sarah in any case 689550_693393
yeah, we don't have much of an alumni program 693530_695520
well we have more, uh yeah, you're right 696069_697853
they can stay on the mailing list, they just need to either change their email themselves or ask us to change it for them 698196_706087
but I have all the project members for Panda Cook and that was, that would be easy enough to write a description for it so just a build for that 706979_715556
all right, so anything else in regards to postmortems ? 719360_721830
right basically, brief summary 723134_725124
um, we're limiting postmortems to high, hard cap of uh, five minutes for each postmortem, cause uh if it they drag on too long, everyone will leave before they can play the games 725055_736102
um 736926_737749
and we're gonna be recording them, and then transcribe them later 738984_742896
so what should we talk about now ? 743307_745023
I mean that was 745366_746189
and then, and then after postmortems, we play games 746189_750238
yes 751267_751610
how much food do you think we should get ? 752022_754835
uh, I usually go by uh, dollar amount, so between like one twenty and one fifty, however much pizza I can get for that much money is usually 757648_768078
that's cool 768627_769519
I think that should cover it 769999_772263
I'm not sure how many people are gonna show up 773979_776586
so I think by comparison, I think the last, uh the last two Collab Sessions were like seventy dollars 776943_787098
yeah, they should be about equal 787853_789157
so yes, we've got the uh, then we've got, also got Paolo's event, do we want to talk about that briefly ? 789431_796430
let's talk about that 796430_797253
okay, so Paolo has an event on the eleventh, which is essencially, um, it's it's essencially like GCS arcade where it would be we all show our games at, to the public 797253_811732
what date is this again ? 811869_813104
you said the seventh ? 813173_813996
the eleventh 813996_814682
oh, got it 814682_815368
it's a Saturay, isn't it ? 815231_816535
yeah, so did he, did he change the time so that it's not at the same time as BVW ? 816535_819966
I don't think so 819838_821074
okay 821005_822034
it's at, it's at the same time as the invite-only BVW, it's not the same time as the first show, which is open to the public 822652_828759
so it's the VIP show 828759_829857
yeah 829857_830405
um 830611_831366
but it's the VIP show, and it's cooler 831366_833081
yeah, and you have to be invited 834179_836512
which we were, but I don't think we need, apparently we need paper invitations, and there's no way they're gonna print out paper invitations for the entire club 836718_844403
he, he said like in the email he could possibly be, possibly like print out actual invitations for us, but yeah, it's, it was mainly like an 845570_854627
just that the VIP's later so they have more time to practice their acting cause it's like, there's also a performance aspect, so it's the same thing 855588_861009
yeah 860803_861420
okay 862038_862518
yeah, if people aren't as cool or, yeah so it doesn't overlap with the public one, so it would be okay 863890_870340
when is the public one ? 869174_870409
one, I think 871232_872056
oh, so it's the same day 871987_873771
one until I, I think the next one is at like five or seven or later in the evening 873840_877339
cause, the problem is if they're right one after the other, we'd need time to s, get out of there and set up 877408_882897
yeah 882897_883378
the thing for Paolo 883309_884905
or we could always leave early 887307_888885
wha, what kind of set-up would we have to do ? 889160_891355
I'm not sure 891355_892453
we're probably just gonna have to plug in our laptops because 892590_895678
how big is the space gonna be ? 895678_896982
we assumed Paolo is doing most of the set-up since it's his event 896913_900893
yeah, we were told that he has like tables and power cords for us 900893_905216
so it sounds like that 905216_907206
how many tables does he want ? 907480_909333
what ? 909264_909882
oh so basically we still don't know what's going on 911254_913381
