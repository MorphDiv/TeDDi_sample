had it first . 140_750
and how did you have it first . 2610_3710
&-um . 4540_4660
that that was touching that remember . 39350_42140
no I know . 43100_43630
but I got it this one . 43940_44990
oh see that is something you guys have to pay attention to . 46620_49110
ooh . 49300_49420
this one's not right . 49440_50220
is it this one has a mistake . 50430_52460
what I'm noticing is . 52550_53190
look at all your other ones which triangles touch the edge of the
oh . 58100_58220
and this one's not right either . 58320_59390
aha . 60580_60750
that's what we've been spending . 61300_62540
all of yours are the orange closest to the center . 63020_65379
and the red ones are the outside edge . 65459_66790
and these just got reversed . 66840_67950
so just those two parts of these two you need to fix you need to
shapes are still up . 77980_78650
front . 78720_78990
and then you guys will be ready to glue down . 79250_80790
that was what was causing . 80840_81550
you problem . 81620_81900
so <these are> these are the wrong way . 81960_84230
well . 84850_85030
this is the way you're &-um . 85300_87020
see this . 87500_88020
Red's supposed . 88120_88500
right here . 89690_90110
oh so the . 90680_90970
reds . 91150_91340
the reds are the red . 91500_93240
yeah these . 93530_93980
are right . 94120_94430
red and orange tangles . 94500_95510
just . 96320_96560
got just on those . 96320_96820
two those . 97090_97580
two . 98200_98280
then I think we'll be able to get your design the way you want . 98470_100910
okay . 101550_101820
but how . 119180_119500
did you decide then . 119600_120500
why does this one go here . 121260_122500
why doesn't it go . 123700_124510
so that it lines these up like a check report . 124700_127270
that's what you told me you were doing . 128340_129380
is lining all the big and little ones up like a checkerboard can go
and there see it's . 139780_141030
this and then . 142110_146640
yeah . 151070_151300
and then that last row . 151700_152960
okay . 154350_154620
then let's check it in . 154640_155550
this is why I didn't want anyone to do before we talk . 155600_157630
so now everywhere I look whatever I am looking at . 157700_162140
I will see . 162320_162820
okay . 163810_163910
see here the single row of like the big squares just . 164420_167060
square squares . 167220_168010
or . 168230_168340
and then here's a double row of the squares in a checkerboard . 168500_171230
can . 171300_171470
here's a single row of the squares . 171820_173660
here's . 174180_174540
wait . 177510_177660
here's a single . 177930_178460
and there's another single and another single . 179100_181540
hmm . 182120_182510
I didn't have that . 183040_184310
but it does keep your pattern going that . 190260_191870
you said that you were gonna do when you &-um to me about it . 191920_195470
you said that where the squares gonna come together like a
and then the rectangles were kind of like a a checkerboard
also when they came together kind of not exactly because . 205310_209710
yellow . 210580_210710
on . 213620_213690
the double row . 213840_214380
and then here we end up or . 214420_216270
is it supposed to be . 216420_217260
yeah .
'cause you glue these . 217900_218290
two with the . 218450_218910
the squares together . 219420_220350
and then these have to be the rectangles together . 225260_227140
so here if you got the squares under the squares and the rectangles
hmm .
is your . 236340_236710
can we talk about one of these for a minute . 237070_238340
is your two by two design . 238500_239860
symmetrical . 239950_240590
well it either is or it doesn't . 243530_244760
that . 249670_249940
symmetrical that . 250100_250740
way should I okay . 251580_256790
&-uh so is your course where I mean your two by two symmetrical . 274470_277420
this way yellow . 289140_289990
something . 290230_290680
all your families will be on the list too . 291940_293470
that list is everything about quilt you've saved so far . 293520_296110
okay . 297710_297950
&-um oh wait that one's not that that one must have gotten
that's not in the right position . 304800_305850
is it 'cause that was . 306020_307030
no . 308540_308690
there we go . 312130_312710
okay . 312790_313030
why don't you guys move that down . 313080_314790
I'll be back . 316680_317070
hi . 321460_321610
hello . 324130_324410
how you doing today . 326670_327350
okay . 335540_335680
smiley face . 336100_336670
should I do it your way facing you or him me . 338080_342060
okay . 342970_343180
facing you . 343890_344230
then you do face me . 347940_349140
was &-uh we have a circle on the face . 355940_358350
I don't care if that's how I do . 359320_360750
smiley faces . 360890_361430
now glue it down . 363140_363910
no it's raining on them . 366460_367870
okay . 406110_406340
let's keep working . 406410_407060
on your Sym character . 407100_408060
let's see where &-um which are you thinking of as the top of your .
quilt . 414040_414190
&-um chair . 415100_416990
okay . 417750_417940
so this is be the top and the middle and the bottom . 417960_419650
so right now I would be looking at the quilt and fish position . 419900_422670
okay . 422870_423140
what did you do with your two by twos . 423750_425240
what . 425910_426180
arrangement . 426200_426590
did you put . 426750_427210
and then no . 429740_430700
no . 431540_431710
you have to have you have to talk to me about copying the two by
&-um . 436420_436550
we we think that this is how it's it's exists . 436980_439810
okay . 440340_440580
okay . 448590_448740
so this one's all right . 448880_449860
turn of a quarter . 450030_450780
good . 450950_451170
we did the same . 451420_452450
okay . 453750_454020
so this whole row going down the first question says . 454040_456390
right . 456580_456700
turn a quarter right . 456720_457620
turn a quarter right . 457640_458420
turn a quarter . 458440_458940
and what did you . 459300_459870
okay . 460790_461020
yeah . 461040_461220
that is a copy of your core . 461270_462450
'cause I remember you showed me that on that top . 462950_464750
right was that big yellow green drive right . 465250_468230
okay . 468390_468600
and then what'd you do in this part . 468760_469770
in the frame right there . 470300_471190
okay . 472590_472860
why did you &-um why did you think that that would be a good
'cause it patterns . 481610_482360
okay . 483020_483140
show me some of the pattern . 483310_484250
first Jillian you showed me a pattern you see . 485030_486700
and then Justin will ask you to show me a different . 486760_488540
table sideways . 488600_490070
&-um and sideways . 491260_495040
I don't really understand that pattern . 501040_502230
you'll have to talk to me about that pattern . 502310_503630
more . 503790_504030
what's . 504660_505030
turn left right . 505710_507540
turn right . 507750_508660
one fourth . 508740_509180
mhm . 509220_509510
and then it's original push . 510300_512220
and then turn right one fourth . 514220_515669
because the yellow on the big yellow triangle goes that . 517010_521350
way . 521690_521820
okay . 521970_522110
so that's one pattern that you see . 522450_523770
'cause that repeats in each row . 524169_525390
turn right . 526310_526780
a quarter copy two by two . 526840_528820
turn right a quarter turn right . 529060_531120
a quarter copy the two by two . 531680_532950
turn the two by two right a quarter . 533230_534460
St Justin what other patterns are you seeing in the finished qui .
I'm thinking of the shape . 538380_538980
I'm thinking of the shape of the house . 539740_541190
okay . 541990_542260
house . 543130_543230
<how sideways> how sideways . 543860_545330
how up how how sideways how sideways . 546060_548440
okay . 549190_549430
can you show me that same pattern somewhere else in the quilt . 549480_552220
the one that goes . 552240_552590
how sideways . 553130_553550
how sideways house up house down . 553740_555900
how sideways . 556080_556500
how sideways . 556690_557080
how sideways . 557900_558540
how sideways up house down . 558900_560640
keep going . 563490_564430
okay . 565630_565900
so is this row here like . 566180_567390
