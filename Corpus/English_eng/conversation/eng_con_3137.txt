sideways I flipped it up and down . 160_1220
I turned it right . 1550_2180
I turned it left . 2320_2990
I turned it a half . 3160_3860
I turned it a quarter . 3960_4740
and I can't get it to look that way . 5110_6220
but I know it can look that way . 6260_7460
that is my core square . 7510_8620
and what they have to figure out is . 9140_10470
oh first I flipped it sideways . 10820_13220
then I turned it a quarter turn . 13750_15320
&-um so those combinations are the hardest for them to think
they know it's their course where they know . 23750_25340
they juggled them to get the design they wanted . 25360_27900
but actually saying . 28020_28780
what did you do to get it in this position . 28910_31180
takes a_lot_of thought . 31680_32500
and I think we saw that yesterday with the the pretest kind of
they all struggled on the one that where she did two things . 39150_42470
they either told about the first thing or the last thing or were so
so that's something we'll sort through with the Quilt family
but I think they did a good job &-um thinking about something so
probably later today we'll &-um we'll do the same activity . 58040_62180
but we'll use triangles like &-um if you can use your yellow and
and I'm hoping that as we do that and record . 71060_74110
and I'm gonna have them record on graph paper something that they
as each way they found we just wiped them away and tried to think
and then tried to share this afternoon they'll be working . 83420_85820
individually first creating something on their course per building
recording it on graph paper which is much harder than it sounds for
and what which of those squares did I divide in half . 99960_102380
and which of those squares is a solid is very challenging . 102400_105460
and then getting with partners to share what's on their graph paper
and to see if by pooling their ideas they can come up with a
what are all the course scores from this . 113720_115220
and then we'll do our class sharing . 115380_117460
and I think we'll do a we'll have a lot less of times . 118080_120300
when kids say like twice in a row we say an idea that's already
&-um and the reason that I'm gonna make them take all of the time
and if they don't make some inroads today . 145870_147060
when you only have to record one square you don't have to imagine
flipped . 151430_151580
you don't have to imagine what it looks like . 151620_153020
turned . 153040_153340
you don't have to do you know six strips in a row and show a design
you just have to record exactly that &-um arrangement of triangles
so after watching me this morning use the graph paper as a tool
but it's still gonna &-um it's still gonna take a_lot_of time . 169760_172400
but <that's our> that's our goal . 172540_173780
for the rest of today and then Monday we will be making two sided
that was really neat . 179690_180300
Tony goes . 180350_180820
well you could if you've colored it on the back . 180840_182750
and I was like . 182900_183470
yeah it is you're right . 183520_184340
if it was just paper we put it we wouldn't be able to show . 184360_186780
&-uh we'll be making those on Monday and do &-uh doing some of the
so they'll be designing their own core squares and then making two
so that when they flip their core they see exactly what it looks
so they don't have to &-um visualize they can see that . 206780_209010
and that's where we're going from here . 209430_210670
any other questions that about today . 210950_212260
just what_if we come back then they think you're gonna do it this
&-um this afternoon . 220070_222110
I don't know when we'll get to that . 222330_223390
today's O's last day on Sod's last day . 223410_225080
and I have two students who are leaving at noon . 226310_228430
but &-uh they've had it for right now . 228510_230440
I mean they're gonna have by the time they have birthday snack . 230570_232830
and they have milk . 232910_233640
and they do some winding downtime . 234540_236270
we'll probably either do some number problems related to the
or we'll do some background on quilts something like that . 246190_249390
we need to go away from this for a while . 250000_251720
and then sometime later this afternoon I don't know &-um when that
how do you think it will be different . 261010_262200
now that we're using triangles and what will you . 262440_265230
need to pay attention to and . 265250_266790
how will you know for sure that each new way you record is
we're building that . 273220_273760
what will you be asking yourself to check . 273960_276110
am I really making a different Core square . 276410_279070
and that's the most important part of that thing . 279610_281150
it's not really the ones they design . 281170_282550
I mean our chart at the end will show what we found out about that
and their records will go in there quilt folders . 285910_288720
and then &-um I think I'll do &-um a journal entry about
what are you thinking today . 300440_301350
really what is your understanding about Foursquare 'cause
and we've talked a lot . 305470_306430
that's fundamental . 307150_308510
I mean if they aren't understanding how we're going to use that
then then I know that Monday needs to be more time for that . 313240_316710
or I just need to know who I'm checking in with . 316790_318790
so that that doesn't we don't just get days beyond what that is
don't . 324540_324740
&-um so those are probably our things for the afternoon . 325600_328030
I think we can get all of that on audio tape . 328250_330550
okay be just fine . 330830_331840
so then do you think it would be . 332070_333270
but Monday I think you should come . 333430_334990
because &-um right never before the actual process that they go
and how they do that because that also that sounds very easy . 343590_346030
you just what it it's not they struggle . 346190_348910
that's very abstract . 348990_350270
and they don't even recognize when they're struggling with it
so we would like that on videotape because that becomes that's as
and then it has a flip side . 360780_361820
I mean they need to know that you know that flips are different
and that's another way they sort that out . 366270_367780
just turning it . 367930_368630
one side is fine . 368820_369660
but if you have to get into flipping it you have to be able to
where is that upper left corner going to end up if I do a sideways
okay . 382230_382400
so Monday would be great . 382700_383390
