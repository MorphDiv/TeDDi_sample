one night in New_york a policeman was walking his beat .
and was checking the doors of several business as he was walking
and noticed a man standing in the doorway of one of the businesses
as he approached the man .
the man spoke quickly .
good evening officers .
he explained that he was waiting for a friend .
who had promised to meet there twenty years ago .
saying that it used to be a restaurant .
can't remember the exact name, Big_Bob_Brady's or something like
after speaking to the officer, .
the officer left saying that the friend should be there in twenty
if not he knew he wouldn't be coming .
after twenty minutes a tall man was coming across the street .
directly towards him and spoke .
he replied and they chatted .
the man lit a cigar .
the man said if the restaurant was still there they could have a
so why don't we go to another place .
and walked down to a corner in a more well lit area .
and the man recognized it wasn't his friend .
and the tall man said he was under arrest for the past ten minute .
and handed him a note which read .
I guess it was from the friend .
bowling and a senior PBA regional at Fort_Meade .
went through the qualifying rounds .
did pretty good .
made match play .
finished eighth in the tournament .
after the tournament a gentleman walked up to me .
and I recognize him as the editor of a local bowling magazine .
he said +"/.
+" Ron can I ask you a question as to the best tip you
I said “sure” .
+" first I want to take some pictures .
so he took some pictures inside the center and he took some
then he asked me +"/.
+" what was the best tip I ever had ?
so I had to think about it awhile .
and then I remembered two friends that I bowl with a_lot always
when I'm bowling bad or I am not throwing good shots is to slow my
which was the best tip I ever had .
so I always remember to slow my feet down when I bowling .
other than that that was it .
after I told him that tip .
then maybe about few weeks later the magazine was published .
and lo_and_behold there is a picture on the front and little story
needless to say a_lot_of the bowling alley family got a hold of the
and made little jokes .
somebody cut out the picture and put it on a trophy .
set it up in the center .
my friends saw it and just laughed
