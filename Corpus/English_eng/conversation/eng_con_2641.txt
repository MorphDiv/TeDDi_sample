right .
here &-uh the clipboard . 6035_7435
that I &~ga okay there . 7875_8935
&-um on the clipboard is what I came up with &-um at thirty thirty in the morning last night . 9375_15215
&-uh because I was sort_of reading through the last chapter again where I was talking about &-um folk music and how to sort_of nuance that view &~an and see &-um rap music . 16315_29475
and then what I realized then was that I want to &-um explain &~s sort_of say this is why they could have come under criticism this is why they were doing sort_of &-uh making a cultural faux pas . 29795_41515
but then at the same time &-um it's absolutely not surprising at all they were accepted by the &-um rap canon thing . 41655_49275
they moved on because they had not only &-um talent and flow but also &-um that &-um not all rap is political or hasta be community building or <has to to> hasta mean anything +/. 49475_63515
right +/.
+, and the &-um and even when it does the importance of political rap becomes the message not the messenger . 63975_71695
which is to say that if they had been black had chosen to &-um as Chuck D puts it you know be black America's CNN that &-um it wouldn't matter whether or not they were middle class it wouldn't matter whether or not they were &-um you know they'd gone to private school what would basically matter is &-uh what was being said and and how they were saying it . 72205_92865
&-um so I wanna split it up and in the first part &-um talk about how sort_of say what I just said . 93245_102705
which is to say that &-um that &-uh rap is equally valued in &~i its flow its &~abil its ability to introduce &-uh familiar sounds in new and interesting ways . 102865_112545
and how it sounds as much as it is for its community building use as social protest sort of &-uh &~yo keeping &~i the a a pulse on on black America . 113255_123655
<and then> &-um and then sort_of say you know rappers are not stuck being cultural emissaries or spokespeople for the black community . 124055_131095
rather it can be about all the other things . 131855_133975
so then &-um what I wanna do is follow with an analysis of the song Sure Shot +/. 134075_141215
+, mhm +/.
+, and through Tricia Rose's definition of flowin(g) and looking elsewhere in terms of what makes rap &-um what makes it good on a purely sonic level explain how this song &-um in specific demonstrates all these things . 141975_154435
and how it you know <when it> when it comes down to it it's sort_of like &-um Wynton Marsalis who's always saying you know you can argue with me for years about the what the music means but but then critics will sort_of slam him and he'll say well let's play . 154615_169095
let's leave it up to the music to decide . 169725_170845
and then &-um so taking that methodology &-um taking analysis of Sure Shot and showing how that is useful as opposed to something that wasn't . 171565_183325
&-um and then after that explain how &-um that had they chosen to be +//. 184105_192665
and and take a deeper look at black messengers . 192925_196405
which is to say the &-um through a short biography of Chuck D and to &-um and looking at his lyrics say &-um here is authentic political black rap . 196655_208515
and here is &-um <you know> you know authentic being in quotes and &-um that even when it is strictly culturally meaningful that &-uh it &-um that the the important part there is what the text rather than the speaker of the text . 209065_229185
+, mhm +/.
+, does that seem useful ? 229545_231885
is this &~s &-uh chapter two ? 233145_235045
three . 235365_235385
chapter three . 235745_236145
so what you're doing is you're &~expandi so chapter two is about the definition of &-uh of folk and authenticity +/. 237185_243465
right +/. 243925_244045
+, and then chapter three is is &-uh on how the Beastie Boys manage to make authentic style music &-um despite what seem like their external inauthenticities . 244345_259125
right .
&~th chapter two sort_of sets up &-um the how rap sort_of has fit into the heavily guarded folk being in &~quo &~cul in quotes &-uh folk culture of of previous black musics . 260085_272845
&-um but then &-um chapter three I wanna sorta spend tearing some of that down or at least complicating it with &-um with the truth which is that the truth being that you know it doesn't matter your background . 273125_285025
you don't even necessarily need to &-um be from the street to &-uh to be accepted and understood . 285205_292945
that yes skin color definitely does matter +/. 293505_295545
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ because ⌋ of reasons cited before like from the first +/. 296185_298545
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ chapter ⌋ &-uh on minstrel singing and &-uh and white privilege but then but when it comes to it down to it like &~a acceptance has more to do with flow and it has more to do &-um and less to do with the &-uh the &~k social background of the +/. 298515_316135
+, mhm +/.
+, of the rapper . 316495_316795
does that make sense ? 317375_319095
yeah it makes sense I guess one &-uh nuance I would argue for would be I worry when you use the term acceptance by the rap community if it kind of &-uh makes the rap community into kind_of a homogeneous +/. 320515_337315
uhuh +/.
+, thing that renders like judgments that are like singular judgments when in fact the so+called rap community like any so+called community probably has divided voices just like I'm I'm sure when &-um Two Live Crew came out +/. 338025_353525
+, right +/.
+, in the eighties there were some rappers who said this is junk . 354305_361825
<this is> &-uh this is you know good time music and it's misogynistic and therefore I won't defend it . 362145_369245
and then there were probably others who said we must defend it because those who want to condemn Two Live Crew also wanna condemn Public Enemy or whatever . 369565_381685
+, right +/.
+, and so I think that this is something that I'm that I always wanna push for I'm speaking like I'm writing a book or something &=laughs:multiple every word that &-uh +... 382345_396405
I dislike the idea of the rap community as like rendering singular judgments like with one voice . 397905_404845
so how do I measure ⌈ how do I measure that ⌉ ? 405165_406945
⌊ well I think there are ⌋ multiple voices (be)cause I think like for example I mean I think of like Nelson George his book The Death of Rhythm and Blues +/. 406945_413645
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ for ⌋ example . 413865_414305
which is not about rap it's prerap it's about R and B but it's about R and B breaking down in a way that rap does too in a sense of turning it into crossover . 416225_424625
and he's lamenting it becoming crossover and he says it gets watered down and diluted of its cultural specificity in_order_to become more commercial for example Michael Jackson Thriller . 425255_434135
and he says that's too bad . 435415_436375
because he longs for Teddy Pendergrass . 436615_438175
and and soul &~i &~w and so forth . 439195_441155
and &-um and yet I'm sure you would find people in the R and B community who thought that &-uh Michael Jackson was cool . 441915_448095
because it was rock it was everything a little bit of everything and that he didn't limit himself to merely black styles of soul or whatever . 448605_456445
and I bet that in the case of the Beastie Boys or some other crossover success like Will Smith for example or Doctor_Dre that there are some voices in the rap community that thought it was good and there's some that thought it was bad . 456945_470185
and I dislike the idea of it being one mind (be)cause it's not that's a <that's a> that's a reification you know what I mean ? 470325_476385
that's an invention there is no such +//. 476305_478245
you can't put your microphone up to the rap community . 478645_480905
you get different voices . 481505_482305
and &~th &-uh that comes out <in the> in the Tricia Rose Black Noise book to some extent you know she's talking to the the female rappers are they feminists ? 482925_490445
well they're like no we're not feminists but &~w you know we &~stan we stick up for women though . 490865_494405
and then she says well what do you think about other those male rappers who talk about bitches and hoes all the time do you find that offensive ? 495045_500665
and they're like well yeah sometimes it is . 500765_502305
because it it reinforces you know bad behavior . 502405_505665
so how do I fix that ? 506585_508045
because I I feel as though what I wanna say is is talk about &-um I mean certainly that there is a sort_of level of &-um I mean they they still continue to sell records they still . 508445_522485

right +/. 593665_593885
+, and he doesn't wanna look like some kinda old sourpuss . 594025_596285
so &~i but I I think that like nonetheless that there's something that I'm grasping at there which is to say that they have stuck around longer than &~oth any other white rappers . 596945_605905
they have sold more records more than any other white rappers they have &-um made more &~f they have more friends who rap and rap they have more rapper friends and they have more producer friends and they they have more ties in the rap recording +/. 606545_620945
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ industry ⌋ than any other white rapper so I understand that's that sort of the the word acceptance is a is dangerous territory because not everyone has liked them and it's not as though they've been &-um that they are liked everywhere they go or that they &~e everybody even thinks they're talented but at the same time there's something there <that I'm> that I'm +/. 621295_641075

yeah .
well I don't wanna sound too much like a &~n a nattering negativist but +... 642935_647775
like when people talk about the so+called jazz community the jazz community renders judgments on things I mean (0.7) &~i it's an abstraction . 651435_664915
you know ? 665935_666135
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and ⌋ the idea of the rap community is an abstraction . 666315_668595
now there might be some things in the rap community that like everybody would agree with . 669435_673995
you know that The Message was cool . 674735_676055
or that &-uh X Y or Z is not cool . 676935_681495
but I would imagine that the whole question of the Beastie Boys because of their background in like party rap as compared to conscious rap that that would be something that would remain controversial . 682455_693475
you know for groups like Underground Resistance for example . 694215_696855
+, uhuh +/.
+, who don't make party rap at all it's all conscious . 697735_699915
they're always droppin(g) science you know ? 700235_701855
they're not foolin(g) around . 702155_703035
and &-um and I just +... 705295_708075
and I I &~w I wonder about that and I also think that it's probably a &~ne a necessary bit of opportunism on the part of some rappers to say that the Beastie Boys are cool because the Beastie Boys have +//. 708775_722375
are so commercially successful . 723135_725395
and that you don't wanna you know you wanna get with a winner . 725995_728035
you know ? 728775_729015
I mean there's a political part to it right ? 729135_730775
you know ? 731255_731515
yeah oh I &~c I completely understand what I <what I'm> what I'm having difficulty with then is to &-um . 731675_739415
well I wanna render it you see my point is I this is something that I made last time and and &-um it's just because I'm so much of a historian . 740535_748595
and the and so the kind of questions I ask are always historical type questions and the historical question isn't like +... 749335_754795
you know why are the Beasties good ? 756295_758815
or how can I prove that they're good ? 758965_760285
I'm not saying that's your point . 760425_761585
but that &~th that would be a point for a critic . 762345_763545
and but the historical question is like what kind of &-uh fields of of &-uh ways of talking about music about crossover about R and B about the relationship between rap and rock the relationship between rap and pop in these whole fields of of you know talking and institutions of these different kinds of music how did the presence of the Beastie Boys illuminate how those fields work ? 763805_790165
in such a way that the point isn't like you know to prove that to say that because they were accepted by the rap community it it must mean that their music has really high quality flow and but rather like how does the rap community constitute itself ? 791205_808025
but I'm asking questions for like &~f kind of for a later draft maybe . 808125_811305
so I don't wanna sound discouraging I think you should write this . 811905_815085

and I I don't even know if I have the chapter around . 1173825_1175485
but the point is is I think that that &-um the idea of &-uh &~a any rap community having contradictory and multiple voices is is one that I want to &~inclu include and one that I wanna sort_of that's another base I wanna cover or a a hole that I would like to plug <with a> with a few paragraphs +/. 1176075_1196755

but you know when you turn on MTV and see all these groups that sell millions of records who are musically nondistinguished like Jennifer Lopez you realize it's not about the music it's about image it's about you know other cultural codes . 1404185_1423025

right but Shania Twain the codes are inextricable from her music I think . 1673105_1677385
I mean you listen to &~th to to her albums and it <it's not> &-um it's not very deeply entrenched . 1677805_1683265
you see what I'm saying ? 1683645_1684005
you don't hafta dig very deep to to &-um you know &~a and &~s and so when that's in the lyrics <you can't> you can't just say that like well the music's completely different from her message because the two are ⌈ one in the same aren't they ⌉ ? 1684025_1696465
⌊ well the message is a ⌋ lot of image . 1696465_1697705

Shania's Twain songs ? 1707985_1708925
yeah . 1709345_1709665
&=sigh what if ? 1710085_1713205
I'm not following . 1713705_1714805
well I think my point is that &=laughs see I went to this concert on Friday night of Myra Melford who's a pianist who in my opinion is a very distinguished pianist there were forty people there . 1715105_1728385
she's probably forty years old has put out maybe four records . 1728785_1731565
&-um she has played with masters you know Roscoe Mitchell and and Henry Threadgill and all these masters of jazz music . 1732575_1740455
but jazz music of_course is a minority music . 1740915_1742835
it makes four percent of American record sales . 1743315_1745395
so with the exception of Wynton Marsalis and Cassandra Wilson &-uh jazz musicians sell records in the thousands of copies . 1746275_1753095
so the whole idea of commercial success in that kind of music is is a &-uh very vexed thing when you compare it to the behemoth of of a genre people sells records in the millions like pop . 1753935_1767135
so what that &~tell I so I come in with the basic idea that music that sells lots_of records even for many many years is in no way related to the quality of the music . 1767655_1776635
because I think there are a_lot_of bands that can keep up putting out schlock for <years and> years and years because they have audiences that don't demand very much from them and use it as a nostalgia act or for sex symbols or whatever . 1777385_1789305
and I think the case can be made that the Beastie Boys have more interesting music than a_lot_of schlock acts . 1789845_1795165
but the fact that they're successful like selling records in the millions whereas Myra Melford sells records in the thousands the fact that they're commercially successful has no relationship to their quality . 1795505_1804965
&=laughs you sound so much like Adorno sometimes . 1806135_1808015
&=laughs:S2 just in terms of of of your cynicism about the pop machine . 1808495_1813355
you know and and and not being related to quality and and I &-um one of the things that that I am and I &~s this is a perhaps a discussion for another time but I sort_of feel like &-um I want to agree with that for the most part but I also know that &-um I spent a_lot_of time sort_of being &-um &~a cantankerous in in terms of not wanting to like anything that was pushed on me . 1813695_1843355

(be)cause that's you know most +//. 1874445_1875405
&~it it's only rarely that people make really interesting stuff (be)cause that's just how culture works you know ? 1875805_1881125
that's how art works in all genres . 1881265_1882405
and so the fact that the Rolling Stones can go on tour and sell out all these stadiums and put out a record that has no distinguished songs on it and that has made no innovation and and nothing it it seems clear that they're just like you know it's just the cash register . 1882945_1899865
and who won't play in Thailand because well Thailand had a depression and people can't afford the tickets . 1900325_1905365
and then they can't make any money there (be)cause they'd hafta sell tickets for only two dollars . 1906145_1908825
and what's the point of going to Thailand if you can only sell two dollars where in New York you can sell tickets for seventy five dollars to see these codgers play . 1909145_1916265
and it makes me &~r realize that there is no real relationship between the amount of money somebody makes over decades and the quality of the music . 1916745_1923585
and also going to see you know jazz veterans or classical music veterans &-um who play for an audience of a hundred and who sell records in the thousands and have been doing it for decades you &~kn it makes you know it just makes me keep in mind that album sales you know like ticket sales for movies is not in my opinion something that tells you that something's high musical quality . 1924345_1946685
it's something that says that it's highly popular . 1946905_1948345
