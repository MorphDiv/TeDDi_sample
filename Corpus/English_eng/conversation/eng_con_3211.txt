It's because you did it upwards→ 111485_112595
Oh, you did→ 112595_113526
&=approaches_the_group→ 113940_114641
Were we supposed to do the graph upwards↗ 114641_116580
Or to→ 116580_117410
Or, or or crookayed like this↗ 117410_118741
Whatever→ 118741_119656
Or horizontally↗ 119656_119855
Doesn't matter↗ 119855_121615
cause like like when we look at our graphs 121615_124185
Did you have the same, 126618_129428
No, Yes, actually→ 132696_135880

Yeah→ 159048_159713
Right↗ 159713_159958
Here the numbers are closer together so it looks steeper→ 159958_164225
Other than that are they the same graph↗ 164225_165690
No, also here in the x@l axis→ 165690_168748
xxx→ 168748_169191
I went by twos→ 169191_170491
This is the x@l axis→ 170491_171326
