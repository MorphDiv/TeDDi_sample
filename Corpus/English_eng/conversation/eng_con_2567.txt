&-um in looking at the Pumpkinseeds and so on please do include some of the young of the year that we've got with their tiny little scales (be)cause we want as large a size range as possible . 3565225_3577085
okay ? 3577365_3578645
who took my waders ?
how are you doing ? 3582145_3588585

no +/.
+, Pumpkinseed and I'm like no . 3602785_3605245
&=laughs it's a Rock Bass okay .
&=laughs (0.5) go and get a little one to do . 3605245_3607105
what ?
yes +/.
+, go and get a little one to do . 3608105_3609285
what're +//.
they +//.
&~a there are some star shaped things .
okay the star shaped thing +//. 3609625_3614605
&-um a_lot_of you are getting star shaped objects on top of your scales . 3615405_3620185
that'll sort_of look like octopuses . 3621445_3622885
okay octopi . 3623765_3624605
these are in fact &-um melanophores which are the source of pigment and it means you've got a little bit of skin on top and that's the &~mal melanophore in the skin . 3624855_3634155
if someone would like to volunteer a skin sample we could take a piece from one of you and see the melanophores in your skin and they'd look similar . 3634615_3642075
I'm not ⌊ sure if you wanna ⌋ +/. 3642155_3642695
⌈ does it hurt ⌉ ?

I'll do it .
⌈ yes &-um ⌉ the thing is well you don't know where I want to take it from . 3645095_3648555
&-um . 3648715_3649735
where you gonna take it from ?
&~o one of the things to one of the things is that &-uh these will respond to hormone levels and things such as that and as a result they can change in shape they can get bigger and and larger so that the fish gets darker and also smaller so it gets lighter so it's the change in the melanophore size which is one of the ways that the fish change color . 3651505_3673565
the fish we saw today were way darker than anything we've seen in a long time and that's (be)cause the melanophores have been more expanded and perhaps that's why you're picking them up so much (be)cause I haven't seen as many &~mela melanophores as this on scales . 3674185_3686485
as always you're ahead of me . 3687045_3688605
okay so that's what the octopi are +... 3689685_3691325
how are you doing ? 3691665_3696185
good I like this . 3697085_3697505

⌈ okay &-um yes you do ⌉ . 3701285_3701905
one thing do try and keep these dry and put a slide on top as_well_as underneath if you're not doing so . 3703025_3708965
keep (th)em wet . 3709985_3711885

are you eating scales ? 3725525_3726705
no .
are we done with <the fish> ? 3727585_3729385
no I haven't seen any of the little ones done . 3730185_3731785
according to this size range there aren't any measurements of the little tiny ones . 3732305_3737805
how much skin do you have to take off ? 3738305_3739605

how much skin do you have to take off ? 3741105_3742225
oh you have to go into the dermis . 3742505_3743825
so you'll bleed . 3743945_3745605
oh . 3745965_3746205
I can do that .

how can you have a zero year+old ?
a one year+old . 3822895_3824715
it's in its first year +... 3824815_3826635
okay we've got one two three four and five for the Pumpkinseed but the Rock Bass are really struggling . 3827815_3836075
I got a I got a four year+old hundred and fifteen millimeters . 3837095_3841735
you got a four year+old ?

⌊ I think we should clear that up ⌋ .
clear what up ?
how to +//.
if it's got two ranges if it's two years old or if it's in its third year whatever you wanna call it .
okay . 3873675_3873875
if it's in its first year I'm calling it a one year+old . 3874115_3878095
if it's in its second year I'm calling it a two year+old . 3878215_3881275

it's I'm calling it one year old . 3884755_3886335
&-um one of the reasons to do that is that when you have to take logarithms you can take a logarithm . 3886735_3894175
and so &~the one convention <is to> &~d is to call an &~a a fish in its first year one year old . 3894275_3901355
however some people will prefer to use the human business and &-um call them in a zero year old . 3901475_3909635
okay ? 3910015_3910955
but we'll use them as one year old if they're in their first year . 3911495_3915555

no I did it .
it doesn't mean I recall everything .
<okay so I'm not going to work particularly well> +...
mhm (0.14) .
okay where are we at +..?
can we &-uh begin to have a look at these &-uh data then if we could gather round the screen here +... 4244115_4250855
oh hey I'm right by the screen &=laughs .
oh that wasn't very good (0.10) for reasons I don't understand aw damn +... 4252315_4272095
ahhah got it .
(0.5) no this is really weird .
(0.6) okay . 4289125_4289985
the &-uh first thing is to look at the the data for the the minnow for the minnow . 4291185_4299265
now from the earlier data we've got this year &=pause_while_going_through_slides we've got a nice clear separation of our couple of sized classes of minnows . 4300985_4314425
okay ? 4315105_4315765
and this is presumably the young of the year that have just been born this year and these are the older ones and you can see the &~do growth depensation@n that I was talking about this morning . 4315945_4325425
&-um the second one only looks at the smaller minnows and then this is today's data . 4326585_4332365
&-um it's horrible actually but I believe it . 4332965_4338145
&-um it it's sort_of a little surprising because if you look at it it looks as if &-um there's just one group of fishes which frankly I am very skeptical about . 4338605_4348545
I think what you've actually got is a group of fish here and perhaps a second group of fish here . 4348925_4354525
mhm +/.
+, and given if you go all the way up here that these are the older fishes these two groups of fish down here &-um are going to be probably two separate spawnings +... 4356665_4370525
probably two separate spawnings . 4372345_4373585
I'm not entirely certain . 4373805_4374925
anyway I've taken the average of these fish here and if you look at it on a a graph you can see a &~fa an effect which is quite common . 4375405_4385565
this is probably the new spawning and I haven't yet had a chance to put the numbers in but I think they're about thirty five . 4386785_4395905
&-um but you see this this kind of effect where with time the growth rate gets lower . 4397445_4402645
it's very fast to begin with and then it tails off . 4402895_4405835
is that case selection ?
or .
pardon ? 4406195_4407635
is that case selection ? 4407915_4408735
or . 4409295_4409615
no no this is individual growth rates not population growth rates okay ? 4409615_4413695
&-um &~a and what it's saying is that when the babies started off little they grew fast and then tailed off . 4413855_4421035
how many of you &-um &~di have done any babysitting in the last two decades ? 4421235_4424895
oh yeah . 4425635_4426055
yeah okay . 4426495_4427175
<how fast do> &~m how fast do babies grow ? 4427435_4429675
ridiculously fast .
ridiculously fast they double their weight in ? 4431385_4434005
a year ?
well I can't actually remember (be)cause it's a long time since I've had things that size but anyway &-um +/. 4435025_4441245
things ?
+, &~tha &~the &~is &~sh babies at that age are vegetables I tell you . 4442045_4446045
so the the the thing is though that animals that are very very young grow very very fast . 4446465_4451345
if you think about it &-um if &-uh you have a baby that say has a birth weight of four kilograms +... 4451525_4459065
yeah +... 4460895_4461155
alright so it was a hard birth hard labor &=laughs:multiple alright do three kilograms okay ladies three kilograms . 4463155_4469455
thank you . 4469855_4470295
&-um three kilograms and it doubles in weight so you only have to add three kilograms don't you ? 4470835_4475515
but if you add another three kilograms it goes from six to nine kilograms and the growth rate is obviously a_lot lower instead of doubling it's only gone up fifty percent . 4475995_4484335
so one of the things as you get <bigger and> bigger and bigger it takes <more and> more and more to grow at the same rate . 4484645_4490425
oh good heavens . 4491765_4492565
&-um so what you're seeing here is an effect that although the the the as it gets as they get larger it's simply harder to <add on> add on material but this is very very typical . 4493205_4501565
fish typically grow fast when they're young and also they typically grow fast at the beginnings of seasons . 4502585_4508505
Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds for example will put up &~th on their annual growth often in ten to two &-uh ten days two weeks . 4509095_4516875
trout will put on their annual growth in just a few weeks in the spring . 4517955_4522275
then that's it for the year . 4523175_4524215
hm +/.
+, it's when the food is available . 4525675_4526895
so this kind of effect <is &-uh> is &-uh is is quite common with the minnows . 4527515_4531575
and if you took the slope of that which wouldn't really be worthwhile with that number of points you could get the growth rate . 4531845_4537325
okay . 4538865_4538925
so that's +//. 4539565_4540005
oh there it is . 4540205_4540725
that's one set of +//. 4540905_4541725
do you want to change it ? 4542145_4542965
alright .
now the other &-um thing that we &-uh &-um need to look at the growth is I've put the Pumpkinseed data up here . 4543085_4554805
and you can see the same kind of thing the young have grown &-um very rapidly and then the &-uh weight is tailing off and so on . 4555605_4563325
it hasn't reached a maximum . 4563725_4564925
the reason we wanted to get as large a size range as possible is to try and get &-um all the way up to the maximum size of the fish because when we look at the &-um growth of fish if you look in your handout one of the popular models could I just squidge@n$v by here ? 4565445_4584965
is this Von Bertalanffy equation . 4585485_4587165
(0.12) could you turn the lights off over there ? 4599315_4601215
and this simply looks at the size of the fish where it looks at the length at some time and this is equal to I'm gonna move in a little while but &-uh L max +//. 4601795_4613135
yeah I always stand in the way and then &-uh you_know watch the panic it's &-uh oh sorry . 4613595_4616975
&-um okay first of all we know that this is the maximum size that it can reach this L max . 4617555_4622895
&-uh but it hasn't reached that size yet it's discounted with time and this is a +//. 4624485_4629845
so you multiply it one minus some exponential function for the growth rate and the time . 4630205_4636565
and this is the &-uh basic form of what's called the Von Bertalanffy growth equation it's probably the most common equation that is used for describing the size of a fish with time . 4637565_4648525
(be)cause if you plot the length against time you get one of these curves <such as> &-uh such as here . 4649365_4654825
&-um L max is the maximum size it's the asymptotic growth . 4655865_4659125
and with modern computers you could fit a curve to those data so that you could actually describe the curve and &-um get the maximum size and the maximum size is important as you might expect in managing many fisheries . 4659745_4673485
&-um . 4674185_4674505
<how do> &~y how do you determine maximum size xxx . 4675305_4677105
the maximum +//. 4677345_4677745
well <this is> this is the the point &-um gimme &~wh &~wh &~y &-um the thing is maximum size is &~i is rather a nebulous thing and it's rather difficult to determine . 4678205_4689045
yet in many of the models you're talking about approaching say &~am some asymptote . 4689285_4695065
so you you know where is the asymptote ? 4695625_4698305
it's important in defining these models to know where the asymptote is for the the growth models that are used for &~ou for for &~ou for &~p used throughout fisheries . 4698635_4707935
now if the size range you have that is small you get something like this where this is pretty much a straight sort of line isn't it ? 4708435_4715535
mhm +/.
+, and if you did a a &~susti statistics on that what you'd probably find was that you'd wind up with a straight line going through those data instead of some nice curve that would look like that . 4716825_4729245
this straight line is never gonna reach an asymptote is it ? 4729845_4733745
it's just gonna keep going on and on . 4733905_4735525
this is a very very common problem with the age of oh the age and growth of fishes . 4736105_4743225
and so a variety of devices described in your course pack are used to try and clean that up and one of these is called the &~fo the &-um Ford Walford method and in the Ford Walford method you plot &=pause_while_changing_overhead_transparencies &-um the length at age T the length at some age T against the &~la age at length T plus one . 4744545_4774525
now if you reach an asymptote so that the elder fish isn't growing any more it never gets any bigger then you know that the &~a the length at T plus one is equal to exactly the same the length at age T isn't it ? 4776425_4790025
you with me ? 4790785_4791065
if you go an asymptote out here and the thing's reached some maximum age then the length may be a hundred and forty millimeters in a ten year Pumpkinseed yes ten year Pumpkinseed and the same length in an eleven year Pumpkinseed so that as &~y they get <older and> older and older you get a line of equality where the length of an age is exactly the same as it is a year older . 4791265_4814705
for example my height has been roughly five foot ten now for many many many years . 4815265_4821925
it's still half an inch taller than Timothy . 4822665_4825165
&=laughs:multiple .
it's not what he would xxx .
he's not done yet though .
he may not be done yet . 4827925_4830685
<heh heh> heh heh .
okay . 4832005_4832405
so if you plot the age at &~so the length at some age against the length at age T plus one what happens ? 4833145_4840145
well the smaller fish is gonna start off +//. 4840305_4842425
the younger fish is gonna start off smaller than the older fish isn't it ? 4843025_4846405
so that &-um you're gonna find some sort of number &-um out here where this is going &~t if &~th you start off here at zero and this is one then you finish up with something like this and as you go along the fish &-uh the the lengths eventually cross this line . 4846705_4864685
at that point you have the L Max . 4865265_4868185
and this is a graphical &~metho method for finding it . 4869705_4872605
now this is set up on the next page and there's only one word to describe your data +... 4873245_4878465
rubbish ? 4880365_4882325
&=laughs:multiple .
no look what's happened . 4883045_4885205
here if you follow this line along here it would have been beautiful it would have crossed the axis at about a hundred and twenty millimeters but that those that linear stuff down here you know this regular growth rate here &-um it's not reaching an asymptote is it ? 4886275_4903095
and what you've found is that it doesn't actually cross the line . 4903535_4907635
this is extremely common this is very common indeed . 4908915_4912295
&-um naturally it's entirely possible that &-um some of the data made have made a little bit of a mistake you know in the ages and so on &-um +/. 4912785_4922705
<not our data> +/.
+, yeah that could have happened you know for example this might be a four year+old or something like that but &-uh never mind this is &~the these are the data we have . 4923665_4932265
&-um this this too is quite common but at least you see the principle you can in fact find the point at which it crosses this line of equality and that gives you the maximum size . 4932825_4942005
will someone look up Scott and Crossman and see what maximum size you'd expect <of a> &~Blueg of a Pumpkinseed ? 4942425_4948065
who wants the bible ? 4950725_4951545
I got it .
twelve inches .
&~twe what's that in ? 4952205_4956225
come on now . 4956305_4956905
we don't use inches here . 4957345_4958485
thirty centimeters . 4961385_4962325
yeah and the units we're using are millimeters . 4963025_4965225
three hundred . 4965685_4966065
&=laughs .
we're talking about the certified record not the ones you catch regularly okay +..? 4969645_4974065
it is thirty millimeters thirty point four eight centimeters to a foot . 4974825_4981665
where would you find it ? 4985325_4986325
xxx .
no I don't think you'd you'd find one . 4988265_4989945
see how it compares ? 4990285_4992345
this is an +//. 4993145_4993685
illustrates yet another point that it's always a good idea to crosscheck your data and see whether it makes sense . 4994185_5000345
now I know if you find a thirty pound bass that it really is thirty pounds . 5000785_5005845
okay mm right ? 5006805_5007645
&-um but it's a good idea to crosscheck because you might in fact find you've got a Tarpon instead . 5008025_5013245
you've got a maximum size for these ? 5015845_5017165
xxx .
there you go yes some &-uh age eight years old and a Michigan total length a hundred and ninety eight at eight years old I wonder what happens if we put those numbers in ? 5017905_5028925
how about Bluegill ? 5030025_5030545
look up Bluegill . 5030645_5031225
yes sir . 5031745_5032085
please . 5032365_5032605
what are you looking at there ? 5032765_5033685
Pumpkinseed doesn't ⌈ get as big as ⌉ +/.
⌊ whoops ⌋ +/.
+, Bluegill .
but I betcha Bluegill xxx . 5035065_5037505
what was the age a hundred and ninety eight ? 5037525_5038845
mhm .
age was eight . 5039045_5040445
ninety eight . 5040905_5041525
yeah a hundred and ninety eight . 5041885_5043005
well that doesn't help either does it +..? 5044825_5046365
but but &-uh . 5048825_5050985
actually I've just realized I've got these axes back to front haven't I ? 5052025_5054585
you put that on age six does it matter ? 5054625_5056525
oh yes it did matter didn't it +..? 5056905_5058925
what was the length ? 5061845_5065025
one ninety eight .
oh no &~s it +//. 5065425_5066465
no we need to <have it> fill in the data otherwise it's not gonna work . 5066565_5069085
anyway there is yet another method to try and do these things and that is it's called the guessing method and this is where your data really begins to look like hell . 5069335_5080155
&-um what you try and do here &-um is to guess the maximum lengths . 5081675_5086655
let's say that we guess &-uh two hundred . 5087315_5089555
whoops wrong thing +... 5090435_5091315
put (th)em up here . 5092875_5095195
suppose it's two hundred . 5095595_5096595
and that gives us a +//. 5098115_5099135
see this line here ? 5099335_5100315
it's a hundred and +//. 5101735_5102715
what the hell has happened here ? 5103275_5104495
&=laughs:multiple .
nine inches . 5106115_5111835
okay and &-uh this gives us this line here for two hundred . 5112455_5116175
and &-uh +... 5117135_5117895
what you try and trying to find a line that's that's reasonably straight and that's working quite well but what happens if we say put in three hundred here +... 5122805_5131165
that's that's that's &-uh see that's a weird line that it doesn't look right at all and if we put in say . 5134725_5139385
what are the green numbers ? 5139485_5140225
&-um they're just the the numbers I'm entering . 5140545_5142605
&=laughs what do they mean ?
these are guesses of the total length these are guesses of the total length and I can't see that can you see that ? 5145025_5152305
no .
the total length ? 5152525_5153985
color .
xxx .
okay it's black that's better . 5154825_5163225
see this line is sort_of curving down . 5163745_5165705
and what what you do is you put +//. 5167245_5168505
what's happening here is you're quite simply putting in an estimate of the maximum length and you're plotting the log of the maximum length minus the actual length against the age . 5168525_5177945
an estimate of the maximum length at a certain age or just like ⌈ overall ⌉ ? 5178105_5180765
⌊ just a maximum ⌋ of the &~t an estimate of the maximum length . 5180765_5183545
just a maximum of the &-uh &~maximu &-uh &-uh of the length . 5184105_5186025
and if you're close you get straight lines . 5186465_5189065
if you're &~f way out you get curves . 5189625_5191845
and what you now do is you put in numbers here until you get the straightest possible looking line . 5192385_5197205
and that gives you the maximum length and the slope will give you the growth rate . 5197645_5200965
these are the kinds of things that people do &-um this is the kind of thing that fisheries wars are based on okay ? 5201905_5209085
&-um and this is these are methods to try and deal with some realities of the data to try and find out maximum lengths now a hundred and ninety eight was pretty close to two hundred and you see this is quite a nice straight line . 5209865_5221845
the others are curved or wander around on all over the place . 5222505_5225425
with those with &~no &~ge with an estimate of the maximum length and two hundred millimeters is pretty good is pretty good even for our data you can then plug that in to the &-um Von Bertalanffy equation and you can get the slope of this line and that will give you the value of K the growth rate and you get your your &-uh growth equation . 5226075_5247255
&-uh sorry &~e this is &-um the K in here . 5248545_5254325
all we're trying to do is take real world data and fit the models to it such that we can make predictions about growth rate but more important we can begin to put them into the kinds of models that are used for managing fisheries so that you can predict fecundity survivorship and &-uh elements such as that . 5255365_5276545
but what I want to show you really as much as anything else is that &-um there's an awful lot of guesswork involved and we can start off with nice hard numbers the things we measured right ? 5277585_5291805
easy no doubt and everybody knew the ages really accurately right ? 5291985_5296065
no question in reading the scales dead easy . 5296485_5299145
Matt you look skeptical . 5299385_5300825
okay . 5301665_5301805
the data are fairly good the data are fairly hard but management management decisions are often made on remarkably incomplete data . 5302105_5312945
okay remarkably incomplete data . 5313225_5316385
and the kinds of processes that we've gone through with &-uh with this now with that incomplete data you still have to make decisions . 5317045_5325565
compared to management compared to building policy science is remarkably easy +... 5327845_5334245
science is &~dea &~de is &~dea dealing with hard numbers in many respects &-um yeah sure there's always uncertainty and so on . 5336945_5342165
but when you're making management decisions and you're sending people to war who's seen Private Ryan ? 5342645_5346885
yeah &-um and those kinds of things you have incredibly uncertain information <to base> &~ba to base your predictions on to base your decisions . 5348855_5357615
now that uncertainty does two things for you . 5358495_5361335
first of all it should keep you humble . 5361995_5363195
but the second thing is it leaves plenty of wiggle room for interests who say don't want to make a change they don't want to conserve organisms and that kind of thing . 5364915_5373095
the real world then of where you apply the data which +//. 5373515_5376755
the hard won data but the data that was relatively easy to get okay ? 5377045_5381705
the real world of where you apply that is extremely challenging . 5381805_5386125
and yet it's absolutely vital as scientists if you want to move into the policy kinds of areas or to have an impact in those kinds of areas that you understand how much you can predict and where the risks are and ideally you try and give the policy people and these kinds of things scenarios . 5387375_5407135
say okay this is my best guess . 5408335_5410815
if I'm wrong by this much these are the consequences . 5411535_5414455
if I'm wrong by this much these are the consequences . 5414935_5418015
okay ? 5420335_5420375
so +... 5420975_5421735
having gone through this in &-uh &~the these these procedures here it's gonna be the same for doctors you never have complete knowledge . 5423295_5430295
you have to decide whether to treat someone with a potentially lethal drug with incomplete data +... 5430835_5437075
hm hm .
okay . 5439595_5441955
so . 5443415_5443635
I wanted to illustrate the process and what you can do with the data but I also wanted to show you the limitations . 5444015_5449495
and I wanted to give you +//. 5450635_5451635
to leave you today and we're gonna finish right now with I hope a_lot more respect for the problems that the manager hasta face and the problems that the person who is trying to design policies for a better world hasta face . 5451995_5466495

wait two species we've never seen before ? 5662365_5663765
yes . 5664025_5664545
and how many that we have seen before do we have to key any of those out ? 5664845_5667025
you won't have to key out any of those but you will undoubtedly see ones that you have seen before cropping up in plates . 5667145_5673305
