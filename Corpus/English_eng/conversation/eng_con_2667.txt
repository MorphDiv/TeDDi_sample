xxx I had more useful &-um comments when each of you only did two so if you would like to just do two very good evaluations today that's actually more useful to me and to the people giving the talks than four <yes yes> yes yes evaluations okay so &-um if you could do that . 2385_20905
&-um just a reminder there're a_couple_of people last week who forgot to give me their detailed outline and &-uh references &-um Serena and Reshma if if <you need> you need to get those to me by next week at the latest . 22165_35965

okay &-uh I am &-uh Paul Land if you don't know me I'm doing my &-uh presentation on Mad Cow Disease and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies . 321495_335395
okay &-uh what really is Mad Cow Disease ? 335955_338995
<it's just> &-uh it's just the easier name for the disease called Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy which means &-um encephalopathy means just a bad thing in your brain spongiform means your brain will look like a sponge and then bovine happens in cattle . 339115_353395
&-uh it's just one of many diseases that are called &-um TSEs or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies which are just &-uh you_know your brain is just like a sponge and it's transmitted from species to species sometimes or just from &-uh animal to animal . 353945_367725
&-um many other well known &-uh TSEs are scrapie in sheep and &-uh Creutzfeld_Jakob disease which affects us humans . 368585_377165
&-uh what is a TSE &-um what happens it it's a &-uh spongy degeneration of the brain which means your brain will look like a sponge which means there's gonna be holes in your brain . 379425_389985
which is kind_of bad because you don't want holes in your brain so &-um this will cause &-uh severe then eventual fatal &-uh neurological damage which you'll just die &-uh it doesn't last too long &-um what causes this is something called a prion which is a protein which I will get into later &-uh xxx means just it's a bad way to die . 390455_410695
it's quick it's painful and you're gonna die no matter what . 410915_414075
&=laughs okay &-uh now we get into the history &-um of &-uh BSE and &-uh Creutzfeld_Jakob disease . 416155_421555
&-um in nineteen eighty six that's when it was first pretty much found in &-uh a nice amount of numbers in &-uh in the UK . 422135_428395
and the UK government pretty much didn't acknowledge it didn't say it was gonna be important didn't say humans were gonna be affected by it . 429135_436315
&-um until two years later they realized that the &-uh the cows were getting this by eating a &-uh protein slush which contained either sheep like brains and spinal cords which contained the disease the TSE scrapie from sheep then later on contained +//. 437305_453305
it was like cannibalism . 453965_454785
they contained &~co you know cow brains spinal cords so they were just they were cannibals giving it from &-uh cow to cow . 454945_460065
&-um from nineteen eighty eight to ninety three &-uh the disease increased in cows every year and then in ninety two was it was &-uh one of the first bad signs because &-um cheetahs and pumas &-uh cats in zoos started getting the TSE in cats because of eating &-uh BSE food . 460745_480425
this was bad (be)cause <now it> crossed the species barrier twice went from sheep to cows and now cows to cats . 481145_486805
and then what's even worse in ninety four a a human Victoria Rimmer &-uh was claimed to have been dying of a new kind of Creutzfeld_Jakob Disease called Variant Creutzfeld_Jakob Disease and it was thought she got this by eating &-um &-uh cattle that was infected with BSE . 488145_504925
so now it's affecting humans not just cows . 505545_507845
and then &-uh because of this and &-um it started infecting more people . 508845_514265
the UK just started slaughtering all their cattle so their cattle numbers decreased . 514705_517945
they couldn't send this out across the world . 518445_519965
so pretty much that's one of the main reasons that the BSE decreased (be)cause they would just kill any cow that may have had it so if some cow is had it at some farm they killed all the cows in that farm . 521065_530665
so because of that here's the graph of &-um how it increased at first and now it's it's there's almost none now . 530745_537185
it's a very small amount &~con considered there was over two thousand some years you know &-um over sorry over forty thousand some years &-uh like eight years ago . 537275_545755
so now it's vastly decreased . 545915_548075
&-uh the link between &-uh BSE and Variant Creutzfeld_Jakob Disease this is important because this means the BSE can convert over to humans and affect us . 549175_559615
&-uh they first realized this because they both happened out_of nowhere and certainly increased out_of nowhere in the same place in the same time in the UK in the &-uh eighties and then nineties . 560145_569785
then there're three other features which really kind_of show that these are similar it's &-uh just the pathological features in monkeys when they have either disease are similar they have similar molecular markers or when they're transmitted in rats both diseases their characteristics of transmission are identical . 570345_586785
so the disease shows the same thing . 586945_588785
&-uh okay now for the rest of my speech I'm pretty much gonna talk about how it's gonna affect us with Variant Creutzfeld_Jakob Disease and then what a prion is and what a prion can do in our body . 591105_601065
&-um the main difference between the regular Creutzfeld_Jakob Disease and Variant is that Variant is linked to exposure meaning you eat a_lot_of beef or use a_lot_of bovine product +//. 601345_612845
I think it's gelatin's a product . 613065_614265
&-uh it's involved in some medications . 614385_615845
look in the ingredients . 616165_616725
you can see bovine products in there . 616945_619405
and then the other just simple difference is Variant . 619665_622845
&-uh you're a little younger thirty years old instead of sixty five or in Variant you live a little longer two years instead of five months . 623205_629525
really you're not living long anyways . 630265_631785
and it's not fun to live with . 631865_632765
so it doesn't really matter . 632905_633745
&=laughs and then patients with Variant also have some psychiatric symptoms because it's affecting their brain they have plaques in their brain so they can become &-uh they act schizophrenic they act different then they used to act or they start seeing hallucinations . 634745_648125
okay there are three types of Variant which are the same three types of the other Creutzfeld_Jakob disease they are &-um sporadic familial and iatrogenic . 648765_661825
sporadic is the kind that that we pretty much get from eating the beef they don't know what the cause is but it's pretty much it's just exposure .
this is ninety percent of the cases . 666025_667665
even though it's a large amount that's still only one per million humans so it's very low amount . 668445_672725
and the other two familial and the iatrogenic are very small familials just you get a gene mutation you can happen to get this disease . 673325_679585
or iatrogenic is what has been coming up more recently about how you might get a blood &~transvu transfusion and you could somehow get the disease so now it's a ban on I think anyone from the UK really can't give blood across the world . 680265_692705
&=laughs:multiple in case we don't want to get that okay . 693985_695745
&-uh diagnosis well first of all the disease can lay dormant in your body for many years like over ten years so you could have it now you have no idea . 696625_704045
so who knows but when you really start seeing the symptoms you're just wasting away eventually you can't talk you can't move you can't think you're just laying down waiting to die . 704545_713605
so at the end you're just waiting to die . 714245_715585
&-um it's also been called Alzheimer's on fast forward because they get +//. 716185_720425
I'll talk <about it> later these similar plaques in their brains they get the &~s the same kind of thing they lose memory they don't they can't do as many functions but it happens considerably faster like in a few you know weeks and months span . 720805_731705
&-uh okay how do the TSEs go from animal to animal and species to species ? 734315_738075
&-uh they really don't know . 738715_739615
the cause or of how it goes in their body and moves they don't really know . 739995_743735
they think it's exposure like I said before the cows ate a protein sludge which had scrapie and they ate the protein sludge <which had> &-uh which had BSE and then we ate cattle that had BSE so pretty much you eat enough of it and if they have the prions in there there's a chance you can get the disease . 744395_759095
okay here's prions this was a pretty hot topic when it was first discovered because many scientists didn't agree with it . 761115_766675
&-um it was discovered by Stanley Prusiner and he called it a proteinaceous &-uh infectious particle which's just a protein that infects things . 767475_776315
and he &~c it's a naked protein (be)cause it contains no nucleic acid which are no DNA no RNA and this was odd because there'd never been &~a a disease in the past which didn't contain a nucleic acid . 776495_786735
because you need nucleic acids to make the disease grow like from cell to cell in your body . 787445_790725
so because of this this was of_course laughed at first by the science community they didn't agree with him &-um of_course scientists can be wrong they once thought the Earth was flat and of_course it isn't flat . 791585_801945
&-um so xxx information was obtained which I'll explain in a second &-uh the prion theory was accepted and Prusiner later like like thirteen years later he discovered it he &-uh was something like that he &-uh won the Nobel Prize in &-uh medicine . 802745_816625
&-uh here are the two reasons mainly why the prion theory is accepted now . 817925_821425
it's because &-um nucleic acids are either destroyed or ineffective if you use high temperature low temperature radiation or ultraviolet light . 822075_831435
and when they did this to <the prions> the prions still worked there was no effect on it . 832275_835895
and the other reason is because prions were inactivated <by using> by using a protein xxx chemicals . 836475_841475
so pretty much they showed there was a protein that showed there wasn't any nucleic acid . 842375_846915
so that kind_of proved that it was only a prion there . 847075_849775
but even with this information many scientists still just won't believe it they think we don't have the techniques to find the nucleic acid so they still claim they call it a virion or virino which is protein with a tiny piece of DNA . 850145_862205
so even though they can't see it they won't admit that it's not there . 862505_865025
so who knows maybe they're right . 865445_866465
&-uh here's a diagram of pretty much how the disease transmits from species to species and what happens in our body . 867885_875185
the &-uh the O is the origin which is probably scrapie and then the cows ate this then it went from cow to cow then it went from the cow to the humans &-um then in the lymphocytes the &-uh the prions +//. 875625_887285
I'll explain what <they do> they do some of their work and then they get +//. 888105_889965
go back to the brain by &-uh the nerves and the spleen and they make holes in the brain . 890205_894605
&-uh okay here's what the prion really does &-um the prion protein is really found in all humans we have this protein that's called prion protein or PRPC . 896625_905905
&-uh it's made by chromosome twenty but &-um that really doesn't matter &-um the infectious prion protein is called PRPSC because SC's for scrapie and this is what calls &-uh Variant Creutzfeld_Jakob disease &-um they're &~i they're identical besides in their tertiary confirmation . 906865_922205
&-um pretty much how you get the disease is that the infectious prion protein enters our body and then changes the conformation of the normal prion protein . 923045_929805
&-um yeah this picture it's hard to follow but if you look at the &-uh the green which is PRPC that's our normal and the purple is really the infectious and then you can see all the way over from the purple like &=sighs over there it's like half green and half purple so it's changing I don't know I could only find xxx pictures . 931505_948905
&-um pretty much the difference in their conformation is that normal prion protein is mostly alpha helices and infectious prion protein is mostly &-um or more beta sheets and less alpha helices and what happens that the infectious prion protein binds the normal prion protein and changes conformation of beta sheets . 950965_969765
they don't know how this happens they think they make the infectious prion protein makes a deletion in the regular prion protein it's like some kind of base pair then because of that the alpha helix is more easily turned into a beta sheet . 970255_982095
and they know this stuff's happened because when they're both put <in a> &-um in a test tube the infectious prion protein does change all the normal prion protein into infectious . 982695_990435
&-uh here's a picture of the two you see on the left it's +//. 991515_995215
they estimate it's about forty five percent +//. 995595_997075
this is just general pictures this isn't xxx what it looks like &-um it's mostly alpha helices then on the right infectious there's a_lot more beta sheet that's why the &-uh blue arrows so they don't know why the &~secon the second kind will make the disease but it definitely does make the disease . 997065_1011825
okay what happens in the body &-um well the first one up there definitely &~do it happened in some of the patients . 1012505_1019365
it's the same as in &~al Alzheimer's . 1019705_1021185
the different protein they're just plaques on the brain which will &~cau +//. 1021185_1024685
this happens at the beginning cause you'll lose memory you'll lose function you can't do as many things your your the way you act changes . 1024915_1031975
but then what really kills you what they think happens in lysosomes the infectious prion protein enters the lysosomes then bursts kills the cells goes to another cell bursts kills that it keeps killing cells in your brain which makes holes in your brain . 1032255_1045955
so that is the spongy brain . 1046975_1048475
there's &~a the little holes start little black holes at first then as they accumulate they become bigger and bigger holes so eventually your whole just being torn apart you brain &{l=SIC get &}l=SIC torn apart . 1048475_1057415
&-uh but the good news is is that Variant &~Creutzfel Creutzfeld_Jakob disease hasn't really entered the United States . 1058415_1065475
&-uh there aren't really any official documents that say it has I looked online a_lot_of people claim that some family members died of it by eating you know beef but there's no official document saying it's really entered the United States so that's a good thing . 1065775_1079375
like Trojan cow . 1079795_1080415
&=laughs:multiple &-um and then the other bad thing is really that there they don't have any treatments yet . 1081455_1087235
these are two possible ones they're looking at one is a drug that would &-uh attach the center of the alpha helice helices and that'll make it so they can't change the beta sheets . 1087335_1095755
so pretty much your normal prion proteins can't change to infectious prion proteins . 1095955_1100215
so then you can't get the &~dise the the disease can't spread so that's good . 1100515_1103695
&-um the other one which they're still testing and I hope this'll work but you can just totally splice out the prion protein gene so that we don't produce any prion proteins so those can't even +//. 1104595_1115315
so they can't produce them they can't change to infectious prion proteins . 1115465_1117925
of_course they don't know if this'll work because the prion protein can have another function in our body which we might need . 1118805_1124185
so they're testing it in mice and hopefully the mice act the same as us and &=laughs we don't need it . 1124705_1130185
&-uh in conclusion &-um &-uh the TSEs you know they're they're rare which is I mean they're rare which is good but they're very lethal which is bad . 1131245_1139965
&-uh BSE has decreased substantially there's not that many anymore I mean it's all over the news because news stations put out Mad Cow then we watch for what's called Mad Cow . 1140505_1148885
but really it's not that prevalent anymore and then there's been less than a hundred cases total in the past seven years for Variant Creutzfeld_Jakob disease and that's I think about ninety of them are all in the UK there's like less than five other places in Europe and Asia . 1149525_1163225
so it hasn't really spread that much . 1163745_1165105
but if it does spread like AIDS has that's bad news again we have no treatment so if spreads a_lot_of people are gonna die . 1165585_1173625
so that's it . 1173785_1175245
&=applause yeah ?

is this at all related to hoof and mouth disease ? 1215235_1217675
no and a_lot_of people are asking that because I think it's transmitted the same way it goes from cow to cow by eating cows but it's just another disease in cattle that's not a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy it's you know it's not prions it's just a disease in cows . 1218185_1230485

&=laughs &-um I didn't give you a paper outline since nobody looks at it anyways so &=laughs:multiple this is my outline . 1352885_1358345
we'll talk about what it is what the causes are different types &-um some of the dangers you face when you jump out_of planes then we'll talk about &-um people who live at high altitudes and how they adapt to hypoxia and then we'll talk about some cool interesting stuff that hypoxia does in medicine . 1358495_1374015
alright so what is hypoxia ? 1374775_1378295
&-um cells need oxygen <in the> in the electron transfer chain as you know it's an electron acceptor and &-uh they don't really function adequately when the supply's &~d &-uh when the supply's depleted and this is what essentially is hypoxia &-um it's the low levels of oxygen in your body . 1378325_1396045
&-um low levels of oxygen to the brain produce inappropriate behavior and then &-uh if you're exposed to it for a while you're gonna lose consciousness and then you're gonna die . 1397245_1406205
&-um basically the brain doesn't sense oxygen directly . 1406825_1411965
there're chemoreceptors in your aorta and your carotid artery and they sense the saturation of hemoglobin . 1412605_1419465
so if the &~s &~he hemoglobin is not saturated as it wouldn't be if you went to a high altitude it'd perform a &~fu physiological change make you breathe faster stuff like that . 1419925_1429625
and then +... 1430185_1430565
this &~i these are the different kinds of hypoxium . 1434145_1436205
&-um hypoxic hypoxia is what happens when &-um oxygen pressure is reduced . 1437385_1441725
so the hemoglobin leaving the lungs is not saturated +//. 1442345_1444245
that's what you think of when you think of hypoxia . 1444405_1446105
&-um it can happen if you go into high altitude also it can happen &-um with anything that reduces respiration like drugs some some diseases &-um cause you to breathe less and you're oxygen &~ni partial pressure is not what would be if you were breathing normally . 1446715_1462595
&-um also anything that weakens the respiratory muscles causes &-uh hypoxic hypoxia . 1463275_1467735
&-uh next is anemic hypoxia is what happens is when &-uh the hemoglobin of oxygen is reduced &-uh hemoglobin is reduced . 1468515_1475195
&-um &-uh what happens is your red blood cells production is not what it is when you're healthy and &-uh your &-er basically your erythropoiesis is low . 1475675_1486675
and that can happen from stuff like iron deficiency or vitamin deficiency . 1486955_1490135
alright ? 1490875_1491055
&-um stagnant hypoxia is when &-um you have reduction of the supply of oxygen because your blood supply isn't as good . 1491165_1497605
so if your heart's weak doesn't pump as much blood your cells are gonna be hypoxic in the peripheral portions of your body . 1497745_1505185
also &-um cytotoxic hypoxia this is very &-uh interesting basically &~y your cells can't use oxygen and that can happen if you have &-um stuff that's more (0.4) &-uh more has &~b better affinity for &-uh hemoglobin than oxygen . 1505455_1524555
so let's say you're a smoker right anybody here smoke ? 1525155_1527595
yes alright . 1528195_1529255
don't smoke it's really bad . 1529655_1530695
&-um &=laughs:multiple so basically right now &~f &-um your oxygen level in your tissues is what &~w would be at three thousand or eight thousand feet . 1530805_1540865
right and you're &~ap approximately at sea level alright ? 1541145_1543665
anybody here who's a runner ? 1543985_1545025
Doctor Zappa I know you're a runner right ? 1545485_1546625
so you ever notice that if your running down the side of a busy road you can't do as_well_as &~yo were running in the park that's because all the carbon monoxide that's &~exp &-uh from the cars has a better affinity for hemoglobin and binds to hemoglobin and you can't get the oxygen to you're body . 1547005_1560585
so run in the park . 1561325_1562885
&=laughs alright &-um short term symptoms basically &-uh you get dizziness giddiness tingling sensations euphoria blurred or tunnel vision &-uh your lack of muscle contraction and a slow reaction time . 1563935_1576255
&-uh you can see how jumping out_of planes with these symptoms wouldn't be exactly &-uh beneficial . 1576995_1581975
okay &-uh we'll move to parachuting . 1582295_1584455
so there's a joke &-uh sky divers say that the reason we jump out_of planes is because we don't have enough oxygen to the brain . 1584795_1591295
&=laughs it's not because we're crazy or deranged . 1592655_1594555
alright &-um a hypoxic altitude &~abo around thirteen thousand feet is the critical limit where you don't show any physiological symptoms &-um the hemoglobin saturation is about eighty eight percent &-um you go above that symptoms begin to occur different people show symptoms in different ways and that's that's pretty much the basic idea there's no set &-um set signs . 1596315_1620575
different +//. 1620635_1621235
some people are gonna start breathing faster I saw a kid just pass out &~righ right &~abo right away we weren't even at twenty five thousand feet we were about twelve and he already passed out . 1621475_1631215
&~so so people are affected but differently . 1631635_1635095
&-uh so &~p like as I said before hypoxia leads to a variety of symptoms &-uh which not necessarily conducive to parachuting . 1635575_1642975
&-um slower reaction times decreased muscular contraction stuff like that can lead to &-um a jumper misjudge altitude &-uh mistake equipment . 1643265_1652585
your different rip cords are on different sides of your body and you can collide with other jumpers since you have tunnel vision . 1653325_1658625
&-um critical danger is passing out which prevents you for pulling the rip cord and this will ultimately lead to a collision with the Earth if you don't have any special equipment on you that's gonna deploy the parachute . 1658985_1669145
and since the momentum is conserved you're gonna die . 1669585_1672945
I've I've heard of people that bounced off the ground +... 1673565_1676705
it's very rare <if you> if you're gonna +//. 1679225_1682185
I mean there're cases where stewardess fell off &~a &~air off twenty five thousand feet &~ch all the way to the ground and survive . 1682565_1688145
&-uh these things are very rare and they don't happen often . 1688505_1691045
most of the time if you do bounce I've heard of a person that did bounce off of the ground survived two days later he died of a massive internal injury . 1691115_1699615
so what you do to prevent this &-um &=laughs jumpers use special oxygen masks and &-uh high altitude suits just like high altitude pilots &-um constant training in in &-uh pressure chambers make you recognize these symptoms and know that you have hypoxia so you don't freak out . 1700075_1718395
did anybody see Officer and a Gentleman ? 1718805_1720045
yes you know how the guy freaks out in the pressure chamber ? 1721145_1724345
you don't want that to happen when jumping out_of planes &=laughs:multiple you want that to happen in training you don't want that to happen . 1724725_1729725
alright &-um also anytime that you're flying about eighteen thousand feet and doing a jump &-um there're special technicians that fly and they monitor the crew so if the &~q the crew is showing symptoms of &-uh hypoxia they're gonna say you can't <jump you can> jump you can't jump and &-uh one of the advice they give if +//. 1730245_1747485
since pressure and volume are &-uh related is don't eat baked &~b beans and drink Budweiser before you jump &=laughs:SUf it's not good . 1747925_1756305
alright now we'll then move to people living in high altitudes &-um since person remaining at high altitudes for a long time he gradually become accustomed to it +//. 1757335_1767015
if anyone lived in Colorado you realize when you first get there it's really hard to get up the stairs but maybe &-uh six months to a year later you're alright you know people come visit you and then you start laughing at (th)em because they can't get up stairs . 1767175_1777155
&-um different populations show different adaptations . 1777535_1781895
these are the symptoms &-um you're increased pulmonary ventilation you have more hemoglobin increased &-um diffusing capacity in the lungs increased cardiac output and &-um your cells are better adapt to utilize the oxygen however not everybody shows these symptoms in these particular order or all these symptoms some populations show some some populations show others some populations show all . 1782255_1805075
for example there was a study done on Tibetan and &-um Andean high altitude natives and the Tibetan ones showed pulmonary ventilation and increased hemoglobin in the blood but the Andean only showed &-uh increased cardiac output so their heart &-uh beat a_lot they &-uh produced a_lot more blood with each beat . 1805435_1822535
&-uh also certain enzyme &~sys@n &~sys@n systems are more &~plen plentiful in animals that live above thirteen thousand feet and they help them utilize oxygen more effectively . 1825685_1834405
alright let's move into hypoxia and medicine &-um hypoxia is linked to many &-uh major illnesses for example like Alzheimer's &~a arthritis some cancers occur because you have poor oxygen delivery to &-uh vital tissues but mild hypoxia is very beneficial &-um it &~str it strengthens the pulmonary system increases strength and endurance and it boosts the immune system . 1835445_1857325
that's why &-um athletes train in high altitudes . 1857685_1862085
but it doesn't necessarily show performance increase for them . 1862315_1866475
but &~treasmen treatments like the hypoxia room have been developed . 1867935_1872635
and what it does you sit in this room for a certain amount of time and then you leave . 1872815_1875875
it's an intermittent &-uh treatment . 1876195_1878335
you just can't sit in there for all all the time . 1878455_1880655
it only is effective when you change your &-uh level of &-uh hypoxia that you're exposed to . 1881195_1885915
so what it does is improve your oxygen delivery to the brain the joints and the peripheral tissues through your body's own mechanisms . 1887035_1892815
so you're not taking any kind of foreign substances in . 1893055_1894975
&-uh the kidney detects a lower pressure of oxygen then it releases erythropoietin which is a hormone +//. 1895315_1902435
which anybody studying for the MCAT should memorize . 1902875_1904735
&=laughs &-um it stimulates the marrow to produce extra blood cells the increased amount of red blood cells carry more oxygen to the muscles making them work harder and longer . 1905675_1913915
&-um this system like I said is only effective if your exposure is intermittent it's gonna increase oxygen delivery to the brain and peripheral tissues . 1914195_1924195
so it's like going to the USA Olympic Center but only you're not there you're here . 1924675_1927935
alright like I said &~m it hasta be intermittent otherwise this &-uh some people show no improvement &-um significant results have &-uh been shown with a cure of bronchial asthma sixty three people have been cured and thirty four percent cured +... 1929405_1946825
that had diseases dependent &~o hormone dependent conditions . 1948905_1951525
&-um chronic pneumonia shows a_lot_of progress shows xxx disease does too . 1952645_1957125
any kind of disorders protein lipid carbohydrate metabolism people have been exposed to &-um intermittent hypoxia show increased benefit &~an obesity depression &-uh post surgical recovery has been showed to be speeded up . 1958035_1974375
(0.4) alright now then we'll talk about cancer . 1975135_1979875
&-um tumors are hypoxic because blood vessels supplying them are relatively poorly organized and disoriented compared to normal tissue . 1980195_1987175
&-uh this leads to inefficient oxygen supply which is hypoxia essentially . 1988835_1993015
also as oxygen diffuses from the blood it's depleted by normal cell metabolism so &~cer certain cells beyond a certain distance don't receive their share of nutrients and become hypoxic . 1993795_2004255
so who cares ? 2004615_2005935
well most cancers as you know are treated with radiation right ? 2006045_2009785
and since hypoxic cells are &-uh a_lot more &~re &-uh resistant to radiation treatment it takes &~abo about three times more radiation to kill them . 2010705_2021545
so if you're being thrown in the radiation room you're gonna be exposed to a_lot more radiation so that's why hypoxia is very detrimental to cancer patients . 2022025_2032405
but the presence of hypoxia in &~tuma tumors has been linked to &-uh a_lot_of failures in clinical radio therapy so +//. 2032795_2039615
to achieve local tumor control . 2039995_2041755
and the degree &~o degree of hypoxia in cancer patients has been demonstrated to predict the &-uh efficacy of treatment . 2042875_2050115
well we're almost done so don't fall asleep . 2051815_2053655
&=laughs:multiple oh in conclusion we've talked about what hypoxia is what causes hypoxia different types symptoms we talked about parachuting and we talked about some medicinal applications . 2054335_2063195

so the necrotizing the name actually comes from &~necros the &~ne the necrotizing comes from necrosis which is &-uh actually comes from the Greek word necros@q it's &-uh killing of the living flesh . 3383805_3395605
and then the fasciitis part is &-uh comes from the word fasciae which is the tissue between the skin and the muscle . 3395925_3402565
so it's the necrotizing fasciitis and then it's also a bacterial disease not a viral disease and also it's caused by either aerobic &~bac bacteria or anaerobic bacteria or a combination of both of them . 3404185_3420145
but the most common one is the aerobic bacteria &-uh called the group A streptococcus and that's actually the same one that causes strep throat . 3421245_3429985
so except &-uh the only difference is there's forty strands of &-um group A streptococcus and only two or three of them can cause the necrotizing fasciitis . 3431025_3441365
it's just differs in &-uh the proteins on the bacteria we'll get into that later . 3441765_3446585
&-um so what is it ? 3447885_3450845
it continues &=laughs &-uh so it infects into soft tissue and &-um it spreads pretty rapidly and &-uh you +//. 3450765_3460725
okay &~ye &~n normally it doesn't get into the muscle it just gets &~th the &-um tissue where the arteries and the fat and nerves are but &-um if it does get into muscle then that's pretty bad . 3461705_3472965
it's called necrotizing myositis . 3473185_3480745
&-um your chances of survival go down extremely and it can destroy flesh of a rate of one inch per hour .
and that's actually pretty fast like in grade school I don't know that's &=gestures I learned that was an inch so like let's say you got it at night and you woke up with it and that's like eight hours of your flesh gone I mean that's that's pretty fast . 3484785_3497185
but you also see symptoms of it too so &-um okay the statistics of it &=laughs:multiple &-uh it's a pretty rare disease only three million people get it a year &-uh and also unfortunately it's a very high mortality rate up to seventy six percent of people die from it . 3498065_3516585
so &-um in the United States there's a hundred to four hundred and fifty cases of it . 3517525_3520865
&-um there's also like okay the death can occur after &-uh up to fifteen hours so if you think of that that's like so fifteen inches of your flesh can be gone I mean that's that's pretty serious so it makes sense it can &-uh happen that quickly . 3521545_3536725
and also &-um fifteen to thirty percent of people have strep A but that's that's not &-um that doesn't relate to necrotizing fasciitis strep that's just regular &~str like one of the other strands of strep A like strep throat or something but &-um yeah so fifteen to thirty percent don't even show any symptoms but you can still get &-uh necrotizing fasciitis from that strep +... 3537465_3558965
so how do you get it ? 3559465_3563085
&-um the disease itself doesn't spread like what I was just saying &-um you can't +//. 3563585_3569025
so once you get the necrotizing once it starts &-uh &=laughs:multiple &-uh &=laughs once it starts spreading in the flesh you can't like go go rub your hand on someone you don't like and it's not like they're gonna get it . 3569165_3579405
but &-um this the group streptococcus and that's pretty much all I'm gonna be talking about is the group A strep (be)cause that's all that it's the most common and also the doctors know scientists know the most about it . 3579745_3591905
&-um so you can spread that &-um easily and that's how people can get the strep . 3592665_3599225
and if you have &-um a minor cut or opening or bruised skin it can +//. 3599825_3605265
the bacteria can enter through there . 3605405_3606565
and if you're in the presence of strep someone that has strep that helps get it . 3606785_3611805
and &-um yeah so we already talked about how it's your basic serotype of a strep so the different M proteins on the bacteria &-um cause it to be more virulent than others and can therefore make it more &-um powerful . 3612385_3630865
and it's &-uh more powerful in how bad it can get . 3631025_3636025
alright so the high risk groups &-um if you're diabetic if you're a IV drug user if you're alcoholic or if you have the chicken pox . 3637085_3647205
those these people tend to get it more than others although it doesn't really discriminate between age sex or gender &-um I guess age and gender are the same +//. 3647385_3658125
or sex and gender but &-um race doesn't really &-uh discriminate (be)cause &-um children can get it and older people can get it . 3658705_3667485
the average age is like forty three years old and both women and men get it the same . 3667585_3672565
so symptoms within twenty four hours alright &-um the area that's infected will probably become sore you &~c it'll &-um you might get the flu probably little sick and you'll probably get really thirsty . 3675405_3689225
so it's really hard to tell if you have it within the first twenty four hours (be)cause you &~sh basically show symptoms of having the flu . 3689685_3697005
so if you go to the doctor he probably will have no idea +/. 3698465_3701245
+, ew +/.
+, that it's that . 3702065_3702545
&-um yeah sorry about the picture but &-um so after three to four days then you have advanced symptoms . 3703125_3709385
the area might &~swe will probably swell . 3709825_3712105
&-um I've actually seen it before and how I've seen it , it looked <like a big> &-uh like a big bruise , it looked &~pur like a purplish bruise and like red and it was like swelled up a_lot . 3712725_3723985
and so yeah it that's after that was after like four or five &~day like yeah four or five days of it . 3724265_3730885
so then you can you probably know something is going on . 3731005_3734225
&-uh &=laughs it also starts to hurt really bad too . 3734625_3737545
and &-um if &~tha if you continue to &-uh go without any care then your blood pressure will decrease . 3738625_3746225
&-um toxic shock can go into effect so your you can have kidney failure or liver failure and unfortunately if it goes that bad you can probably get unconscious . 3746465_3756765
&-um here're some pictures &-uh with patients that with necrotizing fasciitis &-um this is probably this is after like a good six days I think of having it you can see the progression and how it kills the muscle and they turn black obviously and that's like a blister that's pretty extreme form I haven't seen one that bad . 3759025_3781445
this is actually isn't a symptom at all but that's &-uh a person that had it removed and that's she had a skin graft and that's <what it> what it looks like . 3781835_3791575
treatment &-um right . 3794195_3797295
I mean it's kind_of obvious that a &~treatme you want to get rid of the infected tissue as soon as possible so it doesn't spread . 3797895_3802935
and the only way you can do that is since it's &-um below the skin you can't really see it . 3803435_3808455
that's &~wh &~th &~th that's why it's so misdiagnosed the first couple days (be)cause it's under the skin and you can't really see it so doctors just think it's a rash or something . 3808365_3818165
and &-um so within that first couple days it can spread and you really wanna the sooner you go to the doctor the sooner &~y you &-uh can get the get it removed then your the better your chances are . 3818885_3832265
&-um also you'll probably get antibiotic like penicillin shots and most people almost all people will have to &-um will have like flesh missing so they're gonna hafta get a skin graft and if it gets bad they &-um probably usually have to amputate . 3833105_3851145
but that's better than dying obviously . 3852705_3855145
&=laughs:multiple alright the biochem of this so how does this bacteria do this &-um it has this +//. 3857005_3861605
it gets into the cell by has &-um hyaluronic activity which which is outside the cell and it has the the causes this protein to break it up and sometime <I &~me> somehow it can get +//. 3862245_3875525
slide through the membrane to get into the cell . 3875965_3877465
and once it's in the cell you can &-um it escapes the phagocytes cause once usually when you have a &-um bacterial disease the phagocytes come and eat it up right ? 3877865_3885845
but &-um it kind_of like flows low under the radar because it has this M protein the certain strand +//. 3886425_3893265
the like the two &-um virulent strands that has the M the certain M proteins can get by and it also has a hyaluronic capsule which &-um scientists have found if they have those two things the phagocytes tend to miss it . 3893355_3909675
and &-um it can once it's inside it can &-uh release the cytosine &-uh proteases which &-um break &~u &-uh they cause proteins to +//. 3910355_3920555
or they cause +//. 3921065_3921785
they destroy tissue by breaking up the proteins &-um in the tissue and that can cause you blocking &-uh cell &-uh clotted or &-uh blood clotting and they can that's basically the &~r the cytosine proteases break up all the proteins within the tissue . 3923205_3943065
so +...
and also these same proteins that break up the tissue +/. 3946825_3950545
+, whoa +/.
+, &-um I don't know . 3953025_3954945
&-uh hit cancel you'll pull ⌈ the ⌉ +/. 3955125_3957405
⌊ alright ⌋ +/. 3957405_3957645
+, arrow down and cancel . 3957945_3958745
(0.8) <got it> .
alright so scientists believe this same protein causes the immune system not only to fight the bacteria and try to kill it but also kill the &-um the flesh around it so that is also another sign of how rapid it can &-uh spread (be)cause it's almost like a two on one action going . 3967365_3984825
you have the bacteria which is killing the flesh and then you also have the immune system which is trying to kill the bacteria and the flesh at the same time . 3984965_3992705
and then what we know of the anaerobic bacteria is that it causes a &~to it gives off toxic gas in the tissue and this causes like a cytotoxic &-um hypoxia +//. 3993745_4005905
what Gary was kind_of talking about last week . 4006345_4008025
and so it kind of &~st starves the tissue of oxygen . 4008705_4011805
and that's all I could find on anaerobic bacteria . 4012805_4015485
to lower your risk &-um like I said prompt diagnosis <the sooner you> &~b the sooner you find it the better your chances are and &-uh keep your skin intact don't cut if you get cuts you know bandaids whatever and good hygiene . 4016305_4031865
so we talked about what it is bacterial disease really rare but &-um really deadly and <you get> you get it from a cut and &~i you can it's passed from &~strep &-uh people that have strep A . 4035025_4050205
and symptoms are the swelling of it and flulike symptoms . 4051285_4055165
and the treatment &-uh is to basically remove the tissue and we talked about how it eats (be)cause it has that M protein and the hyaluronic capsule which it kinda get away from the phagocytes and then to lower your risk you &-uh basically have good hygiene and &-uh prompt diagnosis +... 4056265_4078285
there are my references any questions ? 4081165_4083505

⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you ⌋ went to the doctor and you just had like a rash or something but you wanted them to test for it do they take a sample of your rash then ? 4095715_4100855
&-um actually that's a good question &-um I found that they take a sample of your blood and they test a_lot_of stuff and I heard &-um the one test that helps the most (be)cause it's &~ki it's really hard to tell especially at the beginning but MRIs I guess &-um can test for it in the early stages and help doctors tell if it's &-um necrotizing fasciitis or not . 4100985_4121185
but yeah usually that's why it's so deadly (be)cause after you find it it's you can +//. 4121645_4126725

&=applause .
alright &-uh once again I'm Brett Boaton and I'll be doing ventricular septal defect and other congenital heart disorders . 4212825_4219245
&-um first off a congenital disorder is just simply a disorder that's present at birth . 4220225_4225845
and &-uh congenital &~abnor abnormalities account for the majority of &-uh of deaths of children under one year of age . 4226605_4232925
&-um as you can see from these numbers right here &-uh there's about eighteen deaths per one hundred thousand live births of children less than one year old and as you get older the number of deaths decrease . 4233655_4243435
&-uh congenital heart disorders are often divided into two types there's are those are cyanotic which is &-uh blue discoloration caused by a relative lack of oxygen or those are they're noncyanotic . 4245155_4256795
the most common cyanotic is &-uh known as the tetralogy of Fallot which I will be discussing later . 4257075_4261995
&-uh the most common noncyanotic ones are ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect and patent ductus@s:lat arteriosus . 4262815_4268895
&-uh ventricular septal defect is the most common of the &-uh congenital heart disorders and is seen three times as often as &-uh ASD and PDA +... 4269655_4277255
&-um the most cases of CHD the cause is unknown and difficult to determine however there seems to be a strong genetic linkage especially since parents who have had one child with a congenital heart disorder tend to have an increased risk of having another child with a congenital heart disorder . 4279785_4295005
this increase in risk ranges from about one in one thousand to about one in twenty . 4295765_4299725
&-um also infections in the mother are usually associated with children having abnormal hearts . 4300705_4306185
&-uh here is a diagram of the heart and before I go into the specifics of &-uh VSD it's important to review the anatomy and cycle of the heart . 4307825_4315645
&-uh &~se as you can see here the inferior Vena_Cava and superior Vena_Cava they dump blood into the right atrium and &~pa the right atrium it goes into the right ventricle from the right ventricle it goes through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs where it loads up on oxygen . 4316665_4332025
it returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins from here the blood flows down into the left ventricle from the left ventricle it flows to the aorta up here and the aorta it goes to the rest of the organs throughout the body known as the systemic circuit . 4332745_4346185
&-um of the forty thousand babies born each year with an abnormal heart nine thousand of these babies have what is known as a ventricular septal defect . 4347325_4356965
it's commonly referred to as a hole in the heart for it is simply a hole in the septum that divides the left and right ventricles &-uh this &~ven this defect may will vary in size from small to moderate to large . 4358555_4370855
may vary in the location possibly along the &-uh septum or near the heart valves it also will vary in the number with multiple defects possible . 4371195_4378455
&-um this hole in the septum allows blood to flow &-uh back and forth between the left and right ventricle . 4380055_4385515
and &-uh the amount and direction of flow is usually based on two things one the size of the defect with larger defects obviously allowing more blood to pass through and also the &~directi &-uh the resistance the &~sys@n if the systemic resistance is higher than the pulmonary resistance which is the &-uh usual circumstance in childhood <the blood> &~w the blood will flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle . 4386145_4409085
in other words the blood is taking the &-uh path of least resistance and also since the pressure in the &-uh left ventricle is much higher than the blood &-uh pressure in the left &~vent right ventricle and as you know fluids always tend to flow from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure . 4409625_4424745
&-um this defect will allow the blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle and from the right ventricle it will then enter the &-uh pulmonary arteries increasing the workload on the lungs +... 4426105_4434865
&-uh here's a picture of a VSD here you see the hole up there allowing the oxygen rich blood and the oxygen poor blood to mix and the blood then flows from the higher region to the +//. 4437025_4447725
higher pressure region to the lower pressure region and down through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs . 4448085_4451865
here is &-uh another diagram of a normal heart versus a &-uh VSD &-um you can see here the on the right side the mixing of the blood and the blood will then flow up through the pulmonary arteries into the lungs +... 4455725_4466565
&-uh there're different types of VSDs based on their anatomic location there are perimembranous VSDs which are located in the membranous septum . 4467105_4477405
which is &-uh usually located near the heart valves . 4478225_4480685
or you may have a &-uh muscular VSD which is located in the &-uh lower portion of the septum . 4481065_4485845
there're also inlet and outlet VSDs which are located near the &-uh entrance to the ventricular chamber and the exit to the ventricular chamber respectively &-uh membranous VSDs account for about eighty percent of &-uh congenital heart defects and &-uh &~muscu muscular VSDs account for about ten percent . 4486665_4505425
&-uh the symptoms of VSD usually include &-uh frequent respiratory infections &-uh shortness of breath sweating paleness you'll have a increased &-uh heart rate and increased breathing due to the &-uh extra workload on the heart and lungs and you'll also will have +//. 4505465_4520305
typically have an arrhythmia which is a disruption in the heart's electrical conduction system which controls the contraction of the atrium and the ventricles . 4520625_4527705
&-uh possible cause of VSD &-uh they think if the mother has &-uh rubella during pregnancy it might be transmitted to the fetus . 4529505_4536665
or &-uh poor prenatal nutrition &-uh the mother drinks alcohol &-uh possibly diabetes and if the mother is over forty years old . 4537465_4545785
from these causes it is easy to see some possible preventions if the mother does have &~r the mother should be vaccinized against rubella before pregnancy &-uh avoid alcohol eat healthy and if they have diabetes make sure they control it &-uh during and before pregnancy . 4546275_4560955
&-uh there're many ways to test for a VSD &-uh cardiologists will often use a just a &~teth stethoscope to listen for a heart murmur since a heart murmur is often the first clue of a &~V a VSD . 4561455_4571795
they also might use a electrocardiogram which measures the directional spread of electrical activity in the heart . 4573315_4578575
&-uh often they use echocardiograms which &-uh evaluate the valves and chambers . 4579555_4583335
they do this by placing &-uh a transducer on the child's ribs this transducer picks up the echoes of high frequency sound waves and transmit them to electrical impulses which are then sent to an electrocardiogram machine +//. 4583955_4594955
echocardiogram machine . 4595355_4595915
&-um there're still questions remaining about the heart's anatomy or if these symptoms seem &-uh out_of proportion to the size of the defect they will often use a &-uh a cardiac catheter . 4596635_4606315
and &-uh in this catheter they make a small incision in the groin and they send it up through a blood vessel to the heart . 4607295_4612955
using x@l ray images to guide it through &-um they also might use cardiac angiography which measures the degree of blocked blood flow in the coronary arteries they often might use &-uh oxygen saturation tests . 4613555_4623615
&-um if a child has a small defect &-uh fortunately it'll often often close on it's own spontaneously however however if the defect is &-uh &~fr rather large &-uh medications such as &-uh digitalis and diuretics are used . 4625675_4638635
&-uh digitalis improves the strength and efficiency of the heart and &-uh controls the rate of the heartbeat . 4639695_4644375
while diuretics will &-uh remove excess fluid that builds up in the lungs which will also &-uh reduce the workload of the heart . 4644915_4651035
&-um if the hole is still rather large after a couple years surgery is often necessary and they do the surgery using a heart lung bypass machine and they emplace a patch over the defect . 4651945_4661925
here on the left you can see a &-uh hole in the septum there . 4663125_4665925
and on the right they've put &-uh a small patch on it . 4666645_4668905
usually this one is made out_of fabric &-uh Dakron often they will use the patient's own tissue &-uh their own pericardian tissue . 4669145_4676005
&-uh and here's another picture of a &-uh patched up defect you can see there is no longer any mixing of the blood between the left and right ventricle . 4677945_4684025
if left untreated &-uh VSD can lead to congestive heart failure in which the &-uh the blood is no longer able to meet the demands of the body . 4684905_4693525
if the blood becomes backed up into the &-uh liver and GI tract people have a right &~sir right sided heart failure . 4694225_4699585
or if the blood becomes backed up into the lungs you'll have a left sided heart failure . 4700245_4703145
&-uh most importantly a VSD can leave to lead to infective endocarditis . 4704105_4707885
and &-uh infective endocarditis is an infection of the linings of the valves and chambers of the heart . 4708865_4713125
&-um most common one is bacterial endocarditis which is usually caused by &-uh streptococcus viridians &-uh this will cause &-uh &~li infections in the lining of the blood and and &-uh you'll see some growths and these growths may dislodge and send clots to the brain or lungs . 4714305_4729885
&-uh you also may see arrhythmias and delayed growth from children zero to five years old . 4730825_4735185
&-um a very closely related defect is atrial septal defect . 4737085_4740125
it pretty much shows the same symptoms as a ventricular septal defect instead of now there is a hole between the &-uh left and right atrium . 4740885_4747765
and you'll see an increase in blood flow in the pulmonary arteries just like a VSD . 4748545_4752165
&-uh here's a picture of an ASD . 4753485_4754605
at the top you see there's a hole which allows the blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium down through the right ventricle and out to the pulmonary arteries . 4755225_4762965
just like in a VSD . 4763565_4764205
&-um a VSD may be part of a larger scheme of malformation known as a tetralogy of Fallot . 4766205_4771465
this occurs when the heart does not develop properly in the mother's womb &-uh it is characterized by &-uh a narrow region that leads from the &-uh right ventricle to the pulmonary artery and since there's this region's very narrow the right ventricle hasta work much harder to get the blood past the blockage which causes the right ventricle to thicken . 4772485_4790025
&-uh that is the ventricular hypertrophy . 4791105_4792805
you also have a VSD and a &-uh aortic override and &-uh +... 4793065_4798485
in this picture you see the rather large aortic valve which causes the pulmonary valve on the left to be very narrow . 4800325_4805805
and now this high pressure right ventricle region will cause blood to flow from the right ventricle to the left ventricle and out so the &-uh systemic circuit to the left arm and brain and since this blood convicts and then go out to the rest of the body the baby will often appear blue &-uh usually under its fingernails and its lips +... 4806745_4822585
&-um in nineteen +//. 4824505_4826165
in the mid eighties the NIH initiated a series of &-uh research programs for cardiac development . 4826305_4831985
and now there're currently one hundred laboratories around the world dedicate full time to this . 4832425_4836045
&-um they use frogs fish chickens rats and mice and fruit flies . 4837185_4840305
in &-uh one particular fruit fly they found a gene that was needed to develop a heart . 4841065_4844945
and embryos without this &-uh gene do not develop a heart so they named it the Tinman Gene . 4845645_4850245
of_course after the Wizard of Oz character &-um they also discovered more than thirty other proteins that are &~import important to heart development &-uh such as muscle development valve formation and the electrical conduction system &-uh one group in Cincinnati they produced a mouse without a gene +... 4851005_4868025
hold on (0.6) . 4869805_4870885
must be something I didn't load right .
alright &-um they found a mouse without a gene for the transforming growth factor beta two and this &-uh mouse showed all the symptoms of a tetralogy of Fallot . 4881545_4888845
they also studied patients in East Finland with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . 4889705_4893745
&-uh this is relevant since muscular VSDs are often seen in patients with &-uh hypertrophic cardiomyopathy more often than the general pediatric population . 4894225_4904125
&-uh they found mutations in exon nineteen of the beta MAC gene and in &-uh exon five of the alpha tropomiacine@n gene . 4904845_4912185
&~interes interestingly enough they found that patients with &-uh mutations in the cardiac beta miacine xxx all had VSDs . 4913265_4920245
&-um although VSDs are typically congenital you can still get later in life I read about one case in South Carolina where a five year+old boy was shot in the chest by his brother with a BB gun . 4921125_4931545
and the the pellet ripped a hole through his heart and was later found in his apex . 4932165_4936505
&-uh fortunately surgery removed the apex and patched up the VSD . 4937465_4940465
&-um the outlook for a complete recovery in patients with a small defect is excellent . 4942085_4945705
as I said before they will often just close on their own . 4946025_4948185
&-um &-uh these patients with small defects can actually participate in any physical activity any sport &-um and even for large defects the outcome of surgery is very good however if &-uh if left untreated many complications can arise . 4948805_4963025
in conclusion most causes of congenital heart disease are unknown and they seem to be &-uh genetic . 4964645_4970485
&-uh ventricular septal defect is the most common of these congenital heart disorders and is simply just a hole between the left and right ventricles &-uh VSD may be part of a larger scheme known as a tetralogy of Fallot which is often very serious and always requires surgery . 4971045_4985325
also genetic research on cardiac development is still in its infancy and many developments are sure to come . 4986345_4991045
I chose this topic because &-um I was actually born with a VSD at about one week old I went into congestive heart failure I had an arrhythmia and my heart rate went up to about a hundred and sixty beats per minute which really mean +//. 4992965_5005885
you're supposed to die when that happens but lucky me I guess . 5006185_5008685
&=laughs:multiple &-um and so I figured I'd wanna research it and see what it's all about . 5009585_5013985
and my resources any questions ? 5015045_5017705
&=applause .
I assume you had surgery . 5025445_5026345
&-uh actually I didn't have surgery . 5027065_5028685
they only put me on &-uh digitalis for &-uh about a year . 5029465_5032685
I hadta take two drops a day for a entire year and the hole actually closed on its own fortunately . 5032805_5038385

why East Finland ? 5041065_5042345
is there something special about East Finland ?
I don't know . 5042645_5044645

okay .
thank you &=applause .
alright xxx (0.5) &-um my topic is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome . 5115265_5117525
today we're gonna look at what it is how somebody gets it biochemically we're gonna look &~a at the effects of alcohol on the developing fetus the symptoms &-uh the prevention and then you're gonna get <a brief> summary at the end . 5118225_5129225
&-uh basically &~feta Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is an ARBD it's an alcohol related birth defect and what happens is alcohol will cross the placenta from the mother to the fetus and it'll damage the fetus while it's growing . 5130305_5141285
&-uh it's the leading cause of mental retardation in the West it's past Down's syndrome but it's also the leading cause of preventative &-uh mental retardation . 5141945_5150505
&-uh it's a disease that is the direct result of maternal drinking &-uh it lasts a lifetime has negative effects both pre and post natally and fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by three things it's facial characteristics of the baby &-uh growth growth deficiencies both in the womb and while it's living and then the mental &-uh retardation that comes with the disease .
&-um how do you get it ? 5172365_5173085
basically the only cause of fetal alcohol syndrome is maternal alcohol consumption &-um &~m I mean I might go into it later +//. 5173195_5180035
it says no alcohol consumption during pregnancy is <only way to be safe> . 5180575_5183255
a_lot_of physicians are trying to find out you know well this much wine at this stage in the pregnancy you know if I drink you know once a month once a week one point five ounces eight ounces stuff like that . 5183795_5192735
it all comes down to if you drink alcohol somehow your baby's gonna get affected . 5192895_5196615
however the probability and severity of the disease does increase with the amount of alcohol consumed . 5196605_5201605
so somebody that's a casual drinker versus a mother that's a binge drinker the severity degrees +//. 5202225_5206385
the disease is gonna increase . 5207025_5208165
&-um biochemically alcohol's a teratogen and an embryo toxic it affects the it affects the baby while it's developing in the fetus . 5209625_5218065
&-uh one one thing that it does is affects &~feta fetal blood flow . 5218665_5221785
basically &~fetal the fetus's blood flow is regulated by hormones and not &-uh its brain and what happens is ethanol it induces it reduces the release of nitric oxide . 5222075_5233355
nitric oxide has two roles in in the fetus . 5233475_5235535
first of all it's a get rid of free oxygen radicals and the second thing it's a &~vaso vasodilator which &-uh dilates the blood vessels . 5235955_5244075
&-um there's two theories &-uh about how it does it they're basically related what happens is is the &~moth the mother will drink alcohol it induce oxidative stress and there'll be a bunch of free radicals those'll come they'll &~ha affect the fetus so the nitric oxide's gonna be shunted away from working on the blood vessels to getting rid of the free oxygen radicals . 5244705_5261085
and one theory is that when it does that you can get a_lot_of platelet aggregation at the placenta wall . 5261625_5265445
and not enough blood is gonna be able to to go through the placenta and you're not gonna get the nutrients or the oxygen diffusion from the mother to the fetus . 5265585_5271685
and the second one is kind_of like along the same lines is that you know nitric oxide is getting rid of these free oxygen radicals it's not gonna be able to dilate the vessels . 5272185_5278745
you're gonna have vasal constriction and then you're gonna have chronic fetal hypoxia . 5279005_5282365
&-uh oxative &~rad I mean oxidative radicals are not good for the baby they it damages the cells they damage DNA &-uh induces apoptosis in some brain regions which &~is which is how it causes mental retardation . 5284145_5295725
&-uh the frontal lobe is used for higher learning cognitive processes corpus callosum &-uh relays message from the right and left brain a mother that drinks a_lot_of alcohol it affects the fetus's brain and you will actually like you'll actually lose brain mass in those areas . 5296545_5311125
also you lose dendrite spines in the hippocampus which is used for memory &-um we'll talk about the effects of that later on . 5311645_5317065
the symptoms +//. 5317645_5318145
I mean you have this thing called Fetal Alcohol Effects and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome . 5318545_5321185
basically what FAE is is the neurological effects it's not the fullblown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome so basically the baby will come out mentally retarded but it won't have the physical characteristics . 5321325_5330665
&-um a baby that's born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is really irritable &-uh like like he said &-uh heart defects or fifty percent of the time you get congenitive heart failure &-uh little muscle tone they're overreactive to stimuli I mean most babies are supposed to sleep up to twenty hours a day I mean right when they're born and these babies they don't sleep well . 5331405_5347485
and like I said with fetal alcohol effects I mean some even if they drink a little little alcohol can affect &-uh the baby's development &-uh drinking at at certain times in the pregnancy . 5348705_5359945
I mean here's a correlation that shows NC is no consumption PEA is just a little bit and FAS is the total and you can see that that &-uh with FAS you're gonna have no children above average you're gonna have a_lot_of them with deficiency and then no &~con no consumption you're gonna have a_lot more children with normal IQ than without . 5360285_5380305
physical disabilities &-uh and here's a baby with (th)em doing my research I found a_lot_of pretty sad pictures a_lot_of (th)em with &-um cleft palates <that were> that were messed up I mean with with their eyes and just horrible pictures this is just one of (th)em you can see he has a small head circumference &-uh the baby's eyes have this thing called epicanthal &~fol folds which short narrow eyes . 5382285_5401925
the &~cle the cleft palate you &~ca really can't see here &-um the thin upper lip microcephaly's just a small forehead and the short upturned nose . 5402625_5408925
&-um behavioral disabilities basically you get this thing called static encephalopathy and it's permanent unchanging brain damage . 5410345_5418825
and so &~what I mean what's gonna happen is this baby's gonna get older it's gonna hafta function in society . 5419105_5422865
so it'll gonna end up going to school and stuff like that and let's just say one day &~i it'll like cheat or it'll steal or something so you tell the baby like you know +//. 5423485_5429345
&~w well let's take an average baby and tell it you know don't cheat and then then maybe it'll cheat again then you punish it and stuff like that and the baby will end up learning right ? 5429905_5437425
because because &~the they'll see that you know if I cheat I'll get punished I'll get grounded stuff like that . 5437445_5441545
&~b but babies with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome they don't have the physical brain matter right ? 5442105_5445965
so &~the they +//. 5446265_5446565
in their brain they don't have the the &~ne the nerves and the neurons to make these <to make> to make these &-um consequence I guess like &-uh results you know what I mean like they can't learn . 5446905_5457445
and so in school they &~d they don't remember rules . 5457785_5460525
they're prone to lying stealing and cheating sexually inappropriate activities . 5460885_5464425
a_lot_of times these children will have psychological damage because the way they look . 5464965_5468365
children will make fun of (th)em and stuff like that . 5468685_5470165
they're really hyperactive they get ADD . 5470525_5472485
they get I mean <it's just> it's just really basically hell for these children as they go on in life . 5472685_5477525
&-um treatment prevention I mean don't drink while you're pregnant basically that's it . 5478125_5483585
&-um I came across one that said you_know even after birth they'll say the mother didn't drink and then she drinks while she's breast feeding . 5483985_5489005
&-uh the alcohol can affect her levels of prolactin and oxytocin which are used for breast milk . 5489905_5494065
&-um that's not good for the baby either . 5494925_5496605
and I_mean you you'd figure that you know somebody who drinks they get liver failure somebody who drinks they can get into car accidents stuff like that . 5497325_5502325
and you've got like a you_know big adult weighs you_know a hundred fifty two hundred some pounds and you've got a little fetus that's this big . 5502425_5507785
and you'd think it'd be logical you know I mean whatever goes into the mother's gonna cross the placenta and affect the baby but it's only been around since nineteen seventy three I think that's when they put the facial the growth and the mental deficiencies and linked it to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome . 5508345_5519425
and &-um there's a_lot_of +//. 5519785_5522525
like I said earlier there's a_lot_of studies being done right now at a bunch of hospitals I mean what they're trying to do is they're trying to find out you know how much alcohol is safe for the mother to drink . 5522705_5531605
&-um they're and they're &~tr they're &~fin they're also finding out that like there's also neurotransmitter imbalances with children that that &-um drink a_lot_of alcohol +//. 5532465_5541865
I don't want to go into all of the studies (be)cause it's kind_of boring . 5542065_5544325
&-um there's this picture I came across that says this is a four year+old girl that has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome . 5545205_5549545
she will need structure and support services for the rest of her life without early identification intervention many children with FAS will end up in jail before they're adults . 5550365_5558565
<and it's> estimated that fifty to eighty percent of the persons in the criminal justice system suffer brain damage due to alcohol exposure before they born . 5559085_5565645
&-uh I mean fifty to eighty percent that's pretty big and &-uh to prevent FAS don't drink while you're pregnant . 5566705_5572225
&-um summary conclusion Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a alcohol related birth defect the three major things is the growth deficiencies the mental retardation and there's the physical effects of the face . 5573005_5584505
it's a teratogen it'll just cross the placenta from the mother bypassing diffusion to the baby and it'll screw it up while it's developing . 5586055_5591655
it has like I said negative &~ef physical and mental effects and I mean you +//. 5592435_5597215
the only cause of it is maternal alcohol consumption so the only prevention is don't drink while you're pregnant . 5598055_5602275
references questions comments or concerns ? 5603475_5605855
&=applause yeah ? 5606995_5612975
&-uh okay did you do the &=laughs do most of these cases come from like events where the mother consumes like large quantities of alcohol or does it ever come from cases where you know someone doesn't know they're pregnant in the early stages and they drink and then ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 5613875_5627255
⌊ alright yeah like ⌋ I said I mean I got this one study that said they did at Chapel Hill North Carolina that says that even one drinking session of you know five drinks really early on in the pregnancy can cause to can cause mental retardation <and many of the> facial defects . 5627715_5641195
<I mean> I mean obviously you know if a women gets pregnant she doesn't know for a little bit and so even you know drinking really &-er early on in the pregnancy can affect it . 5641525_5649225
but obviously if the mother binge drinks and stuff like that there's a heavy +//. 5649365_5652145
like the more alcohol she consumes the more alcohol's gonna be in the fetus the worse it's gonna be . 5652425_5656245
<I thought> the &-uh first trimester is the most important &-uh one for restraining your drinking xxx did you read anything about like drinking after the &~se second term ? 5656865_5671505
<I mean> I mean yeah &-uh not with me . 5667125_5671385
I mean obviously because the baby the fetus is growing more in the first and second trimester I mean that's when most of the neurological stuff does happen . 5671565_5678365
but still I mean <they are> they are trying to do research to find out which stage in the pregnancy is the worst . 5679065_5683185
but I mean I didn't come across one thing that said it's okay to drink in the &~s third trimester . 5683485_5687465
it's it's okay to drink in the eighth month . 5687645_5688965
I mean any alcohol consumed will affect the baby . 5689145_5694165
did you find any stuff that said &-um it was &~eas or it wasn't as bad when they did it through breast feeding ? 5691545_5698025
no <I mean> I mean the breast feeding thing I mean that's not the that's not it +//. 5699085_5702305
breast feeding the baby's already done Fetal Alcohol Syndrome's actually alcohol in_utero it's when the baby is developing and that just affects the amount of breast milk and it can cross from the mother to the baby through the through milk . 5702665_5713105
<and that's what I understood> . 5713905_5714925
I know this isn't what you were looking at but did you read anything about how alcohol can harm sperm and therefore there is an effect from paternal drinking . 5716525_5726165
&-um no honestly . 5726405_5728805

hi I'm Anjali Balaff I'm gonna be talking about stress and cortisol today and &-um all the negative effects of that . 5857305_5862765
this is a little &-uh it's just a brief outline of what I'm talking about first I'll go into a little bit about stress &-uh and the different types of it the symptoms then I'll talk more about cortisol and then I'll debate the two . 5864385_5875965
&-um okay . 5876765_5880445
stress is just basically defined as a reaction of the mind and body against change the change doesn't hafta be an unpleasant one it could be a good change a bad change it's just something that your body's not ready to face that creates stress . 5880585_5892425
and it produces bodily or mental tension it's caused by pressure to meet demands or just things that your body isn't ready to &-uh face . 5893025_5901225
there're mainly three types of stress the first is mechanical stress and that's caused by physical factors like lifting heavy objects exercising too much or not exercising enough . 5903805_5913225
&-uh mental stress is caused by emotional aspects or social aspects and that's &-uh like not getting enough sleep or marriage problems relationship problems &-uh work problems things like that . 5914185_5926385
and finally there's chemical stress which is a much broader category but it's mostly a chemical input &-uh in your body and environmental factors so it's caused by pollution or &-um fumes from your furniture or carpets things you may not think that could cause stress but they do . 5927025_5945065
those are chemicals &-uh oops it's &~jus &=laughs:SUm okay &-um the different symptoms of stress they're not all that easy to recognize but it's important to make notice of them . 5945935_5957215
they're a result of pressure from change and there're three types of symptoms . 5957675_5961255
physical symptoms are &-uh symptoms like &-uh they they include difficulty sleeping nausea dizziness &-um they can be even more dangerous like &~s chest pains or difficulty breathing . 5962165_5974885
emotional symptoms are &-uh include troubles relaxing fear anxiety things like that &-uh and social symptoms are uneasiness being alone &-uh but not accepting invitations not wanting to go out things like that +... 5975595_5992295
&-um there're many different effects of stress it lowers the body's ability to adapt to changes in the environment but I'm mainly going to be talking about is how it causes elevated levels of cortisol in your body and &-um how that creates many problems if you have too much cortisol if you stress too much . 5994705_6011005
so now I'm gonna talk about cortisol that's just &-uh the structure of it . 6012905_6017405
&-um cortisol is also known as hydrocortisone it's &-uh it's the principal glucocorticoid and glucocorticoids &-um &-uh stimulate gluconeogenesis they increase the breakdown of proteins they help with mobilization of fatty acids and they're also inhibitors of inflammatory response . 6019635_6038235
&-um it's secreted by the adrenal cortex and &-uh its secretion enables us to adapt to external changes and stress . 6039215_6045835
this is a picture of an adrenal gland that +//. 6047445_6050765
we have two adrenal glands they're located on top of the kidneys . 6050905_6053605
&-um each one has an inner medulla and an outer cortex and as you can see cortisol is produced and secreted mainly by the outer &~cor &-uh cortex along with other hormones +... 6054545_6063625
and the way cortisol is synthesized as I said it's &~co &-uh synthesized in the outer cortex of the adrenal glands it's levels are determined by the &~hypoth hypothalamic pituitary adrenal cortex axis and I'll be showing you a picture of that so I'll I'll explain that later . 6066665_6082205
it's also affected by the sleep wake cycle which is the &-uh &~cir circadian rhythm and it's monitored by neural stress signals . 6082905_6090385
and its secretion is regulated by ACTH which I'll also show you a diagram . 6091425_6095185
this is these are just the major steps in the synthesis of cortisol and other major hormones . 6095845_6100365
they all start out with &-uh cholesterol and that produces cortisol . 6100805_6107545
this is the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal cortex axis and what happens is a stress is put on the hypothalamus and that produces &~cort &-uh corticotrophic releasing hormone and then &-uh that goes into the pituitary which releases adrenal corticotrophic hormone which is ACTH .
and then that regulates cortisol production and then cortisol has a negative feedback mechanism on both ACTH and CRH &-um and so in this &-uh hypothalamic pituitary axis &-uh the negative feedback mechanism suppresses ACTH and CRH . 6127945_6147185
(0.4) okay &-um levels of cortisol are maintained by a &~cir &~cir I spelled it wrong but it's circadian rhythm . 6152395_6159935
that's just your sleep wake cycle it's established during infancy it's regulated by &-uh neural signals and the way they do that is they control the negative feedback mechanism of cortisol in the hypothalamus it has episodic secretions due to ACTH &-um and that's &-uh cortisol's transformation from a recursor of ACTH that's how it's regulated . 6160215_6183095
this is a graph of the different levels of cortisol in your body &-um they're lowest when you first sleep but there's a steep incline around eight AM it's highest around nine and then it gradually tapers off until the night again +... 6184665_6201365
okay there're many different roles of cortisol it's essential for protein lipid and carbohydrate metabolism it aids in muscle tissue maintenance and the way it does that is that it promotes amino acid release giving our body more energy it suppresses inflammatory responses and the way it does that is it &~down regulates phospholipase a@l two activity and that promotes formation of precursors of prostaglandins . 6203625_6226385
&-um it promotes conservation of &~gluconeo &~g glucose and the way it does that is by stimulating gluconeogenesis by enhancing the activity of enzymes in the liver and promoting more glycogen breakdown into glucose . 6228815_6241035
&-um it also +//. 6241595_6244815
oh this is <where we get into> gluconeogenesis . 6245455_6246615
it increases mobilization of free fatty acids and that it activates the release of these fatty acids from adipose tissues by aiding in the synthesis of hormone sensitive lygase@n . 6246875_6256535
&-um and it depresses immune reactions . 6278825_6288825
okay &-uh the mismatch theory is &-uh &~s scientists were wondering if elevated levels of cortisol are so bad for the body then why does our body produce so much of it when we're stressed .
so they traced it back to millions of years ago to early human life in Africa where &-um if a human heard a lion's roar or something related to a life threatening situation then their cortisol levels would immediately rise to counter that to calm their brain down release more amino acids and give us more energy .
so back then that was necessary it was important it was life saving . 6293345_6296925
but today we don't really experience life threatening situations . 6297585_6300565
but we do experience constant stress . 6300945_6302705
but our body cannot &~dif differentiate between a life threatening situation and the stress so every time we do stress over something as little as meeting a deadline our cortisol levels immediately shoot up . 6303285_6313725
and that leads to many different problems . 6314145_6316065
and &-um this is called a &~mismat a mismatch theory by evolutionary biologists . 6316385_6321705
and &-uh they just say that it creates health problems mainly due to cortisol . 6322525_6326345
cortisol is the main culprit here . 6326345_6327725
so these are some of the effects of high levels of cortisol &-uh one is overtraining syndrome and that is when you're working out you do definitely need cortisol in your body but if you work out too much then more cortisol's &~p pumped out and more proteins are broken down you have less energy and it ends up I mean not being good obviously . 6329385_6349545
there's Addison's disease which is actually due to lower levels of cortisol and that's due to &-um it's due to &-uh destruction of the adrenal cortex . 6349835_6359875
then there's Cushing syndrome and that's due due to adrenal hyperfunction which produces more ACTH in the pituitary . 6360755_6367275
other effects are hypertension which is high blood pressure osteoporosis glaucoma impairment of immune and reproductive systems . 6368195_6375315
this is just a picture of all the different effects that you can have you can start out with just depression but lead to more dangerous things like cardiovascular disease schizophrenia &~a &-uh anorexia so you know it's not that good to have high levels . 6377355_6391995
&-um and this was an interesting thing I found there was &-uh research done in New York that showed a correlation between post traumatic stress disorder and lower levels of cortisol in humans . 6394505_6405945
and they studied it on Holocaust survivors and they found that people with post traumatic stress disorder have lower cortisol levels than other people . 6406505_6416145
and they mainly said that &-um trauma alone doesn't lead to post traumatic stress disorder . 6416725_6421985
it's cortisol the lower levels of cortisol <that leads> that lead to it . 6422205_6425485
and they said &-uh the reason that maybe is because the brain becomes hypersensitive to the effects of cortisol . 6426265_6431625
and this is a graph that they did &-um the blue is the control group and as you can see the Holocaust offspring with the lowest levels of cortisol definitely had post traumatic stress disorder whether or not their parents had it . 6432465_6444645
and this is some other research that's being done on a correlation between stress and HIV . 6446745_6451585
there're two theories that are being studied the first is that HIV forces adrenal glands to secrete lots_of cortisol and that &-uh in turn damages the immune system the second theory is that one of HIV's proteins acts as a glucocorticoid and this also damages the immune system . 6452145_6468205
it's really controversial they're still doing a_lot_of research on it &-um it's still in its middle stages but what they're basically saying is that HIV isn't the killer cortisol is . 6468755_6478915
that that's the main reason why these people are dying . 6479475_6481595
but as I mean obviously that's very controversial so they're still &~s doing research on it . 6482395_6486255
so basically you can see high levels of cortisol are not good you shouldn't stress too much so you should learn stress management and prevention . 6487735_6495055
ways you can do that is you can change your diet &-um keep well hydrated eat &~r &-uh foods rich in protein and minerals but the main thing to do is just relax don't let the stress get to you be able to recognize your stress symptoms and &-um act on that . 6495595_6511335
they've also come up with some medications that are used to lower cortisol levels RU four eighty six and procaine are two of the drugs that are being used in the HIV &~s &-uh studies . 6512695_6522815
RU four eighty six is actually an abortion pill . 6523685_6525385
they're both seen to reduce the levels of cortisol in HIV patients . 6525545_6530385
cortblock@n is actually &-um the world's first natural cortisol &~compou cortisol &~compou compound and that's used for weight training and it's just shown to suppress cortisol production and enables greater amino acid uptake . 6530965_6545965
&-um these are just some interesting facts I found . 6546485_6550425
forty two percent of all adults suffer adverse health effects due to stress . 6550655_6554375
stress has been linked to all the leading causes of death including heart disease cancer accidents cirrhosis and suicide . 6555175_6559955
nearly half of all American workers suffer from symptoms of burnout a disabling reaction to stress on the job . 6560655_6565715
&-um and then high cortisol levels predict high alcohol consumption in young adults . 6566895_6571995
alcohol withdrawal leads to increased production of cortisol which can be toxic to nerve cells and even lead to damage to the hippocampus . 6572555_6577695
so &-um in conclusion we see that stress leads to <high levels of cortisol> high levels of cortisol lead to a_lot_of different problems health problems mental problems so you should learn good stress management to counter the negative effects of this &-um you change your diet or just relax and it's just important to recognize all of that . 6579305_6600565
these are the references +...
any questions ? 6601945_6606405
&=applause .
did you see anything about stress and cortisol levels in relationship to &-um cancer survival ? 6614895_6620815
yeah &-um I &~s like it was mentioned in a_lot_of the articles I read but not like it was also mentioned in the HIV article but they never really elaborated on it . 6621735_6629275
so I'm not really sure what the correlation is . 6629835_6631475
there is a correlation but I think there's still a_lot_of research being done on it so they're not really sure yet . 6631555_6635795
(0.4) .
thank you again .
&=applause .
okay alright +/.
+, okay &=laughs .
xxx it's gonna be alright now xxx +/.
okay +/.
+, alright good .
(0.5) .
&-um my name's Paveny by the way . 6701335_6702855
&-um and my talk today's gonna be on obesity . 6703335_6705615
&-um I's actually just gonna start off with this . 6706415_6708475
I found a really funny article while I was looking this up about how &-um the cartoon Fat Albert actually promoted young children to go out and eat more engage in like &=laughs:multiple binge eating . 6708635_6718415
and they think you know like &~i I mean the whole article was +//. 6719135_6722695
I mean it was written by some like editorial person it was basically that like this cartoon was like a bad influence on young children so I just thought it was kind_of funny so xxx &-um okay . 6722715_6735495
&-um so the basic question that is that underlies obesity is whether it's caused by biological &-um whether &~bio it's biologically caused or whether it's an environmental &-um condition . 6735795_6747455
&-um there's been <a_lot_of research> a_lot_of research on the biology of obesity and there's been a significant amount of it on the environmental explanations too so we're just gonna go through both of those and &-um try to figure out you know which one it's leading to +... 6747895_6761495
okay so we're gonna start off by defining obesity . 6762275_6767915
&-um obesity's basically when your BMI which is your body mass index is greater than or equal to thirty . 6768675_6774615
&-um basically how &~y you guys can all figure out your body mass index if you want to it's &-um your weight over your height squared and &-um it's so basically it's an epidemic and it's defined as having an excess of body fat . 6775185_6788185
&-um the people who are most prone to becoming obese are people who are overweight and that's defined as your body mass index as being between twenty five and thirty &-um people in industrialized countries just because there's a_lot_of money put into &-um advertising for food &-um commercials and stuff like that . 6788585_6805905
&-um and obviously inactive &~a lifestyles &-um also leads to obesity . 6806705_6811205
alright these are just some interesting facts that we came &~ac that I came across . 6811965_6815145
&-um twenty five percent of all American adults are obese which is very high compared to other countries . 6815665_6820945
as I mentioned before because we live in an industrialized country &-um fourteen percent of the children between twelve and nineteen are overweight . 6821125_6828205
and obesity &-um leads to fifty to a hundred percent increase risk in death which is a pretty serious &-um number . 6829205_6836385
so why should we care ? 6837945_6838725
&-um obesity leads to &=laughs:SUm a higher risk of heart attacks and this is because &-um as we all learned fat &-um clogs up your arteries and that causes &-um heart attacks . 6839465_6851225
&-um obesity can also lead to diabetes because fat &-um tissues are found to &-um actually inactivate insulin receptors and that &-um can lead to type two diabetes . 6851785_6862805
&-um obesity also slows down your brain function &-um this was actually they did a study on rats &-um rats that &-um take in a_lot_of fat they actually have problems &-um with memory and learning so &-um they the researchers encourage you to &-um eat high carbohydrate diets instead of fat diets &-um so I just thought that would be interesting for all you MCAT people who are studying now . 6863425_6888565
&=laughs:SUm okay is it biological ? 6889285_6890625
basically what happens is they found a gene called the OB gene which is &~e responsible for the expression &-um of a substance called lipton leptin . 6890995_6899395
&-um leptin is directly &~respon &-uh or is responsible for decreasing weight or decreasing eating which is you know which would decrease your weight . 6899875_6909655
&-um and it does this by affecting another substance called neuropeptide Y . 6910235_6914675
so basically people who are obese +//. 6915315_6918015
&-uh leptin's produced by adipose tissues . 6918105_6920565
so you would think people who are obese they have a_lot_of fat tissues so +//. 6921005_6924225
and fat tissues secrete leptin so why is that people who are obese tend to overeat a_lot ? 6924705_6929545
and so that was like the main question that the researchers were trying to figure out . 6929805_6932925
the answer to that question is that in addition to secreting &-um leptin fat tissues also inactivate insulin receptors as I mentioned before . 6934165_6943505
so this inactivation of insulin receptors triggers the brain to think that there's not a_lot_of glucose in your blood . 6944185_6950565
so then the brain's like alright this this person's hungry so we need to start eating more . 6950985_6955685
so the brain releases neuropeptide Y directly into the hypothalamus which is responsible for eating for &-um increased feeding . 6956145_6963325
so what you have is you have a high level of leptin in your body and a high level of neuropeptide Y in your brain . 6963965_6969945
neuropeptide Y stimulates feeding whereas leptin is supposed to act on neuropeptide Y to decrease feeding . 6970285_6976725
but since neuropeptide Y is already in the brain its effects &-um or leptin's effects doesn't leptin does not affect neuropeptide Y's activity (be)cause it's already synthesized and it's already in the brain . 6977365_6988265
okay we just went through that . 6988565_6992005
alright so basically how is this all found out ? 6992265_6994125
they &-um did a_lot_of work on mice and rats obviously and they're +//. 6994955_7001135
they have OB OB mice which &-um are lacking the OB gene and these &~mi so these mice they don't produce &-um a_lot_of leptin . 7001475_7008695
and they were found to be obese as &-um was hypothesized by the researchers . 7008995_7012555
so then they went and they took out the gene that makes neuropeptide Y as_well_as the gene that makes leptin . 7013295_7019255
and these mice +//. 7019775_7020975
so they thought okay since we're taking out both these genes there's not gonna be any leptin but there's not gonna be any neuropeptide Y to stimulate feeding . 7020865_7027685
so they thought that these mice &-um should show decreased &-um decreased weight like lower than normal or like about normal . 7028405_7036205
but what actually ended up happening was these mice were heavier than the normal mice but they were lighter than the mice that were lacked in leptin altogether . 7036645_7044885
so this led to the conclusion by researchers that &-um leptin acts not just on neuropeptide Y but there's also other &-um hormones and substances in the body that are responsible for feeding . 7045825_7056225
so that's basically where research is heading now is &-um trying to figure out exactly what else is responsible for increased feeding . 7056565_7062645
alright environmental &-um the environmental studies that have been done have been on family life &-um it's been found that if you're from a cohesive family &~w &-um that has a set like kind_of like a leader of the family and like rules and stuff &-um you tend to be better eaters just because you're taught at a younger age &-um how to be structured and stuff like that . 7065115_7085135
&-um whereas if there is no like set leader like person &~ru like leading the &~f ruling the family &-um people tend to not develop &-um structured eating habits . 7085505_7094465
&-um moods is another one &-um it's been found that if you're dieting or restricting &-um your food intake and if you're feeling lonely or depressed or just socially withdrawn you actually tend to eat more in those situations than people who are not dieting and who feel lonely . 7095485_7111145
&-um activity &-um also is another one obviously &-um it's a big problem especially in the United States as I mentioned earlier just because of technological advancements that we have &-um you know we have cars and TV and so just &-um our &~a lifestyles are just a_lot more passive than people in &-um more underdeveloped countries . 7112265_7131145
&-um in &~inter an interesting study that was found &-um supporting the environmental causes of obesity &-um hadta do with a group of Indians &-um called the Pima Indians . 7131745_7141625
&-um they were actually separated +//. 7142425_7143465
they lived in Mexico and they were actually separated some time around the Middle Ages and they're +//. 7143665_7148605
&-um half of the Indians &-um moved to Arizona where they were forced to like take on the American way of eating and &-um diets and stuff and the other half <still lived> &-uh still lived in Mexico . 7149045_7159685
it was found that the Indians that live in Arizona were on average fifty seven pounds heavier than the Indians that lived in Mexico . 7160185_7167745
and they're also &-um thought to be like &~the they're they're also &~re referred to being like the most obese people &-um in the whole country so I thought that was just an interesting study that was done . 7168565_7180685
okay treatments for obesity . 7181485_7182925
&-um these are the &~biologic there's two ways to biologically treat obesity . 7183685_7187165
one is called the single mechanism and that type of treatment +//. 7187785_7191065
or &~th those drugs they &-um are geared towards just dealing with one problem like &~i an example would be to &-um decrease neuropeptide Y . 7191345_7202145
like the drug would just be interested in doing that . 7202225_7204085
and these types of drugs are only ten percent efficient (be)cause as I mentioned earlier there's a_lot more that goes on with obesity than just &-um the OB gene and neuropeptide Y . 7204725_7212705
and &~the I mean ten percent like it'll decrease your body weight by ten percent and that's in &~mo most cases that's good enough to get out_of the danger zone for being obese but people don't stick with these treatments just because they don't see any progress in their body weight so they're just like alright whatever and they give up on the treatments . 7213185_7230065
&-um double mechanism &-um treatments &-um target two pathways and an example would be to stimulate &-um epinephrine release and serotonin uptake and these types of drugs show a twenty percent &-um decrease in body weight and so they're more successful just because people see the effects &-um sooner . 7230465_7248425
so basically in conclusion &-um we just went over the quick facts and tried to identify the problem and the prevalence of the problem &-um we searched for a cause is it biological or environmental ? 7251285_7261125
&-um there hasn't been I mean people's there hasn't been like a resolution in this argument &-um people think that if you practice good eating habits as_well_as like maintain &-um or exercise once in a while like once or twice a week they say is even good enough . 7261865_7275945
&-um then you can reduce your risks of becoming obese . 7276585_7280185
and then we just went through the treatments and that's it those are my references . 7280765_7285845
&=applause any questions ? 7286945_7291185
is Michigan still <number one> fattest state ? 7293225_7295825
&=laughs .
yeah +... 7296385_7296705
&=laughs okay thanks . 7298565_7301305
thank you everybody &-um five piles on the front and if you wanna look at my new computer <you can> . 7303135_7328975
