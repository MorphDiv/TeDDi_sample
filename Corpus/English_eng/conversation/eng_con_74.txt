the story was about a guy that <(i)s supposed to> had a friend .
one name was Jimmy .
one name was Bob .
can't remember specifically which one they was .
one was eighteen one was twenty when they separated .
and they had met this restaurant you_know .
and they said that they promised that they would come back and meet
so the one guy was waiting for his friend to come by .
and the police officer asked him .
he said +"/.
+" just me officer .
+" I'm just standing here you_know waiting on my friend .
+" we promised twenty years ago that we would meet here you_know .
and so the police officer had a conversation with him .
and he went on .
and he continued on his way .
but little did he know he went on down the street okay .
now in the middle part I got kind_of confused <in terms of>
he him and the guy was talking .
and they started to walking .
oh somebody came across the street and lit a match from what I read .
he came across the street .
and he said +"/.
+" is that you Jimmy ?
+" yeah is that you Bob ?
and they start talking .
the two guys started to walking .
and then he said +"/.
+" you not Jimmy .
well <the last part> get to the last part .
he was saying that he had been around the corner .
<he saw> he recognized him from the paper .
that he was somebody else .
and he went around the corner got the police officer .
and you_know +...
(be)cause that's what +...
he left him a note .
that's it .
that's everything in a nutshell I can remember .
everything in a nutshell .
well I mean it's some particulars .
I don't wanna take it out of context with some particulars .
like I said it used to be a restaurant years ago .
and last part I read he was arrested .
the police arrested him you_know .
I could tell you a story .
when I was a child I went to a grocery store .
no it was a drug store early one morning .
I was going to school .
and I stopped off at the drug store .
(be)cause I wanted to get a umbrella .
and when I looked across the counter it was some people in the store .
but when I began to walk around the store everybody seemed to
it was one person behind the counter .
and it was a guy walking around with a long trench coat pair of
I'll never forget .
and then I kept as I walked around the store you_know .
so like I looked again .
I didn't see that many people in the store .
so finally the guy later on I guess after I walked
he walked up behind me .
and he said +"/.
+" son the manager would like to see you in the back you_know .
so when he said that he had my arm .
he picked up my arm .
said +"/.
+" the manager would like to see you in the back .
so as I got to the back of the store it was about four or five
and he turned around .
so I lay on the ground .
he was robbing the store .
so when I turned around I seen his gun .
he was pointing a gun .
he said +"/.
+" alright everybody lay down .
+" everybody lay down on the floor .
so I laid on the floor .
and <the other guy> I looked .
the other guy had was standing behind the other lady with a
and he was standing behind me .
so he said +"/.
+" alright everything lay down on the floor .
so they went and did what they had to do .

so they say +"/.
+" alright everybody get in the cellar .
+" don't nobody come out until we gone .
or something he was saying .
so he rushed everybody downstairs .
waiting about ten minutes .
he slammed the door first right .
