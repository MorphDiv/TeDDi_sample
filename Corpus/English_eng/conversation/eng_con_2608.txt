&=writes:board okay where are half of us +..?
well it's not time yet that's why .
xxx &=begin_conversation_between_instructor_and_student .
so what did you think of Kimberly's email about my &-uh .
the +//.
⌈ whose ⌉ +/.
⌊ the ⌋ +/.
+, email ?
the one from Kimberly about &-uh oh we're gonna do our own thing you guys can go out and do your own thing ⌈ and then xxx ⌉ .
⌊ oh Michelle's ⌋ +/.
Michelle ⌈ xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I think ⌋ it's fine .
I mean basically <what they're> what they're saying is that we can go ahead and do our annotation and then we'll merge and then they get the last say which is sorta what we told (th)em was okay anyway +/.
+, right +/.
+, but I don't know what to do so how big is the problem of these redundant sequences ?
what what +/.
+, hm +/.
+, <I mean> you tell me .
I mean the &-uh +/.
+, &=intermittent_background_noise I emailed Bill and Michelle this ⌈ morning ⌉ +/.
+, saying what gives there's duplications sometimes multiple +/.
+, did you look ⌈ at that ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ copies ⌋ I haven't had time I've been completely overwhelmed I got as far as emailing .
my job is to email and coordinate your job is <to do> the work .
+, &-um I I don't know what to do .
well why don't we sort_of +//?
I_mean Kim wants BLAST everything against everything .
some of this is being done in MAGPIE for the first fifty or so by tomorrow morning .
so what I'm doing is I'm BLASTing all the MAGPIE ORFs against the caulobacters so actually it's &~fa FastAing so that if MAGPIE called exactly the same ORF as TIGR did then it'll show up in that evidence section as a one hundred percent homology right there .
and is it so is it from X to X ?
so what's really worrying me is what TIGR's supposed to have sent us was linear sequence +/.
yeah +/.
+, called the genome how can entire sections be different then ?
yeah ⌈ it's a problem ⌉ .
⌊ they screwed ⌋ up .
they did screw ⌈ up ⌉ .
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ this means that that that the Seacor people were messed up to even get it +/.
+, yeah you know ⌈ what we should look at it a little ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I mean so they need to know this ⌋ they're gonna go up and stand up in front of this national meeting and say look we have it all in order and we have and then I don't wanna get up there and say oops you're wrong .
⌈ I don't know I mean ⌉ .
⌊ well &~d I mean ⌋ &-uh you probably shouldn't be saying oops ⌈ you're wrong .
you know anyway but &~w we should know ⌉ +/.
⌊ well but but xxx ⌋ +/.
+, what's going on .
+, right +/.
+, we can find regions I I know exact +//.
so what happens is when you're looking at say you have &-um you know ⌈ like ⌉ .
⌊ but ⌋ is it in is it a complete contig ?
is it a ⌈ complete X ⌉ +/.
⌊ it's not a +//.
+, to X ?
it doesn't look like complete contig but it looks like big regions of the specific contigs .
are the junctions between that's clear that they don't ⌈ know that they're ⌉ .
⌊ I haven't ⌋ looked at it that closely yet Mikhail might be able to give you an answer to that that's what +//.
we're gonna meet after class and discuss it but what I've seen is that +//.
so in these results you'll see the results of the FastAing homology and you'll get two ORFs that are precisely the same score which is impossible +/.
right +/.
+, and there're two different TIGR ORFs that are identically the same you know identical .
it's never worse than two ?
never I've never &~s I haven't seen it worse than two but I only have data on the first twenty &-um groups by this morning so +/.
okay +/.
+, &-uh .
how long (un)til you get the rest of the genomes in <egg form> ?
I have the first fifty groups BLASTED BLASTN BLASTPED &-um +/.
right +/.
+, and the first fifty groups done with the FastA search against the caulobacter is +//.
+, okay +/.
+, that's a FastA three p@l so it's a protein amino acid one .
&-um I won't have the HTML read on the reports generated +/.
+, before I go +/.
+, before &~tomor &-um <by tomorrow> by tomorrow I will have the HTML the reports generated for the FastA for all the first fifty .
+, okay +/.
+, but I will not +//.
&=noise_disturbance we won't have the <full complete> set before you go .
I &~wo it's too computationally <like a ⌈ frenzy> and I don't ⌉ .
⌊ yeah well I know ⌋ that .
this isn't working correctly hey you guys know how to do this ?
when are you leaving exactly ?
&-um I've got a flight Saturday but I don't know what time .
okay so yeah no the weekend will be when when the majority of the rest of the BLASTing gets done .
okay we can &-um we'll do something .
but you know we can get the first seventy .
but I'm wondering if this is why when when Yermin sent me back <and he said> you know we've got all these transporters .
is it that they're duplicates ?
you know he says that <call factors discussed in these> xxx transporters and things like that maybe ⌈ maybe it's just that there's some duplicates ⌉ .
⌊ &~i it looks ⌋ like the regions that are repeats are somewhat close together like you'll see ORF sixty four fifty five will be exactly identical to ORF +//.
TIGR ORF sixty two +/.
okay +/.
+, you know they're not more than a thousand ORF pollitins@u which tells you something about how close they are in the actual linear sequencing .
I need to teach .
I'm being a really bad example here .
&=end_instructorstudent_conversation:_4:40 okay .
&-um let's see today we're gonna talk about transcription &-um you've only got a couple more lectures you've got this lecture and the next lecture prior to an exam .
&-um I have not scheduled a &-um a room for us to do a review session in .
&-um I need to talk about times &=micase_introduction_follows but I think I'll introduce these guys first .
&-um &~a anyway we +//.
there there is an ongoing mission to make sure that your education is of high quality and good standards .
and one of the challenges is to make sure that not only at the professor level do we stand up and we at least try to speak coherently to you but we also try to make sure that our graduate teaching assistants have have &-um a_lot_of training and that they have different exposure to different styles of teaching and that sort of thing .
and and all of your TAs actually go through a TA training workshops and the degree of the training workshop will depend upon the &~s the student that comes in .
anyway somebody's brilliant idea as part of the training is to have them look at transcripts from different sorts of lectures and don't ask me .
so we're gonna get recorded today &-um and some poor &~sh unfortunate soul will have to read the transcripts at some point or they'll pick it apart at some point or I don't know what's gonna happen .
but why don't I introduce these guys and they'll tell you what's really going on I just sort of say yes to things that are easy .
&-um &=micase_recording_announcement .
I can tell you're all gonna be quiet all day long &=laughs:multiple you're gonna say I'm not gonna say a word but it could be worse .
I was actually webcast once where it was like nationwide webcast that was very weird .
so my lab could log on and watch me while I was in Rackham speaking &-um that's very bizarre .
anyway okay so just ignore the little man behind the curtain .
&-um alright so we wanna talk about transcription next Thursday we're going to move on and do some introductory molecular biology .
and the goals are to get you to the point where you can start reading papers .
okay so we've only got <two more> two more lectures in_order_to get you to the point where I think that you're gonna be comfortable reading papers .
&-um I do need to schedule a review time .
it's going to be next Wednesday the sixteenth .
&-um I assume there's gonna be all kinds of labs and conflicts but let's start marching thorough the day to see if we can find a time that you're shaking your head no way .
bad day +/.
+, &=laughs:multiple bad day &-um ⌈ how bad is it ⌉ ?
⌊ unless unless it's ⌋ really really early .
no &=laughs .
okay .
he's on his own .
okay or after eleven thirty at night .
yeah &=laughs:multiple .
⌈ that's my bedtime ⌉ .
⌊ well I'll be up ⌋ .
&-um .
is Wednesday the only day we could do it ?
hm ?
+, is Wednesday the only day we can do it ?
well the problem is I'm out_of town I don't get back in town until Tuesday late +/.
+, I don't know what time my flight gets back .
I could conceivably do it Tuesday evening .
is that better ?
yes .
mhm .
I have class (un)til ten though seven (un)til ten .
uhuh I won't do it at ten .
&=laughs:multiple &-um weren't you the problem last time ?
no +/.
+, &=laughs:multiple oh okay .
&-um okay .
&-uh &=sound_effect okay we we're we're missing one on each .
is there anybody else that has a problem on Wednesday night ?
we have multiples .
anybody else has a problem on Tuesday night ?
we have &~t .
what time on Tuesday ?
yeah how late ?
&=sound_effect &~se it doesn't matter seven eight nine something .
after nine I'm asleep so I mean .
could we do it a little earlier like ⌈ six ⌉ ?
⌊ well I ⌋ don't know what time my flight gets in .
I I have to fly in from DC and depending upon the weather I think I leave at one or two I should be back by five or six but we need flex time in case of traffic and stuff .
the last thing I want is you guys sitting in the room and me not there .
so let's assume seven or on on Tuesday or all day Wednesday anytime but that looks like it's not gonna work .
okay so some of you are just not gonna &~ha be able to show up .
so we need to find out what is the least inconvenient time .
&-um how many don't want to do it Tuesday +..?
okay how many don't want to do it Wednesday ?
no you don't wanna get one vote .
okay so it's gonna hafta be Tuesday .
the three or four of you that cannot attend on Tuesday email me okay ?
make sure that you do all the study guide questions you make sure that if you have any concerns any questions email me .
and what would be better is if you can buddy up with somebody that's that's actually went to the review session .
okay ?
so it will be Tuesday evening and I will tell you the time is any +//.
is is seven o'clock okay ?
is eight o'clock better ?
okay .
seven just feels right .
&=writes:board so I will make it seven unless if my flight plans say that I can't &-um and we can go until nine and so if that you can't make it at seven but you show up at eight that's okay .
let's make it a couple hours long .
okay .
I will give your study guides on Thursday &-um same format do all the questions make sure you've read the book make sure you do the questions in the back of the book .
it should be relatively straightforward .
&-um okay .
last lecture I completely messed up trying to explain &-um migration of holiday structures and gene conversions .
I've decided that instead of trying to do it a second time I will just refer you to the figures .
your figures in your textbook are actually clear .
&=writes:board &-um if you wanna know about gene conversion +...
go to page &-um two hundred and thirty figure nine five .
and if you didn't understand the migration of the holiday junctions &-um I think page two twenty the figure nine point two is relatively clear .
if you still don't understand it email me or we'll go over it during the review session okay ?
&-um &-uh in your course pack I had told you that we were actually gonna be in chapter eleven today &-um that's true .
&-um I'm going to pick up a little bit in chapter twelve which is on page &-um two ninety seven to thirty oh five and I'll explain why when we get there .
and I want you to go back to chapter two and read page forty seven to fifty one because some of the introductory things that I wanna talk about we sorta skipped &-um we skipped earlier on in the quarter or <in the> in the semester .
&-um what I wanna do today is start with the really fundamental basics of transcription and gene control and sort_of work my way to some more detailed mechanisms .
and the reason is is that many of you have had molecular biology and you're sick to death of this and you know it really well and some of you are juniors and this is your first upper level and you don't really remember it or you never really learned it right the first time &-um when you were exposed to it .
so let's just start from the beginning I'll try to move relatively quickly &-um and I'll try to use examples that maybe you haven't had before or you haven't had extensively before .
&-um so transcription &=writing:board basically means that you're going from a DNA molecule and you're making an RNA molecule and the RNA can be messenger RNA transfer RNA ribosomal RNA it doesn't hafta be messenger RNA although we're really biased and we almost always say that you're gonna make an MRNA .
and in order for a gene to be transcribed &-um part of the sequence hasta be read if this is just a double stranded DNA molecule .
okay going five prime direction to thirty prime left to right the RNA is going to be read by the template strand okay which is the bottom .
so the RNA is gonna look in essence identical to the top strand and I almost always write it like this .
so this is an MRNA or an RNA going five prime to thirty prime .
and if you remember the difference in the RNA molecule is that you're not gonna have t@l-s you're gonna have u@l-s so every place that you had a T up here you had a U .
and this is convenient and it's actually it's convention so every time you're reading a paper or you're looking at a DNA sequence and they only give you one strand they usually give you the top strand and it's exactly what the RNA is gonna look like so you can just transcribe it in your head back and forth .
they should almost always go five prime to thirty prime .
so this molecule looks exactly like that and it was coded for that .
now in order for transcription to occur you need to have RNA polymerase find the right place on the DNA and to initiate transcription .
you're all aware that RNA polymerase &=writing:board and it hasta first find the place to start transcription .
you don't transcribe all of the genomic DNA you only transcribe where there's a gene .
&-um ach .
anyway &-um there's you only transcribe where there's a gene that you wanna transcribe .
and if we now condense this down to the level of a genome I often draw the open reading frames as boxes you've seen this before so this is some sort of open reading frame upstream of the open reading frame is gonna be what's termed a promoter .
and the promoter is the location that RNA polymerase will actually bind .
it contains not only the sequences that RNA polymerase binds to but it also contains all of the DNA sequences that other protein factors might bind to that control it .
so the promoter contains cis_acting sequences &=writing:board that &-um proteins bind to +...
okay and proteins can include RNA polymerase itself it can include activators and repressors +...
mkay which we'll get into more things that turn up expression things that turn down expression .
what I wanna do is just sort of get into the basic features of a promoter first .
&-um all promoter regions are gonna have four things in common in bacteria okay ?
they have four features &=writing:board and the four features are either spacing or particular sites .
so for instance the first feature is the start site +...
you've often seen this it's called a plus one okay &~w on diagrams people mark the place that transcription starts is the plus one .
okay so on this little diagram the plus one would be the first nucleotide that comes off here .
or if we wanted to put that on the DNA sequence you would say that that was the plus one .
it's the very first nucleotide .
yeah ?
I missed it (be)cause I was writing but four features of the first open reading frame or the promoter ?
four features of a promoter &=writing:board yeah today we're not gonna &~r actually deal with the open reading frames at all .
I'll give them gene names occasionally but we don't care .
&-um what we're going to do today is talk about different ways in which you can turn genes up turn genes down and control gene expression &-um okay so every every transcript is gonna have a particular start site .
sometimes it's a little bit sloppy so if you actually map a start site you'll see that eighty percent of the transcript will start at one nucleotide and then there's &~t twenty percent will be one nucleotide up you know plus or minus from it but it pretty much starts in one place .
&-uh the start saits sites are often &=writes:board sorry .
they're often appearing okay but not always .
so you often see appearing &-um and adenine or guanine is the site but it it it isn't always appearing .
the next element that &=writes:board they all have is something called the minus ten region +...
and I'm gonna give you a specific sequence (be)cause then it lets me introduce consensus differences okay the minus ten region is a specific DNA sequence okay ?
so it's a cis_acting DNA sequence that has a particular &-um &-uh context .
the one I wanna write down would look like TA TAAT .
that's a specific minus ten region for some certain kinds of polymerases which I'll get to soon .
and so when you look at a promoter that's that's transcribed by these particular RNA polymerases and you look six to ten base pairs upstream of your plus one you're gonna see this sequence .
okay ?
and so where would that be on this little map ?
so on this open reading frame in the promoter region we might see the transcript starts there .
so this would be a plus one .
okay we're just making things smaller .
the minus ten then is gonna be a specific sequence upstream we should actually get definitions .
if you are in that direction from the plus one you are upstream +...
and if you are going that direction you are downstream .
&=writing:board just to make life difficult you count backwards okay .
if this is the plus one plus two would be the adjacent nucleotide plus one hundred would be a hundred nucleotides downstream .
you go negative numbers upstream .
so this is minus ten which means the beginning of it is ten nucleotides upstream .
okay so that's the second element .
the third element is at minus thirty five .
okay so it's thirty five nucleotides upstream .
&=writing:board and the specific sequence that I can give for that would be TT G ACA for a particular kind of promoter for the most frequent promoters that you see in E_Coli that's what you use +...
the other features that all promoters have is the distance between the minus ten and the minus thirty five is always conserved okay ?
thus their names you can name them minus ten minus thirty five (be)cause that's where you almost always find them .
so the fourth feature is the distance is conserved .
&=writing:board and it's usually sixteen to eighteen nucleotides in between the minus ten and the minus thirty .
yeah ?
I have a question +/.
⌈ minus thirty five ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ specifically about ⌋ counting &-um is &~th is there a zero ?
or &~d +/.
+, there's ⌈ no zero ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ do ⌋ you just go plus one minus one ?
+, yeah +/.
+, and they go from there okay .
+, isn't that weird ?
⌈ it ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ that ⌋ that was it .
I was just curious .
it's math that doesn't work right .
I ⌈ guess ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ ?
so it the minus ten region is that what we call TATA box ?
so this is the TATA box .
okay does the second one &~ha that ⌈ that one have a name ⌉ ?
⌊ well ⌋ you know what ?
I just lied through my teeth .
this is not the TATA box +/.
okay +/.
+, this is &-um it's (be)cause &~i the sequence is TATA +/.
+, right that's why &=laughs +/.
+, TATA box is a particular sequence element that you're gonna find in eukaryotic transcription .
and I do not know whether this can also be called a TATA .
in eukaryotic transcription when RNA polymerase binds it's specifically recognized as just a TATA +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, there is no minus thirty five +/.
+, okay +/.
+, and I don't know what the relationship is between minus ten sequence that's TATA and a eukaryotic TATA ⌈ box ⌉ .
⌊ so ⌋ if it's really homologous you don't know .
I don't know if it's the same +//.
it certainly is not the same protein DNA interaction .
so the protein that interacts and identifies these sequences in bacterial DNA &~po RNA polymerase are not the same as eukaryotic RNA polymerase +/.
okay +/.
+, okay ?
so whether you can call that a TATA box I don't think so .
+, okay &=laughs +/.
+, but I don't know .
+, okay +/.
+, we'll call it a minus ten minus thirty five (be)cause I know that's safe +/.
+, okay +/.
+, okay ?
&-um that gets us down to no I don't wanna skip yet .
okay .
I put these sequences specifically up here because I wanted to emphasize the fact that although this is an idealized sequence this is not the sequence this is not the sequence or the sequences that you're gonna find in every promoter .
these are consensus sequences &=writing:board most promoters are not gonna have these specific sequences .
and the way that you get +//.
you know I can write out this and your textbook will say that the minus ten region is TATAAT .
but in reality for any given promoter it's gonna vary some .
they came up with this because what they did is they allied all the minus tens from hundreds of promoters and they said okay what is the average promoter ?
so the consensus sequence is an average sequence &=writing:board from a whole lot of &~s motifs that you lined up .
so the consensus for the minus ten is this minus thirty five is that a consensus sequence for an activator binding site might &~b you know would be something completely different .
if you look at the frequency of how often these actually occur the T is pretty conserved and eighty percent of the time there's a T in that position the A is very well conserved ninety five percent of the time there's an A this T you don't see very often only half the time it's forty five this A is sixty .
this one's at fifty .
and this T is very well conserved .
so for any given promoter it it might have a T and then an A and then maybe a GGGT and that's still a good TATA box .
it's not a great TATA box but it would still be recognized .
okay similarly these are equally divergent okay so I just wanted you to have an example &-um you're not gonna always find this sequence and this sequence .
and that's why sometimes it's really hard when you're sequence gazing and you're just looking at your gene and you look upstream of your open reading frame you're trying to find your transcriptional control regions it's very difficult because they don't look exactly like this .
okay ?
now okay .
&-uh genes are transcribed at different levels .
okay ?
not all genes are transcribed at the same level and this is a good thing because you don't need every protein or every gene product in your cell or the bacteria don't need every gene product at the same level okay there are times when you need more of some product there's times when you need less of some product .
&-um for instance &-um ribosomal proteins .
ribosomal proteins &-um when the cells are rapidly growing in glucose you need up to seventy thousand ribosomes in your cell or <&~y in> the bacterial cell in_order_to translate everything efficiently .
when times are hard and the cell's growing very slowly you only need about twenty thousand .
and so you don't wanna spend all that energy making all those ribosomal proteins when you +//.
not gonna use them .
okay ?
so the cell has a way of coordinately turning things up and turning things down .
there are other proteins that you just need at a low level all the time and so you don't control them as_well .
one of the mechanisms of control is by how close to consensus these particular motifs are that a protein that needs to be transcribed very rapidly might be closer to this consensus sequence than one that's transcribed at a very low level .
okay ?
and this makes sense .
if you need these sequences in order for RNA polymerase to find a promoter it's gonna find it a_lot more efficiently if you're closer to consensus .
(o)kay ?
so high &~t high &=writes:board transcribed or &-um highly transcribed &=writing:board genes are usually closer to consensus +...
and not always .
&-um unlike in eukaryotes in bacteria most of the control gene expression occurs at the level of transcription .
if you can control how much RNA you make you can control how much protein you can make .
that's not absolutely true but it's more true for prokaryotes than for eukaryotes .
for eukaryotes there's a_lot more levels of control that you could feed into it .
okay ?
but for prokaryotes there really aren't .
okay .
so we have minus ten and minus thirty five regions &-um let's first talk about just what happens at this for the minus ten minus thirty five .
&-um RNA polymerase will recognize those specific sequences .
the molecule the RNA polymerase itself is composed of five proteins +...
it's a big it's a big complex .
it's four hundred and sixty five kilodaltons so it's very big and it's composed of a protein that's called beta a protein that's called beta prime two proteins that're called alpha and one protein that's called sigma .
in terms of if we wanna compare this to eukaryotic proteins in eukaryotic RNA polymerase these three proteins are &~f you can find similar proteins in eukaryotes .
certainly with beta beta prime there are proteins and eukaryotic RNA polymerase that look just like them .
the alpha is more divergent .
so the molecule's made of <one of these> one of these two of these and something called sigma .
&=writing:board these four proteins the betas and the alphas are the core polymerase .
okay so the molecule exists as a +//.
or the the RNA polymerase exists as a complex in the cell of those four proteins .
the sigma factor comes on and off .
okay ?
so core plus sigma is the holoenzyme +...
and it's the holoenzyme that recognizes the DNA .
okay ?
the holoenzyme recognizes the DNA because the sigma factor recognizes +...
the minus ten and minus thirty five regions .
so for the particular sequences that I gave you the only RNA polymerase that's gonna recognize this specific minus ten and this specific minus thirty five is the RNA polymerase that has the sigma seventy +...
okay ?
sigma factor .
if it has a different sigma factor this this protein does not recognize either one of these consensus sequences .
okay ?
it's a specific protein DNA binding xxx okay ?
so the sigma factors are sort_of the designer factors .
they can modulate the activity of RNA polymerase whichever sigma factor is bound to it will control which gene that polymerase can transcribe .
okay ?
sigma factors there's a_lot_o(f) different flavors .
&-um the sigma seventy is the housekeeping &=writing:board there are other sigma factors &-um which are turned on in response to &~sp specific environmental stresses or developmental pathways or may control &-um different kinds of functions such as generation of flagella and chemotaxis machinery .
I think we will probably be able to read a paper later that talks about turning on and control of different sigma factors and sporulation and so I don't wanna belabor on it I just wanna introduce the concept now that it's the sigma factor that actually binds to the DNA and you have different options for what sigma factor and RNA polymerase might be bound to .
okay ?
I don't wanna go into details today though .
okay .
where am I going ?
&-um okay .
so finding promoters is gonna be due to the function of the sigma factor when it's bound to these molecules .
and there was somewhere else I was going .
notes would be a good idea +...
is this a good thing to teach the TAs ?
I don't know where I'm going let me go look .
&-um alright .
let me tell you a couple other things I want you to know .
you can control the level of expression not just from RNA polymerase but you can modulate it due to the interaction of other factors that interact with RNA polymerase .
and I wanna sort_of take you from the big picture and then give you some examples .
(o)kay ?
there's two basic &~th things you can do .
you can either repress transcription or you can activate it .
&=writing:board I'm gonna draw you a grossly oversimplified version of how each of those processes work .
and then I'll give you some more examples that show you how complicated it can be .
&=writing:board okay .
if you have a gene somewhere on the chromosome (0.4) okay .
that it should have a certain minus ten minus thirty five sequence and RNA polymerase may or may not be able to bind to it &-um depending on how good those minus ten minus thirty fives are you might need other proteins to bind to it .
negative regulation would be a case in which when you add a repressor (0.4) the repressor then can bind somewhere in the promoter region and prevent transcription .
so when the repressor is bound &=writing:board (o)kay ?
I actually drew this (be)cause I was gonna transcribe the repressor sorry +...
okay +...
if however you can pull the repressor off of the promoter region or if you can remove it somehow then you can get transcription .
and the way that you usually do that +...
is you add an inducer .
an inducer is a molecule that can bind the repressor and when it binds the repressor it changes the conformation state of the repressor such_that it no longer binds to the DNA itself (0.4) so when the repressor inducer +...
complex binds then you get transcription .
okay ?
you have several examples you should well know by now for instance if this was the lac operon the repressor would be lac i@l the inducer would be lactose allolactose okay ?
or IPTG if you're in the lab okay ?
and the lac i@l falls off or cannot bind to its sequences when it's bound to inducer .
okay ?
what is this black box here that it binds to ?
we call the region that this binds the operator +...
okay ?
so the operator is where the repressor binds .
&=writing:board okay ?
and an operator is often just defined as an O promoters are often P even though operators are actually part of promoters but you'll often see that the promoter they're talking about is often just this binding site and then you might have an operator next to it .
the whole thing is technically the promoter .
okay but you'll see people that'll make a P and then an O or that's +//.
figures in your books .
okay so the default state with repression okay is that you're gonna express the gene .
if the repressor doesn't bind the gene's gonna be expressed .
okay ?
and &~th if you make a mutation the repressor the gene's gonna be expressed .
if anything happens to mess up the system your gene is gonna be expressed .
okay ?
you need a specific interaction of this molecule with that DNA sequence or your gene will be expressed .
okay .
with activators again you have a gene and you have some cis_acting sequence &=writing:board to which your activator binds I'll make an activator look like a lambda phage +...
so if the activator is bound we now get transcription .
(0.4) <the activator> &-um the activator often needs something else &-um and what would give you an example of that ?
yeah .
so the activator itself sometimes doesn't work unless it binds to something &-um an example that we'll talk about is the cyclic AMP that the CAP cyclic AMP complex the &~s the CAP protein doesn't bind in the absence of cyclic AMP to its cis_acting sequences .
okay ?
that's not always the case sometimes the activator itself can bind down .
but the activator needs to find cis_acting sequences and it does so by a &~p specific DNA protein &~con &-um contact .
the &-um the default state +...
though is no transcription +...
okay ?
because if the promoter absolutely requires that the activator be there you're not gonna have any transcription if you don't have the the activator protein there .
and so when you're screening for mutations or when you're looking at +//.
a_lot_of what chapter eleven does is it talks a_lot about the genetics of how do you identify activators how do you identify repressors &-um what kind of mutations are you looking at ?
if you get it through your head that the default state is gonna be you're transcribing or you're not transcribing I think the chapter will make a_lot more sense .
okay ?
it goes through a_lot_o(f) genetic terms .
&-um and I think it's well worthwhile doing .
&-um I should point out that the chapter focuses very very heavily on control of the lac operon I'm I'm specifically not gonna use that as an example because you've had it at least three times in your undergraduate career .
I don't know if you know it so read the sections &-um the pages that you should specifically that I'm specifically not talking about that you should specifically read are two sixty five to two seventy five .
two sixty eight ?
two sixty eight to two seventy five .
it goes in gory detail about lots_o(f) mutations you can make in lac repressors and in operator sequences and in activators and +//.
you should know that by now but certainly read it and make sure you really know it .
okay .
I wanna give you a couple examples of +//.
or an example of an activator an example of a repressor just to make sure that it's clear and then we'll talk about some of the other things that can happen .
&-um one of the reasons why E_Coli does all of this that you need repressors or activators &-um is that you've got a_lot_o(f) genes to control and it's really crucial that you keep the levels appropriate .
you don't need all this control .
&-um if you go to an organism like t@l seven phage t@l seven phage (0.4) its RNA polymerase is one protein .
okay you don't need four proteins it does it in one protein .
but if you're a t@l seven phage you have very few genes you need to turn on .
you don't need to control the level of expression of all of those genes .
if you're a phage and you've invaded into your your host and you wanna make more phage you basically turn on everything .
you might use that temporal expression that we talked about a couple days &~a a couple lectures ago but it doesn't really matter whether you control the level of transcription .
it's more important in controlling .
do you turn them on or not turn them on ?
okay but t@l seven polymerase doesn't need the RNA polymerase doesn't need to have a way to modulate gene expression .
E_Coli does .
okay ?
E_Coli it's really critical .
and when you get into eukaryotes this gets really complicated .
so an RNA polymerase of yeast is gonna have something like eight or ten proteins when you get to higher eukaryotes it even has more .
and the reason you have all these extra proteins is that it's a way of tweaking and modulating transcriptional control .
okay so this is sort_of a E_Coli is is a streamlined version it's a little bit more complicated than phage and it's a_lot less complicated than eukaryotes .
okay so I wanna give just an example of activation because again it comes up in lac control and I think it confuses people sometimes .
and that's how &~sc &~cat &-uh catabolite repression work .
it's actually not repression it's an activation but it's called repression and it's not my fault .
&=writing:board mkay .
okay as you are well aware bacteria needs certain amounts +//.
I mean every living organism needs a certain amount of large macromolecules that they can break down into smaller macromolecules in_order_to live .
&-um we often refer to saying that +//.
we often say that that you need a carbon source when you grow up a bacteria you have to put it on some sort of carbon source .
and bacteria can utilize a_lot_of different kinds of carbon sources but it has preferred carbon sources .
it's easier to break apart glucose than it is to break apart galactose .
it's easier to break apart galactose than to break apart arabinose okay so the cell will preferentially try to use different available high energy sources to break down into macromolecules in a temporal order .
and in_order_to do that it needs to shut off all the genes that are involved in the degradation of the macromolecules it's not degrading .
okay ?
what you wanna do is you want a system that makes all the proteins to degrade glucose until you don't have glucose in the cell .
and then you need a way to turn on all the genes that will express the proteins that can then degrade galactose if galactose is there .
if galactose isn't there then don't turn those on .
okay and that's where catabolite repression comes in .
so catabolites where the name comes from these are just breakdown products .
now it's getting hot &=writing:board okay these are breakdown products &-um from larger molecules .
&=writing:board and the main product that we need to deal with is actually one of the breakdown products is ATP which will then get &~conferte converted to cyclic AMP by adenylate cyclase don't worry about the details it doesn't matter okay ?
but when glucose is high or energy levels are high your ATP levels are gonna be high okay ?
if you've got glucose around by default +//.
you guys remember &~gluconeo or glycolysis and the Krebs cycle and all of that ?
all those ATPs you hadta memorize ?
okay you have a_lot_of ATP molecules when you're living on glucose .
if you start depleting the glucose you're gonna be running out_of ATP and available ATP will get converted into cyclic AMP and this is gonna be when you energy your energy state basically is lower .
and it's signaling to the cell that hey we need to switch carbon sources .
cyclic AMP can bind to a protein so cyclic AMP can bind to an activator +...
that's called CAP .
unfortunately this has two different names .
it's either called CAP or it's called CRP .
I don't like either one of the names .
this is &-um cyclic mm let me make sure (0.4) okay so this stands for catabolite activating protein so at least now we're getting away from this repression name .
okay ?
so this is catabolite activating protein &=writing:board and I think most people in the field are using CAP now +...
but you'll often occasionally find in the literature where it says the &~s cyclic AMP repressor protein .
&=writing:board it doesn't matter .
okay I will call it CAP and then your book calls it CAP .
okay ?
CAP is an activator protein .
but it only works when it's bound to cyclic AMP .
okay ?
so CAP doesn't bind in the absence of cyclic AMP .
where does it bind ?
if this is our gene this is our minus ten minus thirty five it binds to a cis_acting sequence it's a specific DNA sequence that we can call the CAP binding site .
&=writing:board so when CAP binds to cyclic AMP it can then bind to its binding site it actually does so in a dimer we haven't talked about dimers yet .
okay ?
and what CAP does is it helps allow the holoenzyme of RNA polymerase to actually find and sit down on its promoter element .
so what it does is it allows if we write RNA polymerase like this to come in contact with its minus ten minus thirty five .
it basically sets the register okay ?
it turns out that the binding site the minus ten minus thirty five on a_lot_of these genes that are involved in degradation of &-um sugar molecules &-um such as lac operon for instance okay so this could be the lac operon .
in addition to all the repression controls that you know about you can't actually activate expression without having the cyclic AMP CAP protein bind down .
and the mechanism by which it does it is that it makes a physical contact with RNA polymerase .
the particular subunit of RNA polymerase that it binds to are those two alpha subunits okay so CAP cyclic AMP complex binds +...
to the alpha subunit +...
of RNA polymerase +...
and it basically stabilizes the interaction .
it's a little more complicated than that because it turns out +...
that what CAP also does is it bends the DNA +...
so a more accurate representation of what it looks like is that the sigma part of it's gonna touch down on the minus minus ten minus thirty five RNA polymerase then can come down on the promoter and there's a contact between the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase and this other this activator protein .
and so it's a combination of the holding down and tethering RNA polymerase to the right place and a conformational change that occurs in the DNA itself when you bend it .
and one of the common themes of transcriptional control is bending and twisting the DNA .
it happens a_lot .
and it seems to be far more important than people've recognized in the past .
it's not just getting the proteins down it's actually changing the helical pitch of the DNA a little bit .
okay ?
so now when CAP is bound and RNA polymerase holoenzyme is bound you can then get transcription to occur .
okay .
&-um I don't wanna go into more detail about how this works .
&-uh your your text chapter twelve &-um I +//.
the &~f first few pages that I assigned goes into basically explains this talks about different mutations that you can get in CAP and how that's gonna affect transcription .
&-um you should also be aware that you've got these lac i@l repressor binding sites on lac operon &-um we often have repressor binding sites .
&-um I wanna talk about repressor binding just really briefly in the the gal operon only because there's an experiment that I think is pretty cool to introduce you to a concept of dosage dependent effects .
&=pause_while_erasing_board okay .
repression often occurs when a protein binds to a cis_acting sequence and it doesn't let RNA polymerase work .
okay ?
activators often either bring RNA polymerase into place or they tweak the DNA such_that RNA polymerase can function better or they bring in yet another protein <to the> to the DNA binding site &-um repressors often work by excluding RNA polymerase from never binding .
that's not always true but in bacteria it's more often true .
so the +//.
they often bind to +...
to those operators +...
and prevent +...
RNAP binding +...
not always but occasionally .
the promoter region or the operon that I wanna talk about is the gal operon (0.4) and the gal operon is composed of three genes .
it is in an operon so they're &~t gonna be cotranscribed together okay ?
the three genes are gal e@l gal t@l and gal k@l +...
<there is> there is a repressor found somewhere else on the chromosome (0.4) that &~in that's called gal r@l and it makes a protein which we'll just call R that's the repressor .
(0.4) okay .
the repressor then can bind two operator sequences .
the promoter +...
is upstream why don't we just call this P now because that's what your book is going to so instead of writing minus thirty five minus ten I'll just write P .
there're actually two promoters there is p@l one and p@l two .
&~w that would mean that there are two minus tens two minus thirty fives .
this is really common in a_lot_of genes .
what you'll find is that the organism wants to fine tune them so much that there are two different control mechanisms that work independently .
you often find that a gene may have very tight repression and yet may have a very weak promoter that's constitutive .
I actually haven't brought up that word yet .
the word constitutive means that you have a &-um &=writing:board constitutive &-um let's do constitutive expression +...
okay constitutive expression would mean that it's not regulated .
&=writing:board mkay ?
we might as well get into some other terms .
we often refer to expression of a regulated gene as basal expression when it's not being regulated and then we talk about it being either induced or repressed .
so you might see this word come up basal or basal levels of expression +...
and those are when it's not being controlled .
&=writing:board these terms are not mutually exclusive okay &-um you can have a basal level of expression from a constitutive promoter okay what that would tell you is they're telling you the amount of &~la activity that you're getting from something that you never control .
or you can say the basal level of transcription was five molecules five MRNAs per you know per cell .
and when you induced it it's now up to a thousand .
(o)kay ?
does that +//.
<they're they're> they're they're two terms that you can use them together or independent .
if you have a basal level it usually means that you can induce it or or repress it .
you do not induce or repress things that are constitutive .
it's a &~constitu if <it's constitutive> it's constitutive .
you've often seen mutations and repressors that're constitutive mutations .
if the repressor can't bind then you can't regulate it .
and so they call it a constitutive mutation .
okay ?
does this ring a bell if you have a lac i@l C mutation ?
what that would mean is in the repressor for the lac operon you have a mutation that now doesn't allow it to bind anymore .
okay ?
if it doesn't bind then you're just always gonna transcribe the lac operon .
basal just means below the level that you can regulate it then .
&-um basal is sort_of the level that it's it's it's at before you regulate it .
so a basal level of transcription might be &-um again &~i it's a term that's like phenotype .
it's gonna depend upon the state &~tha which you're referring it to .
okay ?
a basal level of transcription for a ribosomal protein when you're in exponential phase is very different than the basal level when the cells are growing very slowly but you can still call them basal because you wanna refer it to something else that happens .
mhm +/.
+, does that make sense ?
okay .
alright where are we ?
oh promoters .
okay so you can often have one promoter that is constitutive and one that's regulated .
&-um and something I also didn't mention that I should mention because it's something that a_lot_of students don't realize is that it's almost impossible to turn a promoter completely off .
there's really no such thing as off okay you can turn it down .
you can turn it down down down to one or two molecules per cell but the cells really can't turn a promoter off .
and so when you're thinking about genes that autoregulate themselves you know &~ho you &~sor it's a chicken and egg question if you think about if if a protein binds a repressor that then comes and represses itself well how do you ever turn it on to begin with ?
well it's because off is not a hundred percent okay there's no such thing as off there is low and then there's on .
okay ?
okay so this happens to have two promoters I'm not gonna talk about the two promoters right now but because they're in your textbook I thought I'd mention them .
it has two operators .
&=writes:board one operator is called OE and it's for operator +...
external +...
to gal e@l .
okay ?
it's it's an operator that's outside of the promoter but it is an operator sequence .
the other operator is actually inside of the gene .
and that's one reason why I'm bringing this up is because I think it's kinda cool .
when when you first start thinking about gene control you think that most of the control hasta be outside of the coding region and that's not true .
especially in eukaryotes .
but it does &+oc happen in prokaryotes as well that some of the control of gene expression happens inside of the coding region okay ?
this one is called OI for inside of gal e@l +...
okay .
these two &-um operators are bound to &-um the gal r@l gene product in a cooperative manner .
and I'm not gonna I'm just gonna tell you what happens &-um +...
(be)cause we need to get somewhere else .
okay so they bind cooperatively and this is really common as well .
so &-um gal r@l binds cooperatively +...
and when it does so it ends up bending the DNA .
&=writing:board you get cooperative binding of the two molecules so the repressors bind to their operator sequences and then they bind to each_other .
so once again we have an example of a regulatory protein that's forming a dimer okay .
and it's dimerizing by interacting with two different operator sequences +...
those of you who know all about lac know that this happens as well okay it &~i you get dimers of lac i@l binding to operators that then bend the DNA and and pull it around in a circle .
the promoters in this case are here and the bending of the DNA basically occludes RNA polymerase from binding and recognizing those sites .
okay ?
so when you have two repressors binding to each of the operators then you don't get transcription to occur .
the other reason I wanted to bring this up is that it matters on what face of the helix that the operators are on .
the distance doesn't matter you could imagine moving this site here and what would happen is you would just get a bigger loop .
&=writing:board mkay ?
this loop would get bigger but as long as you had a loop that occluded RNA polymerase from binding it wouldn't really matter if you moved your operator a little closer or a little farther .
but what would matter is that you can make the bend .
okay ?
that if you flip +//.
if you've got two sites that have to come together and touch each_other and you put one site so it faces in the other direction then it can't touch .
so you have to stay on the same face of the helix for both binding sites okay ?
when they come together .
anyway okay .
so you can mess around with &~dir distances from one operator to another and in this case it doesn't matter whether the operator is found within the gene or not within the gene .
you can actually move it quite a distance .
there is &-um a discussion in your textbook that I'd like you to read &-um I'm not gonna go into it (be)cause I don't think I'm gonna have time and it talks about how do they clone .
how did they find this internal operator okay ?
&=writing:board or how did they know OI was an operator +..?
and the reason I bring this up I don't remember what the figure is I'm sorry I thought I'd get to it .
&-um the experiment that they did is they cloned the gal e@l gene on a plasmid and the observation was that they got expression .
I think what I'll do is I'll just draw the final panel .
they got expression of the gal e@l from the chromosome (0.4) mkay lemme just draw it and the reason I'm bringing this up is because this is an example of a high copy mediated event .
okay ?
in genetics what we do a_lot_of times is we make mutations we look for second site suppressors another way of looking for interacting partners or for molecules that're in the same pathway are to play high copy games .
where you throw a whole lot of copies of something into a cell and that throws off the stoichiometry of the players that are left .
and so this is sort_of an introduction to a high copy mediated effect .
it happens to be dealing with protein binding the DNA but it could be protein don't bind to protein in a different situation .
okay ?
so the observation is after lots_of experimentation if you have an E_Coli cell and this is <the gal> the gal +...
region that's the rest of the chromosome this is gal r@l it's expressed at its normal levels it's gonna make R protein if you introduce into that cell &=writing:board plasmids that contain we'll put both of (th)em OE and OI okay so now this is a plasmid +...
the operator binding sites +...
if you introduce a_lot_o(f) those plasmids okay ?
there will be a normal level of R in the cell but what R is gonna do is instead of binding to the DNA where there's only one copy it'll do that but if you add enough copies somewhere else in the cell all the R is gonna then be titrated out binding to those molecules .
and what happens is you get gene expression very high levels of gene expression when you shouldn't .
okay ?
what you've done is you've titrated +...
the gal r@l protein +...
by adding the gal r@l binding sites &=writing:board which we know we just call OE and OI .
okay ?
this will be a common theme we're gonna mostly talk about it in terms of protein protein interaction but you can imagine if we're doing +//.
looking for some interacting partner you can do the same thing trying to do a protein complex .
(o)kay ?
alright .
it's fudge time .
alright &-um so we've talked a_lot about making the beginning of a transcript we haven't talked about ending transcription .
and I need to just introduce one mechanism in which you can end transcription in_order_to &~u explain attenuation to you .
&=writing:board okay when you reach the end of a gene or an end of an operon okay there's no reason to make more RNA product beyond where you need it .
there're two mechanisms to stop transcription .
the first is rho dependent .
it requires a protein product okay which is called rho and I'm not gonna talk about it I'm going to introduce the concept of rho independent &=writing:board which is the other mechanism that can happen .
basically if you can be transcribing RNA polymerase and you can hit get to a point where you get a stable stem loop structure you can stop RNA polymerase from working .
okay ?
the stable structure is going to in a cartoon form looks something like this .
where this region is very high in G plus C and you get base pairing and &-uh what I wanna do is actually draw out a Terminator sequence for you because I wanna make sure that you understand what direct repeats look like and everything else .
and at the end you have a sequence of u@l-s .
mkay ?
so the transcript continues this direction this is the five prime end this is the thirty prime end when this structure is transcribed the RNA polymerase will stop .
okay ?
so RNA polymerase actually just made this .
and then it falls +//.
it folds into the structure and then that's recognized as a stop and the RNA polymerase'll fall off .
okay that's this rho independent method .
and so it's a structural signature that says please stop now .
&=writing:board okay .
let me draw out a real sequence so that you can see what the direct repeats look like and what this loop region looks like in case this cartoon makes no sense at all .
so in the DNA at the end of the TRP operon way at the very end the sequence coming would be ATT AAA I'm sure this is in your book if you don't wanna write it down +...
four t@l-s &=writing:board okay .
that's the top strand the bottom strand is gonna be exactly the same but it's gonna be &-um complementary .
&=writing:board okay so this is the DNA .
&=writing:board now the DNA is gonna have some inverted repeats and a loop okay if you look at the DNA closely you can see that from here to here is exactly the same as from here to there okay ?
they're &~j they're inverted repeats .
&=writing:board is that clear ?
<AAA GGC> AAA GGC course I forgot a C there so it's not exactly the same now is it ?
G what'd I do ?
anyway GG yeah it is .
okay .
okay so I can't read my own writing .
this region here is gonna be the loop .
okay ?
these will base pair with each_other .
this part and this part so in the RNA molecule these four t@l-s will of_course be used because they're not gonna be t@l-s .
okay ?
if we wanted to put down the rest of them if this was the five prime end we could start staying that this was <C that was a> C that was a T etcetera actually it would be a U sorry .
okay and on this direction it's gonna be the the complementary base pair to those so it would be GGA okay we're just making the stem loop structure .
okay but what's important is that when you make this sort_of stem loop structure that's followed by a bunch of a@l-s or +//.
well in the coding a@l-s but u@l-s the transcription'll stop .
okay ?
this mechanism of termination is used to control gene expression in some cases .
and the example that has been most well studied is the TRP attenuation .
and attenuation in various forms actually shows up it rears its ugly head in a_lot_of eukaryotic systems as well not exactly the same but the similar kind of process so it's worth bringing up .
&-um attenuation of the TRP operon +...
let me give you some facts about the TRP operon .
okay this is not a &{l=SIC degrative@n$adj &}l=SIC thing this is a biosynthetic pathway .
so unlike the lac operon where you wanna chew up lactose and use it as an energy source this is a case in which the cell needs to synthesize tryptophan if there isn't any tryptophan around .
but it costs a_lot_o(f) energy to make tryptophan .
there's actually five structural genes or five enzymes +...
needed to make tryptophan +...
and the cell would prefer not to make tryptophan if it can help it .
the particular structure &-um again these enzymes are in an operon which makes it convenient and so their regulation is all coordinately controlled .
the operon itself &=writing:board looks something like this where you've got TRP e@l D C again you don't need to know the names okay there are five genes we're only gonna talk about a_couple_of (th)em .
and then there's this little open reading frame that I'm just gonna label L for right now .
okay ?
there is an operator +...
so a binding site for a repressor and there is a promoter region upstream of the operator and somewhere else on the chromosome there's a repressor .
&=writing:board the gene is little TRP r@l okay +...
now in the case of TRP r@l TRP r@l doesn't actually work all by itself .
when TRP r@l is empty it's called an aporepressor +...
and it doesn't bind +...
the operator .
there are a_lot_of proteins that bind cofactors and when they're not occupied by their cofactor you call them apo@n .
okay so apo@q is a term you're gonna see a_lot as you go through your studies and it basically just means it's not bound to whatever it is you're talking about .
so an aporepressor is something that isn't bound to something that it needs to be bound to .
in this case what it needs to be bound to is TRP .
tryptophan +...
is necessary for this protein to bind to its operator .
so when these two come together &-uh actually I'll just put it here .
okay when you have a TRP plus the TRP r@l protein product you now have a repressor that functions .
(0.4) mkay .
(0.4) I'll give you the term I won't make you know it .
just in case you get confused tryptophan is called a corepressor .
I think it's a bit confusing because tryptophan is an amino acid and so to think of it as a repressor is a little confusing it it it cannot bind to DNA it doesn't care about DNA all by itself it just happens to be necessary to make the conformational change of the bonafide DNA binding protein in order for it to bind .
but technically it's called a corepressor .
but don't think it can bind DNA by itself .
is cofactor okay in this case to call it ?
&-um it would be if it wasn't a genetic term .
&-um &~th this is &~y you're well immersed in fifty years of genetics terminology and so you cannot call tryptophan a cofactor in this case .
had you done these studies in the nineteen nineties you'd probably call it a cofactor .
&-um &=laughs:S8 I don't know how else to explain it .
there will always be certain genetic terms that this will always be a corepressor it's the way it was defined it was the &~w it was genetically defined first &-um and it it probably is a cofactor but if you ever said that to Charlie Yanofsky the the god of tryptophan regulation he'd kill you &=laughs:multiple so best not to &-um anyway but yeah it's a cofactor .
it it's needed for the function of this other thing .
&-um okay .
&-uh alright .
so tryptophan synthesis levels of tryptophan are important for control of the TRP operon .
when levels are high it binds to <the repressor> the repressor then binds to the operator and you don't make any of these genes .
or these gene products .
great .
you keep the gene products down you don't try to make tryptophan .
when you get in a a situation where your tryptophan levels go down then you +//.
the tryptophan'll fall off the repressor because you're gonna need that to make amino &~a to make polypeptides .
okay the repressor falls off and then you can start making the genes to make the gene products to make more tryptophan .
okay ?
that's great and that controls a_lot_o(f) the regulation .
that'll keep down the level of transcription down to about ten percent of what it would be if you didn't have the tryptophan marker .
or the tryptophan repressor on .
but it's far more complicated than that because life is .
alright .
there's a second level of regulation .
so the first level +...
is repressor binding .
&=writing:board and the second level is attenuation .
and if you just think about attenuation as making a termination it's easier .
okay ?
all attenuation is is making a termination making a rho independent &=writing:board termination +...
either occur or not occur .
okay ?
if you can control +//.
so normally when the repressor falls off lemme make the repressor off .
you're now gonna try and transcribe this message .
I'm gonna put it on the bottom +...
if you could stop transcription from happening okay ?
then you can control gene expression .
you're not controlling it at the level of transcription of initiation but you're controlling it at the level of finishing transcription .
okay ?
and that's what happens .
there is a specific termination &=writing:board that occurs before you get into TRP e@l .
okay ?
and it depends upon the level of tryptophan .
okay ?
so there's a termination that depends on TRP levels .
okay so once again the phenomenon's gonna be when TRP levels are high you're never even gonna make full length &~m MRNA .
okay ?
so this'll happen when TRP levels are low and when TRP levels are high you're just gonna make a bunch of these (0.4) so now I'm going to attempt to draw cartoons again and I know how much you love it when I do this .
&=laughs:multiple &=erasing_board okay oh alright lemme keep that up there .
okay .
what's going to happen is during transcription you're either gonna make one of these or you're not .
confused ?
is this a hand is this you're ⌈ hot ⌉ ?
⌊ no ⌋ this &~i this is the resting the arm .
okay .
&=pause_while_erasing_board ⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ but wait ⌋ actually I am a little bit confused ⌈ over ⌉ +/.
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, on on just the attenuation part about the TRP again the Terminator right there +/.
+, uhuh +/.
+, the very last stuff that you added just +/.
+, ⌈ okay ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ could ⌋ you just repeat it a little ?
okay it's sure I'll repeat it &=laughs:S4 it's gonna be easier when I show you what we do first .
okay +/.
+, but the bottom line is you'll make a &~sma a short transcript of a +/.
+, (o)kay +/.
+, hundred and sixty two nucleotides where the TRP levels are high +/.
+, okay +/.
+, and you'll transcribe the entire operon that's several KBs when the levels are low .
+, oh ⌈ what if ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and what ⌋ I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna blow up this little region here and +/.
+, okay +/.
+, hopefully explain it clearly +/.
+, &=laughs okay +/.
+, it is my goal .
okay .
lemme tell you a little bit about this little thing I labeled &=writes:board L first .
L stands for leader okay ?
the leader sequence has three features that you should know about .
and I'm gonna list them first and then I will draw them okay the leader sequence actually encodes a product .
it &~enco I drew it as a box so it's gonna encode a fourteen amino acid polypeptide +...
it's a very small protein .
okay ?
and this is gonna be one of these cases where the function of the polypeptide is in completely just in regulated gene expression .
it actually doesn't have a fate in life other than controlling the transcription .
okay and this happens occasionally .
you don't always make gene products for them to actually go on and do something that +//.
other than controlling some function .
okay within the polypeptide there are two adjacent tryptophan &=writing:board codons .
or well codons within the sequence and there'll be amino acids within the protein .
okay ?
tryptophan is a relatively rare amino acid .
and so when you're translating an RNA and you have to put a tryptophan in you have to find the TRNA that's charged with tryptophan to sit down in the ribosome in_order_to get translation .
having two in a row is pretty rare .
okay ?
but this particular one has two in a row .
and finally the RNA has four segments +...
that can form stem loops &=writing:board okay and these are just labeled one two three four .
I think the easiest thing to do is just draw you a cartoon of what a free RNA molecule would look like .
if you were to take this hundred and sixty two nucleotide sequence and you just synthesize it synthetically and ask what is the structure of this molecule what it will look like +...
is it'll come in we're not drawing all of it &=writing:board and it'll look something like this .
the end of it has a series of u@l-s as drawn .
it actually has seven u@l-s .
&=writing:board this particular arm is base paired with this arm okay so we're gonna put &=drawing_on_board making a stem loop structure .
this is the free RNA .
this these two are base paired with each_other +...
we call this strand one this part is two this one is three and this one is four so that's what these four segments are just these linear sequences that can base pair .
the amino acid sequence that starts up here the two tryptophans are in this region okay so these are the two tryptophans .
&=writing:board and then about here is your stop of translation .
&=writing:board the where translation stops this is typical .
this would be your thirty prime UTR okay I haven't drawn the rest of your coding region or your five prime UTR alright so the free RNA can fold like this .
well what happens when translation is happening ?
well we have two options .
we can either translate when we have low tryptophan concentrations or we can translate when we have high tryptophan concentrations +...
there is a correlation between the number of TRNAs that're charged with the tryptophan with its tryptophan concentration .
okay ?
so when you have low tryptophan concentrations what will happen is &=writing:board your ribosome which is now here +...
will stall .
your ribosome +//.
okay &-uh we didn't +//.
I don't know that we've mentioned this .
in prokaryotes transcription and translation are coupled .
okay ?
transcription happens and right after you start making that five prime RNA the ribosome will hop on and it'll just follow .
so RNA polymerase is doing its thing over here .
the ribosome's following right after .
okay ?
but if that ribosome stalls on those codons for tryptophan RNA polymerase will actually start making more of the structure .
this ribosome protects segment one from binding to segment two .
what I didn't tell you is that segment two and segment three can base pair .
okay ?
they're complementary to each_other .
so segment one is busy being bound up by the ribosome RNA polymerase made two three and actually four but before it makes four these two can base pair +...
okay ?
and if they base pair you never make one of those okay remember our termination sequence is high GC rich base pairing followed by a stretch of u@l-s .
this stretch of u@l-s is you know &~fif forty nucleotides past where this stem loop structure is .
so what happens is if it stalls you get translation to happen or you get &-um transcription continues .
so &=writing:board okay ?
so now what happens if it doesn't stall ?
well if it doesn't stall the RNA polymerase and the ribosome are much closer to each_other .
okay ?
and so what will happen is the ribosome won't be here it'll be down here when RNA polymerase gets to the end .
so what'll happen is neither one nor two will be able to base pair .
it's gonna look something more similar to this actually wait .
do this instead .
&=writing:board okay ?
if the ribosome's sitting here even though these two could've base paired they didn't .
because RNA +//.
what the ribosome sort_of broke this apart and continued up .
segment two and segment three don't base pair because you've got this big ribosome in the way .
so instead RNA polymerase which is now &~s RNA polymerase'll stop after the series of u@l-s because it will recognize the binding of three and four as a termination sequence .
so this is when you have high TRP levels .
you go past the TRP codons without a problem .
and so the the ribosome will basically be following RNA polymerase two can't bind with three but then three can bind with four because of the distance .
your book goes into this in very good detail .
I will make sure on the study guide that I draw a cartoon of it so that you can see what my interpretations of the cartoons I'll make sure that on the study guide there is for sure questions at the cartoon level that I might ask types of questions on the exam in case these cartoons don't make any sense .
look back in your intro genetics book .
those of you who had molecular biology I'm sure it's there I'm sure it's in your textbook for this course you just may not have gotten to it .
(o)kay ?
thank you .
(0.7) did did that clear it up ?

⌊ so ⌋ you said you had something right after this ?
I gotta go to that seminar .
which seminar ?
the one <over at> the biochemistry seminar .
whose ?
&-um I don't know .
the fly guy ?
yeah +/.
+, oh he's giving a seminar ?
+, yeah I gotta go +/.
+, &-um (be)cause four days Mikhail and I were gonna meet and talk about what we should do .
I know four days I'm absolutely freaked out about this .
can we meet tomorrow at some point ?
⌈ although ⌉ +/.
⌊ yeah <what time> ⌋ ?
+, guess what time I don't have available so I have a meeting &~t I am on so many stupid committees .
&-um I've got a meeting tomorrow from one to probably three I've got appointments from I mean I've got some time right at nine but I don't know if we can get Mikhail awake at nine .
yeah I'm in by seven .
so .
so I wonder if we can get him to meet us at meet us at nine I don't think I have my first appointment (un)til ten or ten thirty .
okay ⌈ &-uh ⌉ +/.

yeah but I really hafta go to that seminar .
alright +...
so the exam is next Thursday ?
yeah .
okay .
that's better .
okay .
+, (be)cause I'm leaving again &=laughs +/.
+, oh okay .
+, &-um are are the exams from last time graded ?
yeah and if you come upstairs I'll give it to you and there's somebody else that wanted (th)em too .
yeah I forgot to bring (th)em .
okay +/.
+, so we'll go get (th)em .
I was just gonna ask you one more little thing +/.
