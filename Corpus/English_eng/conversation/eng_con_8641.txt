it's a nice day round the corner .
the tea's ready (be)cause you've got to sit up .
I blowed my kite .
I('m) going to drink it now .
0is that mine ?
I('m) sitting on here .
I('m) very hot .
I(ve) got a school bag .
I'll tidy it .
when I get up I can have make+up on ?
I like the swings , the roundabout and the seesaw .
she might be not coming .
oo it dropped the lid .
they had girls on .
don't forget teddy .
I'll choose them to everybody .
I didn't do it .
you play it with me .
the wind 0has come out hasn't it ?
keep it to not fall any further
