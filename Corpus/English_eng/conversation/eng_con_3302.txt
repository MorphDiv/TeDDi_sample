I got to remember, I'm writing a petition . 30_4290
second hour should be xxx .
okay . 4290_15990
the bells are kind of messed up so we will I will probably just go ahead and dismiss you .
because they didn't get the bells working right . 15990_16070
all right, who is absent ? 16070_19280
anybody ?
I don't know . 19280_21050
you don't know ? 21050_25160
do you know who sits at your table normally ?
he's missing . 25160_26020
who is he ?
devin is not here . 27170_28130
no . 28130_29020
he's here .
devin is gone . 29020_30000
he's here . 30000_31000
right . 31000_35290
he's here .
yeah, a table of three people, not the one that's got four . 41110_46250
all right, so nobody is absent ? 46250_49280
everybody is here ?
yeah . 49280_52280
okay . 52280_57270
um, I'm not going to return your papers today . 57270_66260
i'll save that for tomorrow .
we'll get right into what we're going to be talking about today .
there's just a couple of things that I needed to go over with you first that I'm not sure that you got it before . 66260_76270
yes ? 76270_84080
writing your homework books ?
okay .
all right . 84080_88290
open up your book .
what ?
I can't hear out of my ear . 88290_90190
what's wrong ? 90190_91260
it hurts . 91260_93230
did you ever go to the doctor ? 93230_95100
yeah . 95100_96010
miss a, xxx . 96010_97030
what ? 97030_98010
xxx . 98010_99090
okay . 99090_108280
take these right here .
go .
bye .
they must feel like they have the plague or something .
all right . 108280_110010
you ready ?
yeah . 110010_111000
okay . 111000_114120
on page open your book to page five eighty eighty .
there are some weather maps . 123270_128270
there's actually four weather maps on those pages that are in front of you .
they are showing a progression of weather over a four+day period ? 128270_139260
three+day period, okay .
where the weather is going .
okay ? 151010_160230
find the cold fronts and the warm fronts . 184250_190040
okay, now here's a puzzle for you . 190040_198230
what do you notice about fronts and pressure centers ?
what do you notice about the fronts and the high pressure; and the fronts and the low pressure ? 198230_204260
look and you gotta look at the map in order to answer the question . 204260_209250
and if you can't figure it out with one map, move to another map . 209250_215270
make some comparisons . 215270_218150
what pattern do you notice about fronts and pressure centers ? 218150_233140
I have a question . 233140_234290
mm . 234290_238230
no no, no .
I'm waiting .
I have a question . 238230_239130
oh . 239130_240280
question ?
okay .
aren't the pointed ones the warm fronts ? 240280_243110
the pointed ones are the cold fronts . 243110_245250
okay . 245250_250260
I was just making sure .
I thought you were gonna answer the question . 250260_262120
I am waiting for some people to get that look on their face, like, +"/.
+" oh Stuart, are you noticing anything ? 262120_268020
is there something you're noticing about the high pressure centers that is not the same as the low pressure centers ? 268020_281060
besides the besides the points ? 281060_284160
besides the what ? 284160_285120
what about the points ? 286220_288160
there's no triangles where ? 291090_293030
no . 293030_294080
oh . 294080_295020
than there's xxx . 295020_297170
oh . 297170_300080
okay .
so there's more cold fronts than warm fronts ?
yeah . 300080_300170
okay, but what about the low pressure centers and what about the high pressure centers ? 300170_315000
mitch, what do you think ? 315000_316230
I think that there's low pressure centers on the cold fronts and the warm fronts too . 316230_323060
and what about the high pressure centers ? 323060_325280
they are moving away from the front . 325280_328060
they don't seem to have fronts attached to them, do they ? 328060_332110
no . 332110_333000
you notice that, jeff ? 333000_334020
uh+huh . 334020_335000
look at all the low pressure centers . 335000_339190
do you see fronts attached to them ?
no . 339190_349010
can you tell me why ?
remember the balloon thing ?
can you tell me why ?
jeff, what do you think ?
uh, when it hits the hot air, it would like go above it . 349010_356110
so you got a warm air mass and a cold air mass ? 356110_358290
yes . 358290_365260
and when it hits I remember, but I remember it, but it's hard to explain .
okay . 365260_369050
you're saying the warm air rises above that cold air ?
yes . 369050_370000
okay . 370000_371060
and the warm air has what kind of pressure ? 374270_378240
low pressure . 378240_379020
okay . 379020_381090
mark, did you have something to add ?
no . 381090_384020
I was gonna say xxx .
okay . 384020_394110
let me show you a real easy way to really kind of understand it .
I have three balloons this time, and they are different color .
red is ?
cold . 394110_395000
warm . 395000_396000
warm air . 396000_397050
blue is ?
cold . 397050_398000
cold, and yellow is ? 398000_399110
warm . 399110_400010
is cooler . 400010_407010
let's say cooler .
all right .
let's look up here for a second .
and you'll even notice on this map there aren't any fronts attached to those low pressure centers, right ? 407010_412220
just or to the high pressure centers . 412220_416290
just to the low pressure centers, right ?
uh+huh . 416290_417140
okay . 417140_423160
so where would the red balloon go ?
if this is the what kind of front ?
cold . 423160_424010
cold front . 424010_425000
then where's the warm air going to be ? 425000_427080
going behind it . 427080_428270
behind it ? 428270_432120
this is the front of a warm air mass ?
uh, no . 432120_433250
it's gonna be in front of it .
it's gonna be in front of it ? 433250_434270
yeah . 434270_435160
okay . 435160_437020
where's the cold air gonna be ?
behind it . 437020_438020
behind it . 438020_445230
and we'll put the yellow air up here, okay ?
this is where the low pressure center happens .
watch what happens .
here's the warm air . 445230_451270
here's the cold air .
here's the cool air .
you see the hole in between the three ?
yeah . 451270_452180
there's your low pressure center . 452180_462130
that's the low . 462130_465000
see ?
yeah .
yeah . 465000_466010
ah . 466010_473150
okay ?
that's what you're looking at .
you're looking at that bubble of warm air, the bubble of cold air behind .
here's the front right here, right ? 473150_477220
the front of the air mass, yes ?
and then where they all meet up where these bubbles of air meet up, that's where that low pressure center comes in . 477220_484020
the high pressure is going to be this big bubble of cold air at the very highest point of it as far as pressure goes . 484020_494260
it's not gonna ever have a front because it occurs in like the middle of the air mass, okay ? 494260_500280
okay . 500280_501220
get it ? 501220_502050
yeah . 502050_503000
ooh . 503000_504020
yes ?
so then basically a tornado would be caused because of low pressure in the xxx ? 504020_510250
yes . 510250_519100
that depression of low pressure air, right .
it's really cool because it shows the air funneling like this on the ground . 523220_531090
what's that called ?
convection current . 532020_533000
right . 533000_543140
uh+huh . 548080_549030
cold air hits the red and the warm air goes flying up ? 549030_553250
that's what causes the storm ?
what it shows is that that tube gets split and splits up this way, and that's the beginning of a funnel cloud . 553250_562070
it's very cool .
but you'll see that on the, uh, video . 562070_568080
okay .
yeah . 568080_569000
yeah . 569000_570000
okay ? 570000_571000
kind of a visual .
uh+huh . 571000_572000
okay . 572000_576130
the reason you need to know that is because this is what you are going to be doing .
first hour did not even finish the cities on their map which was kind of disappointing . 576130_584180
I thought they'd get further than that .
you do not need and I won't let you use your book or your notes . 584180_592260
+" no, I think that you need to get that station model plugged into your head a little better than you have it . 592260_598000
okay ? 598000_613020
so you don't need any of that .
you may use the map on page seven sevety, I think .
check page seven seventy in your book .
there should be, yep, a map of the united states . 613020_621010
you also have a map like this at your table with all of the cities on it .
oh . 621010_623100
they don't have one down there .
hannah, would would you take that map down to the office and ask them to give it to the kids inside the conference room ? 623100_632210
okay . 632210_633020
okay ? 633020_640270
I think they brought the map back from &~their and then tell them to leave it there .
leave the pencils and the map, okay ?
all right, so you've got enough reference for finding certain cities . 640270_648230
you're going to get a list of twelve cities in the united states .
oh, that stays on; this goes off . 648230_649230
a list of twelve cities in the united states, with some other data . 649230_656280
I told you this last week .
and you're going to get a blank map that handing out ? 656280_662290
okay . 663150_666050
handing out ?
here . 666050_667010
yeah . 667010_668240
dorothy .
I want to let dorothy do it, because she threw her hand out there first . 668240_674070
I didn't think she wanted to get up, but she does .
okay . 674070_679210
you're gonna get a sheet like this, that has all of the instructions that you need on it .
any notes, any . 685230_705290
you can only have your book open at page seven seventy .
okay . 705290_715270
on the blue sheet is a list of the twelve cities, around the country .
most of you have probably never heard of it . 722110_727290
you will, though, by the time we get done with oceans .
it is in north carolina . 727290_733230
north carolina .
I'm not gonna show you where that is; you ought to know where north carolina is . 733230_737100
and, uh, kansas city . 737100_746280
there are two big kansas cities .
we're talking about thank you kansas city, missouri .
okay ?
so you might wanna write “mo” after kansas city, just so you remember where it's from . 746280_759250
all right, who wants to read the directions ? 759250_764100
I'm gonna stop you a lot as you go through, and explain certain things .
mark, go ahead . 764100_765240
+" locate and label each of the above cities on the attachment . 765240_769270
okay . 769270_775250
the first thing you're going to do is find the cities, one at the time .
detroit, okay ?
when you find it on the map, you're gonna put the little dot where detroit goes . 775250_782240
then you're gonna write “Detroit” but you've got to write small, and you've got to write neat, so that I can read it . 782240_789240
stuart, you haven't started yet, have you ? 789240_790290
no . 790290_791280
don't, because I I've got to tell you the whole thing . 791280_795180
remember where detroit goes on a station a weather station model, right ? 795180_802270
many of you forgot to put “weather city” when you had to redo another station model on that worksheet . 802270_808060
lots of people did not put that city name . 808060_813240
they put all the other stuff but didn't put the city .
so when you write “Detroit” to the left of it make your circle right away and start building that station model . 813240_823070
otherwise, if you go through and write all the cities first, then you're gonna have to go back and make sure you've got room to put the station model . 823070_831010
so do one city at a time, okay ? 831010_834280
do you know what I'm saying ?
uh+huh . 834280_835000
you got it ? 835000_836130
yes ?
xxx ? 836130_837260
like this . 837260_840130
i'll just start this first one just so you know .
if you have got this part of michigan right here, and you put the dot, you need to write “Detroit” over here, okay ? 840130_851010
and then start your station model right here . 851010_855120
all right ? 855120_862140
a reminder that the wind direction is that arrow to the middle .
all right ? 862140_872020
and I'm trying to think what else they had trouble with .
they had a little trouble last hour with cloud coverage in the circle .
if you're not sure, ask someone at your table first before I come around to help you with that . 872020_878280
or somebody else you've asked somebody else before you ask me, okay ? 878280_883080
because you had the twenty five percent, you had the fifty percent, and you had the seventy five percent then you had full coverage . 883080_888260
remember what those meant because that's how they are on this sheet, okay ? 888260_899070
okay .
so there's your any questions on the station model ?
you know where everything goes on there ? 899070_904270
there are only two cities with current conditions, and i'll put the symbols on the board .
they're very simple, okay ? 904270_912260
so you don't need that chart either .
okay .
next one .
mark, keep going .
+" construct a weather station map for each of the above cities . 912260_918270
place them at approximate locations .
appropriate locations . 918270_920250
oh . 920250_921030
yep . 921030_928130
all right .
now, that's as far as everybody got for second hour, okay ?
go ahead and read on, mark .
place high and low pressure centers where you think that where you think they would be located on the map . 928130_934120
you're gonna have to look at what in order to do that ? 934120_942240
what's some indicators of high and low pressure ?
oh, no . 942240_949200
you know what we thought of last hour ?
don't do this one .
put an arrow, four, five, and five to four .
do step five first . 949200_956080
it'll make four a lot easier .
or three and four .
I'm sorry .
I'm sorry .
wait, wait, wait .
do step four first and then go back up and do step three . 956080_966100
read step four, mark, so I can explain what I mean there .
shade regions of precipitation . 966100_976000
place symbol for cold and warm fronts where they would most most likely be located on the map .
okay . 976000_979220
do you see why I said to do this one first ?
uh+huh . 979220_980010
it should be a lot easier to put the low pressure and high pressure centers, right ? 985200_990250
okay .
so do number four first and then go back and do number three . 990250_999200
if it's light rain, it's a light green; if it's medium rain, if they just say rain, then it's a yellow; and if it's a thunderstorm, then it's red . 999200_1009270
that's how the doppler radar satellite picture picks it up, okay ? 1009270_1017180
it's the density of the air is what they pick up, all right ?
okay . 1017180_1019100
go ahead, mark .
answer the following questions . 1019100_1025090
interpret the data using your map weather .
explain the locations of high and low pressure centers in warm and cool fronts . 1025090_1031280
are there any environmental or severe weather incidents that may occur ? 1031280_1040260
include the weather indications in the map .
use your weather map to explain the above answer . 1040260_1044230
okay . 1044230_1050090
where now you have to explain why you put everything on your map where you put it, okay ? 1050090_1056180
so you're kind of explaining yourself: low pressure, high pressure . 1056180_1062290
and hopefully you'll be able to do that .
I think you can, if you allow yourself to think in that direction . 1062290_1070010
okay, and then six .
okay . 1078260_1086290
are there any questions about what I expect you to do ?
no ?
so I will be able to just sit here the whole time you're doing this and just watch you like last hour ? 1086290_1095030
todd ?
I don't get “shade regions of precipitation” . 1095030_1099230
okay . 1099230_1106270
on the map that you had to do for the weather station models, they told you to shade the areas of precipitation .
the same way that this map did you see how they shaded these areas ? 1106270_1114150
where it's raining .
and once you get done with all your station models, you'll be able to see it better . 1114150_1117080
you'll look for the cloudy areas, and then from that you'll look for the rainy areas . 1117080_1120210
now I know, I just I thought you meant to do four completely first . 1120210_1126000
no . 1126000_1130260
no .
well, yeah .
you're gonna do four first before you do three .
oh, no . 1131290_1134250
not before two though, right .
okay .
got ya .
jeff ? 1134250_1135210
you work as a group, yes . 1136250_1137270
okay . 1137270_1138160
which means talking quietly about the mapping activity, not about what you did over the weekend, okay ? 1138160_1147000
yes, wes ? 1147000_1148000
I'm really not sure about these, uh, models we have to put down . 1148000_1153150
okay . 1153150_1154000
I don't quite understand them . 1154000_1155270
did you do that worksheet last week ? 1155270_1157180
which one ? 1157180_1158080
the one that you were supposed to turn in for a grade on friday . 1158080_1161190
I'm not sure . 1161190_1162190
you had “weather city” and then “around the circle” which had cloudiness in it . 1162190_1170100
I don't remember anything like that . 1170100_1174010
I remember most of last week .
all right, I'm not sure you turned it in . 1174010_1176080
I'm not sure either . 1176080_1177250
okay . 1177250_1181190
we'll see what your group can help you with .
okay . 1181190_1183150
jeff ? 1183150_1184000
sure . 1187080_1189210
mark ?
like go through and write all the cities and then go and do the weather stations, or do the city and then the weather station ? 1192290_1198070
somebody want to answer mark's question ? 1198070_1201000
do the weather the city and the weather station together . 1201000_1203160
okay . 1203160_1205190
and you won't be able to fit the weather station around it . 1212020_1215190
hannah ?
okay . 1215190_1221230
what do we do for, like, the current conditions ?
okay . 1221230_1228280
there are only two .
thanks for that .
there are only two .
let me pull this up .
they call it on those dir and that's actual data information from last wednesday, the twenty third, straight off the weather channel . 1228280_1237250
when you're all done, I'm going to give you the actual satellite map with the warm fronts and cold fronts and high and low pressures . 1237250_1244230
you're gonna compare that to what you came up with on your map . 1244230_1253220
I'm looking at probably wednesday by the time we get to that .
then you're you're gonna forecast at the bottom . 1253220_1257270
your last step is gonna be a forecast .
then you're gonna look at what happened the next day and see how well your forecast came out, okay ? 1257270_1262290
uh, but on the weather channel, instead of calling it intermittent rain, they call it light rain . 1262290_1271230
so this is the symbol for light rain .
I know it's tough, and I don't know if you're gonna be able to remember it, but that's light rain, okay ? 1271230_1278250
there are no thunderstorms, none of that, all the fancy stuff they had on that chart . 1278250_1284220
and guess what this is ?
snow . 1284220_1285040
light snow . 1285040_1287110
if it were heavy snow, there would be two of them . 1287110_1295190
oops .
okay ?
any other questions ? 1295190_1299120
yes, wes ?
so if it was heavy rain, there would be two little footnotes ? 1299120_1302140
two dots, yep . 1302140_1305260
yep .
can I have a pencil ? 1305260_1308070
I only brought a pen .
yeah . 1308070_1314290
if you need a pencil, let me know .
don't try to do this in pen .
it's too too much erasing going on .
yes, mitch ? 1314290_1317080
question ?
when we shade these, what colors did they do you want us to have them ? 1317080_1321180
I have a box of pencils right up colored pencils . 1321180_1329270
I did .
right up here .
whatever color you want except red or blue .
oops . 1329270_1332190
you needed this .
whatever color you want except red or blue, okay ? 1332190_1341270
all right .
if there are no more questions, get started .
I'm gonna put this away so I don't trip on it . 1341270_1349080
yes ? 1349080_1350080
I need a pencil . 1350080_1351130
okay . 1351130_1357090
go back over there and get one from where I got it, top that little top drawer .
mark, did you have a question ?
I don't like sitting next to a wall . 1357090_1359060
why ? 1360270_1361260
on the wall ? 1364230_1368120
do you want me to move you up here ?
no, that's all right . 1368120_1369010
oh . 1369010_1371120
I thought so .
christina ?
can I sharpen my pencil ? 1371120_1372160
yes, you may sharpen your pencil . 1372160_1374140
can I sharpen my pencil, too ? 1374140_1376290
yeah . 1376290_1386250
you guys are supposed to do this beforehand .
okay . 1386250_1391240
let's see if I can talk you through this .
you wrote +"/.
+" the city of detroit .
and then there was a circle next to it so just draw a circle, a relatively large circle . 1391240_1400080
okay . 1400080_1401290
now no .
don't fill it in .
just a circle .
oh . 1401290_1403170
and I just said +"/.
+" use a pencil . 1403170_1405080
+" is that a pencil ?
yes . 1405080_1406000
oh . 1406000_1417020
that's a cool pencil .
okay .
an open circle .
now, in the circle you have four choices .
these are your choices: mostly sunny no . 1417020_1429220
clear, mostly sunny, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, cloudy .
that's it .
five of them .
okay ?
that would be cloudy, wouldn't it ? 1429220_1430260
and they are it's saying cloudy . 1430260_1437030
and they are represented by how much you shade that circle .
so that would be about fifty percent probably ? 1437030_1438290
actually, cloudy is gonna be all shaded . 1438290_1441260
okay . 1441260_1442010
okay ? 1442010_1444150
and let me see your pencil for a minute, and i'll draw them on the back so you can all right . 1444150_1449040
this one is totally unshaded so that's going to be what ? 1449040_1454090
uh, sunny . 1454090_1455090
clear . 1455090_1460290
yeah .
sunny or clear .
this one is gonna be a quarter shaded .
this one is gonna be let's do them all first and then you can compare . 1460290_1469190
this one is gonna be this way .
and that one is gonna be completely and you know this one's cloudy and this one's clear . 1469190_1473270
okay ? 1473270_1481280
so now your other options are mostly cloudy, mostly sunny or partly cloudy .
okay . 1481280_1493220
so that would be sunny, partly that would be sunny, that would be partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, right ?
no .
no .
okay . 1493220_1494080
oh, boy . 1494080_1495000
that's all right . 1495000_1501290
relax .
if that's clear, then this is like mostly clear or mostly ?
mostly clear . 1501290_1503270
mostly clear or mostly ? 1503270_1508250
mostly sunny . 1508250_1509120
okay . 1509120_1517230
this one is mostly sunny .
now you've got mostly cloudy and partly cloudy and these two left .
which one's mostly cloudy and which one's partly cloudy ? 1517230_1522160
what's that one ?
mostly cloudy . 1522160_1523230
what's that one ? 1523230_1524070
partly cloudy . 1524070_1525120
okay . 1525120_1527150
sunny, clear . 1527150_1529090
yeah . 1529090_1530240
sunny or clear .
mostly sunny, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, cloudy . 1530240_1536010
beautiful . 1536010_1537010
detroit was easy, but you're gonna get to some other ones that okay ? 1537010_1542180
all right, now, the next thing that you have to figure out is where the temperature goes and where the dew point goes . 1542180_1547290
you guys, you have humidity information . 1547290_1553150
does it go on the weather station model anywhere ?
no . 1553150_1555120
no . 1555120_1556020
no . 1556020_1558200
we didn't put humidity on there, did we ?
well, just you don't need it right now . 1560000_1566010
you'll need it to answer some questions, but you don't need it on the weather station model .
mark ?
for detroit how is eight mile an &~hour you got us around ten . 1566010_1569250
eight+mile+an+hour wind I told you last week, your choice . 1569250_1577030
it's either a five you listening, geoffrey ?
eight+mile+an+hour wind is either a five or a ten . 1577030_1581010
your choice .
if you show me three long lines there, I'm gonna know you didn't know what you were doing, okay ? 1581010_1588260
all right .
do you remember where temperature went ? 1588260_1595150
right above it . 1595150_1596010
yeah . 1596010_1604020
right above it to the left .
okay . 1604020_1607200
and then dew point went ?
upper right a bit ? 1607200_1609280
below left . 1609280_1616290
okay ? 1616290_1623180
you've got the city there .
do you remember what goes above the city on this thing ?
the pressure ? 1623180_1624080
yep . 1624080_1625120
then we do write on the left . 1625120_1629290
pressure is on the left . 1629290_1634150
when you do the pressure, make sure you show falling, steady or rising, either with the letters or the arrows . 1634150_1640160
rising would be just shooting straight across, a horizontal line . 1640160_1647270
okay . 1647270_1654290
so, now, if you're not doing humidity, the only thing you have left is wind speed and direction .
do you remember how that was represented ?
um, by an arrow . 1654290_1656270
huh ? 1656270_1657100
by an arrow . 1657100_1658020
an arrow that's shooting into the circle . 1658020_1660160
right . 1660160_1661290
north . 1662070_1665070
in this area down here ?
that way ?
that's northwest . 1665070_1666020
you're thinking of, like, las vegas and nevada . 1666020_1667030
yeah . 1667030_1670260
if you have trouble remembering your directions, make a little compass rose at the top of your map . 1670260_1676200
ah . 1676200_1677030
ah . 1677030_1685050
let's see if I find the state . 1685050_1687170
do we do that xxx ? 1687170_1689180
no . 1689180_1695270
okay . 1697250_1698000
no . 1698000_1699180
I didn't do any of that .
okay . 1699180_1700170
where is hatteras ? 1700170_1701080
can I see the map when you're done, hannah ? 1701080_1704260
what state is it in ? 1704260_1707100
you can tell her, jennifer . 1707100_1709050
I don't know . 1709050_1710010
oh, you guys, I told you where it was . 1710010_1712030
I I remember it . 1712030_1713040
if you remember, then you can tell me . 1714010_1717160
I remember her telling us . 1717160_1719250
I just don't remember where .
I remember her talking about it . 1719250_1721180
this is a . 1721180_1724290
yes . 1726250_1730180
in your on your map in your book it says cape hatteras, right .
okay . 1730180_1731060
it's in the book .
oh, that helps . 1731060_1732050
oh, that hurt . 1732050_1733000
it's not on your plastic map . 1733000_1734280
oh . 1734280_1735040
it's not ?
does that help ? 1735040_1736020
no . 1736020_1737000
I don't think it is . 1737000_1738010
it might be .
it's north carolina . 1738010_1741250
nope . 1741250_1743180
it's not on your plastic map .
it's out in the ocean . 1743180_1745130
well, no . 1745130_1747290
the name is out in the ocean .
the little dot is actually on land .
there's no dot . 1747290_1748220
there's no dot . 1748220_1749270
it's just out in the middle of the ocean . 1749270_1756010
you're right . 1756010_1761200
there is no dot .
hmm .
I'm looking in the wrong place anyways .
where's new york in new york ? 1761200_1763250
it's not on this map .
it's on the very corner, like, if you go that way, let's say go to b, it's on the very bottom . 1763250_1765230
new york is on here . 1765230_1767200
it's just very hard to find .
all right . 1767200_1768220
on this one ?
mm+hm . 1768220_1770260
here's the state .
right . 1770260_1771180
oh .
there it is .
here's the city right there . 1771180_1772260
yeah .
I'm stupid . 1772260_1774040
you're not stupid . 1774040_1778070
it's just buried on an island .
“partly” is fifty . 1779010_1782020
partly is fifty .
fifty .
partly is fifty . 1782020_1785170
partly is fifty, Mitch .
okay . 1785170_1786000
“mostly” is seventy five xxx very cloudy . 1786000_1788120
you haven't finished the detroit station weather model yet . 1788120_1792130
shouldn't you finish that ? 1792130_1794260
before you start one ?
I mean, that's what I would do . 1794260_1804190
I guess you can do it any way you want, but I guess everybody else is doing it that way, too .
remember to keep your handwriting very small and really nice and neat, those of you that struggle with neat . 1804190_1815220
really nice and neat .
that good ? 1815220_1817000
there's a river . 1817000_1818120
yes . 1818120_1819160
miss a, there's a river through it, but there is no little dot for it . 1819160_1826180
how about on the plastic map ? 1826180_1830280
plastic map . 1830280_1832010
some of these cities some of these cities are not as maj well, des moines is a major city, but some aren't . 1832010_1840050
oh . 1840050_1843250
it's right in the middle of it .
and they're just on weather maps because they have a weather station there . 1843250_1852020
do we have to label like temperature, pressure ? 1852020_1855140
what did you have to do on the weather station model ? 1855140_1857260
I don't know . 1857260_1859100
oh . 1859100_1861240
you mean tell me what it is ?
no .
I know what it is .
all right . 1861240_1862060
yeah . 1862060_1865030
no .
you just write it down .
okay, jeff . 1865030_1875210
circle, and you put new york right there .
okay .
and keep this that right there .
can we just put like nc I mean ny for like new york ? 1875210_1880250
yeah . 1880250_1885060
make sure I'm not make sure you don't get too much clutter around it so that you can't tell that that's what it is .
okay . 1885060_1886030
okay ? 1886030_1891280
so make it clear enough that i'll be able to see it, because ny could easily get lost in there .
okay . 1891280_1892160
okay ? 1892160_1895260
what do we put for “steady” ? 1895260_1897260
s . 1897260_1898180
s . 1898180_1899000
yeah . 1900280_1901000
an arrow just shooting off . 1901000_1902260
okay . 1902260_1921260
here you are, mitch . 1921260_1922010
you can use the eraser . 1922010_1924090
use yours . 1924090_1927030
my pencil doesn't show up .
i'll go sharpen it . 1927030_1929020
no . 1929020_1934250
we're supposed to pencil that .
you guys seem to be having a lot less trouble than second hour did, or maybe I just explained it better this time . 1934250_1943070
I don't know .
miss a ? 1943070_1944000
mm+hm . 1944000_1945000
it's hard for me to write this small . 1945000_1946000
now what are we supposed to do ? 1946000_1947000
I know . 1947000_1948010
it's hard for me to even write . 1948010_1949010
I told you it would be a challenge for some of you . 1949010_1953180
yes .
you have very large handwriting .
I got very horrible handwriting . 1953180_1954230
oh, no . 1955140_1961010
that looks good, though .
that looks that's pretty good for you .
yeah .
'cause I know you would want to fill the map up with like los angeles would cover from l . 1961010_1966220
a .
all the way to florida .
I know . 1966220_1967250
it probably would .
mm+hm . 1967250_1973290
oh .
kansas city is kansas city, missouri .
did I say that ?
yeah . 1973290_1974270
okay . 1974270_1976260
missouri .
okay . 1976260_1978270
I've seen it in there .
hmm ? 1980110_1983270
which one ?
like kansas city . 1983270_1987120
I didn't know if it it's right there, isn't it ?
yep . 1987120_1994040
it's right on the edge .
and then there's another one in kansas, too, but it's not as big of a city .
this is a big city here .
you can't even see it . 1994040_1995080
I know . 1995080_1999200
they don't have it on that map .
do they have it on the plastic one ?
yeah . 1999200_2003270
missouri . 2003270_2010050
yep .
and missouri, yep .
and kansas .
miss a, what is it ? 2010050_2014170
east and west . 2014170_2016000
e does east go right there ? 2016000_2017000
mm+hm . 2017000_2018160
I don't need painkillers . 2018160_2020200
I can't give you medicine . 2020200_2022290
she would have to bring either a written she would have to bring a note . 2023220_2031240
do you want to go call home ? 2031240_2034290
well, I don't want to go home . 2034290_2037110
well, if you don't want to go home, can you call home and somebody can bring you the medicine ? 2037110_2040270
I don't have medicine . 2040270_2043090
aspirin ? 2043090_2045040
painkiller ?
aspirin ? 2045040_2048080
will it, like, let me be able to hear ?
tylenol ? 2048080_2053050
it won't let you hear, but it'll kill the hurt it'll kill the pain if you're in pain .
I'm in a lot of pain . 2053050_2054120
well, then you need to take like tylenol or something . 2054120_2059000
do you want to call home ?
yeah . 2059000_2060000

brooke, where did you get “des moines” ? 2077040_2079260
des moines . 2079260_2080010
des moines . 2080010_2081000
des moines .
the s is silent . 2081000_2082060
it is in iowa . 2082060_2084240
in your book or the plastic map ? 2084240_2086170
plastic map . 2086170_2087040
plastic map only . 2087040_2088140
oh . 2088140_2090230
how far did you get ? 2090230_2091250
I don't know where humidity goes . 2091250_2093080
where what ? 2093080_2094000
humidity goes . 2094000_2095000
humidity . 2095000_2097240
were you listening when I gave directions ?
you weren't listening ? 2100010_2108280
it's showing right now .
what did I say about humidity ?
did you have to put humidity on it last week ?
yeah . 2108280_2109040
think for a minute . 2109040_2116010
did you remember putting any on that worksheet we did ?
yeah . 2116010_2117000
humidity ? 2118000_2119000
yeah . 2119000_2121100
it goes right below temperature, doesn't it ?
no ? 2122140_2123030
does it go below air pressure ? 2123030_2125260
dew point goes below air temperature . 2125260_2132280
humidity is not on your station model at all .
remember I said that ?
yeah . 2132280_2135010
I got dew point underneath .
ah . 2135010_2137060
it's not on there at all .
oh . 2137060_2139030
just pressure what ?
humidity isn't on there at all . 2139030_2142100
there's no humidity on that station model . 2142100_2150270
because when you look at dew point, you should be able to tell what the humidity is like, right ?
is it New_Orleans or Kansas_City ? 2155290_2162070
whose got a hundred percent humidity ?
Denver . 2162070_2163090
Denver ? 2163090_2164000
not only Denver . 2164000_2165010
okay . 2165010_2169030
there's Denver .
okay .
what's temperature in Denver ?
thirty thirty . 2169030_2170000
what's dew point ? 2170000_2171060
thirty . 2171060_2172010
so what does that tell you about the humidity ? 2172010_2174250
it's gonna rain . 2174250_2175270
what's the humidity ? 2175270_2179010
hundred . 2179010_2180050
a hundred percent . 2180050_2182000
it's gonna rain or snow . 2182000_2183110
it's and it is doing that, right ? 2183110_2187180
right .
or it's gonna I don't know . 2187180_2196130
I will eliminate the ability to talk to your neighbors with for the worksheet, if we're gonna talk about other things . 2196130_2204240
is your phone it says like I don't know if it says “message for you” . 2204240_2207000
message for you . 2207000_2214250
I know .
somebody called me last week and left me a message .
I never answered it .
okay ? 2214250_2221130
do you get it now, stuart ?
no humidity because you can tell the humidity by the dew point .
how are you doing ?
okay . 2221130_2222260
now, these all have to go a certain way . 2222260_2225030
right . 2225030_2226260
this one I can't tell oh . 2226260_2231270
okay .
there it is .
your direction for wind .
oh . 2231270_2240290
what are the cloudies again ? 2240290_2243010
I forgot .
the cloudies ? 2243010_2244020
yes . 2244020_2247000
now, I know this is clear .
okay . 2247000_2248010
what one is this one ? 2250020_2251040
I say cloudy . 2251040_2254240
okay . 2254240_2259050
but you've got some sun there .
is it completely cloudy ?
no . 2259050_2266030
it's just cloudy .
mostly cloudy is completely cloudy, right ?
the same thing ?
mostly cloudy means there must be some a little bit of sun . 2266030_2270020
all right . 2270020_2271030
so what have you got there ? 2271030_2272290
mostly cloudy . 2272290_2273020
a little bit of sun . 2273020_2276250
right .
you want it all the way cloudy so what are you going to do ?
fill it in ? 2276250_2277090
right . 2277090_2279160
all right . 2279160_2284120
so whole circle, that's cloudy .
uh+huh . 2284120_2285080
and then half is partly cloudy, right ? 2285080_2289280
yes . 2289280_2294270
and then . 2294270_2303210
cloudy, partly cloudy, and then mostly cloudy is seventy five .
yep . 2303210_2309270
that's right . 2309270_2321100
you know what it is .
you're the only one that has to look at it .
so then what is going to be mostly sunny ?
this ? 2321100_2322030
a quarter . 2322030_2323000
that's clear . 2323000_2327090
that's completely sunny .
completely sunny ? 2327090_2328270
if you've got partly cloudy here, what's mostly sunny gonna look like ? 2328270_2334270
mostly clear except a little bit of clouds . 2334270_2345230
right .
right, right, right .
yep .
yep .
there you go .
you got it .
you sigh like you're in pain, todd . 2345230_2354230
is this hurting ?
come on, you're not gonna make me stand here the whole time, are you ? 2354230_2357040
no . 2357040_2358020
okay . 2358020_2359280
then stay on task, okay ?
where is kansas city at ? 2359280_2361010
I'm trying to calm her down . 2361010_2363210
I've got energy because he won't let me talk all day . 2363210_2365010
okay . 2365010_2370140
a very good question, jennifer .
that was the other one I hadn't answered .
listen, please .
one of those has a variable direction which means you're not gonna have an arrow shooting into that circle because they're all over the place . 2370140_2378080
if you don't have the arrow shooting into the circle, then you can't put the what ? 2378080_2382260
five miles per hour ?
yeah . 2382260_2383010
okay . 2383010_2388270
so put the line on there anywhere .
because if it's variable, it's changing a whole lot .
so just put it anywhere, and then put the five+mile+an+hour line on there . 2388270_2396260
there's another one, though, that says variable .
speed . 2396260_2397010
speed, so put the arrow for the wind direction and then put a v at the end of it, okay ? 2397010_2404230
because you can't say . 2404230_2410260
it's probably anywhere from three to fifteen miles an hour .
okay ? 2410260_2412290
get it ?
yeah . 2412290_2413070
okay . 2413070_2424180
does that help ?
okay .
the calm wind chill ? 2431020_2432000
yeah . 2432000_2433290
the wind speed .
uh+huh . 2433290_2434010
the lines with the five and the ten . 2434010_2438230
nine is closer to what ? 2438230_2442270
nine or I mean ten or five ?
it would be ten . 2442270_2443280
okay . 2443280_2445080
so use the ten .
okay . 2445080_2446000
okay ? 2446000_2453260
and even when you get to the &~twelve that's halfway between the ten and the &~fifteen you'll pick .
okay . 2453260_2454100
okay ? 2454100_2458230
you can either pick one ten mile an hour or the ten mile and five mile .
what about the calm ? 2458230_2460020
what do you do ?
“calm” you don't put any line at all . 2460020_2461030
okay . 2461030_2462010
there's no line because there's no direction, there's no nothing, okay ? 2462010_2465240
oh . 2465240_2471010
uh, and another thing .
what if you have like three ?
you shouldn't have two on there . 2471010_2475270
it's one or the other .
what is that ?
new york ?
yes, new york . 2475270_2476280
nine+mile+an+hour wind out of the northeast . 2476280_2482020
which direction is the northeast ?
up here . 2482020_2483000
yeah . 2483000_2491270
so erase that one you've got on the bottom, and then don't forget to put your ten+mile+an+hour line on there .
okay . 2491270_2498020
all right . 2498020_2507250
how many of you guys got done here ?
we only have like fifteen minutes .
how many have you got gone ?
I'm on my first one . 2507250_2508220
on your what ? 2508220_2509040
my first one . 2509040_2510190

I'm like halfway done . 2516050_2520040
you're halfway done ? 2520040_2521200
yep . 2521200_2522130
what would mostly cloudy is that, right ? 2522130_2524290
uh+huh . 2524290_2525250
and partly partly cloudy is half ? 2525250_2528190
uh+huh . 2528190_2530000
and then “mostly” is just like seventy five ? 2530000_2532120
uh+huh . 2532120_2533010
what would the twenty five be ? 2533010_2534010
what do you think ? 2534010_2538140
what is it mostly of if only a quarter of it is dark ?
mostly clear . 2538140_2539050
mostly clear or mostly sunny . 2539050_2541280
it goes like that . 2541280_2542280
you don't have any on there . 2542280_2543290
oh . 2543290_2544050
unfortunately it was a cloudy day all the way around the country . 2544050_2548210
like light green air is light rain ? 2548210_2551290
yeah . 2551290_2552180
okay . 2552180_2553040
yeah . 2553040_2562080
if you use the when you use the colored pencils, if they're dull, just use the hand sharpeners please .
because they chew it up, eat them away . 2562080_2564240
that's just xxx . 2564240_2566280
yeah . 2566280_2568260
yeah they drew their hand today, in art . 2568260_2574060
we had to draw it upside down . 2574060_2575280
you had to do your hand . 2575280_2579090
remember you had to do your hand ?
yeah, but we had to draw upside down . 2579090_2580270
they haven't got there yet . 2580270_2583260
can I go back there ? 2583260_2584080

she used to .
whose cousin ? 2615200_2617020

oh . 2628080_2628250
she's strong . 2628250_2629140
she really scares me . 2629140_2630230
I don't like my cousin; I like my cousin's friends . 2630230_2635280
my cousin scares me . 2635280_2639220
I don't like him .
I like my cousin's friends .
I don't know . 2639220_2641240
make sure you're putting those in the right place . 2641240_2643070
I am . 2643070_2644070
okay . 2644070_2657060
because it looks like los angeles is on top of your circle .
your circle needs to be to the left of that city name .
five miles an hour variable directions . 2657060_2658240
does that need to be in any direction ?
what one are we on, los angeles ? 2658240_2661020
yes . 2661020_2667030
and that's the one where I told you to just put the arrow anywhere .
I can't find it, mitch . 2667030_2670110
how do you do a variable wind ? 2670110_2674100
okay . 2674100_2676270
my parents were in Las_Vegas, you know, september eleven .
it's there . 2676270_2677100
they were ? 2677100_2678100
yeah . 2678100_2679100
ooh . 2679100_2680020
yeah . 2680020_2684210
you see, they made a really wise decision .
you see, originally my dad didn't want to .
it's the speed, the variable speed . 2684210_2687120
it's what she said . 2687120_2691230
and then you put a v on it . 2691230_2696190
that's for the five miles per hour, I think . 2696190_2700030
they did drive ? 2700030_2702000
I wouldn't have gotten on an airplane .
oh . 2704250_2705060
yeah .
it was either drive or spend two hundred dollars a night to stay at the hotel . 2705060_2707160
i'm sorry, jeff . 2707160_2708130
were they even flying planes at that point ? 2708130_2709230
yeah . 2709230_2710250
when they were coming back they were ? 2710250_2711060
oh . 2711060_2713050
no .
no, they weren't .
we weren't having any planes in the air at that point . 2713050_2715280
wow .
it would be a nice drive, unless you're in a hurry . 2717290_2720110
they they tried to do that . 2720110_2723190
what's today ? 2723190_2724270
the twenty eighth ?
but, I mean, they didn't have that thing I mean they weren't back they initially were supposed to be gone one week . 2724270_2729190
but they weren't back home xxx . 2729190_2731180
oh . 2731180_2732260
yeah .
xxx if they didn't have that car . 2732260_2734160
yeah . 2734160_2735030
because there was so many people who were just diving to get in a car . 2735030_2736030
your name's right there . 2736030_2738130
oh, I'm sure . 2738130_2740130
yeah .
supply and demand .
I drew variable direction . 2742180_2745210
like, what do you put for variable direction ?
variable direction ? 2745210_2748100
I think I answered that a few minutes ago .
I thought you answered variable speed . 2748100_2749230
what did I say about variable direction, wes ? 2749230_2752270
pardon ? 2752270_2753230
what did I say when the direction is variable ? 2753230_2755070
it can go any you can just point the arrow in whatever way you want it to . 2755070_2759070
just put a line on there somewhere to attach your five miles per hour . 2759070_2766210
there you go . 2766210_2773140
there you go .
do we have to use different colors ? 2773140_2775280
no . 2775280_2783230
uh+uh .
no .
not on the station model .
the whole thing can be the same color .
when you shade, if you want to use color, you can use color .
okay . 2783230_2787250
it's just like shading when you did the station model worksheet .
how are you doing over here ? 2787250_2788230
good . 2788230_2789200
you get it ? 2789200_2790280
yeah . 2790280_2791090
good . 2791090_2793110
how many you got done, mitch ? 2793110_2794270
how many station models ? 2796000_2797200
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven . 2797200_2798230
seven . 2798230_2800280

one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight .
okay .
yes ? 2807070_2809060
who's calling me ?
what ?
since cape hatteras is out in the ocean, where are we supposed to put it ? 2809060_2811200
it isn't in the ocean . 2811200_2813060
there's no dot . 2813060_2814130
it is right it's a cape so I'm assuming it's like right here . 2814130_2824210
we'll just make it right there .
there's the city .
now go with it .
it's not in the ocean . 2824210_2826220
that's how they showed it on the map . 2826220_2829050
actually, I should show you the picture of the lighthouse that's there . 2829050_2832260
i'll pull that stuff out for tomorrow because it's kind of interesting . 2832260_2847130
where is cape hatteras ? 2847130_2849000

hmm . 3058150_3062260
good question .
where would the most humidity be ?
think about look at well, think about a weather map . 3062260_3070290
where is the precipitation around the fronts ? 3070290_3078030
precipitation is behind the front or in front of the front ? 3078030_3080280
it's in front of it . 3080280_3082010
in front of the front . 3082010_3088040
okay .
so if you're looking at precipitation, you're looking at humidity, too .
so what is higher humidity gonna tell you ? 3088040_3095040
precipitation . 3095040_3097090
it's gonna tell you there's precipitation so where would it be located in relationship to the front ? 3097090_3102220
by the precipitation . 3102220_3104050
what will be by the precipitation ? 3104050_3106230

it's in iowa . 3120120_3123240
I read that book in art . 3123240_3125160
hmm ? 3125160_3126000
I was looking through that book in art . 3126000_3127200
were you ? 3127200_3128080
one of the last days . 3128080_3130040

you might finish if you don't talk .
I haven't been talking all day . 3158010_3159030

I get a lot of energy when I don't talk .
you what ? 3166220_3167210
I don't like this . 3167210_3169140
I get a lot of energy when I don't talk .
tomorrow is gonna be even worse because you won't be allowed to talk in here either . 3169140_3172160
i'll be running around the whole the whole lunch hour . 3172160_3176010

I got all the cities . 3185000_3186100
you got all the cities done ? 3186100_3191250
okay .
I told jennifer to go ahead and ooh, cynthia, you went ahead of your group .
you're supposed to be making those decisions with your group together . 3191250_3194010
okay . 3195100_3203280
so that you can explain why you think the front needs to go somewhere and then someone else can either debate with you or agree with you . 3203280_3210290
and don't agree with the person just because they get better grades in science . 3210290_3216070
because a lot of times when it comes to this kind of stuff they won't get it . 3216070_3223000
it happens an awful lot .
sometimes those people that really get good grades have a real hard time with this kind of stuff . 3229010_3233180
mitch ?
is this homework ? 3233180_3235050
no . 3235050_3236270
it is not homework .
oh, good . 3236270_3238000
I'm gonna give you one more minute to work and then I'm gonna explain the rest to you . 3238000_3242190
what did she say ?
nine after . 3242190_3243120
nine after ? 3243120_3246140
I figured she was gonna be going to lunch .
so can we get out at the bell ? 3246140_3248150
no . 3248150_3255020
you'll get out before the bell .
if you want to get out at the bell, it probably won't ring until a quarter after or so .
oh . 3255020_3256020
the bells are behind ?
the bells are behind . 3256020_3264180
because it would actually be ringing during the middle of if we were following that clock during the middle of fourth hour .
it's that middle bell . 3264180_3267000
I don't like the fourth the bell for fourth hour because there's no minute bell which is why I'm always late . 3267000_3272010
you won't be today . 3272010_3273040
I know . 3273040_3274000
because there will be teachers in the hallway making sure you make it, because you won't be talking to each other in the hallway . 3274000_3278280
it's actually working out quite nicely . 3278280_3280230
I feel like I'm in a state prison . 3280230_3282070
that's how we want it to feel . 3282070_3283220
about the only difference is that is that the teachers aren't carrying twelve gauges . 3283220_3287250
no, we won't do that, but we are definitely it is definitely a crackdown situation . 3287250_3293070
