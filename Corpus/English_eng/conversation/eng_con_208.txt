Oh blimey you have got a spare nappy here somewhere have n't you .
0 .
Or you do have .
Er just as well I did have yeah God knows where anything is now
0 .
eh Jane do you know what Mike rang the solicitor up yesterday and
Yes .
that he just received them like about half an hour before Mike rang
Once you 've signed the contracts .
Yeah .
You 've got to have a witness have n't you sign it in front of
I do n't think .
Send it back and it should be pretty soon after that is n't it .
Well he said Mike must have said what has been holding it up if I
Yeah .
cos it was put in the hands of Black Horse by Miss .
That 's right .
and they were dealing with it .
Yeah .
well seemingly it must be as simple as that .
No .
so she 's been dealing with her Manchester solicitors and a London
Mm .
so this is what 's been holding everything up .
Yeah .
So Mike must said to him well the thing is well we wanted to really
Mm .
so he said you do n't have to move on a Friday cos Mike said well
That 's right yeah .
I suppose it 's mutual agreement .
Yeah .
I mean we 'll move any day but it 's whether Miss will you see .
Yeah the only reason most people choose a Friday is because they
They get you over the weekend yeah so erm we 'll just have to see
Yeah it should be a week then should n't it .
Hopefully er what did you say five working days .
It 's normally five working days yeah .
Mm mm you see cos even if we sort of made it for like the middle of
Mm .
would bring us like the Wednesday that would be my birthday
Mm .
but it 'll make it Easter weekend .
Yeah .
we 'll we would n't mind I would n't mind doing that .
No .
because it 'd give Mike an extra few days anyway could actually
Get settled .
the Wednesday off and all the following week .
Mm .
which would give him a good break really to get a few things done .
Yeah .
Well it 'll all be .
I 'm not doing any I 'm I 'm all this bloody panicking about
Let 'em rough it for a week .
Mm we 'll rough it for a while because I know the downers the only
Mm .
which Don said we could do .
Yeah .
to sort the dog out really .
Mm .
but everything else we can sort getting there it 's not as if we
Not really .
I mean do you find you you use your fire more .
We have been doing over the past few nights .
Have ya .
because I 've been turning the heating it 's the .
Yeah .
I do n't know from tea time it seems to warm up the house .
Mm .
and it 's boiling hot .
Yeah .
from sort of eight o'clock so I could .
Then it cools off .
Yeah .
do n't it .
So I just put it on just to tick .
Yeah .
the room over really but I mean if you can keep your heating on for
Mm that 's what I 'll do I do n't think we 'll use the fire that
Yeah .
and we went to bed anyway .
Yeah .
just gone ten .
That 's what I mean we used to turn ours off of about nine half
Mm .
over till about eleven you could just feel it cooling down .
Yeah .
but because I 've been knocking it off that bit earlier .
Yeah .
sort of five minutes .
And how have you fi I think we 're gon na end up like with a fire
No it 's ever so nice .
because we do like it .
Yeah .
and we thought well one night I mean it 's a bloody big radiator in
Mm .
which I think would be enough .
You would n't you 'd probably find that you would use it half a
Yeah yeah .
No I wo n't get rid of mine .
Have you sort of not I suppose you have n't found out money- wise
No not really I should imagine it 's not I do n't know you see we
Yeah .
so I do n't suppose it 's cost us any more .
No .
because we 've hardly had it on .
Mm .
Still you .
You do find it warm do n't ya .
I do yeah .
Have you got a couple of settings on yours is it a high and a low .
Well I 've just got high and low that 's all .
But I mean it 'll give you er a wattage er whatever it is .
Yeah .
it pumps out anyway .
well I suppose so I do n't know what we 've got .
The .
0 .
yeah because as I say something like what Jane 's got would fit in
Mm .
Mm .
which like I say saw one up at erm I told you that fireplace shop
You should start looking round .
0 .
erm I mean really ideally Mike would like one of those that
Yeah .
in in the fireplace .
I know what you mean .
and it 's got a back to it .
Mm .
and it sort of throws the heat out into the room .
Yeah yeah .
Well I could it could it would n't justify it .
But Chris I ca n't see them I ca n't see them making a fire like
No but what I 'm saying is .
Josh come on .
if there was n't .
come on Josh Josh .
if there was n't a good amount of radiator in that room .
Josh .
it would justify having a fire like that .
Come on .
Yeah yeah .
but because it 's got such a good .
Yeah .
Radiator .
you know cos I told you Mike actually fancies one of these that
I know what you mean next door .
and there 's a backing to it and it pumps it out into the room they
Yeah .
but I do n't think this room needs it Jane .
No .
Mm .
I think it 'll be a waste and I do n't want to go to the expense of
Well they are bloody expensive .
because .
It slipped .
I think the fires are about three hundred quid .
Mm .
but it 's not that you 'd have to have a lot of the fireplace
Mm you would .
Yeah .
it 's only a little square .
Yeah we 'd have to have the pillars taken off .
Yeah .
and everything like that so all that would have to be redecorated .
Whereas like that one of ours it 'd be ideal would n't it .
It be it just work right .
Must have your chimney swept .
That 's what I want to get that number off you for that as well
I got it somewhere yeah .
would n't he .
I got it somewhere I 'll root it out for ya and I forgot to see

Mike .
Funny enough I saw her yesterday .

Is it worth my taking a coat on .
and that .
Oh .

Well just any time we wo n't be doing nothing until the end of May
Michael Michael shout Mike .
As soon as she comes back I promise I 'll ask her .

Be careful .

Hopefully we can get away with that room Jane with just maybe
Yeah .
because I mean once you 've taken all the pictures down I think it
She 's a smoker int she That 's .
very much .
Yeah that 'll be your main thing then .
Rather than decorate I think we 'll just .
Paint it .
er emulsion over it and maybe put a border around the picture
This is in the back room .
Front room .
Mm .
Yeah leave the front room we 'll have to first week or so we 'll
Yeah .
