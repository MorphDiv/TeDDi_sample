conversation number thirty eight . 5580_7060
dash ninety five portion of a telephone conversation between the
hello . 27820_28120
oh yes sir . 28350_28820
well just wanted to say that . 29720_31310
&-uh keep the faith . 31420_33630
yes sir . 34070_34440
how'd the tenor go . 35030_35630
well it was fine . 36260_36670
great . 36740_37070
great success . 37580_38310
Sinatra okay . 38890_39400
oh he was fine . 39800_40470
just did a beautiful job . 40560_41950
that's good standing ovation for him and everything really
well one of the more difficult ones . 47960_50710
I had you know what I had on my mind . 50810_53200
everything . 53290_53610
but &-uh that's no problem . 54070_56020
well I think you know we've we've reviewed what the worst is
and I think <we can> we can deal with whatever it is . 64370_66870
and the the thing now is just to play it as it lies day by day
no I I don't think so . 83270_84950
I don't think he went up . 84970_85790
oh yeah he had his conference with him . 86480_89200
but I don't think he went to the jury . 89250_90470
yep . 91750_91840
I god I just do hope that he says . 93930_96720
look I'm I'll be a witness but I'm not gonna be a defendant you
yeah well he will . 103940_105950
and that's and just say here's the truth . 107180_108810
he I'm sure that's what I'll do . 110940_112430
mhm I just the only problem is if he thinks he's being helpful on
and I don't think he will . 119880_122670
now I think he understands that's right . 122710_124750
what is the one point that I as I urge today is that you and John
and &-uh you know and look at the names and so_forth . 141910_144830
and and &-uh you know &-uh just be prepared . 145030_151790
for it I think too that &-uh you gotta consider the the dean
I don't know whether somebody really ought_to talk to him . 162010_164870
I don't know whether I should . 165210_166230
but I &-uh you must think about that as_to whether whether it's
because &-uh he's obviously on the kick of &-um saving himself . 173290_180060
and &-uh . 180540_180990
and the Us attorney's gonna have tough problem . 183910_185860
and I think the Us attorney will . 186220_187910
my guess is well you know give him the immunity . 188750_191740
think he will huh . 192830_193380
well I would think so . 194350_195150
Bob . 195260_195430
hmm . 196440_196670
and &-uh and that of_course will if the Us attorney is giving him
but if they're giving him the immunity in terms if he'll if it's an
and &-uh but they of_course <have their> have their other
I do hope . 222360_222830
&-uh one thing that &-uh that the other thing we gotta do is to Bob
I mean that's I just feel some way that ought_to be able to be done
you know what I mean that . 240540_241390
&-uh &-uh I don't know whether there there is any way though is
well I I think <I don't> I don't see anything other_than
and that's it for people who the &-um one point two Bob if you and
(be)cause maybe with more in this instance of &-uh . 280630_282510
of what the hell . 283950_284830
&-uh there's one troublesome thing to me about Dean and I want you
&-uh . 298980_298990
&-uh I mean &-uh you were there . 299690_302340
but &-uh they would say . 302460_304070
well right at that moment the president should have probably turned
you see no why not well because you didn't know what you had . 309020_314740
and you didn't you weren't in any position to turn it over to him .
well on the ground that when he said . 318820_320070
look they want money for their fees and so_forth and so on . 320210_322700
and then &-uh and he said . 322720_326060
well and I suppose we did we had I mean in fairness we we were
well what can be done . 332320_333340
you know . 333630_333830
and &-uh the way Dean might put that is it . 335380_338710
well because you gotta figure that maybe he could say . 338760_343140
well he was in the president's office and told the president that
yeah yeah . 348110_348780
but &-uh what's your guess on that . 349580_350860
<I just> I just can't I don't know I just can't conceive that
mhm . 358700_358890
but then he'll will of_course report that he reported it to
and that was discussed with Mitchell right . 369780_371500
and &-uh who was he present at the room that time . 374580_376780
and you know when they said that Mitchell said . 376900_380830
well it's taken care of . 380880_381700
yeah . 381960_382110
<it was> it was John that he talked to . 383200_385810
you were present . 387580_388180
Erlichman present . 388560_389020
mhm . 389040_389240
yeah . 391770_391830
shows I suppose knowledge that said . 394060_395660
why didn't you go tell the president then . 395680_397150
well there again it was <you can> you can argue . 400350_402900
(be)cause it was there were there was a separated amount
family problem . 408740_409440
he had right . 409580_410470
hm . 417850_417990
well give it that one some hard thought you know . 419720_422070
and (be)cause I suppose the dean will log that one in pretty soon .
yeah . 429070_429130
I mean he you that just that's almost beyond belief . 431860_436180
if he has immunity he'll do it . 436370_437830
he doesn't he may not want to . 438100_440270
but &-um the way he &-uh operating it's very interesting . 441580_449510
of_course the problem is that he talked to me . 453770_455780
and and that day I talked to god damn freely with him . 455820_459060
and I said . 459080_459430
well what the hell . 459480_460110
are you gonna get it . 460160_460910
you know . 461210_461420
and &-um he says . 462880_464030
<we don't> we don't have the money . 464260_465110
and how much is it . 465380_466860
it'll be a million dollars . 467230_468150
and I said . 468340_468820
good god . 469710_470060
I said . 470200_470470
and they went into the blackmail thing . 471480_472780
he said . 472840_473190
this is blackmail . 473240_473980
and I said . 474100_474670
we can't be blackmailed or somebody said that or he did he gotta
didn't he I'm not sure he did . 479760_483310
and that I that not I'm not sure . 483860_486430
he said . 486600_486820
we <couldn't be> couldn't be blackmailed . 486840_490630
there's a question whether you go down that route . 493270_496980
I wish there were a way we could at_least separate Erlichman out .
I don't know how you can because &-uh his &-uh hmm see the the
yeah . 515270_515450
because you see it just it's a destruction <of his> of his
but . 520140_520260
&-uh there are other things to do . 520630_523460
and &-uh I don't know . 526300_527870
still they they've got a long ways to go before they can . 530260_532670
you . 535300_535360
can make a point on any of that . 535520_536700
yep . 540260_540460
it is a long ways . 540740_541820
and in the meantime of_course that'll be a constant problem when it
well no use to borrow any more trouble than we got is there . 548110_551950
nope . 552110_552220
but let's let's sit down and just put on a piece of paper . 553580_556700
<what the> what the vulnerabilities are . 556830_559340
how many people as I see at the present time you've got . 559620_563530
I got clear cases in terms of prior knowledge of Larue Mitchell
what do you think . 575550_575980
well Brian well I guess so on the I guess they must from what on
they did cover up Brian and and &-uh see now and also <what
it's very important . 597110_597860
I think that we get that you know is so that that is really
see my point . 604610_604940
mhm that makes sense to . 605000_609980
and &-uh I mean if we talk about we gotta really think about how
and &-uh the &-uh point is that if information comes to me why
and yep said . 631900_634150
look here it is . 634200_635460
then after that call Magruder cracked so . 635750_638470
let's put it all down . 640540_641300
okay . 641850_641940
don't you think that's a good idea . 642330_643380
sure in the White House the people that are involved would be &-uh
I kind I don't think Fielding is but I I'm not sure . 672630_676180
yeah . 676560_676660
but &-uh strong . 677900_679260
can you think of anybody else in the White House that &-uh no
messenger . 699060_699300
so except_for his &-uh slip with regard to how much money and that
I can't hang him on that . 707600_708470
he's got to go in and say . 708750_710130
look I called him as_soon_as I checked found the exact amount there
blah . 716870_717110
blah . 717160_717230
blah blah right . 717280_718030
yeah . 718550_718660
mhm . 719580_719710
so that's that it doesn't touch . 726390_728420
I trust Hic B does it or I suppose I don't think they're gonna
have they or . 733680_734150
no . 734380_734550
yeah let's see anybody else . 735220_741390
I don't think so . 748330_748740
the curious business of &-uh though their their argument that
&-uh that's what is really strange . 757000_759620
what they gain from that . 760390_761270
what they gain from that I guess is that they get the fish . 762130_764030
and then let Dean off . 764080_766020
but you can't do that . 766300_767310
<I mean> I mean it's just better to let Dean Dean go . 768790_773300
and then of_course he will as I say he's gonna destroy the
isn't that what he's threatened . 778640_780170
he's been threatening all the time . 781270_782790
isn't he even to you not no no Dean no . 782890_787460
he never did . 788060_788710
he he always played as_if he's part of the team trying to . 790500_793140
yeah he went through his cancer theory . 793160_794580
mhm . 795370_795500
but he never you know the whole issue was says . 795990_799780
we got a then hall . 800560_802720
and then Erlichman was saying . 802860_803990
and &-uh and that let it all hang out in school . 804500_806500
and I said . 806710_807070
all right get at it . 807140_807870
what the hell is it . 807920_808730
well the tragedy of_course is John John Mitchell god damnit . 811710_816140
why he as tough as it is . 816180_818030
doesn't step up you know at this point he's going to he's gonna get
I'd question . 823980_824590
and &-uh he's &-um I guess he figures he can stall it out . 825260_834700
I don't think he can do it . 837080_838140
I mean there are there may be technical legal things and a_lot_of
he can fight . 841440_842020
it'll . 842730_843030
take a long time . 843080_843740
but but he ought_to step up to him and say . 844020_849140
look I assume the responsibility for this period . 849160_851710
and like for example saying . 853140_857110
activate Kaba hell . 857600_858550
who said that . 858780_859300
Mitchell said it . 859640_860020
mhm didn't he . 861090_861880
yeah . 862160_862300
and then Dean proceeded to come to you . 863110_866060
you said . 867930_868230
okay I'm not I that I'm not clear on I don't . 868350_871630
mhm . 871990_872140
he . 872460_872600
has he's never been direct on that . 873180_875860
he's he is on John Erlichman yeah . 875950_878600
went Erlichman Ehrlichman said . 879560_880710
okay . 880990_881260
he hangs for some reason . 881500_882860
he hangs out on John and then he is he sort of alluded to that you
mhm . 889000_889140
well I can prove it . 893230_895750
okay . 896430_896670
John Bob bye . 896720_897650
right . 898140_898300
this concludes the abuse of government power segments for
dash ninety five . 911480_912380
