What I want to do today is I want to take a look at some of the
I want to see if as a group I want us to look at them and decide if
So, start with one ? 16032_17873
Jamie, one more time, big voice . 17873_20877
I think it's a pretty adequate way of showing information because
okay, comments about what Jamie said, or other comments about this ?
I didn't hear what she said . 33641_34753
You didn't hear what she said . 34753_35602
Jamie, you just have to really, you have a really quiet voice and
Speak up . 39121_41509
okay, I think that it's an adequate way of showing the information
What what do you mean by the majority of the numbers ?
What do you mean, he, Derrick doesn't know what you mean by the
The where most of the numbers were . 59021_62275
Where most of the numbers are +... 62275_65497
I mean like, when she talks about, I think what she's saying, like
I do see where it goes up . 74829_76154
Yeah, like right in there, that's where the majority of it is .
okay . 80784_82211
The highest range of the numbers ? 82211_83040
Yeah . 83040_83623
The highest range ? 83623_84287
Oh, no . 84287_85216
No . 85216_85646
Vallory ? 85646_86941
Out of however many people were tested, that's where most of those
With those little +... 96243_98859
You mean this range here ? 98859_99806
Yes . 99806_101403
okay, these folks kind of wrote out what they were talking about .
This one right here they said +"/. 106860_110197
+" the new drug was better than the old . 110197_112456
The majority of the old ones are behind five fifty, and the majority
First of all, do you know what that person did, what they were
Vallory ? 133408_137204
Why did they +... 137204_140060
five fifty ? 140060_141918
I don't know ? 141918_142798
Why is five fifty so important ? 142798_145223
Because the median is really five hundred . 145223_148029
no it's not, but it's not five fifty . 148029_150502
Kiri ? 150502_152029
Because five fifty is in the middle of the whole thing, like the whole,
five fifty is in the middle . 162122_163382
It might not be the middle of the data, but it's the middle of
Oh, so it's like the middle of the range, not necessarily the
Cause, me when I looked at it, five fifty had, it's kind of where .
Wait just a minute . 175963_176893
Derek, you are going to have to sit up and put that hood down .
He doesn't have his hood up . 178621_181308
Derek . 181308_181972
He's sleeping . 181972_183368
Sit up . 183368_184015
I'm sorry, can you start over ? 184015_189409
When I looked at the computer, they were like lined up straight on
And then starting to get above it, or all the dots for the old
Oh, so it was like a natural break . 204550_209130
When I, when I, when I was going around talking to some groups, and
What I heard them say I think it is the same thing .
They were trying to find the place sort of between the hills .
So if they looked at where this kind of hill started and where this
And so that's why they took that break .
okay, and this group did a similar thing because they said they
So they used five twenty five, and these people used five fifty .
So they were doing like you were talking about Megan, looking at
Questions or comments about these two ways ?
Marissa ? 262792_265699
I would think the second one would be more confusing because it
Oh . 273801_276573
So it looks like that there's more . 276573_281653
They had fifty six that were above five twenty five, and they only
So it's like, I guess what I'm trying to say is it's harder to
What about what Marissa said ? 291878_295033
she just said there were more people in the old program
So somebody might say the old program was better because there were
Jamie ? 312970_314996
This is related . 314996_316789
You know like, like a, like a scale drawing where it's not the same
If you look at it, so you have to +... 326403_326615
I know what you're trying to say . 326615_331810
So, so Kyle said that from this information he was able to make
And that that was helpful for him . 342535_344526
I've got a question for everybody . 344526_347147
Couldn't you just argue, hey, this shows really convincingly that
Because there were fifty six of them, fifty six scores above five
I mean, there's nineteen more people in there, so that's the better
Blake ? 374917_377758
But then there's more people with the old program than there is
Jason . 383484_384146
Then you see that there's thirty seven is more than half over five
more of them on the bottom than on the top .
okay . 402217_403230
Can somebody help me out ? 403230_404775
Can somebody paraphrase what Blake and Jason are talking about ?
What was Jason just saying ? 409671_413456
Somebody help us out with what Jason was just saying .
I didn't hear him . 415961_417388
You couldn't hear him ? 417388_418965
If you would pay attention . 418965_420706
okay, I couldn't hear him . 420706_421554
okay , guys come on . 421554_423795
okay, you see how thirty seven is more than half of nine and thirty
But fifty six is not more than half of thirty, a hundred thirty and
There's more on the bottom one than on the top one .
right ? 439745_442036
okay, who can help me out with that, who can say that a different way
Will, can you say it a different way ? 446851_448510
Well, in that situation it wouldn't matter how many people were in
Big voice, Will . 454637_455433
on the bottom one you have, see what Jason was saying there's more
So that means that if, if uh there was the same amount of people
And Will +... 497313_499219
No, he's trying to say +... 499219_500234
Alright . 500234_502158
He's trying to say that +... 502158_503138
I see . 503138_506174
I think that when you add . 506174_507787
I don' think that +... 507787_508167
Alright, Derrick, you go ahead and then we'll get .
Marcus is on this; hang on Will . 508930_510342
Big voice now Derrick . 510342_511404
He's trying to say that, that half, like the thirty seven is over
uh and uh like it fills more people
than sixty than like the one we been working on a similar . 528337_534294
I see . 534294_534792
So, same job as before, guys . 534792_536983
Take a look at this one . 536983_538592
This is, this is the old treatment and this is the new treatment .
Your first job is to see if you can understand what these folks
okay let's take a look . 548736_550843
I've got two people, three people . 550843_552521
Four people . 552521_555062
Blake, you want to take a shot at it ? 555062_564208
Yeah, um . 564208_566181
Big voice Blake . 566181_567078
I think it's adequate because, uh, for one, like you know when
So that's gonna be like a comparison . 576261_580506
They split into four groups . 580506_584425
okay, so it's, so it's helpful that the ranges are the same and then,
And then with the four equal groups, you can tell where the
Can you do that by looking at this ? 597523_599082
Can you, So what do you see when you look at this Blake ?
That the new treatment worked better than the old treatment .
Well, I just couldn't hear you . 605489_606683
That the new treatment was better than the old treatment +...
And what are you basing that comment on ? 609358_610783
Because the three lines for the equal groups were all . 610783_619236
What is that five twenty five ? 619236_620263
Yeah . 620263_620893
Above five twenty five compared to only one of them was over on the top .
Ah . 626071_626804
Marcus, something to add ? 626804_628463
Yeah, last time like, it was like kind of crooked, and this time
So then you have to sort of move it in .
Like, I'm not trying to copy what Blake said .
But it is good though . 641092_642968
Any way, it shows it might help more if they had put the numbers in
Put the numbers in here ? 650487_652266
In the, in like say the fourth group would be a twelve in there,
Alright, now if guys, if this is, if they divided it into four equal
No . 673814_674475
Could we do that right now ? 674475_675652
Derrick says no . 675652_676648
If we knew how many +... 676648_678011
There's forty, on the bottom one . 678011_680999
Wasn't it the bottom one ? 680999_682640
Forty six . 682640_683188
There were forty six and there was one hundred eighty six on the
Divide it into half . 686757_687288
It doesn't really matter . 687288_688568
Divide it into half . 688568_689232
It doesn't really matter cause you can already, it , even if it was
Wait a minute guys, this is important . 697731_698924
Blake, go ahead . 698924_701513
Well, it doesn't really matter where the all the data is because
okay, so, ya, so Blake says it doesn't really matter exactly how
