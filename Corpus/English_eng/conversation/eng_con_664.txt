&~www .
&-er yesterday there was a boy called Tom .
and he had a dog called Sam .
&-um they had a pet frog called &-er Bob .
and Tom was very tired .
so he went to bed .
and while Tom was asleep Bob the frog escaped from his pot .
next morning Tom woke up with <this frog not> this dog Sam
and they notice that Bob has gone .
so Tom put on his clothes and went to go and find him .
they looked out the window and started calling for him .
then they went outside to look a bit further .
and they went all the way around into the woods and round that area
and they started calling his name over and over .
they looked down holes .
they looked at beehives .
&-um when Tom looked down a hole , he found that a weasel came out
&-um Sam was playing around by a tree .
and he noticed a beehive .
and Tom was looking in a hole in the tree .
so Sam set the bees off .
and they went mad starting to chase Sam .
so Tom blew laid down quiet and still .
and there was an owl above them making loud noises .
the owl was still above Tom , when he climbed on to a big rock
he climbed up to the top shouting with Sam below .
Tom realized it was a moose .
the moose carried Tom away .
and Sam started following them to the side of a hill .
when the moose threw Tom and Sam off the side of the hill , they
they both got soaking wet .
&-er shh !
Tom said +"/.
+" be quiet .
because they heard a noise coming from a log .
Tom and Sam <looked through a hole> looked around the other
they saw Bob with a female frog .
and they had a family .
so they left them they said +"/.
+" goodbye .
and went off back to the house .
