yeah . 458950_459130

this had to be . 460750_461790
blue . 462630_462870
this had to be red . 466180_467170
this to be blue . 468260_469240
wait . 469900_470000
why would this have to be blue . 470610_471770
when you flip it over . 471860_472650
you don't want blue behind there . 472670_474050
do you what color do you want behind if it's red on the front here

and when we flipped it over what did we find out . 489210_490980
&-um . 492930_493050
it was blue . 493730_494250
and that's why we're gonna make a new one . 494270_495540
right .
'cause we want it to be when we flipped it over the same color . 496500_498240
'cause you noticed your pattern . 499080_499900
you knew you had two red triangles . 499970_501420
like if this was an hourglass shape and two blue triangles . 501470_504370
and on the back you did that you copied your pattern . 504870_507530
but what was the problem . 507970_508980
they didn't line up with the . 509180_511090
front . 512600_512890
