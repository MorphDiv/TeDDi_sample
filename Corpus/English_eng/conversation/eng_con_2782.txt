this is the Harry <A> Blackmun Supreme Court Oral History
it's being held on June <twenty-seven> , <nineteen
I teach at Yale Law School .
I'm a former law clerk to Justice Blackmun , and I'm the
<v@l> Nixon , the Nixon tapes case .
today we're going to come back and talk about some other cases from
but before we did that , I just wanted to note that the day before
he had been the chief justice for , I guess , sixteen years , and
I was wondering if you had any thoughts on this occasion .
well , yes .
he died Sunday morning , and he had been ill for some time and in
his death marks the passing of an era , certainly .
he was appointed in <nineteen sixty-nine> , and had served
he presided over the Court during a number of important terms , I

because he was expected , said the media , to roll back the
well , one can never go back , and I think the new chief justice
if he did have a desire to roll back , he didn't have the votes ,
but I never sensed , ever , any feeling of resentment on his part .
of course , I think he'll go down as an imaginative and innovative
he brought in a lot of innovations that helped , I think , the
can you give me some examples of some of his contributions ?
well , largely procedural , many of them internal that the public
I think he was much more at home in procedure than he was in the
do you think the Court was really the Burger Court ?
it's called the Burger Court , obviously , because of his position
what's your reaction to that ?
of course , as you point out , the Court , in various periods of
it's a good way to describe it .
there are strong chiefs and there are weak chiefs , I suppose .
but there are influences exerted by associate justices .
one has to recognize , for example , the great influences that
many times the public and the media like to link them , but they
you've now dealt with one chief justice who came from within the
what do you think are the differences between the way someone

earl Warren came on the Court , I believe , without a day of
on the other hand , he had a lot of practical political experience
it must not have been an easy period for him , especially in the
one question often raised about Chief Justice Burger is why he

as I remember , at one time some media person asked him how he was

I think that was important in his mind , and whether he was saying
+" harry , it's about time you think of this , too .
I don't know .
he never did .
but taking up the Bicentennial was certainly his decision .
it kept him busy for almost three years , and I think he did a lot
do you think Warren Burger wanted to move the Court to the right
when you put it that way , perhaps my answer is along the line of
I think perhaps he would like to have moved the Court to the right
I'm not sure that he was , but there isn't much one can do if the
<mister> Justice , on a personal level , he was one of your

what were the best parts of your friendship with the chief ?
of course , I knew Warren Burger since we were four or five years
we both grew up on the East Side of <Saint> Paul , and that
we went to the same elementary school , not the same high school ,
I think I knew Warren Burger intimately , maybe in some ways better
what were the qualities of his that you liked the best ?
I think he was basically honest and a little too belligerent at
once in a while , I like to think I had to restrain him from
there our judicial philosophies differed , and from then on , we
but I never heard from him any sense of resentment at all .
he was too big a person to be resentful , +/.
do you have any memories of enjoyable times you spent together as
+, oh , sure , lots of them .
we were campers together on a beautiful spot on the <Saint>
the camp was on the Wisconsin side .
then as the years went by , we went back during each summer , and
those were happy times indeed .
a couple of times I was concerned about him .
he always said he could swim the <Saint> Croix River , it
when he attempted it , I insisted a boat go along , and I was the
but he got over .
he was strong physically , far stronger than I was , and much
but I think he was glad I was there , because I rode him back
we enjoyed working with younger boys and the like , exchanging
during high school and college years , it was a close friendship .
some consider you to be unlikely friends , that your temperaments
did you ever think of yourselves as unlikely friends ?
I never thought much about it , really .
I think we liked each other a lot .
we played a lot of tennis together .
there were four of us that were fairly close .
who were the other two ?
I think you've mentioned them on the tapes .
yes , I think I have .
one was a young man named John Briggs , who was a year older , or
he knew what he wanted to do ; he wanted to go to medical school .
he got there , was a fine cardiologist , and then later died .
the other one was Robert Damkroger , who ended up working for
but we were close , did a lot of things together , dated a lot
why do you think , Mister Justice you and Warren
it is hard for me to answer that question , really , because when
strangely enough , we never had anything in opposition to each
I don't know why that was , but , on the other hand , although
but I can remember he always wanted to go to law school , and went

he had a lot of opposition in the bar , but that was part of his
he stirred up opposition , and part of my job was to keep that at a
in talking about the term , the October <nineteen seventy-four>
one is the area of affirmative action , another is the area of
a fourth which we'll probably at least start today , but maybe
let me begin .
in <O_T> <nineteen seventy-three> , there was a
it involved the challenge of a white law school applicant to a
what do you remember about that case and how it connected to the
I remember a lot about that case .
may I comment first , though , generally on October Term <nineteen
as I went through my notes in preparation for this discussion today
first , it brought me , as a comparative newcomer on the Court ,
I didn't pick and choose those cases .
it seemed to me that there was just a gathering of important cases
the second aspect is that , in a way , I thought the term was a sad
I wrote down a few things .
in chronological order , this happened : the chief justice had his
we were sorry about the thing , but wondered how he could have had
he claimed that a passing automobile had sideswiped him .
he was in physical misery for a while .
then on the <thirty-first> of December , Justice Douglas
I was out of the country at the time , but the word came through ,
thurgood Marshall had pneumonia in February of that term .
we had a memorial for Chief Justice Earl Warren in May , with all
<Mrs> Felix Frankfurter died .
another thing that impressed me personally was the aging of Justice
then on the other side , there was the opening of the old ,
all took place during that session .
it was certainly a learning and a developing process for me , as I
I didn't perhaps realize how much it was at the time , but it hit
the other thing that I didn't mention , and it's rather humorous ,
he loved to chide the chief justice whenever he could , and I found
chief Justice Burger had been interested and I think properly
he was good at these outside things .
he arranged them well .
but they were the sorts of things that in which Justice Douglas
here's a note he wrote .
+" dear Chief , The Christmas parties at the Court have been
+" one on December <twelve> could be initiatory and quiet .
+" the one on December <nineteen> could pick up momentum ,
+" this would consume so much more energy , but with so little to
+" very truly yours , William <O> Douglas .
well , Chief Justice Burger didn't answer that , but this was
well , enough for trivia .
you asked about DeFunis .
as you say , it was the beginning of affirmative action , I suppose
I always felt , from the start , that DeFunis was moot , and took
but it was moot because DeFunis , who was complaining about the
the Court finally held it moot and didn't hear the merits .
I've often wondered what would have happened had it reached the
would it have been different ?
maybe so .
on the other hand , perhaps it's just as well that the Court was
nevertheless , I think justices tend to think about them , sleep on
there are at least two justices whose positions are quite
one is Justice Douglas , who did express a view on the merits ,
bid this strike you as inconsistent with his position in cases ?
a little , but he certainly took a strong position in it at the
it didn't really get into the law books .
do you think it had anything to do with the fact that the case
that's a loaded question .
<mister> Justice Douglas had a lot of loyalty to the
yes , it might have had something to do with him , with his
he was a fascinating , interesting character .
a second person whose vote was somewhat different , or at least the
did you have a sense of how he was reacting at the time ?
well , J think this issue generally was very difficult for Lewis
after all , he was a representative of the southern point of view
he did not have a closed mind , by any means , and I've always
he could have been peremptory in his position ; he never was .
so do you think some of this was his deference to the school's
perhaps .
perhaps .
I think he was torn by the considerations on both sides of the
<mister> Justice , in your own hiring of law clerks ,
you hired one of the first Asian law clerks , I'm happy to say .
you hired a number of African American law clerks , a number of
do you think that you engaged in affirmative action in your own
I never thought of it that way .
of course , a couple of those law clerks whom you've described as
it came out later , perhaps as people began to speak more openly
I'm wondering if your attitudes toward affirmative action were
well , probably , because the scholarship I had to Harvard College
it covered the tuition , but from then on , everything was up to me
of course , one , in those days , could get a so-called passable
of course , it separated me and others in like situations from the
but it didn't do me any harm , I think , in working my way through
it was a little miserable at times , but maybe it shaped me up ,
if you had voted on the merits in DeFunis , do you .
think you would have voted as you later did in Bakke for the
well , probably .
that's about the best answer I can give .
I felt so strongly it was moot , and I didn't waste any time on the
Ina memo , really in your own file notes at the time , you said ,
+" I have some feeling that the passage of the years may lessen
in fact , that hasn't been the case .
do you have any thoughts as to why the affirmative action issue has
well , I think the political attitude of the country shifts back
I had hoped at the time when I made that statement and as you
but with the political swings , it's proved otherwise , and people
right now we're in a conservative mood in the country .
do you think that the affirmative action agenda has been pushed too
well , there are those who say so , and I would hope we could reach
I've been a little overly optimistic about that .
I'd like to turn to the area of the First Amendment , which we've
these few terms , <O_T> <seventy-three> ,
one of the first cases that came along was in the area of
this raised the entire New York Times <v@l> Sullivan
do you have any memory of this case ?
yes , very much so , because New York Times against Sullivan was
justice Brennan , as I recall , had written that opinion , and I
he found a way to solve the dilemma and the issues that that case
now , Gertz presented defamation where no public official or public
actually , it protected the media up to a point .
but the Gertz case initially was troublesome for me .
I guess all these cases are troublesome for me .
I don't take too clear an approach for one side or the other .
<mister> Justice , over time you have become one of the
you are probably more so than , for example , Justice Brennan , who
do you think during that period you've also become more comfortable
at the time of Gertz , you said , +"/.
+" if my vote were not needed to create a majority , I would adhere
but then you say , “A definitive ruling is paramount” , and from
do you think that this has been an evolution that's connected to
I never thought of it that way .
no .
well , I hadn't realized I think you said that I've given a lot
I have always felt that I give very few .
I certainly am criticized by the media for not giving some , and
I don't see anything to be gained by it at this point .
how do you think you've been treated by the media ?
do you think you've been treated fairly ?
I think I've been treated as fairly as one could expect to be
the media , there are all segments of the media , and there's no
even the chief justice can't control the votes of the other eight .
so there are extremes on both sides , but I think , by and large ,
do you think the media itself has good internal control mechanisms
if I understand your question , yes , I think the responsibility of
we have freedom of the press .
I suppose everyone gets annoyed with the press every now and then ,
it's one of the strong points of our democratic system .
there's an interesting connection .
in Gertz <v@l> Robert Welch , the Court decided that actual
the next term , in a case called Nebraska Press Association <v@l>
I'm wondering if you could just comment about that case and how you
well , the Nebraska case gave me a lot of trouble .
as you say , it came to me initially because I was circuit justice
this was a gag order that had been imposed by the district judge in
as I recall , I stayed the order in part and upheld it in part ,
I suppose one can say that I was upheld in part and reversed in
how do you feel when you're asked , as a circuit justice , to stay
does that make you feel exposed ?
well , yes , of course .
I know all these judges , and I think I know how they think .
these are important judgments that we make , and we have to make
I'm always gratified when the situation is such that we can throw
when we act as a circuit justice , it's sort of in between , and
in a case like this , where you have already issued a stay order ,
or do you think in some way you help influence the Court's final
well , you certainly telegraph your initial position and attitude
, you have ruled , and they're reviewing your ruling , but that
every now and then , the full Court will reverse a justice's ruling
after all , we're working on a temporary basis when we issue an
but if we thought about the issue at all , we've telegraphed our
I don't believe it influences the others , influences them the
that case was decided , the ultimate full decision of the Court ,
yes .
did you ever think that you would be assigned that case because of
no , I think he wanted to do it himself , wanted to keep the case ,
now , at the same time , Justice Brennan filed a concurring opinion
so there was an interesting tension between Justice Brennan's
yes .
how did that come about ?
I can't give you a helpful answer on that one .
justice Brennan , of course , was an absolutist on this kind of
I think maybe I was a little surprised that Stewart joined them ,
but it was a very good case .
I don't know as a fact , but I would assume it would be a wonderful
<mister> Justice , over time , in talking about your First
you've adopted a balancing position , but that at the same time ,
do you think that's an accurate statement ?
probably .
probably .
let me turn , with that , to the commercial speech cases , which is
we're moving a little out of chronological sequence , but it seems
I'm wondering if you could talk about each of those cases and how
well , I certainly caught more than my share of commercial speech
there was a feeling and I think still is among one or two
but they were interesting fact situations .
I think Bigelow against Virginia , as I remember , there was
abortions were legal in New York under certain prescribed
I think our discussion there of the possible validity of protection
on the other cases that you've mentioned , as I remember , the
it takes one right into commercial speech .
then , of course , Bates against the State Bar had to do with
there are those who feel that the ethics of the legal profession
I think in Bates that even Justice Rehnquist he was then
that was a five-to-four decision , as I remember , and I guess I
I remember Chief Justice Burger was in the minority , and a couple

I guess the public is pretty smart .
this case brings about another example of the difference between

yes , I think perhaps that's a fair description of the two
