I don't know .
I forgot it .
what happened to the boy and the girl in the story ?
&-um they ordered food .
and then they went to sit down .
and then they went home .
he woke up .
then he spilled the milk .
and then he broke his shoelace .
then he missed the bus .
and then he hadta walk to school .
went back inside the house .
those aliens are going off the airplane .
<and then and then those two are> that one is happy
can you think of anything else to put in your story ?
no
