&~www .
first there was a boy and he had a frog .
and he kept it in a little jar .
then he went to bed and the frog escaped .
and when in the morning , he found that it had left .
he &-er was looking through the boots .
and the dog got his head stuck in the jar .
he then opened the window and was calling for it .
the dog then fell out .
and the jar broke off its head .
and 0 boy seemed pretty mad .
he then went outside .
and they were calling for the frog .
he was looking inside a hole .
and the dog was barking at a beehive .
then a little gopher thing popped out and bit him on the nose .
then the beehive dropped .
and all the bees came out while the boy was looking inside a tree .
and then an owl popped out .
and he fell to the ground while the bees were chasing the dog .
the owl was then chasing him .
and he climbed up onto a rock when a deer popped up .
and it was stuck on his head .
the deer then ran to the cliff .
and the boy and the dog fell off .
he then landed in a pond and started laughing and could hear frogs
he then told the dog to be quiet and looked over the log where he
he then grabbed a frog and waved goodbye to the other frogs .
