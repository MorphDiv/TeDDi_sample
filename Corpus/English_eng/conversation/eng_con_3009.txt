you got it right . 3154_4152
I got it right . 3947_4668
why do you know it's twenty seven ? 4668_6508
it's a seven . 6508_7393
and not twenty eight . 6508_7726
oh_my_go(d) &=laughs . 7726_9420
sorry . 9420_10361
yeah ‡ sorry what ? 10361_12484
how do you know it's twenty seven and not twenty eight ? 12484_15827
&-um because the like right here (..) is always gonna be the same
+< the step number . 26827_27889
like see one two and one stuff like that . 29158_34359
you know like its step number . 34359_37804
+< step number . 36759_37469
yeah . 37804_38801
xxx . 38801_41724
that's really messy . 41724_42706
I don't know if you can read that but +... 42706_43905
xxx . 43905_44750
<and so> and then she was trying to take it a step further . 44750_47243
and I want someone else to actually do it . 47243_48328
so ‡ I wanted to just look at +/. 48328_49782
first of all just a large concept . 49782_53084
what would account for <for any> for any step ? 53084_60085
so ‡ let's say we had step n@l or step x@l . 60085_63771
you can have a xxx of them if you want . 63771_65332
&-um <what would> &-uh how many xxx ? 65332_69474
what would it look like if I don't know how to get started . 69474_71384
what would it look like for step n@l ? 71384_73114
alright ‡ Firstname . 73114_76872
first step for any step . 76872_78607
so ‡ let's just say for n@l . 78607_79891
+< we're trying to figure out the squares „ right ? 78907_80818
xxx . 80818_82237
I just want to see what the picture would look like . 82237_84015
+< n@l times three plus one . 82737_84947
+< what would the picture look like for step n@l ? 84015_86199
oh ‡ well ‡ it would look like the same thing only just +... 86199_92623
it could be any size . 92623_94148
so ‡ xxx . 94148_96233
&=writes . 96233_103492
good job , good job . 103492_105788
+< and xxx one square you can put it . 103492_105793
we have that one square . 105788_107230
+< yeah ‡ one that one square's always gonna be there no
okay . 109660_110065
do you want me to put down the xxx ? 110065_112132
+< formula . 111365_112132
+< and then so how +..? 111732_113063
+< put the formula . 112032_113063
so ‡ &+i the next question then is +/. 113063_114691
so ‡ that's what it would look like . 114691_115751
and so the next question to think about is what would +..? 115751_120792
how many total squares would there be ? 120792_123055
alright ‡ so ‡ how many squares would make xxx ? 123055_126824
go ahead and xxx . 126824_127860
gimme a piece of xxx paper . 127860_129276
(be)cause we've already established that this this box right
we can have one . 134861_136300
and then to figure out this we know that to find the area we do the
times &-um how many there is which is three . 142910_146958
+< three . 146510_146958
so +... 146958_149349
good job . 149349_150432
why minus three ? 150432_151392
<or you could put> or you could put three n@l . 151392_153168
it doesn't matter . 153168_153953
+< it's times . 153168_153953
three n@l plus one . 153953_155254
+< xxx because this is always three . 154254_156511
Firstname did you xxx Firstname's question ? 156511_158705
+< what ? 157511_158205
that's not minus . 158705_159968
that's times . 159968_161358
+< oh ‡ it's times . 160558_161601
it's a dot „ you_know ? 161601_164078
xxx . 164078_165661
+< does this mean times three n@l times twenty times n@l times three
+< why ? 166848_167448
during +//. 167448_167785
because +//. 167785_168272
+< oh ‡ yeah ‡ that's right . 168072_168900
(be)cause whatever the stage number like this is three . 168900_171467
and this is three . 171467_172469
and two is three . 172469_174136
it's always three . 174136_175769
does anybody have any more questions ? 175769_177650
no . 177650_178596
that's a good job . 178596_180404

&=laughs . 187609_189293
so ‡ if you have +... 189293_193081
okay ‡ so ‡ if you have n@l times three for that part +/. 193081_197492
so ‡ this part is my n@l times three part . 197492_201604
and this is my one . 201604_202881
and you could write that n@l times three . 202881_204322
or you could also write that as three n@l „ right ? 204322_205981
that's the same thing one plus three n@l . 205981_208580
+< three n@l plus one . 205981_206907
&-uh &-um or three n@l plus one . 208580_212085
+< either way that works . 212085_213214
+< yeah ‡ <I like> I don't like three n@l plus one . 212085_213981
yeah . 213981_214433
+< any of those work . 214033_215298
+< yeah ‡ that's what I did . 214233_215848
+< &-um <so this is> so ‡ this is what everyone is +/. 215298_217617
+< they all work . 216517_217176
so ‡ what I &+a was asking you to do yesterday is to take it a step
and what I first want to talk about is &-um xxx explicitly . 229510_234139
Firstname said it pretty she said it well in her explanation . 234139_237363
but I wanna just explicitly ask you . 237363_238889
how does that three +..? 238889_241085
&+pa the three times the n@l how does that connect to the picture ? 241085_246107
where does that three show up in the picture ? 246107_249848
where is that three ? 249848_251081
can you answer ? 251081_252395
well ‡ it's you multiply this xxx by three <to get like>
+< the area . 258888_259884
then you have_to add one xxx . 259884_264021
and so that one is +/. 264021_265215
<what is that> how does that xxx Firstname ? 265215_267078
the one is like the +//. 267078_268329
can you go over and point to the thing ? 268329_269598
where's the three and where's the one in each of those pictures ? 269598_273028
&=walks:front . 273028_276833
so ‡ alright ‡ so ‡ xxx one . 276833_280586
so ‡ we multiply one by three . 280586_282256
and we get three . 282256_283944
and you add the one on the top to get like the xxx . 283944_288242
and for two you multiply two by three . 288242_290678
and you get six . 290678_291594
and you add one . 291594_292894
&=mumbles . 292894_295264
so ‡ can you circle the +/? 295264_296442
okay ‡ so ‡ in the rule one plus n@l times three can you circle the
<in the> actually in the picture too . 302284_306506
+< oh . 303284_303889
okay . 306506_306714
can you show it in the other pictures ? 306714_307974
&=writes . 307974_313032
do you all agree with that ? 313032_314040
yes . 314040_314400
yeah . 314400_315001
so ‡ it's just one . 315001_316296
fo(r) sheezy@d . 316296_317720
+< okay ‡ and then can you use a different color and show
&=writes . 323804_333001
alright ‡ thank_you Firstname . 333001_334510
so ‡ do you have any questions about that ? 334510_337658
okay ‡ so ‡ you can see where your rule where that connects back
so +... 344370_346046
yeah ‡ please erase that . 346046_348473
I wanna put something on top of it . 348473_349991
not that I don't like it . 349991_351288
&=writes . 351288_355200
so ‡ if we have +... 355200_362922
so ‡ can I have someone just come up and just fill in the t@l table
and I want you to also think about +/. 367007_368845
yeah ‡ just go ahead and fill out the t@l table as it is . 368845_371080
where ? 371080_372060
+< Firstname ? 371080_373000

yeah . 377472_377977
oh ‡ I wanna go up . 377977_381719
there's two more xxx . 381719_384176
over ah &+eh +... 383219_387258
okay ‡ so ‡ since the <this is> this is the rule . 387258_391509
then you multiply one times xxx to equal three and add one to the
and then two times three is six . 397300_401202
&=writes . 401202_404021
and then three times three is nine plus one is ten . 404021_407296
and then you notice that there's +... 407296_409310
+< thirteen . 407824_408730
yeah ‡ that it grows by three . 409310_411064
so +... 411064_411874
+< sixteen . 411064_412344
then you go down to seventeen . 412344_414245
anyway ‡ it's about the same . 414245_417017
and then you multiply seventeen times three . 417017_418950
&-um which is fifty one . 418950_422719
+< they're xxx . 421251_422719
and then plus one is fifty two . 422719_425508
and then is three n@l plus one . 425508_431043
good job Firstname . 431043_432727
+< do you want me to graph it ? 431827_433399
&-um <I want you> actually I wanna want you to go and enter in
so ‡ if there was a zero step , step zero , what +..? 438482_442534
could you go ahead and put it up above the y@l xxx ? 442534_444545
+< oh ‡ I &-uh it'd be +... 444337_445754
zero times three equals zero plus one equals one . 445754_449040
good &+ch +... 449040_449616
so ‡ all +... 449316_451726
I really adore you . 451726_453127
okay . 453127_455796
so ‡ any questions about filling in that t@l table ? 455796_459299
xxx . 459299_460727
+< that makes sense ? 460227_461039
okay . 461039_461617

can someone show me in the t@l table where does that three show up ?
so ‡ <you had> you've already seen where the three shows up in
+< what do you mean ? 470252_470975
and you've seen where the three shows up &-uh and the one shows up
where does the three and that one show up in the t@l table ? 476380_481904
what do you mean ? 481904_483120
yeah ‡ what do you mean ? 483120_484596
well ‡ we were able to see +//. 484596_486023

+< oh . 490576_491752
this row that I'm adding on right here or this distance right
&+ha &-um you are able to see that the one was just this one that I
the part that was growing or changing . 505261_507305
so ‡ &-um what when you look at this t@l table can you see the
or the three in it . 515428_517648
well ‡ in the f@l of n@l follow its growing by three „ then . 517648_521359
it's growing by &+th +/. 521359_522360
what do you mean by it's growing by three ? 522360_523943
