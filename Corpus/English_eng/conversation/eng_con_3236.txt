okay we're finishing off where we're going to continue from where we were, last class . 22010_30550
so you need to try to be reasonably quick about taking twelve ? 30550_37748
you'll need your books so we'll put today's date . 37748_45643
and the heading . 45643_90266
is that a microphone Miss ? 90266_91343
yeah . 91343_91800
xxx . 91800_93110
no I don't think so . 93110_95200
the exercise we're referring to in the textbook is ten_o_four . 95200_106796
page two two two . 106796_109655
we won't necessarily need that straight away but you will need it shortly . 109655_113613
count twelve each and give me the rest back . 113613_136438
count out twelve each and give me the rest back . 136438_140778
or hand the rest back to the people behind you . 140778_145395
twelve each please . 145395_154376
miss xxx . 154376_156808
yeah xxx . 156808_157461
mm +... 157461_158711
why is xxx ? 158711_159975
xxx . 159975_161775
oh okay . 161775_164573
take twleve each and give me the rest back . 164573_168501
better still, take twelve each and hand the rest back over to these girls . 168501_176388
twelve each please . 176388_181823
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve . 181823_204461
hand them back xxx . 204461_219123
okay . 219123_219676
twelve each . 219676_225373
Lindsey you can take any spares and put them in the box and bring the box to the front, okay ? 225373_231243
all right . 231243_233426
now let's just go over what we did yesterday . 233426_237570
yesterday you had to divide your twleve into different ratios . 237570_245848
let's do one of those again . 245848_247568
or two of them . 247568_248838
let's divide the twelve you have in the ratio, uh +... 248838_256448
five to seven . 256448_262400
divide them into ratio five to seven . 262400_267135
thank you . 267135_269585
so that means that you're going to separate them into two groups on your table with how many in the first group ? 269585_282561
five . 282561_283288
five and seven in the second one . 283288_285861
okay . 285861_287040
what if I say I want them divided into ratio one to two ? 287040_291583
xxx . 291583_293278
no . 293278_301453
six in each would be ? 301453_302906
fourteen . 302906_303685
six to six which would be ? 303685_306270
one to one . 306270_308078
eight in one group and four in the other . 308078_312501
eight in one group . 312501_314543
which group ? 314543_315220
in the two . 315220_317046
groups, so you really should have told me four to eight because remember with ratio the order is important . 317046_328260
now I want you, for what we're moving onto today, to actually make them equal piles . 328260_337255
so I want how many piles altogether really ? 337255_340910
two . 340910_341870
no . 341870_343716
three . 343716_344235
three piles all together and I want you to stack them up so you have three piles . 344235_349803
one on your left, and two on your right . 349803_354698
stack them up so you have one on your left and two on your right . 354698_363290
one two three four five +... 363290_382260
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve . 382260_388871
all right . 388871_390440
so what we actually have there Danny doesn't seem to, but the rest of us should have . 390440_397528
is when we +... 397528_406413
we have three piles worth twelve and you have created one pile of four and two piles of eight . 406413_421118
okay ? 421118_421795
how did you get two piles of eight ? 421795_426840
two piles two piles of four to equal eight . 426840_430910
all right . 430910_432598
so you created three stacks of blocks . 432598_437421
all right . 437421_438101
for the next lot of questions we're not going to maybe use all twelve blocks . 438101_445683
what we're going to do is consider it almost as if it was an empty box . 445683_450691
so we're going to just create, use this box as one pile so in this particular case, if I said to you I want the ratio of one to two you would have one empty box to two empty boxes . 450691_468851
so you would have the ratio or the way you're one is to two . 468851_475593
all right ? 475593_477538
okay, so I want you to see if you can create for me a ratio of one to three . 477538_486346
a ratio of one to three . 486346_493650
how many blocks have you got ? 493650_498640
three . 498640_499343
twelve . 499343_500191
altogether, four . 500191_502546
so you actually would have four shares or four boxes, four piles that you need to create . 502546_513563
all right ? 513563_514559
okay . 514559_516840
what about the ratio two to five ? 516840_521841
two to five . 521841_525223
that means on your left hand you would have ? 525223_528160
two . 528160_528841
two blocks which are empty boxes and on your right hand you've got ? 528841_534623
five . 534623_535463
five which means that you have used for a ratio of two to five you have used ? 535463_543718
seven boxes . 543718_546565
two here and five there . 546565_551703
right ? 551703_554786
follow that ? 554786_557068
yeah . 557068_557745
okay . 557745_559928
what about eight to three ? 559928_561593
