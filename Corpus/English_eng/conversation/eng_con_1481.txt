Jordan's thinking of a football one .
mhm .
and <we also> we donate instead of having presents .
that's right .
but we still get presents from grandma and grandpa and we have a
and you go up in your bedroom .
who ever birthday it is 0does .
mhm .
and you look around .
this is at nighttime .
you look around .
and the hard thing is well +...
he has two lights .
and we we turn on just one light for me because I have just one
and it's not too bright .
mhm .
and we just turn on that light .
we don't turn on the ceiling light .
turn on the not brightest light .
mhm .
turn that on .
and you hafta look with that on .
oh .
so it's pretty much hard .
and then the rest +/.
<and so> it's in your room somewhere ?
yeah .
and you get a map but &-um mom gives these little cards .
and you hafta look around where that place is .
oh .
Jordan kind of helped me .
he reads in the corner of north east west or south .
mhm .
or left or right corner .
bottom or up .
so when you found your present what was it ?
<&-uh well I &+c Jordan gave me this &-um> I have this
mhm .
and on there was tissue paper .
it was white tissue paper .
and I unwrapped it .
mhm .
and there was &-um two &+lit +...
&-um on each side there's two of them .
there was these plastic diamonds and there was pink .

so it doesn't make 0it so unfair to me .
and that was a pony for my dollhouses .
<it was a> it was sugar .
cool .
sugar is the name of the pony .

and Jordans got this pony .
mhm .
it's name whisper .
and it's a Mexican pony kind of .
mhm .
and it has a coat and that's the only coat we have so they share .
well that's a good idea .
you could also maybe try to make one .
yeah .
what do you think you could use to make a coat for your pony ?
I could use pipe cleaner and cut it for the strap .
mhm .
and then I could just make &-like a paper for the back like a cape
yeah .
that's a good idea .
or maybe kleenex .
mhm .
yeah .
that's a good idea .
so you have you got a pony stable for christmas right ?

now is that part of the dollhouse thing too ?
no .
<it's a part> +...
