&~www .
last night I and my dog found a frog and renamed this frog Tim .
and during the night Tim escaped from his jar .
and in the morning when I woke up I could not find him anywhere .
I looked everywhere under the bed , in the boots and even in the
we looked out the window .
and my dog fell and he broke the jar .
which was very angry .
but because I love my dog so much I wasn't too angry at him .
we walked towards the evil woods .
and we shouted and shouted but heard no croaking .
we checked everywhere from the holes to the beehives .
and in the hole an evil little mole came up and bit my nose .
&-um my dog knocked over the beehive .
and we were chased away by the bees .
whilst I was looking in a tree , an owl popped out and scared me .
I climbed to the biggest rock I could find and shouted as loud as
and a giant antelope came up and I was hooked in its horns .
he ran and ran <until we came to> until he came to a cliff
and we were thrown across the cliff into a pool .
when we heard a small croaking noise .
so we hadta keep quiet .
and we hid behind a log to jump over and to see a family of frogs .
and there was our frog with them .
so we took our frog and waved goodbye .
and we walked to all the way home .
