as you will see while &~m gay culture is while male gay culture is friendly toward women queer culture tended to be outright hostile toward women why ? 2575_14035
because &-uh they tended to think of &-uh women as rivals for men's affections and attention and &-uh and just basically got in the way Burroughs even &~w in his way even went so far as to talk about woman as an evolutionary mistake . 14085_32105
this is the same guy who talks about the human virus +... 33585_36705
&~y you may &~r just to go back and think a little bit about Howl you may remember some of Ginsberg's comments &-uh you know where like in this passage the Three Old Shrews of Fate where he &-uh sort_of stereotypes &-uh women as &-uh kind_of like the old hag &-um and he talks about the heterosexual dollar as if there's a &-uh as if heterosexuality is some kind_of a a basic plot &-um +... 40785_70765
and &-um &~a and lastly of_course the very familiar idea &~i &-uh which I talked about when we talked about Ginsberg who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a sweetheart &-uh package of cigarettes and a candle . 77865_93845
as though the woman on the scene was just &-uh one more little item like you got your beer you got your cigarettes you got your woman . 96305_106505
so &-uh in other words a &~f the &~w the woman as kind_of an ornament or &~f or &-uh an ornament <to the> to the male . 106885_115305
kind_of like the the best &~dress the well dressed man hasta be wearing a nice looking suit and he hasta have a nice looking woman on his arm . 115845_125485
&-uh I leave it up to you to decide how prevalent these attitudes still are but you can see how basically blatant they were back in the nineteen fifties . 126045_137305
&-uh Gary Snyder whom we're going to talk about in the second hour today even you know Snyder the thing that makes Snyder the thing that makes Snyder's ideas unique is that he went back to &-uh what what are called primitive cultures and at at the same time that he brought back some very useful and &-uh challenging ideas from examining the thought of primitive &-uh cultures from his study of anthropology . 137905_167885
for example you can see that in some cases he brought with him quite a few stereotypes about women and I &~por perhaps most &-uh again I'll use the word blatant <is the> &~w is the poem called Praise For Sick Women on page two ninety one &-uh Snyder has not only lived to &-uh regret &-uh this poem but is also someone who really has very progressive views on the subject of gender . 174425_204405
now he's +//. 204625_205245
he is somebody &~h who has constantly learned and &-uh changed with the times as he's gotten older but he did write this poem on Beat Reader page two ninety one the female is fertile in discipline contra@s:fra naturam@s:fra which means against nature &-uh the idea that discipline is somehow against nature and that discipline only confuses her . 205765_230785
the poem basically &~c carries that &-uh you know that old+fashioned reactionary idea that the primary purpose for women in life is to &-um bear children and that's what this poem is all about . 231905_251105
&-uh Diane_Di_Prima another San Francisco poet &-uh took him to task on the subject and you'll find her poem on page three sixty one . 252205_263245
&~i actually if you want to &-uh think about women writers in the Beat Generation I &~w I would definitely &-uh recommend &-uh Diane_Di_Prima &-um +... 264105_282065
she &-uh in her poem The Practice of Magical Evocation <she quotes> on page three sixty one she quotes Gary Snyder . 277045_285365
+" the female is fertile in discipline only confuses her . 285825_289445
and she comes back very &-uh very tongue in cheek and very sarcastic by by &-um you_know kind_of &-uh repeating these ideas in her own voice &-uh with a straight face and very ironically . 289245_307125
+" I am a woman and my poems are woman's . 307465_309485
easy to say this . 309605_310665
+" the female is ductile . 311085_312605
ductile@q means pliable , easily led . 312785_315925
+" &-um and stroke after stroke built for masochistic calm . 316805_322465
so she just &-uh &-uh she talks about pelvic architecture functional the context wide and relatively sloppy bring forth men children only . 322785_334325
so it's good to know that &-uh &-uh <she was> &~k she was ready to take him to task on that subject . 334845_341645
that'd be kind of an interesting thing for you to study if you're talking about gender relations and gender ideas in the Beat Generation would be to contrast that poem by Gary Snyder with that poem &-uh by Diane_Di_Prima . 341625_354825
so there's a book called the San Francisco Renaissance by &-uh Michael Davidson and I'm quoting him here the Beat ethos relegated women to the role of sexual surrogate muse or mom . 356165_369925
&-uh &-uh so somebody to have sex with &-um &-uh somebody to inspire &-uh men to do their own artistic work or mom . 370545_383725
obviously this is &-uh very familiar to you from reading On the Road . 383915_388715
&-uh the +//. 389335_391975
his aunt of &~cour <as you> as you know is &~f in the book is really his mother and I don't think it's at all unfair to talk about the Beat Generation as being a kind of boys' club . 392575_409315
as Davidson talks about in here . 410505_412625
&~i it +//.
you remember the part where &-uh in Dharma Bums where Kerouac is talking about &-uh princess and he he says you know well she she wanted to be a a big grown up &-uh Buddha herself but &-uh since she was just a girl the only way she could get in on the spiritual scene was &-um through sex . 413985_439745
well &~y &~h you_know &~i <it would be> &~n it would be nice to think and I do think that that <we have> &-uh we've progressed quite a_lot on on this particular subject . 441675_451375
some people feel as if we still have a long way to go but it's really interesting to go back in time forty years or something and see some of these &-uh gender stereotypes in their really raw blatant form . 451635_467095
and one reason that you see them in their raw and blatant form in the nineteen fifties is that &~th they hadn't reached +//. 467225_474365
society hadn't reached a place where people felt that &-uh there was any reason to apologize for these ideas so you can +//. 475065_483805
gender stereotyping in its &-uh purest and and really most &~s &-uh &~d dispiriting and and kind of saddest form the fifties are a very good time to study those attitudes . 485105_500225
historically women have tended to be the subjects of works of art rather than the creators of art . 500485_510265
the the female nude is a a staple of of art . 510425_516005
this is a painting by Willem De_Kooning he's another abstract expressionist painter of the &-uh action painting school . 516305_524565
and you can see this beautiful painting of his called Woman . 525785_530205
we're gonna listen to another poet of &=sound_clip_set_off_early &-uh &~i I'm sorry . 530855_540775
&-uh I just wanted to bring the volume down a little bit on this . 541575_543855
maybe that'll help . 544035_547035
&-um David Meltzer is another poet of the San Francisco School and here's his poem called Wife . 547675_554955
I don't think this poem is intended in an unkindly way at all in fact it's it's very fond and &-uh and &~k kind &~bu the the interesting thing about listening to it is is how condescending it is . 556245_571705
he's in one room writing his wife is in another room and he seems &-uh more or less possessed with anxiety &~tha that &~h his wife in watering the plants <will overdo it> &=sound_clip_begins the sound quality is just poor . 571835_601815
so &-uh it's another really good example from of of somebody who &-uh who &-uh who writes a poem that certainly has love in it and and as I say not intended unkindly just the interesting thing about it is how how incredibly condescending it is and how unconscious the writer David Meltzer seems to be of his own attitudes . 635825_664485
I want to show you some things by four women painters . 665565_669625
these are people who were part of the New York School . 670085_673065
you know the &~n when you're talking about art &-uh the visual but we're talking about painting the New York School is more or less synonymous with what we've been talking about abstract expressionism and more or less &~syno and abstract expressionism is more or less synonymous with what is called action painting . 675465_694205
&-uh remember when we were talking about <Frank O'Hara> Frank O'Hara was a &-uh literary link between the painters and the writers . 695605_705665
&~h he was &-uh an assistant curator at the Museum of Modern Art absolutely terrific poet you &~m may remember his poem &-uh The Day Lady Died that we listened to in this class . 706725_718165
these people were part of that group of painters &-uh we're talking Helen Frankenthaler Grace Hartigan . 723535_730715
Grace Hartigan did a_lot_of collaborations in &~frac in fact with Frank O'Hara . 731095_735875
some of her paintings she painted the words of O'Hara's poems into her paintings &-uh and then the other two painters I want to show you some things are Lee Krasner and Joan Mitchell . 736295_748075
so <these are> &~a these are abstract paintings obviously . 750385_754765
&-um reproduction is not too bad +... 755585_758445
so what is it about painting I mean just &-uh I don't know if you I don't know if you make a habit of going to art museums but one of the hardest things is really just to look at something . 759185_774705
and &~y you know just look at something and and &-uh &-uh take it all in through your eyes &-uh +... 776985_787105
one of the things that happens when you look at an abstract painting you're always kinda tempted to &-uh you know think about &-uh well if it weren't an abstraction I mean what what does pictorially what does it kind of resemble in &-um in the representational world ? 790665_812625
but I have an artist friend who says that the &-uh the average painting +//. 813665_821025
that most paintings get looked at for an average of three seconds . 821745_826165
I I don't know if you've seen people walk around in an art &~mu art museum just kinda going from one picture to another but I mean it's awfully sad to think that that &-uh that we don't know how to look at things very well . 827305_840805
I just want to encourage you right as you're sitting here today just to look at these paintings . 840925_846165
&-um this is another by Helen Frankenthaler +... 847305_852325
(0.12) when I was talking to you about abstraction in painting one of the things that I mentioned was that +... 864075_872895
&-uh I don't know if you've ever had this &-uh this kind of stereotype about abstract art yourself . 873315_880535
&-uh &~i &~u I was kind_of introduced to it with the idea that an abstract painting didn't bear any relation to the normal &~wor +//. 881625_893585
I_mean you_know that there was no resemblance between abstract art and representational art . 894945_900225
it's not like that . 901165_901985
let me just kind_of refresh your memory about the word abstract . 902085_905045
I think it's best understood if if you look at it from the standpoint that it looks at the world representationally that is as a &~r &-uh seeing what a person would see by looking at the world . 906325_920925
and then it abstracts certain features from that , not giving you the kind_of total photographic picture but giving you some version . 921265_932145
and so what would you think of in this painting ? 933065_935385
<it looks> doesn't it look a little bit like a landscape ? 935545_939005
I mean &-uh &-uh I think that's how &~i that's that's kind_of what it is isn't it ? 939485_947705
I mean isn't this <sort_of a> sort_of a river the banks of a river ? 947885_952765
this is the sky the sun rising &~r +//. 953705_955725
I_mean there's certainly a way of looking at the &~paint painting . 955865_958105
you can just look at it if you &-uh choose to as as just pure design because obviously there are elements of pure design . 958485_968145
because &~w &~i &~i if we're thinking about this this is a river or a lake and these are the banks and there's some hills in the background there's the sun rising or setting or something like that then you say +"/. 968425_979745
+" well what is this ? 979965_980725
&-uh you'd say +"/. 980905_981405
+" well it's a tree . 981465_982085
but if it's a tree why is it that color ? 982225_984865
why isn't it &~th tree color &-uh &~b &-uh so I think when when we look at art like this we go back and forth between seeing it representationally and and seeing it just pure &-uh +... 985045_998365
so that's here's another &-uh Frankenthaler painting (0.8) one of the things you do when you look at art is to just try to appreciate it as &-uh paintings as as pure design . 1001325_1021525
it's a very good way of looking at paintings (0.5) you look at this one right here and you might this part right here and you &~s I don't know it looks like a teddy bear with ears doesn't it ? 1022705_1038705
you know ? 1038845_1039145
&-uh <what would that> why would that be in the painting ? 1039625_1043945
&-uh &-uh it's funny , I look at it and I sort_of see like a ship in there and &-uh water here . 1044125_1054185
&-uh but then let's talk about the pure design elements of it like &-uh bang bang bang those three areas of brown <that forms a kind of> that forms a pattern . 1055945_1068505
&-uh the way the blue here , the blue here , and the blue down here , the way they all speak to each_other , how those are balanced . 1069785_1078725
&-uh typically a painter at work <will talk about> will look at a canvas and talk about well it needs something just +//. 1079665_1089685
or what does it need just like when you're cooking you you taste your +//. 1090025_1094505
the soup that you're making and you &~s you say to yourself &-uh &-uh +... 1094705_1099765
it needs something . 1102025_1103545
and then &~y there's somebody in the kitchen with you and you &~t you get them to taste it and you say what does it need ? 1104185_1110465
and then they'll tell you &-um salt or something like that . 1110805_1115065
&-uh here's Grace Hartigan . 1115505_1117005
this painting is called Moths . 1117765_1119185
(0.4) I mean isn't this a gorgeous thing ? 1123125_1124825
(0.6) I'm really kinda pleased how well these show up I mean computer &-uh digitized art always loses something but this gives you a pretty good notion of what this painting actually looks like +... 1126925_1145965
since she called it +//. 1146905_1150685
&~th the interaction between language and the visual arts is always a very interesting interaction &-uh she calls it Moths and so you when you look at you see moth shapes in it . 1150945_1165985
<you could> you could equally well see it as as design &-uh and if you +//. 1167465_1172485
I mean all these things that I'm talking about I think are things that are happening in our minds as we look at painting . 1173325_1179185
&~i it's just I'm sort_of trying to articulate (th)em and so you're thinking about the relationship between these dark +//. 1180485_1186885
these sort_of blackish blackish brown areas . 1187165_1190385
how these all relate to each_other visually . 1190605_1192885
how these browns or chocolaty browns relate to each_other and then how these kind_of ochre yellows kind_of have sort_of a descending swing down this way . 1193875_1207715
(0.13) but do &~y you know what I mean about looking at things I mean +... 1221115_1223935
&~i I guess <it's a> it's a very common fault to look but not see or just not to look at things but it's a wonderful thing about looking at paintings is just you you have your eyes open and and you this like Ginsberg says seeking jazz or sex or soup . 1226705_1250905
you could &~s add art to that . 1251605_1253345
&~th &~i just painting like this just sort of comes right at &~ra right out at you and sort_of moves right through your eyes into you brain I I think you can feel that happening when you look at a painting like Grace Hartigan's Moths . 1254765_1274285
(0.8) so &~a about a painting like you know they talk about two kinds of painting abstract and figurative figurative meaning that it's about something you know <in the> in the sort_of layman's approach to art well it's a picture of a barn or something like that . 1281635_1297615
abstract meaning what the things that I've just talked about more or less . 1298275_1302935
&-uh pure design &-uh this is obviously kind_of a blend between the abstract and the figurative . 1303835_1310655
gosh what a nice painting . 1311575_1312575
and one of the things that that I don't know if you've ever had any art history or anything but one of the things about &-um one of the characteristics of of &-uh modern art is to approach the canvas as a &-uh one dimensional area . 1313135_1331675
it's just a rectangle of stuff . 1333065_1337905
a rectangle of visual stuff . 1338205_1340165
do you see ? 1340365_1340485
I_mean there's no perspective in this <there's no> there's no foreground and there's no background . 1340605_1346565
<it's all> it's all coming straight at you on this flat plane &~tha that's +//. 1347065_1352225
<if you> <like I> &~a as I said before if you don't have any if you haven't looked at pictures if you don't have a an art background or never taken an art history class that's one thing to appreciate . 1352335_1363835
it's just all one dimensional . 1364215_1366315
it's all coming at you that way visually . 1366675_1368895
<you're not> &~th there's nothing like in traditional art of starting with the foreground and &~m moving by perspective back into the background &-uh with the like warm colors in the front of the painting and the cool colors in the back of the painting . 1368915_1385075
that's something that &-uh modern artists tend to be interested in filling up a a flat rectangle of space rather than creating an illusion of &-uh pictorial depth . 1385255_1396435
Lee Krasner who had the fortune or misfortune of being Jackson Pollock's wife this is a painting by her City Vertical . 1397255_1407935
&-uh obviously again by giving it the title she gave it you're we're meant to think of it not as pure abstraction we're we're meant to think of it as having a relation to the &-uh to cityscape to skyscrapers and &-uh &-uh +... 1408135_1428615
I think &~i &~i <if you> if you looked at the painting not knowing what it's title was well obviously <you would be> &~ex you would be aware of the verticality of all (be)cause it's primarily vertical and then then the &-uh the changes that happen within the verticality like a wider shape that's kind_of bent something that doesn't quite go with the verticals this one that sorta swerves over from one line to the other . 1430325_1456645
and then the play of colors . 1457125_1458225
&-uh the the warm yellow next to the cool blue you know what I mean by warm and cool warm comes towards you cool recedes from you . 1458985_1469485
so &~tr in traditional painting you would have the warm colors the haystack or the cottage or something &~i &~i in the front of the painting . 1469705_1477945
and that would tend to be down here because the foreground &-uh what's closer to you &~i usually is pictured down here in a painting . 1478065_1487165
and then the cool colors that are receding things would tend to go back and they would tend to sorta go back in a triangle like this because that's the way our eyes see something that's in the that's close to us receding to something far back . 1487825_1501645
this painting doesn't &-uh doesn't have an ambition to do something like that but still it's interesting to see the way she put the cool color and the warm color next to each_other . 1501995_1512195
the blue and the yellow . 1513335_1514295
(0.7) here's another Lee Krasner this is a photograph <of a> of a big painting so kind of from the side this is called Crescent . 1515955_1527635
(0.4) and you can see that she's very much concerned with pure design <with the> with the square &~w basically a kind_of a grid laid out by squares &-um intercepted by the &-uh you have basically two two design elements that are working with each_other here the &~sq the grid created by the squares and then the the big curves that work against the grid or complement the grid . 1532265_1561185
see these two elements going against each_other that's another one as I say by &~L Lee Krasner . 1562625_1569745
&-uh now &-uh let's look at a few paintings by Joan Mitchell . 1571785_1575565
you_know one of the hardest things in the world is to &-uh talk or write about art because &~i <in a way &~w why> you_know in a way why do it ? 1575745_1588045
just just look at it . 1588205_1589185
just like music . 1589325_1589765
why why talk about music ? 1589945_1591585
just &-uh just listen to it . 1591905_1593945
but &-um &-um John Ashbery is a &-uh one of the most celebrated contemporary poets . 1594225_1602745
when he was younger John Ashbery made his living by writing art criticism and I vastly prefer his art criticism to his poetry . 1603905_1613045
&-uh because it's so clear . 1613605_1615725
&-uh and and just look how he you know he doesn't use any kind_of technical vocabulary to talk about this painting this is one of the things that Joan Mitchell did which &~w &~a one +//. 1616665_1628005
a choice that Joan Mitchell made which was an interesting choice New York was the capital of the art world &-uh traditionally through the nineteenth century and and all the way up through the nineteen twenties and thirties the center of the art world was Paris . 1628245_1647385
&~a as we know as you know from what you've heard about abstract expressionism the New York school when a_lot_of artists fled Europe in the nineteen forties and moved to <New York> New York became the capital of the art world and it spawned its own movement that movement called abstract expressionism . 1648785_1666985
so Joan Mitchell made an &~in being an American made an very interesting choice when she moved to Paris . 1667425_1673325
&-uh &-uh oddly &-uh by moving to Paris she moved from the center of civilization &~n &-uh &~i in in artistic terms to what was kind_of a backwater sort_of a sleepy backwater in the art world . 1673825_1688545
and &-uh &~m many people have said that &-uh the the kind of rejection of ambition represented by that move to Paris is reflected in her paintings because they're they're more &~th they're not +//. 1689265_1705425
&~y you &~a you're obviously talking about an artist here who who is not setting out to make it real big in the art world . 1706145_1714605
she's somebody who's just &-uh exploring her own view . 1714655_1718335
it's interesting what Ashbery says . 1718455_1720015
&{l=READING it looks strong and relaxed classical and refreshing at the same time it has both the time and the will to be itself . 1720155_1729235
her &~p new paintings continue an unhurried meditation an unhurried meditation on bits of landscape and air &}l=READING that that's a very interesting &-uh remark . 1730115_1741315
&-uh an &~unharri an unhurried meditation on landscape and air &-uh &~h how does air represent itself visually I mean isn't air completely clear ? 1741545_1753825
you_know I_mean can you see air well I guess from a painter's standpoint ? 1754105_1758785
the answer to that question is no . 1759405_1761305
because air does have a certain kind of a a visibility to it . 1761925_1767665
&-um painters are often painting not the objects but the light . 1767865_1773385
and that's what Ashbery's talking about when he's talking about meditation , not on some landscape but on the air as well , the light that is between the painter and the thing that she is painting . 1773985_1786625
and &~th or the light that surrounds those objects here's a kind_of a triptych by Joan Mitchell (0.7) you know some people don't &~l just don't like painting like this at all . 1787585_1805985
and &-uh fine . 1806545_1809345
&-uh &~s seriously . 1809925_1811645
&-uh I don't care &-uh but &-uh you know &-uh +... 1812205_1817865
that's &~n not my business . 1820005_1821165
I really don't care . 1821945_1822625
but if you wanna try to gain an appreciation of painting like this well you've got three rectangles they're all side by side and then you've got these she's put these masses within that within those three rectangles and so just think about it in terms of design . 1823265_1847205
here's this little rectangle . 1847665_1849245
here's this other one over here . 1850185_1851185
&~th this is what your eye does when your eye is looking when you're looking at this . 1852395_1856675
this is the activity that's happening with your eye when you're looking at it and maybe you're just not thinking about it all . 1857595_1865755
okay the &~o she &~creat the overall background is with the paint the the kind of whitish off white paint which is all around the in &~h which covers the entire surface . 1866055_1877155
and then <what does> how does this bounce off that and how does that bounce off that and then what's the relationship visually between that and that ? 1877415_1886215
now you might not be +//. 1887335_1888055
and then what's this in here kind_of a balance this more neutral area is a balance between this and this now you may not even be thinking about that &~a at all but your eye is +//. 1888235_1901835
your brain is thinking about this something your eye is &~m &~th something's happening there between your your eye and your brain you're you're &~i you're registering if you're looking at it you're registering it whether you have the &-uh &-uh whether you can verbalize it or not that's another &~pai another painting by Joan Mitchell and here's here's one just called Weeds . 1901905_1924565
&-uh the &-uh last painting that we looked at is &-uh tremendously cool . 1925055_1931235
this painting is tremendously warm and &~i &-uh &-uh why is it warm ? 1932195_1937875
it's warm because &-uh because it's got a_lot_of warm colors in it it's &~becau alright blue &-uh pure blue <is a> &~coo is a a cool color in other words a color that recedes from the eye . 1938385_1953925
this isn't a pure blue that she uses see she's using a kind_of a purple . 1954665_1958645
she's &~mix mixing &-uh a warm color red with a cool color blue and that +//. 1959485_1964925
she gets this purple and that's why it's warmer than it would be if it were a cool kind_of a sky blue for example . 1965025_1973825
okay so that's +//. 1974325_1975005
I'm just talking about color values . 1975165_1976845
&-um gee these colors this these sort_of &-uh &-uh burnt ochres &-uh brownish &~y orangey kind_of colors they're hot . 1977565_1990545
they're very warm so so they stand out . 1990625_1993825
they come forward toward us a little bit . 1993945_1995605
they stand out a little bit <from the> from the relatively cool bluish purples . 1995745_2002425
&-uh I think it's quite a reasonable thing for somebody to say +"/. 2003005_2006085
+" well what's this painting all about ? 2006325_2008185
well weeds &=laughs she calls it Weeds and so you can think +"/. 2008305_2013025
+" okay it's a picture of weeds it's a painting of weeds . 2013125_2015445
+" she set her easel up and painted some weeds . 2015605_2018225
&-uh on the other hand you can just ignore that title and and think of it as pure design . 2018415_2024015
<this is> &-uh this is the that kind of double way of looking at something that you're almost always that you almost always find yourself in when you are are are looking about art . 2024255_2036975
so &-um so these are several &~w women artists Lee Krasner Joan Mitchell Helen Frankenthaler Grace Hartigan &-um here is another notable we already talked about Billie Holliday here's well here's actually I'm a little bit ahead of myself this means field in French so here's another Joan Mitchell &-uh I mean &~i I'm kind_of giving you some ideas about it but God isn't it beautiful &-uh &-um it sure is beautiful on my screen . 2037575_2067555
&-um just those vibrant blues and then the little the you know the the dark &~bra background of the blacks and then this little dance of these hot kind_of brown browny oranges . 2071855_2087115
&-uh I'd like for you to listen to we listened to Billie Holiday I'd like for you to listen to another female singer of of the era . 2088435_2099795
Sarah Vaughn +... 2101205_2102245
and maybe we can convince Sarah Vaughn to &-uh sing something for us here . 2103185_2114225
(0.10) I was &-uh &~l driving in the car yesterday listening to &-uh Ella Fitzgerald sing Sunday Kind of Love and my son who was in the car with me said said yeah isn't it interesting &~s &-uh Ella Fitzgerald sings I Want a Sunday Kind of Love and Billie Holiday sings Gloomy Sunday . 2124445_2143285
&~i &~i really if you know those two singers it really sums up the difference between &-uh the bluesy despairing &-uh pain . 2144165_2153965
&=start_audio_clip here's Sarah Vaughn . 2155565_2156445

so this is a &-uh the the skit here is a an uncomprehending &-uh journalist is interviewing a jazz musician named Shorty Petterstein . 2371825_2384925

I &-uh I'll be right back .
yeah I can xxx those &~or of you who are jazz fans isn't it incredible what Herbie Hancock is playing on piano on this ? 2837555_2866935
you know you probably know like Headhunter and &-uh Watermelon Man and those things that &-uh when &-uh &~l later in the sixties when Herbie Hancock and in in in the early seventies when Herbie Hancock was doing the kind of funk &-uh stuff that made him rich &-um like Watermelon Man and and and that album Headhunter . 3040505_3063605
amazing how lyrical and beautiful &~a beautifully he's playing on this . 3064155_3068775
(0.5) this is the &-uh this is Miles Davis you know &-uh Miles Davis went &-uh into that kind of jazz called fusion and &-uh this is right at the period +//. 3072795_3085255
this is the last album that he made &-uh before he went into that period . 3085495_3090055
I think it's the most . 3090375_3091335
your mic's not on .
oh my &~w my mic's not on thank you . 3093785_3095565
&-um <this is the> &-um this is the last album that Miles made just before he went into the &-uh &-uh electric kind of fusion period I think is the album that &~pr &-uh precedes Bitches Brew . 3096705_3114145
so it's kind_of the last of the old Miles . 3114605_3118625
it's a really really beautiful beautiful album . 3119275_3121875
an incredible &-uh Tony Williams on drums (0.6) it's called Miles Smiles pick it up . 3123655_3134455

alright now we're going to go back and talk more about Gary Snyder &-uh Dharma Bums and so forth &-er Earth Household +... 3170995_3185355
could I get you to give them all these pencils please thank you very much . 3190055_3195135
(0.15) so those of you who are in the very very select group and you know who you are and if you don't know what I'm talking about then you don't need to even listen to what I'm saying but those few of you who are in that very very select little group don't forget one o'clock today okay ? 3209625_3230085
and here's the man that you're going to connect with and you know all about that . 3230205_3235165
and I just wanna make sure that you know how to get in touch with John on email . 3235785_3240265
because questions you_know &-uh remember that I'm giving out the take+home exam on Thursday and you're taking that home and doing it over the weekend and turning it back in on Monday . 3240845_3252085
&-uh &~th this is how you can get in touch with John on email . 3253025_3257645
so more about Gary Snyder &-uh isn't it interesting how people look I mean it you know &~i isn't it interesting that &-uh this is how Kerouac describes him . 3259665_3270345
he wore a &~s little goatee strangely oriental looking with his somewhat slanted green eyes . 3271045_3277245
I_mean isn't it interesting how people +//? 3277385_3279265
&-uh I_mean &~i you know since Gary Snyder was going to turn out to be someone who had a great interest in &-uh &-uh in &-uh Japanese &~ch Chinese literature Asian philosophy &-uh since he was interested in in those cultures isn't it interesting that that there was a little bit of something in his appearance that would kind_of remind you of the of those cultures ? 3280185_3309325
I_mean &~y you know it's it's an odd thing . 3310175_3311435
I don't know if you believe in reincarnation or not . 3311555_3313675
&-um I just &-uh came up with a little information sheet for you about Gary Snyder's poetry . 3314455_3319935
with &-uh most of this is &~b being covered in in our classes on Gary Snyder but this these might be interesting to you and and please give me back the extras . 3320855_3331155
(0.5) it was the wiry suntanned vigorous open quality of Gary Snyder that really appealed &-uh to Jack Kerouac I hope that information &~sh you'll find that information sheet useful &-um +... 3337735_3352475
now the there's an &-uh every &-uh you know every generation every &-uh &-uh artistic movement every social movement has kinda certain defining events I might think about for the &-uh &-uh antiwar &-uh political movement of the nineteen sixties it would be the nineteen sixty eight democratic convention in Chicago for the introduction of modern art in America it would be the Armory show in New York City . 3355695_3385675
&-uh for the hippies it would be Woodstock for the beat poets the defining event was something called Six Poets at the Six Gallery . 3389785_3401865
&-uh Kerouac &~i &-uh describes this in Dharma Bums and he's talking about these poets who all get together +//. 3402945_3412205
I'm looking at page eleven Dharma Bums the other poets . 3412425_3416005
he's talking about how he liked Snyder better than he liked these other guys because as you know &-uh Kerouac didn't have much use for people that he described as arty types or intellectuals or &-uh or Bohemians he &~de defines Bohemians on &~p a Bohemian on page ten as a hanger_on_er@n around the arts . 3416515_3441975
did &~y did you ever &-uh stop and wonder where the word Bohemian comes from ? 3444345_3449005
&-uh well Bohemia was a province of what used to be Czechoslovakia . 3449565_3455865
and when they were going through their political troubles in the mid nineteenth century a_lot_of &~th Bohemians people from Bohemia moved to Paris . 3456805_3465625
and they were kind_of an artistic group and <other people hung> other people interested in the arts hung with them so they &~ca became known as the Bohemians and that's why we call them that to this day . 3466345_3480645
&-uh and in the nineteenth century there started to be &-uh really for the first time &-uh an opposition between +//. 3481065_3489125
what ?
between the avant_garde the underground &-uh people who were hip &-uh as opposed to the establishment people who were straight &-uh mainstream values of all kinds in the arts and elsewhere . 3490325_3509065
and it's it's it's it's interesting that &-uh that distinction between the ingroup and the straight group has continued and we &~s continue to use the word Bohemian . 3509465_3520885
&-um Ray Smith describes the other poets on page eleven the other poets who were participating in this event called the Six Poets at the Six Gallery . 3521805_3531625
the other poets were were either &~h horn+rimmed intellectual hepcats with wild black hair like Alva Goldbrook or delicate pale handsome poets like O'Shea or out_of this world genteel looking renaissance Italians like Francis_Da_Pavia . 3532065_3549725
now we're not really studying the San Francisco Renaissance poets but if we were you would &-uh learn that Francis_Da_Pavia is a surrealist writer named Philip Lamantia and &-um &-uh &~bo &~bar bow tied &~wer wild haired old anarchist fuds@n like &~r Rheinhold Cacoethus . 3550785_3575225
now Cacoethus his he represents &-uh a real life character named Kenneth Rexroth . 3575165_3582365
Kenneth Rexroth &=begin_sound_clip this is Kenneth Rexroth reading one of his poems . 3583285_3588345

(0.46) and that's Allen Ginsberg as a young man as you can recognize . 3696645_3700765
&=end_sound_clip (0.6) I just wanted you to hear that kind of as an example of &-uh how bad it can get . 3701225_3712445
&-uh &-uh but the funny thing is that Rexroth was really quite an expert on jazz I mean &~i Rexroth understood stuff about jazz he's a great writer on jazz &-uh &-uh I mean &~i his his &-uh insight that in modern jazz ornamentation replaced melody &~it it's a kind_of a simple idea but once you cop to that idea then you really understand something about modern jazz . 3712605_3741045
&~im I mean I'm thinking about &-um when &-uh &-uh Charlie Parker will be playing a tune and he'll get kind_of interested in one +//. 3741485_3750765
in a little embellishment and then he'll sort_of leave the tune behind and just start &~r running variations on that particular embellishment it's an important thing to understand about jazz Rexroth was in many ways a very admirable character I mean he started off as a labor organizer in San Francisco it's one of the +//. 3750825_3770125
San Francisco is one of the early kind_of &-uh &~l labor hotbeds because the longshoremen there were were organized in to unions &-uh Rexroth was a &-uh an anarchist &-um he he &~di he did beautiful translations from Japanese and Chinese &-um his &~hundr One Hundred Poems from Chinese is really a terrific little book and and One Hundred Poems from Japanese they're &~r they're really worth reading . 3770385_3799665
but there must've been something about Rexroth you can tell from the name Cacoethus that Kerouac gives to him it's not very complimentary there was something about &-uh Rexroth that that must've been slightly unpleasant anyway he's a +//. 3799825_3815685
&~w as you study literary history you're you're you ought +//. 3815965_3819365
they're they're they're figures they're the kind of figures that get &-uh remembered like &-uh Kerouac Burroughs Ginsberg and then there're people that not too many people know about like Kenneth Rexroth or Philip Whalen they're they're sort_of off to the side they're &~f &-uh +//. 3819805_3835965
Kenneth Rexroth was the emcee at this reading called Six Poets at the Six Gallery where &-uh Howl was read for the first time and a_lot_of the poems by Gary Snyder that we're studying were read by the first &~ti were read for the first time . 3836395_3851655
and and one of the really interesting things about reading Dharma Bums side by side with &-uh Gary Snyder's poetry is that <you can> you can &~s +//. 3851855_3861255
&~the there was Jack Kerouac , &~i you_know &~j Jack Kerouac , &-uh going out buying big jugs of of wine and bringing (th)em back in and passing them around and encouraging the poets when they read by &~i &-uh you_know standing in the back of the room yelling +"/. 3861815_3877895
+" go go go . 3878375_3879195
&-uh at the same time he was obviously taking notes on the readings so his accounts of the reading +//. 3879835_3886615
it's very interesting to compare them to the actual poems . 3886875_3891455
so for example in &-uh Dharma Bums on page fourteen when he's describing this event which turned out to be a historic event he talks about &-uh Jaffee reading and his anarchistic ideas about how Americans don't know how to live with lines about commuters being trapped in living rooms that come <from poor> &~fell from poor trees felled@n$part by chainsaws showing here also his background as a logger up north . 3890945_3920925
well all you have to do is turn to The Back Country page four &{l=READING the chainsaw falls for boards of pine suburban bedrooms block on block will waver with this grain and knot . 3922755_3934035
the maddening shapes will start and fade each morning when computers wake join boards hung on frames a box to catch the biped in &}l=READING that's a passage that I talked about last time but &-uh what's the difference between &-uh the &~w &-uh the way the poem is in Snyder's lines and and the &~po the way the poem is in Kerouac's view of it . 3934665_3958765
really I'd say the word poor because if if anything &-um &~i if there's one thing you can say for certain about Snyder it's that he was not sentimental . 3958985_3970005
he would never talk about the poor trees felled@n$part by chainsaws . 3970765_3974565
Kerouac did have a sentimental streak and that's just that you can see that one word that's the difference &-uh says a_lot about the difference in sensibility between these two characters because &-uh Snyder doesn't moralize that's one of the &~h he has kind_of a cold objectivity . 3975035_3994995
&-uh also you may remember the class that we did on Buddhism ? 3996275_3999695
&-um so &-uh Ray Smith says he's sitting &~i you know outside the little cottage that he shares in Berkeley with Alva Goldbrook IE Allen Ginsberg &{l=READING old rotten porch slanted forward to the ground among vines with a nice old rocking chair that I sat in every morning and read my Diamond Sutra &}l=READING so it's kind_of interesting to look to the Buddhist &-uh scriptures themselves and see what the Buddha was &~s was saying &-um the tatha@s:fra gata@s:fra . 4000465_4030445
Sanskrit's a really interesting language . 4040165_4041845
I recommend it to you . 4042045_4043625
&-um gata@s:fra means to_go@q . 4044385_4046705
I think I was telling you or I_mean &~i that's the root I was telling you about that &-uh &-uh that sutra@s:hin that &~g that goes &-uh gate@s:fra <gate@s:fra para@s:fra> gate@s:fra para@s:fra sam@s:fra gate@s:fra &-uh in other words gone completely gone thoroughly gone . 4046885_4065965
that's the same that &-uh GAT that root right there is the same as the &~r for the English word go@q . 4066205_4075425
and what tatha@s:fra means thusly and so &~i okay here's the name for the &~centr here's the Sanskrit name for the central figure in this religion okay ? 4076485_4087825
Let me &~j you see what I'm talking about it's like they would &-uh like you'd say the Lord or &-uh &-uh the Messiah the Son of Man the different names that we have for religious figures what do they call the +//. 4088605_4103465
&-uh in Sanskrit what do they call the Buddha tathagata@s:fra it &{l=SIC leans &}l=SIC literally the one who goes like that . 4104065_4111425
it's &=laughs really an interesting term see because it's an interestingly kind of neutral term the one who goes like that . 4112355_4118855
I mean <what does> what does that mean ? 4119015_4120535
&~i &~i &~y you it's something that you really couldn't understand without having &~a &~a an intuitive inner understanding of the tradition itself of the Buddhist tradition itself . 4120735_4133695
but this is &~sh &-uh &~w something think back to the class that we did on Buddhism the Dharma or law universal law which the Buddha has fully known or demonstrated &~i this is what it says <in the> in the Diamond Sutra &{l=READING it cannot be grasped it cannot be talked about it is neither a Dharma or &-uh nor a non Dharma &}l=READING . 4134065_4157705
&-uh &~e this this &-uh sutra@s:hin has that typically elusive quality of &-uh of so many things in Buddhism sort_of like &-uh &-uh &~a &~a and remember what I was talking about about Taoism how how how much Zen Buddhism derives from Taoism ? 4157945_4176105
kind_of like if you have to &~a it's sort_of like they say how much does it cost to buy and maintain a yacht if you have to ask you can't afford it . 4176505_4184845
it's the same thing &~i in in Buddhism if you or Taoism <if you> &-uh if you don't get it there's basically no point in asking about it it's just kind_of a particular knack and what's what they're talking about in in Taoism when they say &-uh the way that &~cu that that can be grasped is not the true way . 4185115_4207955
&-um the highest truth is like water . 4209095_4211715
it flows &~e everywhere but &-uh &-uh it it it doesn't have a kind_of a a substance to it a verifiable +//. 4211905_4221025
you can't go out and buy yourself a a half ounce of the Tao . 4221565_4227525
it's not a substance . 4227805_4228785
you know it's something that's &~y you can't explain it . 4229125_4231645
and &-uh &-uh that's I guess that's the thing that makes Buddhism particularly Zen Buddhism so &-uh fascinating and at the same time so frustrating for a_lot_of people . 4231785_4242285
and &~i and you know from reading this book that &-um Ray Smith the Jack Kerouac character is intensely frustrated by the idea of Zen . 4242565_4252585
he's much more comfortable with the old+fashioned or Hinayana kind of Buddhism that he has learned out_of books . 4252805_4259125
why ? 4259755_4260035
because it's all kind_of laid out and then secondly because it's much closer to Catholicism that he grew up with so he can understand it better . 4260355_4269855
so &-uh <when you> when he talks about reading the Diamond Sutra that's the kind of thing that he's reading the the &~r fascinating thing about Gary Snyder for me +//. 4270255_4279495
this is taken from The Back Country page five . 4279715_4282075
is that &~i being &~in as intensely interested in the spiritual life as he is he also equally loves the the world of Samsara . 4282945_4295145
you &~r may remember that Samsara means the wheel of birth death and rebirth . 4295445_4301185
and &~i he's talking about a pregnant woman &{l=READING belly stretched taut in a bulge breasts swelling as you guzzle beer who wants Nirvana ? 4301865_4311165
&}l=READING you know &~i this is so this is so &-uh &-uh kind of well we used to say essency . 4311545_4319825
you know it's just so kind_of earthy and real and and of the essence of of life . 4320585_4327605
&-uh I mean what what could be more &-uh representative of the just pure full out thusness@n thisness@n itness@n of life than a pregnant woman drinking a bottle of beer ? 4328525_4343705
&{l=READING here is water wine beer enough books for a week &}l=READING so that's the thing &~y you're talking about &-um &-uh that this interestingly balanced and integrated personality of Gary Snyder somebody who's very spiritually inclined but also someone who loves the things of this world very much now &-uh &=addressing_micase_researcher &~d I hope you're not gonna be &~fu &~pu feel put on the spot but could you just give us a little announcement . 4344955_4371135
yeah &-um I'm gonna give you the short version we have a little thing that we normally read but &-um this class is being recorded and if anybody has any objections or any questions about the project that I'm working on feel free to ask me about it after class . 4371635_4383655
does anybody object ? 4385115_4385675
okay good thanks . 4386315_4388135
okay your welcome . 4388715_4390475
I mean no I don't see why anyone anyone would object &-um &-um one of my real favorite poems by Snyder is this one called &~h &~it it's called How to Make Stew in the Pinacoti Desert it's on page twenty eight in The Back Country . 4391005_4407825

all that growth that went in to to make that tree that hisses in this fire that you're building . 4713945_4720845
and then &-uh he just thinks about the rock &~s Sierra granite Mount Ritter Black Rock twice as old he he's just contemplating the geological lives of all this rock out_of which the trees have grown and then &~w he's thinking about fire . 4721505_4740105

I'm having you read the prose book Earth Household side by side with Dharma Bums and The Back Country . 4787505_4794645
&-uh I called your attention to the subtitle of Earth Household Technical Notes and Queries to Fellow Dharma Revolutionaries . 4795625_4804905
&-uh Dharma from Buddhism revolution from Marxism . 4805545_4811705
so it's an interesting &-uh coalescence between Eastern thought as represented by Buddhism and Western thought as represented by Marxism . 4811905_4826165

now that we're living in a post Marxist post Communist world I think it's very hard for people &-uh of your age to understand the power that Marxism carried at its height because you see Marxism represents itself as being &-uh scientific . 4851325_4870105
and therefore its ideas had the cachet of historical inevitability . 4870865_4877385
that's why when Nikita Kruschev talked at the United Nations he took his shoe off and pounded the table and addressing the American ambassador or or American representative directly he said we will bury you . 4877845_4894025

that sense of &~h the historical inevitability of Marxism has just about disappeared from the human scene . 4910405_4916785
but in the fifties when Snyder was writing he felt as if the revolution was definitely coming . 4917365_4924105
and <when he> &~sai when he talks about notes and queries to fellow Dharma Dharma revolutionaries he's addressing himself to a group of like+minded people who feel that the revolution is inevitably coming . 4924565_4936865
and what can we do to make the revolution be the kind of revolution that we want it to be ? 4937445_4943685
&-um &=start_sound_clip I'm kind_of flipflopping back and forth here between the serious intellectual political spiritual side of Snyder and the more &-uh kind of laid back &-uh &-uh earthy side . 4947135_4970515
