this story was about a man .
he was standing in front of this place of business with an unlit
the policeman was coming down the street .
and he was checking the doors of all the businesses .
and he approached the man .
and the man told him that he was waiting on a friend of his to come
they were supposed to have their meeting after twenty years .
or whatever they were supposed to have been meeting .
so anyway, his name was +...
what was his name ?
I think his name was Bob .
one guy's name was Bob .
I guess he was waiting on Jimmy .
so anyway, he told the policeman he was waiting on this friend of
and the policeman left .
and the man still was waiting .
and they had .
a man came across the street towards him .
and he asked him was he his friend Jimmy or whatever .
he asked him was he Bob .
and he said he was or whatever .
so then the man .
I remember the man lit the cigar or whatever as they was talking .
and he asked him how was New_York treating him .
I think it was New_York treating him since he been gone, or
so then they was talking awhile .
I'm going to make this short, okay ?
so anyway, he said that the guy was taller than he remember him .
and this guy had said that he grew after twenty years .
after twenty years, he grew some more or whatever .
so anyway, then I remember that at the end the police said .
I mean he was arrested .
the guy was arrested .
and he said the police said that he recognized his face from
and then he didn't want to arrest him for something .
so he went .
and got a plainclothes policeman to arrest him or whatever .
anyway, that's going to be it .
this was years ago .
I had this dream .
and it was about cats .
and these cats were like humans .
I mean you know they was the same size as people were in clothes .
and they talked like people .
and I remember it because I went next door to this house that was
and it was a cat that was a girl cat that was the same size I was .
and I was a child .
I might have been about eight or nine years old .
and then there was a cat that was the same size as my my daddy .
and it was I guess, I'm (gonn)a say momma cat too or whatever
but anyway, these cats were talking .
and it they scared me .
and so I started running home .
and they started chasing me .
I started running home .
so then when I got home I was trying to run up the steps .
but as soon as I got up to the steps I couldn't even raise my foot
and then I woke up .
then that was weird .
that was real weird .
I mean that was a frightening dream as a child .
