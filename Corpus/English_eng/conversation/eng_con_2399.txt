I want to speak about required work . 0_3823
That's required of you if you're in this seminar .
Whether or not you're enrolled, whether you're auditing or enrolled
I'm kind of an academic commodity, you all know what that can be,
So I want to get serious about our meetings, and that means that I
There is on reserve, or there is at something called top copy, a
It's inexpensive . 70953_81934
It was drafted by me and Dave Sudnow and it's called “A Conjecture
it has written across it in block letters “an exercise” .
not my exercise, It's an exercise for the seminar . 81934_98701
It was drafted with two things in view, that you would use it to
So in the way in which it's purported in this document that
I mean by that that when you come to read the document you'll catch
And all that's being asked is that you keep your notebook nearby
That would then make it possible for you to speak with me about not
And that will make our conversations go really easily . 210599_214822
You can't go wrong, there's no way in which you can go wrong . 214822_218312
There's no correct answer to learning, I mean, you're forgiven all
You can say that we're all trying to get hold of this thing, at
And so I'm asking you then to range around in this place, looking
Now, when we get together on Thursday, I'm going to go through that
I'm not going to do it today because I'm not sure that, well I
But I am going to assume by Thursday, that you have picked it up
Not you needn't have studied it, it's nothing like a mastery
Now I'm going to ask that you buy not one copy but two . 311708_317394
One copy is yours; and one copy is going to be mine . 317394_322365
What you're going to give me in return for the work of the course,
That annotated critique is going to come from your own witnessing
So, it's not going to be enough for you to make big things like
But you can say “I went into a lecture where introductory physics
And that would be a very nice comment, it'd be a helpful comment .
You could say “I found the following hard to see”, or “You say it
One big thing for example that's continually being reiterated in
those that we treat of the lecture, from the properties of the
That is to say, ethnomethodologically-speaking we couldn't find its
Remember these are in situ productions . 467263_470754
That's not the same as simply wandering in with your checklist and
So, it could be then that you would find grounds for
Better than that, he's not even lecturing in chemistry, lectures
He's doing chemistry when he's lecturing . 499680_502523
And that in so lecturing in sociology is not lecturing in
So the proposal then is reiterated throughout, that if you want to
And that's literal . 550318_552263
Now you might find yourself at first mystified by that, and if you
You will work your way out of the mystery by conjuring issues out
You'll make believe there are issues in ethnomethodology and then
Look, do it for somebody else, not for me .
Or do it after I'm gone for George or any of the other characters
And try wherever you can to say “from what I could see, which were
You can get plenty mean, in fact the really mean ones are mean in
That means that the meanness there is utterly serious, by which I
And since this work is in flight that is, sometime in the next
Okay, now can I have, I'm sorry to be such a xxx but can I have a
Oh, then can I go through the preliminary so that you'll be going
That is, if you go looking in the document, you're not going to
Part four is more or less puerile but part three is serious, and
The problem with part three is that I thought I had the notion of
And then the other day I had a vision, right, and now I think it
That's not really true; it's that I have some further things I want
By the way, in part two a lot of observational stuff is given with
That's not what the conjecture is about . 821778_835195
It's true that that stuff is happening . 835195_838204
But the conjecture has to do with an orderliness of lectures as
That would include as well lecturers' own xxx accounts of their own
So what the conjecture could provide for as this overlooked
But it's with that that the conjecture is concerned, not with the
It's not that . 899879_901907
Now then, secondly, on page six you'll find that square brackets
Those square brackets are formulation marks . 915574_918516
It's a technical usage . 918516_920926
Since we're talking about the in situ production of the orderliness
it will be dealt with as methodic practice, where the orderliness
What that does is to pose as issues, as problematic phenomena, what
Now the formulation marks are intended to give us technical access
You can compare the idea of technical access with vernacular
You can compare technical access with the access that you get under
Now then, where do you go looking to get more on formulation marks ?
Harvey and I wrote an article years ago called “on the Formal
It's published in McKinney and Tiryakian .
It's on reserve .
Now you can look at it in there, or I'm sure an arrangement can be
It's a pretty good article, but a lot of people go into the soup
But I don't want you doing that, I don't want you discouraged by
However, there are places in there where formulation marks are
Excuse me, what does the “n” stand for ?
Oh look, the “n”'s are simply foot note marks .
As I had them marked off, the idea that some day when I'll get back
Are there further questions on that ?
Then one further remark, and that is: On page eight and nine,
The notion of structure and the question of what structures could
Let me call your attention to three distinct usages of “structure”,
What you find on page eight is that it provides for encountering
And these are provided for in the parenthesized a@l b@l c@l and
Now let me give you three contrasting ways in which the use of
Number one, by the way I'll quickly .
let me just give you their names . 1310336_1316505
The idea of a@l generally is spoken of with the notion of “the
In any case, we get the first of these rationalities, that the
Sir, could you repeat the last ?
I will not repeat the last, its in the paper, I'm just perking
You don't even have to understand them at this point, because
I'm simply trying to give them something like a &=sigh we'll get to
Big point: Look, for a@l b@l c@l and d@l, now consider that there
Number one, you could start with these four properties as a
And if there now are innumerably many practical constructions,
I want to refer to that procedure and to the resulting notion of
Those are structures .
you can think of now, activities in the world available to the
Now then, that's a meaning of structure . 1524243_1531706
You can now, go looking for lectures, pre-deciding about lectures
A preliminary definition, for example, of what an opening could
A preliminary definition of where a lecturer will be found to stand
I'm going to call that “providing for structures via the procedures
you can think of it another way, you can think of it as Husserl
So a naturalistic version never mind it's a version, a
Thursday we'll take it up in better detail after you've had a
That might not xxx too much to ask of you, but it's a short week
But if you can try it out, do so .
It's very simple to decide a counting procedure . 1634064_1646548
Okay now, what's the feature ?
The feature is that you start to begin with with a definition of
So you're exemplifying, in that you're elucidating the sense of
Not in your head those things you have as a way of testing and
Now there's an alternative, a second, a second version of
Now remember that we're working with this document . 1702223_1706879
Here, what you'll do is start with those bracketed phenomena .
They're already accountable, they're already, so to speak,
That the lecture has begun, so to speak, is a members' way of
It's not trivial that he would say “look, it's begun”, or it's not
Okay, so we're talking now about starting .
this is now a second version of structure . 1754009_1760426
We're talking now about starting with the bracketed phenomena, the
If you take a look at that document you'll find there's a whole
Now if you begin with the phenomenon as of which the bracketed text
Or questioning if it's doing questioning or describing if that's
Now then, it's with respect to such phenomena, we'll call them the
You can address the accountable phenomena with those four things . 1846806_1854369
And you can say or here's what you can be proposing . 1854369_1858841
You can require to detect structure that whatsoever the accountable
So it's not uniform, repeating and cohort-independent in a
But “uniform” would have to do the kind of thing that “late” is,
That's to say, you would then be finding for uniform or repeating
you would be finding not what those properties are, but they would,
How do you determine what's bracketed ? 1947784_1952304
Don't ask me, I'm not going to tell you now .
Thursday, everything comes apart but to today I want only to call
At this point I just want to put you on notice look, there are
I'm not putting your question aside, I'm just saying it's not in
Now then, there's a third version of structure . 1986368_1991405
I'm going to give that third version of structure a name, I'm going
I'm going to speak of it as the mundane accountable structures, and
Now I can tell you about it in a formula, like a maxim, it goes
In that and in the way the work does that and thereby the work
And “structure” refers to that reflexive work . 2110237_2117302
When Weinstein speaks of truck drivers' work, he says of the work
You could say that the work could be undertaken and could then, in
And a concern with structures for truck drivers' work is a concern
Other ethnomethodologists have provided, to various depths of
Perhaps Harvey's work on the turn-taking organization of
It's without precedence . 2251893_2254903
There are other systems as well, that have succeeded in various
Now lectures, on Thursday I want to go into these structures,
Now the thing that I'm kind of beginning to enjoy about the paper
I'm surely not going to state it definitionally, because if it was
But it could be that we could hope that via the month's work, to
That would be the point . 2318041_2320087
Just one further remark and then we'll proceed to the rest of the
You can treat it as materials standing in the notebook, there's one
On Thursday I'm going to make a lot of it, I'm going to call it to
Does anybody who's read it have any idea what's omitted ? 2355762_2360566
What would be the thing that, Jesus, if you're ever going to
xxx subject of the lecture ? 2366818_2371771
Well, yeah, you're in the territory . 2371771_2377142
You know, I'm the one that knows the answer, I'm setting the
Questions, and dialogue with students ? 2383850_2386001
Questions and dialogues with students ?
That would be interesting, but, no .
When I tell you you'll say “of course” . 2386001_2394929
Okay, anybody have any idea ?
I'll tell you: students' notes, right ? 2394929_2408178
That's one side of it, lecturers' notes is the other . 2408178_2411271
They're not at all interchangeable objects . 2411271_2414197
There's some mention of lecturers' notes; there's no mention of
Students' notes I'm going to offer to you as something you'll want
I mean you're practitioners, and here you go . 2431919_2434030
If I require that of you, or if ethnomethodology's inquiries
We have a lot of stuff to look at that point . 2442273_2445733
So that observational stuff, as I say is to be treated as field
Now, I want to pass around this, let me speak of it as a roster .
I looked at your descriptions of your prior preparations, stuff
I want more than anything to talk to those people in here who want
In order to get that part of what we could be doing in the weeks
It'll be a very quick pass and all we'll be doing in the office is
In effect, I'm looking to do a lot of talking with you on a
So would you, if you're interested then in speaking with me about
Are there any questions ? 2589418_2594307
Just one question; and that's about the exercise .
I've been sitting in on an organic chemistry class since it
You've already done a lot of this so are there any suggestions you
I mean, it'd be really nice to make videotapes of it or +... 2594307_2634371
Oh, I think it'd be damn nice, too .
I think it would be a pretty nice thing to do . 2634371_2638759
My suggestion would be, look, team up with others, get yourself
but see him beforehand and say look, for the kinds of things that
Because it's not something you could spoil by knowing what we're
The responsibility will be on you and you'll soon see that I'm not
Better than bedtime stories, you're keeping him amused for the
Or you're talking like you're talking let's say with the use
not that they're entitled to use but that they must inevitably talk
So then they could talk, knowingly, in the way they do, with each
You must talk . 2726286_2732800
So, what you'll find then is that there's no way out, you can't
But you can nevertheless make him uncomfortable, he might not care
xxx the advice ?
You want nice detail or you want the possibility that you could get
What's less of a thing to do is simply to make a tape recording of
It's not a bad thing to do .
What the tape recording will show you is how critical the looks of
If you make a tape recording, then what you'll find is that you'll
the only thing is you'll find yourself increasingly departing from
So it's not a bad incongruity procedure . 2842276_2847711
That's another way of getting at it . 2847711_2850554
For your present interests I think it would be enough if you don't
Find a companion, at least one, and as quickly as you can get
Then keep record, or just write . 2874776_2879813
That will assure then that when you come to do something with it,
That's the first thing you want it to do, you want it to turn into
Rather than it you'll be searching for the gold in what you're
Particularly for the ethno detail, it simply doesn't lend itself to
We're not doing conventional analysis, which does lend itself to
Now I want for our remaining meetings to take you through materials
At our last meeting, I gave you a précis of what that manual could
My interest in the beginning, as a way of starting things off, is
I think of the studies as being concerned with the practical
So if you have to ask, well, you know, what is it that our
In our last meeting I think I characterized for you, or did in
Let me give you just a few more details on that issue . 3054635_3061950
Sometime around nineteen sixty seven, or starting let's say, it's
It will appear to shut people out of this work and that's a
So I mean by the ethnomethodologists, the studies done by those
I'm speaking of ethnomethodologists as persons whose studies I
Before we're done, I'm going to distribute that, it's a
That list may then mark the end of ethnomethodology as a
But in the meantime, I'm using ethnomethodologists not as a
Nov, it was since nineteen sixty seven that the ethnomethodologists
Those studies were initiated by a few peoples Sacks, Schegloff,
Two currents come from those initiatives . 3228160_3238585
In one of the currents, the early initiatives are pretty well
In the second current, the earlier initiatives then provide motives
Whether the ensuing studies are conserving of these early
That's the import of a rival version, an import, a way of finding .
Now whether they're one or the other, when the subsequent studies
That when in fact that set of studies is treated as, formulated as,
As it's seen as the achievement of that course, under that reading
And that new phenomenon then is found via that device . 3427371_3432326
It's not found differently than via that device . 3432326_3438110
And therefore the proposal of the discovery is then linked to the
That's the import of that historical course, rather than it being a
Of course it's a brag, because it's a departmentally-administered
You get yourself employed or fired in accordance with whether or
Alright, then the point is that it can be seen to have been working
The name is “naturally-organized activities”, that's the name of
There is now at hand an extensive corpus of studies . 3504100_3510676
For the time being, in order not to make matters too complicated,
Don't think thereby that “empirical” does anything but raise
Think of it as empirical, thereby +...
okay never mind getting complicated, put quotes around it . 3528065_3536676
Do you really want to get fancy, put brackets around it but
The idea nevertheless is that there is now a corpus of studies that
Described is another tricky one but it'll do . 3569361_3579602
Now the point, as a matter of shop work, as a shop maxim: The
It's itself to be used and is only usable as part of the local
The corpus then provides, it comprises, a structure of inquiry and
Nov then, the claim: Our lectures, that is, the ensuing meetings,
And I want to do it by presenting the materials of this manual and
And the sections then will comprise as parts, that claim, as well
I think I now see the answer to a question that I asked you the
At the time, you said you would like to put that question aside
You're not going to be able to do these methods without seeing what
I'm really feeling the deficiency of the teaching, of my teaching .
Here's the deficiency I'm feeling: I should, three or four months
Otherwise, short of that, then it would look as if I'm being cute,
That's awful talk, God is that awful . 3872765_3877000
I mean, coming on from the head of the table, it has then to sound
And then what would I say ?
Well, look, I'm talking the best I know . 3896645_3901033
So the deficiency, the honest to christ deficiency in the pedagogy
Maybe we can make it up .
If you do the stuff with the lectures, you can gain a little time .
In the course that meets on Monday and Wednesday, I've first thing
That's another way way to get access . 3929246_3945807
Now, I want to describe for you what I think of as the principal
And I want to make available as best I can what the claim consists
There is a certain set of interests in the study of the structures
I have no recourse except to characterize what those interests
I'll characterize it in two ways . 4066514_4072847
As a first characterization, I just want to list for you some
That's one way it can be done . 4081624_4086500
And then I'm want to run through a list of shibboleths of what kind
That is, what kind of properties they have been found to have in
It's immensely bad stuff I'm doing but that's alright, it's
Let me give you some examples of what kinds of things that an
In conversational turn-taking, Sacks and company have described in
The specifics of those descriptions are the specifics of
So we're not speaking about naturally-organized activities and
Now there's another case . 4223696_4227854
There's a phenomenon that's been spoken of as a game with rules . 4227854_4234503
A game with rules is a game which, if you ask a person how he play
It has other characteristics as well . 4242882_4247021
But there is a for games of rules that have been studied, in a
Except that I don't want you thinking in class terms, or in terms
In a play of the game with rules chess is a game of rules,
That collection use as a catalogue, exhibits of itself, in the
The completeness of the collection depends then for definiteness,
Of course they can be listed, but it's in the open character of the
Now that's an organizational object, let us say “all the basic
All the basic rules of the game not for a chess player, but as the
And to have progressively attained, via actual materials, such
So if we have that of the catalogue, all the basic rules of a game,
Only in the studies of games with rules are these ways of talking
In that way, you could even think that what I'm doing in laying out
Probably a stronger way of saying that I will speak of it . 4469090_4487959
If you understand how that index, how the stuff you're writing down
Now let me give you another example . 4515073_4524416
In some queues, there is a witnessably-evident anonymity of the
The work of formatting in queues is the work of arranging the
And their positioning is not abstracted from their place in line
It's identifying for the members of the queue of the really “what”
In that sense, or with respect to such proposals, they're “doing”
But that's vernacular talk, it won't get you technical access to
But that's an aside . 4652989_4654303
Now, it's with respect to that phenomenon of the preservation of
Now then let me review it for my first set of characterizations . 4701449_4705356
What I meant to give you in these characterizations is the proposal
Instead you have to think the things . 4738904_4741830
The trouble with giving you the characterizations is that these
The examples are not examples other than the work that's in hand by
I'm not making a brag, I'm talking about a technical feature of
Not any example, then, of organizational objects will do .
We don't have a general definition of organizational objects that
It's not that you couldn't find illustrations . 4785885_4790923
Of course you'll find illustrations, what they'll do however is
But instead you'll be engaged in a kind of monkey business, in a
The teacher says there are naturally-organized activities, here's
That kind of the very lowest level of theoretical enterprise . 4814977_4822691
It's captioning the stuff you could dream up . 4822691_4826598
So I'm trying to make ethnomethodology's work available to you at
Look, it's not a route to go, hut instead when I speak of examples,
I can tell you right off that that in itself is one thing to assure
That is to say, they draw a lot of fire . 4881125_4884949
And the charge that it's a cult sometimes goes to this point, that
I find that charge to be really strange . 4907809_4911532
The parochial character of, the sheer conceit of the profession,
So that means that what we're faced with is the sheer
It's not that they're horses' asses, it's that they're responsible
And they have a body of work practices, but in the character of
Well, what the work of ethno now shows without question is a clear
It's possible to be doing technical studies for which that way of
You can't talk of the Sacks and Schegloff stuff on conversational
It will get you no access to what they're finding out . 4985800_4997596
You can't go into Harvey's office and say “I'd like to compare
He knows that in his bones . 5012475_5015967
In fact all the people in conversational analysis know that like
well, where is the work you've been doing ?
Let's see that as the grounds for our coming together on that . 5015967_5032059
And that is found frequently to be an arbitrary requirement .
As if they're being cold, or they're dodging, or don't want to
It doesn't have to do with that, it has to do with this very
And since it's to be found out in and as the technical character of
It doesn't mean that persons are ignorant or have bad brains or bad
And indeed it consists of the technical practice of not being able
And no way of introducing it . 5108614_5110808
Another version of that is: Look, for the structures of ordinary
You know they're always imaginable . 5110808_5122030
They're available in endless renderings of the practices of
But then for what's imaginable, it's imagined . 5127715_5130808
And that's what it'll get you: what can be imagined . 5130808_5135213
The thing about the structures of action as we're encountering
It's discoverable, only discoverable . 5146984_5151555
So you then have to know the ways of finding it .
That's the point . 5151555_5158520
Okay, that's a characterization then of some of these
I was going to give you another characterization but I think that
If I need to give you this list of further shibboleths, for
But I'm afraid that if I do, then +...
Oh, never mind the “because”, it's a xxx way to do it end I'm not
I've given you some .
Now I want to get ahead with now saying further what the tasks and
In order to specify the discovery of naturally-organized
I want to give it the very this is a a lousy way to talk but
I guess what I'm saying is that the name of the radical heart of it
So it's the missed orderliness of ordinary organizational objects,
I'm going to specify that as a next step in our discussion . 5327675_5342287
The task of making this claim of the discovery specific, and the
That is to say, to specify the completely and essentially missing
To make of that, that is to say, an achievement of analytic
It's not the consequence of social theorizing as you find it in the
So it's not that it misses it and that's its fault but, rather what
That's the phenomenon in hand, the thing that we have to be
So it's for the work of ethnomethodologists, the technical thing of
For the work of social theorizing, there'll be features galore
It's on these grounds that I've said that ethnomethodology and
It happens that a lot of us grew up in sociology departments .
That is, we came on the discoveries out of a knowledge of the
But many persons are now coming to them out of the knowledge of the
But then the professions particularly the academic departments,
The professional schools are increasingly finding access to these
There isn't a chance in a pig's ass that it can be confined to
And the further you get into the studies, the more you find that
They're friends, xxx , they'll arrange conferences, pay a little
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be putting you on . 5659015_5661210
The fact of the matter is that there's no way that any of us can
And there are grounds enough, as we'll soon see, for advancing that
Well, let me then provide that the aims of the manual, the aims
I mean to work out those aims via the sections or the various
There are five sources with which to get access to that missing
