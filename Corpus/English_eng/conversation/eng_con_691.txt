and he's him and his dog are curled up on the bed asleep .
the frog is escaping out_of this jar .
and then it's the morning or whenever they wake up .

the boy and the dog woke up and looked off the bed into the jar .
<and saw that> they're both quite upset because they saw that

and the dog is looking quite worried , while the little boy climbed
I like this story .
an owl came out_of the tree .

and all the bees out_of the bees' nest started chasing the dog
the owl starts flying off .
and the little boy climbs up towards this rock .
the dog's gone with the bees somewhere .
the owl perched up a tree in the top lefthand corner .

the stag laughs at them , it looks like it anyway .
and they two make ripples everywhere and that .
but suddenly the dog is on the boys head .
and he listens for this sound .
and they're next_to this what looks like this hollow log .
he thinks the frog might be in there .
&-um the dog is you can only see his tail and head ,
and the boy is signaling for him to be quiet .
they look over the other side of the log both of them .
and on the other side of the log they can see two big frogs sitting
what looks like a mother and a dad whatever .
<they both> the dog and the boy sit on the log .
and look there's lots_of little froglets@c just <next_to them>
he picks up his frog and starts wading back across the pond .
and all of the frogs and froglets@c apart from one sit up on top of
+" goodbye .
