two four two one fourth . 770_4470
turn right . 4990_5500
one fourth . 5660_6140
on the left . 6780_7390
okay . 8270_8510
hold on . 8850_9090
this was the up down flip . 9480_10630
and I'm turning left one fourth . 11000_12540
one fourth . 13620_13980
one more fourth . 14240_14670
&-um so what did you really do all together . 15950_19070
two . 19420_19530
<or two> or two two four . 24460_27500
because she actually Vanessa solved it . 28340_30380
we just need to review what it was . 30570_32860
she did . 32880_33150
the first thing Vanessa did was an up down flip . 33640_38140
and then she turned it to the . 38510_40060
okay . 42100_42300
and then you changed your might have decided to go left . 42320_45110
how much . 45380_45750
two fourths two two fourth two fourths . 46500_49290
and . 50500_50630
so an up down flip . 52240_53070
and then turned left two fourths up down flip followed by then turn
two fourths . 64780_65500
does somebody think they have a different way to manipulate that
oh two fourths . 69340_70470
it wasn't one fourth . 71450_72140
&-um this is Jenna's beginning core course where we're running
Nicole you think you have a different way . 76220_77620
oh <wait wait> wait I promised . 77730_78940
Amanda did I see you with your hand up 'cause I was gonna let you
what can I do to Jenna's beginning course where to make it look
uhhuh . 97460_97590
I'm gonna turn it . 97870_98600
lemme put my chalk down which direction . 98650_101070
right . 102380_102500
how much turn right . 104370_106770
one fourth . 106970_107490
the left turn left one fourth . 107980_110530
isn't that quite right . 115920_116530
let Kelly do it . 119780_120500
well do you still have your idea . 120790_122850
Nicole go on . 122870_124110
can she go ahead first 'cause she was after Amanda . 124590_126450
this is the starting flip . 128250_129509
diagonal flip . 130669_131420
how do I do . 131530_132270
a diagonal flip . 132390_133660
you take the blue corner and flip it . 135330_138330
so the blue corner . 138810_139930
and turn left one . 149390_153700
good job . 158660_159020
nickel . 159090_159490
let me just write that down diagonal flip . 160370_162740
and then turn left one corner . 166660_168970
and we'll test that again to make sure that we wrote down the right
some of you I think maybe weren't watching watch Nicole's move . 176970_180070
please . 180120_180220
I can see watch this demo . 180640_182230
I'll try to stand so that you can see . 182310_183710
remember . 183960_184070
this is what she's trying to get to . 184120_185380
she did a diagonal flip . 185980_187750
taking the blue corner and flipping it through it was to the green
and then she turned left one fourth . 192830_194750
okay . 198110_198380
Kelly you have still another way . 198540_200460
mhm . 200480_200750
gosh . 200910_201150
you guys are good . 201310_201740
this is the starting position . 202270_203420
we're starting to lose the sticky on the tape . 203520_205300
so we'll have to move on to turn . 205460_207310
left three four . 208110_209540
turn left three fours one two three . 210030_215500
it got the blue where you wanted . 219020_220430
it . 220480_220580
didn't it but what's not where you wanted it . 220840_223220
the green . 223900_224910
the screen . 225420_225860
yeah good . 226220_226980
try though . 227060_227470
guys and ladies . 227970_228430
excellent job . 228920_229340
finding three ways to turn &-um or flip or a combination of turns
last one . 238670_239340
please look at Katie's core square . 239580_241300
this is the core square Katie designed as_soon_as I sense that
then we'll share some ideas . 254480_255600
this is how it begins . 256610_257709
but if she wants to get the courseware in this position what would
what would she need to do . 265070_266020
Alex what are you thinking . 266430_267380
an up down flip . 267950_268830
an up down flip . 269370_270350
I'm gonna try it . 270960_271740
you watching . 271980_272460
I'll slide a little closer to this one . 272610_274020
da . 274540_274710
did it . 280650_280870
do it . 280920_281150
I know he could do though . 282160_283600
no not quite green . 284460_288230
it got the greens to the right position didn't it . 288380_291300
but when we check up there left blue right red . 291500_294310
and here we get left red right blue . 294420_296700
and that's in there . 297140_297870
oh good . 298740_299510
another combination of moves . 299620_301550
here's the up down flip . 302130_303220
what would you do next . 303390_304020
Alex . 304150_304320
sideways . 307140_307490
flip the right . 307710_309860
okay . 310580_310700
well would it matter if I went right or left . 310920_312870
no . 313220_313390
sideways flip . 315400_315860
did it work . 322100_322430
Alex . 322600_322750
did it work all right . 324220_326050
watch that again . 326240_327230
watch that again . 328050_328780
this is how Katie began her courseware . 329750_333060
this is how she designed it to look . 333080_334750
Alex's idea is to do two flips first and up down flip . 335420_339910
then a sideways flip up down flip sideways flip . 340430_346630
very good . 349030_349470
yeah good job . 349830_350590
that was our first Alex that was our first time today that someone
so first an up down flip then a sideways flip . 356190_362380
okay . 363790_364030
who sees a different way or is visualizing a different way to start
Kevin yeah . 374250_374890
okay . 375630_375870
Teddy did I just see your hand up for a minute . 376700_378340
I would love for you to tell me how I can move or turn that &-um
right up here . 394660_395180
so .
you can see how it looks . 395460_396220
so . 396300_396410
sorry . 396520_396640
that was an upbound flip . 396720_397950
turn left one . 401510_402190
turn left . 402690_403220
one fourth . 403340_403820
didn't the blue . 406540_408710
he wants it . 409820_410440
yep . 414060_414230
but it's in he got that blue corner where he wanted it . 414280_416870
wanna rethink that one . 417310_418220
Teddy here starting position . 418240_419620
we gave other people chances to rethink . 421580_423330
Paul we're up here and in this direction . 424150_426860
Ashley and Paul I need you to scoot in closer Teddy this is
and we'd like it to look like that . 431940_433790
what would you like to try . 434350_435260
turn left . 442750_443330
turn left . 446090_446620
two fourths one two . 446900_449940
yep . 452820_452980
good job . 459310_459700
Teddy turn left . 459850_462460
that's nice . 465260_465720
gonna clap . 465890_466250
two fourths . 467500_469030
was there another suggestion for this one . 469820_471820
it starts like this . 471860_472910
and it needs to end up like this . 474390_476460
Atu . 477220_477420
flip it one time . 478550_480110
flip it . 480670_481140
once up down . 481930_484910
flip . 484960_485150
up down flip . 485620_486350
okay . 487000_487110
that was the up down flip . 489390_490620
do another up down . 491140_491920
another up down flip . 492560_493780
down up . 496670_497210
flip up up down . 497430_499640
left one fourth . 508510_509420
right . 514669_514860
okay . 517340_517460
so this was your up down flip . 517539_519340
and then an up down flip . 519679_520500
and then an up down flip . 520659_521640
turn right . 522500_522860
one fourth . 523100_523429
&-uh two . 524380_525140
okay . 530210_530420
hold on . 530690_530890
ask Gretchen what four flips one two three four . 531570_537420
and then can you tell me the turn again . 538170_539550
it's kind of hard to see what you want . 541730_543130
can you put it closer there there . 545340_547190
uhhuh . 547290_547550
so I'm just sliding it . 549000_549780
I didn't flip it or turn it anymore . 549840_551510
turn it . 561670_564090
nope
