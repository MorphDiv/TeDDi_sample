&~www .
last week I was sitting down looking at a new baby frog in a little
I went to bed that night , and a frog escaped .
in the morning , I saw that it wasn't there .
I looked in the shoe .
I looked out the window .
and then my dog , with the bowl on his head , fell .
and the bowl smashed on the floor .
I was very cross with him .
we went i(n) outside and called .
we looked in holes .
and a little rodent came up and bit my nose .
I looked in the tree .
and then the bees started chasing my dog .
and they knocked me over .
we went up to a rock and called from the rock .
and then a deer came and took me between its horns and carried me
it dropped me into a pond .
we we were dropped next_to a log .
and I said +"/.
+" shh .
to the dog .
and we looked over the other side .
and there it was with lots_of little baby frogs .
we took a baby frog and waved goodbye .
