well &-uh they can't . 88790_89670
they . 90630_90830
to . 90940_91000
Alex had said dressed in that . 91760_94890
he liked Brittany's 'cause he thought Brittany was an experienced
Alex said this . 103430_104110
he said . 104220_104550
it looked like an experience . 104600_105630
he he liked Brittany's of_course or &-uh her two by two because
and she's good at this . 116990_117950
and Brittany <yeah yeah> yeah Brittany yeah . 119140_122990
she was like . 123060_123470
and . 123580_123750
he's probably he's so smart to be . 123800_125070
he probably . 125300_125720
knows he's gonna have to count on her for help during . 125800_128340
this whole tv . 128910_129370
and that she's gonna keep him on track . 130090_131420
keep him on track . 131650_132260
he's smart . 132710_133260
he knows when a compliment will pay off . 133420_135310
I mean and it doesn't mean he was insincere . 135860_137540
but I am betting that he was thinking ahead to like . 138060_140790
she'll keep our group . 140860_141820
organiz . 141990_142180
organized . 142200_142440
and she'll . 142620_143070
know what to do . 143120_143540
and if we pick Brittany's design she'll help me make sure that I am
he &-um I'm so impressed with the way that Alex did the thinking
yeah I mean I'm not surprised . 159080_159860
his group didn't &-um choose his . 159880_162860
but he did &-um an excellent &-um an excellent job . 163030_168470
thinking through that . 168750_169460
he has come so far . 169700_170980
I know he wasn't even started . 171240_172220
but he sat down . 172300_172900
he got that down . 172920_173940
he wasn't even sure what he was supposed to do . 173960_175710
he originally thought he had to copy one of the designs that's up
I'm like . 181260_181460
no it's your chance to design your own . 181520_183140
oh well then he was very excited by that . 183330_185140
uhhuh . 185210_185320
&-um and he got his original core square down is not on his . 185860_191220
desk . 191240_191490
oh and that . 191540_192450
high . 192740_192830
it his probably is here . 193340_194260
&-um he &-um got his first core square down . 194480_198180
oh that Ashley same color scheme . 198200_200140
he got his first core square down . 200220_201860
and he had that all &-um planned out . 201880_204500
and then I said . 205060_206300
what do you wanna do . 206320_207070
this was his original one right there . 207160_208780
what do you wanna do for this one . 208870_209900
oh a sideways flip . 209970_210780
and before he glued anything down he could tell me where everything
which for Alex I think is amazing . 214330_216100
yeah . 216190_216350
and he was able to say the red rectangle would be here . 216500_218500
and he goes . 218520_218790
and these will be over here like this . 218840_220660
and this will be here . 220860_221700
he was able to do that on the blank grid . 221940_223500
and then I said . 223520_224020
what kind of movement do you wanna make in in this section . 224040_226540
and he said . 226660_227020
well right turn one fourth . 227040_228980
and then . 229580_229900
okay . 229920_230110
and then that you saw us talking through that a little bit . 230160_232030
if you have to imagine this one turn to the right . 232440_234220
and he had to look at it on the paper for all the first three times
he had to keep physically manipulating the paper and kind of
and then kinda looking down here and figuring out where it would go
but after he had done that for these first two sections then he was
and &-um like he knew where the red and orange rectangle we're
and then I said . 254080_254540
well how will they be arranged . 254560_255590
and he looked at and he goes . 256100_257180
and he laid (th)em out right like this . 257320_258300
and I'm like . 258320_258720
great . 258850_259019
how did you do that . 259220_260019
and I didn't know if he had you know turned his head or how had he
and he . 262960_263140
goes I just looked at this section here . 263200_264900
and I imagine doing a right turn one fourth . 265100_266940
and that would be here . 267600_268180
and this would be here . 268260_269180
and then he put (th)em right there like . 269260_270920
whoa . 271080_271360
and then he did the same thing with this more complex arrangement .
he just looked here . 274420_275020
and he goes I knew that the red orange one would move to here . 275040_277340
and I put that here and under it would be the orange and the orange
and then here he decided to do a sideways flip again . 282700_285020
so he just had to copy this one down to here . 285130_288260
which actually there's one reversal there . 288360_290910
but that doesn't surprising . 291380_292860
but Alex did some really good talking and thinking about that today
and even Brian yes didn't get finished . 297020_299500
and part of Brian's difficulty today was from he chose as a color
and he had a very hard time telling the difference between those
yeah . 311070_311130
and part of it is the construction paper is made so that it's a
oh so one side of the red orange paper does look more orangeish . 317740_322100
and one side of the orange does look a little more red orangeish .
yeah . 325710_325890
and but he was even having a hard time telling red from red orange
and that was just &-um you know a better color scheme for him . 330300_334020
could it probably been blue green and yellow green or &-um the
but he he worked at that . 338330_339620
and he &-um I saw you guys having the conversation over there about
did they ever find any core squares . 345580_348180
that &-um . 348200_348670
well &-uh Danny kept insisting that that there there was a
she didn't really realize that there were two core squares in there
&-uh Brian thought the course square was right in the middle . 356260_359180
I .
heard him say that . 359750_360250
and I was like . 360340_360790
ah . 360870_361350
I never could quite get to where the course square is . 361120_363870
although he did say at one point &-uh something about &-uh . 364080_367580
well I guess maybe it doesn't have to be in the middle . 368390_370490
but we couldn't really get him to point out . 370960_372300
and that was hard . 372400_372880
'cause that design does have two different ones . 373390_376180
and that wasn't one where we had designed it . 376290_378340
that was just you know something filters do too . 378360_380460
we there was a pattern in a book . 380480_382100
and we made a sample and show with the colors . 382140_384020
we had it made that . 384230_385700
&-um and that was just you know a different . 385780_388020
and I was amazed at how as Brian's finished our here Brian's is
I think it's this . 395320_395770
is it this . 396340_396780
it's this because that one's the it's very accurate . 397340_399980
it's very neat . 400430_401260
and you know he is one of the only kids . 401820_403830
I don't think there's a single part on this project that Brian had
and that is not true for other kids . 409600_411030
this was all triangles . 411080_412220
and they were arranged in different ways . 412260_414660
and yes you had a model . 414930_416030
but visually taking that model apart and finding your spot like . 416520_420070
okay I'm holding this . 420170_421260
but where am I even when they did the design one row at a time
and through some testing we've been doing recently we found that
which is why he's having some of the troubles that we see him
uhhuh . 438170_438470
&-um and I mean in other areas too but in math visual memory and
we're sorting through how &-um how he's doing with the the word
but those were the two weak links . 448260_450100
and for a kid who's struggling with visual memory . 450160_452540
even finding his spot in that sample and knowing which one to put
there's that one place that he had to . 456710_458620
&-um and his is one of the neatest ones in the whole class . 458660_461460
mhm which is amazing . 461480_462500
yeah . 462900_462980
&-um so what . 463280_464060
what &-uh . 464250_464430
that was really good . 464910_465660
that how . 465680_466220
did you discover this about his visual memory . 466240_468700
how . 468860_468940
did you the Ld teacher &-um did a whole battery of tests . 469080_471950
oh okay . 472220_472250
'cause we were trying to decide whether &-um we should refer Brian
uhhuh . 476560_476770
and we won't be referring him 'cause he's simply not far enough
he could never qualify . 480140_480940
now it doesn't mean he's never going to qualify . 481670_483030
we're finding those our learning disabilities he has . 483210_486450
but right now they're so mild by the Federal standards that they
and his older brother is in the program and is much more moderately
so he's on watch . 497740_498630
and he's on one of our at risk kids . 499520_501180
we're watching him . 501250_502030
but we're tracking down that most of his big problems at the
I mean if a child could qualify for those things self-motivation
Brian would qualify because he's truly not very confident at all in
it's too easy for him to psych himself out for all those reasons .
he knows what his older brother was going through . 529750_531230
and he's and he came here in the middle of last year not even
and and through an intensive &-um work with his first grade
he made a_lot_of progress . 539420_540620
but he got very dependent on that one-on-one situation and that big
and he just he it's real easy for him to convince himself that he
so but he's taken a big jump in the last month or so in all kinds
&-um so I'm . 555710_556940
really hopeful that the last half of the year we can really &-um
now that we know what they are and getting caught up . 561590_563060
but for someone who struggles with visual tasks . 563220_566590
especially remember . 566690_567270
