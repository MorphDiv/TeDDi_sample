think about what character you feel connected to the most, in their perspective of what happened in that situation with the flowers . 295_7755
okay ? 8455_8695
so let's turn now to the character perspective on page five, you should be there already, right next to the reader's theater . 8915_16795
and what we're going to do in partnerships, we're going to have one character and we're going to use the text to find evidence of their perspective . 18425_31885
so what the first thing you need to do when you're with your partner is read all of the choices . 32165_37105
so you'll do that with your partner . 38165_39405
and then you'll go back into the text and you'll underline where the evidence is on the decision you make of what perspective . 40225_47745
it looks like each character has three choices today . 47905_51005
okay ?
so let's get into our partnerships . 51925_54205
and if you remember who your partner is, if you don't remember, you can check with me . 54765_59945
and we'll do this for about five minutes or so . 60505_63205
okay, find a spot where you can be side by side so you can see the text .
you want to be side by side with your partner so you can be looking at the text . 63425_69625
so we have three choices . 86345_87785
Nick thinks that he would like to become a park ranger and help protect our parks and roads . 88265_94685
Nick thinks that so many visitors come to national parks, that strong regulations are needed to protect them . 95225_100445
Nick thinks that because the national park is so hard to get to, that it's acceptable for visitors to take some flowers . 101025_112445
let's go back in the text xxx . 112885_113785
if you look at paragraph, wait, if you look at paragraph sixteen, it says for Nick's line, it says, I think the rule is there because so many people visit the park . 117785_132225
if one kid gets away with picking flowers then everyone will feel that they can break the rules, then the parks will be ruined cause there's no flowers left . 132525_139065
so I think it's the middle one . 139665_142765
yeah, that's what I thought because it kind of goes . 142875_146115
he doesn't go out and say any of these basically . 147475_151015
we know he doesn't want to become a park ranger . 151915_156675
(be)cause he never mentioned that . 156935_158015
and then it's basically between the middle and second . 158815_161015
yeah, but he doesn't think it's acceptable for visitors to pick flowers . 161835_166455
true . 167055_167395
so let's, we have to underline, so we can underline paragraph sixteen . 167545_171845
I think the rule is there because so many people visit, if one kid gets away with picking flowers, then everyone will feel like they can break the rules . 171965_177585
then the parks will be ruined and there will be no flowers left . 178265_181165
then we can just check the box off . 181965_183305
all right, we're done . 183605_186225
I think that's all we can xxx . 187745_189545
so do you agree that we should underline but she knew he picked the flowers to make her happy ? 203505_210105
my mom would be really happy if I brought her flowers . 211145_215525
don't his intentions count at all ? 215845_217985
I think he should have just been warned . 218665_223485
he didn't know he was breaking the rules . 224145_229445
so the second one is ? 231665_234665
that one says Marco thinks that his mother was sick, and he would save his money to buy her flowers instead of stealing them . 236045_243605
doesn't make any sense . 243845_244545
okay, which one should we do ? 246585_248065
xxx doesn't make any sense (be)cause he didn't say that . 263315_265295
it's the first one because the other two don't make any sense . 268095_272215
because the national parks are so hard to, that it's acceptable for visitors to get take some flowers . 272675_277755
yeah, that doesn't make any sense that it is acceptable . 277755_281375
but in the text he said that it was not acceptable . 281755_285255
so it's true, cause he never said anything . 285655_289295
and that's like the only one that makes sense . 289315_291135
yeah . 291715_291975
her, him . 292335_293135
it never said anywhere in the text, I don't think, that anybody wanted to be a park ranger, when they, to become a park ranger, to help protect our parks . 293835_304855
he didn't say that because, yeah . 305395_311955
xxx what is this xxx ? 324195_324815
you're supposed to, you're supposed to, okay, she pairs you up with who you're supposed to think what's their perspective, like what they think . 325235_336695
so you're supposed to, so they assign you with who you have to choose and you choose out of three of these what they're, what they think . 337095_346115
and you check them off and you can do process of elimination . 346475_348975
and how did you pick the one you picked ? 350705_352325
the first one didn't make any sense . 353465_355605
He said he wants to protect the parks and be a ranger and wildlife and stuff . 355925_361845
but it doesn't say any of that . 362265_363285
and, but we think the second one, because it says that, cause it says that he needs to reinforce the rules and it says there needs, the park needs strong regulations and regulations the same as like the laws and rules . 363985_385785
and he thinks that so many, so many people come here, that if one person does it, it's going to be hard to keep everybody from doing it . 387545_400845
and that we, and we didn't think that it was number three because we underlined it's not about how many people pick flowers, it's about needing to enforce the rules . 401505_414705
yeah . 414945_415025
cause he doesn't want people to pick the flowers . 415845_417965
and it says it's acceptable to, so that one doesn't make any sense . 418485_422545
so we think it's the second one . 422805_424165
okay boys and girls, it looks like we're ready to get into our larger groups . 424825_430325
so here's what's next . 430725_432445
okay . 434065_434525
we're going to, if you have the same character as another group, you're going to come together as a larger group . 435045_442625
and I'll tell you where you're going to sit and you're going to leave your binders on the table, and you're going to have a discussion . 442825_449465
see if you chose the same perspective and the same evidence from the text . 450165_454665
okay . 455045_455205
so we have two groups that are a little bit bigger, so we'll use the bigger table . 455365_458565
Herlinda's group will be at this table . 459145_461805
so if your character is Herlinda, you're going to come here . 461945_465425
April was a little bit bigger, we'll use this bigger table . 465585_467945
okay . 469345_469865
and Marco, over here . 470225_471985
and Nick's . 474085_474665
you can start your discussion once everyone xxx . 475025_477945
remember we want to give as many people an opportunity to speak . 480105_484485
so your binder should be open to both parts so you can see . 485785_491365
go ahead and start your discussion so everybody can have an opportunity . 495375_498255
I still think that it isn't a big deal if there aren't many visitors to the parks . 498315_512395
I don't know anyone who has ever visited this one . 512675_520535
and then number two says, Herlinda thinks we shouldn't worry about damaging our parks because only a few visitors would have sick mothers . 520825_529265
xxx that's ridiculous Nick . 529285_533065
how many kids go to national parks who have sick mothers ? 533185_535365
I don't believe there are enough that we have to worry about flowers disappearing . 535585_539185
me and xxx got got number two . 539805_543645
we were stuck between those two, but then we found really good evidence for the second one . 543665_548245
okay . 548325_548545
I'll read the first one . 548525_549325
I agree with that one . 549425_550285
Herlinda thinks that that anyone who picks wildflowers should be apprehended . 551965_560445
we couldn't find anything for that . 560705_562605
I didn't find one thing . 563525_565585
I didn't find one thing about the apprehended . 565585_570385
I found that in, didn't we find that in April's ? 570525_574305
yeah, we found this in April's . 574525_576285
yeah, cause you have to really think about it and look in the text . 579245_582245
this one's more like April's . 582825_586105
this one's kind of like xxx, straying off designated areas, or is that not a thing . 586425_592285
well, they're kind of different . 592725_594005
yeah, but we have good evidence . 594025_595405
yeah . 595645_595825
I think the last one is xxx . 596005_597585
so we all agree . 597725_600485
the second one, there's much more proof . 600745_603825
for third, for the third it's not xxx . 614425_616465
and we chose the third one because none . 616745_629465
second . 630405_630625
you chose the second . 630785_631685
you said we chose the third one . 631905_633805
I meant the second . 634605_635805
we chose the second . 636525_637685
that's the only one that makes sense . 638285_639785
and we did process of elimination also, only we didn't pencil them out, we just did process of elimination . 639825_644705
nice to have somebody with them . 645585_649385
he probably stole them . 649905_650625
so he's actually breaking three rules . 651205_654405
straying off the path, picking the flowers, and not paying to go into the +... 654945_660285
well he probably did pay . 660305_661465
maybe . 661985_662465
maybe . 663165_664285
April thinks that Chad should have known better and followed regulations . 664745_669645
yeah, April thinks that Chad should have known better and followed the regulations . 667955_672335
so the rules are posted everywhere, so he had to have at least seen them . 673035_681555
yeah because if he didn't see them, then . 682355_684215
he could have not just ran into the national park and started picking flower after flower . 685375_691755
(be)cause if he was running, he would have obviously have seen the sign . 691755_694715
if you're running and you see a sign, you're obviously going to stop to read it . 695065_698485
yeah, and look at the front page . 698725_700585
it says it right there . 700765_701845
it shows it right there . 702285_703045
it's right there behind him . 703085_704445
so he had to have seen it and just thought that it was okay for him to do it and not other people . 704565_709965
yes . 710065_710485
pretty much . 710665_711105
unacceptable . 712125_712145
yeah, because on the first page it shows the sign, no picking flowers . 712185_715985
yeah, that's what I just showed . 716185_717045
xxx you said something about it was okay for him to do it xxx . 718665_725885
he thinks that it's okay for him to pick the flowers cause his mom's sick . 726165_731745
and if everybody else does then there's going to be no more flowers for anybody else . 733005_737525
xxx .
no . 738625_741905
xxx .
he picked the flowers and then got apprehended because it was in a national park and he wasn't allowed to pick flowers from certain paths . 750705_762485
so he broke two rules . 763045_766405
straying off the paths and picking flowers . 767165_773925
and April thinks that Chad should have known better and followed the regulations . 771505_780365
xxx .
disagree . 782625_789185
it wasn't okay . 790345_791405
it's not okay because if he goes every single day to pick flowers, they're all going to be gone . 791545_798905
and he could have just gone to the store . 801385_802885
for example, if my mom and dad was sick, then he would have picked twice as more flowers there . 804165_810685
and people would see him, so other people would think it's okay . 811205_814805
so then you have groups of people doing it . 815685_818485
oh look, there's a kid picking flowers, you should do it for when our mothers are sick . 818485_826385
yeah but they probably xxx . 826745_827525
no, I mean like when they are sick . 830265_831845
oh .
well, he could have just asked his mom for money . 833585_836765
or, you have to pay to get into a national park, so you could have just paid from the money that he would have used to the national park, he'd gone to the store and bought them . 838325_849125
how much trouble do you think he should be in ? 849825_852785
not that much . 853545_855285
not that much that you can be thrown in jail . 855425_857145
yeah . 857325_857505
I think that they should warn him first . 858205_860605
but if he continues doing it, then they should not let him . 861605_864125
if he does it again then tell his mom . 864125_866605
yeah, sort of like +... 867105_868045
yeah, let him be warned then if he does it again, he'll get kicked out of the national park and be banned . 868125_872885
and he won't be able to go back . 872905_874685
but they should have warned him first cause he did think that it was okay, even though there were signs . 875485_882065
yeah, because it says right here on six, photo sign, no straying from designated areas . 883675_889355
also, when like, April was speaking for the third time on page seven, it's the second sentence, it said, I said he should have known he was violating the rules . 890255_906115
I'm pretty sure that it said in the action roles that he was twelve years old, if he was like five years old, then he may have really not known, but a twelve year old should know . 908665_921945
a twelve year old should look at xxx . 922285_924325
he probably saw the back of the sign, but not the front . 924725_928025
if you see the back of the sign, then read the front . 928605_931525
and if it's on both sides, then you can definitely see it . 935345_938185
yeah . 938625_938705
like a stop sign . 939045_939665
if you're on the back and there's no other stop sign, you just stop, don't keep on, going or else you'll smash into another car . 940225_949565
xxx shouldn't be judged so harshly . 971795_974275
and then on this it says don't his intentions count at all . 974855_979895
I think he should have been warned more . 980535_983835
it says don't be so hard on him April . 986155_1001635
and then the last one xxx but that doesn't make any sense because he says in the second line don't be so hard on him . 990145_1007345
the second one doesn't even say anything about him . 1012905_1015505
it doesn't even mention xxx . 1016125_1019265
okay boys and girls, if your group is ready +..
