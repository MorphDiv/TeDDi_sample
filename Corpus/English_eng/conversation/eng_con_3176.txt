they need to see all of this learning as intergrated and right a
we'll have spent over a month on this uint when it's concluded and
they came more than a month in that month of learning about quilts .
becaues they learned stuff that they had never know and they are
and things they thought they knew about they know much more about .
and uh why do you place such a premium on that ? 34708_40108
that's a that's a lot of your teaching time is devoted to
um well hearing what someone else has learned helps you think +"/.
+" oh yeah I've learned that too . 50276_51707
or gives you um a chance to piggy back and say +"/. 51707_55905
+" well yeah she learned that and that made me think I've also
and um building their self esteem their good feelings about math
they can't be confident about themselves as mathematicians if
no just good job in math today . 75322_76914
no what is it that you did that was good in math today .76914_80363
you thought about this .80363_81315
and you sorted through this difficult problem .81315_82953
and you learned how to do this . 82953_84933
which you didn't know how to do . 84933_86565
I want those I statements . 86565_88453
those statements about themselves . 88453_90175
coming from them more and more and more as the year goes on . 90175_94042
by the end of the year my children are very verbal about what
and what they enjoy about math . 99201_101488
and um what's challenging about math for them but why that's okay
Alright .
which parts do you want to all go together by color ? 180752_181538
like this part and this part this <part and> that part . 181538_184205
<okay> .184205_185239
okay so you want the red orange triangles to meet the other red
you want the red rectangles to meet the other red rectangles . 188972_192348
okay let's see what happens . 192348_203413
&=laugh . 203413_214981
is that quilt symmetric ? 214981_216525
symmetrical: +... 216525_218805
yes . 218805_219775
how do you know that ? 219775_220761
because these two would touch each other there in the same spots . 220761_225713
uhhuh . 225713_226263
these two +... 226263_226752
you mean if you do the line down here . 226752_229703
yeah . 229703_230106
and you folded it over .230106_231448
yeah . 231448_231792
I'm thinking of folding it . 231792_233754
is t here any other line of symmetry there ? 233754_235919
suppose I did uh +... 235919_237747
diagonal . 237747_238899
diagonal yeah . 238899_239818
I think yes . 239818_242679
I think it is yes . 242679_244703
you were mentioning that the computer was a good design tool . 244703_255652
uhhhuh . 255652_256148
I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about what you
um well the way we used the computer software the geometry
so by the time my kids sat down in front of the software they were
um and it gave them a chance to actually show themselves and others
they understood all of those motions and turns and the process by
where are we at in the unit now <xxx> . 292565_297789
<we are wrapping up> .297789_300213
we are culminating . 300213_301542
more quickly than we would be probably if winter break weren't
but all of the things that depend on talk about actual quilt
we'll come back to ideas like area and perimeter and measurement
but we needed to finish their final quilt designs . 322068_324904
um so they worked in groups of three and um first each child
they made their own core square and then planned a two by two
um trying to make it the most complex the most interesting of
so what they were doing today is piecing together there nine two by
I see like here we've got the standard um triangles . 347854_352380
uhhuh . 352380_352776
but now in this one they split one of triangle in half . 352776_357036
this is a rather complex core square as a result . 357036_360699
by using squares a quarter size than the ones they were used to
oh a quarter sized square that's even more complex . 364985_366013
and +... 366013_366916
oh wow hey look at that . 366916_368820
oh and then they xxx . 368820_369787
and the very smallest . 369787_370787
yeah . 370787_371148
that has it has it doesn't have a rectangle but it has the other
and that one has a rectangle +...374444_376815
I don't know how you get someone comfortable with that . 376815_396901
I think once you know if the emphasis all year is on kids and what
and how you find ways to celebrate the thinking that their doing
then by the time they get to this unit I know what's something for
um if we had never done anything like this before the quilt unit I
and it would be and it would go how I had it planned and we
but all year these kids have gotten the message from me that I
you know I want you to try new things . 435250_437436
I want you to talk about what you're thinking . 437436_439063
you know .439063_440655
no idea is too wild . 440655_441847
no idea is too crazy . 441847_443032
so by this unit I mean that's just the way we do things . 443032_446214
um you know from day one they didn't look at me like +"/. 446214_450351
+" what is she saying . 450351_451507
when I said +"/.451507_452060
+" what do you think about that ? 452060_453429
their hands shot up and they were ready to tell me what they were
so that is just the way the classroom runs . 457086_460715
