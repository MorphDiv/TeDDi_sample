what has happened to Damon ? 195_1475
how is he feeling and what words or lines in the poem tell you that . 1695_8415
S_one .
I think when he said he put his fist up to the sky, I think he was praying to God that he doesn't want to be cursed . 11155_21695
okay, thank you . 22375_23755
S_two .
how he thinks how he said, I was cursed with lousy breathing . 31615_38175
I think he feels left out and he has to stay inside . 38555_43955
I thank you . 44735_45535
S_three .
I think that Damon feels upset because it says when he says that . 52515_64375
+" I followed my fist shaking at the sky . 64915_69895
and also when it says that the asthma stole my weekend dose of fun . 70755_76375
when you read that line, asthma stole my weekend dose of fun, when you read that clue, what are you inferring about Damon ? 78265_86345
I think that he didn't want to have asthma . 87085_95305
he wanted to play outside . 95505_97225
thank you . 98445_99005
S_four .
I think that he said that he was cursed with asthma maybe grounded and all of that, maybe because he was mean to Blue and all of that, and cursed because I think he wanted to go outside but his asthma wouldn't let him because it probably involves running . 102155_126295
thank you . 127015_127435
how do you know that you're making an inference when you say something like, Damon is mad, or Damon is angry ? 128015_135935
S_five .
when it said, I asked why I was cursed with lousy breathing, I knew that lousy meant mad or angry so it was angry breathing . 144185_157065
thank you . 158625_158805
S_six .
I think what he means is that when he says, and asked why I was cursed with lousy breathing, he asks why it had to be him that was sick, why it had to be that day that he was sick . 162235_177435
I bet that he +... 178215_179995
I'm making an inference that he thinks, geez, why couldn't somebody else be sick . 180295_186835
it's the stick ball game today . 187235_189015
I've been waiting for this for so long and it's snatched away from me . 189835_193915
why me ? 194335_194755
so S_six, I'm going to ask you this question . 195175_197695
how do you know as a reader that you're making an inference when you read those lines in the poem ? 198135_204355
well, when I look at the paper, I just skim the whole thing . 205335_210915
asthma stole my weekend dose of fun . 211115_212855
he's obviously upset about that . 213235_215255
then he says, and asked why I was cursed with lousy breathing, he's like what I just said . 215235_221355
I'm making an inference that he's like, why is it me and why is it today ? 222095_229275
why couldn't somebody else take my bad luck ? 229375_231555
thank you . 252845_253605
S_eight .
I agree with S_five because I think lousy means when it's lousy means he breathes at different places at different times . 255645_266785
thank you . 267925_268625
how does Blue help Damon ? 269445_271625
what in the poem makes you think that ? 272305_275025
S_nine .
I think when Blue gave Damon the hot dog, I think Damon felt better because Blue was nice to Damon to give him the hot dog . 281795_294715
thank you . 295335_295735
S_ten .
I think Blue was nice to Damon . 296035_304995
how did he help him ? 305495_306975
how was he nice to him ? 307015_307855
because he gave him a hot dog and Damon really liked that, and he felt kind of up . 307825_316085
it made him feel up . 317285_318205
what did you read in the poem ? 318385_320085
what were the words or the lines in the poem that helped you to know as a reader that Damon felt better ? 320245_325785
want some help ? 336855_337495
what are the lines or the words in the poem that help you to know that Damon is feeling better ? 337835_345675
S_eleven ?
probably when he says that when Blue gives him the hot dog and he says that he could've argued with him but his mouth was busy . 347155_364255
thank you . 364855_365375
I think what he meant by that is that he actually wanted that hot dog . 365855_372015
S_twelve, could you hear S_eleven's thinking ? 372435_375275
not really . 375735_377215
what would you do if you can't hear ? 377335_378915
can you please clarify that ? 379155_380895
I think that he felt better when Blue gave him the hot dog because he said that he could argue but his mouth was busy and I think he meant by he wanted the hot dog . 385965_401805
thank you . 403605_404305
S_thirteen, what would you like to add to that ? 404525_406125
I disagree with S_eleven when I heard that his mouth was busy . 406185_417565
I think he couldn't talk that much . 418145_420745
thank you . 423025_423585
what do you think the title, grounded, means ? 424405_427325
can you turn to your partner and share your thinking ? 428205_431405
he was rude to Blue and he wanted to give him a chance but now he's rude to him . 432865_438225
yeah I agree with you because he got cursed by the asthma . 438705_444585
I think he's grounded and I think he can't get up . 445745_458745
Blue has to do all his work because he can't get up from the sofa . 459135_463315
I think when he said +... 463875_466595
after I read the poem, I thought it was a curse like he was grounded . 467595_474395
but grounded was the curse of getting asthma . 474815_479315
I heard that asthma stole his weekend . 485345_491725
I agree with S_one because at first I thought that he was actually going to be grounded . 493045_509445
but he asked +... 510325_512485
thank you, nice job . 525475_526515
what did you talk about with your partner ? 527015_528255
what do you think the title Grounded means ? 528495_530875
S_fourteen ?
I think Grounded means maybe he got grounded . 532015_537395
can you say more about that, S_fourteen ? 537915_539875
he got grounded from asthma because asthma caught up on him . 539935_545095
thank you . 545715_546695
S_fifteen, what would you like to add to that ? 547155_549055
I would like to add that I think that the title Grounded means that when you get grounded you can't do anything fun, and when you have asthma, you can't really do anything fun because you're sick . 550285_564645
thank you . 565385_565925
S_nine .
I thought Grounded meant that was he was grounded like S_one said and I didn't +... 569685_582325
when you read it, he actually had asthma and that's how I understood it . 583625_594125
okay thank you . 594685_595425
I didn't really know what grounded means . 600485_602105
I thought grounded means that he was stuck in a corner, that he was grounded, that he couldn't go anywhere . 602325_608125
but now when you read that part, I thought that grounded means that he has asthma, that he doesn't do anything . 608285_616585
he couldn't come out . 616805_617485
thank you . 618845_619185
