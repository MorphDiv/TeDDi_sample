yeah . 3600_3830
maybe maybe . 3890_4720
she kinda yeah I I did notice that it's there is a a
because even Brian &-um well one thing though and one thing I had
they keep clicking up their rotate . 21050_22560
and I think that through Brian for a minute . 22940_24750
he's like . 24770_25080
wait rotate . 25130_25670
I don't know anything about rotating right . 25770_27430
&-um and as_soon_as he realized . 27870_29270
oh that's a turn . 29430_30040
uhhuh .
'cause the pictures that the icons used he made sense of . 30860_33080
but &-um that word when it flashed that up there &-um that was hard
but he he knew exactly what he was doing . 37390_40000
and he knew the steps to go through . 40750_42110
and no and most of the kids who sat down today &-um all but two or
now they had seen some one day as a class demo . 49980_52190
we used it . 52420_53060
and we planned to re to review our ideas about quilt families . 53080_55980
but I was manipulating .
they were just telling me what to do . 56920_58180
uhhuh . 58440_58590
they had not &-um used that for themselves until today . 58640_62220
and it was amazing how they how much they understood what they were
and you know they were asking all the right questions . 68240_69630
and they'd go . 69680_69940
oh you know I think this course where might be the same as the one
they would go open that file and check . 76180_77580
oh yep I did . 77770_78700
and they would click back and do that . 79410_80460
so they're &-um they're not just it's not like drill and kill or
I mean they were designing and . 85600_87740
I think they were impressed by how quickly and easily it happened
but so it's it's acting like very easy software for them to use
but the reason it is is because they they know what it's
they are already most of them knowing what it's gonna do . 104380_106780
now there's still some guests and checks . 106820_108140
and it's like . 108160_108600
oh I'll click on this until I get it looking the way I want . 108680_111060
but as you saw them easing in by their second or third quilt family
they weren't just putting together any hodgepodge and saying . 115740_118660
oh yeah they're all different . 118680_119370
and starting again they were looking at the core square clicking on
I mean I know Amanda Wester turned that one triangle like eight
and it ended up exactly where it started . 129020_130539
just a little flustered today . 131030_132260
and she had been away from that before . 132420_134620
but for the most part you saw that like you know on this one . 134980_137220
you know they were making a plan . 137240_138340
they weren't just &-um playing around and getting something that
even Brian was saying . 143680_144580
now this time what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get all those yellow
and he knew what he was gonna do . 148500_149430
it wasn't just I'm gonna make it look different for that one . 149480_151460
right . 151610_151870
and then he goes . 152840_153300
and then this time I wanna get &-um you know and he had a plan . 153320_157350
and then he had to you know sometimes it was trial and error to get
I saw them . 166710_167230
&-um yeah he did definitely plan out . 167340_169580
I he seemed to do a little bit of trial and error on the turn . 169680_173100
mhm . 173120_173280
he he'd turn it . 173660_174700
look is it the same . 174950_175980
he'd turn it again and look I think the turns they play with a
right . 180980_181070
I think that when they sent out immediately that flip they knew
and they were using it when they wanted to and getting the results
but the turns took a while and just like on paper because you know
when they're turning it now some of them knew I'm gonna turn so
so it goes over to here . 200820_201700
'cause we didn't talk about exactly how much it was turning at each
it is set for everyone right now on quarter turns right . 205270_207570
it can be adjusted right right . 207900_209190
but those were the turns we were using . 209300_210750
but I think they had to play with that for a while to figure out
but yeah I think they were being pretty successful . 218020_219820
they were getting some &-um some interesting two by two designs on
yesterday they just kind of floundered it was &-uh an off day . 224240_227500
but today as they sat down they all knew what to do . 227520_229350
and many of them saw for themselves a need for a two-sided course
and others &-um are you know that's coming effortlessly with no
Kevin and Danny both have their two-sided course squares done . 239200_241820
no problem . 241860_242220
they know how to use . 242240_242980
them Kevin is already almost halfway done with his design . 243000_245660
has it all planned out use that . 245740_247140
Jewel knows exactly what he is doing . 247280_248470
he doesn't have a single square . 248980_249890
it is Chorus square . 250830_251500
I'm amazed . 252020_252380
now he has rectangle . 252810_253500
yeah . 255410_255500
thank Nicole was gonna do &-uh one side of his sports . 255780_259370
mhm . 259829_260110
and because she was only planning to use terms . 260579_263460
mhm . 264150_264310
so she didn't really think of the the backside although she
and also and then she came up to the window and trying to do . 272550_275770
yeah . 275960_276160
and with the construction paper did that one . 276210_277650
but Danny had put that up . 278830_279990
well I sent Danny well I sent Danny over to the window because she
and I didn't want her to mess up because I knew that was
so I I sent her to the window and said . 289740_292400
you know that will help you because she has blue green and blue
you know it's easy to make a mistake when you're doing that
I mean then she could have just sat at her seat . 300250_302190
but I sent her over to the window and out except_for filling in
and then she'll be ready in her first course square is go down . 308090_310270
and Kevin already asked half of his two by two design . 310290_312550
he really experimented with his &-um core square . 312590_315560
once he got it done until he got a result that he was pleased with
and I was &-um I thought Kevin would be one to offer . 319030_321800
oh I'm just gonna copy all four times . 321990_323120
she's just that's . 323170_323670
what Katie did do it . 323690_324590
Katie and she didn't have to do a manipulative . 324890_326960
yes it was . 327590_328080
and Sarah did not make it manipulative . 328150_330720
but she did not . 330910_331760
&-um here we looked at her . 331830_333250
yeah she did not &-um she didn't just copy that one . 333620_336420
&-uh and most of them have been able to . 340630_341800
so she enough flip . 346510_349740
and then this one she was she turned it &-um right to the left one
turn it to the left one half . 357430_358460
and Jenna had hers without a minute . 358660_360630
it's almost done except this park here this one section here with
these were that just that part of your design . 369250_372910
&-um and try to fix it . 374100_375380
and she didn't . 375480_375940
and it still wasn't right . 376000_376830
so what we had to do with her is I don't have any red orange ones
we had to take &-um a piece . 380650_382460
and &-um 'cause I didn't want her to have to make the whole
but what we did is then we made one here on the orange one . 389000_393150
I said . 393200_393370
now do she knew that the move she was making was a sideways flip .
do a sideways flip just on this piece . 396330_397910
and she did that . 398690_399230
and then slide it over . 399440_400860
and she got a new position . 401060_401950
and then she made one here . 402190_403130
she did a sideways slip and slid it over because that was . 403780_407220
and then she's like . 407980_408540
oh okay I see this should have backed up against the two part . 408780_411110
that's like a checker right here it does . 411160_412740
mhm . 412870_413060
and then she checked for that over there . 413280_415260
so her design . 416210_416870
yeah they were . 417230_417780
able to think about them easily . 417800_420180
yeah . 420510_420670
what do you think in general . 420720_421540
what what do you think in general about their descriptions of
I you know when they were talking about design &-uh mhm yesterday
oh &-um <they they> they didn't come up with as many words as
that's hard . 453150_453680
they were really talking about . 454020_455280
&-um it seemed like they were talking about the flips and turns . 455630_458920
and . 459110_459280
mhm all this pretty easily easily today . 459330_461890
don't think they I mean . 462010_462630
and they do they say . 462650_463190
okay I'm making my two by two design or they'll say . 463210_465230
I'm designing my core square now . 465410_466950
and they when they've got their hands on something they'll use that
and they'll they'll relate it to what they're doing . 473250_475510
yeah yesterday when we talked about design they were thinking more
and it was really hard for them to describe what that is could be
but again as you see them sit down either with the software or with
whatever they're doing they use that word design or they're doing
and usually they use those words to describe . 497290_499030
I'm flipping or turning . 499070_499830
I'm designing my two by two design or this will be a new two by two
but when they're away from what they're doing and trying to talk
&-uh uhhuh . 514309_514730
they start thinking just now like . 515220_516990
oh I made a design on my . 517140_518600
paper which you know I think it because that term is used in so
it's not just their understanding . 523200_525150
that's I mean you know you see you hear that word design all the
and it doesn't always mean . 529600_530560
well I don't know it means the things it means which is a multitude
and these kids are already familiar with those you know a Squiggle
oh I like the design you made or you know I like the design on your
you know Mickey and Minnie that was talking about . 545100_547120
well Mickey and Minnie are a design but it's not the kind of design
so when they're actually quilting with the software on paper . 551980_555500
and they talk about design they're very able to talk about what it
and the thought that goes into it they know that those quilts
they're making them happening by what they're . 565060_565430
