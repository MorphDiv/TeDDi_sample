But, yeah, I think that they just don't want to get really radical
Right . 482610_483280
for whatever re- I mean because I guess like Saudi Arabia funds it
yeah, th- they were talking about the go- xxx Azum is that hi- the

That he was talking about his girlfriend or something . 515419_517780
yeah, he's talking about well I can't even kiss my girlfriend and I
So it was it's like he doesn't really know I don't know .
He I mean that's what he doesn't even have the basics down you know
like I think I'm like we were at the beginning stage <like I am>
&=exhale . 537280_538640

&=exhale . 551550_552050
yeah I . 555280_556300
out of it .
He doesn't have control over his life .
That's what I think and so you know when people rag on him I I I
like the side of you know like Mike Tyson because he really doesn't
I mean he knew what he did but it's it . 565960_573920
not all him, you know .
Other people control him and tell him what to do and where to spend
yeah I mean I generally j- hur- just stay away from the T V anyway .
