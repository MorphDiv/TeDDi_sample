And I say if you do the spuds just well if they start to go brown
Right .
Cos it goes right the way through There 's a lot of out to the
Yeah .
Well I think we 'll have to find somewhere to lock it well Danny
Well there will be .
Yeah Could get a quite a a good deal I would have thought somewhere
use this tomato and onion .
Well why not Yeah that 's a good idea .
With minced beef I wo n't put carrots in cos that .
No .
might not be .
Well see what they say Is there anything in here I 've got ta get
Well the things will be in there .
things .
Yeah one So I wo n't do carrots .
No But you need some more onion .

This but this is twenty five pounds worth there .
Yes I know .
I mean it was only months ago cos it 's only a while ago that Tim
Do you want some more onion than that yes .
I should chuck another one in what difference does it make .
Oh my eyes .

Yeah .
but I ca n't see the point of doing vinyl on that anyway I reall
