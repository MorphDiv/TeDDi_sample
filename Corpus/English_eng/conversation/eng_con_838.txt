&~www .
right he's got a cold .
and he never blows his nose .
so he's always sniffing really hard through his nose .
he takes up three quarters of the table .
he's always elbowing me .
he he never does any of the work , when we hafta work in
he thinks he's really hard .
and he's really little .
and he just says the stupidest of things .
0 .
and he just breathes really loudly .
and he's the most annoying person on the planet ever !
