what I wanna do today is to start again with &-uh the kids' talk
&-um in_order_to pick up on that last thing that was being worked
&-uh they spoke of as the troublesome character &-uh of &-uh &-uh
that the methods &-uh that are adequate to that are uniquely
&-um so that the work of the interior ordering together with the
or however you wanna speak of it . 71280_72460
detecting and specifying the work arise together as twin borne aims
and &-um now &-um today I want to speak in further &-um shall
then in the exercise of lectures . 119310_120840
and that I take to be today's agenda . 123050_124610
&-um &-uh now before before we get into that &-uh &-um I want
&-um when I undertook to come here for the month &-um I proposed
and &-uh would their layout &-um the &-um practically studies
and that I would then refer to studies in_order_to elucidate that
and that progression was taken out_of the manual &-uh where those
and that the discovery that the work of discovery that their work
look there's a distinction between studies of and studies about . 253260_255660
and we we're gonna be directed specifically to the studies of I
and then with respect to the study I would then lay &-um . 264290_268120
&-uh in what respects studies of &-um now what happened was that I
&-um but found that &-um the two were very much of the same sort .
&-um and finding then that in the composition <of the two> of
&-um that they were graduate students and others in there that and
so in addition then there was a very feature of the composition . 339850_345210
the two there was an overlap of about twelve persons between the
&-um and that entered that put on the stress that is the question
&-uh where &-um in effect the argument would be such_as to under
and what I did then was find that indeed it was possible so that in
and in the graduate course the plan for the undergraduate course
and instead_of the speaking to the corpus I spoke instead to the
and I'm speaking to the progression . 414310_415630
&-uh now the result is at_least for my interest . 418180_421720
really lovely enterprises began to float up . 422760_426160
and so put those two balls in the air . 426670_430110
and they're in the air . 430150_430850
and I kinda like them in the air . 431320_432680
the problem however is that we're . 433990_435830
now coming to the end of things but is the calendar end of things .
and there remains the issue of &-um &-uh for both courses . 441270_449110
the issue of &-uh two things . 450150_455540
first the issue of the exercise and its concern with the produced
and the question now is &-um or the problem in the teaching is to
seminar . 488800_489000
and &-um &-um don't ask me how it happened . 490400_499200
it wasn't preplanned . 499390_500680
but I find that yesterday I was talking to you issue of structure
and today a plan to the same for you . 507250_509080
however now comes the nasty part . 510310_513980
I've always &-uh I'll speak to the nastiness . 514110_517650
the nastiness is that I'm gonna be covering pretty_much the same
and the stress in that has been well remarked done by golfer who
part of which has already heard what you're talking about . 534020_536380
mhm . 536520_536640
&-um so I'm gonna ask then that those of you who were in the court
&-um I already ran one tourist out . 555910_557960
I want to apologize for who was ever the friend of the tourist . 558210_561000
&-um but there was a tourist in here earlier . 562760_566530
and I saw the strength presence and ask him as gently as I could to
are you enrolled in the course . 573290_574310
and without looking at me he said . 574520_576810
no I'm not I'm a tourist . 576920_578560
and then I found myself saying before I wanted to I don't like
in fact I don't like tourists . 587150_588540
&-uh but then you so that was pretty rough . 589940_593120
well that's a second piece of roughness . 593540_595000
&-um the idea is that &-uh I am indeed gonna be going over the self
&-um I want to be going through it without trying to remember what
&-uh those of you who teach for a living know what that looks like
and so &-um so that's for the first thing the second thing has to
and what it is . 633230_633780
I want to ask of you and how what would consider to be a closing
a date . 639350_639660
I'm told that meetings officially that is on a calendar basis are
Thursday . 652910_653060
Thursday the . 653950_654380
hardest . 654430_654660
not for yours yours end on the second on the third .
mine ends on the second . 658720_659180
yeah . 660550_660610
according to . 660790_661060
well even if mine were end on the third then I would like to
&-um and for &-uh and review kind of where it is that we might have
and with our new new origins . 702660_705170
so to speak what it is might be done to exploit the momentum that's
and I think nothing would be &-uh would be very pleasing to me if
&-uh an enterprises are now in hand . 727070_731300
it would be instructed for me to have that when go . 731490_734330
back . 734390_734490
I think the proper format for such a meeting would not be a seminar
I think it would be a party . 739670_740610
so I'm gonna ask that on Wednesday we have a party . 742370_744640
I'm just gonna ask it . 745390_746210
I ask it of you . 746620_747290
look . 747440_747560
make me a party . 747890_748400
that's Wednesday so I don't know what to do with the parties . 750180_753560
except I put on a clowns hat which is what everything is required
otherwise if you look to whatever the fixings of the party are
and I assume that we'll get underway at ten . 771880_773760
and sometime during Wednesday we'll finish I won't even take a vote
I assume that those that wanna make the party will be on hand
and that you find for yourself the committee that's necessary to
them you wanna have the party at ten o'clock in the morning .
well shit . 796620_797210
why not . 797250_797480
well . 799190_799290
when do you want to have the party . 799310_799900
you want to have the party in the evening . 800600_801800
well would you rather have it in the evening . 804910_806170
George if we have it in the evening . 806190_807590
well I'd be very happy to I'll entertain it way . 814090_818940
&-uh any way you want . 819140_820220
we could carry on . 822690_823070
&-uh I doubt it . 827100_828540
it's not . 830590_830850
let's say it's a party all right . 831850_833180
but god knows how what the liveliness will be . 833260_835540
ten . 839100_839300
ten to ten . 839300_839390
well I asked her a party . 859720_860670
and I suppose I've made the wrong move by not thinking ahead far
&-uh I'll tell you what let's do . 871580_872740
we'll have a mid-morning party . 872760_873420
get it underway . 874930_875440
those that can get into it . 877030_878140
fine . 878270_878510
those moments of drags . 879310_880500
and look in see what's doing . 880630_882420
pick up the information . 882730_883540
say goodbye . 884640_885110
and that's it . 885500_885950
yeah . 887340_887430
rather_than party . 890980_893980
a picnic party rather_than a what party . 893240_895650
Indian party . 895310_895490
oh . 896400_896440
&-um we're gonna have a break pretty soon . 903530_909340
and when we do &-uh with those of you who are interested get
and when we convene again for the second half of today's meeting
look it's gonna be here or there . 925980_927340
it could be outside at such and second place . 927490_929820
and so would that be okay . 930890_933410
mhm . 933630_933780
can I assume Amanda that you'll be one of the ring later . 936690_939300
okay . 941340_941610
that's great . 941630_942090
&-um now the other item of business has to do <with the with the>
&-um now I'm into the the recapitulation . 963540_968470
and I'm hearing myself saying this yesterday as well . 968740_971870
so if I if I'm awkward then you know what it's going . 972740_976320
&-um I'm going to assume that whether you were enrolled or auditing
one kind of work is obviously the exercise that is you say &-um
let's say your own reflections &-uh originating from wherever they
consisting of the best you can do . 1036040_1038730
&-uh the best you give . 1040930_1042369
let's put it that way . 1042690_1043380
&-um and and to dawn to the exercise &-uh backing sheets say
either doing it by writing on each facing sheet alongside the
or just simply numbering places in the text and writing it out in
&-um now &-um I'd be happy to receive whatever it is you can make
so for example &-um if you undertook some studies of your own . 1115760_1123660
and there's a way of tying it into whatever's in the text that
if there are a flock of things you saw for yourself . 1129160_1131360
then you want to tell me for whatever semi that would be very nice
yeah . 1140750_1140900
but <I saw that> I saw that &-uh look Harold doesn't go like
I've seen it over and over again . 1149130_1150230
et cetera that would be really neat . 1150980_1153580
if you wanna write a straight critique . 1154880_1156370
then I won't be thrilled . 1157920_1160180
but I'll be happy . 1160220_1160990
&-um I have to say that . 1164460_1168300
yes that would be very nice . 1169120_1170680
&-um what I'm saying is do what you can . 1172720_1176250
&-um now then &-um the big qualification even on that it may be
and they're pretty big and very very promising . 1197330_1199760
and they've started in the work to get the feel of stuff <that they
particularly if so then you might find that they have to get into
that it's simply a distraction . 1216580_1217920
and you don't want to do it that way . 1218200_1219280
and you shouldn't then do it that way . 1219920_1222040
that the exercise is there if you need something to do . 1222160_1225860
it with it's interesting to you to do it with . 1225880_1228240
but if you enter your own stuff and you want them to write
and I suppose I would be really the happiest with that material . 1235570_1238380
and that can be of any order of enterprise . 1240270_1242260
however don't give me some old Raggedy term paper you wrote for
I mean I'm just it's too much to bear . 1247200_1249430
I mean it's too much to bear that . 1250950_1252110
well you'd satisfy the work by finally coming up with something
and handed in and satisfaction and fact and thereby in recognition
and that it's troubling . 1270380_1272670
so spare me that . 1273260_1274910
&-um now then I need to say . 1276900_1280110
what would what_about what_about the matter of you're not hand
&-um I have no way of enforcing my request . 1287840_1290650
that's you_all know that that's true . 1291450_1293120
so therefore don't do that to me . 1294630_1296380
give me the work . 1297360_1297840
&-um and . 1301390_1301920
it's if you can possibly get it to me before I leave . 1304180_1307110
that would be really really nice . 1307160_1308530
I'm not leaving on the fifth . 1310150_1311790
I'm leaving on around the fifteenth because Elliot Mitchell and I
so there would be that interim those of you that are pressed by
and can't get it done by the time the curtain comes down . 1326230_1330520
then may understand that there's still an interim period so that
you won't be able to deliver it hand deliver it . 1347430_1349810
and I would like to have it delivered by hand . 1350070_1351890
okay . 1353040_1353240
the idea is try to get it in as_soon_as you can . 1353460_1357890
but something like the middle of the month is about the outside . 1358280_1361250
&-uh now there's a final question having to do with grades . 1365370_1369540
I wish George weren't here . 1379160_1380160
so I feel his presence a very heavy presence . 1381660_1384050
&-um no don't go don't leave . 1386520_1391220
don't come back . 1391610_1392390
&-um I think what I would like to do is to see your work . 1394380_1400200
I think for those who need a grade in the course or in the seminar
and then we'll talk together about the work so that it's not a
what it is that the grade could look like . 1415140_1419150
I can tell you right or that I'd be much more interested in
ought_to have access to me to review the stuff that you've handed
I can tell you right off . 1435520_1436390
I find grades to be a tremendous war . 1436520_1438230
couldn't be less interesting . 1439100_1439920
&-um &-um any case . 1441870_1447740
so we'll do it that way on the grade . 1449580_1450800
if you want to simply handle stuff in and then depend on what the
that's fine and dandy . 1456500_1457430
but if you wanna see me and go over it before the grade is
if you press me and you don't come by and the deadline comes . 1461600_1465160
and I'll submit a grade on the basis of of the &-um of my
so that's fact . 1480830_1481580
are there any other any questions or whatever the sort . 1481980_1485630
okay . 1488560_1488800
&-um now what I proposed in talking about &-uh the the &-um
was that &-uh there were a variety of studies that are available
I mean quite a_lot_of documentation . 1552350_1553850
and yet within the fact that the documentation it was in that there
and that the doc in that there was a documentation but it being
&-um what I proposed was that the the in talking about &-uh
that the the conjecture resided in this that despite the
there was this thing I referred to as the unique adequacy property
&-uh the methods for findings these issues and elucidating them and
and I then went through the the &-uh clinic career form . 1623510_1629390
and it's accompanying &-um materials to show you one case where
&-uh but &-um &-uh for the matter of having to provide what the
&-um it was by the parties brought to look like &-um as the self
okay . 1709870_1710050
so what we had then was the clinic career form and its design . 1710200_1715600
and it's it's presence in that in the fair . 1715750_1719730
so the clinic and all of it was was available for telling for
I told you . 1724710_1725020
&-um and it could have been given in much richer documentation as a
&-uh where the in fact the actuarial results of &-uh the study are
and what you find is for that study is that it's strictly with
it's it's Conal with respect to the interior . 1758790_1762750
ordering that it held as the topic in hand . 1763510_1766320
so it then it's not that it's worthless . 1768230_1770360
it's that it found or permitted the specifying of an issue that you
but you had no grounds for investing with it . 1778590_1783060
has the strongest case then you could make for it which is strong
let's good . 1797550_1797830
call it now of shop work . 1798150_1799200
I had no place in in the corpus of Analytic sociology because
meaning it's interest to somebody . 1822470_1824260
and not that it's not interesting but for the interest of Ethno
not interesting that it's nearly topical and when I say merely
not that they couldn't alright but that if they did they would
otherwise everything starts they know about somebody comes in with
you put together a project on drugs . 1868900_1870260
you can have thirty thousand dollars . 1870540_1871950
the end of the month . 1872480_1872830
okay . 1874000_1874100
there we go . 1874160_1874710
&-uh when the issue when Su had to fly to Copenhagen didn't have
that I would've a typhus for three months . 1886560_1888860
and he would've an airplane trip . 1889000_1890300
&-um then Rose said . 1892260_1894790
well do something on lectures . 1895010_1896280
and you can have the money . 1896410_1897310
so then what happened was we had to go into this book . 1898430_1900680
we took it up topically . 1901540_1902630
and what happened is we subverted the whole damn thing on lectures
cause were found for ourselves what lectures could be . 1906830_1909110
and wrote in stuck in paying off the the fund . 1909270_1912140
we called a feasibility document . 1913440_1914870
there was no more than that . 1916170_1917420
say . 1918560_1918660
look if it had to be if it had to be something to study while
then we might or might not be able to get access to lectures as
so it's that kind of thing . 1937810_1938900
can't be . 1939430_1939860
I mean if you look for it . 1940170_1941250
&-um &-um from outside of that the the corpus . 1942730_1951250
then &-uh it's as I say &-uh . 1951830_1956940
&-um it's it's groundless it's hard in fact to it may be
okay . 1977720_1977810
so that was <for the> for the first thing that motive just
and the second was kids talk . 1984110_1985470
and I've already gone through some of that stuff . 1986930_1990210
but as I characterized the conjecture for you that is &-uh totally
and I laid out the what the phenomenon could consist of . 1998630_2004010
&-um . 2005960_2006060
that there was this development scheme . 2008630_2010860
that there was a matter of adult addressing the field of events of
children's talk a finding about it &-uh under the responsibilities
the ity of children's way . 2028640_2030230
and these consisted of finding then that's talkish for example that
and that they were in the places where they presently were was self
cause in those places kids talking the way they children talking
and that was seeable in the thing that <they were> they were
of sorts here and now &-um and similarly for other enterprise of
&-uh and given now a large investment of simply reasoned &-uh
&-uh it could be then proposed as a possible phenomenon that there
there might be the things that children do available and analyzable
that indeed they had an an interior productive course . 2131030_2134130
and that the kids so the children being the ones to be engaged with
&-um we'll call them the objects the events of kids talk where
and the question was could we find anything that would would
could we find anything by way of a document . 2187320_2189150
could we find documents that would be worldly we would take them
&-um that was one side the conjecture . 2206760_2210070
the other side of the conjecture was that if there was stuff like
if there was kids stuff then the very meaning of kids stuffs &-uh
stuff . 2236320_2236480
and so therefore the other side of the conjecture had to follow . 2238550_2241080
if you're gonna provide for the phenomenon of kids talk . 2241490_2243420
then you had a glove revive for the fact that adults would in the
they were being excluded . 2254340_2255340
so the second part of the conjecture . 2258310_2259870
then the second part of the the second part of the search for
way of bringing the children under &-uh say coming into interaction
thereby provide for events whereby the interior production for kids
it was not physical to the adults . 2310320_2312420
witness . 2313410_2313590
let's call it that it literally is not in the world . 2314240_2318670
it's not worldly stock . 2320390_2321610
&-um and that set up a number of other things like . 2327200_2338220
but . 2338890_2339060
okay . 2339460_2339620
so they're the two sides conject . 2339890_2341220
now then we went we we collected materials as I said from &-um
&-uh one at Ucla one at &-uh &-uh the Christian Family Daycare
so they said something like fifteen hours of stuff . 2371170_2374740
and they're pretty_much there's children between the ages of two
now I wanna show you a tape of an episode . 2384010_2387560
&-um and &-um . 2389290_2391860
I don't think there are enough copies of of one of these each
but so if you may have to share them with separate one for every
and I wanna apologize for the character of the Xerox the original
&-um and &-uh I need to apologize for the character that <it's not
it's the Xerox job is lousy . 2427250_2428860
okay . 2429720_2429810
so it means that it's gonna be hard to read off who's saying who's
but I think you can read it pretty_much as_in Ation it's pretty . 2436190_2439880
it's it's David and Eloise . 2440240_2442100
&-um . 2444030_2444090
now the point I wanted to be making out_of this display is that . 2451640_2457190
look it's &-um I nevermind the point yet . 2458310_2462590
let me first show you the episode that we found &-um . 2462690_2468470
&-um . 2470800_2470870
take a look so that can . 2474110_2476520
no . 2590350_2590520
he tried but . 2591080_2591730
okay . 2692490_2692710
now &-um does anyone want to tell us what they saw going on . 2695320_2703790
does anyone they risk it . 2706280_2707190
the look if I never introduced this you'd have a lot to say . 2710780_2714360
so try it . 2715470_2716060
I saw kids being turned on by camera . 2729530_2731350
being turned down by the camera . 2732700_2733750
yes . 2734030_2734060
okay . 2734920_2735160
well look it can't make any difference . 2738280_2741130
what you tell me . 2741250_2741730
I'm gonna tell you fact why we thought we were onto a gold mine . 2742730_2746610
yeah . 2748340_2748460
I saw I heard say . 2749190_2751410
guns were by . 2751540_2752500
and I didn't have an impression that those were guns . 2752570_2754490
the impression that those were guns to the children . 2756550_2758370
yeah . 2762970_2763030
we just just it can't make a difference among your comments . 2768680_2771140
&-uh are are only acknowledge the fact that there's something
then to invite adults to look at it . 2784160_2787790
whether they're parents or whether they're developmental
&-um &-um when they look at it then &-um they have no trouble
they're playing with guns for example that's a very prominent one .
&-uh turns out that persons wait to see &-uh later on &-uh &-uh
and then feel confirmed in the adults' intervention . 2824020_2825360
that in fact the sticks were were guns . 2827880_2830980
but then we've had &-uh some imagined the students who looked at it
well what they're doing is cracking alligator on a wall that's
and the thing that's so cute and interesting is that &-uh you know
yeah . 2856010_2856110
that their own parents there would not understand . 2867510_2871110
oh that's without question . 2872350_2873410
okay . 2874080_2874200
so . 2874470_2874550
that's it's I mean the persons who <are eye> are eye the fact .
&-uh what I'm proposing is that if we're the phenomenal we're
&-um parents living right in the midst of it right of their
and then the rest of then the rest of of it that to the extent
that the possibility that it would be something other_than and
we're figuring we'll have to provide . 2929890_2931400
we'll have to produce the sense of there being in the presence of
and we're counting on the fact that &-uh if the phenomenon in fact
so that's simply a way of a of setting in a constraint on what the
if it's to be something that we're not providing for by simply
&-uh and in fact are taking the problem of the unique adequacy
&-um the fact is when we show the film to persons who were
then when we go through or when we've gone through to say . 2998350_3002800
well but here's what we want to show . 3003040_3005440
you can be going on that is after they see it . 3005850_3008450
if we then give them the conjecture and then describe what's going
we get the simil of the weirdness . 3013730_3016110
&-uh say the Simil Akron because it's not a defensible presentation
although there have been a number of persons &-um &-uh &-uh who
but now I wanna show you what it is that we were claiming . 3042600_3045440
and then we'll go to that transcript and then play it again . 3046340_3050460
and then you'll see what we were claiming . 3051290_3053310
and then you'll see as well . 3054550_3055510
and we're playing after that what we couldn't claim at all . 3055580_3058270
so the thing we're claiming is no more than the analyst case to say
a chron a chronological rendering of a sequence of things done by
and it's the sense then whereby which contain let's say contains
and that's nowhere in sight of what the phenomenon could consist of
now that's the point of this demonstration . 3102960_3105450
so let me show you in our proposal . 3105570_3109570
we said the following events are observable . 3109910_3112050
in the video record that was now that's called proposal writing
&-uh I mean <the the> the proposal indeed makes its correct us
but here's what we said . 3127870_3129110
look the following events are observable in the record . 3129250_3131380
first of all the bine is brought to a synchronous voice hearing
and if you look at the if you look at the Ss you'll see that it
they stop simultaneously . 3161250_3162750
and the voice and contour is also identical . 3163070_3167790
okay . 3170150_3170360
so as I say the intonation contour identical . 3171350_3175010
so it's not only that they do Bine but the intonation as well is
second we proposed is that beginnings and ends are also brought to
we'll simply call it gratuitously alligator . 3201720_3203840
since it can't make any damn difference . 3203870_3205580
then there are there's there is the the sounded Baine done by
they have a way each has a way . 3218350_3219840
it begins of_course an ending . 3219860_3221300
and these beginning and endings are then brought to this delicately
a third features are in the middle of a series . 3228740_3230650
Eloise and David are following each_other . 3231020_3232810
after which the synchrony of simultaneous voicing is obtained . 3233790_3237440
so it's not that they started to begin with . 3238030_3239640
but the enterprise itself is provided for by them as a course
so they don't start to begin with with the synchrony . 3252860_3255800
but they provide for its sounding and pick up then the progressive
done in full synchrony . 3271780_3273570
now that I'm telling you what we say is seeable in the record . 3275280_3279190
right . 3279370_3279520
I'm posing thereby the problems that such claims set up for us . 3280630_3286460
&-um I'll pick up your questions after it's finished . 3287830_3290430
&-um &-um now fourth &-um though the eye glancing the the
&-uh in fact we had at that time didn't know if &-uh &-uh who's the
of_course we did know that then this kind of avid to find what kind
but at that time we didn't know . 3336000_3336880
&-um but what you'll see as you examined it is that there's the
and they're searching for a way and find a way to that synchrony .
you'll say what you see is that the gazing is finally placed with
and it's not any voice Bob on but it's that voice Barbon that's
the synchrony stops right there . 3381090_3383150
but the bine continues through civil repetitions . 3385170_3388040
and then finally the teacher off cameras and heard to say . 3391900_3395400
&-um &-uh guns are for the outside . 3396830_3399620
&-um he comes on camera . 3400810_3402300
and the voicing stops . 3403180_3404220
now then we proposed look the following are observable features of
that's the big point . 3415610_3416460
right . 3416750_3416860
&-um first of all that over its course it exhibits specific events
and now I'm using kids with a big k but I'm using it technically .
so it it exhibits specific events observable to the kids first
and in producing they monitor the production of further . 3441510_3447080
these are the enterprise . 3447180_3447640
the enterprise's own observable events of glancing voicing
and so on the events are collaboratively and del delicately
then we'll for convenience we'll refer to this work by saying that
that they're doing fine synchrony . 3493120_3494670
&-um that they're not it's thereby inappropriate . 3497580_3501890
it would be an adult specific version of what they're doing to
but something that the adult could imagine they were pointing to
provide thereby in the story for all the scenic apparatus that
now further you said that the kids are oriented to that foreign
meaning that &-uh it's not only that they were akin into the use of
they weren't doing anything else but building the same history . 3555460_3558070
as_of which . 3558460_3559080
the work then took on its situated characters but not now speaking
the search is that mechanism . 3574940_3575910
then far and far further this fine Tiffany is achieved as a
it's not that it's available under a general rubric of purposely
but that it proceeds seriously alright . 3591600_3593490
and stepwise to progressively show or progressively reveal &-um its
further the production consists of a course of produced relevances
now that's what is known as making the case by shoving the words
okay . 3633140_3633300
that's to say it's making the case by invoking for what the kids
the presence to what they're doing as they're doing it as their rel
the enterprise as an ensemble of kid produced speeches . 3647720_3650260
the specifics of say a foreign symphony are in a twist of the
and it's by reason of being able to talk like that . 3658340_3660980
but the phenomenon is then in hand it's <literally conjured>
and so you have to know how to talk &-uh and not to anyone but to
its character is structure . 3690320_3691460
the problem of structure is solved in the stroke just like that . 3692490_3696600
&-um okay . 3705120_3707800
so there's that then further the course of relevances since we've
we don't need a name for that enterprise . 3738000_3739530
but we do need a gloss . 3740470_3741550
we need as analysts a gloss . 3742860_3744350
the gloss will be an anthropologist gloss . 3746080_3749180
we'll say that the kids are doing alligator since somewhere early
Eloise says . 3761140_3761990
you want some of my alligator . 3762280_3763550
so alligator then will be used to mean whatever the kids really are
where the kids themselves will be taken as a final authorities to
and speaking of that enterprise as alligator . 3776990_3779070
what we won't do however is to presuppose that there's a proper way
we'll put aside the idea that they're talking a language because_of
unless you take it into the embodied gestural course of what
then we've thought to put those things together by not separating
let's say and verbal . 3827160_3828010
so for verbal work we would not use two tracks . 3828960_3831500
but we would instead speak of kids speeching or of kids sounding .
and those soundings would be &-uh the sounded doings was suggested
and given the name alligator . 3851170_3852370
now another feature a Cogent version of alligator . 3857980_3862590
and now we're using alligator with the bracketed alligator . 3862960_3866030
right . 3866330_3866460
it's the bracketed . 3866760_3867660
the descriptor alligator that's itself part of the enterprise in
but would that be supposedly what name you could be . 3875740_3877790
then a cogent version of that bracketed descriptor alligator can
this is so by repeatedly viewing the video record while using the
and we take that to be an additional property that means . 3896440_3900600
then first time around &-uh it seemed without structure it seemed
then what it could look like as this interior course &-uh becomes
so and then there's a further thing to be remarked on . 3926650_3929550
that this alligator the bracket is not available by reading the
and that turns out to be one further property of the scene that
nor if you're going to be telling stories of the episode no matter
no examination of things said about the episode will make
so it can't be seen from the episode except as the sense of an
if it's to be counted <a real> a real world phenomenon are
and then remember that's not . 4006970_4008010
because we're talkers because_of the kind of thing now that talking
well it's so not only for the Ethnography let's to say if we're
if it's discursive or matter narrative in structure it's similarly
but it's also the case that the same that <we are> we are
if we take sequence photography let's say sequence sequential
photographic records . 4052900_4053550
so for example we put an intervalometer on at a very close . 4056290_4060450
&-uh right . 4062260_4062410
let's look simply like four frames per second . 4062430_4064830
it turns out then that similarly you can't recover &-uh the ar even
&-um and the reason that you can't is because <you can't> you
&-uh but you you can't find how over the the &-um the
of &-uh these separate frames where in fact &-uh they fit into the
so <what the what the> what the sequence photography does . 4127779_4131970
what these visual rec records do is to force the interpretation of
now then that would hold then for sequenced photographs for still
it holds for diagrams of every imaginable sort . 4166020_4168319
&-um it holds as well for every notation procedure in that that
and of_course then it would hold for the mimicry which is to say .
there's a various ways in which you know kids' stuff is prepared
wanna hear what my kid did . 4201400_4202160
now in fact adult linguists are forever recalling the sayings of
&-uh so here's what we're then was being proposed . 4210750_4216310
now the big thing is that since adult methods are specifically
then on these grounds the adults are thereby missing the work of
and that by reason of the practice is whereby these as renditions
so the very doing of the renditions is the work that assures the
it's not only is that the adults do those . 4252300_4254030
they can be counted on to do those . 4254350_4255930
and so therefore we found those grounds that that they were be
then finally there's the fact that the adult comes on in the end .
it says . 4295540_4295920
guns are for the outside . 4296730_4297590
and we thought with that &-um we were in the clear we had now the
and that is if the properties I've been laying out before just up
which is to say the achievement is specified <as a> as a finely
then that achievement considered relative to the ways in which
and kids' kids' culture is now demonstrated in the adult who
big o ordered of childish ways . 4386310_4389070
&-uh of chi children at play or childish talk or children or as
the by which would &-uh mean then that &-uh not only the practices
these development schemes . 4482240_4483620
discoverable and even now comes the big business . 4484750_4489720
&-um &-um in that they would be uniquely possessed &-um &-um of the
they would thereby be available to employed possess skills and
which to say better . 4517840_4520430
the community . 4520850_4521240
okay . 4528980_4529250
then was that with the result we counted then a result in hand . 4529440_4532820
alright . 4534890_4535130
now then there's a big flee in the ointment spoils everything . 4536350_4543050
okay . 4544770_4544860
the thing that spoils everything is that the entire argument turns
the entire description in fact is a description of observable of
right the barn the beginning the course the ending . 4584950_4587190
this even the synchrony &-um the synchronous sound the coming to
even notions like coming to beginning and and so on are found
and that video track is a peculiar kind of time track . 4606330_4610520
it's a clock . 4610990_4611640
and it has a register . 4614150_4616200
it starts of zero zero on the index . 4617370_4619650
and then there's a fine fraction of the next . 4620710_4623330
and the thing counted next from that is on the index locatable at
and thereby next is furnished its concrete in fact it's furnished
so you can see you could then layout say a string and attached to
then we'd use the chronology to read into the interaction those
alright . 4675050_4675200
it's not that it's garbage . 4675750_4676680
it's that it's conjecture . 4676970_4677960
the only way it could be garbage as a matter of fact is that it's a
we invoke <to get some> to get some mileage into this to get
but it's a very possessive spirit I mean that clock time and the
once in fact it starts to order an array of things . 4701110_4705210
seeable you have to turn away from your victories . 4705370_4709640
you have to literally turn away from your victories to take up the
and that's what can be really tough . 4716050_4717380
can be further tough because persons are willing to give you money
if you adhere to that original like you can get persons convinced .
some of you here are convinced . 4727480_4728760
but it's a phenomen I mean it's even interesting . 4730110_4732890
it's interesting until you introduce the floor . 4733650_4735430
and if you introduce the floor . 4736710_4737500
then where do we go from there . 4737650_4738750
well &-um okay . 4742650_4745620
now yes . 4745700_4747250
please are you with somebody else . 4747890_4751890
well no no I'm going &-uh is there any analogy at all between
and the lecture series in both of which cases you could not &-um
yes . 4774410_4774500
exactly . 4775670_4776020
yes . 4777050_4777080
<there is> there is a comparability very strong comparability
yes . 4783680_4783840
you might as well use the comparability to find the two as a as say
right . 4794870_4794970
&-um if there's a lunacy with respect to kids talk and claiming
and the company analytic procedures to make it intelligible <as a
standing in recommendation of our conjecture . 4809880_4811740
the conjecture is look there may exist a phenomenon not ever in
it's kids talk like it's a pheno like it's really something that
&-um and though it's true that <there's a whole> there's a
now there's a whole ambience there's a whole <like a> like a
and they talk of kids' rights for example . 4840750_4842590
and what kind of thing kids do while honoring the point of view of
they have all that . 4849450_4850250
&-uh the thing that interests me on that score is however is that
and they're not seeking therefore to establish right that is to say
it's continuous with &-um the the practical sociological
whether it's from bilingual or developmental psychologists or
but in that . 4900990_4901670
their methods are conventionally analytic methods . 4901740_4904820
there's not a chance in a pigs ass that there'll be anything come
so therefore we're set up in hopes that is the crowd at Ucla who
&-um we're set up in hopes that our own concern for the unique
if that's of all realistic may then produce big news . 4925780_4930530
but the problem then is to set up the problem of investigation so
make up twin born . 4946710_4948590
the task of our inquiry that needs simultaneously to be discovered
that's the issue . 4955550_4956380
excuse me . 4958560_4958920
that not apparently going then out . 4980050_4986160
yes . 4988660_4988690
the game stuff . 4989380_4989690
for example the early game stuff . 4990150_4991070
the other day you and this model the shoe that you're telling me .
not that find out fact . 5047240_5050740
yeah . 5054820_5054970
&-uh I think the suggestion is really neat . 5056480_5058450
we had thought that there that one of the ways in which the adults
one of the ways in which the adults could be ex would be excluded .
was that if they came into the presence of the kids work they
right . 5088090_5088200
so you would have them doing things instead that made impossible
so they would do things like getting down to the kids level even
but that after a while they finally would havey way to get up and
they would at that point have returned from the place where they
now in that case that preserves in the adult's in the adult to the
not his . 5150310_5150400
okay . 5152760_5152920
&-uh now that's talk about conjecture . 5154630_5157830
that's conjecture from beginning to end . 5157950_5159720
when we talked to teachers and said . 5160510_5161630
well &-uh does anything like this ring true . 5161650_5166310
and they're film with story by way of certifying you have to
in my case or I know stuff like that . 5172290_5173880
&-uh the one you get to the business of their having them to play
then the whole weirdness of it strikes . 5184830_5187670
we think that there may be something wrong that I mean what Harvey
let's say the had to return from a trip to to the adults to the
and would come back and say you know what what Dave and Elise
but then you know how the kids are and countering it that way to
and that is that it's essentially appreciation meaning it's <it
gets them instead lucid versions of kids work as children's or
however my collaborator in graduate &-uh student George Girton is
okay . 5262460_5262610
I'm equally suspicious of using the resources of the trust paper to
even_though we have some pretty nice stuff in which we're not doing
we're not dealing with with &-uh with &-uh preschool children .
we're instead dealing with the mothers of retarded children who are
they're playing a game of rules . 5295480_5296890
chart . 5298070_5298170
alright . 5298650_5298810
and they're also playing unless playing playing &-um pool or
and then according to whatever the card has as a color or not . 5309870_5312830
you then get a prize or you . 5313330_5314230
lose something . 5314610_5315040
and so this can run the course . 5316120_5317210
you're finally someone who's won . 5317460_5318780
they've gotten a certain number of things . 5319110_5320500
and they put it on a card . 5320730_5321650
bring it like a lotto card . 5321670_5322900
now here you have mothers playing with <the they're> the
and the mother's playing with the retarded child within the
now we have extensive video records for a series of six families
the mother is playing a game with rules with the normal child . 5349230_5353050
and that game with rules satisfies the requirements of that
all the basic rules of the game . 5365880_5366890
and it's completeness is fully provided for by the analytic version
okay . 5375420_5375510
so when you see the mother playing with the normal child . 5376620_5379320
then she's saying she's reprimanding the normal child . 5380340_5383340
pay attention right or you wanna play or not or &-uh &-uh no you
you do this . 5390460_5390810
so she's into the whole business of correcting you the play . 5391050_5394140
so as_to or say that makes up the recognizable events of the of
when she's with the retarded child she uses the basic rules of a
it's only it's it's a catalog right that she uses with which to
the child's own retardation . 5425800_5427100
she sees with it . 5428180_5429230
and the way in which the child &-uh doesn't know what he's doing .
child right . 5435650_5436660
has missed the point of it . 5436900_5438140
okay . 5438860_5438950
all this is visible in and as the not the events of play but those
&-um now that looks pretty nice . 5465550_5468130
right . 5468400_5468560
there's a big flea in that argument . 5469700_5471070
what we're doing is taking for granted . 5472620_5474050
the collection all the basic rules of the game in both cases has
so if it's that kind of thing then the catalog has this large
alright . 5507540_5507700
it's to say it's in the fact that it's essentially vague that all
then take on their deafness . 5517160_5518480
which is is a say they become essentially institute productions
yet we don't have any of that that we don't have any of that .
it's that we're now beginning to pick up what there is in that
and simply rules out . 5539650_5540700
it's just there's no chance that the stuff can even come off the
we would instead have a principled account . 5545700_5547810
we'd have one more account of how parents of retarded children in
and we would even be able to speak of a comparative of a paradigm
an experimental procedure or an investigative procedure that
right using only the mothers of comparable children . 5572280_5575420
this one of her descendants is retarded . 5576670_5578020
right . 5578890_5579010
I'll &-uh say the Npis diagnostic procedures . 5579180_5583250
right . 5583540_5583680
this one is clinically uninteresting . 5584510_5586990
so we would have the whole smear except that it would be wrong from
except <as one more> as one more . 5591250_5593580
analytic . 5594210_5594450
&-uh victory . 5594630_5595050
if possible you find what the play . 5597640_5605880
maybe . 5618600_5618740
and then if . 5619610_5620180
you maybe . 5620590_5620970
the child . 5622220_5622460
yeah . 5628030_5628110
yeah . 5631660_5631840
&-um okay . 5633670_5635390
it's surely worth it's worth checking out . 5635440_5637430
&-um my reservations are the same reservations I had in the other
I mean this is nevermind the beast . 5645180_5646960
well indeed I did speak of the machinery that I laid out in the
&-um it eats up everything . 5655130_5656820
right . 5656940_5657040
I mean you can have really gorgeous consequences if all you wanna
&-um but &-um the big prize for all the fact that there are
the big prize is not in that direction . 5672780_5674430
this is not it's not in that direction . 5675570_5677570
and for and on and for on the grounds of the access to the
it's not that we have a principle reason for thinking that it's not
we can see the way the stuff comes off the tape and satisfies the
&-um &-um and so those are the . 5699820_5704230
so it's on the grounds that the research is already <in in> in
and we're finding what persons parents are doing with children . 5708900_5712330
the stuff is in fact witness . 5713930_5714900
it's not that we're telling stories of parent and children . 5715910_5719090
okay . 5720860_5720950
and in fact the weirdest stuff that you get is when you play with
and if you'd ever believed it before if you thought well the hell
simply get into the spectacle and and order the spectacle which
&-um which is say if you get into it as a spectacle what you do is
it's just it's like a game . 5758010_5759680
and it's a game and the phenomenon I mean the rules that you
&-um but &-um &-uh if you are with a kid then you're like being in
okay . 5775990_5776100
it's like there's the gap . 5777760_5778750
and Jesus who would've thought that it had the properties that it
okay . 5786100_5786190
and it's similarly that &-uh you get the reminder . 5787570_5790480
okay . 5792560_5792800
these properties be . 5793980_5794950
yeah . 5796900_5796990
&-um well as an adult interested interaction synchronous
&-uh as an adult &-uh used to hearing stories seeing dramatic
&-uh maybe for the kids doing Bob the synchronous thing is not
maybe &-uh Bob buying important thing is that . 5836390_5840460
&-uh well speculation I can imitate I buy buying is &-uh exciting
but that is . 5854610_5855090
mhm . 5856960_5857110
maybe there's something else . 5859620_5860410
I dunno . 5860750_5861020
I guess wondering whether interaction synchronous interaction
whether . 5878150_5878300
we're imposing the situation . 5878450_5880190
may not be . 5884960_5885540
don . 5895140_5895310
I'm not sure . 5895510_5895830
I get the question . 5896120_5896830
<are you> are you saying &-uh that there are indefinitely many
why would you have selected the synchronous Bob buying when any of
that's what I'm saying . 5918430_5919090
and why wouldn't then synchronous by buying be itself a conceptual
so that we would then rescue the whole a whole positive version of
well I would say until the case is made for the interior productive
then the then &-uh your criticism there's no way of escaping the
yes . 5943720_5943890
could be said . 5944160_5944600
well you're into an elaborate construction of kids to children's
you're introducing a a as a can as a possible phenomenon . 5952930_5956540
something that kids talk . 5956650_5957910
it's a construction insofar as you have no way of &-um recommending
&-uh and thereby there's the the construction is evident . 5974460_5978060
&-uh and why should you prefer that construction to any of and the
and even given their grant their grounds for recommending let alone
alright . 5994190_5994340
like parents after all would like to know . 5994600_5996430
well sure . 5996510_5997060
&-uh I've seen the kids such things . 5997140_5998660
but it would never occur to me that they assign their confidence .
alright . 6002960_6003110
but I would be very interested to know what their purposes were as
and &-uh there's no escaping that criticism at the time that . 6009820_6015250
we escape . 6015270_6015850
it'll be the escape into a radical phenomen in which case then
right of that as a discovery if . 6022020_6026080
but then the the thing that's really nice about that . 6027060_6031770
the proposal I just made is that those proposed as a discoverable
they would come to nothing . 6041990_6042970
that all of us would turn finally one day into a_lot_of hopes right
and raised a_lot_of interest here and there . 6053780_6056190
okay . 6057100_6057270
and turned into &-uh a hopeless &-uh a hopeless proposal . 6058080_6063950
yeah . 6072490_6072560
there's an incident in the beginning after he reaches up for
and the little boy comes down . 6078290_6079600
and he turns around . 6079830_6080680
&-um and I actually wonder how physical movement around I think
so . 6088740_6089530
yeah . 6090090_6090250
&-um and whether this embodies motions . 6090960_6093890
kids do this . 6094040_6094610
yeah . 6095010_6095070
in a certain sense by doing that he's looking around and physically
I'm not completely &-um but the sense maybe in the of all the
&-um the embodies sequence is &-uh . 6108030_6111630
well that is visible . 6112440_6113300
and if we don't have to cut it each . 6113400_6114690
yeah . 6114760_6114950
well the thing about it is that you can get very very detailed
if that's so then I can't see what's what's interesting . 6123840_6128800
that would be playing fast and loose even with the notion of
alright . 6137120_6137270
and like surely can't be that . 6138470_6139880
&-um yeah . 6145120_6159320
production . 6169340_6169910
and at the same chronological notion of production that would allow
I had the sense of like become the analysis for reduction . 6207890_6221960
and &-uh and that would become a way get outside of our own world
but we'd for production . 6247010_6250050
and I have a difficulty then . 6250560_6251920
are you thinking that that's what I'm proposing . 6253000_6254530
pardon . 6254800_6254940
you're thinking that that's what I'm proposing that I might be then
I might be confounding my own enterprise by not having clarified
well I wouldn't be claiming that you confound . 6262850_6265610
no . 6265760_6265840
no I'm I'm not talking about personally . 6265980_6267340
I'm talking about that . 6267700_6268180
the enterprise is confounded because those are being put together .
yeah . 6272550_6272630
I I have a sense of like . 6272870_6273970
well what could production . 6274330_6275990
they wouldn't use chronological time as resources . 6276060_6278720
they wouldn't use anything resource . 6278780_6279820
so I have difficulty like . 6281900_6283080
okay . 6283390_6283510
properties . 6286720_6286960
yeah . 6287490_6287600
and that'll give us like the possible fail . 6288180_6290440
yeah . 6290780_6290840
but being in being constrained by those I have difficulty of like
point me to something that I don't know what it . 6295730_6297490
looks like . 6297540_6297780
I mean I may discover but have a sense of that . 6297940_6300050
I use the world order to production . 6300740_6305490
has a world about it in the sense that invokes a notion . 6306240_6309650
Ology such_as something that be produced . 6310470_6312410
yeah . 6312850_6313010
&-uh now that can be like this . 6313850_6314920
here we're having couple words . 6314940_6316250
I <think so> think so . 6316660_6318360
&-um I think the way to show that would be to witness one of Dave
and the words appearing right as the typing proceeds . 6339860_6343580
and you see in the way which you see now as a course of typing the
and you see then <the typist> the typist pausing stopping
alright . 6366460_6366610
with which then he then having then you see him having made the
returning to the place that he had previously abandoned to pick up
as_soon_as you read the resulting transcript none of that is any
okay . 6391240_6391480
as long as you're into the matter of witnessing the matter as it's
then it's full structure as the emergence of the parameters of the
okay . 6406630_6406780
to have written then constructively about the and in a reflexive
but then there are other things going on in other tapes . 6432140_6434240
&-uh that would it's it's in that that's doable that . 6437340_6440380
it's a matter of pushing the words around right to try to diagnose
&-um finding let's say of my my told enterprise right that the
I wonder if we can take about ten minutes and then proceed . 6475970_6478570
and we these . 6479510_6479960
okay . 6488360_6488630
this is the &-uh continuation of six twenty six lecture . 6488650_6491630
&-um they were reservations criticisms . 6502920_6506590
yeah bots in addition to and so on . 6507160_6510410
and it seemed to me that the room was kinda live to get the break
perhaps we wanna pick that up now for the few minutes of remain . 6515650_6518260
yes . 6518630_6518660
this is &-uh &-uh I think a year back . 6519700_6521440
&-um and that is &-um it seemed to me when you were talking about
&-um particularly you were talking about the shape of the sound . 6541960_6545150
and what it seemed to me was more important in synchronization with
and it occurred to me when we were talking about notation and time
yeah . 6579150_6579210
&-um and that synchronization in a sense was the ultimate test of
what that . 6585590_6585680
structure . 6586480_6586610
yes . 6586660_6586690
or the extent to which they were accomplishing . 6586980_6589420
yeah . 6589550_6589630
the end .
and I thought it was interesting . 6590800_6591860
that's really neat . 6592280_6592870
because the adults have a tendency to disrupt kids at those moments
&-um because then in a sense is the kids are successful in doing
nonsense . 6607440_6607950
yeah right . 6608570_6608980
then the adults come in and say . 6609170_6610700
okay nonsense . 6610830_6612230
right . 6612930_6613060
yeah I don't know . 6613510_6613900
there's something in there and in the relationship between those
I don't know . 6620200_6620540
there was something else I'm excited about when you were talking
and don't call me . 6626930_6627390
shit face again . 6627530_6628340
it was one of those situations where &-um a behavior was marked in
and I was saying before over here . 6637780_6638710
I'd like to know if a new kid coming in would have to go to the
I mean that pursuing those kinds of questions . 6644680_6647400
yeah . 6647560_6647660
yeah to see you know and when at don't call me shit face . 6647960_6652940
&-um whether that at the end of the utterance was the end of the
the .
yeah whatever it was . 6660390_6661780
yeah or whether it there was some behavioral thing that you know
there's a world of the beginnings and ends . 6665520_6667830
yeah rather_than the shapes &-um that would be worth . 6667980_6672260
pursuing . 6672380_6672560
yeah . 6672720_6672830
absolutely I think it surely would be worth pursuing Nell I'm
yeah yeah . 6682170_6682330
and he equates that with what he speaks of as the gestural
a Al organization of thinking . 6686610_6687620
yeah . 6687840_6687950
and what I hear you saying is look get a good look at that rhythmic
and particularly at those actions where that's the first thing that
there's this . 6699040_6699510
right . 6699560_6699650
yeah exactly . 6699880_6700520
and that they're yelling . 6701120_6701500
&-uh this you know this &-uh dumb shit . 6701870_6704430
yeah yeah . 6704760_6704990
alright . 6705290_6705420
&-um &-uh if in fact that's if in fact it should be found that it's
yeah . 6712630_6712690
yeah . 6712920_6712990
alright . 6713110_6713260
then that would gain us a_lot_of ground . 6714160_6715790
&-um &-um and we would be left as well with the kind of a natural
let's say of the temporality of it which is that we would start
mhm . 6732180_6732360
right . 6732730_6732820
and with the fact that <it's a> it's a &-um &-um an available
well more than that . 6742880_6743410
yeah <the the the> the thing might be to at_least take <as a>
the understanding of how one generates that rhythm . 6750870_6753140
right . 6754140_6754250
yeah . 6754390_6754510
how how does a child or how would you &-um generate that rhythm
what would you have to know understand in_order_to do that to do it
and what role do adults have in identifying the successes perhaps
mhm . 6776710_6776840
like I saw another thing recently that I went to pick up my nephews
and the kids had all been waiting in one of those inflatable pools
right . 6786220_6786340
and they decided to take the air out . 6787610_6788900
that was all . 6789120_6789330
the nursery school teacher was right there . 6789570_6790780
that was all right . 6791200_6791520
and they all started pushing down like this right there . 6792180_6795500
you go right to get the air out right right . 6795680_6797170
okay . 6797630_6797850
and then that was over when one of them started because it was
right . 6806220_6806340
okay . 6806740_6807010
and then another kid started doing that . 6807450_6808860
and at the point that more than one kid right &-uh was engaged in
&-uh I don't want you to break my pool right which became you know
yes . 6824810_6824870
yes . 6825530_6825590
that's really nice . 6826530_6827090
&-um that's really neat . 6829890_6834070
that one thing it makes it possible to it makes it possible to
walking for example even even lecture for example keeping terms
right . 6865810_6865910
&-uh that <it makes> it makes possible to start &-uh with &-um
practices in hand rather_than starting with say with with a
and it has it could have a sensibility to it for the parties
and then well now how is it possible . 6901520_6903640
so as_soon_as the question is asked we're already into the business
and actors and author of action who are gonna have things in mind
mhm &-uh whereas if you're gonna start with the unavoidability of
mhm alright . 6924280_6924990
then it may be that &-uh it's a very very powerful way to get
you know you're not using a an official version of . 6934210_6938370
so you're not using an extensive version of time activities
mhm like the mathematical properties of the number series in order
you would say under the number series version of timed activities .
you would then have activities showing their time . 6962620_6966060
mhm . 6966740_6966860
but you would instead having the kids furiously into the business
right of . 6974220_6974680
of into the business which video was of it as the time kept . 6976210_6979310
yes . 6979980_6980150
oh yeah . 6980500_6980750
right . 6981120_6981220
see . 6981550_6981670
and he does . 6982040_6982260
but he speaks of it because he's a musician . 6982280_6983840
and I'm not a goddamn musician . 6984140_6985230
I mean I can't play . 6985320_6986140
yeah . 6986560_6986630
so that means I only have an appreciation of that stuff which will
he thinks . 6992320_6992680
so you can do it with other public activities . 6992780_6994680
like typing . 6994770_6995210
if we get to do it again it has to be something where you would
mhm . 7004110_7004250
and keep track to see things being done . 7005080_7007200
but I think that also ties into the idea of participating because
out . 7012270_7012330
yeah . 7012490_7012570
how they are breaking up because you can't be sure how they're
the time is to participate and mis mis participate . 7017880_7021660
yeah . 7022070_7022200
long enough that you begin to see where . 7022450_7025120
mhm . 7025140_7025410
what kinds of things they used to to break it up . 7025540_7028160
yeah you know . 7028480_7029210
yeah . 7029490_7029640
like if you started from the swing running up to the table . 7030030_7033240
right or if you started the table and tried to get in there . 7034050_7036690
yeah you know . 7037020_7037720
yeah . 7037850_7037910
did somebody push you away . 7038160_7039270
you know . 7040200_7040280
yeah . 7040330_7040470
yeah . 7041190_7041290
like getting mine . 7042250_7042900
kid . 7043170_7043340
yeah . 7044830_7044930
mhm . 7047640_7047820
but there other comments . 7049450_7051780
yes . 7052340_7052370
yeah . 7052880_7052940
you respect the question . 7058040_7059210
unique for this phenomen seemed to have something to do
yes . 7072530_7072560
the use <of a chron> of a chron . 7073250_7074930
the use of a &-uh a chronological count of sequencing in_order_to
the presence of a sequence kept . 7087290_7089510
alright . 7091120_7091290
instead_of it being an interior an the interior ordering of the
you haven't set a principle version of sequence . 7098730_7100510
and with that then you locate the one after the next . 7102330_7105410
alright . 7106520_7106650
or you locate before and after or later or how much later or how
so that would be that . 7114670_7115360
you're using a a &-um theory of sequence with which to
the presence in the tape of seeable seeable things kept in
so that seems to me be a no-lose enterprise . 7134400_7135810
let's see how you possibly can fail to find sequence in that case .
okay . 7142550_7142640
and that's what the flea in the ointment is . 7143810_7145130
I mean why should I be guaranteed access to the the Heard
kept in time . 7156010_7156520
for example you can't do it at the piano . 7158210_7159720
you've never even as a beginner . 7160700_7162370
like for example I Dave spent one weekend teaching me to play the
and you can imagine he said . 7168340_7169130
okay Harold I'm gonna teach you everything there is . 7169150_7170690
but know about chords . 7170800_7171660
so then he lays it out <as a> as a thing . 7172730_7175210
all right . 7175450_7175690
it was a fabulous thing . 7176880_7177810
I'll tell you about that . 7177830_7178400
sometimes maybe at the party . 7178720_7179280
idea &-uh I could get those two hands if I had one hand and then
so my fingers were find in fact were finding the places that they
okay . 7193380_7193470
&-uh as_soon_as I had to get them together then everything nothing
so you could say . 7201430_7201970
well the thing that's analyzable about your failure is this that
but I would say . 7212100_7212530
that's a_lot_of bullshit . 7212650_7213530
I mean that's makes it all very clear but doesn't do anything at
I'm not guaranteed anything by reason of the fact that god has it
dad when I have it done right I'll do it to satisfy him . 7230780_7233130
okay . 7235730_7235900
so that's that's what the that's the flea in the ointment as I
alright . 7245300_7245410
it still leaves me out_of out_of the way of reckoning with the
I can only start once more &-um mystified by my practical
nothing is more plain to me that it's worse than useless to be
that in fact if I have to follow the analyst account I find that
let's say could be read <as the> as the instructions for . 7284200_7286750
okay . 7288910_7289010
so that's another way . 7290290_7291150
of specifying dissatisfaction . 7291580_7293750
this time itself bothering . 7297040_7299510
you .
no it's not . 7299900_7300240
I don't think it's . 7300520_7301030
no . 7301160_7301270
I don't think it possibly could be anything like time itself . 7301360_7303820
no . 7304220_7304280
yeah . 7304610_7304790
&-um yeah . 7308070_7308740
no other questions . 7312500_7322640
yes . 7325670_7325830
a version what that might be . 7341380_7342560
&-uh I was only use I was using that phrase to speak of the to
<they don't> they don't do it other_than in detail . 7357530_7360240
and in that they're doing it to provide for the the just so of
speak of the the &-uh methodic character of that work . 7369350_7376080
however it's methodic not in satisfaction of a general notion of
alright . 7384570_7384700
but in the notion of effective production effective work that
the object you're looking for already is possessed of the methods
okay . 7407940_7408150
referred to then by the property &-uh by speaking of a unique of
so they'll be like . 7428500_7429230
&-uh I was using the the I was using &-uh how work on &-um
okay . 7438550_7438640
to &-uh &-uh to specify the the &-uh presence in and as a
so the mechanism that is all right the work getting done where the
uniquely adequate to the phenomenon it finds in the way in which it
then it's done . 7509250_7509960
then it's only in the greeting &-uh incourse coming to the thing
it's it is another kinda trick . 7522710_7527550
okay . 7528400_7528500
&-uh and and so the unique character unique adequacy speaks to
I mean speaks <to the to the to the> to the irremediable course
wanna put away chronological . 7546100_7546860
well and I wanna put away it's that under that kind of <if that's>
then the constructivist thing is like a only at best it's like a
and when when everything's into the suit you even pick up
but it fails you firmly . 7574570_7575960
&-um <if you're> if you're looking for that &-uh for those
Adequacies very interior production . 7587000_7590930
I'm sorry . 7594050_7594330
Jim say it again is . 7594740_7595480
the unique adequacy of the methods for accomplishing the yes . 7595650_7601140
&-uh is that the interior production . 7601910_7603500
very use is that the interior production . 7604220_7606660
yes . 7607450_7607480
that's the that's exactly right . 7607670_7608590
yes . 7609610_7609780
exactly <that would be> that would be a way . 7611050_7613950
provide provider solution . 7614170_7615280
could look like . 7615410_7615870
sure . 7617350_7617510
&-uh &-uh we were talking before about offering . 7620670_7625070
and one witnessing the typing with the fullest structure in the
yeah . 7650430_7650550
the &-um matter such_as the kids . 7652370_7655180
yeah sequencing and other timing matters . 7655650_7658150
and I &-um it seemed to me that that was what you were pointing
that .
his possibly his method of is uniquely adequate then too revealing
&-uh the internal of various call temporal tructure wanted better
sure . 7678610_7678700
sure . 7679220_7679310
and I just what occurred to me just now is could conceivably
if in the presentation what I'm doing now fumbling way which is the
&-uh you'd have to write a script for the temporal &-uh structuring
yeah . 7711560_7711670
you know what <I think> I think our questions are . 7712360_7714320
I'm at fault for having presented this . 7714670_7717030
let's say this document . 7717830_7718810
then provoking the question by announcing the dissatisfaction of
treating advocacy property is in fact there were general costs
&-uh there are I think the proper way to be dealing with the recess
I've done where the is then brought up in various ways . 7745600_7750590
for example I've used &-um &-um a so-called side tone delay
strange . 7773230_7773530
there's strange phrases that's . 7773620_7775660
and then reading these these phonetic sentence these
you have to sound them to hear what you're saying . 7785730_7787420
&-uh and <in that> in that procedure &-um the issue of unique
I mean you have to hear someone trying to read a sentence that
but he alone can't hear what he's saying . 7813580_7815610
right . 7817190_7817280
&-um and then you understand what that interior production could be
as_well_as understanding . 7827480_7828480
okay . 7829930_7830140
at that point for example all talk about the purpose of character
notes that that translate I say that exploit that the &-uh
okay . 7865980_7866140
in order then to turn &-uh &-uh those practices into &-uh really
&-uh now the thing that happens with that demonstration is that it
you you know <that that> that these other proposals won't
right . 7897870_7898010
&-um and bubble the thing is really neat because it happens when
it's a ire remediable enterprise . 7909540_7910510
I mean everybody who comes as you can get persons variously subject
so you don't get the kinda distortion of you know clear fashion as
but when they get to reading these kinetic appearing sentences
but that's written out_of such a fashion that when you read it
books and chairs . 7962610_7963720
so that would so you'd have d o o and then something like &-uh
and am &-uh that kind business . 7976610_7979000
so as you look at the script right you can't by reading it . 7979140_7983270
&-uh see what you're saying . 7984880_7986730
now the instructions are let's re say it . 7987460_7989800
say it . 7990120_7990400
now you're saying it in_order_to hear in what you're saying . 7991770_7994200
what you could be talking what you could be saying . 7994250_7996390
and under that . 7998440_7998670
you're not specifying the interior production . 8004630_8006240
you're immediately asking them to do the task . 8006290_8008000
what happens then is when you do the task in_order_to find what it
you have already to provide for the the thing said . 8013800_8016990
right the thing that you're saying that you're moving into ahead
so you you're putting in these built-in additive structures to a
so when you do it then you find that you you're <repeating and>
that it sounds like books you'll say books . 8055200_8057250
but then they can't make out the rest . 8057730_8059090
and while you're saying this persons witnessing it are they're
and they can't for the life of them figure out for christ sake . 8070140_8071780
it's so clear to us . 8071800_8072540
why isn't it clear to him . 8072660_8073630
okay . 8076850_8076960
so that would mean that that once they hear it it's available
and so I mean you're getting all this . 8084780_8085660
I don't mean that that what I'm saying there is that it will
okay . 8094290_8094530
that's one way . 8095100_8095380
then I think of it as come along the issue . 8095860_8098650
isid the unique advocacy talk as talk and backed up &-um of worldly
and that's one thing I'm I'm trying to think that the stuff
another source of such stuff . 8112880_8114200
but I'm not all together clear on how that would be exploited . 8114700_8117000
yeah . 8119080_8119140
&-uh Tara you used the term . 8119800_8121190
gloss on glossing . 8121420_8122630
yeah . 8123260_8123320
I think I'm not mistaken . 8124410_8125510
this is the word that pops up . 8127480_8128740
now I wonder if it has any special .
yeah . 8131340_8131470
that's discussed in the paper . 8131530_8132870
formal practical action . 8133270_8135450
well I'll tell you what I'm gonna do . 8148830_8149730
I'm gonna dump you outta here . 8149780_8150410
&-uh have quite afternoon . 8153690_8154330
we're gonna meet again on Tuesday . 8154380_8155480
