&=bell .
how about today ?
good morning .
stand up .
bow .
sit down .
okay .
it's supposed to be as usual so let's go on without being concerned about it .
anyway your face might not be taped .
&=laughs .
in reality, there might be dark lines in your faces .
&=laughs .
don't worry .
okay .
ahh .
okay, yesterday was about the relationship between parallel lines .
we ended quickly yesterday by doing some problems .
do you remember what they were ?
the first written problem on the handout we hurried through it yesterday, so we were not able to summarize it well at the end +...
so today in between the parallel lines there is one angle in the bend .
so first we will obtain that angle .
when I had you do the problems yesterday we had three problem solving methods that were presented +...
it's okay to use the method you think is the easiest .
please try to do the problem .
after you have finished writing, please add an explanation .
my my method is this and this way .
if you can also give an explanation that would be amazing .
this, right .
you're fast .
if you forgot how to solve it, it is okay to look at the previous handout .
xxx let me borrow this for me .
let me borrow this because he needs a pencil .
it's a little different +...
line +...
xxx .
umm .
okay .
are you done ?
can I ask ?
how is it ?
0 .
0 .
people who solved it ?
okay then +...
Arai .
yes .
okay, what did you do ?
fifty .
the fifty degree .
the line around it .
the line there extend it .
okay .
did you extend it like this ?
bring that over there .
uh fifty degrees .
alternate interior angles of it .
there .
that is fifty degrees so .
this ?
okay .
the right angle is thrity degrees .
if you add it all up it becomes one hundred and eighty degrees so .
a triangle .
yes .
yes .
the top part is one hundred degrees .
the one before .
a right angle is .
a right angle is .
um, it becomes one hundred and eighty degrees so .
okay .
not a straight line ?
a straight line becomes one hundred and eighty degrees .
yes .
so X is eighty .
okay .
is this okay ?
here we go .
okay .
we can see he was a little tense .
um, that was a clear method .
people who did it using this method ?
oh +...
okay .
about five people ?
okay, other methods .
okay, Bunya .
okay, please go ahead .
in the middle .
draw a +...
parallel line .
oops ?
okay .
then .
um, the top fifty degrees, the alternate interior angles of that .
yes .
it is made there so .
yes, well well, okay .
so it's fifty degrees .
the bottom is thirty degrees .
it can also be done in the same way .
add those together it becomes eighty degrees .
okay .
that's good .
the method was to use the alternate interior angles of the parallel lines .
good .
people who did it with this same method ?
okay .
right .
about eighty people .
okay .
are there any other methods ?
oh .
one person +...
chika .
yes .
okay .
umm, from point B .
from point B .
okay .
from point B .
okay .
is it +...
l ?
from the top line it would be an L, huh .
to the top straight line draw a perpendicular line .
then .
draw a perpendicular line from point B .
then .
the B area is sixty degrees .
umm well not really B, but between that perpendicular line and thirty degrees is a right angle .
so subtract thirty degrees from ninety degrees .
yes .
it becomes sixty degrees .
yes .
the area A is &~fi fifty degrees so .
umm, the straight line is one hundred and eighty degrees .
right .
angle A becomes one hundred and thirty degrees .
since if you add up all of the angles of a quadrilateral it becomes three hundred and sixty degrees .
umm, if you add what is this ?
it becomes two hundred and eighty degrees .
eight .
subtract two hundred and eighty degrees from three hundred and sixty degrees .
x became eighty degrees .
okay .
yes .
here we go .
okay .
people with the same method as this ?
oh .
just Doi .
okay .
good .
are there any more ?
think a little more .
I'm thinking .
okay ?
I am sure there are people who also extended this one .
here are methods like that .
basically these three are the ones you have thought of .
now I will summarize these into main points .
with just this diagram +...
with just this diagram we can't solve the problem .
so Sano and others extended the line to make a triangle .
bunya and others drew in a parallel line in the middle .
chika and others drew in a perpendicular line .
that means we can't solve it without auxiliary lines .
the auxiliary lines become important .
then by the way we draw the auxiliary lines in all we got three types .
sano's, Bunya's, Chika's .
0 .
they were different based on the way the auxiliary lines were drawn .
that means, one way is to draw a parallel line and use the alternate interior angles .
another is to extend the line and make +...
a triangle .
and use the fact that the sum of the angles of a triangle is one hundred and eighty degrees .
and Chika used the method that if we add the four angles of +...
a quadrilateral we get three hundred and sixty degrees .
these are the three we got .
0 .
now then, any method was okay, but the task was to do it using the easiest method .
and each person seemed to have selected one out of the three we summarized yesterday .
today's problems are ones that can't be solved without auxiliary lines .
we want to do problems of this kind .
today .
the way this problem is made is that .
it is a problem of an angle bent once between parallel lines .
the angle is bent once between parallel lines .
today by changing this condition, by changing this condition +...
I will have you make your own problems .
and today we won't change the parallel lines .
we won't change the parallel lines, but rather the middle .
change the middle means +/.
outside .
+, oh .
it's okay with the outside .
the outside can be good .
now it has one bend .
it is even okay to bend it twice .
I don't want you to bend it ten times .
&=laughs .
eda xxx .
eda difficult .
there are always at least two or three of you thinking about it ?
&=laughs .
I know there will be some .
but twice or three times .
that's the limit .
after that nobody will understand it .
you may be creative in between and change the number of bends, or .
it is also okay to use the outside with one bend, or it is also okay to be outside with two bends .
please think by yourselves .
you can't just go and bend it ten times .
don't draw random squiggly lines .
that is not good .
okay, umm, I have prepared two on your handout, but one is okay .
if it's easy please do two .
it is okay to bend twice or be outside .
then put in angles by yourselves and write in which angle is X, the one we need to obtain .
oh, if thirty students do it, if they made only one problem each we will have thirty problems .
it's actually pretty hard to put in the degrees .
you can't just put in any degrees .
do we also write the xxx .
when you turn it in you must be able to solve it .
if somebody says he or she doesn't understand it you must be able to say what and why the problem is .
please think about how the problem can be understood .
xxx .
a moment .
mmm .
wait a minute .
xxx .
um ?
this one, too ?
which one ?
0 .
huh ?
um by yourself .
it isn't okay if you try to solve it yourself and find it can be solved, right ?
these are the same, since there is only one bend between the parallel lines, it's the same as this .
try to change it .
oh, it looks difficult .
it looks pretty tough .
this also looks difficult .
you can put the bends in, but does the number fit in, is the problem .
isn't it +/.
++ it has to be a problem you can solve .
it can be the second one or the outside .
bam, bam, and it can be bent on the outside .
or you can bend it once, twice .
xxx just one ?
whichever equals .
if you make it too hard, well it'll be +...
stressful .
how many times is this bent ?
one, two, three, four times it has been bent .
it's been bent too many times .
is this okay for the first one ?
what ?
is this okay for the first one ?
you can't solve this .
what ?
without another angle I don't think it can't be solved .
what ?
if you try to solve it and you can solve it yourself then it is okay .
isn't it difficult ?
this is difficult .
if you have finished .
where do you solve for this ?
hum ?
where do you solve for this problem ?
for this, it is for this .
here ?
then what is this ?
xxx .
there's a reason for this .
it starts at point A and goes through point B and +/.
++ ah, I see .
ahh, it looks hard .
this is simple .
ahh, it is hard .
xxx like these .
like this .
this looks hard .
this is ninety degrees .
oh, I made a mistake .
this is going to be hard .
this sixty five degrees is last .
eventually, if you extend it here is sixty two .
this is one hundred and eighty degrees .
two hundred, two hundred and twenty .
ah .
is this sixty two degrees ?
there .
here, lend it to me .
one hundred twenty .
xxx .
at fifteen you can do it .
are you done writing ?
are you finished ?
it seems hard .
let's try hard to do one problem .
try hard to make one problem .
understand .
okay ?
um, if you put it on the inside maybe it'll be easier to solve .
wow .
this is how you take off from A and bend and reach B .
what does that mean for A ?
this is fine .
is it solvable ?
you can solve this .
it is solvable .
yes .
it won't be solvable without these angles here .
what ?
add this, like this ?
where ?
like this .
if you extend it +...
it's sixty degrees .
where ?
this, isn't this sixty degrees, this +...
like this isn't sixty degrees ?
that doesn't work if this and this are not parallel .
if you draw a parallel line .
if you draw a parallel line .
if this and this are not parallel then this angle is not sixty degrees .
this angle, too +...
can't be used under that assumption ?
no .
if they're parallel lines then just put in the symbol for parallel lines here .
xxx .
thank you very much .
I don't know if they'll understand this .
it looks a little tough .
this is too difficult .
xxx .
and right +...
I made it too difficult .
I made it too difficult .
here it's hard .
if there isn't an angle here it can't be understood .
just put something in .
you guys seemed to have learned that any number just doesn't fit in .
you guys seemed to have learned that any number just doesn't fit in .
how many bends are there ?
one, two, three, four, five bends .
if you don't make it at most three then it will be impossible .
I understand .
xxx .
let's see .
what time ?
well it seems it was a little hard .
I made a mistake .
there are many of you that are in trouble .
well there are not that many people with one, two done, but there seems to be a lot of people with one done so .
get in your groups and +...
from the problems you have made +...
pick a problem you and others think is challenging, and group leaders please bring them up here .
please check if the problem can be really solved and then bring it up .
one problem is enough .
there are problems that can't be solved .
how about this one ?
this ?
&~th &~th this xxx .
xxx it seems hard .
can't it be solved ?
you don't have to make a new problem at this point .
just from the currents ones you have .
this is a good problem .
is it good ?
yes, because it's two bends, and the bends are different .
and this is also a good problem, whether you can do it or not, change that part .
not too much .
up to number two ?
xxx a quadrilateral .
ha ha .
indeed .
a quadrilateral .
a quadrilateral ?
xxx .
who made this ?
&~masa +...
hara .
umm .
you can't solve it .
mmm .
can they do it or not ?
yes .
hey, let's bring up one .
ha, it looks like a hard one .
whose is it ?
xxx .
from which group ?
from group number five .
this one ?
right .
group five .
ah .
it's a hard one .
oh, the diagram was too small .
you're completely wrong .
do you know what you are doing ?
this part is easy .
here .
here teacher .
this which group ?
this one .
this can't be used .
it can't ?
uh huh .
because this is bent many times .
yes .
teacher .
this one .
just a little more this is too hard .
he said it was too hard .
oh, it looks like a good problem .
what group ?
group one .
group one ?
group one ?
group one .
the diagram is a little +...
here .
which number ?
number four .
number four can you really solve it ?
that can be solved easily .
we can .
it seems .
is this all ?
yes .
okay, that's good .
yes .
next, who's next ?
it's easy .
that one .
don't say anything yet .
don't say anything .
groups that have not yet brought up one, please hurry up .
teacher, I solved this .
I wonder .
it can it can be solved teacher .
can this be solved ?
I believe it can be solved .
I think it is impossible .
impossible ?
this one, this one .
which one ?
this one, this one .
xxx .
mm .
it's probably right ?
which one is that, group three ?
group three .
the second time is hard but easy .
number one is easy, too .
now number four is left .
which number ?
number four .
number four ?
number four .
it might be complex .
right, it's different .
it might be complex, okay ?
I'll do number four just a little .
sorry, okay ?
can it be solved ?
it can be solved .
you're able to solve it ?
hum .
hum oh .
oh .
what number ?
hum .
okay .
they are problems that we don't know if we can solve or not until we try .
I'm sorry for taking so much time, but there are six problems on the right side .
xxx if we can solve it or not .
I wonder .
it seems impossible to do all of them in this time so .
so we'll think about them a little next time, too .
please hurry up and copy the six problems .
imai is X here ?
hum .
xxx .
oh, I got it .
can you solve it ?
I got it .
I got it .
they really seem challenging, huh ?
there seems to be one that is too challenging .
xxx .
they are really challenging, like eating a dried squid .
&=laughs .
umm, this one is not that bad .
umm +...
I'll say it's like a piece of gum .
gum .
gum .
&~gu gum .
oh, group two's, group two's, the one on the top .
umm .
group four .
this is a rock .
&=laughs .
then this is a rock .
umm .
um um um .
rice cracker .
number five .
number five .
0 .
isn't it easy ?
rock, it's a rock .
then I'm sorry there isn't much time, but there are six problems .
there may be ones from your own group .
there may be ones that are yours .
please copy them .
it can be from number one .
it can also be from the hardest one .
xxx this is gum .
that means since today's problems can't be solved without auxiliary lines +...
what kind of auxiliary lines .
it can't be solved without auxiliary lines .
gum .
if you need the auxiliary lines the problem is what kind of auxiliary lines should you use .
there were three, but which one is the easiest way to do it .
for now please finish copying the problems by thirty five after the hour .
I think +...
the answers will be given next period .
what shall I do ?
huh ?
can you solve this ?
I don't know .
this is well +...
this is really hard .
genji's symbol is good .
it's there nicely working .
are there any groups that were able to solve them ?
plus fifteen .
xxx since it's fifteen degrees, so ninety .
ooh .
not so xxx .
oh the rice cracker hard problem seems to be solved .
xxx fifteen .
it's thirty degrees .
teacher .
fifteen .
fifteen, fifteen, thrity, ninety, ninety .
it's not ninety, ninety .
ooh .
ninety nine ?
one hundred .
hundred .
plus .
xxx .
it's correct .
we got this .
we solved this .
the rock ?
later .
we'll check it later .
we'll check it later .
no, at the time at the time I was solving it I was thinking that I couldn't solve it .
I didn't write the group names .
0 .
0 .
0 .
since all of them are challenging we can't solve it just like that .
let's do it step by step .
people who are done solving the problem from group one ?
okay good .
group two's ?
a little more .
straight .
raise your hands straight .
ahh, about the same .
group three's ?
oh .
group four's ?
okay .
group five's ?
okay .
group six's ?
really .
group six's .
okay good .
number six is easy so +...
xxx .
there is an even harder one .
this one seems more likely to work out .
I haven't gotten this one yet, but +...
it's hard ?
I just finally got it .
is it group one or group two ?
one hundred eighty degrees ?
umm .
is this forty ?
umm .
forty degrees .
one hundred twenty degrees .
one hundred twenty degrees .
why is that ?
xxx isn't this forty seven ?
right here .
this is easier .
umm .
this one symbol .
if you miss that one symbol +...
you can't solve the problem .
this is parallel .
this and this are parallel .
without that you can't solve it .
that's right .
that's right .
that's right .
if you do that .
it's about done .
group one's is hard .
I think group one's is really hard .
how you draw the auxiliary lines makes the difference .
something +...
one hundred ninety .
this is one hundred and ninety .
number eight .
number two .
number eight .
number eight .
xxx .
okay, do you want to try it again ?
I'll give you a hint .
try extending this further .
try extending the auxiliary line further .
teacher .
try this one .
this one is easier .
there is a symbol included here .
this parallel symbol .
extend the auxiliary line all the way to here .
try extending it .
yes, yes .
this and this are parallel .
if you use xxx angles this angle becomes the xxx .
this is a straight line so you know it .
so you somehow get this angle .
you know this angle and this angle xxx .
if you write in as much as you know +...
it'll work .
oh that's good .
they're the right auxiliary lines .
umm .
ahh, this is xxx .
this is hard .
you can't solve it without auxiliary lines .
that's good .
umm, one hundred and twenty degrees and then the straight line .
like this line and like this, use auxiliary lines and try drawing it .
it's good to draw auxiliary lines .
man .
this one is amazing .
umm, I see .
do it one more time .
I did it once .
a mistake .
uh I thought it was wrong .
xxx .
umm um .
that it .
that's it .
that's it .
xxx ?
xxx .
umm, that one .
umm, um, um .
divide it around here .
it's the auxiliary lines .
auxilary lines .
it's a lot different with another auxiliary line .
but even if you didn't get the last one, you got this one, right ?
this and this are parallel .
and here and here are corresponding angles, and you get here .
you got there and with that +...
this is going to be a little bothersome but, well, I want to know the present situation .
people who are done with group one's ?
you solved it ?
umm .
group two's ?
oh, okay .
group three's ?
um, okay .
group four's ?
up to where did you get to ?
um .
group five's ?
hum .
two people .
this was a hard one .
umm .
so that's it .
group six's ?
group six's was simple .
it was very troublesome .
okay .
did you do it ?
xxx okay then there are a lot of people who are using triangles .
&=bell .
that's okay, but there were three types of auxiliary lines .
there are other easier methods of solving +...
using other types of auxiliary lines .
we will check these in the next period .
return to your desks .
never .
you can never do this one .
who got group four's ?
who said he or she got group four's ?
fujita Today .
okay .
please end the class .
there's no math class tomorrow so let's check them the day after tomorrow .
okay .
do we have math the day after tomorrow ?
we have math class the day after tomorrow right ?
the day after tomorrow is Thursday .
thursday .
did it change ?
thursday ?
the day after tomorrow is Friday .
huh ?
today is what day of the week ?
tuesday ?
today is Tuesday .
tomorrow ?
wednesday .
day after tomorrow ?
thursday .
that's right .
I got it .
okay .
go ahead .
stand up .
bow
