here's our Venn diagram . 745_1825
whose name do we need to put at the top of the one side ? 2625_6505
what's our one character's name, Sone ? 6845_9045

and what is our other character's name ? 20525_23665
S_two .
Kailash .

now I do have a question for you as we are finishing up . 559805_563145
why do you think the author wrote this book ? 564345_567145
why do you think the author wrote this book ? 567865_571885

I like it . 588295_588915
why else, S_ten ? 589035_589815
that everybody's different . 590275_593855
that everybody is different . 594315_595975
and could you add to that S_eleven ? 597015_599355
maybe that Kailash might have been, they might have had a, maybe thought +... 599595_610615
the author might have had a best friend that was exactly like this . 613105_619025
maybe the author knew somebody like Kailash ? 620245_623345
maybe he was Kailash's friend named Elliott . 623525_627545
maybe . 628105_628345
anything else ? 628865_629825
S_four .
everybody's special . 630025_631945
everybody is special, right ? 632305_633965
I like that . 634625_635485
the author wanted to let people know that everybody's special . 635565_638065
S_twelve .
everybody's different . 642835_643715
everybody has something different and everybody has something alike . 644375_649135

who could repeat what S_twelve said ? 659735_661695
S_trhirteen .
everybody's different, but everybody's alike . 662395_667715
everybody's different in some ways, but we're all alike in a lot of ways too . 668475_675055
exactly . 675595_675695
so even though they have a lot of things that are different about them, they're still alike in a lot of ways . 676615_684375
so same, same, but different, different, different, but the same . 685555_693835
same .
the same . 694395_694775
I think that's why maybe the author changed at the end to show, is that even though they're different, different, there's a lot of things that are the +... 695205_702285
same .
