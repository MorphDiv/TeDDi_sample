that's back to the beginning of the chapter where the central angle is gonna be the same as whatever that arc that it intercepts . 0_4335
correct ? 4335_4838
angle two . 4838_7063
thirty degrees . 7063_8158
where do they come up with that one ? 8158_9280
go ahead . 9280_10973
triangle a@l p@l v@l is isosceles, so angle three and angle two have to be congruent . 10973_18901
okay . 18901_19486
and since all angles in a triangle have to add up to one hundred and eighty degrees, you take one eighty +... 19486_26263
you subtract one twenty and you divide them into sixty five . 26263_29301
very good . 29301_30831
you get thirty degrees . 30831_31581
so where do we come up with this one ? 31581_34651
p@l v@l c@l . 34651_35531
p@l v@l c@l . 35531_36918
that's the one they left blank in this first first box . 36918_47636
you're on a roll, let's go . 47636_55268
yeah, p@l v@l c@l has to be a right angle because it intercepts v@l c@l . 55268_62345
okay . 62345_62691
they say radius to that tangent we learned that +... 62691_65340
oh, yeah . 65340_65915
back in the beginning, nine two or nine three . 65915_70045
it had to be nine two because we just went over nine three . 70045_74018
nine two, that the radius that intercepts that has that same tangent point +... 74018_80251
that's gonna be ninety degrees . 80251_84283
that wasn't the hard part . 84283_85920
measure of angle a@l v@l c@l . 85920_89393
how would you get that one ? 89393_90186
a v@l c@l . 90186_93616
they say sixty degrees . 93616_95536
go ahead . 95536_98321
if a@l v@l c@l is ninety degrees and angle two is thirty degrees xxx . 98321_104736
okay . 104736_105801
and you get sixty . 105801_106743
this kind of this being sixty degrees, how does that relate to back here, the arc ? 106743_112006
half . 112006_112601
Matt says it's half . 112601_114521
Mike says it's half . 114521_115303
okay . 115303_117630
so the measure of an acute secant tangent angle with its vertex on the circle is +... 117630_123058
half . 123058_124313
one half the measure on the intercepted arc . 124313_126631
so we got two cases down . 126631_130398
we got if it's a ninety degrees angle with a secant and tangent, we got acute angles . 130398_134886
what do you think this +... 134886_139353
general statement +... 139353_142158
here, measure of arc a@l v@l if it's x@l, what's angle one gonna be ? 142158_151796
x@l . 151796_152656
x@l . 152656_153231
okay . 153231_153831
what about the measure of angle two ? 153831_155591
Michaela, describe that for us . 155591_158850
Suzy ? 158850_160946
you first have to do one eighty minus x@l xxx and then you divide it by two . 160946_168481
divide it by two . 168481_169111
then they'll be the same as three . 169111_170918
these angles are gonna be the same . 170918_172381
okay ? 172381_173215
how about p@l v@l C ? 173215_175073
that's going to be +... 175073_176061
ninety degrees . 176061_179380
ninety degrees . 179380_180730
okay . 180730_181178
that's not gonna that's not gonna change . 181178_183825
and so the last here this angle is going to be what ? 183825_187991
half of the arc . 187991_189241
half of the arc . 189241_190696
which is ? 190696_191513
half x@l . 191513_193008
x@l . 193008_193386
okay . 193386_196136
so we know it works for that same intersected arc intercepted arc theorem, works for ninety degrees, works for acute angles . 196136_208130
last case is obtuse angles . 208130_210960
this one is a little bit more tricky . 210960_213890
you might have a little bit more trouble doing this one . 213890_215775
if it's obtuse, they give you a@l x@l v@l around this way, is two hundred degrees +... 215775_225031
and they come up with this measure of angle one being a hundred and sixty . 225031_228335
how do you think they got that ? 228335_229861
Melissa ? 229861_236573
full circle has to equal three hundred and sixty degrees, take away the two hundred . 236573_242821
good . 242821_243318
if you add that whole circle it's three hundred sixty, then the central angle on the other side +... 243318_247716
we take away two hundred, it's gonna leave you with one sixty . 247716_251268
okay . 251268_252506
so that gives you angle one . 252506_254013
measure of angle two here . 254013_255581
how do you get that one ? 255581_256756
um, the triangle +... 256756_260220
triangle um +... 260220_263538
serum theorem . 263538_264628
it has to be equal to one eighty . 264628_266076
okay . 266076_266460
equal one eighty, so +... 266460_267708
if angle one is already one sixty, then angle two and angle three are equal . 267708_271908
good . 271908_272420
that leaves you with twenty, which means one of them has to be ten . 272420_276361
okay . 276361_276901
how about p@l v@l c@l ? 276901_278770
anything different about that one than the other example ? 278770_281571
no . 281571_282161
no . 282161_282531
it's gotta be ninety . 282531_283490
I'm just gonna copy that one down right now . 283490_285361
and how about the last one, this whole a@l v@l c@l . 285361_291065
the actual obtuse angle . 291065_292625
it says it's one hundred . 292625_293713
if you're following a pattern, what are you getting ? 293713_296656
half . 296656_297416
it's gonna be +... 297416_298153
half . 298153_298616
half . 298616_298968
okay ? 298968_299833
so, I'm just gonna fill this in now . 299833_302921
measure of an obtuse secant tangent angle with its vertex on a circle is one half the measure of its intercepted arc . 302921_312328
so let's fill this in . 312328_313823
for measure of angle a@l v@l c@l, how would you relate that back to x@l for any for any measure ? 313823_319703
x@l over two . 319703_320573
x@l over two . 320573_321165
okay . 321165_322800
I'm just gonna work my way backwards . 322800_324368
we know the ninety . 324368_325438
well, let's go to angle one . 325438_327668
how would you figure out angle one if you know x@l for a@l x@l v@l ? 327668_330933
three sixty minus x@l . 330933_332126
three sixty minus x@l . 332126_335476
oh, I was gonna write x@l over two . 335476_338061
three sixty minus x@l . 338061_339508
and Katie, how would you do that last one, that angle two ? 339508_345868
angle two would be xxx . 345868_353100
this one's a little bit tricky . 353100_353725
the one eighty thing works like I know how to explain it I'm not sure exactly what the equation is, but I could do it . 353725_361346
okay . 361346_361803
like I +... 361803_362285
so tell me what to do and we'll try to put it in x@l for you . 362285_365715
all right . 365715_367003
you have to get the measure of angle a@l p@l v@l . 367003_373211
okay . 373211_373923
and then +... 373923_375193
that's three hundred sixty minus x@l . 375193_377290
yeah . 377290_377586
okay . 377586_378091
and then you would take the other two since it's an isosceles triangle and +... 378091_382193
xxx have to be equal so you have divide whatever the original angle is . 382193_387336
like it I don't know . 387336_389443
I'm sorry . 389443_389858
you subtract a@l p@l v@l from one eighty and then divide it by two . 389858_395610
that's what I would do anyway . 395610_398368
okay . 398368_398671
so, one eighty minus what we get from angle one . 398671_401850
I'm gonna put measure of angle one right here . 401850_404071
minus measure of angle one, and then you take that and divide it by +... 404071_407785
two . 407785_410201
two . 410201_410480
good . 410480_410880
sorry . 410880_411328
xxx . 411328_415618
I couldn't fit all that in that little, little box . 415618_417345
so you get the theorem . 417345_419455
this kind of all these build upon each other, you get the ninety, the acute, and the obtuse angles . 419455_425570
they all come out to this theorem, where no matter what, if you have that secant and the tangent +... 425570_429920
it could be a chord and a tangent, you're gonna come up with what ? 429920_435765
nine . 435765_437191
if you have an angle that intersects with a secant and a tangent all in the circle ? 437191_440743
it's always gonna come up to be +... 440743_443998
half . 443998_444558
half of that arc . 444558_445561
you have any questions on that ? 445561_452398
I'm gonna wait to give you an example for that one until we get to the other side . 452398_459103
turn the page . 459103_459726
I guess I don't have one for this page, so we're gonna have to do this, just out loud together . 459726_476213
so look at the top for activity two . 476213_479466
they're kind of similar, but you have now where the vertex is inside the circle +... 479466_489945
you have the intersection of two secants inside the circle, and they want to figure out how you can get those angle measures . 489945_499383
so look at the first one across for number table two . 499383_504040
you have the measure of arc a@l c@l gives you one hundred and sixty . 504040_510535
then you have b@l d@l . 510535_511781
that gives you forty degrees . 511781_513503
how about where did they get measure of angle one, do you think ? 513503_517919
it says eighty degrees . 517919_520751
where do you think they got that ? 520751_522078
Leah ? 522078_525141
arc a@l c@l equals one sixty, and angle one is an inscribed angle, so it's half of a@l c@l . 525141_537073
yes . 537073_537398
good . 537398_538135
and since a@l c@l is one sixty, half is eighty . 538135_540053
good . 540053_540421
good . 540421_541126
that's what we actually just talked about reviewing from nine point three . 541126_546165
so, how about angle two ? 546165_549195
Melissa ? 549195_551891
b@l d@l is forty xxx, so angle of that, so it's half . 551891_560580
okay . 560580_561051
good . 561051_562376
how about a@l v@l c@l ? 562376_564450
it's one hundred degrees . 564450_565571
