(o)kay . 34424_34726
<basically> you have uh <this> this mm uhm (..) heirarchy
<okay> . 36669_36936
you build upon your knowledge and <early kn(owledge)> later
<and see> you've start up with some basic stuff that you can do
<hm> . 45737_46016
m hm . 48083_48280
so <the> <the> the map is uh a two D world <with a>
<hm> . 52045_52486
alright . 54472_54785
that's cool . 54739_55203
so . 55749_56062
(o)kay . 56097_56527

at this stage are you trying to get more land or you build ? 58414_60458
or ? 61177_61537
right . 61603_61893
uhm <the> the first thing you have to +//. 61963_63217
uh it's all based around cities . 63240_64598
hm . 64761_65132
so . 65364_65864
what you have to do is <you b(uild)> you create and build +//.
you create cities . 68476_69312
and then you +//. 69733_70418
those cities grow and then you use those cities to build more units
then you know you can basically start to (..) <terra(form)>
okay . 77674_77987
<yeah> . 77964_78312
<so on> and so forth . 78034_78788
yeah . 79009_79241
so the first thing you need to do is build a city . 79439_80843
oka:y . 81404_82042
so you have to fiind an area to build it . 82159_83703
alright . 84202_84388
so just kind of wonder around the map ? 84376_86129
yeah . 86501_86768
<now you can't> see much of the map . 87375_88454
<alright> . 87398_87851
