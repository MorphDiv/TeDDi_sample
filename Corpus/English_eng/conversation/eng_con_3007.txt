&=standing_up_front okay, Ladies and Gentlemen . 348_731
What I would like &=looking_around
We spent a lot of time, 1620_2563
and Jason had proposed one possible uhm +/. 7635_11261
solution . 11261_12445
solution . 12445_13111
&=drawing_on_board 13111_13990
I'm drawing it backwards 15331_16700
you guys decided that Jason's was incorrect because ? 20485_25798
&=rising_intonation_and_standing_to_side_of_drawing 25798_26270
why was Jason's not right ? 27013_28651
&=drawing_the_left_vertical_portion_of_the_inner_rectangle . 28651_30510
&=say_dimensions_are wrong 30510_35380
&=makes_changes . 35868_37948
Why was Jason's +... 37948_43460
Do you guys remember that ? 43460_44386
Why was Jason's not right ? 44386_45280
Because xxx . 45280_50421
It was right . 50421_50843
It wasn't an even border 50843_52253
We needed to have an even border . 52683_54635
&=finishes_drawing_the_inner_rectangle . 54635_57161
and, you guys found that this area of this part +... 57161_60268
&=shading_in_the_border_region_blue . 60268_65638
You guys found that this area was equal to: 65638_68203
Is that true ? 77108_80101
&=turning_and_looking_briefly_at_the_s's . 80101_81498
And then the area inside of here 81498_83780
you guys found 84235_84835
sixteen: eighty or something ? 91925_94268
Is that right ? 94268_95253
Feet squared . 95253_98196
okay . 98196_99563
&=walking_to_the_back_of_the_classroom . 99563_101060
&=standing_toward_the_back_of_the_classroom 101060_102301
So, what I wanted to do 107785_111340
You guys found what the answer would be for these two borders . 118361_121258
what would have had to have been cut into this court 121258_124948
&=erasing_some_of_the_border_shading . 133915_141608
So, this is my 141608_142580
What Jason had proposed didn't work, 143316_148101
Let's xxx work guess and check +... 151451_153621
We want xxx guess and check . 153621_156380
we want to also be able to write 156380_157485
So, to have an equation, 162035_163806
So, in this problem +... 166108_167901
I kind of gave it away . 167901_168860
what I wrote, oh, well 168860_170851
what would my variable be ? 171460_172963
xxx 172963_174605
Oh, not all at once . 180940_182141
What would my variable be in this ? 182141_186010
What am I trying to figure out here ? 186010_187263
&=calling_on_G okay, G ? 187263_189966
You're trying to figure out the two lengths of the inside square . 189966_193436
I'm sorry . 193436_194803
I couldn't concentrate on what you were saying . 194803_196201
You're trying to find out the two lengths of the inside 196201_200466
the two lengths ? 203051_203468
What do you mean 'the two lengths' ? 203468_204888
of the inside square, like 204888_207016
&=indicates_length_and_width_of_inner_rectangle_on_board 207321_207650
yeah . 208338_209146
You could put them as x@l and y . 209146_214775
&=labeling_the_vertical_length_x_and_horizontal_length_y 214775_215295
okay 217756_219836
so, is there any way I can write an equation for this ? 220221_224218
&=raising_hand_and_beginning_to_speak_when_T_looks_at_her 224218_227073
&=leaning_forward_and_looking_back_at_the_diagram 234783_236038
where'd you get that from ? 238956_239780
can I go up and show you xxx 239780_241331
&=up_at_board 243305_244043
This length right here is forty . 246096_248393
And this is um x@l 248393_250675
So, if you do forty minus x@l 250898_253016
That's what I came up with . 257618_258883
I don't 258863_259415
And then seventy two minus y@l 260751_263440
I don't know . 264591_267621
I tried 267621_268068
Does it work ? 268796_270830
You could make it into, like +... 270830_273485
Cause xxx &=and_indicating_parts_of_the_diagram . 273485_275238
Could you write out what you're saying ? 275238_277150
I'm having a hard timehearing it . 277150_278460
&=writing_on_board so, if you do seventy two minus y . 278460_285276
uh huh . 285276_288501
&=writing_and_speaking 288501_289030
And then you'll get the 293693_295741
So, then you'd divide it by two . 302135_303566
You're trying to get what ? 303566_305095
Cause remember how you said that we were trying to get what this is
uh huh . 308301_308765
So, then if you divide it 308765_310211
Yeah, but I don't have enough numbers to get it, though, do I ? 312531_316285
0
Well, you do if you know what x@l and y@l are . 317395_318628
Yeah . 318628_319068
That's what I'm trying to say 319068_319986
Ok, and, so then how would I write an equation with those things ? 324353_327303
ummm 327303_330480
does anybody have . 333568_334958
I wrote this yesterday . 334958_336143
I just +... 336143_336646
Ok . 336646_336885
No . 336885_337220
So, do you guys understand what 337220_338485
&=walks_toward_seat . 343780_344340
one of the question marks ? 344340_345840
Which question mark is it going to be ? 345840_348161
&=walking_back_up_to_the_board . 348161_348801
Oh . 348801_349185
It would be the 349185_352096
Ok . 353856_354360
Couldn't you use substitution since you have two equations ? 354360_359001
I mean, you could make another equation x@l times y@l equals one
Yeah, 362568_363438
I just didn't write that down . 364778_365950
So, 366738_367330
So, now you have two 369156_370706
So, 372748_373051
and then you can +... 375506_378481
Ok, so I see one equa(l) 378481_383478
x times y@l equals one thousand, six hundred and eighty . 384861_388001
uhh . 388001_389710
well +... 389710_390115
Do you have a question 390115_391163
Cause you 393276_394283
&=raises_hand . 396503_397603
Yeah, N . 397603_398148
Why do you divide by two ? 398148_399706
Cause you're trying to figure out this 399706_402978
oh, yeah . 403748_404650
I think it's because you're trying to figure out this and this . 404650_406286
I I I wrote this yesterday 406286_408078
Yeah, that is . 411430_412238
It's 412238_413131
Yeah, so, and I also put this was equal to each other . 413588_416281
but I don't think that's right, so 416556_417606
Umm . 418821_419406
Is seventy two minus 419406_420371
&=motioning_horizontally_with_her_hand 422756_423140
Yeah . 425516_425821
Cause it's seventy 425821_427645
&=motioning_again_with_hands find . 430861_432251
these two 432251_432935
So, if you get seventy two minus y, you're going to get 433943_437535
And they're both going to equal the same number . 439128_440040
Yeah . 440040_440551
The reason you divide it by two is so that you can find the 440551_443596
Yeah . 445558_446630
So 446630_450260
How could you 451948_454041
what 456106_456603
X and y@l are going to equal the same number ? 457755_459260
No 459260_459890
yeah . 460605_461003
seventy two 461003_461890
They're both going to equal the same number . 467385_468573
okay . 468573_468891
&=pointing_to_board can you show that up there ? 468891_470428
Can you change what's written up there so that you know 470428_472498
Like, make another variable ? 474115_475411
Do we need to have another variable ? 475411_477368
I think we've got plenty 477368_479976
Well, all I'm 481625_483431
&=getting_up_from_seat_and_walking_toward_board so, she's saying 483960_485056
They shouldn't be equal to each other, right ? 485736_487013
What shouldn't be equal to each other ? 487013_488660
Oh ! 488660_489135
I get it ! 489135_489735
The seventy two minus y@l divided by two and the forty minus x@l
&=writing_on_board xxx an equal sign right here . 491420_492826
Yeah . 492826_493235
I put one there . 493235_494076
I just didn't know if it was right . 494076_495048
&=turning_to_class_and_pointing_at_the_equation 495048_495338
Yeah . 495835_496265
Uhhuh . 496265_496643
Yeah . 496643_497115
&=Standing_in_front_of_diagram okay . 497115_498496
This is very interesting . 498496_499651
This is a completely different way than I looked at it . 499651_502096
I only had one 502096_503213
&=moving_to_side_of_board . 507408_507793
So, you guys are going to get 507793_509660
These two equations ? 515395_515913
You guys agree with everything that's written there ? 515913_519488
Yeah . 519488_521056
&=students_raise_hand I've got a question . 521056_525728
So, are we looking for the question mark or the x@l and y, or are
Both . 531768_534175
&=walking_over_and_pointing_to_questions_marks_on_diagram 534175_534626
So, she kind of found the question marks 542068_545468
So, what we 549331_553730
what's the question of this problem ? 554096_554860
What's the big question that it's asking 555411_556315
Usually, you just look at the last sentence +... 557315_559723
xxx . 559723_560005
How many huh ? 560005_561746
How many laps did she have to do to walk 561746_564018
How many laps 566218_567433
