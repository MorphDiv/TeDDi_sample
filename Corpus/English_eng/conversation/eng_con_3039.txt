what will happen if I fold Asratu's in half that would never happen
um nothing . 8154_11890
yup there is something . 11890_13520
uh . 13520_15073
(be)cause that's the test I did when I picked up your core squares
I did exactly what I'm asking you to do now . 20488_23210
I imagined folding them . 23210_25543
and asked myself a question . 25543_28036
I imagined folding them in half . 28036_29583
and I said this one is symmetrical . 29583_31470
this one is not . 31470_33106
so that's what I need you to do . 33106_35051
imagine folding them . 35051_37303
&~in +/. 37303_39316
along along any of those lines that we found that would fold it in
and see what you find out . 43680_46698
+^ Dani ? 46698_47346
we're up here . 47346_48640
thank you . 48640_49806
Nathan I saw your hand up for a minute . 49806_51315
thank you for letting me finish my sentence . 51315_52638
tell us what you're thinking . 52638_53606
even if it's just a wild guess . 53606_54965
I forgot what I was going to say I guess . 54965_59430
what will happen if I fold Asratu's in half ? 59430_62353
the um &~d which way you mean this way or this +... 62353_67240
which way do you mean ? 67240_68710
um . 68710_69743
imagine folding it in half in your mind does anything neat happen
just so that it's in half . 74710_75805
I don't mean like folding down a corner . 75805_78171
but I mean <those ways that we talked about folding it in half
< um if you um if you fold it um> . 84773_85943
from like like this so um that <um the top line &~i > +/. 85943_90853
wait like like this ? 90853_91670
yeah like that there'll be a triangle a full triangle that's
okay . 102073_103006
which way is this triangle pointing ? 103006_105286
down . 105286_106455
down . 106455_106883
and on this side it's pointing <up> . 106883_107953
up . 107953_108473
but there is a full triangle . 108473_109451
okay . 109451_110216
what are you thinking Justin about that one ? 110216_111988
um if you fold it sideways the green is on the other green and the
the red is &~of the red is on the other red and the +... 115871_119310
listen to Justin's idea . 119310_121486
he says if I fold it sideways . 121486_122906
not the same as Nathan imagined folding it but like this he says
and Kevin just said what ? 131346_132895
um all the whole inside is the same as the outside (be)cause
hey . 140830_141993
is there any way I could do that to yours Kevin ? 141993_144543
no . 144543_145615
is there anyway I could fold it so that every part touched a part
no no no . 149818_150245
um what about this one ? 150245_152916
this is Ashley's . 152916_154330
is there a way I can fold it so that every part +/. 154330_158896
no . 158896_159446
yes yes . 159446_161263
Nathan what are you thinking ? 161263_162213
diagonal . 162213_163246
which way from here to here ? 163246_164980
no go the other way . 164980_166728
this this way ? 166728_167841
yeah . 167841_168238
hmm . 168238_173031
(o)kay now watch . 173031_176285
oh yeah . 176285_178396
if I hold it like that maybe it helps you see &~b +//. 178396_182696
let's see green touches green red touches red yellow touches yellow
this was Ashley's . 188723_190873
um what about Alex's ? 190873_194616
sorry . 194616_195548
Alex's ? 195548_196290
um . 196290_197173
is there a way I can fold Alex's +. 197173_198718
yeah . 198718_199165
yes . 199165_200131
so that the parts will match exactly ? 200131_201330
sideways . 201330_202515
you fold it like this . 202515_203408
see ? 203408_206418
that's all touching . 206418_208546
the green touches the green . 208546_209541
the red is touching the red . 209541_211311
the blue touches the blue and the red touches the red . 211311_215045
that design . 215045_216513
that design . 216513_218141
I have such problems . 218141_219341
okay, there we go . 219341_220090
okay Paul's . 220090_221308
no it's not &~symm +/. 221308_222975
is there a way I can fold it ? 222975_223656
yeah . 223656_224273
yes . 224273_224558
you can't . 224558_225673
up down turn . 225673_228046
up down . 228046_228423
up or down ? 228423_229145
I'ma try that (be)cause I did see blue on the top
what do we find out though ? 233156_233931
when I do that oh orange doesn't touch orange does I mean a
no . 241031_241611
nope (be)cause those triangles weren't quite there but the blue
well what if I try doing it a different way maybe diagonally we got
no . 251728_252875
no . 252875_253175
no . 253175_253410
no um . 253410_254081
we have part of it on the end . 254081_257143
what about um what about mine ? 257143_259008
what about mine . 259008_259906
it's not symmetrical . 259906_261441
so what does that mean ? 261441_262376
(be)cause it has one corner +... 262376_264128
because it only has one corner that's green and one corner that's
one corner that's green xxx . 267843_268610
but well uh but if I divided this corner like that I could have
haha . 273505_274743
yeah but then all the other colors like the red wouldn't be
yes it is . 278705_279888
yeah red's touching the red right there and right there . 279888_281976
right here . 281976_283708
the red triangle's not touching +... 283708_289970
when you go like this it's touching the yellow square so it's not
so it's not symmetrical ? 296756_297885
well what if I do it like this so I just take that red triangle
but the green is touching the yellow . 303520_305918
so I guess mine's not symmetrical ? 305918_309148
here I know +... 309148_310790
mine is . 310790_311698
oh Jillian hand me yours . 311698_312983
Jillian's looking at hers and she's saying hers is +/. 312983_315470
oh but that's not the right way . 315470_316865
oh I'm sorry . 316865_317565
I'm sorry here . 317565_317815
I think mine is . 317815_319813
Jillian's looking at her core square and saying she thinks hers is
what do you think ? 322030_322781
um . 322781_323646
it's not . 323646_324586
it's not symmetrical . 324586_326615
mine's not symmetrical . 326615_327713
it's not . 327713_328496
it's not symmetrical . 328496_329863
okay who thinks they has &~wh who think they have one that is
you think you can find a way to fold it that will make the two
I don't have I don't have a symmetrical one . 341978_344116
Brittany did you say you think you do ? 344116_344916
I'm gonna try . 344916_346993
oh she's still trying . 346993_347228
you think yours you can find a way to fold it so that the
we must have somebody's ! 349878_351410
Dani bring yours up . 351410_353550
hold on Nicole . 353550_354483
hold on . 354483_355226
&~d Dani raised her hand first . 355226_357075
I wanna see them all though . 357075_358391
oops I'm dropping them . 358391_359960
like like that . 359960_362780
okay just a second I'm going to have you turn like this so they can
um take a break from your own attempts at folding and watch
she's gonna prove to you whether hers is symmetrical
<mine isn't > . 373678_374043
she thinks it is symmetrical . 374043_375148
the blue and the blue is &~t is touching and the uh and the um the
(o)kay &~th she's asking you to imagine folding it right along the
0 . 393355_395243
I'm just gonna crease it so that you can hold it and
um those two are touching those two are touching those two are
does she have a symmetrical core square ? 409020_410758
yes . 410758_411035
what if +/. 411035_412320
that's why mine isn't . 412320_412925
what if she had folded it a different way ? 412925_414503
what if she had folded it +... 414503_416083
it would still be symmetrical . 416083_417906
like this ? 417906_419116
it'd still be symmetrical . 419116_419436
it'd still be symmetrical . 419436_420740
so you can fold a symmetrical one anyway and it's still
yes ! 423091_423915
well &~n no . 423915_425305
not any . 425305_427915
this is Ashley's right ? 427915_429631
and we've proved that if we fold it like this hers matched exactly .
what if you took the top <from the bottom> . 433451_436180
<what if> . 436180_436715
what if I fold it like this ? 436715_437586
it's not symmetrical . 437586_440246
it's not . 440246_440810
xxx . 440810_441946
huh . 441946_442186
so what makes what is different about Dani's design then about
they're both symmetrical right ? 445496_448538
Dani has a symmetrical design . 448538_449930
<Teddy you need to give that to me> . 449930_452663
<but she doesn't have any squares> . 452663_453581
so you mean you think if you have a square in it um +//. 453581_457493
mine is +/. 457493_458451
no I want what you were throwing . 458451_459195
is that what you were throwing Teddy ? 459195_460278
bummer . 460278_461145
um if you have a square in it <you can only fold one way> ? 461145_465586
<is mine > +... 465586_466418
<mine has a square in it and it is not symmetrical> . 466418_468311
<is mine symmetrical> ? 468311_469363
is mine ? 469363_470176
and Kelly has &~sym +/. 470176_471008
but wait Ashley has a square in hers and hers is symmetrical . 471008_472915
you can have symmetrical designs with squares . 472915_474641
I know but I +/. 474641_475443
xxx symmetrical . 475443_476225
here . 476225_477058
what ? 477058_478408
Nathan ? 478408_478791
mine is . 478791_480091
bring it up . 480091_481175
oh wait Nicole's next sorry you have to be after Nicole . 481175_483140
Nicole come up and show us . 483140_484475
yes or no &~sym symmetrical or not . 484475_486640
yes . 486640_487223
okay . 487223_487948
Amanda sit flat and scoot back a little (be)cause Nicole needs to
ugh . 491356_493211
but uhoh I'm looking at Nicole's and I'm folding like this and I'm
that's because you folded it the wrong way . 497078_499955
that's be(cause) I'm folding it the wrong way she said . 499955_502343
huh . 502343_504188
ooh . 504188_508338
so a diagonal fold that makes them match exactly . 508338_512206
they're almost like a cat's face with ears or xxx xxx . 512206_514606
yeah . 514606_515538
mine's like a giraffes ! 515538_515780
okay and yours was not symmetrical and hers was . 515780_519818
is mine ? 519818_520811
mines mines <not symmetrical> . 520811_521723

mine's not &~sym +/. 525485_525706
if you can find a away to fold it <where both> halves will match
<mine's not> . 529278_530140
but mines not . 530140_531203
but it's Nathan's turn . 531203_532186
yeah Nathan's coming up . 532186_532386
do they match exactly underneath &~th +/. 532386_533813
this one touches &~th . 533813_535890
well are they &~t when I go under this one oh . 535890_536791
mine's not symmetrical . 536791_539175
it's not . 539175_539725
mine's not symmetrical . 539725_540308
okay but Amanda and Vanessa no one will be able to see Nathan's way
so mine isn't symmetrical ? 544906_547440
no but is that okay ? 547440_548945
yes . 548945_550140
mine's not symmetrical . 550140_552140
