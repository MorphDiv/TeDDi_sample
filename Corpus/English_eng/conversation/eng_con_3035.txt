that helps us figure out what symmetrical means . 0_1985
okay maybe if we see some things that are symmetrical um and some
+^ something we know better than we know that bedspread to help us .
what Nicole ? 16670_17565
symmetrical &~i +//. 17565_19788
oh never mind what I was going to say is that that um xxx . 19788_25165
so you're still thinking symmetrical is identical ? 25165_27391
well it's not no uh yeah and it and it would be it would be um like
oh okay . 36765_38295
um alright I want you to look at +//. 38295_40615
for one thing I'm not gonna show you two at a time . 40615_44118
I'm only going to show you one at a time and it can be symmetrical
so that will get us past part of our thinking . 49803_53278
this is Alex's core square . 53278_54783
okay . 54783_55816
and I'm checking to make sure that uh I wanted to show it to you in
this is Alex's core square that he used to help plan his quilt
Alex's core square is symmetrical . 68406_71785
okay think about that . 71785_75656
this one is symmetrical . 75656_77801
this is Paul's core square . 77801_83650
and this is the way he um he designed it . 83650_92013
Paul's core square is not symmetrical . 92013_97630
Paul's core square is not symmetrical . 97630_103385
okay now study that and think about what that could mean and I'm
this is Ashley's . 112410_113615
Ashley's core square is symmetrical . 113615_119648
okay ? 119648_124020
and then I'm gonna show you +//. 124020_126243
mine is still on my lap so I'll show you one more . 126243_128706
um my core square is not symmetrical . 128706_133856
my core square is not symmetrical . 133856_138245
so we had two &~yep that were and two that weren't . 138245_141940
look at them . 141940_142878
+^ I'll show them to you again . 142878_144606
these are the two core squares that are symmetrical that we looked
Alex's and Ashley's . 149490_152576
so study them and see what you can think about them . 152576_156478
Teddy can you put your core square down ? 156478_158960
we might be talking about it and thinking about it later . 158960_161145
could you lay it on the carpet ? 161145_162393
(be)cause I really need you to be paying attention to Ashley's and
now did Ashley and Alex make the same core squares ? 166623_168911
no . 168911_169578
are these core squares identical ? 169578_171450
no . 171450_172385
no . 172385_173446
but they both are symmetrical . 173446_175913
both of these core squares are symmetrical . 175913_179216
think about that . 179216_180311
+^ and then let me show you two that are not symmetrical . 180311_183095
now these two Paul's and mine are not symmetrical . 183095_191215
they are not . 191215_192660
are they core squares ? 192660_194995
yes . 194995_196111
are they made of the same kind of thing ? 196111_197706
yes . 197706_198495
yeah they're on paper . 198495_199438
they're both two sided . 199438_199771
are they the same size ? 199771_200806
yes . 200806_201420
yes . 201420_201938
but they're not symmetrical . 201938_203043
okay ? 203043_205270
why ? 205270_205918
um +... 205918_207251
did that change your thinking or give you any more ideas ? 207251_209171
no . 209171_210335
if these two are symmetrical what might symmetrical mean ? 210335_213531
what do you think Brittany ? 213531_216305
+^ take a guess . 216305_216883
something that has three colors ? 216883_218940
something that has three colors ? 218940_220713
<Missus Curtis's has three colors> . 220713_223308
well <mine has three colors and it's not symmetrical> . 223308_224841
but that was a good guess she's testing her ideas against the
she's going to try to figure out what that word symmetrical means
these two are symmetrical and Brittany noticed right way hey they
but then we kind of proved that one wrong (be)cause we looked at
who has a different idea on what is it that makes these two
Kelly what's your idea ? 248945_250345
it uses different colors . 250345_251660
does Paul use different colors ? 251660_253960
yes . 253960_254991
It's not symmetrical . 254991_256225
did I use different colors ? 256225_257890
yes . 257890_258660
I didn't make a symmetrical core square . 258660_261071
hmm +... 261071_262473
so it's not that you just have to use different colors for it to be
it's not that you have to use three colors to be symmetrical . 266811_270053
hmm Brian what's your idea ? 270053_272806
I think that those are not symmetrical . 272806_276093
wait these are though . 276093_277186
these are . 277186_278340
these are symmetrical . 278340_280976
so try to look at that and think about that that these really are
and see if you can figure out what it means to be symmetrical then .
that they have two colors ? 290851_292476
does this have two colors ? 292476_294168
two of the same colors or three . 294168_297168
wait say could you say that last part a little louder I
that they have two or three of the same colors ? 301116_304338
two or three of the same colors . 304338_307701
so there's never a place that has just one piece that has just one
that one doesn't have blue and that one does . 312040_314648
no I I think what he's saying is um you mean because in mine I
maybe that's why mine's not symmetrical ? 320053_322123
no . 322123_323073
<look at Paul's> . 323073_324121
but look at Pauls . 324121_325006
he has two oranges and more than two blues but his is not +//. 325006_328791
oops I was holding it the wrong way . 328791_330328
his is not symmetrical . 330328_332505
hmm these are symmetrical . 332505_337105
what is it that makes them symmetrical ? 337105_340911
what's different about these ? 340911_342856
got a guess Amanda ? 342856_344643
I'd love to hear it . 344643_347076
Ashley you were just stretching ? 347076_348053
hmm maybe if we look at one that is symmetrical and one that's not .
pick one that has totally different colors . 352171_354153
&~th okay Paul's is not Alex's is . 354153_358885
you're holding Paul's wrong . 358885_359970
you're holding it the wrong way . 359970_360851
I'm sorry &~th I thought that was an x@l it's not . 360851_364020
it was a pencil mark . 364020_364951
it's not the x@l . 364951_365646
okay this is Paul's and this is Alex's . 365646_368156
Alex's is symmetrical . 368156_369940
Paul's is not . 369940_372250
take a guess Jillian . 372250_377785
because um the two that they used that were symmetrical they used
um . 386375_387565
nope Ashley didn't use all triangles . 387565_390598
nope Ashley had a square . 390598_392188
good thinking good noticing Kelly . 392188_393765
Ashley's does have a square and hers is symmetrical too . 393765_396483
Kelly +/. 396483_397480
but good we're trying different ideas . 397480_399528
okay so Ashley's has the red square . 399528_402378
so does something have to be made of just triangles for it to be
no . 405863_406483
nope it can have triangles and squares and still be symmetrical . 406483_410211
good thinking Jillian you're asking yourself good questions . 410211_413010
this one is not symmetrical . 413010_415525
this one is symmetrical . 415525_418208
okay . 418208_420606
hmm Teddy are you thinking about these ? 420606_424956
what could I do to this one that I couldn't do to this one . 424956_429108
think about it that way for awhile . 429108_434285
(be)cause to find out if your core squares were symmetrical do you
nope nope . 439536_440606
I had to look at them . 440606_441516
I had to ask myself questions and from looking at them I figured
and the question I'm asking you maybe if you think about it this
Kevin take a guess . 452816_453835
you couldn't um like make Paul's like Alex's like change colors
they're both xxx . 462815_463781
right this one is a core square that is not symmetrical and this
um if I could change colors and shapes I could turn any core square
so hmm . 475538_478905
I looked at Paul's core square and I asked myself a question I
I looked at Alex's and I asked myself a question I asked myself if
hmm . 498816_502246
Nathan I need you to sit up and Teddy you too . 502246_504951
what do you think Justin take a guess . 504951_510663
you could um flip it and stuff but it &~wil won't look exactly
okay . 512878_513794
so Justin's putting into use his knowledge of flips and turns . 513794_518446
he's saying maybe there's a certain way you flip and turn them that
um +/. 526753_527615
you're holding Paul's the wrong way again . 527615_528615
again . 528615_529663
sorry about that . 529663_531276
there's one mark in one corner of his that always I think is the
I'll just have to remember that his blues are always on the
left . 541041_542006
his blues are always on the left . 542006_542413
okay um so test your idea out Justin what kind of flip or turn
hmm put it over xxx . 549873_557525
well I don't think his idea isn't that I can make Paul's look lik
