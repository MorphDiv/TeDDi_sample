straight down . 0_943
I ended up with some some extra down there . 943_6176
if you go straight down it would go out like that . 6176_8199
you would get a shape that looks like that . 8199_9878
so looking at this shape then can you make a prediction do you
Craig is asking you to think about a square . 16287_20646
this is actually a square right ? 20646_22366
xxx . 22366_24125
if you had a square that big one inch on each side . 24125_26940
so think about that and then Craig can you tell us how thinking
there'd be there'd be rows going down like that . 32635_35829
okay . 35829_36420
so then you'd have ten rows going down like that . 36420_39624
how did you know there was going to be ten I didn't even start
because this is ten inches and they're all inches, so +... 42260_46492
so if this is ten inches, what Craig is saying is that every inch
and he could tell just by looking at the label we put on that there
I need ten of them . 60804_62498
did I get it divided into ten pretty equal parts ? 62498_64983
five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty five, thirty, thirty five,
huh, I only see ten not forty . 68148_71371
but then, now we have to do, um, inches like this way . 71371_75905
oh, okay . 75905_76981
to make them one inch squares . 76981_79148
okay . 79148_79866
alright . 79866_80770
and how many rows will there be there ? 80770_83027
can I just make any number as long as I use my ruler . 83027_85051
no . 85051_85435
you just +... 85435_85978
just four . 85978_87202
Craig says that when I'm done drawing these lines he's gonna have
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
there's ten on each of these and there's four rows, so I know that
how did you know one of those rows might have more than ten or less
if you already had those lines going down, and there was, um, ten
okay . 156841_157642
I see forty squares in there how does it help me think about those
how does it help me think about xxx to prove they're the same . 163706_167162
if they're the same I should be able to fit how many squares in
forty . 170566_170974
forty . 170974_171958
any size squares ? 171958_172869
no . 174257_175136
one inch squares . 175136_176712
Christopher do you want to come up and talk about this one for a
do you mind letting him talk about his ? 179516_180979
I think he's got a way that maybe he can +... 180979_182707
you two talk together xxx . 182707_185938
yeah can you show oh what do I see Tim doing . 185938_188554
or what do you see Tim doing ? 188554_189632
counting with my fingers . 189632_191554
counting with his fingers . 191554_192483
where you counting forty fingers Tim ? 192483_195506
no . 195506_195874
what were you doing ? 195874_196968
I was using five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty five, thirty,
xxx fifteen, twenty, twenty five, thirty, thirty five, forty, forty
you got eight . 210647_211489
eight . 211489_211945
so +... 211945_212680
xxx . 212680_214385
so are eight rows of five forty ? 214385_216719
(be)cause look there are eight rows with five in each row . 216719_219357
five, ten, fifteen, twenty +... 219357_221061
so they are both rectangles but they have different measurements ? 221061_237085
yeah . 237085_237444
okay . 237444_238460
so they are different rectangles ? 238460_240213
yeah, but you they still could be, um +... 240213_243632
they are different rectangles but they can still cover the same
yes . 247742_248230
