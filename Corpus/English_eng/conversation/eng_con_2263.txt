Yeah, but I thought we set this up the first time when +... 0_1858
Oh well, whatever . 1858_3427
setenv . 2727_3770
set environment Cvsroot to tilde Sunya private cvs . 3770_7309

Okay, and then set then +/.
Definitely set Pg_Data and set +/.
You have Pg_Data +/.
you should have Pg_Data set right ?15954_21650
pgdata . 21650_23526
sigh .22856_23713
To which one ?
to where ever I want it .23713_25552
yeah .25552_26072
and then .26052_26472
and then set environment path .26572_27859
this I definitely know .27859_29225
the path ?29225_29525
yeah .29525_30168

um, x@l, no I didn't touch anything .33119_36472
well the only thing that looks different is the source stuff .36472_39770
Uh, okay .

yeah .55443_55604
I +...55604_55844
But I think I'm making up for sleep that I've lost over for the
yeah definitely .59000_59646
which kinda still makes me really angry cause there was no point in
I know !62120_62841
That whole database thing, augh, I don't even want to talk about
I like, I called my mom and I was like, I think I just flunked
She was probably like yeah, whatever Belinda, Its the same thing
wait, why does it say that ?
c@l v@l s@l .70118_74707
Uh, did you +/.
exit out and relog in .74707_76582
mm hmm, good point . 76582_78291
um .78291_79458
yeah and then I was like .79458_81027
I called my daddy .81027_81837
Are you serious ?
I +... 81837_82682
He's always the person I call when it comes to . 81837_84130
laugh .84130_84432
cs or exams or whatever .84432_86564
Yeah, I was, I dunno .
that wasn't a very fair exam by any means and +... 86564_92685
The first part was fair I thought .92685_94100
yeah .94100_94469
I was like, oh chugging along fine .94469_95786
I mean, the first part could have been harder if he really wanted
But like the second part was just ridiculous .95786_102268
and I didn't know, okay, it was hard for me to guesstimate it I was
xxx .107022_107890
Yeah, cos like it didnt, ooh I dunno .107050_109558
because that's why I didn't say anything right after the exam when
I figured maybe like my part that was like spending too much .108558_117230
no .116230_116723
time on the first three questions .117230_119050
no .118050_118805
and I was trying to hurry myself up through the xxx class xxx .118805_123117
Like the minute I put down my pen I was like I flunked .120817_123841
laugh . 123841_125973
I flunked, that's it .125973_126623
No I I just When he like called like twenty something
Did he call twenty something minutes ?129746_131306
He did call +... 131306_132400
He didn't call five minutes at all .
I was just like, all of a sudden he's like okay time's up and I was
he didnt call anything but on the board .136564_137680
He just wrote stuff on the board, yeah .137680_138524
I think when I finally looked up when he did the twenty something
oh .145093_145528
and this is only problem number three, was it ?145528_147520
yeah, I got through that part pretty fast .147220_149682
cos I hurried through .149882_150710
Like I got through that I got through most of that by forty .149950_152842
until there were like thirty five minutes left and I was working on
oh okay .154990_155536
So you would have had any more +/.
It wouldn't have mattered .155536_157768
Heh because an extra ten minutes on the last two questions didn't
yeah .162796_163211
When he said that you know, I was like oh shoot what else do I have
mm hmm .173382_173668
one was like okay, a total of like six points . 173668_176383
and then the other one was twelve points each .176383_177289
twelve points .177289_178464
yeah .178464_178886
okay, I guess that's .178886_179988
i was like that's gone . 179988_180689
that's thirty points right there .180689_182379
and it wasn't out of a hundred either, it was out of eighty or
Are you serious ?185296_186199
I I don't remember if it was out of a hundred .186199_189333
I dunno .
I don't remember .189333_190661
I didn't really look though .190661_192430
yeah I didn't either .192430_194281
oh gosh .194281_195246
that's okay .195246_196200
Okay, I gotta .196200_196964
A little bit of swipe swipe action and I'll be good today .196964_198633
swipe swipe action .198633_200009
That's so bad .
I'm going to have to swipe my lunch I have no cash .200009_203326
laugh .203326_203708
okay, I'm good I checked it out .203326_205619
okay .205444_205900
configure .205900_210165
dash dash, prefix pound home dollar sign home .210165_214050
like really type that ?214050_215435
yeah .215435_216098
I guess it is .215498_216840
yup .216300_216600
because you ha(ve) you should have a home defined .217463_219393
yup .219393_220483
yeah .220483_223339
Configure not found .
Okay I don't have configure .223339_225330
Are you in the p the project three slash source durectory ?225330_230301
No .230301_231265
You have to switch to project three acutally .
you have to be in the right directory or you can't do the dot slash
Yeah change into project three there, yes . 234942_237176
Yeah see ?237076_238061
Whatever .238061_238986
Sunya was really good about directions actually .238986_241017
He is .241017_241782
Except for the one part where you get to gmake you have to do gmake
ok .245952_246858
I discovered that beacause it wouldn't work otherwise .246858_248023
Oh I have two errors, is that fine ?248023_249067
That's fine, whatever .249067_250274
It always gives you errors dude .250274_251985
run gmake install .251985_256555
hmmm .256555_262201
wow its .262201_262930
Its lovely how you see ooh, missing prototypes, missing prototypes
Heh, I don't even look at that .266389_268139
Missing declarations great . 268139_269607
Do you have enough quota ?269607_270813
I don't know, we'll find out .270813_272362
Heh, did you remove homework three ?
oh wait, you didn't set up homework three .272362_275804
eighty five .275804_277634
I have seventy seven .277634_282179
i have a lower grade .282179_284693
Aren't we excited ?284693_287957
you what ?287957_288962
Sorry, just babbling .288962_291517
Repository, huh ?291517_296974
yeah .296974_298361
So turning on and off the thing doesn't really work ?
is that what it was ?298361_304263
Turning on and off works for no it works, it just doesn't
It um, what we think, what i think, is going on is somehow you know
You're supposed to get um it's supposed to call our unique hash and
mm hmm .321929_323075
It apparently seems like our distinct x@l one is working, just our
Which is really weird because I would have thought it would have
I don't know if its an error cause Sunya was like it might be an
probably not now because probably .338846_341014
Okay, so I guess, in a sense, we could go back and try to fix it
Right .346594_347419
I thnk right now we're wasting time so right now we need to go .347419_349324
better off .349324_349888
talking about in memory .349888_351263
Right so I said I will go back and look at it later like over break
one is the inmemory hashing . 356957_358319
inmemory hashing and hybrid hashing .358319_359163
and we should poke some files as to see maybe where where we can
right .365018_365230
where we would implement it and where would we just yeah .365230_366893
right .366893_366972
Sigh, we don't have the time to deal with this .
this is retarded .
I told David I was like you know its really unfair for you guys to
technically you guys had that week that first week because that
two .384930_385996
He was like yeah homework two wasn't hard bla bla bla bla bla and i
Yeah but you know what ?388768_390236
I was just so pissed .
I was like shut up .390236_392106
Everyone had two weeks of midterms .392106_394721
yeah .394721_395364
It was spaced over two weeks .395364_396671
and like maybe I didn't have a midterm, but I had papers to write
something .400894_401982
because remember that week when I came into Wean and we did the
I was still pretty dead because I didnt sleep and that hurt me .
I pulled about four near all nighters . 401982_410549
right . 410549_410993
It's not a big deal beacuse whatever .410993_412898
yeah . 412898_413060
but still .413060_413321
but he was just like you guys were supposed to work on it the first
I was like if i didn't have an exam in a week or in a day I would
Is Kelly gone ?423164_425638
Yeah, she left already for break .425638_426603
She left yesterday .426603_427789
I dunno .
I came back after that test and she was gone already so +...427789_431007
Nice .431007_431832
Yeah .431832_432857
Heheh, I want a real break .432857_436115
sigh senior year .436115_438187
laugh .438187_439856
Yeah the things is when I was talking because Sunya come over .
uh huh .443515_443776
to eat ice cream, remember ?
and I kinda like .443776_444983
right right .444983_445794
and Ben was there and we talked . 445794_448710
Right after class and what happened was I told Sunya I want to help
right .456247_456529
I felt bad about going to the interview stuff its like ill timed
right .460449_460852
I think interview stuff shuld supercede school right .460852_463889
and instructors should kind of accomodate for that .463889_467870
Crystal said she got extensions on her projects with her team
you know for a couple of days .473199_475964
you really think Olstons going to give us an extension .475964_477311
no .477311_477612
0 . 477311_477643
Exactly, he'd be like you had four weeks to do it .477643_480931
but yeah it ended up being like a conversation Sunya was like I
he was like Ben do you have a computer and he was like yeah .
what kind of connection ?
fifty six k . 480931_488612
and then Sunya was like maybe you can just work on in memory
and assume that's just your chunk and if you can get that done or
the hybrid hashing .500212_501990
hybrid .501990_502171
yeah the whatever whatever .502171_510803
right .510803_512411
that didn't help, but I was kinda like then later in retrospect
You know how Ben is .
he doesn't say anything .518784_520755
yeah .520755_520955
so like . 520955_521290
He's always like disappointed but like . 521290_524317
He wouldn't even say that if it didn't bother him .524317_526289
right right .526289_526469
It must have bothered, irked him enough to say something to the
he wasn't like oh you have work .526469_533744
right .533744_534287
It was just like I didn't realize you had this much work right ?534287_536941
so that's like very passive agressive . 536941_540071
yeah . 540071_541273
and i was like hmm .
the other thing is yeah i did spend two hundred dollars like I was
to go down to Austin, right ?548466_549392
Yeah I didn't mind whatever .
you know I don't shirk off work .
I work hard and stuff like that you know i think that people should
Just ended up being a bad situation .557161_559220
yeah .559220_559441
and then taking to my mom later that evening cause my dad . 559441_563362
was like you have to make sure whatever you get done, you get done,
I was like dad I should just drop the class .
okay fine if it doesn't kill your gpa .
I was like . 563362_570194
but then I'll screw my members over .
he was like ooh, whatever, don't talk to me about this .
you decide, you know ?570194_575518
heh .575518_576185
but then I talked to my mom since I haven't seen her in a while . 575518_578068
right .578068_578329
She lives out in Cali .578329_579716
She was the one who reminded me of the whole, you're going over as
right .583694_583976
by his parents .
I'm not sure how this is but I remember when me and my Ben we had
wanted to like take him out .591377_592824
right . 592824_593160
take him around and all this stuff and take him to places and
The expectation is that spring break you have no work so of course
yeah .600943_601505
and . 601505_601794
but it's just the expectation that i'm going to be there as a guest
right .603745_604366
because you like come home and my parents are pretty like you're
right .610454_610736
but they're more understanding about it .610736_612324
right .612323_612485
but if came over and accepted an invitation as a guest .612485_614677
my mom reminded me that being a guest and she said maybe its like
but she thought that .618900_620080
it probably is .620080_621147
but I . 621147_622252
but no it makes sense .622252_623378
but Zack because I was talking to him about like how would you feel
right .628085_628589
and they did work .628589_629799
not in like constantly work but like . 629799_630809
right but you wouldn't feel .630809_632221
I would borrow your computer and work and work a good chunk you
right .634654_634938
yeah he was like I think that would be really rude .634938_636969
obviously it just especially if they're planning thiings for you
yeah .640472_641499
beacuse they've been like kinda like oh do you want to go to the
uh huh .644962_645449
How about this cooking class ?645449_648105
it's all Thai and vegetarian stuff .648105_649862
They're really going out of their way to accomodate for me .649862_651638
right . 651638_651839
Not accomodate accomodate, but look for things I might be
yeah .654191_654639
because Ben told them she doesn't eat meat but she eats fish or
mm hmm .658416_658898
and his father makes like really awesome food . 658898_660909
oh that's cool .660909_662533
so he's been planning dad you have to make your didiidi fish and
aww, that's awesome .666976_667965
so its going to be really fun but then +...667965_668835
aww, that's swwet .668835_669326
yeah and then I told my mom about these conversations . 669326_672329
had with Ben and whatever .672329_673117
yeah .673117_673661
and she reminded me of that .673661_675169
right .675169_675510
its just like shoot .675510_676904
yeah, and I wish I didn't say so quickly and make Sunya like kinda
like rely on you .681952_682947
Sunya will always say the right things like of course i don't want
right .685889_686201
when he's on a road trip he can't work .686201_687215
right . 687215_687827
so its not fair to expect everyone to work . 687827_690180
right .690180_690471
when he's not that kinda thing whatever .690471_691592
but yeah I didn't want to seem like I didn't want to put in my
well I think Sunya knew that you're not like . 695462_698248
Right, but I just like that conversation was like wait, i kinda
mmm hmm .703649_705056
Like that .
the conversation after class was more like to clarify that its
Right, obviously .710326_710840
and work really hard when I come back .710840_712408
You and I had no expectation since we didn't have that conversation
yeah that's true .715698_716713
but the West Wing conversation was something like that .716713_719007
right .719007_719362
to the discussion yesterday .719362_720731
So, as long as we're all on the same page and we know we're going
Oh i know, gosh .727747_728725
Eh, whatever .728725_729931
