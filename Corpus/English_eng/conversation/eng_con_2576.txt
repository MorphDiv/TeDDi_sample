Hall's talk today I put a sign up on the old room and so some of you I hope got to hear it or at least part of it it was still going along when I left so I hadta sort_of sneak out . 2865_12325
alright .
we'll come back . 13625_15085
we may talk about the &~acta African Burial Grounds in New York later on in the course . 15185_19665
there are all sorts of really interesting things associated with the social and political things associated with it . 19845_27525
also the +//. 27935_28935
Professor Hall didn't get a chance to talk about but we will be discussing things later on . 29675_41635
I wanna start off today just to say a_couple_of words simply because some of you have talked to me about stuff that you're feeling confused with and things that you feel a little uncomfortable about <I wanna talk> for a minute about historicism and for those of you who are anthropologists or cultural anthropologists for sure it won't be difficult for you to relate to this . 35305_60065
because the concept of cultural relativism is an extremely important thing in anthropology . 60415_65455
this is the idea that when you study another culture or when you are exposed to another culture or simply to understand another culture you need to understand it from the perspective of that culture itself . 66255_78035
you can't understand how somebody thinks in &~ano in another society in another culture without understanding the context of that thought . 79135_86015
the same thing applies to history . 86655_88135
the same thing applies to the history of racism and it applies to the history of science . 89005_93845
so when we look at people in the past now a large part of this class is looking at the history of science and the history of racism . 94425_99905
you have to remember to try to put yourself into the context in which these people were living and thinking . 100965_107245
they come from a different place and a different time . 108085_110665
so sometimes virtually everybody that we'll be looking at historically by the standards of today would be considered a racist . 111345_117845
but in the context of their time some were and some were not . 118465_121925
and these are things that we need to consider . 122365_124005
another thing you hafta think about also and I think that for some of you guys you might not be thinking about this because you don't think historically . 124945_132125
&-um in terms of biology one of the &~th you hafta think of the relationship +//. 132665_138045
think about the way that people were thinking in biology a hundred years ago . 138355_142335
a_lot_of the things that we take for granted in terms of our understandings of genetics our understandings of the relationships between genetics and evolution are incredibly recent discoveries . 142955_153615
very very very recent . 154655_156095
realize that Gregor Mendel who we talked about was writing in the later nineteenth century . 156655_164155
he was &~ar his work was around at the same time as Charles Darwin . 165155_168215
Charles Darwin never knew it . 169075_170475
you know why ? 171195_171735
because Gregor Mendel was Czech . 172455_175715
and he was writing in German . 176415_177735
and there was an enormous amount of of &-um almost not really nationalism but a certain amount of ethnocentrism in science which exists today . 178315_187355
There &~th the work in some countries is not paid as much attention to as the work in other countries . 187795_192315
and Darwin and other English workers were not really paying much attention to what was going on in the German world . 192425_197465
and in the German literature . 198605_199565
so this is something to think about also nobody was reading Mendel . 200445_204005
very few people paid any attention to him at all and it wasn't really until this century or not this century the one we just left the nineteenth the the twentieth century that people started to pay attention to genetics at all . 205045_217205
and it really Mendelian genetics really took off in the nineteen twenties . 217465_220885
but what did people know about genes then ? 221625_223405
genes were theories . 223765_225305
no one saw a gene . 226085_227045
no one knew what a gene looked like nobody knew what DNA was . 228265_231785
<when did> when did Watson and Crick live ? 232805_235365
anybody know ? 236205_237205
fifties .
in the fifties . 238145_239905
when was it really established and when was it really permeating the academic communities ? 240385_244985
in the sixties . 245555_246435
when did people &~act when were people actually able to sequence DNA ? 246855_250555
the last fifteen years . 252215_255155
fifteen twenty years we're looking at really recent stuff . 255155_257755
and for a large portion of the history of biology a_lot_of things were based on inference which is fine because that's really how most science is done . 258655_267395
many of the things that we consider to be scientific facts are actually theories and we will talk about that in the beginning of next week . 267645_274985
but in terms of genetic observations these are incredibly recent things . 276325_280065
and &~th &~y you need to keep these things in mind when we talk about the history of the field and when we talk about things that seem so crazy and strange . 280185_287585
when we talk about them in the past we need to keep in mind that these are based on the knowledge that was available at the time and they actually made a_lot_of sense . 287805_295945
they weren't silly things necessarily . 296305_298485
but they weren't particularly silly things there are things we need to keep in mind in terms of the history of &~anthr of of biology . 299125_306785
so for much of the history of biology genes were not observed . 307965_311765
that's a very very recent thing . 313725_314885
and that's added to our knowledge enormously . 315805_317865
so what are the big questions ? 318645_320225
the big questions that people had from the very beginning of biology are still being asked today . 320925_328385
and I sort_of jotted down what are some of these big questions ? 329545_332085
what are how does the body know how to develop ? 332645_335905
how does the body +//. 336745_339005
how come all humans develop the same way ? 339425_341025
how does the body know how to develop ? 341185_342745
those were big questions then . 344015_345695
how are traits transmitted ? 346475_347935
and we we know an awful lot about transmission genetics . 349035_352115
how does the body know how to develop that first question ? 352495_354375
that is ontogeny the idea that we were talking about last time . 354655_358755
ontogeny is the development of the individual . 359535_361715
and the study of that development is called ontogeny . 362215_365095
actually let me just put up where we were last time +... 365675_367595
&=putting_overhead_slides_up this is where we were <is two> . 371045_372905
(0.6) what I want to do is put heterochrony and some of the stuff that fairly complicated things for those of you who haven't thought about this work in a historical context and to explain why it's relevant . 378305_388465
and why it's relevant today and why it was relevant in the past . 389865_393405
well that's not gonna work . 394045_395085
&=moves_overhead sorry that's just what happens when you don't look . 395725_397765
okay . 399455_399695
xxx just leave it there <for me> +/.
+, &=laughs back or forward forward how's that ? 399935_405835
+, better +/.
+, okay and this is what you already have in your notes from last time . 406635_412395
and I thought I would write down the biogenetic law that we discussed ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny . 413075_419755
so what are these big questions that how does the body know how to do things ? 421115_425795
how are traits transmitted ? 425975_427175
how are those two things related ? 429045_430765
people wanted to know how these two things could be related . 431445_434745
and finally when evolution became accepted how do those things relate to phylogeny ? 435525_442485
how do those things relate to the evolution of the species ? 442685_445265
how does development relate to the evolution of the species ? 445685_448145
and all of those questions are still relevant today . 448385_451065
all of those questions are big issues in evolutionary biology . 451765_454445
how does the development of the individual relate to the development of the species ? 454885_458445
and these are things that are still considered . 458925_460605
therefore this was the kind of context that Haeckel was writing in in the late nineteenth century he had those questions in mind and he was thinking about those questions . 461625_470765
and he was thinking about these questions in the context of another idea that was pretty well accepted and this was the idea of preformation . 471145_479225
the idea that &~i to address the first of those questions that I've laid out for you how does the body know how to develop ? 480635_486395
there was an idea there was a a scientific premise of preformation that there was something inside the body perhaps inside cells somewhere &~ins probably inside cells that's how usually people were thinking about it that provided instructions for how the body was to develop . 486835_503835
now we can say yeah it's DNA . 504795_506635
but they of_course didn't know that at all . 507435_509415
but there was this idea that there was &~ins there was some kind of instructions some people postulated even earlier than Haeckel much earlier than Haeckel that there was actually a little an a little &-um like a little miniature embryo type of thing called homunculus . 509875_525475
that was going to form and that the body took its instructions from this forming thing that was inside you that there was this idea that there was some kind of program that was there and what Haeckel did there was a plan and what Haeckel did was he took this already accepted knowledge and applied an evolutionary idea to it . 526205_543625
his evolutionary idea was that &~ev evolution occurred that the process of evolution was adding stages to the plan . 544305_551545
okay ?
and that is this recapitulation idea that we were talking about . 554175_558675
that in every ontogeny okay in every development of an individual there's this plan at several stages . 559255_565715
and that evolution works by adding to the ontogenetic plan . 566475_570995
adding stages onto the end . 571295_573015
and as stages get added onto the end because you're gonna run out_of room right ? 573775_578415
the earlier stages get truncated and pushed together but the stages are still there therefore if you look at &~th an embryo or if you looked at the development of an individual you should theoretically see all the stages that came before . 579145_593045
and this basically gave you a history of the evolution of that organism . 593965_598205
and this was what Haeckel was thinking . 598585_600025
and this is the source of this idea ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny . 600805_609125
that is ontogeny the development of an individual recapitulates shows again reshows &~re replays phylogeny the development of the species . 604955_614795
and this was the &~s the core idea behind Haeckel's Biogenetic Law . 615635_619555
now we know and of_course he said it as a law because then what biologists really wanted to do because they wanted biology to be like other sciences they wanted laws in biology . 620055_632555
they wanted laws that like like the laws in physics . 633505_637545
and so Haeckel composed this as a biological law . 638285_641745
immediately as in all science there are some new people saying hey wait I know something to that that can't be a law there's all sorts of problems with that . 642805_650665
and this is where the &~con I +//. 651185_652365
concept of neotony that we discussed last time . 652965_655385
there were some people who said wait a second evolution doesn't work that way it works the opposite way . 655685_660625
it works by taking stages off development . 660595_664175
it shortens development it takes stages off of development . 664695_667595
and that was another evolutionary theory that also played around with developmental timing . 668535_674015
that was the opposite in the sense of recapitulation but then both of those ideas were out and a_lot_of more intelligent people well not that Haeckel wasn't intelligent he was really smart but &-um and also quite influential in very bad ways but which we'll come to later on &-um a_lot_of people thought that both worked . 675005_694825
that both happened . 695285_695985
and in effect that's true . 696545_697565
people study heterochrony today and think about these things in a much more sophisticated way now but basically both of those notions are &~th are are accepted that evolution &~n can act to extend development to shorten development to change rates of development and in effect that is the way major change can occur . 698035_718115
this is socially relevant . 719335_721115
okay ? 722295_722515
because almost all forms of explanations for variation and for evolution have been used in social spheres to explain differences between human groups . 722595_735655
these theories have and are used to explain differences between human groups and they certainly have been used extensively in the past to explain supposed inferiority or superiority of different racial groups and we need to talk about what these things are what the theories are for when you talk about the ways that they've been exploited . 736245_754325
make sense ? 754805_756025
okay . 756865_757185
so that is why I am delving into something &~rel relatively esoteric . 758565_762885
&-uh in some detail because they're things that we should be coming back to at some point . 764305_770085
modern heterochrony is studied on a number of levels . 770785_775785
you can look at heterochrony and changes in development it's studied on a number of levels you can study it on the molecular level you can study it on the level of the fossils themselves . 776405_786505
you can study it on all sorts of levels in between and people do . 787125_790445
people who are interested in evolutionary biology some of them really focus on heterochrony as a process . 790505_795945
it's a way to look it's a level of looking at evolutionary processes . 796805_800425
and it's a way to look at how evolution works and as we've talked about it here it's a way of understanding how big changes can happen . 801165_809265
through the evolutionary forces that we've talked about . 810445_812465
we pose the question if there's such a small amount of genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees how come we look so different ? 812835_820015
and heterochrony is one of the explanations for that . 821715_824975
you could have very small genetic changes but then you could be acted on +//. 825295_828255
that change developmental timing the single gene . 828475_830775
small mutations in small populations that that are acted on by selection can very very quickly or could potentially change transcend what we're thinking about in terms of type . 831645_846785
and I'm gonna come +//. 849545_850025
&~b and we talked again and I will talk again about species as types that can cause major change that then transcend this +//. 850265_858905
transcends people's ideas of one type to another . 859745_862245
okay . 863305_865545
let me move on and I'm not going move off of heterochrony xxx so just to go over what heterochrony is then how we can think about it and you don't hafta memorize this stuff you'll have the these charts and things on the web I'm offering this to you because it's a way of sort_of visualizing how it works . 866785_890625
and so you can sort_of understand the process because otherwise it's just a bunch of words right ? 891385_894945
so if you want to think about heterochrony right this is where we started last time you can think of it in terms of two things you can change developmental timing the extent the duration of the developmental period or you can change the rate of development . 896105_912085
okay ? 912565_913185
I've got a nice diagram here there're two in the diagram I wish I had two of these things I should next time oh well +... 915685_923425
okay I'll just put it here so you can think about this for a second in the diagram that I'm showing you there's there +//. 926485_933185
it's a growth trajectory which you saw last time . 933365_936285
there's a growth trajectory that looks like this right ? 936725_940945
a growth trajectory . 941705_943045
and this is how those +//. 945195_947035
a growth during what an ontogeny of how these a particular species developed in the past and that's an ancestor . 947555_955035
say hypothetically that ancestor had two descendents . 955795_959095
and one of those descendents had a longer growth rate and one had a shorter growth rate okay here's the one with the longer growth rate that's descendent A and this is the one with the shorter growth rate with descendent B . 960555_974715
and then you can see that descendent A will go through the ancestral stages the adult ancestral stages . 975855_981475
so that if you looked in the ontogeny of descendent A before that descendent A grew up you would see phases of the ancestor . 982555_991935
okay ?
the converse is when the growth period gets truncated and descendent B stops there right ? 994675_1004855
that would mean that it would retain the adult descendent B would retain it would look like a baby ancestor of the ancestor . 1005155_1015095
make sense ? 1016535_1016935
(0.6) here's the &~con &-uh the +//. 1018475_1023695
what would happen if you changed rate . 1023895_1026015
okay ? 1026855_1027075
if you changed the rate of growth . 1028535_1030695
(0.9) okay now again I can see the diagram okay ? 1039595_1042855
how's that ? 1043255_1043675
here we have to sort_of &~ba the growth period stays the same for the ancestor and descendent A and descendent B . 1044395_1052495
with descendent A they're growing faster . 1052955_1056635
over time . 1057655_1058315
okay ? 1059075_1059195
and with descendent B the growth rate is slowed down so they're growing slower in the same period of time . 1059595_1066015
the growth rate has slowed down . 1066295_1067575
in the first case descendent A is going through adult ancestral stages during development . 1069505_1075125
here is descendent A . 1075765_1077025
okay ?
and here's the ancestor and I'm making a little dot where where each of these guys are relative to the ontogeny the &~onto &~ontol ontological projections . 1077525_1088065
how's that ? 1088605_1089125
of the different species . 1089565_1091565
so here you have descendent A and the ancestor the form of the adult ancestor would be part way through the ontogeny of descendent A . 1093715_1103975
okay make sense +..? 1105035_1105995
so this would be again an example of peramorphosis . 1106535_1112015
what you would find is the ancestor just like Haeckel would have suggested in the ontogeny of the descendent . 1112515_1119095
in the case of descendent B it would be the neotony example provided by Axelrod that we talked about last time the salamanders right ? 1122175_1132255
descendent B here is going to be retaining the juvenile features of the ancestor . 1132595_1138475
here's the adult form of descendent B okay ? 1139515_1145375
and if you think about what that adult form is going to look like there it is it's right there in the middle of the ontogeny of the ancestor . 1146515_1152535
and so those are the two ways that you can fiddle around with the developmental time to get differential results . 1153375_1159615
we were just playing around with this just to see how it this stuff works . 1160395_1162955
developmental timing can be affected by relatively small genetic changes +... 1163955_1170155
however if you change +//. 1173615_1175195
we've also been talking about sort of +//. 1175535_1176815
this can affect the entire organism in terms of the development of the system as a whole the development of separate systems . 1177155_1183635
within the organism . 1184755_1185495
it also can explain why a_lot_of interrelated things can change at once . 1186875_1192295
for instance things that &~ch that that cause bone development . 1192735_1195515
and things like that which can get inherited as a single thing . 1196655_1199075
so all of these things so many things can be affected by a single mutation if it fits if it hits the right if it hits the right spot . 1199715_1208515
okay .
relevance to human evolution . 1209975_1213395
(0.6) and this is stuff that we won't get to so much right now but we'll come to later just so you have it in your mind (0.5) relevance to oops sorry about that relevance to human humans have some peramorphic features the ones classically the ones that Haeckel was really focused on humans have some peramorphic features . 1218935_1247675
ancestral adult features found in the ontogeny of the descendent usually due to increased growth periods but sometimes increased rate (0.4) and second humans have some pedomorphic features . 1248765_1263925
ancestral juvenile features found in adult descendents usually due to an increase a decrease I'm sorry <in growth> in growth rate . 1265005_1274445
people like Stephen J Gould who wrote a really +//. 1276435_1279155
for those of you who are interested in the history of heterochrony Stephen J Gould who's a great popular science writer +... 1279455_1284995
even if controversial on many issues +... 1287075_1288695
wrote a great book <I think> his very best book is called Ontogeny and Phylogeny which discusses the history of some of these ideas . 1290875_1298735
and he characterizes humans as neotenous . 1300555_1302515
because one of the things that does characterize humans is our decreased growth rate it takes us a long time to reach maturity . 1304075_1311915
we reach sexual maturity late . 1313335_1314935
we have very long we have a long and slow growth process . 1315695_1321135
and so some of those features he argues some of the human features are neotenous (0.5) but we will come back to this again another time . 1321855_1334195
let me give you a second for this . 1335575_1336755
(0.22) to reiterate modern heterochrony is a way of studying the evolutionary process on a number of different levels and it's a way of understanding the relationship between small changes microevolution and macroevolution . 1357995_1376535
(0.7) usually when we think about macroevolutionary models we're thinking of them on a different level . 1385545_1390705
okay +..?
okay can I move it ? 1391505_1395265
alright . 1395985_1396365
usually we're thinking of them on a different level . 1398225_1400445
we're thinking of them +... 1402365_1403465
in a broader sense . 1407385_1408325
now we're thinking about them in terms of evolutionary pattern oops (0.5) and we're thinking of them specifically about the way that microevolutionary forces that we've talked about last week cause macroevolutionary change . 1409585_1427205
and there're two models that are used frequently by people who are interested <in the macroevolutionary> &~pro in the macroevolutionary processes . 1428125_1435005
one is phyletic gradualism and one is punctuated equilibrium or two is punctuated equilibrium . 1435945_1443905
and these are (0.6) usually constructed as competing ideas . 1444965_1454345
and contrasting ideas . 1455245_1456665
so what I wanna to do is explain what they are very briefly . 1457985_1461065
gradualism comes out_of classic Darwinian thinking . 1463025_1466265
remember when we talked about what is Darwinism gradualism is one of those tenets of what Darwinism was . 1467085_1474045
gradualism is the idea basically that you have accumulation of microevolutionary changes that add up to make macroevolutionary change . 1474345_1484105
it's an extension basically of the same microevolutionary processes well of_course Darwin wasn't thinking about all of them but we nowadays do &~n it's an accumulation of all these things that add up to major change over a long period of time +... 1486525_1502925
it doesn't classically ever say anything about the rate of evolution . 1506585_1510165
sometimes changes accumulate more rapidly than others sometimes changes accumulate more slowly . 1510545_1516325
but it's the idea that you can have major change without the interjection of any other force than the microevolutionary forces that we talked about before . 1516885_1524745
punctuated equilibrium +... 1525765_1526845
people like Mayr will argue that it's &~part it's a very old theory people like Gould would argue that it's quite new . 1529465_1535745
and it was first promoted by Miles Eldridge and Stephen J Gould in nineteen seventy two and certainly has carried over into most paleontological fields now and most evolutionary biologists agree that punctuated equilibrium certainly explains the evolutionary trajectory of many phylum . 1536445_1556905
the evolutionary history of many phylum . 1557565_1560085
what it is is the idea that evolution doesn't occur simply as a result of gradual processes but that it actually occurs because of speciations . 1561295_1573735
that really you can not get very far in terms of evolutionary change according to punctuationalists if you just have change within a species . 1574895_1584235
for punctuationalists you need to have the dramatic effects of a speciation event in_order_to transcend type which is effectively what they they said . 1585215_1596795
that you can only because of the constraints of an organism because if you change something too much it's going to affect negatively something &=laughs:SUm else because of the constraints of an organism you hafta have basically the entire genome shaken up a bit . 1598275_1610995
you hafta have some really you hafta have a period of very very intensive evolutionary forces and that occurs at speciation . 1611865_1620385
and that is the fundamental difference between gradualism and punctuated equilibrium . 1620805_1625145
punctuationalists feel that species are necessary speciations the formation of new species are necessary to have major evolutionary change . 1625545_1634605
they came up with the idea the reason it's called punctuated equilibrium is because they are paleontologists who are very interested in the fossil record . 1635825_1643345
and one of the things that you see in the fossil records of most groups is that there's gaps that you'll find &-uh something you'll find species that sort of look a_lot alike and they they &~lo they they don't change too much in the fossil record then you see some change . 1643785_1660825
and they often have been interpreted in the past as +//. 1661595_1664615
and then they change so what you would basically have lemme just draw it on the board right now . 1664935_1668735
&=writes:board you would have &-um basically this <here we'd be> looking at something this is time +... 1670035_1676935
this axis here .
you'd have sort_of this this some fossils here fossil species A +... 1680315_1686915
and then there's sort_of +//. 1690465_1691485
then you go through where you don't see anything and then you sort_of see fossil species B +... 1691725_1696105
and according to gradual models the evolutionary pattern is simply that fossil species A sort_of just turned into fossil species B over time because change just happened over time . 1697665_1713625
sometimes there are transitional forms . 1714365_1715905
and then it's very easy to show this sort_of thing but sometimes there's not and often there aren't transitional forms . 1717255_1721915
and so what Gould argued was that that it's not an accident that there aren't transitional forms . 1722455_1727015
the transitional forms occur but they happen in such a very very fast period of time geological time such a short period of geological time that you just don't see them . 1727475_1737035
because they happened at speciations . 1737595_1739295
and speciations happened very very quickly when evolutionary forces are very very intense . 1739935_1743975
so what he would argue is that what you really have when you think about evolution is usually a period of stasis where there's no change at all and then a period of rapid rapid rapid evolutionary change where there's speciations happening and then you have periods of stasis again . 1744505_1761505
so he would argue that you have species A and it doesn't just turn into species B what you really have is species A a very very rapid speciation where species B comes off here and then it comes back over and out competes species A . 1761785_1780425
then species A goes extinct . 1781305_1782865
and species B continues +... 1784485_1785625
and what he argues is that this is more logical because the constraints of form won't allow major major change without a speciation event . 1789655_1799655
does this make sense ? 1800655_1801455
(0.6) is this &~me yeah . 1804695_1808295
what's the difference in the geologic time scales ? 1809115_1810835
I'm sorry ? 1811275_1811735
how how much difference in time scales <is there> ? 1811995_1814035
in time scale ? 1814495_1815655
between the punctuated equilibrium .
oh . 1817465_1817605
the time scale doesn't hafta really vary that much at all . 1817885_1820665
the idea is basically here the idea is <that the> &~branch that the process between form A and form B is a gradual one . 1820905_1829625
it's just an accumulation of changes . 1829885_1831225
what he would argue here is that the process of transformation is very fast . 1831805_1836485
and it depends on the species . 1837225_1838305
&~w but in the case of something with long generations like us it could be you know within maybe even a hundred thousand years . 1838925_1845285
which is a drop in the bucket when we think about when we think about big time . 1845495_1850395
which is a different way of thinking about time . 1851235_1854555
but we'll get into it in <on that> another +//. 1855415_1857375
which we'll get into in another time . 1857595_1859155
that when we think about evolutionary time and geological time with long lived organisms like we are we're really looking at what seems to us a very very long long long period of time . 1859655_1872195
but in terms of the history of the earth and in terms of the history of our species they're actually rather short periods of time . 1873055_1879095
so yeah ? 1880395_1880895
so punctuated equilibrium requires like a massive dying off the . 1881435_1885915
that's how they would explain that exactly . 1886215_1888715
that there would be a dying off of species A . 1889215_1891475
it +//. 1892015_1892615
I'll come back to this in a second when we talk about speciation models because it really is derived from a model of Ernst Mayr called that he talks about &~s I suspect in that article I get those articles &~mu muddled up called peripatric speciation . 1893535_1908635
and this is generally agreed it's most most people agree that this is how speciation generally occurs . 1909115_1915295
when one species splits into two +... 1915615_1917235
imagine you have a species not like humans (be)cause humans are weird because we live everywhere . 1919165_1924085
but imagine you have a species that lives happily in some location . 1924665_1929625
in some general area . 1930365_1931445
and there are lots and lots_of populations all these little circles are populations &=writes:board of the species . 1931945_1937185
but Ernst Mayr proposed and one of the things that he's most famous for is his model of how speciation occurs . 1938485_1946105
what he argues is that generally you don't have the transformation of a large chunk of this population dividing off into another . 1946325_1955845
you have one small population that gets isolated from the rest of the species . 1956465_1961665
reproductively isolated from the rest of the species range so you have one population or a small &~ar part of that species that gets isolated from the rest of it and no longer interbreeds with the rest of the species . 1962205_1974225
over subsequent generations the differences between <this small> &~gen this small population that becomes isolated and the rest of the species become greater and greater . 1975315_1984975
especially if this small population is in a different environment where there's different selection pressure and if it's a very small population which it frequently is where the forces of drift that we talked about last time are so intense . 1985715_1999815
and where mutations might have a real chance of surviving . 2001325_2005445
so this is how Ernst Mayr proposed that speciations occur . 2006385_2010665
it's peripatric +...
&=writes:board speciations .
but Ernst Mayr would suggest that this is the only way that major change could occur . 2012545_2021845
what he thinks is that both both things are perfectly reasonable but sometimes major change happens because of speciation and usually it does but he also argues that you can have the accumulation of microevolutionary changes without having a branching . 2023285_2036885
this requires punctuated equilibrium requires the branch for change . 2038425_2044425
okay ?
it requires this species replacing this one . 2045385_2050385
coming in and replacing it requires the branch for change . 2050395_2053475
but gradualists don't require . 2056015_2058415
okay <kind of I> guess is the major distinction +... 2059195_2061175
species and type . 2064955_2065735
I think this is really important and I think it becomes really important historically and in terms of race . 2066915_2071375
because it comes back to what we talked about the very first day and how people think essentialistically . 2071815_2080535
is that a word ? 2080895_2081455
essentialistic doesn't &~esse &-uh essentially how they think in terms of types +... 2082575_2090595
and &~wh you have to &~b you hafta think a minute about what a taxonomy is . 2093755_2100195
anybody want to broach that +..? 2100915_2101975
when I say taxonomy do people know what I'm talking about ? 2104755_2106855
+, there's a large &~s areas of biology that are devoted to systematics . 2107855_2115795
basically how you organize your organisms how do you classify the world ? 2116055_2120035
before evolutionary theory that's fundamentally a large part of what biologists did . 2120255_2125315
they wanted to see what kinds of things were out there and they wanted to classify them . 2126575_2132115
everybody was basically an anatomist or something <they wanted> they wanted to do this sort_of list of features and the characteristics and the ways of life of all the kinds of &~s animals and plants and things that were around them on the earth . 2132855_2146155
and then they arranged these things in taxonomies . 2147265_2149625
the famous &~taxon all of our our systematic system . 2150785_2153805
our system of classification is based on Linneas . 2154925_2158925
that we've talked about before who in the eighteenth century came up with the systemae@s:fra naturae@s:fra that +//. 2160965_2167085
it really forms the basis of all taxonomies today . 2167325_2169985
these are the classic ones that you guys know about xxx the ones that it's hierarchically based sort_of nesting going down from the smallest unit up to the highest unit . 2171285_2182025
and that basically he broke down the &~anim the world into plants and animals because that's what he could see . 2182885_2188925
so there are two kingdoms the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom and then within each of these there were further subdivisions and you can see these sort_of as nested eggs . 2189105_2198385
as as the categories get smaller and smaller as you go down . 2199715_2203975
so that within each kingdom there were a_couple_of phylum and then within each phylum there were several classes and within the classes there were several orders and within the orders there were several families and within the families there were several genera plural for genus and within the genus there're sometimes several species . 2204335_2224775
for us as Homo &~s &-uh ourselves we of_course get placed in the animal kingdom . 2226045_2231345
he had us in the phylum Vertebrata we are vertebrates we are vertebrates we're in the class Mammalia we're mammals and Linneas recognized all of this and he put us in the order primates . 2233025_2246945
an order that we share with prosimians you know what a prosimian is ? 2248915_2255155
they're like lemurs . 2255635_2256395
have you ever seen lemurs in the zoo ? 2256815_2258355
they have they're tiny little animals &=laughs:multiple and they've got +//. 2258515_2260995
the ones you see in the zoo all the time (be)cause they do so well they're Lemur_Catta . 2261655_2264175
they don't even <look like> look like &~prim +//. 2264415_2265195
you wouldn't think of (th)em as primates at all they look like &-um sort_of squirrelly things . 2265455_2268835
and &-uh &~le they include prosimians monkeys apes and us . 2269655_2274135
that's the order primates our family is the family Hominidae (0.7) we belong to the family &=writes:board Hominidae usually (0.7) and our genus is Homo and our species is Sapiens . 2275025_2301665
(0.5) and Linneas of_course came up with the subspecies that I told you about on the first day . 2306125_2310525
where you have Homo_Sapiens_Americanus and Homo_Sapiens_Afer and Homo_Sapens_Asiaticus and Homo_Sapiens_Monstrosus and Homo_Sapiens_Europaeus . 2311445_2326145
and so he had subspecies as well . 2326625_2328225
but what was he actually doing +//. 2329025_2330265
first of all +... 2330525_2330765
what did he do ? 2331685_2333685
why was he doing this ? 2334585_2335565
he was putting names on types of things . 2335985_2340005
and what we'll see that's really interesting is that other cultures do this too . 2340165_2343205
other cultures also put names on types of things in the natural world . 2343885_2347945
and one of the things that almost everybody has in common is that they all have categories that correspond to the Linnean species . 2348725_2356325
people like to typologize . 2357845_2359545
it's part of our brains . 2360405_2361045
we like to typologize we like to classify things . 2361895_2364715
and one of the things that's really stable is species . 2365155_2367615
can anybody think of why ? 2368255_2369195
they can't interbreed ?
they can't interbreed exactly . 2371935_2375055
because they really are essential categories . 2375495_2378595
the ways that most people define species these days is based on interfertility . 2379795_2385075
members of a species can interbreed . 2385775_2386995
and members of a separate species cannot . 2388045_2390405
and so that's why species probably of all the taxomonic &~te taxonomic categories really is in a sense a very typological thing so it really conforms to the mindset of people in the field +... 2391585_2405765
but all of the categories were treated all of Linneas's categories were treated in the same way that species were . 2409345_2416405
they were types . 2416865_2417765
they couldn't be transcended . 2418005_2419165
they were fixed types . 2419485_2420585
that he had described that were a part of nature . 2421005_2422785
that couldn't be transcended . 2423105_2424305
and the species was almost always the foremost and most strong of these things . 2424925_2432045
after Darwin there was an attempt to evolutionize the taxonomy . 2434545_2437805
what were these taxonomies based on ? 2439205_2440745
<think about this> Linneas based it on morphology right ? 2442345_2446605
he based it on how things looked . 2446805_2448065
things that looked more similar were things that had similar embryologies were things that resembled each_other he thought should be grouped into the same group so if he was looking for a number of species to put into a genus he did it basically based on what they looked like . 2448675_2465495
and what people have tried to do since Darwin since Darwin is try to evolutionize the taxonomies that Linneas created . 2466775_2473655
sometimes it works . 2474055_2474795
because morphology &~peop animals tend to look a_lot alike if they're more closely related to each_other . 2475175_2481535
so often these taxonomies really do reflect evolutionary relationships . 2482115_2486755
but sometimes they don't +... 2487975_2489375
sometimes they don't . 2489675_2493955
it was &~want people +//. 2494815_2495915
when you evolutionize taxonomy you want to have taxonomy represent phylogeny . 2496635_2500955
okay ?
you want the taxonomy to represent evolutionary relationships . 2503675_2507715
let me give you an example of how it doesn't work . 2509375_2511575
sometimes .
perfect example is us as human beings +... 2513915_2516555
we're traditionally considered to be a part of a superfamily called the Hominoidea . 2517055_2523935

the Hominoidea is a superfamily this is a great example . 2524795_2533515
&=writes:board we're classically considered to be part of the superfamily Hominoidea . 2533165_2536865
not to be confused with Hominidae Hominoidea . 2537245_2542905
and the Hominoidea include several different kinds of animals . 2542925_2549525
they include gibbons +... 2550265_2553625

(0.5) and for this to make evolutionary sense okay all of these guys for this to make evolutionary sense enough for this classification this taxonomy to represent phylogeny yeah ? 2599865_2614965
I was just wondering if the classification of superfamily comes before or after family ? 2615385_2619985
it comes above family . 2620085_2621305
so after ⌈ order ⌉ .

there's always I +//. 2625805_2627025
these are just the very basic ones that I put in . 2626525_2629165
there's infraorders and suborders there's suborder and infraorder order and there's superfamily family and subfamily . 2629445_2636025

in fact what you see in the real &~cla in what we know now to be the real evolutionary relationships based on biochemistry and a_lot_of other things is that in fact it's orangutans that are out here and this group the ones that cluster together are the gorillas and chimps and the humans +... 2710555_2732235
so to make this classification that means that humans are more closely related of_course to chimps and gorillas than they are to orangutans but more interestingly gorillas and chimpanzees are much more closely related to humans than they are to orangutans . 2735465_2750985
they share many more biochemical sequences . 2752345_2755405
and based on genetics we know pretty unequivocally that orangutans are a much more distant relative to the African apes than humans are . 2757585_2769565
we also know it from fossil data . 2770805_2772325
we have fossil orangutans already diverged from the chimp human and gorilla group at twenty million years ago . 2774005_2781605
which is a long long time ago . 2782145_2783085
and we don't have chimps and humans diverging (un)til about six million years ago . 2783855_2787795
so there's a much much closer relationship between gorillas chimps and humans than there is to orangutans now if you wanted to make this an evolutionary classification what would you have to do ? 2788395_2800295
you'd hafta change this whole order you'd hafta make the pongids only reflect the orangutans . 2800935_2806455
which is now what people are trying to do get established . 2807055_2810575
only affect &~the only orangs would be in the pongids . 2811235_2814715
so there would be within the superfamily Hominoidea a family that includes the gibbons and a family that includes the pongids . 2815175_2822395
and then another family that includes the gorillas chimps and humans . 2822835_2829355
and then a third family which is gorillas chimps and humans . 2830075_2835215
what do we call it ? 2835695_2836655
(0.8) what would you call it ? 2842965_2844445
(0.8) the name is there . 2851585_2852485
(0.4) we could call it the hominids right +..? 2853325_2857845
to evolutionize taxonomy we could call this family that includes gorillas chimps and humans the hominids and a_lot_of people have proposed that . 2861085_2868605
within subfamilies within it . 2868825_2870505
that include Panines for chimps gorillas and Hominines for humans . 2870725_2875985
would you like to guess that this is not very well accepted ? 2877165_2880545
it actually reflects evolutionary relationships but people don't like it . 2881625_2887985
why do you think they don't like it ? 2889465_2890985
(0.7) .
it doesn't set us apart . 2891105_2896625
pardon ? 2898325_2898725
it doesn't set us ⌈ apart ⌉ ?
⌊ it ⌋ doesn't set us apart . 2898945_2900825
it doesn't conform I mean &~there we're very anthropocentric which is sort_of like ethnocentrism applied to species . 2901245_2907125
but not only are we just anthropocentric we're also incredibly typological . 2908165_2911965
and we really see ourselves as a type apart from the rest of the world . 2912445_2917185
that's one of the fundamental typological differences is us versus all the other animals . 2917685_2922405
and this kind of classification does not conform to our ideas of typology not +//. 2923805_2928985
it doesn't conform to the essential categories that we consider to be important . 2929405_2932505
and therefore it's a difficult thing for people to broach . 2933685_2936005
many textbooks now if you look at them will have the classification with hominids meaning the African apes with us included as one of the African apes . 2936245_2946205
and hominines as the subfamily that we belong to . 2946805_2949845
but many textbooks and for those of you who've had one sixty one I don't know which textbook you used and what it classified things as but it could very well have had humans classified as the family Hominidae . 2950545_2963585
and then for people like who are sort_of old and conservative <they don't like> &~cal they don't like changing their names you know ? 2963985_2971305
they've been calling (th)em hominids all their life I have a really hard time referring to hominids as hominines . 2971825_2977345
it bugs me . 2977985_2978525
I still wanna call (th)em hominids I've been teaching about hominids for years . 2979075_2982135
it's very hard to change to hominine . 2982635_2984555
and so these names these terms don't necessarily change . 2984935_2987755
so what I wanted to point out is that what +//. 2988275_2990495
even though we understand &~th taxonomy is we want to evolutionize taxonomies we want to make our taxonomies concordant with what we understand about evolution . 2990755_3000535
we still are very committed to our types . 3001075_3003255
to the types that we have in our heads whether those are socially derived or scientifically derived . 3003875_3007975
oh homology versus homoplasy . 3009655_3012255
okay +...
&-um homology is the idea that two things that that &~s characteristics that are shared between two species are due to common descent . 3013375_3029315
or common ancestry +... 3030705_3031745
and that is the idea really behind using morphology the way things look to understand &~hum &-uh evolutionary relationships . 3035065_3042985
it's the idea that the most parsimonious the most simple understanding of why two things are alike is because they were both present in the parent of the two . 3043485_3053885
if you look like your sister the most simple explanation is that you got those traits from your parents . 3054865_3061325
homoplasy is when that doesn't happen . 3063585_3066745
it's when two species are very similar but they derive those similarities independently . 3068365_3076485
it's also called parallel evolution . 3077545_3080185
and &~i there's generally an assumption in all of modern systematics and in all of modern classifications that similarity is an indication of evolutionary relationship because of the assumption of homology . 3082715_3097315
okay ? 3098115_3098495
(0.5) where are we +..?
how do we determine evolutionary relationships ? 3107005_3111085
or the relationships between species ? 3112185_3116265
oops +/.
+, (0.8) basically of_course what you're doing is looking for features traits that two organisms share okay that's really what you're doing . 3130615_3138835
and these can be all different kinds of differences . 3139395_3141855
paleontologists use traits that you can find in the skeleton . 3143255_3146815
because that's what's there . 3147635_3148575
geneticists use traits that you can derive from &-um genes . 3149815_3154775
that you can derive from DNA . 3155295_3156375
but basically it's all the same . 3157035_3158255
they're all different features that you're looking for and you're looking for how to assess variation . 3159485_3164285
you're looking for how to assess relationships you're looking for how do you assess how many traits two organisms share in common . 3165145_3173325
now &~f there are two fundamental ways that people use &-um this information to try to understand relationships . 3174645_3182365
phenetic approaches are when you use anything everything . 3184135_3187555
and the numerical taxonomists are examples of pheneticists . 3188555_3192635
what they basically want to do is you take every piece of information that's available to you and you assume that most of it is going to be valid . 3193495_3202915
and you have so many traits that it really outweighs traits that might not be +//. 3203535_3208735
that may not give you valid information so you just basically take all the traits that are available to you and you weigh them all in various sorts of ways but you basically weigh them all in assessing the similarity or difference . 3208885_3222085
in nineteen sixty six a new school of phylogenetics was born basically with Willi &~Hav Hennig who formed a new science called cladistics . 3223005_3232745
which is used now in virtually all &~ev studies of evolutionary biology . 3233615_3237935
and the argument there is that not all traits should be treated equally . 3238875_3243655
that some traits provide evolutionary information and other traits are just not valid . 3244695_3250835
and he argued and the whole school argues that the only traits that should be paid attention to +... 3251775_3258375
are those that give you genealogical information . 3260825_3264565
and so they're the ones that are shared and derived features in two groups of organisms . 3267105_3276345
I'll talk about this in a second . 3276925_3278085
the idea of cladistics +... 3279685_3281225
and cladistics has genealogy at its core +... 3283245_3285605
it has genealogy at its core it's the &~geneal genealogical science . 3289195_3293695
is to create something called cladograms which are little drawings like I just drew here of evolutionary relationships . 3294175_3302355
(0.5) so +... 3304295_3306995
they're cladograms .
which are hypotheses of relationships . 3307515_3314455
cladograms are hypotheses of relationships . 3315375_3318335
&=writing:board they're hypotheses of relationships and what you're trying to do is create clusters of monophyletic groups which I'll explain in a second to determine sister groups . 3320055_3334555
Let's use our chimps humans and orangutans as an example okay ? 3335655_3340735
say you have three species . 3340975_3342215
chimps humans and orangutans . 3342725_3345345
and you want to determine their relationships among each_other . 3345725_3350265
you can create three potential cladograms . 3351205_3353865
three hypotheses . 3354945_3355905
okay ? 3356965_3357265
of these relationships . 3357305_3358605
one +... 3359545_3360165
&=writes:board you have <there'll be> three of them two and three . 3362785_3368685
these are the three potential hypotheses that you could have . 3370475_3374055
there can't be any more right ? 3374735_3375515
there is one's with chimps and humans as the sister group and orangutans as the most distant one . 3376115_3383275
you could have one with chimps and orangutans as the sister group with humans out here right ? 3384235_3391315
or what's the third one +..? 3391775_3393655
&~hu &-uh humans and orangutans humans and orangutans as the sister group with chimps out here . 3396305_3401785
and of_course all of these hypotheses have been suggested in the literature over time . 3402385_3407685
and in fact very interestingly this hypothesis was suggested &=laughs:S1 fairly recently it's a very it's very unsupported . 3408065_3415285
it's based on some kind of silly traits but . 3415945_3418825
so these are the three potential hypotheses . 3420145_3422485
so what a cladist wants to do is decide which one of these cladograms is the most parsimonious . 3422965_3430705
parsimonious means sensible basically . 3432145_3437125
which of these is the most supported ? 3438005_3440405
which of these fits the data the best +..? 3441145_3443605
and that's what a cladist wants to do . 3445105_3448425
and what they do is they look at series of traits to do that . 3448835_3452355
they use something called +//. 3453775_3455295
they want to determine which of these sister groups would be the right one . 3455495_3459595
now each one of these things in a cladogram all of these are supposed to be monophyletic groups . 3459675_3465435
all of these branches are called clades . 3466295_3469775
okay +..? 3470895_3471535
&=writes:board they're called clades and clades is another way of &~call of saying monophyletic group . 3473305_3479305
I'll explain that .
okay equal a monophyletic +... 3479865_3484725
group . 3487505_3487925
and these can occur on a number of different levels . 3488545_3492145
theoretically if a taxonomy was evolutionized appropriately each level in the taxonomy would be a monophyletic group . 3492705_3501445
so you could have different classes as a monophyletic group and you could make up a cladogram looking at mammals and birds and their relationship to reptiles or something like that . 3501985_3514005
using classes but we'll talk about that actually in a second (be)cause that's misleading . 3514305_3517605
but you do it on a bunch of different levels . 3518085_3519785
but the groups hafta be monophyletic . 3520105_3522245
monophyletic means an ancestor and all it's descendents . 3522785_3527605
all of them . 3528585_3529025
(0.6) and this is important because +//. 3529885_3537465
yeah ?
how do you determine the structure of the cladogram ? 3538565_3541385
like ⌈ regardless ⌉ +/. 3541625_3542245
⌊ huh ⌋ +/.
+, where you put who how do you determine that they haven't just +/. 3542845_3545645
+, ⌈ by the ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ divided ⌋ altogether or ⌈ xxx ⌉ ?
⌊ basically ⌋ by the number of the special kinds of traits that they share . 3546785_3549865
mm +/.
+, the the number of shared derived features that they have and I'll come to that in just a second okay (be)cause it's it gets complicated and I have a little chart to show it . 3550565_3559725
but basically the the most parsimonious cladogram is determined by the number of the one +... 3559925_3567925
the most parsimonious cladogram is decided by the the number of certain kinds of features shared by these three different groups . 3570005_3578985
no xxx my question is who determines that there was one shoot here and then two +//. 3579365_3584445
&~re regardless of who you &~f finally assign those groups ⌈ to ⌉ +/. 3584745_3588085
⌊ mhm ⌋ +/.
+, <that the> <that the> that the that the actual structure of it is determined as such ? 3588665_3593265
oh just why is it determined like a triangle like that ? 3593885_3596325
yeah or however you wanna however you wanna visualize it . 3596935_3599695
well because &~wheth it's always &~m it &-uh it's always basically no matter how big your cladogram becomes at its core it is always resolved in trichotomies . 3599775_3607875
so there's always three . 3608175_3609115
so two hafta be closer together than a third and this is just how it's drawn out as a convention . 3609635_3614315
so what you're doing is &~sh showing the relationship of two things here and a more distant one there . 3614815_3620295
the idea being that this would be the &~dif the common ancestor of these two right ? 3621195_3627275
and then this would be the common ancestor of all three . 3627535_3630855
does this make sense +..? 3631915_3632975
(be)cause you're looking at three and you're really looking at the you're looking <at the> &-um at the just at at +//. 3633935_3643715
you're really trying to just it's just a relative thing which of the two are more closely related to the third . 3643835_3648295
time is not an issue on a cladogram . 3648655_3650315
but would the possibility for instance that all three of them diverged at the same time ? 3652195_3657155
like if ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ it's assumed ⌋ in phylogenetics that this doesn't happen . 3657675_3661155
that everything occurs through branching . 3661415_3663095
and usually three don't diverge at the same time there's usually one that will branch first . 3663595_3667755
two will be more closely related than a third . 3668635_3670775
so there's usually xxx trichotomies that are &~at that absolutely have a single common ancestor . 3672335_3675795
so there's almost always in fact in in phylogenetics there's always the idea that there's splits of their branches . 3677725_3684365
and trichotomies actually three things that would branch from the same ancestor are usually depicted only in terms of the branching +//. 3685165_3693465
as branching <of the> pairs . 3693525_3694905
that that has a_lot to do with how Mayr talks about how +/. 3696925_3699985
mhm +/.
+, biological species become reproductively isolated . 3700685_3703145
right +... 3703885_3704285
and the other thing also is &~to because +//. 3706945_3709965
and you gotta think about it also in terms of monophyletic groups . 3710425_3713205
let's talk about monophyletic groups so we can come back to this again . 3713825_3716425
because if there's a triple branch there's not +//. 3717145_3720445
we're not gonna have monophyly . 3720585_3721945
and and let's talk about this in just a second . 3722285_3724945
a monophyletic group is an ancestor of all its descendents right ? 3725425_3728745
so down here this all this whole thing could be considered if this is all the descendents . 3729025_3733205
if these are all the descendents that are possible this down here could be considered &~mono the whole &~f cluster could be a monophyletic group . 3733915_3740935
because there would be the ancestor and here are all the descendents . 3741635_3744135
this actually isn't because there're actually other descendents as well . 3744335_3747355
but in certain certainly in circumstances it could . 3748075_3758295
each branch though here is a monophyletic group you have the ancestor of all the orangutans not at the node but just beyond the node basically here of &~al this ancestor and all its descendents all orangutans all +//. 3752345_3767325
everything along this clade is a result of this one ancestor . 3767725_3772005
this branch here is supposed to be the ancestor and all of its descendents . 3773785_3777105
and this branch here is supposed to be the ancestor of all of its descendents . 3778095_3780995
and so all of these sticks are considered to be monophyletic groups and for cladistics to work they need to be monophyletic groups . 3781575_3790475
(0.4) anyone see a problem with this ? 3792295_3797315
(0.5) you might see it later because often cladistics is used on groups that are not monophyletic . 3800905_3809465
but it's a fundamental assumption of cladistics that each clade is monophyletic . 3809945_3815705
and so the techniques to work they need to be monophyletic . 3816105_3819665
there are certain assumptions in cladistics they assume that homology is +//. 3821485_3827605
okay what we wanna do the &~reas the way that the most parsimonious cladogram is determined is by looking at the number of shared derived features that two groups share . 3827735_3840755
so if this were for instance which is the most parsimonious one this is the most parsimonious cladogram based on virtually every trait we have ever looked at that we've looked at today . 3842055_3854055
that actually chimps and humans share more features that are considered to be synapomorphies shared derived features &=pause_while_writing I'll just write synapomorphy +... 3854405_3868645
&=writes:board are shared +... 3869265_3873245
and derived &=pause_while_writing than chimps and orangutans do or that humans and orangutans do . 3875305_3884685
shared derived features mean that they're features that are not +//. 3885145_3888425
derived is the opposite alternative . 3888945_3890285
they're features that have undergone evolutionary change that you find in these groups of organisms and we'll talk in a second about how whether something is primitive or derived is determined (be)cause this can be problematic as well +... 3892475_3904815
and they assume that homology is the most common &~for cause of synapomorphies . 3907955_3912155
Rachel +/. 3913255_3913515
hm +/.
+, I think there is a question in the back ? 3913635_3915395
sure yeah ? 3915555_3916995
I have a question of what &-uh what would a nonmonophyletic group look like ? 3917445_3921525
a nonmonophyletic group +//. 3922525_3924045
let's +//.
okay +... 3924505_3924625
it's assumed for instance that all of these higher categories are not monophyletic . 3924945_3933025
recently it's been argued that in fact reptiles are not monophyletic . 3933705_3940645
because these are all +//. 3941385_3944105
reptiles are a class and so are birds and so for that you you would expect that a &~mon monophyletic group would include an ancestor and all of its descendents . 3945605_3956905
but birds are among the &~an are the among the descendents of reptiles . 3957385_3961625
it's now pretty well understood that birds evolved from reptiles . 3962545_3967165
and so that if you had the ancestor of all reptiles you would have to include birds as well within it . 3968405_3974765
if you include all its descendents . 3975185_3976705
and so reptiles now would not be considered a monophyletic group . 3978245_3981965
therefore that taxonomy is not a good evolutionary taxonomy according to these systematics . 3982605_3988245
birds however within the reptiles would be a monophyletic group . 3988565_3992445
and so it would be a single ancestor of all the birds and then all its descendents . 3992665_3995545
another example of a nonmonophyletic group would be if there were multiple would be some hypotheses that we'll be talking about in terms of race . 3997385_4005965
all the polygenic theories of race would be nonmonophyletic theories . 4006585_4011145
because then you'd have multiple ancestors and multiple descendents . 4011945_4015365
&~s any category below the species level in addition is not a monophyletic group . 4016785_4023545
certainly in humans it is not a monophyletic group . 4024655_4027755
there is no such thing as a pure race okay and that's what <it would> imply . 4028555_4034295
but a_lot_of people model races as monophyletic groups and we'll be coming to that . 4034855_4039275
there's no such thing as an ancestor of all members of a single race and all it's descendents . 4040415_4046095
because there's gene flow between members of different racial groups . 4046335_4049915
yeah ? 4050215_4050355
I mean &~an xxx so that would be another example of a nonmonophyletic group . 4053975_4056915
so if races are treated like this and this is what we'll be coming to if races are treated like this it's an inappropriate application of cladistics because races are not monophyletic . 4057335_4068635
there's gene flow between the branches . 4068995_4071775
and it's probably not fair to even model races this way as branches at all . 4073095_4077135
because whenever you're modeling things as branches you're assuming monophyly . 4077415_4083955
an ancestor and all its descendents +... 4083375_4085095
okay .
the steps of cladistics I was &~s what time is it ? 4089235_4091915
oh we've got time .
&-um (0.5) let me tell ya did you write this down ? 4092315_4102595
these are sort_of the steps of cladistics so we can talk about these things okay ? 4103135_4106035
first you want to create cladograms right +... 4106595_4108955
these clusters and you want to determine the most parsimonious one . 4111335_4114755
the way you do this is you resolve trichotomies using what's called character analysis . 4116075_4121155
you analyze characters to decide which ones are shared and derived +... 4121915_4126355
I'm sorry do &-uh <that is> which ones are primitive and which ones aren't and to see which ones are shared and I'll show you an example of this hypothetical example . 4128815_4135215
you assume that homology is the most common cause of the synapomorphies those are the shared derived features that you're using and you determine polarity through something called outgroup analysis +... 4136575_4150875
frequently theoretically most of the time people are choosing polarity on the basis of outgroup analysis and here is a little example of a cladistic analysis . 4153875_4164635
using very sorts of simple traits that we can sort_of think about and ones that I can use as a vehicle for talking about some uniquely human features . 4165355_4171595
okay ? 4172655_4172935
can you see this ? 4173455_4174395
no +/.
+, no . 4175115_4175595
okay . 4176175_4177455
here we have let me explain this to you and again you don't hafta copy this down you can get it off the web when it's up and then it'll give you a chance to review it because then you can circle the stuff yourself . 4178105_4190405
and think about it +... 4192105_4192925
okay well what our categories here are humans chimps baboons and the lemurs . 4193025_4201985
okay .
now remember I was telling you about lemurs lemurs you would not even think that lemurs were primates they don't look like monkeys they don't look like apes they don't look like us they look like squirrels . 4203865_4213805
but they're members of the primates . 4214225_4215365
and this is an example of how you would use outgroup analysis . 4216145_4219065
it's assumed that prosimians are more primitive primates than any of the other kinds of primates . 4219405_4224605
a baboon is a monkey an old world monkey that lives in Africa that you guys have seen . 4224685_4229405
and in actually <some parts> xxx the old world but close relatives do . 4229575_4236675
and chimps of_course are an African ape that you guys are probably familiar with . 4237835_4242155
they're the ones you see in circuses that ride bicycles and they're very very smart and very very much like us in many ways . 4242975_4249675
and humans are of_course us . 4250155_4251315
we are very very closely related xxx to chimpanzees and we have many many things in common with them including the ability to use language of some sort . 4252115_4262795
&~hu chimps do not learn language like we do but they can learn huge vocabularies and they can learn to manipulate human language in remarkable ways . 4263675_4271875
like make up new words and do all sorts of cool things with language . 4272295_4277055
so a_lot_of people have suggested that they have protolanguage . 4277915_4279935
one of the things that humans have or don't have that all these other guys do have well <at any rate> one of the things +//. 4281425_4288305
using outgroup analysis is a method of establishing polarity . 4288745_4292345
what they do what you do is you pick an outgroup . 4293105_4296225
in this case it's the lemurs . 4296525_4297745
here <it's a> it's a group that is related to the animals that you're trying to to understand in this case what are the three &~trichotom what are the tree &~clad what three cladograms we're trying to determine here are +... 4298715_4314995
&=writes:board human chimp baboon +... 4317375_4318755
or chimp baboon human or finally human baboon +... 4320845_4329005
and chimp . 4330705_4332765
and what we want to know is which is the most parsimonious cladogram . 4333285_4336045
that's what you would be that's the question that you're asking in doing a particular analysis . 4336565_4340985
the first thing you wanna do is you have a bunch of traits that you've observed on these organisms then you want to know how to analyze these traits . 4341705_4348285
the first thing you have to do since you only want to look at shared derived features features that are not primitive and features that are shared is that you have to determine polarity . 4348725_4359005
how do you know whether something's a primitive trait or a derived trait ? 4359965_4363125
well you compare it to an outgroup an organism or even a group of organisms that you think represent the primitive condition . 4363865_4372045
and so in this little example I'm gonna use a lemur cause it's easy to do . 4373225_4378185
and there's no reason why that's small it just came out that way because I did the little sub three and that carried over in the next cell that's the only reason . 4378525_4387965
the canine p@l three complex is a dental complex that we paleontologists are very interested in because it's something that's unique in humans that you don't see in virtually any of the other apes . 4388425_4401025
you'd think +//. 4402615_4402915
your canine is the C the canine tooth <or your eye tooth> think about your teeth for just a second and you can use your tongue in your mouth and you have two incisors in the front they're snippy teeth right ? 4403115_4416135
they snip and there's the central one and then there's a lateral one . 4416535_4419335
and then right next to that the third tooth over if your thinking of a quadrant of your jaw a quarter of your jaw the first tooth is the first incisor usually the biggest tooth in your front of your mouth then you have the lateral incisor then you have a canine . 4419985_4432685
your canine tooth is pretty small . 4433585_4436565
relative to anybody else on here . 4437825_4439245
if you think of apes if you think of your dog if you think of virtually &~y of many many mammals canine teeth are big . 4440025_4447425
and in a_lot_of primates most primates they have what's called septoral premolar which is the tooth that the canine rubs against when you close your mouth it's a premolar that's down here . 4448525_4459425
and that premolar is angled and it's got a cutting blade on it . 4459925_4463585
a honing blade . 4463825_4464505
so whenever you open and shut your mouth if you have a big canine and a septoral premolar it sharpens it . 4465005_4470445
baboons have it chimpanzees have it people don't have it . 4471145_4476045
it's a unique human feature . 4476695_4478175
in terms of the primates so we know what we would do so what we wanna know is what's shared here ? 4478995_4483775
I don't have a pen and I don't know <I'm trying to do it now and it really> xxx see but basically what you want to do with these things is to go through and circle the ones that are shared . 4484875_4494335
so in this case what would be shared ? 4495615_4497495
it would be the canine p@l three complex between the chimp and the baboon . 4497655_4501155
but is it so there we had a shared trait but is it permanent or is it derived ? 4502565_4505885
if you compare it to <the outgroup> the outgroup has that shared conditioning condition so it's what you have is a derived trait here but the shared one isn't . 4506005_4515925
the shared trait here having okay wait think about this for a second . 4516285_4520625
if you're just looking at this one the chimp and the baboon share having a canine p@l three . 4520805_4525965
but is that shared feature a primitive feature or a derived feature ? 4526635_4531075
since it's in the primitive outgroup it's a primitive feature . 4531475_4535275
so it's shared primitive . 4535995_4536895
and therefore it would not be used in the outgroup &~anal in the cladistic analysis . 4538055_4542575
so this would be an example of a feature that's shared but not derived . 4543475_4547015
and so this would not be a trait that would be used in the construction of the cladograms . 4547955_4552695
if you look at +... 4553915_4554835
if you look at the next trait we'll get to this actually if you look at the next trait it's another pattern that we have on our molar teeth they're called y@l five molars we have a groove pattern in our teeth that we share with chimpanzees . 4556655_4570255
chimpanzee's first &~mol the molars down here look almost identical to ours . 4570475_4575255
but a baboon doesn't look like ours at all and neither does a lemur . 4575895_4579715
so here what you would have is a shared pattern both yes yes right ? 4580635_4585695
you have a shared feature and then if you compare it to the lemur our outgroup the lemur doesn't have it . 4586415_4592895
so this &~re this would be a feature that we would consider a shared derived feature . 4593435_4596975
so this would be a feature that we would use in our outgroup &~anal that we would use in our cladistic analysis . 4597515_4602555
so what we would do is we would go through all the features which I'll do next time and we'll see which ones are shared and then you look to see if they're shared primitive or shared derived . 4603035_4612195
all the shared derived features you use in the analysis and you look to see which groups of organisms share more shared derived features . 4612535_4620415
and then using that information you construct the most parsimonious cladogram . 4621255_4630075
