the name of this story is twenty years ago .
and it's a story written by O'Henry .
and it's about a guy named Bob and his friend Jimmy_Wells .
when they were young men, Bob was eighteen .
and Jimmy was twenty .
that's when Bob decided that he was going to go west .
and Jimmy did not want to leave New_York_City .
so they had decided that within twenty years time, they would meet
and twenty years has past .
and so Bob is standing in the doorway of a hardware store where the
and as he's standing there, a policeman comes by .
and he sees him standing there .
and so he goes up to him .
and Bob explains why he's there .
and Bob is standing there .
he has a cigar in his mouth .
and he hasn't lighted it yet .
but the police officer is just checking him out .
and he notices that he has a diamond pin stuck, I guess, into his
and after he explains why he's there, the police officer tells him
and he goes on making his rounds of the street .
checking the doors to make sure that the shop doors are locked .
and that nothing's going on .
and before the police officer leaves though he asks Bob if he's
or if he is going to give him a little more time .
and Bob says, well, he's going to give him at least thirty more
and he thinks that he will be there within that time period .
and sure enough, after about twenty minutes of standing there, a
and he asks +"/.
+" is that you Bob ?
and Bob calls back +"/.
+" is that you Jimmy_Wells ?
he says +"/.
+" yes this is me .
+" it's Jimmy_Wells .
and before Jimmy came up to him, Bob had finally had a chance to
so he's standing there .
and he's smoking that .
so they start talking about old times .
and Jimmy asked Bob how were things out West for him .
and he says, they were okay .
and they're still standing in the shadows .
so they really can't see each other very well .
but when Bob looks at Jimmy, he notes that you're much taller than
and so Jimmy tells him that +"/.
+" after I was twenty years old, I did grow a few more inches .
which is possible .
it's possible for people to still grow .
and so he accepts that .
and he says +"/.
+" well let's go someplace .
Jimmy tells Bob +"/.
+" let's go someplace where we can talk about old times .
and get reacquainted .
and as they are walking down the street, they walk out into the
and both of them turn around to glance at each other .
and as they do, Bob notices that Jimmy doesn't have the same shape
so he says you know, it may be possible for a man to grow taller .
but it's not possible for a man to have a different nose than he
and so Jimmy tells him, but it is possible for a good man to turn
and then Jimmy explains to Bob that he's there to arrest him .
and because they saw a poster from Chicago that said that he was
and he gave Bob a note at that time .
told him that he could read that on the way to the station .
and Bob was a little nervous at first .
and he started reading the note .
and the note was from his old friend Jimmy .
because it was true that the guy that had approached him was not
and he said that he had been on time .
and when he saw him strike up the light, the cigar, he noticed that
and since they were so good friends, he could not bring himself to
so he asked another police officer to do it for him .
what I remember most is about the day that Doctor_Martin_Luther
and I was in the sixth grade .
and I only lived three blocks from my school, my elementary school .
and I really didn't know who Doctor_Martin_Luther King was because
we didn't have that back then back in nineteen sixty eight .
there was no one actually telling us who he was .
what he was doing .
so I never saw him on tv .
I didn't even know when he was in town to give his famous speech on
but I do remember that day .
and it was before lunch .
and I can remember my teacher .
my classroom was on .
we had a three story building .
and my classroom was on the third floor .
and I just remember my teacher telling everyone +"/.
+" go home .
+" go straight home .
+" don't stop to play or anything .
it wasn't like they were waiting for parents to come and pick up
but since I lived so close, I could go home .
and my best friend, she was in school with me .
and we came to school everyday .
but I was such an obedient child that when my teacher told me to go
so I ran straight home .
and one of the things that I like to do .
or one of the things that I did then is that I used to sleep a_lot .
and one of the reasons I used to sleep a_lot is because I used to
so I remember going home .
and it was a_lot_of confusion .
but I went home .
and I went to sleep .
and when I woke up, I could smell all this, something in the air .
but I didn't know what it was .
I found out later on when I went outside that it was tear gas
we lived about eight blocks from what's known as H@l street in
and I could smell all this tear gas .
and there were people all in the street .
it was just very chaotic .
and my girlfriend Bernadette, she came over .
actually and woke me up .
and she was like, how can you sleep during all of this ?
with everything that's going on .
and I didn't know what was going on because no one made me aware of
and as I think back on it, it was just a really confusing time .
