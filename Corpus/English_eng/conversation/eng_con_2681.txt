well that one was man's man's relationship to existence in terms of action which relates man's values with other men's values . 46325_56345
so that was like man with man +/. 57465_58725

and then art it was man's relationship &~ship to existence in terms of concretizations which relates man's philosophy to reality . 61885_71425
in the sense that in art you're concretizing your philosophy or basically your subconscious philosophy . 71635_78395

alright I got the easy one actually .

I mean &~i everything is based on it so if you're gonna talk about epistemology you can't talk about it unless you know what your base for that is or for ethics . 191285_203185

yeah I had two &-uh two parts to my idea of this one . 209505_213965
one was I think that yeah I think this is also related to what you're saying . 214535_219475
is that you need to validate &~u or if you want to validate your principles you wanna make sure that the principles the fundamental principles are correct . 219835_231295

I don't think it's he he makes a point in here that it's not &~ob I think it's he thinks it's unclear that you would put it this way if you just knew a principle an isolated principle it's unclear when to use it you know . 242955_256735
and this this is obscure to me . 257475_259055

&-um that's just a rule . 280235_282295
okay that I could learn I &~l basically I can memorize that okay . 282875_287115

⌊ Rob well you know it's possible ⌋ you know it's possible but the only question is whether or not <it can> it can imitate I mean it can imitate human cognition but the question is whether or not it is human cognition . 414765_423065
well it can't even &~imi I mean in practical terms like in reality you know &~w we've tried this method +/. 423485_429285
⌈ it would be really impractical I know ⌉ .
+, ⌊ and it just it doesn't get very far ⌋ . 429425_431445
that's true I . 432045_433085
I I &~b we probably &~could we couldn't even make a widget maker . 433205_436145
a widget maker +/. 436425_436845
+, I mean because the you know the we have robots that can make widgets . 436965_439405
but then obviously the same robots can make widgets can't go home and sleep with his wife or you know whatever &=laughs:multiple you know . 439515_445775
scandalous .
so if all that guy did was do widgets all day long it sure but . 447335_450135
so we can at least agree that that principles make things a hell of lot more efficient and and (be)cause I mean I guess . 450555_457035
yeah but right yeah &~they I know &~yo &~we I mean Peikoff argues a very stronger point +/. 457335_462555
mhm +/.
+, which he says you have to know . 462735_464555

+, mm +/.
+, yeah .
yeah I have a question about that also . 484525_486085
like on page four he says &-um &{l=READING she begins deliberately at the beginning at what she can prove is the beginning and the root of all the rest . 486515_495035
&}l=READING so I mean this is related to this axiom this question it &~s he's saying now here that she can prove this at the beginning +/. 495895_500655
yeah ⌈ she can ⌉ . 500995_501335
+, ⌊ and I ⌋ I'd like to know what that proof is . 501335_502735
the proof is the inescapability of it that is what proves what is an axiom . 503335_508415
I thought that's what I thought &~sh they were making the distinction between validation and proof +/. 508475_512415
yes +/. 512695_513015
+, and +/. 513215_513275
+, ⌈ that's okay ⌉ +/. 513575_513955
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ so why is this a proof ⌈ and not a validation ⌉ ? 513885_514985
⌊ this is the difference ⌋ is a proof you can prove that the axiom or you can prove that the statement I a conscious will no yeah I don't want to put it that way . 515005_527885
well anyway you can prove that the axioms are an axiom by showing their inescapability . 528045_532885
but you cannot prove the truth of the axiom . 533325_536645
the truth of the axiom &~i can only be validated that's the difference . 537665_542645
then alright I &~d I mean . 542905_545845
I know it's a subtle it's +/. 546005_547325
yeah I'm ⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 547465_547865
+, ⌊ it's an ⌋ interesting (0.10) . 547865_548345
so what are the axioms ? 550285_559005
(0.4) .
okay I'll do this one . 560805_563845
okay so existence exists and then now the second &-uh this this next axiom has been stated several different ways like and to me I think this way is the best way I don't know the other ways are xxx okay you exist possessing the ability to be aware of existence . 563895_583395
you think that's the best way to state &=laughs:S4 . 583855_586535
yeah I mean because okay now <this is> this is well he says here okay you exist possessing consciousness . 587455_595635
okay +/.
+, now that's &-um but I've also heard that I think even Ayn Rand said you know the second axiom can just be said &~conscious consciousness is consciousness . 597735_609455
which is ⌈ that one's not &~inf &~i to me that's not informative in any way ⌉ . 609895_617435
&=laughs:S4 .
⌊ consciousness is &~con is conscious I think it ⌋ it's it's consciousness is conscience . 612705_616965
is conscience . 618145_618445
the whole idea of &~c I mean in my personal opinion the whole idea of consciousness isn't informative in any way because the philosophers can do nothing when defining consciousness but saying oh well you know it's that thing that you feel you know that thing I don't know I can't quantify it or qualify it it's just that thing . 618685_633805
so <I don't> I don't think you should rely on the word consciousness to give you any information . 634045_638105
well that's why I rephrased it the way +/. 638385_640025
⌈ <yeah I liked> yeah I liked that better ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ she describes it ability to be aware ⌋ of existence . 640055_643475
+, mhm +/.
+, I mean which is very basic . 643915_644995
I mean it's .
but if consciousness captures that phrase then why not just use the word consciousness ? 646015_649155
(be)cause that has so many other &~qual ⌈ connotations ⌉ . 649255_651255
⌊ people ⌋ yeah . 651495_651855
so does selfishness but +... 652775_654075
&=laughs:S2 .
okay and so the next one was &-uh to be I just said to be a certain something . 654575_663255
okay +/.
+, now &~y you know I mean that is a little bit +//. 665995_669455
&-um <I think> I think it would be appropriate to add that what Leonard Peikoff means <is to be> is to be something particular and very specific . 671315_683455
now I guess you can say that's redundant but to me that is a big point that the it's more focused that he's saying that something is something particular only has one set of characteristics . 684175_697235
you cannot have <it does> it does not have other sets . 697955_701495
okay xxx . 702115_703915
yeah .
I think that adds something <I don't know> . 706015_709755
and then &-uh . 710075_711335
so the physicists are wrong about the wave particle duality right ? 711215_713815
well I know see that's why I would you know it argues against that ⌈ but where ⌉ . 714595_717995
⌊ well not necessarily ⌋ not necessarily . 718155_719235
⌈ yeah ⌉ .
⌊ yeah ⌋ their interpretation of the data is wrong . 720175_724475
how &~s ⌈ what ⌉ . 727215_727895
⌊ what they ⌋ what they're seeing is a fact but <what they> what they're &~in they're interpreting it as a a case where it's a contradiction of the law of identification now that conclusion is wrong . 728055_738275
yeah .
xxx .
&-uh could somebody &~pl &~ex explain that to me ? 742865_743625
&=laughs .
of the wave ? 744505_745225
yeah I don't know what it is . 745325_747145
&=laughs .
&-um you could ⌈ explain it better than I could ⌉ . 747465_749985
⌊ sometimes sometimes like ⌋ fundamental particles have seem to have wavelike properties and sometimes they seem to have particlelike properties +/. 750125_756185
yeah +/.
+, depending on the circumstances . 756545_757405
+, yeah +/.
+, so some people think it's you know that it's both a wave and it's &~bo and and a particle so that's kind_of a ⌈ contradiction but ⌉ . 758305_764965
⌊ oh oh yeah ⌋ okay yeah okay the wave particle duality of nature . 765145_769205
exactly .
yeah .
&=laughs it's a wave and it's a particle when you want it to be . 772475_774455
so that that was the significance of that statement how could you . 777955_780455
well actually I get into more on that later . 780635_782875
because &-uh the thing is <what really> what really bugs me or was bugging me +//. 783675_790635
okay out_of the three axioms the first two <I cannot> I cannot imagine a way that they can be wrong okay ? 790775_798555
&=laughs:multiple I I I don't know my intuitive &~a like I know I say intuitive but my feeling I don't have any repulsion against those two . 799035_804695
&=laughs:multiple but when I come to identity +/. 805195_806535
⌈ you lose ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ that one to me seems much more it's it has much more bite to it it's saying much more . 807115_812995
more substance ? 813855_814255
yeah more substance to the identity axiom . 814475_818235
and so later on in one of these questions I get into one issue <I think> I think I've resolved but I still have feelings of doubt . 818595_826475
and I don't know why but I still have them . 826935_829055
+, so . 829855_829895
I just I was just thinking of it personally but I don't know I just think term mathematically I don't know why . 830275_837055
&=laughs I just think of you know A if you have like something called A and then it's this set of like characteristics . 838075_847395
yeah +/. 847795_847955
+, it hasta be that particular set . 848695_850535
I mean you don't you might not know what it is but it hasta have a particular set of them . 850915_854435
and then if you said it was that but it's also something else I mean you'd be saying like it's not itself I mean you could use like substitution say and you would say A is not equal to A which is absurd . 855455_868075
well I think is this do you think that I would be right in incorporating the water versus h@l two o@l argument in here that you're familiar with . 868975_876215
incorporating it ?
⌈ maybe I don't want to misinterpret the argument fine let me try and just stop me if I xxx ⌉ . 876815_885435
⌊ I I'd &~th I'd interpret <call it up again on> the twin worlds ⌋ you're going to get into twin worlds and stuff ? 879795_883915
no &=laughs okay there's a zombie and he looks like you no .
no like okay this is something . 890495_892215
water is h@l two o@l right this is something that you know +/. 894195_896195
mhm +/.
+, right ?
is it possible it's it's argued that it's possible for water to be something other than h@l two o@l and still be water in your opinion . 897495_905355
so let's say let me describe this further . 906705_909185
you have certain ways of defining things and your way of defining water is the thing that that satisfies this these criteria right and you start listing criteria it's the stuff that flows down the river it's the stuff that's comes out_of my water tap it's the stuff that is in my dog's bowl it's the stuff that I +//. 911225_928785
and that's that's the criteria set for water . 929725_932325
anything that is in that is water . 933125_935545
right and then you have and the notion of h@l two o@l for which you have a different it's &~cr set of criteria they're called specifiers . 936565_945045
and that might be just you know it's &~har hydrogen two oxygen one and so it could be contended that there could be something else in the world or in a ⌈ possible world ⌉ +/. 945985_959505
+, ⌊ in worlds ⌋ &=laughs +/.
+, damn_it yeah I'm doing it aren't I .
that can satisfy those specifiers without it being h@l two o@l that . 959915_963055
XYZ that's what they call it . 963675_965455
yeah . 965635_965835
yeah but &~tha why would &~tha that would definitely I don't think that would be argued against the identity . 966395_971235
that would just say that you &~ha would have to it's just like finding &-uh intelligent life somewhere else that you know rational animal then we would have to just say that humans are +//. 971755_984255

⌊ okay this ⌋ okay this is it okay was for instance if somebody describes God as +/. 1001515_1007795
okay . 1008495_1008595
+, now this is where I &{l=SIC don &}l=SIC not have do not have a problem with the identity . 1008815_1012095
axiom at all I don't have any feelings at all negative about it . 1013625_1016845
&-uh is when they say okay God is not this <God is not that> God is not that you really cannot be &~quan God's not anything in any terms I can explain to you . 1017305_1027445
&=laughs:multiple to me that seems clear that when you somebody says he can only give me nots@q negatives that he's gonna have no characteristics . 1027925_1034385
therefore he cannot exist . 1035165_1036525
okay to me that seems clear . 1037645_1038745
well God has characteristics who says ⌈ I mean you know omnipotent xxx ⌉ . 1039665_1042205
⌊ yeah okay I just ⌋ I know but the I prefaced it somebody somebody told me that . 1042265_1045825
now I think that some people &~r yeah say omnipotent that he can +/. 1046285_1049625
perfect +/. 1049985_1050125
+, that he's good yeah I mean +/. 1050305_1051885
+, ⌈ well ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ there ⌋ is a characteristic but ⌈ to me ⌉ . 1052685_1054685
⌊ could it be contended ⌋ that like not I I would say that not being something is also a characteristic but you you don't agree with that ? 1054685_1061525
right +/. 1061645_1061865
+, I don't want to get into this (be)cause I know you have somewhere else to go with this but . 1061985_1064965
yeah ⌈ well okay ⌉ . 1065265_1066265
⌊ yeah yeah so &~wh ⌋ yeah where are you ⌈ going with that ⌉ ? 1066425_1069065
⌊ but if somebody ⌋ just said that you know if they never gave a positive characteristic I mean they only gave &~ne what it &~wa was not it would not exist . 1067345_1078225
okay I think that's <if it> if it has no characteristics I can see that it does not exist . 1079065_1085105
relate this to the identity axiom for us I . 1085745_1087985
okay the identity axiom is to be is to be is to basically to be is to be is to have a sum of attributes and characteristics . 1088795_1100995
that's what identity is . 1102255_1103715
okay . 1104295_1104455
so you're saying everything that doesn't have a set of attributes and characteristics does not therefore exist ? 1104455_1108995
that's the &~as yeah that's the assumption behind that axiom yeah now . 1109095_1113955
but in that case you said you were okay with it . 1114395_1115955
I was okay with that . 1116215_1116935
⌈ so where's the case where you ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ now this is the one I'm ⌋ not okay right . 1117155_1118595
is when when somebody says you know what <this thing> this thing is +... 1119215_1126535
is &-uh they give positive they give in fact two positive identities to the thing . 1129675_1134955
for instance like the wave and +/. 1135095_1137155
+, mhm +/.
+, the matter one . 1137955_1138555
but then they &~s you know so they are giving positive identities . 1139595_1143255
they're always saying yes this has these attributes . 1143295_1145375
but it has two sets of attributes . 1146335_1147775
now okay just recently you know I thought well then one if you're saying that it only has this sets of attributes and then you saying at the same time it only has this sets of attributes they cancel out each_other so they essentially have no attributes . 1148855_1163035
I &~underst .
why do they ⌈ cancel ⌉ +/. 1164015_1164895
⌊ so they ⌋ +/.
+, cancel out ? 1165515_1165815
because okay for instance if I say that this table is red and black at the same time that's essentially saying that it's red and non red at the same time . 1165825_1178425
so then I can see how it cancels out so I don't know I mean that's where I'm at now I guess . 1179345_1183145
okay ⌈ okay ⌉ +/. 1185245_1185545
⌊ see ⌋ +/.
+, so this comes back to the axiom because you're like I'm I'm assigning it a &~c a characteristic A I'm also assigning it a characteristic not A . 1186515_1196955
my +/. 1198095_1198255
+, ⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ intuitive notion ⌋ of that is that it therefore has neither properties . 1198735_1201875
but this axiom is saying that it still exists like because it has two properties ? 1202595_1206395
no no it's saying it doesn't exist . 1206855_1208295
oh okay . 1208455_1208675
+, but I was just I was having a problem thinking like you know if somebody did say that like the wave thing and the one I can't see both I can I felt like I could call that something . 1208715_1219195
you know I could call that something . 1220515_1221955
that something could exist without being a particular one thing . 1222855_1227655
+, oh +/. 1228035_1228075
+, you see that's why I was having trouble . 1228555_1229835
<I was> I was thinking it could be a particular two things . 1230455_1232775
but then recently I've just been thinking that I think if you say that something's a particular two things at the same time both they &~canc they essentially cancel each_other out . 1233195_1243015
in term of characteristics where you don't you're back to having no characteristics . 1243695_1247655
so this problem only applies to like particle waves &=laughs:SUm and like maybe mind body and ⌈ that's it right ⌉ ? 1247735_1252535
⌊ well ⌋ but if if it if we can find one exception ⌈ then it's ⌉ . 1252735_1255355
⌊ right I'm ⌋ just &~a but those are the only two ⌈ that that applies to ⌉ . 1255355_1257695
⌊ I'd be interested in ⌋ I &~hav (be)cause I'm the one who hasn't read the actual chapter yet . 1257695_1260795
so I'm I'm I'd be interested to &~h hear the exact wording like what <does she> does she say or does Peikoff say &-uh particular and specific thing that is it to say to is to be something . 1260765_1272085
no ⌈ in the beginning he says ⌉ . 1272705_1273905
⌊ he says it's to be ⌋ something . 1273985_1274305
yeah in the beginning he says to be something . 1274785_1276425
but then you'll see like &-uh in the causality chapter when he refers to identity he does say you know to &~b to be is essentially to be something specific . 1276825_1289545
does he incorporate a different an an additional argument with that or no ? 1291265_1294485
well actually later on now this is &~a related to infinity . 1295225_1299465
now he says infinity cannot exist because of the identity principle . 1300965_1308825
okay ? 1309505_1309565
and this is basically on this . 1309685_1310985
it's gonna come back to it always comes back to if it's something is &-uh breaking the identity principle it comes back to saying the key is that it does not have any characteristics . 1311845_1322925
so how does infinity have no characteristics ? 1323565_1326505
how does Peikoff say it ? 1326965_1328365
what he says is that infinity says what that's really saying is that you're always large +... 1328425_1337845
something &~i something that is infinitely large &~mean does not mean that it's just very large . 1338865_1346305
what it means is it's &~w it is &-uh it's &=laughs basically &~na not a specific largeness . 1346765_1355445
there's no there is no specific largeness to it . 1355435_1358475
so essentially it has no you know +/. 1358835_1363455
identity +/. 1363955_1364035
+, no identity (be)cause there is no specific value . 1364415_1366755
so ⌈ that's ⌉ . 1368215_1370495
⌊ but it's ⌋ still large . 1370495_1371415
no because he says that there is no there is no you know thing . 1372295_1379955
can it how can +//.
can it be infinite I mean it's not a number it's just a constant . 1383435_1386615
&=laughs ⌈ I mean ⌉ .
⌊ okay in semantics ⌋ you would analyze the phrase +/. 1387815_1389915

+, oh okay +/. 1401875_1402355

⌊ exactly it's ⌋ small or large . 1423495_1425375
here <let me just> &-uh let me just do say that +... 1426235_1430835
so I was that's where I started having a problem when he tried to deny infinity you see . 1432775_1438555
⌈ because infinity ⌉ . 1438915_1440015
⌊ I thought that was ⌋ a perfectly good &=laughs:S4 denial of infinity . 1440015_1441935
it is +/. 1442375_1442715
yeah +/.
+, but I had the feelings of doubt that's all I'm saying and now I I mean I do understand though that it has no essentially you know when you don't have a specific value it has no value +/. 1443115_1453015
+, right +/. 1453355_1453415
+, that's all . 1453595_1453835
and also like what he &~s Steve said &~earl Steve right ? 1453915_1456015
yeah .
what he said earlier about a wave particle duality you can it's you can just say well &~i in one context if you just take context into it then one context +/. 1456215_1463075
mhm +/.

+, and that's ⌈ fine yeah ⌉ . 1464915_1467135
+, ⌊ it has ⌋ wave properties but in all it has you know all of these properties in specific context just like anything has properties in a specific context and I don't think that's a problem either . 1465345_1475845
and +/.
+, no +/.
+, so if that's the only only one that's a problem . 1477785_1480585
yeah but he doesn't say you know Peikoff doesn't say something is something if it's something once in a while or most of the time or xxx . 1481005_1492425
⌈ no &~i it ⌉ .
⌊ no but ⌋ the law of identity does state that it it hasta be it can't be A and non a@l in the same at the same time in the same respect +/. 1487735_1496995
right +/. 1497675_1497695
+, and in the same context . 1497955_1498915
but &~i right &~i it the the thing about the law of identity is it does not exclude change . 1499335_1505135
I mean change is perfectly fine but I mean which is +/. 1505695_1508515

(be)cause that's &-um that's that's an entity changing . 1511155_1514375
so so okay let's move on now . 1518105_1521325
hm .
we're in the second part of number three I think . 1521325_1522845

⌊ oh ⌋ I wouldn't <I would> I would say that ideas and dreams and feelings exist because we assign them characteristics . 1556625_1563785

yeah . 1566645_1568105
but you &~lo you said things that exist +//. 1569365_1571565
do things that exist exist ? 1571765_1572665
so you loaded the question so there's haven't you so that yeah it hasta be yes <they are> . 1573145_1580325
yeah okay basically ⌈ now ⌉ . 1581045_1584425
⌊ you're asking ⌋ &~da do things that exist exist I mean &=laughs:multiple right that's what the question says . 1582095_1585855
⌈ yeah ⌉ .
⌊ he's asking ⌋ <is he> &~j is he when he talks about existence does he just mean physical ⌈ existence or ⌉ +/. 1586075_1590855

⌈ can you xxx ⌉ .
⌊ it's &~j ⌋ that one's just existence exists . 1599675_1601955
so it's &~ju all it's saying <is that> is that &-uh everything that exists exists . 1602395_1608375
that's all it's &=laughs:multiple it's saying that you know &~dr your dreams that you're aware of exist . 1608625_1614485

so it's &~m &~jus it is definitely more than just physical world and that's all I wanted for that question so . 1625505_1631305
and now I originally answered that (be)cause I got confused I thought you were . 1631305_1638485

okay is that it's self-evident is what proof is based on . 1710305_1713345

oh the next part of &-uh yadda@i yadda@i what exactly is consciousness ? 1901515_1905995
you want me to take that one . 1906355_1907195

⌊ philosophic answers not the ⌋ .
⌈ don't give you the right answer give ⌉ you the Ayn Rand answer ? 1909975_1911955
is that .
yeah just according to what ⌊ Leonard Peikoff is saying unless you ⌋ . 1912195_1915815
⌈ yeah right ⌉ &=laughs:S4 so &-um consciousness is the faculty that the faculty of perception the faculty that perceives that which exists . 1915495_1927835
well not &~sp okay in here he uses perception . 1929215_1932655
okay but then he &~quantifi he qualifies it with &~m that he really means awareness . 1933235_1939375
which is funny okay but anyway . 1940295_1942655
fine . 1943435_1943495
that's all okay because there are forms that they &~don &~p there are animals supposedly that don't perceive but are aware and they have consciousness . 1944315_1954435
animals ? 1954695_1955195
I suppose that's what I that's why I'm thinking . 1955935_1957895
do you mean like amoeba ? 1957955_1958775

I read Dennett today and I drew a picture of him as Superman &=laughs defender &=laughs:S3 of truth and sorry . 1981145_1988025
so &~sh so Peikoff uses the word awareness as opposed to perception ? 1989265_1995365

you're calling feeling a process ? 2058945_2060345

⌈ yeah ⌉ I guess I'm thinking emotion . 2065965_2067405
okay so you're wondering if if emotion is a &~ne necessitates consciousness ? 2067745_2073545
is it a means of consciousness . 2073565_2075825
&=laughs:S4 is it a means of our awareness of existence ? 2076685_2080405
what do &~y a means ? 2080425_2081305
emotions ? 2081785_2083265
is it a way in which we would we express our awareness ⌊ xxx ⌋ ? 2083685_2085805
no &~i <is it> is it a thing that we use to become aware of existence to gain knowledge of existence . 2086045_2098225

emotions is that what you're asking +/. 2101305_2102865
yeah +/.
+, are emotions ? 2103225_2103605
now I mean I thought about this all day and I think I've come up with an answer . 2104265_2107705
I it seems to me that &~w . 2108445_2112265
now see thinking it's clear you know that's a way we become you know we we come to conclusions to know you know existence . 2112475_2120935
but how about for you ? 2122475_2123675
well first you have to say what's an emotion ? 2124335_2126435
wait I'm I'm still not it's confused to me because does so obviously Ayn says that it's possible to to +... 2128715_2135635
&=sigh:S4 some people argue that we have virtually no access to our conscious experience . 2138475_2142215

I'm just ⌈ saying that ⌉ +/. 2147095_2147955

you see ? 2171355_2171735
+, mhm +/.
+, and so you know sensations percepts perception thinking and I think feeling is a product of awareness . 2171995_2181615
I think you feel after you see a perception . 2181915_2184675
&~supposi according to Ayn Rand now this is I really am not a psychologist but &~i or you know but according to her you get an emotion after you become aware of an object and you relate it subconsciously to a value judgment . 2185825_2200485
⌊ you see ⌋ .
⌈ yeah <that's not> ⌉ necessarily hafta be an external object though it could be an ⌊ internal symbol ⌋ . 2201125_2204505
⌈ you're right ⌉ it could be a memory . 2204505_2205125
but at see so I don't think it's involved in your ability to be aware I think it's a product of your awareness . 2206085_2213165
I think you feel once you've become aware of them . 2218955_2220915
well the way you described it <you said> you said Ayn says that you assign a truth value to something once you perceive it ? 2223795_2232195

could be a &~mem within an object you're thinking about or reminiscing about or actually seeing . 2248005_2254485
and is this this value judgment is what you're referring to as emotion ? 2255365_2258345
no .
no okay . 2258845_2260305
okay you have an object let's say this book . 2260445_2262645
mhm +/.
+, you know this OPAR . 2263605_2267485
I see the book now supposedly according to the theory &-uh Ayn Rand's theory is that very quickly you can have emotion &~ver we have emotions very quickly +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, without knowing what the process is going on . 2276295_2277835
+, mhm +/.
+, but she &~st dissects it and she thinks that you see the book your subconscious you have a &~subconsciou I have a subconscious value judgment about objectivism in this book I have like for instance I think this book is of some value . 2278105_2294305
so I get a positive feeling . 2294965_2297025
and &~th that's how she explains emotion . 2298925_2300365
okay .
so .
and if you saw it burning you would be sad well &=laughs:multiple . 2302525_2306405
you know and when I read the parts about &-uh volition I have a different emotion . 2309055_2312795
&=laughs:multiple .
there you go yeah . 2313055_2313995
&=laughs:S4 .
(be)cause you have a different value judgment consciousness ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 2314675_2319095
⌊ so that's your theory ⌋ ? 2319295_2320075
that's not &~real oh well my theory about the feeling &~i in regards to consciousness is I think it's a product of consciousness . 2320895_2327035
I think that's a good theory . 2327295_2328175
and I don't know I'm gonna see if if we go on when we get into emotions if that holds out . 2328715_2332975
&-um .
okay a well if if we're gonna see if that holds out or not then I need to know what do you mean by a product of consciousness ? 2333715_2340555
do you mean a result of ? 2340635_2341615
what are the ⌈ &~tr truth conditions for this ⌉ . 2341635_2343275
⌊ yes it's a result ⌋ +/.

so &~wha that would be wrong how ? 2366885_2368985
like what &~wou how could that be wrong ? 2369385_2371605
if I said that you could experience emotions without a cognitive experience that <might be> . 2372025_2379905

⌊ oh this ⌋ is it as opposed to right as opposed to now there's times . 2384215_2388295
now I may just make things less clear all of a sudden because there's times that I'll get an emotion . 2389275_2394295
I'll think for instance easily when I'm in &~k like reading this . 2395275_2398795
and I go across the identity axiom I get an emotion a &~s this quasisick kind of . 2399055_2405055
and you know &=laughs:S3 it's not that bad . 2405195_2406895
but you get this emotion &=laughs:S4 that you don't really understand something . 2407075_2410655
do you know what I mean ? 2411355_2411795
&-uh huh +/.

as &-uh and I think I could think of it as something helping me become aware that I'm not it's giving me some knowledge &~informa it's giving me information my feeling you see ? 2421085_2439045

⌊ you haven't answered ⌋ my question have you or have you ? 2440685_2442425

it's a tool it's a way of gaining knowledge about reality but &-uh apparently not . 2447055_2455275

that's that's exactly why you cannot maybe when they &~s she says it's not a tool of cognition &{l=SIC baby &}l=SIC maybe a more precise way to say that is you cannot use it as an &~excl only exclusively that . 2498025_2511505
but I think it could be termed a an aid a help I don't know . 2512325_2517685
well &-uh in a bigger picture knowing Ayn's feelings towards emotion I don't know I I find it I don't know if she would approve of of us saying that &=laughs xxx &=laughs:S1 sound like xxx okay I don't know if she would approve of us saying that emotions contribute to cognition which is basically what you're saying ? 2517795_2543035

what's that again ?

ah .
so I think we'd better define it as ability <I I don't know> . 2831295_2837055

⌊ okay ⌋ right I I said that there . 3113745_3115145
so let's go back to irreducibles can't be broken down . 3115725_3118405
can't be further simplified right ? 3119085_3120705
right yeah .

alright self-evident is self-evident what's that is that something how do you &~expl &=laughs:S4 how do you put that into different terms ? 3132295_3141755
&=laughs:S1 .
the evidence for something is contained within itself . 3142255_3144775
good .
&=laughs &=laughs:SUm &-um . 3145735_3147535
and then went to <work on his paper> .
okay so yeah the self-evident was &-uh (0.5) well okay let me go to irreducible . 3154375_3164555
okay so primary now this isn't &~i this may not be right but this is what I was thinking about okay . 3166395_3173395
primary focuses on +... 3173835_3175115
&-um when I looked it up it was either first in regard to timing or it was first in regard to rank or importance . 3177815_3188015
first and foremost ⌈ yeah ⌉ . 3188235_3189295
⌊ okay ⌋ ? 3189315_3189575
now that makes sense with the axioms because first in regards to timing her argument is that as a child develops he &~gra &-uh &~in this is the implicit knowledge he grasps these axioms implicitly first . 3190015_3210055
if you're &~tal talking about time in terms of axioms though why not say that it's the axioms that's where you have to the starting point . 3210675_3216155
or ⌈ you can do ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ wouldn't that be ⌋ a better one ? 3216435_3217395
you can do that . 3217625_3218205
&-um and then also if if you take the primary to mean &-uh first in importance I would think that just makes sense since in terms of validating you know and that it would be the most important to validate this one first before all the others . 3219565_3247265
and then &-uh fundamental I thought that stresses okay fundamental inescapable and irreducible I thought all focus on epistemology okay in the sense of knowledge okay .
now fundamental I thought was it's saying that a_lot_of &~th okay the definition of fundamental was that upon which everything else in a given context depends . 3254865_3268205
so when I think of that <I think> I think &~o of a of just a a tree okay in my mind . 3269385_3273925
in that there is like all these other logical dependencies to these other principles coming from this base . 3274385_3282425
now inescapable to me says that all knowledge depends on it . 3283275_3293175
so this to me lowers basically it's saying it's that it is the root of all branches of everything it is at the root . 3293595_3302715
you know because &-uh fundamental is saying that it's the root within a certain context . 3304195_3309435
now inescapability is saying it is the root in all contexts of knowledge . 3309985_3315565
I don't know I thought that . 3317205_3317865
okay +/.
+, ⌈ and then ⌉ . 3318585_3319185
⌊ maybe ⌋ do you mind if I interrupt ? 3319605_3321245
sure . 3321365_3321585
another illustration just briefly fundamental is &-um the Protestant church often uses the example of the cornerstone I don't know if any of you have ever heard of a cornerstone . 3321945_3330025
like back in Jesus' days or whenever &-uh they they built stones and there was one primary stone that like took most of the brunt apparently I don't know how that works geometrically but and they referred to it as the cornerstone . 3330835_3343355
so Christ is always the cornerstone of the Protestant religion . 3343495_3345555
I just thought that might xxx anyway I'm sorry continue .
<and then> &-uh and then when I thought about irreducible was that there is no basically my tree thing will fall &~dow okay my tree analogy would totally fall down here because I'm saying that there's nothing that comes before it there's no knowledge that it depends on . 3352635_3372915
so I was in a sense it'd be like a tree without roots . 3374175_3376895
but I &=laughs don't know ⌈ <instead of> ⌉ . 3378475_3380895
⌊ or without ⌋ ground .
what +/.
⌈ is that what you mean ⌉ ? 3380895_3382495
+, ⌊ without ⌋ yeah exactly . 3382435_3386555
and &-uh self-evidence stresses validation of the axioms <so the> and that's all . 3386555_3395475
so why do you think it's so &-um important to make these teeny tiny tiny little distinctions ? 3395475_3399435
&-uh yeah I ⌈ don't know maybe not ⌉ . 3399815_3403215

but why use irreducible and fundamental and primary ? 3415275_3422095
I'm not sure . 3422435_3425275
are we saying why use precise language is that your conflict &=laughs . 3426795_3429635

mhm +/.

&-um primary you're just focusing on this is important that's all you're saying this is the first thing we should look at . 3454425_3461285
I think that's important to say . 3461845_3462945
and then &-uh fundamental is the reason why it's important okay ? 3463445_3468005
now inescapable is what proof it proves it's an axiom . 3468595_3474575
okay it's at the base of all knowledge . 3475595_3476935
and then irreducible is important in the it is important in a context of what is an axiomatic ⌊ concept ⌋ . 3477675_3485495
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ .
+, which we didn't get to that's where &~sh they bring up irreducible . 3485935_3488215
because &-um an axiomatic concept is what's the difference (0.6) why is an axiomatic concept important though that's my next question I don't know . 3488965_3505545
that's not your next question that's number seven . 3505925_3507565
no I know but no that's just what I'm thinking about &=laughs:multiple you about importance you know ? 3507685_3511565

I don't know ⌊ anyway ⌋ . 3512025_3516125
⌈ if ⌉ &~w &~w so are we we're distinguishing obviously judging from number seven the difference between an axiomatic concept and an axiom . 3517885_3523765
right . 3524005_3524985
I have no idea .
well one thing is that axioms are propositions and axiomatic concepts are just concepts so that's one distinction . 3525865_3536205
so <an axiomated> an axiomatic concept may not &~m may not have an an &~axi axiom as a referent ? 3538025_3547865

do we all know ? 4107915_4108655
yeah like for instance how about when the physics the physicists say +/. 4108755_4113115
you know +/.
+, that no this &-uh this thing can be a wave and a particle . 4113665_4119445
now how are they how are they using identity ? 4120745_4126405
because in order for them to say it's a wave they have to say it's something and that's that it's a wave so that's using the identity and the same thing in order for them to say it's a particle they have to +... 4128715_4142155
they have to say it is something that it is a particle and it has the sets the properties that the particle set . 4144895_4151295
the same thing for waves so they have to use in_order_to make that statement they have to use the identity axiom . 4151835_4177735
mm yeah .
+, (0.6) and they also have to use the consciousness axiom (be)cause they have to say whatever they say is implicitly &~exp like proceeded by I think that or whatever so &~con &~con &~n that &~k that's necessarity and then existence is kind_of they have to use that axiom too .
(0.18) .
okay do you you want to move on to the next one ? 4199765_4201865
sure &-uh &{l=READING is the fact that the axiom's self-evident in any way weaker than the inductive or deductive proof ? 4202625_4212785
&}l=READING oh I this is we we talked about this before like &-um you can prove something but that's not as cool as &=laughs:SUm as it being self-evident . 4213465_4229745
yeah +/.

&-uh I can't articulate it any better than that .
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ well I think it's ⌋ the the basis of proof even and that's why it's better . 4236605_4241625

yeah I mean when you prove things like I observe that it's consciousness existence and identity all together I mean . 4242485_4266465
<I know> &=laughs:S5 .
yeah so self-evident xxx .
so then that's the &~s the second one he said what's a relationship it's the basis perceptual data's basis for proof . 4266615_4279575

I really thought it was cool but I don't know . 4302835_4305015
the same example . 4305295_4305875
well should we start off with one of your examples ⌈ then ⌉ ? 4306415_4309115
⌊ okay ⌋ existence it reminds you that whatever you're talking about exists . 4309355_4316335
now here's an example is that &-uh I may have a skin mark that looks like what &~m I is my limited knowledge of what might be like skin cancer . 4317425_4329545
but you know I I think that it's authentic &~p &-uh you might be even at first be tempted to &~p just try not to think about it . 4330705_4338505
because you know psychologically there's you know that if you go through &~chem that if &~y if it ends up being that <you know> you have to go through chemotherapy all this so I think there's at least for me if I ever notice anything healthwise that might be questionable I'm always kind_of like it takes an effort to own up . 4339625_4359085
you know and say you know what this might be something serious I'd better just get it checked out . 4359645_4364025
so in that sense you have to see that you have to say to &~your in a sense this axiom could remind you that you know this exists that's all simple as that . 4364745_4376645
I don't know .
hm +/.

oh jeez .
this one I had trouble with . 4388945_4389885
&=laughs:multiple .

it's awareness &=laughs:S3 (0.7) . 4402485_4402985
and then when would it be helpful &-uh for you to know that you have the ability to be aware can you think of any examples xxx ? 4404165_4421185
when you face danger when you need to solve a problem ? 4425695_4431255

&-um you know I think there would be a &~s some temptation I would feel some temptation to think you know what ? 4501985_4510365
perhaps you know you really can't be sure or you can't &-uh you cannot come to be certain of something . 4510885_4520705
you know for instance that this pill is lethal maybe maybe knowledge is you know can always be questioned so I could look at this and say you know what this is evidence but you know who could be sure . 4521585_4533025
and then I could say well then I could just hold my promotion you know this job &~a this great job I supposedly just got . 4533445_4539485

yeah here's here's what okay when I thought of it I thought the axioms are good for two things the way I looked at it . 4610225_4615685
was one they're the basis for other principles that seem more directly useful . 4616045_4622585

I can't remember the answer they gave me it was so long ago . 5113415_5116055

you could definitely have &~impl you can have unconscious &-um memory I mean . 5121175_5128135
that's what priming priming studies were based on ⌈ basis of priming studies . 5128135_5131335

⌊ yeah I was gonna say psychology uses explicit and implicit ⌋ .
+, knowledge necessarily but it's represented in your brain a very similar way to knowledge . 5135135_5151155
<yeah that's right> .
well with the I I'm pretty sure what she meant it was or he meant he means is that and I could there's a section here but &-um is that implicit that (0.8) okay what I okay what doesn't mean that knowledge of the axioms is implicit in any act of cognition . 5141005_5170985
to me that means all acts in which you gain knowledge +... 5174025_5177525
can be used as data okay for you to come to the conclusion of axioms . 5179365_5188185
so what it means is that you have knowledge of particulars basically of particular times that you were aware of something (0.4) and in the in in and it's &~impli in &~i &-um those particulars imply if you looked at them they imply the axioms . 5189865_5213245
so that's all . 5214085_5215925
I think <it's just> it's just saying that you have the data available implicit knowledge is such that you have the specific concretes on which you can explicitly form the concept existence form the concept consciousness or identity . 5216055_5231555
so it's almost as if implicit knowledge is like units that's all . 5232995_5237115

you could take implicit knowledge to mean like as if we have some kind of &-um some way of gaining knowledge without thinking . 5263915_5275035
I don't know . 5276855_5277235

+, it means that you you you do hafta think to get these particular instances you know like that you have the data the memory of this stuff there ready for you to actually make the connection . 5281315_5296155
here's what I think it means . 5297255_5298055
&{l=READING knowledge of the axioms are implicit in an act of cognition &}l=READING I think it means that in any act of cognition you necessarily it depends on these axioms +/. 5299275_5308595
mhm +/.
+, so if the axioms were any of these axioms were false then you couldn't have any good cognition so that's what it means by them meaning implicit in the act of cognition . 5308595_5317335
yeah I feel as though they're saying okay I just didn't randomly pick these like these are what actually these are what your cognition actually depends on xxx . 5317495_5325155
yeah you know I think you're right about this what actually what I wrote here but actually she does talk about implicit knowledge or something later on and that's maybe where this is what my answer does not connect with this question though I think your answer's better . 5330195_5350455
I &~th mean <it sorta> means that +... 5350875_5354115

&=laughs:S4 .
⌊ or the kid first hasta know that there's an existence ⌋ .

well no ⌈ &~inden ⌉ . 5439165_5439405
⌊ the consciousness is ⌋ last I think . 5439525_5440965

+, ⌊ they go through causal sequences ⌋ of closing your eyes and seeing that there's an external world and there's an internal world . 5453305_5459285
so how do you reconcile this with like I mean doesn't she say that &-uh the existence and the identity are just two different ways of saying two different perspectives on one thing ? 5459825_5467425
so that how could you have how could you hafta have one before the other if that's the case ? 5468045_5472165
like how could a child implicitly have know the existence axiom before +/. 5472805_5479425
⌈ that's a ⌉ +/.

okay ?

yeah if it was changing its odor it needed to be molding or something <like and ⌊ that's changing> ⌋ . 6056485_6060605

so whatever that's worth I'm not sure what the relevance is but but that's what it is . 6095645_6101705
hey Rob why don't you take this one . 6103325_6105205
&{l=READING how if it how if at all is the statement the same entity under the same &}l=READING oh_my_god &{l=READING the same circumstances will perform the same action on &~to consistent with volition . 6107825_6116945

⌊ they're both right ⌋ ?

well a so I would say &~h a human brain in a certain state &-um <is gonna> is gonna give rise to &~an another state . 6142745_6155265
you know for example ultimately motor you know something motor . 6156205_6160385
and it's you put that brain in the same state and it's gonna do the same exact thing resulting in the same motor neuron activity and resulting in the same movement . 6161175_6171235
again so how's it consistent with volition ? 6171635_6174775
well +/.

&=laughs well okay . 6183435_6184035
⌊ objectivism put it in objectivist terms ⌋ .
⌈ I'll tell you no I'll tell you the right answer . 6184395_6185695
so the reason ⌉ it's consistent with volition is because volition does not imply primacy of consciousness what volition is in real terms is it's soft determinism which is we we can make we make choices that's true but the choices don't contradict reality . 6186095_6205495
so that's how it's consistent with volition we make choices but &-um the choices we make can't ⌊ can't create this a new timeline of xxx ⌋ . 6205895_6217675
⌈ well no okay put it this way ⌉ .
⌊ the same entity can make different ⌋ circumstances . 6217895_6218915
no here's the thing is &-uh I mean this is just this is not consistent with &-uh volition as ⌈ objectivists see volition ⌉ . 6219355_6232275
⌊ right so when a &~pr right so objectivists say ⌋ volition is is a a a choice could have been otherwise . 6228005_6234345

even in the same circumstances +/. 6236705_6238065

⌈ okay ⌉ .

⌊ so the way they try to ⌋ get around it is they say entities act according to their nature the nature of a consciousness is to &~b human consciousness is to be volitional so therefore . 6302705_6311385
mhm he hasta make a choice you could say that . 6311665_6314385
a man under the same circumstances would have to make a choice but that's not really what <this is saying> this is saying that we have to perform or do more than just make a choice you'd hafta act on a certain xxx . 6316165_6328065
⌈ well ⌉ .

⌊ yeah ⌋ . 6330665_6330725
I so &~w what does objectivism say about volition it says that every every every individual has &-uh volition ? 6331465_6346145
is that what .
humans ⌈ have volition ⌉ .
⌊ so ⌋ .
⌈ the ability ⌉ to do otherwise in the ⌊ whole situation ⌋ . 6342065_6345705
⌈ so I think ⌉ I mean I I I would disagree . 6345705_6351005
I don't know if I'm disagreeing but let's see . 6351865_6353825
I would say that &-um (0.6) we've never xxx I think maybe circumstances I'm interpreting circumstances differently like (0.5) &~i &~i if okay . 6354285_6373045
let's say I have a choice of whether to do A or B and A has certain ramifications and B has certain +//. 6373625_6384165
A has positive ramifications and B has negative ramifications right now and I can choose either A or B .
but I'm going to chose A because it has only positive ramifications and my other choice has only negative ramifications right ? 6385055_6390715
so that's volition . 6391295_6392975
that's my choosing to to choose A or my ability to choose A . 6393915_6397975
now in order for someone to be under the exact same circumstances they would as a rational human being also choose A . 6398595_6405775
does that mean that ⌊ xxx ⌋ . 6406575_6407155
⌈ yeah but rational ⌉ . 6407305_6407545

⌈ well the exact same circumstance would be to have ⌉ your brain in the exact same +/. 6410705_6413865

⌈ exactly ⌉ that's yeah that's what I meant . 6417185_6419285

+, &~th they basically take man they wanna be scientific and say man is part of nature and all this but then it just their volition view . 6440185_6448025
I think the discrepancy is that you said man has the ability to chose an irrational position . 6448865_6453485
this statement is not denying it says will perform the same action . 6454205_6457085
it doesn't say can perform a different action . 6458065_6460725

does does the fact that man has volition does that go against the law of causality ? 6865395_6871615
now see the thing is the law of causality is that entities act in accordance with their identity you see . 6872705_6878385
and &-uh and humans choose according because they have volition . 6879205_6885185
that's part of their identity . 6885785_6886825
ah +/.
+, so it doesn't go against the &~l the law of causality as they present it but it does go against volition goes against this one saying that's in here . 6887945_6897825
which is not the law of causality you see . 6898255_6901615
but it is it's just another part I think he's talking about cause and effect . 6901995_6907415
so .
yeah but I mean (0.4) it's the same entity in the same circumstance doesn't perform the same action all the time . 6908495_6920875
it may have two contradictory identities . 6922435_6925855

+, to identity my claim was earlier what I said was identity was that if you have two identities you're not gonna have any identity right ? 7140025_7151805
so in the &~c does this happen here where you have basically two options of characteristics namely two different actions of a person . 7152145_7166025
does that mean that therefore he has no characteristics ? 7168005_7170925
(0.6) .
is it <I think it's> &~pa I think it's the same as saying like if you start your argument with in logic P and not P then you can prove just using the laws of logic if if you start with a contradiction you can prove anything you want . 7177525_7188985
so it if you start with . 7189665_7191025
⌊ yeah but you can't run into the xxx axiom <uttering a> contradiction ⌋ .
⌈ yeah but if you start with something that's a counterexample to the ⌉ <I think> I think what lies in here is that you're saying P and not P right ? 7191185_7198225
and so you're saying well then it's not P or then you're saying well that's a contradiction but okay . 7198945_7204645
I think that &-uh just because the characteristics cancel themselves out or contradict themselves it doesn't mean that there's no characteristics but because the fact that there are characteristics is a necessity for there being a contradiction . 7207165_7221945
(0.4) is that not true ? 7223485_7227605
if there was one less if there was one less &-um what's the word one less if there was one less characteristic then it wouldn't be a contradiction . 7229315_7240635
