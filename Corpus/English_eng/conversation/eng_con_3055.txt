this is our fourth one on my last four square . 73030_76030
oh okay . 76630_77030
that's because I've been doing this . 77320_78560
he's been talking a lot . 79670_80520
yeah . 81220_81300
so you guys made <the same> the same design . 83290_85740
yeah . 85980_86140
but Teddy just had to change &-um this . 86960_89660
so now I have to do another one and glue it on . 90380_93900
can I . 96290_96500
just see what did . 96520_97140
what did . 97280_97510
Teddy change . 97600_98140
I don't . 98450_98630
understand it was like this . 98680_100110
uhhuh . 100570_100670
because I copied it how it was . 101150_102820
yeah . 103180_103300
but he . 103970_104140
thought . 104160_104540
but Teddy says . 104860_105650
<it was> it was &-um like this . 105830_108260
yeah . 108940_109000
he says it was it's like this . 111400_112940
so now I have to change the completely . 113020_115270
well he's got the . 116350_117510
what does he have . 117870_118430
he here's Core square . 118690_119940
here . 120170_120300
what did he do to get to this square . 120820_122100
he &-um he must have only done this one . 123180_125470
he must have only done like that . 125800_127380
well he is . 127400_127670
that . 127720_127970
then then he asked to change . 128150_129590
then he must have changed his mind . 130300_132220
&-um he had to change his mind to do what he was doing because it
&-um it was like this . 138500_140510
it was like that . 140940_141550
that's the way you copied it . 141820_143260
and then he . 144010_144340
now I . 145900_146080
well you guys need to agree . 146680_147740
do you guys need to agree on what what you do . 147940_150580
yeah . 151260_151430
but now I have to change it completely because Teddy says it was
what would you have to change . 159070_160060
it wasn't Teddy I the whole . 160500_161600
how_about the third . 161940_162580
how_about the third core square . 162620_163580
are you third core square . 163880_164580
gonna the third or third square . 164740_166580
sorry . 166600_166740
the third this is how the third car square name is . 167100_169750
that match Teddy . 169880_170660
&-um yep . 171940_172540
so which one you don't agree on this . 173580_175590
this . 175990_176230
&-um okay . 177220_177420
so <what did> what did Teddy Teddy what did you do to get
he says that &-um . 182700_183670
how would you if you had started with the core square like this . 184860_187580
how did you get to the second one . 188140_189350
he says . 189780_190210
it was just like . 190280_190980
show Nathan how you got there . 191250_192270
but it was actually like this . 192460_194210
what . 196350_196620
did he do with like copied two of this pattern . 196640_199340
uhhuh . 199410_199620
right here . 199960_200340
and now I have to switch it over . 202880_203990
can you go on with your own plan . 204870_206360
no . 207290_207380
if we go on with with the same plan plan &-um if we go on
&-uh &-um then we can make the quilt . 217300_220460
but &-um like &-um like we may choose this one . 220620_223900
<but then> but then it'll be different . 224220_226020
well you guys are gonna make the quilt together then in a little
so y'all so it does have to agree . 232830_234700
well you guys need to discuss then who which one you're gonna use .
'cause it sounds like you would've to change yours . 239540_241220
if you went with Nathan's and Nathan you would've to change yours
Teddy so so maybe you guys can discuss that . 244560_247020
see what &-uh what you . 247300_248510
want to do . 248600_248820
you don't want to discuss it . 249770_250780
Teddy won't change . 253240_254270
if &-um he for anything he would not change . 254500_257620
he would not change that . 257910_259070
do I he already had to do through here . 259339_262100
he already had to do one these two . 262420_264430
&-um . 265650_265780
that's all he already had to do . 266620_268090
those two . 268240_268580
you doing better . 271910_272740
let you work . 272820_273280
guys . 273360_273590
well we'll let you work . 274400_275020
not Jason . 275340_275660
okay . 276190_276360
so you can see maybe you guys can figure that . 276540_279510
out still putting them on . 279560_280450
and . 284940_285110
then you're gonna make three that look like . 285160_287350
that . 289430_289530
and three . 290200_290660
that's what we could just do like all of them like this . 291580_294740
and then we could like turn . 294810_295660
is a turn the same as a flip . 297080_298390
turn turn . 299550_300030
is a turn the same as a flip . 300670_301980
nope . 302510_302750
so you will have to do three that look like this . 303210_306760
that's the copy of your strip . 307300_308620
but those aren't the ones you're making right now . 308780_310510
what you're making right now are ones that look like this . 311110_314180
'cause that's the flip of your strip . 315350_316180
'cause you guys have three copies of your strip and three flips of
and you've begun now by making the flips . 321270_323020
because the first row and your finished quilt was a flip of the
so you're gonna do <flip copy flip copy> flip copy . 327420_330830
and but you've decided to make the three flips first . 331690_333940
okay . 334810_334990
but . 336260_336380
when you both finish this strip you won't both be able to make one
just like it . 339400_339940
right . 339960_340090
when . 343350_343520
you finish that . 343770_344180
Katie will you be able to make one just like it . 344530_346100
no . 347190_347250
well . 349430_349570
Katie and Sarah when you're done making the strip you're making now
just like it . 355480_355980
no . 356620_356740
Katie do you wanna make one . 359060_360350
that's just like that afterwards actually like one of us could do
and then . 366900_367190
but you guys are already beyond that pattern . 368740_370510
you're already skipping around . 370600_371900
so you need to plan first who's making what 'cause otherwise you'll
okay . 376800_377020
if you make all the flips first and then all the copies . 377040_379050
but since there were two of you and you need three of each kind you
and one's gonna have to do two copies and a flip . 385550_387780
I do two copies . 388440_389030
and a flip . 390260_390540
then that's the only one like that that you'll make . 390680_392540
that's what I'll . 393110_393500
make another one like this another . 393520_394500
one right . 394540_394770
and then one that looks like . 395000_396100
uhhuh . 396210_396420
that . 396590_396790
yep that that . 397180_397860
okay . 398800_399020
so she is making two flips and a copy . 399420_401230
and you're making two copies of the strip and a flip . 401740_404940
so this is . 405030_405340
the flip . 405400_405630
yeah . 405760_405870
that's the flip . 406220_406940
yep . 407060_407160
and you can always check because Sarah should make sure she marks
because Katie's is marked . 411110_412140
now that that's the way your strip goes . 412350_414190
and right now she's making a flip of it . 414460_416190
we're both making a flip . 416530_417620
<right now> right now you're both making a flip . 417760_419460
but then Katie's gonna make one more flip . 419540_421100
and Sarah's gonna instead check her plan for the quilt and make . 421120_425220
what is a copy of your strip . 425580_426330
that's . 428020_428190
okay . 428440_428550
maybe the maybe when you put the other &-um the other . 428600_431740
one Katie cut the &-um &-um . 432500_437650
okay . 443110_443380
that was a favorite reason . 443550_444550
all right . 446100_446270
when you guys get those . 446440_447190
&-um . 448300_448470
two strips . 449300_449980
done . 450080_450230
the two you're working on . 450280_451060
now is there . 451080_451590
could you put (th)em together and see what part of your quilts
yeah . 454710_454810
yeah . 455040_455180
what . 456290_456390
wait . 457000_457100
wait . 457160_457960
no why not because . 457700_458950
these are they're exactly the same . 459130_460740
they wouldn't . 460760_461230
right . 461410_461630
they're exactly the same . 461830_462500
they're both but . 462560_463060
after I make a copy because some little head of cake . 463200_466260
and then when she gets clubbed then you'll be able to start putting
but there's no place in your plan for your design right now . 471060_473390
where two flips come together . 473440_474900
okay . 475830_476100
good job . 476990_477430
I think you've got it all really well thought out . 477720_479660
I'm gonna go check in with another group . 479950_481310
I'm not staying on . 487770_488670
yeah . 488910_488970
okay . 489950_490190
&-um oh wait this one we went to stay the way it was which
yeah . 496070_496180
like this I like here . 496360_497990
&-um because when I first checked in with Kelly today she's working
&-um Jenna and Kelly had recorded a strip or at_least it's on
so what we did is look at the another part of the strip . 518419_521870
the part where the two reds squares came together . 522059_524140
and we did that on the floor . 524340_526300
&-um and found out that . 526740_528100
yes . 528180_528350
when those two red squares do come together at the top of their
but instead_of being all red it has two green squares in the center
so we &-um Kelly recorded a new version of what that strip would
and then we were just putting back her new idea that she had
and now she's gonna record that . 563140_564460
and that will be her last . 564480_565460
&-um then she'll have four . 565790_567180
