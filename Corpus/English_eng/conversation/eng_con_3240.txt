no . 0_1678
because that's what the person who does the question has to work out . 1678_4205
have you finished ? 4205_10255
all right, Stephen . 10255_14500
as soon as I've answered Ashley's question you can give me your story . 14500_21661
Danny, you'll be second on the story list . 21661_25300
and Laura third . 25300_28981
yep . 28981_39111
maybe they didn't pay the same amount for the ticket . 39111_41723
that would be why they would divide it in a different ratio . 41723_44211
jessica needs help Miss . 44211_45235
okay, a bit of quiet . 45235_46708
listening to Teague . 46708_47946
no, Jessica needs help first . 47946_49276
xxx story makes sense . 49276_51548
no . 51548_52523
no . 52523_53213
we'll listen to your story and I'll help Jessica . 53213_55060
xxx . 55060_55648
why not ? 55648_56218
because they thought they already had stories but then they read mine and realized they didn't xxx . 56218_62368
so you have a good story that you can +... 62368_64545
no it's not good . 64545_65128
it is . 65128_66608
all right . 66608_67248
well, it'll do . 67248_68416
I'll read it for her . 68416_71793
okay . 71793_73175
okay two basketball players were comparing how many points they had in their NBL careers . 73175_77735
shh +... 77735_78430
they had a ratio of one to one . 78430_79335
Katie . 79335_79855
they jointly scored five thousand, fifty five +... 79855_81838
sorry, Stephen you'll need to start again because you're not getting full attention . 81838_84628
come on now please . 84628_87271
two basketball players were comparing how many plays they had in their NBL career . 87271_92560
they had a ratio of one to one . 92560_94230
they both scored five fifty five thousand six hundred forty nine points . 94230_97895
together they equaled xxx . 97895_102023
one hundred and eleven thousand two hundred and ninety eight . 102023_105590
okay . 105590_107576
yeah, so that's a good story but where's the actual question if you were going to make it into a question for someone to do ? 107576_115158
my question was, um, one to one equals I mean, one for the ratio of one equals one hundred and eleven thousound two hundred and ninety eight . 115158_124038
oh, okay . 124038_124341
so the fifty five thousand would actually be the answer so it would have been better left out of the question, wouldn't it ? 124341_131163
so really your question would have boiled down to divide one hundred and eleven thousand in the ratio one to one . 131163_139145
yeah . 139145_140075
okay . 140075_140941
who else was there ? 140941_142260
Danny ? 142260_143790
I haven't finished Miss . 143790_145268
all right well I'll give you +... 145268_146651
xxx either . 146651_147013
well you let's just go with what you've got then, eh ? 147013_149890
what to say the story ? 149890_156715
yep . 156715_157076
we didn't have a story . 157076_158963
it's just like +... 158963_161315
read me what you have . 161315_162915
that'll be fine . 162915_164226
one to four ? 164226_164715
yeah . 164715_165580
xxx person how much xxx . 165580_170620
Emma has one blue candle and Laura has four red candles . 170620_174858
that's my story . 174858_177385
yeah, okay . 177385_178593
so that's a ratio story . 178593_180991
if Emma has one blue candle and Laura has four, what's the ratio of candles ? 180991_189450
but it's not really a dividing something in a ratio story is it ? 189450_193721
Danny ? 193721_194871
yes . 194871_196216
times up . 196216_197710
read me what you have please . 197710_199406
there was thirty lollies . 199406_205836
one man got ten lollies the other got twenty, therefore the ratio was ten to twenty . 205836_211963
okay . 211963_213643
so if we wanted to create a question for somebody in the class to do, then your story would say, two men have thirty lollies and they want to divide them in the ratio one to two +... 213643_227231
how much does each man get ? 227231_230521
all right ? 230521_232176
anybody else got a good story ? 232176_235248
xxx ? 235248_236201
there is a Mars Bar competition and you can win a free Mars Bar . 236201_239761
um, five in six are losers and the shop has one hundred and twenty one Mars Bars, how many Mars Bars are losers ? 239761_246151
so the ratio of five to six is winners to losers . 246151_251520
yeah, that's a good question . 251520_253951
did you understand the question Colin ? 253951_256728
yep . 256728_258435
however, do you actually think the Mars Bar company would have a ratio of five to six of winners and losers ? 258435_270360
no . 270360_271008
um, five are the losers and then the last one xxx . 271008_274878
the winners . 274878_275376
so a ratio of losers to winners of five to six . 275376_278815
is that likely ? 278815_280871
probably not . 280871_282206
no . 282206_283261
because every time someone wins they have to pay for a prize for another Mars Bar . 283261_290326
it's unlikely that the ratio would be five to six . 290326_292190
what would be a more realistic ratio if you were running the Mars Bar company . 292190_296318
and you wanted to give a prize for a winner, what ratio of winners to losers ? 296318_302305
let's do winners first to losers . 302305_303606
give me a pen . 303606_304483
one to ten . 304483_305015
Emma ? 305015_305655
one to six . 305655_306173
one to six . 306173_306943
one to five . 306943_308275
one to five . 308275_309368
two to ten . 309368_309993
two to ten . 309993_312935
one to five . 312935_314295
same thing isn't it ? 314295_315558
on that on that ad thing they have one to six . 315558_318181
do they ? 318181_319046
on the on the ad +... 319046_320095
or was it four ? 320095_320703
that was one to six . 320703_321886
that was one to three . 321886_323196
it used to be +... 323196_323848
so there's a is there an ad ? 323848_325336
yeah . 325336_325905
from the Mars Bar company that says that they're going to +... 325905_328693
something might xxx . 328693_330348
well, I must confess I would of thought it would of been more like one to twenty or thirty . 330348_336151
xxx . 336151_337358
okay . 337358_342775
good . 342775_343516
all right . 343516_344055
I want to show you one more way of writing these questions out before you start +... 344055_349965
and then you can have a choice of ways . 349965_355821
if the question let's go back to our two hundrend and ten dollars, so we have divide two ten in the ratio two is to five . 355821_365716
now this is just an alternate way of setting out your working . 365716_371715
it is not really any different in in actual working philosophy . 371715_378986
if or the first share will actually get two seventh's of the prize . 378986_391863
is that right ? 391863_393258
because you had seven piles that you had to divide the money in and the first person would actually get two out of seven of them . 393258_404765
so you could actually just find two sevenths of two hundred and ten which means that you have to multiply by two and divide by seven . 404765_414536
easier if you divide by seven first . 414536_417185
that's what you did before . 417185_417905
you found thirty and multiplied by two and got ? 417905_421191
sixty . 421191_423026
sixty and so what is the second share worth ? 423026_426338
a hundred and fifty . 426338_427583
a hundred and fifty we already know because that's five sevenths of two hundred and ten, one hundred and fifty . 427583_436495
so you've got two methods . 436495_439176
you can say, seven shares is two hundred and ten dollars . 439176_442678
work out one share and then two and five . 442678_447510
or you can go straight to saying, if I have two shares out of seven . 447510_452265
I must have two sevenths of the money on the left hand side and I must have five sevenths of the money on the right hand side . 452265_462145
so, how would I set this one out where I had a ratio of eight to three . 462145_471350
I would of said the first person gets eight elevenths of sixty six and the second person gets three elevenths of sixty six . 471350_484335
here I would of said the first person gets one quarter of two hundred and the other person gets three quarters of two hundred dollars . 484335_496901
it has one small advantage, it's probably just a tad shorter in writing, but that's about the only advantage . 496901_504685
which method do you like best ? 504685_508940
let's take a sample . 508940_510685
let's have Nicole, Jessica, Daniel and Michelle . 510685_516034
which method would you prefer the seven shares, one share, which I might add is basically what you call a unitary method because you go down to one and then back up to two and five . 516034_536425
do you prefer the unitary method or the fraction method ? 536425_539858
unitary method . 539858_541025
okay . 541025_541816
Jessica ? 541816_542466
yeah, that one . 542466_543083
unitary . 543083_543635
Michelle ? 543635_545825
the top one . 545825_546793
the top one . 546793_547706
the unitary one . 547706_548608
who else ? 548608_550221
was it Daniel was it you I was asking ? 550221_552120
no . 552120_552981
unitary or fraction ? 552981_554118
unitary . 554118_555048
okay . 555048_556415
that's fine . 556415_557430
you'll find most people across the world do the unitary method but you might want to write it that way if you like . 557430_565343
all right . 565343_566446
exercise ten_o_four . 566446_568063
