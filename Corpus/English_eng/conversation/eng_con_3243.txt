everybody got a box ? 0_9876
xxx . 9876_12598
he does usually . 12598_25508
okay, you make a prediction first . 25508_32373
my prediction is twelve . 32373_34118
how many ? 34118_37790
I said my prediction is twelve and you got to xxx . 37790_49781
it's twelve . 49781_50205
okay . 50205_52638
the table you have there has got color, tally and frequency . 52638_59636
you won't need the tally column because you only use the tally column when you've got lots to count, and you don't have very many . 59636_65845
so when you've opened your packet, count how many of each color you are and write that in the frequency column because frequency means ? 65845_74100
how many . 74100_77396
and you write two in the frequency . 77396_83045
I've got lots of blues . 83045_89165
I've got five xxx . 89165_92980
pardon ? 92980_94501
who ? 94501_94868
you got fifty one . 94868_97868
no . 97868_98775
xxx . 98775_103485
I didn't realize you were xxx . 102613_117646
uh, add it on the bottom, then . 117646_121740
well then you can . 121740_125315
well, how many blues have you got ? 125315_132236
none ? 132236_133228
well, actually why don't we cross tally off and write frequency there . 133228_136756
it'll be easier, won't it ? 136756_137803
xxx and just makes it even . 137803_141601
okay, now you can xxx Miss ? 141601_144530
how many ? 144530_147171
well, the blue equals none, brown is one, red is three . 147171_151963
are we done xxx now Miss ? 151963_153273
I'd like it complete . 153273_153913
what do you have to complete ? 153913_155578
just the +... 155578_156136
tally's the working column and frequency's the answer . 156136_159203
everything Miss ? 159203_160051
oh, I'm hungry . 160051_161026
but we don't really need a work column so +... 161026_162230
look at these, they're very tempting . 162230_163386
and now I've got to xxx . 163386_165206
yes, I think so . 165206_169385
miss, can we eat this after we just calculate the frequency ? 169385_186803
yes . 186803_187235
he's got thirteen . 187235_196378
what does it mean by frequency ? 196378_213393
frequency means how many . 213393_215465
how do you work out percentage ? 215465_218366
that's what I'm about to do . 218366_219873
let's have a quick look at this . 219873_220911
let's presume that I only had a total of three, four, five, six Smarties, and I only had blue, red and green . 220911_235360
how would I work out the percentage of blue ? 235360_239573
well I have three out of six and to change a fraction to a percentage you must multiply by one hundred . 239573_249015
that's a half so I really could just do that in my head, fifty percent . 249015_253733
how would I work out this fraction ? 253733_259644
that would be two out of six, which is a third . 259644_269308
it's thirty three point three three . 269308_271830
thirty three point three for Peter . 271830_275525
and one out of six +... 275525_282988
we've got sixteen, or so, isn't it ? 282988_288531
sixteen and two thirds ? 288531_289340
so, you're going to have a different number here to six, aren't you ? 289340_301650
how many did you have, Sally ? 301650_303290
thirteen . 303290_305208
what an awkward number, but never mind . 305208_308081
how many did you have, Jessica ? 308081_309898
thirteen . 309898_310673
thirteen ? 310673_311320
twelve . 311320_312471
twelve . 312471_313063
anybody have fourteen ? 313063_315250
I had thirteen . 315250_316448
thirteen or twelve . 316448_318065
so your number here won't be six . 318065_321581
it will be twelve or thirteen . 321581_324326
it's easier if you use your calculator in this case . 324326_328943
especially if you've got thirteen because it's an awkward number . 328943_331088
do you have to write down three over six times one hundred xxx ? 331088_334301
well, you were right . 334301_338430
something over thirteen would be a good idea to do, so you remember how to do it . 338430_344406
how many ? 344406_347111
no, the tally is the working column for the frequency . 347111_352631
what if you have zero xxx ? 352631_355143
so, what have you got ? 355143_362135
four blue out of twelve . 362135_364316
so you were right . 364316_365206
four, fraction twelve, times one hundred . 365206_368261
well, you're lucky because four out of twelve is a third, and a third of one hundred is easy to work out . 368261_376563
I already know a third is thirty three and a third . 376563_383355
how would you work out like to continue working without a xxx ? 383355_388601
ask xxx for her calculator . 388601_389810
how are you going to continue working without a biro ? 389810_397871
I'm not going to xxx my calculator . 397871_404106
calculator would be helpful, too . 404106_406591
did you happen to remember a calculator today ? 406591_408136
it's broken . 408136_410463
well, you've got your yearly exam coming up, you know, and in the third week or so next term . 410463_423303
it might be an idea to get one before your yearly exam . 423303_427115
what for ? 427115_435888
I didn't have any blues, any browns, one green +... 435888_438743
no, that can't be right . 438743_439870
no oranges, four pinks +... 439870_441503
this means doesn't mean percentage of total . 441503_444063
it means what percent is blue out of the total . 444063_447401
it's obviously nothing, nothing . 447401_449223
now you have to do one, twelve times one hundred to work out that color's percent . 449223_458728
xxx . 458728_459868
well that's lucky for you, you don't have anything to +... 459868_475568
xxx . 475568_477798
yeah . 477798_478141
like pink, yeah, orange and black equal . 478141_481741
do you know any xxx ? 481741_483365
eight thirds . 483365_486941
good choice . 486941_489348
do you know how to work this out ? 489348_492123
you do one, fraction twelve xxx which is all right . 492123_498285
three, fraction twelve . 498285_501620
three, fraction twelve , one, fraction twelve one xxx fraction twelve . 501620_505595
modify the xxx . 505595_507940
I'm not really up on Smarties . 507940_526630
xxx . 526630_536306
Byron . 536306_542728
what ? 542728_544226
I've got twenty one , six seven . 544226_550585
did you when you add them up make it six repeater and three repeater or just six and three ? 550585_556745
just six and three . 556745_557880
oh, then that's where you probably you've got a xxx ? 557880_562928
I got xxx left xxx nine nine . 562928_567153
