okay Caesara . 0_1215
Could you put the range on ? 1215_3921
What do you want me to change it to ? 3921_5594
Oh, not that, I mean like, not that change the little colored
You mean, I'm sorry I'm not understanding .
the little blue thing . 12475_13545
Ah, count within the range . 13545_16033
Sorry . 16033_16591
Didn't hear you . 16591_17226
Big voice . 17226_18057
okay . 18057_18762
You go to the longest lasting battery on the pink .
okay, and then, narrow it down to the top ten .
Count of ten . 29289_32303
okay, count of ten, oh, thank you, I was wondering how I was going to
okay . 35595_39518
And I was saying see like there's seven green that last longer . 39518_46152
okay, the greens are the Always Readys , so let's make sure we keep
okay, the Always Ready is more consistent with the seven right there . 51290_56160
and then like uh 56160_58038
I was just saying cuz like all seven, seven out of three 63788_67698
Good point . 74192_76800
I understand . 76800_79457
You understand ? 79457_80318
okay, Jamie, I'm not sure I do . 80318_82699
So could you say it for me ? 82699_84416
She's understanding 84416_86759
so the Always Ready Batteries are better, 96425_100377
Ah, is that Jessica . 103050_104211
Allright, no, Jason ? 104211_106281
Ah, but, see, still, the uh the uh the pink ones, the Tough Cell, 106281_114887
And so then if you put all those in, you'd have seven . 125954_130318
So you're saying if I open this out a little bit . 131473_132955
Well maybe Caesara you can explain to us why you chose ten . 132955_136160
That would be really helpful . 136160_137209
Alright, there was ten of the always Ready, 137209_139581
So that's twenty, and half of twenty is ten, 140863_143536
But why would it be helpful for us to know about the top ten ? 145341_151823
Why did you choose that ? 151823_153177
Why did you choose ten instead of twelve ? 153177_158433
Because I was trying to go with the half . 158433_161861
Ah . 161861_162754
okay . 162754_163372
Blake ? 163372_163953
Can you put the representative value up there please ? 163953_167194
I sure will . 167194_168961
Will you put it on eight ? 168961_170833
I don't know if I can get it . 170833_179834
That's close . 179834_180219
Is that close enough ? 180219_180906
Now see there's still green ones behind eighty, 180906_185593
So I'd rather have a consistent battery 189972_192440
Why did why were you picking eighty ? 197561_200108
Well because most of Tough Cell batteries were all over eighty . 200108_205184
Ah . 205184_205613
okay . 205613_206183
So it's like a lower limit for you . 206183_208225
okay . 208225_209103
Questions for Blake ? 209103_210369
Yes Jamie ? 210369_212551
Um, why wouldn't the um 212551_216926
Well because all your Tough Cell is above eighty, 219477_223514
I know, but that's only three out of ten . 228985_232544
No but see, you could, they only did, what ten batteries ? 232544_236920
So the two or three will add up . 236920_241394
They'll add up to more bad batteries and all that . 241394_245809
Oh I see as you get more and more batteries 245809_248660
okay, is that Jamie ? 251224_252546
So why wouldn't 252546_254195
Well because the way that those ten batteries show on the chart that
Kyle .
Do you have something to add or ask ?
I was just going to say that well, even though, seven of the ten
Yeah it could .
okay, everybody understand what Jessica said ?
No, I didn't . 307150_308317
No ?
Caesara ? 309151_310233
I didn't hear it . 310233_310874
Seqouria, did you understand her ?
Could you explain what she said ? 310233_314773
She said that um if, even though that um the highest seventeen, the
And if you had something important to do um then you could end up
Nice .
