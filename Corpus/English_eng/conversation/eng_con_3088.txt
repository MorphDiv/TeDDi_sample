so I noticed I should put . 260_2110
it right here . 2200_2450
okay . 3590_3830
&-um why don't we see . 4220_5040
do we have those . 5200_5670
cut . 5740_5850
yeah . 5960_6030
could you cut right . 6260_6830
what do you what . 6910_7390
do you mean I think I already made that one before . 7440_9620
we came here because &-uh Nathan had something interesting to say .
what did you say . 15550_16190
&-uh what did you tell Jen . 16460_19140
&-um that &-um &-um you that don't &-um that not don't make like
and then all the &-um other corners . 30460_32610
&-um &-uh one color two . 33050_35030
because &-um no matter if you flip it or do anything with it it
why not because &-um because there it's only &-um like two colors
and these are only two colors too . 49300_50960
and they do work are the ones that you're working on . 51060_54340
what do you mean . 54360_54780
it doesn't work . 54840_55340
because &-um what happens is &-um . 56430_60720
sorry . 75030_75180
oh sorry . 75920_76150
one ten . 78580_79090
and . 80670_80790
you put that you . 80840_81480
don't know how to count . 81680_82530
do you . 82700_83150
that's kinda what Justin is like . 85540_87700
three five one . 87780_88870
okay . 89630_89780
all I'm interested <in this> in this idea that you you said
if you made it . 94880_95510
can you describe it again . 96500_97420
I didn't understand what you meant by it . 98200_99530
didn't doesn't work if . 99600_100950
you it doesn't work . 101000_103970
&-um . 104280_104390
if if you do it then what what doesn't work . 104620_106980
it's because &-um &-um it matters on the outside of it . 108020_112040
and &-um and &-um the blue keeps on going in the blue places so it
so it never gets in a place . 119220_121060
&-um you could have like &-um a yellow diamond . 121710_124510
and then like <blue blue> blue and then red . 125210_127710
<that would> that would be good . 128530_130110
but you can't have like &-um you can't have just all blues out
what what why not . 138060_138820
because &-um because &-um what happens is &-um there &-um . 139430_148420
what what doesn't work about it . 149350_150750
that's what I'm wondering . 150800_151580
I mean you're what what are you trying to make . 151960_154100
here . 154150_154420
are you trying to make . 154440_155110
&-um quilt families . 155540_156610
quilt families . 157120_157560
okay . 157780_157940
yeah . 157960_158170
so so you can make a two by two design with what you're talking
right . 163300_163390
no not with the diamond with the mill . 164000_166660
then four than four boobs on the outside that you can't . 166710_172260
because_of . 172280_172830
would that make a four square though . 173010_174470
it could make a core square . 175500_177140
and but you know what the only thing it can only make it . 177980_182380
can only make a one on two by two . 182440_184670
oh you couldn't get more two by twos . 185680_187590
out_of it . 187640_187950
yeah . 188670_188740
because can you show us . 188960_190100
show it to us . 190440_190860
we . 191540_191550
have to save the one that . 191990_192860
there . 193530_193820
yeah . 194000_194060
I would like to see that . 195000_195700
that's interesting idea . 195860_197580
f m . 199850_201250
I o and then it's eleven . 204600_208470
now we have to . 216860_217690
explore . 221760_222070
okay . 227750_227860
this is interesting . 227920_228800
we'll see first again . 230280_231150
hey . 239580_239720
get up there . 240700_241190
get up there . 242100_242700
are you medium . 243420_244660
let's see . 246970_247330
I gotta have another . 247560_248320
one so . 248580_249300
you flip . 250140_250450
I . 254720_254920
I done . 255440_255670
this way I'm just doing it . 259550_263990
and I just put it down there . 271970_273190
wait no sideways . 274630_276230
oops . 283860_284070
back . 284950_285220
and I just gotta put blues on the outside . 286860_294430
and . 296340_296450
put it down and now turn it again . 304570_307790
it is fun . 310100_310860
copy . 314190_314400
and now let's see how we have to bring it down here . 315420_318990
now we have to turn it again . 320340_322030
woo . 322990_323110
listen . 323580_323800
fine . 324400_324500
hey get back up there . 325430_326500
okay . 329150_329370
see I'll show you what this one . 335500_337750
see if I turn it it keeps on getting being the same . 338020_341380
ah I see . 342230_343180
and even if you go like this . 344700_346270
oh . 346900_346930
how_about if you flip it . 347420_348620
yeah . 348780_348860
you can flip it . 349030_349520
oh . 351500_351670
and I'll make a core . 353980_357070
this is I'll show you the only core square that you can make . 357510_360780
this is the only core square you can make . 361440_363220
I'll even oh I'll even flip and turn this other one . 363590_367910
yes . 369180_369240
so Nathan still talking with Steve yes . 371140_373580
see it'll be the same . 374620_375820
I'll even try and turn that . 376040_377460
what . 379510_379700
is it about that . 379800_380420
why is that the only shape that goes . 380620_382550
back &-um . 382750_383710
do you think there might be others that . 383900_385430
that there's others that do this . 386400_388150
there's others two two more that I can think of . 388400_391780
well . 392580_392670
what is it about those . 392750_393730
that I'll have to escape this . 393830_396020
do you want to save your . 396540_397540
work no score . 397670_403500
why why do you think that would be . 403900_405220
I'll show you see . 406910_409410
let's see . 410020_410310
this is one that . 411790_413390
is that . 414220_415460
you can't that you can only make one core square with . 415500_421700
&-um okay . 425780_428000
&-um what what is it about that . 433340_437590
shape that that you think . 437640_438980
makes it . 439090_439330
so what did you do to it to show me . 440660_443260
save . 443890_444070
the log off . 444120_444740
&-um Kevin . 444940_445320
you did a few things to show me &-uh what you would do to it . 446090_449870
and it look the same . 449960_450810
get a what . 451140_452060
turn . 452510_452750
&-um turns . 452860_453580
&-um both . 454180_455100
ways . 455120_455210
yeah . 456110_456230
and flips . 456500_457480
turn and flips are all the same . 458470_460470
yeah . 460520_460640
but where . 460760_461510
okay . 461910_462180
&-um what does a flip do . 463110_466710
what does a flip . 466760_467690
how_come . 470140_470470
it's the same . 470520_470950
when it's when it flips . 471000_472580
is there a word for that . 474420_475260
same . 482400_482540
well . 486460_486580
I'm think of a word . 486830_487710
that you I know . 488220_488620
what is it . 489250_489490
word . 489690_490340
I know it's symmetrical . 489760_490660
symmetrical . 490940_491540
yeah . 491920_491980
it's symmetrical . 492000_492740
well but you did . 492840_493430
so it was symmetrical when you flipped it which way this way . 493570_496700
it . 498020_498170
it's symmetrical . 498360_499020
always too . 499180_499840
oh it's symmetrical . 500720_501620
always do you suppose that might have something to do with it that
yeah they . 505430_506300
&-um . 508050_508180
like &-um with other usually &-um other ones that can't &-um that
&-um usually the ones that are symmetrical that aren't like those .
yeah ones that so they show you . 521590_523700
&-um usually those lines you can only use it . 523860_527270
usually do it two ways . 527670_529270
it's only symmetrical . 529910_530780
two ways . 530800_531080
yeah . 531350_531410
like two ways or maybe not the . 531640_532590
other way . 532680_532940
yeah . 533820_533980
so and then . 534190_534750
okay . 534860_535060
and &-um that way you can do it all the ways . 536420_539100
even if you flip it turn it <you can> you can Dagal you can
you can do a Dagal or you can go right there or flip it just there
and &-um it'll still be the same . 556410_558260
that's great . 558620_559020
