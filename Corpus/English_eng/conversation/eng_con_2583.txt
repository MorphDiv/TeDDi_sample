let me remind you one more time about the discussion sections tomorrow . 2065_5445
those of you who happen to be in the one o'clock discussion session we're moving from fourteen hundred to thirteen hundred Chemistry Building . 5665_11785
&-uh if by any chance you go to fourteen hundred Chem tomorrow I think you'll end up in a P chem class which I assume most of you would prefer not to be at . 12505_20885
some of you might wanna be there but &-uh if you end up in a chemistry class remember we're in the lecture room on the opposite side of the building . 21065_27505
also remember for tomorrow's discussion that I gave you kind_of a thought exercise at the end of last Wednesday's discussion after we had critiqued &-um that article that I read you from the Ann Arbor News found all the things that were wrong with that study I asked you to think in this intervening week about the kinds of experiments you might do . 28315_46475
&-uh and do a better job of trying to find out whether there's a relationship between birth control pill usage and cancer risk . 47295_53215
and I think I said there is no single experiment . 53945_56605
it's not like there's one right answer . 56905_58265
it's a very complicated question how scientists go about establishing cause and effect . 58465_62545
&-uh so I would hope to hear a variety of approaches which you might come up with in terms of trying to experimentally address that question . 63385_69205
so we'll discuss those tomorrow and see both the strengths and weaknesses of the various experimental approaches . 69385_74765
today as you know from looking at the lecture schedule we're gonna to be talking about metastasis which &-uh the process refers to the spread of tumor cells from their primary site of origin where they originated to another organ via body fluids and most of the time we're talking about the blood stream the circulatory system . 76575_93135
but you should keep in mind that there are other body fluids there's the lymphatic system there's the cerebral spinal fluid there's also the peritoneal fluid in the abdominal cavity . 93775_102035
anywhere there's a fluid in the body that cancer cells can get into those cancer cells could float through that fluid and end up somewhere else in the body . 102725_109625
so basically it's &-uh getting the cancer cell into a fluid somewhere and transporting it to a distant site . 110365_115525
and usually we're talking about the blood stream . 115805_118185
&-uh by now you have a pretty good idea of the importance of metastasis &-um as a phenomenon first of all it's part of the inherent definition of cancer . 119105_127325
remember the only defining characteristic of cancer was the ability to spread by the process of engaging in metastasis . 127885_135045
that's the only thing that distinguishes it unequivocally from a benign tumor . 135465_138945
so metastasis is part of the defining features of a cancer . 139465_144205
also last time you learned that &-uh metastasis is one of the main ways that cancer uses to kill people . 144885_152405
&-uh the main cause of death is usually not the primary tumor but metastases spreading throughout the body and often getting into the one one of the vital organs such as the brain or liver or kidney and this is often what cancer patients will die of . 152985_166985
so this means that if we could do anything to interfere with the process of metastasis in essence we could cure people of cancer or we could at least cure people of the most debilitating and threatening life threatening aspect of cancer which is the ability of these cancer cells to metastasize . 167545_183705
so today we're gonna focus on metastasis . 184565_186465
and in essence we'll be focusing on the question of what is it about cancer cells that in fact allows them to metastasize while the benign tumor cells can't do this nor do other normal kinds of cells do this . 186785_199585
in addressing this question first of all you have to realize that metastasis is not a single event . 200445_206625
and we talk about metastasis it's not really a single process that we're talking about it's actually a sequential series of events all of which must take place in order for this phenomenon of metastasis to occur . 207265_219765
we commonly we therefore divide metastasis into a series of stages and I'm gonna use three major steps to divide this process today . 220325_229165
&=pause_while_writing_on_overhead perhaps I should remind you that the definition of cancer remember was the tumor that had the capability of invading and metastasizing really the first step in the process of metastasis is invasion . 266005_277505
(0.4) so the first part of the definition of a tumor cell is in &~fa of a cancer cell is in fact this process that is the first step in metastasis . 278525_288765
why do cancer cells do this invade surrounding tissue why do they tend to wander off and infiltrate penetrate surrounding tissue while normal cells don't do that . 289065_297325
actually there's several factors that appear to be involved first of all cancer cells don't stick together . 298745_306125
&-uh if a group of you <in this> in this room wanted to think of yourselves as a cluster of cancer cells if you were all holding hands and joined to each_other clearly it'd be very difficult to metastasize . 307145_316785
you couldn't very easily invade . 316625_318545
&-uh you'd all hafta you_know move as a as an attack unit . 319225_321905
and if all the cells in a tumor were attached to each_other it would be virtually impossible . 322165_326285
so the first thing that cancer cells exhibit to get over this problem is decreased adhesiveness +... 327025_331745
they don't stick together . 335405_336645
they don't hold hands . 336885_337805
unlike normal cells . 338305_339385
&-um if you were to take a clump of tumor tissue take a biopsy a specimen of tumor tissue and put those cells into a test tube and put (th)em in some kind_of a a nutrient solution and shake that test tube very very vigorously you'd find that the cancer cells would readily come apart . 340505_356845
and you'd soon have a solution a suspension of individual largely individual cancer cells . 357545_361925
now you might not think that's unusual until you hear what happens with normal cells if you took a normal chunk of tissue a biopsy from a normal region of tissue &-uh and put them in a test tube with a nutrient solution and try to shake them up they would not come apart . 362705_375525
there are very very strong structures that hold adjacent cells together in most tissues of the body . 376165_383065
especially in epithelia which remember are the main tissues in which cancers arise . 383805_388205
so cancer cells don't stick to each_other they're not structurally joined to each_other the way normal cells are . 389065_395085
and since they're not stuck to each_other individual cells can easily wander off +... 395505_399525
the second thing that cancer cells exhibit that allows them to invade is increased motility &=pause_while_writing and again picture yourself as part of a clump of cancer cells if you were all holding hands if you let go but you just stood there again you're not gonna invade you're not gonna go anywhere . 402665_426045
you gotta be able to walk you gotta be able to move . 426345_428165
most cells in the body don't move . 428725_430125
most cells are not motile there are some exceptions some cells as part of their normal functions need to move but in an adult organism very few cells actually do this . 430805_439125
and even cells in the +//. 439845_440905
blood cells you might think of them moving but it's really the fluid that's moving more than the cells themselves . 441265_445465
so most cells in the body don't tend to wander off walk away so to speak from their site of origin . 446165_451025
untrue of cancer cells . 451985_453225
cancer cells tend to exhibit increased motility they have &-uh contractural proteins within them now most cells have these but in cancer cells they're being used to actively move the cancer cell from one location to another . 453275_464795
the final thing you gotta worry about &~yo you've seen we we've gotten rid of the links that hold cells together we've given them the ability to move the final thing is you've got to +//. 465955_475215
you're not just moving through open space tumors are surrounded by tissue and if cancer cells are gonna move they have to somehow get through that tissue . 475635_484135
and the way they do this is through the secretion of a family of enzymes called proteases and presumably from your biology background you know what this word protease means it's any protein digesting enzyme &=pause_while_writing and cancer cells use these proteases because much of the supporting tissue around the tumor has protein structures and protein fibers that represent a barrier . 484795_514455
so in essence what these proteases do is digest a path through the surrounding tissue . 515075_521895
&=pause_while_writing and especially the tissue that we call the stroma . 524015_530835
the stroma is the supporting tissue . 532895_535175
perhaps connective tissue you may have heard that term the supporting tissue of the body . 535395_539595
and it consists of cell types called fibroblasts which secrete protein fibers and these protein fibers come together to form a structure called the extracellular matrix &=pause_while_writing a dense network of intertwined protein fibers and finally so we've got fibroblasts we've got these protein fibers to form the extracellular matrix and we also have blood vessels in the stroma . 539945_569925
and we talked about the importance of those &-uh to some extent last time . 573865_577725
so this supporting tissue contains a mixture of cells of protein fibers forming this matrix and blood vessels . 578665_584765
and if cancer cells are gonna wander off and invade and infiltrate &~surrou surrounding tissues they've gotta digest a path through this stroma . 585445_592305
and as I said they do it through the secretion of proteases and there's actually two main proteases that they use one is called plasminogen activator &=pause_while_writing and plasminogen activator actually catalyzes a reaction . 593065_616145
it catalyzes the conversion of a protein called plasminogen +... 616505_619485
and converts it to a protein called plasmin . 622825_625245
and plasmin is an active protease +... 625945_628845
while plasminogen represents an inactive precursor of that protease . 632365_637105
(0.6) now remember I told you that plasminogen activator itself is a protease what is a protease by definition it's something that breaks peptide bonds . 638505_649525
so plasminogen activator breaks one of the peptide bonds in this precursor called plasminogen which is normally inactive by breaking that peptide bond and cleaving off a fragment from its inactive precursor it converts it to plasmin which now in turn can also function as a protease . 650545_666665
now you might wonder what is the purpose of cancer cells secreting one protease whose sole function seems to be to create a second different protease . 667665_676485
in essence this is an amplification mechanism . 677665_679865
cancer cells don't hafta secrete very much plasminogen activator (be)cause this is in essence an enzyme . 681025_686365
remember enzymes being catalysts required in very very small quantities so a small amount of plasminogen activator can convert large amounts of plasminogen to large amounts of plasmin . 686825_696665
and plasminogen is found in very high concentration in the stroma . 696985_701005
okay so most of the body tissues and the supporting tissues of the body in the stroma contain large amounts of plasminogen . 701355_707075
it's normally not doing anything it's just sitting there as an inactive precursor . 707555_711795
but when the cancer cells secrete plasminogen activator it only takes a few molecules they can convert millions of molecules of plasminogen into plasmin (un)til you get a very very high local concentration of protease from secreting just a few molecules from the cancer cells . 712055_726475
now another protease that's active in cancer tissue is a family of &~protei proteases called matrix metalloproteases &=pause_while_writing of the host organism remember last week I told you that cancer cells cause the normal tissue to produce blood vessels which is sort_of dumb in terms of the host because the blood vessels supported the tumor . 727935_757915
now the &~ho normal host tissue is doing another thing that's pretty dumb from the point of view of the host which is producing matrix metalloproteases on the existence of these cancer cells and these matrix metalloproteases again help to break down the extracellular matrix . 771885_785865
it appears that both of these families of proteases they do somewhat different things and both of them are needed in_order_to get efficient invasion by cancer cells through the stroma . 786765_795625
now once these enzymes have allowed the cancer cells to digest a path through the stroma the cancer cells can migrate away from the primary site of origin until they encounter a blood vessel usually it's a small capillary a large &~bus blood vessel would be harder for cancer cells to get into . 798045_813165
but small capillaries which have a wall that's only a single layer thick cancer cells can actually penetrate that wall again with the aid of these proteolytic enzymes helping to break down the structure of that capillary wall the cancer cells can penetrate and now get into these small blood vessels . 813525_830205
so the cancer cells end up doing three things that allow them to start off the process of metastasis . 830585_837185
first of all they don't stick together so you don't have +//. 837645_839945
you know remember I told you you can have enormous benign tumors . 840165_843585
benign tumors can weigh fifty or a hundred pounds . 843885_845985
and the reason they are benign is that those &~tu cells are all stuck to each_other . 846445_850545
no matter how big the tumor gets you still have just one mass of cells surgeon goes there removes it no matter how big the tumor &-uh and you're cured . 850885_859345
the only case where that's really a problem is if that tumor happens to be growing in your brain &-uh where clearly if the surgeon doesn't get to it quickly it can cause significant brain damage . 859765_868405
but in benign tumors if the cells stick together you have no problem . 869045_872005
malignancy the cells don't stick together the cells are mobile they wander off finally they secrete these enzymes and stimulate the stroma to produce more enzymes which ends up digesting a path through the surrounding tissues and into blood vessels . 872625_885005
so that's the first of the three steps of metastasis the &-uh invasion of cancer cells in the surrounding tissues and in the blood vessels . 886415_895915
once they've gotten into blood vessels we'll go to roman numeral two now the second major stage in the process of metastasis once the cancer cells get through the walls of these small blood vessels they're now in the circulatory system . 896495_910515
and at this point cancer cells are transported &=pause_while_writing through the circulatory system to distant place . 911025_920625
so through the bloodstream &=pause_while_writing in essence the cancer cells are now free to circulate everywhere in the body . 921485_937325
(0.5) now you might think intuitively that once cancer cells had entered into the circulatory system the game is sort_of over . 941865_948965
that there'd be &~s no problem getting these cancer cells transported everywhere around the body &-uh to set up distant metastases . 949445_955165
but actually it turns out that the blood stream is not a particularly hospitable place for cancer cells and in fact very few cancer cells actually survive the trip . 955845_965505
how do we know that ? 966165_967045
&-uh we make lots_of statements how do we know these things ? 968165_970545
well clearly you can't do experiments on how cancers cells survive in the blood stream by injecting cancer cells into the veins and arteries of humans right ? 971285_980145
that would not only be unethical it actually wouldn't work because of the immunological rejection problem we talked about last week so you can't study it in humans again you can't study it in test tube experiments because test tubes don't have circulatory systems so the only way you can test this is in animals . 979755_996455
and the way it's tested in animals +//. 997395_999015
you've gotta have a way once you've injected the cancer cells into the bloodstream to follow them to find out where they are to follow their fates . 999215_1005795
and the way this is done is by creating populations of radioactive cancer cells . 1005845_1010485
&=pause_while_writing so you could take a transplantable tumor for a mouse for example and grow it in a mouse for a while in the presence of radioactive isotopes , put some isotopes into the mouse's diet . 1012525_1022925
or do this in culture expose these cells to radioactive isotopes making the &~rad the cancer cells radioactive . 1023805_1029105
now it's easy to spot these cells because they're radioactive . 1029565_1032605
so now you isolate some of these radioactive cells inject them into another animal's bloodstream &=pause_while_writing and you wait to see what happens and you can use a Geiger counter or some other mechanism for monitoring radioactivity to find out what's happened to these cancer cells . 1033185_1058785
what you find is that ninety nine point nine percent of those cancer cells are quickly destroyed in the bloodstream +... 1059595_1064295
less than zero point one percent will typically survive the trip +... 1067035_1071955
a few days later <most of> &~radio most of those radioactive cells most of the radioactivity has been &-uh discharged from the body . 1074495_1081255
broken down gotten rid of . 1082335_1083595
so most cancer cells and this is +//. 1084675_1087435
remember with &~inbre inbred strains of animals these animals should be able to genetically accept these tumor cells that we're working with yet very few of the cancer cells survive . 1088165_1097205
so it's been concluded that in fact only a tiny fraction of the cancer cells of a typical tumor can in fact survive in the bloodstream . 1098005_1106225
and therefore lead to the process of metastasis . 1107025_1109805
now what determines whether or not a cancer cell in fact can do this if they're supplied in the blood stream ultimately set up a distant metastasis . 1110265_1117145
is it random is the one cell or so out_of a thousand that survives the trip and ends up setting up a metastasis is that just a lucky cell that somehow escaped all the pitfalls of traveling through the bloodstream ? 1117585_1129485
or was there something special about that cell something unusual that allowed it to survive the trip ? 1130025_1135685
well if you open your course pack to page twenty nine &-uh sorry page twenty one let's talk about this experiment which addresses that question of whether there's something special about the cells that metastasize . 1136715_1154355
(0.7) these experiments involve a &-uh a melanoma cell line remember this is a malignancy of pigmented cells of the skin &-uh a melanoma called b@l sixteen . 1157655_1168335
it's a mouse transplantable tumor . 1169555_1171495
and it rarely metastasizes . 1172295_1175295
if you want to implant some of these cancer cells under the skin of a typical mouse &-um and you wait a few weeks for it to grow into large tumors eventually you will find a few metastases in the lungs . 1174585_1186465
you might find one or two or three if you wait several weeks but not very many . 1187145_1190345
but let's take some of the cancer cells out_of one of those successful metastases isolate those cancer cells put them under the skin of another mouse and repeat the process a second time . 1191905_1203345
wait a few weeks look in the lungs you'll find this time there may be four or five metastases a few more than you got the first time . 1203845_1209945
again isolate those cells inject them into a third mouse . 1210405_1213385
and repeat this over and over ten successive times . 1213805_1217245
after ten repeats we have a cell population which we refer to as melanoma b@l sixteen they're still the cell same cancer cell type but we call it the f@l ten generation it's the tenth transplanted generation . 1217975_1230535
where you've selected each time four cells that metastasize and reinject the dose . 1231135_1235915
the melanoma b@l sixteen f@l ten line metastasizes very very frequently . 1236635_1241275
you inject this into an animal and in a few weeks you'll find hundreds and hundreds of metastases in the lungs . 1241745_1246705
so it is metastasizing very very frequently . 1247265_1249545
so what can you conclude from this ? 1250225_1252245
although it might not be apparent immediately to you in fact these experiments show you that cancer cells vary in the frequency with which they metastasize . 1252945_1264365
&=pause_while_writing now how do we know that cell populations vary that they're not all the same ? 1279065_1283685
let's go back and think about this experiment again . 1283945_1286285
what you're obviously doing is selecting each time for those cells that &~su successfully metastasize . 1286705_1293385
if it was sheer luck just a random fluke that they managed to do it then the next time you injected those cells in the whole population shouldn't do any better at metastasizing than the first population did if it were sheer luck . 1293805_1306225
but that's not what's happening each time it's getting better because you are selecting specifically for those cells that know how to metastasize . 1306545_1314505
and by the end you have a highly enriched population you've taken a cancer cell line where initially those cells represented a very very tiny fraction of the total population now those cells capable of metastasizing represent a very high percentage of the population because you have been selecting for that particular type of cell . 1315025_1331825
so the cancer cells vary in the frequency with which they metastasize and in this experiment we are selecting preferentially for those cells that do have that capability . 1332505_1340705
now although these experiments involve what I might call a gradual change in the cancer cell population induced by an artificial selection the experimenter is selecting for this generation after generation there is something similar that actually occurs in normal situations in people that have cancer . 1343025_1361505
and we refer to this as tumor progression . 1362225_1364645
(0.7) and this simply refers to the process by which the cellular composition of the tumor changes with time . 1371625_1381805
&=pause_while_writing and this concept is based on the notion that I've just introduced you to that cancer cell tumors cancer cell populations are heterogeneous populations of cells they're not all the same . 1404025_1414685
in the experiment we just saw we selected for the ability of cells to metastasize . 1415565_1419805
&-um in cancer patients sometimes you get that kind of selection for example you have a primary tumor and maybe very few of those cells can metastasize but some of them do say you have &~a a primary melanoma in the skin somewhere and it metastasizes to the liver a_couple_of them well those tumors that now grow up on the liver are cells that have the ability to metastasize . 1420425_1441565
so those secondary tumors can in turn metastasize and they'll do it at a much higher frequency because you'd already selected once so now you may get cancer cells all over the body that are quite different from the initial population in the primary tumor . 1441705_1455765
you've gotten a gradual progression change in the characteristics with time as metastasis has taken place . 1456145_1461905
&-uh this phenomenon may be especially important for understanding what happens &-uh during attempts to treat cancer with some of the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs that we're gonna talk about later in the semester . 1462825_1473765
and what you're gonna &~tr learn later in the semester but let me just give you a preview today is that cancer patients who are treated with chemotherapeutic drugs often go into what we call a remission . 1474465_1486505
and this word remission simply +... 1487285_1488865
refers to a temporary disappearance +... 1491825_1493665
of the disease . 1495365_1497745
temporary disappearance . 1498345_1499745
and we know it's temporary because that's what the word remission means . 1501465_1504005
if by some chance the drug actually cured the person and it never came back then we would call it a cure . 1504365_1509825
&-uh when it initially happens you don't know whether it's cure or remission doctors to be safe will usually initially say well the patient's gone into remission . 1510625_1518845
there's no sign of the tumor now . 1519075_1520815
we don't know whether it's a cure or not we'll have to wait you know five ten years maybe depending on how fast that tumor was growing and spreading to know whether it was actually a cure or just a remission . 1521195_1530515
unfortunately for people who already have metastases and were treated with chemotherapeutic drugs &-uh most of the time it's actually a remission that occurs . 1531015_1542135
it's rare that a single treatment of chemotherapeutic drugs will completely cure a patient of cancer . 1542575_1546915
why does the disease come back ? 1548225_1549685
well what happens is with the drug you kill maybe ninety nine point nine nine percent of the cancer cells but the point oh oh one percent of the cells left behind again it's not a random group that's left behind the cells that are left behind that weren't killed by the drug are cells that are inherently resistant to the effects of the drug . 1550525_1570065
so when that cancer cell population eventually grows back it's usually &-uh can't be successfully treated with that same initial drug . 1570665_1580525
so it's often when people have remission and then the cancer comes back it's often much much more difficult to treat them the second time because that population has undergone progression the cells are more aggressive these are now resistant to the drug (be)cause those are the ones you selected for . 1581265_1595105
remember at the end of the &~exper &-uh class last time &-uh we were looking at Folkman's experiment with endostatin . 1595845_1601405
and I said the remarkable thing about that experiment was remember he treated the cancer cells once in the animal with endostatin . 1601565_1608445
the tumor went away . 1609025_1610125
he removed the treatment for a while and let the tumor come back . 1610565_1613265
when the tumor came back the second time it was just as sensitive to treatment as it was the first time . 1613605_1618465
it wasn't resistant . 1619005_1620425
that's very unusual . 1620945_1621985
with most cancer drugs in fact the second time the tumor comes back it is resistant and it's because this phenomenon of &-uh tumor progression over time you are selecting for either the body or with drugs or with metastasis you are selecting for a more aggressive composition . 1622355_1638175
are there any questions on this phenomenon ? 1639595_1641395
it's often misunderstood so I wanna make sure it's clear to you yeah in back ? 1643235_1646835
&-um is tumor progression necessarily &-uh come with &-uh an enhanced grading remember how you graded the tumor it's microscopic . 1647945_1655145
that's a good question . 1655285_1656065
it's not exactly the same thing . 1656665_1658385
remember I told you that tumor grading was based solely on the way cancer cells look under the microscope what size of nuclei metallic index lots_of things that you see in the microscope . 1659005_1669285
those traits don't hafta change in order for you to select for a population that's resistant to a drug or can metastasize more readily those things tend not to show up under the microscope . 1669775_1680375
so often the tumor has progressed and it's it's quote unquote more aggressive and yet to you look at it under the microscope and it looks pretty much the same . 1681035_1687655
that's not always the case . 1688015_1689115
sometimes it will look different . 1689575_1691235
<it would> it would be great if it always looked different because then you could recognize it . 1691875_1694975
unfortunately it doesn't usually look different we're looking at different properties here . 1694885_1699085
(0.5) anything else ? 1700065_1703945
(0.4) okay well we've seen that the tumors are heterogeneous populations of cells they're not uniform but heterogeneous populations of cells only a tiny fraction of which are capable of carrying out this process of metastasis . 1704625_1721385
but you can select for those cells over time and get a population that eventually is enriched in those cells that carry out metastasis . 1721785_1729185
the next question I wanna address is how are these cells different ? 1729765_1733265
if we are selecting for cells that are more efficient at the process of metastasizing &-uh what makes that possible ? 1733765_1742185
how are they different at the fundamental molecular cellular level that they can in fact &-uh metastasize more readily ? 1742325_1747885
as I just indicated from my answer to that question it's not the way they look . 1748065_1751585
it's obviously gonna be something else . 1752365_1753985
well although we are far from being able to answer this question in detail it appears that surface properties properties of the surface membrane of a cancer cell have a_lot to do with whether or not it can efficiently metastasize . 1755845_1767525
now let me describe for you one simple experiment which makes this point . 1768025_1772385
this is on the next page I believe of the course pack . 1772685_1777905
(0.5) page twenty two . 1779395_1781135
(0.4) this experiment sort of picks up where the last one took off remember the experiment on page twenty one ended up with this cell line melanoma b@l sixteen f@l ten that metastasizes frequently . 1784215_1796195
so we've selected for these cells that are very very efficient in metastasizing now we're trying to find out why are we so good at it . 1796495_1802755
what is it about these cells ? 1802915_1804115
well if you take these cells and rupture them put (th)em into a big blender and you know or grind them or something like that to rupture the cells break them apart into their individual components isolate out the membranes using centrifugation to separate the membranes from the rest of the cell now remember +//. 1805435_1821695
not <from the rest of the cell> from the rest of the cell components we have no cells left at this point . 1822215_1825855
we have only isolated membranes . 1826315_1828035
clearly these by themselves are not cancer they can't grow these are not cells they're just membrane fragments . 1828475_1833375
but under certain experimental conditions we can kind_of promote the fusion of these membrane fragments to intact cells . 1834265_1843365
so let's take these membrane fragments and under these conditions fuse them to melanoma b@l sixteen f@l one cells . 1844105_1851625
remember that b@l sixteen f@l one cells were the first transplant generation from the preceding experiment . 1852365_1857445
these are cells that rarely metastasize . 1857905_1860425
so we're taking cells that are very inefficient at metastasizing and we're fusing into their plasma membranes membrane fragments pieces of membrane from cells that readily metastasize . 1860905_1871885
what do you end up getting ? 1872425_1873325
you end up getting cells that frequent metastasize . 1873685_1876285
so this clearly shows that the plasma membrane influences the ability to metastasize . 1876785_1882585
(0.13) so you change the membrane composition you change the ability of the cell to metastasize . 1895425_1900225
now why is that ? 1901145_1901965
what's going on here ? 1902065_1902885
well we don't know for sure &-uh but if you read the article that I assigned that you were supposed to read prior to today's lecture you know that we think that interaction between the immune system and this plasma membrane is somehow involved . 1903725_1917365
now for you to thoroughly understand these experiments you need to know a few basic things about the principles of immunology I assume that most of you know these but let me quickly review them just to make sure we're all on even footing here . 1918185_1929705
if you were to attempt to graft an organ a kidney or a heart or even a skin graft something like that from one person or another &-uh the recipient's immune system obviously this is a problem with heart transplants all the time with kidney transplants the person receiving the organ their immune system recognizes that organ as being foreign as coming from somewhere else . 1930505_1952825
and the immune system wants to attack that invading tissue in essence . 1953565_1958245
in order for heart transplants and kidney transplants to work the patients hafta be treated with drugs so+called immunosuppressant drugs which &-uh inhibit the immune system suppress the immune system so that their immune system will not in fact reject those tissues as being foreign . 1958705_1972905
the way the immune system normally attacks foreign tissues is using a special cell type called the t@l lymphocyte . 1974385_1981305
(0.5) the t@l lymphocyte is is the main component of the immune system which attacks foreign tissues foreign cells when they're introduced into the body . 1985385_1993585
and when they attack a foreign cell what signals them that they should be doing this is a composition of that foreign cell's plasma membrane . 1994525_2004225
it's something about the plasma membrane that the t@l lymphocytes recognize as being foreign . 2005105_2009445
and <part of what> &~rec part of what it recognizes not completely but part of what it recognizes is a plasma membrane glycoprotein . 2009985_2019505
(0.5) I assume you know what this term glycoprotein means it's a a protein that has some sugar roots attached to it the t@l lymphocyte recognizes a plasma membrane glycoprotein called the major histocompatibility complex . 2024965_2039525
&=pause_while_writing or MHC as we usually abbreviate it . 2052685_2053965
and again you should be familiar with this from the reading that you did for today's lecture . 2054405_2058125
in mice &-uh where the experiments I'm about to talk about took place in mice several different genes for MHC exist and depending on the cell type or of the inheritance &-uh how that mouse was bred who his parents were it may get different forms of the gene for MHC . 2059365_2079505
and these have been used to study the process of metastasis . 2080505_2084065
&-uh the experiments I'm about to describe to you actually I think were pretty well described in that course pack article so I will pretty quickly go over them with you and make sure you completely understand them . 2084705_2094525
remember in that article you read about two mouse cancer cell lines yeah turn to the page in the course pack yeah right &-uh this is now on page twenty two +... 2094945_2103085
remember you read about two cancer cell populations in mice . 2106045_2109865
the d@l one twenty two cells and the a@l nine cells . 2110445_2114005
remember that these two cancer cell lines differ in their ability to metastasize when you inject them into animals . 2115085_2120905
d@l one twenty two cells metastasize very very frequently a@l nine cells metastasize quite rarely . 2121305_2127325
these cell lines also differ in the ability of their ability to elicit an immune response . 2128655_2134495
if we just measure the ability of the recipient mouse's immune system see whether its t@l lymphocytes are attacking mounting a response against those cancer cells you find that the d@l one twenty two cells when injected elicit only a weak immune response while the a@l nine cells elicit a very strong immune response . 2134795_2153575
this goes along with the fact that these two cancer cell lines d@l one twenty two and a@l nine have different MHC genes being expressed . 2156675_2165395
so the d@l one twenty two cells have only the h@l two d@l form of MHC in their plasma membranes while the a@l nine cells have both the h@l two d@l form and the h@l two k@l form of the MHC molecule in their plasma membranes . 2167195_2182415
now if you were to just look at these experiments all you could really conclude is that a strong immune response &=pause_while_writing is correlated with +... 2184105_2202325
a low rate of metastasis . 2204705_2206265
&=pause_while_writing in other words the a@l nine cells that metastasize rarely that's correlated with a strong immune response vice versa if a weak immune response that's correlated with a high rate of metastasis . 2216345_2225105
but the key word here is correlation . 2225685_2227425
you cannot prove cause and effect here from this kind of observation . 2228185_2232725
if I were to have jumped to the conclusion that the immune strong immune response elicited by the a@l nine cell is responsible for their low rate of metastasis if I concluded that solely based on these data I would be committing the post_hoc fallacy . 2233305_2247225
the kind of fallacy we were talking about in discussion section last week . 2247685_2250605
the fallacy that when you see two things that go together A goes with B therefore concluding that A causes B . 2251025_2256445
clearly that's a logical fallacy . 2256745_2258445
it might be something else that's causing this low rate of metastasis other than the strong immune response . 2258865_2264985
so this is just a correlation . 2265425_2266405
how can we move from a correlation to a cause and effect proving that there really is a cause and effect relationship . 2267585_2273365
this is an important issue and something hopefully you've been thinking about this past week because I sort_of challenged you at the end of last week's discussion to think about +//. 2274145_2281605
how could you design a better experiment to show the relationship between birth control pill usage and cancer if there was in fact a relationship ? 2282825_2291485
how could you unequivocally show one way or another whether there was a cause and effect relationship ? 2291685_2295325
so you've hopefully been thinking about this and one of the things that you might have been thinking about is doing some experiments . 2295525_2302145
these are just passive observations . 2302365_2303825
you gotta do some experiments if you wanna prove cause and effect . 2305125_2307905
one of the experiments you again should have read about in the course pack article was this experiment . 2309795_2315255
(0.4) the d@l one twenty two cells remember metastasize very very frequently and that's the +//. 2318195_2324075
correlated with a weak immune response and we thought maybe the immune system has something to do with it . 2324655_2329075
well if the immune system does have something to do with it we could test that by changing the MHC gene being expressed in the d@l one twenty two cell . 2329435_2337475
so let's take these d@l one twenty two cells and transfect them with h@l two k@l DNA . 2338505_2343165
transfection is a technique +//. 2344345_2345445
if you haven't heard it about it from your biology background let me just quickly say <it's a> it's a laboratory method for introducing DNA into cells . 2345605_2353105
I'll talk more about it next week in &~m in more detail . 2353325_2355885
but it's just a way +//. 2356345_2357025
<it was> it was briefly described in the course pack article as well . 2357185_2359605
just a way to get foreign DNA into cells . 2359885_2361785
so we're getting this DNA coding for the h@l two k@l MHC gene into the d@l one twenty two cells . 2361785_2368565
as soon as we do that and inject those cells now back into mice now they metastasize quite rarely . 2369465_2376105
they're suddenly behaving like a@l nine cells . 2376965_2379405
in terms of their ability to metastasize . 2380385_2382785
and they now elicit a strong immune response . 2383205_2385825
just like the a@l nine cells . 2386505_2387725
so this is much more direct evidence to the fact that the immune system does in fact influence &=pause_while_writing the ability to metastasize . 2388385_2402645
&=pause_while_writing when we use the word influence we're talking cause and effect . 2403965_2412545
well we know now it's cause and effect because we've done an experiment . 2413065_2415765
we've changed the immune response by changing the MHC gene that's being expressed on the surface of those cells the MHC protein that's being expressed once we do that the immune system now recognizes the D d@l one twenty two cells it attacks them just like it attacked the a@l nine cells and drives down their rate of metastasis . 2416095_2434875
so the immune response the ability of the immune system to recognize and potentially destroy cancer cells clearly can interfere with their ability to metastasize . 2435225_2444585
these experiments clearly show that . 2444965_2446985
but is the immune system the only factor involved ? 2448185_2452365
or are there other variables that influence the ability to metastasize ? 2452965_2456925
well there was one more very clever experiment described in the course pack article involving the use of immunosuppressed animals . 2457575_2464515
if you wanna find out whether or not the immune response differences in the immune response is the only variable influencing the rate of metastasis the way to test that is to inject cancer cells by comparison into immunosuppressed animals . 2465395_2478815
these are animals that have been treated with drugs that suppress their immune system or there are strains of animals that have an inherently defective immune system either way we're dealing with &~immune immunosuppressed animals which cannot mount an immune response . 2479035_2493575
if the immune response were the only thing determining whether cancer cells can metastasize or not then the difference between the d@l one twenty two behavior and the a@l nine behavior in terms of metastasis oughta be completely obliterated in immunosuppressed animals right ? 2495825_2510805
if the only reason that they're behaving differently in rates of metastasis is because they elicit different immune responses then you get rid of the immune response you should get rid of the difference . 2511365_2521525
and those two cell lines should metastasize at the same rate . 2521745_2524465
notice that that's not what happens . 2525265_2526985
the d@l one twenty two cells still metastasize at their initially high rate as you would expect this tells you the immune system is basically not capable under these conditions of attacking the d@l one twenty two cells . 2527825_2539565
the a@l nine cells in the immunosuppressed animals remember in normal animals they gave you a low rate of metastasis now they go to a medium rate of metastasis they metastasize more frequently telling you that the immune system was in fact inhibiting their ability to metastasize but they still don't metastasize as_well_as d@l one twenty two . 2541385_2561905
&~fo so this suggests that there are additional factors that the immune system yes is one factor but there are other factors as well that can differentiate between different cell populations in terms of their ability to metastasize . 2563545_2575465
any questions on this set of experiments ? 2576845_2579105
(0.5) clear ? 2580705_2593405
if you have any any trouble at all when you go over your notes trying to follow what's going here again this set of experiments is pretty well described in the course pack article that I assigned <to take home> . 2586125_2595665
(0.4) okay . 2596605_2600065
so we've now talked in detail about the first two steps in the process of metastasis . 2600445_2604745
we talked about the ability of cancer cells to invade through surrounding tissues in terms of penetrating the vessels . 2605525_2613165
and now we just talked about the transport of cancer cells via the bloodstream &-uh to distant sites of the body . 2613665_2619785
and we've seen that most of the cancer cells die along the way , most of them don't make it . 2620425_2624465
and clearly the immune system is part of the explanation for why all the cells don't make it . 2624985_2629925
the immune system can clearly attack cells along the way but there must be some other factors involved as well . 2629965_2634625
this now brings us to the third step in the process of metastasis and that is the ability of cancer cells to reinvade and grow at various sites . 2635475_2644795
&=pause_while_writing now I'm gonna say at specific sites and you'll see why I use this particular word in the next few minutes . 2662725_2667505
what determines where cancer cells will actually end up reinvading into the tissue somewhere else setting up housekeeping and forming an actual metastasis . 2668585_2677985
turns out that there are two different factors that play a role here . 2678845_2683485
one of (th)em is pure topography . 2684005_2685765
it's based on the anatomy of the circulatory system . 2685985_2689045
&=pause_while_writing and if you'll turn to page twenty four in the course pack I've got a diagram here to help you understand +... 2703785_2712065
what's going on +... 2714765_2715465
this is pure geography we're talking about . 2717825_2720005
and we're gonna talk about three potential locations where primary tumors might arise there are only three I should say or three major categories of places where tumors can arise . 2722295_2733495
now let's start off with the broadest category which is category one down here which is called body tissues and organs and that literally means every tissue and organ in the body where cancer cells can arise with the exception of the lungs and the stomach and intestines (be)cause the lungs and stomach and intestines behave a little differently than we'll see in a few moments . 2734345_2755165
so let's talk about <with the> majority of the organs in the body let's say an individual had an osteosarcoma in the leg bone for example . 2755865_2762065
where are those cells likely to metastasize to ? 2763095_2765915
well as you saw in step one they're gonna +//. 2766875_2769895
cancer cells as they invade through the bone are eventually gonna encounter blood vessels somewhere and the blood vessel they're &~li most likely to invade into is gonna be a very tiny capillary (be)cause it's got the thinnest wall . 2770455_2783935
so it invades into the capillaries and the capillaries immediately +//. 2784955_2787655
now the fluid flow the blood flow will be going towards the small veins and the small veins feed into the larger veins which feed into the larger veins and finally end up in the right chamber of the heart . 2787885_2797285
so we're going into bigger and bigger plumbing . 2797905_2799725
okay we're starting out with cancer cells in a very very narrow tube going into bigger and bigger plumbing where there's more and more room for them and so we end up in the right side of the heart . 2799965_2807965
from the right side of the heart these cancer cells in along with the blood are gonna be pumped into the lungs . 2808465_2814105
in the lungs the pulmonary arteries break up into a series of veins so the blood &-uh in a series of capillaries so that the blood can become oxygenated . 2814865_2823465
so we go back down to very very very tiny vessels again . 2824125_2828125
which is the way we started . 2828485_2829325
well when we started down here in capillaries of_course the cancer cell was burrowing a hole into the vessel &-uh through its protease and so forth when it gets back here back into capillaries it's possible +//. 2830005_2841465
certainly the cancer cell's gonna be slowed down and often the diameter of a cancer cell is such that it's gonna &~ver have a very hard time fitting through a capillary . 2841485_2850205
and if you have a happen to have a_couple_of cancer cells sticking together it will be almost impossible for them to pass through the capillary . 2850585_2856625
so this is the first place where the cancer cells are gonna have a hard time getting through the plumbing because the plumbing has gotten so small so narrow . 2857565_2865705
so for most cancers that arise in the various body tissues and organs other than the lung and the stomach and intestines for most cancers the first place they're likely to get hung up is in the lung . 2867545_2878685
so the first place you would tend to look for metastases in &~th is in the lungs . 2879985_2883485
and the lungs are in fact a major site for metastases for many kinds of cancers . 2883865_2888565
what about for tumors that start in the stomach and intestines the so+called gastrointestinal tract ? 2890385_2895305
here again the cancer cells will infiltrate into very tiny capillaries which will feed in the small veins which go into larger veins which go into yet larger veins but these veins will then enter the liver . 2896675_2907155
and in the liver they will break up back into a capillary bed . 2907735_2911155
&-uh the purpose of this being for the exchange of the the nutrients that have been taken up and detoxification and so forth . 2911835_2916755
all kinds of things hafta happen <in the> in the liver . 2917075_2919835
and the blood supply therefore breaks stuff into these little tiny capillaries in the liver so you can have the various exchange of molecules that needs to take place there . 2919945_2927305
but lo and behold you have the same problem that you had before in the lungs . 2927785_2930525
these cancer cells now are likely to be as big as or bigger than the diameter of these capillaries and therefore likely to get hung up and stuck . 2930965_2939065
so the most common site or one of the most common sites for stomach cancer and colon cancer to metastasize to is the liver . 2939905_2947365
because that's the first capillary bed those cells encounter . 2948365_2952185
finally what about lung cancer ? 2953445_2954985
in ways lung cancer's the worse scenario of all we've talked about the terrible prognosis for lung cancer and here's one of the reasons that lung cancer has such a terrible prognosis . 2956145_2966225
kills so many people within five years . 2966805_2968965
a cancer starting out in the lungs will go into these capillaries . 2970765_2973585
the blood flow will then push them into the vessels . 2974125_2975945
they get bigger and bigger as they go into the left chamber of the heart . 2976555_2980855
from the left chamber of the heart &-uh the vessel gets even bigger . 2981455_2985015
it's pumped out into the aorta the huge vessel . 2985175_2987315
cancer cells have no problem . 2987775_2988995
they're gonna be pumped all over the body through all the arteries of the body . 2989455_2993655
they'll be distributed everywhere and everywhere they go they will eventually encounter a capillary bed . 2993815_3000855
okay ? 3001615_3001975
they could end up in here they could end up in the stomach and intestines they could end up in the liver they could end up in all the body tissues and organs so lung cancer is a very very nasty actor . 3002315_3011615
because its cells immediately are pumped out into the entire circulatory system and get access to capillary beds where they get stuck all over the body . 3012475_3019875
so anatomy is the first factor the basic anatomy of the circulatory system is the first factor that determines where cancer cells are gonna metastasize . 3021785_3030805
but those simple rules those three rules I just gave to you aren't the whole story . 3032105_3036545
how do I know they're not the whole story ? 3037945_3039565
let's look at another experiment . 3040665_3042345
and there's an experiment on page twenty five in the course pack . 3043665_3048745
(0.8) if you take mouse melanoma cells like the ones we've been talking about today inject them into the tail vein of a mouse what's likely to happen ? 3054465_3064625
well from the diagram on page twenty four you know from the veins you get eventually pumped into the &-uh right side of the heart from the right side of the heart you get &-uh the &~cel the cells are pumped into the lungs where it breaks up into the capillary bed so we do expect these cells initially to get hung up in the lung . 3065005_3080725
and in fact if you look one or two days after you've injected those cancer cells in the lungs you will find lots_of cancer cells lodged in the lungs . 3081785_3090425
if you wait two to three weeks for actual metastases not just individual cells but metastases to grow up solid tumor modules that you can see and actual tumors in fact you get lots_of these tumors in the lung . 3090845_3102205
as you would expect from the rules that I just gave you . 3102505_3105025
but you're gonna see now when we looked at the right side of this experiment that those rules weren't the whole explanation for what just happened . 3106545_3113425
let's do another experiment with the same exact cell type but inject them into the left ventricle of the heart . 3114565_3120405
as you see from the diagram on twenty four if you inject cells or cells cancer cells that are in the left chamber of the heart from there they are pumped out into the aorta which means that they are pumped out from the arteries all over the body and so like lung cancer cells themselves you would expect those to get lodged all over the body . 3121305_3139005
and in fact within the first day or two if you look under the microscope at various tissues you can find cancer cells lodged in various tissues throughout the body . 3139565_3148605
but if you come back two or three weeks later to see well where are tumors actually growing where are metastases actually occurring they're occurring almost predominately almost entirely in the lung . 3150065_3162185
so this tells us it's not just the anatomy of the circulatory system . 3164305_3167325
there's something else going on here . 3167745_3169425
okay not just the circulatory system there seems to be something about these mouse melanoma cells don't overgeneralize there seems to be something about these mouse melanoma cells that allows them to preferentially grow in the lung even though they've lodged everywhere in the body they only seem to grow well in the lung . 3170585_3189225
there's some kind of affinity some kind of hospitality going on there . 3189565_3194565
these melanoma cells like the lung . 3195025_3196885
it's not just that the +//. 3197345_3198045
it was first place they stopped it wasn't just the first motel they checked into there was something nice about that place so whether it was the first place or not they end up occupying the lung . 3197985_3208425
so this gives us a second principle that determines the sites at which cancer cells are gonna grow in terms of metastases . 3209045_3218965
the second principle which we can conclude from that experiment is that some cancer cells +... 3219665_3224485
prefer to grow +... 3227505_3228345
at specific sites +... 3231805_3232925
that's why I put the specific sites in this third stage . 3235725_3238525
some cancer cells prefer to grow at specific sites certain sites . 3239325_3242905
some kind of we think biochemical affinity there's just something about the molecules and environment there in certain tissues that certain kinds of tumor cells like to grow there . 3244885_3254185
now if that's true it raises a very interesting question . 3255905_3259005
is this the same for all cancer cells ? 3259585_3261445
I've only shown you experiments thus far for melanoma and we haven't even looked at all melanoma cells we've just looked at melanomas in in this gross sense and found that as a total population they seem to preferentially like the lung . 3261605_3274745
but is that true for all melanoma cells do all melanoma cells prefer the lung ? 3275125_3279025
or do some melanoma cells like other places ? 3279725_3282765
now there's been some very clever experiments carried out to address this question if you'll turn to page twenty six in the course pack (0.6) you'll see an experiment here which is a variation on the theme of the experiment described on page twenty one . 3284145_3303665
I urge you to make a note in your notes not to confuse experiments on page twenty one and twenty six . 3305105_3311025
they look very similar to each_other they both involve these sequential selections and transplantations but the conclusions that are drawn are significantly different because the experiment is done in a somewhat different way . 3311475_3323715
so make sure you don't confuse the experiment on twenty one the experiment I'm now about to go over . 3324415_3330835
in this experiment they took +//. 3332035_3334175
some some mouse melanoma cells were taken and injected into the tail vein of the mice just male mice just like the experiment <on twenty one> on twenty one we focused on the lung . 3334795_3344275
we saw that metastases occurred initially few in the lung and we selected those and enriched for those . 3344635_3350395
here we're gonna do something a little different . 3350955_3352375
it's true that metastases occur mainly in the lung . 3353215_3356775
remember when you start off I said you only maybe got one or two of those . 3357455_3360835
so you get many many more metastases in the lung than you will in the brain and ovary . 3362345_3366725
and you may have to look at dozens and dozens of mice before you'll find one where there's a single metastasis in the brain or a single metastasis in the ovary . 3366845_3375145
so these metastases to these organs are much less frequent than to the lung . 3375805_3380105
is this just a random fluke did they just happen to get stuck occasionally in the brain and and it ended up growing there or was there something special about those cells ? 3381185_3389045
well let's do now our sequential transplantation with cancer cells from these two different organs . 3390075_3394995
start out with the brain . 3395535_3396335
we'll take that one brain metastasis that we found by scouring you know through thirty or forty mice . 3396815_3401495
take that one brain metastasis remove it inject it into another mouse . 3401895_3405695
into the tail vein . 3406315_3406875
again you'll find metastases predominantly in the lung but every once in a while you'll find one in the brain or the ovary . 3407535_3414115
this time you might find them a little more frequently in the brain than you had the first time . 3415555_3419695
let's take the metastases from the brain again take those cancer cells isolate them inject them into another mouse . 3420475_3425495
and repeat this over ten times in a row . 3425975_3428035
you repeat it ten times in a row and you will end up with a cell population that metastasizes mainly to the brain . 3428715_3436595
metastasizes more frequently to the brain than to the lungs +... 3436895_3439395
you do the parallel set of experiments with the ovarian metastases you get a comparable result . 3441945_3446225
eventually you can select for cells that metastasize mainly to the ovary . 3446765_3450605
they metastasize more frequently to the ovary than they do to the lung and certainly way more frequently to the ovary these would metastasize to the brain . 3451605_3458625
so this tells you that cancer cells vary in the sites to which they preferentially metastasize . 3460265_3465865
&=pause_while_writing again not all cancer cells are not the same . 3489245_3491465
we saw earlier that all cancer cells were not the same in terms of their ability to metastasize the frequency with which they metastasize . 3492265_3498605
now we see that they're not all the same in terms of the sites to which they like to metastasize . 3499005_3502785
so from a single cancer cell population you can isolate subsets subpopulations of cells that preferentially metastasize to different organs . 3503225_3512405
now remember when we talked about the question of why some cells metastasize more frequently than others &-uh I described to you some experiments which indicated that properties of the plasma membranes appear to be involved in determining the frequency or influencing the frequency with which cancer cells metastasize . 3513455_3530095
although the evidence isn't quite as good in this case there's also some evidence suggesting that differences in the plasma membrane help to determine which organ a cancer cell likes to metastasize to . 3531355_3545095
so we've seen with the melanoma we can isolate &-uh cancer cells that metastasize to the lung those that like the liver &-uh those that like the ovary those that like the brain and if you look at the plasma membranes of those three different subsets of cancer cells in that population their plasma membranes look somewhat different not under the microscope in terms of their biochemical makeup . 3545055_3565015
so it appears to be interactions between the plasma membrane and components of these different target tissues be it brain ovary or lung that causes cancer cells of different types to preferentially metastasize to one organ or another . 3565545_3579925
so the plasma membrane appears to influence not just the frequency with which cells metastasize but also where &=audio_disturbance generally . 3580365_3590825
now once cancer cells have picked the appropriate site either from just being lodged there to the anatomy of the circulatory system or through some more preferential mechanism some kind of biochemical affinity which helps them to grow at a certain site once this has happened &-uh there are again some other factors that come into play that determine whether or not extensive growth will take place +... 3589945_3616845
extensive growth of metastases requires a couple things &=pause_while_writing the first thing it requires is angiogenesis . 3620825_3635285
the process we talked last time . 3637745_3639285
just like primary tumors which must somehow trigger switch the balance between angiogenesis stimulaters and inhibitors tip that balance towards stimulation to trigger the formation of blood supply in_order_to grow beyond a millimeter or two in diameter the same thing is true of distant metastases . 3640635_3657335
they must tip that balance in the favoring of angiogenesis at the distant site before they can grow beyond a millimeter or two in diameter . 3657975_3665695
and remember you have this complicating factor that if there's a large primary tumor somewhere else in the body if that large primary tumor is producing large amounts of angiostatin which can spill over into the bloodstream unlike these other regulators of angiogenesis that angiostatin can circulate throughout the body and show up at one of these sites where there's a little tiny tumor nodule . 3666485_3686485
and that little tumor nodule with this massive amount of angiostatin in the &~cirulat circulation will not necessarily be able to overpower that inhibition . 3686625_3694965
and so you may have these silent nodules of a millimeter or two for long periods of time until something triggers that balance for net angiogenesis +... 3695585_3705345
so the molecules that &~regu &~regu regulate angiogenesis clearly play a role . 3707745_3711645
another family of molecule that appear to play a role are growth factors . 3712235_3716675
I'm not saying that +//. 3717535_3720755
unlike angiogenesis which is always required I'm not implying that growth factors are always required but they may play a role . 3721235_3727875
they may play a role . 3728295_3728975
now just to make sure that you're clear on what a growth factor is if you'll turn to page twenty seven +... 3729835_3734895
of the course pack +...
I've briefly outlined for you here what a growth factor is &-uh first of all these are nonnutritional . 3740555_3748335
you think think of things making you grow often you'll think of nutrients these are not nutrients . 3749395_3753375
these are not nutrients . 3754315_3755135
these are protein molecules but very specific kinds of protein molecules that stimulate the growth and division of particular cell types . 3756335_3766035
they don't nondiscriminately just stimulate the growth of any cell type but there are different growth factors which selectively stimulate the growth of certain kinds of cells . 3766795_3775035
for example there's a growth factor called epidermal growth factor or EGF protein that stimulates the growth of epithelial cells . 3775975_3782575
there's a growth factor called platelet derived growth factor PPGF plays an important role in wound healing . 3783235_3788555
&-uh stimulates predominantly the growth growth of fibroblasts . 3789295_3792075
&-uh you've not heard of either of those before . 3792665_3795025
I'm not gonna hold you responsible for those two yet at this part of the course . 3795525_3798825
later in the semester later we're gonna come back talk about these in some detail so at that point I'll hold you responsible for them . 3798825_3804225
but notice that there are a couple fibroblast growth factor FGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF . 3804605_3812165
these are ones you already know about . 3812565_3813845
these are ones I will hold you responsible for knowing about in this part of the course because those are ones that stimulate the growth of blood vessels amongst other things and therefore these are the growth factors that regulate the process of angiogenesis . 3814945_3828445
so the only two you read in this list that you really have to know about right now are these two that regulate angiogenesis . 3828885_3835085
how do different growth factors manage to selectively turn on the growth and division of specific cell types ? 3837075_3843455
the answer is that different cell types have different kinds of receptor molecules on their plasma membrane surfaces . 3844155_3851735
these are proteins expressed on the surface of cells depending on the receptor that you have on a cell it will bind to different kinds of growth factors so I've tried to illustrate this by having a complementary shape between a surface on this growth factor and this receptor on the surface of this cell . 3851815_3869355
so this growth factor will only bind to cells that contain this particular kind of receptor . 3870255_3875635
the receptor for that specific growth factor . 3876075_3878015
and the binding of the growth factor to that receptor will send a signal through the cell . 3878875_3883715
and by the way later in the semester we're gonna talk an awful lot about all the steps involved in transmitting that signal because the transmission of that signal is intimately associated with the loss of control of growth in cancer cells . 3884295_3895515
so we're gonna come back to this later in the semester and talk a_lot about this pathway in detail . 3895795_3900175
but for the moment it'll be just be sort_of a black box we won't talk about the individual steps . 3900275_3904115
growth factor binds to a specific receptor it sends a signal into the cell which ultimately triggers the division of that cell . 3904735_3911635
now if you read the course pack article closely you will perhaps recall or maybe not but you should &~go be able to go back and find it the d@l one twenty two cell line behaves a little different regarding growth factor from the a@l nine . 3913795_3933655
remember the d@l one twenty two that was the one that metastasized more frequently than the a@l nine . 3934055_3940515
remember although the immune system played some role that when we injected d@l one twenty two and a@l nine cells into immunosuppressed animals to get rid of the immune response as a variable even though we got rid of the immune response as a variable d@l one twenty two still metastasized somewhat better than a@l nine . 3941805_3958865
&-uh there wasn't as great a difference as before but it still metastasized somewhat better . 3959625_3964045
so there must be an additional difference between d@l one twenty two and a@l nine other than the difference in the MHC which enhances the immune response . 3964425_3972325
I can now tell you that this other difference is the fact that there's a gene called the &{l=PRON__PHONfims FMS &}l=PRON__PHONfims gene FMS &=pause_while_writing which has become activated in the d@l one twenty two cells but not in the a@l nine cells . 3973185_3989505
now what is the significance of this gene ? 3990605_3992385
this particular gene &=pause_while_writing codes for a growth factor receptor . 3993835_4002215
&=pause_while_writing remember the receptor is the molecule on the surface of the cell to which a growth factor binds therefore triggering that cell to grow and divide . 4004135_4014775
so the d@l one twenty two cells have a higher concentration of growth factor receptor on the cell surface . 4016585_4024345
this means that for a given concentration of growth factor in the tissue the a@l nine cell which has fewer growth factor receptors isn't gonna be influenced as much , isn't gonna have its growth stimulated as much as the d@l one twenty two cells . 4024885_4039105
because they have more a higher concentration of growth factor receptor . 4039505_4042225
therefore their growth will be stimulated more in the presence of the same concentration of growth factor . 4042205_4047385
any question on this set of observations ? 4047985_4051885
(0.7) &-uh-&-uh okay ?
okay then I wanna remind you that there are three steps as we've seen in the <process of angiogenes &-uh sorry> process of metastasis . 4055345_4070425
&-uh there's penetration &-uh of surrounding &~triss tissue infiltration invasion of surrounding tissues and penetration of the blood vessels was step one . 4070225_4079525
&-uh transport by the circulatory system to distant sites influenced by the immune system and other factors are step two . 4080405_4086345
reinvasion and growth finally of the distant site was step three . 4087025_4090225
what I want to emphasize to you about the existence of these multiple steps not only do we have multiple steps but remember we have multiple variables influencing each one of those steps impacting each one of those steps . 4091205_4102525
so we have a very complex cascade of events taking place in the process of metastasis and only a small number of cancer cells can successfully go through every one of those stages and exhibit all of those properties that you need in_order_to get through all the steps in the process of metastasis . 4103225_4120065
and that's why very very few cancer cells actually successfully metastasize . 4121245_4125765
a very very tiny fraction of a &~can cancer cell population successfully metastasizes . 4126005_4130005
I mean if a person had you know a hundred metastases that would be considered to be an enormous number . 4131285_4137745
but you've got tumors that have millions and millions if not billions of cells in them . 4138365_4142065
so only a very very tiny fraction of cells successfully gets through that complex series of events . 4142585_4148045
the important point , the important take+home lesson here , is that if we could successfully interfere with just one of these steps just one of these things that I talked about today +... 4148705_4158705
if you could stop the motility of the cancer cell in stage one +... 4158825_4161905
if you could inhibit the production of proteases or interfere with their action +... 4162385_4165385
&-uh if could promote the interaction of the immune system +... 4166065_4167945
if you could influence any one of those steps to the detriment of the cancer cell to the detriment of the cascade then metastasis would not take place and if metastasis didn't &~pla take place cancer wouldn't be a disease that we'd hafta worry about . 4168345_4181925
okay that concludes what I wanted to say about metastases and I promised you I would occasionally let you go early this semester and today's one such day but next time we'll talk about more properties of cancer . 4183645_4212525
