Ok, the way I usually do this is start at the beginning where the
ok .
it's organized pretty well .
so, start with talking, uh, about the difference between
ok .
I figure we can skip like the definitions off hypothesis and stuff .
you wanna tell me, uh, the big difference between the two ?
uh huh .
the correlation is not manipulated .
the experimental is ?
uh huh .
the correlation is observing it .
right .
the experimental is controlling the independent variable .
uh huh .
ok .
that's fine .
uh huh .
umm, there's some problems with both .
they're not both perfect .
umm .
generally we find the experimental more powerful, but a lot of
um, out of, you can't control for the variable .
uh huh .
so, that makes our correlational &=mumbles .
it's important to be aware of some of the problems in interpreting
there's really two problems with correlational design .
two that ones come screaming out at you .
uh, that variable that, that you don't know about .
uh huh, the third variable problem .
uh huh .
and um uh, I can't remember, uh, what it is .
it has to do with the xxx .
cause and effect .
uh huh .
it has to do with the direction of the causality .
so, you have two variables .
you have A and B .
and, you know, from statistics that you perform on it that they
seven .
seven .
that meaning that the two are related .
uh huh .
but you're not sure um, let's see this is marital status
seven .
ok .
and you say, well look, um, single people are more likely to get
&=mumbles .
yeah .
um, we got a .
seven .
we don't know whether um being single or your marital status causes
single .
single .
or whether, um .
something else did .
yeah .
say, you have poor interpersonal skills and you never got married .
maybe that might, and also +...
age would .
yeah !
maybe age had something to do with it, too .
some third variable, you'd look very dumb if you didn't get
some third variable that, uh .
ok .
the experimental method seeks to reduce some of the am, ambiguities
uh huh .
and it does this by holding one variable steady and measuring it
uh huh .
and it and in that way, you're determining the causality .
hopefully .
there's a philosophical argument in there that you're not really .
yeah .
but supposedly, you're determining causality .
and the way that you eliminate the third variable problem in an
random samples .
right .
that's the key, but essentially the groups, when you randomize,
uh huh .
and ?
that's hard to conceive .
it is .
it is .
but it does work .
I heard, um, Doc, the &=mumbles by Dr .
graesser's explanation of the number of sand things in the person's
uh huh .
and the larger your group is, xxx randomize .
&=mumbles .
the more xxx there is .
so, we will, um, if the two groups havve been randomized, that
ok, on that, that, that table that we used yesterday, that
with the random numbers in it ?
yeah .
I don't, what, uh, I, I wasn't con, real sure of the conception of
what do they do, just put a whole bunch of numbers in there ?
I don't know .
is there one in this book ?
uh huh I know that he would, we had some assistants up on the
and that, and you'd just keep going until you find that number .
how did they come, they, here it is .
page two hundred and sixty .
uh huh .
how, how did they get to this ?
how did they find these numbers .
I mean, how do you get this table made up ?
umm .
you don't know .
some, I don't know .
but it's just there .
and like you, you keep going and you randomly pick something and
yeah, there's, there's some way that you figure to which block that
umm, maybe you gotta roll a dice or something .
uh huh .
until you figure out which block, using a roll of dice &=mumbles .
well, this is the, the thing that all researchers use this as far
no, I don't think there's just one random number table .
I think it's just, most, most people use now are computers .
they're good at throwing out just random numbers .
yeah .
so, you'll sit at your computer, and hit a key, and it will throw
yeah .
that's, that's very sensible .
&=laughs .
mmm .
much more so than this table .
yeah .
I know, I'm not exactly sure how they, uh, how these are supposed
yeah .
I'm spoiled .
&=laughs .
yeah .
yeah .
I'm sure that helps .
as far as how they generate these things +...
as far as how they generate these things +...
I'm sure they worked on it .
just like the others .
yeah .
if it's not by computer, I couldn't tel you .
yeah .
they would, a, a person, if they weren't, that didn't have this
the same principle .
uh huh !
that's exactly it .
um, alright .
ok, independent and dependent variables, we pretty much touched on
um, xxx .
uh, what was the, the independent is the one that you control and
uh huh .
you're trying to find out if there is, if it does affect it .
right .
&=mumbles .
and I just want to point that the book mentions that your
uh huh .
I want to make sure that &=mumbles traditionally .
um, I'm just gonna skip the argument on causality .
they talk about in there the necessary and sufficient .
uh huh .
remember that ?
that, well, no, go over it .
ok, what they said ws uh, what most psychologists assume when they
and the, and the example they use is just a car .
so, if the key starts the car, and you turn the key and the car
uh huh .
so, it's necessary to turn the key so that the car has sufficient
the key is sufficient to start the car, but is it necessary ?
you could hotwire it and start the car that way .
or on the other hand, you could turn the key and the car won't
ok .
so, that's jus a philosophical argument and what they're trying to
it's also very rare to see anybody say something causes something
it's hard to imagine, um, an always when it comes to human
uh huh .
&=mumbles .
right .
my xxx .
xxx if everybody didn't, everybody 'd be a robot .
yeah It also predicts stuff xxx .
ok, um .
there are some problems with the experimental method .
it's not perfect .
and you want to tell me about, what you might, what might be some
um .
probably when the researcher goofs up .
uh huh .
what is that called ?
well, specifically, it, it's called reactivity .
yeah .
and, uh, specifically, you see sometimes, uh, demand
when you think it's biased ?
uh huh .
look, look, looking for what it, what you want to see .
uh huh .
um .
long term, was that &=mumbles ?
mmm, not necessarily .
&=mumbles correlational method &=mumbles the experimental .
um, one problem with the experimental method is that it's almost
and if you get somebody in a laboratory .
uh huh .
and you're trying to study their behavior, the, their behavior
the term for that is artificiality .
yeah, Ok .
and another problem, well, a way to overcome that artificiality is
and that's when you observe and manipulate things in the
say, you're studying maybe helping behavior and you have a
and that's your manipulation .
and, you know, there's all sorts of examples of, uh, somebody maybe
and that's an example of a field study where they try to, uh,
but, a lot of times in the real world, you can't control for all
uh huh .
in the lab, you can pretty much control for all the variables,
so, you're saying you really, in, in the artificial part, you're in
is that, is that really the real world ?
right, right .
some experiments .
it doesn't matter .
right .
it just doesn't matter, because .
it depends on what you're looking at .
what you're looking at an action &=mumbles in all ways be pretty
uh huh .
and all ways not .
if you're looking at, you know, an attitudes type thing, that might
yeah .
there's a real famous study by Milgram with a machine shocking
yeah .
it was real controversial .
yeah .
studying compliance .
and um, one of the criticisms was that people complied because he
&=mumbles .
uh, K, another problem with the experimental studies um falls under
yeah, if it's &=mumbles .
uh huh .
a lot of times &=mumbles in a good experimental design, you have a
um, is it ethical to withhold treatment from one if you give it
yeah .
that's a big problem with &=mumbles .
huh !
a work study program, a training program for certain people and
they were a control group and they wanted to compare them and how
that's wrong .
uh huh .
a way around that is to put somebody in a waiting, on a waiting
yeah .
and compare them that way .
uh huh .
it's still not perfect, because they're expecting treatment that
but now, now, when you, when you have a control group and they,
well, if you're giving them a placebo ?
uh huh .
they don't know that .
right .
but just being in the experiment could make a difference .
can't make a difference in the physical part .
hmm .
but it could in an emotional way ?
well, if you .
do you have to take that into consideration ?
sure !
you know, if it's, if they're not, if you're giving a placebo and
uh huh .
you know, they're just gonna get sicker .
yeah .
unless you give them to everyone .
it's just, it's not ethical .
yeah .
another problem we have with the experimental is you are trying to
you can't um manipulate social economic status .
you don't manipulate sex .
you can't manipulate age, because they're all part of the person .
um, you can't assign somebody to be married, or single, or
you can't assign somebody who abuses the child or not abuses the
these are all called subject variables .
well, wait, you can't assign them, but that doesn't mean they can't
right .
I mean, experience it .
oh, right .
yeah, but, I don't understand what you mean .
well, you have this um whole group of people uh your subject
you can't take the subjects, divide them in half randomly, and make
because you don't know if they are .
well, yeah, you can't, that's just something you can't do .
uh huh .
you can't, because they're adults, you can't make them aused child
uh huh .
the way to do it is to go out and find abused children, but then
but isn't that a choice group or was it something else we studied
do you, somethin' we talked about yesterday, it seemed like there
well, what I said, yeah, but it wouldn't be random .
you couldn't randomly assign .
well, could you, you say go and then randomly assign one group to
yeah .
ok .
yeah, if they've all been sexually abused .
&=mumbles .
then you, then you could do it random .
yeah, but you can't manipulate that particular variable .
yeah .
ok .
another thing the book talks about is uh &=mumbles but it fits
let's touch on that real quick .
I don't know if he taught that or not .
0 .
but we don't have much on it .
what it is um it's validity of predictive success .
so, for example, a lot of psychology is trying to predict
uh huh .
of college performance .
well, you say, well, it's high in criterion validity .
it um, it predicts well .
uh huh .
that stuff takes time to know that it does predict well .
yeah .
&=mumbles .
what page is that on ?
I xxx .
um, hold on .
xxx there we go, it's on forty five, page forty five .
under successful predictors &=mumbles .
ok .
let's move on and start talking about some actual experimental
um, before we do, why don't we define um confounding .
that will, we're gonna be talking about that a lot .
confounding .
that's, it's the variable that's not there .
I mean, we, we're not measuring ?
I don't know what that is .
well, what it is is it's, when you say uh, It's some
see, normally, we have your independent variable, we want to say it
uh huh .
that's our goal .
Um, what a confound is, is something other than this
like we were talking about with the cancer and the .
uh huh !
the a +/.
uh huh .
ok, ok .
yep .
so, it'll just be more clear when we start making more concrete
um, first, they describe a few, what they call “poor experimental
and the first one is the one shot case study .
and I'm, I'm a big one for liking like to diagram these things .
real simply .
and the way I conceptualize the one shot case study .
is this .
and wherever, wherever I use x@l is the treatment and o@l is an
so, in this design, you would give your treatment and you would
so, for example, I would Um yell at my child and see how that,
uh huh .
and this is a real poor study because we have a@l we don't any
uh huh .
so, this one shot, uh, yeah, one shot case study is very weak .
you almost never see anything like that design published which is
um, a little bit better design is the one group pretest posttest
that's a little bit better .
that's where you observe the child before you yell at him .
you observe the child, you yell at him, and then see what behavior
alright, now what does that have to do with that ABA, is that the
uh huh .
we'll get to that .
ok, 'cause that's what's confusing .
yeah, it, oh, it, it's similar .
it's similar .
so, just forget about it .
forget about it now .
ok .
that'll make more sense when we get to it later .
but um, so, you can see here how you have an indication of
and on the surface, it seems like it's a pretty good idea .
but you have no control group to look at .
uh huh .
first of all, um, and second of all, this is going over the
and there's a lot of things that can happen between point A and
for example, um, a person comes into your lab and fills out a
and you want to see um how, how good this new therapy you're doing
so, they come in and fill out the thing to see how depressed they
you give them the therapy .
they come back next week .
before they come back, they've had a car accident and they totaled
when you do an observation, you find that this is
you find a significant, significant change, you know, in the wrong
and it had nothing to do what so ever with the treatment .
and um .
an example would be observing the child and then yelling at him and
uh huh !
somebody, Ok, where you, we uh, observe the child, we yell at them,
or she's lookin' for somethin(g) .
yeah, she's lookin' for some, nothing real specific .
let's say this is a uh, this is a whole group of people that we're
and say we're doing our thing in San Francisco um in October
uh huh .
and you find that people change, and that has nothing to do with
it's, it's a natural event .
and the name for this confound that I'm talking about is called
we call it history confound .
and that's the name used by Cook and Campbell if you've ever heard
they're um psychologists who really study methodology problems .
I think of this in terms of extraneous events .
history I have to think about a little xxx .
uh huh .
another problem you have with this design is what's called
you have some sort of aging process or growing up process that's
so, you see your child at age six, and your child at age ten and
ok .
what, this is the validity of something ?
yeah, we're really talking about problems of internal validity,
in internal, by internal .
well, why would you have to think about this if you were doing an
uh huh .
on something that this, why would you think about this ?
um, because you want to be able to say that your observation here
you want to say that your independent variable caused your
and these are possible reasons why you might not .
uh huh .
that you have to think about and be able to control .
and we'll, we'll show you some designs, I'll show you some designs
this one right here doesn't
uh huh .
&=mumbles not to explain some of these confounds .
ok .
um, so, you've got your maturation which is somebody changing over
um, we have something called a testing effect .
and what this is, you give your subject a test here
by giving him a test here , the subject may
and so he wants to please the experimenter .
he wants to um +...
foul up the experimenter 'cause he doesn't like him, or whatever .
so, he's going to change his um +...
yeah, change his behavior or his test score or whatever
he wants to, to react, a specific form of reactivity .
he wants to um respond to the experimenter something other than the
ok .
and that's called a testing effect .
another problem is due to the uh .
what did you call it ?
a personality ?
uh, it's C, it's reactive .
you might want to put reactive, reactivity .
that really uh sensitize the subject to it .
another problem is called instrumentation or instrument decay .
and what that is is you're using a particular, excuse me,
something from here to here .
uh huh .
and that changes, if you're using a rubber ruler, &=mumbles And
um, you're using a scale, Ok, let's, let's do blood pressure .
um, if you don't calibrate the machine every time you start it, you
and the machine starts shifting a little bit .
well, you get a change, but it's not due to that .
it's due to a shift in your instrumentation .
so, it's what, uh, this has to be something mechanical like a seat,
not necessarily .
here's an example of an instrumentation problem that's not
there is a lawn mower surv, study done, lawn mower accident study
so, he went through hospital records for the last year and, and
then started his public uh campaign to show people the dangers of
and then a year later he looked at how many accidents there were .
and there were about three times as many .
and, I wonder what &=mumbles .
and what happened was this particular hospital where the nurses
and instead of noting it as a laceration, they noted, or a
because he had told them .
uh huh .
and so they were changing how they measured it .
ok .
and that's an example of instrumentation .
alright .
um .
the last, I really want to touch on this 'cause this is one of the
&=mumbles .
xxx um, what regression is is regression towards the mean .
and essentially that means people classified on the basis of an
on subsequent pretests .
say that again .
ok .
I, I knew that would be confusing plus I didn't say it well .
um .
subject comes in, oh, we could, we could talk about it ourselves
and we're in a class, and we get, we study, and study, and study,
we can get way better than seventy seven when we're studying really
the next test, we study just as hard an we get an eighty seven .
and we're pretty happy with that .
and, you know, why, why would you explain that ?
one time you get low and one time you get higher doing the same
it's called regression .
and it's easy to, easier to think of, if you're thinking of the
this is our grades in our class .
hmm .
this is how our grades fluctuate anywhere from a fifty to a one
and you can see where you get an extreme score this is our average
most likely the next score the next score is going to be lower .
you get an extremely low score, most likely, your next one is going
and that's called a regression ?
it's called regression toward the mean, because if you get an
so, uh, we have a subject come into our experiment and we pretest
and he got a very high score here .
actually it's an extreme score for that .
we give our treatment which has really no effect, but because of
so, we say, oh .
we've effected it .
but no we haven't .
it's really just changed on it's own .
it's just an, a regression .
and it's called an artifact .
ok .
you, I was taking &=mumbles exam .
uh, I made a forty four on the, my first stat test .
studies .
each time I kept, I went up and ended up with a ninety five on my
uh huh .
well, where's the regression ?
down below or up ?
well, if you started with a forty four, what was your next score ?
seventy five .
ninety five .
if I was just looking at these three pieces of data, I would say
now this could be, a lot of people could be &=mumbles, 'cause
but say .
the same amount of time .
ok .
then I would say that your true score is somewhere in here and your
ok .
so, the regression would occur even if it's going like this .
if I kept on taking tests, it would eventually regress ?
uh huh !
now, If you were doing something like this and
there, well, all I'm saying is it can go just the opp, I mean, wait
regression doesn't necessarily have to happ, be the cause of a rise
right .
the regression isn't the cause of anything per se .
it's a way to talk about it .
oh, I see .
I understand that !
&=laughs .
ok .
more of a dexcriptive thing .
um, a lot of times when yo see, when you see big regression
the book talks a little bit about matching .
and say you have a group of twenty individuals and you want to
you want to match them on some physical performance .
how fast they can run or something like that .
you take the, the top person the fastest runner and yo put him into
the second fastest runner you put him in this group .
the third fastest runner here .
the fourth fastest runner here .
like that .
uh huh .
you get 'em balanced .
it's called matching on a variable .
what you're gonna see through is these, there's a regression to the
&=mumbles .
on a subsequent trial .
and so, your initial criterion may not be effective .
so, a way around regression is to test and retest and retest .
but it's not really, well, we'll talk that, talk about that in
I just wanted to touch on that as a problem with this particular
ok, um .
all these four things are problems in the uh, uh, are, are problems
uh huh .
confounding with the um both I guess the one shot case study and
another type of experimental design that they say is kind of
but a to of times it's the only, it's it's done, more accepted
and what you do the way I conceptualize this again would be like
oooops .
&=mumbles .
you have a control group, but it's not an equivalent control group .
and we define equivalent as, um, random .
to be equivalent, they have to be randomly assigned .
so, just in example terms, we're doing an experiment on one
this group is from intro psych eight a_m .
a_m .
eight a_m .
sure .
this is from intro psych at noon .
now, we haven't randomly assigned the subjects to the different
we've just taken pre existing groups .
so, we call nonequiv, they're nonequivalent groups .
and we want to say that, uh, we, that we're usign this as an
we want to say that this, these groups are similar .
so, that if we see a change here, you know, but this stays constant
but the big problem is that we have .
&=mumbles .
two different groups .
&=mumbles .
that's right .
and even if it was, this was one eight a_m .
section and this is another eight a_m .
section taught by a different professor .
so, they're still nonequivalent 'cause they're not randomly
there may just be some difference between the two groups .
though it might, doesn't seem like it .
well, what are we testing ?
uh, uh, uh, wait, you've lost me .
uh, we're stating that the, because these two groups are not
uh huh .
uhh .
they're nonequivalent .
they're nonequivalent .
and that's all we really want to say about that .
right .
they're not equivalent .
and I'll go, go out on a limb here and say that you get a change
so, that we would want to say that our treatment had an effect, but
this, this is another one of those confounds .
and what that means is our two groups, since they're not randomly
and so we may get a change here and not there, and it might be due
it might be that, eight a_m .
and twelve, so, I need eight a_m .
here .
it might be that people who signed up for this class early are more
the teaching .
ok, or it could be the teacher, right !
the teacher's are different and you see some sort of, uh, change in
ok ?
now, let's get into some good studies .
enough of these, these bad experimental designs .
the main, um, feature of good experimental designs is
and that automatically gets rid of, um, your history problems
xxx automatically those two problems are gone .
and the first, um, they call true experimental design the posttest
you use a solid line to indicate, sort of indicate that they're,
and in this posttest only design, two groups posttest only design .
two group .
uh huh .
you have a control .
your subjecting this group to a treatment
this group gets no treatment and then just an
and if you find this different from this, that lets you say a lot .
it lets you say that your effects are probably due to your
ok .
so, really, it's almost, if at all possible to do the
uh huh .
in any experiment .
uh huh .
a lot of times, it's hard, it's hard to do random assignment .
a lot of times it is, it's hard to do .
&=mumbles .
and so you want, you'll have to do one of these not so good designs
ok, and if you can't and you've reached something that's, if you,
sure .
alleviate it ?
uh huh .
a lot of times if somebody's going to publish something in a
uh huh .
uh, somebody needs to try do this xxx .
randomization costs a lot of money .
yeah .
ok .
there, there's another, um, design called the two group pretest xxx
and it looks similar .
that's the pretest posttest .
yeah .
two group pretest posttest .
and what this one is is a control group and ann experimental group .
you have an observation before the treatment and an observation
and this has some advantages over
we'lll start with the disadvantages .
one is you could have a testing effect .
this one ?
this one .
because your giving them a pretest .
whenever you do a pretest posttest .
you worry .
right .
you should always have a little light bulb should go on saying this
so, you can see how this wouldn't be present here .
uh huh .
um .
however, another problem here is another one of those can,
xxx &=laughs .
&=laughs .
attrition ?
a@l t@l t@l ?
a@l t@l right .
attrition +...
what's that ?
and what it is is people dropping out .
&=mumbes .
the book calls it mortality .
I think it does .
the book, I think, calls it mortality .
uh huh .
and we're interested in that in case people are dropping out, um,
but that would have to be on a time thing, wouldn't it ?
to drop out, I mean, it would have to be over a period of time .
are all of these over a period of time that we've just done here ?
yeah, somewhat .
I'm assuming that this isn't, this isn't a treatment, and then ten
uh huh .
a portion &=mumbles or you'd know about it .
but, say that you, uh, this is a new kind of chemotherapy .
uh huh .
and people who it adversely affects drop out .
yeah .
you'd know this control group it's staying the same .
people who it adversely affects drop out, so you're only showing,
you don't really control, or you don't know who's leaving the group
with this , you document all the
since you have two observations at either end you can compare
and if there's a pattern to it or a trend, like a particular group
if you have um women dropping out or something, you can note that .
uh huh .
and that let's you note this attrition has an effect .
also, this allows you, this particular design, allows you to trace
so, you can document the natural maturation .
uh huh .
whereas this one you can't, and that might be useful information
xxx the treatment effect, I mean, and say it xxx .
uh huh .
&=mumbles .
right, because it could also have implication for other studies .
so, those are our two real good designs .
posttest and pretest and posttest .
put, uh, two group posttest only and two group pretest posttest .
and it still has nothing to do with the ABA ?
nope .
well, it, they're all related, but +/.
yeah .
the, you're getting ahead, I'll get to that in just a sec .
um, it talks about two other types of designs that they call
and it's up there somewhere .
xxx nonequivalent control group, interrupted time series design xxx
it's on page eighty two, eighty, eighty, page eighty .
and I've never used or heard those terms the independent groups and
I've always heard of it as um within subjects designs and between
uh huh .
even for xxx not here .
that's easier for you to think of .
what the independent subjects design is is, I'm gonna use this
they were doing a study on Muller_Lyer illusion .
they're saying an illusion takes place in all orientations .
so, essentially we have three different conditions .
with the independent groups, each subject participates in only one
so +...
well, now, each subject .
will parti, will see only one of these .
ok .
then we'll have three groups .
right .
well, we, we do have three groups .
say we have twenty subjects .
ok .
um, twenty subjects .
um, subjects one through six will see that, xxx will see that one .
so, each subject will see only one of these designs .
uh huh .
and that's an independent groups design .
the other design is a called a repeated measures design .
and each subject would see all three of these designs .
say they're to ask to say which is longer, one on top, bottom, or
ok .
ok .
so, we would have these, these are two different types of studies .
um, a problem with the re, an often problem with the repeated
uh huh .
um is sometimes an order affect .
so, if subject one sees one, two, and then three .
subjects two sees one, two, and then two .
subject three sees one, one, and then three, you may have some
they may get better at it, something like that .
so, what we like to do is subject one sees one, two, and three .
subject two sees two, three, and one .
subject three sees three, one, and two .
uh huh .
you juggle 'em up .
it's called counterbalancing .
xxx called counterbalancing .
&=laughs I know what you're talking about .
&=laughs .
at least I understand the word .
ok .
now what ?
um, there are some advantages to the repeated measures design, some
um, most obviously, you don't need as many subjects .
uh huh .
if each subject's in xxx, you would only need six subjects and
where as if you're going to do the independent subjects, you would
so, it's a lot more subjects if each subject is only going to look
ok .
here, then it's better to have less subjects .
well, it's just that +/.
xxx .
it's cheaper !
you know, it's just that it's more, more cheap to use the repeated
but, that's the only thing, I mean .
there is one other reason that we might want to use a repeated
and that is because, um, we have, it's more sensitive to changes .
um, since individuals are pretty consistent over time .
uhh huh .
we would assume that is they differ in any of the conditions that
and what that means is it's really ruling out a group composition
ok .
alright .
um, however, there always .
there always is a however .
there's always a however .
they cover themselves .
good .
the disadvantages to using the repeated measures design is a big
since subjects are seeing all the conditions +...
uh huh .
um, it's kind of like what we were talking about a testing effect .
I see this one and then I see this one, and pretty soon, I'm pretty
so, by the time I get to this one, my reaction time might be a lot
uh huh .
in making a decision .
or actually, I might a lot quicker and that's because of the
and that's called the carry over effect .
another way to think of it is if, u, the book talks abou it, some
so, you give 'em, you give them that, you give them the task, then
uh huh .
and it, it still has the effects .
that's, that's more of a true carry over type xxx that they got the
another problem, um, which we've already discussed this in the
and that's, subject sees this and then the subject sees this .
and he's, he's um, been exposed to two of the conditions and click !
he figures out what the experimenter's doing .
he understands it and so he, now he's gonna ignore that this one
and figured out what the experimenter wants .
and it's called, that's when, uh, the subjects has knowledge of all
and that's just a special form of reactivity .
I knew there was something about that that sounded real familiar !
demand characteristics is another form of reactivity .
alright, do you have any more questions on the independent or
0 unh uh .
ok .
the next thing we're gonna talk about is longitudal, longitudinal
you want to tell me a little bit about those ?
now, wait a minute .
longitudinal ?
ver and cross sectional .
cross sectional .
longitudinal .
the cross sectional is where you, uh, like one, or you pick a group
the cross sectional is you take the group across the board and
uh huh .
xxx .
xxx .
so, if it's a longitudinal study, you're holding umm you're
you're holding cohort constant .
remember this term from xxx .
cohort ?
so, that you're looking at, your group starts, their eight .
next tie yo see them they're ten, next time twelve, and fourteen,
but they were all born, let's see they're sixteen today, they were
no, wait .
xxx &=laughs nineteen seventy three .
I think .
so .
no, you're right, four .
alright .
so, they're born in nineteen seventy four .
so, the cohort is nineteen seventy four for all these subjects .
and this is the variable you're measuring .
um +...
xxx &=laughs .
I'm not gonna worry about it .
you got that down .
so, your cohorts stays the same when you're measuring the same
this is one of the best designs one xxx any kind of science .
now, with a cross sectional, you don't have time any more .
this is age .
what's being held constant is time being held constant .
so, at one time, you have a group of eight, ten, twelve, fourteen,
uh huh .
a problem immediately that you can see with this cross sectional
is different from people born in nineteen eighty two .
they're from different cohorts .
uh huh .
so, kids born in nineteen seventy four may be somehow different
um, how 'bout this, this is nineteen seventy four .
just for the sake of argument and this is nineteen eighty two .
and what's happened between these two years is Sesame Street's come
uh huh .
and you have kids a lot earlier knowing the alphabet, um, changing,
uh huh .
or this is nineteen sixty four, this is nineteen eighty two, uh,
nineteen fifty four might be radical with their hair long .
uh huh .
ok .
more liberal .
xxx .
so, your cohort can influence your groups .
in the cross sectional .
in the cross sectional .
(be)cause they're from different cohorts .
and the way the book says it is in a cross sectional design, your
of course, there's always plus and minus to either of these
longitudinal study .
very expensive .
very involved .
uh, it seems awful .
how is it xxx ?
it is .
it seems if you're gonna put ten years of your life into a study
yeah .
get published .
it just seems, you cold get tenure, I guess, but other than
xxx comfortable .
cross sectional .
easy to do .
um, you may measure on something that xxx cohort really doesn't
that would be the best way .
xxx .
yeah .
so, if you're doing something physiological .
uh huh .
well, you say it doesn't matter .
you know, ninetween fifty four or nineteen eigthy two, their
but it's hard to imagine anything would be xxx .
I know .
even physiology xxx .
uh huh .
well, I mean, um plastic surgery xxx .
uh huh .
you could look at it that way .
xxx .
you, you'd have a tough time coming up with something that, you
uh huh .
some basic human behaviors .
&=laughs like life and death .
&=laughs .
that's about it !
yeah, and taxes .
&=laughs .
&=laughs yeah .
and it changes .
the taxes certainly aren't the same .
&=laughs that's true .
that is, that was on the CPA yesterday, and you'd better believe
&=laughs .
&=laughs alright .
one more little thing to go and this is what you've been waiting
this is completely, I think it's because I didn't understand this
uh huh .
and I think I was trying to think that this was the same thing .
feel assured that when I first got this material last semester in,
no idea !
but it's, it's a lot simpler than you think .
what the ABA design really refers to is it, it's a type of what's
and these are experiments that you can do with just one subject .
and you may ask, well, what kind of experiment would you ever want
well, if you're a therapist and you have clients, you know, coming .
uh huh .
one at a time and you're not in an academic environment, you're
you can still do good research .
one person .
uh huh .
subject, person .
xxx usually a person .
the ABA design, with A@l being named mean, A is an observation .
that would be O ?
it's kinda like an O .
uh huh !
you have O X O ?
your B is the treatment .
and your A is again is observation .
you usually think of A as a baseline measure .
now what, what do you mean by the baseline ?
xxx .
oh, Ok .
&=laughs .
so, here we have an A, and B and an A .
we have a very depressed subject and we want to test out electro
so, we take what we call a baseline measure and find out that this
he's very depressed .
you give him shock therapy and you notice an improvement .
you terminate the shock therapy .
you quit giving it to him .
and we watch for what happens .
we see something like this .
we could pretty much assume that our shock therapy .
observed an effect .
uh huh .
because we had an increase and when we discontinued it, it dropped
so, the treatment is given, what, you, you have a baseline .
the treatment is given and then withheld .
Ok .
now this has some of the same methodology problems as our bad
uh huh .
in that this could be due to something other than our treatment .
uh huh .
could be .
so, we have a more powerful design called the ABAB .
all that does is add one more treatment .
oh, another problem with ABA is you finish by withholding
unethical xxx .
right, this could be an ethical ending on that .
so, you give him this, and low and behold, you give electro
that makes you confident that it, it happened twice right after
that makes you more confident that it's due to your treatment and
0 observation, treatment .
xxx .
stop the treatment, let it go, observation, and give the
and it's all on one subject viewed at different times under
and with it, and the whole beauty of an ABAB design you might
how come ?
these two are control, they're not getting any treatment
hmm !
when he's not getting any treatment, that's the control .
yeah .
we're considering that control .
of course, you can sorta see if this was some sort of drug, it
uh huh .
a carry over effect .
so, it's not a perfect thing .
no, but it would be good for like you said .
yeah .
counseling .
xxx .
yeah .
you know it would be great for counseling .
I wish more people would care .
most therapists won't do any kind of research xxx .
and they could do these type of studies all the time .
you'd just enrich the field .
xxx .
uh huh .
this is a little over confusing, the multiple baseline design and
it should, hopefully, be more clear than the book attempts to
ok .
now, what, now what is this again ?
this is called the multiple baseline .
yeah .
design .
multiple baseline .
and you see it .
there's three conditions that you see this .
across behaviors, settings and subjects .
across behaviors, settings .
across behaviors, across settings, across subjects .
now what is this you just said here, this is where we'll see it ?
these, there, it's a multiple baseline design across behaviors .
it's a multiple baseline design across settings .
oh, Ok .
and it, there's three different types that you usually see .
ok .
and what this is is it's kind of like your ABAB design, well, or
and I'll, I'll discuss it across behaviors first .
and this is a hypothetical study .
we have uh little Johnny +...
and little Johnny's got some behavioral problems .
it's disruptive because he pulls hair, runs around, and talks too
so we have three undesirable behaviors .
pulls hair, runs around .
pulls hair, runs around, and talks too much .
there are three undesirable behaviors and we want to change the
so, our hypothesis is that we're gonna try to change the behavior
this is hypothetical, of course .
uh huh .
so that we're only gonna reward him when he doesn't do the behavior
so, the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take a
and we happen to find that he talks too much at this level, runs
this is our little baseline .
then, we're gonna start our treatment .
now, when you say, uh, uh, I, I must be stuck .
if you say, how do you do it like that ?
um, we're gonna observe how many times he does it .
a certain time xxx .
yeah, we'll do it in, in a three hour period xxx .
so, we've got this level of pulling hair .
we're gonna start our intervention right here our treatment so to
and this treatment is gonna be only aimed at the pulling hair
and lo and behold, you see a decrease .
and, you see no decrease in the running around or talking too much
you don't want to extinguish those yet .
when you see a pattern like this, you can pretty much assume that
it's what you wanted it to be .
the only thing that it's affecting is the pulling hair .
so, you gave only the positive things when he did not want it .
right .
and you ignore the others .
right .
ignore the others xxx and they didn't change !
they didn't change at all .
it's import, we want these behaviors to change independently .
then, I'm gonna only focus on the running around behavior .
and lo and behold, it changes .
talking too much behavior is still unaffected .
and the pulling hair behavior is still declining, but has no change
it's still declining a little bit .
ok, so you're giving it treatment there
right .
treatment always occurs at the line .
ok .
then, the next step is we, the talk too much behavior, and we get
so, this changes there, this changes there, and this changes there .
they're changing independently .
and that tells us that our treatment is effective independently,
and that's a multiple baseline design across behaviors .
across settings, it would be +...
little Johnny talks too much in math class, English class, and
it would take, you'd take, you'd take, uh, uh, on this which is all
uh huh .
now you're, now you're .
well, actually that last one across behaviors was in a particular
the setting was constant .
the subject was constant .
uh huh .
this one, um, the behavior is constant, the subject is constant,
ok .
across subjects, little Mary talks too much, little Timmy talks
hmm .
in English class .
you're gonna try to affect them independently .
what varies is the person .
uh huh .
the subject .
so, while holding, it's the same behavior in the same setting, and
ok .
do you feel pretty comfortable with that ?
yeah .
uh huh .
it makes sense .
uh huh .
the book doesn't explain it at all .
&=laughs it really doesn't .
oh, I, like I said, I quit !
yeah .
because I kept going back to this, the first, what, you know, what
mmm .
and then this xxx .
ok, um, what time do you have ?
do you have a watch on ?
ooo, it's almost nine, it's ten after eleven .
it's ten after eleven right now ?
uh huh .
is it ?
it's ten after eleven .
did we start at ten ?
uh huh .
we've gone like an hour and ten minutes ?
uh huh .
oh, my+goodness !
is that bad ?
uh huh .
we went way overtime .
are you late to your class at all ?
no, unh uh .
I just go downstairs .
can I ask you five quick questions ?
oh, sure, Ok .
what are the major drawbacks to the correlational method ?
ok .
the correlational method .
no control .
you can't, can't manipulate it .
uh huh .
um +...
a major problem is in interpreting the results also .
um, xxx .
no .
if I look at my notes, I can tell you !
you have, you have and independent variable and a dependent
and what we want to say is that your independent variable causes .
cause and, no cause and effect, is that what you said ?
right .
we don't know whether A causes B, B causes A, or the causal
ok .
um, how would you create equivalent groups ?
it's all gone blank, I don't .
drawing a blank ?
it's just completely, if I could get a, a look at it, and go on it,
just think about it this way .
you have two different groups .
now, how, what would have to been done to call those two groups
how can we say that they're the same ?
the random ?
exactly, that's, that's right !
and that's it ?
well, there, there is controlling for every possible variable .
yeah .
how dou you control for every possible variable ?
I don't know .
xxx ok .
um, um, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the cross
well, let me see, well, let's see .
the longitudinal is where, um, you have, that's when the same
uh huh .
age or something like that .
uh huh .
xxx .
um, it's um it's probably the best if you're because you're
uh huh .
and you have people die, people move, and .
attrition .
uh huh .
I didn't mention that, did I ?
and the natural process of what happens to your age .
uh huh .
the cross sectional is your cohort thing you talked about .
right .
cohort is confounded .
it's the age .
right .
ok, one more .
uh, invent a hypothetical ABA design .
a hypothetical ABA .
let's see, that would be observe, xxx, um, Say you uh, there
&=laughs .
&=laughs .
ok .
then you observe the dog before you kick it, you kick it, and you
say you have uh, or you're observing somebody else, do you have a
a baseline of ?
of what the dog is doing before you kick it .
oh, we're doing this on the dog .
ok .
so, a baseline of some xxx .
what the dog is like .
oh !
how it would react if you, Ok, alright, could you do this, say, uh
think of more of a treatment .
think of a treatment .
think of a problem somebody might have and then a treatment for it .
ok, say the dog, she jumps up on you .
alright .
and ?
so, we're gonna observe jumping up behavior .
there's our baseline right here .
alright .
and the dog jumps on you and you step on the back of it's toes .
ok, our treatment is gonna be stomping on the dog's toes .
well, you don't have to stomp on 'em .
uh huh .
just pinch 'em !
ok, and what's our base, what's our um, the behavior going to do ?
drop off ?
drop off .
and then after that, we're going to quit .
but that would be better if you, if you, you could test this even
now, would that be the ABA ?
well, let's see !
if we're no longer stepping on him when he's jumping up now .
uh huh .
so, what do you want to happen ?
it'll go .
do you want it to go back .
it would go back up .
up here .
yeah, it'll go back up .
the behavior will start occurring again .
now, if you add a B .
Well, that xxx, it should go down again .
if your treatment is xxx .
and see how is the regression coming in ?
the regression ?
but it would be a learning situation for her, wouldn't it ?
uh huh .
it would be learning .
so, you might see this .
it wouldn't jump .
right .
it might, might learn here .
the behavior might not even be left over .
you did fine .
alright .
wow !
I can't believe it went &=laughs .
usually, it's like, askin' every fifteen minutes a session “what
I always wonder xxx .
&=laughs .
well, one thing I need you to do for me is fill out your
well .
be honest and .
I understand it better, but I, I don't know it .
I have to go over it, and go over it, and over it .
yeah .
but as far as I'll be able to understand it much better .
ok
