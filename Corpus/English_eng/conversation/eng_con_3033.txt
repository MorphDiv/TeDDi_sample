probably you like color it in but to me you have to color it in the
okay so for you right now you're thinking about symmetrical is
okay that's Alex's idea so far . 17550_20553
so um and Alex you described your example was a quilt example,
um could something besides quilts be symmetrical ? 26678_29553
yeah . 29553_30250
can you think of just one thing Alex that you would think might
I can think of lots of stuff . 35611_38793
could you pick one and share it with us so we know how your
um a scarecrow . 41876_45158
a scarecrow could be symmetrical ? 45158_47776
what would a scarecrow have to be like to be symmetrical ? 47776_52191
well it would have to have the same hands . 52191_57443
how many scarecrows are we thinking about ? 57443_61406
two . 61406_62925
two scarecrows . 62925_64763
okay and these scarecrows would have the same kind of hands . 64763_67748
the same clothes . 67748_69658
the same clothes . 69658_70818
same face . 70818_72621
same face . 72621_73545
the same smile where it goes +... 73545_76543
&=imitates:scarecrow . 76543_77945
okay the same facial expression whether it was smiling or another
okay so they would match exactly ? 81913_84041
&=nods:head . 84041_84983
okay who has um could do some more thinking about that word ? 84983_87996
Ashley I saw your hand up . 87996_89260
um with a butterfly both of his wings would have to be the same
<okay so uh if a butterfly> had two wings that were different
<it wouldn't be xxx> . 102548_103776
it wouldn't be then . 103776_104676
<no> ! 104676_104876
<but are we> thinking about two butterflies or just one
one . 106693_107390
one butterfly . 107390_108411
with two wings . 108411_109555
with two wings . 109555_110640
(be)cause each butterfly has two wings . 110640_113206
how many wings does a butterfly really have ? 113206_115488
four . 115488_116150
+^ four . 116150_116673
+^ right . 116673_117280
<but> +... 117280_118323
<xxx> . 118323_118571
<and he um> two wings that are across from each other have
the same pattern the same color the same design and what there was
did you say the same place ? 130810_134525
yeah . 134525_135136
okay like do you mean they have to be in be same place ? 135136_136643
yeah . 136643_137750
like attached to um okay . 137750_139901
hmm . 139901_140975
talk to me about the difference there . 140975_145185
Alex was thinking about symmetrical in terms of two things that
and the idea that Ashley has us thinking about is just one
so +... 155556_157835
a butterfly but two wings on the butterfly . 157835_162541
two wings on the butterfly . 162541_164275
okay so do we always have to think about two things when we think
two wings are two things . 168970_172451
two wings are two things ? 172451_173798
okay . 173798_175101
well let's see who else xxx +//. 175101_176820
I think we need to keep going with our ideas and share our
I think we're um getting some good ideas about this word . 179751_182851
Nicole what are you thinking about the word &~s symmetrical ? 182851_185120
symmetrical is sort of the same word as um identical . 185120_195848
Nicole wants you to think about this idea . 195848_197618
hold on one second . 197618_198820
Brian I need you to put the core square down right . 198820_201116
we're not using the core squares right now but we're going to . 201116_203356
Nicole wants you to think about this . 203356_205478
she's saying maybe the words symmetrical and identical mean the
how many of you have heard the word identical ? 213870_216588
okay who can try to tell me what it means to be identical ? 216588_222171
Justin what do you think ? 222171_224140
exactly the same um everything is the same . 224140_226431
okay Nicole is that your understanding of the word identical ? 226431_229101
exactly the same ? 229101_230120
um no . 230120_231678
what are you thinking ? 231678_232543
identical means you can't really tell them apart . 232543_240081
you can't really tell them apart so they'd be exactly the same
if two things are exactly the same you <couldn't tell them
<like a twin and a twin> . 246106_247006
like a twin and a twin . 247006_247996
that's uh one place we've heard that word identical . 247996_250586
identical twins are the kind of twins who look <> exactly
<(e)xactly> . 259861_261111
um but what if it wasn't twins . 261111_262251
+^ what if it was um +/. 262251_263178
triplets . 263178_264383
okay I &~wa I'm I'm going to talk about something that's not
oh . 268516_269078
what if it was um what if I had um two book marks and I said they
xxx . 277326_279193
if it weren't people what would it mean ? 279193_280310
they'd be exactly the same . 280310_282058
do you think ? 282058_282775
so I couldn't tell them apart . 282775_284158
unless I had some kind of mark on would I be sure which one was
they would match exactly . 288511_290343
that would be identical . 290343_291645
if mine was exactly they same as yours we would have identical book
so then if we didn't put our names on them and they dropped on the
unless like &~y yours had a bent corner or mine had scribbling on it
yeah . 307458_308206
okay so think about um Nicole's idea . 308206_311013
does symmetrical mean the same as identical ? 311013_316441
yeah, yeah, no . 315840_319871
who's thinking um who's thinking uh no and can tell me what
like I don't think symmetrical means identical because I think
Jillian what are you thinking ? 332046_333963
I think um symmetrical doesn't mean identical (be)cause I think
okay you think symmetrical means plain . 345183_347683
meaning +... 347683_348650
tell me more about what you mean <when you say plain> . 348650_351513
<(be)cause> in the story well they said that um this like white
hmm is that what <they said> ? 365115_366963
<they said plain> . 366963_367441
um no . 367441_368713
it was boring and white and they wanted to decorate it <and>
<yeah> . 371916_372950
hmm so it was going to be symmetrical when they were done
so could symmetrical mean plain ? 376245_378716
no . 378716_379645
no it was plain before they started . 379645_381196
and then you're right at the end when they were done putting the
but it wasn't . 386848_387875
but it wasn't . 387875_388745
so they added more stuff . 388745_390008
was it symmetrical when they were finished ? 390008_392340
yes . 392340_394173
when they were &~f when they were all the second time . 394173_398306
it never got to be symmetrical . 398306_400376
they decided that was okay . 400376_402673
their original plan had been <let's make it symmetrical> . 402673_406371
<but they hung it up in a museum> . 406371_408306
but does something have to be symmetrical to be in a museum ? 408306_409631
no but most things are . 409631_411341
most things in a museum are symmetrical ? 411341_413271
Brittany what do you mean when you say the word symmetrical . 413271_416806
or right now what are you guessing it might mean ? 416806_418181
(be)cause we're not none of us are sure yet . 418181_420173
well um I think symmetrical means things that are um like the same .
tell me more about that (be)cause I don't know exactly what you
you mean you agree with Nicole that symmetrical means identical ? 432480_435708
exactly the same . 435708_437218
can't tell (th)em apart . 437218_438105
well you can sort of tell (th)em apart . 438105_442310
how could you tell them apart if they were exactly the same ? 442310_444288
well identical is like something um that um like if you had just
uhhuh . 455406_456506
um one was a girl and one was a boy they'd be identical . 456506_458971
two babies would be +... 458971_461103
no no . 461103_462421
sometimes twins are identical . 462421_466365
are twins always identical ? 466365_467648
no . 467648_468340
no . 468340_468911
some . 468911_469816
some are and some are not . 469816_471823
right . 471823_472118
hmm let's talk about that word some more . 472118_475151
Katie can you add on to our thinking about symmetrical ? 475151_478180
um I don't think they're the same as identical . 478180_482648
you didn't think that symmetrical means identical ? 482648_483798
so what do you think symmetrical means ? 483798_486581
something that's like really a design and it's not plain . 486581_490080
um like it has a lot of it has colors and patterns . 490080_494745
okay so Katie is saying she doesn't think symmetrical means plain .
she thinks it means having a lot of patterns and colors and designs
uhhuh . 501395_501876

it wasn't plain . 520245_521186
it wasn't plain but +... 521186_523010
it wasn't symmetrical either . 523010_524910
right . 524910_525920
hmm Alex add on to our thinking . 525920_530556
well I don't believe that symmetrical is the same as identical . 530556_537676
okay . 537676_538573
tell us why . 538573_540006
