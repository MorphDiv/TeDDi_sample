make it symmetrical . 1230_2160
no . 3060_3120
no . 3280_3430
if you change the colors . 3670_4830
before if you move the . 6600_7590
car around . 7640_7870
how would you change the color . 8060_9070
if we move the colors around . 10140_11490
we could but we can't change the . 11700_13300
I see . 13800_13910
Brittany before when we Mrs Curtis was having the discussion you
a move . 21760_22260
that was a diagonal . 25350_26820
yeah . 27660_27780
dal . 28260_28460
yeah . 29100_29310
where did you get . 29570_30300
what did you mean . 31070_31740
did that have something to do with this . 31980_33190
or not . 34020_34270
well you it's one way that you that we we tested them like this
I see that's a way . 42680_44920
so Radu do you have a plan or can you imagine how it is going . 50250_54990
look like when you put together . 55220_57170
in the line . 57290_57600
and you could go . 58490_59060
square . 59930_60160
well depends what order we put . 61900_63980
so if we like &-um put it in like this . 65610_69330
and then this way then what_about this . 69640_74010
what do you mean by order . 76340_77450
like you know like push them all together . 78620_82100
and then let's see how it look like . 82890_84810
and then see like that looks kind . 85850_89920
a matter . 93470_93680
of order or a matter of something else . 93890_96260
what it's . 97700_98550
&-uh was the order is the order going be . 98670_101540
any changed . 101730_107570
yeah . 108370_108490
is that the order that . 109370_110580
is changing . 111190_111540
yeah I guess . 112380_116140
so can you show me the different variations . 119590_122800
you can put them together . 123730_124740
can . 129930_130130
you show me different ways . 130150_131260
different ways like <this way> this way . 131780_137400
okay . 148890_149020
so like this would be like on top because we saw this one . 152570_156720
is that different this way that you are showing us right now this
and then before if I can just do this you had it like this . 162820_165420
yeah . 166280_166340
before you had it like this . 167410_168610
right . 168870_169020
and then you turned it . 169490_170580
yeah . 170940_171040
were those different . 171460_172210
different like &-uh no different . 174880_177610
lemme see . 181630_182170
the they're different . 182940_183560
they're different . 184300_184860
they look different . 185240_185750
and . 186440_186540
why are they different because you move . 186560_190270
them in different spots . 190320_191580
and they look different each time . 191740_193500
see you move it and you move down . 193820_196190
like that . 196270_196860
mhm . 197540_197720
we'll come back later and see . 205610_207030
yeah we're we're interested to see what you guys are gonna plan
what . 215750_215960
well we're decided . 217150_218870
but we've already done the backs . 223820_225230
okay . 225510_225630
how did your ladies get your backs done so quickly . 225860_227670
cooperated . 233330_233950
work and not . 234390_235350
talking when we were doing . 236950_238020
talking while you were still working . 238490_239580
how does the window help . 239940_240860
because when we're on the back and see when we go down here it
it's up here . 247070_247500
it shows us the black line . 247520_248560
and it shows the . 248680_249470
so . 250890_250950
that's good tool . 251040_251740
so the window's actually a really good tool to help you show what
'cause then would it be possible to make a using the window . 257700_259940
would it be possible to color red where it was supposed to be green
no . 264620_264690
no . 265180_265340
you guys have found a good way to keep yourself from making
&-um . 270220_270380
that's why we our hands are we you when you are done . 270440_273110
can you just like say its red . 273300_274750
and then . 275230_275460
green . 275570_275870
okay . 276890_277070
nice job . 277150_277660
I like the way you divided up that task and gave each_other d print
I think your group is the only group you thought of using the are
and checking to see if they've got the colors matching . 286260_288300
but your way seems like a quick and easy way . 288610_291350
okay . 292130_292230
so this one's all the way finished Brittany what do I see you doing
tell me about that . 297150_297820
I am &-um drawing a line through so that because yeah have
okay . 304860_304950
but here . 305260_305440
it looks like there's a line . 305680_306830
and is that gonna help you when you color . 307400_308740
I think going next up because there's a line here . 309960_313260
oh . 313980_314010
let's see . 316490_317100
yeah . 322640_322790
I think you need . 323200_323750
one more line . 325200_325630
well well . 326470_327440
because . 329150_329520
you . 330720_330820
want the lines to show you where the green ones that are by
right . 335210_335420
and . 336580_336680
yeah right now . 336800_337230
it's not four green . 337590_338540
well that that's a all green . 339670_341190
this is that . 342040_342580
that's a square right . 342960_343620
so that one's not supposed to be there . 343890_345060
so we'll just go like that because you just said that one's a whole
&-um do you need a line there . 349180_350430
no . 355060_355200
well . 356290_356380
the only things you have covered . 356440_357430
that's a red square . 357480_357910
that's a red square . 357960_358780
yeah . 358830_358930
the red . 359120_359370
so that one's gonna be all green . 359420_360860
and that one's gonna be all red . 360880_362140
so where do you need . 362260_363470
the lines on the back of that one . 363520_364900
right here . 365250_366150
here . 366870_367140
yeah . 367340_367470
so let's erase these outta your way . 367860_369020
and let you put those . 369040_369710
can you keep these lines . 370570_371310
yeah . 371900_372070
okay . 372550_372790
okay . 377070_377250
try . 377860_378030
that and let's see if that helps before we fix this one . 378080_380750
does that look . 397470_398020
right to you . 398040_398420
Ra Two . 398730_399070
wow . 400180_400240
sort of . 402870_403100
but the . 403380_403770
oh yeah how . 404300_404870
but the square root is trying to here it's not have it has red . 405420_410780
no it has red . 411330_411900
she just wanted to show where the divine was . 412320_413490
she just wants to make it green green and green . 413580_415540
and then red red and red . 415700_417150
yep . 417980_418070
let your note . 418580_419050
so this one though . 419140_419990
do you have lines where you need (th)em to help your . 420290_421750
f no . 421960_422230
okay . 422990_423260
and is there a reason why you colored all the greens first and left
because as are actually using red . 430040_432170
oh . 432740_432820
okay . 432960_433220
and you guys only have one green and one red color between you . 433490_435940
should I fill this way . 436510_437270
yeah please . 437320_437860
so you're gonna do your greens on the front and the back . 449550_451500
and then switch crays with him . 451650_452900
and . 453060_453160
do . 453500_453650
yeah . 453720_453840
okay . 454310_454580
&-um . 454710_454820
like that . 455230_455650
can you &-um can you on the front side of those . 456300_458660
can you mark the . 458820_459530
okay . 465230_465330
and you already have one other one all the way . 465570_466980
done . 467000_467150
yeah . 467200_467410
oh that's this one . 467480_467940
yeah . 468080_468140
right where you guys use marker . 468570_469630
yeah . 470070_470240
and you have your first window with marker too . 470420_472030
and you're gonna make each of your last two with crayon . 472200_474300
okay . 476360_476470
so yeah he'll have to do that one and that one . 476520_479030
right . 479080_479190
yeah . 479280_479500
okay . 479910_480150
so I'm just doing both at the same . 480300_481370
and that's your . 482260_483020
flip side . 483070_483580
and there's your front side which corner . 483660_485220
we'll get that x on the front side . 485290_487700
&-um yep . 488100_489480
you use a pencil to put that on . 491140_492590
so we don't lose track . 492690_493460
of that . 493480_493790
wait . 495830_495980
&-um wait wait . 497140_499820
oh okay . 500030_500300
there we go . 500360_500710
yep . 500900_501010
that's . 501940_502100
right . 502360_502620
okay . 503290_503380
&-um this is &-um Dream Square and this you got all . 505660_516929
six of your two-sided course for a step . 518929_520260
okay . 520309_520429
let me talk to you about . 520690_521909
let me talk to you about what to do next . 523570_524990
okay . 526350_526620
when you get the greens Ard will you ambassador at to check that
&-uh oh six . 537340_539230
okay . 540070_540340
show me what a strip made from those six horse spurs . 541790_545340
might look like . 545410_545900
I'd like Amanda to go first 'cause you guys are gonna both get away
will she need to use . 556040_556750
okay . 558650_558780
see what do I see Amanda doing if she decides how to put (th)e
