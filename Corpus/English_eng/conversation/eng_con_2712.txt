So Erasmus laid the the- +/. 6065_7580
laid the egg 7585_8315
(..) &=tsk And um 10225_11185
This freedom of the will . 14345_15650
&=in Um 16040_16640
Because it sets the sa- stage very nicely . 19665_22155
This is in the Luther book some of you are reading 22170_24810
(..) &=tsk &=in It's on page three eleven . 33371_35215
&=in But 35215_35891

(..) Luther was glad to take up the the:me of this debate &}l=READ . 63516_67080

&=in (..) &{l=READ You alo:ne . 69754_71628
(..) Among all: the others 71628_73165
&=in And you do not bore me . 75746_77620
&=in With the Papacy 77620_79157
&=in You 82906_83797
&=in And you have put the razor to the throat . 88406_91325
&=in And for that I thank you heartily . 91325_93661
(..) &=in U:m 93661_95843
And Erasmus commented on the significance &=in of their engagement 98946_103218
&=tsk &=in And he wrote to Luther . 105430_106874
&{l=READ &=tsk &=in Perhaps an Erasmus (..) who writes (..) against

&{l=Q I am the master of my fate 140061_142243

dignity of man . 176444_177643
&=in Catholic 177643_179179
&=in Thereby conceptualizing free will 190579_193314
healthy human understanding 195711_197463
(..) This is what Erasmus asked . 204285_206220
(..) &=in &=tsk &{l=READ How can he decide between good and evil . 206220_209232
(..) So reasoned Erasmus . 209232_211229
&=in Such arguments 211229_212889
(..) &=tsk God alo:ne is salvation . 219526_222077
&=in God alo:ne measures guilt . 222077_224504
&=in He alone condemns . 224504_226194
He alone grants grace . 226194_227638
Justifies and saves . 227638_229298
When he will 229298_230097
&=in Ma:n can do nothing against the divine prerogative . 231418_235044
&=in Man can only accept the divine judgment . 235044_238055
(..) &=tsk This is in fact best . 238055_239899
&=in And if by +/. 239899_241528
&=in And +/. 241528_241958
and it is by the divine prerogative 241958_244693
&=in uh: 246322_246813
For God alone is infallible 248718_250347
(..) &=tsk This concept 252529_254188
That later 261778_262393
&=in And that subsequently 266142_267432
&=in (..) U:m 275452_277880
Right here . 281475_281905
The next one . 281905_282445
&=tsk &=in P- on page three twelve . 282440_284395
When you 284395_284794
if you wanna read it later . 285378_286361
&=in &{l=READ Therefore 286361_287898
&=in Such arguments 292691_294074
From the very start . 301326_302525
&=in Because they originated from human nature . 302525_305444
&=in Which exalted itself against God . 305444_308271
&=in The who:re reason . 308332_310453
&=in Prefers to submit to the Devil . 310453_312942
&=in Adjusts to all situations . 312942_315615
&=in And proves everything 315615_317244
(..) Human nature 319210_320378
&=in It is like a horse . 322775_324619
&=in Ridden by Go:d or the Devil . 324619_327814
(..) The rider possesses the will . 327814_330150
(..) The horse obeys &}l=READ . 330150_332178
(..) &=in Well that's as clear as you can get it . 332178_335927
(..) &=tsk Human nature is like a horse . 335927_339952
(..) Ridden by Go:d or the Devil . 339952_343517
(..) The rider possesses free will . 343517_346651
(..) The horse: obeys . 346774_349355
(..) Alright that 349355_350400
And as you come +/. 352059_352920
as Erasmus comes to this 352920_354364
(..) &=tsk Now 357775_359035
v- first off 361247_362323
&=in &=THROAT Many . 367823_369974
Which see:m to teach 369974_371480
&=in Isn't that clear in the Scriptures ? 378087_379777
&=in Whosoever wi:ll may come . 379777_381897
(..) Um 381897_384355
(..) &=tsk And then he turned to those who remained 398951_401441
(..) They had a choice . 404821_406081
Didn't they ? 406081_406941
(..) Will you go away . 406941_409246
What do you will . 409246_411458
&=in And the will 411458_412411
&=in And so Erasmus is going to say 416405_418372
(..) We have clea:r passages of Scripture 421906_424979
&=in To respond or not to respond . 432692_434689
&=in On the other hand 434689_435611
man is predestined by a an omnipotent sovereign will of God . 443908_448916
&=in (..) We have to take both these pass- +/. 448916_452143
So it's not a question of the Scriptural authority . 452143_454724
We both accept the scriptural authority . 454724_456621
And Erasmus in his writings 456570_457856
I will not question 466026_467362
I will not quote . 467785_468597
I will not quote the Church Fathers to you 468597_471388
&=in So I will quote the only authority that you recognize 477748_481368
(..) &=tsk And so 482620_483719
&=in When God created Adam and Eve in the garden 488269_490908
&=in &=lengthened Uh: 493581_494968
Do not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good- +/. 495830_498300
of the tree of good and evil 498300_499738
Now: 502190_502765
Because the whole &=in system of reward or punishment 510090_515316
Or: 518598_519055
&=in &=lengthened &=tsk U:m 521423_523063
Shall you not be s- sustained ? 524603_526768
But if you do evil ? 526768_528020
&=in Sin crouches at the door . 528020_530675
(..) If you do well . 530675_532722
(..) Apparently 532722_533872
ʔuh ʔuh even after the murder of Abel 538270_540266
According to Erasmus . 544850_546423
That's going to be his position . 546423_547996
&=in Well Luther 547996_549265
Return to the God of the covenant 564116_565723
&=in And uh 570239_571102
Erasmus says the whole premise is 580964_582977
That you can make up your mi:nd 586343_588778
&=in And that you can go this way 591603_593650
&=in And uh 595065_596335
(..) God 615377_616412
from the book . 618164_618742
&=in &{l=READ God made man from the beginning 618742_621569
(..) &=tsk He added his commandments 624654_627203
(..) If thou would keep the commandments 629054_631463
(..) He hath set w- +/. 638212_639486
he hath set water and fire before thee . 639486_642233
(..) Stretch forth thy hand 642233_644224
&=in (..) Before man is life and death . 646036_649380
(..) Good and evil . 649380_650873
(..) That which he shall choose 650873_652884
(..) Choose . 654397_657005
(..) &=in So Erasmus's argument is 657005_659454
You can choose . 660887_661882
&=in And therefore if you can choose 661882_664391
&=in In any rate 668074_669308
If he is pre:determined to sin . 674305_676614
&=in If if God has already determined 676614_680317
&=in Then there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor . 683483_687823
&=in On the part of the perpetrator . 687823_689594
Because how can a person be held responsible &=in for deeds 689594_693297
if 697996_698175
th- those deeds were imposed upon his will by a transcendent force . 700604_705282
&=in &=lengthened If that is the case 705282_707153
&=in And if uh: 709204_710677
&=SNIFF This is uh: 719437_721527
&=in But uh: 726225_727559
If 732456_732875
&{l=READ If the will were not free 733432_735761
(..) &=tsk It ceases to be sin . 739325_742191
(..) If it is not voluntary . 742191_744142
&=in Free wi:ll is not extinct . 744142_747228
(..) Though it has contracted a paralysis &}l=READ . 747228_751170
(..) &=SNIFF (..) &=in How is it paralyzed . 751170_756235
Well it's paralyzed by the fall . 756235_757859
(..) See we all: participate in the Adamic nature . 757859_760825
(..) &=tsk &=in A:nd this Adamic nature 760825_763533
&=SNIFF &=lengthened So: 769087_770481
&=in And so therefore while we +/. 775657_777747
&=in we have a free will 777747_779599
it is paralyzed . 780037_781191
It's not the will that was there . 781191_783899
&=in It's not the will 783899_785651
(..) Because it no longer has the freedom that Adam had . 788717_792957
It is cursed by sin . 792957_794390
It is under the curse of sin . 794390_795844
&=in So the human will 795844_797138
&=in (..) Uh Erasmus admits that . 799049_801438
&=in And then 801438_802354
What God does 807629_808505
&=in That God will provide a prevenient grace . 810974_814916
(..) A prevenient grace . 814916_816787
That is in other words 816807_817543
(..) &=tsk &=in And if I then respo:nd . 831818_835520
positively . 835520_837153
&=in To the gift of God 837153_838885
&=in So prevenient grace 846609_848421
&=in (..) If you respond on the path 849914_852801
&=in He uses a little: story . 857698_860067
(..) A little uh uh allegory . 860067_863232
Or figure I guess . 863232_864865
&=in (..) &=tsk Uh there uh there's a n- &=ex +/. 864865_867035
(..) there's a tot 867035_868190
(..) &=in &=tsk Uh 869185_870897
Okay ? 873983_874441
&=laugh &=laugh &{l=@ Because 874441_875894
&=in There a nice shiny apple . 879577_882006
Over here . 882006_882782
(..) &=tsk &=in Over here 882782_884454
(..) And this little tot 884972_886684
&=tsk &=in (..) A:nd he uh: 888317_891024
(..) &=in U:m 893712_895264
But he's very unsteady . 898788_900222
He wavers . 900222_901018
You see 901018_901456
The prevenient grace is the adult 904880_907010
&=in But he just more or less 922220_924908
&=in So the little tot you see 930163_932353
Once he sees it 934881_935857
&=in Prevenient grace assists him toward that apple . 938644_941949
&=in It doesn't 941949_943024
But he goes: sustained by this prevenient grace . 949813_953456
And then 953456_954013
(..) With prevenient grace . 970278_972209
&=in &=lengthened Luther hated that word cooperation . 972209_974996
W- particularly in connection with grace . 974996_976967
&=in Now Luther's position is 976967_978958
&=in You see . 982283_983338
There is &=in nothing &=in that can come to us 983457_986762
&=in &=lengthened The righteousness of God . 992197_994387
And Luther all through his monastic life 994387_996557
&=in That so+called &{l=L2 Turmerlebnis &}l=L2 . 1000618_1003365

(..) &=tsk Where reading in Romans one seventeen 1005555_1008243
(..) &=in &=tsk U:m 1016524_1018674

(..) &{l=MRC The just shall live by faith &}l=MRC &}l=READ . 1043659_1046924
(..) A:nd 1046924_1048576
But this one time when he read it 1050985_1052518
(..) What this meant . 1055445_1056579
(..) &{l=Q And this place in Pau:l &}l=Q 1056579_1059586
(..) &{l=L2 Es ging mir ein Licht auf &}l=L2 . 1063468_1066932
&=in (..) The light broke in on me . 1066932_1068922
&=in (..) And what was this light . 1068922_1071570
(..) &=tsk That the righteousness of God 1071570_1073879
It's not the righteousness 1075791_1077330
&=in What does righteousness of God mean . 1081086_1083216
&=in Righteousness of God means 1083216_1084849
&=in And I'm a sinner . 1086282_1087536
(..) And I can never stand in his presence . 1087536_1089905
&=in And the gulf between us can never be bridged 1090005_1092752
&=in What shall I do to earn the righteousness of God &}l=Q . 1095460_1098207
So you see he was constantly &=in preoccupied with this thought 1098207_1101791
&=in Through some work . 1105812_1107106
&=in Through some indulgence . 1107106_1108579
&=in Through some prayer . 1108579_1109734
S_through- through- through- renunciation . 1109734_1111835
Through fasting . 1111835_1112867
Through vigils . 1112867_1113925
&=in You know 1113925_1114881

&=in Because he d- he did everything 1130867_1133212
And and pacify: this righteousness . 1138057_1140517
&=in And he was always miserable . 1140517_1142289
(..) &=tsk And then he discovered 1142289_1144023
(..) It's what I accept in faith . 1146330_1149262
Namely 1149262_1150206
and and then the righteousness of God 1158798_1160506
(..) It's given to me . 1162966_1164981
(..) The &{l=MRC the just &=in shall live by faith &}l=MRC . 1164981_1168563
(..) And so 1168869_1169952
And now you see 1183784_1184625
His works . 1186652_1187201
What do I have to do 1187201_1188042
What do I have to do to please him . 1189661_1190897
&=in And now you see the breakthrough comes . 1191038_1193320
&=in So 1193205_1193728
He's coming at it from that . 1199031_1199796
With this travail of soul . 1199796_1201134
This agony and anguish &=in of looking for this God . 1201134_1204410
&=in So 1204410_1204971
&=in N:o . 1219785_1220766
(..) There is nothing you can do to please God . 1220766_1222984
&=in God loves you 1222984_1224693
(..) So the human will &=in cannot 1230875_1233348
(..) Even the gift of faith . 1237441_1239162
It's interesting in um 1239162_1240526
So you would expect it . 1244095_1245128
&=in But it's still 1245128_1246262
&=in Where he's in one of the camps . 1247843_1250240
It's in the second world war 1250240_1251527
And and he: 1256639_1257391
&=in And u:m 1267653_1269018
