watched the video . 0_890
some of them were verbalizing with a great amount of skill . 1340_5020
the movements that were happening before their eyes . 6300_8109
they were you know they were keying in on that . 8189_10230
so &-um now we'll see though the the testing point about how
what they don't know yet is after they do each two by two design
so did that's why we went through this one at a time pulling it out
&-um okay you just had to copy it or leave it . 34830_36540
oh this one you had to you know turn it right a quarter or . 37100_39630
oh that was an up down flip because they're gonna go back to each
hmm . 50040_50140
how did I do that . 50340_51100
and usually that is just it's like pulling teeth . 51660_55260
that is the hardest thing during this unit usually is that step the
are they going to work individually or . 63980_65750
mhm . 66150_66390
we do do some we practice first as a group . 67260_69500
unlike some of Mrs Fergus we'll use my book as a model and say . 69730_72470
okay well what did I do to the Foursquare to get it to look like
and then we record it . 77520_78470
do that . 79140_79470
&-um so that's at the end of this week I'll be able to tell more if
of that vocabulary carries over . 90300_91860
&-um are you able to get further than you thought or it'll still
they're not &-um they're not going anymore quickly . 100420_103910
but <they seem to> they seem to not just be saying the words at
they seem to have more understanding behind those words . 109960_112540
and they seem to be bringing up points themselves that I don't need
oh paper course wears you know it would be like on there I mean
and &-um and other things like . 123380_125860
yeah . 128350_128419
and and the testing and the proving with the up down flip and
we'll see &-um no not necessarily though eventually I knew we had
you couldn't have someone calling it an up flip and someone calling
so we still will when we get into recording on those little boxes
and then we'll have to have that conversation again if you say up
and he says . 157640_158140
flip right . 158160_158700
are they different . 159060_159750
&-um and the reason that for one thing we need to all be coming to
'cause when we start demoing things up on the board they have to
flip up some people think one thing if you say flip down . 169480_171460
but if we're all saying up down flip and we know that's that's
and when we get onto online with &-um Geometry and design . 175460_180300
the quilting software . 180320_181460
those are the words that are used there and up down flip . 181850_183980
they can't be looking for a flip left or flip right because it's
there's a sideways flip . 187880_188940
and there's an up down flip . 189020_190140
and then copying that course first . 190730_192180
so we'll &-um we'll see . 192350_194260
and I wonder if maybe this will be easier for them to take this
and then to do the backside of it . 202700_204340
so they end up with four two-sided core squares is usually also a
'cause they just turn it over and start doing that core square
and then realize as Jillian pointed out to them many times they
you have to check the colors and the arrangements or shapes . 217840_220180
I mean she said that much better than I could . 220240_221850
and I'm hoping that because it was her saying it and her stressing
but we'll see . 229340_230130
sorry . 231170_231320
&-um this is the same kind of grid that we &-um use to create the
but they use it to make four individual foursquares . 238900_242380
and then cut them apart and do the backside . 242460_245180
and then the backside is blank which is another thing that's hard
&-um that might be easier . 251470_252180
but they have to actually use their ruler and trace those lines and
so . 261060_261230
we'll see . 262550_262900
and some design easier coursewares than others . 263150_265260
&-um but they'll have some limits placed on them .
well actually won't be to limit them . 268560_269540
they'll be to extend them . 269560_270780
they won't be able to use just squares because for you can't get
family use just squares . 276720_278510
and &-um and I think that they'll be using . 279100_283900
yeah three will be their &-um their limit for colors on this side I
how how did you come up with that . 289600_291020
real . 291250_291430
before &-um well it's part of the software . 292700_296700
so as we were reading through that when it was in development
and then seeing all of the design possibilities . 304580_306650
so making use of just one four square . 307560_309510
but coming up with at_least this many designs for the two by two .
and there could have been more . 313280_314300
uhhuh . 314610_314730
&-um . 314960_315110
I'm just asking that . 315740_316450
do you do that with the kids or . 316740_318300
&-um . 319700_319780
did you do it together . 320620_321470
or it was here . 321820_322710
I'm just asking . 323180_323670
the story . 323780_324310
<that's part> that's part of more of the give and terminology .
they didn't create that term . 327230_328670
I didn't create that term . 329280_330260
I think that's a quilting term . 330840_332220
and in . 332300_332830
the software . 332880_333460
and the materials from I B m they used it . 333480_335580
and &-um so we used that to talk about a group of two by two . 335940_339100
design that come from the same . 339400_340740
put . 341740_341880
your snack out first . 341960_342740
and I'll bring you a . 342780_343630
but the two by two design . 344940_346240
did you put them . 346620_347290
together to the class . 347600_348430
I'm just trying to . 348780_349350
find out what happened . 349400_350270
last time basically . 350350_351560
or &-uh . 352810_353120
you just no . 354010_354600
that's just from from the video . 354880_355980
the video . 356300_356660
calls them two by twos . 356680_357990
and &-um now they the video doesn't have anything about a assault
that's one aspect of it that doesn't appear in the video . 361700_364050
but core square . 364500_365700
and using four core squares to create &-um a two by two design . 365820_372220
and then using the two by two design to create finished quilt is on
but quilt family is not . 378900_380230
so we put it up on our bulletin . 380410_381860
board . 381920_382140
we use their courseware . 382430_383620
to make a quilt . 383740_384470
family . 384520_384710
and then today is . 385380_386320
and talked about just to let them know what these colors you want .
but your limit is three colors . 407660_408980
you can't . 411370_411690
you can't use red yellow blue and green . 411960_414060
you could use red yellow and green or blue yellow and red or red .
you have to use two or three . 420940_421940
okay . 423350_423590
it could be a two color core square . 424060_425620
or it could be a three color core square and square combination . 425700_430930
you can't use &-um only squares . 432780_435350
you have to have some triangle somewhere in your foursquare . 435910_439230
so you could use all triangles or you could use some squares and
it's your choice . 443820_444260
but you can't use the just squares because I want your design to
can we try . 450970_451700
yes if you choose to but you can't use just squares . 452420_455910
thank you . 456480_456750
&-um Kelly and Kevin for passing on the you have use squares since
I'm gonna go over again what to think about . 464000_466790
as you design your four square . 467030_468500
you may use two colors or three colors . 469380_472830
and you may use . 476100_476990
squares and triangles or just triangles . 477230_481290
but can you use just squares . 482170_483830
no not just squares because then you're &-um it would be harder for
you to make a_lot_of different two spicy designs . 490720_493880
experiment and find &-um colors that you like to gather and shape
boy . 507260_507430
I'm so excited that lots lots_of guests have their materials out .
already there you go . 512919_515150
a zip bag and a courseware building . 516000_517659
mat . 517780_517950
thank you . 518049_518460
Kelly and . 518490_519110
that's okay . 521020_521580
let's see . 527660_528070
do you have to decide to use the very first four square that you
no no you . 534420_534750
can can you're gonna get some experimenting . 534800_536780
time . 536800_536890
we'll work for about oh the next five to ten minutes . 537010_540110
and then everyone will have . 540220_541190
to settle on what they really &-um light . 541240_544030
you can try different colors . 544460_545540
you can try different shapes . 545870_547180
it's your four square . 547490_548360
see . 552900_552960
but you'll watch what I do . 553200_554230
Brittany has one on her core square building mat right now . 554800_557190
that she feels pretty confident that she really likes her butt . 557810_561550
she's only used just a small portion of her experimenting time . 561650_564990
what she can do is slide the whole . 565230_567250
