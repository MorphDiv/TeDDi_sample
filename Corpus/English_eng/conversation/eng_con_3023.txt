++ um right corner xxx . 0_1758
+< do you think she's right ? 1758_2681
yeh . 2681_3000
she thinks this square will end up on the upper right corner . 3000_5866
and then it did . 5866_7038
so did a sideways flip make the core square look different than an
+< it's a sideways flip . 13238_13260
yes . 13260_13741
yes but see now it's on the bottom and on a um up down flip one's
but it's similar . 19981_21078
+< so an up down flip makes what's on the &~ba what's on the top be
if you flip down . 24996_28133
&~ds if I flip it down what if I flip it up ? 28133_31085
+< or up either one . 31085_32180
+< let's try it . 32180_32748
I'm going to flip it up and let's see if see what's on the bottom
did . 38191_39330
yeah . 39330_39730
okay . 39730_40500
but now I'm gonna flip it down and we're going to see if what's on
it did . 47165_47708
so +/. 47708_48260
if you do a sideways flip um either xxx +/. 48260_50748
+< okay just a second <this is how it's> this is how it began
if I do a sideways flip either way +... 54530_56333
either way it will +/. 56333_57816
the &~bot +/. 57816_58790
+< the the right will end up on the left and the left will end up
let's see . 61850_62410
xxx . 62410_64648
but what if I do it the other way ? 64648_65500
it'd still look the same xxx . 65500_67776
the Polydrons are kind of moveable . 67776_70253
hmm so Jillian what do you think ? 70253_72316
did Brittany show you an example of how and up down flip makes the
yes . 79201_79851
yeah and yesterday I think that's what you were thinking too but
not always . 91711_93116
could there ever be a core square that looked the same if you did a
yeah . 113316_113716
yeah . 113716_114546
yes . 114546_115045
yeah . 115045_115331
are you thinking of one Nathan ? 115331_116900
um I remember the time that I made um this one um that had um that
that was a pinwheel design wasn't it ? 134456_136981
I think +/. 136981_137735
four triangles of yellow and four triangles of blue ? 137735_140418
yeah . 140418_141023
what I'm gonna do Nathan uh while we go on with our talking for a
okay . 158875_159290
with the yellow and green and then we'll do some tests on the core
+< I have another one . 164258_165210
um Kevin are you thinking of a core square that would look the same
I'm thinking about that diagonal flip (be)cause if you take the one
+< okay okay just just a second I &~g I think some people didn't
Brittany scoot in behind Nicole . 183985_187291
Kevin's thinking about a diagonal flip and he wants to talk about
and um the red could like be in the left bottom corner and if you
okay so that tells me what a diagonal flip would do . 236456_239150
listen for a minute Kevin wants you to imagine a core square that
okay . 258773_260388
well that's the diagonal flip he did a diagonal flip he flipped it
it's diagonal . 268778_270613
okay that's a diagonal flip but Kevin what does that have to do
bring that up Nathan . 274316_275083
um we're trying to figure out if &~sidewa if there's ever such a
do you think that's possible to have a core square that looks the
+< mhmm mhmm . 294413_295220
I don't know do some more thinking . 295220_296900
+< this is the core square that Nathan wants us to think about so
you're going to have to watch really carefully okay because this
Sara I'll wait for you to be done . 315135_318073
++ this core square design doesn't have something that makes it
Katy I mean Kelly what do you want to say about that ? 331330_334098
um the way you flip it up um the bottom will be at the top and if
okay I think she's right when I flip it up the top is going to be
yeah . 353428_354996
maybe . 354996_355865
except except the bottom will be at the top . 355865_357960
+< no . 357960_358243
+< okay but I'm saying will an up down flip make this core square
nope . 363273_364156
maybe . 364156_365156
the the yellow could be +/. 365156_368016
+< no because the green is on that side and the yellow's on that
okay are you thinking about this yellow and this green Brian ? 376640_379685
no hunhunh . 379685_380136
these two here ? 380136_381175
yeah . 381175_381520
okay look at where Brian's thinking about . 381520_383350
see this part on the center on the top that has green on your left
and yellow on your right . 388435_390906
Brian is saying he thinks after an up down flip that there will be
right is that what you're saying ? 399715_401626
no they are staying the same except if you did a sideways flip . 401626_405996
that's what we're you're talking to me about okay you think that
we've got to find out . 411340_412308
watch very closely watch the up down flip . 412308_415275
nope . 415275_417000
+< actually the idea Brian first did happen the yellow's now on
left . 420630_421775
left . 421775_422078
+< left . 422078_422458
and the green is one your right so does this look that same as it
no . 425246_426411
no . 426411_426800
no it looks different . 426800_428051
but now we're gonna test and see if it's gonna look the same as a
it won't it won't I can already tell I will look the same +/. 431485_434600
wait wait wait but I'm not gonna do a sideways flip on this I'm
+< it still won't look like that . 443838_444138
okay memorize this yellow on the left green on the right that's
+< it won't work . 453080_453496
the yellow one is is gonna be on the um top +/. 453828_456063
+< wait the yellow is going to be on the right and the green is
you mean after I put it back to the beginning and do a sideways
remember I'm gonna put this back to how it started . 464116_467015
this is the result this is what happened after and up down flip
we're gonna go back to the core square shh Sara and then we're
hold on . 484181_486010
okay this is Nathan's original core square we're gonna do a
+< it's I can tell already it won't look the same . 492701_492883
yes . 492883_494850
it xxx the same . 494850_495558
yellow on your right green on your left at the top . 495558_500235
what happened with this wait did this look any different after a
yeah . 505403_505698
hmm . 505698_506515
yeah . 506515_507598
oh green on the right and yellow on the left watch after a sideways
it's different because the top two colors and all the rest of them
right right what was on the top didn't change like you still have
this is how we started with green on your +... 528500_532400
left and yellow on your right but after a sideways flip yellow is
now is that right ? 541170_543185
yeah . 543185_545836
um no yeah green is on the right um yellow's on the left . 545836_549311
okay that was our sideways flip right ? 549311_552175
uhhuh . 552175_552900
so this is how we started and when we did an up down flip +... 552900_556513
it's the same . 556513_560453
same . 560453_561020
it's the same . 561020_561805
+< it's different . 561805_562333
+< the same as what ? 562333_563220
it's the same as when you did the sideways flip (be)cause +/. 563220_566153
you know what ? 566153_567756
