&=video_clip okay I think we can cut here +... 328045_329305
so this is part of a sort_of thirty two minute video &-uh film recording the process of the the making of Spiral Jetty but you get a kind of idea that you maybe didn't get it so well during lecture of +... 330205_346385
of how significant the process is to the actual meaning behind the piece and how you know you look at it and say like how the heck was that made ? 348315_356355
well literally with a bull dozer right scooping up huge &-uh loads full of stones rocks earth basalt salt and creating the sort_of &-uh the the spiral itself you know foot by foot going back loading up going back . 356475_374655
and you also saw on the clip &-uh Smithson the artist himself right walking out into &-uh the water to set up the sort_of stakes . 375065_383345
so it becomes if you remember when we were talking about minimalism and the idea of phenomenology he becomes very physically implicated and present right in the making of the work (be)cause he connects sort_of bodily with the environment as he stakes out the perimeter the sort_of path &-uh that the spiral jetty will take . 383745_403445
so we see ooh you know this is the coolest thing to watch in reverse I don't know if you have reverse but &-uh it's a cool video to watch in reverse +... 404265_414845
&=laughs:multiple I don't know what it is about &=laughs stones going back up into and having backward splash . 415145_423825
isn't it bizarre ? 423985_424585
&=student_claps yeah . 425065_426025
cool . 426425_427185
so we have with Earthworks as we talked about before this expanding you know definition of art what it's made of where it is &-uh &~wer the relationship between the viewer . 428665_438245
it's certainly far removed from the gallery and the museum space and it seems to be really about process about flux about time . 438905_447885
and you can see in this video how he's making reference to &-uh not only sort_of the idea of now and the process of now while it's being created but &~yo you saw the little cut to dinosaurs so this also reference back to prehistoric time to geologic time &-uh to a much sort_of older slower time . 448225_469825
at the same time he also this piece is also purposefully trying to play with present and potentially future as it becomes okay well now it becomes less cool backwards &=laughs &-uh as it becomes implicated in the daily sort_of environment and activities of this lake and of_course disappears and ends up sort_of being uncreated by the very environment in which it was made . 469945_495605
so you can also get an idea from this video and from the slides that we looked at when we saw this piece as_well_as the other Earthworks that we looked at how important photography and video are in the recording of these works how important photographic process is to our being able to get access to these works right because I don't +//. 498585_523885
I actually haven't ever taken a trip to Spiral Jetty when it was still around I don't know if you have nor have I been to The Lightning Field and so what makes it possible for us to experience these works is photography and video . 524125_535625
so today what we wanna do with the time that we have &-uh we wanna deal with two things . 536325_541805
one thing we wanna do is deal with the concept of postmodernism . 542045_547425
the P word . 548965_549545
AKA pomo .
postmodernism often used to describe visual arts made between the nineteen sixties and the present and what we're gonna do is look specifically at the case of photography . 554675_568355
so the implication of photography &-uh in postmodern practice . 569215_573815
but where we're gonna begin is with a little jaunt a little foray into architecture . 574375_580315
so on the left you have does anyone recognize that building ? 581065_585105
any of you New York City folks ? 585845_589145
Seagram .
very good whoever that was . 589565_592585
Seagram building . 592985_593405
this is by Mies_Van_Der_Rohe . 593685_595265
Mies_Van_Der_Rohe the Seagram building built in the late nineteen fifties and on the right any gamblers in the audience ? 597025_604665
it's Las Vegas .
<New York> New York . 605605_606725
oh sure everyone can recognize <New York> New York in Vegas &=laughs and we got one person who can do Seagram . 607305_611825
hm what does that mean ? 612925_613765
what does that say ? 614085_614905
yes <New York> New York Las Vegas . 615105_617805
have you been there Rhonda ? 618265_619185
yes . 619505_619705
was it fun ? 620305_620905
they have a really nice roller coaster . 621485_622985
they have a really nice roller coaster . 622985_624505
<just like> &~th just like Manhattan . 624765_626185
yeah no . 626465_627845
&-uh so we've got <New York> New York on the right a simulation of New York city right in Las Vegas . 628585_636665
a simulation &-um but not as big right it's sort_of do you know how big it is in relationship to the real thing in terms of scale ? 636905_646545
<it's pretty small> .
relatively speaking small but from a distance it gives you this idea of the high+rise . 647525_653305
so New York becomes a kind of icon &-uh symbolized by what I'm trying not to walk away from mics from with the high+rise can you recognize any of the buildings ? 653425_663685
Chrysler I think Empire State and of_course on the left hand side the Statue of Liberty located +... 663965_671785
in the middle of water near Ellis Island ? 673405_676325
no in the middle of Las Vegas lend me your weary . 676665_679925
&-uh I was gonna make some joke about you know desperate gambling but but I won't (be)cause Las Vegas is about so much more . 681145_689085
albino tigers magic the Rat Pack glamour and &-uh fakeness right ? 689605_698445
the idea of a kind of fake substitution for the real thing . 698845_703625
so Mies_Van_Der_Rohe on the left this is not an example of postmodern architecture but instead high modernism . 704105_709805
modernism with a capital M something that we are +//. 710525_712305
we've become increasingly familiar with . 712965_714625
and how do we know ? 715965_716785
what do we +//. 716925_717265
how do we characterize it stylistically when we look at it ? 717385_720065
is there a_lot_of ornamentation going on ? 720425_722345
no . 723705_724525
no so very sort_of streamlined sparse . 724845_728245
actually if you look at it close up Mies_Van_Der_Rohe the architect who coined the cliche what's become the cliche form follows function . 728605_736445
alright so very sort_of streamlined aesthetic &-uh &~a literally where you &~ca you can sort_of see the construction on the exterior of the building . 737205_746445
and in fact if you had a detailed slide of this building we would see just this teensiest tiniest little bit of applied ornament he's taken &-um steel i@l beams and actually placed them on the exterior of the building going vertically so real vertical emphasis here right . 746905_764205
and those i@l beams don't actually serve as support they in a sense mirror the internal skeletal framework of the building but they in a sense become a kind of &-uh ornament if you will although extremely subtle extremely refined extremely spare . 764545_782245
so in contrast with this idea of high modernism something changes in the sixties seventies eighties and nineties . 782965_790585
and I'll say from the outset that the term that P word postmodernism is extremely contested amongst scholars and critics art historians for example and other theorists . 791345_805885
not agreed upon . 806705_807325
you know don't you wish one time I could come in here and just say you know this equals that ? 807845_811425
wouldn't that be &~n <what a> what a happy world we'd all live in . 812205_814285
but no here I am again . 814745_815905
you know it's a can of worms just like that big modernism word was a can of worms and so is the avant_garde . 816305_822505
some theorists have thought about postmodernism as a kind of radical break from modernism . 823305_828925
so a radical shift from the kind of sort_of stylistic and theoretical example set by somebody like Mies Van_Der_Rohe . 829885_838665
others however argue that it's merely a continuation of modernism . 839685_843905
others still a parody of modernism . 844585_847405
but generally speaking there is a kind of recognition that in the art produced sort_of post sixties in the visual culture produced post sixties a_lot_of that work is concerned with articulating <a crisis> a crisis &-um that speaks to sort_of questioning the cultural authority of the so+called west . 849385_877845
of western European culture and institutions . 878425_884105
so a questioning of that kind of authority that we have seen established &-uh sort_of throughout the twentieth century really . 885225_891065
so one critic wrote in the late seventies quote &{l=READING the nineteen seventies has not been just another decade . 891865_898665
something did happen . 900205_901325
&}l=READING I'm thinking disco ? 901525_902365
&=laughs but wait that can't be it &{l=READING something so momentous that it was ignored in disbelief . 904505_909925
modernity had gone out_of style &}l=READING end quote . 910665_913825
so that sort of gives us hm does that mean this is a sort_of stylistic shift ? 914065_918625
a story about changing style so that we go from &-uh a modernism that values again and go back to your Greenberg right &-uh painting about painting let's say the separation of different kinds of art and a very sort_of narrow definition of what &-um modernist painting modernist architecture should be . 919445_940525
and &~i is the shift then to something like the strip &-uh a kind of amalgamation of which really in the end becomes &-uh an amalgamation a sort_of simulation of something that didn't really exist an &~a a recreated New York City when in fact that just represents sort_of &-uh in a very kind of superficial way the idea of &-uh the metropolis of Manhattan . 941065_969965
so let's look at one artist associated &-uh or excuse_me architect +... 970785_974405
associated with &-uh postmodern architecture . 977565_980885
this is Robert Venturi . 981725_983265
V E N T U R I Venturi . 983825_986845
on the left is his Guild House from Philadelphia early nineteen sixties and on the right is a photograph he made with one of his partners of the &{l=SIC kindler &}l=SIC gentler strip of Las Vegas late nineteen seventies . 987345_1001605
the strip &-um still all about signs all about signs and literally through a sign through a kind of visual icon in this case textual instead of the actual shape in terms of you know like a <New York> New York building the textual sign of getting your attention right trying to say like <come here> come here . 1002825_1023945
Star Dust .
Gold Key Motel . 1024565_1026325
Shopping Center . 1026805_1027825
loose slots . 1028225_1029245
I mean what more do you need to get you to go inside the front doors ? 1029885_1033005
so Venturi along with other architects in the sixties and seventies instead sorta turns against this very limited vocabulary of high modernist art architecture and embraces the much more pluralistic and in a sense pop culture values associated with a place like Las Vegas . 1034585_1059705
and he publishes along with Denise Scott Brown a book called Learning from Las Vegas in the nineteen seventies in which you know he +//. 1060225_1068365
they talk about embracing these lessons of pop &~ar architecture . 1068665_1071645
so no longer minding the split in a sense between mass culture everyday pop kitsch right this is how we've thought about it in this class . 1072465_1081205
&-um but saying these are all sort_of valid vocabularies for architectural practice . 1082285_1086085
it doesn't hafta be the all streamlined form follows function business of Mies_Van_Der_Rohe . 1086505_1093905
that you can incorporate a whole range of styles &-uh and not be limited in that kind of sense . 1094005_1100905
so another example of this is this is &-uh Charles Moore his Piazza D_Italia &~f in New Orleans anyone been here +..? 1101725_1110745
the late nineteen seventies as well . 1113105_1115365
and again oftentimes &-uh postmodernism as it's thought of in terms of a stylistic shift stylistically it's often characterized as contradictory . 1117745_1132825
as embracing parts from various different styles historical styles and so therefore it's often thought of as being kind of schizophrenic right it's doesn't present necessarily one point of view one +//. 1133465_1147185
doesn't back one sort_of you know this is my style and I'm gonna go with it I'm gonna &~t borrow and take from a whole bunch of different &-um historical times +... 1147785_1157305
so it's very eclectic &-uh you get the sense of a pastiche and certainly of what we'll see with photography too appropriation . 1159105_1166585
and perhaps for us in terms of a a &~pulp popular culture technique &-uh artistic strategy the idea of appropriation is most familiar to us through music I would think . 1167485_1180505
right how many songs today &-uh and really for the last two decades are actually samples right samples from other songs that are then put together and then sort_of given a maybe slightly different vocal or new beat right sampling very popular you're all familiar with that right ? 1181215_1199435
mhm yeah . 1199795_1200235
so we'll see the same kind of strategy architecturally we'll see the same kind of strategy visually with photography . 1200535_1206535
poor Piazza D_Italia , when I was there in &-um oh man it was like early nineties like a decade ago &-uh it was full of trash . 1207515_1217535
it was so sad . 1217995_1218675
there were just huge heaps of literal garbage all through it and yet oftentimes it becomes this example of postmodern architecture . 1218795_1227115
I'm I'm pretty sure it's reproduced in the Arnasan Prather book . 1227375_1229455
and here we have Charles Moore who I think you can get the idea is very playfully engaging with a whole range of architectural styles . 1230325_1236945
right he's got the sort_of Vegas neon along the same lines +//. 1237665_1241125
well in the same project he's got &-um different all sorts of different types of columns making reference to ancient architecture to Greek architecture Roman arches &-uh etcetera etcetera and even being so self-reflexive and self-referential that in the little in the corners of these little arches here &-uh are little heads which maybe you can sort_of little faces you can perhaps just begin to make out and those are actual &-uh based on his own face . 1241645_1271625
ego ?
so a very sort_of self-referential practice too where you're constantly sort_of calling into question &-uh your own ability to sort_of represent &-uh in this case yourself as_well_as sort_of past architectural styles just globbing them all together +... 1274505_1291465
hm .
so in addition I think that we hafta think about the idea of postmodernism certainly we can see stylistic shifts but we should also consider how the world had been changing economically and also politically . 1296025_1310785
so that beginning in the nineteen sixties +... 1312105_1314365
oftentimes marked as a new economic era the sort_of era of late capitalism where really we see &-uh interpenetration of government and big business to an extent that we hadn't seen before and I think you can remember back to Lisa's lecture &-uh on Wednesday on the work of Hans Hocka an artist who was &~i is explicitly commenting on the interrelationship between &-uh government big business and the arts . 1317775_1342975
and politically of_course this is almost <in your> within your own memories &-uh although not quite . 1345185_1353425
we have beginning in the sixties &-uh the increase of a really radical political landscape right that sort_of starts with student uprisings in Europe and certainly infiltrates university campuses &-uh in the United States particularly this campus for example . 1354745_1373305
&-uh and in nineteen seventy with the bombings of Cambodia and the killings of students at Kent State University &-uh shortly after those there was the founding +//. 1374185_1384745
I think that you mentioned this Lisa . 1384905_1386325
the founding of the New York art strike . 1386445_1387985
you didn't mention that ? 1388585_1389645
what was the group that &-uh Hocka was part of ? 1389825_1391945
WAC .
oh .
+, worker's arts worker's artists ⌈ coalition ⌉ .
⌊ that other ⌋ group . 1392705_1395665
so also artists mobilizing with &~sp &~sp specific political &-uh intentions and goals . 1396905_1403325
so for example with New York art strike &-uh made up of a large group of New York artists and writers and also art dealers . 1403905_1409985
&-um some of their actions included sit+ins at the steps of the Metropolitan Museum and also inside the Whitney and the Guggenheim &-uh the mounting of exhibitions for peace and of_course as the seventies progress our involvement in Vietnam &-uh is stepped up and &~pe &-uh other groups also are fighting for political social and artistic enfranchisement . 1410625_1433845
and that increases and so art also takes on a real &-um serious &-uh political edge . 1434945_1443365
(0.4) but first back to our old favorites . 1443965_1451485
so on the left we have the artist gee I don't know &=laughs Pollock &~an do you remember the title ? 1452165_1459505
Lavender Mist .
Lavender Mist . 1460305_1461565
do you remember the date ? 1461805_1462305
nineteen fifty right that's sort_of the date that we have for him . 1464325_1466325
and on the right the artist ? 1466725_1467705
Andy Warhol .
Andy Warhol and the title ? 1468505_1471185
The Marilyn Diptych .
The Marilyn Diptych sixty two and the process ? 1472745_1476125
photo silk screen .
photo silk screen . 1477325_1478885
so what we have beginning in the sixties right with an artist like Warhol that we've seen or perhaps somebody like Rauschenberg and we've talked about this before a real revolt against the version of modernism that critics like Clement Greenberg had been proponents of . 1480305_1499105
so rather than a history of modernism as the logical unfolding toward &-uh Jackson Pollock and abstract expressionism a group of artists who were working in very different ways and continue &-uh sort_of passed down to other artists in the seventies and eighties instead wanting to explore the kinds of contradictions and contingencies involved in art making in the social world and the political world at the time . 1501105_1529585
so really against this kind of depoliticized version of modernist high art against the idea of high art &-uh as being formally pure against this idea of purity against the idea of autonomy and the desire instead to remerge art with life . 1530515_1547855
(0.5) so artists and we've seen this again we see this with Warhol taking issue with ideas of originality with authenticity with autonomy by attacking the notion +//. 1552315_1562675
what's that other A word that we used in relationship to Benjamin in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction ? 1562815_1567715
aura .
attacking aura right ? 1568035_1569635
we see that pretty clearly with Warhol in the sense you know I talked about this a little bit with the Marilyn Monroe and the repetition of her face both in color and then black and white as it sort of fades out this idea that there is &-uh a kind of unbridgeable distance from the original . 1569995_1589495
there's no way to get back to the original in the Warhol in a sense because what are we getting back to but a film still icon of Marilyn Monroe . 1590285_1599805
a kind of self-created &-uh studio created image of the star . 1600205_1605985
so there's this idea of how do you even &~g where is the original here ? 1607325_1609845
how do you even get back to an original ? 1609965_1611305
is there even a possibility of an original in this work ? 1612565_1615805
and without the presence of &~th of an original how can there be aura ? 1616225_1620065
how does this complicate &-uh through photographic reproduction that idea of Benjamin's of the existence of aura and how crucial the idea of aura is &-uh to understand the kind of value attributed to the gestural abstract expressionism of a painter like Jackson Pollock ? 1620165_1637825
so &~we we're seeing this contestation of the uniqueness of the work of art really intensifying in the past three decades sort_of taking off with artists in the sixties and continuing to be questioned through different kinds of &-uh pictorial strategies in the seventies eighties and nineties and really again what better medium to exploit and explore &-uh this idea of aura and authenticity than with the photograph ? 1639465_1665885
(0.6) so on the left here we have Sherrie Levine (0.4) After Rodchenko . 1669975_1678355
nineteen eighty three . 1678475_1681655
Levine Sherrie Levine After Rodchenko in nineteen eighty three . 1682215_1684815
Sherrie Levine an artist and this is an example of her work an artist who becomes relatively prominent &-uh in the nineteen eighties . 1685115_1695155
and she works +... 1695955_1696955
for the most part with the pirated print . 1699175_1703075
she's stealing photographs basically that have already been made by &-uh relatively usually canonical artists . 1704095_1710995
Alexander Rodchenko someone you're familiar with for example or people from &-uh artists from the canon of modern photography Edward Weston would be another example . 1712155_1721735
or Walker Evans who you saw briefly when we talked about FSA photographs . 1722675_1726055
After Rodchenko . 1726765_1727685
so she actually takes the print and displays it as her own work . 1727845_1732405
she takes them in different ways sometimes she rephotographs sometimes she takes posters +... 1733125_1736605
according to Douglas Crimp who writes about postmodern photography quote &{l=READING a group of young artists &}l=READING and he's referring to Levine &{l=READING working with photography have addressed photography's claims to originality showing those claims for the fiction they are . 1738045_1752885
showing photography to be always a representation . 1753305_1756605
always already seen . 1757885_1759085
their images are purloined confiscated appropriated stolen in their work the original cannot be located . 1759465_1766105
&}l=READING so again and you see an artist here Levine deconstructing the modernist notion of the original . 1767105_1774245
and you should think about this and this &~a as being part of a lineage of art production in the twentieth century a lineage starting really with what artist ? 1775335_1783935
(0.4) the big D right ? 1787855_1789595
right with Duchamp . 1789815_1790915
so again we shouldn't +//. 1791835_1793075
and this can influence how you yourself wanna think about postmodernism &~h and how you define it but here we're picking up of_course practices from &-uh much earlier in the twentieth century . 1793145_1804505
but you also wanna think about how they're different right how these kinds how how pirating a a photograph let's say and showing it sort of as your work how that kind of gesture is different what are the different kinds of implications between that and say &-uh taking a urinal and displaying it under the name &-uh R Mutt . 1805785_1825145
so appropriation here &-uh we can see as being a &~r a very key strategy in postmodern photography . 1825605_1832645
and here again she's questioning as Warhol is the idea of autonomy she's refusing authorship and in that sense dismantling that notion of the unique original work of art with aura . 1833465_1846405
right how does this have aura anymore ? 1847065_1849205
and then what does it mean for it not to ? 1849965_1852205
how does this become part of &-uh a gallery system for example ? 1852365_1856785
how does this become part of the commodity system part of the art market ? 1856845_1859805
so appropriation as a very key strategy in postmodern photographic practice . 1860625_1868305
two other artists we have here on the right &-uh is Richter R I C H T E R +... 1868965_1876465
a photopainting@n called Betty <it's a> it's a painting based on a photograph and on the right Boltanski B O I'm just giving you last names B O L T A N S K I and again these are taken straight from your final exam slide list . 1879205_1892865
this is the drawer from nineteen eighty eight . 1893065_1894945
so it's a installation right multimedia he's using a photograph a light and of_course a drawer . 1896125_1902965
(0.4) according to Richter &{l=READING I pursue no objectives no system no tendency . 1906625_1912325
I have no program no style no direction . 1912825_1915405
&}l=READING seems like a bit of a nihilist no ? 1916205_1917265
&{l=READING I have no time for specialized concerns working themes or variations that lead to mastery . 1917465_1922605
&}l=READING again mastery is a kind of notion tied up with high modernism . 1923465_1926965
right with Pollock right that there can be this idea of this &-uh well on the one hand this sort_of master creator this master genius and then with Greenberg in terms of a critical point of view a master reading like one way to read the &~k this kind of work . 1927605_1942385
I &~st back to Richter &{l=READING I steer clear of definitions I don't know what I want . 1943465_1948485
&}l=READING oh isn't that so true for most of us . 1949445_1951085
&{l=READING I am inconsistent noncommittal passive . 1951565_1953705
I like the indefinite the boundless I like continual uncertainty . 1953995_1958215
&}l=READING so certainly voicing a_lot_of &-uh the kinds of concerns in a sense of some artists associated with postmodernism right instead of being like sort_of heroic &-um you know modernist &-uh artist . 1959615_1976535
here is a trace of my genius &-uh taking a much different approach &-uh philosophically towards his own artistic production . 1977155_1986775
I steer clear of definitions I don't even know what I want I'm inconsistent you know I take from a_lot_of different sources I create a_lot_of different kinds of work and in fact he's an artist that ranges from a kind of photorealism in this painting based on a photograph to complete sort_of abstract paintings . 1987575_2004215
this portrait in particular on the left is made of his teenage daughter Betty again based on a photograph and we can make comparisons between this work and the Boltanski on the right and how they're using the photograph &-uh in a sense . 2006795_2023375
on the one hand to recall &-uh how oftentimes we think of the photograph particularly the photograph of a person functioning right to record individual characteristics to give us a document of that person a kind of map of that person's individual face and and the features that describe that individual person . 2024825_2045505
but they're subverting that right &~th that practice Richter is because her head's turned so we don't get her face we get the back of her head instead and furthermore he's blurred the edges slightly . 2045505_2057165
so the painting has this strange quality of being on the one hand &-uh sort_of based in a kind of photorealism on the other hand we're denied access to her face and we're also given a +//. 2057425_2070785
&~th the really sort_of blurred edge so that you get the question of you can't really necessarily define with any specificity the subject through image making through photography nor through the painting based on the photograph . 2071025_2085405
Boltanski and what I'll do is I'll forward to another one of his works on the left . 2086085_2089965
this is another work by Boltanski &~Monu &-uh called Monuments also referred to as the &~t Children of Dijon made from the mid eighties . 2091995_2101275
Boltanski often in his multimedia installations uses &-uh anonymous photographs and places them in a really kind_of poignant way with light directed onto their surfaces . 2103295_2117555
but with the example of drawer on the right we get this idea again of this portrait right this close+up of a face &-uh that maybe reminds you of I don't know a high school yearbook photograph maybe a yearbook college yearbook photograph on the other hand . 2118225_2135065
it's so blurred that the actual identity of the person is obscured . 2135385_2139345
so again &~y he's playing around with this idea of photographic truthfulness . 2140325_2144905
and then it's furthermore &~ob obscured at the same time it's highlighted by the placement of this light fixture which on the one hand literally like bars your vision right you can't see the center of the image because it's being blocked by this light . 2145905_2161085
at the same time it's actually illuminating the rest of the image so this constant sort of tension between revealing using the photograph to sort_of reveal the &~speci &-uh the specificity of identity at the same time sort_of denying you access to that actual individual . 2161665_2176905
so it becomes this just sort_of implied presence instead . 2177805_2181185
also in the Monuments on the left &-uh as you can see very small individual portraits some smiling some sort_of more passive and strewn in between them &-uh these lights . 2181915_2195475
and some of his work including the Monuments on the left is making reference to &-uh prewar Jewish children , &-uh school photographs that had been taken of children who of_course never returned to their schools after the Second World War . 2195665_2210905
so you get this again this idea of photography on the one hand of evoking a kind of anonymity but one that speaks potentially for you know <millions of> millions of of specific lives extinguished lost &-uh extinguished . 2211665_2226505
but as he's sort_of recalling them &-uh through the individual sort_of lights placed around the photograph +... 2226705_2235005
<so they become> and you can see this is sort_of in a kind of church setting . 2235345_2237965
&-uh ironically they become really evocative of again lost presence . 2238745_2245845
(0.5) I wanna show you one other artist two other artists on the left is Patrick Nagatani . 2246205_2256705
N A G A T A N I . 2257225_2259765
Nagatani and this is his National Atomic Museum Kirtland Air Force Base nineteen eighty nine color photograph . 2263285_2269465
on the right &-uh an image by Jeff Wall W A L L called stumbling block from nineteen ninety one . 2270725_2278165
color transparency light and display case . 2279285_2281965
now we've seen artists who are using &~a the appropriated image right who are taking already made images and incorporating them into their work . 2282925_2289805
here are two examples of artists who instead +... 2290635_2293375
instead create a very self-consciously composed manipulated and fictionalized image . 2293795_2301615
so use photography as a kind of basis to create a whole tableau kind of almost stage set and again this too calls into question the truthfulness of the photographic image and the kind of fiction that &-uh photographs often construct . 2302375_2318315
so they're using the apparent truthfulness of photography sort_of against itself . 2319305_2323265
an artist like Jeff Wall is gonna create &-uh these tableaus these sort_of scenes of drama this sort_of slice of narrative &-uh blow them up alter them computerly +//. 2323885_2336445
&-uh with a computer blow them up backlight them they're transparencies that are then backlit &-um and according to Wall they exist in quote unquote the grey area between the theatrical and the real . 2336865_2349545
so that's the image on the right . 2350825_2351865
Nagatani on the left he uses photographs generally speaking as backdrops in a sense so this Kirtland Air Force Base is a black and white photograph that he's taken . 2353365_2365045
then he goes back to his studio &-uh he blows the image up usually it's a sort_of over life+size put its in &~th &~pu puts it in the back of a studio and then starts to layer other images and painting over that original photograph . 2365805_2381085
&-um so here's he's obviously painted a_lot_of the backdrop red he's taken photographs these are actually family members though that's not necessarily relevant &-uh made photographs of them &-uh enlarged them made them into sort_of &~cudb cardboard cutouts cut them out and then hung them in the space of his studio so can you you maybe can start to make out can you see these thin lines going down ? 2382225_2403765
these are holding up the sort_of cardboard cutouts of his family that have been you know costume dressed in kimonos eating sushi and then he himself sort_of at a last second this is the artist Nagatani inserts himself physically into the image and then the work of art is a photograph then taken of the entire tableau . 2404775_2425615
so it becomes reinterpreted it sort of starts with a photograph and it ends with a photograph but in between there are multiple layers of different kinds of artistic gesture including painting other photography he'll build models and hang them from the the top of the studio . 2426745_2440665
&-uh and as you can see here this is part of a larger body of work called nuclear enchantment in which he's dealing with in particular the nuclear history of the state of New Mexico where he lives . 2442045_2454065
and I think maybe you can make out in the reflection this is actually his mother Diane in the reflection of her sunglasses Aaron who's in the front ? 2455145_2465305
can you see what's in the reflection of her sunglasses ? 2465445_2467045
can you see in the front ? 2468845_2469485
a mushroom cloud . 2469765_2470785
right so the idea is she's looking off into the distance and seeing the effects of &~i of an explosion of a nuclear bomb . 2471385_2477245
(0.5) so again this idea of &-uh using photography as a piece in a sense &-uh to create this kind of fictional tableau . 2481265_2489065
I wanna show you one other work by Nagatani &-uh +... 2490205_2494565
this is called Japanese American Concentration Camps Manzanar nineteen ninety four a color photograph . 2496345_2502425
and so this is late eighties this is sort_of mid nineties on the right hand side . 2503305_2511325
so in this work on the left with &~i with his nuclear enchantment series he's working very much in the kind of of vocabulary that is often associated with postmodernism . 2513765_2525005
&-um this idea of on the one hand &-uh appropriation but the different layering of different kinds of artistic gesture &~a and technique building models and creating this whole sort_of fictionalized tableau . 2525705_2539065
but on the right hand side in this work he instead is using unmanipulated color landscape images and this becomes part of another series another portfolio called &-uh Japanese American Concentration Camps and just briefly to mention &-uh the sort_of background behind this piece his &-um parents who you see here and there during World War Two had been incarcerated in internment camps &-uh his father in Arkansas and his mother in Manzanar in California . 2539865_2569845
and along with basically the rest of the population of Japanese descent along the west coast of the United States . 2575385_2582165
this is after the bombing of Pearl Harbor . 2583025_2584425
and Nagatani who grew up not knowing or hearing very much about this experience of incarceration +//. 2585485_2591725
he was born just after the war . 2592405_2594425
decided in the nineties to &~s go back to these sites and photograph the remains of these camps . 2595485_2600025
decided to make a kind_of connection to this experience of &~i of not only his parents but of &-uh Japanese Americans in this country , a really sort_of &-uh incredibly important experience . 2600005_2612325
and so he goes back to those sites and you can see in the image on the right Manzanar's located in southern California +//. 2612865_2618525
maybe some of you have been there . 2619185_2620245
it's it +//. 2620405_2620665
you can go visit it now . 2620745_2621645
it's about two hundred and fifty miles northeast of Los Angeles . 2622105_2624745
and in the background you can see really dramatic mountains in the foreground these stone steps &-um and if you go there you see a_lot_of sort_of ruins of remains of the incarcerated population who was held there in the nineteen forties &-uh including his mother . 2626265_2642385
so these idea this these ruined steps that &~i that lead really to nowhere right so you get this kind of eerie &-um idea of of this past crime this sort_of past purpose that this land was put to . 2642825_2656765
and again it's a &~ver stylistically very different practice than what's going on in his earlier work on the left . 2657665_2665765
but I don't think we need to think about postmodernism again . 2666005_2669045
the trap is to think about &~i about it purely in sort_of stylistic terms . 2669085_2672565
and instead I think we need to open it up and think a little bit about more &-uh in terms of meaning and in terms of content in terms of purpose . 2673065_2680085
so with the image on the right and with that body of work he seems to be coming trying to come to terms with this certain &-uh traumatic event of the past . 2681145_2691245
&-um as in a sense he's doing with the nuclear history of New Mexico as Boltanski is doing in the work that we saw just a couple slides before . 2691985_2700765
and at the same time he's also Nagatani on the right in particular is focusing &-uh although it seems maybe not so overtly because he's using landscape but really focusing on the politics of identity . 2701785_2714345
right of looking back into his past &-uh and into the past of all &-uh Japanese Americans in this country and this kind of shared &-uh traumatic experience that they endured during the Second World War . 2714895_2728855
&=pause_while_waiting_for_slide Djuum .
I'm sure you all know her . 2730195_2736155
I'm sure you all know her well here we have Cindy Sherman . 2737055_2739215
Cindy Sherman one of the most &-uh well known artists who really comes to prominence in the nineteen eighties these are two of her &~un untitled film stills from the late seventies . 2740895_2752375
two untitled film stills from the late seventies . 2753655_2756095
and we see here +//. 2757255_2758255
and as we'll continue &-um next week we'll look a little bit at Sherman at &-uh other women artists in the eighties Barbara Kruger Lorna Simpson and the Gorilla Girls . 2758585_2771925
and we'll think about how these strategies of photographic appropriation and the construction of the tableau the sort_of fictionalized photograph how those these artists in particular are using these strategies to on the one hand again comment on the politics of identity but also do so particularly on the role and the representation of women . 2771945_2793825
so have an excellent weekend and I'll see you on Monday . 2794565_2796165
