Redacted_name so ‡ &-um how old are you ?
thirty one .
thirty one .
you feel .
okay okay .
and what would you consider your ethnicity or your race or whatever ?
&-uh I'm 'a say black and creole .
black and creole ?
yeah ‡ I'm from New_Orleans, you feel me .
got got that little creole running in my blood as_well .
oh .
okay .
nah ‡ that's a real thing and that's definitely something I wanna possibly touch on .
okay .
&-um how long have you been in Atlanta ?
&-uh to be honest with you I been in Atlanta &+m more that what motherfuckers really actually even think you feel .
but I'm 'a say <about a good> about a good maybe ten, fifteen, you feel me, years, you feel me „ like .
mm .
yeah ‡ but I &+st I still go back home .
I still originate with my roots, you feel me, you_know touch touch bases with my family and you_know &+s be around my people „ you_know .
+< mm .
you real half and half right now .
yeah ‡ man I'm Noga N_O_G_A man, you know what I mean .
you said Noga ?
&=laughs .
Noga ‡ you feel me .
New_Orleans_Georgia man .
I like that .
I like that .
so ‡ &-um were you down here before the &+k Katrina incident ?
actually I actually had graduated two thousand five .
and &-um I was home <probably like> probably like$co three, four months you_know, and then then Katrina hit while I was home .
+< mhm &=inhales .
while you was home where ?
&+s in Louisiana .
New_Orleans Louisiana, be you_know precise .
you was there when that bih hit ?
I was there when that bitch hit .
&+s so was it the whole state or was it just some of it ?
<it was> it was basically like New_Orleans, the whole New_Orleans, uptown, downtown .
real New_Orleans .
mm .
the east, you know what I mean .
like ‡ everything really got real fucked up down there, you feel me .
+< mm .
you_know a_lot_of a_lot_of a_lot_of people lost they lives .
a_lot_of floods took took everything out, you feel me .
and also one thing I'd like to say is like$co &-um in the ninth ward, you feel me, like$co they blew the levee „ bro .
+< mhm .
<I don't> like ‡ people people are gonna say what they wanna say .
but at the end of the day, <that levee> that levee been blown before .
and the damage that was done to the levee, a a flood or hurricane literally couldn't do that type of damage, you feel what I'm saying .
mm .
&+s yeah so you_know .
that's discouraging xxx to hear .
yeah yeah „ man .
but you_know ‡ I'm always pro &-um <what's the word> conspiracy theory and shit .
yeah .
and I feel like that was definitely something folks was mentioning but you_know kind_of got swept to the side a little bit .
yeah ‡ you feel me .
hm .
do you feel like it's any possible way that &-um somebody breaking the levees would possibly help that situation at that time ?
not necessarily .
I feel like they &+b they broke the levee for, at the end of the day, everything else in New_Orleans, especially the up and the &+down downtown New_Orleans as far as the ninth ward, like$co to get flooded, you feel me, for you_know not &+ins not insurances policies but at the end of the day <for like> to to bring hurt towards the people .
+< mm .
you_know ‡ New_Orleans is a very, I'm 'a use this word, Sin_City city, you feel me .
mm .
and <it's a_lot_of> it's a_lot_of stuff that people you_know don't understand that go on .
a_lot_of people say voodoo, you_know Geechee stuff go down there, but at the end of the day it's it's really that .
+< mhm .
you_know ‡ it's a_lot_of sin „ you_know .
so .
mm .
in my eyes I really look at it like you_know in the bible god said you_know like$co he &+w he will <cleanse the> &+l cleanse the earth .
and I feel <like New_Orleans> that hurricane Katrina and hurricane Rita had cleansed New_Orleans to a certain extent .
mm .
you_know .
mm mm ‡ that's very very interesting .
I don't know how deep of your new &+o New_Orleans knowledge you got .
yeah .
but you_know ‡ I'm 'a at least ask, see if I can learn something out_of this joint .
&+m yeah ‡ you got to .
you got to .
&-um let's we gonna double back to N_O right quick .
let's get to the G_A part .
alright .
so ‡ &-um you was done with &-um &+s school, like grade school, <when you> &-um before you got to Atlanta „ right ?
yeah yeah yeah yeah .
mm .
so ‡ how was that transition from moving to N_O to Georgia ?
you don't got no friends from high school or you_know shit like that .
how did you &-um adjust ?
did you have family down here ?
&-uh we my cousin Redacted_name stayed down here you_know and &-um cousin Redacted_name useta stay with us in the past, you feel me .
he he went through <a little> <a little> a little drug problem but you_know god touched his heart &+a and saved him, you feel me, and made him bounce back how he's sposta .
so ‡ we end up staying with him and his wife and his two daughters, you feel me, so you_know that that put a big insight as far as Atlanta .
you_know so ‡ <we had> we had a little family down here .
mm .
but everything was totally different, you_know trees, the hills, not the city „ you_know .
like you_know ‡ just moving around, people was different, the accents „ you_know .
but you_know ‡ &+y you be one place long enough, you &+l you learn a vibe .
you learn <how to> how to educate yourself with certain certain things „ you_know .
mm .
okay .
so ‡ the vibe „ shoo okay .
so ‡ how much has the vibe changed from I guess ten years ago in Atlanta to now, in regards to just lingo ?
alright ‡ <I'm 'a> I'm 'a say this like +/.
Atlanta lingo .
alright like you_know ‡ they had the goodie mobs, the Outkast, you feel me „ you_know .
mhm .
Atlanta always embraced like$co other states with music, you_know trynna find theyself, you feel me .
but &=tsks &+i it it was really the goodie mobs and the Outkast that really brought Atlanta really <to the> to the market of mainstream as far as like$co music, you get what I'm saying .
and niggas was able to understand where niggas was coming from, you feel me .
mhm .
and but now these days it's like, like I said, other states influence Atlanta .
Atlanta is is a place where it's not just people from Atlanta .
it's people from different countries, people from different states, so it's it's one big swag pool .
+< mhm .
one big sauce pool, you feel me „ so like .
&=laughs .
you_know like ‡ when I came down here it was GDs and Crips .
+< that's cool .
mhm .
you_know .
now ‡ it's majority bloods and Crips you_know, so at the end of the day it's like you_know &+s something influenced something, you get what I'm saying, in order for things to be a_little different .
+< mhm .
mm .
I think that's a real real great point .
so so ‡ sauce@q, swag@q, what would be another word for that ?
flavor@q .
flavor@q .
&=laughs gotta have that flavor, gotta have that drip .
&=laughs flavor@q .
<you gotta have that> &+fla you just gotta have that drip, gotta you know what I mean .
it's like +//.
&=laughs .
it's so many things you could say .
mhm .
but now Atlanta is the state that influence other states .
mhm .
everybody wanna either have a_little Atlanta when they rap, when they dress .
+< just a_little .
mhm .
you_know ‡ just like what that boy name is ?
in in New_York I Milly rock .
mm .
you know what I mean, like$co he from the A but he moved to New_York .
yeah .
that <gucci gang> gucci gang, he not from Atlanta, you see what I'm saying „ like .
xxx .
sound like it though .
you feel me .
it's it's a_lot_of people that done got influenced from Atlanta (be)cause Atlanta was like$co the state that they looked at like that the down east coast, you feel me, like +"/.
+< xxx .
+" oh them niggas ‡ ain't them niggas slow .
+" they don't talk fast, you feel me .
&=laughs .
but now at the end of the day, everybody on they dick .
yeah .
you feel me „ so .
mm .
you_know so ay ‡ that's you_know that just my my way I see things in my eyes, you feel me „ so .
okay .
well yup ‡ I would say you been here for a &+s quite some time, it seem .
quite some time .
seen a_lot_of shit .
you seen some ups and some downs and certain people and situations .
mhm .
do you have any &-um proclamations on the future possibly ?
any trends you see ?
I feel like if Atlanta keep on going the way they going, they could probably run about a good nother ten years .
mm .
before something else really just +/.
okay like ‡ it just gotta swing back over .
yeah ‡ you_know a +/.
Atlanta be winning so hard right now .
&+al hard right now .
<it's like> <but you_know> but you_know everything is a full circle .
+< hard as shit .
you_know ‡ it start somewhere .
mhm .
and everybody have they time, then it come back to where it originated from „ you_know .
so ‡ it &+a it all depends on how you look at it .
<you_know like nigga> you_know like ‡ I remember Busta_Rhymes had some shit where <he diss> he dissed Atlanta on that that New_York, whatever song that was, you feel me, you know what I mean .
mhm .
yeah .
you_know like ‡ California wasn't messing with Atlanta „ you_know .
mhm .
it's like it was a whole bunch of different things, you feel me, and a_lot_of niggas came from a_lot_of states, you feel me, that had they own little swag, you feel me .
but at the end of the day <when you> which if you really listen to some shit on the radio, if you ain't really hearing niggas that sound like they from Atlanta, you hearing Atlanta niggas, and if not that, you hearing r_and_b shit .
&=laughs .
but also I'm 'a say this though .
&=laughs .
you know what I mean, like +/.
r_and_b niggas took the Atlanta swag too .
yeah ‡ and they they &+ra they ran with it, you know what I mean, but it you know <it's still> it's still not like +/.
xxx .
like ‡ to me in my eyes everybody wanna be a Migo, you feel me .
yeah yeah yeah .
Migos are hard, don't get me wrong, you feel me .
everybody wanna be a Migo .
everybody wanna, you know what I mean, like$co sound like the Migos .
mhm .
you know what I mean, and at the end of the day, you feel me, amigos they they they put they work in, you feel me, so you know what I mean, I respect it, you feel me .
I ain't a hater .
I &+b I respect it, you feel me .
mhm .
but at the end of the day one everybody was trying to be TI's at first Shawty Los_Gucci_Manes, you feel me .
so ‡ it's like Atlanta bite Atlanta swag, you feel me .
+< mm yup .
mm .
and they been doing it so niggas get away with certain shit .
but when it come from a different state then niggas want beef with the next nigga, you feel me, (be)cause they ain't from the a@l, you feel me .
mm .
so .
because niggas in the a@l kind_of understand this is really the culture, whether you rapping about it or not .
yeah .
you talking like this and this is going on „ you_know .
the Migos kind_of just really highlighting some shit we done already known .
knew yeah .
or just able to highlight the shit first that's really +//.
you_know .

and I get that with the culture you_know type shit going, &+i it kind_of bring even more meaning to my eyes &+i in that type of way, like niggas &+be been saying dabbed@q and pipe@q +/.
