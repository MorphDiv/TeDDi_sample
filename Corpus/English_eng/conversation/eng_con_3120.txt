++ xxx . 0_2915
did they fold on the video ? 2915_4565
no but we thought about folding . 4565_6980
+< anything ? 5733_6980
we thought about folding ? 6983_7750
we thought about folding what ? 7750_8820
the quilt . 8820_9920
the whole quilt ? 9920_11121
and the two by two and the core square . 11121_15225
okay so we actually thought about symmetry in all three of those
+^ we thought about the core square is it symmetrical or not then
and we were able to tell how they were symmetrical . 30183_34000
whether that line of symmetry went across . 34000_36645
whether it went up and down . 36645_37771
or in some cases it was a diagonal line of symmetry . 37771_41723
you guys were very skilled at finding that and this video moves
okay Alex . 49000_50481
um well I did see one design that almost looked like a sun . 50481_55553
okay one of the designs reminded you of a sun okay . 55553_59276
Amanda . 59276_59971
xxx . 59971_63900
great . 63900_64575
okay Katy what are you thinking ? 64575_66360
um one of the designs reminded me of xxx . 66360_70428
okay what else besides designs ? 70428_72000
+^ what else <did this> does this video watching it the last
Ashley tell me something different you were thinking about as you
um the +... 91365_103000
what was something about the video that you understood a lot better
the two the two the two two by two designs . 110641_128000
okay the two by two designs . 128000_129000
+^ what do you think you understand better about two by two designs
hold on . 135246_139093
the question that you're asking is um you said that one thing you
excuse me Brittany is not part of our lesson . 146771_149500
uh what do you think you understand better about two by two designs
um that the um like +... 157260_170000
+< Nathan . 157260_170000
do you think you could tell someone who doesn't know much about
yeah . 175226_178201
yeah ? 178201_180000
what would you tell (th)em ? 180000_180810
<pretend I know nothing of> pretend I know nothing about um
what would you tell me so I went two by two design what the heck is
that it's four core squares . 194770_202811
+< Nathan you have to sit and listen . 202811_203493
okay it's four core squares . 203493_205176
and it's sometimes um if you don't have a core square that's
+< uhhuh . 230828_231245
you mean I can start with core squares and take four of (th)em none
yeah . 238670_239670
wow did you know that when we started ? 239670_241336
<&~ye> no . 241336_243238
no but <&~d> you know it now you just told us about it . 243238_246090
good job Ashley putting into words something you learned and that
Asratu can you tell me something that the video helped make you
well well I never knew there was such a thing as a core see I
and now what's your understanding of that word core ? 281498_284783
xxx . 284783_286805
what does that mean to you now now that we've learned a lot about
it's like something that has like um like it's like a design like a
mmhm . 305348_305998
++ and it has like designs in it and like it's like a two by two
and you take four cores to make a two by two ? 315813_319000
okay <what's> why is it important to know about core squares
who can talk to me some more about that word ? 323900_326463
+^ Asratu's saying the first time we watched this video we didn't
we hadn't done any thinking about that before . 332940_335270
who can tell me now some of what they've learned about core square
+^ Sara what do you know now about core squares ? 344443_346578
I know that um core squares make up the two by twos so you can put
+< you're making the same core square over and over and over again
um thirty six times . 382853_384876
do you think Sara's right ? 384876_385845
does the <quilt take thirty> the finished quilt the sizes that
+< yes . 390000_395096
+^ that sounds boring to me . 395096_396813
it's not . 396813_398550
+< making the same core square thirty six times . 398550_400565
it's not boring ? 400565_401733
it's fun . 401733_403806
it's fun Brittany says . 403806_404885
+< it wasn't boring um I know it is (be)cause it wasn't boring when
okay so Sara's saying she wasn't bored at all during our final
Jenna how do you do that ? 445248_446998
xxx . 446998_449016
oh hold that idea then hold your idea we'll come to you next . 449016_451173
Alex can you tell me how you can use thirty six core squares that
well see on the video it wasn't boring because it was like
okay did but the quilts that you made with your partners they
no . 480373_481090
no ? 481090_481741
oh so it wasn't just computerization or technology that makes
but we liked the video and we liked the quilts we made . 490796_494503
how come we liked quilts we made that had thirty six core squares
(be)cause they weren't plain . 498303_500823
++ all the same that sounds boring to me core square core square
how can you get an interesting design for a quilt if you use the
Dani ? 511578_512381
you could flip it over and over again . 512381_514813
what happens if I flip the core square ? 514813_517934
um then <it will make a different> it will still be the same
okay so I heard Dani say two words flips and turns she said I'll
okay that sounds like what Ashley was talking to me about how she
+^ If I just copied them each time would I get a core square that
no . 556278_556981
maybe . 556981_557581
no . 557581_558861
+< um if if my um if my core square was not symmetrical and I just
yes . 558861_565296
+< no . 565296_566150
well we tried that +. 566150_568066
