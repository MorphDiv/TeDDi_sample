a long time ago on a cold and windy night, a policeman walked
and he saw this man leaning against something .
I forgot what he said .
and they was talking about, was it a barbershop ?
no a restaurant that they used to like to go to .
and xxx he saw another man .
and this man was Jimmy_Wells .
and he passed him something .
I don't remember exactly what .
and he said, well, this is Jimmy_Wells .
and then did he say he was under arrest ?
or something about he was under arrest .
and ask him whether he was going to go quietly .
he said that would make sense .
and then he handed him something to read before they left .
and he started to read .
and as he read he started getting shaky .
that's about all I remember .
this ain't no story .
this is the truth .
I remember a long time ago when we was small .
and on the farm we had cows .
and my father had these cows on the farm .
and <he had sent> he always was sending my sister and my
and they had got to the point where they didn't like going after
so this one particular evening, they went .
and got the cow .
he wasn't a full grown cow .
he was more like a calf like .
and they took .
and they tied his tail to a tree .
and they whipped the cow .
and the cow pulled his tail out by the root .
and my father has this, he made something so he could kind_of keep
and he and after that he made my sister and brother like when the
he would make them take something .
and fan him to keep the flies from biting the calf .
and that's about it .
