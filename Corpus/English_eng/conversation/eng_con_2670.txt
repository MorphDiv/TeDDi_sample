okay now basically this is &-uh a study on &-um I wanted to look at &-um the bilingual population here at the University of Michigan and I started out thinking I would just look at whatever people I could find who were bilingual and then I realized that it would be difficult to kind_of find anything out about it if I was just looking at whatever languages I came up with . 12155_34855
so I ended up concentrating on two different languages and &-um I also concentrated on the easiest samples I could find so I have a Spanish &-um English bilingual sample taken from a class actually of self identifying US Latinos . 35145_50485
so that's something to consider and then I have &-um a sample from a Hindi class &-uh two Hindi classes actually here which are mostly bilingual &-um heritage speakers of Hindi or another Indian language . 51185_66385
&-um and &-uh basically no one other language is highly represented besides Hindi but I'll talk about the &~littl that a little bit in a minute . 67085_77245
&-um the things that I was really looking for were &-uh hadta do with theoretical affiliation with &-um a language community which might serve as a community using these &-uh measures basically . 78015_96175
Helen .
yeah ? 96595_101255
can you put the window down ? 101495_102855

the window down ?
the window down ? 104115_107755
&=noise_disruption see if I can get those &-um +...
&=noise_disruption &=laughs:multiple &-um that helps a little +/. 124025_125885
+, okay &-um okay the first thing I was looking at is theoretical affiliation like do you think that you will be basically affiliated with this language community in this way in the future <that's what> xxx &-um so first I ask I just sort of +//. 126225_141165
these are just theoretical right though they have nothing to do with what we are doing now and I'll talk a little bit about one other thing they ask that's about right now in a minute but these're basically the main things I was looking at . 141345_151765
and I also looked at the importance of maintaining or increasing their proficiency in language A &-um for the &~vari these various reasons . 152465_160985
and what I ended up doing in terms of figuring out what these meant and how they correlated was looking at +//. 161945_167945
&-um basically what I did for these scores or these answers is I gave them two points if they said yes one point if they say maybe and zero points if they say no so I have an aggregate score for that . 167825_181365
and I have &-um an average score for this one . 182005_184785
&-um depending on various things and I also I'll show you a little bit about how those broke down &-um +... 185705_191745
there's a_lot_of different things you can consider in terms of what will influence you know how someone perceives their own identity and how important it is for them to maintain their other language . 194275_204275
&-um basically with students at the U_Of_M we're looking at people who &-um are basically &~social socially mobile so &-um I sort_of went in assuming that I would find people who would be more tending to be agents of language shift rather than language retention &-um in the sense that they most of the students &-um like <in the> in the Spanish bilingual Spanish English bilingual sample three out_of eleven had grown up in a Latino neighborhood or I +//. 204985_234965
whatever I I measured that just by saying you know do you &~h did you have neighbors who were spoke Spanish did you have &-um classmates who spoke Spanish ? 237925_246585
and only three of them answered yes to either of those . 246765_248705
so basically most of them did not grow up in a bilingual community except for that of their parents . 249465_254445
and I've done qualitative interviews . 255025_256645
I haven't finished evaluating all of that yet . 256825_259045
but basically for the qualitative work it seems like most of the students did indeed grow up in &-um an integrated community . 259105_267625
and they often say well I spoke Spanish or Hindi with my parents friends or their &~childre their &~par my parent's friends' children . 268685_275285
but I didn't you know have friends at school who spoke it or whatever . 276185_279705
&-um another thing to consider of_course is the different language groups &-um Hindi obviously &-uh is not as widespread in the United States as Spanish is &-um so in terms of usefulness or accessibility in the United States it's a little different . 281125_298965
so I'm just gonna look at some differences between the two groups for a moment here . 300065_303505
&-um this is the answer to &~th the second question which is about the importance of &-um &~th these various reasons for maintaining or increasing fluency in language A alright . 304705_316885
&-um and I've got this little graph at the bottom which basically tells you that &~i I've sort_of labeled this so &-um basically for the Hindi class seventy five percent answered +//. 317565_329805
had an average of this or higher the seventy fifth percentile . 330275_334475
half of them had this or higher twenty five percent so you can see that the Hindi class has a much &-um lower range basically of answers okay . 334675_344355
and you can basically see that that's from these two numbers here . 344995_348855
I circled them here . 349515_350155
&-um okay &-um so for professional and academic reasons Hindis were rated not that much &~more much lower than the Hindi &~speakers than the Spanish speakers . 351095_362635
&-um and that was pretty much across the board and we can think of some obviously &-um reasons for that &-uh +... 363595_371235
another interesting thing you can see there's some variability . 373815_377735
&-um I don't think that the rest of it's very significant though &-um the variability in the different ranges &-um there is some variability though there is still like +//. 378035_386495
this is relatively low compared to the other scores for Spanish speakers to the academics . 386955_391835
but it's still relatively high . 392355_393755
this was &~just a rating of four just means important . 394695_396815
anyway so and then just to look at the other thing I was interested in measuring this is the questions on theoretical affiliation . 397995_407975
and I broke these down into proportions so this is like basically like thirty six percent xxx fifty five percent . 409815_415675
&-um so for &~this for <the Spanish> &-um the Spanish English bilingual sample or the Spanish class I should just say &-um basically there's a_lot more &-um higher ratings <in the> in the yes category like a_lot more people who said yes to &-um to everything and there's also very few people who said no to anything . 416325_441065
you'll see here most people said at least maybe you know or yes . 441465_445405
&-um and that again might have something to do with the also the sample is taken from a US Latino +//. 446165_449965
self-identifying US Latino class and so students who are in this class presumably are already relatively invested in being a US Latino in the sense that they self-identify . 450385_471445
&-um but at the same time &-um the Hindi speakers &-um no one said no for example no they would not marry a Hindi speaker . 461385_469745
but &-um you know two people I believe that represents two people who said they would never marry someone who was a Spanish English bilingual . 470605_477185
basically . 477645_478025
okay . 478445_478625
&-um and you can see again there's a higher distribution for the Spanish speakers than the Hindi speakers for the aggregate score like all these together . 479525_487285
&-um let's see . 488345_489745
and the other interesting things &~th only one person I think said yes they would live in a country where Hindi was spoken basically India right ? 489905_496645
&-um whereas &-um several people said yes they would <live in> live in a Spanish speaking country definitely . 497285_505265
and &-um let's see the other interesting thing is that hardly anybody said that they would not raise their children bilingually okay . 505925_514405
in any of the samples there's two people total in both samples that said that they would would not raise their children bilingually . 514645_520865
or maybe actually they didn't say would not they said maybe I won't . 521425_524265
you know &=laughs and one of them like even wrote a comment in like I'm not sure if I'm proficient enough to bring my children up bilingually . 524465_530865
&=laughs like I want to but . 531485_532825
so basically you can see by just looking at that that basically for all of the students sampled they are all pretty invested in thinking that bilingualism is a good thing you know . 533805_544945
over all something they want to pass on to their children in the interviews that comes out as well +... 545305_549745
&-um so I was interested also in how these correlate . 552445_556505
I was &~sayi thinking you know &~m well maybe some people are interested in being part of this community the bilingual community . 556655_562075
but they're not really interested in &-um having &-uh high their own high proficiency <in the> language so there is a high &-um there is a high correlation between these two things . 562655_574455
so this is the average this is the average score of like the five point rating thing . 574735_579615
and this is the aggregate score of like yes maybe no . 579855_582515
do you want to do this ? 582995_583815
do you want to do that ?
&-um and there's like a high correlation . 585155_587095
I think it's point seven two . 587755_589315
sorry could you just be clearer on what's correlated with what . 589755_592115
yeah .
okay &-um this is the average interest so this is like &-um rate the following &-um how important is it for you to maintain or increase language A and you can just put this up &-uh rate that on a scale of one through five basically for the following reasons . 592255_611835
xxx right there that's the bottom one . 614885_618165
<aggregate interest> and then I just averaged their scores okay . 618565_621885
and that's the scale . 622465_623345
this is the aggregate score . 623745_625005
so they get two points for every yes and one point for every maybe so somebody who has twelve answered yes to everything okay . 625325_632785
somebody who has a three probably only answered yes to one thing maybe to another representative of that so . 633385_641625
and there's you know there's definitely variability . 642415_644435
you know there's people who it's really important to them to to maintain language A and yet they have a pretty low theoretical affiliation . 645075_652755
but there is a correlation of &-um &-uh this is &~th &~this these are the questions xxx &-um +... 652995_659595
I was interested in the marrying someone who speaks language A thing for the Hindi speakers and I actually ended up asking some people in the qualitative interview whether they were interested in arranged marriages and I only had one person say <they were> &~intr they were considering it still so but &-um since that's a big thing for recent immigrants of_course especially +... 666765_687205
&-um okay +... 688865_691765
now another thing that &-um I realized when I started looking at this is I asked a question . 694195_699255
are you involved in any religious organizations student organizations classes whatever in &~in &~th where people speak language A and &-um just correlating with the religion thing . 699835_710795
got actually a really pretty high correlation so this is just like yes or no &~d do you participate in a religious organization xxx people xxx okay . 711295_719855
&-um and you see this is the average of the five so this is the you know how important it is for you maintain the language . 721025_727625
and you can see that &-um this is these are both for the Spanish sample . 728185_732245
so for the Spanish sample I mean these are pretty low numbers so it's kind_of weird to see it in this form but this just basically means that we are xxx black line notes fifty percent whatever answered higher than that . 732585_742685
so you can see that everybody who's yes involved in their religious organization they did all fives for all of the treatments so &-um and here again you see that like &~ha half of all this like two of these students are all gave almost all yeses@n basically for all those added questions . 743015_762595
&-um this +//. 763475_763935
it's kind_of weird to see this and these low numbers I tried to this like that . 764375_767395
have you got a misprint there ?
is one of them empty ? 767515_769115
no these are all Spanish classes these are for religion or yes or no . 769815_773795
aah ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ and &~th the in ⌋ and this is oh this is the aggregate score for like +/. 774715_778175
I see +/. 778855_778975
+, do you imagine yourself &~imagine marrying somebody who speaks language A . 778975_799675
so this is just for the Spanish one and they say a a little different &-uh distribution with the Hindi class but with similar overall results except for the &-um this is reversed so let me just do it one at a time . 782855_800555
this is the aggregate score so you see again there's a higher like median &-um this is like for yes no maybe do you wanna marry somebody <you wanna> do &~you do you think you'll marry someone who speaks language A or whatever . 800805_814745
&-um that's definitely still higher for people who are involved in religious organizations now but it's a little more spread out <and I> xxx &~the the Spanish sample seemed pretty +//. 815445_825845
more polarized . 826145_826865
there's also fewer people in the Spanish sample who are involved in a religion here there's the opposite there's nine &-uh students involved in a religion and four are not so but then these this is kind_of bizarre I don't know what to make of this but I'll just show it to you . 826905_842545
&-um this is for the &-uh this is for the average grading of reasons and there's this huge spread for the people who said yes and then there's this really small spread of people who said no and so &~that's maybe this says that maybe religion doesn't correlate with &-um the importance of speaking Hindi as much for these students . 842845_864425
okay &-um &~that's I mean it's a small sample so it's hard to make these kind of conclusions but it does seem like it could be different than the Spanish sample where there was a high correlation in both cases with being involved in religion . 864735_881995
okay +... 883235_884315
so &-um basically what I came up with I guess is that there is &-um that language is really important to these students in terms of their affiliation with this community bilingual community or their cultural community maybe in a a larger sense to say that . 889555_905835
because the other thing about this is they are taking this class and language which means that they are investing time and energy in learning this language but it also means that they don't +//. 906135_916235
they're not already super proficient in this language right so they're not like &-um the ideal bilingual and we all know that that doesn't happen very often but but they you know they're not like &-um going from being already you know totally maybe a part of this community and then taking this class of_course (be)cause they're wanting to improve it &-um especially for the Spanish speakers . 916325_942005
I would say that I guess just because when you talk about Hindi speakers I just imagine it being more I mean if you're not even learning those &~char that character set in school you know &-um and a_lot_of the +//. 942045_953585
from the qualitative interviews &-um a_lot_of what I got was that people &-um rejected their their home language as a child they'd often say +"/. 953845_962805
+" oh I you know I told my parents to stop speaking Spanish to me you know all this stuff when they were a kid &-um and but now I want to . 963085_969505
you know so there's this kind of change in heart sort of coming with age and &-um the other thing is that it's interesting to see why it is that students want to revive their other language in a sense okay . 969625_983465
and basically what I &~n &-uh what I decided is that they are basically interested in it because of &-um they want to use it as a way to be part of this &-um cultural identity . 984185_997025
these are <the same> quotes as I had before so people who've seen this already it's boring but &-um basically these are two interviews &-um where basically students said right out +"/. 997405_1007665
+" the reason I want to speak Spanish is because I &-um <I want> I want to be considered Latino and I feel like this is like validates me in some way . 1007825_1016565
basically what they're saying so they he says because I don't look like a Latino person since I'm not brown &-uh let's see are they &~wha are your kids gonna be you know Hispanic and so I wanna know you know I wanna speak Spanish basically . 1016525_1031305
+, is kinda what it's coming down to . 1031885_1033305
and this student has the same basic idea . 1033505_1036285
she says &-um it's part of myself . 1036485_1038785
I really wanted to get back <that back> that back you know . 1038965_1041065
and then she says basically I look african american . 1041225_1044065
and most of my friends have been Afro_American so I really haven't had that much in you know so she's basically getting this idea that she wants to &-um be part of a Latino community in some way that she hasn't been so far . 1044825_1058565
and she feels like Spanish is gonna &~come some how help her &-um her overall identity with that . 1058785_1065425
so that's kind_of what's going on with the qualitative data I haven't finished analyzing the rest of my qualitative data so that's all of that for now . 1065905_1073325
&-um I'm trying to think how am I doing on time ? 1073765_1077465
okay we didn't really talk about timing how how much more have you got ? 1077945_1081385
how much more have I got ? 1081765_1083105
I that's that's most of it I could say a couple more things but . 1083225_1086545
well .
okay . 1086785_1088305
do you want to briefly a_couple_of minutes perhaps +/. 1088485_1091025
okay +/. 1091425_1091685
+, and I think we have twenty minutes for questions . 1092645_1092985
get my .
I think we made it twenty minutes a piece didn't we ? 1095525_1097885
yeah I think and then time for questions and then there's &-uh +... 1098485_1102805
<I don't> <have this> it's in my bag +... 1103585_1104505
&-um the one other interesting thing is and I already talked about this in my other presentation but &-um there was this distribution lemme just find that &=looks_in_bag there was this distribution in terms of who asked people who they spoke Spanish or English with or who they spoke xxx language A who do you speak language A with and &-um +... 1106425_1126465
there was this thing that is typical of the bilingual population <at first> but it's interesting to see it &-um where you get the speaking both with their parents fourteen out_of this is for both language groups . 1128575_1142035
fourteen out_of &-uh I guess twenty four total spoke speak both with their parents okay six speak only language A with their parents &-um but with siblings you see a much higher rate of speaking only English okay so a_lot_of students told me this in interviews too they said I only speak English <with my> with my brother or whatever &-um some speak both very few speak only language A . 1142805_1165685
only one person only speaks language A with his friends . 1166225_1168745
&-uh I think that was a he &-um &-uh and eight only speak English which is &-um less in fact than people who only speak English with their &-um &=laughs:S1 with their siblings . 1170935_1181415
but the thing about the friends thing I should just say that &~this this whole friends line is kind_of strange because this &-um fifteen this the lines here this fifteen's kind_of like we really don't know what that is . 1181655_1193615
it could be like I have one friend who speaks English and everyone else speaks language A or it could be like I have fifteen friends who speak English and one friend who speaks language A so that's that . 1194015_1203375
doesn't really tell us much . 1203515_1204195
but there are eight people who only have friends basically who speak English so that's that's a pretty large number . 1204335_1210555
who are just not involved basically in a language A community at this point . 1211615_1216055
in terms of their own peers &-um so . 1216675_1218535
&-um okay my transparencies +... 1220375_1223995
&=flipping_through_transparencies:S1 okay . 1230685_1230905
so basically my conclusions were that students who are more involved in a bilingual community or who see themselves becoming more involved in it in the future with these kind of imaginary questions are are also more concerned with maintaining language A be that Hindi or Spanish or Gujarati . 1230905_1249185
or there's &-um I guess probably no one in here does Indian languages . 1249425_1253965
but I can mention that the different languages I was asked this before so the different languages that they spoke besides Hindi were Marathi Urdu two Gujarati and one Oriya . 1254135_1263575
so there's kind_of a wide range of other languages and Arabic one other spoke Arabic . 1263975_1268595
&-um okay so basically there is this high correlation between seeing themselves being involved in this community and wanting to maintain language A . 1269355_1279555
so that sort of says to me there's the language is an important part of their cultural identity and often students when I asked them that I said what is +//. 1280335_1287555
what &~d does your culture mean to you &-um outside of the language you know they would kind_of say well there's food and you know there's you know the religious customs they would often say but beyond that that was kind_of it &-um there were some other interesting things that came up . 1288255_1304115
&-um but in language A the the the language seemed to play a more important part in it . 1305435_1309895
&-um let's see and let's see (0.7) and I'm sort_of wondering and I don't know if I'll be able to answer that in this but I'm I'm sort_of wondering what in what way the students hope to retain language A if they're not gonna be involved in the community and then you get into this more symbolic orientation towards this community . 1310995_1336775
where it's like I want to be whatever &~an an Indian American but &-um maybe I'm just tend to spend more time with you know English speaking Americans or whatever so that's an interesting question I don't know if I'll get around to that but it's just a thought for the future . 1337095_1354535
okay so . 1355455_1356995
thank you . 1357895_1358595
⌈ question ⌉ .
⌊ any questions ⌋ ? 1359035_1359515
yeah . 1359735_1359875
xxx question ⌈ &-um ⌉ +/.
⌊ okay ⌋ +/. 1360195_1360855
+, actually I have a question . 1361675_1363795
I have two little questions . 1364205_1365205
one &-um I know we've talked about going through the process of making a questionnaire how you go through drafts and a pilot and that sort of thing . 1365985_1373325
and I was thinking maybe if I don't know if you're going to do this again or if you're gonna rework the questionnaire at all . 1373785_1379465

&-um when I asked about Hindi I got kind of different answers you know . 1593235_1595995
some people would say oh no you don't even need Hindi in in India . 1596115_1599135

so I think there was only one actual like on a visa person in the entire &-um group that I got from these two classes . 1706395_1713515

and that's kinda one of the weird things about doing a questionnaire like this you know but it's sort_of for the feeling (be)cause I put no English &-uh I thought maybe that would clarify like that means they do not speak language A at all okay ? 1853165_1866785
so that means that it's somebody who's not bilingual so I sort_of hoped that that would clear that up but xxx I mean I also don't know what people think about what do I mean by personal you know I mean ? 1867585_1879865

concentrated on bilingualism and other language contact phenomena . 2258595_2262675
&-um how should I start this &-um (0.5) let me just give you a little bit as to why I'm interested in this &-um first thing &-um let's see I &-um did a_lot_of the course work at UCLA on &-uh American Indian studies . 2264265_2284425
so that's kind_of one is my my specialties &-um North American Indian studies . 2284805_2289425
and &-um I also +//. 2290165_2291505
my dissertation interest is in the Andean &-um Andean studies and &-um one of the things I wanted to find out was &-um what happens in borderland situations in terms of language and culture . 2291935_2305455
and I felt that &-um I really had not done a_lot_of research in this particular area . 2306735_2312075
I was thinking about doing my &~r my my my &-um presentation on on Andean bilingualism but I said I have a_lot_of time to do <that if I want> so &-um what I'm concentrating on is &-um &-uh the Pueblo &-um cultures of the Southwest . 2312675_2327615
and I'm including the Navajos &-um separately because actually they're not from from the Southwest they actually came from the north . 2328115_2336415
&-um and they've been around for like &-um +... 2337335_2340235
thousands of years some people say &-um and it's extremely controversial &-uh in terms of that but &~they they're they know themselves xxx and others know them as not being from there . 2342525_2351565
in terms of the Pueblos <they've been> they've been there in terms of their archeological records since &-um I would say fifteen hundred years . 2352165_2359045
and &-um they've been in in and they and in terms of the &~contemp contemporary &~geogr geographic locations of these people you would have to look at &-um Arizona New Mexico Utah &-um I would say what else is the Southwest ? 2360065_2378205
Colorado ?
+, I'm sorry ? 2378825_2379585
Colorado ? 2379925_2380305
Colorado . 2380845_2381365
yes but mainly &-uh Arizona and New Mexico . 2381885_2384365
and &-um +... 2385365_2386705
these people have been in contact actually &-um with the Spaniards since the sixteenth century . 2388365_2395985
and that happened because of Hernando DeSoto's &-um conquest of Florida &-um going you know &-um under &~th under the &-um supervision and tutelage of &-uh the the Spanish &=audio_disturbance xxx &-um after that you have &-um when Mexico is reestablished as a colony of Spain you have a_lot_of conquistadores going up north . 2397255_2422555
so &~they that's when you actually have the first contacts of &-um Spanish speakers with &-um with Native American speakers . 2423175_2432515
let's see +... 2433195_2434955
and you have the situation where these conquistadores actually &-um get a_lot_of slaves from these +//. 2438315_2444495
from &~the from these communities and they actually teach these people Spanish so they can serve as interpreters . 2444975_2450295
so you have a whole line of families involved in this and from this &-um &~y &-um you have the spread of &-um of translators and also you have the spread of missionaries because along the with the conquistadores came the missionaries . 2450925_2466405
so the medium as is in the case of the Americas the medium for &-um proselytization is &-um Spanish . 2467185_2476045
in terms of &-um the &~s the &-um the Jesuits and other &-um Spanish &-uh missionary people +... 2477205_2482185
<you have> &-um you have the English speakers coming in in this century which is really interesting . 2483325_2492865
you have them coming in for mainly commerce with the Pueblos and also for expropriation of their lands so you have <a whole> a whole historical struggle <of &-um> of &-um Pueblo peoples and Navajos being transplanted from &~dif different parts of the Southwest kind of being transplanted from one neighborhood to the other . 2493465_2518105
and this happens . 2518745_2519465
and by neighborhood I don't mean like you know small localities but actually wide regions . 2520065_2525185
&-um this happens actually &-um throughout this century &-um even now in the Seventies you still have conflicts over land . 2526185_2534325
between &-um the Spanish speakers &-um the mainstream &-um political authorities Congress and &-um Pueblos and Navajos . 2535085_2543805
&-um you also have a situation where because of all this linguistic and cultural contact &-um you have a_lot_of loss in terms of both peoples and languages . 2545255_2558175
and the three major languages of this area are &-um Navajo Pima_Papago and Apache . 2558995_2565975
which I was surprised because I wasn't +//. 2566415_2567855
I &~wa I I didn't think that Apache was &-uh actually the &~d the dominant language because I felt that +//. 2568035_2573915
I thought from the history that I know that Apache speakers were actually decimated . 2574255_2578235
in &-um in the late eighteen hundreds . 2579355_2581315
where you still have &-um &~mu monolinguals@n and bilinguals especially . 2581835_2586035
&-um for instance you have the USA Bureau of Indian Affairs citing &-um &-um &~a an approximate number of speakers for each of these &-um languages you have about a hundred thirty thousand Navajo speakers you have fifteen hundred Pima_Papago speakers and you have nine thousand Apache speakers . 2586875_2609695
they really don't delineate exactly who these speakers are you know in terms of the bilingual continuum . 2609995_2616475
but &-um I guess &~y you can imagine that a_lot_of them are bilinguals . 2617655_2621475
&-um within the Navajo nation which is a nation which is a which is amazing nation I think it actually covers four states that's why it's called the four corners . 2621935_2631275
right ? 2632435_2632455
&~s and and that happened as a result of all this &~trans transplantation . 2632815_2637135
as a resort +//. 2637715_2637875
as <as a> as a result of them moving as soon as you have &-um Anglo speakers and also other Native American communities you have Navajos being transplanted both forcibly and also in terms of you know in terms of their own desire xxx wanting that those &-um dislocations . 2638355_2659735
and <and when it> and when it come to dealing with Native American languages and Native American speakers in the Southwest one also hasta deal with Chicanos because both of them Native Americans Chicanos are actually what you consider territorial minorities . 2664075_2677775
they're actually people who if you have to say who were there first . 2678415_2681175
and within those two communities there's a_lot_of controversy as to who was there first . 2682595_2686075
but we don't want to get into that . 2686455_2687275
we just need to know that &-um let me see (0.6) you have another situation going on is interesting . 2688065_2700865
you have the situation of the &~Southwe &~e &-uh Southwest and Mexico . 2701325_2705305
&-um several researchers &-uh researchers including Jane Hill have &-uh conducted studies in loan words . 2706385_2713545
and they've found &~e that &-um <you have> you have a considerable degree of &-um borrowing &-um in some Native American languages &-um they've found Nahuatl borrowings . 2714585_2728125
which come from as early as you know I would say even before the conquest . 2728985_2735125
and you still have those remnants which is really interesting &-um +... 2736285_2740005
what's interesting about the Southwest too in terms of the populations there is that you &~don you don't only have bilingualism you also have trilingualism which becomes much more complex in terms of studying &-um those linguistic &-um repertoires . 2744415_2760695
&-um you have situations where &-um usually in terms there's certain typologies of language contact in native North America but &~n in focusing &~s the southwest you have speakers who speakers who are &-um beyond thirty usually are bilingual . 2761335_2780835
in both &~n &~n bilingual trilingual &-um in their Native American language &-um Spanish and English and you have speakers who are younger of_course usually are much more English dominant . 2782495_2792755
and in this situation you have a situation of &-um &-um this phenomenon called Indian English . 2793795_2800255
<which is> &-uh which is very it's been categorized very similarly to Black English or Puerto Rican English where you have &-um certain &-um phonological &-um intonational &~s semantic &-um similarities <from the> from the native language . 2801485_2822385
&-um you have this this scholar by the name of William Leap . 2823965_2827705
who's actually spent +//. 2828125_2829205
he's actually &-um devoted his his life to &-um this type of &-um of study and he usually has done it &-um he usually has looked at &-um +... 2829305_2841085
Navajos ⌈ Navajos ⌉ . 2841445_2842905
⌊ this is ⌋ specifically &-uh Navajo English +/. 2843005_2845165
⌈ no ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ he's interested in ⌋ or is it the whole &-uh repertoire . 2845465_2847565
the whole repertoire what's interesting about it he he he that's a really good point <he does> he does &~adm &-um he does state that as there are different types of Englishes you also have different types of Indian English so you have Navajo Indian English you have Hopi Indian English you have Cherokee Indian English . 2847905_2865985
so one hasta also get to know the native language in_order_to figure what are the similarities and whether they diverge . 2866785_2872825
so I I would say the same thing with Spanish . 2873805_2876105
you have Puerto Rican English and you probably have Colombian English . 2876545_2879525
although &-uh depending <on the> on the contact situation you could have you could have dialect leveling in that sense too . 2881105_2887865
&-um the history about this Indian English is interesting because by the turn of the century and this was like a widespread &-um &-um policy for Native Americans by the turn of the century you have you had &~in &-um Indian children being forced out_of their homes into boarding schools . 2888685_2908805
so you actually have &-um kids coming from different &~s &-uh reservations different places around native America who actually had a hadta deal with each_other and &-um and understand each_other so English became like a lingua_franca . 2909925_2926125
so within that you have that situation going on you also have in the nineteen fifties the termination policy which actually &-um expelled a_lot_of the native peoples into the cities . 2927745_2939145
and that was another governmental policy where you have people also coming from different &-um linguistic backgrounds different languages &-um coming together and using English as a &~lang lingua_franca . 2939365_2951605
but then you have the situation where people become dominant and people actually just using this Indian English . 2952785_2960585
so &-um there's been some research there's research on that but still it's ongoing +/. 2960965_2964765
mhm +/.
+, because it's still you still have so many different languages you still the typology's still not there but &-uh it's it's a a field that is very very &-um popular right now . 2965385_2975465
(0.6) and what's interesting about it &~i in the situation is that <this &~i this I didn't> find in the literature if one has Indian English you want &~s <you want suppose they have Indian Spanish> but that is not that really has not been seen in the literature I mean I think it's to do you have a question yes . 2981825_2998945
do you get cases where there're Native Americans who speak Spanish but not English ? 2999145_3004125
yes you do you actually have the older &~f &-uh the older people <in certain> &~par in certain parts of the Southwest . 3004785_3010785
there're some older &-uh generation Navajos that that are actually bilingual only in Navajo and Spanish . 3011465_3020705
xxx depending on the closeness of the interaction with other Spanish speakers especially Mexican speakers you have the much more Spanish dominant . 3022365_3031185
but within that you know you can still talk about Indian Spanish just the same way you can talk about you know the Spanish that Indian Spanish that's influenced by Quechua or you know other languages Native American languages . 3032265_3044385
so that's that's interesting I guess it's because we are in an English dominant society academic world so I'm sure other &~p I'm sure people are studying that too . 3044945_3053505
let's see what else I can tell you guys . 3054445_3059845
there's there's been one interesting study and it's it's finally we probably will be very appreciative of it . 3060355_3067475
hasta do with &-um with &-uh Susan Phillip's study in nineteen seventy two of this &-um &~war Warm Springs &-um Indian &-um classroom where she actually &-um studies the &~interactio the interactional dynamics of &-um Indian children . 3067895_3085395
and how <they use> they use silence how they use how they use &-uh the notion of &-uh of group solidarity to actually both both &-um create a solidarity and also separate themselves from others . 3086465_3102525
so you have you that and I believe that she &-um used a little bit of the xxx approach but not the way that we've been doing it much more xxx and this is kind_of like a a a very &-um good field to get into because &-um <one of the> one of the biggest biggest urgencies in terms of this research is educational educational &-um &-um stuff . 3103385_3126725
&-um we have in terms of Indian English you have the same old thing about the literature by &~semil &~semiling lingual speakers the same things is &~appro is is attributed to &-um Indian English speakers . 3127185_3139705
&-um and you also have the whole situation not just linguistic and this is interesting too it's like not just &~y you the the &-um the person specially the academic child is not just a a linguistic person in terms of &-um speaking . 3140265_3157105
actor . 3158185_3158265
but also you have the the situation of gestures . 3158845_3162305
how gestures are read . 3162965_3164445
are read by the people in authority and how gestures can vary crossculturally . 3165285_3170045
well this is real ethnography of speaking +/. 3170625_3172445

okay this is one thing I would like to end with which I thought was xxx really interesting there's this article by <Michael Silverstein> . 3365755_3372035
&-um and let me tell you a little bit of this article if I can find it here . 3372855_3379095
okay this article is in &-um Journal of Linguistic Anthropology and he has an article Encountering Language and Language <of Encounter> in North American ethnohistory . 3380765_3389245
and one of the things he does says is that if you're gonna look at a language contact phenomenon in native North America or the Americas when dealing with &~n with &-uh Indian languages &-um one really hasta look at the histories because there's so much history of transplantation of removal . 3390985_3409165
so the people who you at this point think are the native speakers of that region might not be at all . 3409905_3417445
and this could just be fifty years you know down the line doesn't hafta be like hundreds of years down the line . 3417825_3424445
and that's one of the things I think when you know that's one thing at times that we might forget to do to actually do our research and not that our research will will necessarily &-um &-um give us a one to one correspondence in terms of how language is being either &~bor borrowed or not borrowed or &-uh code switched but it will definitely make our +//. 3425105_3448705

okay mhm this is an important article so take advantage of her superior knowledge xxx in your syntax class . 3500445_3507385
&=laughs well I tried to to concentrate maybe more in the parts that we'd been doing in class and less in the syntax +/. 3507805_3514165
mhm +/.
+, but let's see if we we +//. 3515065_3517365
we can make it together . 3518425_3519245
okay first thing to start with is talking about the terminology because when we talk about bilingual first language acquisition &-uh Koeppe and Meisel these authors that are by the way German working at the University of Hamburg they refer to children as opposed to an acquiring two or more languages simultaneously before age three and this is very important because we've seen the differences before . 3520275_3547175
so there's simultaneously both languages at the same time before the age three . 3548265_3552625
and these children could have lived in one or the other country by &~th until the &~a age three comes . 3553205_3558825
&-um what they talk about is bilingual code switching which is governed by grammatical and pragmatic constraints which means that code switchers are required to have pragmatic <and grammatic> and grammatic competence grammatical competence in both languages . 3560365_3576565
&-um but what happens with infants is that sometimes bilingual children use both languages in the same utterance or a conversation and they violate syntactic or grammatic constraints of code switching this is what they call code mixing . 3579025_3593165
and it can be accounted for by the failure in separating the two linguistic systems that's what is called fusion due either to the lack of &~lang of knowledge of syntactic and &~pras pragmatic constraints or also could be to the lack of the necessary elements to which the constraints applies or maybe both . 3594625_3616805
so there's one thing they're gonna have a look into . 3617645_3620085
&-um important point is to determine from what age children organize language by grammatical means . 3621305_3629425
and also &-um the distinction between different categories of words and having these two elements &-um counting for their study helps them to distinguish <code mixing> code mixing from code switching in early child language . 3630345_3647325
so it depends really on from what age onward children organize language and when are they really using their syntactic knowledge or not so that's that's really important for this distinction between code switching and code mixing . 3647505_3661725
and what Koeppe and Meisel do is &-um comprehensive literature review about code switching acquisition and they they say that these studies are mainly referred to longitudinal studies on bilingual language acquisition which typically concern a linguistic environment where each person speaks one language . 3663535_3684075
so in all these situations so one parent one language or child +//. 3684955_3689995
children speaking one language in the home and then one language outside of the home they said that most studies they referred to this . 3690335_3698295
which is true I've seen that here in class . 3698955_3700735
&-um they divide their their studies in two &-um main tracks like we've seen before one is the pragmatic functions of code switching and the other one is the syntactic aspects of language mixing . 3701715_3716215
and starting with the pragmatic functions we've seen two two types in class do you remember which one they were ? 3717755_3726115
do you +//. 3726555_3726735
can you just more or less a rough idea &~wha which two aspects big aspects talking about the pragmatic functions of code switching that we've seen in class ? 3727595_3736955

⌊ xxx analysis ⌋ .
okay well really this +//. 3766675_3769635
about situational switching language choice is the ability to select the appropriate language as base language for the conversation according to the interlocutor which is &-uh oh the topic of the conversation or the situational context . 3769785_3786765
and from around age of two the child switches &~ad adequately languages according to the interlocutor . 3788245_3794625
most children raised bilingual in a monolingual environment could experience &=audio_disturbance that's why it calls their attention of Koeppe and Meisel . 3796075_3804695
that means this language factor that means that the fact that most people talk in these children &-um most people who talk to them only understand one of the languages &-um these children start to develop a a certain awareness like I'm talking to this person and this person doesn't understand me so it means they talk something else but I understand them maybe I talk two things . 3804515_3827795
I mean this is like the way &~ch children could think . 3827795_3831035
and this to that they become more aware that there's a language separation that there's two languages going on . 3831945_3837685
this factor interlocutor becomes complex especially with bilingual interlocutors because children need to decide which language they're going to speak with this person and which language do they prefer or they +//. 3838545_3850845
if they prefer to use both codes at the same time . 3851145_3853225

the +//. 3861495_3861615
apart from situational switching we have also conversational switching . 3863655_3867715
which is the other main &-um type of of switching and in case of bilingual hearers only code switching may be used to convey specific social or pragmatic information such as metalinguistic awareness . 3868455_3884255
metalinguistic +//.
sorry excuse_me metalinguistic comments that reflect their awareness . 3885825_3889785
this is called like I said conversational switching in contrast to language choice as situational switching . 3890845_3897625
do you remember all those cases in which in the middle of a conversation people will switch from one language to the other we've seen it <a_lot_of them> ? 3899005_3906865

well what is being reported is that from age two onwards children begin to repeat their own utterances in both languages in_order_to call for instance the parents' attention or to ensure that they're being understood . 3930365_3942365
from the age three onwards they start to comment on their own language and to ask for translations and this is really a sign of separation of languages . 3944405_3951505

&-um with respect to the syntactic aspects of language &~mi mixing &-uh Koeppe and Meisel they gathered the the literature about the studies that they they're concerned with language mixing and language separation the problem is most of the studies find out that the mixings are very low we've seen this in class as well . 3968545_3991785
this is &~m mainly repetition of many things that we've seen so far it's a bit of &-um &~sum summarizing . 3992605_3999525
what is necessary is to relate mixing rates to polititive aspects of language for instance which categories are mixed the structure of condition for switching how developed is the child is the child's grammatical competence etcetera . 4000765_4013745
and also to pragmatic functional considerations are these mixes conscious ? 4014645_4019165

is the addressee bilingual +..? 4022475_4023555
the distinction between different categories of word mix helps to distinguish code mixing from code switching in early child language so we need to distinguish which categories have been mixed to start with and empirical studies have shown that in early stages children mix function words what are function words ? 4025675_4045115

which means they're they're more like function words &~tha words the words that have a function but not really a content xxx they're not in the dictionary . 4058935_4067175

and the percentages that we're gonna talk about later . 4089425_4091725
okay &-um was an author called Wieman who talk about these function words being mixed in early &-um stages of of children bilingualism . 4094805_4107645
the problem is this is very &-um problematic for the terminology and also because there are many contradictory studies about this so people keep &-um finding contradictions . 4108265_4121745
and Koeppe and Meisel said this is what has been found so far . 4122305_4126105
but <they found> they found pretty much the same tendency . 4126345_4131205
but some studies like for instance Lanza's study Elizabeth Lanza who was &-um published the last review in ninety seven she found contradictory findings about this . 4132245_4145025
it's not exactly &-um that children start with function words . 4145425_4149205
but that's a tendency . 4149405_4150045
so far it's been observed . 4150545_4153025
and later on nouns are predominant . 4154365_4157005
it's been found that seventy five percent of the switch words are nouns in both adults and children . 4157405_4163165
now this coincides as well with borrowings most borrowings are also nouns . 4163685_4180405
did we ever discuss why nouns seem so you know there are &~id people have ideas about why nouns &-uh are so liable to be shifted about okay ? 4169325_4178725
Mary you're nodding do you know why ? 4179065_4180305
&-um one of the things I read was that there were more nouns +/. 4180765_4184965

+, mhm +/.
+, yeah +/.
+, if you take a verb like &-um eat eat need not take an object . 4207315_4212375
but if you take a verb like devour you can't say John devoured . 4212575_4215775
you've gotta say John devoured something . 4215915_4217235
and so if you transfer that item to another language you have to know &-uh this . 4218335_4225995
&~a you hafta have this abstract knowledge about how to use it . 4223055_4226895
and that's &-uh that's it's well I call it subcategorization . 4227315_4230955
you might have another way of putting it . 4231195_4232435
subcategorization &=laughs +/.
okay +/.
+, exactly .
but you see nouns don't do this nouns are relatively easy to move about they just don't drag the syntactic complexity it's to do with the verb being the head of the sentence effectively really isn't it ? 4234575_4243975
mhm +/.

apparently yes . 4252255_4253535

maybe something about Chinese also . 4277235_4278875
yeah well it's just that we we know very well that people don't like violating syntactic rules of languages whether you mix and it's quite easy not to do this with &~ba with nouns but if you &~m move verbs about and some other things like prepositions +/. 4279715_4295075

mhm it's true . 4296875_4298615
&-um that's I'm gonna retake up the idea in a minute &-um generative grammar tried to explain formal regularities in code switching by means of universal principles . 4299445_4310585
that's really Chomskyan studies try to find universal principles under linguistics under every language although there are &~contradicti contradictory findings it is agreed that mixing seems not to occur between constituents that are contained in the INFL phrase . 4311205_4327685
&-um I don't know if you know what the INFL phrase is . 4328345_4332365
inflection ? 4332605_4333085
&-um it's for instance &-um well in a verb we have inflections &~m the ending of the verbs in Spanish for instance the verb hablo@s:fra &=writes:board I speak we have &-um this O tells us that it's first person singular &-um and tells us as well that's it's a present tense that's inflection in the verb . 4334305_4360585
so &~y &~wou wouldn't find things of the type &=writes:board I don't hablo@s:fra you wouldn't find these kind of mixings because in the INFL &~f phrase and also like things like no@s:fra quiero@s:fra &=writes:board to talk we wouldn't find this at all as well &-um because it's between &-um for instance &~nega &-uh yeah a &{l=SIC finis@u &}l=SIC a nonfinite verb you wouldn't find this +/. 4361225_4391205

&-um &=referencing_handout the study that Koeppe and Meisel carried out is called a DUFDE@s:fra study I guess DUFDE@s:fra because it's German &=laughs &-um &~le it's a longitudinal study of simultaneous acquisition of German and French by thirteen preschool children . 4555625_4572145
they &~ve videotaped the children every two weeks for thirty minutes in each language and then they transcribed both linguistic and nonlinguistic interaction with their context . 4572965_4581785
and I think that's very interesting because most people do just audiotaping and they just get the speech but they also did the interactions the nonlinguistic interactions in the context to really to catch the situation especially for &-um conversational switching was important . 4582445_4611725
the results presented concern pragmatic and syntactic aspects <of the> of the mixed speech of two children Annika and Ivar both first born growing up in middle class families in Hamburg both mothers are French and both fathers German and each parents uses her or his respective language to talk to the child . 4601625_4620265
Annika's parents talk to each_other in German where Ivar's parents talk in French . 4621105_4625665
French is initially the dominant input language for both children because of their mothers but after age two two &~w <two six> two six means two years and six months &-um Annika's German was stronger whereas for Ivar both languages were always in balance and that was due &~t can you imagine what was due to ? 4627405_4648145

okay +... 4884945_4885385
we continue &-um (0.4) it is important to separate both languages for one reason because &-um the communication will be determined by the automonolingual@n$adj that means that code switching is expected to occur less often in a situation that is pure monolingual than in a bilingual situation but it's interesting because the use of two codes will be motivated by situational &-uh factors like language choice according to the interlocutor . 4887545_4917525
so if you have a monolingual pure monolingual context and &~mi mixes occur as well it will be interesting to see why &~th why do these mixes occur there &-uh as &~o opposed to if you have a bilingual situation when you have speakers of both languages . 4921485_4936485
it would be more logical that children mix because they're talking . 4937545_4940305
they're code switching . 4940485_4941185
they're talking to both &-um speakers . 4941405_4943665
but if just now pure monolingual and they mix <this is> this is really &-um a chance to observe the motivations and the external factors that children may have to mix these languages in this situation that should be monolingual . 4943765_4956645
the empirical results of the study &-um they said that's at an early +//. 4958165_4964405
starting with the pragmatic functions at an early stage of development if the child's utterances do not correspond to the regularities &-um in use in its linguistic requirements we may conclude that the child has not acquired those rules . 4965385_4979765
but this may not be true because it could also be that the child has developed his own rules and of language choice . 4980465_4988385
and then they don't &~cor coincide with the ones of his environment . 4988565_4991885
so this is the two possibilities they're playing with . 4992585_4994965
in in the data both children they select the appropriate language with each interlocutor from age one four for &-um Annika and one five for for Ivar onwards . 4996305_5007925
and the first code switching appear when the children were addressed by another person and answered to the respective language . 5009225_5014845
we have here in on the third page you have in the handout you have an example . 5015645_5019965

and then and Ivar directs himself to the German interviewer and said &{l=READING will@s:fra weggehen@s:fra &}l=READING . 5031845_5037345
I mean so he's switching &-uh languages according to the interlocutor . 5037505_5041105
&-um &~su switches occur &~fr like we can see here from two &~ele he is at two eleven but it start to occur from two five onwards and even two years old sharp for Annika . 5042745_5055505

also self-initiated switches are really interesting is when the child addresses someone without being asked and started to appear from age two point two eight for Ivar and two for Annika . 5067565_5078565
Annika seems to be pretty &-uh advanced for some things . 5078665_5082165
but we'll see later that there's some contradictions in her as well . 5082245_5085565
and there's an example here example number two when &~I Ivar interacts with both interviewers switching between languages and translating &~wi and also few errors occurred . 5086935_5097355

and they're self-initiated switches he &-um it came from from himself . 5124955_5129955
there's an example number three with Annika when she corrects her errors and adopts different strategies to avoid errors or when she uses the incorrect language . 5131305_5141865

&-um talking about the syntactic constraints in code switching &-um it was observed a high mixing rate from the beginning of the records onwards which at the ages of two five and two zero for for Annika &~in decreased . 5248885_5265605
&-uh with respect to the frequency of specific syntactic categories like we said nouns and noun phrases are mixed throughout the whole period of the investigation . 5265925_5275805
but function words decreased constantly from age two &~fou two five and two respectively which this coincide with &~st previous studies . 5276005_5285285
and concerning the sentential position of switches &-um after two four most mixes concerned sentences with a mix of elements and can occur between all kinds of constituents as we see in example five das@s:fra bateau@s:fra is +//. 5286265_5301205

and this preference cannot be accounted for in terms of syntactic constraints &-um because well we &~h they assume that they don't have syntactic constraints at this age yet . 5313285_5327745
because they +//. 5328065_5328785

I can remind you if you want to . 5349925_5353465
it says that no switching can occur between a bound morpheme and a lexical form unless that phonological form is phonologically integrated in &~tha into the language mm to the bound morpheme . 5352105_5364425
for instance you remember we have an example it was &~catche@s:fra catcheando@s:fra &=writes:board xxx from like catching . 5365125_5373585

this is what he used to do it nounours@s:fra il@s:fra a@s:fra reite@s:fra and deddy@s:fra resucht@s:fra so it's it's a mixture between French and and German . 5447055_5456635

after the age of two five again with Ivar &-um Ivar's xxx missing was reduced to insertion of single nouns or switching between determiners and nouns in the object noun phrase . 5478295_5489335
we have that we can see that in example seven moi@s:fra je@s:fra va@s:fra a@s:fra la@s:fra kuche@s:fra so it's &-uh just the word kuche@s:fra kitchen inserted there &-uh and like I said before Annika's data is &~con contradicting Ivar's data she uses the switch within sentences with omitted elements at a later &-er age . 5489915_5510255
when she was already four years old like we can see in example eight she's saying il@s:fra a@s:fra gewonnen@s:fra and also ca@s:fra c'est@s:fra Daniels@s:fra we talked about this in class she's given the word +//. 5510645_5522445

mhm .
yeah that's the most difficult thing +/. 5592815_5595775
mhm +/.
+, to see &-um well continuing almost finished &-um on the basis of &~quan qualitative and quantitative changes it seems to be two stages of syntactical development in children according to all this data . 5597245_5611385
and &-um and one will be characterized by the absence of the functional category &~infi INFL the &~infla inflection which doesn't appear to be syntactically constrained the the utterances . 5611575_5626315
that that means this &~co code mixing we talked about and around the age of two and half children stop mixing function words and rarely violate syntactic constraints on code switching of the type Poplack &-uh presented . 5626645_5639645
and this coincides with the emergence of the functional category INFL . 5640245_5643325
which seems to account for qualitative &~ch changes in the child's speech by the transition from mixing function words to lexical categories nouns and the ability to respect grammatical constraints in code switching . 5644275_5655815
in Annika's data from age two six onwards most of her &~mix mixes seems to concern single nouns inserted and the switch &-um at the switch point &~dertermina determiner noun like the ones we've seen before . 5656715_5671455
and if we see this &-um &-um tables we can see the tendency the the utterances in German what he says &-um total mix +//. 5672285_5685085
we can say we can go for the percentages maybe it's the easiest percentages of mix for German utterances and for French utterances we can see that there tend to disappear towards age three and we compare mm Ivar and Annika Annika is two eleven she's practically also three . 5685205_5704585
and if we take the very last two columns in both &-um tables we can see the function and lexical percentages +/. 5705565_5712465

+, ⌊ for the ⌋ switches and they're they're going the functional they're disappearing whereas the lexical are present . 5712585_5720425
there so hundred percent from age three five approximately for one child and yeah two six for the other there's a clear separation . 5721125_5732585
and we can see that all switches are lexical and function &~switc functional switches functional word switches are are gone . 5733405_5740525
which this &-uh corroborates with the first assumption and other other authors' &-um hypothesis too . 5741865_5750165
&-uh the conclusion is that changes in formal properties of the mixed speech of bilingual children are related to grammatical developments . 5751245_5758585
+, mhm +/.
+, the the completion . 5759565_5760025
the appearance of the functional category INFL again accounts for changes in code switching . 5760645_5764505
the development of pragmatic function however the the the doesn't seem to observe grammatical constraints they're separate things after all although they're inter related but we're talking about different things pragmatic <aspects of> code switching are influenced by several factors of language use in the family the parents expectations about language choice and also the reactions to code switching . 5765525_5788725
&-um which may contribute to the separation of languages and the development of specific strategies to help avoiding mixing . 5790085_5797165
like with Annika xxx points for further investigation &-uh will be to have a look at the causes of early mixing . 5797425_5807725
are they pragmatic motivations for mixing of function words or does this kind of mixing indicate fusion of both language systems ? 5808345_5814805
this eternal conflict between are they two separate systems from the beginning or only one ? 5815335_5820255
and I think this is still under debate . 5820795_5822535
and also correlations between grammatical developments and formal aspects of language mixing are they really universal ? 5823455_5829695
and that's why Koeppe and Meisel suggest that it would be interesting to analyze the the speech of more children acquiring different languages with respect to these questions . 5830575_5839975
and that's where this study I've talked about before Elizabeth Lanza she she does &~thi this kind of study with Norwegian and English and she said that it doesn't hold out this &~k this Koeppe and Meisel what they they found out it doesn't hold up their in her &-uh informants there're changes there're different &-um well results with respect to this analysis . 5840485_5868585
and she found out that that her informants mixed function words until the age of two seven . 5869675_5875175
so it's a_lot later than than xxx . 5875495_5876935
well they did actually stop doing it ? 5877255_5879475
