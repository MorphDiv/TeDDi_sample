xxx four . 0_6095
one for each group of four . 6095_7201
okay ? 7201_8186
or three . 8186_8736
okay ? 8736_11473
okay guys, let's get started here . 11473_14191
okay, listen closely . 14191_16728
to save a little time I won't bring out my overhead like you're usually accustomed to . 16728_21276
dear +... 21276_21491
thank you . 21491_22286
okay ? 22286_22653
instead, let me just tell you . 22653_24981
what I'm going to give you for each group is a little three page packet . 24981_31115
okay ? 31115_31870
what I need for you to do right now is, every one of you get out a blank sheet of paper . 31870_36395
every one of you needs a blank sheet of paper . 36395_38698
thank you . 38698_41028
ashley, can I have a piece of paper ? 41028_45123
just put it right on the table back there, xxx . 45123_48641
thank you . 48641_49361
thank you Sarah . 49361_64548
don't leave without it, all right . 64548_66075
oh, xxx . 66075_68258
okay . 68258_68700
now here you go . 68700_74483
all right . 74483_77375
okay, so +... 77375_81001
listen closely now . 81001_83326
everybody ready ? 83326_84216
yep . 84216_84848
okay, everybody within your group of four or three, you need to work together . 84848_90975
I know normally we work in pairs . 90975_92710
okay ? 92710_93881
but I figured today you have another pair of students +... 93881_98913
you know, a couple of extra brains there to help you get through this little lesson . 98913_103486
okay ? 103486_104080
we've done this plenty of times before . 104080_106773
some of you honestly are still a little shaky . 106773_109165
so, if you look at the packet which you are all sharing as a group +... 109165_115210
page one has five equations I want you to graph . 115210_120526
now you can graph it any way that you know how to do it, as long as you do it correctly . 120526_125560
can someone raise their hand and tell me what's one obvious thing that I can do to graph ? 125560_129743
nick ? 129743_130236
the slope . 130236_130813
use the slope with the ? 130813_132910
y intercept and X intercept . 132910_134141
y intercept . 134141_134606
right ? 134606_134990
that's probably the way you'll probably want to do it, right Nick ? 134990_137141
yeah . 137141_137820
is there another way, though ? 137820_139293
Robert ? 139293_140580
use the, um, tables . 140580_142088
right, to make a table for the equation, right ? 142088_144536
and then plot the points from the table . 144536_145951
everyone got that ? 145951_147310
so those are the two main ways, right, we can graph those equations ? 147310_150638
so right now I need you to get started . 150638_152890
the key thing is when you're done with the first five, the first page, as noted on the paper, please make sure I check to make +... 152890_160658
make sure you did it right before you move on . 160658_162920
okay ? 162920_163775
so go ahead and get started . 163775_165506
Nick, question ? 165506_167673
where's the +... 167673_168745
oh, right here ? 168745_169090
yeah . 169090_169835
you're going to graph on that . 169835_171370
that is your result for your group . 171370_173226
so everybody has to do one graph, right ? 173226_174081
right . 174081_174480
so someone here can assign themselves as the grapher or whatever . 174480_178898
the rest of you kind of work together to make sure it's accurate . 178898_182746
okay ? 182746_183728
you going to do it ? 183728_184545
good job, Nick . 184545_185248
yes ? 185248_186796
all right, the grid paper all right, you know what ? 186796_190841
hey, listen up real quick . 190841_192690
five, four, three, two, one, zero . 192690_195641
I probably forgot 'cause I'm still a little nervous . 195641_198026
okay ? 198026_198925
but the grid paper, you have one per group . 198925_202896
right ? 202896_203425
so I'm relying on one of you in that group to be the designated grapher for the group . 203425_210015
but the rest of you please help out you know, help each other . 210015_214891
get the graphs done correctly . 214891_217450
okay ? 217450_217820
there you go, Robert . 217820_221001
so while he's doing that, let's get started on this, guys . 221001_223953
what are we going to do ? 223953_224651
do we write this on our piece of paper ? 224651_225936
yeah . 225936_226265
oh, okay . 226265_227290
all right ? 227290_227665
this is actually the use the ruler, Robert . 227665_230523
use the ruler man . 230523_231011
make it neat . 231011_232588
all right ? 232588_233416
Mister Ormsby, you know, when you put, like, a one in here, would you go like, times +... 233416_238768
ah, see, so now you've already forgotten, right ? 238768_240791
first of all zeros are our favorite number, right ? 240791_243360
yeah . 243360_244078
you put in zero . 244078_244813
two thirds times zero is what ? 244813_246710
zero . 246710_247151
plus eight is ? 247151_248291
eight . 248291_248765
eight . 248765_248975
now because this fraction is a two thirds, do you remember what I told you what numbers you should pick now ? 248975_255331
um, threes . 255331_257635
all right . 257635_258621
so maybe zero, three and six would be good numbers to try with this one, right ? 258621_262835
that way you don't have to worry about fractions and mixed numbers . 262835_265510
okay . 265510_266281
okay ? 266281_266731
all right . 266731_268170
Mister Ormsby, whoo hoo . 268170_269395
okay . 269395_270243
Mister, I forgot how to do these again . 270243_272308
like how do you do x@l and Y ? 272308_274281
okay, so now wait a minute . 274281_276053
you want to make a table then, right ? 276053_277628
so you're going to make an x@l y@l table, okay ? 277628_280183
now +... 280183_281750
the idea again is, to make our points we just pick any number we want for x@l . 281750_287845
we can do that, right ? 287845_288685
everybody agree ? 288685_290173
Jenna ? 290173_290526
yeah . 290526_291060
so it was zero, one, two and +... 291060_292826
ah, that's true, except because this is a two thirds fraction +... 292826_296851
you want to pick three as like +/. 296851_299251
exactly . 299251_300130
negative three, zero and three . 300130_301241
right, and if you want to just do zero, three, six and stay away from negatives, you can do that too . 301241_306210
all right ? 306210_307321
I got six xxx in the middle . 307321_308961
so, zero, three, six . 308961_310926
I get six . 310926_311491
right . 311491_312806
okay . 312806_313236
and you think you can do it on your own now ? 313236_315270
you just want to be on the camera . 315270_318775
okay . 318775_319071
no, that's not true . 319071_319860
okay, we're going to put in zero here, right ? 319860_322588
okay . 322588_323028
what's two thirds times zero ? 323028_324516
zero . 324516_325333
everybody watching, right ? 325333_326470
plus eight is ? 326470_327523
eight . 327523_328243
eight . 328243_328548
so three times two is <six> . 328548_331431
<six> . 331431_331880
divided by <three is two> . 331880_333530
<three is two> . 333530_335263
plus <eight is> +... 335263_336098
<eight is> ? 336098_336595
ten . 336595_336945
okay I get it . 336945_337430
thank you Mister Ormsby . 337430_337968
okay . 337968_338316
good job . 338316_339551
so six times +... 339551_341091
all right, so, okay, this is what I did . 341091_343475
I put three negative three, zero, three and six, all right ? 343475_346111
okay . 346111_346360
how come you have your table backwards ? 346360_347593
I've never done that before . 347593_348455
well, I did that . 348455_349425
okay . 349425_349745
it's easier this way . 349745_351016
it's easier . 351016_351696
all right, if you say so . 351696_353368
anyways, I put negative three, so, I put two thirds and then +... 353368_358448
times negative three . 358448_359488
yeah . 359488_359913
negative three goes in the top, right ? 359913_361255
right . 361255_361785
well, you negative three, you remember, is negative three over one . 361785_364738
there you go . 364738_365216
so so it's a one and a one . 365216_366870
but that's a negative still, right ? 366870_368270
right . 368270_368543
that's still a negative there . 368543_369543
so it's negative two ? 369543_370830
so it's negative two . 370830_371463
plus eight is ? 371463_372073
six . 372073_373575
yeah . 373575_374646
see, I knew that . 374646_376110
so negative three is six, zero is eight . 376110_378040
now three I question, though . 378040_380065
try a positive three . 380065_382288
cause they're both positive so +... 382288_383831
two third so, three, one +... 383831_385551
oh . 385551_386840
okay . 386840_387470
one one, and then three, eight, eleven . 387470_390825
no, wait a minute . 390825_391863
wait a minute . 391863_392431
two . 392431_392855
one is +... 392855_393951
and five . 393951_394401
two plus wait a minute, no, you were timesing@wp it . 394401_395878
oh . 395878_396528
it's two so +... 396528_397423
it's ten . 397423_397955
yeah . 397955_398458
it's ten . 398458_398635
and then six is twelve . 398635_400290
it's six then ten and twelve . 400290_401256
okay . 401256_401858
all right . 401858_403218
yes ? 403218_403858
all right, I just totally forgot um, you know, how to do the graph . 403858_408153
okay, now what I liked you at least remember to use multiples . 408153_412305
like this one let's try this one right here . 412305_414448
all right ? 414448_414760
okay . 414760_415641
you remembered to use fives, but let's try zero . 415641_417418
if I put in zero there, what's three fifths times zero ? 417418_419530
um +... 419530_421546
zero ? 421546_422450
right . 422450_422896
minus ten . 422896_423866
is negative ten ? 423866_425003
so put a negative ten there . 425003_426435
so now you're going to now try five in there, right ? 426435_429536
okay . 429536_430431
so just write a little five there so you can mentally see it . 430431_433898
so if I do three times five that's ? 433898_436248
fifteen . 436248_437191
now remember I'm going to divide by the five, which gives me ? 437191_439466
three . 439466_439801
minus ten . 439801_441313
negative seven . 441313_444065
good job . 444065_444808
I think you got it now . 444808_446651
oh, okay . 446651_447308
all right . 447308_447683
finish it up . 447683_448178
Mister Ormsby ? 448178_449316
all right . 449316_449755
uh, how many points do you want us to plot ? 449755_451666
three or four ? 451666_452635
well that's a very good question . 452635_453921
obviously, how many points do I really need to make a line ? 453921_456401
two . 456401_456768
two . 456768_457275
right ? 457275_457906
but just to make sure +... 457906_459835
three . 459835_460723
plot at least three points . 460723_462043
okay . 462043_462705
that way if they're all in a line you know you did it right . 462705_464905
okay ? 464905_465666
Mister Ormsby . 465666_467351
yeah ? 467351_467951
I made the graph . 467951_471555
use the whole paper, man . 471555_472978
look at these big grid lines here . 472978_475121
everyone, make it count one . 475121_477015
okay ? 477015_478096
don't we have to use use graph graph every single one of those ? 478096_480935
yeah, you're going to graph these five . 480935_482596
that's why I want you to use the whole paper . 482596_484441
make a big coordinate system . 484441_485356
oh . 485356_486245
as a matter of fact let me give you a fresh one to save you some time . 486245_487548
oh, okay . 487548_490001
all right, now I get it . 490001_491488
all right . 491488_493963
so, we have to make one big, um +... 493963_496563
okay . 496563_497818
so start over again . 497818_500073
use the whole coordinate system, that way all the lines are nicely spaced out and everything . 500073_504245
all right . 504245_504753
okay ? 504753_505395
we're out of xxx . 505395_506448
okay, well how do you want to graph it ? 506448_509471
using an x@l y@l table ? 509471_511025
yeah . 511025_512111
or do you want to learn how to use slope and y@l intercept ? 512111_515191
x@l y@l table . 515191_516208
okay . 516208_517228
so you're gonna make a x@l y@l table . 517228_519143
do you agree, Ben ? 519143_522198
all right . 522198_523445
see, if you work with Chris side by side, then you can compare answers . 523445_528910
right ? 528910_529293
mm hm . 529293_529836
don't just rely on Chris here . 529836_531471
all right now, Chris, the idea is I'm gonna plug in any values I really want for x@l and figure out my corresponding y@l . 531471_537906
okay ? 537906_538571
but because this fraction is a two thirds, what numbers should I possibly use that would make it easier for me ? 538571_545626
three . 545626_546516
numbers based on three . 546516_548135
so like maybe negative three, zero, three, six . 548135_551923
or zero, three, six, would be good enough, right ? 551923_554610
yeah . 554610_555188
that way you can get that graph down . 555188_556715
okay ? 556715_558651
