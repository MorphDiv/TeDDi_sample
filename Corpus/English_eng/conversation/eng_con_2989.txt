listen up for one moment . 685_1305
all right, so you'll see that those last couple of questions have to do with something beyond the text . 2705_9265
so we've got the text up here and I want to talk to you guys for just a second . 9445_13545
xxx ?
can you take your headphones out for a second just so I know you're listening . 13925_17425
thank you . 17705_18165
I want to talk to you guys for a second about contextualization . 18905_21585
now we've done this before, we've talked about this a lot, and contextualization is basically using events that we know are happening around this document, around this text, around this opinion, that might help us understand the opinion more deeply or more fully, and then in turn, the document itself can help us understand those events . 21705_45885
so when I'm talking about contextualization for this particular document, we are lucky as historians, xxx, because we know that these events are in some way relevant to the documents itself . 46785_58665
we know the author here from the source note, Thomas Hobbes the Leviathan, written in sixteen-fifty-one . 59325_66125
but I feel like there's always something happening in the world . 66725_69665
so what if it was set in another time period ? 70125_72565
right but +... 73025_75025
whereas now, and even though there's no xxx . 74105_76125
sure . 77585_80745
xxx .
how America works, a lot of politics, a lot of day to day, singular social events that happens to someone personally . 80985_92665
sure . 92725_92865
xxx .
that affects the way he looks at things, but every day we always have to fight against something that we think is bad . 96075_102195
absolutely . 102335_102795
but consider this, the average person living in America, now I'm making a generalization here, and I'm talking about a war that's ongoing, might have a different view of society or a different estimation of humanity than someone who let's say is a high schooler in Syria right now where there's a civil war going on . 103315_122215
right ? 122475_122655
so that might affect, that might color the lens with which Thomas Hobbes is viewing and philosophizing about the world at large . 122985_131645
now let's open this up for debate . 132345_133625
does reading Thomas Hobbes at all change your opinion regarding humanity ? 134565_139005
do you think that this guy makes any sense when he says that the state of nature is a time of conflict and competition ? 139125_146405
S_three, what do you think, your hand was up ? 147505_149285
I think he makes a lot of sense, but I think he has such a pessimistic view because he's a philosopher and they analyze everything to the point of just putting it bluntly . 149605_160405
so it was like . 160645_161025
okay .
in his eyes the duality might not be as clear because you never really see too many philosophers who always bring out the good in things . 161465_170325
he puts it bluntly because that's what he does for a living . 170825_173585
so it's like if he was to say +... 173905_175185
I see you guys . 175265_175585
humanity is all good and everything, he might feel as if he's sugarcoating how bad things get . 176045_180385
so I think that's a really good summary of how philosophers might be apt to view the world in a certain way . 180565_192085
now as we go through this, if we could point to just portions in the text where you see Hobbes making a certain point, that would be great, just so we know where we can all look . 192265_201025
S_four and S_one . 201485_202065
and if you could just turn so everyone can hear you, that'd be awesome . 203905_206005
so I understand what he's saying as far as being in competition . 207165_212225
where is he saying that ? 212585_213505
where exactly ? 213625_214105
I can highlight it for us, xxx . 214305_215625
you're going to want to look at the second paragraph there xxx . 234005_236565
and therefore an intimate xxx +... 237765_243025
all right, I got you . 243765_246125
so what do you want to say about it ? 246265_247125
us today, I feel like that's what we have to do . 247305_254245
if you think about it, it might not necessarily be physical competition, but if you think about how +... 254365_261345
I promise I'm going to take that phone, put it away . 262045_263485
if you think about how xxx . 263685_264365
like all these people in the world competing to want something . 264645_275885
so maybe in his time, competing is a bad thing like us today it's what we have to do . 276185_285785
oh, so you're saying that he might be viewing competition entirely in the wrong way that it might actually be something good . 285745_292645
let's go to S_one and then I see you on response and then S_six . 292785_297045
I completely agree . 301425_305445
because even when I'm training at dance, my dance teacher says you're putting in all the work that you think you could put in, but somewhere in say another dance studio, someone is training two thousand times harder than you . 305405_320565
so I guess we're made to be put into competition, to have that type of desire to be better than someone else . 320985_329505
so you're, you're building off of S_four here . 329745_332165
it kind of the same the same way in saying that competition exists . 332845_337005
it is a force that moves society and it is in fact not necessarily all a bad thing . 337245_342405
all right, fair enough . 343385_344125
S_five and then S_six I didn't forget . 344265_346225
yeah so like he was saying like, cause he was looking at competition; xxx . 346565_356905
he wasn't looking as if it was like a real like competition . 358145_361245
like it'll like small like what you would expect to be a competition wasn't actually a competition . 361605_366485
he was saying as if like during, I guess his time during his time his competition was who was going to be the higher person in charge, like who was going to be the next king, who was going to be the next queen, who is going to take over this country . 367325_379085
who is going to take over that, that private state, whatever . 379505_382285
they were all fighting to see who owned the most land . 383305_386485
right . 386855_387135
and then say to people who once were friends to people who once were friends, wanted the same type of land, they would become enemies because they wanted the same type of land and they both couldn't have it . 387435_404595
that one person got it over them . 405455_406875
they would have been mad . 406995_407715
and you know, they would just become enemies . 408175_410255
so you're saying now I just want to be clear, you're saying that there's something about our society today that is somehow different . 410565_417205
is that, is that fair ? 417385_418165
yeah . 418505_418785
all right .
now I want us to hold that in our mind because in a second we're going to be talking about what that difference might be . 419025_424225
S_six .
sorry . 424725_425785
so on the first paragraph we talked about like how each every man is born with the same ability to you know, conquer like do the same thing . 430425_446405
all right . 446745_446845
is that, is that about where it is ? 447205_448845
yes . 449025_450965
alright, there we go . 451105_451845
so me, S_four, xxx, and S_one gave example about like how there's like this really buff guy, really like little scrawny guy and you know, they could be ready to fight and people may think that the bigger guy has an advantage, but you know, the little guy might have a mental advantage . 452185_472585
he might be smart enough, this is a smart but like to pull out a knife or a gun to either take the person down without his physical self being a part of it . 472705_482305
sure . 482485_482525
so my point was, oh I think people like one of the reasons why he says that war and stuff is because people look once people like in the first like you mentioned in the first paragraph, where everyone is born with the same abilities and stuff . 482945_507685
some people don't want to be like that ordinary . 509115_511355
so they look for a flaw like things that other people lack to make themselves feel better . 511635_516035
okay .
and then that's when I think they use it to like boost themselves and everybody does that and it becomes competition . 516695_525195
all right .
I think you're raising a great point about what can happen when there's a perceived equality and people want to rise above that . 525655_533215
so I want to clarify here . 533815_535295
Thomas Hobbes is saying something about equality of man that when people are roughly equal, something happens . 535745_542005
what is he saying that equality creates, what does the equality engender, what happens when people are mostly equal ? 542805_550365
yes . 551165_551405
S_seven, your hand was halfway up . 551685_552865
well cause I'm not sure I'm going to say that of like kind of like what S_six said everyone wants to find a way in which they are different from the equal because nobody wants to generally be just like everybody else . 553275_571935
it's something encouraged in our society to find something that's uniquely about you . 572135_577455
and I think that that's been there since the beginning . 577875_580195
some people have some special skills and that's why we get different jobs . 580355_586295
everybody gets different jobs for what they're best at . 586435_588935
sure .
since the beginning . 589775_590475
so I think it's always been encouraged to find what that job, whether it's a real job or just like a hobby that you have, it's really, people use that as a way to feel different than your equal other because you want to find a way to not maybe like one up, but just feel like you're out of that . 590865_610165
and sometimes that creates competition cause you find somebody else who also has the same thing . 610965_616125
like, I'm good at art, you're good at art . 616825_618785
oh my God, now who's better ? 618945_620925
so it leads you to the competition ? 621025_622185
and if you're both equal then you might feel the need to fight about it . 622445_625885
if one person is clearly superior to the other than the person who is inferior isn't going to try to take on the bigger guy (be)cause he knows . 626065_632305
but if you're both equal then you might think, oh I've got a chance here . 632765_636905
right .
and let's, let's go for it . 637485_638565
I want to point to question three for just a second before we get into the speech writing . 638965_642245
(be)cause I know you guys are masterful falling asleep right now . 642525_645605
wordsmiths right . 645905_646725
perk up for a second . 647315_648215
what is this idea of the power, if we go to this last paragraph, this common power will keep them in awe . 649135_657295
this is his solution to the state of nature . 657435_660395
but what's he saying ? 661395_662195
yeah S_four, what's he saying ? 662935_663895
I think he's saying like if everybody had the same, like if everyone stayed with the same ability and with everybody had the same intelligence +... 666005_678725
it will keep everybody like, like not, not cocky but like, what's the word ? 692775_699815
not humble but humble . 699975_700915
humble . 701215_701395
yet it will keep everybody humble because they like, okay . 701675_705475
it's like, like you were saying, if I feel that I'm smarter than you or stronger than you, I won't try to like flaunt that in your face, because I know that we are the same . 705775_714795
so what he's saying is that everybody had the common power +... 715175_717535
I'm going to, I see exactly what you're saying and your reasoning is absolutely correct, but when he's using common xxx . 719225_725165
what he's saying here is that if all people were subject to the same overall authority, that would keep them in awe, that would be so powerful . 728305_739005
then they are, then they can live without the condition which is called war . 740785_746225
right ? 746365_746385
so when men don't have a power to keep them in check, they're liable to be in competition with each other . 746865_754765
so what he's saying here in this last part, and this is the argument we're going to pick up on on Monday, and this relates to government, right, is that in the state of nature +... 754925_764645
one second over here +... 765125_765665
in the state of nature, all men are in competition . 765825_768025
and the way to get out of that terrible state of nature where we're killing each other is for there to be a common power which can keep us in awe . 768945_776685
and that common power for him is a particular type of government . 776965_781865
all right . 782505_782665
all right, so I want you to start focusing on the speeches right after S_eight says her piece . 782805_787725
yeah, xxx . 788025_788185
I was going to say what they all were saying about power and taking each other down was with the election . 789605_797965
so we see everyone from the power itself and people used to be friends are now enemies and now everyone is trying to find the little small things . 798505_810605
xxx like that's why they go into your background and they'll say all the smallest and slightest things that doesn't really mean nothing and make it bigger than what it seems . 812235_822255
but if let me ask you this, if there was one candidate that was obviously way better than the others and way more powerful than the others and clearly going to win, would everybody be in competition ? 823215_832575
no .
no, there'll be that one person and you would know . 832935_835535
so let's hold that in the back of our minds for Monday, but right now +... 835995_838955
I'll get you in a second xxx . 840515_841335
I want you to write your speech to the aliens, right ? 841575_845075
defend humanity or indict humanity . 845395_848675
is humanity bad ? 849075_849895
is humanity good ? 850035_850875
has Hobbes influenced you ? 851015_852215
maybe you can quote Hobbes in some way . 852255_854115
either agreeing or disagreeing . 854735_856355
