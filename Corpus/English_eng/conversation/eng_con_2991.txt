oh wait, let me ask a shared knowledge question in chemistry last year I think you learned about this . 1065_7585
I know that she taught it this year in honors camp, I saw Mrs . 8225_10905
xxx doing it . 11225_11845
I'm talking about phase changes from solid to liquid to gas or from gas to liquid down to solid and whether energy is released or absorbed in the process . 12325_23165
does anybody remember learning that back ? 23365_25125
exothermic reactions . 25305_26165
okay, so what, what's happening in terms of a state of matter or phase of matter ? 27075_33855
when you set off the hot pack ? 34355_35855
well, obviously it's changing from a liquid to a solid and it's exothermic because it gives off heat but I don't really know why . 36755_45795
I mean I know how it talks about how water it goes down to thirty-two degrees until there's zero degrees Fahrenheit until all of it's frozen and then it drops xxx . 48165_58745
so that's probably, I don't know, is there a capacity of water to only go down to thirty-two degrees ? 59245_67365
so maybe there's a capacity in the liquid form of sodium acetate to go to even a lower temperature and then when you click it releasing energy and turning it into a solid it drops, it jumps back up . 67785_83605
I don't really understand . 84085_85365
yes . 85765_86425
I found that surprising too in the reading how it said about the water . 86425_93925
you cool water to below freezing but then when you set off the ice crystal in it somehow, either by dropping it or whatever, it'll jump back up to thirty-two Fahrenheit or zero Celsius . 94025_106705
that's kind of interesting that it does that . 106905_109145
what is it in terms of the molecules of the substance, like if you could shrink yourself down and look at them, what would you notice the difference between like a liquid and a solid ? 109885_120045
because, we're talking about going from a liquid to a solid . 120965_122545
so what, what literally happens to the molecules in that ? 122745_125345
they become closer together when they're in a cell, they're more spread apart when they're in a liquid and even further apart when they're in a gas whereas when they're in a solid they come closer together . 125665_134145
I think when we're talking about things like water and sodium acetate, but also crystallized xxx they go into a lattice structure, which is order . 134505_146145
so I guess that would be xxx . 147085_147965
so, you're saying a lattice structure . 151425_152845
in other words, they're becoming what together ? 153185_155725
bonds .
okay . 156685_158905
oh okay . 161245_161625
so if something bonds and it needs, oh no that doesn't explain giving off xxx because to bond it needs energy . 161825_174365
so I don't understand how going from a liquid to a solid gives the off energy . 179185_184305
is it the fact that we clicked the disc ? 186325_189285
I was really confused when it happened . 189705_195805
I was like, it was almost, it looks like a cloud . 196085_201065
like it didn't look like kind of a very fast reaction . 201585_205285
it kind of spread, which I thought was, like, kind of different . 205345_210165
I didn't know why it would spread rather than just be a fast . 210725_215105
I felt it like, kind of spread because when the reaction started, it starts near the disk and then it reacts with each molecule after it . 216425_225565
so, when it jumped from here to this molecule over here and just kind of all do it at once and kind of just one happened and then another happened and they all just switched . 226025_236265
well, just keep discussing guys, I'll be right back . 237345_239245
good discussion . 239545_240245
I noticed that when you flip the disks more times the faster the reaction occurred . 240765_244225
so, it's just adding more activation energy . 244685_246625
xxx hit once and it was kind of slow moving but I clicked it seven times and it just +... 247505_254725
really fast . 254505_255265
so, I think the amount of energy you add has to do with how fast the reaction occurs as well . 256405_260225
as, regarding to the examples from the models, the only one I really had a big problem with was number two because it said that an increase in entropy occurred, but according to the reading, when you go into the solid to a liquid, that means there's more entropy, but since we're going to a liquid to a solid I mean it would be less . 263505_284245
yeah I was confused kind of with the entropy, exactly what happens . 288725_294805
so, I was unsure about that claim but as we were talking about it, it kind of made more sense when you said that like that . 295105_302185
I think it just kind of bugs me because it doesn't explain really at all, the relationship between entropy and temperature . 302785_309985
it tries to show you what exactly is going on here, but I don't really understand but I think that it is an exothermic reaction, but I don't think the increase in entropy is what makes it an exothermic reaction . 310245_322185
so, I agree you . 322505_323125
well maybe the fact that entropy is the measure of disorder, so if you consider disorder to be movement of molecules . 323505_329985
the movement of molecules would increase entropy increased, causing the heat energy . 330225_335145
but, it's not really explained in any of the information they gave us, so we don't really have enough to say that's accurate . 338745_343645
well, that bothers me .
yeah, but if that's true, disorder would create more energy which would create more heat but when it's in a song you'd have a different order, which doesn't make sense . 344805_356765
I just wish we had one of the things so that we can look at it . 357145_359905
yeah, they asked for one . 360385_363025
Mr . 363545_363885
xxx ?
can we have a heat pack ? 363965_366045
can you have a what ? 368005_368125
you want one ? 368225_369265
yeah . 369465_369605
here you go .
thank you . 371405_371825
what're we doing with this ? 372025_374805
do you want to just do it ? 375385_376705
are we just playing with ? 376845_377785
I like it how it how it has xxx . 378165_380285
okay, so the, yeah, the disc has all sorts of little divots in it . 380605_384625
yeah .
the shape, it's not really flat, it's bigger than I remember too . 387565_393645
how does it feel in terms of temperature ? 394745_396705
it's kind of room temperature right now . 396865_398765
so it's at what the ambient room temperature ? 400285_405205
yeah . 405525_405965
do you think we can activate it without the desk ? 408085_410105
you can try . 411145_413045
how would you test that ? 413385_415085
we'd have to use lots of force . 415425_418425
yeah, we don't want to like, yeah, you can try dropping if you want . 419715_424955
do you want to drop it ? 425735_426515
we may as well . 426535_427535
give it a shot . 428055_428775
oh it did work . 431755_432575
oh my god it worked . 433015_433955
it went off ? 434015_434555
but, the disk went off . 434695_435755
it went off around the disk . 435835_436655
it hit the disk ? 436655_437295
yeah . 437355_437595
oh, the disk hit okay . 437735_438795
there it goes . 440075_440975
it's so cool .
and now it's warm . 448665_449765
I never really +... 451965_452925
it feels like coffee beans or something inside it .
coffee balls .
now we know we don't need to do that to activate it but I still feel like xxx . 454385_462965
well, an interesting question would be if there was no disk in it . 463245_468345
how would you +...
could you set it off ? 468765_470025
like if you dropped it you know ? 470125_470985
was it the disk hitting the floor that made it go off or . 471065_473245
yeah, I think that was probably it . 473265_474165
there would be more testing needed . 474205_476165
fourth period was telling me they're selling these in the hall now . 482865_485505
yeah, they're trying to . 486305_487365
so I didn't know that . 487745_488705
I don't think they have the Quality Talk logo on them though . 489245_491605
no, that makes it cooler . 491745_492525
does anyone else have an authentic question they could share with us or do you, or another thing is to look at the claims, like what did you, which claims do you think are scientifically valid and which aren't ? 493345_504565
so a few more minutes here . 504705_506505
so, do we all say that family one ? 507085_508985
xxx .
because, we definitely required the activation energy in order to get it started . 511195_514455
as we saw from dropping it on the floor and clicking it yesterday . 514735_517455
I think we just don't really know how to make the connection between the force of the poppers thing and the actual activations of crystallization . 518735_528735
but, yeah I agree with that one . 529435_531435
so what you're saying is you think the claim is correct, but you're having trouble giving really complete reasoning ? 531855_539095
yeah . 539435_539675
well, the reasoning I gave was that since all changes or chemical or physical changes require activation energy and the reaction that occurs after the clicking, then that must account for the activation energy . 539815_552215
but I don't understand how the specific type of activation energy in this case causes the crystallization . 552415_558235
I mean I imagine it just rearranges certain molecules in such a way that causes them to bond in a crystal way but I don't really know the little nuances and why that happens . 560205_572085
okay . 572905_573145
well why don't you go with that a little bit though, you said, okay, so you say you might not completely understand the mechanism, but you had some reasoning there . 573725_583025
just maybe talk through that a little more detail, wouldn't you say ? 584405_587005
well, my idea is if you have two molecules here and one here and then here's the disk . 587555_594035
you want the disk pushes this one, like these repel each other or whatever . 594815_598775
but if the disc pushes this, it causes them to align like this because it needs a certain amount of energy for that to happen . 598995_605215
so they bond and then I guess that causes a template for the rest of it bond . 605335_611855
I don't really know . 612075_612935
that was what I had written down . 613655_615255
