now the um, the buildings also uh since they are brick and they
we analyzed what's, how's the building doing in this direction &=1
and we measured, our engineers measured the walls and the
particularly in the short direction &=1 . 30754_32845
this direction &=1 is not too bad because you have lots &=2 of
but in the shorter direction &=1, we're deficient .
we have, you know a nice big piece of wall right here &=1 . 39987_45231
but we don't have anything else &=1 until we get over here &=2 .
and there's just a, a piece at either end of this &=1 and that's a
what happens is, the forces at the middle of the building &=1 have
I hope I'm not getting too technical &=1 , but um this is uh, hhh
so what we need to do is we need to add &=1 some other pieces of
and &=1 we have some nice places we can do that in this building . 76324_80847
um in this wall &=1 which is a very thick wall it has some
we're gonna &=1 be able to add some kind of brace frame in this
and this uh dashed line &=1 here represents what we call a
so this becomes one element &=1 of stiffness and it has
