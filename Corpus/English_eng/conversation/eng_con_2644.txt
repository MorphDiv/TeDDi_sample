so that's the frequency of q@l squared . 76675_77335
they wanna know the frequency +//.
in this problem they wanna know the frequency of all of the genotypes . 82815_83055
so <what other> what other &-um of these elements do we need to solve for here Emi ?
if they wanna know the frequency of all the genotypes ? 145385_166465
⌈ two PQ ⌉ .
⌊ homozygous dominant ⌋ .
right two PQ and p@l squared .
so what what are we what piece of information are we missing here in_order_to solve for say two PQ ?
P .
P and how would you find P ?
I don't know .
subtract four from ten thousand ?
well you ⌈ would you would find P ⌉ +/. 167105_175365
+, ⌊ take ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ to get the ⌉ frequency of . 173285_179165
take the square root of that +/. 179165_202185
⌊ the dominant ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ subtract it from one ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and then subtract by one ⌋ to +//.
from one .
⌈ right so ⌉ . 230985_231085
⌊ <and add two> ⌋ .
⌈ but that &~i but ⌉ but then it says that all the frequencies for the different genotypes have to add up to one and then that wouldn't be right because you still have the heterozygous . 231295_261255
well +/.
⌊ no just P and Q ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ I I think ⌉ do they end up +//.
yeah I think they do end up adding to one +/.
+, ⌊ yeah they do ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ remember that there are ⌉ there are two equations .
+, ⌈ for Harvey_Weinberg ⌉ problems there are two equations that you can use . 266605_280565
one of them is &=writes:board P plus Q equals one .
that's the one important equation . 280565_296465
the other important equation is p@l squared plus two PQ plus q@l squared equals one +... 296465_296585
those are the two important equations here .
so what's an easy way what's an easy way to find P in this case Emi +..?
I don't know .
well we decided how we could find Q right ? 313385_318045
yeah but it .
do the square ⌊ root of that and then subtract it from one ⌋ . 316865_327765
⌈ it says that the frequency of all three ⌉ of the different genotypes equal one . 329645_346845
so how could P plus Q equal one ? 349965_371785
because these aren't the frequency of the genotypes these are the frequency of the alleles . 419765_426885
oh .
+, so +/.
+, and if there are only two alleles P and Q or dominant and ⌊ recessive ⌋ . 426885_427005
⌈ but then ⌉ <how could> how could I don't understand how it works because I don't see how how p@l squared could be the frequency of the genotype and the frequency of the allele is just P ? 442145_445645
like .
well okay that goes back to &-um that that &-uh what's that law of +/. 445645_446965
+, ⌈ eh there was ⌉ there was some kinda technical term for it . 447445_470065
that goes back to that idea that you take the &~frequenc if you wanna know the frequency of P and P coming together or the dominant and the dominant allele coming together to make a homozygous dominant individual you &~d you break it up so &=writes:board in this case that would be S and S .
so we wanna know what's the frequency that you would get an S <in this> in this position ? 626545_654405
what's the chance that you would get an S in this position ?
so you figure out <what the> what the chance of that is . 654405_656265
say it it's &-um +... 684165_684245
it's &-uh +...
half .
you have half a chance of getting the dominant allele here . 684245_685645
+, mhm +/.
+, what's the chance that you would get the dominant allele in the second position ? 685645_685745
half .
if there's +//.
yeah &~s let's just +//.
okay so say it's one half .
so the frequency of getting this allele once and getting the same allele again +/. 685765_686225
⌊ right ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ is ⌉ +/. 749685_749785
+, quarter +/.
+, no I I +/.
+, multiplying those together so that is one fourth . 786585_795665
so this is the same thing as saying the frequency of getting a P allele and a P allele again is equal to p@l squared . 810645_816165
+, oh +/.
+, that's where they get that from . 834925_843725
so that's why p@l squared is +//. 843785_844365
that's why P is equal to the square root of p@l squared .
does that make sense ?
yeah .
okay .
so the way that you would find two PQ and p@l squared here we're still missing P we don't know what P is .
the way you would find that is we found out that q@l squared is equal to four out_of ten thousand or &=writes:board +/. 883645_884325
⌊ times ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ what is ⌉ it ?
point zero zero zero four ?
+, yep +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, so how could you now find P ?
take the square +//.
oh I'm sorry .
⌊ are you asking her or &~m or anybody ⌋ ? 909305_909425
⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ you take +//.
⌋ anybody +/.
⌈ take the square root of Q ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ well you take the square root of this number ⌋ and that would equal what ? 946045_946085
Q .
that would equal Q .
and then you do one minus Q to get P .
and then you just square P . 946085_946225
so you would take the square root of this number which is and the &~s square root of q@l squared ⌈ so you will get Q is equal to +//. 998865_1028845
and what does that come out to be ⌉ ? 1109765_1109805
⌊ point <zero zero> zero zero six zero one &~si is it ⌋ ? 1109925_1111185
⌈ point zero zero two ⌉ .
⌊ I think it's just ⌋ point zero two .
point zero zero two .
&=writes:board okay .
so if it's point zero zero two now we know what Q is so we can find P . 1111185_1111245
we can find P by plugging Q into this top equation .
uhuh +/.
+, and then so P is gonna be a pretty big number it's gonna be one minus point zero zero two . 1111245_1111685
it's point zero two . 1111685_1111705
it's point zero two ? 1111705_1111825
yeah &=writing:board .
so if that's point zero two then &-um P would equal what ? 1137465_1157045
point nine .
point nine eight .
point nine (0.7) .
so we will get &=writes:board P minus point zero two is equal to one and we solve for that we get P is equal to point nine eight . 1157045_1158325
so now we know what Q is we know what P is so we can easily find out what two PQ is equal to so two PQ will be equal to two times zero point nine eight times zero point oh two . 1189935_1219455
and p@l squared will be equal to point zero nine eight times point +//. 1244195_1244215
or sorry zero point nine eight times zero point nine eight and q@l squared we solved for over here . 1244215_1244375
does that make sense ?
yeah +/.
okay +/.
+, so okay +/.
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ ?
+, ⌊ is ⌋ is there gonna be one like this on the exam do you think ? 1249635_1270975
&-um I +//.
it ⌈ could it could be ⌉ .
⌊ should should I bring ⌋ a calculator at least ? 1311525_1312745
⌈ xxx <just have> ⌉ .
⌊ yeah &~de ⌋ definitely bring a calculator .
&-um anybody &~y ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ can we do a ⌋ sex linked ?
sex linked ?
&-um I forgot to turn in my &=laughs homework yesterday before I left and I was gonna ask you if if I could turn it in now . 1363025_1369605
yeah ⌈ you can turn it in ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ before we ⌋ keep going &=laughs over it (be)cause . 1369605_1369745
yeah you can turn it in now .
⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ are there gonna be ⌋ like a_lot_of like &-um calculation problems though or is it gonna be like . 1401235_1404495
oh yeah .
there there could be I mean on the last exam there were a_lot but that was you_know that was a different professor so I mean I would assume that there was +//.
there's gonna be at least one . 1428765_1430185
&-um but you know there's different people making it up this time so they might have a different style . 1430185_1437505
can I go see if Doctor_Collin is in his office real quick ? 1437505_1437665
yeah .
okay so (0.12) wanna go through a sex linked problem so let's see . 1445425_1451985
there is (0.5) .
can we do number seventeen ?
seventeen ?
I'm confused xxx .
okay that's a +...
that's a sex linked one but &-uh it's it's sort_of a more complicated one so I I kinda wanna start with a more general sex linked one first . 1473725_1474285
&-um .
what about thirteen ?
yeah thirteen okay so let's look at thirteen . 1500995_1509955
thirteen says that a white eye gene in Drosophila is sex linked . 1536995_1542755
so they're saying that the gene for eye color is sex linked in these flies . 1542755_1544415
right +/.
+, so what that means is that gene is found on the sex chromosomes which is gonna be the X chromosome . 1544415_1544755
+, yeah +/.
+, so +...
the white eyed allele is recessive to the wild type allele for red eyes . 1598345_1603705
so &=writes:board let's make r@l big r@l equal to red eyes and that's dominant they told us +... 1603705_1603865
and so little r@l will equal what color ?
white .
white eyes and &~sec and that's gonna be recessive +... 1631805_1631905
then they say that a white eyed female and a red eyed male are crossed . 1636205_1645585
and they wanna know what are the phenotypes of the offspring gonna be . 1679005_1679325
and then they give you a hint &{l=READING in Drosophila as in humans the male is the heterogametic sex . 1679325_1679705
&}l=READING so the heterogametic sex means that the male has two different sex chromosomes one X and one Y .
and the female is the homogametic sex because she has two x@l-s .
they're the same same ⌈ type of ⌉ . 1700485_1700625
⌊ so does that ⌋ mean that males only hafta have one recessive allele to have the trait ? 1700625_1708545
that means that they'll only have one allele . 1749845_1779265
it might be recessive it might be dominant . 1779285_1779785
so they only need one R to be white ?
yeah they only need one little r@l to be white (be)cause the only only the X is gonna have an allele on it not the Y . 1807145_1814525
yeah .
<is that> is that gonna be &~w that way with all sex links ? 1841485_1869865
they'll specify if it's male .
well they're they're gonna tell you ⌈ which sex is the homogametic sex ⌉ . 1866665_1870145
⌊ well I mean &~i right ⌋ so is it always gonna be carried on the ⌈ homogametic ⌉ . 1870745_1884025
⌊ &~gametic sex ⌋ right the homogametic sex is always gonna have two copies and the heterogametic sex is always ⌈ gonna have one copy ⌉ . 1921805_1922605
⌊ and any sex linked ⌋ trait will be on the homogametic ?
I mean it'll always be on the one there's more of ? 1946665_1947385
&=laughs .
mhm .
&~i right it'll be on the one there's more of that's another way of saying it so +/.
⌈ &~s not all ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ if you have +//.
⌋ hm ?
there's sex linked on Y .
like what ?
there's no +//.
well there's there's few there's a few &-um genes that're on Y like genes that specifically only males have but in most of the problems you're +//. 1990265_1990845
in all of the problems I've ever seen in an intro bio course the sex linked gene means that it's on +//.
that the &~ha homogametic sex has two copies of it and the heterogametic sex has one . 2004245_2032185
so that would make it really obvious if it weren't in a question ? 2032185_2034225
&=laughs .
&~w just assume that if it says sex linked that means that the homogametic sex has two copies and the heterogametic sex has one . 2063845_2069925
okay +/.
+, &-um so it says here that a white eyed female and a red eyed male are crossed so the female is the homogametic sex &=writes:board and the male is +... 2116605_2146505
the heterogametic sex and the female is white eyed right ? 2146505_2146585
the female is white eyed so what am I gonna put here Scott ? 2163325_2163465
+, for the alleles ? 2178745_2208625
little r@l-s on both of (th)em ?
little r@l-s .
and the male is red eyed so what am I gonna put . 2208625_2208725
an upper case allele ?
an upper case R where ?
on the X . 2211285_2214705
on the X right . 2214705_2229465
so when I set up a Punnett square +... 2229465_2240885
and I'll put the male's gametes up here .
what are the male's gametes ?
what what could they potentially have ?
what should I put up here at the top ? 2240925_2241265
a XY .
an X .
XR .
big r@l or he could pass on a Y gamete to make a son .
and the female ?
just two x@l-s with recessive r@l-s . 2291245_2293185
right .
so when I cross these I'm going to get +...
a heterozygous female so <what color> what color eyes is this female gonna have ?
&-uh red .
red .
I'm gonna have +...
another heterozygous female who'll also have red eyes .
I will have +...
the male I can't really say &~heter you know homozygous or heterozygous there's only one trait what color eyes is this male gonna have ?
white .
white .
and then I'm gonna have the other male is also gonna have white eyes . 2379525_2380205
so the male doesn't pass anything on to the the son . 2380225_2380445
not +//.
they don't +//.
well in this case they don't pass the trait for eye color on +/. 2380445_2380605
but +/.
+, because eye color is sex linked .
but &~nor remember we don't just have sex chromosomes we have chromosome one through twenty three also . 2407005_2436345
and so the male is also passing on all the genes that he has on chromosomes one through twenty three so all of the genes on there are getting passed on to the offspring .
but all the sex linked ⌈ the <oh that's right> . 2597025_2614685
okay ⌉ .
⌊ come from the mother in this case ⌋ yeah . 2650145_2669885
okay &-um did did you wanna look at seventeen ?
&-um .
yes . 2679925_2680045
yes &=laughs .
yes ?
okay .
so in number seventeen it says that &=reading it is exceedingly difficult to determine the sex of very young chickens . 2690785_2720765
but it's easy to tell by visual observation whether or not they are barred . 2811075_2812015
so in this case barred just means that they probably have a striped pattern somewhere . 2812015_2813155
so it's really easy to tell whether or not they have that striped pattern but it's hard to tell if they're male or female . 2829375_2859315
so it says that the barred pattern is inherited as sex linked dominant .
so let's make (0.5) &=writes:board B equal barred +...
and it's dominant +...
and little b@l will be not barred (0.5) and that hasta be recessive . 2859315_2859355
so it says set up a cross so that the sex of all chickens can be determined when they hatch . 2910065_2921865
so basically what they're saying here is wouldn't it be nice to be able to tell the sex of a chicken apart by whether or not they were barred ? 2953095_2959575
so wouldn't it be nice if all males were barred and all females were not barred ? 3030145_3030345
or all females were barred and all males were not barred that would be +//. 3030345_3030445
make it a_lot easier to tell the difference between the sexes .
so they want us to set up a cross so that the outcome works out that way .
works out that all the males are one thing and all the females are a different phenotype .
so this is basically trial and error you have to figure out what cross combination is gonna be like this . 3031865_3042445
but they give you a hint and it says &~rem well they &~t they say remember the hint in problem sixteen and the hint in problem sixteen says in birds the male is the homogametic sex and the female is the heterogametic sex . 3042445_3061845
so what is the what's the genotype of of the male ? 3082525_3112505
x@l x@l .
right the genotype of the male +... 3115005_3144905
&=writes:board is gonna be x@l x@l .
and the female is the heterogametic sex for birds so it's gonna be XY . 3191225_3199485
now they want us to set up a cross so that all of the males are one phenotype and all of the females are another phenotype . 3210765_3220205
so +...
&=writes:board <let's try> let's try making the parents the male will be let's see XB +... 3329385_3346505
&=writes:board XB and the female will be X or let's see x@l little BY . 3346505_3346645
let's just see what happens let's see what happens in the outcome . 3353505_3374245
so we'll get a female that's x@l big b@l x@l little b@l we'll get +//. 3374165_3404145
oh I'm sorry that's a male . 3463445_3463485
that's a male .
we'll get another male that's x@l big b@l x@l little b@l .
and we'll get a &~fe we'll get a female that's x@l big BY and another female that's x@l big BY . 3467545_3497525
so did this work out ?
do we have all the males are barred and all the females are not barred ? 3497365_3524965
no .
no .
they're all barred .
all barred .
what are the +//.
right everyone's barred .
the females are barred and the males because barred is dominant they're gonna be barred too . 3557385_3569025
so that doesn't work for us . 3569025_3575025
I have a question like I didn't know that you could just like +//.
I mean I +//.
like to switch like the male has the two x@l chromosomes .
I mean is that just like for these ⌈ chickens ⌉ ? 3599685_3614485
⌊ it's it is <it's dependent upon> ⌋ . 3614485_3615165
⌈ it's a different species ⌉ . 3615165_3617205
⌊ that's just for birds .
that's what the hint ⌋ in sixteen +/.
oh okay .
+, says that in birds the female is the heterogametic sex . 3684175_3684195
⌈ so that means that it's ⌉ .
⌊ okay I don't know if it was just like ⌋ <you were saying> okay .
no I didn't just decide to do that &~i it says that birds in birds this is the way it is . 3684195_3684235
so who can think ⌈ of an ⌉ +/.
⌊ but ⌋ +/.
+, uhuh ?
you don't have actually +//. 3701865_3703525
you don't actually have to like trial and error that much because no matter what if a male is striped all of (th)em are gonna be striped because either way the male will pass on an X to all of (th)em making (th)em all striped . 3703665_3724585
uhuh +/.
+, so you hafta have a recessive male .
you hafta have +//.
okay so Christian is basically good at logic here and and he doesn't hafta do a_lot_of trial and error (be)cause he's logically working it out in his head . 3766385_3796365
I personally am terrible at logic so I would have to do a series of trial and error to figure it out .
but you're saying and this is what you would find out if you were doing it through trial and error that the male hasta be +/.
⌈ <homozygous recessive> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ homozygous recessive ⌋ .
so let's try that and see what it happens and eventually <we would> we would try that combination .
so if &=writes:board <x@l little b@l> x@l little b@l is the male here those are the gametes at the top of our Punnett's square and the female would be what ? 3804465_3834445
XB x@l big b@l .
x@l big b@l +/.
and Y +/.
+, Y .
(be)cause it's the &~heteroga heterogametic sex .
so in the outcome we would get &=writes:board a male that is x@l big b@l little b@l another male that is x@l big b@l little b@l .
a female that is x@l little BY and a female that's x@l little b@l Y .
so in this case these are what the males or females ?
male .
male and they're all barred or +/.
⌈ barred ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ not barred ⌋ ?
they're all barred .
these are the females and they're all not barred . 3855105_3860805
so that that works out . 3860805_3861005
the the only question I would have here is okay sure the children all the females are you know all the females are not barred . 3861005_3872785
but look at the original female the parent female &=writes:board that one was barred .
so that this wouldn't be good for the whole population . 3886825_3916805
<you couldn't go through it> because look this parent right here was barred .
that wouldn't work for the whole population but I guess it satisfies the requirements of the question which asked how could you tell if all the chicks were male or female ? 3946185_3946205
so these are all the chicks here these are all the offspring and we did work out a cross where you could tell .
so I guess that satisfies the requirements of the question .
(0.4) yeah Laurie ?
are we +//.
I have a question about something else if we're +/.
sure +/.
+, &-um for eighteen <we have> &-um we have like &-uh the gray is G and then the recessive is orange but then like irrespective to them &~i like no matter what they are if it has the little allele R it has red feathers . 3946205_3946245
+, uhuh +/.
+, what is that called when something does that ?
like .
that is epistasis . 4025545_4025585
that is &~epista ⌈ so ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ whenever ⌋ you see the terms +/.

I have a question about like the when we were talking about the epistasis +/. 4734525_4764505
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ or whatever ⌋ &-um like I know what it is but how is it gonna affect the problem ?
if we hadta like <I don't> I don't have my book I mean I don't have a book so I don't even know what the problem is but like what's it have to do with that ? 4769985_4792465
&-um how does it gonna affect like the outcome the phenotype that's produced ? 4795325_4807405
⌈ is that what you mean ⌉ ?
⌊ yeah ⌋ or like +//. 4847315_4853755
I mean why is it in like important to like know for the problem ? 4858955_4858975
okay well that would probably be best described by just going through one of these epistasis problems so if you look at &-um number nineteen it says &{l=READING the dominant gene big k@l is necessary for hearing . 4930445_4931085
&}l=READING so big k@l is &=writes:board required for hearing +... 4931085_4931125
and then it says that &{l=READING the dominant gene big m@l results in deafness no matter what other genes are present .
&}l=READING so big m@l &=writes:board results in deafness no matter what other genes are present . 4935165_4964605
so here's a case where you have two genes the K gene and the M gene that are influencing the same trait which is hearing . 4964605_4965145
so the rest of the problem says &{l=READING what proportion of the offspring produced by the cross <little k@l> little k@l big m@l little m@l and big <k@l little> k@l little m@l little m@l will be deaf ?
&}l=READING so they wanna know what proportion of the children from those two parents will be deaf .
and it says assume that there is no linkage . 4993935_4993995
so that just means that M and K are on different chromosomes .
so they will assort independently in cell division .
(0.7) so the parents are &=writing:board oops .
&=writing:board so this is the cross that we're working with here . 5036915_5066895
so on the top we're gonna have +//.
well first of all we have two different genes here so I'm gonna do two separate Punnett squares .
okay ?
I always divide it up in two separate Punnett squares . 5067685_5097625
so what am I gonna put for +//.
let's make this the the K Punnett square dealing with the K stuff what should I put up here ?
&-um big k@l little k@l .
(o)kay big k@l +...
&=writes:board little k@l .
what should I put over here ?
two little k@l-s . 5162795_5162835
right <little k@l> little k@l .
so what I'm gonna get is big k@l little k@l +...
&=writes:board then I'm a gonna get a homozygous recessive a heterozygote and another homozygous recessive .
so what about here ?
let's make this the the M cross so I'm gonna have big m@l little m@l +//.
well actually let's be consistent we'll put this individual up top . 5173095_5182095
so little m@l little m@l and big m@l little m@l .
so our cross +//.
we'll be able to get one heterozygote for this trait . 5188075_5213895
another heterozygote here a dominant +//.
or I'm sorry a homozygous recessive and another homozygous recessive offspring . 5213895_5214015
(0.5) so now we have to decide what are the possible genotypes for the offspring here ?
they're gonna have a M trait and a K trait . 5231265_5260765
so <what are> what are some of the possible genotypes ?
xxx .
yeah .
⌈ well what are they ⌉ ?
⌊ big k@l &~littl ⌋ big k@l little k@l big m@l little m@l .
big k@l little k@l big m@l little m@l .
<little k@l> little k@l big m@l little m@l .
<little k@l> little k@l big m@l little m@l .
and then big <k@l little> k@l little m@l little m@l . 5268705_5298205
big <k@l little> k@l little m@l little m@l .
did we get all the ⌈ &~possibil possible ⌉ ?
⌊ <little k@l> little k@l ⌋ +/.
⌈ you could have both recessive ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ <little m@l> little m@l ⌋ all little .
(0.4) .
okay so now we have all +//. 5298205_5298625
these are the possible genotypes of the offspring . 5298625_5298645
now we need to decide what their phenotypes are gonna be and that's where you need to keep in mind the epistasis that's going on here . 5298645_5298685
because we know if they have a big m@l they are gonna be deaf even if they have two big k@l-s .
it doesn't matter they're still gonna be deaf . 5317505_5347485
even though they have the two +//. 5347425_5377365
even though they have a big k@l little k@l or a big k@l big k@l which means that they have what's required for hearing they're still gonna be deaf because they got a big m@l . 5377365_5377405
so that's gonna affect what the phenotype of the offspring is gonna be . 5386185_5412085
so let's look at this first one it's got a big k@l that's required for hearing so you would think that <it's gonna> &~ha it's gonna have hearing but what's the phenotype for the M gene ?
or for the +//.
yeah for the M gene ?
deaf .
deaf .
deafness .
so because it says that if it has a big m@l it'll be deaf no matter what that's epistasis . 5433415_5463395
the expression of this gene is overriding the expression of the K gene .
and this individual will be deaf . 5525095_5525135
and to figure out what what proportion of the individuals have this genotype how would you figure that out ? 5525095_5554515
they're all quarters because they're all halves .
right so you have to find out what's the chance that it would be a big k@l little k@l well the chance of that is +/.
half and half ⌈ xxx ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ two of ⌋ four so one half times +/. 5556815_5562575
+, one half .
+, right times the chance that it would be big m@l little m@l and that is also one half . 5563795_5586755
so the total probability would be one fourth right ?
mhm .
okay now &~wh what would this individual would they be deaf or not ?
yeah .
they would be deaf because they have a big m@l here so they're automatically +/. 5586755_5586795
mhm +/.
+, automatically deaf .
&=writing:board what about this individual ?
⌈ unknown ⌉ .
⌊ <mhm they> ⌋ can hear .
they what ?
they ⌈ can hear ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ they can ⌋ hear .
because they have the big k@l that's required and they don't have the big m@l so they can hear . 5612085_5612145
and what about this individual ?
⌈ nope ⌉ .
⌊ mhm ⌋ deaf .
they're deaf because they don't have the big k@l and the big k@l is required for hearing . 5658065_5688045
so they're deaf .
so the question asks what proportion of the children would be deaf ?
so you need to figure out what's the proportion &~f of each of these genotypes right ?
<thirty fourths> +/.
+, and then total you need to figure out what's the proportion of children that would be deaf overall .
+, okay +/.
+, and that's whatever it is +//.
thirty fourths is the +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ okay ⌋ .
does that make sense ?
+, mhm +/.
+, okay .
yeah ⌈ Charlie ⌉ ?
⌊ okay ⌋ as much as I like genetics &-um can we go over real quickly &-uh viral reproduction ? 5690535_5694455
viral reproduction sure .
&-um (0.15) so he went through a couple different forms of viral reproduction and I only remember lytic and lysogenic so let me . 5707555_5735075
isn't that like phage reproduction though ?
I don't +//.
phages reproduce ?
yeah phages is just like an infecting agent +/. 5737155_5767135
⌈ <so so> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ it's an ⌋ infecting virus so +/.
+, okay +/.
+, phage is really just another word for virus .
&-um okay so basically the way that he presented this was he talked about different types of viruses .
he said that there's DNA viruses RNA viruses and retroviruses .
&-um and then he talked about some other kinds of infectious agents or you know molecules &-um of genetic material but those were the three types of viruses he talked about . 5779265_5796905
and then he brought up &-um lysogenic cycle +//.
I don't know if he actually used that word did he use the words lysogenic and lytic or is that +/.
+, ⌈ I don't remember ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ just something that came ⌋ up in your reading ?
⌈ he just said xxx ⌉ .
⌊ I ⌋ don't remember that either of them .
okay .
where would he have used that word ?
in the lecture about viruses .
yeah like what part ?
&-um well he talked about how retroviruses in retroviruses that they have RNA for their genetic material .
right +/.
+, and then they take that RNA and they use a particular enzyme which is called what ? 5808765_5820365
retroviruses what's the special ⌈ enzyme they have ⌉ ?
⌊ reverse transcriptase ⌋ .
reverse transcriptase .
and they take that RNA they use reverse transcriptase to convert it into DNA . 5820385_5820465
so we're going from RNA to DNA . 5820465_5820925
and normally we don't do that normally we go from DNA to RNA so you really do need a special enzyme here that's carried by the virus .
so what was that word ?
do you think we'll have to know it ?
reverse ⌈ transcriptase ⌉ .
⌊ reverse ⌋ transcriptase .
the &~lyso . 5847805_5849085
lysogenic and lytic ? 5849085_5852845
yeah .
I don't think it's gonna be important .
okay .
+, ⌊ <do you think it might be> ⌋ on there like &~w which one's lysogenic and which one's lytic ? 5852845_5877205
is ⌈ xxx ⌉ .
⌊ well ⌋ retroviruses +//.
so he said that they take the RNA they convert it into DNA and then that DNA inserts into the chromosome into the +/. 5861565_5891545
⌈ uhuh ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ host ⌋ chromosome .
so whenever you have the infecter DNA inserting into the host DNA whenever you have that happen so +//. 5911405_5941385
I don't have different color chalk .
&-um &=laughs so if this is the host DNA here that's the straight line and then we'll just make the dotted line viral DNA so it inserts right into the host's genome . 5984405_6006185
whenever that happens that is called lysogenic that would be an example of the lysogenic phase of the virus . 6008625_6038045
the lysogenic phase of the virus is when the viral DNA gets incorporated into the host DNA . 6038505_6045785
so would that be the prophage ?
&~pro a &~pro &~pr a prophage is just &-um like something that infects something else . 6045785_6051665
oh +/.
+, so a virus +/.
+, so it's ⌈ just a ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ a virus ⌋ that infects another cell is called a prophage .
so it's just like a generic term ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 6068205_6097745
⌊ it's just ⌋ the generic term .
and for example a virus that specifically infects bacterial cells that's called a bacterial phage .
oh +/.
+, so <it's just> it's just really a general term .
&~wh what where are you looking at that term here in this diagram ?
this little chart .
this diagram .
so a phage DNA inserts into the bacterial chromosome becoming a &~ph prophage . 6097745_6098185
so in in this case they're saying that you call the inserted DNA a prophage .
okay but .
but that's not ⌈ gonna be &~imp ⌉ .
⌊ but it's just ⌋ like a general term ?
yeah it's not gonna be important .
does anybody know if the answers to the practice exam are up on the internet yet ?
I don't know .
I didn't even know that they posted them .
so does that answer your question ?
yeah .
okay yeah and and the other part of that just shows the other part of that diagram that he's looking at shows the &~lysoge or the lytic phase of a cycle and the lytic phase is just basically when something active is going on . 6123325_6125865
active viral production is going on .
so the DNA gets transcribed and you start making more viral proteins and the new virus assembles and exits the cell so that that phage that phase where there's &~act active viral production going on it's not just sitting <in the> &~h in the chromosome dormant there's actually active viral production going on that's called the lytic ⌈ phase ⌉ . 6144995_6174975
⌊ so ⌋ +/.
go ahead .
+, &-um so &-um they're not like two separate cycles it goes from lytic into lysogenic ? 6145725_6175705
⌈ it it can ⌉ .
⌊ well ⌋ it it it can be &~th I mean there's yeah there's different &~variati every virus works differently so maybe it'll stay in the lysogenic phase for a long time and then go into the lytic phase . 6175665_6205085
maybe it never goes into a lysogenic phase the virus just comes in and starts reproducing right away so it only has a lytic phase . 6205105_6205645
so like in the lytic &-um phage the DNA isn't &-uh reproduced like normally it's the +/.
⌈ it's &~reprodu ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ virus would ⌋ be inside it reproducing itself ?
it's &~repro yeah it's reproduced separately from the cell's DNA .
okay so okay that's xxx .
yeah yeah I mean it's only called lysogenic when it actually incorporates +/. 6212745_6215945
when ⌈ xxx ⌉ +/.

⌈ and the only ⌉ and the only time it's copied is like when the cell normally +/. 6215945_6242685

⌈ yeah ⌉ &~i that's like the only way ⌊ it would ⌋ .
⌈ but that's ⌉ the only way it could .
yeah . 6299305_6300585
and then they can go into the lytic cycle and that's when they separate from the DNA and start reproducing and then burst open . 6322145_6329285
right .
yep yeah .
I mean &~o okay I <I wanna> I wanna tell you here that I think that your guys' focus is a little bit off okay you you +//. 6356625_6386565
there were a_lot_of ecological concepts that were brought in and a_lot_of examples he showed . 6393345_6423285
&-um you want to be familiar you want to be able to explain to someone what these ecological concepts are and you know all these different terms that you got .
you wanna be able to explain to someone what do those terms mean ? 6478785_6492145
and what what kind of example can I provide of those types of terms ? 6524345_6553765
and you know you need to understand how the example relates to the term and those types of things and there were a_lot +//. 6553765_6583685
you notice that Hazlett does a_lot_of examples so I I I always say focus on lecture and that's what he focuses on so that's what you should focus on .
⌊ mhm ⌋ ?
⌈ &-um ⌉ well can we go quickly over speciation ?
okay +/.
+, like what it just is in general and that there's like three models . 6583685_6583705
yeah he gave you &-um sort_of different definitions of people's interpretation of what what a species really is . 6583705_6583745
I mean you can't say speciation the definition of speciation is the formation of a new species . 6586025_6616005
so it's really hard to decide if you have the formation of a new species unless you can define what is a species ? 6619835_6632135
what is a species ?
what does that term actually mean ? 6662075_6662115
and he gave &-um different &~def proposed definitions that describe what a different species means .
and the most commonly used definition was the biological species concept that's the one that's usually traditionally taught . 6663255_6693235
and that just means that it's &-um it's a group of individuals so a species is a group of individuals that can mate together and produce offspring . 6696575_6710415
so an interbreeding group of individuals .
that's what a species is +/. 6759355_6789295

normally I point out remember it has +/.
⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.

I didn't know that . 7080425_7080445
&=laughs ⌊ xxx ⌋ .
⌈ &-um ⌉ &=laughs:S5 so &-um then he talked about different +//.
so you know the the species concept you could fight over what what a good definition of a species is and you could make that you could make different arguments . 7080445_7092685
he's not gonna ask you for a rigid definition of a species because it's sort_of still debated . 7113545_7143485

ploidy .
polyploidy &-um (0.7) well I talked about &~autopol autopolyploidy and allopolyploidy is that what you're talking about ?
right .
okay &-um so polyploidy just &~r refers to the general situation of you have too many chromosomes of that type . 7181405_7182985
so polyploidy would be if you have three chromosome twenty ones instead of two chromosome twenty ones . 7183005_7194105
okay +/.

&-um autopolyploidy and allopolyploidy are different sort of situations where that can happen . 7194105_7203245
autopolyploidy refers to &-um the situation where you have an offspring it's got too many chromosomes of a particular type but that offspring resulted from mating between individuals of the same species .
in &~a allopolyploidy you also have offspring with too many chromosomes of a particular type or more than normal but that offspring was the product of different species mating together and producing something new . 7260555_7281195
so that's the difference between those two types of polyploidy .
so he gave the example of a fruit fly where there was an ancestral species of fruit fly and one of the females accidentally laid eggs onto the wrong type of plant . 7291615_7321595
all the other members of that species lay their eggs on a different type of plant and here this one female laid it on the wrong type of plant and it was an apple tree .
and the larvae grew up and they they ate from the apple tree and they did fine and they survived and from then on the members of those offspring started sort_of a new generation that all just lived on apple trees .
&-um <I'm not> I'm not sure if there was like +... 7338695_7343695

+, but <the fact that> the fact that you don't have another species in there mating with this fruit fly tells you that which which situation are we talking about here auto or allo@n ? 7344165_7362085

I'm thinking +//.
okay I think he bounced around in the lecture here and that he all of a sudden went back to sympatric speciation and that was an example of sympatric speciation . 7461485_7463805
does that make sense ?

because now there're two populations and if you took the new individuals that breed on apple trees and the other individuals you couldn't breed them together . 7463805_7464165
anymore .

no well that that's what I was thinking because the example was there . 7504805_7504825
but something like that would happen .
something would have to happen +//.
because now remember these these apple tree &-um they're they're totally in a separate environment they depend on apple trees they're not gonna go back over to the other type of trees . 7532165_7554885
wouldn't ⌊ that be ⌋ +/. 7581145_7581265

well let's +//.
okay so now he's asking if that's an example of peripatric speciation (be)cause . 7595025_7603645
or never mind just go ahead with what you were gonna say . 7603645_7612545
okay &-um so the reason why they don't breed together anymore is because they use different resources now . 7612545_7612685
so these ones aren't interested in breeding with the flies that mate on another tree because &-um they're used to mating on these type of trees and unless another accident happened like the original female that accidentally breeded in the wrong environment unless another accident happened which would be rare these fruit flies now all +//. 7636185_7666165
they grew up on these trees they're used to these trees that's where they're gonna stay is on the apple trees . 7680805_7710785
so ultimately what could happen what could happen +//.
that doesn't mean that if you put them back together again that they couldn't breed just because they like being in different places . 7710725_7740145
⌊ so the ones that ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ that doesn't mean ⌉ that .
so so how do you get a different species out_of this situation then ?
if &~th +/.
+, ⌊ yeah ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ if that's ⌉ the case how do you get different species ? 7800015_7800075
well what happens is these +//. 7805385_7807365
&~e everybody is always constantly going through evolutions we're always +/. 7808605_7834645

+, ⌈ we're always ⌉ getting new mutations .
that wouldn't be an example of polyploidy then right ? 7834705_7835265
no no I just thought that it was because it it was +/. 7872005_7901945
⌊ okay ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ right ⌉ there in the notes .
but &-um so how would you get two new species out_of this ?
just because they prefer a different environment doesn't mean that they couldn't interbreed . 7908385_7938365
well the way that you get a new species out_of this is because now these individuals are used to their territory they like their territory and they only interbreed with each_other .
so if a mutation happens in one of the individuals that you know gives a new version of an allele that will only be passed on on that population that that breeds with each_other and likes apple trees . 7999525_8029505
that population is not gonna get passed on to that other population that's on nonapple trees . 8073285_8103265
okay it's not gonna get passed on over there . 8130825_8130865
so you can see that because of the separate habitats that they prefer they're now on they're own individual evolution pathways .
and eventually these pathways could lead in like different directions where evolution &-um in the apple tree species like eventually changed their genetic makeup so much that if you put them back with the other species whose &~invol evolving totally differently (be)cause they're only breeding with each_other . 8146465_8167045
and they may not get the same mutations now if you put them back together after a long time of differential evolution . 8167045_8167065
now they can't breed together anymore .
because they've evolved different alleles from only breeding with themselves .
does that make sense ?
so <they got> they got separated they prefer different habitats and now they only interbred with each_other and they independently evolve into different +/. 8167065_8176345
+, ⌊ but ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ types ⌉ of species .
wouldn't that be like &~cladogene &~genis genesis instead of speciation really ? 8202185_8232165
or would they be the same +/.

cladogenesis cladogenesis is +/.
⌊ it's just xxx ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ like a it's a more ⌉ general it's a more general term where you evolve a a whole new clade . 8251585_8281565
so a clade is like a branch in the tree of life you know you keep seeing like &=writes:board trees like this +...
+, yeah +/.
+, so <a clade> a clade might be &=writes:board this could be a clade this could be a clade it's all different levels of looking at things . 8289385_8319365
so &-um for &~e &~a but <the general> the general definition of a clade is all of the individuals are related because the have a &~suitin certain unique characteristic that they have in common . 8319325_8349305
that's one thing .
they have a unique characteristic that they all have in common . 8364945_8394925
and the other thing is that they come from the same common ancestor .
those are the two definitions of a clade .
so how does this work when I say well this is a clade and this is a clade ? 8424205_8424245
that works because these two may have a unique trait in common with each_other that they don't share with this one .
okay ?
so they have <a unique> a unique trait and only two of these have them . 8426245_8443885
so that satisfies the one requirement the other requirement is that they come from the same common ancestor . 8443885_8456225
and that's what these branching points are that branching point right there represents a common ancestor .
so this satisfies the definition of a clade . 8492205_8522185
if you look at this on a bigger scale on a larger scale you could also say well okay this is also a clade here because all of these individuals share a different trait okay it's not the same trait that these individuals share there's some other different trait that all of these guys they all have in common . 8525675_8547915
this different trait . 8564135_8569735
so we satisfy that requirement and they all came from this common ancestor right ? 8569735_8570815
this is the common ancestor that includes all of these individuals . 8570875_8574455
this common ancestor only includes <this one> this one and this one .
it doesn't include the ones that are over here . 8602555_8602975
it doesn't include this part of the branch that branched off earlier .
so do you see what I'm saying ? 8613845_8622685
there's different levels of organization you can look at . 8622705_8626205
just like there's different &~of levels of organization you can look at in humans you can look at the &-um you can look at the cellular level you can look at the organ level you can you know the tissue level you can look at the organ level you can look at the whole physical being level . 8641605_8671585
it's the same idea you're just looking at it at different levels . 8716225_8746205
so if I asked you (0.4) is &=writes:board this a clade ? 8746165_8776145
+, no +/.

no why not +..?
because I haven't included the common ancestor of these two .
but they still have a common ancestor though .
they have a common ancestor but they don't include all of the organisms a &~f and and a whole clade hasta include all of the organisms that have that common ancestor .
so what what +//.
they have a common ancestor it's right here but it doesn't include all of the organisms it's not a full clade it's not a whole clade why not ? 8804445_8805045
what's missing ?
+, well who's &~ma who +//.
how could we make this a full clade ?
by including that point ?
by including well if I included that point I still haven't done it because I don't have all of the individuals that were derived from this common ⌊ ancestor ⌋ . 8838505_8868485

where your left finger is .
it would be here . 9092005_9092625
right .
