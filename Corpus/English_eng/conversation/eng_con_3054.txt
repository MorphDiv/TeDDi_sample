copy . 150_390
strip on graph . 2050_2710
can you explain the double class since he wasn't . 3940_6870
here . 6980_7070
yeah . 7910_8150
I didn't see that . 8320_8950
see we're making strip quilts . 9220_11390
and first what we had to do is we had to make these things . 11500_15380
first we need you this wall . 16329_18790
I did . 20360_20590
and I didn't Nathan but look at mine . 20940_25710
now look at all that is this . 25940_29170
and that Nathan I had that last time . 30360_32850
so you got that totally wrong . 33730_35750
how is it supposed to go like this . 36620_38260
how &-um how should how do you think it should go . 39860_42740
Teddy . 42810_43140
I got it . 44400_44830
I got one of mine all done . 44960_47100
and that's this is how it went . 47820_49700
Teddy . 50370_50620
uhhuh . 50730_51030
on yours . 61020_61620
I need to going like that this . 62480_66220
where . 67010_67110
Teddy like this . 67570_68380
Teddy . 68490_68660
I see is that does that match . 69890_72220
&-uh Teddy if if you made it let see how you do . 72550_75500
if you made it like this . 75700_77350
Teddy that would be wouldn't even be making that one then you
Teddy it doesn't go like this . 83400_84860
it doesn't here it I copied it Teddy and it was like this petty . 85940_94820
Jay what do you think . 97610_98230
are you making the same designs this trip . 103940_106460
mhm . 107340_107540
yeah . 107910_107980
how did you &-uh tell me a little more . 108440_109780
Nathan about how this code . 109800_111380
you made &-um you guys make the same . 112670_114260
first we made &-um one of these and the core . 114520_117420
core . 117830_118070
square . 118120_118420
yeah . 118590_118740
the core square . 118760_119420
then what we had to do was &-um that was the first day we had to
and the first day . 124500_125190
okay that . 125870_126380
and then we had to make &-um it like this . 126420_129030
then we had to make them on these . 129669_131230
we had to keep on making them like this . 131820_133860
is this the same . 134740_135380
like this . 135470_135910
yeah . 136120_136300
this is the same as this . 136530_137620
mhm . 137660_138060
and &-um . 138260_138900
can you explain . 139140_139630
better what you did . 139680_140790
there . 140840_142080
&-um . 141500_141670
we made six of these things . 142130_144700
&-um yeah what . 145100_146720
what are they . 147510_147740
what are these . 147950_148440
&-um . 148780_148860
core squares . 150110_150780
uhhuh . 150960_151040
six core squares . 151740_152660
then we had to make patterns for up here to put them on graph page
how did you make the patterns for . 158420_159900
&-uh flipping them and stuff . 161050_162300
can you explain each of them what you had do between . 162750_165420
the square . 165440_166310
see . 167540_167610
so I'm gonna have to make it over like that . 169220_176260
Nathan &-um let's see . 178070_179910
Nathan just leave it like that . 180680_182030
'cause I already got that going . 182630_183900
and he on me <over and over and> over and over again . 185350_188290
okay . 188710_188980
Teddy I'm . 189000_189860
trying to explain to us . 190580_191390
what what . 191540_192020
&-uh no you can . 192040_192740
how you made that . 192780_193300
what I am doing maybe . 193690_194740
you can explain it on your . 194800_196310
drawing . 197150_197430
yeah . 198200_198340
where where's the first core square here . 198520_200310
&-um that was just the copy core . 200770_202430
this is the copy core . 202830_203820
yeah . 204120_204260
it's just where you leave it like that . 204350_206030
it's just . 207300_207610
where leave it like that . 207810_208990
&-um then &-um . 209490_210980
then . 212350_212500
I I think I just booked it sideways like this . 212720_218060
goes . 220740_220830
so where is that on here . 221060_222100
that's right there . 223360_224100
oh . 224420_224590
this is . 224640_224990
see this one has to go . 226420_228420
so what did you do . 228580_229270
what did you exactly . 229460_230260
you can't really show because he needs his . 232180_234220
oh . 235260_235400
see then I &-um see this one would've been this one right in here .
okay . 247190_247420
and &-um then &-um . 247980_250420
&-um . 254220_254390
<and then> and then . 256860_257779
I just &-um . 258760_259420
so how how <so you> so you had the four square . 260620_263980
and then what did you do to get this one . 264020_265420
&-uh let's see . 266580_267380
I &-um just flipped it over like this . 267680_269820
okay . 269990_270100
okay . 270440_270540
and then . 270740_271150
&-um I'm trying to see this is how that is right . 271340_278240
like this . 281390_282860
yeah . 283450_283590
then I clicked it over like this . 283640_285380
so it matches this one right there . 286700_290220
and then all I did was I made it like this . 291060_294510
what is that . 295110_295500
what is what . 295520_295790
is this that you did there . 296120_297060
I just . 297800_297970
like I just turned . 298080_299910
it . 300100_300260
left &-um one fourth . 301670_303300
and &-um then for this one &-um . 304420_309340
let's see . 309850_310340
then I &-um I flipped it sideways . 311510_315180
and I turned it left one fourth . 315420_317780
and then for this one I just copied the core . 318740_320660
okay . 321320_321480
that's a copy of the core . 321560_322480
could you . 322770_323150
do do that . 323320_323780
again . 323960_324190
ask . 324420_324620
can . 324780_324980
oh can I ask you something . 325090_325900
because &-uh once you say you copy cord . 325920_329070
and then you said you &-uh flipped the cord . 329540_332320
yes . 332860_332890
for the second one . 333140_334070
I flipped it over . 334640_335580
and from here from the second to the third you said that you turned
&-um . 341140_341240
I &-um actually flipped it and . 342990_345390
then . 345440_345630
like this I flipped it . 346990_348980
and then I turned it . 349820_350820
but did you flip . 351220_351950
did you turn the four now or did you turn the one that . 352340_355520
second position . 357120_357780
I was turning the core . 358920_359900
oh . 360540_360590
you went back to the core . 360760_361830
so I went like this . 362140_363260
then I &-um then I turned like . 363700_366330
then I &-um then I turned it . 366550_369340
what did you have . 371190_371670
yeah . 371840_371920
that's what you you turned this one to that one . 372000_375110
but with what would you have done have to have . 375620_377740
I would've had to . 382920_383830
&-um . 384020_384140
yeah . 384830_384890
how would you have gotten if you didn't do this one . 385140_386990
first went . 388000_389050
from here to here . 389160_390020
what would you had to do . 390310_391260
here to here . 393350_393790
from the first to the third . 394680_395430
so there's the course . 398220_399030
so that one then I . 400020_401110
went . 401210_401350
probably down the same . 402480_403350
okay . 405350_405500
so what is that . 405600_406190
&-um how . 407380_407640
did you do that . 408280_408610
so I flipped it sideways . 409180_411030
flipped it sideways . 411450_412270
then I turned it &-um &-uh right one four . 412590_416890
turn it right . 420350_420850
I think . 421600_421820
okay . 421950_422190
uhhuh . 422840_422930
let's see . 423660_423900
yeah . 425070_425150
I said that . 425680_426180
okay . 426590_426860
so which one was easier to go from the four to this one or to go
which one . 434490_434770
to go from the second position . 437570_438670
uhhuh . 438810_438870
how_come that's easier . 439260_440020
because . 440590_440780
&-um I made it up it . 440970_442580
it was easier to &-um do that because &-um . 443420_446700
&-um . 447980_448150
I think about that . 452000_452670
I can't think of it . 461840_462620
can you remember what you did in each place . 465410_468030
&-um . 469700_469850
from here I just &-um I just flipped it over for like this . 470910_475700
okay . 475950_476140
then . 476310_476530
all I had to do then is I just had to do it again and then turn it
okay . 483260_483350
so . 484180_484350
actually . 488400_488740
me change my mind . 488580_489470
about what's easier . 494010_494710
yeah . 495380_495500
is that what you huh . 495600_496710
why did it seem easier then to go from the core square that time .
I think . 501960_502130
so &-uh . 502510_503110
uhhuh . 503530_503590
so how did you get from &-uh how did you get this this one . 506180_510380
then we . 510400_511900
we . 512020_512080
showed showed the third one . 512240_513419
this one I &-um . 514070_515419
let's see . 515870_516190
I just must I have it the way I did . 516960_519780
so . 519940_520070
I okay . 520120_520549
just turned it left one fourth . 520789_522640
left . 523419_523630
one fourth . 523750_524150
okay . 524470_524740
and then . 525300_525670
I probably &-um turned it one fourth then flipped it up . 526920_531390
oh now that time you showed . 531870_532990
this . 534260_534420
one you . 534720_535460
showed it from here left . 534740_535670
one fourth from here . 535780_536780
right . 537140_537260
yeah . 537590_537740
but then <from this> from this one to this one was it turned .
I I &-um from here I turned it one fourth . 543400_547100
then I flipped it . 548190_549160
so then I got it . 550430_551310
oh from here you turned it one fourth and flipped it to get that .
yeah . 555200_555350
and then I just have to copy the form . 556260_558290
and that's the copy form . 558500_559310
is that the same pattern for each strip . 560000_561660
then &-um . 561710_562400
no . 563020_563190
this one was &-um that one just was . 563750_567260
