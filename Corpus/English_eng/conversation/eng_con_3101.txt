if you thought about this as a strip or would the same as this one
no . 3420_3480
you said the same pan or for . 3980_5420
exactly . 5550_5980
but because these aren't facing the same way . 6940_9110
if these are facing the same way then it would be exactly . 9580_12110
okay . 12990_13230
so really from where Justin is sitting . 13280_14650
these are kind of &-um <house right> house right house up house
and here this would be <house left> house left house up house
so really this can you find a place in the quilt that this same
where does that be . 31230_32110
the same row . 32460_33650
what . 33720_33980
yep . 37140_37310
that one right there does goes right right up down . 37360_40930
that's right . 41900_42270
<and this one> and this one . 42500_43860
yep . 43940_44110
right right every . 44320_45300
other actually it's also pattern and the strip because . 45410_48930
mhm . 55580_55700
very good . 56500_56940
I would say . 57330_57660
you're ready to glue it down . 57680_58640
you . 137740_137800
change it . 138020_138380
what_if I turn this to the right . 138680_140700
what's gonna happen . 141090_141630
okay . 141870_141970
Sarah is this designed symmetric . 142350_144260
not so . 145340_145700
what_if I turn it . 145720_146230
okay . 146310_146550
you don't think it long a sideways look . 146730_148700
because there's pink right here and there go right there . 149090_151390
and you can turn it over pink . 151440_152940
and blue . 153140_153580
and because this even_though that would go . 156380_159540
mhm . 160420_160760
that that pink . 162750_164270
diamond in the middle . 165910_166570
don't look . 167050_167420
so if you . 167660_167940
did a line of symmetry here . 168160_169340
it wouldn't quite work there for this one either . 169360_171540
mhm . 171560_171730
&-um . 172330_172450
what do you like about this . 173270_174260
well . 175510_175620
it has lots_of design . 176500_177870
what you mean by . 179230_179750
it's sort of like to pan goes like purple . 180070_184060
purple . 184080_184450
the next . 184420_184600
time you plan a co so that your coat . 184680_187260
will turn d purple cake . 187360_189020
orange . 189810_189940
I mean sort of whatever . 191160_192180
how many times you . 193940_194510
so you've got these &-um diamonds here . 194950_197220
butterfly . 199590_200150
every time . 200800_201060
you it's another one . 201080_202340
whatever that is . 204880_205340
half a fill . 206720_207260
and and a butterfly and half a fill . 207300_208880
it's very cool . 210880_211190
core . 213230_213380
square . 214560_214910
what . 214950_215110
you noticed . 215440_215820
could you just hang on one minute . 216660_217830
&-um can you get . 218220_219720
that back that . 219800_220420
Foursquare I need you to print it in . 220450_222750
course . 222860_223230
regular letters that we . 223550_224750
have I was gonna say . 224800_225580
can I ask you this . 226910_227620
question right . 227880_228870
would you get canceled with maybe it didn't get can save it but
what have you noticed about using a_lot_of triangles like this when
course squares . 241740_242590
well I know that . 243910_245110
like . 247350_247590
why do you do that instead_of just squares . 247640_249460
you know . 249860_250100
because squares you could only use four square . 250120_254290
uhhuh . 254850_255010
and you can with eight triangles . 255260_257190
uhhuh . 257579_257700
and so why is having eight triangles a_lot_of times better . 258320_260870
happen in four squares different . 261700_263050
because you can have different colors and more colors . 263490_266110
because you can only have four different colors . 266350_268900
and you can have eight different . 269580_270820
but you only used four different colors here right . 271460_273740
one three . 274140_275310
okay . 276820_277030
but why would using eight triangles would four different colors be
here you gotta click on . 283990_284870
okay . 284990_285230
to this message . 285280_285710
first I mean . 285760_286460
if color was the only thing that . 286520_287540
mattered . 287710_287940
wouldn't wouldn't you just use . 288640_290750
trying you can make a near design . 291660_293940
trying to . 294020_294600
neither design . 294970_295540
it looks like that mirror . 297300_299830
and it's going if you go like turn like this . 300260_302900
looks like to . 303260_305510
hanging . 306430_306780
up there and this way it's . 307170_308470
so do you mean when you turn these and . 311060_312540
flip these and things when . 312720_313670
you combine them . 313780_314430
there's more more weight . 315030_317700
more things that can . 317890_318750
fit or I don't . 319060_320920
think I quite understand . 321810_322910
can you show me an example . 323170_323940
like do a turn for me or flip . 324070_326300
and show me what you . 326320_327260
mean &-um . 327320_328740
oh my god . 330080_330510
turn . 330910_331180
yeah . 331880_331950
and I'll turn it . 332420_333230
yeah . 335020_335130
see . 335700_335830
and it makes sort of a designer . 336480_337930
then turn it . 338990_339570
and . 341490_341580
sort of . 342060_342330
and what happens when you put them together . 343150_344340
well when you put (th)em together it looks like two bowls a bowl .
this is a bowl right there . 352270_353860
oh . 354460_354490
this . 354680_355140
and this is . 355500_356040
a bowl right there . 356160_356780
okay . 357780_357950
thank you . 358040_358260
sir . 358450_358570
gonna say this . 358650_359210
okay . 359590_359830
how you doing . 360940_361340
bud . 361380_361550
good . 362230_362350
what are you making here . 363030_363900
by Core Square . 365820_367340
you're making a core square . 367790_368740
you . 371300_371390
notice that you're using a_lot_of triangles . 371520_373750
Brian what's your idea . 373800_376230
it's . 376470_376660
gonna all gonna be triangles . 376760_377820
they're . 377840_377960
gonna be all triangles . 378120_378900
how_come you're gonna make a core square with all triangles . 379380_383240
because I think it looks neat with all triangles it . 384130_387230
looks neat with all triangles . 387280_388460
and . 389720_389830
why is that . 389940_390500
because . 390830_391010
now if I wanted to make it with squares I couldn't make it with
and that's why I took one of these off . 397960_399620
uhhuh . 399690_399780
yeah . 400500_400630
so you . 401990_402350
could make squares if you wanted to . 402400_403630
but you've decided to make tri . 404060_405390
uhhuh . 406040_406150
how many different colors are you gonna use . 406660_407990
two . 409140_409310
two . 410060_410160
okay . 410550_410740
I could use different class this . 411880_413620
is your first finish school . 413640_414420
you finished syrup . 414440_414820
but you decided . 415060_415580
you needed two . 415600_415970
what's your idea behind that . 416560_417820
like . 419300_419430
what do you mean . 419480_420220
well I mean like &-um you decided to use Blue and yellow . 420710_424980
I was wondering if you tell me what you're thinking about what
blue and yellow . 430060_430590
yeah . 432270_432470
so it'd be it started out like that would be . 432620_439360
uhhuh . 440440_440650
up here . 441020_441420
it just started out with . 441640_442380
so you are after that striped effect . 442540_444420
is that what I just saw . 444850_445700
you move that there . 445850_446420
yeah . 446870_447010
let see if I can . 447750_448390
so you do that . 448910_449470
oh lemme . 451060_451790
see . 452420_452500
so that's how you're gonna build . 455190_456350
do you like using the computer . 459070_460060
here . 460150_460390
yeah . 461180_461240
what do you like about it . 461530_462180
I dunno . 463360_463780
is it easier than . 467830_468580
no . 471090_471230
it's just the same as . 471280_472430
as . 472960_473060
using the paper and pencil . 473080_473850
not as easy as using paper . 475810_478150
so you like . 478540_478940
paper and pencil . 478960_479420
little . 479520_479750
easily . 479800_479990
oh so now you turned it . 480940_486290
yeah . 487630_487740
because if you look at it from this way it kind of looks like
uhhuh . 492100_492220
<a lightning> a lightning . 492640_494150
&-uh two by two . 494380_495350
wow . 496900_496990
did you find a core square that looks different when you turn it
good job . 501880_502100
sir . 504860_504950
I know you just saved it . 505080_505900
but could you go up here &-um for a second and show me the first
can you open up quote one . 510240_511370
oh yeah . 511890_512260
save no . 512570_513030
save this first as quilt two . 513080_514220
right . 514240_514419
so you can come back to it . 514520_515350
&-um I know it's just in progress . 516130_517490
but save it as quote two . 517809_519110
but I'd like to see quote one 'cause I didn't get to see it . 519500_521419
just . 523190_523429
make just experiment . 523480_524420
just made . 524510_524900
to . 525040_525190
&-um okay . 525240_525900
do you think it matters . 529420_530220
if you turn it to the right or to the left . 530300_532020
do you get the same thing . 532220_533140
no . 535420_535480
no . 535860_535920
oh now you're gonna flip that one . 540060_541240
can't make . 542030_542260
no . 542540_542700
I I'm just showing you . 543120_544310
okay . 545110_545350
but now can Ann now that'll that saved just little too . 545400_548020
can you open up the file and one the printer . 548040_551340
there we go . 551410_551880
great . 553280_553470
yep . 555900_556070
push . 556200_556340
okay . 556430_556700
that's the one you wanna open . 556720_557630
mhm . 557860_558200
so then it kind of looks like something like a maze . 559850_563310
kind of be open . 563500_565270
do you think that's a sense . 566660_567340
