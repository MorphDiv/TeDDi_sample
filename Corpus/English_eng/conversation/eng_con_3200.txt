alright . 0_796
um why don't you explain reliability ? 796_3885
and give an example of a measure that might be reliable ? 3885_9540
and tell me why it would be reliable ? 9540_11476
okay like I said before reliability is ah a measure that can be
<ummhmm> . 43740_45954
so something that would be um +... 45954_50443
well with blood pressure, what changes is your blood pressure not
yeah, okay . 57411_59002
okay use IQ test as an example . 59002_62302
I was thinking about the IQ test but you know I have a thing about
ummhmm . 65986_66730
I mean not that I'm a scientist but um I guess that could be
I was gonna say sometimes they're not valid because you know they
ummhmm . 80907_82573
that the kids live in and you know how ambiguous the test can be
so I don't know how accurate IQ is but that's a measure so that's
so you're saying it's reliable . 101058_102058
it's a reliable measure but it's not necessarily a valid measure . 102058_104817
okay, yeah . 104817_105898
I can agree with that . 105898_107098
alright . 107098_108026
alright, let's talk about um well we already talked about face
we don't need it . 114463_115188
explain to me the difference between face and construct validity . 115188_120542
okay the face validity is um what the measure appears what the
ummhmm . 133051_133786
okay . 133786_134210
your um experiment if it's um measuring what it's suppose to . 134210_139250
um I like what you said about <the REM> the REM sleep . 139250_145157
you know the eye movement, you can see that their eyes are moving
ah whereas construct validity is when is the underlying measure . 153082_160811
ummhmm . 160811_161322
you're measuring what's really going on . 161322_162938
right . 162938_163290
yeah . 163290_163794
okay, um explain using an example, how reactivity might affect
yeah, ah sometimes I think that if you know that you gotta ah okay
ummhmm . 192619_192906
it's gonna be higher . 192906_194250
you know and you're reacting to you know the snake but I think what
right . 207684_208106
so applied to blood pressure . 208106_209618
right . 209618_210221
you might be nervous about getting <your blood pressure> . 210221_212199
<right> nervous . 212199_213542
ah, what somebody else said in the class, which is interesting, if
that would all be an example . 224610_226018
ummhmm . 226018_226802
alright, how might reactivity affect test taking ability ? 226802_230786
oh yeah . 230786_234011
ah probably in the same way um if you know that ah your gonna ah le
ah you'd have to get an A on this final, you're gonna be so nervous
probably not because you didn't read the material but because
ummhmm . 255331_255598
okay, that'd work . 255598_256931
and ah I'm gonna describe a a phobia study and and think about how
okay . 263357_264108
I'm this experimenter and <I've> I've developed this great way
snake phobia . 270260_271788
so I ah I give them this little lecture to teach them how to get
and the first day I want to measure how close he gets to the snake
so then then he goes and gets s little more training . 301580_304715
the next day he gets six feet he can't do anymore . 304715_307017
the next day two feet and then a week later he's holding the snake .
oh, okay . 311024_312304
okay, how might reactivity play a role in that ? 312304_317872
ah your's ? 317872_319448
the subjects . 319448_320983
the subjects . 320983_321319
well um I would say that each day that he got a little bit
if that snake would have come after him I don't think he would've
well picture that the experimenter is standing right next to the
well if that's the case, if the experimenter is standing right
he's not afraid of the snake . 372271_373287
the snake hasn't harmed him so it's given him the encouragement to
okay, and maybe he doesn't want to disappoint the experimenter . 378321_380543
okay . 380543_381490
yeah . 381490_382023
you know the experimenter is putting in all of this time and he
but ah . 386451_387235
well yeah that's happening to me . 387235_392275
um, I'm doing an applied study from a different university you know
ummhmm . 398875_399323
and um my advisor and the director of the applied study program
so the pressure's on ! 414497_416524
so I'm reacting more to if they come here I'm definitely going to
you know if they do that for me, you know . 424305_425834
ummhmm where did you come from ? 425834_426606
ah, Springfield, Illinois . 426606_428407
so it makes a difference . 428407_431815
not that I would want less than that or I've ever wanted less than
ummhmm . 436944_437566
I've never had to sweat it . 437566_439095
like this, doing it for another reason than for just my own, you
ummhmm . 443342_443966
good personal example . 443966_445456
ummhmm . 445456_445926
okay . 445926_447191
umm let's do let's do another example of ah . 447191_451593
do a ah negative linear relationship on the board with ah with
see if you can come up with something . 467476_470531
say that again . 470531_471483
umm, draw a ah just a . 471483_474352
this ? 474352_474787
yeah . 474787_475356
okay . 475356_475819
and we'll label this age . 475819_479404
oh age okay . 479404_480971
and ah draw a negative linear relationship and explain how . 480971_485907
okay . 485907_487084
okay age with what ? 487084_491067
say this is ah starting with ten years old going to ninety years
okay . 496377_497056
ten to ninety . 497056_499974
sure . 499974_500432
okay and um what's over here ? 500432_505696
that's what I want you to do . 505696_507185
oh you want me to do oh okay let's say age and ah balding ? 507185_511624
okay, amount of hair ? 511624_513576
ummhmm . 513576_514040
ah how do you do that ? 514040_522919
xxx ! 522919_528022
you xxx increments of one hairs, two hairs, three hairs . 528022_530550
let's see age and umm . 530550_534108
well that was fine what you had . 534108_538222
well I didn't know how I want to put it over here . 538222_540958
amount of hair, let's see ah years, right ? 540958_546343
ummhmm . 546343_546756
this is age and nah . 546756_548645
no I though what you had was fine . 548645_552583
xxx age and um um and you want a pos ? 552583_558100
negative linear relationship . 558100_559550
negative Okay this is is bald, balding and this one is a full
actually there is sometimes age doesn't have anything to do
and um ten years you have a full head of hair . 580391_594025
ummhumm . 594025_595103
old ten years you have a full head of hair and ah +... 595103_605302
maybe I shouldn't have started at ten, maybe I should have started
forty ah: ninety seventy sixty eighty, okay . 608203_622986
at fifty let's say you aren't quite so bald . 622986_628770
sixty seventy eighty ninety . 628770_643183
okay, that's fine . 643183_646127
and how about um a curvilinear relationship ? 646127_653195
like the one you had, you can just use the one you had there . 653195_657099
oh, okay . 657099_657903
and come up with something you could label it that would explain
okay . 663719_665479
hormone levels . 665479_668862
hormone female hormones . 668862_676902
they're the one's that fluctuate like that . 676902_680398
ummhmm . 680398_680806
and let's say at age um five, age ten, age let's see twenty,
fine . 701545_702777
okay ? 702777_703363
that looks fine . 703363_704880
okay, um give me an example of something that would be ah a nominal
something that would be an example of a nominal scale . 712654_716505
ummhmm . 716505_716824
okay . 716824_718481
or a nominal variable I should say . 718481_721765
a nominal variable . 721765_723887
how bout um male female ? 723887_730072
perfect . 730072_730871
that was a rough one . 730871_734179
and an example of an interval scale . 734179_737034
an example of an interval scale . 737034_739615
and why it would be an interval scale ? 739615_741139
okay, I'll try to think of a good one for you this time . 741139_747723
okay . 747723_748274
an interval scale Test grades . 748274_753616
th that's good . 753616_755367
and ah it would be interval because ah your testing ah test scores .
ummhmm . 762239_762707
um let's say fifty students xxx . 762707_766327
you'd group it according to how many scored a certain amount of you
ummhmm . 774716_775206
you're saying ummhmm xxx . 775206_777970
that's good ! 777970_778586
that's fine . 778586_780265
okay . 780265_780864
you know as long as you're not saying a percent correct . 780864_783136
no, not percent correct . 783136_785027
cause that, but just like a test score . 785027_786516
test scores . 786516_787226
yeah . 787226_787650
well, I don't really have anything else to ask you . 787650_793625
do you have any question about any of the material ? 793625_794986
no, I think I already asked them . 794986_798440
yeah, it's all pretty straight forward . 798440_799897
aha . 799897_800412
I though . 800412_801114
it will probably get a little more tricky, a little more
I'll probably read over the ah the ah scales so I can put on the
ummhmm . 817780_818131
you know, I know what I'm saying but to put it into the words . 818131_820803
yeah . 820803_821162
you know that he may want to hear on the test . 821162_823765
yeah . 823765_824266
he'll want to hear the word reference point . 824266_825986
that's right so you know I might want to you know review that . 825986_829114
I think you'll do fine . 829114_830737
you can grasp all of this . 830737_832407
yeah, it's you know I don't mind it ah mind it or anything like
it seems like that I didn't think I'd like behavioral research . 839536_843954
ummhmm . 843954_844522
but you know I think it's a little xxx that I thought it was goin
