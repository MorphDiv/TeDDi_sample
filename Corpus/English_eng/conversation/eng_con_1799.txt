<um> an elephant is playing with a giraffe .
and she (i)s bouncing the ball with her trunk .
but then <the ball> <they see a> the ball goes into the
and the giraffe goes and tries to catch it .
but the elephant looks really worried .
and then they catch the ball .
and they (a)re both really happy .
and then she hugs the ball .
<and the> and <the um> the giraffe looks really really
and so does the girl .
<um> the elephant and the giraffe again .
<they> they see a sign that says no running .
well, it says no running .
but I do n(o)t think they see it .
and they (a)re looking into the water .
but then the elephant starts running .
and she does n(o)t see the sign .
but then it (i)s really slippery .
and she falls .
<and she> and her friend ran right past her .
and he did n(o)t see her .
and then he saw her .
and she scraped her knee .
so he went and got the lifeguard .
and now she (i)s crying holding her knee .
so he put cream .
and then he put a bandaid on it .
and then <th> she tried to walk over to the bench .
but she could n(o)t .
so they hadta kind of help her .
and then she sat down looking kind of embarrassed
the end .
the giraffe <he> he has <a airplane and> like a toy
and the elephant sees it .
and she (i)s like oh cool cool <can you> can you fly it !
so he (i)s like well I (wi)ll try it .
and so he twirls it and twirls it .
and he (i)s trying to make it fly .
and the elephant (i)s like that (i)s
and then <she> instead of asking she just snatches from him .
and then he looks really mad at her .
but she looks happy .
and then <she> she (i)s trying to fly it .
but she drops it in the water .
so he get super mad .
and she looks really scared .
and he goes !
and then the lifeguard comes and looks .
and they (a)re both really scared .
they (a)re on the other side of the pool .
and then <the> the elephant looks and looks .
<the elephant> the girl elephant says oh I (a)m really really
I just accidentally did this blah blah blah !
and the lifeguard says well that (i)s okay I guess .
so then he tries to reach it .
<and> but he can n(o)t reach yet, not yet .
so it (i)s stuck in there now .
and the giraffe starts crying .
but then a girl elephant like I think it (i)s the little girl
and she has a net .
so then she <s> grabs the plane and<um> scoops it
and then he (i)s really happy .
and so is the girl .
the end .
okay there (i)s two rabbits .
<one> the girl <is named> is Amanda .
and the boy's name is mark .
and they are at the beach .
and they decide to build a sandcastle !
but then <mark he> they build it .
and then mark he takes it .
and he just dumps all the sand over top of it .
so now all they have is just a big clump of <snow>
and then Amanda starts crying !
the end I think .
there (i)s <um> an elephant and a rabbit .
and they (a)re each carrying picnic baskets .
and they meet each_other out in the woods .
<and so they de> and they decide to have a picnic !
but then the rabbit he (i)s like ah this stuff is so good !
<and the mon> and <the monkey> the
like there (i)s like a big really big cake .
and he (i)s like ah I love junk food !
<while the other> well the elephant is like well he (i)s just
so then the elephant is eating a nice sandwich and drinking
but the rabbit he just shoves all this stuff and just leaves it
and then he (i)s patting his big fat tummy because he ate too
but then he feels really dizzy .
and it looks like he (i)s going to get sick .
but then he faints .
so just out_of the blue comes a doctor .
and the elephant says doctor doctor my friend over there ate
so she just pulls him right over there .
and the guy (i)s still <fainted> like really dizzy .
and there (i)s still a mess .
<so he (i)s like> so the doctor checks its throat and
and he finally wakes up .
and the doctor (i)s like oh you should n(o)t eat so much junk food
but then they take a little walk just to make sure he is okay
the end .
there (i)s an elephant named Jennifer .
and there (i)s a rabbit the same one who ate too much junk food
<named> let (u)s call him john .
and the girl named Jennifer <has a little balloon> has a wagon
and there (i)s a balloon tied to it !
and <the> john is like well what (i)s that balloon for ?
and Jennifer explains well I (a)m not sure yet &=laughs .
so then he (i)s like well why do n(o)t we rip it off and throw
and it can like drift up to heaven and stuff .
and the birds can you know eat it .
and <she (i)s like> no no no said Jennifer !
he (i)s like well I (wi)ll try and undo it still .
while she went away he tried to undo it .
and then he let it go on purpose !
and he (i)s like oh Jennifer Jennifer !
he lied to Jennifer .
he (i)s like Jennifer Jennifer <the> <um the> the balloon
and Jennifer (i)s like oh_man it drifted away !
that was my favorite balloon !
so then <she (i)s gets> she (i)s like <you did that> you
and she gets all mad .
like oh I (a)m just going to hurt you !
so then a guy comes along with some more balloons .
and they get an idea .
well John gets an idea .
but Jennifer is too mad to even notice .
john (i)s like hi mister can I have some balloons !
and Jennifer (i)s like huh what the heck is he doing ?
so then he gets out <um> ten cents .
<um> and <the> <the um> <the>
if you do n(o)t have five cents you can n(o)t have a balloon .
<so the guy (i)s like> so then the guy (i)s like hm you can
and the both of the people are like please please please said john
so then <um> the doctor came along .
<and he (i)s like> and then john runs up to him and says
and the balloons are only for five .
he won't give us no balloons .
so then the doctor has two five centses .
so she gives it to them .
and they get two balloons .
and then they hug (th)em and squeeze (th)em and everything .
but they do n(o)t pop yet .
the end
