you would wanna know who who fired the shots first . 105_1985
all right . 2545_2645
I wanna bring it back . 3005_3705
gimme your attention . 3865_4445
five four three . 4665_5545
turn it off in two . 5805_6625
and one I've heard a bunch of different discussions going on . 7465_11005
I want to . 11145_11825
and you guys were making some annotations . 12025_13645
so I'm not gonna annotate on mine . 14085_15425
but I wanna go back and and look into the document and discuss the different things that I've been hearing from you guys . 15565_20845
he says . 21505_22025
I can say as clearly as possible that under no circumstances will we have any further dealings with the Amalgamated Association as an organization . 22565_30625
this is final did that . 31385_33925
Matt what do you think it . 35725_36645
sounded like he was like really like . 36885_39825
mad .
it sounds like he is very mad . 41445_42905
and what else does it sound like . 43125_44085
&-um he sounded it sounded like he was still upset . 44365_47425
still upset . 47685_48385
so the so still a bit emotional . 49105_51105
Amanda He . 51525_51885
sounded like stern . 52345_53185
stern . 53645_54145
and who usually sounds stern . 54385_56045
bless you . 56445_60145
any like mean people . 60485_62825
mean people or stern . 63165_64665
yeah . 65005_65245
he's not the best person . 65505_67645
and if Andrew . 67945_69305
I was just gonna add on like military officers you know to discipline soldiers . 70085_73785
so I've heard a military officer would be stern authorities authorities . 74105_78085
so he is speaking . 78485_79305
bless you again . 79545_80225
he is speaking in terms of the tone of this . 80725_83285
it seems that he is speaking with authority . 83465_84985
right . 85305_85345
have any of your parents ever said to you . 85705_87425
do not come to me . 87565_88105
this is final . 88205_88845
how many of you have ever heard that <from a parent> from a parent . 89405_91325
I've heard . 91525_92305
don't ask . 92425_92785
again don't ask again . 93125_94285
synonymous four . 94445_96405
(be)cause .
this is final all right . 96625_98745
the workmen in the Amalgamated Association work under what is known as a sliding scale as the price of steel rises . 99225_106485
the earnings of the men also rise as the prices fall . 107185_110705
their wages also fall . 111125_112205
the wages are not allowed to fall between below a certain amount which is called the minimum until now . 112645_119465
the minimum has been twenty five dollars per ton of steel produced . 119585_123065
we have recently changed the minimum to twenty three dollars instead_of twenty five . 123585_128225
so is at an increase or decrease . 128745_130725
friends . 130985_131005
what's that . 131145_131405
decrease .
so we've got a decrease . 132305_133125
yep . 133385_133605
I'm telling you we've changed the minimum . 133765_135525
we've decreased it by two dollars . 135745_137085
we believe this is reasonable because the Carnegie Company has spent a_lot_of money on new machinery that allows workers to increase their daily output and therefore increase their earnings . 139665_151625
does that sound reasonable to you . 152325_153505
yeah .
yeah .
I have given you brand-new machines . 155125_156705
you can now be more efficient . 157645_159925
be more productive . 160245_160925
and you can make more tons of steel that gives you the opportunity to make more money . 161245_165165
are you the only one that's making more money . 165945_168805
no .
who else is . 170225_170965
company . 171525_171985
Henry . 172585_172825
Frick Henry Frick and Carnegie the company . 172945_175065
all right .
&-um the Amalgamated Association was unwilling to consider a minimum below twenty four dollars even_though the improved machinery would enable workers to earn more . 175385_186725
we found it impossible to arrive at any agreement with the Amalgamated association . 187265_192845
so we decided to close our works at Homestead the Amalgamated men surrounded our property and blocked all of the entrances and all roads leading to Homestead we felt that for the safety of our property it was necessary for us to hire our own guards to assist the sheriff . 193225_210405
I'll get to you . 211465_211825
in a second . 211905_212125
we brought our guards here as quietly as possible . 212585_215465
had them taken to homestead at an hour of the night . 216125_218725
when we hope to have them enter without any interference whatever and without meeting anybody all of our efforts were to prevent the possibilities of a confrontation between the Amalgamated Association and our guards . 218955_231435
we have investigated and learned that the Amalgamated men and their friends fired on our guards for twenty five minutes before they reached our property . 232055_240755
and then again after they had reached our property our guards did not return fire until after the boats had touched the shore . 241145_249245
and after three of our guards had been wounded one fatally all right . 249725_255825
give it to me . 256125_256445
Kum .
&-uh one of the things that that screams out to me biased is that it says . 256605_260725
we felt . 261045_261565
we felt keep going . 262105_263565
if we read the whole sentence . 263965_265025
please we felt . 265305_265905
that safety is a priority . 266185_268485
if <of our> of our property . 268585_270465
okay .
so what does that . 271925_273045
why does that scream out to you because . 273205_274925
<it says that> it says that they felt that's their opinion if they would . 275165_280265
because they said that they would just want to come in there with just people just so they can get in . 280545_287465
there .
okay . 288125_288265
would've . 288325_288805
been that would've just said something . 289005_292265
and according . 292985_293545
they wanted to try to say it to say that they didn't want any intentions to do with any problems . 294035_299335
they wanted it to be the way it was . 299555_301455
they wanted it to be peaceful . 301555_302595
and put it down peaceful . 303115_304075
so Callum has pointed out that . 304415_306015
wait a minute . 306115_306295
Frick is saying . 306495_307075
here we didn't do this because we wanted confrontation . 307395_309575
we are doing this to try and do it as peacefully as possible . 309915_312555
yes . 313195_313435
how many of you agree with Callum yep . 313935_316075
according to Frick they were not trying to be confrontational . 316135_319275
he was purely trying to protect the property . 319435_320995
protect the the employees . 321045_323005
what do we think . 323585_323985
yes or no . 324345_324785
Amanda . 325585_325765
well I was gonna say . 327005_329125
well me and Anna were thinking this earlier . 329845_332105
how like they were the factory like as quiet as possible as_if they were like planning something like . 332665_340805
I think there's more to it . 341025_342885
so they are saying . 342965_345685
well wait a minute . 345825_346185
yeah . 346705_346845
he says that . 346945_347645
but he why why the need to come in in the middle of the night that led them to think that way . 347985_355085
there's something something fishy going on . 355605_357765
do you agree with that . 358625_359365
I .
do believe . 359905_360145
I do agree . 360445_360725
you do agree with that . 360785_361725
and . 362165_362225
I was trying to say that it is a bias . 362325_364105
so I didn't fully believe what he was . 364565_366545
saying so that it was . 366825_367685
more of a bias than a true . 367905_369665
fact than a true fact . 369965_370945
okay . 371265_371445
Anna and me . 371785_372765
and Amanda also false that says . 372905_375725
&-um all our efforts were to prevent possibil possibilities of a . 375945_380325
confrontation . 380565_380805
okay .
so like they're trying not to get near . 381945_386025
they're trying to sneak in . 386285_388425
mhm .
but why would they do that . 389245_390485
do they know something's gonna happen . 390625_392225
do they know . 392445_393045
are they anticipating that something is going to happen . 393165_396065
yeah . 396345_396465
Craig well . 396845_397765
to be honest though I think that &-uh Henry Brick is actually trying to make himself look like he's not really a monster . 397805_407225
and he's act . 407905_408345
and he's actually trying to make it look like the employees . 408505_411665
and the Amalgamation Amalgamated Association is the bad for when in reality . 412485_418985
what_if the Amalgamated Association wasn't even doing anything at . 419325_423065
all they weren't doing anything wrong . 423325_424725
yeah . 425205_425285
well if they weren't doing anything wrong . 425245_426765
what_if .
and Henry Brick is just accusing him . 427185_429505
so then he can make himself threaten . 429605_431205
does anybody think Henry Fricks just accusing him trying in an effort to make himself look better . 431705_436845
potentially . 437225_438145
mhm .
what do you think . 438825_439505
Matt you had your hand up . 439605_440525
then Trevor then Steven . 440745_442225
I'm thinking that &-um in paragraph two it says that we believe that this is reasonable because the Carnegie Company spent a_lot_of money on new . 442945_452225
machinery . 452565_452605
yes . 453005_453165
because like he's not really saying like the Emma Passage said that . 453555_458915
he just decreased didn't say about . 459255_461295
how giving them . 461895_462515
okay . 463055_463115
yeah . 463915_463955
so is that a good thing or a bad thing in your opinion . 464435_467235
well . 467835_467935
I sort of think it's like in the middle . 468095_469295
you think it's in the middle . 469615_470455
anybody agree . 470915_472075
yep . 472215_472355
this is it's not necessarily good . 472515_473615
it's not necessarily bad . 473715_474295
there's it's kind of in the middle . 474735_476835
Trevor . 477535_478315
I was gonna say that . 478735_479835
in this document . 480095_480915
&-um . 481345_481465
it says that . 481805_482385
the in this document . 482685_483305
we're back at Frick yeah yes . 483505_485185
and that in this document it says that the association started the fire . 485645_490745
but in the first document it says that the . 491125_494145
did . 494465_494605
okay . 495345_495585
so we have two different accounts . 495965_497305
and then if we throw in the timeline the third saying shots were fired . 497705_500925
and we don't know who started those . 501025_502765
&-um I want to point out that they fired the association . 503705_509445
fired for twenty five minutes but only hit three men . 509765_512365
why is why do you wanna point that out . 513045_514285
because it's probably exaggerated that it was twenty five minutes . 515465_518665
twenty five minutes of shooting . 518685_520605
and they hit <three people> three people . 520925_524725
they're good . 525165_525765
wait . 526885_527265
Lena you're like they're good . 527545_528585
are you being sarcastic . 528705_529545
yeah I'm serious . 529625_530245
okay . 530505_530805
you scared me . 531465_532205
all right . 533125_533265
Mickey . 533865_534925
so it also like it also said that they surrounded it . 535325_539425
so <if they> if they were shooting for twenty five minutes it's not really possible for them to only have hit three . 539585_545665
people .
three people . 546565_547025
I only have a couple of minutes with you . 547425_549105
and we'll talk about this more on on Monday before the quiz . 549245_551825
but what I what we were trying to get at through both of these documents is why did it turn violent . 552225_557085
can you walk out_of here and tell me one hundred percent <it turned> it turned violent because_of this . 558185_563845
no no . 564665_565505
no .
why can you not tell me that . 565805_567645
Mickey . 568545_568605
because one says . 569225_570825
you don't know who shot it . 571085_572225
and then the other two say different . 572365_573765
people blame the others . 574345_575345
what would you want to know . 575845_577345
if I were to try and determine exactly why it turned violent . 577945_580925
what other information would I need . 581265_582705
&-uh who shot first . 583345_584285
so we would want <a definite> a definite is what I'm hearing . 584545_588145
you say . 588365_588605
Matt what do you think . 589185_589665
honey .
thinking like it was really only three people killed when they were . 590385_595145
shooting .
were there only three people killed . 595745_596925
in twenty five minutes . 597045_597845
you would wanna know more info on that . 598065_599405
what would you wanna know . 599825_600565
&-um . 600785_601125
did Rorick . 601365_602225
or any machines . 602765_603965
<were there> were there new machines . 604705_606525
actually bought . 606525_607405
yeah . 607905_608125
or did he just keep the money for . 608305_609865
himself . 610065_610325
so that would influence your way of of thinking . 610625_613325
I would wanna know if it was actually twenty five minutes . 615305_617985
if they really shot for twenty minutes twenty five minutes or was it all right . 618505_621385
let's take a poll . 621785_622505
do any of you believe that the Emma Goldman document is more reliable than the Henry Frick one . 622965_628585
give me a poll . 628705_629425
if you think that the Emma Emma Goldman document is more reliable . 629645_632365
raise your hand if you think that the Henry Frick document is more reliable . 632365_638785
no .
and Craig I hear you saying . 640605_642865
no .
why are you saying . 643985_645005
no . 645325_645545
he actually Kevin himself . 646325_650365
he's probably really mad . 650865_651905
he's on one side . 652085_653285
he's on one the two sides . 653705_655305
he's probably on the side of his own . 655525_656985
and if he association he's probably against that . 657585_662365
he's probably not gonna let his guard down . 662545_664265
he's probably gonna over exaggerate . 664385_665965
I probably make them look bad . 666125_667565
so do you by saying that are you saying that the Emma Goldman document is more reliable . 668025_671765
well to be honest I really don't know . 672445_674825
cause the Emma Goldman document is actually just not really that reliable . 675365_680705
and the brick one isn't . 680965_682505
so are we leaving more confused than when we came in . 691185_693605
yes we are . 694105_695405
yes .
I didn't know . 696145_696805
he confused us . 697005_697945
we were confident we were walking out this door thinking . 697965_701405
yeah I got this down . 701705_702485
and then we got a little more confused . 702765_704385
Amanda . 704625_705825
starting you . 706525_707685
all hold on . 707985_708705
you're starting to agree with whom . 709005_710025
&-um Craig with Craig ooh . 710225_712645
because why . 713805_714925
I . 715785_716685
mean I say my opinion and not true the facts . 717645_721405
and if . 721925_722305
he and he has done like way worse things than I have . 722685_727185
so I mean it's probably so easy for him to say . 727865_730785
&-um not to fast . 731485_732425
and then &-um I's &-um &-um passage was &-um wasn't really that cause it was such a long time after it happened . 733305_746685
so I don't really know which one . 747385_750245
if I could give you one more document you have an opportunity on Monday to come in and see one more document . 750705_758705
what type of document would help you clarify . 759385_761065
what perspective would help you clarify . 762315_765155
Matt what what perspective would help you . 766275_767695
a . 767775_767875
perspective of . 768475_768835
a worker . 769055_769275
of a worker . 769715_770595

themselves . 867005_868165
