well, let us take a look . 70280_73960
&=breath remove this unit from the map . 70280_73960
but I'm seeing barrier there . 71280_76950
I'm seeing geographical barrier right there . 71280_76950
well, <he is> he is sitting sort of on top of this range . 77060_88250

uh@fp let us see . 200250_215020
we can take a look at the mobility blobs . 200250_215020
<this should take> this'll take a little while, unfortunately
