(..) The Constitution . 857280_858740
(..) which is a living document . 858740_860450
The Constitution . 860450_861410
right ? 861410_861850
&=in That is very much the document that protects 861850_864320
Our democracy and so forth . 867540_869250
(..) Well 869250_869870
(..) Two . 905760_907230
(..) major currents 907230_908640
And what is political culture . 913900_915330
(..) I'll get back to that concept . 915330_916880
But just general terms . 916880_917910
What is political culture . 917910_919340
(..) What is political culture . 919340_927600
(..) Alright . 927600_929990
I want you to think +/. 929990_930890
Put that concept down 930890_931830
you're gonna hear about it in the next few minutes . 932270_933830
It's very important that you understand that concept . 933830_935400
Political culture . 935400_936170
&=in But I want +/. 936170_937200
Thing I want to underline here 937200_939180
we're products of what ? 947700_949040
(..) A cultural process 949040_950730
(..) Whatever American means . 952950_954060
Alright ? 954060_954480
(..) So those two major ingredients 954480_957400
(..) &=in But before we get into that s- substance of that 974320_978230
(..) And we don't participate in many organizations in great numbers . 989310_992450
&=in The fact is 992450_994090
(..) I don't care if you're African-American 1013970_1016170
(..) Most Americans 1020630_1022190
(..) So 1025170_1026360
(..) Introducing the subject matter here . 1027590_1029500
(..) Americans 1029500_1031060
(..) Alright ? 1040420_1041970
I mean 1041970_1042770
(..) Of those that are eligible to vote . 1052130_1054820
(..) we're lucky if we get fifty percent . 1054820_1057210
(..) Are we less democratic ? 1057210_1060320
(..) Are they more democratic ? 1060320_1061750
(..) Why is it that Italy has 1061750_1063950
(..) Or Germany . 1067880_1070000
(..) Or even Canada . 1070000_1071540
Seventy percent . 1071540_1072500
(..) The fact is 1072500_1074340
(..) I want you to put that down . 1077430_1080760
(..) Cause it's gonna be important . 1080760_1082270
(..) At least for my analysis . 1082270_1083310
I don't want you to agree 1083310_1084110
One week to think about it . 1086960_1088210
(..) American democracy is dying . 1088210_1092010
(..) I want you to put that (..) who:le phrase in black and
&=in American democracy is dying 1097780_1100690
As we get into the discussion of Chicano (..) participation . 1104120_1107750
(..) And we'll get back to that statement next week . 1107750_1110290
(..) So 1110290_1112160
(..) That's another point I wanna underscore . 1114730_1116730
(..) Because if the larger general population doesn't vote in
&=in we've been talking about 1133310_1134690
(..) &=in Now 1142590_1143750
(..) influencing voting 1151180_1152480
(..) Are many . 1153440_1156020
(..) Civic Culture 1156020_1160280
(..) But all I want to do 1177070_1178470
(..) of what are the factors that influence 1180840_1183330
&=in And there are essentially five . 1186200_1187910
You can probably develop more 1187910_1189510
(..) Most of the literature in political science 1191180_1194570
(..) What does that mean . 1201600_1202380
A sense of duty . 1202380_1203560
(..) They regard participation as important . 1203560_1207310
(..) Now 1207310_1209990
(..) Now this is a very somewhat altruistic 1214780_1217470
right ? 1218580_1219020
(..) A sense of duty ? 1219020_1220730
(..) Why . 1220730_1223890
(..) Why would you say 1223890_1226120
Some ⌈ people that vote ⌉ . 1227890_1229010
⌊ &=COUGH &=COUGH ⌋ . 1228220_1229010

(..) Why . 1231650_1234010
(..) Right here . 1234010_1237240
(..) I don't know 1237240_1240360
(..) Because without you: 1255180_1256520

As we go through some of these 1261940_1263680

Alright 1272270_1272660
(..) One 1278180_1280630
(..) Alright ? 1281490_1282360

Two 1284530_1285200
(..) I mean 1286840_1288690
(..) &=in So in essence 1306110_1307310
that we've discussed already . 1310230_1311370
(..) Yes ? 1311370_1311940
(..) I think that it's more (..) eye opening 1311940_1316540
And that's why people don't vote . 1320930_1322630
&=in It seems that 1322630_1323670
(..) That's why I don't vote . 1328260_1329470
It's not (..) my responsibility . 1329470_1332190
That's why I don't vote . 1332190_1333420
(..) There's not a sense of duty . 1333420_1334820
Even though 1334820_1335680
Why do you suppose that has changed . 1340230_1341830
