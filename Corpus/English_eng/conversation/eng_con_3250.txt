very very happy ? 0_2446
teacher, teacher +... 2446_3623
we want to switch seats . 3623_5096
okay, okay . 5096_7191
shh . 7191_7638
stand up please . 7638_8993
good morning class . 8993_12846
good morning, Mister Chan . 12846_17031
Miss Tam, okay . 17031_20213
returned this for you . 20213_24031
okay, we will start a new chapter today . 24031_34615
0 . 34615_60078
on the blackboard, there are two different equations . 60078_62628
okay ? 62628_63588
two different equations . 63588_64875
it is the equation in x@l, one unknown only . 64875_68540
therefore, I think that you are familiar with this . 68540_72955
I want two of you, okay, to come out and find the solution for these two equations . 72955_80603
any ? 80603_82148
none of you ? 82148_85578
&=laughs . 85578_86931
I think that you will like to come out today . 86931_90003
Kwan Chi Chung, please . 90003_92058
this one . 92058_92978
okay, another beautiful girl, right ? 92978_97618
Chow Suk Fun . 97618_98288
yes . 98288_99643
okay . 99643_101471
you try to use what you have learned in equations to find the value for x@l . 101471_108738
okay ? 108738_109855
&=laughs . 109855_140078
some of you laughed, it means that you find some mistakes, which one ? 140078_146243
equation one or equation two ? 146243_147995
two . 147995_149613
two ? 149613_150085
Yeung Cho Yee . 150085_150731
you try to correct this . 150731_152875
equation two you found some mistakes . 152875_157213
really ? 157213_166481
&=laughs . 166481_169106
&=laughs . 169106_169948
okay, it should not be four x@l . 169948_171783
two x@l on the right_hand side, to the left_hand side, it should be minus two x@l . 171783_178373
okay ? 178373_179163
therefore, left_hand side is zero . 179163_180701
and ten, positive ten on the left_hand side, right_hand side ? 180701_184981
negative ten, okay ? 184981_188181
therefore, ten minus ten, it is zero . 188181_190026
okay, this, too . 190026_192501
for the first one, you found that the solution is x@l equals two . 192501_197675
what does it mean ? 197675_199123
x equals two . 199123_201731
if I say that x@l equals two is the solution, what does it mean ? 201731_208530
what does it mean ? 208530_212346
it means, when x@l equals two, left_hand side will equal right_hand side . 212346_223858
let's check it . 223858_225475
okay, when x@l equals two, what is the left_hand side ? 225475_235806
it is two x@l plus four, okay ? 235806_238111
two x@l plus four . 238111_239086
two, x@l, plus four, what's the result ? 239086_246390
eight . 246390_248128
eight . 248128_248328
eight . 248328_249046
all right ? 249046_251240
and for the right_hand side, it is x@l plus six . 251240_257911
x, we found that x@l equals two . 257911_265646
therefore, it is eight again . 265646_267495
are they the same ? 267495_268390
yes . 268390_269798
okay ? 269798_270653
x@l equals two, then left_hand side right equals right_hand side . 270653_274516
that is the solution for equation one . 274516_277480
yes . 277480_279711
how about the others ? 279711_280535
Lau Wai Fung, give me one more number for x@l, other than two . 280535_291398
any one ? 291398_293415
try to use three . 293415_295945
three . 295945_296351
okay . 296351_296905
let's substitute x@l equals three . 296905_303303
okay ? 303303_304158
in equation one . 304158_305448
another value for x@l . 305448_307565
the left_hand side, two x@l plus four . 307565_316088
this time, x@l equals three . 316088_317855
what's the value for the left_hand side ? 317855_321638
ten . 321638_323191
you will find that it is ten . 323191_324758
but for the right_hand side, x@l plus six, x@l plus six . 324758_334021
nine . 334021_335788
nine . 335788_336341
all right ? 336341_338588
they are not equal . 338588_339773
therefore, we will not say that x@l equals three is a solution . 339773_344908
the solution is x@l equals two . 344908_348556
all right ? 348556_350085
of course, you can test for the others . 350085_352513
okay, how about equation two, I get zero equals zero, what does it mean ? 352513_357176
do you think that there is no solution ? 357176_363945
there is no solution . 363945_367898
any one of you say that there is no solution ? 367898_370736
I can't find x@l, therefore, no solution . 370736_373193
no ? 373193_374848
then what will be the solution ? 374848_376936
anything . 376936_378720
sorry ? 378720_380200
anything . 380200_382688
what do you mean by anything ? 382688_384545
any number . 384545_387163
any number . 387163_387581
okay . 387581_388028
let's check it . 388028_388573
we have two and three, okay ? 388573_392651
let's try this two firstly . 392651_394426
when x@l equals two . 394426_401421
left_hand side, right_hand side . 401421_406435
I try to compare these two when x@l equals two . 406435_410900
left_hand side is two x@l plus ten . 410900_413121
two x@l plus ten . 413121_416595
answer ? 416595_418275
fourteen . 418275_420546
fourteen . 420546_421180
right_hand side ? 421180_424385
two x@l plus five . 424385_428305
two plus five . 428305_430496
it is ? 430496_433835
fourteen . 433835_435251
fourteen again . 435251_436186
seven times two . 436186_437650
are the two sides equal ? 437650_441858
yes . 441858_443560
yes . 443560_443908
left_hand side equals right_hand side, therefore, even if I can't find the solution, in fact, two, itself, is one of the solutions . 443908_452130
how about three ? 452130_453271
when x@l equals three . 453271_461901
of course, both the left_hand side and right_hand side, the values will be changed . 461901_468983
okay ? 468983_470030
on the left_hand side, it is two x@l plus ten . 470030_474165
and on the right_hand side, it is two x@l plus five . 474165_482901
for the left_hand side, it is ? 482901_486040
sixteen . 486040_487356
sixteen . 487356_487870
six plus ten . 487870_490880
but for the right_hand side ? 490880_491820
sixteen . 491820_493263
it is also sixteen . 493263_494853
this time it is two times eight, is it equal ? 494853_499028
yes . 499028_499830
yes, the left_hand side is still equal to the right_hand side . 499830_502966
not no solution, in fact, at least we have found two . 502966_509105
okay ? 509105_511131
more than one . 511131_512708
how many ? 512708_515860
from the book, you still have three trials, try to test whether these three are the solutions or not . 515860_524786
page one four four . 524786_526466
page one four four . 526466_530146
in fact, the equation listed is the equation two . 530146_533700
okay ? 533700_534411
two x@l plus ten equals two brackets, x@l plus five . 534411_538731
test for the other three solutions of x@l . 538731_542373
part one, part two and part three . 542373_544596
x@l equals zero, x@l equals negative one and also x@l equals negative one over two . 544596_550568
zero, negative integer and negative fraction . 550568_554411
test for the left_hand side and right_hand side, okay ? 554411_557356
