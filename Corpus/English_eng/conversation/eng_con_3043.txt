++ top strip the middle strip and the bottom strip . 0_3408
so everyone understands which one we're talking about ? 3408_5740
Teddy which of those strips was made by (..) just keeping the core
+^ the second . 13088_13675
yep the one in the middle . 13675_15791
okay ? 15791_16556
so Teddy said we could do that with a core square but we might not
why might we not want to do that Teddy ? 22041_26138
is there something different about the top strip and the bottom
Kelly we're looking at the back board now . 32351_34231
what was done differently to make the top strip Teddy ? 34231_39436
we talked about these yesterday . 39436_48910
Teddy does the top strip use the same core square ? 48910_51910
mmm no . 51910_54858
well it does . 54858_56640
yeah it does but it's not the same strip is it ? 56640_59151
how did they get a different strip from the same core square ? 59151_64596
okay that core square is exactly like the core square that you use
yours is even exactly the same colors . 77430_80195
so think about the top strip that was made from a core square just
how did they make it ? 85656_87808
+< they're all the same core squares . 87808_88973
they're all the same core squares but . 88973_90540
not the same strips . 90641_92640
right not the same strips . 92640_94141
and <I'm gonna > I'm asking Teddy to talk to us
(be)cause Teddy's already pointed out to you and I hope you can see
that in the middle strip they just kept the core square in the same
take it apart with your eyes and look for six core squares that are
you should be able to see them in the middle strip . 118563_121723
but now turn your eyes to the top strip the one that says quilt
Teddy how was that one made ? 128823_131540
if you were gonna make a strip exactly like the top
thank you for giving Teddy quiet time to think . 159840_171315
<what would you do> how many core squares would you need ? 171315_175961
+< xxx left . 175961_176516
um just a second . 176516_177895
first how many core squares would you need Teddy ? 177895_179810
you need six . 179810_181991
six . 181991_182408
okay . 182408_182778
and in the first one would would you do with it ? 182778_185188
first you make a copy of it .185188_193130
okay did you hear Teddy he gets kind of quiet listen he said first
so the first one he's just keep it in its original position . 198195_200911
then what would you do with it next ? 200911_203843
would you copy it again Teddy ? 203843_205740
<you turn it> you turn it left one fourth . 205740_210853
turn it left one fourth . 210853_213203
look at the core square by itself if you need to or the <limits>
is Teddy right <would that> give him the arrangement that
yes . 223850_224050
yes . 224050_224338
yes . 224338_224570
yes he is . 224570_224836
what would you +/. 224836_225303
sideways flip . 225303_226083
or a sideways flip Kelly says . 226083_228048
Teddy what do you think ? 228048_229095
if you did a sideways flip on the core square would it also give
yeah . 233610_234158
okay . 234158_234923
what would you do next Teddy ? 234923_236240
so far you've copied your core and you've taken the core and turned
what would you do next ? 240771_242418
copy the core . 242418_243610
and then what would you do ? 243610_244916
turn it left one fourth . 244916_251043
turn it left one fourth and then what would you do ? 251043_253126
then you copy the core . 253126_259475
then you copy the core and ? 259475_260810
turn it left one fourth . 260810_262408
okay and would your strip be done ? 262408_264138
yes . 264138_266808
yeah . 266808_267418
would you have a finished strip quilt ? 267418_269365
no . 269365_270461
no . 270461_271045
+^ <what would you need> what would you need to make more of it if you wanted to ?
+^ five . 274290_274625
+< we'll need to have (..) six strips . 274625_283740
six strips in all . 283740_285385
so right . 285385_285771
so we'll need five more strips . 285771_288316
hmm so Teddy is that top strip different from that middle strip ? 288316_292810
yes . 292810_294060
yes but what's the same about it ? 294060_297008
they have copy cores . 297008_300750
okay they both have places where the core was just copied okay . 300750_306748
who can talk to me about how that bottom strip was made ? 306748_309995
the one at the bottom . 309995_311913
<copy core> copy core . 311913_315906
Teddy already pointed out that you begin by just copying the core .
that's interesting . 319118_319703
who can +/? 319703_320271
all those just keep <copying xxx> . 320271_321803
<do they> ? 321803_322218
+< no . 322218_322771
bottom one . 322771_323351
a diagonal flip how about another movement in case not everyone
Brittany what are you thinking ? 328398_329308
um I'm thinking um that all you gotta do is um try up down flip and
tell me about your combinations of flips again ? 337206_339938
up down flip and then a sideways flip . 339938_342638
look at the core square that Brittany began with and imagine that .
visualize first an up down flip so that the &~tr green triangle
+, which corner ? 358961_359738
<upper> um upper right &=head:shake +/. 359738_363836
you did +//. 363836_364816
upper left . 364816_365270
upper left yeah up down flip . 365270_366918
and then if she does a sideways flip . 366918_369161
where's that green triangle that's all by itself ? 369161_371178
right . 371178_372053
um left . 372053_374321
where is it gonna go ? 374321_375221
right <upper> corner . 375221_378316
left . 378316_379146
here first she did an up down flip +. 379146_381863
right . 381863_382146
and then a sideways flip . 382146_383103
Sarah was telling us where we would go from starting position with
no first she did an up down flip Sarah . 386483_388413
it would really help Sarah if you stop playing the glitter on the
(be)cause that's gonna be so much more valuable to you
okay . 399908_401190
so . 401190_401856
Brittany gave you one way to transform that core square into the
she said you could do an up down flip followed by a sideways flip .
turn . 411051_412145
turn how ? 412145_413445
could you turn it and get it looking that way Kelly ? 413445_415640
up down flip then turn right +/. 415640_417171
one fourth . 417171_418840
one fourth . 418840_419238
up down right and then turn right one fourth . 419238_421555
yep . 421555_426345
is there another way to do it ? 426345_427771
by the way some of you are having a hard time waking up today . 427771_431605
&~hav if it hasn't clicked in yet we did this identical activity
we talked about all three of these &~s strips and we talked out loud
and yesterday you guys did an excellent job . 441183_444248
so I think some of you are fuzzy headed by the snow . 444248_447706
but swing back around and lets talk about what you're gonna
(be)cause you won't be using that core square will you Teddy ? 452641_454911
nope . 454911_456108
yesterday we designed the core squares we're gonna be
(al)though we will be using two color core squares yep . 459040_463073
+< Missus Curtis me and Paul are partners and we weren't here . 463073_465281
you and Paul and Brian are partners . 465281_466980
uh no uh yeah . 466980_468450
you were here yesterday when you designed your core square . 468450_470850
xxx . 470996_478861
yep yeah but I don't think anyone made that core square I think
have a seat Amanda because Jillian can't see behind you I can't see
thanks sit down flat on the carpet . 490850_492305
okay with your partner today . 492305_495298
the first thing you'll need to do . 495298_496448
Nicole can you reach <behind me and hand> behind you and hand
+^ behind me you mean ? 502223_502958
no don't reach behind me reach behind Nicole . 502958_504941
alright these should look familiar by now . 504941_507448
this is just exactly the size of a +//? 507551_509420
core square . 509420_510883
core square yeah . 510883_512203
and yesterday you and your partner um selected a color scheme you
Paul and Justin and Brian you just used kind of an excess of
<aw> . 528673_529040
and all this is is to remind you what you thought of . 529040_531586
okay so what your group needs to do today +/. 531586_535030
there's one group of three and the rest of you are in pairs . 535030_538151
+, is you need to make six two sided core squares . 538151_542596
is it xxx ? 542496_544341
no . 544341_545185
do like each one of us makes three ? 545185_547071
uhhuh . 547071_548151
that would be one way to do it except Brian Justin and Paul each of
two . 553796_555661
yeah they're in a group of three . 555661_557075
two four six . 557075_558323
okay why do you think I'm asking you to make six two sided core
so you can have six to make your strip . 562006_564640
right . 564640_565513
(be)cause then by pooling the ones you made together you can la
