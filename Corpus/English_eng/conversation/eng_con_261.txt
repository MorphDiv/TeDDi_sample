twenty one days do n't you when you move to no she notified the one
0 .
and notified .
I mean they all ought to be geared up for all this for Christ 's

But I mean it 's like Hugh they said he had n't registered or
Yeah but he was n't paying it before was he .

Yeah .
So when the bit of paper came they just ignore it .
They said he .
Well .
you you have n't paid when he was out at cos you have to notify
Mm .
so one council 's got a bit of paper and it ties up with the other
