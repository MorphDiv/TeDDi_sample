it looks like Brian's . 35688_37663
it looks like Brian's . 37663_38572
what does that say about those two core squares ? 38572_40592
they're the same . 40592_41848
they're the same . 41848_42697
who can prove to Kevin another way that the the way he
we could turn it to the left a quarter that's what Asarebea showed
who can think of a different way to show Kevin that his core square
what would you do +... 60490_62795
let me see Dani what would you do ? 62795_64378

turn left one fourth . 70043_73198
it's the same . 73198_73982
+< that that does um turn Kevin's into Brian's very good but
good noticing good thinking through those movements can somebody
how else could I flip or turn Kevin's core square so that it looked
Jenna what do you think ? 94055_96192
turn um two fourths right . 96192_102985
turn two fourths right . 102985_104663
hmm that one didn't quite work out did it ? 104663_111113
okay want me to put it back to the beginning and think about how
there is a way to do it by turning right . 120315_129140
you started through your thinking when you use what you saw . 129140_131320
move three fourths right . 131320_133140
two fourths right ? 133140_135108
three . 135108_135723
three fourths right that's a turn we've never saw before . 135723_139710
will you watch please and see what happens . 139710_141982
I'll do it once standing on this side and then I'll do it once
Jenna's idea is to turn Kevin's core square to the right three
one two three . 154878_160408
it works . 160408_162830
+< okay now watch while I do that again . 162830_166062
here's the way Kevin described to us now watch Jenna's movement of
one two three what happens ? 173077_178227
Brian's . 178227_179315
+< it's Brian's . 179315_179617
+< it's Brian's . 179617_180342
so are Kevin's idea and Brian's idea the same core square ? 180342_183652
yes . 183652_184210
yes . 184210_184772
Kevin do you see that too that it's just +/. 184772_187220

um turning mine into Brian's . 191125_193717
I would love to hear that I'm glad you've been thinking +//. 193717_195307

what would you do to make it +/. 201975_202510
turn left and +//. 202510_205342
that's what Asarebia did . 205342_206455
+< oh turn left one fourth ? 206455_207862
yeah . 207862_207983
+< yeah . 207983_208417
you know what we've only had turning ways so far . 208417_210688
is it possible to flip Kevin's core square to make it look like
&=gasps . 216507_216963
yes . 216963_217560
oh I know . 217560_218472
what do you think Asratu ? 218472_220950
um flip it . 220950_223248
how should I flip it ? 223248_225202
flip it um upside down . 225202_232465
flip it down ? 232465_233985
yes . 233985_234560
oh hold on demolished core square . 234560_238515
&=giggles . 238515_239158
Polydrons are nice because they let me put them together and um
they fall . 245848_246572
no . 246572_247332
when I flip them over you see the same colors on the front and the
no . 254713_255443
xxx paper . 255443_256130
but if +//. 256130_257157
that kind but then I'd have to spend a lot of time taping or
but if you color on the back . 261628_263190
yeah if I colored on the back what a unique idea . 263190_266013
next week that's exactly what we'll be doing when we learn more
okay this is Kevin's way and Asratu I mean Kevin's core square
let's see what happens . 277413_278703
did it become Brian's ? 278703_281648
no . 281648_282098
no . 282098_282532
could you add a movement to your that ? 282532_285615
Asratu could you give me one more direction that would help it look
turn um turn +... 291320_297148
let him think please Justin . 297148_302827
so think whether you want me to turn right or left . 302827_307892
Asratu you pretty +/. 307892_310508
+< turn left . 310508_311612

okay that gets it looking like that . 314508_317765
xxx . 317765_318380
looks like Kelly's . 318380_319725
okay hold on we're starting there again . 319725_322345
Asratu's idea was to flip it down and now he says turn right one
what did he get ? 327798_328655
Brian's . 328655_330952
but how (a)bout that could he why didn't it work with just a
here's Kevin's core square we flipped it down . 334502_337567
how come it's not Brian's core square yet ? 337567_340207
because um +/. 340207_341283
+< (be)cause Brian's was on um the blue was on the side and
okay so what Asratu did is think it through he said okay I uh uh
so are Brian's core square and Kevin's core square the same ? 360113_363258
yeah . 363258_363780
and I have a good one . 363780_364498

hold on please until I get it colored in and step out of the way
+< Alex's . 411240_412097
it's just like Alex's . 412097_413362
no it isn't . 413362_414128
yeah except they're different colors . 414128_416290
xxx . 416290_416363
+< well um different colors make (th)em different core square
well let's test I don't know I think that's an interesting idea . 420185_425068
I need to make Paul's and see if we can turn it into Alex's . 425068_429250
can't +//. 429250_429555
if we can turn Paul's into Alex's then they're the same . 429555_432892
if we can turn Paul's into Alex's they're the same . 432892_437180
+< yeah . 437180_438060
xxx . 438060_439892

(be)cause there's only one way to do it . 443772_446315
we'll see . 446315_447150
okay did I construct Paul's core square ? 447150_452482
yeah . 452482_453155
yes . 453155_453580
Paul does that look like yours ? 453580_454963
okay who's ready to tell me how I can move it or flip it or turn it
+< you can't make it . 460450_461343
you can't . 461343_462247
oh but Brittany you told me you thought they were the same . 462247_464023

no . 495652_496237
no . 496237_497268
ah what if I do a flip and a turn like Asratu did ? 497268_501065
no . 501065_501963
what if I flip it down and turn it right one half ? 501963_508213
no . 508213_509157
no . 509157_510252

okay so did Alex and Paul each find a different way to make a core
+< yes . 555547_556418
yep so quickly I have to click Alex's together (be)cause that's a
how many ways have we found so far ? 561707_563460
four ! 563460_564060
do you think there are more ? 564060_565303
