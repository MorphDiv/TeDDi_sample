and what . 260_1630
so that by the time they sat down they had a vast background of
I mean in a short time Brittany was on for I'd say . 7560_10100
oh I don't know . 10770_11160
forty five minutes tops . 11990_13150
today . 13300_13500
uhhuh . 13860_13950
and she got eight finished qui designs done . 14330_16900
right . 17130_17300
so Brittany and . 17540_18220
some are more complex than others . 18240_19340
she took to that very easily . 19540_20500
or Kevin another classic example of someone . 21110_23700
start over . 24290_24600
sorry . 25540_25660
yeah . 26390_26630
because it's didn't engage for some reason . 26680_28590
okay . 28810_28940
it's okay . 28990_29390
&-um . 30260_30320
so <you were saying> you were saying that start . 31570_32950
can you start with the question again too . 33000_34100
okay . 34120_34290
so &-uh so you were mentioning at the computer was a a good
mhm . 38720_38990
and I wonder if you could talk to us a little bit about what you
and gimme some examples . 42100_43430
I'm not quite sure . 43900_44580
I understand &-um . 44680_45350
well the way we used the computer software the geometry and design
so instead_of using it piece by piece &-um a little bit here a
we used it much more at the end after we &-um had &-um had learned
so we didn't use it to try to learn the difference between a flip
we wanted to quilt with it . 84440_85790
so by the time my kids sat down in front of the software they were
&-um and it gave them a chance to to actually show themselves
they understood all of those motions and turns and the process by
like I saw Brittany doing some stuff with call what she was doing .
I just had a chance to . 117880_118830
working quickly one thing she had felt only forty five minutes
and they had never been introduced to the culmination of geometry
you can grow you can shrink you can do anything . 127980_131150
&-um in the time she had today I think she came up with eight
now some of them were just copying the core every time . 136170_138840
and like copying the two by two design . 139030_140740
but she had a wide variety there . 140760_142390
and she knew what she was . 142440_143200
doing so . 143370_143700
that's what you mean by design tool . 143720_145100
mhm . 145280_145500
in part right . 145620_146190
you're saying that &-uh what you get outta that is ability to
but once you know what it's that you're you're after &-um what
&-uh you've seen this interface . 155970_157180
mhm . 157620_157970
&-um what do you think of it . 158460_159910
how might you &-uh improve it . 160910_162770
if you say have power to do this . 162840_165950
&-um . 166460_166540
my kids are insist that it needs diagonal flips . 167380_170260
they want to be able to do diagonal flips on their four squares . 170600_174460
they see a real need for that . 174480_176660
and they wish it would do that because they can look at a a
and realize that a diagonal flip would get them what they want . 183020_185380
and that isn't an option available to them . 185770_187770
and they have to find a different combination of flips . 187900_190580
and turns to get them what they want . 190600_192580
&-um . 193320_193420
and what else . 195100_196860
&-um allowing them to keep a record of actually what it is . 197220_201660
they do to that courseware to make either a strip or a two by two
there's no record of that though . 211200_212690
I found that this class after spending so much time talking about
even Kevin I went back to a quote . 220840_222580
he had worked on going hold up just a course for out_of the middles
and said . 228400_228580
okay what did you do your course for here . 228600_229950
and we very little thinking he was able to tell him . 230620_233460
so they are able to go back . 233580_234670
but it would be nice as they were designing the filter all along .
or at_least when they're designing each two by two if in a corner
know so it like it'd be like a record &-uh script almost . 245200_247500
mhm . 248070_248190
I said . 248360_248470
of movements . 248890_249370
they went through on that course . 249470_250540
where to get the design . 250640_251760
mhm . 252460_252670
so that they could use that to help them talk to others and
so did you want a a wider variety of flips at_least to include
&-um how_about the terms . 265720_266720
do you want (th)em to quantify . 266860_267860
their . 267880_268140
I noticed that <the kids> the kids are more specifically . 268400_270590
mhm . 271620_271990
computer . 272040_272280
they say . 272390_272830
well you turned it a quarter . 272960_273900
you turn it a half . 273940_274780
it'd be nice . 275270_275590
the computer just says . 275700_276410
oh I turned it . 276480_277030
I would . 277400_277540
yeah I would like it . 277600_278450
if &-um at_least it was . 278560_280140
I know you can set how much it's turning . 280750_282310
and I all set on a quarter note because we've been talking about .
teacher . 287500_287650
can . 287740_287890
yes . 288660_288690
but it would be nice if &-um there were more options in there . 289430_292630
so I could kind see &-um rotate right a quarter rotate right a half
and then maybe the teacher could adjust . 298460_299940
if you were gonna use eighth of insurance . 300040_301390
it could be an eighth a fourth then half . 301460_303830
what_about letting the kid put in . 304130_305060
an eighth . 305300_305420
yeah that'd be fine . 306230_307270
but it'd be nice . 307320_307740
if before instead_of just clicking turn if you knew for sure . 307890_311170
'cause I know I hear my kids going . 311630_312550
okay . 312750_312910
I'm gonna turn right a half . 312960_313790
and they go and they turn . 313840_314620
and they go . 314640_314990
oh that wasn't gonna happen . 315040_315670
they click again . 315720_316390
but if they could just say once they've done that thinking and know
yeah
