those pictures of the people jumping out of the eightieth floor,
I just +//. 0_3990
yeah, it was incredible . 4060_4880
I saw th@i <there were> they had people, like, standing
hm@fp yeah . 7330_7850
&=breath &=noise . 9470_10700
it just boggles your mind that it is all real, and &=breath that it
and +//. 11150_15630
xxx unbelievable . 14090_15760
<I me@i> &=swallow I mean, look at the New_York skyline,
it doesn't look the same anymore . 18080_24730
<it doesn't look> &=breath it is not, like, hes@fp different
it s@i looks like any other city now . 18080_24730
no . 18880_19480
all I'm going to New_York for a conference in November, and I
you know, all of them . 25080_32380
&=laugh . 30540_31070
&=breath &=noise . 30780_31550
are we ready to go ? 36690_37270
mhm . 38060_38750
uh+huh . 38080_38660
&=laugh . 38950_40170
&=laugh . 39150_40270
&=laugh . 39460_40010
all right . 41050_52590
uhm@fp &=smack so we were uhm@fp &=smack hm@fp hm@fp relatively
they don't have, uhm@fp &=smack hes@fp what did they say, corporate
yeah, so we had some tasks to get done . 43790_45810
yeah . 43790_45810
okay . 46450_47250
&=breath . 46450_47250
okay . 52280_53000
<so they weren't a@i> so, they weren't able to do that . 53090_54830
&=cough . 55150_56040
all right . 55300_60210
well, you can always buy something from them and get reimbursed . 55300_60210
it takes, like, three weeks, but it is an option . 55300_60210
&=breath . 55300_60210
yeah . 57590_58140
yeah . 59880_64130
uhm@fp hopefully we won't need to buy all that much . 59880_64130
that you know, we can't cover that . 59880_64130
so +//. 59880_64130
right . 63900_68090
&=breath and I sent a fax to the Physics_Stockroom, so we should
hey . 67350_71060
xxx oh, could I have one ? 67350_71060
I only had one . 67350_71060
cool . 67400_69480
well, and +//. 67400_69480
<but basically> and all three of you are licensed to make
just, you know, be sure to give me a copy so I can keep track
oh, okay . 73870_74570
okay, yeah . 74130_75090
no problem . 74130_75090
uh@fp we we talked to uh@fp to to xxx down in the
does he want more than one ? 75840_77740
or just +//. 75840_77740
yeah . 78210_78640
xxx I just had one . 79620_81510
so +//. 79620_81510
oh, okay . 79800_80270
uhm@fp you know, <and we got our rec@i> he set up our
okay, terrific . 83420_84280
<and he said that> uhm@fp &=swallow you know, we talked about
&=swallow we're gonna start using &=breath uhm@fp Solidworks . 83760_94820
&=swallow use it as a tutorial . 83760_94820
i@i <it sh@i> it shouldn't be too hard . 83760_94820
okay, great . 94890_95570
like, I I've used Autocad . 95060_98910
I pro@i programmed at four and xxx &=breath
and and and plus &=breath plus xxx would help
I think the first thing we're gonna design will be the uhm@fp
I think that is <made a li@i> a little easier thing to do
'cause it is pretty much just a &=breath like a bullet shaped
right . 108840_109380
&=laugh . 108840_109380
<with a> you know , like a hole in the bottom, hole in the
&=breath and, like, s@i you know, slots in the middle, so that
like, if it was solid, you couldn't get the battery in it, so . 109270_122000
mhm . 111320_111950
mhm . 121120_121490
right . 121440_124730
so, it is like a kind of a pocket that you're pushing it in . 121440_124730
yeah . 121440_124730
yeah, it is like slip the thing in the pocket . 122860_132060
<and forget> <they would be like s@i> you can like
&=breath so, if it'll be a pretty easy design to do, <and
yeah . 131060_137880
you could even look at some that has already been done . 131060_137880
xxx you know, there is battery holders and casings . 131060_137880
yeah th@i +//. 137800_138460
the xxx devices, yeah . 138330_139530
hm@fp right . 139150_139690
I'm sure there is something we could find . 139590_140960
ha@i have you thought any more about the parallel versus
uhm@fp . 144330_145150
hm . 145010_145670
&=smack I guess it won't matter . 146780_148890
you'll have the same battery casing . 146780_148890
you just reminded me of that, actually . 147480_152960
I have some stuff drawn up and I didn't even remember that . 147480_152960
okay . 149290_149800
hm@fp okay . 153000_153720
yeah, <that may be something w@i> hes@fp maybe if we
pen me . 156740_157230
get your own pen, Jesus . 158160_159970
I don't have a pen . 158790_160520
my bag is over there . 158790_160520
all right . 160810_171790
uhm@fp uhm@fp and hes@fp the couple times we tried calling
so, I I can give her until the end of the week . 160810_171790
and if I can't get a hold of her, I'll try someone else . 160810_171790
<to see> even a little closer . 160810_171790
okay . 167680_168200
just go to someplace else, okay . 169290_171280
sounds good . 172330_173060
the only only reason why we went there to begin with 'cause
right . 176940_178930
and they've been so helpful before . 176940_178930
yeah . 176940_178930
yeah, they've been helpful . 177830_182880
and they seem pretty cool, so, try to help them out a little bit .
but if they can't, then we tried . 177830_182880
yeah . 178300_178930
okay . 182990_185310
&=breath try to, then, this week . 182990_185310
yeah . 185160_189240
so, you know, I'll give them 'till Friday . 185160_189240
&=breath &=noise &=smack &=throat . 185160_189240
okay, sounds good . 187290_188240
what else do you think you wanna design using the elastic+polymers
&=breath . 191300_194170
uhm@fp I guess that would be it . 194210_202860
th@i the other thing I want to use the lab for was the casing
right . 198600_199120
&=smack that makes perfect sense . 200830_202010
and you can just use the Abs_plastic for that . 202460_204610
yeah . 204670_210620
'cause it it'll be thin, and it i@i it could be
&=breath &=noise . 204670_210620
yeah . 205110_205560
okay . 210140_211070
&=breath hm@fp . 212090_212680
great . 213440_220930
&=breath well, that covers uh@fp two of the things that we were
&=breath we also have the uh@fp marketing plan . 213440_220930
I have a marketing outline to hand out . 220860_230450
&=smack it is very general . 220860_230450
<it just> uhm@fp &=smack basically what the survey would
and +//. 220860_230450
okay, great . 222520_223090
okay, sounds great . 230580_231470
&=breath &=noise . 231670_232450
look this over . 232700_233440
one thing I was thinking is it would be a good thing to take with
<if you could get> I don't know . 232870_246080
xxx something for us to shoot for, I don't know how you guys feel .
&=breath I think it would be real good to have something, you know,
a tangible prototype ? 242930_243860
definitely . 244630_245140
right . 246530_249090
which is just about a month from now . 246530_249090
yeah . 246530_249090
a month month from now . 248070_251110
a month from today . 248070_251110
so basically, I thought we would uhm@fp test the prototype by
okay . 260600_261180
&=breath &=noise . 264050_264440
okay . 264520_265030
<and ask> just have them fill out a survey afterwards, and
so, &=breath I may actually sit there and maybe prompt questions,
okay . 273190_276530
the Likert_Scale . 273190_276530
is that a way, like, bring evaluation on ? 273190_276530
yeah, Likert_Scale is like a one to five scale . 275330_277710
okay . 277680_278260
and uh@fp we just ask some close+ended questions that ask them to
but I'm not really sure right now what sort of things to rate . 278050_301140
I don't think we really know that until we have a prototype and we
know a little bit more specific . 278050_301140
&=breath and then, for the verbatim questions, I found that
&=breath and just ask them some open+ended resp@i uh@fp
just maybe two or three of them . 278050_301140
okay . 290240_290800
verbatim questions are like just like +//. 301100_302700
that sounds good . 301560_302160
what do you think about this ? 302990_305820
and then they can say whatever they wanna say . 302990_305820
what do you think about this, okay . 303480_304680
&=smack right . 305780_308720
and they might pinpoint things you haven't thought of . 305780_308720
yeah . 305780_308720
yeah . 307830_308390
would you record those ? 308210_309210
hm ? 309630_310040
would you record those ? 310050_311020
they'll be rewriting them down on the survey, so . 311370_318590
&=breath and then, as far as, like, the personal interviews, I can
okay . 313220_313730
that is what I mean . 318000_319990
that is what I was talking about, personal interviews . 318000_319990
yeah, the personal interviews, <I can> I can record them, like
okay, that sounds great . 326860_327800
if you can get good great quotes that way if you xxx
&=laugh . 329730_331010
right . 330550_336230
&=laugh &=breath that is true . 330550_336230
&=breath when they gush all over the jacket and say how much
&=laugh oh, I love it, I love it . 334870_336870
hm@fp yeah . 335450_335990
if it keeps getting cold, like they're predicting for this weekend,
yeah . 342550_351000
<I thought> hes@fp I mean, assuming the prototype would
so people actually have an opportunity to use it . 342550_351000
okay, great . 350960_351580
yeah . 351030_358080
I think deep fall is the best time . 351030_358080
<just like> 'cause today I woke up, wore a long sleeve shirt .
and now it is like seventy outside, and eighty . 351030_358080
so +//. 351030_358080
right . 355510_356160
mhm . 356990_357700
mhm . 357090_357540
an@i and that is exactly what you wanna do . 357510_361060
turn the jacket on, turn the jacket off . 357510_361060
so +//. 357510_361060
exactly . 358870_359670
the variable conditions is the most frustrating to deal with,
and then, that is where I think it fit the best . 360450_366430
yeah . 361640_362000
mhm . 364730_365230
have you thought about how to recruit people for the survey ? 366550_368800
&=smack uh@fp yeah, basically people that I know here in the lab,
okay . 371410_371960
all right . 373230_373670
and I even thought, like, even we might be able to do it, but we
right . 378870_379300
uhm@fp but yeah, just friends and colleagues and stuff . 379200_385890
and I thought people that maybe we all know &=breath get it . 379200_385890
I think twenty people shouldn't be too hard . 379200_385890
hm@fp t@i +//. 383830_384640
do you think we're gonna need to have any kind of reward ? 386170_389750
like gift certificate type thing ? 386170_389750
yeah, a gift certificate to something . 388730_390980
uhm@fp . 388730_390980
okay . 390310_392420
and we have the budget for that, so . 390310_392420
yeah, I'm not sure, like, how much money to give them, or &=breath
what did we put in the budget ? 395780_396850
we put uh@fp three hundred dollars in for marketing . 396780_398700
okay . 398810_399510
yeah, so that leaves us uhm@fp to give them something like a
okay, that sounds good . 404580_405990
two days, yes . 406630_408980
xxx +//. 406630_408980
yeah . 407340_407970
maybe to, like, Barnes_and_Noble, or a restaurant, or something . 409500_412470
&=breath &=noise . 411100_411580
yeah . 411980_412400
that sounds good . 412440_413280
I wonder if we could find people of different kind of walks of life
like +//. 413510_417500
that is what you need to do . 417330_418470
xxx +//. 417330_418470
hm@fp yeah . 418110_418540
yeah, different genders, different professions, and different ages
&=breath so +//. 418480_423330
<as far as people who are> I mean, like, I'm hardly ever
hm@fp yeah . 422130_422640
and I guess xxx +//. 423850_424610
they also have to be the same size, though, right ? 424050_425680
&=laugh we only have one prototype . 425900_428050
&=laugh right . 426360_428590
well, <I mean we could see how> yeah . 426770_432290
I mean, w@i <if we could> <if this person> hes@fp
if w@i +//. 430160_430650
yeah, if we can get more than one prototype, then we might be able
yeah . 438500_439130
mhm . 438560_439010
&=smack okay, that I think that sounds really good . 440430_450300
&=breath &=smack so uhm@fp another thing that I've noticed on the
hm . 450440_451060
mhm . 450480_450960
we have a preliminary one that you did, I believe . 451370_453720
mhm . 453010_453760
and then talking to xxx <there was > th@i there were
l@i a license . 461560_463480
yeah . 463300_464770
yeah . 463300_464770
yeah . 463450_464030
have you all given any thought to that ? 465230_466690
uhm@fp &=smack &=breath not really . 466540_474640
uhm@fp the there was the uh@fp notion of the
yeah, it is a cheap patent . 474940_476120
yeah . 475930_476510
okay . 476390_476920
which is +//. 477430_477990
so, it is only seventy five dollars . 477680_479140
<and it is> <it is> e@i an@i e@i +//. 479060_480400
hm, that is good . 479220_480120
talk to xxx +//. 479940_480910
yeah xxx and and it is really broad, you don't really have to
yeah . 480920_481340
I actually think we should apply for that right away . 487070_488620
xxx +//. 487330_487740
yeah, I think that is a good idea . 488910_490090
I think you should, I mean, like, this week, s@i start moving
just 'cause that is actually good to say, when you present
&=breath &=noise . 490760_491150
mhm . 496550_497080
right . 500350_500700
&=smack I guess we have some things that we're gonna need to
&=breath &=smack I would like to move forward, also, on the design
yep . 507410_508290
&=breath &=noise . 507410_508290
xxx &=throat +//. 510210_510990
<well let us just> let us work backwards from October
right . 517090_517700
okay . 522050_522620
'cause the the uhm@fp I guess four weeks from today
yeah, I think that is right . 527170_528620
that that is when you guys would need to be thinking about xxx
okay . 531470_532050
all right . 533910_544940
so, let us talk about all the tests we need to get done and
xxx makes the most sense . 533910_544940
we need to &=breath uhm@fp get the tailor, and get the tailor to
&=breath &=noise . 537660_538110
yep . 544860_545550
&=throat . 544860_545550
hes@fp are they doing the shell or the core ? 546430_548120
hes@fp with extra line, the core . 546810_554300
&=breath yeah, <I think> <I mean it b@i> <I would >
or the core, rather . 547900_550340
liner, whatever . 547900_550340
yeah . 547900_550340
&=throat . 550200_551340
not by the time we go to Reno . 554240_556570
well, just if it is just, like, uhm@fp out of the package
hm . 560670_561110
<that would be> I think that would give people a m@i more
yeah, 'cause then you can see the jacket inside . 564160_569580
like you can see any any kind of craziness . 564160_569580
I'll finish that . 564160_569580
much m@i more work . 564160_569580
all right . 566910_567440
no . 569270_575500
I mean, as long as we're not designing it, and just so
well, uh@fp yeah . 572420_582230
that hes@fp hm@fp I think we use a standard one . 572420_582230
or &=breath the the girl <who was> who who gave
<I haven't> I haven't spoken to her, yet, so . 572420_582230
mhm . 579360_579820
oh, yeah . 581780_583650
hm@fp okay . 581780_583650
that makes sense . 581780_583650
I don't know what is her plans with the next hm@fp couple months, I
or weeks, so . 583590_587270
right, everyone's life is kind of disrupted there . 587180_589480
very . 588670_590560
yeah, everything is completely disrupted . 588670_590560
yeah, I know . 589740_594450
so, uh@fp we might just even go with the pattern one . 589740_594450
&=smack something just shows . 589740_594450
yeah . 590330_590950
yeah, just a peacoat . 592960_597110
or a s@i Gortex type jacket, or something like that . 592960_597110
yeah . 592960_597110
yeah . 596400_596820
<because even> I mean, if there is any &=breath chance of this
right, that fits with their kind of +//. 604900_606240
mhm . 605920_606570
hes@fp &=smack their their style for for that season,
corporate style . 607200_608820
yeah, exactly . 607200_608820
yeah . 608390_609060
okay, that sounds good . 609730_610930
okay, <so the> so the tailor make +//. 610630_612580
okay, <we need to also> we just mentioned <the surpri@i>
mhm . 615670_616160
we need to uh@fp <make th@i> hes@fp make the battery +//.
&=breath &=noise . 619050_619580
controller and the battery holders . 619680_621540
yep . 620520_621090
right . 621140_621580
well, I mean, we also need to design the technical layout of the
like, we have, the &=breath you know, the kind of parts,
right, exactly . 626150_627150
yeah, <we need> xxx we need help from doctor xxx group for
xxx +//. 632320_632710
we may need help for that . 633260_634420
yeah . 634010_634440
&=smack okay . 634360_634920
what does his group do ? 635400_636220
pardon ? 636830_637140
what does his group do ? 637180_638070
xxx doctor xxx <he is just> he is the man . 638150_641990
&=breath &=noise . 638150_641990
just doctor xxx just +//. 639240_641130
no . 640660_652170
<he has> <well he has got a whole> I mean whenever we
he has got a a whole stable of +//. 642750_644780
right . 644490_645270
&=laugh . 644490_645270
huh . 652060_654000
<that might be be@i> &=laugh that would be better . 652060_654000
all right . 652130_652650
you said that +//. 654370_655010
no, I I would go to them first and get there they'll
okay . 655960_661470
&=breath well, yeah, <maybe we> we'll just go with what we
hm@fp h@i +//. 655960_661470
&=smack you said that you had some designs sketched out . 660690_664220
are they designs for, like, the wiring placement, or ? 660690_664220
not designs . 663960_665750
more like tests . 663960_665750
like +//. 663960_665750
okay . 665850_666430
xxx was talking big time about testing, when we had that meeting .
and +//. 666460_669480
hm@fp right . 669180_669680
<we're just trying to figure out, you know, what> obviously
but we're not sure if it is gonna be &=throat long and thin, or
right . 675350_675820
okay . 688270_688720
so, I mean, &=breath one way, it heats up quick, but it use a lot
oh, okay . 702850_703440
or oh, or thirty seconds, and then it is still good . 703600_709140
&=breath and that might even give us better battery life in the
right . 709080_709480
&=throat and then &=breath the second thing is to figure out how to
&=breath and then just run it at, like uh@fp <seventy five>
just, you know, &=breath turn it on and go until it dies . 709610_744070
&=breath &=throat and then the fourth thing was &=breath where
right . 734110_734570
thermistors . 743760_744350
yeah, thermistors . 744750_745730
okay . 745650_746210
but I was thinking that it might not matter, because, you know, if
but the user is just gonna adjust it to where he is comfortable, so
mhm . 755760_756260
right . 756070_756540
I mean, <we not> we might not have to say, you know, let us
<you know I almost feel> <I mean, I don't know what> <I
just right now it is a dial, like, low and high . 766770_768850
<there is the> I think if xxx it is a dial, you know,
mhm . 769890_770290
exactly . 774090_774770
yeah . 774190_774820
hm@fp right . 774370_777360
and that simplifies the design quite a bit . 774370_777360
that is what I thought, too . 775660_776590
yeah, <so I don't even know> <I mean t@i> but you
yeah . 777420_778080
well, uh@fp you need one for the temperature control unit to work,
or hes@fp for to you know how it goes up to the
so I think &=breath it needs some sort of readout on there . 785110_796120
hes@fp if I remember right ? 785110_796120
yeah, it needs to know the temperature that it is at to
how much current to send ? 800200_801970
okay . 800200_801970
yeah . 800930_804320
yeah . 800930_804320
because, you know, there is curves, and like he said i@i +//. 800930_804320
<is that on> is that an off the shelf thing ? 803730_805390
that is a Gorix design thing . 805820_807490
so <I don't know> I don't know if they're selling it retail,
yeah hm@fp &=breath +//. 808210_809270
&=smack yeah, <I don't th@i> I don't know what their &=breath
okay . 813730_814450
but if it is simple, we might be able to +//. 814880_816780
to recreate it . 816320_817210
and, I mean, maybe maybe make it better, but at least make it
I don't know if the patent says, like, you can't make a temperature
&=breath &=noise . 831490_831970
I I think interface at all would be a pretty broad patent . 831850_835990
I don't know if anyone would grant that, I mean . 831850_835990
no, no . 834920_835850
no . 835920_836440
all right . 835970_836970
I've +//. 835970_836970
usually you have to be really specific in your patent . 836320_839240
&=laugh . 836320_839240
until you actually go to bring this something to market,
<you c@i> you can design it and have it in your prototype, and
mhm . 838450_839000
&=throat . 844220_844780
mhm . 851300_851760
okay . 855130_855600
okay . 862240_862690
all right . 863380_863790
sounds good . 864930_870450
so, &=swallow hm@fp let us see, what else do we need to talk about
we've got that, &=breath got that . 864930_870450
uhm@fp . 864930_870450
&=breath &=noise . 868680_869200
the charger . 870380_895880
we're gonna to uhm@fp to have a &=breath t@i <both
&=breath and then we're also going to design the one that is going
that every user is gonna have, you know, when they buy the jacket,
right . 871460_872140
mhm . 879210_879720
into the jacket . 895350_896430
right . 895350_896430
so &=breath <it should be as simple as a simple> hes@fp 'cause
&=breath you take the capacity, and just divide it by four,
&=breath and then what you just do is you just get a
that shouldn't be that hard . 896270_922950
&=breath uhm@fp but we just still need to do that . 896270_922950
just to it has has to be done . 896270_922950
<well we could> oh, no . 896570_897890
mhm . 902480_903110
mhm . 909270_909760
mhm . 918310_918830
so, both the charger and the interface need to be designed, 'cause
yeah, &=breath &=smack yeah . 927650_934870
and then that that is where we'll address the issue of the
yeah, good call . 928860_930830
&=breath &=noise . 928860_930830
right . 932920_933560
<I think some of these things> obviously we wanna get as much
&=breath the testing can wait . 935200_948280
we don't really need to get into that yet . 935200_948280
and the battery charger is something that +//. 935200_948280
mhm . 942910_943400
we don't need to do that anyway . 948180_949200
exactly . 949000_952670
because we can just put fresh batteries in right now, if we need to
well, when we get them, I think they're gonna be dead . 952120_954170
oh, really ? 954260_954780
I don't know . 954790_955540
you think ? 955840_956370
I don't know . 956410_961940
<well usually g@i> well usually when
do you know what I mean ? 956410_961940
I don't know . 962360_963950
we'll have to get some . 962360_963950
I think we have to make the charger right away . 963200_964550
okay . 964490_965070
we need to build it . 965310_972870
and, we may need to go to, like, the physics labs to get, like,
&=throat . 965610_967000
<yeah how are we gonna> that is what I was just gonna say . 972530_977370
I was gonna say, buy them at Radio_Shack, but there is nothing
right . 972860_973440
(be)cause, I mean, like I said, like +//. 974410_975480
yeah, exactly . 975870_979830
<we are> we are actually gonna f@i custom make them
well you coul@i +//. 978300_978810
<do you think> do you think some one has little
I don't know . 978400_984990
you you could take something from Radio_Shack and just like
yeah, exactly . 983850_988290
&=breath . 983850_988290
modify . 986490_987180
yeah . 987390_994570
yeah, <just make it a little m@i> what is this xxx <this
xxx +//. 987390_994570
right, just connect positively to negatively, and run it over
yeah . 996940_1002290
but let us xxx something that we could reuse, instead of
&=laugh . 1000100_1000650
well, for right now I think the tape wire thing would be a
yeah . 1007290_1007650
I don't know, I mean, okay . 1008210_1011340
but I'll I don't think it is gonna work . 1008210_1011340
we'll try it, though . 1008210_1011340
if you don't th@i +//. 1009590_1010230
uhm@fp okay . 1011590_1012090
and even if we can just charge one battery at a time right now, it
we just need to <focus on> make sure they're charged up . 1015460_1020740
but we +//. 1015940_1016410
yeah . 1018660_1019260
&=breath . 1018660_1019260
well let us see . 1019510_1020410
and have you thought about what kind of wires you're gonna use to
I know that was an an issue . 1021750_1026670
the uhm@fp +//. 1025700_1027330
we have some awesome braided wire that xxx +//. 1026690_1030360
<yeah we have> yeah, we have some some nice samples
&=breath <those are nice &=breath like soft> <it wa@i>
okay, great . 1034900_1035780
right . 1040980_1041440
uh@fp . 1040980_1041440
loopy . 1042090_1042830
&=smack <I remem@i> 'cause the last time there were issues
and so this will xxx +//. 1043280_1047510
yeah . 1045950_1049360
&=breath 'cause it <it wa@i> it was a single coil as
that was terrible . 1046070_1047930
it was disgusting . 1046070_1047930
right . 1049230_1058780
hm@fp okay, that sounds great . 1049230_1058780
&=swallow okay, well, we've got a lot of different priorities, and
&=breath I think uh@fp +//. 1049230_1058780
&=breath &=noise &=smack &=throat . 1053840_1055490
&=laugh . 1055960_1056630
okay . 1056440_1059630
<so let us> what is the most important ? 1056440_1059630
well, I think one thing we should can ask uh@fp xxx to do is
&=smack okay . 1064150_1064660
yeah . 1064200_1064630
and you have all the materials from the application and from
uhm@fp yeah, yeah . 1068870_1070230
that'll be give you almost everything you need to do . 1070230_1072380
you don@i +//. 1070230_1072380
yeah, it is just a matter of filling it out, I think . 1071680_1073590
&=smack okay . 1073910_1074380
do you know where to go for that ? 1074290_1075240
it is online, the provisional+patent thing . 1075770_1078060
uh@fp is there like a website ? 1075820_1076810
hm@fp yeah . 1077270_1077870
hm@fp okay . 1077330_1077880
&=smack okay, great . 1079000_1079760
and and if you need, I mean, <if you> to pay the fee,
<you can just> we can issue a PO or that is something we can
and or you can pay for it and we'll reimburse you . 1079970_1090090
one way or the other . 1079970_1090090
right . 1084310_1084790
okay . 1084480_1084820
okay . 1086690_1087130
&=breath &=noise . 1087250_1087780
okay . 1089800_1090150
either way, just let me know, and I'll talk to xxx I'll get the
xxx it might be better if you paid for it, so it was in your name .
<and your> I mean, 'cause if it gets in the University, it
okay . 1094310_1094690
mhm . 1094350_1094830
it could be in the University's name . 1096630_1098820
yeah, okay . 1096630_1098820
the University could claim that they &=laugh +//. 1096950_1099080
yeah, I don't want the University's name on <on the> on
right, exactly . 1100520_1105870
that makes sense . 1100520_1105870
&=breath and if you don't have seventy five dollars, <I cou@i>
oh, yeah, that should be all right . 1104770_1106970
yeah, okay . 1104770_1106970
okay . 1106300_1121930
&=breath 'cause I know that uh@fp when you're just done
&=breath all right, so th@i we'll have you do that . 1106300_1121930
&=breath and uh@fp &=breath I guess you guys &=breath have already
and +//. 1106300_1121930
yeah . 1106920_1107470
&=throat . 1110600_1112400
&=laugh . 1111280_1112430
yeah, we're gonna start hes@fp working on that uh@fp hm@fp
yeah . 1124760_1131670
<so I guess &=breath in this coming week, you should probably get
&=breath &=noise . 1125330_1125710
&=smack what do he say, uh@fp by Solidworks . 1131380_1132900
Solidworks ? 1132310_1132950
Solidworks ? 1132740_1141080
okay . 1132740_1141080
&=breath get the design entered into Solidworks, anyway, and talk
&=breath &=laugh . 1132740_1141080
yeah . 1133630_1133920
&=laugh xxx +//. 1138780_1142190
you and him are like this or what ? 1139870_1142690
&=breath yeah, me and xxx are hanging out . 1139870_1142690
&=laugh xxx +//. 1141110_1142120
talk to doctor xxx &=laugh about uhm@fp setting up uh@fp the design
all right . 1146790_1147230
because then the week after that, that'll let us actually produce
okay . 1155900_1156300
and maybe produce a workable controller, you know . 1156340_1163270
<depending on how quickly> but I think we need to talk to them
yeah . 1159830_1160180
&=breath &=noise . 1162110_1162640
and you're still looking at the tailor situation, so . 1164920_1167430
yeah, hes@fp 'cause once we have the uh@fp hes@fp <the
exactly . 1175780_1176470
okay . 1176970_1177490
how much work is this gonna be for the tailor ? 1177020_1178920
I don't know . 1181040_1182240
uhm@fp . 1181040_1182240
I wouldn't think more than a couple of hours to put one of these
I mean, most of these tailors can work quickly . 1182600_1187740
yeah, we'll do <as much as we have hes@fp t@i> or, hes@fp as
like, you know, we'll give her the pattern already cut out, if
you know, we'll do as much as we could to save her time . 1185720_1199480
&=breath uhm@fp if this is gonna require a@i +//. 1185720_1199480
mhm . 1196880_1197380
so as I <I'm jus@i> I'm trying to figure out what is
&=breath what is the most important thing to get done . 1198840_1205030
is it gonna be the +//. 1198840_1205030
right . 1202020_1202480
uh@fp I think <the elec@i> the the internal workings are
the controller ? 1205420_1206300
the controller . 1206800_1207650
the hardest part ? 1209910_1210560
yeah . 1210430_1221040
&=smack &=breath and we're probably not gonna get the batteries
so, I don't know if we wanna work on the charger after that
'cause we don't know if they're coming in &=breath flat or charged
&=smack hm@fp okay . 1213930_1214410
mhm . 1216880_1217310
okay then . 1218820_1219280
hm@fp yeah . 1220060_1220600
yeah . 1220590_1222190
okay . 1220590_1222190
&=throat . 1221680_1222260
mhm . 1222070_1222590
